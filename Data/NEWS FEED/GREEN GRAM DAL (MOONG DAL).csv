There is abundant water in all the 1,376 minor irrigation tanks.  Incidentally, the area of cultivation of crops during the rabi season has also increased due to the easy availability of water from all the sources.  Against the normal area of cultivation for various crops in 56,365 hectares during the rabi season, it has crossed 74,172 hectares this year.  Paddy cultivation area has increased from the normal 39,864 hectares to 62,630 hectares.  Meanwhile, the area for cultivation of maize has come down, from 12,741 to 9,011 hectares, green gram from 250 to 132 hectares, Bengal gram 329 to 189 hectares, and groundnut from 2,065 to 1,984 hectares.  Agricultural officials welcome the news and see a glut of arrivals of paddy to various market yards and IKP centres after the harvest.  The markets would be literally filled with paddy produce and nothing else. Already, rice millers are struggling to remove stocks purchased during the kharif season to make room for fresh arrivals in the rabi season.  However, farmers, who had sold their paddy during the kharif season, are yet to receive their payments. It is over two months that the IKP centres had purchased their stocks, but ryots are yet to be paid.  Rythu Ikya Vedika district president M. Venkat Reddy said that he has sold his paddy at Veenavanka mandal, two months ago. But, the authorities were yet to make the payments, he complained, and added that he had taken loans for rabi cultivation.  Stating that paddy would arrive in bulk due to the expected bumper harvest, he urged the authorities concerned to chalk out an action plan for its proper procurement and safety from damages due to possible hailstorms.",GREEN GRAM DAL (MOONG DAL)

The import restrictions unnerved Indias traditional suppliers who grow pulses to meet the countrys annual requirements.  India should pursue consistent farm trade policies to help to avoid uncertainty among Canadas farmers, big suppliers of pulses to New Delhi, a Canadian government minister said on Thursday.  Protein-rich pulses are a staple of the Indian diet, and Canada is the worlds top exporter of peas and lentils.  Indias record imports of 6.6 million tonnes of pulses in the 2016/17 fiscal year prompted Canadian and Australian farmers to expand production but New Delhi introduced import curbs the following year, hurting overseas producers.  David Marit, agriculture minister of Canadas Saskatchewan province, said Indias trade policy flip-flops fuelled uncertainty among Canadas farmers.  Saskatchewan is Canadas biggest pulses producer.  We would like to see consistency and transparency in market access, Marit told reporters on the sidelines of the Pulses Conclave, an industry conference.  In the 2016/17 fiscal year, Canada shipped a record 2.4 million tonnes of pulses but last year Canadian imports dropped to 121,861 tonnes. Record imports led to a drop in domestic prices in 2016/17. India then raised import taxes on some pulses to as high as 50% and introduced import quotas for others such as yellow peas, green gram and chickpeas. The import restrictions unnerved Indias traditional suppliers who grow pulses to meet the countrys annual requirements. As Canadas pulses imports to India drop, Ottawa is trying to step up exports to China, Vietnam, Bangladesh and the United Arab Emirates, Marit said.",GREEN GRAM DAL (MOONG DAL)

There would be lower imports next year also because traders might not be able to buy from overseas market, taking advantage of loopholes in the import quota order, which the Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) is contesting in the Jaipur High Court to tighten it, IGPA Chairman Jitu Bheda told reporters.  Total imports are expected to reach 2.5 million tonne in the current year, of which about 1.5 million tonne has been done, taking stay from Chennai and Jaipur High Courts on the DGFT quota order and much of it is yellow peas, black mapte (urad) and green peas, Mr. Bheda said on the sidelines of 5th edition of Pulses Conclave 2020.  The rest one million tonne has been imported as per the governments quota this year, he added.  The government has imposed a quantitative restriction on import of key pulses especially yellow peas, pigeon peas (tur), chickpeas (chana) and green gram (moong) to protect local farmers amid steady increase in domestic production to 23.40 million tonne in the 2018-19 crop year (July-June).  Light Speckled bean (rajmah) and blackeye beans (lobiya) are allowed to import without restrictions. India is the worlds largest consumer of pulses.  Assuming the government continues with current quota system and considering higher domestic crop and buffer stock, maximum 1 million tonnes of pulses can be imported next year and mostly rajmah and lobiya, Mr. Bheda said.  He also said the government may increase quota on import of black mapte and green gram as the domestic shortage is still about 1.5 million tonne and 1 million tonne, respectively.  At present, the import quota on black mapte is 2,50,000 tonne and green gram is 1,50,000 tonne.  We have to import these two pulses as domestic prices are ruling higher than the minimum support price, which may put pressure on retail rates, Mr. Bheda added.  The IPGA Chairman said the industry body has requested the government to extend the current quota on black mapte for two months till May as the crop is yet to be harvested in Myanmar, the only supplier of this commodity in the world.  There is no issue with regard to import of green gram as it is grown in many countries, including Africa, he added.  On illegal imports from Nepal, the industry body said the government should curb such shipments, taking advantage of softening of global rates of pulses following India restricting imports.  The government is targeting a record production of pulses at 26.30 million tonne in the ongoing 2019-20 crop year, of which 16.20 million tonne from the Rabi season and the rest from Kharif season.  At present, Kharif crop is being harvested, while Rabi crop prospects especially chickpeas (chan) seem to be bright, Bheda said.  There is a buffer stock of 3.4 million tonne of pulses at present in the country, according to cooperative Nafed, which has procured on behalf of the government to ensure minimum support price (MSP) to farmers.  Nafed Additional Managing Director S. K. Singh said the cooperative will continue procurement in the current year as well. It plans to buy more of chickpeas from Rabi crop as prices are already below the MSP on expectation of bumper production.",GREEN GRAM DAL (MOONG DAL)

A two-hour, 100-kilometre ride. The sky has changed from glimmering golden orange to purplish black. After crossing the centuries-old forts and temples, we are on a barren, almost empty highway. Just a few dhabas, fuel stations and dirty green thorny plants to look from the car window. The phone, to preserve charge, has been switched off. A prolonged period of inactivity, the lack of interesting sights, the near-constant speed and the full-blast AC of the vehicle causes torpor. Which is when we decide its the best time for a chai break.  The hot and spicy moong dal pakoras served with fried green chilli at the Nagori Cold Drinks tea stall mightnt be world famous. But its now one of my favourite snacks. And, along with the magnificent forts and the spectacular sand dunes of Khimsar, I will equally cherish the small tea stall in Bawari during my two-day stay in Rajasthan. And, thanks to Kogo, I can locate this little known roadside stall and suggest its moong dal pakora.  Kogo, launched in January, is a device-app combo that enables you to minutely track your road trips and effortlessly create multimedia travel stories with them. The soapbar-sized, octagonal gadget (KogoBOT)  which you can carry or attach to your vehicle  has a dedicated GPS and multiple sensors to map the journey. And, the KogoApp takes the data captured by the device and uses Artificial Intelligence to create stories of your travels.  HOW KOGO WORKS Start a trip by entering the destination and choose your sharing preference.  Kogo will create a title for the trip (which you can edit) and start tracking the journey.  After the trip, you can view the details of your trip: route, time, temperature, stops and others.  You can upload pictures and videos of your journey even after the trip; Kogo will use the files timestamp to chronologically slot it in your story.  Origin story  Raj K Gopalakrishnan and Praveer Kochhar conceptualised Kogo during one of their many annual trips to Spiti Valley. We were coming back from the Sangla Valley, says Praveer, And, we were arguing about the location of a place where we had some amazing Maggi with chicken on our previous trip. We spent about an hour and a half trying to zero in on the place but we couldnt. Thats when we were like, We travel so much. So, why cant we log these things?  But whats the need for a new device when your phone can do it?  Praveer answers, I have used a dozen tracking apps. A lot of these apps use the phones GPS. For long duration trips, you need to have the app running all the time in the foreground for the GPS to function. But if you have to use say, WhatsApp or Facebook, then, the apps that arent being used go to the background. In an effort to reduce power consumption, the latest versions of Android limits background apps to receive location updates only a few times every hour, which reduces the mapping accuracy.  Secondly, the KogoBOT is a powerhouse. It can last up to seven days on a single full charge, and save up to 10 days of data even when there is no network.  Praveers third reason is privacy. We foresee that permanent taking of location from mobile phones is going to be completely absent. It might even happen within the next year. Because it is quite infringing on your privacy if your phone is constantly sending data, right? The beauty about Kogo is you can switch it off whenever you want.  When does the tracking begin and end on Kogo? The tracking happens only after you start a trip on the app and are moving. When you are stationary for 20 seconds, the device goes into sleep, so it can conserve battery. The devices vibration sensor knows when you are moving, so, it wakes up and starts tracking again. Once you end the trip, the device  if its on and moving  sends what Praveer calls location pings once in three minutes. And, it stops tracking when switched off.  The Kogo App is a work in progress. It, for instance, doesnt have enough photo or video editing options. Video streaming is often slow. The destination cant be changed after the trip starts.  Whats in store?  Praveer promises significant additons to the app in the next few months. You will have the option to discuss a trip with other users. The second thing is: you will be able to book experiences on the app. For example, we have partnered with Homestays of India, which has over 100 properties across India.  The KogoBOT, priced 7,749 (including a one-year subscription of the KogoApp as an introductory offer), caters mainly to regular road-trippers  occasional travellers might consider it an expensive option. Praveer, however, reckons this niche audience is sufficient for Kogos growth. In India, we identified about 1.3 crore serious travellers. Our aim for the next three years is to reach 300,000 of them and 450,000 outside India. Kogos targetting is to cover a million kilometers within a year for which the company has partnered with JAWA Motorcycle Company to cover 3,00,000 kilometers.  This is just the start, says Praveer.

All the credit goes to Palaniswami for turning all the stumbling blocks into stepping stones. The past three years have been eventful with the Chief Minister announcing new welfare schemes for every section of the society and have been marked by sustained efforts to reach out to the common man. Palaniswami did not allow the developments within the AIADMK, in the first few months of his tenure, to affect the State administration in any way. In fact, in the past 36 months, he has cleared a whopping 16,382 files  an average of 15 files a day  proving there has been no stagnation in the taking of administrative decisions.  Several achievements  The key achievements of this government include declaring Cauvery delta as a protected special agricultural zone, implementation of the Kudimaramath scheme for rejuvenating water resources, ban on single-use plastics, successful conduct of second edition of the Global Investors Meet, providing low-cost cable connections to the poor through Arasu Cable TV, getting Central government approval for 11 new medical colleges, laying the foundation for South Asias biggest livestock park in Salem, receiving Krishi Karman awards for the fifth time, continuously hiking allocations for social security schemes and initiation of the Chief Ministers Special Public Grievance Redressal Scheme.  Jobs boost    The Global Investors Meet held in January 2019 was a major success, attracting `3,00,501 crore worth of investments and providing employment to 10.5 lakh persons. Till date, 53 projects have already commenced commercial production and 219 projects are at various stages of implementation. During investors meets in New York and San Francisco, 41 MoUs were signed with an investment of `8,835 crore generating employment for 35,520 persons. Altogether, during 2019-2020, 63 new MoUs have been signed, committing an investment of `19,136 crore with employment potential for 83,837 new jobs.    To attract new investments, a web portal named Yaadhum Oore was launched in the USA in September 2019. To give approval for investments, the Thozhil Thozhan (Biz Buddy) website was launched and the Tamil Nadu Industrial Guidance & Export Promotion Bureau was renamed as Guidance with a new logo at the Investment and Skill Development Conclave held on November 30, 2019. The Tamil Nadu Aerospace and Defence Industrial Policy was released during the Global Investors Meet 2019. Tamil Nadu State Startup and Innovation Policy 2018-2023 was released by the Chief Minister in January last. To give a fillip to Farmer Producer Organisations (FPOs), a new policy was released on February 9.  Fillip to agricultural sector    In the agriculture sector, under the Kudimaramath scheme, 4,965 works have been completed at a total cost of Rs 930.25 crore. The long-pending Athikadavu-Avinashi scheme is finally becoming a reality with works on at a cost of `1,652 crore. A barrage is being constructed across the Kollidam river at a cost of `427.76 crore. Ensuring Minimum Support Price to farmers produce is one of the important initiatives in which the State government has taken pioneering steps for the procurement of black gram, green gram and copra from farmers under Price Support Scheme.  Besides, the initiative taken for establishing Mega Food Parks in nine select districts for bringing value addition to prevent food wastage and to get good remunerative price for the farmers produce is a key move. The proposal was applied for grant of `10 crore for eight food parks to be developed at Dindigul, Krishnagiri, Salem, Tiruvannamalai, Theni, Madurai, Cuddalore and Villupuram (Tindivanam).

Besides, agreements have been signed with the German Development Bank for buying 12,000 new buses and 2,000 electric buses. To meet the drinking water requirements of Chennai, a new desalination plant has been started at Nemmeli at a cost of Rs 1,259.38 crore. Besides, drinking water and underground sewerage schemes are being implemented at a cost of RS 3,813.95 crore. Combined drinking water schemes at a total cost of Rs 2,638.24 crore are also under implementation in the nine districts of Pudukkottai, Thanjavur, Sivaganga, Cuddalore, Coimbatore, Dindigul, Salem, Nagapattinam and Virudhunagar.  Education focus    The government has established nine new Government Arts and Science Colleges, three University Constituent Arts and Science Colleges and three new Government Polytechnic Colleges during the past three years. An educational channel catering to the needs of students has been launched. The channel telecasts educational programmes 24x7. The government has ordered a four per cent reservation for persons with disabilities in employment in government establishments, Public Sector Undertakings, Corporations and educational institutions.

Tur procurement has started at Vikas Agros Takli centre. (Express photo by Partha Sarathi Biswas)  Why is the government still allowing imports? Why dont they come and see the crop here?, asks Kalyan Hake, pointing to the chana (chickpea) on his six acres, of which the grain on two acres has already been harvested.  As the 32-year-old farmer from Takali Bardpur in Latur taluka and district of Maharashtras Marathwada region prepares to harvest the remaining crop, Hake is visibly nervous about his prospective realisations. The governments minimum support price (MSP) for this years chana is Rs 4,875 per quintal, whereas it is already trading at Rs 4,200 now in Latur APMC (agricultural produce market committee) mandi. If rates are so low before even the marketing season has actually begun, imagine how much they will slide once the crop arrivals happen after Holi, exclaims Hake, who expects his average grain yield at 8 quintals/acre this time, as against 6 quintals for the 2018-19 crop.  ALSO READ | Being one of Indias top pulses exporter, Canada urges govt to pursue consistent farm policies  The Union Agriculture Ministry, on Tuesday, estimated Indias chana production for 2019-20 at 11.22 million tonnes (mt), up from last years 9.94 mt and marginally short of the record 11.38 mt of 2017-18. Farmers have, moreover, planted an all-time-high 107.21 lakh hectares (lh) area under this rabi (winter-spring) pulses crop, compared to 96.19 lh in 2018-19 and 107.08 lh in 2017-18. While the acreage in Madhya Pradesh has dropped from 34.32 lh to 27.38 lh  the abundant water in reservoirs and recharged aquifers from surplus rains have prompted farmers there to sow more wheat instead of chana  it has significantly gone up in states such as Maharashtra (from 13.14 lh to 21.79 lh), Rajasthan (15.03 lh to 21.38 lh), Chhattisgarh (3.71 lh to 4.11 lh) and Gujarat (1.74 lh to 3.78 lh).  At the MSP procurement centre in Takali Bardpur run by Vikas Agro Producer Company Ltd, a farmers cooperative, over 5,000 pulses growers have already registered their crop for sale. I dont know when they will start procurement and when the payment will be made into my bank account. But there is no other place I can sell today. The APMC prices are below MSP and traders say they will fall further if imports arent halted. Why cant the government just do that, rather than spending money for procurement and making us stand in lines? points out Hake.  Tur procurement has started at Vikas Agros Takli centre. (Express photo by Partha Sarathi Biswas) Tur procurement has started at Vikas Agros Takli centre. (Express photo by Partha Sarathi Biswas)  For farmers in the relatively dry Marathwada and Vidarbha region, chana is an ideal rabi crop to grow after their kharif soyabean, which is planted from mid-June (after the monsoon rains) and harvested by October. Cultivated mostly on the residual soil moisture, it requires hardly one round of irrigation, as opposed to three or more for wheat. This time, bountiful rains, especially during the second half of the monsoon (August-September) and extending till early November, has resulted in higher sowings and farmers like Hake even reporting a one-third jump in yields.  In Latur, a major chana-growing district of Maharashtra that also houses one of Indias biggest wholesale market for pulses, many farmers could not take their kharif crop due to poor rains in the first half of the monsoon (June-June). Hake is among those who was forced to skip his soyabean crop and, instead, went in for early sowing of chana towards the end of October. With harvesting going on at full swing, the not-so-great price outlook for the legume is a major worry.  At the Latur APMC, traders identify two main reasons for the current weak sentiment.  The first is imports. Since March 2018, the Narendra Modi government has clamped a 60% import duty on chana, while pegging it lower, at 40%, for the larger kabuli or garbanzo bean varieties. Earlier to that, it imposed a 50% customs duty on white/yellow peas (which are a cheap substitute for chana and even used for adulteration of besan flour made from the latter) in November 2017 and 30% on masur (lentil) in December 2017. Further, imports of tur/arhar (pigeon-pea), moong (green gram) and urad (black gram) were, in August 2017, moved from the free to the restricted list, subject to annual quantitative caps. These measures have helped stem the flow of imports from their 2016-17 and 2017-18 peaks. The current fiscal has, nevertheless, witnessed an increase, particularly of masur and chana imports (see accompanying table). Both happen to be rabi pulses crops. Masur and white/yellow peas are imported mainly from Canada, while chana is mostly supplied by Australia, tur/arhar by Myanmar, Mozambique and Tanzania, and moong and urad by Myanmar.  A second reason is the huge unsold stock of chana lying with the government from last years MSP-procured crop. The National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India (Nafed) was, as on February 17, holding 21.03 lakh tonnes (lt) of pulses in its godowns, of which chana alone comprised 15.83 lt. According to Nitin Kalantari, a leading Latur-based dal miller and pulses trader, Nafeds stocks alone are weighing down prices in the mandis. They should have offloaded this grain during the Dussehra and Diwali season, when demand for besan (used in many sweet preparations) is high. Nafed is now floating tenders to sell, right at the start of the new crops arrivals. How can prices, then, look up?, he notes.  At the Takali Bardpur procurement centre, Vilas Uphade, director of Vikas Agro, is having a tough time convincing all growers not to come with their crop now. The farmer producer company  part of the MAHA-FPC, a state-wide consortium of producer organisations/companies that is a sub-agent of Nafed for undertaking MSP procurement operations  began purchase of tur/arhar on February 18. Tur (which is harvested in December-January) is also selling at Rs 4,900 per quintal (below the MSP of Rs 5,800), but our real concern is chana. Not only is the crop much bigger this year, but many farmers have not done any kharif sowing and gone directly for chana. They need a good price for what is clearly a bumper crop, explains Uphade.  Severe water scarcity last year led Ali Mohammed Sheikh to skip his chana crop in 2018-19. The delayed onset of monsoon this time meant that he couldnt also plant the 2019 kharif soyabean. But the monsoons magic revival from August enabled this 10-acre farmer from Takali Bardpur to go for chana on eight out of his 10-acre holding. If the government procurement centres are not opened in time, I may have to settle for a price of Rs 3,500 or even lower, sighs Sheikh, who also grows sugarcane and wheat on one acre each of his balance land that has irrigation facility.",GREEN GRAM DAL (MOONG DAL)

We are moving towards good health. We dont want our children to eat restaurant food every day. The mobile and web-based app, currently active in Chennai, Coimbatore and Tiruchi, allows customers to order home-cooked food.  The options are plenty. From an all vegetarian meal of kootu and poriyal or to a simple simple fish curry and rice, one can pick and choose from a menu put up by home cooks on the app. We call them fooddoo moms. We have 4000 moms registered with us. Of this, 600 are active, says Saurav. There is also a Jain Food option, food with less oil, no garam masala and so on, he explains  Saurav touches upon how nuclear families, where single moms or both parents are at work, find it a a big challenge to cook and consume healthy meals. Unhealthy eating habits are a big factor in lifestyle illnesses. We want to bring about a change in the way food is prepared and delivered.  The fooddoo team picks home makers who enjoy cooking. They can stay at home and generate income by doing something they are good at. Says a fooddoo mom based out of Chennai, I finish cooking the lunch orders by noon. This suits me, as my child is away at school during those hours. As I take care of my child and manage my home, stepping out to deliver the meals is not an option for me. I get regular orders for my vegetarian meals and breakfast items like wheat dosa, red rice puttu, godhuma upma, rotis and parathas. A delivery executive picks up the prepared meal from home. The moms have the option of switching off the app when they are unable to take orders.  Info you can use Orders for breakfast, lunch and dinner can be placed on the mobile app or on the website. A weekly/monthly subscription option is available  Fooddoo will soon extend its services to Erode, Madurai and Pudukottai  Fooddoo app is available on Android and iOS platform. It also takes orders via voice call at 9445502121  The cost of a standard meal is 100  Once a customer places an order with a fooddoo mom, the order reaches her dashboard. She then confirms the order and prepares the food. Once the food is ready, it is picked up and the customer can track the status  from order confirmation to delivery. Our network of delivery boys are trained to check consistency, quantity and quality, and also help with packing. Thats why our tagline reads  moms prepare, friends deliver. We deliver food in biodegradable boxes.  There is a seven-step quality and verification to validate the home cooks and their kitchens, points out K Shanmugasundaram, founder of Fooddoo.com. adding that fooddoo kitchens are FSSAI certified. We also make surprise visits to their kitchens. The tech-driven company is motivating the moms further.  Saurav Mukherjee and K. Shanmugasundaram | Photo Credit: Special Arrangement  There is robust technology in place and now we can scale up at will. We are currently delivering 200 meals in Chennai, says Saurav who reels out the top sellers. The vegetarian and non-vegetarian meals, lemon, coconut and tomata rice, rotis and gravies do very well. Some of the app users also buy festival palakaaram from the moms.  The next big plan is to get funding and scale up. We have the capacity to service 40,000 meals a day. We have sensitised the cooks to make diabetic-friendly food with millets, cater to specific diets such as the paleo, low carb-high fat, high protein and so on. Children who are settled abroad subscribe to us to cater food to their aged parents.   Another mom who has been a fooddoo mom for three years says she loves experimenting. Besides South Indian food, I also make teplas now and specialise in moong dal halwa, milk cake (which I learnt from my mother-in-law) and my own recipes like thinai paayasam. As my children are grown-up, I have plenty of time now. I order vegetables and provisions based on requirements. There has been no negative comments so far.

The newly opened restaurant at the Garvi Gujarat Bhavan boasts a comprehensive representation of the traditional cuisines of the coastal state, from breakfast to dinner and including Farsaan from 4.00 pm-7.00 pm.    Meaning Grandmothers Kitchen, Ba Ni Rasoi is run under the auspices of Gateway Hospitality, which also operates the Veda chain of fine-dining restaurants, among others.  With separate menus for the different meals of the day as well as the aforementioned snack time, the vegetarian-only restaurant has a la carte as well as full thalis, with the dishes regularly changing to reflect the passing of seasons. And yes, there is Fafda as well as Dhokla, though what you think the latter is, is probably actually Khaman.  What the Gujaratis actually call Dhokla comes in both white and yellow shades, and has a far denser and firmer texture than Khaman the soft, sweet and tangy gram-flour cake that has the fluffy moisture of a monsoon cloud. Other items that are part of the Farsaan include crisp Methi Na Gota (small freshly fried fritters made by combining fenugreek leaves and gram-flour) as well as freshly fried Dal and Batata Vada (split green gram and potato dumplings respectively). These Gujarati staples are prepared from scratch daily, and are worth the wait, which itself is minimal, with polite and attentive servers, ready with serving dishes and ladles, whisking between the spread-out tables and replenishing whichever item you find yourself desiring.  We are then introduced to a seasonal Kathol, Gujarati coddling of seasonal pulses and beans which goes swimmingly with the toasty warm Methi ka Thepla and various other breads. Theres also the characteristically bright red Rasawala Batata, a prettily piquant potato curry that no self-respecting Gujarati repast would be complete without. And naturally, that brings us to that most contentious item, the Gujarati Dal. Full disclosure: Ive never actually tried this divisive dish because the idea of a sweet dal sounds somehow aberrant. After actually tasting it, I dont see what the fuss is about since the sweetness is more suggestive than obvious, a smoky caramel-like after-taste rather than the cloying chimeric monstrosity its detractors claim it to be. Hell, I even have a second portion, its that good.

For us, winters always meant two things  mas to die for peas kachori and khejurer gur. From sweets made on Makar Sankranti to the thick, creamy payesh and the everyday comfort food of doodh-bhaat (milk and rice), khejurer gur nudged and pushed white sugar out of business and elevated the mundane. I would break pieces of the soft, deep caramel gur and put it on my tongue and savour the complex sweetness slowly spreading in my mouth. It was like a small piece of sweet warmth. I still think this is the best way to eat it. Ma had trusted sources who would procure and deliver to her good quality khejurer gur from Bengal to Assam, the softer ones for immediate use and the harder roundels to last through the year, safely tucked in airtight containers inside the refrigerator. My sister and I inherited this trait and we fulfil it every year like a family ritual.  Khejurer gur or date palm jaggery, that highly prized seasonal produce, occupies a place of pride in Bengals already accomplished sweet-making history. As far back as the 4th century BC, Panini wrote, Gurasha auang desho goura, which means Gour is the place of gur. It is, however, difficult to know exactly when khejurer gur became popular in Bengal. Some early references can be found from the history of Joynogorer moa. The old Pundra Bardhan in undivided Bengal, now Bogra in Bangladesh, became known as Gour for its high-quality gur produced from sugarcane. At that time, Mitraganj was a famous market in Joynagar, which is now in Bengals South 24 Parganas district. A weekly market or haat was held on Mondays and Fridays in that village where people from different villages came to sell gur. The fine quality of the date palm jaggery sold in this haat is orally documented in the Piruli song of Farid Pir and also in the folk poems of Dakshin Kalikapur village. The reason why a more formal, Sanskritised documentation of the origin of khejurer gur is unavailable is because the Siulis  the artisans  belonged to the lower castes.  Nomadic artisans  Amir Sheikh and his younger brother shift home from Nadia to Adityapur village in Burdawan district for three to four months every winter. This means staying in makeshift huts, away from their families and creature comforts. A few kilometres away, near the Kopai river in Bolpur, Sabir stays with his family of four, including two infants. These families are all seasonal nomads, Siulis, who specialise in tapping the sap of the date palm tree and making khejurer gur.  The Siulis mostly belong to Scheduled Castes or Tribes, or to the Mahishya and Muslim community, and they are spread across the four-five major gur producing districts of Bengal  Nadia, North and South 24 Parganas, Murshidabad and Malda. While the demand for khejurer gur has steadily increased over the years, nobody really knows much about its unique and climate-sensitive production or about the community that produces it. In the absence of this connect, the Siulis, the men who scale the thorny trees to collect the sap, are almost never acknowledged.  Obtaining the sap requires skill. The tapping is generally done at night, with an intervening period of rest for the tree. The Siulis climb the tree at dusk, cut the end of the inflorescence (flower cluster), and hang an earthen container from it, leaving it overnight to catch the dripping sap. The tree cannot be tapped if the weather is foggy, drizzly or warm, as the sap will become turbid and sour. Its this that makes the gur so sensitive to climatic conditions. The fresh sap of the wild date palm is sweet, fragrant and as clear as drinking water. Rich in vitamins and iron and with 12-15% sugar, it is a delicious thirst quencher.  However, it ferments quickly along with the rising sun to turn into the alcoholic tari, so the Siulis start work before the crack of dawn. The pots are brought down from the trees and the collected sap is filtered and poured into open troughs. This juice is then put to boil till the Brix value reaches 118-120%, a calculation that experienced Siulis like Amir make just by sight and touch alone, without any modern instruments.  Many varieties  Date palm jaggery can be eaten as nolen gur  the softer, golden coloured gur, named after the nol, or the pipe that is used to collect the sap, and from nolen meaning new. Or as jhola gur, the viscous liquid gur made by reducing the sap but stopping short of crystallisation.  Jhola comes from the Bengali word for hanging  the way the pots are hung. Jhola gur has low shelf life but high aroma, and is used to make the famous Joynagarer moa. Then there is poyra gur, from the word poila or first, for the gur made from the first sap of the season. This is believed to be the best variety because of the elongated period of rest that the tree gets.  The jhola gur made from the first sap is called jiren jhola gur  jiren being the word for resting. The jiren gur is almost translucent. The sap is reduced further on low heat and poured into terracotta moulds to yield the solidified patali, which has the highest shelf life of about eight months but is the most compromised on flavour.  Khejurer gur has now became a part of fine dining and has inspired several refined sweets, but the first jhola gur each season still evokes memories of a winter special Bengali breakfast of luchi and jhola gur. Or, as the famous poet Sukumar Ray recalled, kintu shobar chaite bhalo, pauruti aar jhola gur  the best of all is bread with jhola gur.  SUNDAY RECIPE  Jhola gur diye moong-narkoler ichhamura  (Sweet croquettes of moongbeans-coconut served with jhola gur)  This is a take on the Bengali pithe ichhamura, which gets its name from the oblong shape that apparently resembles a prawn head.  Ingredients  1 1/2 cup jhola gur  Refined oil for deep frying  For dough:  150 gms shredded coconut  75 gms moong daal  200 gms sugar  50 gms kheer/ khoya  2 inches cinnamon  1/4 cup water  1 tbsp ghee  2-3 tbsp maida  Method  1. Take sugar and water in a kadhai and put on medium heat. Let it come to a boil. Add the coconut, mix on low flame for five minutes and add khoa. Keep stirring till it becomes sticky and coconut is glossy. Remove from fire, transfer to another container and let it cool a bit till you can handle the mix.  2. Roast the moong daal in ghee, add cinnamon and boil in just enough water so that the daal is cooked and the water is absorbed. Remove half the cinnamon stick, cool, and make a smooth paste in a blender. Prep the daal mix before the coconut.  3. Mix the moong daal, coconut and maida together and form a smooth dough.  4. Take a tbsp of the mix and mould into inch-long oblong croquettes. Deep fry till golden brown in hot refined oil.  5. Heat the jhola gur in a pan and put the ichhamura right after draining the oil into the jhola gur. Soak for a while and serve, with spoonfuls of jhola gur drizzled on top.  Note: Drop a little dough into the oil and check if you need more maida to bind. Do not add much as it will ruin the taste. Do not fry in piping hot oil as it will brown the outside too quickly and blister it too.

(Representational Image) The aggregate picture that emerged was simple: Pulses consumption in India is showing signs of flattening. (Representational Image)  Is there stagnation in demand for pulses, milk and other protein-rich foods in India? The National Statistical Office (NSO) withheld its household consumption expenditure survey report for 2017-18 but alternative data sources do suggest a slowdown  at least in respect of the ubiquitous dal and doodh.  At a global Pulses Conclave held earlier this month in Pune, the overwhelming concern expressed by participants was: Why are we not eating enough pulses?  One of the presentations at the event was a detailed analysis of the estimated consumption of individual pulses  chana (chickpea), yellow peas, masur (red lentil), arhar (pigeon-pea), moong (green gram) and urad (black gram)  based on year-wise opening stocks plus domestic production and imports, and deducting exports, diversion towards seed and feed, and closing stocks.  The aggregate picture that emerged was simple: Pulses consumption in India is showing signs of flattening.  Between 2013-14 and 2017-18, it rose from 18.6 million tonnes (mt) to 22.5 mt, but fell to 22.1 mt in 2018-19 and is projected to further decline to 20.7 mt this year. Some of that may be attributable to prices. Thus, 2015-16 and 2016-17 recorded a consumption drop alongside double-digit dal inflation. The peak consumption in 2017-18 was when prices actually dipped 20.8 per cent year-on-year. The link between consumption and inflation, however, breaks down from 2018-19 (see table).  Saurabh Bhartia of the Indian Pulses and Grains Association (IPGA)  the apex organisation of dal millers, traders, exporters and importers that drew up the estimates  is convinced that the apparent demand slowdown is real.  We need a National Egg Coordination Committee-like body for pulses to push consumption. The campaign they launched in the 1980s helped in positioning egg as a wholesome nutrition food. The time has come for a similar sustained drive promoting pulses as an excellent source of protein, micronutrients and fibre that is also low-fat and cholesterol-free, he says.  Nitin Kalantri, a leading dal trader and processor from Latur in Maharashtra, traces the low growth in pulses consumption to 2015-16, when retail prices of arhar dal breached the Rs 200/kg level.  EXPLAINED Linked to income With rising income, the consumption of milk, pulses, eggs and meat had increased, especially among the poor. Flattening demand growth for protein-rich foods suggests incomes arent rising as before. But whether consumption is actually slowing will be known only from the next NSO household survey.  From then, somehow a perception gained ground that pulses are expensive. Around the same time, vegetables also turned relatively cheap and consumers started having more of them in place of dal. 2017-18 was a one-off year when consumption rose on the back of a price crash, but the memories of Rs 200/kg havent gone from peoples minds, he points out.  Agreeing with Bhartia, Kalantri says: Egg has benefitted from branding, which is lacking in pulses. Moreover, you can eat it by simply boiling, unlike dal that requires seasoning and making chhonk (tempering).  But it isnt pulses alone. Data from successive annual reports of the National Dairy Development Board shows that total liquid milk marketing by cooperatives  they account for the bulk of sales in this segment  has gone up from 201.03 lakh litres per day (LLPD) in 2008-09 to 294.44 LLPD in 2013-14. In 2018-19, this figure reached just 354.53 LLPD.  ALSO READ | Pulses farmers are set to harvest a record chana crop, but their party could be spoiled by imports  In other words, a compound annual growth rate (CAGR), amounting to 7.9 per cent during 2008-09 to 2013-14, has plunged to 3.8 per cent in the last five years.  What makes this trend particularly striking  even the absolute increase in milk sales from 2013-14 to 2018-19 (60.09 LLPD) was hardly two-thirds of the earlier five years (93.41 LLPD)  is that it has occurred despite lower inflation. Between 2008-09 and 2013-14, prices of full-cream milk (containing 6 per cent fat and 9 per cent solids-not-fat) in Delhi rose from about Rs 24 to Rs 46 per litre. In the subsequent five years till March 2019, the jump was only to Rs 52 per litre.  Equally interesting is that the deceleration in milk sales has taken place when Indias production went up from 137.7 mt in 2013-14 to 187.7 mt in 2018-19, according to Department of Animal Husbandry & Dairying (DAHD) statistics. That translated into a CAGR of 6.4 per cent, as against 4.2 per cent for the five years from 2008-09, when the estimated output was 112.2 mt.  Veteran agriculture economist Ashok Gulati feels the stagnant consumption trend in both milk and pulses is largely due to incomes, which arent rising as before. This is especially for the poorer sections, whose spending on protein-rich superior foods tends to increase even more with higher incomes.  The best indicator here is rural wages. The average annual growth of wages in rural India during 2014-15 to 2018-19 was only 5.3 per cent in nominal terms and 0.6 per cent after adjusting for consumer inflation of 4.7 per cent. In the preceding five-year period, nominal rural wage growth averaged 17.6 per cent and 6.8 per cent annually in real terms.  A better idea of whats happening to demand can, perhaps, be obtained only from the NSOs next household consumption expenditure survey from July 2020 to June 2021.  The last published report for 2011-12 had revealed daily per capita consumption of milk and dairy products to have risen since 2004-05 more sharply in rural (from 128.87 ml to 144.43 ml) than in urban India (170.23 ml to 180.73 ml).  Significantly, these survey-based consumption figures were way below the DAHDs per capita daily milk availability estimate of 290 gram (282 ml) for 2011-12, which went up to 394 gram (383 ml) in 2018-19. Whether the gap between the DAHDs production and NSOs consumption numbers has further widened will be known only after the latters next survey.  For now, whats clear is this: Food has become more affordable in the last five years, as the Finance Ministrys recent Economic Survey chapter on Thalinomics has shown. But whether Indians are consuming more, as a result, isnt clear.",GREEN GRAM DAL (MOONG DAL)

Speaking to mediapersons in the Secretariat, he said Chief Minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy had given instructions to further increase the number of procurement centres in case of high yield to purchase foodgrains from farmers at support price.  The government had set up 109 procurement centres for black gram, 101 centres for bengal gram, 98 centres for red gram, 67 centres for green gram and 26 centres for turmeric.  The government is aware of plight of tomato growers in Chittoor, Anantapur and Kadapa due to lack of remunerative price for their produce. Steps would be taken to ensure remunerative price for tomato and onion, he said.  Civil Supplies Commissioner Kona Sasidhar said that the government set up 1,820 paddy procurement centres in the State to see that farmers do not face any hassles in selling their produce at support price.  The government has so far procured 44 lakh metric tonnes of paddy in Kharif marketing season.  The farmers are receiving spot payment in most of the case and in some cases there is a slight delay due to clearance of dues by the Centre. The matter was taken to the notice of Union Civil supplies Minister, he said.  Sasidhar said the second and third quarter funds are due to the State government. That is the reason for the delay in making payments over the past two weeks.  Chief Minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy held a high-level review meeting in this regard and directed the Civil Supplies Department to take advances from banks and Nabard to clear the dues of the farmers, he said.  Stating that the dues to farmers will be cleared by Wednesday, he said it was not fair on the part of a section of the media to blow up the issue.

Greeted at the door by a smiling Shanthi, youre instantly engulfed by the feeling of a home. Her yoga session is done, the lunch table is set and while she waits for her husband to arrive, we sit down for a quick conversation. Married at the age of 15, you could say that Shanthis tryst with cooking began quite early. Away from her friends and family, she turned to food under the strict eye and guidance of her mother-in-law.  Shanthi Sekar  Ashwin Prasath  She admits that it was quite a leap  a leap from not knowing the difference between moong and toor dal when she was at her mothers place, into the bottomless cauldron of punchy flavours and succulent meats that is authentic Mudaliar cuisine. A community of cooking that doesnt boast of the popularity of Chettinad flavours or the reviving trend of Kongu flavours, Mudaliar style of cooking is distinct in its rich repast of seafood and poultry. My father and my husband are both seafood aficionados and I grew up eating non-vegetarian food almost daily.  They used to head out to the fish markets near Marina Beach early every morning and bring kilos of fish and prawns back home. Fresh meat is the key that defines our cooking, asserts Shanthi. Sura puttu  a stir-fry of minced shark meat mixed with a medley of spices  prawns masala vadai kozhambu, prawns poriyal, kola urundai and appalam kootu  a Mudaliar favourite made out of old papads  are some of the traditional Mudaliar dishes that are now a part of Shanthis repertoire, passed on to her from her mother-in-law. But the nethili kozhambu is the absolute crowd-pleaser.  Experimental attitude  The cornucopia of other ingredients that makes the hidden cuisine sing? Garlic, ginger, curry leaves, pepper, a restrained splash of oil and a pinch of Shanthis homemade masala powder. Ive always ground my own masala powder that I use in most of my dishes. Now I even grind up curry leaves into a powder so that my daughter and grandson eat it without picking it out, says Shanthi. Her experimental attitude to cooking also resulted in a vegan twist to the much-beloved Mudaliar classic aatu kaal paaya (Sheep Trotters curry) with mushroom substituting the protein. Debuting the dish as the main course in her six-course dinner with Chefathon, it was an absolute winner, with requests to recreate it at other events as well.  Muscle memory  A culinary journey of over 30 years, Shanthi admits to never writing down recipes now that it has almost become muscle memory. Often sharing the kitchen space with her daughter, it has also become a bonding activity between mother and daughter. I began enjoying cooking only when I began catering to several people as part of my daughters birthday parties. The smiles on satisfied faces is why I enjoy cooking, reminisces Shanthi. The more, the merrier, she adds. Just as we wrap up, her husband, whom she calls her biggest critic, walks in for lunch. A simple lunch table set with sambar, sura puttu and a few poriyals await, and I take my leave.

There would be lower imports next year also because traders might not be able to buy from overseas market, taking advantage of loopholes in the import quota order, which the Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) is contesting in the Jaipur High Court to tighten it, Indian Pulses and Grains Association (IGPA) Chairman Jitu Bheda told reporters.  ""Total imports are expected to reach 2.5 million tonne in the current year, of which about 1.5 million tonne has been done, taking stay from Chennai and Jaipur High Courts on the DGFT quota order and much of it is yellow peas, black mapte (urad) and green peas,"" Bheda said on the sidelines of 5th edition of Pulses Conclave 2020.  The rest one million tonne has been imported as per the government's quota this year, he added.  The government has imposed a quantitative restriction on import of key pulses especially yellow peas, pigeon peas (tur), chickpeas (chana) and green gram (moong) to protect local farmers amid steady increase in domestic production to 23.40 million tonne in the 2018-19 crop year (July-June).  Light Speckled bean (rajmah) and blackeye beans (lobiya) are allowed to import without restrictions.  India is the world's largest consumer of pulses. ""Assuming the government continues with current quota system and considering higher domestic crop and buffer stock, maximum 1 million tonnes of pulses can be imported next year and mostly rajmah and lobiya,"" Bheda said.  He also said the government may increase quota on import of black mapte and green gram as the domestic shortage is still about 1.5 million tonne and 1 million tonne, respectively.  At present, the import quota on black mapte is 2,50,000 tonne and green gram is 1,50,000 tonne.  ""We have to import these two pulses as domestic prices are ruling higher than the minimum support price, which may put pressure on retail rates,"" Bheda added.  The IPGA chairman said the industry body has requested the government to extend the current quota on black mapte for two months till May as the crop is yet to be harvested in Myanmar, the only supplier of this commodity in the world.  There is no issue with regard to import of green gram as it is grown in many countries, including Africa, he added.  On illegal imports from Nepal, the industry body said the government should curb such shipments, taking advantage of softening of global rates of pulses following India restricting imports.  The government is targeting a record production of pulses at 26.30 million tonne in the ongoing 2019-20 crop year, of which 16.20 million tonne from the Rabi season and the rest from Kharif season.  At present, Kharif crop is being harvested, while Rabi crop prospects especially chickpeas (chan) seem to be bright, Bheda said.  There is a buffer stock of 3.4 million tonne of pulses at present in the country, according to cooperative Nafed, which has procured on behalf of the government to ensure minimum support price (MSP) to farmers.  Nafed Additional Managing Director S K Singh said the cooperative will continue procurement in the current year as well.  It plans to buy more of chickpeas from Rabi crop as prices are already below the MSP on expectation of bumper production.",GREEN GRAM DAL (MOONG DAL)

This was slightly higher than the target of 93,694 ha for 2019-20 Rabi season.  Recently, the State Government removed restrictions on sale of fertilizers and pesticides by registered dealers to meet the demands of farmers. Chief district agriculture officer Laxmi Narayan Dash said farming and allied activities are going on smoothly as the sector has been exempted from the lockdown. Farmers are freely carrying out farming activities and also taking their harvested crops to markets. Sources said, vegetables crops are being harvested and sent to markets.

(Representational Image) Ursals association had suspended operations in the mandi on March 23 as coronavirus cases started rising in Pune. (Representational Image)  The central government may have exempted movement of food  and also all operations in farms and agriculture produce market committee (APMC) mandis  from the provisions of the nationwide lockdown to ensure uninterrupted harvesting and marketing of crops.  But theres a new problem springing up  shortage of labour in mandis. This market has 6,000 hammal (loaders) and tolai (weighmen). Almost 60 per cent of them are from Marathwada or rural Pune and they left just before the Janata Curfew on March 22. How will they return now, when all transport services are suspended till mid-April? asks Rohan Ursal, a leading fruit trader and secretary of the commission agents association at the APMC in Pune city.  Ursals association had suspended operations in the mandi on March 23 as coronavirus cases started rising in Pune. On March 27, the association decided to restart auctions at the market yard from April 1. However, Ursal is sceptical when that can happen  How will this market work without labourers?.  This isnt an isolated case.  The dal mill of Kalantry Food Products outside Latur city has not been open for at least a week. Most of our 200 workers are from Bihar and Chhattisgarh. They went on March 21, the day before the Janata Curfew. Getting them back is out of the question now, says Nitin Kalantri, CEO of the company, one of Indias biggest pulses miller and trader.  Latur in Maharashtras Marathwada region has 100 mills that process tur (pigeon-pea), chana (chickpea), moong (green gram) and masur (red lentils). More than 80 per cent of their 2,500 labourers are from Bihar and other states. They managed to take the last trains home before the lockdown  unlike the lakhs of stranded migrant workers who had to trek long distances from Delhi and neighbouring industrial areas.  Kalantri claims that the images of what these workers have gone through and the fear of this lockdown not being the last have further fueled the insecurity among the few remaining labourers This, despite the Latur Municipal Corporation arranging food and temporary accommodation for them in schools.  At the Latur APMC  a major wholesale market for pulses and soyabean  the last auctions took place on March 20, which was a Friday. The majority of our 6,000-odd labourers are from Bihar and Chhattisgarh. They have all gone and cannot return even if they want to. How can we run this market with a skeletal staff? says an APMC official.  This situation  wherein trade and movement in food produce has been technically allowed but there is no labour available in mandis to unload, clean, weight and reload grain  isnt specific to Maharashtra. According to Pavan Toshniwal, a dal trader at Karnatakas Gulbarga mandi, 90 per cent of the APMCs roughly 2,000 labourers have gone. They are all again from Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and Chhattisgarh. The exodus actually began after March 13, when the first coronavirus-related death was reported from Gulbarga. The 300 or so dal mills in and around Gulbarga have also stopped running due to non-availability of labour.  Yogesh Agarwal, a dal miller and trader from Indore in Madhya Pradesh, says only 30 of the regions 230 mills are currently running. Even if farmers bring their chana or tur crop today, the APMC here will not be able to function as almost all the 1,000-plus labourers in the mandi have left for their home states of Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Bihar, he states.  If marketing of the new rabi crop is going to be an issue, no less a roadblock is transportation of the produce to consuming centres, particularly in distant areas. On paper, goods-carrying vehicles are allowed and it is possible that even the current hold-ups at state borders will go. But how many truck drivers would be willing to do long hauls when there are no roadside restaurants or dhabas? And what if their vehicle breaks down? notes Kalantri.  The roadblocks, millers and traders believe, may squeeze the supply chain for agri produce in the days to come.  Also, for the first time, the importance of a vital link in this chain  the migrant labourer  is beginning to be felt.",GREEN GRAM DAL (MOONG DAL)

Action is yet to be taken against the shopkeepers, but the top cop has warned that anyone found indulging in black marketing would be arrested on the spot.  Gurugram commissioner of police Muhammad Akil said FIRs were lodged on Tuesday under Prevention of Black Marketing and Maintenance of Supplies of Essential Commodities Act-1980, based on the complaints of residents and daily wagers from Sushant Lok-1, Sector 31 and Sector 40. If convicted, a person may face jail of 6 months under the Act.  We had warned shopkeepers to not sell essential commodities at more than the MRP. Despite regular supply from wholesalers, they were found selling goods at a mark-up and refusing to sell goods to those who questioned their malpractice, Akil said.  Akil said they formed four teams on Tuesday and they were given the task to keep a check on shopkeepers indulging in malpractices and to send decoy customers to get ground report from markets across the city.  Reports of black marketing are becoming increasingly common in Gurugram as packaged dry ration has run out and these items are now being sold by the kilogram. Unlike packaged ration, these packets do not have prices, allowing the shopkeepers to charge as they please. There are also reports of suppliers increasing prices of mineral water.  However, like residents, shopkeepers, too, are crying foul saying that they were also being fleeced by wholesalers because the demand has increased. Due to the high demand of groceries and snacks, we have no choice but to agree to their (wholesalers) price quotation. Even the demand for tobacco and cigarettes has increased. Earlier, a packet of cigarettes which used to cost 350 is costing us 500, so we sell it for 600, Sector 40 shopkeeper Suresh Thakran said.  Warning against such practices, the police reiterated that all shopkeepers must display a rate list outside the shop, and that they would be booked if selling above MRP.  On March 25, the district food civil supplies and consumer affairs controller issued a release stating the price list of essential items. The prices of goods per kilogram are 25 for loose flour and parmal rice, 36 for sugar and 20 for salt. Prices for pulses per kilogram are 90 for urad dal, 95 for moong dal, 57 for chana dal and 80 for tur dal.  Akil said they have ordered all shopkeepers to paste a rate list of grocery items outside the shop and mention the number of local police station. Anyone found indulging in any illegal activity will now be arrested on the spot, he said.  We will take stern action against people who are taking benefit out of the crisis that has increased peoples dependence on local shopkeepers for essential goods, he said.",GREEN GRAM DAL (MOONG DAL)

Workers are looking for more opportunities to work in fields of their respective villages or those nearby. Their representatives, however, have raised concerns about guaranteeing their health and welfare while working in the fields as the coronavirus tally keeps increasing.  Farm labourers have to toil more than others. They need to work to earn their daily bread but also have chances of becoming ill if they come in contact with machinery, shovels, crowbars, basins or vehicles like mini-trucks, and tractor-trailers, as they travel in groups. It is hard to find protective gear in rural areas. Workers like them need an insurance scheme for this virus so they can get treatment or in case they die, said SC Ganapathi, a farm labourer representative.  Thousands of farm workers are unable to avail protective masks and sanitisers, even though they have been declared essential commodities. Men and women turn up at work with handkerchiefs or pieces of cloth in place of a mask. These are reused and not often washed. They can only wash their hands and maintain social distancing at work. There is already the Chief Ministers Comprehensive Health Insurance Scheme and Prime Ministers Insurance Scheme. But are they sufficient or updated to insure the health of everyone against a disease like coronavirus which can spread through community transmission? There is already a lack of awareness at the rural level. Farm workers and other labourers need to be covered and insured, said V Ramalingam, a Thamizh Maanila Vivasaya Thozhilaar Sangam leader.  Farmers across delta districts are presently cultivating pulses such as urad and mung beans. They are also cultivating crops like cotton and groundnut. Some are doing summer paddy cultivation in places like Thalaignayiru in Nagapattinam district. Farm workers are engaged in transplantation of saplings, spraying pesticides, weeding, reaping, threshing collection and packing.

This season, he is collecting seeds of the white egg brinjal, green egg brinjal, blood red corn, apple pumpkin and Japanese white cucumber. Known for collecting seeds from remote regions across the globe, Rao, a geneticist, tests them for various factors before preserving them. Among his collection, the Bangladeshi brinjal, Poona kakadi, Magadi tomato, Moldavian balm and white okra top the list of endangered heirloom seeds. Retailed by hariyaleeseeds.com  Annadana in Bengaluru  Sangita Sharma firmly believes that if a country is seed secure, it will be food secure. For the last 19 years, her seed bank has conserved over a 1,000 crop varieties. At present, the team is busy saving vegetable seeds from brinjals and beans to groundnuts, tomatoes, and various fruits. Sharmas food forest model  integrating herbs, medicinal plants and vegetables with other crops like corn, etc.  is now being adopted by farmers across the country to help them earn a monthly income.

Since December 2018, they have been selling close to 100 varieties of certified organic seeds online. We procure food crop seeds from local tribal farmers and seed banks and have been saving them every season. For the dry land rice, we looked for seed savers in local tribal villages three years ago and managed to find a lone seed saver there who was kind enough to share a few seeds with us. We have had many people approach us for them and we pass them on only on the condition that they double them and share it among the community. It is something close to our hearts, and instances like these have proved that someone has to save seeds or else they will be lost over time, says Rudraraju, adding that apart from the 50 varieties of vegetable, herb and flower seeds, they are also saving field crops such as wheat, red rice, millets, and root crops like turmeric and ginger this season.",GREEN GRAM DAL (MOONG DAL)

Dark green with lovely pink flowers, hog weed is a common creeper in many backyards in the State. Until her mother, Padma Menon, made it into a thoran, Anjali P had no clue that it was edible or that it was thazhuthama, a plant with medicinal properties.  The quarantine and lockdown in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic have unearthed many such nutrient-rich greens growing wild in many of our houses. Social media is flush with snaps of people coming up with jugaad recipes made of what is available around the house. The other day, I ate thoran made with sambar cheera (Ceylon spinach). Pulinkari with chembu thaal or the stem of colocasia, was another revelation ,  says Anjali, a college-goer in Thiruvananthapuram.  Those lucky to have some greenery around their house have turned to the bounty of leaves and vegetables that were either forgotten, ignored or rarely used in the menu. Spinach varieties, yams, tubers, papaya, plantain, seasonal fruits such as jackfruit and mangooptions are aplenty.  It has become an early morning routine for me to collect fresh vegetables and leaves from my compound. We have drumstick, jackfruit, mango, red amaranthus, bilimbi., says Nisha P, a voice-over artiste from Thrissur. Drumstick leaves are used to make thoran and drumsticks in the curry with raw mango and jackfruit seeds; amaranthus is for thoran or aviyal. Other than seasonal fruits, I never used to depend so much on home-grown produce My daughters, who enjoy experimenting with veggies, especially cauliflower, are now getting used to the new menu, adds Nisha. A food blogger as well, Nisha adds that she successfully made a curry with petals of hibiscus flowers in her garden!  Kozhuppa cheera | Photo Credit: Special arrangement  There is a huge variety of leafy greens that Kerala has that can be turned into flavourful thorans or mixed into your chappathi or dosa dough. Besides the common red and green amaranthus, there is sambar cheera, kozhuppa cheera (pigweed), Mysore cheera, madhura cheera (sweet leaf), valli cheera (Malabar spinach) and the like. I prepare thoran using tender leaves of colocasia as well, says Geetha Menon, a homemaker from Tripunithura.  The multi-purpose banana plant gives raw banana, banana stem (vazhappindi) and banana inflorescence (vazhakkoombu), which are used to prepare a multitude of dishes, all of which taste different . What is more, many of these dishes dont need onion for gravy or masala. Then there is raw papaya that can be steamed, stir fried or cooked with green gram to prepare erissery.  Jack of all fruits  It is the jackfruit season. While idi chakka or the small, tender jackfruit makes delicious thoran, raw fruit is cooked to make puzhukku, thoran or aviyal. The seeds can go with any thoran or added to different curries or sauted in oil for the mezhukkuvaratti. Jackfruit rags and rind are also edible.  Parts of jackfruit are used to make different dishes | Photo Credit: Getty Images/iStockphoto  In fact, ever since we went on self-quarantine from March 8 after our son arrived from Japan, we have been living on the produce of our kitchen garden and the profusion of jackfruit on two trees in our yard. My mother told me how they used to dry the seed in the sun and then get it ground and use the flour as a thickening agent or in dosa dough. I dried it in the sun and made it into small pieces that I use in curries. For more than a month, we have been living on the produce from our eight-cent plot, explains Bindu Thomas, a space scientist who took voluntary retirement from ISRO.  Usha Soolapani, a resident of the capital city, shares on her Facebook page a recipe that her friend from Thrissur had given her. They collect leaves of pumpkin and cook it in an interesting way. Traditionally pumpkin leaves were cooked in rice gruel. She tried a gruel made of jackfruit seed flour. It was mixed with a paste of coconut, green chillies and cumin seeds. Then she fried mustard and curry leaves and put it in the curry. She said that its taste was exquisite. Even if we are living in an urban area, a single plant of pumpkin produces enough leaves for a family, writes Usha.  Leaf revolution E Sajeev Kumar, consultant scientist at KR Narayanan Centre for Biotechnology, Kottayam and senior scientist at Ayur Yuva Institute of Innovation for Science and Heritage (AYIISH) in Palakkad, has been conducting research on medicinal properties of plants that are considered as weeds or inedible. Improving our health is possible by including food that develops immunity, he says. He has published a book of recipes for cooking with different kinds of leaves. There are recipes for leaves of hibiscus, bitter gourd, tender jackfruit leaves, tender banana leaves and so on.  Some parents point out that the change in the menu is the need of the hour. Actor-writer Aaryan Ramani Girijavallabhan says that chicken was a must on the menu for his children. Choices are aplenty for todays generation and what they want is just a phone call away. But now it is vazhappindi, jackfruit seed and chembu thaal! We have a dish with raw banana almost everyday and my children have started liking it! says Aaryan.  But this shouldnt be a temporary habit, points out Sridhar Radhakrishnan, programme director, Thanal. This phase will pass. What matters is how much you have transformed your family. This is the right time to make your children understand what we have in nature. This should become a culture. Take them along to show the plants and slowly they will also be able to appreciate what we have in plenty in our surroundings, says Sridhar.  Recipe for Thazhuthama thoran  Ingredients:  Thazhuthama leaves- washed and chopped fine; Coconut - 1 cup grated; Green chillies 5-6; Small onion chopped - 1/4 cup; Mustard seeds - 1/4 tsp; Turmeric - 1/2 tsp; Oil - 2 tablespoons; Curry leaves; Salt to taste  Method:  Heat oil in a pan and splutter mustard seeds. Add chopped onions and stir for a minute. To this, add the leaves, turmeric powder, green chillies and salt. Stir well and cook for a minute. Mix grated coconut and stir again. Cover the pan and cook for at least five minutes. There is no need to add water. Open the lid in between and give it a stir or two. Garnish with curry leaves.",GREEN GRAM DAL (MOONG DAL)

The prices of popular dals such as moong (yellow petite lentils), chana ( chickpea ), masoor (red lentils) and tur ( pigeon pea ) in the wholesale market have surged in the range of 10-15%.  According to traders, the wholesale price of yellow moong dal has surged to Rs 114 from Rs 100 per kilogram, while green moong dal price has firmed up from around Rs 90 to Rs 105 per kg.  Availability of pulses in wholesale markets also an issue  The price of masoor has moved up from Rs 60 to Rs 70. Chana dal price has risen to Rs 60-61 from Rs 52-53 and that of tur have inched up to Rs 76-77 from Rs 72-72 per kg.  In retail market, prices of masoor and chana dals have crossed Rs 100 and currently being sold for Rs 100 to Rs 105 per kg. The prices of premium yellow moong dal has increased to Rs 150 from Rs 110 per kg, said Ketan Marwadi, a city-based retailer.  The main reasons for the spike in prices are supply chain disruption and increase in cost of transportation for procuring these pulses, Sureshbhai Korwani , committee member, Ahmedabad Grain Merchants Association , a body of local pulses and grains wholesalers in Ahmedabad.  Before lockdown, the cost of transporting pulses from Jalgaon in Maharashtra to Ahmedabad in Gujarat used to be Rs 120-130 per quintal. Recently, I had to cough up Rs 260 per quintal for the same, he added.  The availability of pulses in wholesale markets is also an issue. Even dal millers have raw material but they are complaining about the lack of manpower to process raw material to make dals, said another trader.  The prices will further increase as there is a supply shortage and even the wholesale dealers, mainly in Madhupura area of Ahmedabad, are not opening their shops, added Ketan Marwadi.

The OSSC is accepting only 20 quintal per ha from us. What we will do with the balance seeds, wondered Balasore farmer Basanta Barik.  More than 5,000 farmers of the State have registered with the corporation for supply of seeds both cereals and pulses. The OSSC is agreement-bound to accept the total production. The farmers will not get the price fixed by the Government for seeds if they sell the same in open market.  As per the agreement with the registered farmers, the corporation had decided to accept 30 quintal of paddy seed per ha. However, the officers looking after seed production at the district level are refusing to accept more than 20 quintal per ha per farmer. Similar is the situation in Ganjam and Bargarh districts where seed production is more.  Although we have registered our protest, the district authorities are unmoved. The seed production officer of the district said he is acting as per the instruction of the OSSC Managing Director. We do not know whom to approach in this lockdown period, said Ganesh Nayak, a registered seed grower of Sanakhemundi block of Ganjam district.  Reduction of 10 quintal of certified seeds per ha is a loss for farmers as the cost per quintal is Rs 2,305 against the normal paddy cost of Rs 1,815 under price support system.Barik further said the corporation has also reduced the cost of biri (black gram) from Rs 7,200 to Rs 6,800 per quintal and moong from Rs 9,000 to Rs 8,400 per quintal. While fixing the minimum support price of cereals, pulses and oil seeds, the Centre has asked the states to provide 27 per cent more than the MSP for paddy seeds and 30 per cent more for pulses.  While the State Government has increased the cost of paddy seeds to Rs 2,305 from Rs 2,187 per quintal, it has reduced the cost of moong and biri, Barik said.  Despite our protest, the corporation has enhanced the seed processing charges from Rs 15 to Rs 25 per quintal and imposed an additional cost of Rs 2 per labourer.

I only know of traditional pachadis. Do we even have salads? asks my mother-in-law when I take my query to her. To my surprise, I get the same response from Swaran Kumar when I ask her for a traditional Punjabi salad. But later she calls back to diffidently offer, theres kachumber. I dont know if that fits your requirements.  She also points out that this recipe has evolved. People now add bell peppers, raw mango, cabbage, carrots, all finely chopped or grated. As she talks, it occurs to me that nuts and seeds would also add some crunch and I make a mental note to try it out.  Punjabi Kachumber  Ingredients:  1 cucumber; 2 tomatoes ripe; 1 onion ; 1 tbsp coriander leaves; 1 green chilli; 1/2 black pepper powder; 1 tsp lemon juice; Salt to taste  Method: Chop all the veggies finely and mix. Add all the seasoning and toss to mix. Adjust salt according to taste and serve chilled.  My mother-in-law also tentatively suggests kosambari. While the traditional recipe uses only cucumber, a colleague uses cabbage and adds peanuts for what she calls the crunch factor.

Leave it to dry for a few minutes and then place in a bowl. Peel and chop the cucumber into tiny pieces. Add to moong dal along with coconut, green chillis and coriander leaves. Mix well.

Until a few years ago, she writes, this dish used to be a ubiquitous offering at haldi-kumkum parties that women hosted in the month of Chaitra (around March-April) when the raw mangoes come to the market.  Khairchi Dal  Ingredients:  1 1/2 cups channa dal soaked for 3-4 hours; 3/4 cup raw mangoes peeled and thinly grated; 1/2 fresh coconut scraped or grated; 1/4 fresh coriander finely chopped; 4tbsps oil; 1 green chilli; 6-8 saandgi mirchi; Salt to taste; 2tsp sugar (adjust according to mangos sourness)  Method: Drain the channa dal and place in blender along with the green chilli. Grind to a coarse paste without any extra water. Transfer into a mixing bowl. Add the grated raw mango, coconut, coriander, salt and sugar. Heat oil in a pan, add the saandgi mirchi and fry turning frequently to ensure even browning. Take off the heat and add the chillies and some of the oil to the salad. Crush the chillies lightly and mix gently. Serve cold.  Note: Saangdi mirchi is made by de-seeding and slitting the big green chilli, stuffing it with a paste of coriander, fenugreek and mustard seeds (all coarsely crushed) and mixed with sour yoghurt, and drying it in the sun.

While most of the UDF and LDF leaders are able to spend quality time with their family members, BJP state president K Surendran is stuck at his party state headquarters here. The family members of former Chief Minister Oommen Chandy are a happier lot ever since the lockdown came in to being.  They have reasons to feel contented as the head of the Puthuppally House at Poojappura is available almost round the clock at home, except when he steps out to visit Indira Bhavan to hold a press meet on the Sprinklr deal. The AICC general secretary in-charge of Andhra Pradesh, Chandy has always loved to be in the midst of people. His illness had kept him away from the people for a while. But now he is single-handedly handling the two landline telephones, listening to the matters of people who call him.  In a way it is good that the lockdown has forced Chandy to sit at home and take control of the situation. But I feel that he has become energised as he has a penchant to face crises. Our only fear is whether his voice would be affected as currently he is attending almost 100 calls a day, a personal staff of Chandy told TNIE. Cantonment House, the official residence of Opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala, is abuzz with activities. Chennithala told TNIE that his life has become organised with more time for yoga, exercise, prayer and reading.  Covid-19 has put KPCC president Mullappally Ramachandran also confined to his home and at Indira Bhavan where he is seen busy liaising with DCC presidents and party workers. Prior to the lockdown, Mullappally used to be busy with party programmes at his hometown at Vadakara. CPI secretary Kanam Rajendran is a tad disappointed with the ongoing lockdown. He told TNIE that he recently acquired a bad habit of enjoying a siesta. An advantage of being at home during this lockdown is to have homely food and proper rest and above all, the opportunity to spend quality time with the family, said Kanam.  CPM secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan has been confined to his apartment opposite AKG Centre. He occasionally steps out to visit the hospital as part of his ongoing treatment. Muslim League national general secretary P K Kunhalikutty, MP, is busy these days at his Pandikkadavath House at Malappuram where he is digitising his autobiography. Kunhalikutty has been co-ordinating the welfare activities of the Malayali diaspora in the Middle East.  If UDF and LDF leaders have been busy in their homes, there is one leader who is quite unhappy with the lockdown. It is none other than Surendran. His family is in Kozhikode and he does not want to ruffle the feathers of his political detractors by returning to his hometown. Most of the politicians are in their home towns. Unfortunately, I am here at the BJP state office having rice gruel and green gram as my office colleagues are all vegetarians, said Surendran.",GREEN GRAM DAL (MOONG DAL)

I stepped out into the terrace and a bee stung me. Bats, bee stings, ants...everything has been rewarding. I end each day by watching the sunset.  Sustainable lifestyle  I cook three fresh meals. As I have no fridge, I buy greens and vegetables that will last me a week without refrigerating. I use the green vegetables first and then the sturdier potatoes and beetroots later. I use indigenous rice and millets instead of processed grains to make my idli/adai/peserattu batter.  I experiment with millets to ensure that my idli/dosa batter is healthy. I soak one cup of black urad dal, two cups of Mappilai Samba rice/Poongar red rice or any other native rice and another half cup raw rice (this is optional but it makes crisp dosas!). Two cups of raagi/ cholam or any other millet has to be soaked separately and also two tablespoons of fenugreek. After four hours, grind them all together, add salt, allow to ferment overnight and use to make idlis the following day.

Inspired by Marie Kondo videos, she shares tips on de-cluttering ones lives and holds sessions at various corporate houses  I start my day with a seven-minute Qi Gong meditation. That keeps me going for the day. I feel lively and refreshed.  I have learnt to listen out for the high-pitched call of the common Mynah as I stop by the badam tree outside my house. I have begun to look out for birds and squirrels. I soak in the greenery and, as I take my pet out for a walk, I leave my mobile behind. The lockdown period has helped me realise my dream: to have the last meal of the day before sunset. It cuts down my cravings for snacking.  Sustainable lifestyle  I ensure that my house is clutter-free. I segregate and compost biodegradable waste. I stick to two meals a day. While I have fruits for breakfast, lunch is basic. Rice and dal, and some veggies and rasam. It is doing me a lot of good. Better still are my one-pot meals. I use just one vessel, few ingredients and leftover vegetables. To one tablespoon oil in the pressure cooker, I add one tablespoon jeera, three cloves of garlic, two green or red chillies, one chopped onion, a slice of ginger and a pinch of asafoetida, and turmeric powder, chilli powder, and garam masala to taste. (I sometimes substitute this with sambar powder). I add the chopped vegetables, cook for a few minutes and add three cups of water. Once it starts boiling, I add one cup of soaked rice and 3/4 cup of toor dal, and cook for three whistles. I drizzle a spoonful of ghee and chopped coriander. This is a complete meal by itself packed with carbohydrates, proteins and fat. In the process I save on precious water (only one vessel to wash), use up any leftover vegetables and save on gas.

Sometimes it takes a lockdown to slow down and appreciate nature better  These days, I have taken to dipping my toes in my lily pond, listening to bird songs as I cook, and enjoying the sights and sounds of nature as I prepare the soil and tend to my kitchen garden. We try and eat what we grow there. I plan meals in such a way that there is no food waste (even the chillies are finely chopped to ensure that we consume everything).  At a time when sanitisers and disinfectants are running out, we survive on natural hand wash powders and enzyme-based cleaners I make at home.

Here is a simple recipe for a home-made sanitiser. Take one cup of gram flour and one of green gram flour to which you add two tablespoons of neem leaf powder, orange lemon peel powder and soapnut powder. You can add rose petals or lemon grass (dried and powdered) and a few drops of essential oil for fragrance. Just wet your hands, sprinkle this powder, scrub and wash off.",GREEN GRAM DAL (MOONG DAL)

The farmer of Satjuari village under Lukumbeda panchayat is clueless of what to do with the standing crop that is ready to be harvested. The price of one kg of chilli has crashed from Rs50-Rs60 per kg to Rs10 a kg now as traders are unable to reach mandis to procure vegetables. I will not even be able to recover labour cost, he said.  Xalxos plants are brimming with the pepper. If the harvested crop goes unsold and allowed to ripe to be sold as dry chilli, then 20 quintal would be reduced to five quintal with no guarantee of fetching him a break-even cost. Another farmer Debadhar Mahato of Sorda panchayat is doubly hit by the lockdown and recent hailstorm. Mahato said his pumpkin and cucumber crops were hit by hailstorm during fruit-bearing stage.  Still, he is in possession of about 30 quintal of pumpkin, unwilling to sell at price offer of Rs3 to Rs4 per kg against normal price of Rs10 a kg. His brother Madhu carries 20 quintal to Rourkela market for retail selling in the restricted hours to muster whatever income he can. Mahato said after about 3 to 4 quintal of cucumber crops got damaged, he sold rest of nearly 25 quintal at Rs3 per kg.  Vegetable farmers of Nuagaon and other blocks are facing the same plight. Some farmers of Bisra block have even started feeding crops to cattle. Assistant Horticulture Officer S Pathak said steps are being taken to provide market linkage to the farmers to enable them to sell their produce at fair price.  Rain damage for green gram crop  Jagatsinghpur : Unseasonal rain since the last few days has affected green gram crops over thousands of acres in the district, adding to the misery of farmers who are already reeling under the coronavirus lockdown. Farmer Basant Nayak (75) of Sanpur village under Jagatsinghpur block said such inclement weather is generally not witnessed in the months of March and April. Heavy rain and hailstorms have damaged green gram crop over two acre of my land.  I am now unsure if I will be able to recover the cost of sowing the seeds, he said. Green gram has been cultivated over 42,116 hectare (ha) of land in the district and the agriculture department has set a target to procure about 2.50 lakh quintal of moong from farmers. However, the inclement weather has cast a cloud on the harvest of the crop. Besides, farmers had faced difficulties in carrying out farming activities due to unavailability of labourers due to restrictions on public mobility. Many farmers said after Covid-19, the untimely rains have added to their woes. Farmer leader Nityananda Panda said the State Government should provide compensation to the affected farmers.",GREEN GRAM DAL (MOONG DAL)

Haramohan Behera, a farmer of Garadapur, said his harvested mung crop has been damaged in rain. I had taken bank loan to cultivate the crop. Now with my produce destroyed, I dont know how I will repay the loan, he said.In Pattamundai, the farmers fear more losses if the rainwater is not flushed out from their agriculture fields soon. Sangram Das, a farmer, said, We are worried that the quality of mung will deteriorate if the crop remains inundated in rainwater.  The rain has also damaged brinjal, tomato and ladies finger crops and betel vine farms over vast tracts of farmland. Betel grower of Jamboo Sankar Mandal said the green leaves in many farms have been ruined in the rain. The leaves have been either bruised or rotting as the vines lie scattered on the ground due to rain and strong wind.  Moreover, the prediction of India Meteorological Department (IMD) of a low pressure area forming over south Andaman Sea and adjoining south-east Bay of Bengal around April 29 has added to the fears of farmers.

When it comes to food, there is a whole different culture and diversity associated to it. The country being a confluence of many cultures, has given space to cuisines from various foreign lands that bring further richness to the food scene. From street foods like Golgappa and Tikki-Chaat to delicacies like Navrattan Korma and Kebab to comfort foods like Nihari and Khichdi; all have a unique place in our hearts. However, one dish that is quite underrated but has a rich history to it is the humble Khichdi.The term Khichdi comes from the Sanskrit word Khiccha, meaning a dish of rice and legumes. Largely, Khichdi is made from rice and lentils, but there are some other regional variations like Bajra Khichdi and Moong Khichdi. In Hindu culture, it is one of the first solid foods that babies eat. Also, Khichdi is believed to be the inspiration behind the Anglo Indian dish Kedgeree, a dish consisting of cooked, flaked fish (traditionally smoked haddock), boiled rice, parsley, hard-boiled eggs, curry powder, butter or cream, and occasionally sultanas.The earliest reference to Khichdi could be found in the Indian epic Mahabharata, the events pertaining to which are believed to have taken place between 9th and 8th centuries BCE. In the Mahabharata, Draupadi is said to have fed Khichdi to the Pandavas during their exile. Also, it was a grain of rice from it eaten by Lord Krishna that made a hungry and furious Rishi Durvasha lose his appetite when he and his disciples dropped in suddenly for lunch. Khichdi is also mentioned in Sudamas story. Sudama, Lord Krishnas friend went to meet him to Dwarka from Vrindavan and carried two potlis (bundles), one containing Khichdi and the other roasted gram. The potli that contained Khichdi was snatched from a tree by a monkey. However, he was able to take a part of the other one to Dwarka where Krishna ate some of the gram and bestowed blessings on his friend.The Greek king Seleucus, during his campaign in India between 305-303 BC, mentioned that rice with pulses is very popular among people of the Indian subcontinent. The Moroccan traveler Ibn Battuta mentions Kishri as a dish in India composed of rice and Moong beans, during his stay around 1350. Battuta wrote, Munj is boiled with rice, then buttered and eaten. This is what they call Kishri, and on this, they breakfast every day. Khichdi is also described in the writings of Afanasiy Nikitin, a Russian adventurer who travelled to the Indian subcontinent in the 15th century.It was under the Mughals that Khichdi rose to prominence in the subcontinent. Akbar was voraciously fond of Khichdi as he was a frugal eater. He preferred to have his meals alone. The Akbar-Birbal story, about Birbal using Khichdi to make Akbar accept a mistake in judgement is known to everyone. A little known fact pertaining to Akbars courtier Abul Fazl, and his relation to Khichdi is very fascinating. Fazl used to get 30 maunds of Khichdi cooked every day and anybody passing by his house could relish on it for 24 hours. Going by the quantities, a maund was 40 seers or approximately 40 kg, and 30 maunds equals to 1,200 kg of Khichdi every day!Among the other Mughal emperors, Jahangir was very fond of a spicy Khichdi variation enriched with pistachios and raisins and named it lazeezan (the delicious). Aurangzeb was quite fond of Khichdi ( Alamgiri Khichdi, a spin-off featuring fish and boiled eggs) during Ramzan and Bahadur Shah Zafar enjoyed eating Moong-ki-Dal Khichdi so much that the Dal came to be known as Badshah Pasand. In the 19th century, Nawab of Awadh Nasir-ud-din Shahs royal kitchen was famous for its royal chef who used to make an extravagant Khichdi entirely from pistachios and almonds which were cut to resemble the grains of lentils and rice respectively.Interestingly, Khichdi went to England as well to Queen Victoria. She got a taste of Khichdi when Munshi Abdul Karim, her Urdu tutor, offered her some. But she liked and preferred Masoor-ki-Dal mixed in rice with it, whose soup was often served to her. This is how the Dal came to be known as Malika Masoor.Today, every region in India has its own take on the classic dish that is Khichdi. It is Indias very own version of culinary comfort. From serving it as a babys first meal to an easily digestible and nutritious meal for a sick person, Khichdi is a part of diverse occasions. So next time, whenever you utter the phrase, Kya Khichdi paka rahe ho? (What schemes are you making), dont forget to cook and eat a bowlful of this soulful delight.",GREEN GRAM DAL (MOONG DAL)

The 21-year-old was part of a group of 21  around three families  that walked over 600 km through the deserts sandy terrain to avoid main roads amid a strict lockdown. The journey started on April 16 on foot and ended on April 25, only to be followed by isolation at home.  Like every year, this group from Muktsars Gandar village had gone to Jaisalmers Suthar Mandi in March for harvesting of green gram (hara chholiya). Stuck without work, they decided to walk back as the country moved into Lockdown 2.0.  Recalling the unforgiving journey, Sukhdev said: It was strict curfew when we started on April 16 and we came through uneven, sandy area of desert so as to save ourselves from cops standing on main roads. It is around 602 km from Suthar Mandi to our village, but I think we travelled more. No one helped us on the way, even no one allowed us to drink water from irrigation channels. If villagers saw us they clearly told us that we may infect their water.  Part of the group that walked back were women and children.  Gurdev Singh travelled with his expectant wife, Naseeb Kaur, and the couples 6-year-old daughter. He said: We were not even allowed to enter any village along the way even if we wanted to take rest under shade of a tree. I was along with my wife and a 6-year-old daughter.  Veerpal Kaur, who is expecting her first child, returned in this state. Another family in the group had a 3-month old daughter.  Sukhdev said, On our way back, we saw many other Punjabis also walking back on foot. We also saw one person collapse and die due to lack of water. We dont know as how they would have managed to reach their village with the dead body.  The group said they made it back sustaining themselves supplies they carried along including wheat flour, gur, chana and milk powder. Sukhdev said, We would cook rotis by using dry branches picked along the way. We used milk powder to feed the children and make tea. We were pained that no one helped us all along the way despite the fact that we had children along in our group.  While the painful journey and the quarantine is over, the group of farm labourers is now worried about making ends meet.  As labour is not involved in cotton sowing, now we are waiting for paddy sowing season. We are ready to do it provided farmers choose us instead of migrant workers. We too are farm labour like the migrants and are in need  of money, said Sukhdev.  Gurdev Singh, another farm worker, added: We could not work after March 21. We waited for few days in the village and then started on April 16 on foot.  Congress leader Jaijeet Singh Johal, who is brother-in-law of Punjab FM Manpreet Singh Badal and hails from the same village, said: We are pained to hear their story.

Unnakkaya  In Kerala for example, besides the ubiquitous pazhampori (banana fritters), unniappam and parippu (lentil) vada, most families have their own snack recipes. Rahul Prasad, from Kozhikode, says the muttayappam (a savoury pancake) his mother makes is a unique combination of rice flour, eggs, coconut, shallots and green chillies, which he hasnt eaten anywhere else.  Love letter (Elanji) Ingredients  Sugar -- 1/2 cup  Coconut -- 1 cup  Maida -- 1 1/2 cup  Water -- as required  Method  Mix the maida with water to make a batter (thin dosa batter consistency). Pour it just as you would a dosa on a heated pan. As it gets cooked, spread coconut and sugar mix and intead of flipping the dosa, roll it. Take off pan and serve hot.  The building blocks are often similar. A Malayali snack worth its salt must have coconut, jaggery and banana or jackfruit, says Sunitha Menon from Kanjiramattom. Shes making unnakkaya for tea, a delicious fusion of banana, coconut, sugar and ghee. The love letter (also known as elanji) has also resurfaced: this is a wrap filled with sweet, grated coconut. Then there are the madhura puffs (also known as pugada), a fried snack filled with grated coconut and sugar, popular in North Kerala in the 90s.

She sought help from her mother-in-law, who is an expert in the dish. She made the dough and I pressed it in the mould. The pakodas turned out really well  crispy and delicious, says Shobhana. To get great results, she says, the mix of besan, rice flour and roasted and powdered urad dal should be perfect. It is then seasoned with salt, chilli powder and asafoetida, and kneaded with a generous quantity of butter and heated oil. Ideally had with a cup of filter coffee, this pakoda is an ever-green snack.  Ragini Kumar from Bihar is rediscovering two of the States favourite teatime snacks, spongy rosogullas and samosas stuffed with a spicy potato mash. Over the phone, from her home in Patna, she talks about how evening tea was a ceremony in Bihari families. Stating that while the rosogullas and samosas were staples, everyday, There was always an additional namkeen, (a savoury preparation) or a sweetmeat such as thekua, a deep-fried biscuit made of flour, with flower motifs impressed on it, and khaja, a deep-fried flaky pastry. The namkeens could be ghugni, stir-fried green gram or nimki, deep-fried diamond-shaped short eats.  Hara channa fritters  Winter evenings were for hara channa fritters, made with dried green chick peas, rice flour batter and onions; the deep-fried snack is still a popular favourite. The water chestnut halwa, no longer common, used to be made until a few decades ago. Nowadays it is had during a fast, says Ragini.  The tea is also important, she adds, saying that the flavour, colour and body of tea is an important conversation point. Tea time was also when families dropped in to visit, hence a large spread was always ready. Ragini says the lockdown has given her ample time to discuss these recipes with family members. One thing we all plan to have post lockdown when we meet is the puffed rice-peanut mix, at least in memory of the lockdown.  At Sweena Karnanis home in Visakhapatnam, teatime has become all about scarfing down traditional Marwari snacks. Food certainly comforts, she says, adding that her menu for the day is the Marwari traditional ajwain pakoda chaat, pyaaz ki kachori and gudd ki papdi. Plucking fresh ajwain leaves from her kitchen garden, Sweena combines it with spinach to coat it with a batter of gram flour and spices. This is then deep fried and served with yoghurt and tamarind chutney. This ajwain pakoda is a famous snack of Varanasi, she adds.  Late afternoons are filled with the sizzle of punugulus wobbling in the frying pan at Jhansi Tripuranenis kitchen. This Telugu short eat is served with crimson ginger chutney for that spicy twist. Piping hot punugulus make for a perfect chai-time snack, adds Jhansi. Traditionally made with a batter of rice flour and black gram, Jhansi says these can be tried with leftover dosa batter too.  Gunta punugulu  Among all the snacks Instagrammer Radhika Raja has tried out during the lockdown, the gunta punugulu  made with less oil, and so healthier  is her favourite. These are made with less oil and are therefore healthier. The lockdown has given me plenty of time to make different versions of this traditional snack, says Radhika. She prepares it by mixing boiled sweet corn, grated carrot, green chillies in dosa batter, sprinkled with jeera (cumin), salt and pepper. The batter is poured in the iron cast skillet to be cooked over a small flame till the punugulus turn golden brown.  Sreeparna Sarkar relives her childhood in Kolkata through the Bengali snacks she has been trying out every day. The highlight of her experiments has been the korai sutir kochuri, a deep-fried kachori, stuffed with mildly spiced, asafoetida-infused green peas. Nobody can make this as good as mom, she sighs, but is quick to add: but thankfully there is FaceTime!  Eggplant coated with gram flour and deep fried. | Photo Credit: creative_streaks  The Bengali in her loves all things deep-fried, which she has been making with her mothers help through video calls from Bolepur. Her lockdown teatime snack list includes aloo chop  mashed potato with spices, coated with egg and bread crumbs and deep fried in oil, fried begunis (batter fried eggplant) and peyaji (onion fritters).  Tekeli Pitha Ingredients  Rice -- 2 cups  Coconut -- 2 cups, freshly grated  Sugar -- Half cup  Salt -- a pinch  Water as required  Method  Soak the rice for an hour. Wash and drain excess water and let it go semi dry. Grind to a fine powder. Keep the powder in a bowl covered with a wet cloth. Mix rice flour, freshly grated coconut, sugar and salt. Fill half a kettle with water and bring to boil. Place the rice flour mixture on the kettle lid and press gently. Cover it with a wet muslin cloth. Tie the ends and fold back to the head of the lid securing the mixture for steaming. Place the lid back on the kettle and let it steam on medium flame for 6-7 minutes. Remove the muslin cloth and take out the pithas and place it in a plate gently. Serve hot with tea.  Certain foods go beyond their scope; they kindle fond memories of home and relationships, says Jisha M R, a Malayali married to an Assamese, living in Delhi. When she first came across the tekeli pitha, she knew she had found love. It looked like idli and tasted like puttu and since then, it has been my favourite, she says. Pithas are primarily made from a batter of rice flour or wheat flour, which is shaped into a pouch and filled with sweet or savoury ingredients.  Tekeli Pitha  Tekeli pithas are essentially rice cakes steamed in a kettle or an earthen pot, from which it derives its name. Jisha aims to master the dish with help from her sister-in-law Malavika Goswami and mother-in-law Renu Goswami during the lockdown. For me, food is about ones family, emotions and experience, she says.  (With inputs from Nivedita Ganguly and Priyadershini S)",GREEN GRAM DAL (MOONG DAL)

They had grown vegetables, pulses and jute crops in several hectares of land which had reached harvesting stage. The crops have now been flattened by strong wind and heavy rain.  Many farmers could not harvest their crops due to lack of time and farm labourers. Farmers of Bharatpur village said they were preparing to harvest Moong and Biri crops this week but could not due to heavy rain. Madhab Das of Naranapur, who had grown Biri on four acres of land, could harvest the yield from only one acre and crops on the rest land were damaged in the cyclone.  Sea water entered vast area of crop lands as embankments caved in due to heavy rain. Complaints of crop damage have been pouring in from many other villages as well. Collector Samarth Verma said all the BDOs and Tehsildars have been asked to submit crop damage reports at the earliest so that compensation can be paid to affected farmers.  Kutcha houses in many coastal villages were also damaged under the impact of gusty winds. Tapan Mandal of Jamboo had constructed a four-room asbestos house three years back but the structure was razed to the ground when Amphan battered the seaside village. With no other option, Tapan along with his family members has taken shelter in a school. Polythene sheets are yet to be provided to people whose kutcha houses were damaged.",GREEN GRAM DAL (MOONG DAL)

(Express file)  Distribution of free pulses under the PM Garib Kalyan Ann Yojana (PMGKAY) has picked pace after initial hiccups with 12 crore households getting the entitled amount till May 22, a top official in the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food Distribution and Public Distribution said on Saturday.  Consumer Affairs Secretary Leena Nandan told The Sunday Express: Against a three-month allocation of 5.87 lakh metric tons (1.95 LMT per month), a total quantity of 4.25 LMT has been dispatched to all States/UTs and about 3.19 LMT has been received by them 1.34 LMT has been distributed to over 12 crore households till May 22.  On March 26, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had announced free pulses  1 kg per family  for the next three months as part of the Covid relief package to all beneficiaries under the National Food Security Act. However, only around 10 per cent families got the entitled amount in the first month of April. That number has now gone up to 61 per cent  12 crore of the total 19.55 crore households.  Officials said some of the states distributed the entire amount in one go.  Citing reasons for the initial delay, Nandan said: The Department, for the first time ever, undertook such a humongous exercise to make available pulses of choice, free of cost for three months, to all the States/UTs for distribution to all the NFSA beneficiaries.  What made the whole exercise complex was that the different pulses had to be procured from different locations, milled before their supply to states as per the states choice, and these included seven types of pulses like tur dal, urad dal, moong whole, moong Dal, masoor dal, chana whole and chana dal, which are produced in different states.

Gone are the days when farmers of SRSP and LMD command areas waited only for water to be released through canals to take up cultivation. Now, all the minor irrigation tanks are filled to the brim with KLIP water to let farmers start agricultural activities without waiting for the rains, he said, and added that there was no shortage of water for irrigation and drinking water needs in the district.  Mr. Rajender along with Minister for Social Welfare Koppula Eshwar and Minister for BC Welfare and Civil Supplies Gangula Kamalakar, Peddapalli MP Venkatesh Netha, elected representatives of Karimnagar, Jagtial and Peddapalli and district officials participated at a review meeting on kharif (Vanakalam) action plan at the Collectorate on Sunday.  He called upon farmers to go for a fine variety of paddy instead of the regular variety for better profits. Stating that the district has emerged as the rice bowl of Telangana and also the seed bowl of the country, he said that the majority of farmers cultivate paddy in the district due to availability of water. He urged them to take up other crops like cotton, red gram, green gram and soya bean.  He also informed farmers to take up turmeric and cultivate maize as only inter-crop for better yields. He said that the agriculture scientists would conduct soil tests and ask them to take up cultivation of different varieties of crops.  Minister for Social Welfare Koppula Eshwar said that the completion of KLIP had ensured that each and every village secured the Godavari water. He said that Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao had allocated 100 crore to ensure that water reached all the minor irrigation tanks that did not get water through KLIP.  Minister for BC Welfare and Civil Supplies Gangula Kamalakar instructed farmers to take up cultivation at least two months in advance to avoid losses following unseasonal rains and hailstorms. He said that they were importing the fine variety of paddy to be consumed in the State due to farmers cultivating only the normal variety, which was being consumed by other states.  MLCs T.

Crop plans should be formulated at the village level as prescribed by the State government to enhance farm productivity and fetch better income for farmers, he said.  He was addressing a district-level meeting held under the aegis of Collector R. V. Karnan to deliberate on the crop plan for the coming monsoon season here on Monday.  Khammam MP Nama Nageswara Rao, several elected public representatives, members of Rythu Bandhu Samithis and officials concerned were present.  The agriculture extension officers, field staff of the allied departments and volunteers of the Rythu Bandhu Samithis should work as a cohesive force to motivate farmers cultivate those crops having demand in the market as suggested by the government, he said.  Fine variety rice  Farmers should be encouraged to cultivate paddy of Sanna variety, red gram and cotton crops besides vegetables in the ensuing crop season. They should be dissuaded from growing maize during vaanakalam (kharif) to avoid losses, he suggested.  Agriculture departments crop plan for kharif-2020 envisages sowing various crops on about 3,14,420 acres.

""We had given up trying to attempt these many years ago because of the pollution. But now, because of clear skies and bright sunlight, we have been able to make these at home,"" he says.Like the vadam of the south, in northern and western India, this is the time to make sundried fermented lentil dumplings such as the spiced urad dal baris and plainer moong dal mangori. Till the 1990s, households even in urban areas of UP, Punjab and Rajasthan would set these out to dry in the sun on terraces, along with martabans of kaanji, a water based pickling of carrots, or mango, lime or jackfruit pickles in oil, all set to ferment and ripen. Many of these old techniques are back in fashion as evident from social media posts.Then, there are simpler everyday tasks like making rotis or phulkas, a staple that a majority of middle class Indians no longer make themselves, relying on domestic help and cooks. In the lockdown, there is not just a forced revival of these basics but at least a few of the millennials and Gen Y are learning these for the first time. Ankita Chavan, a young chef who works at The Bombay Canteen and has trained at Noma, is back home in Vadodara, and tells me that she is learning to make soft, round chapattis from her mother.In fact, bread-making extends to not just sourdoughs and slider buns, but to Indian breads such as paos and kulchas too. Bhatura , the fermented popular puffed up delight, seems to be much missed as a Sunday treat, and Delhi food groups are full of pictures of people cooking these at home.Nisha Madhulika, one of Indias most popular YouTube stars with an estimated 1.33 billion views (and an income far exceeding that of most top chefs), has a fan base that is growing even more. Her videos on how to make softer bhaturas, ring samosas, and how to bake in a pressure cooker, are a hit with a newer, younger audience too. Her tips to bake cakes in a pressure cooker are fantastic. I havent seen these anywhere else, says Prerna Jaiswal, who works for the Serendipity Arts Festival in Delhi, and has been baking furiously in her hometown of Palia Kalan, near the Dudwa National Park.Judging from food pictures being posted on Instagram, in food groups and on other social media, it may be a mistake to think that metropolitan Indians and those who had formed the bulk of the restaurant-going audience are making do with simple, subsistence-level fare at home. Quite a few, instead, are using the lockdown as an opportunity to delve deeper into regional cuisines. ""I am spending more effort on understanding soft fragrant spices such as dagadh ka phool and exploring a little more of Karnataka and Telangana cuisines,"" says a top fashion editor who does not wish to be named.Forgotten and painstaking recipes such as torai ke chilke ki subzi, made with finely slicing peels, and potli ki subzi, where lentils are steamed in a muslin cloth, cut into nuggets and put in gravy also seem to be making a comeback, as people gravitate to tastes of their childhood. Blogs such as Hebbars Kitchen (for south Indian recipes) and Shampas Kitchen (for Bengali) seem to be hot favourites, even as professional restaurant chefs struggle to build online followings.It is not just in the Indian metros that people are taking to learning traditional techniques of cooking complex regional dishes. Even in London, with a big Indian community, chef Rohit Ghais recipes that he posts online every day seem to be a hit. From DIY rasmalai to venison shami kebab and slow cooked rogan josh, many Indians are lapping it up and learning. ""I would rush over Indian food earlier but now am taking time to do things properly. It helps that chefs like Rohit Ghai are sharing some of their signature dishes' recipes. And Dhishoom shared its entire cook book. I followed their mattar paneer recipe to the T. It took me 90 minutes but was so worth it,"" says Shivani Sodhi Maitra, partner Deloitte London.In these difficult times, complex cooking processes are perhaps a stress-buster; the silver lining is that techniques that we had forgotten or outsourced may be revived.",GREEN GRAM DAL (MOONG DAL)

Suvojit Bagchi and Shiv Sahay Singh report on the trail of destruction in a State already grappling with the COVID-19 crisis  The doors of the robust sedan started rattling. The windows of the car began rattling too, tugging at the frames that held them. The wind speed was 110 km/hour. All around us, mighty trees swayed violently and some already lay fallen like toothpicks. Branches flew like dangerous missiles in the leafiest neighbourhood in south Kolkata, Southern Avenue. It was 6.20 p.m. on May 20. The storm was brewing.  After we clicked a couple of photographs, the driver sounded a word of caution: The back wheel is mildly floating in the air. We clambered out and fled the scene. Outside, the sky had changed dramatically. Darkness had descended and the wind howled.  Also read | Cyclone Amphan makes quick work of grand trees and joie de vivre of City of Joy  Over the next several hours, super cyclone Amphan went on a rampage. It surged through the city, carelessly sweeping aside trees, lamp posts, vehicles, and even robust brick-and-mortar structures. It took away my house. But my brothers house across the road was still standing, said Moktar Ali, a fish vendor at Minakhan market in South 24 Parganas.  One of the earliest emergency calls to the Bangla Sanskriti Mancha, a group that works mainly with migrant workers, came from Selima Khatun of Hasnabad village in North 24 Parganas. The phone rang at around 7 p.m. on May 21, a full day after the storm had unleashed its anger. Save us, she pleaded. We are about 100 people on the roof of the mosque. As far as I can see, everything is under water. All our houses are inundated. Our pets have been swept away to the sea.  The Mancha received hundreds of such calls after the cyclone. The president of the group, Samirul Islam, said it is impossible to guess the extent of the damage as neither the government nor the media could reach the epicentre of the cyclone, Sagar Island, about 100 km south of Kolkata. He said a man named Vineet called him to say that the islands in Patharpratima in South 24 Parganas had disappeared. No news channel could reach there, so no news is coming from there, Vineet told Islam over the phone. We dont know if Sagar Island exists any more. The jetty at Kachuberia in Sagar has been pulled into the sea. Its been two days, but no outside support has come yet. Subhas Bhandari from Mousuni Island said fog had surrounded the entire island and caused panic among the people. We could taste salt on our skin, he said.

There is no historical record of a cyclone with a wind speed as high as 185 km/hour making landfall on the coast of Bengal in recent times. It was not only the intensity of the storm that made the event significant but also its duration. The wall cloud stayed for almost five to six hours. The only comparison that the people of coastal Bengal and the authorities could make was with Cyclone Aila which struck in 2009, but with a speed of 120 km/hour. In anticipation of Amphan, 5 lakh people were evacuated to cyclone shelters. Of them, 3 lakh alone were from South 24 Parganas district.  But while destruction caused by the storm has been vast, the number of deaths in West Bengal has been relatively low. Banerjee said 98 people died in the cyclone, of which 19 lost their lives in Kolkata. And in some ecologically fragile places, casualties have been very low. Amphan ripped through Ghoramara, the smallest and most vulnerable island in the Sundarbans, with a population of 5,000 inhabitants, only claiming two goats. They died when a wall collapsed on them.  A few hours after the cyclone, Banerjee sat at the State Secretariat and summed up the scale and nature of the tempest via video conference. South and North 24 Parganas are finished and 99% of south Bengal are destroyed, she said, looking at updates on her mobile phone. We need to rebuild Bengal from scratch.  Acres and acres of agricultural land in the State were flooded. Tarak Ghosh, a small farmer, pulled out wet paddy from a field which, until a week ago, was glowing under the sun. It was just the beginning of the harvest of the Rabi crop. It is all gone now, he said. West Bengal, the leading State in paddy production, had suffered a great blow. By one estimate, about 1.5 million sharecroppers of south Bengal had lost their produce. Vegetables and cash crops like sesame, jute and fruits had simply disappeared. Farmers are coming to withdraw deposits, not to buy pesticides and fertilizers. This is a bad sign at the peak of the harvesting season, said Liaqat Ali Jangi, a middle-level farmer and manager of a farmers cooperative, Dhubulia Krishi Unnayan Samiti, which has about 1,000 members, in Nadia district.  We voted for Mohua Moitra of the Trinamool Congress. Yet, when we lost our jobs and then after COVID-19 struck, she never visited the area. She is on television talking about big issues but we are dying due to issues like joblessness and crop failure, said Rahim Baksh Mollah of Charmahatpur. The district leaders of Trinamool did not deny that their MLAs and MPs were busy on social media during the lockdown. They have left the politics to Didi, said a Nadia district leader of the Trinamool, on condition of anonymity.

Most people remained indoors and held on to the doors and windows of their homes to prevent water from entering inside. All they could hear was the wind and the torrential rain. There was little or no visibility. By evening, as the cyclone became more and more fierce, large parts of the city plunged into darkness. Two iconic structures in the city, Howrah Bridge and Victoria Memorial, were invisible.  After a long night of battling with the cyclone, millions in south Bengal, including Kolkata, woke up to destruction that was of a scale they had never imagined. The city was completely battered. Trees and poles lay uprooted in every lane in every neighbourhood.  Over the next few days, Kolkata had not only the monumental task of restoring essential infrastructure services, but also power and electric supply, disrupted by the storm and the fallen trees. There was an outpouring of anger on the streets. Protests broke out in several neighbourhoods, and the Army was called in.  Also read | Storm of rage in battered Kolkata  Six days after Amphan, at the Regional Meteorological Centre in Kolkata, Sanjib Bandyopadhyay, the Deputy Director General of Meteorology, was still trying to pull all stops to get the Internet at his office fixed. We should be your top priority, he told the staff member at the Internet service provider over phone. The Chief Minister is visiting districts and we cannot provide updates. The staff member retorted, Like you there are several top priorities for us. In fact, you are priority number 132.  Bandyopadhyay was the man of the hour. He had been issuing all the necessary alerts about the cyclone for several days before it made landfall. On May 20, at about 4 p.m., he told the press that the landfall process of the cyclone had commenced near Sagar Island at 2.30 p.m. and that the cyclone was moving towards the north and north-east.  Bandyopadhyay explained that it was the first time that the India Meteorological Department (IMD) had issued an advisory for people to stay inside their homes. This was not the COVID-19 advisory, he clarified. The administration also ensured that the people remained indoors. Weather officials said they gave regular advisories in their bulletin that the damage will be caused by three factors: gale winds, rainfall, and storm surge. The IMDs focus, they said, was on getting the prediction of intensity and track of the cyclone right. The officials said they got it right, just like they did with earlier cyclones such as Bulbul, Fani and Hudhud.  Close to Kolkata, destruction was visible in Howrah district. The 230-year-old Acharya Jagadish Chandra Bose Indian Botanic Garden, set up by the British to pioneer botanical research in India, had turned into a graveyard of trees. At least a thousand trees, including some notable and rare species, were destroyed, said Kanad Das, scientist, Botanical Survey of India, and in-charge of the Botanic Garden. A Dutch cemetery, around the same age as the garden, was destroyed in Hooghly-Chinsurah. The impact of the storm was felt as far as in the Bardhaman and Birbhum districts of south Bengal.

But after the cyclone, the only way to survive was to catch prawn seeds in the water. For a thousand seeds, we get 200, Basanti said.  While gale winds ravaged Deulbari, there was more suffering to follow when the embankments broke and seawater flowed into the villages. The embankments of several villages in Hasnabad, Hingalganj and Minakhan in North 24 Parganas, and Patharpratima, Namkhana, Bansanti, and Gosaba in South 24 Parganas suffered extensive damage.

Suvojit Bagchi and Shiv Sahay Singh report on the trail of destruction in a State already grappling with the COVID-19 crisis  The doors of the robust sedan started rattling. The windows of the car began rattling too, tugging at the frames that held them. The wind speed was 110 km/hour. All around us, mighty trees swayed violently and some already lay fallen like toothpicks. Branches flew like dangerous missiles in the leafiest neighbourhood in south Kolkata, Southern Avenue. It was 6.20 p.m. on May 20. The storm was brewing.  After we clicked a couple of photographs, the driver sounded a word of caution: The back wheel is mildly floating in the air. We clambered out and fled the scene. Outside, the sky had changed dramatically. Darkness had descended and the wind howled.  Also read | Cyclone Amphan makes quick work of grand trees and joie de vivre of City of Joy  Over the next several hours, super cyclone Amphan went on a rampage. It surged through the city, carelessly sweeping aside trees, lamp posts, vehicles, and even robust brick-and-mortar structures. It took away my house. But my brothers house across the road was still standing, said Moktar Ali, a fish vendor at Minakhan market in South 24 Parganas.  One of the earliest emergency calls to the Bangla Sanskriti Mancha, a group that works mainly with migrant workers, came from Selima Khatun of Hasnabad village in North 24 Parganas. The phone rang at around 7 p.m. on May 21, a full day after the storm had unleashed its anger. Save us, she pleaded. We are about 100 people on the roof of the mosque. As far as I can see, everything is under water. All our houses are inundated. Our pets have been swept away to the sea.  The Mancha received hundreds of such calls after the cyclone. The president of the group, Samirul Islam, said it is impossible to guess the extent of the damage as neither the government nor the media could reach the epicentre of the cyclone, Sagar Island, about 100 km south of Kolkata. He said a man named Vineet called him to say that the islands in Patharpratima in South 24 Parganas had disappeared. No news channel could reach there, so no news is coming from there, Vineet told Islam over the phone. We dont know if Sagar Island exists any more. The jetty at Kachuberia in Sagar has been pulled into the sea. Its been two days, but no outside support has come yet. Subhas Bhandari from Mousuni Island said fog had surrounded the entire island and caused panic among the people. We could taste salt on our skin, he said.

There is no historical record of a cyclone with a wind speed as high as 185 km/hour making landfall on the coast of Bengal in recent times. It was not only the intensity of the storm that made the event significant but also its duration. The wall cloud stayed for almost five to six hours. The only comparison that the people of coastal Bengal and the authorities could make was with Cyclone Aila which struck in 2009, but with a speed of 120 km/hour. In anticipation of Amphan, 5 lakh people were evacuated to cyclone shelters. Of them, 3 lakh alone were from South 24 Parganas district.  But while destruction caused by the storm has been vast, the number of deaths in West Bengal has been relatively low. Banerjee said 98 people died in the cyclone, of which 19 lost their lives in Kolkata. And in some ecologically fragile places, casualties have been very low. Amphan ripped through Ghoramara, the smallest and most vulnerable island in the Sundarbans, with a population of 5,000 inhabitants, only claiming two goats. They died when a wall collapsed on them.  A few hours after the cyclone, Banerjee sat at the State Secretariat and summed up the scale and nature of the tempest via video conference. South and North 24 Parganas are finished and 99% of south Bengal are destroyed, she said, looking at updates on her mobile phone. We need to rebuild Bengal from scratch.  Acres and acres of agricultural land in the State were flooded. Tarak Ghosh, a small farmer, pulled out wet paddy from a field which, until a week ago, was glowing under the sun. It was just the beginning of the harvest of the Rabi crop. It is all gone now, he said. West Bengal, the leading State in paddy production, had suffered a great blow. By one estimate, about 1.5 million sharecroppers of south Bengal had lost their produce. Vegetables and cash crops like sesame, jute and fruits had simply disappeared. Farmers are coming to withdraw deposits, not to buy pesticides and fertilizers. This is a bad sign at the peak of the harvesting season, said Liaqat Ali Jangi, a middle-level farmer and manager of a farmers cooperative, Dhubulia Krishi Unnayan Samiti, which has about 1,000 members, in Nadia district.  We voted for Mohua Moitra of the Trinamool Congress. Yet, when we lost our jobs and then after COVID-19 struck, she never visited the area. She is on television talking about big issues but we are dying due to issues like joblessness and crop failure, said Rahim Baksh Mollah of Charmahatpur. The district leaders of Trinamool did not deny that their MLAs and MPs were busy on social media during the lockdown. They have left the politics to Didi, said a Nadia district leader of the Trinamool, on condition of anonymity.

Most people remained indoors and held on to the doors and windows of their homes to prevent water from entering inside. All they could hear was the wind and the torrential rain. There was little or no visibility. By evening, as the cyclone became more and more fierce, large parts of the city plunged into darkness. Two iconic structures in the city, Howrah Bridge and Victoria Memorial, were invisible.  After a long night of battling with the cyclone, millions in south Bengal, including Kolkata, woke up to destruction that was of a scale they had never imagined. The city was completely battered. Trees and poles lay uprooted in every lane in every neighbourhood.  Over the next few days, Kolkata had not only the monumental task of restoring essential infrastructure services, but also power and electric supply, disrupted by the storm and the fallen trees. There was an outpouring of anger on the streets. Protests broke out in several neighbourhoods, and the Army was called in.  Also read | Storm of rage in battered Kolkata  Six days after Amphan, at the Regional Meteorological Centre in Kolkata, Sanjib Bandyopadhyay, the Deputy Director General of Meteorology, was still trying to pull all stops to get the Internet at his office fixed. We should be your top priority, he told the staff member at the Internet service provider over phone. The Chief Minister is visiting districts and we cannot provide updates. The staff member retorted, Like you there are several top priorities for us. In fact, you are priority number 132.  Bandyopadhyay was the man of the hour. He had been issuing all the necessary alerts about the cyclone for several days before it made landfall. On May 20, at about 4 p.m., he told the press that the landfall process of the cyclone had commenced near Sagar Island at 2.30 p.m. and that the cyclone was moving towards the north and north-east.  Bandyopadhyay explained that it was the first time that the India Meteorological Department (IMD) had issued an advisory for people to stay inside their homes. This was not the COVID-19 advisory, he clarified. The administration also ensured that the people remained indoors. Weather officials said they gave regular advisories in their bulletin that the damage will be caused by three factors: gale winds, rainfall, and storm surge. The IMDs focus, they said, was on getting the prediction of intensity and track of the cyclone right. The officials said they got it right, just like they did with earlier cyclones such as Bulbul, Fani and Hudhud.  Close to Kolkata, destruction was visible in Howrah district. The 230-year-old Acharya Jagadish Chandra Bose Indian Botanic Garden, set up by the British to pioneer botanical research in India, had turned into a graveyard of trees. At least a thousand trees, including some notable and rare species, were destroyed, said Kanad Das, scientist, Botanical Survey of India, and in-charge of the Botanic Garden. A Dutch cemetery, around the same age as the garden, was destroyed in Hooghly-Chinsurah. The impact of the storm was felt as far as in the Bardhaman and Birbhum districts of south Bengal.

Basanti and her husband Basudev used to have a pond with fish, and grew rice and vegetables. The sale of fish, rice and vegetables was enough to support them. But after the cyclone, the only way to survive was to catch prawn seeds in the water. For a thousand seeds, we get 200, Basanti said.  While gale winds ravaged Deulbari, there was more suffering to follow when the embankments broke and seawater flowed into the villages. The embankments of several villages in Hasnabad, Hingalganj and Minakhan in North 24 Parganas, and Patharpratima, Namkhana, Bansanti, and Gosaba in South 24 Parganas suffered extensive damage.

(PTI) Several states and Union Territories, including Uttar Pradesh and Delhi, have warned against possible locust attacks. (PTI)  There hasnt been much systematic research on desert locusts in the country since the early 1990s and the current swarm invasions are a wakeup call to restart and revive the programme, said Trilochan Mohapatra, director-general of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR).  A lot of basic work on their biology, breeding behaviour, development and food habits was done in the decades immediately before and after Independence, especially by stalwarts such as H.S. Pruthi, S. Pradhan and K.N. Mehrotra. Locust attacks were frequent at that time and so there was lot of research interest too. But as the problem became less severe and no smarm incursions after 1997, the focus shifted to other more regular field pests, Mohapatra told The Sunday Express.  Locust plague cycles  defined as a period of two or more consecutive years of widespread breeding, swarm formation and crop destruction  were a recurrent phenomenon throughout the nineteenth century and the first half of the 1900s. The last such cycle was reported in 1959-62.  Subsequently, there have been only isolated years of upsurges; even the incursions of 1973-76 werent numerically large or significant enough to qualify as plague. After 1997, there were no upsurges either  till 2019, when 1,500 swarm attacks were recorded, and the current year that has already seen 27 (see charts).  They have come back after a long gap. So far, the damage hasnt been much, since the only major crops in the fields now are summer moong (green gram) and early-stage cotton (in Punjab, Haryana and North Rajasthan). But we have to see what the swarms returning to Rajasthan after July for breeding will do, Mohapatra pointed out.  The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation, on May 27, predicted several successive waves of locust invasions until July in Rajasthan with eastward surges across northern India as far as Bihar and Orissa. These movements will, however, reverse once the winds change direction along with the southwest monsoon. The swarms, basically comprising winged immature adults that are yet to lay eggs, would then come back to Rajasthan.  They breed mostly in deserts, as the female can lay eggs only in bare sandy soils at 5-10 cm depth. She will first insert the tip of her abdomen to check if there is adequate soil moisture, then bore into the ground and deposit a batch of up to 80 eggs before filling up the hole with a protective foamy material. Such sandy soil (as against the more fertile alluvial or black cotton soils) with just enough moisture is found only in desert regions after the monsoon rains, explained S.N. Sushil, principal scientist (agriculture entomology) at the ICARs Indian Institute of Sugarcane Research, Lucknow.  The presence of desert locusts in transient mature groups was identified in May 2019 at Pokaran teshil of Rajasthans Jaisalmer district. Between May 2019 and February 2020, a total area of 403,488 hectares in Rajasthan, Gujarat and Punjab was treated using 314,645 litres/kg of Malathion insecticide.  The swarms may have come from Pakistan, but some breeding would have also taken place here last year. We need to see what happens once they breed again in our conditions over several cycles: Will they undergo genetic changes or even develop resistance to the insecticides now being sprayed? Are there other ways to control them, including preventing their transformation from solitary to gregarious (swarm-forming) phase? Mohapatra pointed out.  Besides Malathion, the other chemicals approved by the Central Insecticides Board & Registration Committee for control of the desert locust are Chlorpyriphos, Deltamethrin, Lambdacyhalothrin, Fipronil, Fenvalrate and Quinalphos. Interestingly, the Union Agriculture Ministry, on May 14, issued a draft notification that listed Malathion, Chlorpyriphos, Deltamethrin and Quinalphos among 27 crop protection chemicals whose use is proposed to be banned.  The Civil Aviation Ministry, on May 21, provided conditional exemption for use of drones (remotely piloted aircraft system) by the Directorate of Plant Protection, Quarantine & Storage for aerial surveillance and spraying of anti-locust pesticides.  The standard operating procedures for operation of drones, including dosage and concentration of the insecticides to be applied, will be finalised in the coming week, an official stated. Being relatively light-weight and battery-operated, the pesticides sprayed through unmanned aerial vehicles would require higher active ingredient concentration and lower water volumes than that in the normally-used formulations, he added.",GREEN GRAM DAL (MOONG DAL)

Hike for oilseeds  The highest increase in MSP is proposed for nigerseed (755 per quintal), followed by sesamum (370 per quintal) and urad (300 per quintal).  The increase in MSP for kharif crops is in line with the Union Budget 2018-19 announcement of fixing the MSPs at a level of at least 1.5 times of the all-India weighted average cost of production, aiming at reasonably fair remuneration for the farmers, an official release said.  It added that the expected returns to farmers over their cost of production are estimated to be highest in case of bajra (83%) followed by urad (64%), tur (58%) and maize (53%).  For the rest of the crops, return to farmers over their cost of production is estimated to be at least 50%.  Among cereals, the government increased the support price of bajra by 150 to 2,150 per quintal for this year, while that of ragi has been raised by 145 to 3,295 per quintal and maize by 90 per quintal to 1,850 per quintal for the current year.

(PIB) At the Union Cabinet meeting on Monday. (PIB)  THE UNION CABINET Monday approved an expanded definition of MSMEs, a Rs 50,000 crore Fund of Funds to provide equity support to growth-oriented MSMEs, and Rs 20,000 crore funding support to distressed companies through provision of partial credit guarantee. It also decided that export turnover of companies will not be counted in the limits of turnover for any category of MSME.  Medium enterprises in the manufacturing and services sectors will now include companies with investment of Rs 50 crore in plant and machinery and turnover up to Rs 250 crore, as against the May 13 announcement by the Finance Minister that had set investment and turnover limits at Rs 10 crore and Rs 100 crore, respectively.  Federation of Indian Export Organisations (FIEO) President Sharad Kumar Saraf said enhancement of the turnover limit for medium units is most pragmatic. It will help infuse technology as margins in certain sectors are so low that enhancement in investment in plant and machinery would not have been of much use unless accompanied by an increase in turnover limit to Rs 250 crore. Exclusion of exports from turnover, will benefit a lot of gems and jewellery companies, who would have breached the MSME criteria due to sheer cost of their inputs, he said.  Read | Piyush Goyal: Will achieve $5 trillion economy wont let Covid affect resolve  While the definition of medium enterprises have been widened, Rs 3 lakh crore of collateral free loans to MSMEs announced earlier will be provided through the criteria announced on May 13. The government had announced that emergency credit facility for MSMEs with Rs 25 crore debt outstanding and Rs 100 crore turnover. Banks will provide them additional 20 per cent credit backed by 100 per cent government guarantee against these loans. No change has been made in these criteria.  Gadkari said these changes should kick in from July 1 as the government will amend the law through an Ordinance.  Also Read | One in three small businesses close to winding up, says survey  The Cabinet also approved setting up of a Rs 50,000 crore Fund of Funds to provide equity support to MSMEs, encouraging them to get listed on stock exchanges. Gadkari said this would help growing companies with good track record get equity funding from the government at initial stages, which they can then capitalise while listing on stock exchanges. He said the proposed Fund should also benefit from such eventual listing of the MSMEs. Listing of companies will help free up capital of the Fund which can be further used for equity infusion. This would provide significant equity support to a large number of growth oriented MSMEs. Over the next few years, he hoped that the fund size can rise up to Rs 3 lakh crore.  Another Distressed Asset Fund will be set up to support MSMEs in significant stress, and the corpus of this fund can rise up to Rs 20,000 crore. The government will provide a support of Rs 4,000 crore to the CGTMSE (Credit Guarantee Fund Trust for Micro and Small Enterprises) which will help in facilitating Rs 20,000 crore of subordinate debt to nearly 2 lakh enterprises. Stressed small companies whose loans have been classified as NPAs will be given subordinate debt by banks against a partial credit guarantee provided by the government.  MSMEs, which make up for about 45 per cent of the countrys total manufacturing output, 40 per cent of exports, almost 30 per cent of the national GDP and operate across the value chain  including cycle parts, auto parts, textiles products, toys, hand tools  are stressed due to depleting internal reserves and low visibility of demand. Easing of the lockdown, and support measures provided by the government through banking channels, would help them survive through the slump induced by economic shutdown that has been in force to prevent spread of Covid-19.  Explained | Why are Medium, Small, Micro Enterprises worst hit by Covid-19 lockdown?  For the farm sector, the government announced Minimum Support Prices for kharif season 2020-21, based on recommendation of the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP). The return over cost for these 14 crops ranges from 50 per cent to 83 per cent, the government said. For street vendors, the government said they can avail loans Rs 10,000, repayable in one year monthly instalments. The government will provide interest subsidy of 7 per cent annually on a six-monthly basis on timely/ early repayment of the loan.  In another decision, the Cabinet approved extending the repayment date for short term loans up to Rs 3 lakh for agriculture and allied activities to August 31 from May 31. This will help the farmers to repay/ renew such loans up to the extended repayment date at 4 per cent a year interest without attracting any penalty. Farmers will continue to benefit from the 2 per cent interest subvention and 3 per cent prompt repayment incentive during the extended repayment period.  The MSP for paddy has been increased by Rs 53 a quintal to Rs 1,868 or 2.92 per cent compared with KMS 2019-20. Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar said, Based on the recommendation of the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP), the Union Cabinet has approved MSP of 14 crops. The increase in support price of paddy will ensure 50 per cent return over the cost to the farmers, he said.  The highest increase in MSP (Rs 755 per quintal) was for nigerseed, followed by sesamum (Rs 370 per quintal), urad (Rs 300 per quintal) and long staple cotton (Rs 275 per quintal). The lowest increase, in percentage terms, was for moong (2.07 per cent or Rs 146 per quintal). The MSP for cotton (medium staple) has been increased by Rs 260 per quintal to Rs 5,515 per quintal for 2020-21 from Rs 5,255 per quintal last year.

In a series of tweets, Mr Yechury said that once again the Modi government is relying on falsehoods and spin. The claim is that MSP is increased by an unprecedented 50%. Truth is Increase is measly, less than inflation costs. Burdens on our Annadatas will double. Modi government alone will be responsible for rising tragic distress suicides, he said.  A table comparing the existing MSP with the revised rates that he posted with his tweet reveals that the MSP hike for paddy common is only 2.92%, while grade A paddy has got even less at just 1.8%. MSP rate for moong dal was hiked by 2.07%, for groundnut by 3.65% and for tur dal 3.45%.  General Secretary for Communist Party of India D. Raja said the hike was pointless if the government fails to procure the produce directly from the farmers who are unable to sell because of the extended lockdown.  These are only announcements and nothing else. The farmers have lost a lot because of the pandemic and the lockdown. How will the increased MSP help and whom, if there is no direct procurement? The government should go to the farmers, Mr Raja said.  He also urged the government to give a one-time waiver for all farm loans to tide over the current situation. The government is throwing pittance at the farmers and has failed to save them from a death trap, he said.  Terming the announcements for the MSME sector also as insufficient, Mr. Yechury said.

The incident came to light even as the Shivraj government claimed that it had been able to store 94% of the wheat that was purchased by the state government.  Opposition Congress alleged that lakhs of metric tonnes of wheat was destroyed in untimely rains and said it would release videos of the incident as proof.  Responding to the accusations, Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan said on Friday that 94% wheat was already shifted to storage facilities and added that the MP government has, so far, procured 1.26 crore metric tonnes of wheat. Chouhan asked farmers not to worry and assured them that their harvest would be purchased by the state government. He added that his government has already started their purchase and will meet the target of 100 metric lakh tonnes of wheat.  He further accused the Kamal Nath government of not making proper arrangements of crop procurement when it was in power.  The MP government said that the state witnessed a record wheat procurement this season and added that Rs 16,000 crore has already been transferred to farmers accounts.  The Opposition, however, continued to mount an attack on the government.  ""The MP government has been persistently erring and making egotistic claims on wheat procurement,"" Congress MLA Kunal Chaudhary told News18 on Friday. He added that the party would release videos of the wheat being destroyed in the rains.

Photographs of wheat lying in the open amid rains surfaced from across the state on Thursday.  As rains lashed the state, thousands of farmers lined up at the procurement centres and were seen struggling to protect their harvest which they brought on tractors.

The State government could not so far fulfil the promise to deliver food grains at the door steps of elephant owners though the lockdown has entered its fifth phase. The proposal was to give food grains worth 400 for 40 days for each animal. The Department of Animal Husbandry was entrusted with the task of providing the food for elephants along with domestic animals during the lockdown and 5 crore was allotted for the purpose. The Forest Department had also drawn up a list of 255 elephants eligible for the assistance.  Though the elephant owners were offered food grains, it has not materialised so far, said P.S. Raveendranath, an owner of two elephants.  With no revenue during the lockdown period, the management of animals has turned out to be a prohibitively expensive affair. It requires at least 4,000 a day to maintain an elephant, which feeds on 25 palm fronds and significant quantities of rice, flattened rice and other food stuff every day. The salary of the two mahouts too adds up to the expense, said Mr. Ravindranath.  Elephants need to be fed on time and now it is time to provide them rest and medical treatment. Yet, the promised food has not arrived, said K.S. Sreejith, who manages a few elephants. Each day, an elephant would be fed around 4 kg cooked rice, 2 kg green gram and one kg onions, besides the palm fronds, he said.  At the same time, a few animal rights activists have opposed the proposal and pointed out that captive elephants cannot be bracketed along with domestic animals. Captive elephants were wild animals covered under the Wildlife Protection Act 1972 and its owners were legally bound to provide them food, said M. N. Jayachandran, member, Animal Welfare Board. Any failure to meet the legal obligations would be an offence, he said.  C. Madhu, Director, Department of Animal Husbandry, hoped that the supply of food grains would begin within a fortnight.

In a memorandum to the Odisha State Seeds Corporation (OSSC), the Odisha State Seeds Growers Association said the procurement rate of Rs 84.6 per kg fixed by the State Pricing Committee is almost equal to the market price.  Farmers registered with OSSC for supply of moong seeds prefer to sell their stock in open market rather supplying to the National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India (NAFED) under the price support system.  While the prevailing market price of moong is Rs 80 per kg, the government reduced the procurement price from Rs 92 in 2019-20 to Rs 84.6 a kg for 2020-21.  While asking the states to fix the MSP at a level of at least 1.5 times of the weighted average cost of production, the Centre had advised to provide 30 per cent more than the MSP for pulses seeds to farmers to recover cost.  The farmers spend more on seed production. The existing price is unremunerative as they purchase foundation seeds from the Corporation at a higher cost of Rs 116 per kg, said general secretary of the association Rabi Narayan Mohapatra.

Ready for one more? A Whatsapp collective in Kerala that calls itself The Marasena (The Tree Army) has called for a vegetable challenge that urges people to grow their own greens. For a State such as Kerala, which is hugely dependent on Tamil Nadu and Karnataka for its vegetables, the lockdown is an opportunity to become self-reliant, say the administrators of this 80-member strong group, with participants from all over the State.  To take part, you have to plant the seeds of different vegetables once every three days and post pictures of their progress on the group. The challenge is open to the general public as well. Those who live in independent homes and have a bit of land can take it on easily, says Jayaraj Mitra, an active members of the group. He adds, Every household can grow one drumstick plant, one curry leaf plant and one coriander plant at least.  Lockdown and children  He adds that this lockdown is a time when children can be inducted into the many joys of farming. ""Not just can they see the seed germinating into a plant, they also learn about soil, creatures that live in it and more, he says, adding, The larger message we are trying to send out is that with a little time and patience, one can grow ones own food.  For apartment dwellers who have just a balcony to spare, kitchen gardens are a workable model. You do not need to go rushing out for seeds: green gram and horse gram can be sprouted, and the method does not require soil. Just wrap the grain moist biodegradable paper. (Newspaper is not a great option, as it has printing ink.) In about a week, the leaves would have grown long enough to be cut. They can be used to make a salad or even a thoran (coconut stir-fry). This method takes up little space and is highly efficient. More importantly, it qualifies you for the challenge so you can also take plenty of pictures of your new kitchen counter sprout patch.  The Marasena hopes this challenge will inspire a network of home vegetable growers, who will continue to grow at least some of their own food post lockdown.  How the group was formed  The group traces its roots to an art lovers collective that dabbled in making films too, got actively involved in tree planting initiatives. The idea came about when in the middle of shooting a short film in Thrissur, the host offered the team raw mango juice, made with fruit from his compound. The conversation veered towards planting seeds for future trees. Led by former head of the department of English of NSS College, Ottappalam, Govindan Kutty Kartha and announcer at All India Radio, Thrissur, M Thankamani, the foundations of The Marasena were thus laid.  Tree challenge A school in Edavanakkad, Vypeen, has started a tree challenge. Mooted by the Student Police Cadet (SPC) wing of Sree Dharma Paripalana Yogam Kumara Panicker Memorial High School for its students, the challenge has received an enthusiastic response from the public in general, says KG Harikumar, a Math teacher and one of the co-ordinators of the SPC.  The challenge urges people to plant tree saplings and mail a picture to the school. Students are not regularly posting pictures. This is being done as part of the State-wide tree planting campaign carried out by the SPC. And we thought why not reach out to the public, we have been receiving pictures from older people as well, Harikumar says. He adds, Of all the trees you see around you, how many have you planted? This is what we ask as part of the campaign. If you have planted none, this is your chance.  Invigorated by the idea of planting trees, the members of the group joined hands with the Pookottukavu Panchayat in Palakkad (about 340 km from capital city, Thiruvananthapuram) and planted about one lakh seeds in the Panchayat. The seeds were those collected by the members of the group from different parts of the State. The team then had over 2,000 volunteers from across Kerala.  However, a year later, the group scaled down operations and decided to move over to an online space (Whatsapp). Today, with the core team of 80 members, the The Marasena is a veritable storehouse of information on plants, including technical know-how and maintenance. The group admins plan to compile the information into a book. The ultimate aim is to have an Onasadya with vegetables grown at home, says Jayaraj.",GREEN GRAM DAL (MOONG DAL)

(File Photo/Representational) The challenge is going to be with the crops marketing. (File Photo/Representational)  Even as the 21-day lockdown till April 14 appears set to be extended by two weeks, both the Centre and the states are agreed that the blanket restrictions on production and movement will not apply to farm-related work. Agriculture would, indeed, be the most significant, if not the only, economic activity the country might see at least till the end of this month. The governments focus, too, will now have to be as much on the rabi crops harvesting and marketing as on keeping the war against the novel coronavirus going. But harvesting per se is unlikely to be a problem. The bulk of the mustard, chana (chickpea), masur (red lentil), sugarcane, potato and rabi onions have already been harvested. Its only wheat and some seasonal vegetables (the likes of bottle gourd, okra, brinjal and cucumber) and fruit (mango and melons) that are still in the fields. Harvesting of rabi maize, summer moong (green gram) or even Dasheri, Chaunsa and Langra mangoes will only be after May.  Simply put, harvesting will happen. Farmers will somehow manage, whether by using combines (whose movement and deployment, both inter- and intra-state, has been exempted from the lockdown) or labour (including those forced to return to villages after being rendered jobless in factories and urban centres). The challenge is going to be with the crops marketing. There are two major issues here. The first is the mandis, which are normally a hive of activity at this time, when farmers in thousands bring their trolley-loads of produce to sell. Given the imperative of social distancing, that is ruled out today. Even if farmers were to come, there arent enough labourers in wholesale markets predominantly from states such as Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, who have fled back home  to unload, clean, bag and reload their crop. The second issue is the collapse of demand. With hotels, restaurants, caterers and most agro-processing units shut, the market cannot absorb a bumper crop  a situation similar to that during April-June 2017 post demonetisation. Then, it was lack of cash. Now, it is lack of institutional buyers.  What is the way out? If overcrowding at the mandis is not to be allowed, farmers have to be given some incentive for not bringing their entire harvested crop straight from the field. There is a strong case to give, say, a bonus of Rs 50 over the minimum support price of Rs 1,925 per quintal for wheat that is sold after April 30 and Rs 100 if after May 30. Not only will this enable staggered crop arrivals, there would also be interest savings for the Food Corporation of India through reduced drawdown of cash credit limits. This is also the time for the Narendra Modi government to enact an omnibus law to remove all restrictions on sale, stocking, movement and export of farm produce.

(Express photo) Harvesting in progress in Chandauli, UP. (Express photo)  In early November, the district administration of Chandauli in eastern Uttar Pradesh banned harvester combines, citing a state government order to prevent burning of parali (leftover straw) from the paddy cut by these machines. Panic-stricken farmers approached the district magistrate, who relented after obtaining an assurance that they would not burn any standing stubble after machine-harvesting. The permission came late: Paddy harvesting could start only by early-December, against the normal time from mid-November. And with heavy rains in December 11-13, the crop also suffered extensive damage and grain discolouration. COVID-19 LIVE updates  Now in April, as Chandaulis farmers harvest wheat amid the lockdown, parali and air pollution is hardly an administrative priority. Harvesting wont be a problem. My district alone has over 100 combines, with an equal number coming from outside. We have some 230,000 acres under wheat, nearly three-fourths of which is combine-harvested and the rest manually using sickles. Each machine can do 35-40 acres over 18 hours daily, says Ajay Kumar Singh. The 42-year-old farmer from Emiliya village in Chandauli district and tehsil has planted wheat on 40 acres and summer moong (green gram) on 12 acres, which will be harvested from May.  Dont miss from Expained: 3 hotspots, 3 control models  Singhs worry isnt over harvesting. The authorities have issued passes for the combines and their operators  typically one foreman, two drivers and two helpers. The grain will get cut, but we dont know how it would be marketed. Wheat procurement is usually from around April 10. This time, it may not be before May, he points out.  Echoing the same concern is Rao Gulab Singh Lodhi from Nanhegaon village in Gotegaon tehsil of Madhya Pradeshs Narsinghpur district. He began harvesting his 36 acres of wheat in Wednesday, after having finished with chana (chickpea) and masur (red lentil) on 8 acres each in early March.

While procurement in MP is slated to start from April 15  a delay of over 15 days  he isnt sure if that would help.  The government has declared that it will not purchase more than 13 quintals per acre of wheat from any farmer, with these at 5 quintals each for chana and masur. My own average per-acre yield is 20 quintals in wheat, 12 quintals in masur and 10 quintals in chana. What do I do with the remaining crop, for which there are no takers today? They wants us to increase productivity, but are unwilling to procure our extra grain, adds Lodhi.

For Santosh Gorade, a farmer from Takli Vinchur village in Niphad taluka of Maharashtras Nashik district, that isnt an issue: There are enough labourers in my village. Although the ones in nearby villages may not be able to come due to the lockdown, I can stagger my harvesting.  Gorade plans to harvest his rabi onion on two out of his total 6-acre holding after April 20. Eknath Sanap, from Naigaon village in Nashiks Sinnar taluka, harvested 200 quintals from 1.5 out of his 3 acres last week. He did not find it difficult to get labour, which is largely local.  Dont miss from Explained: How a dollar swap line with US Fed can help in uncertain times  For both farmers, the primary concern is marketing. Rabi onions are amenable to storage in kanda chawls. Farmers generally keep the crop harvested in March-April in these on-field raised platform structures (to prevent moisture ingress that cause the bulbs to sprout) and sell in tranches till September-October. Yes, I can take it to the market later. But what if after lockdown, everybody rushes to sell and the prices crash?, asks Sanap.  Currently, the APMC mandis of Lasalgaon and Pimpalgaon in Nashik are functioning with skeletal staff. Unlike in farms, the labourers at these two big wholesale onion markets  those who unload, clean, bag and reload produce  are mostly from UP and Bihar, who have gone back due to the lockdown.  Read | Provide counselling to migrants: Centre to states  Availability of labour for farm work doesnt seem a constraint even in sugarcane. According to Jitender Singh Hooda, an 8-acre farmer from Kheri Bairagi village of western UPs Shamli district and tehsil, a skilled labourer can harvest, bundle and load 12-14 quintals of cane daily, for which he charges Rs 45/quintal. Four of them can, thus, deliver a full tractor trolley-load of 55-56 quintals for just over Rs 2,500.  The same job  of only harvesting and bundling 12-14 quintals  can also be done by three unskilled labourers. At a daily wage rate of Rs 350, it works out to Rs 4,200 for 56 quintals, plus another Rs 800 for loading on to the farmers trolley. Theres no dearth of labour now, especially the people who have lost their jobs after lockdown. But they have little experience in cane cultivation, explains Hooda.  Read | Three weeks and counting: Stranded and hungry at shut gateway  Hoodas present workforce includes Rakesh, a ladies tailor; Vinod, an electrician; Manoj, a construction labourer; and Krishan Pal, a mender of old jute bags  all previously working in Shamli, Karnal and nearby towns. Technically more skilled than farm hands, they are now being engaged for sugarcane planting as well. Hooda estimates the cost of planting one acre using skilled workers at Rs 4,200. The same with the new less productive persons comes to Rs 6,000 or so, but at least my work gets done.  That harvesting labour isnt a major issue is also borne out by sugar mills in UP crushing 932.08 lakh tonnes (lt) of cane during the current 2019-20 season till Friday. Over 100 lt out of this has been after the lockdown from March 25. Nearly 85% of the seasons projected crushing of 1,100 lt is over. Mills will continue to crush beyond May-end, UPs cane commissioner Sanjay Bhoosreddy told The Indian Express.  Read | In March, people hoarded cash, withdrew four times more than monthly average  For cane growers, the main problem again is in getting money. They have so far supplied cane worth more than Rs 29,800 crore at the UP governments advised price, but received only Rs 15,581 crore. Mills are unable to pay, as there is little offtake of sugar by industrial buyers or of ethanol by oil companies for blending with petrol.",GREEN GRAM DAL (MOONG DAL)

Of the 80 villages/localities, anganwadi centres in 10 areas have not yet provided rations for children between the ages of 0-6 years, during the Corona lockdown. In 70% of the cases, eggs have not been provided and 43.75% of the cases milk has not been provided to children. This report has been submitted to the High Court of Karnataka.  Only 75% of pregnant and lactating women received ration from anganwadis but not the entire quantity. Only 13.75% percent of adolescent girls who suffer from malnutrition get ration from Anganwadis.  Significantly, 73.75% of respondents had not received the Iron/Folic Acid tablets that must be given to pregnant women to counter anemia and safeguard the health of pregnant woman.  Delivery of rations to students under the mid-day meal scheme appeared to be more operational, with only 9 of the 80 surveyed areas reporting that rations through mid day meal schemes were not provided.  ""While the food schemes themselves are functional and most people have received some sort of ration, it is not complete and importantly it will not last till the end of any extended lockdown. The worrying part is children who are malnourished have not got the additional nutrition they need. Karnatakas children already face a huge malnutrition problem. It may become worse because of the lockdown,"" the report stated.  Prof. Y J Rajendra, President, PUCL Karnataka told TNIE,""There is a Supreme Court and Government of India order that you cannot stop food and nutrition services during the lockdown but this has not been complied with by the Education department which handles the mid-day meal scheme and Women and Child Development department which handles nutrition through anganwadis. Food security of the vulnerable has been ignored during this lockdown due to lack of will.""    Disparity in quantity of food and nutrition  There is wide disparity in the quantities provided by Anganwadis ranging from 480 grams rice only in some districts to comprehensive packages of 4.17 kg of nutritional mix of ragi, rice and green gram in other districts, 70 grams milk powder being given in some areas and 500 grams in other area, 1 kg rice and 200 gram dal for pregnant and lactating women in some areas to comprehensive nutritional packages comprising 5.7 kg rice, 228 gram jaggery, 232 grams groundnut, 380 grams tur dal, 190 gram green gram, 380 gram sugarin other areas. In mid-day meals scheme, it was found that some places received 1 kg rice and others 3 kg of rice.    PDS shops demand Aadhar, OTP  In PDS shops, only rice and wheat is distrbuted and not Dal. In 10 cases, shops were not open and in 5 cases they were open but not providing ration.  ""Ration shop owners insisted on Aadhaar and OTP verification even though government said it is not mandatory. Ration cardholders are required to get an OTP by calling the IVRS line, which would be given to the ration shop owner who would then enter it into the in his point of sale (POS) system to give the ration to the cardholder. Persons without mobile phones as also those unable to get OTP due to server problems, bad networks are turned away from the ration shop,"" the report stated.  ""Ration Shop owners force people to pay for the free ration. There is a clamour at almost all ration shops, since people are anxious to get ration resulting in social distancing norms not being followed. People are highly frustrated since except for using the phone to approach authorities and elected representatives, they have no other avenue left and are concerned about the next meal they will receive,"" it added It was complained that some shops mandatarily sold jeera, soap and oil and shop owners would create problems for those people who did not purchase them.",GREEN GRAM DAL (MOONG DAL)

That honour belongs to the humble rasam (meaning: essence). No wonder, then, that rasam has emerged as the most popular dish during COVID-19 lockdown.  Apart from being the simplest dish, one can prepare rasam with minimal ingredients, and it can be had as soup or mixed with rice and eaten. But preparing rasam requires knowledge, expertise and experience, says 64-year-old Usha Prabhakaran, author of the soon-to-be-launched Rasam Digest, a book with 1,000 different rasam recipes.  A lawyer by profession, Usha shot to fame in 1998, when her Pickle Digest, a book with 1,000 pickle recipes, was published. Actually, I collected almost 3000 recipes but I had to pick 1000 [for the book], says Usha, who got the Pickle Queen moniker soon after. Over time, I have developed the knack of extracting recipes from anyone and everyone I come across, adds Usha, who credits her mother-in-law, Chandra Lakshmi, for lighting her passion for cooking, who at the age of 83 still actively engages herself in cooking as well as shopping for ingredients. The nuances I learnt from her but the numerous tips and tricks I gathered over a period of time, Usha says.  The book has sections like Modest Pleasures (rasam from plant stems, leaves and rind-based), Hard to Resist Residual Wonder (rasam made with the residue of chutney or thogayal) and Quick Serves (instant rasam), Dynamic Diet, Heritage Sustenance, Physician at your Door, Dazzling Superstars, among others.  Achieving critical mass  For a perfect rasam, balancing the tamarind (sourness), adding spices and seasoning, which helps lock the flavour in, is critical. Sourness can be derived from tamarind, tomato, sour buttermilk or just dal water, says Usha, adding that rasam fits everyones budget, can be prepared with minimal ingredients, or if one or two of the basic ingredients are not available. Basic ingredients can be interchanged if one is unavailable, like moong dal can be swapped for toor dal. The dish can be prepared, tasted and changed to your desired taste all through the process of cooking. Most importantly, it is a medicinal preparation that plays a significant role throughout an individuals life from birth to old age, says Usha, adding, Which is why I have dedicated a section in the book to age-appropriate rasams, titled Birth to Adulthood.  Rasam can be made out of almost anything. Have you ever tasted pea peel rasam, or betel leaf rasam? How about jamoon rasam? Did you know that we can make rasam using jackfruit seed, watermelon rind, kodukkapuli, hibiscus flower and bamboo shoot?, she asks.  Even peels and plant stems, which are usually discarded, can be used. When we were in Kerala, our domestic helper used to collect banana peels and take it home. Out of curiosity, I asked her what she would do with them, and that is how I learnt to make banana peel rasam. Similarly, keera thandu, murunga keera and agathi keera lend themselves well for the dish. Rasam made with stems of mint, coriander and curry leaves will taste heavenly, says Usha.  Kicking up flavours  Ingredients to garnish ought to be added to ghee in a particular order. Once the ladle is hot with oil, add the urad. When it turns light brown and gives out aroma, add the mustard. As it starts to splutter, add red chillies, fenugreek seeds, cumin and curry leaves (in that order) and then pour it over the rasam. Thaalippu or garnish is the crown, so it has to be perfect, she says. If it gets burnt, just discard it and redo. In some families, they sprinkle a little water after garnishing and this is to lock the flavour.  Ushas rasam podi recipe:  Ingredients    200 gms each of Tanjore (gundu), Salem (neetu) and Bedige chillies  600 gms coriander seeds  200 gms each of pepper, jeera and fenugreek  1/4 of LG asafoetida bar  6 to 10 turmeric sticks  10 sprigs of sun-dried curry leaves  2 large fistfuls toor dal  1 fistful moong dal (optional)  1 fistful urad dal  1 fistful channa dal  Method  Sun-dry the ingredients and grind them to medium coarse in a mill.  While assembling the dish, crushing curry leaves, tomato and coriander leaves together with crystal salt and tamarind water brings out the best flavour. A slit green chilli and a blob of jaggery enhance the taste, she adds. Usha also notes that rasam is best made using an eeya chombu (a vessel made out of tin-aluminium alloy that has a broad base and narrow neck), clay pot or soapstone pot.  The eeya chombu is designed in such a manner that the aroma and flavour rotate within the vessel when it is mixed with a ladle, she says, adding a word of caution, Never use cast iron to make rasam. Another important trick is assembling the rasam. You got to crush curry leaves, tomato and coriander leaves with crystal salt along with tamarind water to get that magical taste and flavour, and this comes with practice.  Usha has listed wide range of rasam podi recipes in her book. Now coming to rasam podi, Usha insists that sun drying all the ingredients will result in aromatic rasam. The rule can be relaxed and ingredients roasted in a pan only during rainy days. Depending on usage, rasam podi can be stored for upto six months. Another reason why some never get it right is they might let the preparation boil over and this might ruin the flavour. When it is about to boil, switch off, garnish and close immediately. Use only ghee for garnishing as ghee acts as the vehicle for absorbing the goodness of the spices used. And the rasam connoisseur that she is, she insists she has prepared each of the 1,000 rasams in her book at least five times.  The book is targeted at Indian and international audiences, and has a detailed description of all 350 ingredients with a photograph, its medicinal value, taste and usage. I have also provided tips on how to buy and store these ingredients.  Adirasam delight  A rasam connoisseur would always go for Adi rasam or the mandi, which is nothing but what settles at the bottom of the vessel. Once you understand the value of mandi, you will never miss it. The best way to serve rasam is to give it a good mix with a ladle and then serve it.  Regional fare  The herbal concoction predominantly made in Southern states is called Rasam in Tamil Nadu. Chaaru in Andhra and Saaru in Konkan and Karnataka, the preparation usually an everyday affair is an essential part of the South Indian cusine.  Seasonal Rasam  Gita Rajamani, a food blogger whose You Tube channel, Agrahara Recipes, documents tradtional vegetarian recipes handed over from generations says that each of the spices has healing properties and is essentially facts as an immunity booster. Rasam preparation in households depends on the season, for example during the rainy season Jeera Milagu Rasam and Milagu rasam is the staple.  During the Covid 19 crisis, the septuagenarian recommends Kandanthippili and Sadakuppai rasam, which is a remedy for fever, cold and cough. As it is easily digestible, rasam is suitable for people of all age groups, and for diabetic population, she recommends Goddu rasam or the mild rasam with minimal ingredients and buttermilk rasam.  Nutritious Konkani Saaru  Food blogger Divya Kudua, who specialises in Kerala and Konkani cuisine, says that in Kerala rasam never takes the centrestage, but is always a mild concoction made using jeera and pepper, usually served as an after meal digestive drink. In Konkani cuisine Saaru is prepared using the tamarind, dal and coconut.  Usually on Fridays we make Channa water rasam, which is more like a soup and not necessarily mixed with rice and eaten. Saaru as we call it, is a nutritious dish suitable for all age groups, says Divya.  Instagram@divyakudua  Raw, no fuel  In Andhra and Telangana region, there are numerous variations of Chaaru (rasam). Depending on the region, the ingredients that goes into this spiced up broth varies, says Chef Thimma Reddy, The Park, Hyderabad.. He observes that the usage of garlic is high in these states, and more red chillies are used in the place of pepper corns. Considered a poor mans food, the dishs highlight is the garnishing, he says.  His favorite is the Pacchi Pulusu, which does not require cooking and is raw. Pacchi pulusu can be prepared in a jiffy, and the most important aspect is the mixing of all the ingredients in the tamarind water with ones hands  Ingredients:  100 grams Tamarind  25 grams Green chilli  00 grams Onion  10 grams Curry leaves  10 grams Coriander leaves  10 grams Jaggery  25 ml Oil  10 grams Cumin seeds  10 grams Dry red chilli  Salt to taste  500 ml Water  Method: Soak tamarind for 30 minutes in water, squeeze and extract the pulp. Slit the green chilli, roast on direct flame until it darkens and skin it off. Roughly crush all the ingredients, roasted chilli, onion, coriander using mortar and pestle. In a bowl, add water, tamarind pulp, jaggery, crushed ingredients and salt to taste. Tempering: Heat the oil, add cumin seeds, dry red chilli and curry leaves, pour the tempering over the raw tamarind rasam and mix well.

Though districts have registered a good harvest of pulses and oilseeds, less than 1,000 farmers have registered their names with primary agriculture cooperative societies (PACS) and large area multi-purpose cooperative societies (LAMPS) for sale of surplus produce under minimum support price announced by the Government.  As per report submitted by Odisha State Marketing Cooperative Federation (MARKFED), the nodal agency for procurement of oilseeds and pulses in the State, only 913 farmers have registered their names with 164 PACS/LAMPS covering 16 districts. It does not augur well for us though you are well aware of the fact that the date line for farmers registration under PSS (price support system) operation during rabi-2020 expires on May 7, said a letter from Registrar of Cooperative Societies to deputy RCS in the identified districts.  What has surprised the Cooperation department is farmers registration is abysmally low despite relaxation of lockdown norms for agricultural activities. Farmers registration in six divisions of Balasore, Dhenkanal, Berhampur, Kalahandi, Khurda and Sundargarh was nil till May 1. There are two reasons. After relaxation of norms, farmers are busy harvesting rabi crops, including paddy. The second reason is that PACS/LAMPS are not taking interest to reach out to farmers, informed sources said.  The Centre has approved State Government proposal for procurement of 14,121 tonnes of green gram at `7,050 support price, 5,425 tonnes of groundnut pods at `5,090 and 8,750 tonne of sunflower seeds at `5,650 while quantity of black gram has not been finalised, its support price has been set at `5,700 per quintal.  The procurement period allowed by the Centre is 90 days, beginning May 7 to August 5. MARKFED has been declared as the State-level supporter to procure fair average quality of seeds on behalf of National Agriculture Cooperative Marketing Federation through PACS and LAMPS. The State Government has directed the field staff of Cooperation department to expedite the process of registration so that maximum farmers can reap the benefit of price support system.",GREEN GRAM DAL (MOONG DAL)

Till then, his holiday destination had reported only two cases of coronavirus. While on the trip, they were informed that Indians there were not allowed to return to their own country. Since then, the family has been stranded. After being unable to avail hotel accommodation, they rented an apartment in Turkey and have been living there since.  Amit is among the 200 Indians or more who have been stuck in Turkey for more than a month now, as the number of confirmed cases of coronavirus there exceed 1,50,000, as per reports.

Meanwhile medical supplies they carried from India for the elderly parents have been exhausted, so now they have to pay double the price to purchase the medicines. Our average daily expenditure amounts to 100-110 dollars, he said.  While the Ministry of Civil Aviation announced evacuation flights as part of the Vande Bharat Mission to bring back stranded Indians, Turkey is yet to make it to the list of the countries, even in the second phase of the operation (scheduled for May).

Chandrasekhar Rao has expressed his happiness over farmers in the State agreeing to follow the regulated crop cultivation system as suggested by the government.  The government brought in regulated crop cultivation to promote crops that have market demand and thereby make agriculture profitable to the farmers and it got good support from the entire farming community, he said.  Mr. Chandrasekhar Rao directed the officials to extend Rythu Bandhu assistance immediately as farmers were ready to comply with the governments policy. The agricultural operations have already started and farmers should not face any problems for investment amount. The Rythu Bandhu investment assistance should be credited to the accounts of farmers within one week to 10 days, he said and called upon the farmers to speed up agricultural activities by utilising the amount.  Chief Minister has directed the officials to prepare an agricultural plan for yasangi season too just like the way they prepared the plan for vaanakalam in a review meeting held on implementation of regulated crop cultivation and Rythu Bandhu schemes here on Monday with Agriculture Minister, officials and CMO officials.  He reviewed the district-wise cultivation patten and examined the reports sent by the district agricultural officers and expressed satisfaction that the cultivation was going as per the directions of the government. Officials informed him that so far sowing of seeds was done in 11 lakh acres for various crops as suggested by the government. Farmers purchased seeds accordingly, said officers of the Seed Corporation.  Overall regulated crop cultivation was being followed in over 1.25 crore acres by farmers and of this paddy was being raised in 41,76,778 acres, red gram in 12,31,284 acres, soyabean in 4,68,216 acres, cotton in 60,16,079 acres, jowar in 1.53 lakh acres, green gram in 1.88 lakh acres, blackgram in 54,121 acres, castor in 92,994 acres, ground nut in 41,667 acres, sugarcane in 67,438 acres, and other crops in 54,353 acres, officers told the Chief Minister.  He said farming community of Telangana responded very well to the governments advice and they were convinced that it was for their own good. Farmers had taken the first step and in the coming days, government would give more support to the farmers. This is a good beginning for reaching the objective, he said.  Though the State was facing financial crisis, government decided to give Rythu Bandhu amount of 5,000 per acre for vaanakalam season requiring 7,000 crore. Government already transferred 5,500 crore to the Agriculture department and the Finance department was directed to credit another 1,500 crore within a week, Mr. Chandrasekhar Rao said.  The Chief Minister said with the inspiration of vaanakalam planning, officers should also be ready with the agricultural plan for yasangi season and give guidance to the farmers on what crops to be raised in what extent and also provide seeds of those crops to the farmers.  Last yasangi, crops were raised in 53.5 lakh acres and this year, because of more irrigation projects providing water, additional 10 lakh to 12 lakh acres could be cultivated. The crops that were not advised for vaanakalam should be be raised for yasangi like maize in about seven lakh acres apart from paddy in 45 lakh acres, bengal gram in 4 lakh acres, ground nut in 5 lakh acres, vegetables in 1.5 lakh acres.",GREEN GRAM DAL (MOONG DAL)

The government scheme Mera pani-meri virasat has attracted many farmers of Sirsa block, which is one of eight paddy-rich blocks in Haryana, where the groundwater level has dipped below 40 metres.  Farmers who have opted for crop diversification in place of paddy in Haryanas Sirsa district say they have chosen the scheme to conserve water for future generations even though they may face financial loss with the shifting of crops in their fields.  The government scheme Mera pani-meri virasat has attracted many farmers of Sirsa block, which is one of eight paddy-rich blocks in Haryana, where the groundwater level has dipped below 40 metres. Of 9,182 farmers who have diversified to other crops in place of paddy in these eight blocks, 3,809 farmers belong to Sirsa block.  The Manohar Lal Khattar led BJP-JJP government offers an incentive of Rs 7,000 per acre to farmers who shift to alternative crops from paddy, apart from assuring them for procurement of their new crops. According to Haryana government figures, as many as 85,992 farmers have applied to opt for alternative crops in place of paddy across 89,118 hectares in the state till now. Among the alternative crops, cotton is the farmers first preference, followed by bajra, horticulture, maize and pulses in the state.  In Sirsa block, farmers with tubewells would prefer paddy, but this was leading to depletion of groundwater levels. In the cotton belt of Sirsa, we had moved to paddy keeping in view its high productivity. But the government has offered an amazing scheme at a time when the groundwater is depleting fast. So, I have decided to move to cotton, bajra, moong and jowar from paddy in my all 10 acres, says Raja Ram, a farmer from Shahpur Begu village.  The 60-year-old farmer said that the land will turn barren if they continue to sow paddy in large chunks of land in the state. I will cultivate cotton in a major portion of my land because with this I will be able to cultivate one more crop (moong) in the same area. In this way, I will try to earn as much I used to earn from paddy.  However, another farmer, Krishan Lal, believes his earnings may come down after crop diversification. Out of his four acres, Lal will cultivate cotton in two acres and moong in one acre in place of paddy. We are ready to face losses to save water for future generations. Although, I must say that this will affect many farmers financially. The profit from cotton or any other crop isnt the same as the profit was from paddy, and these crops may not even be successful in the blocks with hard soil. As of now, I have not received any funding from the government, said Lal.  Sources say the first installment of the financial incentive is released after verification of the farmers claims for crop diversification.  A young farmer, Nishant Punia, a Masters degree holder in civil engineering, has decided to move to cotton in his all seven acres of land. In terms of finances, there is a huge gap between the earnings of paddy and cotton. I used to earn almost Rs 80,000 per acre which will reduce to Rs 50,000 per acre now, said Punia, a resident of Mandana village of Sirsa district.  He further said, During monsoon season, accumulation of water in low areas of hard land will create problems in crops other than paddy. Though, I am lucky because my land lies on higher ground.  A law graduate, Manoj Kumar, whose family has 40 acres of land, suggests simplifing the procedure to get benefits under the mera pani-meri virasat scheme. According to Kumar, he will move to cotton from paddy in one third of his total land holding.  There is a gap in the earnings of paddy and other crops at the rate of around 20,000 per acre. The financial incentive offered by the government and the lower cost of cultivation of cotton may help in bridging this gap, he adds.  If groundwater depletion continues at its current pace, the situation will be scary after 15-20 years. The government scheme appears to be an attempt to make people aware about the current scenario. With this scheme, water would be optimised wisely, and the environment will also be preserved.",GREEN GRAM DAL (MOONG DAL)

But when it comes to keeping these illnesses at bay or getting a cure, your diet plays an important role. Celebrity nutritionist Rujuta Diwekar recently shared nani ke nushkhe or some home remedies you can rely on to alleviate cough, cold and flu.  Local ingredients, seasonal produce, spices and ghee have been the backbone of our food traditions, especially when one is under the weather or recovering from a flu, Diwekar wrote on Instagram.  Heres what she suggested:  * Ghee, dry ginger powder, turmeric and jaggery mixed in small amounts and rolled into small balls. This is the first thing you should eat in the morning and the last thing before bedtime. Studies have shown that curcumin in turmeric has anti-microbial properties, and reduces symptoms of cold and flu. Jaggery, on the other hand, boosts immunity and helps control body temperature while ginger has several medicinal properties and is known to soothe cough and ward off feelings of nausea which may accompany cold or flu.  Jaggery helps boost immunity. (Source: getty images) Jaggery helps boost immunity. (Source: getty images)  * For breakfast, have ragi porridge or dosa. Ragi is high in dietary fibre and antioxidants.

Ask for corona tea to get a shot of the hot decoction laced with a mix of ginger, basil leaves, turmeric, cloves, cardamom and lime juice.  Yes, the corona tea, so named only to be in tune with the current times by the aboriginal women members of the Bheembai Adivasi Mahila Sahakara Sangham, Utnoor, is among the latest additions to the menu. The group is among the few entities not only to remain unscathed by the ill effects of lockdown but to be back in the business with a bang.  On June 29, project officer of Integrated Tribal Development Agency (ITDA), Utnoor, Bhavesh Mishra inaugurated the new items on the menu of Adivasi Aaharam, the traditional Adivasi snack of former united Adilabad district, the garkang made of urad (black gram) and moong (green gram) called udupul garkang and pesal garkang respectively besides the jonna ghato or jowar cooked as rice and the corona tea. Since the last one year, the unit had specialised only in making of the now popular snacks like laddus out of dry mahua or ippa flowers.  The garkang will be sold in retail at the Adivasi Aaharam and is likely to be purchased by the aboriginal people themselves. The garkang is an essential item used in traditional pujas twice every month in ethnic homes, pointed out Kumra Bagubai, president of the Bheembai group.  The laddus, which also help in improving immunity in individuals, will now be served in anganwadis and schools under the four ITDAs in the State, going by what Mr. Mishra had to say to Kumra Vittal Rao, the manager of the Centre for Collective Development, an NGO facilitating ethnic women in getting started up and marketing their products.

Though the Bheembai group sources its raw material, the dry mahua flowers, from select farmers in the area, it will also purchase it from the Girijan Cooperative Corporation.

The ageold Tamil proverb translates to The beauty of your mind reflects on your face. My grandmother Santha T would reiterate this to anyone who sought skincare tips from her, including me. Someone who is not very fond of modern skincare routines, ammachi was the happiest person when the wellness stores and beauty parlours that I used to frequent shut shop during the lockdown. Finally! You cant dodge us now.  You are left with no option but to make the best use of the hand pound shikakai and nalangu maavu powder that your mother and I have been using for several years, she quipped. This wasnt the first time she tried to coax me into using homemade products. Every time a conversation on this topic began, shed get transported to her childhood days when her grandmother was particular about everything being made from scratch at home. Kajal, liquid bindi (saandhu pottu), shampoo, bath powder...name it and you will find them being freshly-made in the backyard every month and stored in tin jars.  We had separate grinding stones for body products and cooking. My two sisters and I would pluck the required flowers, twigs and leaves from the neighbourhood for the preparation based on grandmas instructions. There was no nail polish but marudhani (mehendi), coconut oil was our hair conditioner, green gram powder and kasturi manjal (turmeric) was our daily bath powder, and shikakai was our shampoo. We used ripe ridge gourd as a body scrub. There was no soap case but only dried coconut shells. The healthy practices during early days influence the condition of your skin in later stages. Greying of hair started very late for me, Ive never had rashes, pimple or acne and most importantly Im immune to all sorts of allerg i e s, reminisced my grandmother.  Grandma knows best  A few days into the lockdown, grandmothers closely-guarded skincare recipes that can be quickly whipped up at home started floating about in social media. I was pleasantly surprised to find pictures of a few women flaunting their healthy skin after taking the greener route. One among them was Pranitha Mahesh. The 25-yearold freelance singer used to shuttle between cities regularly for music gigs. Her skin used to be buried under layers of concealer for more than eight hours a day. The past few months has come as a muchneeded pick-me-up for her skin.  I have sensitive skin. Unfortunately, only a few beauty products are available with organic ingredients while the rest contain harmful chemicals. I developed mild acne because of these products. My nails turned yellowish as I would never give them the breathing space. I had hair fall because of frequent use of straighteners and hair gels. My lips were always chapped because of constant use of lipsticks. I never got the me-time because of my hectic schedule, says Pranitha, who feels more happy in her skin these days without having to wear make-up. Pranitha used her free time to declutter her dressing table and got rid of the unwanted and expired make - u p products.  Amma has written down a few natural recipes passed on to her by her mother and mother- in-law. From day one, I started applying a paste of milk cream and turmeric for my dry skin and acne every morning. I washed my hair twice a week after soaking and massaging it with a mixture of coconut oil, castor oil, vitamin E and almond oil. Rice starch works as a great conditioner for my hair. Rice flour works as an excellent skin scrub. I applied kasturi manjal and could feel a drastic reduction in the pace of my facial hair growth. My nails are healthy without nail polish now. Everything is taken care of by ingredients available at home. Im not sure if I will go back to hoarding make-up like before, shares Pranitha.  Mindful makeover  For beginners who are contemplating on making a switch, the Internet throws numerous such natural and homemade remedies at you and that can get overwhelming. How does one keep a tab on whats genuine and what is not? The main point is, what works for one skin type may not work for everyone. Vidya Gogul, who has been practicing sustainable body care for the past eight years, suggests that one needs to keep the mind open to explore options but with caution.  Be selective. Choose the most easiest method available keeping in mind your allergens. Sometimes you just need to look around your house or garden. You will chance upon many natural substitutes. Thats how I gave up on storebought cosmetics and theres no looking back. Of course, if you have a medical condition then it would be best to consult a dermatologist, explains Vidya. From hair oil to face packs, she prepares everything at home with her farm produce. She also has an Instagram page called Karuveppilai Tales where she shares body care tips .  I got all these ideas from my grandmother. Bad breath, black heads, yellowing of teeth, skin tan...she had a simple solution for everything. One of my favourites is potato paste. I use it as an afterglow face mask and as a facial bleach agent. No fruit from my kitchen would go waste. I collect all the fruit peels such as orange, lemon, papaya...dry and grind them to make a face powder. Simplest of the lot is granulated sugar and water that can be used as a lip scrub. Something as basic as sandalwood and stone, which was traditionally available in every household, has been forgotten.  Thats the best for your skin especially to reduce heat boils and pimples. Natural skin care doesnt give you instant relief as its a slow process. Theres no harm in trying because they will not affect your skin in any way. This is the best time to experiment options and see what works for you, says Vidya. In a few households like Usha Mohans, the traditional recipes are followed religiously. To date, she sun-dries the necessary ingredients to prepare nalangu maavu and shikakai for her daughters and grandchildren. She prepares them once in three months. The satisfaction that we get in using our own, hand-ground powder is irreplaceable.  Preparing them at home isnt an easy process but it works out to be pocket- friendly. Will you not buy the same powders if they were packed in glass bottles with fancy labels or when suggested to you by an Ayurveda doctor? Its all in the mindset. For anything to work effectively it has to be used moderately. Your previous generation is an example that these remedies actually worked wonders so you can all try them confidently. The earlier your children get habituated the longer they will stick to these practices, says the homemaker. Even when you did not have access to your favourite charcoal face mask and keratin hair mask in the last few months, the humble green gram powder and turmeric came to your rescue. Its time to reflect, weigh on the pros and cons, and make a wise, sustainable switch for a beautiful skin.  Hair oil  Ingredients  Regular coconut oil: 50 ml,  Curry leaves: a few sprigs,  Tulasi: a few sprigs, Neem: a  few leaves  Method  Heat coconut oil. Add curry leaves, tulasi and neem.  Let it heat together for a few minutes. Let it cool.  Filter and transfer it to a bottle.  Apply it every night before sleep.  by Vidya Gogul  Nalangu maavu bath powder  Ingredients  Green gram: 50 g,  Besan powder: 50 g,  Kasturi manjal: 50 g  Method  Dry the ingredients in the sun for two days. Grind them separately and mix them. Store them in airtight containers  Take a spoon of it and mix with water.  Apply before bath, leave it for 15 minutes and wash it.  This works effectively on everyone  right from kids to elders.  It gives instant glow. This is haldi used in marriage functions.   by Usha Mohan  Bindi  Ingredient  Barley or rice flour: 50 g, Water  Method  Saute either barley or rice in tawa for a few minutes.  It will turn black in heat. Let it cool.  Mix with water and use it as bindi.  by Santha T  Shikakai  Ingredients  Shikakai seeds or soap-pod: 100 g,  Fenugreek: 50 g  Method  Dry them in the sun for two days and grind them.  Apply on hair or skin for 15 minutes and wash it away.  QUICK TIPS  A ground mixture of dried mint and rock salt works against bad breath and as a teeth whitener.  Grind and store any kind of homemade powder in small batches in air-tight containers or they may attract fungal growth.  Lemon juice, honey and sandalwood works as a tan remover.  Vitamin E and rose water come handy as a face mist.  Curd is a good hair conditioner.  Kajal preparation  Santha T tells us how kajal used to be prepared at her home. My grandmother extracted the juice of karisalankanni and soaked pieces of white cloth in this juice. This was left to dry under the sun. Later,  the cloth would be made into thin thread for lighting lamps. Shed fill the lamp with castor oil, place the  thread inside and light it. A mud pot would be placed over it. With time, the soot settles inside the pot. After letting it cool, she would apply castor oil or butter to the soot and scrape it to extract the kajal.

Dinnaz, a fitness expert, says: Some popular bean varieties included in Indian diet are black-eyed beans (lobia), chickpeas (white and black), Moong (whole), Black masoor, Rajma (white and red), double beans and others. Beans are heavier than a bowl of dal (lentils), and it fills you up faster. Beans are full of fibre, protein and vitamins and is a whole meal by itself.

And they did not prepare the Halwa just by using the traditional ingredients of Sooji (semolina), Aata (wheat flour) or Besan (gram flour). They were concocted by some very peculiar ingredients like papaya, singadha (water chestnut), bottle gourd, pumpkin, watermelon, almond, moong daal, and what not! No matter how much fights we kids had among ourselves or the amount of chaos we used to create in the house, the Halwa used to bring us all together as one collected entity of sweet lovers.Yes, this is what the dish means to all of us. Halwa occupies some part of our memory and consciousness and it has something in it for everyone.The word halwa comes from the Arabic word Hulw, which means sweet and is believed to have entered the English language between 1840 and 1850. As per Guzishta Lucknow by Abdul Halim Sharar, a 20th century author and historian, Halwa originated in Arabic lands and came to India via Persia. This original Middle Eastern dessert was made from date paste and milk.In her book Feasts and Fasts, Colleen Taylor Sen writes that the Halwa arrived in India during the Delhi Sultanate, from the early 13th to the mid-16th century. As per some other legends, the method of cooking Halwa has its roots in the Ottoman Empire. Suleiman, the tenth and longest reigning Sultan of the Empire, was so fond of desserts that he had a separate kitchen for only sweet dishes, Halwa being one of them.As per findings by food historians, the first known recipe of Halwa appeared in the 13th century Arabic text, Kitab al-Tabikh (The Book of Dishes) written by Muammad ibn al-asan Ibn al-Karm. It mentions eight different varieties of Halwa and their recipes. Also, two of the earliest Indian cities to have Arab influence were the coastal towns of Karachi and Kozhikode and thus, Halwa forms an integral part of food traditions in these cities.Today, there are numerous varieties of Halwa available all across the country. Hari Mirch ka Halwa from Pune, Cholar Dal Halwa from West Bengal, Anda Halwa from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, Kashi Halwa from Karnataka, Karutha Haluwa from Kerala, are some of the few assortments of Halwas that one could get in India. One much loved variant is Gajar ka Halwa. Carrots were indigenous to Afghanistan and found their way to India through Dutch. They began to be grown in Punjab and were later experimented with, which gave result in the form of Gajar ka Halwa.Even though the origin of Halwa could be traced back to Arabia, it could not be more Indian than it already is.

But, the government had something to cheer as the acreage of maize was far short of 3.69 lakh acres as on date last year, according to the weekly bulletin released by the Agriculture Department on Wednesday. Sources said the bank accounts of maize farmers were credited with the investment support of  5,000 an acre despite a strong warning to them. With at least 15 rainy days so far in Telangana since the monsoon struck the State on June 10, the agricultural operations have picked up so much that they were double the area covered by this time last year. A minimum of 2.5 mm rain in a day is considered rainy day in Agriculture Department parlance. The area covered by all crops so far was 63.18 lakh acres against 37.36 lakh acres as on date last year.  Agriculture Secretary and Commissioner B. Janardhan Reddy said rain was consistent, uniform and staggered. Except Nirmal district which received less than average rainfall, there were 25 districts that had excess rainfall, and six districts normal. The area of coverage has also doubled for almost all the principal crops, including paddy, cotton and red gram. Paddy was in transplantation stage for 3.85 lakh acres against 1.26 lakh acres by this time last year. The red gram was 6.87 lakh acres against 3.35 lakh acres and cotton 45.02 lakh acres against 24.22 lakh acres last year. The doubling had eluded soyabean as it was sown over 3.63 lakh acres against 2.10 lakh acres last year.  Among the other major crops that had high rate of sowing was jowar with 88,134 acres against 49,523 acres, and green gram at one lakh acres against 67,838 acres.  Meanwhile, the Agriculture Department officers huddled into a virtual conference on Tuesday to discuss promotion of seed cultivation in villages. Called seed village concept, the programme envisages supplying foundation seed of paddy and red gram for mass cultivation.

The monsoon has been satisfactory with Kalaburagi district recording 168 mm rainfall as against a normal average of 122 mm from June 1 to July 5.  As much as 59 % of the targeted area for kharif crops, both in rain-fed and irrigated areas, has already been covered in the district.  According to the Department of Agriculture, farmers have completed sowing in more than 4,43,823 hectares of farmland against a fixed target of 7,55,130 hectares for the season.  Among foodgrains, pulses dominated the scenario with farmers completing sowing in 3.64 lakh hectares (60 %) of land against a target of 6.12 lakh hectares.  Sowing of black gram has been taken up in 27,686 hectares against a targeted area of 29,800 hectares (93 %) and green gram has been taken up in 50,482 hectares against a targeted area of 49,100 hectares (103 %).

For the first time in Karnataka, farmers of Navalgund in Dharwad district have come together to form a company which has now taken the first step towards mass seed production.  The story is of Farmer Producer Organisation (FPO) from Navalgund, which has now initiated mass seed production by taking up seed cultivation across 50 acres, with the help of its member farmers. To facilitate the same, it has now taken the shape of Kalmeshwara Farmer Producer Company Ltd., the first FPO in Karnataka to become a Certified Seed Producer. In this experiment, the FPO is being supported by Hubballi-based Deshpande Foundation and National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) and with technical support and basic quality seed supply from the University of Agricultural Sciences (UAS), Dharwad.  This is an initiative to produce good quality seeds by farmers to supply other farmers. It will also facilitate seed growers to earn more and to meet the quality seed demand even to unreached areas, Chandrashekharaswamy M.T., Programme Manager, Deshpande Foundation told The Hindu. Unlike before, when the farmers used to store best seeds for the next sowing, today they are dependent on private seed companies and farm universities for seeds, which is not a good for the sector.  Recently, at a meeting held at UAS-Dharwad, Special Officer (Seeds) of UAS-D J.S. Hilli, Seed Production Officer Vijayakumar, Deputy Director (Seed Certification) Laxmanamurthy of KSSOCA, District Development Manager of NABARD Sheela Bandarkar, Agriculture Initiatives Director Innus Khan, and others discussed the strategic planning on seed production under the initiative. In the pilot, green gram (variety DGGV-2) is being grown for seed production on 50 acres. Through the initiative we want to make farmers self-dependent in terms of quality seeds, Mr. Chandrashekharaswamy said.  The Kalmeshwara FPCL has 1,034 shareholders. After purchasing certified seed from UAS Dharwad, the same was been to farmers for seed production and sowing was completed. The plan is to produce around 200 quintals of green gram seeds in the first attempt.  As per the present arrangement, scientists from UAS-D and officials of the Karnataka State Seed and Organic Certification Agency (KSSOCA) will visit the fields three to four times for assistance and guidance. Subsequently, quality testing will be done.  Long back we used to produce seeds on our own. But gradually it stopped. Now, through our own company, we are set to produce seeds for ourselves, 60-year-old farmer Nagappa Yavagal, who is also director of KFPCL, told The Hindu.  Initially, 17 farmers have been given foundation and breeder seeds for cultivation. Foundation seeds were sown on 30 acres and breeder seeds on 20. Manjunath Yankappa Dibbad, 53, has been getting seeds and fertilisers through the Kalmeshwara FPO for three years and is one of the shareholders. This is the first time that I have taken up seed production which will take around 100 days. Its our company and we are hopeful of a better price, he said.",GREEN GRAM DAL (MOONG DAL)

In as many as 21 blocks, which are known as dark zones, tubewells are not allowed to be installed. Groundwater has been over-exploited in more than half of Haryana. In as many as 21 blocks, which are known as dark zones, tubewells are not allowed to be installed.  The Haryana government hopes to save 12 per cent water this crop season, with farmers applying to shift to alternatives to the water-guzzling paddy, like cotton, bajra and maize in over 2.86 lakh acres under the government scheme mera pani-meri virasat, this year.  It is a matter of great satisfaction that farmers have given their consent for growing alternative crops other than paddy in over around one lakh hectare (2.47 lakh acres) of land. Around 12-13 per cent water will be saved this way, Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar told Union Minister of Jal Shakti Gajendra Singh Shekhawat in a recent video conference. Paddy is cultivated in about 30 lakh acres in the state.  Haryana Additional Chief Secretary Sanjeev Kaushal told The Indian Express Wednesday that their estimate of how much water is expected to be saved is based on calculations of irrigation department officials and agriculture university experts.  This includes water savings from all sources including canal and underground water which is pumped through tubewells for the paddy crop.  However, an official of the agriculture department cautioned to wait till July-end, when the transplantation of basmati variety of paddy will conclude.  The alternative crops require 80 per cent less water than the needs of paddy cultivation. This way, there will be less consumption of electricity too because of shifting of area to alternative crops from paddy areas. The government will be able to save a subsidy amount which is offered to farmers to supply electricity for tubewells, said the official. The state has around 8 lakh tubewells.  Groundwater has been over-exploited in more than half of Haryana. In as many as 21 blocks, which are known as dark zones, tubewells are not allowed to be installed. In total, there are 64 blocks, where groundwater has been over-exploited because of tubewells installed to irrigate paddy and wheat crops.  To produce a kg of rice, according to officials, there is a requirement of 2,000-5,000 litres of water depending upon the soil type and time of paddy sowing. Maize requires irrigation only 4 times during a crop season, even less if there are sufficient rains, whereas rice requires 40-45 irrigation in general.  However, the official said that assessing the real picture will take time, because as of now, farmers have only applied to shift to alternative crops from paddy.  Its yet to be seen how many farmers actually shift to alternative crops. We will be able to confirm the figures only after completing physical verification of the land of farmers concerned.  With the available figure, one thing is clear that the farmers returning to cotton and bajra mostly comprise those who had opted for paddy a few years back.  The farmers of paddy-rich areas will not leave the paddy cultivation too early because they earn considerable savings from this crop because of available water resources including groundwater and canals, said another official.  Under the mera pani- meri virasat scheme, the farmers are offered Rs 7,000 acre as an incentive for opting crop diversification.  Farmers face difficulties in selling alternative crops  However, Bhartiya Kisan Union president Gurnam Singh Chaduni said farmers face difficulties in selling alternative crops.  Nobody is ready to purchase maize at the rate of government fixed Minimum Support Price (MSP) of Rs 1,760 per quintal. Farmers are forced to sell their produce at the rate of Rs 1,100 per quintal to private players. If there is no smooth procurement of alternative crops, how will the farmers be ready to leave paddy cultivation? asked Chaduni.  Echoing similar sentiments, Mandeep Nathwan, a farmer leader from Fatehabad district, said, The cultivators of moong crop are also facing similar problems in selling their produce at the rate of MSP. The farmers want to save water but the government should also understand their problems, said Mandeep, who had led a tractor march when the government had asked farmers of eight paddy rich blocks to leave paddy cultivation in at least 50 per cent area.  Later, this condition was withdrawn.  Out of 19 blocks where the ground water level is below 40 metres, the government says only eight are paddy rich blocks  Babain, Guhla, Ismailabad, Pipli, Ratia, Shahbad, Sirsa and Siwan.  Despite the governments focus on these blocks for crop diversification, farmers from these blocks have not shown desired enthusiasm towards the scheme till now.",GREEN GRAM DAL (MOONG DAL)

Therefore there wouldnt be a more important time, than now, to work on your immune system. So here are a few tips to ensure that your immune system is geared to take the onslaught of the rainy season during Covid-19 pandemic.  Homemade kadha: Never would your dadis kadha have been more relevant than today! An ayurvedic drink made with herbs and spices, a kadha helps in boosting the immunity. Chef Anahita Dhondy vouches for a kadha recipe that has helped a Covid survivor, when consumed twice a day. It contains black cardamom, turmeric, cloves, black peppercorns, tulsi, cinnamon, ginger, and honey or jaggery. All of these are known to be effective immunity boosters and are also anti-inflammatory, she says in a video.  Keep allergies at bay: Warm oil massages with sesame oil or mahanarayan oil before bath are helpful in avoiding allergies during this season, suggests Delhi-based Ayurveda consultant Dr Tarun Gupta. He recommends staying hydrated through the day by sipping boiled water with dried ginger, and adds, Nasal drops of mustard oil are also proven to counter all infections.  Binge on citrus fruits: Fruits are the gateway to better immunity as they are a powerhouse of fibre and nutrients such as vitamin C. Apples, guava, amla, orange, berries and pomegranates  add any or all to your diet for more energy and vitamins, adds Dr Gupta.  Homemade cough lozenges: To avoid having an itchy throat, make medicinal tablets at home. Some of the easiest recipes use powdered cloves, lime juice, ginger and amla. Boil these and honey or sugar after switching off the burner. Then pour drops of the liquid in a pan so as to make tablets.  A cuppa a day: To make your daily beverage an immunity booster, simply add a spoonful of turmeric to tea. This root spice has antioxidant properties while being antibacterial and antifungal in nature. Infusions made with tulsi, black pepper, ginger and amla are great for bolstering immunity, says Tanuja Sodhi, a Mumbai-based wellness expert.  Ghar ki Khichdi: During monsoon, prefer eating fresh home cooked food to avoid any infections. Consuming light and fresh foods prepared from barley, rice, or moong dal and having a small piece of ginger with rock salt before every meal are some quick and effective ways to boost your immunity naturally without much effort, says Akanksha Mishra, a Delhi-based food and nutritionist.  Two word mantra - sleep and exercise: You need to sleep for 7-8 hours a day because a good sleep is therapeutic and helps the body recover from the days exhaustion, adds Sodhi.

Statistics released by the IMD show that India recorded 118% of the Long Period Average rainfall in June 2020, which is considered excess. These copious showers brought cheer to the farming community, despite several regions facing intrinsic challenges such as shortage of labour in the wake of COVID-19 and disruption in supply chains due to intermittent lockdowns.  In many states, both Government and private-owned seed banks ensured that farmers had sufficient seeds to sow. Farmers following sustainable practices noticed an increase in demand for chemical-free produce and native vegetables, fruits and grains, spurred by the need to eat healthy and boost immunity levels in some pockets.  In Hyderabad and other districts of Telangana, where scorching heat prevailed till late June in the last few years, the pre-monsoon showers towards the end of May and monsoon in the first week of June encouraged farmers to prepare their land to sow rain-fed crops.

She also witnessed a small but steadily growing demand for foxtail millet and a sizeable demand for seeds and saplings of native fruits and vegetables. It is good to see more focus on food crops this time; nearly 80 farmers in this region are trying out 30 varieties of fruit saplings, explains Padma.  A good harvest Aranya Agricultural Alternatives, Telangana: Demand for seeds and saplings of mangoes, jackfruit, wild species of phalsa, neem, cashew nut, soursop, custard apple, ginger, turmeric, tree spinach and moringa. Farmers are also growing small bitter gourd, tapioca, vetiver, lemongrass and air potatoes.  Buffalo Back Collective, Karnataka: Ragi, avarakai (broad beans), groundnut and sesame are among the popular native crops here.  Farms near Chennai: Seeraga samba, thanga samba, Thanjavur ponni and thooya malli rice.  Paddy cultivation has already begun in Domadugu, Guntapally and other villages near Hyderabad, as well as the cultivation of green and black gram, toor dal, and native vegetables. A few years ago, organic farmer Praveen Abhishetty had begun growing small quantities of fragrant chitti muthyalu, red and black rice varieties. He intends to do so this year as well.  Direct selling  Bengaluru-based Prabhakar Rao, the founder of Hariyalee Seeds, works with farmers across India and affirms planting has begun fairly early owing to the monsoon. Leading up to the sowing season, the sale of seeds peaked to 300% of our usual volumes, he states.  Prabhakar also noticed a tangible increase in the demand for chemical-free, safe food following the pandemic outbreak: Those with diabetes, which is considered a co-morbidity for COVID-19, wanted to start including millets in their diet. Farmers living close to urban areas have been able to sell their produce at apartment complexes and gated communities without middlemen. We dont know how long this urge to have healthy food will sustain. Right now, people are willing to spend more for good produce since there is no expenditure on eating out, malls and other entertainment. Retail chains are also keen to source native grains and pulses, he explains.  Green Gram varieties Chamki Pesarlu and Balintha Pesarlu at Aranya Agricultural Alternatives | Photo Credit: Sneha Koppula  The golden pearl  Among the grains and pulses finding more takers, Prabhakar lists amaranth, chickpea and cowpea. He has also been at the forefront of reintroducing heritage wheat varieties such as the 2,000-year-old Sona Moti. This year, farmers in Punjab harvested 60 tonnes of Sona Moti which were pre-sold at  75/kilogram, says Prabhakar.  A few other farm communities are treading cautiously. Visalakshi Padmanabhan who founded the Buffalo Back Collective and works from a farm in the vicinity of Bannerghatta in Bengaluru, says the early arrival of monsoon has been a boon. Since this is a rain-shadow region, farmers here usually prepare for drought. This year, everyone is busy doing their best to harvest the available water. With the help of forest officials, ponds and streams along the elephant corridor were cleaned up; new ponds have also been created. This prevents elephants from venturing into human settlements for water.  With weekly organic farmers markets in Bengaluru shut due to COVID-19, she says how farmers had to look for alternative ways to reach their consumers.  Rice is nice  In Chennai, organic farmer VM Parthasarathy says while farmers in this belt are happy with the early monsoon, they are concerned about forecasts that suggest the possibility of a flood-like situation in November-December 2020. Memories of 2015 floods still remain fresh. No one wants to delay planting so that they can harvest before the floods. The lockdown has been tough since we couldnt exchange seeds within our organic farmer networks in different cities; we have had to find alternatives, he says.  Nirosha Kathiravan of The Villagers in Vandavasi, near Chennai, has sowed seeraga samba rice for the first time. We cultivate groundnut, sesame, moong and urad dals too. The monsoon has helped us plant more grass varieties and maize as fodder for our indigenous cattle [milk and milk products are the mainstays of this farm]. The big challenge in this belt is to find labour, which has become tougher due to spread of the pandemic beyond Chennai limits, she says.  The monsoon has brought new hope and the farming communities look forward to tiding over logistical setbacks and reap good harvests.",GREEN GRAM DAL (MOONG DAL)

Although the government has advised the farming community against cultivation of maize, it has been sown in over 1.43 lakh acres so far.  Maize is regularly cultivated in about 12 lakh acres during the Vaanakalam (kharif) season and by now it would have been sown in about 6.34 lakh acres. However, it has been cultivated in 1.43 lakh acres so far and inquiries done by our Agriculture Extension Officers (AEOs) have indicated that most of the farmers who have sown the crop so far did it for green cob/sweet corn sale and seed production, a senior agriculture official said.  However, the cultivation of pulses  red gram, green gram and black gram  has been relatively lower compared to the planned pattern.

But this bitter porridge believed to be an immunity booster and one that aids digestion is a must for many in Kerala during July and August (Karkkadakam), the last month of the Malayalam calendar when heavy rains lash Kerala. Availability of ready-to-cook kanji kits has made it accessible to all. The kanji is believed to aid digestion, boost immunity and prevent diseases during the month of July-August (Karkkadakam) when heavy rains lash Kerala.  With lockdowns in many part of the State  and country  to check the spread of COVID-19, the kits are not easily available. So, how about making it at home, as it was done till a few decades ago?  Mary Antony, a former teacher from Aluva, has always made her own medicinal kanji. She has it for three, five or seven days during the month. I never depended on the kanji kit. I follow the recipe taught by my ammachi (mother) that was passed on to her by her mother, says the 72-year-old.  Every household in Kerala has its own version of the gruel, with ingredients usually sourced within the neighbourhood. Remember, the kanji used to be cooked at home before the kits became a trend. In fact, you dont need all the ingredients that supposedly go into ready-to-cook packets. Certain key ingredients are mandatory, says Dr Krishna Rao, research officer (Ayurveda), Central Ayurveda Research Institute for Hepatobiliary Disorders, Bhubaneswar.  Key ingredients  Although njavara rice, an indigenous variety from Kerala, is ideal, it can be made with kuthari (boiled rice) or unakkalari (raw rice with bran). These varieties can be used individually or in combination, Dr Rao adds. Digestive stimulants and ingredients that flush out toxins from the body are integral to the gruel. For example, while cumin, turmeric and chathakuppa (crown dill) will aid digestion, a fine powder of chukku (dried ginger), cloves and cinnamon eliminates toxins even as it adds flavour to the kanji, he explains.  Stick to rock salt instead of table salt or go for a sweet version with palm jaggery, jaggery and coconut milk. Shallots sauted in ghee or oil improves the taste, especially for children. Fenugreek and aashaali (garden cress) are also used in some preparations. Mary cooks the two with unakkalari and cumin seeds. Thick coconut milk subdues the pungency of fenugreek and aashaali, she says.  Keeping it traditional The kanji prepared by the Namboothiri community in Kerala has Njavara rice, kurunthotti, shatavari (Satavar or Asparagus racemosus), tulsi, thottavadi, fenugreek, aashaali and coconut milk, says Vijayasree Vasan, a homemaker from Kumaranelloor in Kottayam district. Ghee and ashtachoornam (an Ayurveda medicine) or shallots sauted in ghee can be added. A chammanthi (chutney) prepared with leaves of Kodangal (Indian pennyweed, a creeper) is a must. The leaf is ground with ginger, kanthari mulaku (birds eye chilli), curry leaves and tamarind, she adds. The gruel is consumed for five, seven, nine or 12 days.  On the first or last Friday of the month the women of the family wear dashapushpam (10 sacred flowers) in their hair and apply mehndi on their hands and feet after a bath. Kanakappodi or ponppodi is made with powdered malar (puff rice), jaggery, grated coconut and sugar. For lunch, Shivoti kanji, a pongal with unakkalari, jaggery, coconut milk and coconut is consumed. A thoran with 10 leaf varieties is also prepared. Leaves of thazhuthama (hog weed), thakara (Ringworm plant), pumpkin and long beans are a must. Varieties of cheera and leaves of colocasia and elephant foot yam are added, she says. Therali appam (steamed rice and jaggery dumplings) cooked in leaves of mulla (Arabian jasmine) are offered to the Goddess.  Gangadharan, proprietor of Pathayam naturopathic restaurant in Thiruvananthapuram, suggests fenugreek be soaked or sprouted beforehand, and cooked with sprouted green gram and unakkalari or njavara rice to make the gruel. To this, add a fine powder of turmeric, chathakuppa, coriander and dried ginger. Aashaali, cumin and rock salt are mixed at the end, he explains.  The concoction can be made without aashaali or chathakuppa. Cook sprouted fenugreek with unakkalari. Have it with ground coconut or coconut milk and salt, says Geetha Rajagopal, a homemaker from Tripunithura. Baby Radhakrishnan, a former banker from Ettumannoor, uses cumin instead of fenugreek. My children love it with jaggery. Some of my friends prepare it with sprouted horse gram and rice. Juice extracted from medicinal herbs/plants can also be added. For instance, tulsi (holy basil), mukkutti (little tree plant), kurunthotti (bala or common wireweed), thottavadi (touch-me-not or Mimosa pudica), and tender leaves of guava.  Savithri Patteri from Kannur keeps it simple with unakkalari and black gram, both home-grown. The gram, sauted and coarsely ground, is cooked with rice and fenugreek. Add grated coconut and ghee before you consume it.  Thoran made with 10 varieties of edible leaves | Photo Credit: Special arrangement  The norm is to consume the gruel for seven, 14 or 21 days during the month, either in small quantities or as your evening meal. All ingredients should be cooked well. Those who have diabetes or high cholesterol should avoid jaggery and ghee. Food is a medicine itself. So, dont have the gruel just because others are also having it. Your appetite, health and age have to be taken into consideration, Dr Rao adds.  Recipe for Karkkadaka kanji:  Ingredients ( Serves four)  Unakkalari  200 g  Coconut milk  From one coconut  Fenugreek, aashaali and cumin seeds  50 gm each  Salt- as per taste  Shallots - 100 gm  Ghee - 4 spoons  Method  If you are planning to have the gruel in the evening, wash fenugreek, aashali and cumin seeds thoroughly and soak them in separate bowls in the morning. Cook them with rice in the same water. When rice is half-cooked, add coconut milk of thick consistency and salt. Cook well. Add shallots sauted in ghee only before you consume the gruel. Its better to have it for three, five or seven days of the month.  - Mary Antony",GREEN GRAM DAL (MOONG DAL)

Choose from a variety of fruits and vegetables to get your daily dose of vitamin C. Plus, some interesting recipes to help you along!  Say Vitamin C and you almost immediately think of oranges and lemons. But did you know that a single red guava has over 200 mg of the nutrient in 100 grams, which is almost over thrice as that in an orange. You get just about 64 mg from 100 gm of orange and 48 mg from 100 ml of lime juice according to the Indian Food Composition Tables.  Vitamin C, also called ascorbic acid, is a water soluble vitamin that helps to improve immunity, aids in the synthesis of collagen (skin protein), and production of certain neurotransmitters (the bodys chemical messengers). It is not stored in the body and requires daily intake, says Bengaluru-based Dharshini Surendran, dietician.  Guava | Photo Credit: Sreejith R Kumar  While 100 gm of gooseberry provides 247 mg, others like bell peppers (yellow, red, green: 120 mg), bitter gourd (50 mg), and raw mango (50 mg), can also provide the vitamin. Though its not possible to eat 100 gm of chillies, its good to know that they contain 90 mg of the vitamin.  The daily Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) of Vitamin C for adults is 65 to 90 mg per day. We need Vitamin C to help in the absorption of iron from food, says Gayathri V, a dietician based in Kochi. A balanced diet, for example dosa or idli and sambar with seasonal vegetables for breakfast; a lunch platter of rice, green vegetables, and dal; a guava or papaya for dessert, ensures that you not only get Vitamin C, but also carbs, proteins, and fats.  Green pepper / capsicum | Photo Credit: Sreejith R Kumar  Avoid caffeine as it inhibits Vitamin C absorption, stay hydrated, and cut down on meat, especially after you consume Vitamin C rich foods, advises Pradeepa Saravanan, dietician based in Coimbatore.Include at least one serving of fresh fruits and vegetables per day in your diet. For example, a papaya salad with pomegranate, bell peppers, or banana. Vitamin C evaporates when exposed to heat, thats why I recommend consuming 500 mg every day, not just during the pandemic but for life, to make up for the nutrient loss while cooking.  One way of starting your day with a Vitamin C shot is to churn either three or four amla (gooseberries) or half a bitter gourd in the mixie with a handful of coconut bits and a jaggery to taste (nothing over a tablespoon). Mix with a little water, strain, and drink on an empty stomach.  Here are a few recipes, courtesy Dharshini Surendran, to help up Vitamin C levels:  Capsicum thokku  You can add diced capsicum to pasta or salad, or try this pickled version.  Green pepper / capsicum | Photo Credit: Sreejith R Kumar  Ingredients:  2 capsicum ( any colour diced into pieces)  1 tomato  1 onion  1 tsp tamarind pulp  1 tsp urad dal  1 tsp coriander seeds  1 tsp jeera  3 red chillies  Himalayan Pink Salt to taste  Method:  In a pan, dry roast the coriander seeds, urad dal, jeera and red chilli. Add the chopped onion, tomato and saute it well. Add the sauted onion, tomato, and dry roasted mix in a mixie jar and grind well. Add tamarind pulp.Finally add the salt as per taste and capsicum pieces and grind once again into a fine paste. This can be eaten along with rice, roti or dosa.  Sweet potato balls  Ingredients:  Sweet potatoes | Photo Credit: Sreejith R Kumar  2 sweet potatoes (boiled)  2 handful of green gram sprouts  1/2 handful of grated raw mango  1/2 handful of grated carrot  1 onion finely chopped  2 tsp pepper powder  Salt as per taste  Method:  Peel the skin of sweet potato and mash it well. Add the green gram sprouts, carrot, raw mango, onion and mix well. Finally add salt and pepper and make into balls. As the potatoes are already boiled, it can be had directly. No need to bake.  Orange Rasam  Store green chillies in a cool, dark area, because chillies lose their Vitamin C when exposed to heat, light, and air.  Oranges | Photo Credit: Sreejith R Kumar  Ingredients:  1 cup orange juice  1 tbsp moong dal (soaked and boiled)  Chopped coriander leaves (for garnish)  1 tsp lemon juice  1 orange rind (grated)  3 slit green chillies  A few curry leaves  1 tsp mustard seeds  1/2 tsp asafoetida  Himalayan pink salt as per taste  1 tsp of cold pressed sesame oil cold pressed  1tsp rasam powder (optional)  Method:  In a pan, add 1 tsp sesame oil and season it with mustard seeds, asafoetida, and curry leaves.

Justices M.M. Sundresh and R. Hemalatha were informed that a Government Order had been issued on July 2 to provide dry rations to 23,71,316 children in Class I to V and 18,89,808 students of Class VI to VIII at their schools and under the supervision of the headmasters concerned.  Though rice and dhal might not match the nutritive value of eggs provided in schools every day, they certainly match the Centres norms on the quantum of calories and proteins required to be provided to primary and upper primary school children every day, the government said.  The submissions were made in a counter affidavit filed in response to a public interest litigation petition preferred by advocate R. Sudha who sought to fulfil the nutrition requirement of schoolchildren besides seeking a direction to provide boiled eggs at Amma canteens. Social Welfare Secretary S. Madumathi told the court that the government was actually providing nutritious meal to 48,56,783 students including 5,90,913 studying in Class IX and X and 4,746 under the National Child Labour Project, during all school working days before the lockdown.  Each student was given an egg weighing 46 grams providing 6.12 grams of protein and 80kcal of energy. Those who do not consume eggs, were given bananas. Apart from this, students were also provided with black Bengal gram, green gram and potatoes.  Considering the iron and iodine deficiency among many children, double fortified salt was also used for cooking in all 43,246 nutritious meal centres in the State. The nutrition provided to schoolchildren in the State was way higher than the Central norms.  Due to the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic, providing eggs along with dry ration was analysed by the government and due to its perishable nature, children/parents cant be gathered to provide eggs daily. Also purchasing and transportation at this period is not advised, the counter read.  However, since the schools in the State were closed since March 17 and the Union Minister for Human Resource Development had, on April 28, insisted upon providing nutrition to students even during summer vacation, the State government issued the July 2 G.O. As far as the Integrated Child Development Services aimed at taking care of pregnant as well as lactating mothers and also the children between six months to six years of age was concerned, the Secretary said those beneficiaries were provided nutritious food even during the lockdown.  Though the Anganwadi centres were also closed due to the lockdown, rice, dhal and eggs were being supplied to 33,12,629 beneficiaries at their homes, the government added.  After taking the counter on file, the judges adjourned the case to Thursday for hearing.",GREEN GRAM DAL (MOONG DAL)

Food habits during coronavirus (COVID-19) may have shifted from diverse and nutritive diets to staple foods such as wheat and rice as the prices of vegetables, pulses and eggs rose sharply after the lockdown while those of cereals remained relatively stable, according to a new study by the Tata-Cornell Institute for Agriculture and Nutrition in New York.  How the coronavirus crisis is affecting food supply  The study, Pandemic Prices: COVID-19 price shocks and their implications for nutrition security in India, authored by Payal Seth, Prabhu Pingali and Bhaskar Mittra, was launched earlier this month.  It analyses prices of cereals (wheat and rice) and non-cereals (onion, tomatoes, potatoes, five pulses and eggs) in 11 tier-1 and tier-2 cities from March 1 to May 31 compared to the same period last year. It uses weekly-level retail data from the Department of Commerce Affairs of the Union government and wholesale prices from the National Egg Coordination Committee. The nationwide lockdown was imposed from March 25.  Reduce prices of grains for relief work, says Brinda  The study revealed that following the lockdown all food groups witnessed a rise in prices compared to 2019, but the rise in prices was higher for non-cereals compared to cereals. After the lockdown was lifted, prices of cereals, eggs, potatoes, onions and tomatoes stabilised quickly while those of protein-rich pulses continued to remain high.  Wheat price  Retail wheat and rice prices were either stable or cheaper than weeks preceding the lockdown as well as same time last year. Compared to last year, the potato price was as high as 30-90% in several cities but stabilised by the first week of May; the price of onions was as high as 200-250% immediately after the lockdown in some States and stabilised by April end, and higher in some cases; and tomatoes were higher compared to pre-COVID-19 period but began to show a downward trend. The wholesale prices of eggs show that they fell initially (authors argue it was because of fear of coronavirus through poultry), increased by March end and then stabilised two months later.  Preventing food shortages is a high priority for South Asia, says World Bank economist  Prices of pulses rose during the lockdown and continued to remain higher than the pre-COVID-19 levels  arhar (tur dal) was up by up to 45%, red lentil (masur dal) by 20-50%, moong dal by 20-80% gram dal ranged from 10 to 40% and urad dal by 0-80%.  Consumption decisions  The relative stability in cereal prices and enhanced prices of pulses will most likely distort spending and consumption decisions. This will perpetuate reliance on a staple-based, protein-deficient diet. The government can ensure the provision of supplementary protein that is expected to be lost due to the price rise by timely interventions to stabilise the increase in prices, the authors recommend. They criticise recent amendment to the Essential Commodities Act, which deregulated cereals, edible oils, oilseeds, pulses, onions, and potatoes and argue that policies that insulate non-staple supply chains from price shocks and fluctuations and repealing jaded restrictions to address farm sector bottlenecks were critical.  The report submits that the relatively higher prices of more nutritious food makes it difficult for the poor and marginal population to access such nutrient-rich food. As a result, proportion of such foods in the diets goes further down and is replaced by less nutritious and calorie-dense foods. This is likely to worsen the nutritional status of women and children across India, and more so in the impoverished regions of the country, co-author of the report, Bhaskar Mittra, told The Hindu in an email.",GREEN GRAM DAL (MOONG DAL)

Add 2 tbsp besan or gram flour, a pinch of baking soda and  tsp turmeric powder.  Mix all the above dry ingredients with a spoon or spatula.  Then add water. The amount of water to be added depends on the quality of flour used. I added 1 cup water. Depending on the quality of flour and besan, you can add from  to 1 cup water.  With the spatula or spoon, first mix. Break the small or tiny lumps with the spatula or spoon while mixing.  Then in round circular directions stir the batter briskly for 4 minutes. This adds volume to the batter and makes it even and smooth.  The batter should have a flowing consistency. Cover and keep the batter to ferment in a warm place for 12 to 15 hours. I kept for 15 hours. If you live in a cold climate, you can keep for 20 to 24 hours.  This is how the batter looks the next day. You will see small bubbles on the top.  Stir the batter and if you carefully see, the batter would have become thinner than what it was before fermentation.  So to thicken the batter again, add 1 to 2 tbsp of all purpose flour.  With a spoon mix very well.  Now pour this batter in the squeezy tomato ketchup bottles that we get in the market. You can also use coconut shell and make a small hole in it. You can also use a piping bag or make your own with butter paper. Depending on the capacity of the bottle, you can pour less or more in it.  Preparing sugar syrup  Take 1 cup sugar in a pan. Add 1/4 tsp saffron strands to it. Do add saffron as it gives a nice orange yellow color and also its aroma to the jalebis.  Add 1/2 cup water.  Keep this pan on stove top on low flame and begin to stir, so that the sugar dissolves.  On a low to medium flame, cook the sugar syrup.  Cook till you get one string consistency in the sugar syrup.  Once you get the one string consistency, switch off the flame and add 1/4 tsp lime or lemon juice. Stir well. Keep the sugar syrup on the burner itself so that it remains warm when you add the jalebis in it.  Frying jalebi  Heat oil for deep frying in a kadai or pan. You can also use ghee or half-half of oil and ghee. Ghee gives a better flavour.  To check the temperature of oil, add a tiny amount of batter to the oil. If it comes up quickly and gradually the oil is hot enough for the jalebis to be fried. The frying temperature is 350 degrees fahrenheit/176 degrees celsius.  Now squeeze the bottle and make concentric rings with the batter.  Either start from the center and move outside or vice versa. Be careful while making the jalebis as the oil is hot.  You wont get perfect shapes as the jalebis keep on moving while you make the circles. This does require practice and it also depends on what equipment you are using to make them.  When one side is partly cooked, turn over and fry the other side.  Some jalebis will be cooked faster than others.  Fry till the oil stops sizzling and the jalebis are a light golden. Remove with a tongs or a bamboo skewer. While removing shake to drain the extra oil.  Adding fried jalebi to sugar syrup  Then immediately put the fried jalebis in the sugar syrup. The sugar syrup should be slightly hot or warm when you add the jalebis in it.  Turn over after after a minute so that both sides are coated with the syrup.  Keep them in the syrup for about 2 to 3 minutes. If you keep for two minutes, they will be lightly colored and if you keep for 3 minutes, they will have a deep color.  Remove with a wooden skewer or tongs. Shake lightly so that the excess sugar syrup falls back in the pan. Place them in a plate or tray lined with a foil or butter paper.  Make all jalebi this way. Its better to have a help while doing so. Otherwise it is kind of multi-tasking.  Serve jalebi hot, warm or at room temperature. The leftovers can be kept in an airtight container and refrigerated.

While the State government maintains pipelines are being laid on its land along roads and with the consent of owners in case of small private land patches, farmers rue the construction has left parts of their fields gravelly and infertile, unfit for cultivation.  Workers dug out parts of our field and left boulders around, said Gaurav Mishra, whose family owns five acres of land. That part is no more cultivable as its gravelly and uneven.  Stating they were denied compensation for loss of income when demanded, Mr. Mishra of Bada Itma village of Ramnagar block, among those to be benefited by the project, said a part of the produce the family sold for 4-5 lakh growing paddy, moong and soyabean every year, had now been lost. We are not opposing the project. After all, it will bring us water, he clarified.  Subhash Pandey of the Rashtriya Kisan Mazdoor Mahasangh has written to the District Collector, the Chief Minister and the National Human Rights Commission demanding compensation, but to no avail. He says the authority concerned is yet to inform him of action taken in the matter within eight weeks, as directed by the Commission in September last year.  Farming seasons were being lost and the government refused to compensate farmers, contended Mr. Pandey. More than 2,500 farmers are affected as a result. When the country is relying on the agrarian economy to bring the economy back on track during the COVID-19 pandemic, our farmers are being disrespected like this, he said.  The pipelines are being laid five-six feet underground, so there is no loss to farmers, said A.P. Dwivedi, Sub-Divisional Magistrate, Ramnagar, who was directed by the District Magistrate in November last year to submit a report to the Commission in a time-bound way. Moreover, he added the pipeline was being laid on government land along roads, so there is no question of compensation.  The Madhya Pradesh Bhumigat Pipeline, Cable Avam Duct (Bhumi ki upyokta ke adhikaron ka arjan) Niyam, 2013, provides for compensation for crop and tree loss for the period of laying of underground pipeline, cable or duct. Although there is a law, we have received no orders from the top to compensate farmers in such cases State-wide, said a senior official of the Madhya Pradesh Jal Nigam Maryadit, a State government undertaking, requesting anonymity.  Meanwhile, Ashish Srivastava, the undertakings Chief General Manager, said it had received no such claims from farmers so far. If there is a legitimate claim, we will of course compensate them, he said, adding some farmers encroaching upon government land along roads might be raising the demand now.  The pipeline works aren't causing any obstruction to farming. And there is no element of coercion, contended M.K. Mudgal, General Manager, Project Implementation Unit, Satna.  He further said the project, which began in November 2018, was being funded by the New Development Bank whose guarantee was that government land be used mostly for it.",GREEN GRAM DAL (MOONG DAL)

The heavy rain-induced prevailing flood misery in Bhadrachalam has yet again brought to the fore the temple town's vulnerability to the potential threat of submergence once the Polavaram project is completed, he said after visiting the flood-affected areas of Bhadrachalam, where the Godavari receded slightly to 44 feet, one feet above the first warning level, on Wednesday afternoon.  Mr Veerabhadram made a whirlwind tour of the flood affected areas in Bhadrachalam town and in Dummugudem mandal.  He was accompanied by the party Bhadradri-Kothagudem and Khammam district secretaries A Kanakaiah and N Nageswara Rao.  He visited the flood affected AMC Colony and Kotha Colony, besides the flood relief camp at a local school in the temple town.  Later, speaking to newsmen, he charged the State government with failing to assess the flood threat and make arrangements like deployment of boats in the flood prone areas in Bhadrachalam Agency in advance.  The CPI (M) has forewarned the ruling dispensation about the flood threat faced by Bhadrachalam. ""The persons at the helm have neglected Bhadradri and confined themselves to mere rhetoric statements without any concrete measures to find a lasting solution to the recurring flooding woes of people living in the Godavari river side habitations,"" he charged.  He demanded that the government sanction double bedroom houses to the flood affected people and provide succour to the affected families.  Amid drizzle, Mr Veerabhadram and the district level leaders visited the Godavari flood affected Sunnam Bhatti and Kasinagaram villages in Dummugudem mandal on motorbikes.  While interacting with the villagers at Kasinagaram, Mr Veerabhadram said the consent of the Gram Sabha is mandatory for the proposed Sitamma Sagar multipurpose project.  Referring to the new project proposed by the State government envisaging construction of a barrage across the Godavari river downstream of the existing Dummugudem anicut in Aswapuram mandal, he said the detailed project report be made public and the gram sabha's consent be obtained before going ahead with the project.  Recalling the mass movement organised by the party on behalf of the land oustees of the Mallannasagar project in the erstwhile undivided Medak district, he said the party has explored legal options to safeguard the interests of the land oustees.  Later, he toured the rain hit agricultural fields in Enkoor mandal of Khammam district.  He said the rain and flood fury over the last few days resulted in extensive loss of green gram crop and significant damage to cotton among other crops.  He demanded that the government provide 40,000 compensation per acre to each rain-hit farmer.  The Telangana Girijana Sangham district secretary B Veerabhadram and the Telangana Rythu Sangham district secretary B Rambabu accompanied him.",GREEN GRAM DAL (MOONG DAL)

Addressing a media conference along with former legislator B.R. Patil and District Congress Committee president Jagadev Guttedar here, Mr. Patil said that a private insurance company had plundered nearly 200 crore in Kalaburagi district alone in the last four years.  As per the official data provided by the Agriculture Department, farmers and government in Kalaburagi district alone have paid as much as 221 crore premium in the last four years from 206-17. The amount paid to farmers through claim settlement for crop loss in the same period is just 26 crore. The private insurance company has thus made a profit of nearly 200 crore. If a private company loots 200 crore in one district, you can imagine how much public money is plundered in the entire country. The profit-mongering private insurance companies involved in the PMFBY are rejecting farmers claim to make more profit. The very purpose of the scheme is to help these private players and not the farmers. That is how the Modi government at the Centre is serving the private parties and cheating the farmers. It is the biggest fraud of Modi government, Mr. Patil said.  Recalling the crop insurance scheme implemented during the regime of the United Progressive Alliance led by Congress, Mr. Patil added that the insurance companies then involved in the scheme were not private, but State-owned and, hence, there were no vested interests.  MSP  Criticising the government for delayed announcement of Minimum Support Price (MSP), Mr. Patil said that opening procurement centres after the small farmers sold their crops at fallen rates would help the traders and not the farmers.  The area of green gram cultivation has expanded from 25,000 hectares last year to 63,000 hectares this year and that of black gram from 20,000 hectares to 35,000 hectares in Kalaburagi district. Thanks to the good monsoon, the yields of both crops are very good. Farmers have already started bringing the harvested crop to the market. But, procurement centres are not yet opened. Opening the procurement centres after small farmers sell their crop at lower prices would, in no way, help the farmers. The government should immediately open the procurement centres and purchase green gram at 8,000 a quintal and black gram at  6000 a quintal, he said. He also asked the government not to cap the procurement quantity, but to purchase the entire crop grown.",GREEN GRAM DAL (MOONG DAL)

Vaishali Vijaykumar gathers seven lip-smacking recipes from homechefs  FRIED MODAK BY CHITRA GANAPATHY  Ingredients  Wheat flour: 1/2 cup, Salt: a pinch, Melted ghee: 1/2 tsp,  Rava/Sooji: 1 tsp (optional),  Water: as needed,  Cooking oil: to deep fry  For stuffing/pooran  Grated coconut: 1/2 cup  Powdered jaggery: 1/3 cup  Cardamom powder: 1/4 tsp  Dry roasted poppy seeds: 1 tbsp (optional)  Method  For stuffing  Take the grated coconut, powdered jaggery and dry roasted poppy seeds in a kadai.  The quantity of jaggery should be less than coconut. Do not add water. Mix well on medium flame.  Let the jaggery melt in the heat and mix well with coconut.  When the mixture starts to become thick without moisture and leaves the pan, switch off the flame and transfer the stuffing onto a plate.  Spread it well and let the stuffing cool down.  For dough  In a wide bowl, take the wheat flour, melted ghee, a pinch of salt and mix well. Add water little by little and make a stiff, thick dough.  The dough should not be too soft. Knead for some time and cover with a wet cloth. Let the dough rest for just five minutes.  Take a small ball of dough and dust in wheat flour. Make a thin circle of poori size.  Remember, the sides of the circle should be thinner than the centre. As this is made of wheat flour, it will become dense after deep-frying.  So make the poori thin. Cover the remaining dough with a wet cloth.  Now, with a lid, cut the dough into small uniform circles. Place one tablespoon of stuffing in the middle and make 5-7 pleats in the dough.  Refer picture and do the same way. Join all the pleats and make a coconut shape modak. Make sure the modak is sealed properly else the stuffing will ooze out in oil while frying.  Heat oil in a kadai. Gently drop a pinch of dough. If it rises to the top immediately, oil temperature is just right.  Now, drop 3-4 modaks and cook on medium flame. Cook till they turn golden brown. Flip it and cook till done. Remove and place them on a tissue. Fried modak is ready.  DRY FRUIT MODAK BY VIDYA SRINIVASAN  Ingredients  Raw rice: 100 gm, Dates: 140 gm (20 nos), Almond powder: 70 gm,  Cardamom powder: 1.5 gm, Ghee: 8 gm, Sesame oil /coconut oil: 10 ml,  Salt: a pinch, Water: as needed  Method  Wash and soak rice for at least two hours.  Grind the rice into a fine paste, adding a little water. Do not add excess water, as the rice will not be fine-ground with excess water.  After grinding the rice, add extra water to make it a watery batter (dosai batter consistency). We might need around 130 ml of water in total.  Chop the dates roughly and microwave the pieces for around 30 seconds to turn them soft. Let the dates cool.  Grind the dates with little water and transfer into a plate.  Add almond powder, cardamom powder and ghee to the dates paste; mix well and keep aside.  Add sesame oil to a pan, and when oil is hot, add the rice batter and salt; mix well.  Continuously mix with a ladle until it comes together as a non-sticky dough. Cover and reduce the stove to the lowest setting.  Cook for a minute and switch off.  Transfer the dough onto a plate and cover with a damp cloth.  When the dough is still warm, grease your hands with oil and knead the dough well.  If required, sprinkle some hot water to make a smooth dough.  Make small spheres. Since rice flour is gluten-free, it tends to be sticky; greasing palms with coconut/sesame oil helps to make modak.  Slowly press the sphere with your hand and make a circle big enough to keep the filling.  Place a small portion of the dates paste into the circle.  Fold the circle and bring the outer layer to the top, making a modak shape. Alternatively, a mould can also be used.  Similarly, fill all the modaks with the stuffing.  Steam for 10 minutes or until the modak looks shiny on the outside and does not stick.  Switch off. Do not remove as soon as the stove is switched off. Let the modak sit for five minutes before removing.  Enjoy it warm.  Notes  Instead of almond flour, 70 grams of mixed nuts or any nuts of choice can be used. Dry roast the nuts until golden, let it cool and transfer to a mixer jar. Grind it to a slightly coarse mixture. Dry fruit mixture should not be sticky. If you prepare the dough beforehand, make sure to keep it covered with a damp cloth/paper towel to avoid the dough from drying. Store-bought /homemade rice flour can be used instead of rice. Use 100 grams of flour. Boil water with salt and oil, after it comes to boil, add rice flour and mix well till it turns into a non-sticky dough. Coconut can be added for flavour. Excess dry fruits mixture can be served by moulding them in the shape of a modak, or rolling them into a laddu.  CAKE POP MODAK BY NISHA GALA  Ingredients  Cake sponge: 200 gm, Frosting/  ganache: 100 gm, Chocolate to dip  modak: 200 gm, Silicon modak  mould, Few lollipop sticks  Method  In a bowl, break the cake sponge into fine crumbs using your hand. Add your choice of frosting or ganache and mix well. It should combine well and form a cake batter.  Take a small amount of cake batter and put it in silicon modak mould.  Melt chocolate using the double boiling method. Dip one end of the stick into chocolate and pass it through the cake batter in the mould.  Place the mould in the freezer for 10-12 minutes or until the cake is firm.  Carefully demould the modaks and dip it in melted chocolate.  Let it set for 2-3 minutes.Cakepop modaks are ready.  SPICY PROTEIN MODAK BY RAMYA SIVAKUMAR  Ingredients  For spice powder Urad dal: 1 tsp,  Chana dal: 1 tsp, Dried red chillies: 2,  Cumin seeds: 1/2 tsp, Black  peppercorns: 1/4 tsp  For stuffing  Moong sprouts: 1/2 cup  Grated coconut: 1/4 cup  Oil: 1 tsp  Mustard seeds: 1/2 tsp  Urad dal: 1/2 tsp  Asafoetida/ hing: 1/4 tsp  Curry leaves: 1 sprig  Salt as needed  Water as needed  For dough  Rice flour: 1/2 cup  Water: 3/4 cup (adjust as needed)  Sesame oil/ gingelly oil: 1 tsp  Salt as needed  Method  Spice powder  Dry roast all the spice powder ingredients until golden brown on low flame.  Once cooled, grind into a smooth powder.  For filling  Pressure-cook moong sprouts with enough water for two whistles.  In a pan, heat oil and temper mustard seeds, urad dal. Once urad dal turns golden brown, add fresh curry leaves and asafoetida/hing. Next, add pressure-cooked moong sprouts, and salt as needed.  Cook for a minute and add 2-3 tsp of the spice powder. Cook for a couple of minutes and add fresh grated coconut.  Remove from heat and let it cool completely.  For dough  Bring 3/4 cup of water to boil along with 1/2 tsp of sesame/gingelly oil and salt as needed.  Once the water boils well, switch off the flame.  Add rice flour and quickly stir it. Make sure there are no lumps.  Add 1/2 tsp of sesame/ gingelly oil on top and leave it covered for 3-4 minutes. When it is warm enough to handle, knead it into a soft pliable dough.  For modak  Apply sesame/gingelly oil all over the modak mould. Take a small ball of dough and press along the edges of the mould such that there is a gap in the centre. Fill it with the spicy sprouts filling.  Cover the modak on top with some more dough. Gently open the mould and remove the modak. Repeat the same with rest of the dough. Keep applying oil on the mould for every modak.  To steam the modaks, grease a steamer plate with few drops of sesame/gingelly oil.  Place the prepared modaks on the steamer plate and steam for 7-8 minutes. Switch off the heat and let them cool for a couple of minutes before removing them from the vessel.  JACKFRUIT KOZHUKATTAI BY RAJESWARI VIJAYANAND  Ingredients  Jackfruit: 8 pala sulai,  Jaggery powder: 1/2 cup  heaped, Coconut: 1/2 cup  grated, Cardamom: 2, Ghee:  1 tsp, Rice flour/ idiyappam  flour: 1 cup, Sesame oil: 1 tsp, Salt: as needed  Method  First, prepare the jackfruit stuffing. Separate the seed and thin skin around it. Roughly tear, divide into two-three pieces.  Place it in a vessel and sprinkle a tablespoon of water. Pressure cook for three whistles on medium flame. Let it cool and then, grind to a paste.  Heat a pan with ground paste, jaggery, grated coconut, and cardamom.  Stir until it is thick. Add a teaspoon of ghee in the end. (I let the stuffing to be loose in texture.)  For dough  Boil water well. In a mixing bowl, take rice flour. Add sesame oil, required salt to it. Add boiling hot water to the flour and mix with a ladle.  Once warm enough to handle, grease your hands and knead to a smooth dough. Divide into equal lemon-sized balls.  Shape  To make elai kozhukattai, cut the banana leaf into small sheets. Refer notes for tips.  Grease with oil. Place rolled dough ball and flatten to a thin round. Place two teaspoons of prepared jackfruit stuffing.  Fold in such a way that the other part exactly covers the stuffing. Gently press the leaf towards the outer edge to seal.  Steaming  Place in idli pot plate/ steamer and steam for eight minutes.  Once done, you can take out the kozhukattai immediately. It comes off easily.  You can reuse the leaves to finish the dough.  Notes  Do not add more water while pressure-cooking jackfruit. Make sure to powder the jaggery well before measuring for a precise outcome. (I used jaggery powder.) More the jaggery, the sweeter it gets. (I used little more than 1/2 cup and felt it was too sweet, so reduced in my recipe.) To ensure that the banana leaf does not tear while folding, wilt the leaf slightly over direct flame. You can steam more than four modaks in an idli plate by placing it accordingly.  SWEET POTATO MODAK BY RAJESWARI VIJAYANAND  Ingredients  Sweet potato cooked & mashed: 1/2 cup, Kozhukattai flour or idiyappam  flour: 1/4 cup + 2 tbsp, Sesame oil: 1 tsp, Salt as needed  For stuffing  Coconut grated: 1cup  Jaggery powdered: 3/4 cup  Cardamom: 2  Salt: 1 pinch  Ghee: 1 tsp  Method  For stuffing  Heat powdered jaggery with very little water. Mix well to melt.  Filter to remove any impurities.  Heat coconut, jaggery syrup in a heavy-bottomed pan.  Cook until the syrup thickens and mixture gathers together.  Add cardamom, a pinch of salt, and ghee before switching off and mix well.  For dough  Peel, wash, and cut the sweet potato into cubes. Steam cook for 15 mins or until soft through inside.  Take the cooked sweet potato in a mixing bowl. Mash well.  Add kozhukattai flour (alternatively, use idiyappam flour or rice flour), salt, oil and mix well.  Add hot boiling water, just a little to make the dough. Knead smoothly.  Prepare both purple and yellow versions the same way. (I used a pinch of turmeric for the yellow one.)  Take a large lemon-sized ball of the dough and knead to smoothen it.  Flatten it to a thick, palm-sized disc. Place about 1 tbsp of the mixture in the centre.  Gather the sides to cover the stuffing carefully. Seal and roll into a smooth ball.  Place it in a mould. You can use any modak shape or even jelly moulds.  Steam for 5-7 minutes. (I used my idli pot and placed the modak in a bamboo steamer.)  You can use idli plates too. Just grease it and place the modaks. Repeat to finish.  POHA MANGO MODAK BY VIJAYA VENKATESH  Ingredients  Pearl millet flakes/aval / poha powder: 1 cup, Thick  mango puree: 1 cup, Thick  coconut milk or dairy milk: 1/2 cup, Country sugar/  jaggery/sugar, cup: 1/4 cup, Coconut oil: 2 tbsp,  Water: 2 tbsp,  Cardamom powder: 1/2 tsp, Salt: 1/8 tsp, Yellow  food colour (optional): 1/8 tsp  Method",GREEN GRAM DAL (MOONG DAL)

(Representational) Punjab has brought over 5 lakh hectares (12.37 lakh acres) area under DSR which is not only an all-time high area under it this year but also higher than what area the state had covered in past 10 years from 2009 to 2019. (Representational)  While the Centre has already issued a draft order banning the manufacturing and sale of 27 pesticides, a herbicide in this list has seen maximum sale in Punjab this Kharif season. This pre-emergent herbicide is Pendimethalin and the reason behind its high sale is Punjab bringing highest ever area under Direct Seeding of Rice (DSR) this year. This herbicide is mandatory for paddy sown with DSR which is compromised by weeds that compete with the plants for nutrition, sunlight, and water. This pre-emergent herbicide, which had no other alternative, is sprayed simultaneously at the time of sowing.  Experts said that around 12-15 lakh litres of Pendimethalin was sold in Punjab this year and if this is banned then DSR sowing will definitely get hit till the time its alternative is not available.  This year due to a shortage of labour the granary state faced a huge shortage of seasonal migrants from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh to undertake transplantation of paddy due to lockdown. This led farmers to opt for DSR, which does not require labour as the seed is directly sown in the well moist field with rice seeder, in place of conventional paddy transplanting, which needs already grown 25-30 days old paddy nursery which is transplanted in puddled fields by the labour.  Flood irrigation in the traditional method acts as herbicide as stagnate water does not allow weeds to grow in submerged paddy plants, which remain in the same condition for 4-5 weeks. In DSR, two kinds of herbicides are required. The first is called pre-emergent, which is applied compulsory before germination, and the second after the germination which may or may not be required.  Punjab has brought over 5 lakh hectares (12.37 lakh acres) area under DSR which is not only an all-time high area under it this year but also higher than what area the state had covered in past 10 years from 2009 to 2019.  Experts said that a minimum of 12.37 lakh litres of Pendimethalin has been used in the state because the recommended dose is one litre per acre at the time of the sowing of paddy with DSR technique.  This year the minimum sale of Pendimethalin herbicide must be 12.37 lakh litres and it may have exceeded from it as at some places farmers have even used 1.5 to 2.0 litres per acre, said Pesticides and Fertilisers Association (SPFA), Punjab, state president Mohinder Pal Singh Khalsa, adding that this herbicide is also used in moong pulse, cane, mattar (green peas) but the area under all these crops is quite less as compare to paddy.  It has seen all time high sale in Punjab this time because this is the only available pre-emergent herbicide in the state for DSR, he said.  The maximum herbicide I have sold this year was pre-emergent Pendimethalin because in our area around 50 to 60 per cent farmers adopted DSR, said Kulwant Singh, the owner of Rana Pesticides in Shahkot area, adding that earlier Pendimethalin used to remain unsold at his store.  There are over 10,000 pesticide dealers in Punjab and almost everyone has sold it, Khalsa said.  We recommended one-litre Pendimethalin for one acre at the time of sowing, said principal agronomist Makhan Singh Bhullar of Punjab Agriculture University (PAU), Ludhiana.  If this is banned then there is no alternative available to the farmers at the moment and it will definitely affect the DSR sowing in future but for that farmers can go for double pre-sowing irrigation or rauni before final sowing of paddy with DSR. As after the first rauni, the first flush of weeds will appear in some days which can be uprooted with light cultivation and then the second rauni is done and the leftover weeds will grow in the second flush which can also be removed with light cultivation before the final sowing of paddy with DSR technique. And then farmers can go for hand pulling of weeds if some of them appear after germination of paddy plants, said Dr Bhullar, adding that with this farmers can avoid the usage of herbicides in DSR fields. Pendimathlin has been in use for over three decades for controlling weeds in various crops.  In 2019-20 Punjab had used 4,930 metric tonnes pesticides which included 2,317 tonnes of herbicides, 2,119 tonnes of insecticides, and around 500 tonnes fungicides.  The usage of herbicides is maximum in the state as experts said that crops have less danger from the insects than the weeds.  Even some international companies have stopped making insecticides now and they are only focusing on the herbicides, said Khalsa, adding that in the traditional method of paddy transplantation farmers use herbicides after the transplanting of paddy nursery in the puddled field but those herbicides have several alternative and farmers use them as per their wish but in case of Pendimethalin there is no option.  A senior officer requesting anonymity in the Punjab Agriculture department said that they have written to the Centre pointing about the trouble with banning Pendimethalin.",GREEN GRAM DAL (MOONG DAL)

However, incessant rainfall during the second half of June and in July has resulted in crop damage, though negligible, on over 29,529 hectares as rainwater gushed into low-lying areas in parts of Kalaburagi district.  According to the rainfall data available with The Hindu, against a normal rainfall of 278 mm between June 1 and August 6, the district received 412 mm rainfall. Some taluks such as Kalamapur and Sedam recorded 521 mm rainfall against a normal rainfall of 289 mm and 457 mm rainfall against a normal rainfall of 273 mm, respectively.  Aland and Kalaburagi taluks received 438 mm rainfall against a normal 293 mm rainfall.

Latitude by The Park Chennai  After a decade of elegant tea parties, Latitude by The Park Chennai closed their Good Earth location in July last year. Now, it is back, but in a 2020 avatar: as a cloud kitchen. But, unlike many of the other lockdown launches, this one is helmed by a luxury hotels kitchen.  Very honestly, we always wanted to revive it, says Ashutosh Nerlekar, executive chef, explaining that the relaxed space had inspired a distinctly European caf-style menu, deliberately different from 601, the hotels trendy coffee shop.  There is an emphasis on sandwiches, burger and appetisers. We have retained classics from the old menu, but also introduced a pukka local section with egg podimas, kothu parotta and podi idli, says Chef Ashutosh.  However, given that Latitude runs out of the 601 kitchen, their edge seems to be the classic five star breakfast, he adds. This includes omelettes with hash browns, grilled tomatoes and sausages (245), as well as their popular French toast stuffed with mascarpone, topped with berry compote and Chantilly cream. (225)  Meanwhile at 601, which has already been on Swiggy for a year, Chef Ashutosh has started running weekend specials, highlighting their strengths. It is a competitive market now: everyday you have a new cloud kitchen launched, he says, explaining why they need to stay on their toes, despite offering a menu that is priced at about 30% less than their dine-in menu.  So far the specials have featured Bento boxes, a Mediterranean trail and a burger menu. The hotel also did Ribs n Bellies from their Thai restaurant, Lotus. This week, the plan is an all-dessert menu, served in mason jars.  Of course, with the current Sunday Lockdown, you are going to have to shift all your celebratory brunch plans to Saturday for now. And maybe save some of that French toast for your Sunday porridge. (Vaccine not included. Yet.)  Call The Park on 9962288601 to order from Latitude or the weekend menu.

120,120.0,,,2020-08-14,https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/pune/crop-insurance-soybean-farmers-65-sown-area-insured-6554821/,"he orders were issued in regards with complaints of germination failure reported by farmers from various parts of the state. (Representational)  Soybean farmers in Maharashtra have taken the lead when it comes to insuring their crop. Latest data from the department of agriculture shows that out of 41.67 lakh hectares of the oilseed sown in the state, 27.58 lakh hectares have been insured under Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY).  Data shows that soybean farmers are leading in insuring their crop, as around 65 per cent of soybean sown area has come under insurance. The oilseed is a major crop in Marathwada and Vidarbha, along with cotton, pigeon pea (toor), moong and urad. Farmers from these areas, where maximum vagaries of nature are reported, have taken the lead.  The oilseed, which stays on the fields for around 120 days, is also the most popular crop in the state with 31 per cent of the total 1.37 crore hectares cropped area this season. Kapas (raw unginned seed cotton) comes a close second with 41.45 lakh hectares of sowing. Toor (12.19 lakh hectares) and maize (8.53 lakh hectares) are some other popular crops in the state.  Soybean growers in the state point to greater risk, as compared to growing other crops like cotton or toor. Vilash Ufade, a soybean grower from Latur district, said in the last few years, heavy rain during September-October had become more of a norm than an exception in the state. The rain coincides with the harvesting time of the crop and, in many cases, crop damage reported by farmers is almost 100 per cent, he said.  Ufade also said unlike the oilseed, cotton had a longer duration on the fields, ensuring some yield for farmers. Cotton growers take multiple picking of their crop so even if early picking in October is lost, subsequent pickings allow farmers to get returns on their crop, he added.  Farmers in the state have given a thumbs up to the crop insurance scheme, which has faced heavy criticism from certain quarters with some farmer groups saying it was not farmer-friendly. The last date for farmer registration for the process ended on July 31, while banks are expected to complete the work of updating servers by August 15.  Consolidated data till August 11 shows that 99.06 lakh farmers have taken part in the scheme, under which 52.96 lakh hectares of crop area has been insured. Farmers have paid around Rs 474.24 crore (the net of state and central governments contribution) as contribution to the premium, which sums up to Rs 4,910.9 crore as collected by the state.  In the state, non-loanee farmers (those relying on institutional finance for farming activity)  for whom participation is voluntary  exceed the number of loanee farmers, when it comes to enrolment under the scheme.",GREEN GRAM DAL (MOONG DAL)

Anyone who has watched the serial or spent a significant amount of time in the company of North Indian grandparents will know the phrase Birbal ki khichri. The khichri in the popular story is not an actual dish but a proverbial one, and the moral is that a ray of hope is all it takes to inspire a hardworking person to realise his dreams.Drawing from this story, Michelin-starred chef Suvir Saran has created a recipe by the same name. With this, I wanted to share that even humble beginnings can take one soaring with pride into the stratosphere. If a bimaaron ki khichri (khichri for patients) can be turned into a gourmet dining experience, humans too can reach for the stars with their own drive, vision and determination when there is a level playing field and societal support, says the sprightly chef who has returned to India after a successful stint in the US and launched The House of Celeste restaurant in Gurgaon.Why a khichri though? When I crave comfort food, it is most often dreams of khichri that captivate my imagination, he says.Back to rootsKhichri, perhaps one of Indias most-loved soul foods, is essentially a one-pot meal of lentils, rice and vegetables that is transported to another dimension via multiple layers of spices  every bite is a new discovery of tastes and textures. The Birbal ki khichri that the chef grew up eating at home includes panch phoran (a spice blend of whole cumin, fennel, fenugreek, nigella seeds and mustard seeds) that are fried in ghee or clarified butter with coriander and tomatoes, and then a second boost of spice from a ghee-bloomed blend of more cumin, some cayenne, and oniony asafoetida.It is such an incredible dish that there is even a legend behind it, says Saran. This khichri originated in mid-16th century India, when Birbal, an official at Emperor Akbars court, taught the emperor a lesson by claiming to have cooked the khichri.When I crave comfort food, it is most often dreams of khichri that captivate my imaginationAt our house, we like to say that if its good enough for Akbar and Birbal, its good enough for you, laughs the chef. This dish is so lovely that I often just serve it with nothing but some raita, achaar if youre craving spice, and perhaps crispy poppadum on the side. Follow the recipe a few times and then begin to play with the flavours and simplify it as you like, he adds.How did this dish make it to his home? I belong to the Kayasth community, who were the first Hindus to marry into the Muslim community. They were the epitome of the Ganga-Jamuna culture. Our foods, music, dance, dress, language and traditions take the best of the two communities and put them together into beautiful mosaics that make the individual elements shine and remain relevant, explains Saran. In Kayasth homes, khichri, tehri, Kabuli pulao and biryanis are common fare. The pairing of rice and lentils is a given exercise almost daily in some way, shape or form.Twist in the taleWhile the medicinal rice-and-lentil porridge or mareezon ki khichri is made when the stomach needs rest, a sabz-daar or vegetable-rich khichri is made when the mind needs a reflective moment to meditate on the senses of taste, touch, scent, and sight.Saran adds a tweak to the traditional home recipe. I fry the moong dal in a pan to make it darker in colour and for its natural oils to be released. This nutty flavour becomes the faint yet easily-savoured spine of the dish. My family and relatives make many versions of khichri with vegetables, but none has the sequential addition of flavours that my recipe has! he winks.Saran recalls how his dads uncle, a retired IAS officer, made this for his family when they briefly moved from Delhi to Nagpur where his father, a bureaucrat, was posted. Mausaji and mausiji were visiting us and he made this for us for dinner. A most beautiful gift. I am sure mausajis work with the Nizam of Hyderabad might have had some role in the roots of this dish. Perhaps this memory also gave me the confidence to cook without caring about the bullying I might face as a boy who cooked. We found the khada masalas (whole spices) and the use of vegetables a most incredible departure from the usual boring-yet-comforting khichri. Moms adoption of the recipe in our family culinary repertoire was quick, says Saran who has found this dish comforting since he was six years old.With his Birbal ki khichri recipe, Saran honours his mausajis legacy with a 21st century update. This is my homage to his skills, his nurturing nature, and his confidence in being a man who could cook with carefree abandon. Memories of food remain with us until our very end. This is one memory that will forever keep any other khichri from seducing me, he says.Recipe: Birbal ki Khichri (serves 10-12)Ingredients:For the topping6 to 8 cups/1.4 to 1.9 l peanut oil4 large red onions, halved and thinly-sliced1/4 cup/4 g finely-chopped fresh coriander2-inch/5 cm piece fresh gingerroot, peeled and thinly-sliced into very thin matchsticks1 -2 green chillies, finely minced (remove the seeds for less heat)1 tablespoon/15 ml lime juice1/2 teaspoon garam masala powderFor the khichri1 cup/190 g split and hulled mung dal2 tablespoons/30 g ghee or clarified butter10 green cardamon pods8 whole cloves3 bay leaves2-inch/5 cm cinnamon stick1 teaspoon panch phoran3/4 teaspoon turmeric1/8 teaspoon asafoetida1 cup/185 g basmati rice1/2 medium cauliflower, divided into very small florets1 medium red potato, cut into 1/2-inch pieces4 medium carrots, peeled and finely chopped10-ounce/285 g bag frozen green peasFor the first tempering2 tablespoons/30 g ghee or clarified butter1/2 teaspoon panch phoran1 large red onion, halved and thinly sliced1 tablespoons kosher salt or sea salt, or to taste2 teaspoons ground coriander seeds2 large tomatoes, finely diced1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepperSecond tempering oil2 tablespoons/30 g ghee or clarified butter1/2 teaspoon cumin seeds1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper1 pinch asafoetidaMethod:Heat the oil in a large Dutch oven (use enough oil to fill the saucepan to a 2-inch/5 cm depth) over medium-high heat until it reaches 350F/177C on an instant-read thermometer. Add the onions and fry until crisp and browned, about two minutes, turning the onions occasionally. Use a slotted spoon or frying spider to transfer the onions to a paper towel-lined plate and set aside.In a small bowl stir the coriander leaves, ginger, jalapeo, and lime juice together and set aside.Place the mung dal in a large skillet over medium heat and toast it until it is fragrant and lightly golden for three to five minutes. Transfer the dal to a large plate and set aside.Place the ghee, cardamom, cloves, bay leaves, cinnamon, panch phoran, turmeric, and hing into the pan and roast it over medium heat until the spices are fragrant, about two minutes.Add the rice, toasted dal, cauliflower, potatoes and carrots and cook until the rice becomes translucent and the cauliflower sweats, three to five minutes, stirring often. Pour in seven cups/1.65 l water, increase the heat to high and bring to a boil. Add the peas, bring back to a boil, reduce the heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer for 20 minutes.While the rice and dal mixture cooks, make the first tempering oil. Heat the ghee and panch phoran in a large skillet over medium heat until the cumin in the panch phoran begins to brown, for two to three minutes. Stir in the onions and the salt and cook until the onions are browned around the edges and soft, for about 10 minutes. If the onions begin to get too dark or stick to the pan bottom, splash the pan with a few tablespoons of water and scrape up the browned bits. Stir in the coriander and cook, stirring, for two minutes, and then stir in the tomatoes and the cayenne, cooking until the tomatoes are jammy, six to eight minutes, stirring occasionally. Turn off the heat and set aside.Once the rice and dal are cooked, remove the lid and use a potato masher to smash the mixture until only a few carrots and peas remain whole (remove the whole or large spices while mashing if you like). Stir in the first tempering along with the remaining three cups/720 ml of water. Return to boil and cook for two minutes. Turn off the heat.Make the second tempering oil. Wipe the pan from the first tempering oil and heat the ghee for the second tempering oil over medium heat along with the cumin, cayenne, and hing and cook, stirring often, until the cumin begins to brown, about two minutes. Immediately stir it into the rice and dal mixture.Divide the khichri between six bowls and top with some of the ginger mixture, a pinch of garam masala, and the fried onions and serve.Follow @lubnasalim1234 on TwitterFrom HT Brunch, August 23, 2020Follow us on twitter.com/HTBrunchConnect with us on facebook.com/hindustantimesbrunch",GREEN GRAM DAL (MOONG DAL)

This estimate was revealed by a survey, based on a statistical model.This years loss is just 20% of the damage that was suffered in the floods of 2019. The debilitating floods in July, August and September of last year damaged crops on 2.2 lakh hectares. The damaged crops include sugarcane on 17,877 hectares, green gram on 8,500 hectares, maize on 6,043 hectares, paddy on 3,014 hectares, soya on 1,710 hectares, sunflower on 490 hectares, and other crops like niger and minor millet on 177 hectares. Joint Director of Agriculture Shivanagouda Patil said a joint survey by officers of Revenue, Agriculture, Horticulture, and Sericulture departments will begin as soon as the waters subside. Modern technology tools like GPS and GIS will be used, he said.According to officers, the initial estimates are done by matching area under cultivation with the cultivable land in villages affected by floods. This is a table-top assessment. It is done to help us prepare for the actual, on the ground survey. It also helps the State government to take a fair idea of the quantum of the calamity, a senior officer said.Due to early rains in May and June and return of farm labourers to villages from cities during and after lockdown, farmers surpassed cultivation targets. A total 6.8 lakh hectares were cultivated as against the target of six lakh hectares. The crops include sugacane, paddy, soya, millet, niger, sunflower, maize, and others.Rainfall in the district completed its annual quota in the first eight months. The district received 1,700 mm of rainfall till August 20, which is slightly more than the aggregated annual rainfall of 1,640 mm, officers said. Added to the problem was the release of waters from 11 reservoirs in Maharashtra into the Krishna and its six tributaries in Belagavi district. The release has been around 15 lakh cusecs over 45 days, officers said.Unkept promiseFarmers leaders complained that the State government has not properly compensated those who lost crops last year. Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa promised us that the State government would add to the compensation released as under NDRF and calamity relief norms. But he did not keep his word. We have got only the relief amount fixed as per the NDRF and calamity norms, said Jayashree Gurannanavar, a Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha leader. According to her, the amount is small and does not help farmers recover their losses.",GREEN GRAM DAL (MOONG DAL)

At present, the flood levels hover between 3 lakh and 3.5 lakh cusecs and there has been no significant crop damage on both the banks of the Krishna river.However, they are worried as they will suffer losses if the flood levels cross the 5 lakh cusecs mark, and pray that it wont happen. Last year, they were at the receiving end of the flood fury in the Krishna river.Several farmers, particularly those who cultivated cotton, maize, vegetables and turmeric, had suffered losses last year. Most of the losses were reported downstream Prakasam barrage. Now, we hope the floods recede in 2-3 days and if the water level increases further, standing crops may be affected, explained M Vijaya Bharathi, agriculture joint director in Guntur district.According to her, as of today, no crop damage has been reported and a few acres of maize cultivated in the river islands downstream Prakasam Barrage has suffered some damage. If the flood continues, the cotton cultivated upstream the barrage along the river course might be affected.Similar situation prevails in Krishna district and there has been no reports of any horticulture corp damage either in delta or in uplands of the district.In fact, officials felt that the flood levels at the current discharge rate might prove beneficial, if they do not continue for more than three days. It will be helpful for the paddy cultivated in the delta mandals and increase the ground-water levels.As per the preliminary corp damage report due to rains and floods in August till date submitted to the district collector, standing crop in 4,003 hectares was affected. Green gram in 2,448 hectares, which was at harvesting stage, was affected, followed by paddy in 919 hectares, cotton in 474 hectares, black gram in 135 hectares, groundnut in 12 hectares, chillies in 10 heaters and maize in 5 hectares.Though there has been no flood damage reported in Kurnool district, where heavy inflows in both Krishna and Tungabhadra river were reported, continuous rains since last 10 days have proven fatal for maize crop in Atmakur, Pamulapadu, Kotapalle and Nandikotkur areas of the district. According to the district Agriculture joint director, maize in 6,711 hectares suffered damage due to waterlogging induced stem rot. Farmers are now removing the crop from the fields to use it as fodder and replacing it with black gram. Heavy rains also affected cotton crops in 4,793 hectares and farmers hope that they will at least get single picking. Groundnut in around 1,100 hectares was also affected due to heavy rains.Meanwhile, heavy floods in Godavari has inundated paddy crops in 2,400 hectares in the delta region of West Godavari district while around 250 hectares in Polavaram mandal was affected. Cotton cultivated in 40 hectares in Polavaram, Veleripad area was affected. Officials said the real extent of the crop damage can only be known after enumeration, which will be taken up as soon as the floods recede.In East Godavari district, paddy crop in 3,163 hectares in 101 villages of 23 mandals, which was at tillering stage, was inundated. Six hundred hectares in Mummidivaram and 300 hectares in Sitanagaram mandals were inundated. Cotton cultivated in 255 hectares of 25 villages in three mandals  Nelipaka, Kunavaram and Seetanagaram  suffered inundation. Maize cultivated in 255 hectares in Seethanagaram mandal was affected.According to experts, the crop damage due to floods in the State so far is very marginal, thanks to the absence of rains and floods at the same time. In fact, the floods were due to the heavy rains in upper catchment areas.",GREEN GRAM DAL (MOONG DAL)

The appetite, evidently, has not gone into a recession despite the havoc caused by the virus. For many in the state, mornings still begin with khakhra and chai. As the day progresses, the snack platter loads up with crunchy profusion: fafda, ganthiya, chavanu, chevdo, and fulwadi.No wonder then that the distressed businesspersons of Gujarat are hoping to endure in the crisis by banking on a service needed now more than ever: the home delivery of comfort food!Priyam Kapadia, 29, the owner of a successful event management company , recently launched a startup, House of Farsan, with his childhood friend Gaurang Chudasama.

In Chudasamas case, the sales of heavy saris have dropped as people scale down weddings in the new normal.But all through the lockdown, food  especially farsan  was a source of major solace for Gujarati families, said Kapadia. We launched our startup by sourcing the choicest farsan and namkeen from popular brands all over Gujarat and delivering them to peoples homes.Chudasama said that the startup offers khakhra, puri, and kachori. Besides, we have aggregated the famed moong from Bhadran, ganthiya from Surendranagar and Bhavnagar, and peanuts from Bharuch, Chudasama said.

From teaching the English tongue, he has moved on to providing what pleases the Gujarati palate. As people cannot travel, they desperately want their favourite farsan, Mehta said. Among the popular items are Nadiads bhusu and Vadodaras lilo chevdo. I forayed into this business as people love their snacks. Mehta recently launched his startup, Eatzy.

But in a world struck by a pandemic, festivities, as in the case of most other occasions, are subdued.Onam is celebrated to commemorate King Mahabali, who is said to visit Kerala during this time. And every year, the Delhi Malayalee Association (DMA), a socio-cultural organisation that brings Keralites across Delhi-NCR together under one roof, has elaborate plans to ring in this harvest festival. Celebrations last for nearly three months, interspersed with cultural and religious activities. However, this time around, gatherings have been restricted to peoples homes, the stage to perform is now a webinar, and the applause that reverberates through an auditorium will now take a digital turn.READ: Happy Onam 2020: All you need to know about the 10 days of celebrationEvery year, on Onam, we conduct lavish celebrations on a large scale at an auditorium or stadium in the Capital. A week before Onam, we organise athapookalam (rangoli) competitions, in which several people across the National Capital Region participate with gusto. This year, we didnt feel it was right to hold such a large celebration, as the world is in a crisis. Having said that, we will hold a small programme online on August 30 evening, wherein short performances will take place, says C Chandran, general secretary, DMA, who affirms that although we are going through tough times, we cannot let it overcome festive spirit. This is being done more to boost the morale of people, rather than as a means of celebration, he adds.Onam celebrations were held at Delhis Siri Fort Auditorium last year.Every year, children who excel at academics are felicitated as part of celebrations. The association will continue with this tradition this year as well, only this time, it will be an online affair. We should not disappoint the kids, insists Chandran.The association is also getting together to help those in need, both financially and otherwise. We are all away from home (Kerala), but the reason we are continuing this is because we should not forget out culture. We need to teach our younger generations all about our culture and traditions, so we are seeing this (online celebration) as an opportunity to help our future generations stay rooted, he adds.And how can celebrations be complete without a quintessential feast or an Onam Sadhya, comprising a range of delectable dishes  both sweets and savories  that are a treat to the eyes and the palate. So, if you are also planning to celebrate at home, here are some lip-smacking recipes you could try out to revel in festivities.Puli InjiTo make this sweet and sour chutney-like culinary treat, you will need  cup ginger (finely chopped), 3tsp tamarind paste or 250g tamarind pulp, 100g green chilli (finely chopped),  tsp turmeric powder,  tsp red chilli powder,  tsp mustard seeds, 5 small onions (finely chopped; optional), 2-3 dry red chillies (broken),  cup jaggery, 2 sprigs curry leaves, 3tbsp coconut oil,1 cups water, salt to tasteMethod: Soak the tamarind in a cup of hot water for about 10-15 minutes.

(Representational)Ahead of what promises to be a bumper crop of pulses, wholesale prices across major markets in the country have gone below the government-declared Minimum Selling Price (MSP). Market sources rule out any drastic price rise in pulses as demand is expected to remain low for the next few quarters.For the present kharif season, India has reported plantation of pulse on over 119.59 lakh hectares, an increase from 114.77 lakh hectares the previous season. Moong bean has seen the highest increase from 27.54 lakh hectares last year to 32.13 lakh hectares this season. Barring moong, all other crops have shown single digit rise in acreages. Farmers in Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh have reported some damage to their harvest-ready crop due to the torrential rains towards the end of August.Across mandis wholesale prices have been correcting themselves even as the harvest is yet to hit the market. In case of Moong, prices have shown a sharp correction in August, which has dampened the chances of any drastic price rise in immediate future. Back in July, the average price of moong beans across the country was Rs 7,271.05 per quintal, which corrected to Rs 6,646.34 in August. Further correction, traders say, can not be ruled out once the crop starts hitting the market. For the present season, the MSP of moong is Rs 7,196, which traders say, seems difficult to reach. Nitin Kalantari, a prominent dal trader and miller in Latur district of Maharashtra, said the pulse will trade below its MSP for most of the season.As against the 1.5 lakh tonnes quota allocated for imports, traders in India have managed to ship in only about 80,000-90,000 tonnes.International prices were higher than domestic prices and it made no sense to import the pulse, he said.. Similarly, another short-duration pulse, urad, which is expected to hit the markets in September, has shown a downward slide just before the arrival of the new crop. In July, the average traded price of urad was Rs 6,344.38 per quintal, which corrected to Rs 5,891.1 per quintal in August. Just about 1 lakh tonnes of the allocated 4 lakh tonnes import quota has arrived in the country. Tur, another major kharif pulse, is also expected to trade below its MSP of Rs 6,000 per quintal.Traders point to the general slowdown in the market for their pessimistic outlook. They said that during the lockdown, domestic households had stocked up their supplies and the same is expected to last for some more time. Also, slowdown in the hotel catering and restaurant business, the traders said, would affect price realisation in the season. The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

But, as cliched it might sound, all of them, as they themselves put it, started from scratch. People, experiences and incidents, which helped them see cooking food as not a daily chore but as an art form, are the only reasons, as chefs Ranveer Brar, Manish Mehrotra, Sarah Todd, Sabyasachi Gorai (Saby) and Pankaj Bhadouria unanimously agree, helped them reach places in their careers.Make mistakesManish Mehrotra is one of the first names that comes to a mind when one thinks about Pan Asian food in the country. His take on Indian food with an international accent is now inspiring many, but if it wasnt for chefs Ananda Solomon and Johnson Esso, things might have been different.Manish Mehrotra credits chefs Ananda Solomon and Johnson Esso for helping him become a top chef in the country.They gave me that space to learn, understood me as a person, and the biggest thing was probably that they let me make mistakes. For example while I was learning Wok, which is a tricky thing to learn because you are doing it on high flame, tossing it, so for a newcomer its quite scary. So many times, we dropped the pan, or ended up burning our hands. But, Chef Jhonson was extremely patient, he recalls.These two people are someone he absolutely adores and looks up to. For the simple reason, because they told me knowing who you are cooking for is as important as knowing what you are cooking, he says.So many times, Chef Solomon used to send us to the area where guests were seated and were eating our food. The idea was to see their expression, after the first bite. Then we also followed a half eaten dish back sent back to the kitchen. He used to tell us that if a customer has sent a dish, after paying for it, back to the kitchen, it can either be that they are full, or the dish is badly prepared. That means theres a fifty percent chance that they didnt like, adds Mehrotra.The (ad)spice of lifeEk chutki namak, or ek chutki chini ki kimat mujhe pata hai, says chef Pankaj Bhadouria and laughs out as she explains that in her culinary school, the first few lessons, are the basics of cooking, which she learnt from her parents.My mom was a Bengali. So she taught me that, Har namkeen chiz me ek chutki chini, aur har mithi chiz me ek chutki namak dalna zaroori hai. These are taste enhancers, and this was probably one of the most important lessons I have learnt, that, is perhaps the most important thing I tell my students as well.That, and her fathers advice on namak mirchi. My father used to tell me, jab take namak-mirchi nahi nahi hogi, such bhai chiz chi nahi lagegi. Or Tu moong ki daal me bhi, sahi namak mirchi dalegi to woh bhi bahot achi lagegi. Right seasoning is very important, she says adding that without these two important pieces of advice from her parents, she wouldnt have learnt the art of cooking.Self - beliefFor Saby, there arent one or two names from the culinary world that influenced him. I would like to pass on some of this mentoring, learning and talent transfers and most importantly the attitude that I have picked up from working with so many people around the world. There are so many people who have come and influenced my career more importantly I would say have influenced my life as a person, he says.Chef Saby considers Chef Tatsuya Sekiguchi as one of his mentors.Starting right from his college days, from Australia to US to Paris, Sabys list of people who he has been influenced by, is endless.They gave me the confidence that yes I can stand in the kitchen and cook, no matter how good or bad it was or how long it took. They told me that I have the ability to be in kitchen because I think that the biggest fear for anybody who was coming from a humble and middle class background. he says.Time is the best teacherIt might be cliched thing to say, but time, for chef Ranveer Brar, has been the best teacher, apart from 50 others names or so, who have mentored the chef through his 25-year-long career. Various people at various points in my life and career have influenced and mentored me. But I think there is no bigger teacher than time, your own journey and experience, he says adding that these two things, help a person, look at food as journey.My advice to young chefs is only this. They shouldnt hurry or look for short cuts. Food is not just knowing a recipe. In fact knowing the recipe is at the bottom. Recipe is just information. To become you should acquire knowledge about food, which can only only come through travelling, meeting different people, he signs off.Cooking with loveCooking is not a chore, and someone who loves to create dishes, this is probably the first thing they should learn as pointed by chef Saraf Todd, who credits her mother, Lorraine Todd for teaching her the basic of cooking with love, which, apart from many of her mothers teachings, helped Sarah in becoming the globally renowned chef, that she is today.Sarah Todd credits her mother, Lorraine Todd, for teaching her the basics of cooking.From a very young age, I remember baking with my mum. Every Christmas we would create these huge cookie jars for all our family members. We would spend days baking together and filling large jars with these delicate sweets. These ended up being everyones favourite gift. It was that moment I realised cooking could be a way to peoples hearts, she tells us.It just so happens, my mum works in education and has for 28 years. Listening to her speak to children is incredible. I have learnt so many life lessons from her, not only in raising my child but also in the way I live my life, she adds.Interact with the author on Twitter/@sammysamarth",GREEN GRAM DAL (MOONG DAL)

The sale of frozen corn, green peas, paneer, even cut vegetables mixes are also selling off fast in the last few months. Besides, the sale of instant food like noodles, pasta has also gone up, said Bibhuti Bhusan Patra, a retail-store owner in Unit-1 market.He said, even packets of ready-to-cook breakfast items like Poha, Upma, Idli mix are selling more. Besides, with kids cooped at home snacks like potato popcorn, vegetable cutlets are in demand while people are also buying ready to cook food items like Dal Makhni, Matar Paneer, Rajma Masala.These ready-to-cook food items are easy to make and children will not show any tantrum while eating. Otherwise managing household chores, office work, cooking and kids would be draining, said Priyanka Rath, an IT professional.Frozit, the frozen food brand of Ruchi Foods, said the sale of ready to cook and frozen food products increased by 40-50% during the lockdown. After the outbreak of corona pandemic and lockdown people have to stay indoors for a long time so they realise the need for frozen and ready-to-cook foods as they can be cooked in lesser time without much effort. This helped people to manage without maids and cooks and with restaurants and food joints closed, said Rashmi Sahu, director of Om Oils and Four Mills Ltd popularly known for Ruchi Brand of products. Even after the relaxation of lockdown people were cautious about buying cooked food from restaurants and about human contacts involved during delivery so they prefer ready to cook and ready to eat foods.While the pandemic hit the majority of sectors really hard, the food industry and especially the frozen, ready-to-cook and instant food industry managed to run the show and also made profits. Surviving the pandemic was not without challenges as we have to keep the motivation level of our workers and sales team high to come out to work when the whole world was locked up for safety reasons. Since hygiene and sanitation has been our top priority even during the pre-covid period, our workers get acquainted with the new normal soon, Sahu said adding they resumed production in April with 30% capacity and 24X7 to meet the increasing demands of their products.The lockdown has also given them an opportunity to expand their products and to think innovatively. During the lockdown the major festival of Raja came and we thought of packing Poda Pitha a delicacy served on the occasion. It was a hit and we thought of continuing with it. Similarly with kids at home people looked for healthy snacks so we thought of adding multi-grain breads and buns to our bakery items. Similarly or vermicelli, chhatua, chuda and ragi powder, khir mix are healthy and nutritious breakfast options and are highly saleable, she pointed out.Apart from home delivery facilities, the Ruchi and Frozit brand of products are quite popular in Amazon and Flipkart claimed Sahu adding thatthey are going to launch their dedicated e-commerce platform soon. Frozit is going to launch a wide range of cereals and snacks including oats, cornflakes, moong dal, Bhujia Sev and muffins in October, she added.",GREEN GRAM DAL (MOONG DAL)

Early sown paddy is at panicle initiation to harvesting stage. Early Kharif pulses are at flowering to pod formation stage.Early sown groundnut and sesame are at flowering to pod formation and harvesting stage. Sunflower is in the flowering to grain setting stage. Cotton is at vegetative to boll formation stage. Sugarcane is at cane formation stage. Special Commissioner for Agriculture Arun Kumar said as on September 10, as against 37.4 lakh hectares of normal area for Kharif, 32.39 lakh hectares have been covered already with different crops, which are at different stages of cultivation. Further 17.4 lakh hectares were also covered with various horticulture crops. As against the 17.5 lakh tonnes of different types of fertilisers, till September 10, as much as 15.55 lakh metric tonnes have been sold and another 7.58 lakh metric tonnes are available.Out of the 13 districts, crop situation is encouraging in 11 districts, while two districts  Srikakulam and Vizianagaram  which received deficient rainfall so far, yield will be less than expected. It is not a complete crop loss, but the yield would be less than expected, a senior official from the agriculture department said.Srikakulam and Vizianagaram received 30.3 per cent and 20.4 per cent deficient rainfall which was discouraging for the farmers in the two districts, who expected a normal rainfall. About 22 out of 34 mandals were affected due to lack of rains in Vizianagaram and out of those 22, as many as 13 are severely affected.However, in Visakhapatnam and twin Godavari districts, crop situation is better and agriculture officials are confident of getting maximum yield this season. While Visakhapatnam received normal rainfall so far, twin Godavari districts recorded 20 and 25 per cent surplus rainfall. Recent Godavari floods only saw a marginal acreage of crops (around 4,000 hectares) getting inundated.In Krishna district, rainfall as on date has been 10 per cent more than normal and even then it is considered normal. While paddy has received optimum water for irrigation, floods in Krishna river saw 30 per cent damage to green gram cultivated in upland areas of western mandals of the district.While farmers in Nellore are busy selling paddy they harvested to the paddy procurement centres, farmers in Chittoor, which received second highest surplus rainfall this monsoon till date, are cultivating different crops. It is Anantapur district which received the highest surplus rainfall of 68.9 per cent and the farmers have taken up traditional groundnut and other crops. Focus is more on horticulture crops. In Kadapa and Kurnool, which received surplus rainfall, farmers expect a bumper harvest, if everything goes well till the end.",GREEN GRAM DAL (MOONG DAL)

For bulk lifting it has offered states to take the required quantity from buffer stock held by NAFED at Rs 77-78 per kg for raw moong and at Rs 92-93 per kg in the case of milled moong. The pulses lifted from the central buffer stock can be sold at governments retail outlets including the fair price shops or ration shops.Till now the Centre had been offering pulses from the buffer stock to states for meeting requirements of different welfare schemes.Other pulses such as arhar, chana, urad are likely to be under this new scheme.The option to lift the stocks in raw form or in bulk is up to the state and UT to decide. In addition, order for retail packs of 500 gram and one kg can also be placed for retailing in the fair price shops of PDS and other marketing retail outlets of the state government such as dairy and horticulture outlets, the ministry said in its letter to the states. They have been asked to provide the name of the nodal officer so that process can start immediately.The prices of milled moong has been hovering around Rs 104 per kg in Delhi while in Mumbai the price is around Rs 144.The Centre has been maintaining the buffer stock of major agricultural crops including onion and pulses to bring down price volatility and the new retail supply intervention scheme has been conceptualised for the same purpose.Ministry sources said the policy action will be initiated taking into consideration prevailing prices and expected trends. States and UTs can lift the pulses as per their demand at the declared price. The states can lift stock of raw or milled pulses in bulk on the basis of MSP+10%. The additional cost of 10% has been finalised to cover warehousing and interest cost. The Centre will bear the transportation and dealers margin as well.",GREEN GRAM DAL (MOONG DAL)

Forest department personnel are conducting a probe to find if they were purposely poisoned.Seeing the peafowls dead in their fields farmer gathered the carcass and informed the forest department in Kovilpatti and the animal husbandry department. Preliminary inquiry revealed that it is the beginning of the crop season and some farmers mix seeds with pesticide to avert early damage to the crops while some mix it with DAP for good growth and the birds could have consumed the seeds.Veterinarian Kanimozhi from Ilayarasanendal veterinary hospital conducted autopsy on the birds and collected vital samples to be sent for forensic analysis to ascertain the cause of their deaths. After autopsy she told reporters that indigested corn was found in the stomach of the birds.

(Representational)Wholesale prices of almost all pulses have appreciated amid reports of crop damage due to heavy August rains, which has also made the initial forecast of a bumper crop of pulses look increasingly uncertain. After moong and urad, prices of tur have also firmed up as market sources report crop damage in north of Karnataka.On Tuesday, traders at Laturs wholesale market in Maharashtra talked about a Rs 600 per quintal rise in the average traded price of pulses. Trading at Rs 6,500 per quintal, tur is well above its government minimum support price (MSP) of Rs 6,000.Nitin Kalantri, a Latur-based dal miller, said, Prices of tur dal have touched Rs 90 per kg in Latur and crossed the Rs 100 mark in cities like Pune and Mumbai.After Maharashtra, Karnataka, especially its northern part, is a major hub of tur cultivation.While the crop is yet to arrive in the market, delay in issuing import licences by the central government has also pushed up prices, traders said. India allows import of 4 lakh tonnes (lt) of the pulse with the government normally allowing processors to complete imports before the arrival of the domestic crop. This year, import licences were not issued so prices have firmed up. While demand for the dal remains low, prices have risen in anticipation of a reduced crop, Kalantri said.The average traded price of tur across the wholesale markets for September is Rs 5,831.26 per quintal as compared to Rs 5,283.37 in August. Traders said tur would trade near its MSP once harvest starts.This year, farmers have grown pulses over 137.81 lakh hectares as compared to 131.76 lakh hectares last year.Reports of damage to the standing urad and moong crop have also come in from Madhya Pradesh. Both moong and urad are short duration crops with farmers expected to start harvesting them this month. Dal millers from Madhya Pradesh have spoken about a 10-15 per cent damage to the standing crop due to the August rains. Against the 4 lt quota of allowed imports, millers have imported at least 1 lt with the central government failing to renew import licences when they lapsed in August. At the national level, urad is trading at Rs 5,833.29 per quintal as compared to its MSP of Rs 6,000.The fate of moong, another major kharif pulse, is no different as reports of extensive damage to the crop have come in from various parts of the country. Like tur, the import quota for moong is yet to be released while its harvest season has started. Quality concerns seem to be higher in moong than urad, which has fetched farmers higher than MSP (Rs 7,196 per quintal) for quality produce. At the national level, the pulse is trading at an average price of Rs 8,403.43 per quintal.As rains continue to batter parts of Maharashtra, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, further downward revision in production is not ruled out, sources said.All eyes, however, are on the governments next move with trade sources wary of an onion like kneejerk reaction to control prices. Like in onion, where it banned exports, the government can take steps to cool down prices. But prices will remain bullish for some time at least, said another Latur-based trader.

Her funny mannerisms and upfront personality won over practicall every person that watched her on screen, often making headlines for her antics. The Punjabi actor, who is also known as Punjab ki Katrina Kaif, has been making headlines once again thanks to her monumental weightloss during the coronavirus lockdown. The actor lost around 12 kgs in the past six months, and with no work outs at all. Bet that got your attention!While most of us have been scrolling through social media, saving fitness videos that we will never open, Shehnaaz Gill has gone ahead and made the most of the coronavirus lockdown and lost a bunch of weight, as she wanted to show people that, main bhi patli ho sakti hoon (sic).In an interview with ETimes TV, Shehnaaz shared that given that the coronavirus lockdown caused a lot of work to come to a standstill, she decided she would make the most of her time and lose weight as a lot of people made fun of her weight when she was in the Bigg Boss house, she said, Kai log weight lose karte hain, maine socha chalo logon ko dikhati hoon ki main bhi patli ho sakti hoon. Its not difficult to lose weight if you really want to.So how did she manage to pull it off?

Shehnaaz stopped eating non-vegetarian food, chocolates and ice cream from her diet. She went on to explain that it was how she ate that made the difference, Every day, I ate just one or two things. I wouldnt stuff too much variety in my daily consumption of food. For example, if I ate dal and moong for lunch, I would eat the same for dinner. And I reduced the portions. If I was hungry for two rotis, I ate only one. Mann maarke khati thi.... I lost 12 kg in less than 6 months, but without doing any exercise.

They are trying to mislead farmers on these legislations and politicise the issue,"" Khattar said during a virtual press conference, his first after recovering from coronavirus The chief minister said the state government will fully implement the farm laws and at the same time certain additional protective measures like setting up of ""kisan adalats"" are being contemplated at the state level.Khattar also accused the Congress of promising the Agricultural Produce Market Committee Act in its Lok Sabha election manifesto.When the UPA was in power, the Congress persuaded the party-ruled states to denotify food and vegetables from the Act, he claimed.""They have double standards. When we initiate reforms, they oppose it,"" he said.Khattar claimed that there is a major section among farmers which has come out in support of the legislations.Farmers ""misled"" by the Congress are realising that the legislations are in their interest, Khattar said.Khattar said Congress-ruled states like Punjab and Rajasthan are not procuring crops like maize and bajra on MSP, forcing farmers to sell their produce in Haryana.""However, keeping in mind the interests of Haryana farmers, the state government has now decided not to allow farmers from other states to sell their produce in the state's grain markets,"" he asserted.""The Swaminathan commission's recommendations have been implemented.

There are huge variations in land rates from one place to another place,"" he said.The CM said 201 recommendations of the commission have been implemented.Replying to a question, Khattar said procurement will continue as before and crops will be procured at MSP.The state government has requested the Centre to advance the procurement season from October 1 to September 25, he said, adding that paddy, bajra, maize and moong will be procured at MSP.""We are guaranteeing crop MSP in the mandis and the provisions under the new reforms give farmers a choice to sell crops outside mandis. These reforms only give additional avenues to farmers to fetch better prices for their produce,"" he claimed.Khattar said according to rough estimates, the state government is likely to lose nearly Rs 600-700 crore each year as some farmers were expected to sell their produce outside 'mandis' after the Bills introduced by the Centre take the shape of laws.""We have written to the Centre that if any shortfall is there, they should compensate us,"" he said.",GREEN GRAM DAL (MOONG DAL)

I still remember my visit there. A friend had told us about the restaurant that had then just opened by the Crafts Museum at Pragati Maidan. I went there one evening and was fascinated by the menu  and the food.Id had a chat with Rahul Dua, one of the men running the kitchen, and he told me how they had sourced recipes from various regions. But Dua left the caf soon thereafter. And then, a couple of weeks ago, I got an elaborate menu from him.He has now started a delivery service called Bhawan. It includes an interesting street food component, with dishes from all corners of the country. I happily pored over the menu and zeroed in on a variety of dishes that I thought would make for a snacky lunch or dinner.We asked for a plate of gol gappas (nine with each plate, and your choice of filling and flavoured water), a plate of karela chaat, aloo dum dahi vada, Surti khawsa, keema varqi lukhmi and bhapa doi cheesecake. I paid a little less than 1,200 for this. When the food package arrived, I realised that Rahul had added some complimentary dishes  tasting samples of kurkurey bhindi chaat, palak patta chaat, chicken bharta and sweets. We had the chaats and lukhmi for dinner, the bharta  a concoction of shredded chicken cooked with masalas and eggs  with roti for breakfast the next morning, and the Surti khawsa for lunch.Every dish was lip smackingly good. We had asked for aloo Pindi channa filling and gondhoraj lime flavoured water for the gol gappa. The lemony water had a nice tangy taste and the gol gappas were large and crisp. Bhawan has on offer atta, suji, and ragi golgappas, with various kinds of flavoured water and filling.I then had the aloo dum dahi vada, an Odia special that I am greatly fond of, and thoroughly enjoyed the dish of rich and spicy aloo dum eaten with soft, yoghurt-doused dahi vadas. I had never eaten karela chaat before, and I thought the fried bitter gourd  and the thin and crispy okra  made for a delightful chaat, doused with the sweet-and-spicy yoghurt mix. The palak chaat, however, was a bit too thick and hard. It could have done with a thinner batter.Karela chaat and bhelpuri | Photo Credit: Special arrangementNow let me tell you about the Surti khawsa. This is a popular street food dish of Surat, and I can understand why: Its wholesome and filling. The dish consists of a fragrant coconut milk-based broth and rice noodles. We added some papad pieces to it and then topped it with garlic chutney. The flavours and textures  the sweetness of the coconut milk and the fierceness of the chutney, the crunchiness of the papad and the softness of the noodles  complemented one another.Rahul tells me that they had thought of opening a restaurant but dropped their plans because of the coronavirus lockdown. The delivery business is being run from Chhatarpur, and they supply everywhere in Delhi-NCR, except in Faridabad (Bhawandelhi.com; 8178539537 for orders).The menu includes samosas and kachoris with moong dal, onions or -- hold your breath -- bacon and cheddar. It has baked khichri, kathal biryani, bedmi puri and saag meat. There are all kinds of sweets  mawa jalebis with rabri, aamchoor laddoos, coconut passion fruit barfi and so on.My bhapa doi cheesecake, a creamy dish of sweetened and steamed hung curd, was really nice, but nothing really beats my late mother-in-laws bhapa doi, steamed on a platter over a pot of boiling water. I think the dish I loved the most was the lukhmi  it had a delightfully crispy casing and a nicely spicy chicken keema filling.Bhawan is good news for those of us whove been missing the delights of roadside food but havent stepped out. We may have been banished from the streets, but I am happy that the streets are coming to us.The writer is a seasoned food critic",GREEN GRAM DAL (MOONG DAL)

The district has received 123 mm of rain in the past one week, as against the normal of 41 mm. It recorded rainfall of 6.06 mm on Sunday.Many smaller bridges built across Kagina river and its tributaries that had remained submerged for four days, cutting off connectivity between villages and towns, especially between Kalaburagi and Hyderabad, were reopened to traffic on Saturday. The rains on Sunday have, however, brought back the danger of the bridges again going underwater. The villages along the banks of Lower Mullamari in Chincholi taluk, including Tajlapur, Chimanchod, Salagar, Basantpur, and Nagaral, were flooded.Uttaradi Mutt, on the banks of river Kagina in Sedam taluk, continued to remain flooded. Large tracts of fields with standing crops such as green gram, black gram, and red gram, have been destroyed in waterlogging and because of extreme moisture. The black gram and green gram crops that were ready for harvesting have begun germinating in the fields.Rainfall at the Bhima catchment areas and the resultant increased inflow at Ujjani dam in Maharashtra forced the authorities to release more water into the river. As a result, the inflow into the Sonna barrage built across the Bhima in Afzalpur taluk rose, compelling the administration to increase the rate of discharge from 40,000 cusecs to 1.02 cusecs on Sunday through 29 gates. The district administration cautioned the people downstream not to approach the river.SubmergedHeavy rains and water release from Maharashtra led to a few bridges submerging in Vijayapura district as well.

Appealing to farmers not to misinterpret the bills, the administration claimed the departments of food and civil supplies and agriculture, and the state agencies in charge of procurement were making arrangements to purchase four major kharif crops  paddy, millet, moong and maize  at the MSP fixed by the Haryana State Agricultural Marketing Board .The state government is committed to uphold the interest of farmers. The government will continue to procure crops at the minimum support price in mandis. Due to the Covid-19 situation, a special arrangement is being made to ensure the procurement process is seamless. Necessary directions have been given to all departments concerned to implement all Covid-related norms at the mandis. From paddy to millets, all crops will be procured in these mandis at the MSP, said Dhirendra Khadgata, the Nuh deputy commissioner.Farmers, however, were relentless in their demand that the bill be withdrawn, asserting that the protests would be intensified from Friday. They said the administration had been making several such promises every year but doing little to improve the procurement process. They alleged that the passage of the bills in the House would lead to large-scale corruption and create a nexus of corporates and the bureaucracy.These promises are hollow, far from reality. We have to sell our produce at cheap rates to big traders, who, in turn, will sell it to the government in mandis at MSP. Government officials are hand-in-glove with private players. We will not settle for anything less than a law that guarantees MSP for us and makes purchase of any crop below the price a criminal offence, argued Rafiq Azad of Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU).The farmers also highlighted the bitter experience of crop procurement in April and May and the alleged failure of the government to ensure MSP for their produce. The peasants have complained of cases where the weight of their produce has varied at the local store and mandis.The system is flawed. First, BJP had promised to implement the Swaminathan Committees recommended formula for MSP, but did not do it. The current MSP formula is misguided, said Azad. The farmers said if their demand for a specific law on MSP was not met, they would intensify their protests. From September 25, well join farmers across the country in their protests.

Read MoreCHENNAI: The Tamil Nadu government is planning to provide legal sanctity to minimum support price (MSP) in the farming sector and would make MSP mandatory for contract farming too, which the Centre seeks to encourage.The proposed state legislation would blunt the opposition-sponsored onslaught against the AIADMK, which had supported the new farm bills in both the Houses of the Parliament, political executives have been told. When marketing firms sign contracts with farmers to encourage them to do cultivation for the firms, minimum support price of the produce will have to be specified.A provision to this effect will be made under Section 23 (1) of the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, that provides powers to states to frame rules. The state will also form an authority for effective implementation of the rules. The Tamil Nadu government feels MSP is very important and it should definitely continue as it safeguards farmers interest. The governments intention is that farmers should get more than the MSP. Contract farming is purely voluntary, agriculture secretary Gagandeep Singh Bedi said.While MSP has not been fixed for perishable commodities, it is applicable for many produce like paddy, wheat and sugarcane. The procurement mechanism following MSP is fixed by the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) and is being followed by agencies like Food Corporation of India, NAFED and state civil supplies corporation. It does not bind private players in the field since the existing Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee Act does not talk about it. The state feels the new law will give a boost to food processing sector, more so because 18 food parks have been announced by the state government in the last two years.Bedi said Tamil Nadu was the first state in the country to enact contract farming law in February last year as per a model bill of Niti Aayog, which was given assent by the President in October last year. The Central Act was in line with that, he said. Unlike the northern states, where farmers are forced to sell on the market premises, Tamil Nadu farmers have three options --selling in a regulated market, in the village or farm gate, and in the direct procurement centres of civil supplies corporation. They are free to sell at prices higher than the MSP, if anyone is ready to pay. Farmers in Tamil Nadu have already tasted success through this open system, he said.For instance, the MSP fixed last year for pulses was 57/kg for black gram, 70.50/ kg for green gram and 58/kg for red gram. While NAFED procured only 240MT of pulses in the regulated markets, farmers preferred to sell in villages and farm gates and the transaction hovered around 2.41 lakh MT. The department estimate is that the farmers would have gained 113 crore more by selling to private players. Similarly, the MSP of milling copra was 99.50/kg in the market, while the traders and oil mills offered 105 and 106 respectively. We are happy that farmers are getting higher price than MSP. The Central act says instead of selling only in the regulated area, they can sell in trade areas too. This is already in vogue in Tamil Nadu and farmers benefit out of it, the official said.There are 282 regulated markets in the state. He said the concept of Uzhavar Sandhais (farmers markets) would be protected.",GREEN GRAM DAL (MOONG DAL)

That, however, may now start coming in only by December. (File)Five years ago, retail prices of arhar/tur (pigeon pea) dal scaled to levels of Rs 180-200 per kg towards October, and was seen to have contributed significantly to the BJPs defeat in Bihar Assembly polls.This time round, the Narendra Modi government is taking no chances, especially with heavy rain in north Karnataka.The crop in this major tur beltcovering Bidar, Gulbarga, Yadgir, Bijapur and Raichur districtsnormally arrives after mid-November. That, however, may now start coming in only by December.North Karnataka has had excess rain in August and this month. At least 10 per cent of the crop there has suffered damage. Even the crop that hasnt so far will see delayed harvesting, said Nitin Kalantri, a leading dal miller based in Latur, Maharashtra.Wholesale tur prices in Latur have risen from around Rs 5,800 to Rs 6,700 per quintal in the last one month, well above the governments minimum support price (MSP) of Rs 6,000 per quintal. Milled tur/arhar dal is currently retailing at Rs 95-105 per kg in various parts of the country.Read| Dry July, excess rain in August-end spell trouble for kharif cropsThe firming up of prices is being attributed to the likely damage or late arrival of the Karnataka crop, as well as the government not issuing permits to mills for import of raw tur. This, despite the Directorate General of Foreign Trades move on April 21, notifying 4 lakh tonnes (lt) to be imported in 2020-21.Kalantri said, The permits should have been given earlier so that imports do take place just when the domestic crop is being harvested. But now, with no imports, and even the new crop going to arrive only after December, there could be pressure on supply. That is pushing up prices.Given the situation, a high-level meeting convened by the Cabinet Secretary last week is said to have reviewed the overall pulses availability situation.On September 14, the government imposed a blanket ban on export of onion after retail prices of the bulb crossed Rs 40 per kg (along with potatoes and tomatoes also at over Rs 35 and Rs 55/kg, respectively).A repeat of October-November 2015 is the last thing the government wants, when the next polls in Bihar are due around then. They will not allow arhar to become an election issue again, a source pointed out.Explained A tough balancing act for the Centre Prices of arhar and urad are ruling above MSP. The outlook for POT  potato, onion, tomato  is also bullish. That should be useful for the Modi government when it is facing farmer backlash over its recent APMC reform Bill. But the flip side of rising food prices is its possible impact on the upcoming Bihar Assembly polls. That makes for a tough balancing act.But Sanjeev Kumar Chadha, managing director of the National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India (Nafed), sought to dispel any concerns over shortage of pulses.He told The Indian Express: We (Nafed) have 8.5 lt of arhar/tur, apart from 15-16 lt of chana (chickpea), 3 lt of urad (black gram) and 2 lt of moong (green gram). Some traders are trying to create artificial scarcity to force the government to allow more imports.Farmers have sown pulses on 138.62 lakh hectares (lh) area during this kharif season, which is 6.28 lh higher than last year.Although too much rain from the second half of August has caused damage to the standing urad crop in Madhya Pradesh and tur in north Karnataka, the Agriculture Ministry expects total kharif pulses production at 93.1 lt, up from 77.2 lt in 2019 and 80.9 lt in 2018. The condition of tur in the main Marathwada and Vidarbha regions of Maharashtraarrivals there start from Januaryis said to be very good as of now.The government is obviously worried about Bihar, but will also not want prices to fall below MSPs  that would discourage farmers from planting rabi season pulses (chana and masoor). Prices are ruling above MSP after a long time and that can even help counter the unrest over the recently passed APMC reform Bill, the aforementioned source said.

Here is one you can tryPacked with nutrition, microgreens are fast gaining popularity. And a growing tribe of health conscious individuals are trying their hand at growing these superfoods in kitchen gardens during the pandemic.While being a plant parent can be challenging, microgreens need little space to grow. They are small plants in the next stage of sprouting, when the first leaves develop from the seed. If you have a windowsill or balcony that gets a few hours of sunshine every day, you are good to go, says Visakhapatnam-based S Ravi Kanth Reddy, founder of the NGO Mother Earth Environmental Consciousness Society (MEECONS), and who is an advocate of sustainable living.Wheatgrass | Photo Credit: Special arrangementRecently, Ravi Kanth and his wife Naga Vijaya, released a video on Vijayas Healthy Home on YouTube. The video showed how to grow microgreens through hydroponics, showing the time-lapse of the growth of such greens. These superfoods contain abundant Vitamin C, E and anti-oxidants, and are far more nutritious than the adult leafy versions. These are ideal to throw onto a salad or sandwich. You can also garnish a dish with a dash of microgreens, says Ravi Kanth.What to keep in mind When using cocopeat and soil, microgreens should be grown in flat surfaces, like a tray or cardboard box with drainage holes, that can hold up to two inches of soil.Spray water daily to keep it moist especially during the first two-three days of the germination stage.Microgreens taste best when fresh but can be refrigerated for a couple of days.The tender greens can be used as a nutritious side dish, added to smoothies or as colourful topping to salads.Use seeds that are untreated with any chemical.Good quality soil and cocopeat, which are chemical free, ensure that microgreens grow well.Be careful not to overwater them.Besides being healthy, they are also simple to grow. They dont need a lot of light and can be grown in four to six days. So, there is no fretting about fertilising, repoting, or pruning, he explains. And more importantly, these greens are completely organic as you would be growing them without pesticides or fertilisers. Seeds like those of fenugreek, wheat, green gram and mustard take just two to three days to germinate. Preparing the seed is the first step in growing microgreens. For the initial 24 hours, the seeds need to be placed in a darker place before shifting them to a bright spot, says Ravi Kanth.Process of choiceHe used the hydroponic method which he says can be an alternative to cocopeat and soil, as these may not be easily accessible everywhere during the pandemic. I used a stainless steel sieve, which is usually available at every household, to grow microgreens hydroponically. Wash the seeds well; spread them on the sieve and place it above a container with water; spray water twice a day and cover with a lid. Follow the process for two to three days till you see tiny leaves coming out, he says, adding, After this, shift the sieve along with container to a brighter spot. But do not cover it. In six days time, you are good to go and harvest it.",GREEN GRAM DAL (MOONG DAL)

But with copious rains and restoration of supply chain, after the country started unlocking from the crippling lockdown, the farm sector is showing signs of recovery, even as there are apprehensions over amendments to the Land Reforms Amendment and APMC Acts, perceived as anti-farmer.Agriculturists also fear the withdrawal of free power supply to irrigation pumpsets and the minimum support price. The governments efforts to allay their fears have not yielded results and they have taken to protest, and are planning a Karnataka Bandh on Monday. But sowing operations have continued unhindered. If this years kharif season is any indicator, the sector is going to see an unprecedented boom in crop yields, as the area under cultivation has been the highest the state has ever seen.Good pre-monsoon showers and Unlock 1.0 turned out to be a boost for farmers, who completed sowing operations in 18.99 lakh hectares (26%of the total area), and Unlock 2.0 helped cover 47.01 lakh hectares, or 64% of the area, by July 24. As the monsoon advanced with vigour, sowing operations were completed in the entire 73 lakh hectares. What gave the boost was the return of people from urban areas to villages as the employable population either lost jobs or could not find enough work. Experts suggest that this factor alone could have contributed 5-7% to the increase in cultivation area.Farmers have sown cereals in 31.34 lakh hectares, pulses in 18.81 lakh hectares, oil seeds in 11 lakh hectares, commercial crops like cotton in 6.25 lakh hectares and sugarcane in 4.77 lakh hectares. The cereals include maize (87%) and jowar (58%) which are widely grown in North Karnataka, parts of Malnad and southern districts. Tur (82%), urad dal (104%) and green gram (74%) are grown widely in Kalyana Karnataka, Belagavi and parts of the southern districts. Haveri has seen 99% sowing, Bidar 96%, Dharwad 92%, Dakshina Kannada 89% and both Kalaburagi and Belgavi 90%.As the monsoon took off late, the Bengaluru region had recorded just 11% sowing by July 24. However, the district achieved the target after it received above-normal rainfall in August. The increase in sowing by 20% across the state as of July-end has upped hopes of the government on the revival of the economy, as the farming sector contributes a substantial 15 per cent to the states GDP.Eighty per cent of the cultivation is done in the dry regions that comprises 70% of the farming area. A whopping 90% of the states rural population depends on this dry belt for livelihood. Kolar, Chikkaballapur and Tumakuru, where fields are normally dry, have turned lush green with above normal rainfall, said Thimmaiah, a farmer from Narasapura.Harvesting of kharif crops begins in November, and farmers hope that they will get a better price for their produce with the transport sector fully resuming operations. Farmers who harvested green gram in August could not get good prices as traders from Tamil Nadu and Maharastra were missing.When the lockdown was announced on March 24, farmers were hit badly as they could not move their yield to cities, their primary markets. The reduction in the number of interstate trucks also affected the supply chain.Mysuru APMC president Basavaraju said that only 20% of the produce reached APMC during the lockdown. Fear among farmers, traders and also buyers over the spread of coronavirus made them stay back home. Mahesha, a farmer from Kottimatti in Chamrajanagar, said, I had to crush cabbage grown in two acres and could not harvest banana during the lockdown.The worst-hit probably were pulse growers as they did not get a good price for green gram, black gram, soya and mustard, which are normally sent to other states. But some waited for the market to recover to see profits. I decided not to sell onion at Rs 8 a kg. I harvested and then stored onion for two months and sold it at Rs 60 a kg, said Narase Gowda of Nagamangala. During the lockdown, farmers had to spend 30-40% more on farm labour, said Kurbur Shanthakumar, president, Sugar Cane Growers Association.Grape and pomegranate growers, who were already hit by the worst-ever floods the previous year, had to sell their produce at half the price. Vijayapura district exports dry grapes worth Rs 500 crore and turnover from all agriculture produce from the district is Rs 2,500 crore per year.Karnataka State Grape Growers Association president Abhaykumar Nandrekar said that the prognosis is not good for grape growers even next year as a study conducted by the Horticulture University revealed that the yield will be less than 55% because of floods. Grape growers have also been hit by lack of demand from the United Kingdom, Europe and Gulf Countries, while only bulk orders are coming in from temple-towns of Tirupathi and Sringeri.But Ambareesh of Kolar says many farmers have managed to recover over the last one month. Ramesh, a pomegranate farmer from Hosadurga, said that prices have stabilised around Rs 70-80 a kg and there have been some orders coming in from international markets. The State Government too has pitched in to help farmers by announcing a loan mela to disburse Rs 1,3000 crore to farmers and others. Cooperation Minister S T Somashekar said that the government will extend loans through cooperative banks, and new members too will be eligible for the scheme.",GREEN GRAM DAL (MOONG DAL)

The planning authorities have estimated the production of cotton at 99.53 lakh bales of 170 kg each against the production of nearly 60 lakh bales last year. It is expected to cross one crore bales given the fact that the fibre crop has been cultivated in 60.22 lakh acres extent against 59.58 lakh acres taken into consideration by the officials while estimating the production.Production of paddy, which is estimated at 125.46 lakh tonnes from 50.19 lakh acres is expected to cross that threshold too as the actual extent has been over 52.56 lakh acres against the extent taken into consideration by the planning authorities, a senior official of the Agriculture Department said that total production of food crops could very well cross one-crore tonnes.Similarly, the production of red gram is estimated at about 8.44 lakh tonnes from the cultivation of the crop in 10.55 lakh acres. Last year, the production was only about 1.9 lakh tonnes from over 7.38 lakh acres of cultivation. This season, the crop is cultivated in nearly 10.77 lakh acres against 10.55 lakh acres taken into count by the BES officials while preparing the advance estimates of production.Another major food crop soya bean is expected to give a production of 3.42 lakh tonnes from 3.95 lakh acres of cultivation. The final extent of the crop, however, is nearly 4 lakh acres this season. Its production was 2.74 lakh tonnes from nearly 4.27 lakh acres of cultivation during the last Kharif season.The BES officials have also estimated the production of jowar at 53,000 tonnes, black gram 21,000 tonnes, green gram 22,000 tonnes, maize 4.7 lakh tonnes, groundnut 41,000 tonnes, sugarcane 15.78 lakh tonnes, turmeric 2.54 lakh tonnes, chilli 4.1 lakh tonnes and onion 38,000 tonnes.",GREEN GRAM DAL (MOONG DAL)

Also, unwanted and unsolicited rude comments about my weight really affected me. However, it was only for the sake of my health that I decided to lose weight and get back in shape. I did not look back since the day I decided to lose weight!I used to have a high-fiber and high protein breakfast like oats, moong dal chilla, poha or besan chilla. I also had a cup of tea but without sugar with my breakfast.A small bowl of curry, 1 chapatti and 1 small bowl of rice.: I used to choose between salads, soups, quinoa khichdi, buckwheat pula, dal and boiled moong and chana.A glass of lukewarm water with two teaspoons of apple cider vinegar.I had my breakfast as I worked out in the morning.Definitely pizza and handmade chicken biryani! In desserts, I prefer cakes.My workout routine consisted of the following exercises:1. Walking2.Squats3.Mountain climbers4.Zoomba classes5.Yoga6.Jumping jacksQuinoa khichdiI have learnt that keeping a tab on how much you are eating (the portion of the food) is very important. I always take care of the same. Also, I believe that sipping on green tea has helped in improving my metabolism.Undoubtedly, my husband was my greatest motivator and mentor during my weight loss journey. He was the one who pushed me to lose weight and get back in shape. He told me that I did not have to do it for looks but for good health in the longer term. Also, when I started seeing visible results of my hard work, it further motivated me to lose more weight.I used the weighing machine as my source of motivation and focus during my weight loss journey.It was definitely the body-shaming I faced. People had started commenting rudely like, ""Oh, you have put on so much of weight!"" or asking questions like, ""Are you planning for a second child?"" after looking at my tummy. It was very disturbing for me.I want to lose more weight in the coming years and become thinner.I made a lot of lifestyle changes. Some of these changes included:While nothing quite bothered me in a negative way about my weight or how I looked, I really did not wish to be counted in the obese category. Hence, I decided to start my weight loss journey.I have learnt a lot of patience during my weight loss journey as weight loss cannot happen overnight. You have to work really hard for it and it takes some time to see visible results.

Despite this, the crop coverage during kharif season fell short by 12% in the rain-fed district for various reasons.The Agriculture Department is leaving no stone unturned to make up for the shortfall during winter, as both kharif and rabi cropping seasons overlap in the district, which had been in the grip of drought for several years in the past, including a 15% deficit rainfall during last year. The district recorded a rainfall of 548.3 mm as against the normal rainfall of 456.6 mm.Bengal gram, the pulse crop grown as an alternative to tobacco, is likely to see a surge in acreage during Rabi this year in the wake of the Tobacco Board's decision to cut down on tobacco cultivation in the traditional tobacco growing areas in the district in view of the depressed global market condition for the principal commercial crop.Overseeing registration of the names of ryots at the Rythu Bharosa centres for distribution of subsidised seeds, Agriculture Joint Director P.V. Sriramamurthy said farmers should switch over to alternatives like jowar, black gram, etc., as they might burn their fingers if they grew bengal gram in more than the normal acreage of about 80,000 hectares during winter.With 23,336 hectares under paddy, the coverage was 98% during kharif thanks to the good inflow into Krishna Western Delta and Nagarjunasagar Right Bank branch canals this year. However, the area under red gram, the principal pulse crop grown during kharif, fell to about 80,000 hectares, a dip of 13% over the normal extent.The overall pulse crop coverage, including black gram, green gram and horse gram, was 88% of the normal acreage 1,00,000 hectarea, according to a report compiled by the Agriculture Department.

Theres been a Rs30 increase in tur dal price in the last 15 days, with the staple crossing the Rs100 per kg mark in retail markets (see box). Retail price of mung dal has also crossed the Rs100 per kg mark, from Rs96 a few days ago to Rs106.Dhaval Shah, director of Jairaj Group in the Gultekdi wholesale market, told TOI, The festive season is likely to create a further spike in pulse prices. Heavy rainfall in parts of Maharashtra, such as Latur, Jalgaon and Akola, as well as several places in Karnataka are one reason for the shortage in pulses and the consequent price rise. Also, there is a huge demand for protein-rich foods like pulses because of the Covid-19 pandemic.He said, The demand for pulses has increased by about 30-40% in the past few months. The rise in tur dal prices has been especially steep. The price increase is generally about Rs10-15 per kg. This time around, it has increased by Rs30 in the wholesale as well as retail markets. Prices of other pulses have gone up too in the face of an increased demand for pulses and a shortage of about 20-25% as per rough estimates.Shortage in chana dal is being experienced since more than a month now.The variety of the pulse has seen massive consumption during the past few months, especially from households as well as due to food donation kits distributed during the Covid-19 pandemic.Ambemohar rice prices are also high with the wholesale rate rising to Rs85-95 per kg, as against the earlier Rs45-55/kg.Hanuman Unecha, a retailer in Gokhalenagar, said, Prices of gram flour have gone up in the face of chana dal rate rise. A kg of gram flour now costs Rs90 in the retail market, as against Rs80 a fortnight ago. With the festivals coming up, we do not expect a fall in pulse prices.

The farmer from Bombli Khurd in Latur districts Deoni taluka feels it will be prudent to sell only after the average traded price of the oilseed breaches the Rs 4,000 per-quintal mark.Given the way the season is starting, I dont think I will have to wait for long. Traders say the average traded price in Laturs mandi will cross Rs 4,000 per quintal towards the end of Diwali I will offload my stock then, said Bhosale, who grows other pulses such as urad and moong over the remaining 10 acres of his holding.Even before farmers start bringing their produce to wholesale markets, soyabean prices have seen a steady bull run. At Laturs wholesale mandi, the average traded price of the oilseed is Rs 3,870, as against the government-declared minimum support price (MSP) of Rs 3,880.Traders in the market not only rule out softening of prices, some say prices can cross the Rs 4,000 per quintal mark as soon as November.It all depends on arrivals. Given the upward trend, farmers have decided to hold on to their stock in hope of higher prices the supply-demand mismatch will push up prices further in the near future, said a trader at Laturs wholesale market.While for farmers like Bhosale, the current phase of high prices prompts them to hold on to their stock of oil extractors and processors, some say this indicates unhealthy speculation in the markets.On Monday, the Soyabean Processors Association of India (SOPA)  the umbrella body of soyabean processors in India  had written to the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), asking for a ban on future contracts of the oilseed on the National Commodities and Derivatives Exchange of India (NCDEX) platform. The unhealthy speculation, SOPA claimed, had harmed actual trade.Internationally, soyabean prices have seen a rally after two years. Soyabean prices at Chicagos Exchange (CBOT) have crossed the barrier of $10/bushel mid-September. This is the first time near-term future prices have crossed the $10/bushel mark since July 2018. Increased buying by China and forecasts of a weak South American crop has fueled this bull run in the oilseeds markets internationally.China is the worlds largest importer of soyabean in the world, with its annual import well over 950 lakh tonnes (lt), majority of which is sourced from South America and the United States of America.Domestically, prices of soya meal- the protein-rich solid left after oil is extracted from the beans  is at an all-time high of Rs 31,000 per tonne, signaling increased demand from poultry and other feed makers.Ashok Bhutada, proprietor of Latur-headquartered Kirti Group, which runs multiple extraction and solvent plants in Maharashtra, said an increased uptake of soyameal from the animal feed industry is responsible for the present price rise, both in meal and the oilseed.At the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, consumption of chicken and eggs had dropped, thanks to rumours which had linked the disease with consumption of poultry meat. But now the situation has changed, with people increasing their protein consumption to fight the disease, he said.Bhutadas own group supplies feed to the fishery units and he said they have seen a four-fold rise since the last few months.Most traders felt the present price trend will continue for some time, with farmers ready to hold on to their produce in hope of better prices.

The quantity procured so far is 33% higher than the corresponding period last year, according to data cited by the farm ministry.While the procurement of the kharif (monsoon crop) staple is continuing robustly, farmers in Punjab and Haryana continue to protest against a set of laws enacted by Parliament to deregulate agricultural markets, which they fear will weaken the MSP system, whereby farm produce is bought by the government at assured prices.The Centre would also procure pulses, oilseeds and copra at MSP beyond the quantity approved so far from any state where the market rate falls below MSP under its price support scheme, the agriculture ministry said in a statement on Monday.Despite this, several summer-sown crops, such as soybean and maize, are selling below minimum prices set by the government because the government procures too little of non-cereals.The government continues to procure kharif 2020-21 crops at its MSP from farmers as per its existing MSP schemes and procurement is going on smoothly, the farm ministry statement said, pointing to the higher procurement trend.Until October 11, the government through its food agencies has additionally procured 606.56 tonnes of two pulses  moong and urad  with an MSP value of 4.36 croreThe government has also approved requests from 10 states to procure 3.7 million tonnes of pulses and oilseeds. These states are Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Telangana, Gujarat, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Odisha, Rajasthan and Andhra Pradesh.The government has also sanctioned procurement of 100,000 tonnes of copra, a perennial crop, from Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Kerala.Crops such as soybean, ragi, maize and cotton, are selling up to 30% below MSPs, data from Agmarknet, the agriculture ministrys portal that tracks prices in mandis or wholesale markets, shows.Poor returns from crops have been a lingering problem for farmers, especially during episodes of gluts, such as now. MSPs, which are fixed at 50% over cost for nearly two dozen crops, dont necessarily lead to higher farm incomes as the governments procurement at MSP rates is largely restricted to wheat and rice. For most other crops, farmers are mostly price takers, meaning they are forced to accept whatever the markets dictate.Nudging the private sector towards triggering a market-clearing price that is closer or equal to MSP will depend on the extent of governments procurement, economist Abhijit Sen said.For commodities such as pulses and oilseeds, the governments procurement is insufficient to improve market rates. For instance, the nearly 3.7 million tonnes of pulses and oilseeds they government has approved for procurement at MSP is less than 15% of the total production -- too small a quantity to make a difference in prices offered by private entities.",GREEN GRAM DAL (MOONG DAL)

The 45-year-old commerce graduate needs Chourasiya, who has brought three other men also from Uttar Pradeshs Kaushambi district, to operate his two Crop Tiger 40 Multicrop combines.They have returned after the lockdown and will harvest the kharif (monsoon) maize in Davanagere this month, followed by Haveri and Shimoga districts in November and December. The same machines will also harvest chana (chickpea) and sunflower in Davanagere and Chitradurga during January-February. Then, we have the rabi (winter-spring) maize crop of Vijayawada (Andhra Pradesh) in March and Shikaripura (Shimoga) in April. Each combine would work for 1,200-1,300 hours during these seven months, says Babu.For entrepreneurs like Babu, and farmers, the multi-crop combines exemplify the next level of mechanisation. They harvest not just paddy and wheat, but also other crops where the use of machines is far less ubiquitous: chana, moong (green gram), tur (pigeon pea), maize, ragi, sunflower, soyabean and mustard.Combine harvesting of paddy is something Babu has been doing since he bought his first machine in 2000. He now has 15 Crop Tiger 30 Terra Trac combines that harvest only paddy. These have a well-laid-out route: They first go to Goa, Udupi and Mangaluru in October; cover Davanagere and Raichur from November till about December 25; and come down to Mysuru and Chamarajanagar and work till January 10-11 before taking a 20-day break towards Pongal festival. The next stop is Tirunelveli and Thanjavur (Tamil Nadu) in February and Nellore (AP) in March. From April to mid-May, the itinerant machines either operate in APs West and East Godavari districts or Karnatakas Raichur-Yadgir-Gulbarga belt, before returning to Davanagere. By then, they would have worked around 1,500 hours.Babus paddy crawler combines  they move on rubber tracks in the fields, while being transported by road on Ashok Leyland Ecomet 1012 light commercial vehicles  can cover an acre in roughly one hour and 10 minutes. Farmers are charged an average hourly rate of Rs 2,000.Paddy is an established business where I have 55 operators. They are all local people. My total running expenses (which excludes interest and depreciation) comes to Rs 1,400-1,500 per hour. Within that, the cost of diesel (10 litres consumption per hour) is nearly Rs 800 and labour Rs 350. Transporting the machines and operators food allowance accounts for the rest, explains Babu.For the two multi-crop combines  which he bought only two years ago for Rs 27.58 lakh each  Babu is employing operators from UP. Two people are required per machine. I pay them Rs 35,000 per month per machine. This is less than the Rs 45,000 per machine plus a Rs 50/hour incentive for the Terra Trac operators, who are locals. I charge more for maize (Rs 2,500/hour), as it is a new business that will take time to get established, he says.Mahendrappa Havalamanavar is a smaller entrepreneur, who also started with a Terra Trac paddy combine, albeit a second-hand one, that he purchased in 2017. But the 62-year-old, who farms five acres at Holalu village in Bellary districts Huvina Hadagali taluka, soon disposed of the machine as he couldnt afford to take it to distant places for harvesting jobs. In August 2018, he invested in a Crop Tiger 40 Multicrop combine and followed it up with a second one a year later.Havalamanavar, unlike Babu, works only in Karnataka  mostly in Bellary and the adjoining Haveri and Gadag districts. He first harvests moong in August that takes up 200-odd hours and then maize during September-December (800 hours). In January, he does chana (200 hours) and ragi in February-March (150 hours). Only during April-May does he take the machines more than 150 km away to Shimoga for 200 hours of rabi maize harvestingThe multi-crop combines are self-propelled, having their own wheels for moving on roads. They dont need to be lugged on separate vehicles as with the Terra Trac crawlers that entail additional costs. Moreover, Havalamanavar is able to command higher harvesting rates  from Rs 2,200/hour for chana to Rs 2,600-2,700 for maize and Rs 3,000-3,500 for ragi.Mrityunjaya Singh, managing director of CLAAS Agricultural Machinery Private Ltd  the Indian subsidiary of the 3.9 billion German company that makes Crop Tiger combines  attributes the spread of mechanical harvesting to even coarse grains and pulses to three factors.The first is a general shortage of farm hands, which is a secular trend. Agricultural labour availability is falling year to year. The reverse migration of workers we saw (due to the Covid-19-induced lockdown) is a temporary phenomenon, he tells The Indian Express.The second is efficiency. For farmers, managing labour is a cumbersome affair. Harvesting an acre of ragi requires some 10 people working a whole day. The harvested crop further has to be tied into bundles and taken for threshing (separating the grain from the straw), which needs extra labour. The combine, on the other hand, will harvest, thresh, clean and deliver the grain to the farmers tractor trolley  all in just over one hour. At Rs 3,000-3,500/hour, even the cost difference vis--vis manual labour, given daily wage rates of Rs 200-250, may not be much. That apart, the farmer can now concentrate fully on growing and marketing his produce.The third factor is technology. Singh concedes that yield losses from manual harvesting are lower (hardly 1%) than from normal combines (up to 10%). But the quality of machines also has undergone significant improvement over the years. The Crop Tiger 40 Multicrop combine has two different cutter-bars or headers  one for all grains and the other specially designed for maize. In regular crops, the entire plant with the stem gets cut and goes inside the machine. The maize header ensures that only the cobs enter the machine, which then separates the grain. The kernels are collected in a grain tank and the empty cobs thrown back to the field.We have a proprietary tangential axial flow threshing technology that enables delivery of clean unbroken grain. The crop losses will, as a result, not exceed 1.5-2%, says Singh.Besides CLAAS, the US farm equipment giant John Deere and the Nabha (Punjab)-based Preet Agro Industries are selling multi-crop and maize combine harvesters in India.

Read MoreMUMBAI: A fortnight ago, Siddhesh Jamdade was busy harvesting his bountiful soyabean crop. Now, his field has turned into a muddy marshland. The cloudbursts over the last week caused the river nearby to swell onto his field. ""My onion and soyabean crop was destroyed and the flooding left a thick layer of mud on the field, almost like a river bank,"" said the 30-year-old farmer from Tuljapur in Marathwada's Osmanabad district whose losses amount to nearly Rs 10 lakh.The flooding caused by the retreating monsoon destroyed almost 7 lakh hectares of harvest-ready cro-ps, mainly in the drought-prone Marathwada and the sugar belt of Western Maharashtra, according to preliminary estimates. The neighbouring districts of Solapur in Western Maharashtra and Osmanabad in Marathwada are the worst affected.Standing crops of soyabean, cotton, maize, jowar and moong have been wrecked. ""It is only after panchnamas are conducted that we will have a more authentic estimate of crop destruction,"" said secretary (relief and rehabilitation) Kishore Raje Nimbalkar.Farmers did not get good prices for their produce during the height of the lockdown and were hoping the plentiful monsoon would lead to a bumper kharif harvest.""During the lockdown, I grew vegetables for our own consumption. We were banking on the kharif crop ,"" said Rajendra Giri (50) from Lohara taluka in Osmanabad. The floods washed away his harvested soyabean.Farmers are worried about whether they will receive crop insurance for the disaster. They say the compensation-ranging from Rs 6,800 to Rs 18,000 an acre by NDRF norms-is too meagre for such calamities. Chakrapani Jadhav from Beed's Patoda taluka could not get insurance for his chikoo plantation because the fruit was not eligible for crop insurance in his circle.The farmers' union, Kisan Sabha, has alleged that the retreating rains have damaged 30% of the state's harvested crop. ""The government should not delay conducting panchnamas of the damage. Besides compensation, the state should also help farmers in filing crop insurance claims,"" said Ajit Navale of the union.Already in June, farmers from the Konkan region had suffered because of cyclone Nisarg. Last year, the floods in Western Maharashtra had destroyed 4 lakh hectares of crop and unseasonal rains had impacted 93 lakh hectares of crop across the state during the kharif harvest.",GREEN GRAM DAL (MOONG DAL)

Cotton crop was damaged to an extent of 30,500 hectares with production loss of 0.54 lakh metric tonnes and monetary loss of Rs 297 crore.Maize crops to an extent of 25,000 hectares suffered damage and the production loss was 1.13 lakh hectares with a monetary loss of Rs 209 crore. Losses of other crops including red gram, black gram, green gram and minor millets put together to an extent of 42,000 hectares were damaged with a production loss of 0.32 lakh metric tonnes and monetary loss of Rs 80 crore.Groundnut farmers in Rayalaseema expected a bumper crop this Kharif, but they suffered huge losses due to the excess rains. Anantapur, Kurnool, Chittoor and Kadapa, which received more rains than other parts of the State, witnessed crop loss and drop in yield.This Kharif, groundnut was cultivated in seven lakh hectares, but due to continuous rains during the crop growth stage very, the yield was 50 per cent less. Agriculture department put the estimated production loss at 2.10 lakh metric tonnes and Rs 1,107 crore monetary loss. Officials said the loss of groundnut crop was more in Anantapur district than other districts.Farmers are being advised to follow the advisories given by the agriculture department extension wing once the water recedes to minimise losses.

However, the national averages for the four seeds were above the ideal rate of 33 pc.Pulling up the Odisha State Seeds Corporation (OSSC) for decline in the SRR, the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) in its performance audit report for the year ending March 2018 said the corporation carried out seeds production as per its annual action plan without considering the Seed Rolling Plan (SRP).The Ministry of Agriculture had approved a SRP for Odisha for the period 2013-17. The SRP was to be prepared considering the minimum SRR or rate already achieved whichever is higher.Though the Government directed all seeds producing agencies including OSSC to carry out production as per the SRP, the corporation issued its production programme as per the annual plan which was lower than what was envisaged in the SRP during 2013-14 and 2016-18 and failed to achieve its own target, the report said.Shortfall in production and distribution of certified seeds by OSSC has affected the SRR of the State. In case of paddy, though the SRR increased to 36.01 pc in 2015-16, it again decreased below the normative level during 2016-18. The State-run corporation produced 20.35 lakh quintal of seeds during 2013-18 against its own target of 35.80 lakh, the report added.",GREEN GRAM DAL (MOONG DAL)

The bills were along the same lines presented by the Punjab government. There were some changes, such as the one where state bills allow private entities to buy farm produce or enter contract farming, as the Central law envisaged, but the purchase from farmers has to be on minimum support prices (MSPs). There would be penal provisions on those paying less than MSPs.The farmers would have the right to discontinue the contract after its tenure is over, he said.On Tuesday, the Punjab assembly had passed farm bills and pledged to protect the interests of state farmers, who were concerned about the Central legislations, which they said might deprive them of the government-fixed MSPs for their produce and put them at the mercy of big businessmen.In Punjab, MSPs are provided for wheat and paddy, but in Rajasthan, seven cropswheat, gram, mustard, moong (lentil), urad (black gram), soyabean and groundnutare covered under MSPs.Also Read: Agri reforms: The disjunct between the right ends, wrong meansBharatiya Janata Party (BJP) state president Satish Poonia said the Congress was not just confused about the issue, but also about its leader and leadership, reiterating that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had assured farmers that MSPs, Mandi system etc. would continue. The Modi government was committed towards doubling the farmers income, he said.Poonia added the Congress did not want the condition of farmers to improve, that they were happy to oppose laws brought in by the Modi government in the interest of the farmers. By calling an assembly session against these welfare laws, the Rajasthan chief minister wants to show his commitment and loyalty towards Congress chief Sonia Gandhi, he said.Refuting the BJPs allegations, Congress spokesperson Archana Sharma said the party was committed towards farmers and the poor of the country. Through the farm reforms, the government of India had interfered in the states jurisdiction, which was not in the farmers interest. The state government would be bringing in laws to ensure that the farmers are protected and their produce is purchased on MSPs.Political analyst Narayan Bareth said agriculture was a state subject and the Central government should not have attempted to frame laws. This portrayed a trust deficit between state and centre, especially states ruled by non-BJP parties, which was a matter of concern.In July, the Rajasthan governor had returned three cabinet proposals on grounds that the assembly session be called on a 21-day notice.",GREEN GRAM DAL (MOONG DAL)

However, the monsoon this year was above normal, with the district getting 74.8% excess rainfall in the month of September alone, enabling farmers to grow crops in an extent of 5.38 lakh acres during Khariff.However, they were in for a rude shock as the rains in the second week of October and the subsequent floods left most of the crops damaged.Standing crops, including chilli, cotton, black gram, green gram and cow pea, in over 26,000 acres have been damaged, mostly in Markapur division.Counting the losses, All India Kisan Sangarsh Coordination Committee district convener Chundri Ranga Rao said farmers in western Prakasam had just started a few rounds of plucking in his cotton field. The rains came at the most inopportune time, making it impossible to complete plucking of the ready-to-harvest crop.Over 20,000 farmers in 19 mandals who had taken up cultivation of chilli, red gram, maize and sesame, are ruing their fate as the rains according to an assessment by the Andhra Pradesh Rythu Sangam (APRS) had caused a loss of 300 crore so far.Productivity in paddy fields is likely to drop to 20 quintals per acre as against the normal 30 quintals. Farmers now have to spend three times more for removal of excessive weeds and increased pest attack following the heavy rains.Expecting handsome returns in the wake of the spice crops price going northwards in global markets, chilli growers had spent at least 50,000 per acre so far. But the heavy rains had dashed all their hopes, explained APRS district secretary Vadde Hanuma Reddy.Heavy rains and flash floods also left a trail of destruction in the district, damaging 224.35 km of roads,including a maximum of 148.25 km of road surface in Ongole R&B division.

A farmer, Sunil Kumar of Bhiwanis Garwa village, said he had received a message asking him to bring his bajra crop to Behal mandi on November 17. However, once he got there, officials refused to purchase his produce citing lack of verification: The officials told me procurement will be done after verifying my status as a farmer. I have visited the mandi many times since but officials are yet to procure my crop, he said.Haryana Kisan Sabha secretary Dayanand Punia, a resident of Bhiwani, says thousands of farmers in the district and still more across the state are waiting for government agencies to procure their bajra, moong and groundnut. However, no crops have been purchased since Diwali.Farmers have to start sowing wheat but their produce is still lying in mandis. Do we wait for procurement to start or prepare our fields for sowing? Farmers should be given more time to sell their produce. The government should ensure that the purchase is not merely made on paper, Punia said.Farmers await payment: ChautalaEllenabad Indian National Lok Dal MLA Abhay Singh Chautala said, The governments real face has been exposed as it has failed to procure bajra, paddy, moong and groundnut from farmers. Thousands of farmers are still waiting for their turn to sell their crops. Bajra farmers have been waiting for payment for the last two weeks. The government has been creating hurdles for farmers. First, they barred entry of farmers from neighbouring states. Now, they are stopping farmers from Punjab from purchasing urea from Haryana.Bhiwani deputy commissioner Jaibir Singh Arya said he had formed teams to verify farmers whose bajra was yet to be procured: Officials concerned will submit the list by November 21, after which we will start bajra procurement.

But, what you may not know is the food consumed before and after working out is as important as the workout itself.READ: How effective are virtual workouts? Experts weigh inIt is said that the secret to good health and staying fit is exercise coupled with a healthy, balanced diet. And to stay energised while exercising, our body requires a certain amount of nutrition. A high amount of carbohydrate is required so that we have enough energy to sustain. Additionally, we need to consume a good amount of protein after working out so as to repair any wear and tear that may have occurred while working out, and also to build muscle strength, explains nutritionist Tripti Tandon.Echoing Tandons views is nutritionist and fitness expert Manisha Chopra, who says, What you eat before and after workout affects your performance, recovery and progress. These meals basically refill the energy in your body, encourage muscle growth and repair and prevent muscle mass breakdown. Food rich in nutrients is the key to lose weight as well as gain muscles. Your workout alone wont be able to give you good results.The meals you consume pre-workout and post-workout hold equal importance as the workout does. It affects your performance, recovery and progress. Food rich in nutrients is the key to lose weight as well as gain muscles. Without nutrition, your workout alone wont be able to give you good results.So what are some of the options one has? You could go in for some peanut butter and sliced bananas on a slice of toast, a mix of nuts, or a bowl of Greek yogurt with some fruits and almonds in it, says Tandon, to which Chopra adds, Pre-workout meals should be consumed one or two hours before the workout.Another pre-workout meal option is oatmeal. Quick and easy to make, oatmeal contains slow release carbs and provides energy through the workout. Just mix oats with warm water and spices, or warm milk and some fruit. Let it stand for a few minutes and your meal is ready! suggests dietitian Shikha Mahajan.Quinoa dosa For the batter, take a cup of quinoa,  cup each of urad dal, arhar dal, moong dal, 1tsp methi seeds and salt (as per taste).Soak the pulses for around six hours, and quinoa for about an hour. Grind the ingredients well and leave the batter aside for around 20-30 minutes so that it ferments well.To prepare the dosa, take about a ladle full of the batter and spread on a pre-heated tawa. Let it cook on both sides. Serve hot with some chutney or sambar loaded with vegetables as a pre-workout mealAfter workout, Mahajan recommends having some cottage cheese with cantaloupe. Cottage cheese is a high-protein snack, and its creaminess combined with the sweetness of the cantaloupe provides a dessert-like quality to your meal. While the protein in the cottage cheese helps heal your muscles, the carbohydrates will help replenish glycogen in the muscles. You could also go in for a quinoa salad, for quinoa contains the most ideal quantity of protein and carbs, and thus needs no additions. You could even add in some vegetables to the meal.Hummus To make this protein-packed dish, soak overnight a cup of chickpeas (kabuli chana), pressure cook for around 30 minutes and keep aside.In a blender/mixer grinder, blend  cup of sesame seeds and water, to form a smooth paste.To a mixer jar, add the cooked chickpeas, sesame paste, some lemon juice, three-four cloves of garlic,  cup of olive oil, tsp each of cumin powder and chilli powder and water, and blend to form a smooth paste.Take the hummus in a bowl, season with salt as required, garnish with fresh parsley or coriander and serve with pita bread as a post-workout meal.Author tweets @srinidhi_gkFor more stories, follow Facebook and Twitter",GREEN GRAM DAL (MOONG DAL)

It was my mothers last wish that I continue her set-up. But when she told me, I said cant do it, and she accepted the answer, says Jhunjhunwala, adding that her mother had a big list of buyers, including the family of politician LK Advani.But somewhere in the heart of hearts, she knew her calling. While things continued just the way they used to be in the initial years after her mothers passing, with staff in Delhi helping out, in the last one year, Jhunjhunwala has been working on creating a social media presence. I just completed a course in online marketing to understand how I should be going about this. With this set-up only including four people who are involved end-to-end, I decided to design the website on my own. I have taken it as a challenge and have also been giving online food demos during the lockdown, says Jhunjhunwala, who moved to Bengaluru from Delhi in 1997.The heirloom recipes  spices, papads and jams  are prepared at her home in Delhi, with Jhunjhunwala travelling there every couple of weeks. During the pandemic, she has been remotely managing the setup.Guests at home were often in awe of the Marwari meal served in a silver thali, and asked her the secret behind the flavours, to which she would always say, The key to any food is the ingredients. Which is why Jhunjhunwala is particular that the ingredients are sourced from the place of origin, without focussing on cost. The products are priced between Rs 80 andRs 450.The Ancient Mint Salt, which Jhunjhunwala found in old handwritten recipe books, blends 25 spices and mineral salts. These include pink Himalayan salt, black salt, Southern salt, and sambar salt to name a few. It also has 19 spices, including long pepper, in small portions. These are added for biryani, parantha, or buttermilk. When I started off, I didnt know what many of these ingredients were. I remember going to Delhis oldest spice market, Khari Baoli, to find out what sambar salt was, which I assumed was made in the South.Much to my surprise, an elderly gentlemen said this originated in Rajasthan, says Jhunjhunwala, narrating that her mother became a child widow at the age of 16, and was mistreated by her in-laws. Her grandfather would have none of it and brought her back to her maternal home. She was then home-schooled all the way to her post graduation, and persuaded her family to send her to the US for further studies.In 1964, she went to Michigan State University to pursue MA in advertising, after which she came back to join her family business before setting up her own in 1970, and became the first woman paper merchant in Delhis all-male paper market. In spite of having a thriving paper trading business she chose to venture into the food at the age of 65, because it was her passion, says Jhunjhunwala.Unlike commercially available papads which are made using soda-bi-carbonate, their range  which includes aloo papad, moong papad, and Bijora, which is sesame papad  are made using an ancient ingredient called Sajji-Khar, which lends the papads a flavour and also makes it pliable and gut-friendly. The staff has been with our family for years and they do the preparations out of muscle memory. But theres one standard all of us go by, Would Amma approve of this?, she says, adding, The biggest reward is when I hear, Ive never tasted anything like this.",GREEN GRAM DAL (MOONG DAL)

Balanced nutrients, with about 50% carbohydrates, 20% to 30% proteins and the rest from fats, says dietician Pradeepa Saravanan, based out of Coimbatore. A traditional breakfast of fermented, steamed foods like idli are gut-friendly, and when had with vegetable protein-based sambar made with seasonal vegetables that give fibre, is just right.For rushed families who want to build nutritious meals, but just dont have the time, the next best option is packaged foods that are minimally processed. Packaged breakfast cereals are made from processed grains and are often high in sugars and refined carbs, cautions Bengaluru-based dietician Dharshini Surendran.Read the food label to find out how much sugar the product contains. The first two or three ingredients are the most important, as they constitute the majority of the cereal. If you see sugar in top three, avoid buying it. Cereals are not advisable for those with diabetes andother health issues, she adds. The best bet is to look at a pack where sugar (in all its different names) is not included at all. Refined oils and additives are also not good for health. The pack must have the mandatory FSSAI accreditation, and date of manufacture and expiry. The longer the shelf life, the more likely the product will have preservatives.Do remember though that even when there are no added sugars, the elderly and those above 40 should avoid any packaged breakfast cereal as porridge. Almost 80% of any cereal (whether rice, wheat, or rajma) is made up of carbs, which get converted to sugar, says Pradeepa. She adds that in porridge form 1 tablespoon has far more quantity that the same amount as a whole grain. The processing also means it has a high glycaemic index.  As wholegrains, we tend to consume less than as a porridge form, says Pradeepa.If you do choose to eat packaged cereal for breakfast, here are some healthier options vetted by dieticians.Cereal Crunchies, Timios160 for a 300 gram packThe main ingredients are whole wheat flour, natural strawberries, beetroot juice powder and cocoa powder. This is a high calorie product suitable for under-weight children and adolescents. The energy is 353 calories per serving of 100 grams which is good for children. They get gluten fibre, however those who are gluten intolerant should avoid it. However, the strawberries and beet powder are used in minimal amounts.Health Mix, Manna104 for a 250 gram packThe main ingredients are ragi, millet, barley, jowar, maize and pulses like fried green gram and nuts that include groundnut, cashew nut and almonds. It is a high calorie breakfast ideal for children (age 5 and above) and adolescents, says Pradeepa. There are no added sugars, which is good.Ragi, Rice & Banana Cereal, Slurrp Farm300 for a 200 gram packThe blend includes ragi, jowar, rice and natural banana powder.The advantage is the use of banana as a sweetener. The sugar comes in fructose form from the fruit. And ragi is the dominating ingredient which ensures that it is packed with calcium, says Dharshini. The energy per 100 gram serving is 400 calories, good for under-weight children, school-going children and adolescents. The carbs are 71.5 grams, important for brain development and memory function, explains Pradeepa.Quinoa Granola Breakfast Cereal, Urban Platter500 for a 500 gram packContains extruded (polished) quinoa flakes, almonds, raisins, jaggery, and pineapple flavour (in powder form). It is good for underweight children, especially in the age group of five to 12. There are adequate nutrients and minerals which a growing child requires, says Pradeepa.Multigrain Porridge, Ammae120 for a 200 gram packIt contains a combination of 16 grains including amaranth seeds, millets, chickpeas, parboiled rice, barley, maize, soya, wheat, oats grain, horse gram, green gram and poppy seeds.It makes for a complete meal because of the combination of all these, says Dharshini.

The organically-grown leaves have been the go-to option for many gardening enthusiasts during the lockdown as these require very little resources to grow and can be harvested in a short duration.A discarded parcel box or tray lined with one-inch high soil and leaf compost in 1:1 ratio is ideal for growing microgreens, Keeny Mahapatra (46), who runs an old-age home, said. Easily available and affordable seeds like mustard, fenugreek and coriander can be sprinkled on the soil and the tray can be kept in the shade. Within 10 days to a fortnight, the plants will reach a two-leaf stage when these can be plucked and eaten, she explained. Even broccoli, radish, green gram and sunflower can be grown to get microgreens, she said.Structural engineer Ajit Mohapatra (62) was attracted towards growing microgreens when he started to read up on organic kitchen garden. Microgreens can be grown in small spaces like a window sil or balcony. I initially tried buckwheat and sunflower, but it was wheatgrass that attracted me the most because of its nutrient content, Mohapatra said. He also gives away the wheatgrass grown by him to others.Keeny points out that microgreens can be grown by senior citizens and children too as these are not labour intensive. 72-year-old Lekha Mohanty grew microgreens in small pots lying about her house. I was getting bored at home during the lockdown. Thats when I started growing microgreens to keep myself busy. I have already had three harvests in the last four months, a beaming Lekha said, adding that it helps multiply ones happiness.Agrees professor of psychology at Utkal University Namita Mohanty. Psychologists often ask people to spend time with nature and doing gardening helps in the release of good hormones, activates our neurotransmitters and relaxes us. The physical activity involved, watching the plants grow and plucking the produce is highly de-stressing, she saidEven the citys leading group of gardening enthusiasts, Plant Lovers Association, is planning a webinar on growing microgreens at home, its secretary P Srinivas said.",GREEN GRAM DAL (MOONG DAL)

Plant-based substitutes, popularised by the likes of Beyond Meat, Impossible Foods and Quorn, increasingly feature on supermarket shelves and restaurant menus.But so-called clean or cultured meat, which is grown from animal muscle cells in a lab, is still at a nascent stage given high production costs.Singapore, a city state of 5.7 million, currently only produces about 10% of its food but has set out ambitious plans to raise that over the next decade by supporting high-tech farming and new means of food production.Josh Tetrick said the San Francisco-based firm was also talking to U.S. regulators but that Singapore was a good bit ahead of the United States.I would imagine what will happen is the U.S., Western Europe and others will see what Singapore has been able to do, the rigours of the framework that they put together. And I would imagine that they will try to use it as a template to put their own framework together, he said in an interview.The Singapore Food Agency said it had reviewed data relating to process, manufacturing control and safety testing before granting approval.Eat Just said it will manufacture the product in Singapore, where it also plans to start making a mung bean-based egg substitute it has been selling commercially in the United States.Founded in 2011, Eat Just counts Hong Kong tycoon Li Ka-shing and Singapore state investor Temasek among its backers. It has raised more than $300 million since its inception, Tetrick said, and is valued at roughly $1.2 billion.It is targeting profitability at an operating income level before the end of 2021 and hopes to go public soon after, he added.Globally more than two dozen firms are testing lab-grown fish, beef and chicken, hoping to break into an unproven segment of the alternative meat market, which Barclays estimates could be worth $140 billion by 2029.Competitors have also attracted some eye-catching investors.U.S.-based Memphis Meats raised funds this year in a deal led by Japans SoftBank Group and Temasek, and also counts Bill Gates and Richard Branson among its backers.Singapores Shiok Meats, which aims to become the first company to sell lab-grown shrimp, is backed by Henry Soesanto of Philippines Monde Nissin Corp, which also owns Quorn.",GREEN GRAM DAL (MOONG DAL)

Let drops of the mixture fall into a container with liquid nitrogen to make frozen spheres; remove with a strainer and reserve in a container in the freezer until serving.Oyster sauce (yields 550g):10 oysters50g shallot5g butter35g oyster water20g oyster sauce625g creamSaltOpen the oysters and reserve their water. Julienne the shallot finely and toss in butter with a pinch of salt over very low heat until it cooks well. Add the oysters and sear them on both sides to brown them lightly; use the oyster water to deglaze, add the oyster sauce, cook for one minute and add cream. Simmer the mixture on very low heat for five minutes, remove and place in Thermomix. Blend the mixture and run it through a fine chinoise. Reserve in a bain-marie at 65C/149F.Garnishing and plating: Cut in half the oysters and, using a paring knife, cut a small base at the tip of each oyster, so that they stand on the plate. On a small soup dish, set one spoonful of very cold black garlic sauce on one side and white garlic shots on top of it, as well as half a cold oyster. On the opposite side, with both sauces touching but not mixing, arrange the hot oyster sauce and the other half oyster, previously heated slightly. This way, a play with cold and hot temperatures is created with both the oysters and the sauces.Chef Srijit Girija GopinathChef at the two-Michelin star Campton Place, and chef owner of Ettan, San FranciscoFavourite immunity-boosting recipe: RasamFor chef Srijit Girija Gopinath, rasam works bestWhy? The key to consumption is to eat what is available locally and what is in season. There is a reason why nature delivers it at a certain time of the year. Indian cuisine is blessed with several immunity-promoting ingredients baked into our recipes already. There is curcumin in turmeric, gingerol and capsaicin in ginger, allicin (sulphur) in garlic, Vitamin C-rich citrus fruits like grapefruit, lemon, lime, tangerine and so on. When it comes to immunity-boosting dishes, though the idea of immunity boosting was never a question then, rasam was part of everyday life. Perhaps thats one of the reasons why we seldom fell sick those days. Today, I love making variations of rasams, with chicken, fish bones, lamb trotters and crab when in season. A good half a dozen ingredients in our humble rasam are today celebrated in the Western world for their immunity-boosting qualities.Nutritionists notes: The star ingredient for an immunity-boosting effect here is tomatoes, which are loaded with a strong antioxidant called lycopene that reduces oxidative stress and enhances immune response. Rasam brings added benefits with anti microbial spices such as cumin, turmeric and ginger.Recipe: Chicken rasamServes 3-4Ingredients:For chicken rasam base3 tbsp groundnut oil300g chicken thighs/ legs with bone (cut in to one-inch pieces)2 tomatoes (medium-size, diced)3 pods garlic (crushed with skin)6 cilantro stems (crushed)1/2 tsp chilli powder1/2 tsp turmeric powderSprig of curry leaves3 tbsp moong dal (soaked)2 tbsp tamarind pulp1 litre of water approx.SaltRasam spice blend1/2 tsp cumin seeds1/4 tsp fenugreek seeds1 tsp fennel seeds1 tsp pepper corn2-3 small red chillies (torn)2 garlic cloves1 tsp urad lentil6 curry leaves1 pinch asafoetidaFor tempering3tbsp sesame oil1 tsp mustard2 shallots, sliced thin1/2 tsp cumin seeds2 cardamoms, crushed3 cloves-inch piece of cinnamon1/2 tsp black pepper, crushed1 tbsp coriander leaves, choppedMethod:Wash the moong dal and add half the water and cook it until soft. Keep it aside. Heat groundnut oil in a pan and add garlic, curry leaves, turmeric and chilli powder, cook for three minutes and add tomatoes and cook until soft.Now add the chicken and sauce for five minutes on high heat. Add cilantro stems, tamarind nectar and moong bean along with water. Add more water if required. Pinch of salt. Let it simmer until chicken is 90 per cent cooked. Now, roast the rasam spice ingredients in a tsp of oil (add asafoetida after the whole spices are roasted). Blend it all together and add it to the simmering chicken rasam base. Continue cooking the chicken until fully cooked. Adjust the seasoning and turn the heat off after adding rasam spice blend simmer for not more than 12-15 minutes.For tempering, add sesame oil and bring it almost to smoke, add mustard and let it splutter. Add all the whole spices and cook it for two minutes and then shallots until light brown. Once again adjust the seasoning, add the coriander leaves and enjoy it out of the pot or strain it and have the broth alone. I prefer to have with chicken and other vegetablesChef Atul KochharChef, restaurateur & entrepreneurFavourite immunity- boosting recipe:Lasooni dalFor chef Atul, this easy recipe from Punjab is what works bestWhy? In Indian vegetarian families, lentil dishes are the main focus of the meal, replacing the meat. This is an easy recipe from Punjab, with a pronounced garlic flavour. Garlic has been part of Indian diet since times immemorial. It boosts immunity and is known to help kill cancer cells, especially colon cancer. Benefits come from raw and cooked garlic  not supplements. Its known to work as an anti-inflammatory, especially as a rub for inflamed joints and muscles. Garlic improves cardiovascular health, it gives better hair and skin and protects your food. When wild garlic is in season, chop the leaves and add at the end for an extra garlic hit, as well as for the colour.Nutritionists notes: Lentils are a good source of zinc and Vitamin B6 that help support our immune system. Allicin is the magic component that gives garlic its immunity-boosting properties. However, to unlock benefits of garlic, crush, mince or chop it and keep away from heat for about 10 minutes before cooking.Recipe: Lasooni dalServes 44 garlic cloves1 small thin green chilli200g split yellow moong dal2 teaspoons ground turmericSeveral sprigs of fresh corianderSea saltFor the tadka4 garlic cloves1 tomato onion2 tablespoons rapeseed or vegetable oil1 teaspoon cumin seeds2 teaspoons ground coriander teaspoon red chilli powder, or to taste teaspoon garam masalaMethod:Bring 750ml of water to the boil in a large covered saucepan and assemble all the ingredients and other equipment before you begin. You also need a sieve and a saut or frying pan. Peel and finely chop the garlic cloves. Remove the stalk from the green chilli, if necessary, and split the chilli lengthways, but leave it whole. Rinse the lentils in the sieve with cold water, then add them to the boiling water and stir in the garlic, green chilli and turmeric. Return the water to the boil, then boil the lentils, uncovered, for 15 minutes, or until they are tender. When the lentils are tender, stir in extra water if they are too dry for you. Meanwhile, to make the tarka, peel and finely chop the garlic cloves. Finely chop the tomato. Peel and finely chop the onion. Heat the rapeseed oil over a medium-high heat in the pan. Add the garlic and cumin seeds and stir until the seeds crackle. Add the onion with a pinch of salt and continue to stir until the onion is lightly browned. Add the ground coriander, chilli powder and garam masala, and stir for 30 seconds to cook the spices. Watch closely so they do not burn. Stir in the tomatoes, lower the heat and continue stirring until they soften and break down, pressing down with your spoon or spatula. Stir the tarka mixture into the lentils and bring to the boil.Just before serving, rinse and finely chop the coriander sprigs. Stir half the chopped coriander into the lentils, then adjust the seasoning with salt, if necessary. Sprinkle over the remaining chopped coriander.Chef Ranveer BrarChef & television hostFavourite immunity-boosting recipe:Ashwagandha-Amla- Hibiscus Iced TeaChef Ranveer Brar picks traditional ingredients as reliable immunity boostersWhy? I believe that our traditional ingredients and our traditional food medicine have enough power to heal and make us resilient. I have spent most of the lockdown trying to research five immunity building ingredients in our food: peepramul, ashwagandha, turmeric, amla and mulethi. Ashwagandha, also called the Indian ginseng, is an ancient medicinal herb. Its known to help reduce stress levels and keep depression at bay. Hibiscus has natural antioxidants and is good for the heart. And amla is packed with Vitamin C and is a natural diuretic.Nutritionists Notes:An all-rounder that can support various features of the immune response. Mulethi keeps the respiratory tract healthy; peepramul acts as a natural pain reliever; ashwagandha, a potent adaptogen, reduces stress and improves the bodys defence system through cell-mediated immunity; turmeric is popularly known for bringing inflammation down, and amla is an excellent storehouse of Vitamin C.Recipe: Hibiscus teaServes 2Ingredients:For immunity tea masala2 tbsp mulethi Powder1 tsp ashwagandha Powder tsp peepli Powder1 pinch turmeric1 tbsp amla JuiceFor Tea2 cup water2-4 large dry hibiscus petals2 tbsp. Honey tsp immunity tea masalaA few mint leaves1 tsp lime juiceMethodOn medium heat, place water in a saucepan and bring it to boil. Turn off the heat. Now add dried hibiscus petals, immunity tea masala, mint leaves and keep for five minutes or more. Pour hot hibiscus tea it in a glass, mix in honey, lime juice and enjoy. Alternatively, let the tea cool down to room temperature and serve.Chef Nelly RobinsonChef-Owner, Nel, Sydney, AustraliaFavourite immunity-boosting recipe:Green Pea Vellouti with Cured Ham and Fresh PeaChef Nelly Robinson believes in the immunity-boosting qualities of green peasWhy? At Nel, we use a lot of ingredients like citrus, ginger and garlic that are very good for your immune system, but one of my favourites is a green pea vellouti with cured ham and fresh pea. Green pea has Vitamin C, which is good for fighting viruses and good for the immune system.Nutritionists Notes: Green peas are packed with Vitamin C, antioxidants and flavonoids that help build strong immunity. As a good source of fibre, peas help support gut health, which is closely related to a well-built immune system.Recipe: Pea and Ham SoupServes 10Ingredients:For the pork hock terrine2 Raw ham hocks3 bunches coriander root4 garlic cloves4 shallots50g ginger3 carrots1 stick celery1 leekPeppercornsStar aniseJuniperFennel seed4 gold leaf gelatineMethod:Place in a pot the ham hocks, coriander, shallot, ginger, carrots, celery, leek, peppercorns, star anise, juniper, fennel seeds in a pot and fill with water, bring to boil and simmer for four to five hours until the meat falls off the bone, drain and strain the stock and reduce, while the stock is reducing pick the meat off the hock and place in a bowl.

The Opposition has hit back, saying the Government is trying to steamroll the laws and is using the anti-national tag to tarnish criticism.In his address, the Prime Minister listed what he called were the three big lies being spread about the farm laws  that MSP would be stopped, mandis would be shut down, and the new reforms would only safeguard contract farming.There is no reason for mistrust in the recent agricultural reforms done by the government, and there is no place for lies, he said.Referring to the Opposition, he said the biggest proof of their hypocrisy was the Swaminathan committee report which had been brushed aside for eight years, before its implementation by his government.Why would we implement the Swaminathan committee report if we did not have to implement Minimum Support Price, he said.He said MSP is announced before sowing to put the farmer at ease. He highlighted that even during the fight against the Corona pandemic, the procurement on MSP was done as usual. He assured farmers that MSP would continue like before.Stating that the government has not only increased the MSP, but has also procured a lot more, he provided MSP figures for wheat, paddy, jowar, lentil, gram, toor and moong to make the point that the current MSP is much higher than those under previous governments.No mandi in the country, he said, has been shut down even after six months of the enactment of the new laws. APMCs are being made stronger and more robust with an investment of Rs 5000 crore, and the new laws on contract farming have ensured that the one who enters into an agreement with farmers cannot escape his responsibility, he said, adding that contract farming has been operational in the country for several decades and is not something new.Jinki khud ki rajnitik zameen khis gayi hai, woh kisano ki zameen chali jayegi, kisano ki zameen chali jayegi ka dar dikha kar, apni rajnitik zameen khoj rahe hain (Those who have lost political ground are trying to scare everyone by saying farmers will lose their land, and they are doing this to regain ground), Modi said, referring to the Opposition.I want to expose these people before the farmers of the country. He said the new farm laws have not come overnight. These were under consideration for 20-25 years by all governments at the Centre, states and had been demanded by farmers organisations, agriculture economists, scientists and progressive farmers, he said.He urged farmers to seek a response from political parties which promised these reforms in manifestoes, but played vote-bank politics and did not keep their word. The things that were promised by them are being reinforced through these laws. They do not have a problem with the agricultural reforms, but they have a problem with Modi. How did he do it and how can Modi be given credit for it, he said.At the event, in the presence of an estimated 20,000 farmers, Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan and his Cabinet colleagues transferred Rs 1,600 crore into the accounts of 35.50 lakh farmers for damages during the kharif season.Agriculture infrastructure works worth Rs 70 crore were inaugurated and 2,000 fishermen and cattle farmers were provided Kisan Credit Cards.

The Congress government here has been working for farmers welfare since they are treated as the backbone of the States economy, says Cooperative Minister Udai Lal Anjana in an interview to The HinduFarmers across the country are agitating against the Centres agriculture sector laws. Rajasthans farmers are also staging a protest at the Haryana border. How concerned is the State government about their welfare?The Congress government in Rajasthan has been constantly taking measures for the farmers welfare since we treat them as the backbone of the States economy. Several new schemes and policies for farmers, introduced during the COVID-19 pandemic, are being implemented effectively in a transparent manner.Farmers are finding it increasingly difficult to sell their produce at remunerative prices. What efforts have been made in this regard?The State government has notified 550 village cooperative societies as well as agricultural cooperative marketing societies as mandi sub-yards for ensuring fair prices and expeditious payments to farmers. They can now sell their produce at one of the notified markets near their agricultural land and village. Open bidding has also fetched them better price. Over 19,200 farmers have benefited from the sale of 6.70 quintal of produce for 152.95 crore.The State government had recently assured low-interest loans to save farmers from forced selling. Has the scheme benefited the farmers?The State government has announced disbursement of loans against the stored produce of farmers at a nominal interest rate of 3% to ensure that they are not forced to sell the farm produce and are still able to meet their financial needs. Over 2,000 farmers associated with 840 cooperatives have availed of an aggregate loan amounting to 20.46 crore under the scheme. They held more than 1.14 lakh quintals of their produce worth 32 crore.A large number of farmers depend on loans to meet their agricultural expenses. Has the Cooperative Department taken measures to reduce their financial hardship?Efforts are being made to make expensive equipment available on lease at affordable prices. Village cooperative societies and agricultural marketing cooperative societies are being associated with custom hiring centres and 8 crore has been sanctioned for opening these centres at 100 cooperatives. New village cooperative societies have also been formed across the State. They will help the farmers access loans, purchasing fertlisers and other activities at their own village panchayat. The approval for 129 primary agricultural credit societies and 21 large area multi-purpose societies has associated 75,000 more people with the cooperative sector.Which crops are being procured on minimum support prices in Rajasthan? How are the procurement centres functioning?We have enhanced the limit for procurement of moong and groundnuts by 10%, providing the benefit to over 29,000 farmers. The 266 procurement centres for moong and 365 for groundnuts have so far purchased 30,638 metric tonnes and 7,253 metric tonnes of the two farm produce, respectively.The functioning of cooperative banks has often come into question in Rajasthan. Are some efforts being made to improve the process for loan disbursement by these?For the first time in the country, Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot introduced an online registration and disbursement scheme for farm loans in 2019. This has done away with discrepancies in the distribution of loans. Biometric and Aadhaar-based verification, which helped in selecting genuine farmers, has led to the association of 12.72 lakh new members with the farm loan process.",GREEN GRAM DAL (MOONG DAL)

Vitamin D is also known for its effective immune strengthening benefits.The immune system is constantly overburdened with toxins from fried food in winters thus it is advisable to detoxify the body by keeping a fast once a week or using herbs like cilantro in green smoothies or juices.Garlic contains compounds that fight germs and helps to boost the immunity. Sulphur present in the garlic boosts the disease-fighting response of some types of white blood cells in the body when it comes in contact with any kind of viruses, which causes common cold and flu.The active compound curcumin in turmeric fights infection and inflammation by preventing damage caused by free radicals. And to improve the bioavailability of turmeric dont forget to add black pepper which contains a compound called piperine, which when combined with turmeric, increases the absorption of curcumin by upto an astonishing 2000%.Dry and sweet snacks such as panjeeri prepared during winters in the northern parts of our country is very warming and believed to help relieve body pains and opens up muscles and joints. One can make different versions of this using whole wheat, millets, sattu, or moong dal flour and to this, add ghee, nuts, dry fruits, and spices like cardamom, fennel seeds, saffron, and nutmeg.Include green leafy and root vegetable like sarson, bathua, methi, palak(spinach), sweet potato, yam, carrots etc as they are packed with vitamins and minerals. Some common vitamins found in these vegetables are beta-carotene that can be converted in the body to vitamin A, B-vitamins, folate and vitamin C. They are also rich in magnesium, potassium and other minerals found in the local soil. When we eat whats in season we are not only helping the local agriculture but we are also eating food when it has its peak nutrient values, leading to overall health.Winter millets like bajra, ragi and makai as they are good quality starch, high in protein and fibre. Also they are good for maintaining cholesterol levels and energy.Citrus fruits like lemon, alma, orange and grapefruit are the juiciest and are loaded with vitamin C which help in boosting immunity and keeps the cough and cold away.Kahwa green tea acts as an immunity drink, which helps to fight the winter by keeping us warm and free from any infection due to its ingredients like saffron, cinnamon, cardamom, almonds and bay leaves which are excellent sources of vitamins and minerals.Good quality pure ghee generates instant heat and energy for the body to help keep the body warm and cleanse the body from inside. Ghee should be used instead of oils to make every day sabzi and roti.Fresh turmeric root should be consumed in hot water or hot milk before sleeping as it is an Ayurvedic adaptogen and helps to keep the body immune and healthy.Relax, enjoy and sleep well! Chronic stress, depression due to darkness weakens the immune system so enjoy life and sleep for 6-7 hours a day.Inputs by Nutritionist Harleen Gulati and Clinical Nutritionist Ridhima Batra",GREEN GRAM DAL (MOONG DAL)

Roshne Balasubramanian and Vaishali Vijaykumar give you...Sugar cane juice pongal by Shanthi Ramachandran(Instagram @shaanthram)IngredientsRice: 1 cup (150 g) Moong dal: 1 tbsp Sugarcane juice: 2 cups (You can prepare using the stalk at home or use store-bought juice) Jaggery/palm sugar/kalkandu:  cup or required Ghee: 100 g or required amount Cashew, raisins, coconut pieces for garnishingMethodTake a pan. Add some ghee and roast the moong dal. Keep it aside. Take the rice in a strainer and wash it. Roast it in ghee for a minute in the pan.Add the sugarcane juice, one cup of milk, one cup of water and pressure-cook it on medium flame for about five to six whistles (without keeping the inner vessel) until the rice turns soft.Now, add half a cup of powdered jaggery/palm jaggery or natural brown sugar or karuppatti as per your preference.The pongal will melt but will start to thicken after cooking for a few minutes.

Mix well and serve.VariationsYou can use any millet instead of rice.While saffron is not added in traditional south Indian pongal, if you wish, you can add it along with a very small pinch of edible camphor.TipsFor pongal, pudu paccha arisi is recommended because it gives a lovely fresh fragrance and turns soft quickly. It is also much cheaper than regular rice variants. Use of pudu paccha arisi is also considered very auspicious during Pongal because its a symbolic celebration of nature and its harvest.Puli Pongal by Jeyashri Suresh(Instagram @Jeyashris Kitchen)IngredientsBroken rice/arisi kurunai: 1 cup Tamarind a lemon sized Sesame oil: 2 tbsp + 2 tsp Mustard seeds: 1/4 tsp Peanuts: 2 tbsp Chana dal: 1 tsp Urad dal: 1 tsp Green chilli: 1 Dried red chilli: 2 Water: 3 1/2 cups Turmeric powder: 1/4 tsp Asafoetida: a generous pinch Curry leaves: few Salt as neededMethodSoak a small lemon-sized tamarind in 1/2 cup hot water for 10 minutes.

We dont add chopped cilantro/coriander leaves to this sambar.Red rice ven pongal by Padma Balasubramanian(Instagram @Padma Balasubramanian)IngredientsRed rice: 1 cup Moong dal: 1/4 cup Pepper: 1 tsp Jeera: 1 tsp Hing powder: 1/2 tsp Ginger: a small piece, finely chopped Curry leaves: a few Cashews: 10 Ghee: 2 tbsp Oil: 1 tbspMethodWash and soak red rice for an hour in 3.5 glasses of water. Wash the moong dal, drain water and add it to the soaked red rice. Transfer to a pressure cooker and cook for six whistles. Keep the stove in sim for another five minutes and switch off. Allow the pressure to settle down and open after 20 minutes. It would have cooked very soft. If its watery, it will thicken after cooling. Add salt and mix well. Heat a frying pan. Add ghee and oil.

Wash well and add  cup water and two cups of milk. Cover it with a plate. Pressure-cook this for 7-8 whistles and keep it on low flame for five minutes. Switch off the flame. Once the pressure subsides, take it out and mash it well. If it is too thick, you can add some milk and mix well. Soak saffron in one tablespoon of warm milk for five minutes. In a pan, add jaggery and  cup of water. Let the jaggery melt. Filter the impurities and add it to the mashed millet mixture. Mix well and cook for two minutes on low flame. Add ghee and mix well. Add edible camphor. Roast a few cashew nuts in ghee and garnish the dish.NotesAny millet like barnyard millet, little millet or thinai works well for this millet akkaravadisal. I personally dont prefer adding cardamom powder as it will suppress the flavour, or saffron and edible camphor. The consistency of the akkaravadisal is perfect and stays intact for 4-5 hours.Kambu vella pongal or Bajra jaggery pongal by Praveen Kumar(Instagram @Awesome Cuisine)IngredientsKambu (bajra): 1 cup Moong dal: 1/4 cup Jaggery: 1 1/2 cups Ghee: 1/4 cup Cashew nuts: a handfulRaisins: a handful Cardamoms: a few Water: 6 cupsMethodDry roast the bajra until it gives out an aroma, and keep it aside.To the same pan, add the moong dal and roast for a minute.

Perhaps thooyamalli, a heritage rice variety?The cooker with black rice and dal whistles, puffing steam along with a drizzle of purple-coloured water onto my kitchen walls.I wince at the thought of cleaning up: black rice, evidently, is not easy to handle. But once I open the cooker  after five whistles and 10-minutes of simmering on low flame  the glistening deep-purple rice makes me forget all else.Kavuni arisi or black rice pongal is the third variety I am experimenting with. In an attempt to make sakkarai pongal with heritage rice varieties this year, I narrow down to three: thooyamalli, kavuni arisi, and thinai arisi. The best pongal wins, which I will cook on the big day.Sakkarai pongal is a silky concoction of rice, moong dal, jaggery and ghee. Although raw rice is widely used, several heritage rice varieties make for a great pongal. These include iluppai poo samba, mappilai samba, neelam, Salem sanna, jeeraga samba, hand-pound raw rice, thooyamalli, kuruvai, and thinai arisi, according to Praveen Anand, executive chef, South Indian Cuisine, ITC Hotels.Millet on white backgroundPongal is a festival in which farmers offer to Nature whatever they grew on their land, explains Praveen, adding, The above varieties are grown in the Madurai belt, the stronghold of Tamil culture.Cooking time and the amount of water required, varies for each; Praveen suggests soaking the hard varieties such as mappilai samba for half an hour before cooking.Round 1Thooyamalli is from his list and the rice, slightly longer, but as thin as jeeraga samba, does a great job of becoming one with the jaggery and dal. The taste is similar to the typical raw rice pongal; the rice, a shade darker than ivory, bears a mild fragrance.Round 2Thinai or foxtail millet is technically not a rice variety. But I decide to cook it thanks to a conversation Coimbatore-based A Shrikumar, (who works for an NGO) had with an elderly man from a tribal village in the Sathyamangalam forest.I learnt that people of the Urali tribe make pongal with millets, thinai, ragi, cholam, varagu or samai, says Shrikumar. This is because they chiefly grow millets in the hills. And years ago, when jaggery was difficult to source, tribal people used honey to sweeten their pongal. They also made a curry with the vegetables they grew, to be had with pongal, he points out. They used wild tubers, broad beanswhatever they cultivated.Clockwise from left: Black rice, thinai, and thooyamalli pongal | Photo Credit: Special arrangementI cook thinai pongal in a steel wok since millets do not require pressure-cooking. The tiny round morsels yield well  in no time, they take in the jaggery syrup I spoon in. Thinai has a nice earthy fragrance that is subdued in the end result: what makes this pongal stand apart is the pleasingly grainy texture.Round 3Kavuni or black rice is the best-looking of them all. Apart from the health benefits the rice boasts, I pick it to attempt cooking a hard rice variety. Which means it requires soaking the night before to make the rice pliable. I pressure-cook it: it is easier that way. But before that, I spread the soaked rice on a piece of cloth to dry and dry roast it before cooking.I add jaggery syrup and simmer the deep-purple mix of rice and dal, but the colour remains the same. Once done, I top it with plenty of ghee-roasted cashews. The taste is unique: the rices nutty flavour fits jaggerys sweetness to the T. And the pongal is chewy, with a depth of flavour.The winner is undoubtedly black rice. It is slightly more elaborate to cook, but the end result is worth it.",GREEN GRAM DAL (MOONG DAL)

""To improve the quality of prices data for reporting daily prices by the price reporting centres, the Department of Consumer Affairs launched a Mobile App on 1st January, 2021,"" the department said in a statement.It said that the monitoring and predictive analysis of prices of essential commodities has taken a giant step forward.The mobile app for price monitoring for 22 essential commodities has started providing effective real time information about retail and wholesale prices from 127 locations across the country, the statement said.The daily report of retail and wholesale prices are obtained from 127 centres located across the country. The daily report of prices and indicative price trends are analysed for taking appropriate decisions such as release of stocks from the buffer and export-import policy etc. ""Price reporting through Mobile App ensures reporting from the market location as data are geo-tagged thereby displaying the location from where price data are reported,"" the statement said.The reporting of static data from office desktop is ruled out through the application of Mobile App. ""Therefore, the condition to operationalise Mobile App is that each Price Reporting Centre has to furnish market details such as names and addresses of the shops and markets from where prices are being collected daily,"" it said.As per the guidelines for retail price reporting, the prices of the same variety of a commodity are to be collected from three markets -- high income market, middle income market and low income market, and the average of the three prices is to be reported.The department said that the mobile App has inbuilt feature to calculate and report the average price. This helps in avoiding human errors in calculation. Market information from Agmarknet, Agriwatch, NAFED and trade associations also constitute inputs for price analysis.The department is also utilising the services of Agriwatch for providing market intelligence, predictive analysis of prices and to develop price forecasting model.The department said it had proposed to DEA (department of economic affairs) for technical assistance fund under CARES Progamme of Asian Development Bank (ADB) for improving price monitoring and analysis.The activity components under the technical assistance are upgradation of price monitoring portal, capacity building for price reporting centres and price monitoring cell, identification of long-term improvements for food commodity supply chain & market efficiency.It said that the DEA has approved the proposal.",GREEN GRAM DAL (MOONG DAL)

The duo was brought to Thiruvananthapuram zoo from Nagaland in 2017.Kohima, the Himalayan bear, at Thiruvananthapuram zoo having frozen watermelon pieces | Photo Credit: SREEJITH R KUMARWith the mercury levels rising, specific care is given to the residents on the 36-acre Thiruvananthapuram zoo. The daily menu has been tweaked for most of the animals. We include fruits and vegetables that are juicy and fleshy, especially watermelons and salad cucumbers, so that residents are not dehydrated. Both animals and birds relish those, says TV Anilkumar, Superintendent of the zoo.In the 155-plus kilograms of fruits and vegetables purchased daily, there are 25 kilograms of watermelon, nine kilograms of salad cucumber, 20 kilograms of cucumber (vellari) and 25 kilograms of different banana varieties. Salad cucumber is an addition this year because the animals like it more than vellari. We have even cut down the quantity of vellari by five kilograms, adds Sangeetha Mohan, Curator at the zoo.Carnivores reduce their meat intake during the summer months. For instance, tigers normally consume seven kilograms of meat daily. It comes down to five kilograms or so, says Dr Jacob Alexander, Zoo Veterinarian. Over 86 kilograms of meat (beef and chicken) is needed on a day for the carnivorous animals including seven tigers, two lions, six leopards, 10 hyenas, two foxes and four jungle cats.Short takes The diet chart is prescribed by the Central Zoo Authority.There are over 1,200 animals belonging to 105 species at the zoo. While primates and carnivores are fed only in the morning, rest of the animals have a meal at 11.30 am and 4 pm. Carnivores fast on Mondays, a regular holiday for the zoo.Water birds, otters, gharials and turtles eat fish. Ducks and swans have rice, amaranthus, green gram and cucumber. Peacocks and pheasants eat green chillies, coriander leaves, green gram, cooked rice and big onions.Among the flightless birds, rheas prefer cabbage, carrot, poultry feed, amaranthus and rice. While ostriches have amaranthus mixed with dog food, bananas and vegetables, emus are given carrot and bananas.Rhinos have cattle feed, cucumber, carrot, long beans, onion, grass, fodder and mineral mix.Monkeys now get more fruits, especially oranges and grapes, besides their daily meal of boiled eggs (they love egg whites!), guava, apple, bananas, coconut, papayas, groundnut (husked and de-husked), tomatoes, pineapple and long beans.Bath timeElaborate arrangements are also in place to keep the animals hydrated throughout the day. Sprinklers and fans have been installed inside the enclosures of rheas and nilgais or blue bulls. We operate the sprinklers at noon and they happily soak in the water to cool off. Or they move towards the fans to get relief. Sprinklers also ensure that there is enough green vegetation in the enclosures, adds Anilkumar.Meanwhile tigers, leopards and lions have the luxury of showers and concrete water pools within their cages. They love to rest in the water. Water is let out to the enclosures of Barasingha (swamp deer) and sambar deer so that they can create their own swampy environment with puddles, adds Dr Jacob. The regular diet for deer and other herbivores is a concentrated ration with cattle feed, Bengal gram sprouts, cotton seed and green gram, salt and mineral mix, besides grass and fodder. Mineral block and salt licks are always kept in the enclosures.Parrots feeding on fruits and vegetables at Thiruvananthapuram zoo | Photo Credit: SREEJITH R KUMARBirds get to eat more leafy greens these days, especially green amaranthus, which they have with rice. Garlic used to be an ingredient in their diet. But we dropped it ever since they showed an aversion to its taste, Sangeetha says.Special care is being given to three ostriches, two males and female. A few years ago an ostrich had died of heat stroke. It is the courting season for the ostrich and already seven eggs have been been laid.Water kept in clay pot for green vine snake to cool off at the reptile house at Thiruvananthapuram zoo | Photo Credit: SREEJITH R KUMARIn the reptile house, water is kept in clay pots for snakes to coil up against when temperature goes up. The three King cobras and two anacondas have the luxury of air-conditioned enclosures. While the anacondas, Dhil and Ruth, are fed a chicken and a rabbit once a week, the cobras feast on rat snakes.While summer is a difficult time for all zoos in the country, the situation is better in Thiruvananthapuram. That is because Kerala doesnt have extreme weather conditions, be it summer or winter. So all we have to do is take measures to bring down the temperature during summer. There are enough ponds for some animals. The staff keeps a tab on the animals even at night and refill the water basins, Anilkumar says.",GREEN GRAM DAL (MOONG DAL)

Farmers said this was a direct effort on part of the government to control pulse price inflation ahead of state elections at the expense of farmers incomes.Lalit Patil Bahal, executive president of Shetkari Sanghatana, claimed this promotion of imports would result in the ongoing farmers movement spreading to other parts of the country.On March 19, the central government had announced its intention of allowing imports of 4 lakh tonnes of tur and 1.5 lakh tonnes of moong for the next fiscal. This was in addition of 2 lakh tonnes of tur to be imported from Mozambique and 4 lakh tonnes of urad, which was announced earlier. India annually imports 10-15 lakh tonnes of pulses, which is a steep fall from the 30-40 lakh tonnes of import the country used to report around five years ago.Traders pointed out how in the previous years, the import quotas were announced towards end of April or early May, with daal millers and processors expected to complete the imports before the domestic arrivals start in the markets. This year, the import quotas have been preponed, which traders said was because of the pulse price inflation noticed in the country. Prices of almost all pulses in the country is now between Rs 100-120 per kg in retail markets.Arrival of urad and moong, both kharif crops, in wholesale mandis is negligible, but farmers continue to bring tur to the mandi. At Laturs wholesale mandi  the largest tur market in the country  around 2,500 quintals of the lentil arrive on a daily basis. As against the government-declared Minimum Support Price (MSP) of Rs 6,000 per quintal, the average trading price of tur at Laturs market is Rs 6,800.Nitin Kalantri, a Latur-based dal miller and trader, pointed out how mandi prices dropped to Rs 6,700 a day after the import quota was announced.

Referring to the ongoing farmers agitation against the three farm laws in the country, Patil Bahal said such trade decisions would result in the movement spreading to other parts of the country.Interestingly, Patil Bahals outfit had earlier supported the laws. Anil Ghanwat, another leader from Shetkari Sanghatana, which was founded by late Sharad Joshi, is part of the three-member body constituted by the Supreme Court to study the laws.Manikrao Kadam, another farmer leader from Maharashtra, pointed out how farmers had taken to growing pulses to make the country self-sufficient in protein. If the government doesnt ensure proper prices for farmers, they will again go for other crops, he said.",GREEN GRAM DAL (MOONG DAL)

Subscribe here.)Her initial idea was to bring out a booklet for the community, but the information proved too voluminous. The result of her research has now been published as Classic Cuisine and Celebrations of the Thanjavur Maharashtrians.Culture across the pagesChennai-based Jaishri took up this task after her elder son was employed overseas and younger one joined university. The Thanjavur Maharashtrian diaspora is spread across the globe, and assuming that both my sons would one day leave the country, I wished to preserve our communitys unique cooking traditions and cultural heritage for the next generation, says Jaishri.The book features over 150 recipes, many of which are offered as naivedya (prayer offerings) during festivals, besides everyday dishes and delicacies.As festivals and religious rituals are a quintessential part of Maharashtrian culture, the author has structured the book chronologically, starting with the festival of Gudi Padwa in the month of Chaithra (March/April) and ending with the festival of Shimga Puneva (Holi) that falls in the month of Phalgun (February/March).As the community follows all rituals and celebrates festivals with fervour, I decided to follow this structure, where I mention the festival, talk about the rituals involved, and the dishes associated with a particular celebration, says Jaishri.In the section on Gudi Padwa, she lists staple heritage dishes such as puran poli, chinch bhath (tamarind rice), limbacha bhath (lemon rice), vaangi bhath (brinjal rice), ambode (a deep-fried spicy snack made with dal), pitla (mixed veg and lentil curry cooked in tamarind water), kadi (buttermilk-based curry) and other recipes.Timely evolutionOver three centuries, the Thanjavur Maharashtrians have also created new dishes, influenced by the Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Karnataka cuisines. Pitla and daangar (urad dal flour blended with curd) are typical Thanjavur Maharashtrian dishes, evolved over a period of time.Early migrants also replaced certain ingredients with locally available ones. For example, copra (dried coconut) is widely used in many Maharashtrian dishes, but in our community freshly grated coconut is roasted and then used to get the copra taste, she says.Coriander seeds, cumin and coconut are the dominant spices used in this cuisine.  We use various spice powders toasted in a minimal amount of oil to flavour the dishes.The simplicity of preparation with a good balance of spices is the hallmark of Thanjavur Maharashtrian cuisine, says Jaishri.A classic combination is ambat bhaaji, daangar and kaatracha misiringa (mor molaga Thanjavur style). Ambat bhaaji is a signature dish of our community. This spinach sambar is prepared with a liberal amount of toor dal, spiced with green chillies and seasoned with mustard, dry chillies and fenugreek. In sweets, puran poli, doodh poli and besan ladoo top the list.Methkoot and daangar are typical examples of the protein-rich diet of this diaspora. Methkoot is a powder made using a mix of lentils such as toor, channa, moong and urad. Coriander, cumin and dry ginger are used to flavour this powder, which can be used in multiple ways as an accompaniment or even mixed with curd or tamarind water.The book has been well received by the diaspora, especially the younger generation, and it has also won the Best Vegetarian Cuisine Book in the World Award by Gourmand International for the year 2020, says Jaishri.The book and Kindle versions are available on Amazon.",GREEN GRAM DAL (MOONG DAL)

This year, snuggle at home with one such universal favourite  dahi vada, with all its shapes, flavours and toppingsFood in India is decided by season, and the ingredients available in the region one lives in. The festival of colours, Holi is just round the corner and, as the temperature rises, celebrations are incomplete without food that not only tickles your taste-buds, but also cools you down.Rajani Jain, a home chef in Delhi says, What better way than cool dahi vada after spending hours outside playing Holi? The dahi (curd) cools you down and the common urad dal vadas, laced with masalas  cumin, coriander and chat masala powder  bring forth a burst of flavours. I prefer ginger juliennes on it, with anar dana (pomegranate seeds), she adds.A homemade dish of dahi vada | Photo Credit: Prabalika M BorahThere are many such preferences and not restricted to toppings alone. There are variations that give this dish an interesting spin, like vadas made with mixed lentil, moong dal, bread, oats or even with jeera butter cookies. An illustration to go with Tarla Dalals recipe, for instance, suggests vadas can be made with jeera butter cookies, slightly soaked in lukewarm water before dunking them in a pool of seasoned yoghurt. The mixed lentil variety, also called masala vada, consists of chana dal, urad dal and moong dal, all coarsely ground.The tough questionDahi vada is a simple dish, but it can get complicated if the vadas are not soft enough.According to chef Garima Poddar, dahi vadas are unique, because though they are deep fried, they melt in your mouth. She adds: A lot of people get stuck with hard vadas or bhallas. To avoid this, one can soak the fried vadas in water for a few seconds, then squeeze the water out gently by pressing them between ones palms and drop them them in dahi.Having said that, softness need not be an obsession, adds Garima, In Rajasthan, the vadas are made with a slightly coarse paste of lentils, so there is a bite to its texture.Chef Kunal Kapoor suggests that the urad batter be made with less or no water, to get soft vadas. Whisking the batter well, for quite some time, right before frying the vadas will also be helpful, he says.Experimental matchmakingA dahi vada alu dum stall in Cuttack, OdishaStreet food lovers in Cuttack, Odisha have created their own twist to the dahi vada, pairing it with alu dum in a treat exclusive to this city.The now-iconic street food dahi vada and alu dum is a fusion experiment that has clicked very well, says consultant chef Rachit Kirteeman.Homemade dahi vada, by Hina Gujral Ingredients: 1 cup dhuli urad dal (split black gram); 1 chopped green chilli;  inch peeled and grated ginger; A pinch of asafoetida; 4 tbsp water; Salt to taste; Oil for deep frying; Lukewarm water; 2 cups thick yoghurt (curd); 1 tsp chat masala; 1 tsp cumin powder (for curd); 1 tsp cumin powder (for topping);  tsp black salt; 2 tsp sugar; 2 tbsp sweet tamarind chutney; 2 tbsp coriander and mint chutney; 1/2 tsp red chilli powder; 1 tbsp chopped corianderMethod:To make the vada batter, wash and soak dal in water for six hours or overnight. Transfer soaked dal to the grinder with chopped green chillies and grated ginger. Grind dal without using water, stop mixer in between, stir with a spatula and grind again. Keep doing this at regular intervals. If it still does not turn into a smooth paste, add one or two tablespoons of water, then grind. The idea is to use minimum water. Transfer the paste to a large bowl. Add salt, asafoetida and whisk batter briskly for a couple of minutes or till it is light and fluffy.Deep fry the vadas over medium heat by shaping small portions of the batter into flat balls with your fingers (dampened with water), or dropping them into the oil with the help of spoons. Allow them to cook as they fry. They can be turned when they are pale golden from the base and sides. Fry until they become crisp.Soak the vadas in lukewarm water in a wide saucepan. Keep enough space for the vadas to breathe, as they expand in water. Let them soak for about 10 minutes or until soft and drain out excess water from each vada by gently pressing between your palms.To assemble, first take curd in a bowl. Add salt, cumin powder, sugar and chat masala and whisk till smooth. Dilute the curd and season it to taste.Arrange vadas in a serving bowl. Pour the flavoured curd over the vadas, so that it soaks them completely. Top with the green chutney and tamarind chutney. Sprinkle red chilli and cumin powder and chat masala to taste. Garnish dahi vada with chopped coriander leaves. Serve chilled.He elaborates, The Cuttack region of Odisha produces a lot of milk. So instead of letting it go waste, curd was made. Vada is a staple breakfast. Someone who had surplus of both curd and vada mixed it together and added the alu dum as an unusual accompaniment. Dahi vada in Odisha uses diluted curd, so when alu dum is added, it becomes a complete dish.Season to tasteAs for spicing the yoghurt, Garima says, There is no thumb rule to seasoning the dahi. The same applies to its consistency. Some like it thick and creamy, others like it slightly runny. Experiment with what works for your palate on a small quantity of dahi.One of Garimas favourite variations of dahi vada is the South Indian version, which uses a runny curd base.She says, I also enjoy the tempering on it. One can play it up with any seasoning. I have tasted it with a garnish of peri peri masala, and also read about dahi vada with Tabasco sauce.Kunal suggests creative toppings: It is a season of fruits, so there is no harm in adding chopped fruits such as apples, bananas, grapes or even melons to the whisked yoghurt.",GREEN GRAM DAL (MOONG DAL)

But due to scarce rainfall in the last four months, the hopes of farmers were shattered as the crops got affected.Even after such plight, the farmers could not use machinery like water sprinklers which could have helped save the crops. Reason, lack of awareness on using such machinery and funds crunch. Only 4o of 2,198 farmers who had sown green gram in the district bought the sprinklers which were sold at a subsidised rate of `12,000 per unit by the Agriculture department.But the sprinklers too did not help as farmers alleged those stopped functioning within a couple of months. A farmer of Naugaon said the sprinkler he had bought stopped functioning within a couple of months due to which his crop on around 2.5 acre of land was spoiled.Sarat Chandra Nayak (65) of Sanpur village in Jagatsinghpur block said he does not recall facing such adverse conditions in the past. I had cultivated green gram on two acre of land and now it is tough to even recover the cost of seeds, he said.

Retail inflation has soared to a three-month high of 5% in February, while WPI (wholesale) inflation surged to a 27-month high of 4.2% in the same month, largely led by strengthening fuel, food and manufactured product prices.This is really a big problem for all of us, as high prices are upsetting our monthly budget, said Paramita Biswas, a professional singer and YouTuber in Kolkata. She said due to the pandemic, sanitisers and masks have added to expenses on health.The retail inflation data for February showed the extent of the strengthening prices. Meat and fish prices rose an annual 11.3% in February, while egg prices shot up 11.1%. Oils and fats rose 20.8%, while pulses and products rose 12.5%. In fact, prices of mutton, which hovered at Rs 500 per kg pre-pandemic, nearly doubled during the lockdown and have remained Rs 750-800 per kg a year later.Price of tur dal, which was around Rs 95 per kg in Delhi in April last year, has now soared to Rs 108 per kg. It is a similar story for other pulses such as urad and moong in cities such as Mumbai and Kolkata. Edible oil prices have also hardened. Mustard oil, which was selling at Rs 114 per kg in Mumbai last year, is now available for Rs 155 per kg, while sunflower, which was at Rs 105 per kg in Kolkata, is now at Rs 179 per kg.Rising fuel costs have also added to the woes of households, although of late there has been some easing. The NDA government had been successful in managing inflationary pressures since assuming power in 2014 against the backdrop of stubbornly high prices, but the pandemic-triggered price increases have upset the cart.Chinmoy Barik, who works as an engineer in an IT company, has been staying in Bengaluru for the last seven years with his wife, daughter and mother. He says the spike in fuel prices has hit his monthly budget majorly this year compared to last year. Though most of the year he has worked from home. It has hit my monthly budget as savings have gone down. A lot of extra expense has been incurred due to ordering food online during the lockdown, he said.The surge in prices of commodities and other costs are prompting people to reduce expenses on activities such as eating out.Rajiv Bansal, a bank employee in Mumbai, has a family of three. He continues to work from home for three days a week. Eating out has dropped substantially. He says his grocery, fruits and vegetables purchase costs have shot up not because of high prices but due to the buying of more quantity and exotic stuff. In education, there is a saving on childrens school uniform, transport and a marginal reduction in fees as extracurricular activities and field trips are not happening due to the pandemic. He has managed to re-negotiate the rent of his one-bedroom flat as several tenants in the complex had vacated and landlords were offering lower rates.While prices of vegetables are expected to stabilise as supplies improve, overall inflationary pressure is expected to linger for now. The latest Reserve Bank of India (RBI) inflation expectation survey showed that more households expect general prices as well as inflation to increase in the next one year. This is prominent in the case of food and non-food commodities. Households also expect more pressure on price of services over the one-year horizon when compared to a one-quarter (three-month) period.Pandemic-induced lifestyle changes are also adding to costs for some households. Consumption of vegetables and fruits suddenly shot up since the outbreak of the pandemic as we were forced to stay indoors. Now, we have decided to cut short on those expenses. Post-lockdown, we are now taking short breaks to entertain us, said Sumathi Jaykumar, a self-employed Chennai resident.",GREEN GRAM DAL (MOONG DAL)

Just like last year, the Covid-19 pandemic has thrown a spanner in the celebrations with number of positive cases rising every day. However, it has not dulled the spirit of worshippers who are happy to attend the virtual services from home and share a meal with their families.Talking about the services being held over the Holy Week, Father MM Kennedy from St Francis Xavier Church in Yapral, says: Our services are being held both physically and virtually. We are following government restrictions and allowing only a certain number of worshippers inside the church so as to follow physical distancing. We have open grounds outside the church and that makes the process easier. We had the morning service which reminds us of Jesus instituting the Eucharist and priesthood.Besides these, we carry out the ritual of washing feet which symbolises work of the Lord as service to the people. Today, on Good Friday, we remember the passion and death of our Lord, and we marked the Way of The Cross (14 stations) by taking all safety precautions. During the evening, we will follow Veneration of The Cross. On Saturday, at around 10 pm, we will hold the night Easter vigil which marks the Resurrection of Jesus.Roydin Roach, who is the Telangana president of the All India Catholic Union, says: In Hyderabad, we saw a large number of people offering prayers on Good Friday while taking Covid-19 precautions. Many parishes are broadcasting their services online through their own YouTube channels or Facebook Live feature. Liturgy TV, Catholic Hub and Divyavani TV are a few of the channels which telecast all services, in Hindi and English, live from city churches. We saw tableau and plays enacted across churches on Good Friday. At a few places, only the actors were allowed on the church grounds, while worshippers watched them from home. The night Easter Vigil, which can go on till 1:30 am, is the most important service of Easter. It involves rituals like lighting the candles and sprinkling of holy water.Easter is also the time of feasting for those who have been observing Lent fast for 40 days. Talking about the different dishes that are prepared during the fasting period and its culmination, Jacqueline Nicholas from Jackies Patisserie & Cafe says: My chicken roasts sell like hot cakes on Easter. Many followers do not eat meat during the 40-day period. The fasting ends after the Easter night service and people celebrate with chicken roasts along with grilled vegetables and Easter eggs. We have the tradition of eating hot cross buns and Kanji rice with various chutneys on Good Friday. The dish, to which no tadka is added, is prepared with rice, roasted moong dal and grated coconut. I made groundnut, onion and coconut chutneys to go with Kanji this year.Sujatha Stephen, who is a nutritionist with Yashodha Hospital, says that Easter is an auspicious festival for her family. Describing a typical Easter day at her home, she says: We start preparations for Easter after Good Friday. Due to the pandemic, we are not attending the early morning service at church and will be part of it virtually. In the pre-pandemic days, I used to go to St Georges Church. We would decorate the church with jasmine flowers. After the service, we would be offered Easter eggs which were boiled eggs with coloured shells. At home, we eat chocolate Easter eggs, cakes and a special meal. We marinate turkey in the morning and grill it to perfection. Later, at a lunch attended by friends and family, we serve it with either coconut rice or chicken biryani.

Vishukkani, the tradition of opening your eyes to witness the bounty of Nature, gold and God and the practice of receiving money from elders as Vishukaineetam are all integral to the festival. Then, of course, the joy in bursting crackers and feasting on the sadya.The festival has many regional variations. The celebrations are at its zenith in northern Kerala. Vishukkanji and Vishukkatta, for instance, are prepared only on the day of Vishu in those regions. If Vishukkanji, a gruel with rice and coconut or coconut milk is special for Palakkad and some parts of Kozhikode, Vishukkatta or rice cake cooked in coconut milk is a speciality of Thrissur district.Vishukkanji and butter beans stir fry | Photo Credit: Spicy N TastyEven the kanji has its variations. The simplest method is cooking unakkalari (raw rice with bran) and adding a generous amount of grated coconut to it at the end. We have it with a stir-fried curry, generally prepared with puliyavara (butter beans or Lima beans), says Vishnukumari A, a native of Kannambra in Palakkad, now settled in Kannur.The popular preparation of kanji has puliyavara and split green gram cooked with any variety of rice, such as puzhukkalari (red rice), pachari (raw rice) or Ponniyari (full-boiled rice). Both puliyavara and green gram are dry roasted. The former is pounded so that the outer skin, which is hard, comes off. If you are using whole green gram, it is better to pound it after dry roasting the same.Kanji wont be tasty if the skin is not removed. It can cause indigestion as well. We keep puliyavara as one of the items in the Vishukkani and the same beans is used in the gruel, says Lakshmi Kutty PP, a homemaker from Kallekulangara in Palakkad. Cumin, ghee or pepper can be added to up the taste of the gruel. If jackfruit is available, we make puzhukku (raw jackfruit cooked with coconut paste and spices) as the side dish, she adds.A different spinVishukkanji is usually served for breakfast on the festival day. In our tharavadu (ancestral home), it is served from 10.30 am onwards and is had for lunch as well. We dont prepare the sadya, says Manjula Jyothiprakash, a YouTube food blogger (Spicy N Easy) from Alathur in Palakkad.Vishukkanji (Palakkad style) Cook raw rice (1/2 cup), Matta rice (1/2 cup), split green gram (1/2 cup, dry roasted and with skin), and puliyavara or butter beans (2 tsp, dry roast and pound to remove the skin) with salt (as required) and water (one litre) in a pressure cooker. Switch off the stove after six whistles. Add water to adjust the consistency and cook. When the gruel boils, mix grated coconut (1 cup). Have it hot with a side-dish of your choice or pappadams or rice fritters.Courtesy: Spicy 'N' EasyI use both pachari (raw rice) and Ponniyari in equal quantities. Although some people cook the rice in coconut milk, I find it more tasty with grated coconut. In our house, we have stir-fried puliyavara as the side-dish. For this, the puliyavara has to be soaked overnight. Pappadams and rice kondattam (rice fritters) make it an even more tastier spread, says Manjula.However, neither puliyavara nor green gram figure in the gruel prepared by Kozhikode-based Hemalatha Chandran. I use nellu kuthari (par-boiled rice). Once the rice is almost cooked in water, ground cumin is mixed to it. Then coconut milk is added (first add second extract or randaam paal followed by the thick first extract or onnaam paal) and boiled. Add salt and adjust the consistency. It is more like a jeeraka (cumin) kanji, she says. The side-dish is stir-fried raw banana and long beans.Vishukkatta is a rice cake cooked in coconut milk and is often had with jaggery syrup | Photo Credit: Aswathy ManuVishukkatta is made with pachari. It is cooked in randaam paal and water. Once the rice is cooked and water dries, salt and the thick onnaam paal is added. Keep stirring it until it reaches the consistency of halwa. Grease a plate with some coconut milk and transfer the preparation on to it. Once it cools, it can be cut into pieces, says Anitha Hari from Edamuttam in Thrissur. A breakfast or pre-lunch dish, it tastes best with jaggery syrup.  We also have it with inji puli (tangy dish made with ginger, tamarind and jaggery), she adds.Karayappam, a different version of unniyappam (deep-fried dumpling with rice flour, banana and jaggery) is made in parts of Kannur on Vishu day. It has sugar instead of jaggery and is slightly bigger than the unniyappam. It is an offering for the deity when we arrange the Vishukkani, says Indira Jayadas from Vadakara.Vishukkatta is a rice cake cooked in coconut milk and is often eat with jaggery syrup | Photo Credit: Aswathy ManuAlthough the Vishu feast is usually a vegetarian affair, non-vegetarian dishes are also served in several households. Pork is a favourite in some families in Thrissur and Ernakulam. In some parts of Palakkad district, a meat dish (chicken or mutton) with ash gourd is prepared on the next day of Vishu. Meat masala and fish fry are a must on the leaf! As in the case of Onam, we begin the sadya with pazham-pappadam kuzhachathu (a mix of mashed banana, sugar, pappadam, ghee and nuts). Cherupayar parippu (split green gram) pradhaman is the payasam of the day, says Indira.",GREEN GRAM DAL (MOONG DAL)

A lot of nuts and seed varieties can be germinated too.Now, sprouting is said to add to the nutritional content and make it a lot healthier to eat. According to nutritionists, soaking seeds in water allows softening up of the outer shells and membranes that may contain some anti-nutrients and may not facilitate proper absorption. It also eliminates gas-producing starch and lessens the cooking time of legumes and pulses.Usually eaten raw or cooked, sprouts can help maximize nutrient absorption of core vitamins, minerals, antioxidant profiles which benefit good health.Not only are they a powerhouse of nutrition, but their health benefits would also convince you to add them to your diet. We tell you about a few such reasons:Sprouting legumes, seeds or vegetables help eliminate phytic acid present in the membranes which limit the presence of digestive enzymes within the seeds.Now, a lot of the important enzymes present within the seeds help facilitate digestive processes, keep our metabolism in check and also work to improve chemical reactions in the stomach when we digest food. The enzymes also break down the food more effectively upon digestion, which helps us absorb nutrients better.Not to forget, sprouting a legume or a cruciferous vegetable adds dietary fibre to the seeds which eliminate toxin build-up from the body and keep the stomach clean and healthy.While it's crucial to have good quality fruits, vegetables, nuts and seeds to lose weight effectively, sprouts are also a healthy option to have. Not only are they filled with benefitting nutrients, but they also are low on calories, which is a prime reason a lot of weight watchers tend to have them in the form of snacks.The fibre present in the sprouted grains can also induce satiety, make us feel full and limit the release of ghrelin, which is an important hunger hormone. Sprouted moong beans, fenugreek seeds particularly are good weight-loss-friendly options to include in your diet.Sprouts contain a healthy dose of core vitamins and minerals like iron, copper, manganese and potassium which help boost the production of RBCs in the body, promote blood flow and most of all, supplies healthy oxygenated blood to vital organs.In a similar manner, germination of seeds and pulses is known to promote the level of Vitamin C and antioxidant profiles which help WBCs and support the immune system, warding off risks of illnesses and infections.Some sprouts contain helpful Omega-3 fatty acids in them which reduce the harmful level of bad cholesterol in the body that is harmful to your health. The anti-inflammatory properties also help reduce oxidative stress and cut down the risk of developing cardiovascular complications, if had regularly. Make sure you include them plenty in your diet.Spouted germs and beans are also a rich source of Vitamin A, Vitamin C, antioxidants which are extremely good for your skin and hair health. It is said that Vitamin A stimulates the growth of hair follicles, regeneration of cells and keeps skin hydrated too.Zinc meanwhile can stimulate levels of sebum in your scalp. Thus, they are excellent for your skin and health!We know that sprouting contains multiple detoxifying, heart and gut-friendly properties. What many dont know is that sprouting and germination contain high levels of glucoraphanin which is a core enzyme that protects your body from multiple types of cancers.Need any more reasons to have sprouts?",GREEN GRAM DAL (MOONG DAL)

In fact, kanji is on song now.Oru kanji paattu (kanji song), produced by MuzicIndia, is all the rage among non-resident Keralites. Sung by Rema Iyer, a medical practitioner in the UK, the music video of the song has become a hit for its evocative lyrics. When Rema, a gynaecological oncologist at the Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother Hospital in Margate, UK was recuperating from surgery, she turned to kanji, the comfort food for many hailing from Kerala.Also known as Congee, it is a popular dish in many countries in Asia. Eaten hot or cold, it can be consumed as breakfast, lunch or dinner. Rema says she had it hot with a variety of sides to go with it.My surgery was in last November, when we were grappling with COVID-19 and winter with its grey skies and cold days. I found myself making hot kanji more than usual and enjoying every bit of it, recalls Rema. It was then that she remembered a song her mother, Rohini Iyer, had written on kanji. With simple lyrics and an easy hummable tune, the song was about the goodness of the food and the many ingredients and curries it could be combined with. The comfort food brings with it a whiff of childhood garnished with nostalgia and spiced with familiarity. Lyrics conjure images of sizzling hot kanji with puzhukku, a mash of vegetables cooked with coconut, cumin, turmeric powder and chilli.Rohini Iyer penned the verses of Oru Kanji Paatu, sung by her daughter Rema Iyer | Photo Credit: Special arrangementMy mother has this habit of jotting down simple verses. Many of them are centred on food. When a childhood friend, Ganesha Kumble, a musician, came visiting, he wondered about the possibility of setting Ammas verse to music and bringing them out as a collection. The initial plan was to compose songs on recipes of favourites like sambar, recalls Rema.To begin with he recorded Rema singing the kanji song with a simple tune. They found that many children of Keralites settled abroad had no idea of what kanji was and so they decided to begin with Oru kanji paattu. The nicest thing about kanji is that it can be had as a simple meal with just some salt and a pickle or it can turned into a grand meal with many sides and roasted pappadam, Rema says.The verses celebrate consuming kanji with coconut milk and ghee; a wide range of puzhukku; coconut chutney; roasted pappadam; green gram and also a typical Malayali dish like astram, curd-based side made with colacasia.In December, 2020, playback singer and actor Chitra Iyer, Remas sister, came visiting to keep her company during her recuperation. When Ganesha dropped in with his teenaged daughter Amritavarshini, a budding pianist, they were stuck at Remas place in Kent as UK went into lockdown.Ganesha Kumble, Rema Iyer, Amrithavarshini Kumble, and Chitra Iyer during the shooting of the music video 'Oru Kanji Paatu', sung by Rema Iyer | Photo Credit: Special arrangementThat was when they thought of a video to accompany the song. A couple of lines in rap was added to enhance the song. Ganesha shot the video, did the post production and sent it to friend and musician Manoj Kumar Medalodan in Thiruvananthapuram. He jazzed it up, adding some special effects and the song featuring Rema, Chitra, Amrithavarshini and Ganesha was uploaded on YouTube on April 9.I did the entire music production. As the lockdown was in effect, we had to make do with whatever was there in Remas house. However, we did manage to buy a big slice of frozen jackfruit from the market nearby and had lots of kanji for the shoot, says Ganesha.Chitra and Amritavarshini lip synced for the video and though they wanted the settu-mundu for an authentic Malayali feel, they had to settle for a mundu, black shirts and a cotton dupatta. It was a lot of fun and never once did we feel that we were in lockdown. We had to come up with all kinds of jugaad to make it look interesting, laughs Chitra. Remas friends and colleagues also chipped in with videos shot on their phones.Kanji for the Malayali soul!",GREEN GRAM DAL (MOONG DAL)

In India, you might recognise it by one of its many local names, including panivaragu in Tamil, varigalu in Telugu, cheno in Gujarati, varai in Marathi, and barri in Hindi. Nutritious and versatile, panivaragu is a short season crop, which produces white, yellow, red, or black seeds.It is grown in several states, including Madhya Pradesh, eastern Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, and Karnataka. While the common uses of panivaragu are unfortunately often restricted to bird feed, it is, in fact, a diverse ingredient to be used in the kitchen in savoury and sweet dishes alike. One can make khichdi, idli, roti, and samosa, as well as barfi and payasam.Full of fibre, carbohydrates, proteins, fatty acids, and nutrients, panivaragu is a healthy addition to your daily diet. Panivaragu is high in fibre and contains B Complex vitamins (including niacin and thiamine) that are very rarely available naturally. The millet is also good for those with diabetes and people who want to lose weight, explains N Vijayashree, chief dietician at MGM Healthcare, Chennai. There are often wrong notions that you cannot eat panivaragu daily.According to my Ayurvedic doctors, you can consume the millet every day without any side effects. If someone is very new to millets, they can drink a cup of hot water to help with digestion. You must ensure to soak it for at least five hours, and then, grind and ferment it to be made into idli, dosa, etc, mentions Indra Narayan, a home cook (@indranarayan) and the author of ebook Millet Kitchen: The Simple Art of Millet Cooking. She further elaborates on the benefits of eating proso millet.Aids nervous systemThe presence of a complex compound in panivaragu called Lecithin is known to indirectly stimulate and ensure smooth functioning of the nervous system.Helps anti-ageingA daily portion of panivaragu can reduce the deficiency of niacin or vitamin B3 in the body, which will aid in skincare. A reliable source of antioxidants, the millet also helps in removing free radicals from the bodythat can contribute to ageing and other illnesses, including cancer and autoimmune diseases.A gluten-free solutionSince the millet is completely gluten-free, it is a great food source for those suffering from gluten intolerance or following a gluten-free diet. People with celiac disease an immune reactionto consuming gluten can use panivaragu as an alternative to millets such as wheat or rye.Regulates insulinPanivaragu contains a potent dose of magnesium, which helps to keep a check on glucose and control healthy insulin levels.Keeps cholesterol in checkThere is a phytochemical in panivaragu called the phytic acid that can reduce the level of bad cholesterol in the body.

After doing away with licensed imports, the central government has now directed state governments to verify stock held by millers, traders and others to rule out hoarding.Damaged crop and reduced per acre yield has seen pulses trading either at or above the government declared Minimum Support Price (MSP). Thus growers of urad and moong as well as tur had seen good realizations despite the increase in sown area.August rains had wreaked havoc in the moong and urad fields in states such as Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, while post October rains had destroyed the then growing crop of tur in Karnataka and Maharashtra. Similarly, rabbi chanas per acre yields have been low due to crop damage in parts of Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh.As a result of this supply-demand mismatch retail prices across the country have been on the higher side throughout the year. Retail prices of all pulses are between Rs 70-120/kg in most urban cities of the country. Given the increase in retail prices, the central government had intervened to cool down prices. The central government had increased the time limit for arrival of imported tur by a month, clashing with domestic stocks arriving in markets.

On May 22, the association sent a letter to the Prime Minister Narendra Modi pointing out the actions being taken might have short term effect and its long term effect could pose a threat to the progress made by the country in terms of self sufficiency achieved in pulses. Contrary to the popular perception, the letter said, moong and chana were trading below their MSP while urad and tur were selling above their MSP. The present price rise, the letter said, is short term and any action before monsoon sowing can see farmers turn to crops like sugarcane or soyabean in preference of pulses.Instead of knee-jerk reactions, the association has asked the government to use the buffer stock available with various government bodies like NAFED to cool down retail prices.",GREEN GRAM DAL (MOONG DAL)

The road to complete recovery from COVID-19 is tiring. Besides sleep and rest, eating healthy is an essential now to aid in healing.Good nutrition helps your battered body build up its energy levels as fast as possible, says Dr Kavitha Fenn Arunkumar, Madurai-based psychiatrist, referring not just to those who have suffered the sickness, but also those who have seen adversity through the pandemic. In fact, she recommends the intake of easy-to-digest food in frequent and small measures because the body and mind are both vulnerable and not in a condition to labour hard over three big elaborate meals.Dr Arunkumar receives three or four calls a day from those who have seen a COVID-19 death in their families and now during their own recuperation are finding it difficult to eat. The food we eat should be easy and comforting to chew and swallow, she says. She also cautions against emotional eating (feeding on convenience foods to satiate cravings). Its best to eat food that does not cause distress to the digestive system or any other part of the body, she says.Power up with nutrientsTo gain stamina and fight the weakness, Delhi-based nutritionist Shweta Gupta says it is important to power up with proteins as they help reverse tissue damage and stimulate the production of T-cells, the agents that promote healthy immune functioning.

Follow the 8 am- noon-4pm-8 pm or 9 am-1 pm-5 pm-9 pm schedule and control the portions, especially carbohydrates. Feed your hunger but never over-stuff, she says.Tips to follow at home: Avoid elaborate cooking and stick to simple recipes with more greens (Spinach, methi, sarson saag and other keerais) as they are known to lower anxiety levels.Make one or two vegetable chutneys and store, so that you can use them every day with rice or chapatis.Keep a jar of nuts and seeds by your side for easy snacking, They are potent sources of essential fatty acids such as Omega-3 and healthy fats that boost energy and promote healthy cholesterol levelsTaste and smell may take a while to return to normal making every bite of food utterly tasteless but it is important to keep up the appetite with small and frequent meals.The essential vitamins required during the period of healing are C and D. They help to prevent the body from oxidative damage and reduce inflammation. Stock yourself up with guavas, amla, kiwis, oranges and sweet lime for your lung healthSubhashree Ray, clinical and public health nutritionist in Mumbai, focusses on customised nutritional requirements of those with co-morbidities, particularly diabetes. Those with insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome need to be extra cautious of what is entering their body, she says and suggests complex carbohydrates such as whole grains and legumes for them. High fibre cereals and pulses like jawar, bajra, ragi, brown rice, oatmeal, millets, quinoa take longer to digest than simple carbs (refined grains like maida  often found in bread) and thereby keep the blood sugar from spiking, she adds. A staple cuisine of Bengal, the tetor dal (bitter lentil) made with the yellow split moong dal and karela (bitter gourd) is considered good.Nutrients-dense post-COVID recovery mealPasty khichdi with lots of vegetables; mashed dal or rasam with rice; curd rice; paneer or soya curry with two to three soft phulkas; green leafy and seasonal vegetables; steamed fish, egg and chicken (for non-vegetarians).Eat home-made balanced diet for the body to respond well and fast after infectionHealthy snacks:A bowl of salad or low-fat curd at room temperature, figs and dates, a spoonful of pumpkin, chia or flax seeds, boiled peanuts or chick peas, a fistful of nuts (including almonds, walnuts), sweet potato chaat or seasonal fruits.High hydration:Enough water, low salt lassi, coconut water, butter milk with a dash of cumin and mint, chaach, and fresh juice with seasonal fruits (without adding sugar), bael ka sharbat (it is high in fibre).Chicken or vegetable broth soupThe immunity boosters:You can make a variety of health drinks at home to improve your haemoglobin levels. Here are a few suggested by the nutritionists:Blend one small amla, half a carrot and apple each, one tomato, quarter of a boiled beetroot and half cup pomegranate; dilute it with little water to suit your taste.Kadha: To 300 ml boiling water add 10 basil (tulsi) leaves, four lightly crushed peppercorns, half inch grated ginger and one pinch cinnamon.

Our days now begin not with tea or coffee, but with a shot of this bitter-sour juice, with its final rush of sweetness, packed with nutrients and immunity boosters. But even before the coronavirus came calling, amla has been a vital ingredient in most Indian homes. It would be boiled with salt water, hing and turmeric, to make an oil-free pickle; ground and stirred into a thokku; grated and added to curd for a raita; or cooked with dal for a deeply-flavourful side dish. Amla has also been a part of native medicine, and its dried and candied versions have come in handy as digestives.Also read: How do you like your amla?

According to recent news reports, KoreaShop 24, which facilitates trade between India and the South Korean market, closed a deal for Nature Factory, a company based in Seoul, to export amla extract worth 85 lakh. With the growing demand for immunity-boosting Indian gooseberries in Korea, the order is expected to go up, based on the reception.Meanwhile, back home, as demand continues to grow, we take a nostalgia break with farmers, bloggers, writers and homemakers about their memories of the gooseberry.Anamika Singh | Photo Credit: Special ArrangementTea infusions in Dharamshala, Himachal PradeshAnamika Singh | Founder-director, Anandini Himalaya TeaWe lived in Darjeeling for 35 years and my earliest, fondest memories are of the Margarets Hope Tea Estate in Kurseong, where my father was, says Singh, 50. Bhansghadi was a bamboo grove with gorgeous orange and gooseberry trees. When my brother and I visited from boarding school, workers would bring bamboo baskets full of sweet-sour orange and fresh amla. It was exciting to bite into the amla and drink water. I still remember that sweetness.Hornbill Grandeur, a green tea with amla, wild apples and moringa | Photo Credit: Special ArrangementYears later, when she began making tea infusions as part of Anandini Himalaya Tea, an offshoot of her familys 160-year-old Manjhee Valley Tea Estate (which they have been running since 2003), Singh wanted to focus on things that she had a bond with  places and memories. I was fascinated by ingredients that triggered emotions. It could be a flower or something available for a small window of time. In 2015, the Nagaland government asked us to create a blend to gift dignitaries who visited the annual Hornbill festival. And so was born the Hornbill Grandeur, a green tea with amla, wild apples and moringa. Its a beautiful blend, very simple and subtle with a hint of sweetness, and its very healthy without being medicinal, she says. I am glad we did it. Gooseberry is becoming very popular now and no one usually associates it with tea, but its delicious.A tea taster, Singh also conducts tea tasting ceremonies.TR Sasi Varier | Photo Credit: Special ArrangementLanguage lessons in Tiruchirappalli, Tamil NaduTR Sasi Varier | Director, Ashtanga AyurvedicsI literally grew up on the factory floor, laughs Varier, 58. Ive been seeing amla [or nellika, as its called down South], both fresh and dry, since I was about seven, and I have a deep respect for it. He tells me that there are broadly two types of gooseberries: the country and the grafted variety. The former produces small fruits, as compared to the grafted ones such as Krishna, NA7 and BSR1  which grow to 10 ft in height. He has about 60 amla trees in his enterprises garden, five of which are native.He remembers hearing stories about how people would cut the trunk of the nellika tree and drop it into wells, to purify and sweeten the water. These would endlessly lie at the bottom. In fact, in Malayalam, there is a saying that references this: Kshamayude nellipadi kandu [meaning, Ive reached the end of my tether, Ive reached the nellika logs in the well, he says, to underline how integral the amla is to us in India.Puspanjalee Das Dutta | Photo Credit: Special ArrangementAmla with fish in Guwahati, AssamPuspanjalee Das Dutta | Food bloggerAmla is an integral part of life in the East. Growing up in Barpeta in Lower Assam, we had a 40-year-old tree at home that fruited liberally twice a year. My grandmother and mother would cook with the amla with fish, and make mukh suddhi with dried amla [much like a paan, and used as a mouth freshner]. Even now, my mother sends it across to me, annually. They also dry the amla and powder it for later use, and send it to those who lived in other cities, she says. Today, Dutta, 35, incorporates the fruit in her familys diet by adding it to a dal, so that its sharp flavour mellows down. I add it to moong or masoor, and temper it with cumin or fenugreek seeds. Its delicious and aromatic. Fish and mashed amla also make a good combination.Vikram and Shikha Bhargava | Photo Credit: Special ArrangementPickles and chutney in Paharapurwa, Madhya PradeshVikram Bhargava | The Little Farm CoWhen Bhargava, now 56, moved out of Delhi to buy a parcel of land near Khajuraho in Madhya Pradesh, his family wondered if he was making a mistake. It was a drought prone area. A horticulturist, however, gave him a list of trees that would thrive there. Today, over 2,000 amla trees dot the 400-acre, rain-fed farm. During a good season, each tree will yield about 250 kg. In 2019, I was told to sell the excess fruit. But I was offered 4 per kilogram during winter, and got 4,000 for a quintal! he recalls.So, last season, Bhargava introduced an amla-garlic chutney at Little Farm. This year, we launched pickles, which did very well. Now, Ive decided to launch one new amla product a year  sharbat, chyavanprash, amla candy, and the like.Also read: How do you like your amla? Try it in a salad or a bake | Talking beauty with amlaKrish Ashok | Photo Credit: Special ArrangementDissecting the fruit in Chennai, Tamil NaduKrish Ashok | Author of Masala LabThe gooseberry has a complex, savoury tartness that comes from its diversity of acids: malic, shikimic and citric. Depending on when it is plucked and the variety, the flavour profile can vary from sweet and tart, to astringent, explains Ashok, 44, who cooks with it extensively. It can be directly used as a souring agent, in much the same way as raw mango is used. Amla dal, for instance, is a fantastic way to use this fruit. Breaking down the science behind why water drunk after eating amla tastes sweet, he says, It is because of Vitamin C, which is water soluble. It is chemically very similar to glucose, and thus its solution tastes sweet to our taste buds. Since cooking tends to reduce some of its nutrition, Ashok suggests that a good way to enjoy the raw fruit is to lacto-ferment it. Let it sit in a 2% salt solution for two to three weeks, The lactobacteria will convert the sugars in the fruit to lactic acid, which has a much milder sourness. Fermentation also increases bioavailability of other nutrients such as iron, he says, adding that fermented amla works well in dishes, lending a complex sourness combined with the umami from the proteins broken down by the bacteria.Daljit Bindra | Photo Credit: Special ArrangementHouseproud in Faridabad, HaryanaDaljit Bindra | HomemakerAmla is the king of trees, Bindra, 85, says, adding that her 25-year-old tree at home is beloved and still fruits profusely.

I grew up listening to the story of the deer that ate an amla and drank water from a pond and told the other deer that the water from the pond was sweet.

But incessant rains and flood damaged our crops. Many farmers have lost their vegetable crops. All of us are in severe distress as there is no way we can return the bank loans, said Purnachandra Sahoo, a farmer of Taras village.Yaas also hit the economy of around 5,000 betel leaf growers of Kendrapara. A large number of betel vines have been ruined by Yaas.Had there been no cyclone, we would be busy harvesting paan now. Now, we are in a precarious situtation, said Ashok Sutar, a betel leaf farmer of Rangani.President of the district unit of Krushak Sabha Umesh Chandra Singh said the cyclone and resultant floods in the summer have dealt a crushing blow to the agricultural economy of the district by washing away standing crops. A large number of farmers fear more losses are in store for them if rainwater is not flushed out from their lands soon.Every year, farmers of the district face crop loss due to natural calamities and inclement weather. But they allege, the administration pays only lip service to their problems.Faulty agricultural policy of the government is the main reason behind the woes of cyclone-affected farmers. Since a concrete policy to insure agricultural lands is yet to be formulated, a large number of farmers are not covered by any insurance companies, Singh alleged.District emergency officer Sambeet Satpathy said all the cyclone-hit farmers will be provided loans from the government, cooperative banks and other financial organisations.

(Representational Photo)Balwinder Singh (50), a farmer of Tarewala village in Moga district, had grown summer moong on 35 acres this year with a hope of getting Rs 7,196 MSP announced by the Centre. On Tuesday, however, he sold his crop at the rate of Rs 6,000 to 6,200 per quintal, around 17 per cent to 14 per cent below the MSP fixed on the recommendation of Commission for Agriculture Cost and Price (CACP).As summer moong started reaching Punjab mandis a few days back, the price opened 10 to 17 per cent below MSP.After selling his crop, Balwinder said: I brought my crop to Jagraon mandi in Ludhiana district as it is one of the main markets for moong dal crop. It is auctioned with the help of arhtiyas and private players purchase it. Government has neither any role in procurement nor a control over its prices. We have to sell it as per market rate as we do not have any other optionAlso Read | For Punjab, pulses could hold key to breaking wheat-paddy cycleBalwinder grows summer moong (March to June), apart from paddy (June to October) and potato (October to March). He has around 60 acres of land.Another farmer, Avtar Singh, sold his moong crop at the rate of Rs 6,500 per quintal in Rayya mandi in Amritsar district. He said that private players are not ready to give farmers the MSP fixed by the government. Government must have some control on the MSP fixed by it, he said.In the retail market the rate of moong dal is Rs 110 per kg, which comes to Rs 11,100 per quintal.Moong cultivation provides farmers with an opportunity to have a third crop in a year. Moreover, moong being a leguminous crop is beneficial for the soil as it helps in nitrogen fixation and contributes to improving soil fertility. It is just a 65-day crop.President of Federation of Arhtiya Association Punjab, Vijay Kalra, said that the moong dal has started arriving in around half dozen markets of the state and the maximum rate is Rs 6,500 per quintal and minimum around Rs 6,000 per quintal, which may go up because it is just the beginning of the arrival of the crop in the mandis.Going by the economics of this crop, farmers can get 5-6 quintals moong per acre (12-15 quintals per hectare if the crop is bumper) which translates to Rs 35,980 to 43,176 per acre if they get the MSP of moong decided by the Centre (Rs 7,196 per quintal). But at the current market price, a farmer would be selling it at Rs 30,000 to Rs 36,000 per acre. While the input cost would be around Rs 8,000-9,000 per acre including seed, labour, and other expenditure. But if the farmer has taken the field on rent then he has to bear the rental cost of around Rs 18,000 per acre. (Annual rental cost of per acre is Rs 45,000 to 55,000 per acre in most part barring some districts of Malwa regions where annual rent is Rs 60,000 to 65,000 per acre. If a farmer is growing three crops he has to include 1/3rd rental cost per crop)Experts said that after deducting input cost and rental cost, he would be left with Rs 8,000 to 15,000 per acre if he sells crops at the fixed MSP, but at current market price, he would be getting Rs 3000 to Rs 9,000 per acre only. If a farmer has his own land then he can make a reasonable profit of Rs 21,000 to Rs 27,000 per acre.This expenditure does not include the family labour hours and when those are included, then the farmers will be at loss which means that not only the MSP should be increased as per the formula of M S Swaminathan commissions recommendation but also farmers should get the full MSP, said Jagmohan Singh, general secretary, BKU (Dakuanda).",GREEN GRAM DAL (MOONG DAL)

(Representational Photo)Amid apprehensions of shortage of pulses in the country in the pandemic year, agriculture experts in Punjab say that it was time for the state to focus on growing pulses again to help itself and the nation.In the 1960s, Punjab cultivated pulses on almost 54 times its present area under pulses. The state grows pulses during Kharif (June to October), Rabi (November to March) and summer (March to June) seasons. Moong and mash are grown in Kharif and summer seasons, while gram and masar are grown in Rabi season.According to Punjab Agriculture university (PAU), Ludhiana, in 1961-62, Punjab had 9.17 lakh hectares (22.65 lakh acres) area under pulses (both Kharif and Rabi), which was maximum in the history of the state. But now this area has reduced to merely 17,300 hectares (estimated) in 2019-20.In early 2000s, Punjab had ventured into growing summer pulses and had dedicated 78,000 hectares (over 1.92 lakh acres) area to it in 2010-11. This has now reduced to 22,700 hectares. The summer season pulses are not grown during the wheat and paddy season.Over the decades, major drop was noticed in the Rabi season pulses, which used to have a major area in the state in 1961-61 with 8.81 lakh hectares (96 per cent of the total pulses crops) that has now reduced to just 5,600 hectares (2019-20).Also, total production of the pulses was 7.26 lakh tonnes in 1960-61, which came down to around 16,500 tonnes (estimated) in 2019-20.In Punjab, Kharif season moong, mash and arhar used to be grown on 99,300 hectares till 1985-86, but now this area has reduced to 11,700 hectares. Arhar dal also used to have 42,500 hectares (1.04 lakh acres) area under it, which is now down to 4,700 hectares.Punjabs productivity of pulses is also more than the all india average as the state has 954 kg production of pulses per hectare against 826 kg nationwide production per hectare. This is the reason that experts believe that Punjab can play a major role to meet the pulses shortage.While area under pulses is Punjab was declining due to the wheat-paddy assured price cycle, Indias total area under pulses increased by 4.5 million hectares (around 45 lakh hectares) from early 1960s to 2019-20. Indians estimated area under pulses in 2019-20 was 27.87 million hectares against 23.56 million hectares in early 1960s. The countrys production has also almost doubled from 12.20 million tonnes in early 1960s to 23 million tonnes in 2019-20 (estimated).Punjab needs to increase area under pulses both Kharif and Rabbi pulses as it will break the wheat and paddy cycle, but for that government must support farmers to get the reasonable market price, said renowned economist Sardara Singh Johal.He added: Pulses and Kapas (raw cotton) can be one of the best alternatives to diversify area of paddy in Kharif season), while Rabi season pulses and oilseeds can be best alternative for diversifying area under wheat in Rabi season.As we need to bring down paddy (non-basmati) area close to 1.2 million (12 lakh hectares) from 2.7 million hectares currently and wheat area to 3 million hectares against the current 3.5 million hectares that means total decrease of around 2 million hecatres (20 lakh hectares). If Punjab goes back to its roots, when around one million hectares (96 per cent was under Rabi pulses), the state can achieve diversification, said a senior Agriculture Officer in Punjab government, adding that it is not an impossible task.Even the semi-hilly rain fed areas in Hoshiarpur, Pathankot, Gurdaspur, Nawanshahr, Ropar districts can adopt pulses and maize during Kharif as this will save huge amount of groundwater and make farmers come out of the wheat and paddy cycle, said the officer.Currently, Punjab needs around 6 lakh tonnes of pulses, but its own production is around 36,500 tonnes  including 16,500 tonnes of Kharif and Rabi pulses and 20,000 tonnes of summer pulses. This is only 6 per cent of the total consumption requirement of the state.Even by reviving our pulses area of 1960s and adding little more to it, Punjab will not only be able to become self-sufficient in the pulses production, but it will also serve the nation the way it has been serving in foodgrains for the past over 5 decades. Punjab can supply almost half million tonnes pulses to the national kitty after meetings its own need, said Jagmohan Singh, General Secretary, BKU (Dakuanda), adding that farmers have been demanding the MSP of all crops for fthe past six months while sitting at Delhi borders.",GREEN GRAM DAL (MOONG DAL)

We decided to collect data on these people from ration shops and gram panchayat offices where they would have registered under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee MGNREGA ). We have been able to cover more than three lakh people since. The pulse polio campaign experience has helped immensely.District malaria officer Dr Lakshmikanth, who is on the ground, admitted that he has had to taste the wrath of the public.A misinformation campaign did hinder the drive, but now it has changed. Earlier, we asked them to come to PHCs, but they refused. So, we went to their houses, but they locked up their houses. So now, we are going to their fields, he said.Dr Lakshmikanth added: This is the sowing season and they fear losing their earnings if they get fever or hand pain after receiving the jab.

On paper, food inflation, driven by costlier cooking oil and pulses, is being cited as a reason for this move but farmers are talking about erratic rainfall pattern, which can become problematic in the days to come.As of July 3, the country has reported a slender 4 per cent excess rainfall with India receiving 198.6 mm rainfall as against the normal 191.6 mm. The spatial distribution, however, paints a grim picture. While in the first two weeks of June, majority of the country reported large excess of rainfall, this soon changed. Most parts of the country went dry from the week ending June 16. The northern limit of the monsoon has not moved since June 16 and, thus, rainfall has been erratic.The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has ruled out any significant rainfall before the end of the first week of July.Read | Farmers plan to protest outside Parliament every day during Monsoon SessionWith erratic rain pattern, most farmers have stopped their sowing activities. Data as published by the department of agriculture and farmer welfare shows that till June 25, India has recorded sowing over 202.72 lakh hectares (lh) as compared to 258.62 lh last year. In states like Maharashtra, farmers have reported sowing over 55.42 lh as compared to 90.03 lh area last year.Across the country, crops like pulses, cotton and oilseeds have reported the greatest dip in sowing. Last year, oilseeds were sown over 36.65 lh, which has dipped to 23.64 lh this year; similarly pulses, which were sown over 17.51 lh in 2020, have been sown over 14.58 lh in 2021. Cotton growers in 2020 had raced ahead with sowing and, by June 25, sown the lint crop over 71.69 lh, but this year sowing has been reported over 37.14 lh. Sugarcane is perhaps the only major crop that has reported a year-on-year growth in sowing.In Maharashtra, till June 28, farmers have reported sowing of 8.36 lakh hectares of pulses with toor accounting for over 5.5 lakh hectares alone. This is a sharp dip from the 11.95 lakh hectares of sowing reported last year.In the major moong and urad growing state of Rajasthan, till July 6, farmers have sown 4.90 lakh hectares of moong and 34,050 hectares of urad. This is much higher than the 3.29 lakh hectares of moong and 16,100 hectares of urad the state reported last year. The state, however, is yet to receive good rain.The next few days are going to be crucial for most farmers because if it does not rain, they would have to go in for an alternative, especially for farmers who grow moong and urad as these short duration crops prepare the fields for commercial crops like sugarcane or banana. Also, in case of a delay in rainfall, these crops would just exhibit vegetative growth with little pod formation.In areas where farmers have completed their sowing, the absence of sufficient moisture during the growth phase has become a cause for concern. Pavan Toshniwal, a dal trader and miller operating out of Gulbarga taluka in Karnataka, said the main pulse growing zone of North Karnataka had reported a reasonable amount of sowing. Moong, urad sowing is over, but there are concerns over crop condition. If it rains later, farmers would have to abandon their crop as the fields would be too muddy to work, he said, adding that most farmers were waiting for a good spell before taking on the sowing of toor and other crops.",GREEN GRAM DAL (MOONG DAL)

As of Friday, monsoon was delayed over Delhi, Punjab, Chandigarh, Haryana and Western Rajasthan. At -58%, Delhi is one of the most deficient states this season.Normally farmers are advised not to sow groundnut, moong and urad if there is not enough soil moisture by July 15. Cotton sowing would be hit in case the rains continue to play truant till the end of July.However, 2021 does not mark the most delayed monsoon onset in the parts of the country still to see rains. In 2012, against its normal date of June 29, Delhi had seen rains arrive on July 7.Most previous monsoons between 2010 and 2020 also saw a similar break-phase between June fourth week and early July, though none lasted beyond 11 days. This time the break has stretched to close to three weeks. The monsoon of 2013 holds the record for seeing the fastest advance over the entire country  completed in 10 days  since 1941, the IMD said.However, as per the latest weather forecast, the monsoon is all set to revive as the easterly winds have started blowing along the lower levels from the Bay of Bengal. The monsoon is likely to advance into the remaining parts of West Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, Haryana, Chandigarh, Punjab and Rajasthan by July 10, the Met offices weather report of Friday morning read.",GREEN GRAM DAL (MOONG DAL)

Their demand is complete repeal of these legislations. According to them, the stockholding limits go against the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.Pulses are basic and essential food items in our country, but these have been excluded from the list of essential food items under the EC (Amendment) Act, said Jagmohan Singh Patiala, general secretary, Bharti Kisan Union (BKU) Ekta (Dakaunda). Farm unions have already pointed out that the new amended Act says that its purpose is enhancing income of farmers, but the Essential Commodities (EC) Act, 1955, was never about farmers or their incomes. It was about preventing agri-business companies and big traders  which have the means to stock farmers produce  from hoarding and then selling these at higher price at the time of shortage or by creating false shortage of such items, which are the basic requirement of every consumer, including the poor, he added.But new Act has removed all these restrictions and given a free hand to agri business companies or traders to hoard such food commodities. This is why farmers are calling it the Food Hoarding (Freedom for Corporates) Act, said Satnam Singh Sahni of Samyukat Kisan Morcha (SKM).Now when the government is imposing restrictions on stock limit to control the inflation of food commodities, it means that government itself wants to stop stockists from hoarding pulses and taking control of the market, said another farm leader of SKM, Balbir Singh Rajewal, adding that price rise in retail market never benefits farmers but stockists, and badly impacts consumers, particularly the poor. The government should realize this as soon as possible and repeal these laws, he added.How can the government exclude cereals, pulses, oilseed, onion, potato from the list of essential commodities, when hoarding of these would lead to inflation? If the government needs to issue such stockholding limits orders often, then what was the need to include such clauses in the amended Act? said Sukhdev Singh Kokrikalan, general secretary, BKU Ugrahan, adding that while the Act says that the government will regulate these commodities under extraordinary circumstances, prices are rising every coming day.The Department of Consumer Affairs (DCA) had last week issued an order to impose stockholding limits on all pulses, barring moong or green gram, for a period up to October 31, 2021. The limits have been fixed at 200 tonnes for wholesale traders and importers, and 5 tonnes for retailers. The stock limit for processors/dal millers has been set at the last three months production or 25 per cent of annual installed capacity, whichever is higher.Threat to food securityFarmers said this is a threat to food security. There used to be several regulatory tools with the government in the earlier ECA 1955  licensing, price control, compulsory licensing, stocking, information collection and production for inspection records, entry/search/examination of premises and seizure etc.  but all of this is being thrown away now under the new law, said Sahni.Not only is this Act is arbitrary but another farm law  the Contract Farming Act, 2020  promotes hoarding under its section -7, which says obligation related to stock limit shall not be applicable to such quantities of farming produce as are purchased under a farming agreement entered into in accordance with the provisions of this Act, said the All Indian Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee had said in its earlier statement sent to the Centre.Such a clause of the Contract farming Act is also arbitrary and it is again a proof of the governments hasty decision of bringing such laws and overlapping the provisions of one law with the other to complicate the matter for every one, said a farmer, adding that the government should shun its ego in the larger interest of the poor of this country as well as farmers and general consumers.The Essential Commodities Act, 2020",GREEN GRAM DAL (MOONG DAL)

WITH THE much-awaited revival of the monsoon, most parts of the country is reporting good rainfall from Sunday. Parts of Maharashtra have, in fact, reported very heavy rainfall, which has led to local administration evacuating people from low-lying areas. Farmers in most parts of the country are keeping their fingers crossed in the hope that good soil moisture will help them continue with their sowing operations.  Since Sunday, most parts of peninsular India started reporting rainfall. In Maharashtra, rain pounded parts of Marathwada and Vidarbha, which has come as a great relief to farmers in the area. The district of Parbhani has reported a cloud burst like situation with various parts reporting over 150 mm rainfall in a matter of few hours. District collector Deepak Muglikar said an irrigation canal was damaged, which led to flooding in low-lying areas. Close to 200 families were evacuated with ongoing relief work.  Rainfall data issued by India Meteorological Department states that the monsoon has progressed to the northern part of the country. As of Monday, the northern limit of the monsoon was passing Aligarh, Jaisalmer, Nagaur, Bharatpur, Karnal and Gangan-agar. The country, as a whole, has received 252.6 mm rainfall, as against the normal 270.9 mm. States like Gujarat (-40 per cent), Rajasthan (-30 per cent), Haryana (-41 per cent), Punjab (-38 per cent) have reported large deficit in rainfall. Only some states like Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Bihar have reported excess.  Given moisture stress, farmers have stopped their sowing activities. All major kharif crops have recorded lower sowing as compared to last year. Overall, when it comes to the crop situation, the statistical data of sowing across the country shows that till July 9, 499.87 lakh hectare area was under sowing as against 558.11 lakh hectare last year. Cotton (86.45 lh/104.83 lh) soybean (82.14 lh/92.36 lh), moong (11.92 lh/13.49 lh) are some crops that have reported a significant dip in sowing.

Managing the bodys immunity levels post-Covid through a nutritionist-recommended diet is necessary to keep other health complications away. This is especially important with the expectation of the third wave hitting us soon. Further, the use of steroids to recover from Covid can cause spikes in blood sugar levels for a few months and this needs to be managed with a diet and expert medical advice.  The recovery rate of Sars-Cov 2 patients has increased significantly. The data shared by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare indicates that more than 95 per cent of COVID-19 patients are recovering from the ailment. However, they are not free from the threat of other life-threatening diseases. While there is no substitute for medicines, managing diabetes is possible with diet regulation. It is important for people with diabetes to realign their diet plan after recovering from COVID-19. A balanced diet can help them heal quickly and stay protected from other infections, said Sujata Sharma, nutritionist & diabetes educator, BeatO.  Breakfast  Breakfast is an essential part of our diet, which should be taken within two hours of waking up, between 8:00-9:00 am. It reinvigorates our body with a fresh stream of energy by restoring glucose levels and reducing stress; hence, we must choose the components meticulously. A diabetes patient recovering from COVID-19 should choose from the following breakfast options: one bowl of oats with skimmed milk (adding berries and nuts is optional) or vegetable besan cheela or vegetable moong dal cheela or two pieces of multigrain dosa and one bowl of quinowa or boiled chana and moong chaat with vegetables or two egg white omelettes. Pairing any of these with buttermilk can complete the breakfast.  Mid-morning snack  The gap between breakfast and lunch must be covered with some nutritious snack (11:30 am). About 100 gm fruits (apple/ guava/ pear/ strawberries/ berries/ papaya/ watermelon) or nuts and seeds are most suitable for a mid-morning snack.  Lunch  As the day progresses, the body needs the energy to continue its functioning. A wholesome lunch fulfils these requirements while providing a break (between 1:30-2:30 pm). An ideal lunch should consist of one plate of salad, one bowl of green vegetable/dal or homemade chicken, low-fat curd or cucumber raita and multigrain chapatti (1-2) or one bowl of brown rice.  Evening snacks  As the day progresses towards dusk (4:30-5:30 pm), it is necessary to restore energy levels. This light snack can consist of tea without sugar/buttermilk or a handful of roasted makhana or chana or roasted/grilled/toasted paneer cubes or fruits 100 gm or chicken soup or multigrain biscuit or yoghurt with berries.  Dinner  Dinner is an important meal, one of the last food items that an individual eats. Ideally, dinner should be consumed between 7:30 to 8:30 pm and should consist of a plate of salad plus one bowl of green vegetable/paneer gravy/homemade chicken/fish gravy plus 50-100 gm of curd plus one bowl of moong dal khichdi/ vegetable oats khichdi or one to two slices of multigrain chapatti/jowar chapatti/bajra chapatti.  Post-dinner snack  The ideal post-dinner snack is a glass of skimmed/toned milk that can be taken if the individual feels hungry.  Following this diet plan, along with medication and physical exercises, can minimise the various health risks for diabetes patients recovering from COVID-19.",GREEN GRAM DAL (MOONG DAL)

Less than 15% of the beneficiaries have received the food kit with just 10 days left for the festival.  The Food and Civil Supplies Department, which had launched the State-wide programme on July 31, hoped to complete distribution among priority categories, chiefly Antodaya Anna Yojana (AAY) (yellow) and priority household (pink) card holders by August 7. However, the disbursal rate among such sections that came under the ambit of the National Food Security Act, 2013, remained poor. Only 10.54 lakh out of the 38.30 lakh beneficiaries in these categories have received the kits as on 1 p.m. on Tuesday.  Shortage of items  According to reliable sources, the shortage of cashew nuts, green gram cardamom has affected the distribution. While the Kerala State Civil Supplies Corporation (Supplyco), which has been tasked with preparing the kits, has been receiving sizeable stock of green gram and cardamom in the last few days, the failure to obtain cashew nuts in bulk has disrupted the distribution of kits among ration outlets.  However, Supplyco chairman and managing director P.M. Ali Asgar Pasha maintained that there was sufficient availability of all items required for the kits. He attributed the low distribution rate to the failure of the public to adhere to the days allotted for various categories. The drive usually picked up pace from the second week, he said.  In all, 11.24 lakh people out of the 90.96 lakh ration card holders in the State have been provided so far. The government had hoped to complete the distribution by August 16. Specific days had been allotted for each ration card categories in order to prevent crowding. Such plans have, however, gone kaput.  Public anger  All Kerala Retail Ration Dealers Association general secretary T. Muhammedali said the shortage of kits has led to the public venting their ire on ration dealers. The situation is expected to worsen with non-priority card holders beginning to seek their allocated kits. He urged the government to extend the deadline for the distribution drive.

But is it not just on the face, acne can occur anywhere on the body, including the back and chest. This type of acne, hence, is called body acne.  What are the causes?  According to ayurvedic practitioner Dr Shyam VL, body acne is caused by the same factors that trigger acne on the face: overactive oil glands, excess dead skin cells, and a proliferation of acne-causing bacteria. Additionally, it can also be a result of increased sweating and friction from clothing.  As the bacteria multiply in a clogged pore, the pore becomes inflamed. An acne cyst forms when inflammation reaches deep into the skin. Cysts can be very painful. People often see permanent scarring after this type of acne heals, he wrote on Instagram.

The younger generation requests a particular, rather popular, peppery brand and instantly the voice of a rabbit singing its name echoes in my head. Spouse and I settle for the equally famous Sindhi papad.  The Sindhi papad is unique. It is an amalgamated version of its Punjabi and Rajasthani cousins: it has the urad dal and pepper of the former, and the moong dal and jeera of the latter. Way back in the Sindh province, it was not just an accompaniment to meals, but served to guests on its own as a snack with water. To combat the extremes of climate, its salty flavour compensated for the loss of sodium from the body during sweaty summers while the jeera and pepper fought phlegm in severe winters. Its history is not all innocent. Apparently, prospective brides at one time would be asked to roast a papad over a direct flame to judge their culinary skills.  Scattered community  Partition proved tragic for Sindhis. Unlike the Punjabis, they had no home state to come to. They scattered all over the country and the globe and had to start from scratch as refugees, having been forced to leave all their property and wealth behind. My mother was 14 when her family fled to save their lives. She clearly remembered how the women in her family dipped gold coins in gram flour batter and fried them as pakoras to slip them undetected across the newly formed border. My paternal grandmother sold her thick gold bangle at a refugee camp in Bombay to buy butter and ghee: a far cry from her earlier days when even the vark on sweets was a thin sheet of beaten real gold.  As the business-based community struggled to make ends meet, many of its enterprising women made and sold papads and pickles to keep the kitchen fires burning. The Sindhi pickle is also unique, being oil-less, with carrots, small onions, cauliflower, and sometimes turnips, okra, dry dates and lotus stems, pickled in vinegar and spices.  I once asked my mother why we bought papads and didnt make them at home like many other families. She said that my father had once witnessed how tedious the procedure was and made her swear that she would never ever make them. However, I did get to try my hand at making papads in my in-laws place. But there was a problem. The papad dough was so tasty that I used to pop most of into my mouth, leaving very little to be rolled into papads. Years later, I was thrilled to find the finely kneaded dough of Sindhi papads being sold in Ahmedabad. The shopkeeper told me that it was mostly bought to be eaten as is than to be made into papad!  Often the butt of jokes for their love of papad, many Sindhis claim that it is their favourite chakhna with their daily peg or two. As for me, I relish my papads in this rainy weather  not fried in oil or roasted over a flame but cooked Sindhi style, over a hot tawa dabbed with a few drops of oil. I recall one of my mothers fondest memories. Her toothless grandmother would ask her to crush the papad into a fine powder between her palms so that she could enjoy it without hurting her gums. I often wonder if I too will be as addicted to it if I live to that ripe old age.  Sunday Recipe  Sindhi Papad  Photo: Wiki Commons  Ingredients  1 kg urad dal  1/4 kg moong dal  150 gm chaaniyo (papad khar/soda)  available in Sindhi grocery stores  3 tbsp peppercorns (coarsely ground)  3 tbsp cumin seeds  1/4 tsp cooking soda  1/2 tsp asafoetida  Salt to taste  Method  1.

It rained well in the first half of June. But we were advised on DD Kisan channel not to sow, as those rains were due to the Cyclone (Yaas) and wouldnt last, says this farmer from Nanhegaon village of Madhya Pradeshs Narsinghpur district. The strong rains on July 12-13 were followed by rimjhim baarish (intermittent showers) throughout July.  However, August has been poora sookha (totally dry). If it doesnt rain in the next seven days, my soyabean crop (which has completed flowering and is in early pod formation stage) will fail, fears Lodhi, who sowed moong (green gram) in his balance 4 acres on August 15. The maturity period for soyabean is 90-94 days and moong about 75 days.  Lodhis worry encapsulates the situation for Indias kharif (monsoon) season crop. An extended dry spell from around June 20 to July 11 resulted in farmers missing the main kharif sowing window between mid-June and mid-July. The monsoons revival, though, led to brisk plantings. By July 30, the cumulative area under kharif crops, at 848.15 lakh hectares (lh), was only 4.7% lower compared to the 889.99 lh during the corresponding period of 2020.

On Saturday, Ughreja participated in a rally of farmers from 14 villages of Morbis Maliya taluka, demanding release of water into the Maliya Branch Canal of the Narmada dam project.  Gujarat, unlike most other states, recorded deficient rainfall even during July. We had a good spell in June. But it has hardly rained in the last 72 days, barring a light drizzle early this month. If there are no rains or no release of Narmada water now, our crops will completely wilt, Ughreja told The Indian Express over phone.  Water from the Sardar Sarovar Dam irrigates some parts of Saurashtra (Morbi, Surendranagar, Botad and Bhavnagar districts) and Kutch (Rapar, Bhachau and Anjar talukas). But given the poor rainfall in the Narmada catchment areas, the Gujarat government has decided to prioritise supplies for drinking water over irrigation.  High prices for crops  especially soyabean and also groundnut and cotton  had made farmers keen to take up sowing this time. Kapas (raw un-ginned cotton) and groundnut are trading at Rs 7,000 per quintal levels each, way above their respective government-declared minimum support price of Rs 5,726 and Rs 5,500. Its even better in soyabean, which is quoting at Rs 6,700-7,400 per quintal at Narsinghpurs Kareli wholesale mandi, as against the MSP of Rs 3,950.  What use are these prices if there isnt any crop to harvest?, quips Lodhi. The same sentiment is shared by Ughreja. He had sown soyabean for the first time after his groundnut crop suffered damage for two consecutive years  from excessive rains. I took soyabean because the price was excellent and it can also tolerate excess rains better than groundnut. But my experiment looks like failing, he admits.",GREEN GRAM DAL (MOONG DAL)

Ingredients that I never find when I need them materialise like Banquos ghost in Macbeth, but with happier consequences. On one recent cleaning effort I chanced upon a packet of kalkandu or mishri, rock sugar. It transported me back to childhood when temple visits were often rewarded with crinkly yellow-cellophane wrapped treasures of khajoor (dry dates), mishri, raisins and cashew. They stayed fresh for a long time, though I did not usually put them to the test. The thought of rolling around an oversized chunk of rock sugar in my mouth till it dissolved brought so much joy.  Kalkandu is apparently a favourite of the gods too. In my 2019 travels across India exploring sacred food offerings, I learnt of a delicious sounding naivedyam using kalkandu in several ancient temples in Tamil Nadu. I particularly remember an early morning visit to Thillai Kali Amman Kovil, a Shakti Peetham located a short distance from the famous Chidambaram Nataraja temple. Legend speaks of the celestial dance competition between Shiva and Kali, where the goddess is defeated and banished from Thillai to where the Kali Amman temple is now located.  After my darshan of the goddess, the gurukkal (priest) gave me a donnai or leaf bowl filled with steaming hot kalkandu sakkarai pongal. This is a concoction of rice, passi paruppu (moong dal), rock sugar and ghee, garnished with plump fried raisins and fragrant with saffron, cardamom and pachchai karpooram (edible camphor). Kalkandu sakkarai pongal is better known as a signature item in the naivedyam of the Chidambaram temple.  Kongu cuisine  I first tasted this flavourful sweet while staying with my friend, Mangalam, during the Pongal/ Sankranti festival. Her home town, like mine, is Coimbatore, once part of the ancient Kongu Nadu region. Kalkandu pongal is a popular item in this regions cuisine. Mangalams mother prepared a different pongal for each day of the festival: the usual jaggery-based sakkarai pongal with rice and lentils, millet pongal with karuppatti (palm jaggery), savoury ven pongal, and my favourite, kalkandu sakkarai pongal, with brown rock sugar. I was happy that she did not add edible camphor: though reminiscent of temple prasadam, camphor, if not used judiciously, can overwhelm all other flavours and ruin the dish.  Several variations are possible in the preparation of kalkandu pongal. Kalkandu sadam, for instance, has rice (no lentils) cooked in milk. Powdered rock sugar is added, followed by saffron, cardamom and a garnish of ghee-fried raisins and cashew. Alternatively, rice may be cooked in water and milk added (or not) later. Kalkandu may be powdered, melted into a thin syrup, or used as is. While saffron and cardamom are standard ingredients, nutmeg may or may not be included.  Unique flavours  In the southern States, sakkarai pongal, with rice, moong dal, milk and jaggery, is a popular preparation for bhog/ naivedya in homes and temples. Rich with ghee and studded with fried cashew and raisins, it is an all-time favourite, and kalkandu sakkarai pongal is an interesting alternative, with rock sugar, saffron, cardamom and nutmeg each contributing their unique flavour.  The packet of rock sugar in my kitchen brought instant memories of this delectable dish and I put it to good use in a recipe broadly similar to the one used in the Chidambaram temple.  I use my grandmothers vengala paanai or bronze pot to make the pongal. It is heavy-bottomed and allows the dish to slow-cook on low heat. Alternatively, rice and dal may be pressure-cooked and other ingredients added (as in the recipe below). In this recipe, kalkandu may be powdered. However, when the crystal chunks are allowed to dissolve gradually in cooked rice it brings a special flavour. Stirring the saffron gently into the pongal helps it infuse the rice with its aroma and colour, giving the sakkarai pongal its classic pale yellow hue.  Chidambaram temple Kalkandu Sakkarai Pongal  Ingredients  Rice  cup  Passi paruppu/ split moong - 2 tablespoons  Kalkandu/mishri - 3/4 cup  Salt - 1 pinch  Saffron - 4-5 strands  Ghee - 1 teaspoon + 2 tablespoons  Cardamom - powdered 1 pinch  Nutmeg - powdered 1 pinch  Cashew, raisins - a few  Method  1. Soak rice and dal separately for 20 minutes. Drain.  2. Roast dal in 1 teaspoon of ghee. Add rice, roast for 2 minutes.  3. Cook rice and dal till soft. Mash well while hot.  4. Add kalkandu. Let it dissolve (about 10 minutes on low heat). Stir frequently.  5. Add salt, stir.  6. Add saffron, stir for 2 minutes.  7. Add cardamom, nutmeg. Stir.  8. Fry cashew and raisins in ghee. Add them (with ghee) to pongal.  The author is a chartered accountant, and author of Bhog Naivedya: Food Offerings to the Gods.",GREEN GRAM DAL (MOONG DAL)

While occasional cheat-meals are okay, one must also learn to consciously stay away from foods that can harm their health and lead to lifelong issues.  As we await Diwali, Minal Shah, senior nutrition therapist, Fortis Hospital, Mulund shares some pointers on how one can enjoy the festival of lights, keep their taste buds happy and also not compromise on health.  ALSO READ | This festive season, balance your cravings with these simple tips  Here are a few pointers for enjoying guilt-free desserts:  1. Choose a milk-based dessert like shrikhand, sandesh, mishit doi, kheer, etc. Milk is a good source of first-class protein, and these desserts can easily be made at home with any modifications that we desire.  2. Sugar can be replaced with natural flavoring agents like cinnamon, nutmeg, dry fruits like dates, raisins, and fresh fruits. To an extent, jaggery and honey can also be opted over refined sugar, but with quantity restriction.  3. Make a healthier choice among existing desserts.   Choose badam katli (omega-3 fatty acids) over kaju katli.   Choose besan ladoo (protein) or peanut ladoo (MUFA) over rava ladoo, Mysore pak (protein) over coconut ladoo.   Choose carrot halwa or dudhi halwa (antioxidants/vitamins) or moong dal sheera (protein) over rava sheera.   Choose payasam over a regular rice kheer.  4. Try something new and unconventional with a functional food added to it. Like dates sesame ladoo, oats dates nut ladoo, walnut ladoo, methi kheer, dudhi kheer, apple sheera, fruit kheer, papaya halwa, beetroot halwa, carrot kalakand, oats pancakes with cranberry syrup or blueberry syrup or chocolate syrup, homemade protein bars, apple pie, pumpkin pie, fruit yogurt, seeds chikki (pumpkin/sunflower/flaxseed).  5. Consider the portion size. There may be desserts which are high in fats like jalebi, malpua, gulab jamun, gulpapdi, sheera etc. If its your favourite, reduce the portion size. Cut smaller pieces to reduce the calorie intake.  6. Also, remember the basics  add a good bowl of salad with different coloured vegetables and fruits to ensure healthy fibre in every meal.  7. Add fillers for yourself and your guests, which are low in calories and tasty as well like ginger lemonade, virgin pina colada, kiwi margarita, masala milk, thandai, milkshake with fennel seeds, falooda, cucumber mint cooler, tomato mocktail, etc.   For more lifestyle news, follow us on Instagram | Twitter | Facebook and dont miss out on the latest updates!",GREEN GRAM DAL (MOONG DAL)

This year, the auspicious occasion falls on November 2, 2021.  It is believed that on this day, the Goddess of Wealth, Lakshmi, had emerged from the ocean during the churning of milk. Hence, Lakshmi and Kubera  the God of Wealth  are worshipped on this day. However, Lakshmi puja performed on amavasya  two days after Dhantrayodashi  is considered more significant.  ALSO READ | This Diwali season, incorporate these healthy eating habits  This day is deemed highly auspicious to invest in gold and silver, and buy utensils for ones home, too. According to mythology, King Himas 16-year-old son was to die on the fourth night of his marriage as a result of snake bite. To save his life, his wife collected all her gold ornaments and gold coins in a heap. She then sang songs and narrated stories to her husband so he doesnt fall asleep. When Yamaraj, the god of death, came in the form of a serpent to take the princes life, he was blinded by the shine of the gold and sat enchanted listening to the melodious music and stories.  Since then, in a tradition called Yamadeepdan, people light diyas on this day throughout the night to worship Yamaraj and ward off evil.  According to drikpanchang.com, Dhanteras puja muhurat is from 06.17 pm to 08.11 pm on November 2, 2021.  Lakshmi puja on Dhanteras is ideally done during pradosh kaal that lasts for two hours and 24 minutes. It is believed that during this time, the sthir lagna prevails, which means the time is auspicious and the Goddess is likely to stay in your house, as per drikpanchang.com.  The puja preparations entail keeping a red cloth on the right hand side of a raised platform, and installing idols of Lakshmi and Ganesha on it. The idols must be decorated with fine clothes. Next, a white cloth should be placed on the left hand side of the platform for installing the Navgraha gods.  Cereals including wheat, urad dal, moong dal, gram, barley and masoor dal are used along with marigold flowers while performing puja. Small footprints using vermillion and rice flour are made on the entrances to show the joyous arrival of the long-awaited Lakshmi.  In addition, they draw intricate rangoli designs at the entrances of workplaces and houses to welcome the goddess. Traditional sweets, called naivedyam made by mixing dry coriander seeds with jaggery, cows milk and saffron are prepared on this day.

It had only been a couple of weeks since Bikanervala, the Delhi-headquartered sweets brand, established its first store in the city on College Road in Nungambakkam  right in time for the Deepavali celebrations  and loyal customers of the brand were still trickling in, consistently.  The century-old brand has already brought its recipes of sweets, snacks, chaat, and food to multiple states  Rajasthan, Delhi, Madya Pradesh, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Haryana, Uttarakhand and more  as well as many other countries, including Nepal, UAE, United States of America, New Zealand and Singapore.  After setting up the Hyderabad branch, this is their second attempt to bring North Indian specialities to the South Indian market. With the aid of the festival time, the brand has welcomed a warm response, as expected according to a staff member. The overall response was exactly how we had hoped. Chennai already has a lot of South Indian food but they were seeking North Indian options. We hope the guests here are satisfied with quality food and proper service, he says, adding that the standard operating procedures and recipes remain the same across all Bikarnervala establishments.  We interspersed our conversation with some raj kachori and bhalla papdi that  though missing the typical north Indian flavour-packed punch  were well-balanced with the savouriness of the puri and filling (kachori) and bhalla, and the sweet, sour and spicy of the chutneys playing with the cold dahi (yogurt). The starters were followed by the tandoori platter and South Indian platter. I must be honest, serving a South Indian platter in Chennai as a north Indian brand was a bold choice. But according to the store manager, this was a deliberate one.  The South Indian platter has a different taste from what is available here. You get a North Indian taste of it instead, he says. He wasnt wrong. The chole bhature and some ras malai were the finishers. While the meal did not wow, it also did not disappoint. However, those comparing to the authentic North Indian flavours may be in for an underwhelming performance.  For the meal, we were seated on the first floor. The store was adequately staffed for the day, especially with the Deepavali festivities setting the fiesta feast mood. This, however, was not the case when another Chennai resident, Radhika Madhavan, visited during the pre-Deepavali weekend. We liked their Hyderabad outlet and so, we were looking forward to this branch. Unfortunately, there was only one person handling the crowd and it soon became evident that he was giving preferential treatment to those who had come to Chennai from north India. Furthermore, there were many options but only a few available. But, the portions and snacks are good, she shares.  The store is focusing on retail sales. Those who come for lunch and dinner often also indulge in their sweets and snacks, mentions an employee. It offers 400-500 varieties of sweets, including kaju katli, moong dal ka halwa, boondi ke ladoo, rasgulla etc. and can also customise some on request.

There is a huge tailwind for plant-based meats in India, says Abhishek Sinha, CEO, GoodDot, a plant-based meat company from Udaipur that introduced UnMutton Keema on World Vegan Day, November 1. It took his company nearly three-and-a-half years to develop the product and the R&D team is in the final stages of launching plant-based scrambled eggs, omelette, fish fingers and shrimp cutlets.  Similarly, to commemorate the day dedicated to veganism, Chirag Kenia, founder, Urban Platter, a platform for all gourmet and culinary requirements, in Bengaluru, too introduced meatless plant-based burger patties. He says, The plant-based market in India is hungry for diverse options, especially in protein alternatives and were just getting started.  Last month, Imagine Meats founded by Bollywood actors Riteish and Genelia Deshmukh, launched a range of nine plant-based products, which include keema, seekh kebabs, nuggets and sausages, as well as full meals like Afghan and Chettinad biriyani.  Also Read | India leans into better vegan options, seeing a rise in home grown mock meats, dairy-free cheese and desserts  A year old in this space, Mumbai-based Blue Tribe Foods too introduced a range of look like, feel like, smell like, and taste like plant-derived chicken nuggets and sausages. The market is getting innovative with products such as legume-based liquid egg, by Kartik Dixit and Shraddha Bhansalis Evo Foods in Mumbai.  A love for animals, the impact of the meat industry on environment and a conscious move to eat healthy, combine to power this trend globally and the focus of innovation in food is shifting to Asia, say industry watchers.  Kartik stresses on the fact that the egg similitude is made completely from Indian legumes like chickpea, moong and peas, adding that nutrition is their focus. He says a plant-based egg has 11 grams of protein and is at par with an organic egg that has protein, anywhere, between 10 to 12 grams. A 500 millilitre bottle of liquid egg is equivalent to 10 or 11 eggs. Trials are on to make the product more baking friendly, he adds.  Kartik turned vegan five years ago and believes that if the pandemic made people realise the damage from animal agriculture to the environment, it also made them think of rearing animals in coops and closely, of zoonotic transmissions, antibiotic resistance and maladies that can wipe out our race itself.  New developments  Chirag estimates a 15% increase in Flexitarians  people who are vegetarian, non-vegetarian and vegan  to experiment with and opt for more plant-based alternatives. After he turned vegan four years ago, he added more plant-based options to his diet. According to him the pandemic gave people the time to consciously think about their diet and e-commerce made it possible to deliver these curated foods to homes.  Abhishek agrees, pointing to a massive jump in awareness in the last one year: It has skyrocketed, almost a 500 to 800 % increase.  A non-vegetarian, Abhisheks interest in the field arose from his love for animals. While he was doing his engineering in 2003, he came across a study titled In Vitro Meat, by three Dutch inventors  Willem Van Eelen, Willem Van Kooten and Wiete Westerhof  on cultured meat created from tissue. It fascinated me and set me thinking, we could make meat using plant tissue; this was the perfect solution for a person like me, who enjoys eating meat but does not want to hurt or kill an animal, says Abhishek. He founded the company in 2016 with his friend Deepak Parihar.  Sohil Wazir, CCO, Blue Tribe, believes that this trend is driven by two factors: Anti-cruelty movement towards animals and the growing awareness of the high carbon footprint of the meat industry. About 2-3% of the population is aware of the implications of the meat industry on the environment, he says. Animal agriculture contributes to the second largest carbon emissions after fossil fuels.  Genelia discloses a defining moment in her familys turn towards a plant-based diet, recalling a remark that was casually made by her son: We cant have a pet dog and eat chicken at the same time. It hit me so hard, she says adding that Riteish, a meat lover, too wanted to have guilt-free meat.  Overcoming hurdles  Development of plant-based meats is the biggest challenge for the industry that works closely with food and material scientists, chefs, and investors. Abhishek adds that the second biggest challenge is creating awareness of the product but the pandemic has helped in this.  Protein extracted from plants is converted into meat analogue by a process of denaturation where protein linkages are altered using heat and pressure. It is then realigned to match the structure of meat.  It took nine months for Chirag and his brother Dhaval, who set up Urban Platter as an e-commerce platform in 2015, to develop the burger from textured soy proteins. Currently working on developing vegan mayonnaise and butter, the company sources almost 90% of the ingredients locally.  Whats cooking?  Working in the labs of Blue Tribe, chef Nirvaan Thacker who partners QSR, Zaatar and Mozza in Mumbai speaks of the challenges of cooking with mock meats.  Pea and soy are fundamentally different; the meat tends to react differently when used in a Bolognaise sauce or in a lighter preparation like broth. We are working towards addressing these factors, says Nirvaan. He adds that the speed of development of the ingredients has increased in the last six months and that with every trial, he is able to better the product. By Christmas, he says, they could easily move from working with mince to larger chunks of meats, a chicken roast perhaps.  Transitioning to a vegan lifestyle, Pune-based Raina Joseph tried plant-based keema with parathas. She says, Despite being a non-vegetarian, I could not differentiate between meat keema and the UnMutton keema. The texture was chewy, stretchy, the way meat is supposed to be. The spice and heat level too were appropriate. I found it awesome.  About 40 people who attended the tasting of legume-based eggs at Candy & Green at Breach Candy in Mumbai were floored by the experience and Nirulas in New Delhi has begun serving burgers made from plant-based mince.  Kartik says that he gets angry messages on social media asking for the product to be launched soon. We will be there before the year ends, he says.  With much buzz in this new field of food innovation, 2021 may go down as a year that launched the maximum number of plant-derived meat products.",GREEN GRAM DAL (MOONG DAL)

And he believes you should too.  A professor of Economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Abhijit Banerjee, shared the 2019 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences with Esther Duflo and Michael Kemer for their experimental approach to alleviating global poverty. (Esther, also an MIT economist, is married to Abhijit.)  (Stay up to date on new book releases, reviews, and more with The Hindu On Books newsletter. Subscribe here.)  His latest project, a whimsical cookbook titled Cooking to Save Your Life (published by Juggernaut) is punctuated with humour and exuberant drawings by Cheyenne Olivier. It seems like a dramatic departure from his work as an economist and social scientist. He does not think so.  In an interview from Delhi  he and Cheyenne are cooking up imaginative multi-course meals in India as part of the book tour  Abhijit explains how the book is connected to his work as an economist. We are exploring the social dimension of cooking. I thought it would be boring to just write recipes, to be honest. I wanted to spice it up for myself. So every chapter has an introduction, which is more social science...  The book introduces dishes tailored for specific occasions  from raspberry ceviche for when you invite the boss home to masala chips, tossed with minced onions, green chillies and chaat masala, for the kind of enemy you have to invite home from time to time. Abhijit adds,  You are cooking for a reason: because you have someone you want to impress, or someone you are scared of...  The book cover | Photo Credit: special arrangement  In an age of restaurant dinners and takeaway, he is hoping to convince readers, especially kitchen novices, to discover the satisfaction of creating delicious meals for friends and family. I cook every single day, he says, We dont really go out. We just eat at home. It is my relaxation when I return from work. Describing their weekly menus, he says, We get back from work by about 6.30 pm, then I start cooking. Three days a week, I make Indian food, a vegetable, dal and meat. Otherwise its pasta, some soup and salad, or Asian food, like stir fries.  Abhijit started cooking when he was about 15 years old, in Kolkata. My mother would often travel on work, and then the choice was between the cook, who was very nice and competent but unwilling to experiment, or me making different things.  When he took over the kitchen, the dining table was laid with lots of roasts, cakes and pastries. Some learnt from watching my mother, some from recipe books.  Decades later, he has developed a fresh appreciation for simple Indian food. I consider dal to be Indias greatest contribution yet to human civilisation. Ahead of chess and zero... often also the tastiest dish in a meal, a tribute to the creativity of a billion cash-strapped cooks, he says in the book, giving the recipe for his favourite comfort food, Bengali mung dal spiked with lemon.  Cooking amidst chaos  The recipes are charming and irreverent, a collection of tweaked classics and innovative staples, focussing on practical ways to get impressive results, in the midst of the chaos of everyday life. Cheyenne, who was Abhijit and Esthers au pair and lived with the couple for three years, chuckles about how cooking on the book tour was simple in comparison to their meals at home. Most of the time we do the cooking between giving the kids a bath, answering calls...This was easy. We actually had way too much time!  Her illustrations are deliberately light, playful and accessible. Photographs are too idealistic. The reality is you are coming home from work, the kids are around, you are tired... you are cooking in the middle of all that, she says.  Cheyenne Olivier | Photo Credit: special arrangement  The recipes are cleverly constructed, using everyday as well as exotic ingredients and simple techniques. Charred avocados with tahini and pomegranate molasses for instance. Or Ambur biryani, which the book promises takes less than 40 minutes to assemble, with a pressure cooker. And that pandemic staple, made in Abhijits home almost once a week: banana bread, but with almond flour.  We were in France, in Provence though the pandemic, and there was nothing much to do. Though most things were closed, the vegetable markets, butchers and fish mongers were open. We took advantage of that, says Abhijit. Cheyenne adds, It cheered us up through the pandemic.  Abhijit has a lot more recipes up his sleeve, but is non-committal about writing a sequel, because, this book is not just about the recipes. It is the whole structure around it that makes it a book. Putting down recipes is easy, the hard part is to think of the arc...",GREEN GRAM DAL (MOONG DAL)

Revel in their familiar rhythm again over filter coffee and pizza idlis  Sri Sasthalaya Catering, Narada Gana Sabha  After two years, catering contractor Ramesh Krishnan and his team are back: and they are determined to make it a memorable Margazhi. Sri Sasthalaya Catering, who have been running sabha canteens for seven years, will be serving an elaborate lunch at the venue for the first time.  We have been granted permission to serve ela sappad (a traditional lunch on a banana leaf), says Ramesh Krishnan, the proprietor. He adds, We usually serve mini lunch on plates, but this year we are looking forward to serving a freshly made, authentic kalyana sappad (wedding style lunch). The menu will be diverse, with different types of rasam, sambar, vetha kulambu and moru kulambu. There will be a variety of thogayal (lentil based chutnies) and payasams everyday.  He promises that the menus will be non-repetitive, with mavadu (tender mango pickle) and veppalakatti (a traditional dry pickle made with lime leaves) readied exclusively for the meals.  Starting from 6am, the canteen will serve piping hot Chettinad specials such as vella appam, kuzhi paniyaram, appam and idiyappam. They are also launching pizza idlis: idlis steamed in circular plates, topped with mixed vegetables and loaded with cheese. Still in a Mc Sabha frame of mind? Try their cheese idlis as well.  Of course all idlis, even the ones with American accents, must come with chutney and coffee. We are serving ginger chutney, tomato kara chutney, Kumbakonam kadappa (a regional speciality made with moong dal, coconut, spices and mixed vegetables) and Chettinad masala kulambu (an aromatic gravy with vegetables, made with freshly ground coconut and spices), says Ramesh.  As for dessert, as always he says their khoa jangri is what steals the show year after year. Pricing is deliberately competitive. Sabha canteens are an opportunity for caterers like us to find new customers that may bring in business for the rest of the year, says Ramesh. Therefore my focus is to impress the customers with our food, and definitely not profit.  Dont forget to try the coffee, the kiosk is always a major crowd puller here.We source high quality coffee beans from a single estate in Coorg and cows milk from local suppliers, says Ramesh. We start serving coffee as early as 5am.  Although this has been a year of takeaway, Ramesh is determined to keep the experience personal, and packaging free: We want rasikas to come to the venue, enjoy the fresh, hot meal served on the banana leaf and experience authentic Chennai hospitality. Therefore we will not be offering take away.  @Narada Gana Sabha, TTK Road, Alwarpet. The canteen will run December 17 to January 5, from 6am to 10pm everyday.  Call 9500028384.  Sastha Catering Services, Mylapore Fine Arts Club  Last year, RK Venkatesan ran the sabha canteen despite the pandemic, even though there were no music events or concerts. And though people were nervous about crowds, it was comforting to experience at least one familiar note in a tensely unpredictable year.  This year they have started a week ahead of the season due to an overwhelming demand from customers. People are now confident of leaving their homes and heading to the canteen, says RK Venkatesan adding, On day one (December 10) we served 300 lunches, which was rather overwhelming.  Sastha serves a typical South Indian wedding feast on a banana leaf (400 per head). In a wedding feast we normally serve a set menu such as potato roast, aviyal and usili. But I am trying to bring in more variety, says Venkatesan. For example, he says, they serve poosanikka pulippu kootu, chow chow rasavangi (a thick gravy made with coconut, spices, with brinjal or chowchow) and other traditional home style dishes. The focus is on using less oil and spices, he adds.  This is the fifth year that the caterer is running a sabha canteen during the music season.  For breakfast, while there are the traditional ghee dosas, to keep things interesting, Sastha also serves pineapple dosa, beetroot dosa and spinach dosa. If you drop by in the evening, look out for their popular crisp vethala (betel leaf) bajji, Manglore bondas and paani puri.  For the New Year, we will be serving a special lunch (500) where one can taste special items from Andhra, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Karnataka, says Venkatesh.  Kumbakonam degree coffee is available through the day and is served in a brass davara set. Another novelty this year is a counter selling sweets and savouries. The caterer is known for his elaneer payasam, sapota kesari and Asoka halwa.  @Mylapore Fine Arts Club, Mylapore. The canteen will run till January 2, from 6am to 10pm. Call 8925361555. Food is also being delivered through Dunzo and Swiggy.  Mountbatten Mani, Hemamalini Kalyana Mandapam  Legendary cook and caterer, Mountbatten Mani, a trendsetter in the sabha canteen scene, turned 90 last month. His son K Srinivasan who runs the Mountbatten Mani Catering Services, catered at Sri Parthasarathy Swamy Sabha, popular for its elaborate sit down lunches, for a decade. Then, last year the pandemic halted most of the citys Margazhi traditions, including their canteen.  Srinivasan has decided to try a new format this year by organising a Margazhi Food Festival at the Hemamalini Kalyana Mandapam. We are running the canteen as a separate entity at the wedding hall this year, he says, adding This probably is the first time that a canteen is functioning without any concert or under the aegis of any sabha. I am organising such a canteen only for sake of my loyal customers, as they look forward to our elaborate meals every year during the December Season.  His team specialises in traditional vegetarian meals, as well as snacks and tiffin. I try to bring into the menu, what we normally may not find in the restaurant. For example, paal kozhukattai, vella paniyaram and badam halwa, which is my fathers secret recipe, says Srinivasan. The kalyana virundhu we serve has no onion, no garlic (525 per person) and we generally avoid root vegetables during the weekends, he says, adding that Most of us did not get to attend many weddings during the pandemic, so it is a chance to celebrate familiar flavours. Also, these Margazhi canteens break the monotony of life.  @Hemamalini Kalyana Mandapam, Lloyds Road, Royapettah. The canteen will run from December 22 till January 4, from noon to 10pm. Breakfast will be served only during weekends. Call 9840024400. Food delivery via Dunzo.",GREEN GRAM DAL (MOONG DAL)

In its order, SEBI asked stock exchanges in commodity derivatives segment to not to undertake any trading in derivative contracts in these key farm commodities with immediate effect.  No new contract shall be launched till further orders. In respect of running contracts, no new position will be allowed to be taken. Only squaring up of position will be allowed, the regulator said in its order.  These directions will be implemented with immediate effect. The above-mentioned directions are applicable, for a period of one year, it added.  India is the worlds biggest importer of vegetable oils. Prices of these kitchen staples have been spiralling in recent months.  The government as well as the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) are struggling to hold prices of food items to curb inflation and Mondays measures are believed to be steps in this direction.

The ban will remain in force for a year.  Accordingly, traders will not be able to punch in any fresh futures trades on soyabean and mustard and their derivatives, crude palm oil (CPO), wheat, paddy (non-basmati ), chana and moong for one year from December 20. They will only be allowed to square off or reverse their existing positions. Sebi did not assign any reason for the suspension in its circular dated December 20.  A futures contract facilitates the purchase or sale of an underlying commodity for delivery at a later date.  NCDEX runs the countrys largest farm derivatives segment while energy and metals bourse MCX offers trading mainly on CPO as part of its much smaller agri bouquet. NCDEX will be the hardest hit by the ban as the soya complex accounted for 36% of its average daily turnover so far this fiscal year. MCX will witness only marginal impact.  Queries to NCDEX and MCX on the reasons for and impact of the ban went unanswered till press time.  Traders and an economist view the latest regulatory move as a measure to pre-empt inflationary expectations primarily in soyabean and CPO.  It looks like a proactive move to curb potential inflationary pressures in the soya complex and in CPO, said Naveen Mathur, director (commodities & currencies), Anand Rathi Share And Stock Brokers. Agreed Madan Sabnavis, chief economist, CareEdge Ratings. Growth in consumer prices of edible oils in November 21 remained high at 29.7% against 17.9% in the corresponding month of the previous year. Inflation of the other domestically produced items remains mostly under control. Given that chana and mustard were banned earlier, the (RBI and governments) point of concern seems to be edible oils.  Food and beverages have a 45.86% weight in the CPI, whose price growth has slowed to 4.9% this November from 6.9% in the same month last year. Analysts feel the government and regulators might not want to leave anything to chance in an environment where inflationary expectations could scuttle the recent recovery in an economy ravaged by the pandemic.  Harish Galipelli, head -strategy, ILA Commodities, said that while the merits of the ban were yet to be seen, trader sentiment in the farm commodity derivatives segment would be adversely impacted.

262,,,,2021-12-23,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/explained-why-sebi-suspended-futures-trading-in-agri-products/article38003931.ece,"Objective is to rein in prices of essential commodities  The story so far: Securities & Exchange Board of India (SEBI) on Monday issued directions to stock exchanges in the commodity derivatives segment for immediately suspending trading in derivative contracts in key farm commodities, namely paddy (non-basmati), wheat, chana, mustard seeds and its derivatives, soya bean and its derivatives, crude palm oil and moong for a year.  The derivative contracts in these commodities were already suspended, as per a SEBI statement on August 16 and October 8, respectively.  What are derivative contracts?  Derivative contracts are between two or more parties where the derivative value is based upon an underlying asset, in this case agri commodities.  The prices of the derivatives are established by the price fluctuations of the underlying assets. Derivatives can be traded on an exchange or over the counter (OTC).  How does the system work and what are derivatives trading?  Derivatives trading takes place when traders speculate on the future price of an asset through buying or selling of derivative contracts to maximise profit, as compared to buying the underlying asset outright.  Traders also use derivatives for hedging to minimise risk against an existing position. With derivatives, traders can go short and make profit from falling asset prices. They also use derivatives to hedge against any existing long positions. The ultimate objective is to profit. This is viewed as a deterrent to bring in price discipline in the market.  What does the SEBI order mean?  No new contract will be introduced until further orders. In respect of running contracts, no new position will be allowed to be taken. Only squaring up of position has been allowed. The imports in such commodities, especially edible oils, would reduce in the short term as traders will not have a hedging platform. Hedging, which is speculative in nature, has been made difficult. This will lead to release of blocked local produce supplies into the market, which should cool the prices. Imports of commodities for speculative gains will be discouraged.  What is the objective of the suspension?  It is to rein in rising prices of essential commodities, which are fuelling inflation. India is the worlds biggest importer of vegetable oil and this measure will make it difficult for edible oil importers and traders to transact business since they use Indian exchanges to hedge their risk.  It is believed that speculators have a role in jacking up prices and this needed to be discouraged to curb inflation and support growth as the economy is recovering from COVID-19 impact.  The suspension of trading in these commodities follows a communication from the Department of Economic Affairs, which is closely monitoring price movements.  How alarming is inflation?  As per the RBI governors recent monetary policy statement, CPI inflation went up in October to 4.5% from 4.3% in September, after falling sharply between June and September. The persistence of high core inflation (i.e., CPI inflation excluding food and fuel) since June 2020 has been an area of policy concern as input cost pressures could rapidly be transmitted to retail inflation as demand strengthens.  The governors assessment is that price pressures may persist in the immediate term. He observed that supply side interventions by the Government had limited the fallout of continuing high international edible oil prices on domestic prices.  While cost-push pressures continue to impinge on core inflation, the inflation prints are likely to be somewhat higher over the rest of the year as base effects turn adverse. However, it is expected that headline inflation will peak in Q4 of 2021-22 and soften thereafter. RBI has projected CPI inflation at 5.3% for FY22.  What is being done to deal with inflation?  Besides suspension of futures trading in key farm commodities by the SEBI, the Government and RBI are resorting to multiple interventions to curb the rising inflation.  Recently, as prices of edible oil hit near record highs, the Union Government substantially reduced taxes on imports of palm, soy and sunflower oil, but the move had limited impact on combating inflation.  The Union and State Governments had also recently reduced excise duty and VAT on petrol and diesel, which was aimed at bringing down inflation by way of direct effects as well as indirect effects operating through fuel and transportation costs.",GREEN GRAM DAL (MOONG DAL)
