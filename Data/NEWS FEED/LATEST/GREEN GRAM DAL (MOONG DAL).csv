Mix well and serve.VariationsYou can use any millet instead of rice.While saffron is not added in traditional south Indian pongal, if you wish, you can add it along with a very small pinch of edible camphor.TipsFor pongal, pudu paccha arisi is recommended because it gives a lovely fresh fragrance and turns soft quickly. It is also much cheaper than regular rice variants. Use of pudu paccha arisi is also considered very auspicious during Pongal because its a symbolic celebration of nature and its harvest.Puli Pongal by Jeyashri Suresh(Instagram @Jeyashris Kitchen)IngredientsBroken rice/arisi kurunai: 1 cup Tamarind a lemon sized Sesame oil: 2 tbsp + 2 tsp Mustard seeds: 1/4 tsp Peanuts: 2 tbsp Chana dal: 1 tsp Urad dal: 1 tsp Green chilli: 1 Dried red chilli: 2 Water: 3 1/2 cups Turmeric powder: 1/4 tsp Asafoetida: a generous pinch Curry leaves: few Salt as neededMethodSoak a small lemon-sized tamarind in 1/2 cup hot water for 10 minutes.

Cook for two more minutes. Turn the heat off. Temper with mustard seeds, curry leaves and 2-3 red chillies broken to pieces in one tablespoon sesame oil. We dont add chopped cilantro/coriander leaves to this sambar.Red rice ven pongal by Padma Balasubramanian(Instagram @Padma Balasubramanian)IngredientsRed rice: 1 cup Moong dal: 1/4 cup Pepper: 1 tsp Jeera: 1 tsp Hing powder: 1/2 tsp Ginger: a small piece, finely chopped Curry leaves: a few Cashews: 10 Ghee: 2 tbsp Oil: 1 tbspMethodWash and soak red rice for an hour in 3.5 glasses of water. Wash the moong dal, drain water and add it to the soaked red rice. Transfer to a pressure cooker and cook for six whistles. Keep the stove in sim for another five minutes and switch off. Allow the pressure to settle down and open after 20 minutes. It would have cooked very soft. If its watery, it will thicken after cooling. Add salt and mix well. Heat a frying pan. Add ghee and oil.

Wash well and add  cup water and two cups of milk. Cover it with a plate. Pressure-cook this for 7-8 whistles and keep it on low flame for five minutes. Switch off the flame.

2021-01-13,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/a-kitchen-experiment-to-find-the-best-alternative-to-raw-rice-for-sweet-pongal/article33567931.ece,"Is it thinai? Black rice? Perhaps thooyamalli, a heritage rice variety?The cooker with black rice and dal whistles, puffing steam along with a drizzle of purple-coloured water onto my kitchen walls.I wince at the thought of cleaning up: black rice, evidently, is not easy to handle. But once I open the cooker  after five whistles and 10-minutes of simmering on low flame  the glistening deep-purple rice makes me forget all else.Kavuni arisi or black rice pongal is the third variety I am experimenting with. In an attempt to make sakkarai pongal with heritage rice varieties this year, I narrow down to three: thooyamalli, kavuni arisi, and thinai arisi. The best pongal wins, which I will cook on the big day.Sakkarai pongal is a silky concoction of rice, moong dal, jaggery and ghee. Although raw rice is widely used, several heritage rice varieties make for a great pongal. These include iluppai poo samba, mappilai samba, neelam, Salem sanna, jeeraga samba, hand-pound raw rice, thooyamalli, kuruvai, and thinai arisi, according to Praveen Anand, executive chef, South Indian Cuisine, ITC Hotels.Millet on white backgroundPongal is a festival in which farmers offer to Nature whatever they grew on their land, explains Praveen, adding, The above varieties are grown in the Madurai belt, the stronghold of Tamil culture.Cooking time and the amount of water required, varies for each; Praveen suggests soaking the hard varieties such as mappilai samba for half an hour before cooking.Round 1Thooyamalli is from his list and the rice, slightly longer, but as thin as jeeraga samba, does a great job of becoming one with the jaggery and dal. The taste is similar to the typical raw rice pongal; the rice, a shade darker than ivory, bears a mild fragrance.Round 2Thinai or foxtail millet is technically not a rice variety. But I decide to cook it thanks to a conversation Coimbatore-based A Shrikumar, (who works for an NGO) had with an elderly man from a tribal village in the Sathyamangalam forest.I learnt that people of the Urali tribe make pongal with millets, thinai, ragi, cholam, varagu or samai, says Shrikumar. This is because they chiefly grow millets in the hills. And years ago, when jaggery was difficult to source, tribal people used honey to sweeten their pongal. They also made a curry with the vegetables they grew, to be had with pongal, he points out. They used wild tubers, broad beanswhatever they cultivated.Clockwise from left: Black rice, thinai, and thooyamalli pongal | Photo Credit: Special arrangementI cook thinai pongal in a steel wok since millets do not require pressure-cooking. The tiny round morsels yield well  in no time, they take in the jaggery syrup I spoon in. Thinai has a nice earthy fragrance that is subdued in the end result: what makes this pongal stand apart is the pleasingly grainy texture.Round 3Kavuni or black rice is the best-looking of them all. Apart from the health benefits the rice boasts, I pick it to attempt cooking a hard rice variety. Which means it requires soaking the night before to make the rice pliable. I pressure-cook it: it is easier that way. But before that, I spread the soaked rice on a piece of cloth to dry and dry roast it before cooking.I add jaggery syrup and simmer the deep-purple mix of rice and dal, but the colour remains the same. Once done, I top it with plenty of ghee-roasted cashews. The taste is unique: the rices nutty flavour fits jaggerys sweetness to the T. And the pongal is chewy, with a depth of flavour.The winner is undoubtedly black rice. It is slightly more elaborate to cook, but the end result is worth it.",A kitchen experiment to find the best alternative to raw rice for sweet pongal,GREEN GRAM DAL (MOONG DAL)

""To improve the quality of prices data for reporting daily prices by the price reporting centres, the Department of Consumer Affairs launched a Mobile App on 1st January, 2021,"" the department said in a statement.It said that the monitoring and predictive analysis of prices of essential commodities has taken a giant step forward.The mobile app for price monitoring for 22 essential commodities has started providing effective real time information about retail and wholesale prices from 127 locations across the country, the statement said.The daily report of retail and wholesale prices are obtained from 127 centres located across the country. The daily report of prices and indicative price trends are analysed for taking appropriate decisions such as release of stocks from the buffer and export-import policy etc. ""Price reporting through Mobile App ensures reporting from the market location as data are geo-tagged thereby displaying the location from where price data are reported,"" the statement said.The reporting of static data from office desktop is ruled out through the application of Mobile App. ""Therefore, the condition to operationalise Mobile App is that each Price Reporting Centre has to furnish market details such as names and addresses of the shops and markets from where prices are being collected daily,"" it said.As per the guidelines for retail price reporting, the prices of the same variety of a commodity are to be collected from three markets -- high income market, middle income market and low income market, and the average of the three prices is to be reported.The department said that the mobile App has inbuilt feature to calculate and report the average price. This helps in avoiding human errors in calculation. Market information from Agmarknet, Agriwatch, NAFED and trade associations also constitute inputs for price analysis.The department is also utilising the services of Agriwatch for providing market intelligence, predictive analysis of prices and to develop price forecasting model.The department said it had proposed to DEA (department of economic affairs) for technical assistance fund under CARES Progamme of Asian Development Bank (ADB) for improving price monitoring and analysis.The activity components under the technical assistance are upgradation of price monitoring portal, capacity building for price reporting centres and price monitoring cell, identification of long-term improvements for food commodity supply chain & market efficiency.It said that the DEA has approved the proposal.",Mobile app improves price data collection: Department of Consumer Affairs,GREEN GRAM DAL (MOONG DAL)

The duo was brought to Thiruvananthapuram zoo from Nagaland in 2017.Kohima, the Himalayan bear, at Thiruvananthapuram zoo having frozen watermelon pieces | Photo Credit: SREEJITH R KUMARWith the mercury levels rising, specific care is given to the residents on the 36-acre Thiruvananthapuram zoo. The daily menu has been tweaked for most of the animals. We include fruits and vegetables that are juicy and fleshy, especially watermelons and salad cucumbers, so that residents are not dehydrated. Both animals and birds relish those, says TV Anilkumar, Superintendent of the zoo.In the 155-plus kilograms of fruits and vegetables purchased daily, there are 25 kilograms of watermelon, nine kilograms of salad cucumber, 20 kilograms of cucumber (vellari) and 25 kilograms of different banana varieties. Salad cucumber is an addition this year because the animals like it more than vellari. We have even cut down the quantity of vellari by five kilograms, adds Sangeetha Mohan, Curator at the zoo.Carnivores reduce their meat intake during the summer months. For instance, tigers normally consume seven kilograms of meat daily. It comes down to five kilograms or so, says Dr Jacob Alexander, Zoo Veterinarian. Over 86 kilograms of meat (beef and chicken) is needed on a day for the carnivorous animals including seven tigers, two lions, six leopards, 10 hyenas, two foxes and four jungle cats.Short takes The diet chart is prescribed by the Central Zoo Authority.There are over 1,200 animals belonging to 105 species at the zoo. While primates and carnivores are fed only in the morning, rest of the animals have a meal at 11.30 am and 4 pm. Carnivores fast on Mondays, a regular holiday for the zoo.Water birds, otters, gharials and turtles eat fish. Ducks and swans have rice, amaranthus, green gram and cucumber. Peacocks and pheasants eat green chillies, coriander leaves, green gram, cooked rice and big onions.Among the flightless birds, rheas prefer cabbage, carrot, poultry feed, amaranthus and rice. While ostriches have amaranthus mixed with dog food, bananas and vegetables, emus are given carrot and bananas.Rhinos have cattle feed, cucumber, carrot, long beans, onion, grass, fodder and mineral mix.Monkeys now get more fruits, especially oranges and grapes, besides their daily meal of boiled eggs (they love egg whites!), guava, apple, bananas, coconut, papayas, groundnut (husked and de-husked), tomatoes, pineapple and long beans.Bath timeElaborate arrangements are also in place to keep the animals hydrated throughout the day. Sprinklers and fans have been installed inside the enclosures of rheas and nilgais or blue bulls. We operate the sprinklers at noon and they happily soak in the water to cool off. Or they move towards the fans to get relief. Sprinklers also ensure that there is enough green vegetation in the enclosures, adds Anilkumar.Meanwhile tigers, leopards and lions have the luxury of showers and concrete water pools within their cages. They love to rest in the water. Water is let out to the enclosures of Barasingha (swamp deer) and sambar deer so that they can create their own swampy environment with puddles, adds Dr Jacob. The regular diet for deer and other herbivores is a concentrated ration with cattle feed, Bengal gram sprouts, cotton seed and green gram, salt and mineral mix, besides grass and fodder. Mineral block and salt licks are always kept in the enclosures.Parrots feeding on fruits and vegetables at Thiruvananthapuram zoo | Photo Credit: SREEJITH R KUMARBirds get to eat more leafy greens these days, especially green amaranthus, which they have with rice. Garlic used to be an ingredient in their diet. But we dropped it ever since they showed an aversion to its taste, Sangeetha says.Special care is being given to three ostriches, two males and female. A few years ago an ostrich had died of heat stroke. It is the courting season for the ostrich and already seven eggs have been been laid.Water kept in clay pot for green vine snake to cool off at the reptile house at Thiruvananthapuram zoo | Photo Credit: SREEJITH R KUMARIn the reptile house, water is kept in clay pots for snakes to coil up against when temperature goes up. The three King cobras and two anacondas have the luxury of air-conditioned enclosures. While the anacondas, Dhil and Ruth, are fed a chicken and a rabbit once a week, the cobras feast on rat snakes.While summer is a difficult time for all zoos in the country, the situation is better in Thiruvananthapuram.

2021-03-23,https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/pune/eye-on-state-polls-central-government-pushes-import-quota-earlier-than-usual-farmers-upset-7242039/,"Farmers said this was a direct effort on part of the government to control pulse price inflation ahead of state elections at the expense of farmers incomes.(PTI/File)The central governments decision to prepone the announcement of import quotas for tur, moong and urad has not gone down well with growers. Farmers said this was a direct effort on part of the government to control pulse price inflation ahead of state elections at the expense of farmers incomes.Lalit Patil Bahal, executive president of Shetkari Sanghatana, claimed this promotion of imports would result in the ongoing farmers movement spreading to other parts of the country.On March 19, the central government had announced its intention of allowing imports of 4 lakh tonnes of tur and 1.5 lakh tonnes of moong for the next fiscal. This was in addition of 2 lakh tonnes of tur to be imported from Mozambique and 4 lakh tonnes of urad, which was announced earlier. India annually imports 10-15 lakh tonnes of pulses, which is a steep fall from the 30-40 lakh tonnes of import the country used to report around five years ago.Traders pointed out how in the previous years, the import quotas were announced towards end of April or early May, with daal millers and processors expected to complete the imports before the domestic arrivals start in the markets. This year, the import quotas have been preponed, which traders said was because of the pulse price inflation noticed in the country. Prices of almost all pulses in the country is now between Rs 100-120 per kg in retail markets.Arrival of urad and moong, both kharif crops, in wholesale mandis is negligible, but farmers continue to bring tur to the mandi. At Laturs wholesale mandi  the largest tur market in the country  around 2,500 quintals of the lentil arrive on a daily basis. As against the government-declared Minimum Support Price (MSP) of Rs 6,000 per quintal, the average trading price of tur at Laturs market is Rs 6,800.Nitin Kalantri, a Latur-based dal miller and trader, pointed out how mandi prices dropped to Rs 6,700 a day after the import quota was announced.

Referring to the ongoing farmers agitation against the three farm laws in the country, Patil Bahal said such trade decisions would result in the movement spreading to other parts of the country.Interestingly, Patil Bahals outfit had earlier supported the laws. Anil Ghanwat, another leader from Shetkari Sanghatana, which was founded by late Sharad Joshi, is part of the three-member body constituted by the Supreme Court to study the laws.Manikrao Kadam, another farmer leader from Maharashtra, pointed out how farmers had taken to growing pulses to make the country self-sufficient in protein. If the government doesnt ensure proper prices for farmers, they will again go for other crops, he said.","Eye on state polls, central government pushes import quota earlier than usual; farmers upset",GREEN GRAM DAL (MOONG DAL)

Subscribe here.)Her initial idea was to bring out a booklet for the community, but the information proved too voluminous. The result of her research has now been published as Classic Cuisine and Celebrations of the Thanjavur Maharashtrians.Culture across the pagesChennai-based Jaishri took up this task after her elder son was employed overseas and younger one joined university. The Thanjavur Maharashtrian diaspora is spread across the globe, and assuming that both my sons would one day leave the country, I wished to preserve our communitys unique cooking traditions and cultural heritage for the next generation, says Jaishri.The book features over 150 recipes, many of which are offered as naivedya (prayer offerings) during festivals, besides everyday dishes and delicacies.As festivals and religious rituals are a quintessential part of Maharashtrian culture, the author has structured the book chronologically, starting with the festival of Gudi Padwa in the month of Chaithra (March/April) and ending with the festival of Shimga Puneva (Holi) that falls in the month of Phalgun (February/March).As the community follows all rituals and celebrates festivals with fervour, I decided to follow this structure, where I mention the festival, talk about the rituals involved, and the dishes associated with a particular celebration, says Jaishri.In the section on Gudi Padwa, she lists staple heritage dishes such as puran poli, chinch bhath (tamarind rice), limbacha bhath (lemon rice), vaangi bhath (brinjal rice), ambode (a deep-fried spicy snack made with dal), pitla (mixed veg and lentil curry cooked in tamarind water), kadi (buttermilk-based curry) and other recipes.Timely evolutionOver three centuries, the Thanjavur Maharashtrians have also created new dishes, influenced by the Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Karnataka cuisines. Pitla and daangar (urad dal flour blended with curd) are typical Thanjavur Maharashtrian dishes, evolved over a period of time.Early migrants also replaced certain ingredients with locally available ones. For example, copra (dried coconut) is widely used in many Maharashtrian dishes, but in our community freshly grated coconut is roasted and then used to get the copra taste, she says.Coriander seeds, cumin and coconut are the dominant spices used in this cuisine.  We use various spice powders toasted in a minimal amount of oil to flavour the dishes.The simplicity of preparation with a good balance of spices is the hallmark of Thanjavur Maharashtrian cuisine, says Jaishri.A classic combination is ambat bhaaji, daangar and kaatracha misiringa (mor molaga Thanjavur style). Ambat bhaaji is a signature dish of our community. This spinach sambar is prepared with a liberal amount of toor dal, spiced with green chillies and seasoned with mustard, dry chillies and fenugreek. In sweets, puran poli, doodh poli and besan ladoo top the list.Methkoot and daangar are typical examples of the protein-rich diet of this diaspora. Methkoot is a powder made using a mix of lentils such as toor, channa, moong and urad. Coriander, cumin and dry ginger are used to flavour this powder, which can be used in multiple ways as an accompaniment or even mixed with curd or tamarind water.The book has been well received by the diaspora, especially the younger generation, and it has also won the Best Vegetarian Cuisine Book in the World Award by Gourmand International for the year 2020, says Jaishri.The book and Kindle versions are available on Amazon.","This book collates the traditions, rituals and cuisine of the Thanjavur Maharastrian community",GREEN GRAM DAL (MOONG DAL)

This year, snuggle at home with one such universal favourite  dahi vada, with all its shapes, flavours and toppingsFood in India is decided by season, and the ingredients available in the region one lives in. The festival of colours, Holi is just round the corner and, as the temperature rises, celebrations are incomplete without food that not only tickles your taste-buds, but also cools you down.Rajani Jain, a home chef in Delhi says, What better way than cool dahi vada after spending hours outside playing Holi? The dahi (curd) cools you down and the common urad dal vadas, laced with masalas  cumin, coriander and chat masala powder  bring forth a burst of flavours. I prefer ginger juliennes on it, with anar dana (pomegranate seeds), she adds.A homemade dish of dahi vada | Photo Credit: Prabalika M BorahThere are many such preferences and not restricted to toppings alone. There are variations that give this dish an interesting spin, like vadas made with mixed lentil, moong dal, bread, oats or even with jeera butter cookies. An illustration to go with Tarla Dalals recipe, for instance, suggests vadas can be made with jeera butter cookies, slightly soaked in lukewarm water before dunking them in a pool of seasoned yoghurt. The mixed lentil variety, also called masala vada, consists of chana dal, urad dal and moong dal, all coarsely ground.The tough questionDahi vada is a simple dish, but it can get complicated if the vadas are not soft enough.According to chef Garima Poddar, dahi vadas are unique, because though they are deep fried, they melt in your mouth. She adds: A lot of people get stuck with hard vadas or bhallas. To avoid this, one can soak the fried vadas in water for a few seconds, then squeeze the water out gently by pressing them between ones palms and drop them them in dahi.Having said that, softness need not be an obsession, adds Garima, In Rajasthan, the vadas are made with a slightly coarse paste of lentils, so there is a bite to its texture.Chef Kunal Kapoor suggests that the urad batter be made with less or no water, to get soft vadas. Whisking the batter well, for quite some time, right before frying the vadas will also be helpful, he says.Experimental matchmakingA dahi vada alu dum stall in Cuttack, OdishaStreet food lovers in Cuttack, Odisha have created their own twist to the dahi vada, pairing it with alu dum in a treat exclusive to this city.The now-iconic street food dahi vada and alu dum is a fusion experiment that has clicked very well, says consultant chef Rachit Kirteeman.Homemade dahi vada, by Hina Gujral Ingredients: 1 cup dhuli urad dal (split black gram); 1 chopped green chilli;  inch peeled and grated ginger; A pinch of asafoetida; 4 tbsp water; Salt to taste; Oil for deep frying; Lukewarm water; 2 cups thick yoghurt (curd); 1 tsp chat masala; 1 tsp cumin powder (for curd); 1 tsp cumin powder (for topping);  tsp black salt; 2 tsp sugar; 2 tbsp sweet tamarind chutney; 2 tbsp coriander and mint chutney; 1/2 tsp red chilli powder; 1 tbsp chopped corianderMethod:To make the vada batter, wash and soak dal in water for six hours or overnight. Transfer soaked dal to the grinder with chopped green chillies and grated ginger. Grind dal without using water, stop mixer in between, stir with a spatula and grind again. Keep doing this at regular intervals. If it still does not turn into a smooth paste, add one or two tablespoons of water, then grind. The idea is to use minimum water. Transfer the paste to a large bowl. Add salt, asafoetida and whisk batter briskly for a couple of minutes or till it is light and fluffy.Deep fry the vadas over medium heat by shaping small portions of the batter into flat balls with your fingers (dampened with water), or dropping them into the oil with the help of spoons. Allow them to cook as they fry. They can be turned when they are pale golden from the base and sides. Fry until they become crisp.Soak the vadas in lukewarm water in a wide saucepan. Keep enough space for the vadas to breathe, as they expand in water. Let them soak for about 10 minutes or until soft and drain out excess water from each vada by gently pressing between your palms.To assemble, first take curd in a bowl. Add salt, cumin powder, sugar and chat masala and whisk till smooth. Dilute the curd and season it to taste.Arrange vadas in a serving bowl. Pour the flavoured curd over the vadas, so that it soaks them completely. Top with the green chutney and tamarind chutney. Sprinkle red chilli and cumin powder and chat masala to taste. Garnish dahi vada with chopped coriander leaves. Serve chilled.He elaborates, The Cuttack region of Odisha produces a lot of milk. So instead of letting it go waste, curd was made. Vada is a staple breakfast. Someone who had surplus of both curd and vada mixed it together and added the alu dum as an unusual accompaniment. Dahi vada in Odisha uses diluted curd, so when alu dum is added, it becomes a complete dish.Season to tasteAs for spicing the yoghurt, Garima says, There is no thumb rule to seasoning the dahi. The same applies to its consistency. Some like it thick and creamy, others like it slightly runny. Experiment with what works for your palate on a small quantity of dahi.One of Garimas favourite variations of dahi vada is the South Indian version, which uses a runny curd base.She says, I also enjoy the tempering on it. One can play it up with any seasoning. I have tasted it with a garnish of peri peri masala, and also read about dahi vada with Tabasco sauce.Kunal suggests creative toppings: It is a season of fruits, so there is no harm in adding chopped fruits such as apples, bananas, grapes or even melons to the whisked yoghurt.",Cool off with some dahi vada,GREEN GRAM DAL (MOONG DAL)

But due to scarce rainfall in the last four months, the hopes of farmers were shattered as the crops got affected.Even after such plight, the farmers could not use machinery like water sprinklers which could have helped save the crops. Reason, lack of awareness on using such machinery and funds crunch. Only 4o of 2,198 farmers who had sown green gram in the district bought the sprinklers which were sold at a subsidised rate of `12,000 per unit by the Agriculture department.But the sprinklers too did not help as farmers alleged those stopped functioning within a couple of months. A farmer of Naugaon said the sprinkler he had bought stopped functioning within a couple of months due to which his crop on around 2.5 acre of land was spoiled.Sarat Chandra Nayak (65) of Sanpur village in Jagatsinghpur block said he does not recall facing such adverse conditions in the past. I had cultivated green gram on two acre of land and now it is tough to even recover the cost of seeds, he said. Sources said green gram crops have suffered considerable damage in Balikuda, Erasama, Tirtol, Kujang, Raghunathpur, Jagatsinghpur, Naugaon and Biridi blocks of the district.Chief district agriculture officer, Rabinarayan Mohapatra said if it does not rain in the next 5-7 days, more damage would be caused. He said the Agriculture department had spread awareness on use of sprinklers among farmers and since a few used the machine, the damage to the crop is significant this year.","Water scarcity hits crops, green gram farmers in fix",GREEN GRAM DAL (MOONG DAL)
2021-04-03,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/rising-prices-hit-households-reeling-from-shrunk-budgets/articleshow/81880966.cms,"Coronavirus: Live updates(Contributions by Mayur Shetty, Mamtha Asokan, Avik Das, Dipak Dash, Udit Prasanna Mukherjee and Surojit Gupta)NEW DELHI: Households across the country are facing the onslaught of rising prices and are witnessing a sharp dent in their monthly spend capabilities as prices of vegetables, groceries and transport mount steadily.Price pressures have added to the burden of households dealing with job cuts, salary reductions and loss of income as the effect of the pandemic-induced lockdown still plays out across some sectors, despite a strong economic recovery.Recent data point to a hardening of both retail and wholesale price inflation rates. Retail inflation has soared to a three-month high of 5% in February, while WPI (wholesale) inflation surged to a 27-month high of 4.2% in the same month, largely led by strengthening fuel, food and manufactured product prices.This is really a big problem for all of us, as high prices are upsetting our monthly budget, said Paramita Biswas, a professional singer and YouTuber in Kolkata. She said due to the pandemic, sanitisers and masks have added to expenses on health.The retail inflation data for February showed the extent of the strengthening prices. Meat and fish prices rose an annual 11.3% in February, while egg prices shot up 11.1%. Oils and fats rose 20.8%, while pulses and products rose 12.5%. In fact, prices of mutton, which hovered at Rs 500 per kg pre-pandemic, nearly doubled during the lockdown and have remained Rs 750-800 per kg a year later.Price of tur dal, which was around Rs 95 per kg in Delhi in April last year, has now soared to Rs 108 per kg. It is a similar story for other pulses such as urad and moong in cities such as Mumbai and Kolkata. Edible oil prices have also hardened. Mustard oil, which was selling at Rs 114 per kg in Mumbai last year, is now available for Rs 155 per kg, while sunflower, which was at Rs 105 per kg in Kolkata, is now at Rs 179 per kg.Rising fuel costs have also added to the woes of households, although of late there has been some easing. The NDA government had been successful in managing inflationary pressures since assuming power in 2014 against the backdrop of stubbornly high prices, but the pandemic-triggered price increases have upset the cart.Chinmoy Barik, who works as an engineer in an IT company, has been staying in Bengaluru for the last seven years with his wife, daughter and mother. He says the spike in fuel prices has hit his monthly budget majorly this year compared to last year. Though most of the year he has worked from home. It has hit my monthly budget as savings have gone down. A lot of extra expense has been incurred due to ordering food online during the lockdown, he said.The surge in prices of commodities and other costs are prompting people to reduce expenses on activities such as eating out.Rajiv Bansal, a bank employee in Mumbai, has a family of three. He continues to work from home for three days a week. Eating out has dropped substantially. He says his grocery, fruits and vegetables purchase costs have shot up not because of high prices but due to the buying of more quantity and exotic stuff. In education, there is a saving on childrens school uniform, transport and a marginal reduction in fees as extracurricular activities and field trips are not happening due to the pandemic. He has managed to re-negotiate the rent of his one-bedroom flat as several tenants in the complex had vacated and landlords were offering lower rates.While prices of vegetables are expected to stabilise as supplies improve, overall inflationary pressure is expected to linger for now. The latest Reserve Bank of India (RBI) inflation expectation survey showed that more households expect general prices as well as inflation to increase in the next one year. This is prominent in the case of food and non-food commodities. Households also expect more pressure on price of services over the one-year horizon when compared to a one-quarter (three-month) period.Pandemic-induced lifestyle changes are also adding to costs for some households. Consumption of vegetables and fruits suddenly shot up since the outbreak of the pandemic as we were forced to stay indoors. Now, we have decided to cut short on those expenses. Post-lockdown, we are now taking short breaks to entertain us, said Sumathi Jaykumar, a self-employed Chennai resident.",Rising prices hit households reeling from shrunk budgets,GREEN GRAM DAL (MOONG DAL)

Just like last year, the Covid-19 pandemic has thrown a spanner in the celebrations with number of positive cases rising every day. However, it has not dulled the spirit of worshippers who are happy to attend the virtual services from home and share a meal with their families.Talking about the services being held over the Holy Week, Father MM Kennedy from St Francis Xavier Church in Yapral, says: Our services are being held both physically and virtually. We are following government restrictions and allowing only a certain number of worshippers inside the church so as to follow physical distancing. We have open grounds outside the church and that makes the process easier. We had the morning service which reminds us of Jesus instituting the Eucharist and priesthood.Besides these, we carry out the ritual of washing feet which symbolises work of the Lord as service to the people. Today, on Good Friday, we remember the passion and death of our Lord, and we marked the Way of The Cross (14 stations) by taking all safety precautions. During the evening, we will follow Veneration of The Cross. On Saturday, at around 10 pm, we will hold the night Easter vigil which marks the Resurrection of Jesus.Roydin Roach, who is the Telangana president of the All India Catholic Union, says: In Hyderabad, we saw a large number of people offering prayers on Good Friday while taking Covid-19 precautions. Many parishes are broadcasting their services online through their own YouTube channels or Facebook Live feature. Liturgy TV, Catholic Hub and Divyavani TV are a few of the channels which telecast all services, in Hindi and English, live from city churches. We saw tableau and plays enacted across churches on Good Friday. At a few places, only the actors were allowed on the church grounds, while worshippers watched them from home. The night Easter Vigil, which can go on till 1:30 am, is the most important service of Easter. It involves rituals like lighting the candles and sprinkling of holy water.Easter is also the time of feasting for those who have been observing Lent fast for 40 days. Talking about the different dishes that are prepared during the fasting period and its culmination, Jacqueline Nicholas from Jackies Patisserie & Cafe says: My chicken roasts sell like hot cakes on Easter. Many followers do not eat meat during the 40-day period. The fasting ends after the Easter night service and people celebrate with chicken roasts along with grilled vegetables and Easter eggs. We have the tradition of eating hot cross buns and Kanji rice with various chutneys on Good Friday. The dish, to which no tadka is added, is prepared with rice, roasted moong dal and grated coconut. I made groundnut, onion and coconut chutneys to go with Kanji this year.Sujatha Stephen, who is a nutritionist with Yashodha Hospital, says that Easter is an auspicious festival for her family. Describing a typical Easter day at her home, she says: We start preparations for Easter after Good Friday. Due to the pandemic, we are not attending the early morning service at church and will be part of it virtually. In the pre-pandemic days, I used to go to St Georges Church. We would decorate the church with jasmine flowers. After the service, we would be offered Easter eggs which were boiled eggs with coloured shells. At home, we eat chocolate Easter eggs, cakes and a special meal. We marinate turkey in the morning and grill it to perfection. Later, at a lunch attended by friends and family, we serve it with either coconut rice or chicken biryani.

Vishukkani, the tradition of opening your eyes to witness the bounty of Nature, gold and God and the practice of receiving money from elders as Vishukaineetam are all integral to the festival. Then, of course, the joy in bursting crackers and feasting on the sadya.The festival has many regional variations. The celebrations are at its zenith in northern Kerala. Vishukkanji and Vishukkatta, for instance, are prepared only on the day of Vishu in those regions. If Vishukkanji, a gruel with rice and coconut or coconut milk is special for Palakkad and some parts of Kozhikode, Vishukkatta or rice cake cooked in coconut milk is a speciality of Thrissur district.Vishukkanji and butter beans stir fry | Photo Credit: Spicy N TastyEven the kanji has its variations. The simplest method is cooking unakkalari (raw rice with bran) and adding a generous amount of grated coconut to it at the end. We have it with a stir-fried curry, generally prepared with puliyavara (butter beans or Lima beans), says Vishnukumari A, a native of Kannambra in Palakkad, now settled in Kannur.The popular preparation of kanji has puliyavara and split green gram cooked with any variety of rice, such as puzhukkalari (red rice), pachari (raw rice) or Ponniyari (full-boiled rice). Both puliyavara and green gram are dry roasted. The former is pounded so that the outer skin, which is hard, comes off. If you are using whole green gram, it is better to pound it after dry roasting the same.Kanji wont be tasty if the skin is not removed. It can cause indigestion as well. We keep puliyavara as one of the items in the Vishukkani and the same beans is used in the gruel, says Lakshmi Kutty PP, a homemaker from Kallekulangara in Palakkad. Cumin, ghee or pepper can be added to up the taste of the gruel. If jackfruit is available, we make puzhukku (raw jackfruit cooked with coconut paste and spices) as the side dish, she adds.A different spinVishukkanji is usually served for breakfast on the festival day. In our tharavadu (ancestral home), it is served from 10.30 am onwards and is had for lunch as well. We dont prepare the sadya, says Manjula Jyothiprakash, a YouTube food blogger (Spicy N Easy) from Alathur in Palakkad.Vishukkanji (Palakkad style) Cook raw rice (1/2 cup), Matta rice (1/2 cup), split green gram (1/2 cup, dry roasted and with skin), and puliyavara or butter beans (2 tsp, dry roast and pound to remove the skin) with salt (as required) and water (one litre) in a pressure cooker. Switch off the stove after six whistles. Add water to adjust the consistency and cook. When the gruel boils, mix grated coconut (1 cup). Have it hot with a side-dish of your choice or pappadams or rice fritters.Courtesy: Spicy 'N' EasyI use both pachari (raw rice) and Ponniyari in equal quantities. Although some people cook the rice in coconut milk, I find it more tasty with grated coconut. In our house, we have stir-fried puliyavara as the side-dish. For this, the puliyavara has to be soaked overnight. Pappadams and rice kondattam (rice fritters) make it an even more tastier spread, says Manjula.However, neither puliyavara nor green gram figure in the gruel prepared by Kozhikode-based Hemalatha Chandran. I use nellu kuthari (par-boiled rice). Once the rice is almost cooked in water, ground cumin is mixed to it. Then coconut milk is added (first add second extract or randaam paal followed by the thick first extract or onnaam paal) and boiled. Add salt and adjust the consistency. It is more like a jeeraka (cumin) kanji, she says. The side-dish is stir-fried raw banana and long beans.Vishukkatta is a rice cake cooked in coconut milk and is often had with jaggery syrup | Photo Credit: Aswathy ManuVishukkatta is made with pachari. It is cooked in randaam paal and water. Once the rice is cooked and water dries, salt and the thick onnaam paal is added. Keep stirring it until it reaches the consistency of halwa. Grease a plate with some coconut milk and transfer the preparation on to it. Once it cools, it can be cut into pieces, says Anitha Hari from Edamuttam in Thrissur. A breakfast or pre-lunch dish, it tastes best with jaggery syrup.  We also have it with inji puli (tangy dish made with ginger, tamarind and jaggery), she adds.Karayappam, a different version of unniyappam (deep-fried dumpling with rice flour, banana and jaggery) is made in parts of Kannur on Vishu day. It has sugar instead of jaggery and is slightly bigger than the unniyappam. It is an offering for the deity when we arrange the Vishukkani, says Indira Jayadas from Vadakara.Vishukkatta is a rice cake cooked in coconut milk and is often eat with jaggery syrup | Photo Credit: Aswathy ManuAlthough the Vishu feast is usually a vegetarian affair, non-vegetarian dishes are also served in several households.

A lot of nuts and seed varieties can be germinated too.Now, sprouting is said to add to the nutritional content and make it a lot healthier to eat. According to nutritionists, soaking seeds in water allows softening up of the outer shells and membranes that may contain some anti-nutrients and may not facilitate proper absorption. It also eliminates gas-producing starch and lessens the cooking time of legumes and pulses.Usually eaten raw or cooked, sprouts can help maximize nutrient absorption of core vitamins, minerals, antioxidant profiles which benefit good health.Not only are they a powerhouse of nutrition, but their health benefits would also convince you to add them to your diet. We tell you about a few such reasons:Sprouting legumes, seeds or vegetables help eliminate phytic acid present in the membranes which limit the presence of digestive enzymes within the seeds.Now, a lot of the important enzymes present within the seeds help facilitate digestive processes, keep our metabolism in check and also work to improve chemical reactions in the stomach when we digest food. The enzymes also break down the food more effectively upon digestion, which helps us absorb nutrients better.Not to forget, sprouting a legume or a cruciferous vegetable adds dietary fibre to the seeds which eliminate toxin build-up from the body and keep the stomach clean and healthy.While it's crucial to have good quality fruits, vegetables, nuts and seeds to lose weight effectively, sprouts are also a healthy option to have. Not only are they filled with benefitting nutrients, but they also are low on calories, which is a prime reason a lot of weight watchers tend to have them in the form of snacks.The fibre present in the sprouted grains can also induce satiety, make us feel full and limit the release of ghrelin, which is an important hunger hormone. Sprouted moong beans, fenugreek seeds particularly are good weight-loss-friendly options to include in your diet.Sprouts contain a healthy dose of core vitamins and minerals like iron, copper, manganese and potassium which help boost the production of RBCs in the body, promote blood flow and most of all, supplies healthy oxygenated blood to vital organs.In a similar manner, germination of seeds and pulses is known to promote the level of Vitamin C and antioxidant profiles which help WBCs and support the immune system, warding off risks of illnesses and infections.Some sprouts contain helpful Omega-3 fatty acids in them which reduce the harmful level of bad cholesterol in the body that is harmful to your health. The anti-inflammatory properties also help reduce oxidative stress and cut down the risk of developing cardiovascular complications, if had regularly. Make sure you include them plenty in your diet.Spouted germs and beans are also a rich source of Vitamin A, Vitamin C, antioxidants which are extremely good for your skin and hair health. It is said that Vitamin A stimulates the growth of hair follicles, regeneration of cells and keeps skin hydrated too.Zinc meanwhile can stimulate levels of sebum in your scalp. Thus, they are excellent for your skin and health!We know that sprouting contains multiple detoxifying, heart and gut-friendly properties. What many dont know is that sprouting and germination contain high levels of glucoraphanin which is a core enzyme that protects your body from multiple types of cancers.Need any more reasons to have sprouts?",Health benefits of sprouting,GREEN GRAM DAL (MOONG DAL)

In fact, kanji is on song now.Oru kanji paattu (kanji song), produced by MuzicIndia, is all the rage among non-resident Keralites. Sung by Rema Iyer, a medical practitioner in the UK, the music video of the song has become a hit for its evocative lyrics. When Rema, a gynaecological oncologist at the Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother Hospital in Margate, UK was recuperating from surgery, she turned to kanji, the comfort food for many hailing from Kerala.Also known as Congee, it is a popular dish in many countries in Asia. Eaten hot or cold, it can be consumed as breakfast, lunch or dinner. Rema says she had it hot with a variety of sides to go with it.My surgery was in last November, when we were grappling with COVID-19 and winter with its grey skies and cold days. I found myself making hot kanji more than usual and enjoying every bit of it, recalls Rema. It was then that she remembered a song her mother, Rohini Iyer, had written on kanji. With simple lyrics and an easy hummable tune, the song was about the goodness of the food and the many ingredients and curries it could be combined with. The comfort food brings with it a whiff of childhood garnished with nostalgia and spiced with familiarity. Lyrics conjure images of sizzling hot kanji with puzhukku, a mash of vegetables cooked with coconut, cumin, turmeric powder and chilli.Rohini Iyer penned the verses of Oru Kanji Paatu, sung by her daughter Rema Iyer | Photo Credit: Special arrangementMy mother has this habit of jotting down simple verses. Many of them are centred on food. When a childhood friend, Ganesha Kumble, a musician, came visiting, he wondered about the possibility of setting Ammas verse to music and bringing them out as a collection. The initial plan was to compose songs on recipes of favourites like sambar, recalls Rema.To begin with he recorded Rema singing the kanji song with a simple tune. They found that many children of Keralites settled abroad had no idea of what kanji was and so they decided to begin with Oru kanji paattu. The nicest thing about kanji is that it can be had as a simple meal with just some salt and a pickle or it can turned into a grand meal with many sides and roasted pappadam, Rema says.The verses celebrate consuming kanji with coconut milk and ghee; a wide range of puzhukku; coconut chutney; roasted pappadam; green gram and also a typical Malayali dish like astram, curd-based side made with colacasia.In December, 2020, playback singer and actor Chitra Iyer, Remas sister, came visiting to keep her company during her recuperation. When Ganesha dropped in with his teenaged daughter Amritavarshini, a budding pianist, they were stuck at Remas place in Kent as UK went into lockdown.Ganesha Kumble, Rema Iyer, Amrithavarshini Kumble, and Chitra Iyer during the shooting of the music video 'Oru Kanji Paatu', sung by Rema Iyer | Photo Credit: Special arrangementThat was when they thought of a video to accompany the song. A couple of lines in rap was added to enhance the song. Ganesha shot the video, did the post production and sent it to friend and musician Manoj Kumar Medalodan in Thiruvananthapuram. He jazzed it up, adding some special effects and the song featuring Rema, Chitra, Amrithavarshini and Ganesha was uploaded on YouTube on April 9.I did the entire music production. As the lockdown was in effect, we had to make do with whatever was there in Remas house. However, we did manage to buy a big slice of frozen jackfruit from the market nearby and had lots of kanji for the shoot, says Ganesha.Chitra and Amritavarshini lip synced for the video and though they wanted the settu-mundu for an authentic Malayali feel, they had to settle for a mundu, black shirts and a cotton dupatta. It was a lot of fun and never once did we feel that we were in lockdown. We had to come up with all kinds of jugaad to make it look interesting, laughs Chitra.

In India, you might recognise it by one of its many local names, including panivaragu in Tamil, varigalu in Telugu, cheno in Gujarati, varai in Marathi, and barri in Hindi. Nutritious and versatile, panivaragu is a short season crop, which produces white, yellow, red, or black seeds.It is grown in several states, including Madhya Pradesh, eastern Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, and Karnataka. While the common uses of panivaragu are unfortunately often restricted to bird feed, it is, in fact, a diverse ingredient to be used in the kitchen in savoury and sweet dishes alike. One can make khichdi, idli, roti, and samosa, as well as barfi and payasam.Full of fibre, carbohydrates, proteins, fatty acids, and nutrients, panivaragu is a healthy addition to your daily diet. Panivaragu is high in fibre and contains B Complex vitamins (including niacin and thiamine) that are very rarely available naturally. The millet is also good for those with diabetes and people who want to lose weight, explains N Vijayashree, chief dietician at MGM Healthcare, Chennai. There are often wrong notions that you cannot eat panivaragu daily.According to my Ayurvedic doctors, you can consume the millet every day without any side effects. If someone is very new to millets, they can drink a cup of hot water to help with digestion. You must ensure to soak it for at least five hours, and then, grind and ferment it to be made into idli, dosa, etc, mentions Indra Narayan, a home cook (@indranarayan) and the author of ebook Millet Kitchen: The Simple Art of Millet Cooking. She further elaborates on the benefits of eating proso millet.Aids nervous systemThe presence of a complex compound in panivaragu called Lecithin is known to indirectly stimulate and ensure smooth functioning of the nervous system.Helps anti-ageingA daily portion of panivaragu can reduce the deficiency of niacin or vitamin B3 in the body, which will aid in skincare. A reliable source of antioxidants, the millet also helps in removing free radicals from the bodythat can contribute to ageing and other illnesses, including cancer and autoimmune diseases.A gluten-free solutionSince the millet is completely gluten-free, it is a great food source for those suffering from gluten intolerance or following a gluten-free diet. People with celiac disease an immune reactionto consuming gluten can use panivaragu as an alternative to millets such as wheat or rye.Regulates insulinPanivaragu contains a potent dose of magnesium, which helps to keep a check on glucose and control healthy insulin levels.Keeps cholesterol in checkThere is a phytochemical in panivaragu called the phytic acid that can reduce the level of bad cholesterol in the body.

After doing away with licensed imports, the central government has now directed state governments to verify stock held by millers, traders and others to rule out hoarding.Damaged crop and reduced per acre yield has seen pulses trading either at or above the government declared Minimum Support Price (MSP). Thus growers of urad and moong as well as tur had seen good realizations despite the increase in sown area.August rains had wreaked havoc in the moong and urad fields in states such as Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, while post October rains had destroyed the then growing crop of tur in Karnataka and Maharashtra. Similarly, rabbi chanas per acre yields have been low due to crop damage in parts of Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh.As a result of this supply-demand mismatch retail prices across the country have been on the higher side throughout the year. Retail prices of all pulses are between Rs 70-120/kg in most urban cities of the country. Given the increase in retail prices, the central government had intervened to cool down prices. The central government had increased the time limit for arrival of imported tur by a month, clashing with domestic stocks arriving in markets.

On May 22, the association sent a letter to the Prime Minister Narendra Modi pointing out the actions being taken might have short term effect and its long term effect could pose a threat to the progress made by the country in terms of self sufficiency achieved in pulses. Contrary to the popular perception, the letter said, moong and chana were trading below their MSP while urad and tur were selling above their MSP. The present price rise, the letter said, is short term and any action before monsoon sowing can see farmers turn to crops like sugarcane or soyabean in preference of pulses.Instead of knee-jerk reactions, the association has asked the government to use the buffer stock available with various government bodies like NAFED to cool down retail prices.","Ahead of kharif season, government steps in to check pulse price rise",GREEN GRAM DAL (MOONG DAL)

The road to complete recovery from COVID-19 is tiring. Besides sleep and rest, eating healthy is an essential now to aid in healing.Good nutrition helps your battered body build up its energy levels as fast as possible, says Dr Kavitha Fenn Arunkumar, Madurai-based psychiatrist, referring not just to those who have suffered the sickness, but also those who have seen adversity through the pandemic. In fact, she recommends the intake of easy-to-digest food in frequent and small measures because the body and mind are both vulnerable and not in a condition to labour hard over three big elaborate meals.Dr Arunkumar receives three or four calls a day from those who have seen a COVID-19 death in their families and now during their own recuperation are finding it difficult to eat. The food we eat should be easy and comforting to chew and swallow, she says. She also cautions against emotional eating (feeding on convenience foods to satiate cravings). Its best to eat food that does not cause distress to the digestive system or any other part of the body, she says.Power up with nutrientsTo gain stamina and fight the weakness, Delhi-based nutritionist Shweta Gupta says it is important to power up with proteins as they help reverse tissue damage and stimulate the production of T-cells, the agents that promote healthy immune functioning. Proteins are the most important macro-nutrients that aid in rebuilding and recharging the body; vitamins improve immunity and probiotics improve the gut bacteria after the heavy antibiotic and steroid used in treatment, says Anjali Dange, nutritionist and founder of Starlite Nutrition and Wellness Centre, Visakhapatnam. For those who are lactose tolerant milk-based products have immunomodulatory, antimicrobial, and anti-hypertensive effects on the body.Buy fresh and seasonal fruits and vegetables for good healthThe carbohydrates in our breakfast and lunch can constitute up to 25%, says Gurugram nutritionist Asheesh Grewal. Our Indian kitchens are full of potent anti-inflammatory and anti-viral ingredients such as ginger, turmeric, garlic, cumin, coriander, mint, cinnamon, honey, all of which are usually and can be used in different combinations and different items for overall well being. One should nourish the body well for at least six months post-COVID treatment, he says.Comfort foodHome-maker Mili Ghosh from 24 South Paraganas, West Bengal, cooks and packs seven different types of khichdi for each day of the week and home delivers it fresh in her neighbourhood to those in home quarantine. After hearing a dietician on television, I began preparing khichdi using a different millet and combination of dals each day and powered it with lots of seasonal vegetables, says Mili, who has been doing this free of cost for six weeks now ever since her husband fell to COVID-19. Along with the nutritious and tasty khichdi, she also gives them a boiled egg five days a week and a flask of lassi daily. I am alone and this work keeps me going, she says.Suman Agarwal, from Mumbai, recommends the 4X model: four meals at agap of four hours each. Follow the 8 am- noon-4pm-8 pm or 9 am-1 pm-5 pm-9 pm schedule and control the portions, especially carbohydrates. Feed your hunger but never over-stuff, she says.Tips to follow at home: Avoid elaborate cooking and stick to simple recipes with more greens (Spinach, methi, sarson saag and other keerais) as they are known to lower anxiety levels.Make one or two vegetable chutneys and store, so that you can use them every day with rice or chapatis.Keep a jar of nuts and seeds by your side for easy snacking, They are potent sources of essential fatty acids such as Omega-3 and healthy fats that boost energy and promote healthy cholesterol levelsTaste and smell may take a while to return to normal making every bite of food utterly tasteless but it is important to keep up the appetite with small and frequent meals.The essential vitamins required during the period of healing are C and D. They help to prevent the body from oxidative damage and reduce inflammation. Stock yourself up with guavas, amla, kiwis, oranges and sweet lime for your lung healthSubhashree Ray, clinical and public health nutritionist in Mumbai, focusses on customised nutritional requirements of those with co-morbidities, particularly diabetes. Those with insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome need to be extra cautious of what is entering their body, she says and suggests complex carbohydrates such as whole grains and legumes for them. High fibre cereals and pulses like jawar, bajra, ragi, brown rice, oatmeal, millets, quinoa take longer to digest than simple carbs (refined grains like maida  often found in bread) and thereby keep the blood sugar from spiking, she adds. A staple cuisine of Bengal, the tetor dal (bitter lentil) made with the yellow split moong dal and karela (bitter gourd) is considered good.Nutrients-dense post-COVID recovery mealPasty khichdi with lots of vegetables; mashed dal or rasam with rice; curd rice; paneer or soya curry with two to three soft phulkas; green leafy and seasonal vegetables; steamed fish, egg and chicken (for non-vegetarians).Eat home-made balanced diet for the body to respond well and fast after infectionHealthy snacks:A bowl of salad or low-fat curd at room temperature, figs and dates, a spoonful of pumpkin, chia or flax seeds, boiled peanuts or chick peas, a fistful of nuts (including almonds, walnuts), sweet potato chaat or seasonal fruits.High hydration:Enough water, low salt lassi, coconut water, butter milk with a dash of cumin and mint, chaach, and fresh juice with seasonal fruits (without adding sugar), bael ka sharbat (it is high in fibre).Chicken or vegetable broth soupThe immunity boosters:You can make a variety of health drinks at home to improve your haemoglobin levels. Here are a few suggested by the nutritionists:Blend one small amla, half a carrot and apple each, one tomato, quarter of a boiled beetroot and half cup pomegranate; dilute it with little water to suit your taste.Kadha: To 300 ml boiling water add 10 basil (tulsi) leaves, four lightly crushed peppercorns, half inch grated ginger and one pinch cinnamon. Reduce the concoction to half and add one teaspoon honey.A simple concoction of coriander, cumin and fennel seeds (saunf) or lemon and barley water is good for general well-being.",Here’s what to include in your post-COVID-19 diet,GREEN GRAM DAL (MOONG DAL)

Her grandmother had ensured everyone at home joined in  a tradition Sood continues to this day with her own family. The Noida-based architect, food lover, and fermenting addict sources her amlas from a local farmers market.Since the lockdown began last March, with doctors highlighting the importance of good immunity, many have rediscovered this commonplace powerhouse of vitamin C. Our days now begin not with tea or coffee, but with a shot of this bitter-sour juice, with its final rush of sweetness, packed with nutrients and immunity boosters. But even before the coronavirus came calling, amla has been a vital ingredient in most Indian homes. It would be boiled with salt water, hing and turmeric, to make an oil-free pickle; ground and stirred into a thokku; grated and added to curd for a raita; or cooked with dal for a deeply-flavourful side dish. Amla has also been a part of native medicine, and its dried and candied versions have come in handy as digestives.Also read: How do you like your amla?

Long after the soft fruit was eaten, we would delight in the saltiness of the seed.Now the world is discovering the Indian gooseberry  different from its cousins in the Americas and the Continent that are smaller, grow on spiky bushes, and are perhaps a tad less sour. According to recent news reports, KoreaShop 24, which facilitates trade between India and the South Korean market, closed a deal for Nature Factory, a company based in Seoul, to export amla extract worth 85 lakh. With the growing demand for immunity-boosting Indian gooseberries in Korea, the order is expected to go up, based on the reception.Meanwhile, back home, as demand continues to grow, we take a nostalgia break with farmers, bloggers, writers and homemakers about their memories of the gooseberry.Anamika Singh | Photo Credit: Special ArrangementTea infusions in Dharamshala, Himachal PradeshAnamika Singh | Founder-director, Anandini Himalaya TeaWe lived in Darjeeling for 35 years and my earliest, fondest memories are of the Margarets Hope Tea Estate in Kurseong, where my father was, says Singh, 50. Bhansghadi was a bamboo grove with gorgeous orange and gooseberry trees. When my brother and I visited from boarding school, workers would bring bamboo baskets full of sweet-sour orange and fresh amla. It was exciting to bite into the amla and drink water. I still remember that sweetness.Hornbill Grandeur, a green tea with amla, wild apples and moringa | Photo Credit: Special ArrangementYears later, when she began making tea infusions as part of Anandini Himalaya Tea, an offshoot of her familys 160-year-old Manjhee Valley Tea Estate (which they have been running since 2003), Singh wanted to focus on things that she had a bond with  places and memories. I was fascinated by ingredients that triggered emotions. It could be a flower or something available for a small window of time. In 2015, the Nagaland government asked us to create a blend to gift dignitaries who visited the annual Hornbill festival. And so was born the Hornbill Grandeur, a green tea with amla, wild apples and moringa. Its a beautiful blend, very simple and subtle with a hint of sweetness, and its very healthy without being medicinal, she says. I am glad we did it. Gooseberry is becoming very popular now and no one usually associates it with tea, but its delicious.A tea taster, Singh also conducts tea tasting ceremonies.TR Sasi Varier | Photo Credit: Special ArrangementLanguage lessons in Tiruchirappalli, Tamil NaduTR Sasi Varier | Director, Ashtanga AyurvedicsI literally grew up on the factory floor, laughs Varier, 58. Ive been seeing amla [or nellika, as its called down South], both fresh and dry, since I was about seven, and I have a deep respect for it. He tells me that there are broadly two types of gooseberries: the country and the grafted variety. The former produces small fruits, as compared to the grafted ones such as Krishna, NA7 and BSR1  which grow to 10 ft in height. He has about 60 amla trees in his enterprises garden, five of which are native.He remembers hearing stories about how people would cut the trunk of the nellika tree and drop it into wells, to purify and sweeten the water. These would endlessly lie at the bottom. In fact, in Malayalam, there is a saying that references this: Kshamayude nellipadi kandu [meaning, Ive reached the end of my tether, Ive reached the nellika logs in the well, he says, to underline how integral the amla is to us in India.Puspanjalee Das Dutta | Photo Credit: Special ArrangementAmla with fish in Guwahati, AssamPuspanjalee Das Dutta | Food bloggerAmla is an integral part of life in the East. Growing up in Barpeta in Lower Assam, we had a 40-year-old tree at home that fruited liberally twice a year. My grandmother and mother would cook with the amla with fish, and make mukh suddhi with dried amla [much like a paan, and used as a mouth freshner]. Even now, my mother sends it across to me, annually. They also dry the amla and powder it for later use, and send it to those who lived in other cities, she says. Today, Dutta, 35, incorporates the fruit in her familys diet by adding it to a dal, so that its sharp flavour mellows down. I add it to moong or masoor, and temper it with cumin or fenugreek seeds. Its delicious and aromatic. Fish and mashed amla also make a good combination.Vikram and Shikha Bhargava | Photo Credit: Special ArrangementPickles and chutney in Paharapurwa, Madhya PradeshVikram Bhargava | The Little Farm CoWhen Bhargava, now 56, moved out of Delhi to buy a parcel of land near Khajuraho in Madhya Pradesh, his family wondered if he was making a mistake. It was a drought prone area. A horticulturist, however, gave him a list of trees that would thrive there. Today, over 2,000 amla trees dot the 400-acre, rain-fed farm. During a good season, each tree will yield about 250 kg. In 2019, I was told to sell the excess fruit. But I was offered 4 per kilogram during winter, and got 4,000 for a quintal! he recalls.So, last season, Bhargava introduced an amla-garlic chutney at Little Farm. This year, we launched pickles, which did very well. Now, Ive decided to launch one new amla product a year  sharbat, chyavanprash, amla candy, and the like.Also read: How do you like your amla? Try it in a salad or a bake | Talking beauty with amlaKrish Ashok | Photo Credit: Special ArrangementDissecting the fruit in Chennai, Tamil NaduKrish Ashok | Author of Masala LabThe gooseberry has a complex, savoury tartness that comes from its diversity of acids: malic, shikimic and citric. Depending on when it is plucked and the variety, the flavour profile can vary from sweet and tart, to astringent, explains Ashok, 44, who cooks with it extensively. It can be directly used as a souring agent, in much the same way as raw mango is used. Amla dal, for instance, is a fantastic way to use this fruit. Breaking down the science behind why water drunk after eating amla tastes sweet, he says, It is because of Vitamin C, which is water soluble. It is chemically very similar to glucose, and thus its solution tastes sweet to our taste buds. Since cooking tends to reduce some of its nutrition, Ashok suggests that a good way to enjoy the raw fruit is to lacto-ferment it. Let it sit in a 2% salt solution for two to three weeks, The lactobacteria will convert the sugars in the fruit to lactic acid, which has a much milder sourness. Fermentation also increases bioavailability of other nutrients such as iron, he says, adding that fermented amla works well in dishes, lending a complex sourness combined with the umami from the proteins broken down by the bacteria.Daljit Bindra | Photo Credit: Special ArrangementHouseproud in Faridabad, HaryanaDaljit Bindra | HomemakerAmla is the king of trees, Bindra, 85, says, adding that her 25-year-old tree at home is beloved and still fruits profusely.

We dry it and turn it into a variety of pickles  with salt, jaggery and other spices. I grew up listening to the story of the deer that ate an amla and drank water from a pond and told the other deer that the water from the pond was sweet.

But incessant rains and flood damaged our crops. Many farmers have lost their vegetable crops.

Now, we are in a precarious situtation, said Ashok Sutar, a betel leaf farmer of Rangani.President of the district unit of Krushak Sabha Umesh Chandra Singh said the cyclone and resultant floods in the summer have dealt a crushing blow to the agricultural economy of the district by washing away standing crops. A large number of farmers fear more losses are in store for them if rainwater is not flushed out from their lands soon.Every year, farmers of the district face crop loss due to natural calamities and inclement weather. But they allege, the administration pays only lip service to their problems.Faulty agricultural policy of the government is the main reason behind the woes of cyclone-affected farmers. Since a concrete policy to insure agricultural lands is yet to be formulated, a large number of farmers are not covered by any insurance companies, Singh alleged.District emergency officer Sambeet Satpathy said all the cyclone-hit farmers will be provided loans from the government, cooperative banks and other financial organisations.

(Representational Photo)Balwinder Singh (50), a farmer of Tarewala village in Moga district, had grown summer moong on 35 acres this year with a hope of getting Rs 7,196 MSP announced by the Centre. On Tuesday, however, he sold his crop at the rate of Rs 6,000 to 6,200 per quintal, around 17 per cent to 14 per cent below the MSP fixed on the recommendation of Commission for Agriculture Cost and Price (CACP).As summer moong started reaching Punjab mandis a few days back, the price opened 10 to 17 per cent below MSP.After selling his crop, Balwinder said: I brought my crop to Jagraon mandi in Ludhiana district as it is one of the main markets for moong dal crop. It is auctioned with the help of arhtiyas and private players purchase it. Government has neither any role in procurement nor a control over its prices. We have to sell it as per market rate as we do not have any other optionAlso Read | For Punjab, pulses could hold key to breaking wheat-paddy cycleBalwinder grows summer moong (March to June), apart from paddy (June to October) and potato (October to March). He has around 60 acres of land.Another farmer, Avtar Singh, sold his moong crop at the rate of Rs 6,500 per quintal in Rayya mandi in Amritsar district. He said that private players are not ready to give farmers the MSP fixed by the government. Government must have some control on the MSP fixed by it, he said.In the retail market the rate of moong dal is Rs 110 per kg, which comes to Rs 11,100 per quintal.Moong cultivation provides farmers with an opportunity to have a third crop in a year. Moreover, moong being a leguminous crop is beneficial for the soil as it helps in nitrogen fixation and contributes to improving soil fertility. It is just a 65-day crop.President of Federation of Arhtiya Association Punjab, Vijay Kalra, said that the moong dal has started arriving in around half dozen markets of the state and the maximum rate is Rs 6,500 per quintal and minimum around Rs 6,000 per quintal, which may go up because it is just the beginning of the arrival of the crop in the mandis.Going by the economics of this crop, farmers can get 5-6 quintals moong per acre (12-15 quintals per hectare if the crop is bumper) which translates to Rs 35,980 to 43,176 per acre if they get the MSP of moong decided by the Centre (Rs 7,196 per quintal). But at the current market price, a farmer would be selling it at Rs 30,000 to Rs 36,000 per acre. While the input cost would be around Rs 8,000-9,000 per acre including seed, labour, and other expenditure. But if the farmer has taken the field on rent then he has to bear the rental cost of around Rs 18,000 per acre. (Annual rental cost of per acre is Rs 45,000 to 55,000 per acre in most part barring some districts of Malwa regions where annual rent is Rs 60,000 to 65,000 per acre. If a farmer is growing three crops he has to include 1/3rd rental cost per crop)Experts said that after deducting input cost and rental cost, he would be left with Rs 8,000 to 15,000 per acre if he sells crops at the fixed MSP, but at current market price, he would be getting Rs 3000 to Rs 9,000 per acre only. If a farmer has his own land then he can make a reasonable profit of Rs 21,000 to Rs 27,000 per acre.This expenditure does not include the family labour hours and when those are included, then the farmers will be at loss which means that not only the MSP should be increased as per the formula of M S Swaminathan commissions recommendation but also farmers should get the full MSP, said Jagmohan Singh, general secretary, BKU (Dakuanda).","Summer moong sells below MSP in mandis, farmers say have no choice",GREEN GRAM DAL (MOONG DAL)
2021-06-11,https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/chandigarh/for-punjab-pulses-could-hold-key-to-breaking-wheat-paddy-cycle-7353861/,"In the 1960s, Punjab cultivated pulses on almost 54 times its present area under the crop. (Representational Photo)Amid apprehensions of shortage of pulses in the country in the pandemic year, agriculture experts in Punjab say that it was time for the state to focus on growing pulses again to help itself and the nation.In the 1960s, Punjab cultivated pulses on almost 54 times its present area under pulses. The state grows pulses during Kharif (June to October), Rabi (November to March) and summer (March to June) seasons. Moong and mash are grown in Kharif and summer seasons, while gram and masar are grown in Rabi season.According to Punjab Agriculture university (PAU), Ludhiana, in 1961-62, Punjab had 9.17 lakh hectares (22.65 lakh acres) area under pulses (both Kharif and Rabi), which was maximum in the history of the state. But now this area has reduced to merely 17,300 hectares (estimated) in 2019-20.In early 2000s, Punjab had ventured into growing summer pulses and had dedicated 78,000 hectares (over 1.92 lakh acres) area to it in 2010-11. This has now reduced to 22,700 hectares. The summer season pulses are not grown during the wheat and paddy season.Over the decades, major drop was noticed in the Rabi season pulses, which used to have a major area in the state in 1961-61 with 8.81 lakh hectares (96 per cent of the total pulses crops) that has now reduced to just 5,600 hectares (2019-20).Also, total production of the pulses was 7.26 lakh tonnes in 1960-61, which came down to around 16,500 tonnes (estimated) in 2019-20.In Punjab, Kharif season moong, mash and arhar used to be grown on 99,300 hectares till 1985-86, but now this area has reduced to 11,700 hectares. Arhar dal also used to have 42,500 hectares (1.04 lakh acres) area under it, which is now down to 4,700 hectares.Punjabs productivity of pulses is also more than the all india average as the state has 954 kg production of pulses per hectare against 826 kg nationwide production per hectare. This is the reason that experts believe that Punjab can play a major role to meet the pulses shortage.While area under pulses is Punjab was declining due to the wheat-paddy assured price cycle, Indias total area under pulses increased by 4.5 million hectares (around 45 lakh hectares) from early 1960s to 2019-20. Indians estimated area under pulses in 2019-20 was 27.87 million hectares against 23.56 million hectares in early 1960s. The countrys production has also almost doubled from 12.20 million tonnes in early 1960s to 23 million tonnes in 2019-20 (estimated).Punjab needs to increase area under pulses both Kharif and Rabbi pulses as it will break the wheat and paddy cycle, but for that government must support farmers to get the reasonable market price, said renowned economist Sardara Singh Johal.He added: Pulses and Kapas (raw cotton) can be one of the best alternatives to diversify area of paddy in Kharif season), while Rabi season pulses and oilseeds can be best alternative for diversifying area under wheat in Rabi season.As we need to bring down paddy (non-basmati) area close to 1.2 million (12 lakh hectares) from 2.7 million hectares currently and wheat area to 3 million hectares against the current 3.5 million hectares that means total decrease of around 2 million hecatres (20 lakh hectares). If Punjab goes back to its roots, when around one million hectares (96 per cent was under Rabi pulses), the state can achieve diversification, said a senior Agriculture Officer in Punjab government, adding that it is not an impossible task.Even the semi-hilly rain fed areas in Hoshiarpur, Pathankot, Gurdaspur, Nawanshahr, Ropar districts can adopt pulses and maize during Kharif as this will save huge amount of groundwater and make farmers come out of the wheat and paddy cycle, said the officer.Currently, Punjab needs around 6 lakh tonnes of pulses, but its own production is around 36,500 tonnes  including 16,500 tonnes of Kharif and Rabi pulses and 20,000 tonnes of summer pulses. This is only 6 per cent of the total consumption requirement of the state.Even by reviving our pulses area of 1960s and adding little more to it, Punjab will not only be able to become self-sufficient in the pulses production, but it will also serve the nation the way it has been serving in foodgrains for the past over 5 decades. Punjab can supply almost half million tonnes pulses to the national kitty after meetings its own need, said Jagmohan Singh, General Secretary, BKU (Dakuanda), adding that farmers have been demanding the MSP of all crops for fthe past six months while sitting at Delhi borders.","For Punjab, pulses could hold key to breaking wheat-paddy cycle",GREEN GRAM DAL (MOONG DAL)

The real challenge is creating one that is delicious as well, since virtue alone cannot fuel sales.Recently launched Flipside has a secret weapon up its sleeve: the Beyond Meat burger, which is now making its India debut.In the bustling kitchen, chef Deepesh Chandran experiments with the first batch, searing a Beyond Meat patty, then layering it with cheese, lettuce and tomatoes. Placing it on the table with a flourish and French fries, he slices the burger into two to study its pleasing caramelised surface and intricate marbling of fat for optimum juiciness and a springy texture. Then does the same with the brands Beyond Sausage.A worthy back storyA clever alchemy of plant proteins, cacao butter and beetroot juice all intricately knitted together to provide a tasty alternative to meat, the product has a loyal following among vegetarians and vegans in the United States, where it was launched in 2012. Founded in 2009, in Los Angeles, Beyond Meat attempts to offer consumers plant-based substitutes that have more protein than their animal counterparts, no cholesterol, less saturated fat and no antibiotics or hormones.More sophisticated than the fake meat and soy substitutes of yore, these products are engineered to taste familiar, primarily appealing to a niche but growing group of vegans and vegetarians who have given up eating meat for ethical reasons.

They are made up of biomolecules and macromolecules, and are important building blocks of bones, muscles, and ligaments. They help the body recover from scars by healing the repair tissues, and are a vital compound that carries oxygen throughout the body.The nutritionist added that the majority of mothers (primary meal planners and providers) are muddled with so many myths regarding proteins. 72% believe proteins are difficult to digest. And thus must be avoided at night completely. 79% believe that protein is expensive to procure.

We decided to collect data on these people from ration shops and gram panchayat offices where they would have registered under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee MGNREGA ).

On paper, food inflation, driven by costlier cooking oil and pulses, is being cited as a reason for this move but farmers are talking about erratic rainfall pattern, which can become problematic in the days to come.As of July 3, the country has reported a slender 4 per cent excess rainfall with India receiving 198.6 mm rainfall as against the normal 191.6 mm. The spatial distribution, however, paints a grim picture. While in the first two weeks of June, majority of the country reported large excess of rainfall, this soon changed. Most parts of the country went dry from the week ending June 16. The northern limit of the monsoon has not moved since June 16 and, thus, rainfall has been erratic.The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has ruled out any significant rainfall before the end of the first week of July.Read | Farmers plan to protest outside Parliament every day during Monsoon SessionWith erratic rain pattern, most farmers have stopped their sowing activities. Data as published by the department of agriculture and farmer welfare shows that till June 25, India has recorded sowing over 202.72 lakh hectares (lh) as compared to 258.62 lh last year. In states like Maharashtra, farmers have reported sowing over 55.42 lh as compared to 90.03 lh area last year.Across the country, crops like pulses, cotton and oilseeds have reported the greatest dip in sowing. Last year, oilseeds were sown over 36.65 lh, which has dipped to 23.64 lh this year; similarly pulses, which were sown over 17.51 lh in 2020, have been sown over 14.58 lh in 2021. Cotton growers in 2020 had raced ahead with sowing and, by June 25, sown the lint crop over 71.69 lh, but this year sowing has been reported over 37.14 lh. Sugarcane is perhaps the only major crop that has reported a year-on-year growth in sowing.In Maharashtra, till June 28, farmers have reported sowing of 8.36 lakh hectares of pulses with toor accounting for over 5.5 lakh hectares alone. This is a sharp dip from the 11.95 lakh hectares of sowing reported last year.In the major moong and urad growing state of Rajasthan, till July 6, farmers have sown 4.90 lakh hectares of moong and 34,050 hectares of urad. This is much higher than the 3.29 lakh hectares of moong and 16,100 hectares of urad the state reported last year. The state, however, is yet to receive good rain.The next few days are going to be crucial for most farmers because if it does not rain, they would have to go in for an alternative, especially for farmers who grow moong and urad as these short duration crops prepare the fields for commercial crops like sugarcane or banana. Also, in case of a delay in rainfall, these crops would just exhibit vegetative growth with little pod formation.In areas where farmers have completed their sowing, the absence of sufficient moisture during the growth phase has become a cause for concern. Pavan Toshniwal, a dal trader and miller operating out of Gulbarga taluka in Karnataka, said the main pulse growing zone of North Karnataka had reported a reasonable amount of sowing. Moong, urad sowing is over, but there are concerns over crop condition. If it rains later, farmers would have to abandon their crop as the fields would be too muddy to work, he said, adding that most farmers were waiting for a good spell before taking on the sowing of toor and other crops.","Long dry spell leaves farmers worried, puts brakes on sowing",GREEN GRAM DAL (MOONG DAL)

At present, tur and chana are still arriving in the market but most traders are wary of procuring other pulses, stated the letter, urging the government to reconsider the decision.Similarly, the Gujarat Dal Utpadak Mandal has also asked the Centre to reconsider the move. The Mandals letter, addressed to Union minister Piyush Goyal, stated that the move would not allow the central government to fulfil its mission of doubling farmers incomes.Processors associations from Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and other states have also protested against the move.

(Representational Photo)As the monsoon gets delayed over most parts of India after a timely start, the sowing of major kharif crops has seen a dip. Irrespective of when the rains arrive now, the sowing window for crops like moong, urad and, to an extent, cotton might be too short for farmers to commence operations.The All India Crop Situation report issued by the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare shows sowing in over 499.87 lakh hectares (lh), against 558.11 lh last year, with area under almost all major crops, including moong, soyabean, paddy and cotton, reporting a dip.Last year, when there was bumper sowing of crops, farmers had planted soyabean over 92.36 lh, which is down to 82.14 lh now; moong over 13.49 lh, against 11.92 lh this year; and cotton, the major kharif cash crop, over 104.83 lh against over 86.45 lh now.Among cereal crops, bajra has been sown over 15.74 lh against 25.32 lh in 2020. Oilseeds have been sown over 112.55 lh, down from 126.13 lh in 2020. Pulses overall have also seen a dip, though minor, to over 52.49 lh from 53.35 lh last year.Sugarcane is among the few exceptions, with sowing in over 53.56 lh, against above 52.65 lh last year.In the absence of rains, farmers are either shifting to shorter-duration crops or waiting for enough soil moisture to commence sowing.Since 2020, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) is following a revised monsoon onset and withdrawal calendar, according to which the normal date for rains to reach all regions of the country is July 8. As of Friday, July 9, the country had received 229.7 mm of rainfall, 6% below the normal of 243.6 mm, with spatial distribution showing a rainfall deficit except for the first two weeks of June.Northwest India has reported the most significant deficit, of 18%. As of Friday, monsoon was delayed over Delhi, Punjab, Chandigarh, Haryana and Western Rajasthan. At -58%, Delhi is one of the most deficient states this season.Normally farmers are advised not to sow groundnut, moong and urad if there is not enough soil moisture by July 15. Cotton sowing would be hit in case the rains continue to play truant till the end of July.However, 2021 does not mark the most delayed monsoon onset in the parts of the country still to see rains. In 2012, against its normal date of June 29, Delhi had seen rains arrive on July 7.Most previous monsoons between 2010 and 2020 also saw a similar break-phase between June fourth week and early July, though none lasted beyond 11 days. This time the break has stretched to close to three weeks. The monsoon of 2013 holds the record for seeing the fastest advance over the entire country  completed in 10 days  since 1941, the IMD said.However, as per the latest weather forecast, the monsoon is all set to revive as the easterly winds have started blowing along the lower levels from the Bay of Bengal. The monsoon is likely to advance into the remaining parts of West Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, Haryana, Chandigarh, Punjab and Rajasthan by July 10, the Met offices weather report of Friday morning read.","Rains halted, sowing of almost all major kharif crops takes a big hit",GREEN GRAM DAL (MOONG DAL)

Their demand is complete repeal of these legislations. According to them, the stockholding limits go against the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.Pulses are basic and essential food items in our country, but these have been excluded from the list of essential food items under the EC (Amendment) Act, said Jagmohan Singh Patiala, general secretary, Bharti Kisan Union (BKU) Ekta (Dakaunda). Farm unions have already pointed out that the new amended Act says that its purpose is enhancing income of farmers, but the Essential Commodities (EC) Act, 1955, was never about farmers or their incomes. It was about preventing agri-business companies and big traders  which have the means to stock farmers produce  from hoarding and then selling these at higher price at the time of shortage or by creating false shortage of such items, which are the basic requirement of every consumer, including the poor, he added.But new Act has removed all these restrictions and given a free hand to agri business companies or traders to hoard such food commodities. This is why farmers are calling it the Food Hoarding (Freedom for Corporates) Act, said Satnam Singh Sahni of Samyukat Kisan Morcha (SKM).Now when the government is imposing restrictions on stock limit to control the inflation of food commodities, it means that government itself wants to stop stockists from hoarding pulses and taking control of the market, said another farm leader of SKM, Balbir Singh Rajewal, adding that price rise in retail market never benefits farmers but stockists, and badly impacts consumers, particularly the poor. The government should realize this as soon as possible and repeal these laws, he added.How can the government exclude cereals, pulses, oilseed, onion, potato from the list of essential commodities, when hoarding of these would lead to inflation? If the government needs to issue such stockholding limits orders often, then what was the need to include such clauses in the amended Act? said Sukhdev Singh Kokrikalan, general secretary, BKU Ugrahan, adding that while the Act says that the government will regulate these commodities under extraordinary circumstances, prices are rising every coming day.The Department of Consumer Affairs (DCA) had last week issued an order to impose stockholding limits on all pulses, barring moong or green gram, for a period up to October 31, 2021. The limits have been fixed at 200 tonnes for wholesale traders and importers, and 5 tonnes for retailers. The stock limit for processors/dal millers has been set at the last three months production or 25 per cent of annual installed capacity, whichever is higher.Threat to food securityFarmers said this is a threat to food security. There used to be several regulatory tools with the government in the earlier ECA 1955  licensing, price control, compulsory licensing, stocking, information collection and production for inspection records, entry/search/examination of premises and seizure etc.  but all of this is being thrown away now under the new law, said Sahni.Not only is this Act is arbitrary but another farm law  the Contract Farming Act, 2020  promotes hoarding under its section -7, which says obligation related to stock limit shall not be applicable to such quantities of farming produce as are purchased under a farming agreement entered into in accordance with the provisions of this Act, said the All Indian Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee had said in its earlier statement sent to the Centre.Such a clause of the Contract farming Act is also arbitrary and it is again a proof of the governments hasty decision of bringing such laws and overlapping the provisions of one law with the other to complicate the matter for every one, said a farmer, adding that the government should shun its ego in the larger interest of the poor of this country as well as farmers and general consumers.The Essential Commodities Act, 2020","In pulses’ stock limit order, govt admission that not all right with agri laws: farm unions",GREEN GRAM DAL (MOONG DAL)

Several of the leaders of these groups visited the temple on Sunday and sought blessings of the deities.Result of RT-PCR tests of 139 sailors and sadhus who will be participating in the procession arrived on Sunday, and all have tested negative for Covid-19, said a temple official. The procession will only have five vehicles including three chariots pulled by the sailors and a car with Mahant Dilipdasji and trustee Mahendra Jha.On Sunday, hundreds of devotees thronged the temple to have a glimpse of Sona Vesh (golden attire) of the deities that takes place only once a year. The chariots were brought inside the temple premises by the sailors as the decking up started by the devotees. The decked-up elephants were also brought inside the temple premises after they were painted by the mahouts and volunteer artists.With fresh spell of rains on Sunday night, the authorities are expected to review the waterlogging on the route as the chariots will roll after Pahind ritual by CM Vijay Rupani and deputy CM Nitin Patel at 7am on Monday.

WITH THE much-awaited revival of the monsoon, most parts of the country is reporting good rainfall from Sunday. Parts of Maharashtra have, in fact, reported very heavy rainfall, which has led to local administration evacuating people from low-lying areas. Farmers in most parts of the country are keeping their fingers crossed in the hope that good soil moisture will help them continue with their sowing operations.  Since Sunday, most parts of peninsular India started reporting rainfall. In Maharashtra, rain pounded parts of Marathwada and Vidarbha, which has come as a great relief to farmers in the area. The district of Parbhani has reported a cloud burst like situation with various parts reporting over 150 mm rainfall in a matter of few hours. District collector Deepak Muglikar said an irrigation canal was damaged, which led to flooding in low-lying areas. Close to 200 families were evacuated with ongoing relief work.  Rainfall data issued by India Meteorological Department states that the monsoon has progressed to the northern part of the country. As of Monday, the northern limit of the monsoon was passing Aligarh, Jaisalmer, Nagaur, Bharatpur, Karnal and Gangan-agar. The country, as a whole, has received 252.6 mm rainfall, as against the normal 270.9 mm. States like Gujarat (-40 per cent), Rajasthan (-30 per cent), Haryana (-41 per cent), Punjab (-38 per cent) have reported large deficit in rainfall. Only some states like Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Bihar have reported excess.  Given moisture stress, farmers have stopped their sowing activities.

Managing the bodys immunity levels post-Covid through a nutritionist-recommended diet is necessary to keep other health complications away. This is especially important with the expectation of the third wave hitting us soon. Further, the use of steroids to recover from Covid can cause spikes in blood sugar levels for a few months and this needs to be managed with a diet and expert medical advice.  The recovery rate of Sars-Cov 2 patients has increased significantly. The data shared by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare indicates that more than 95 per cent of COVID-19 patients are recovering from the ailment. However, they are not free from the threat of other life-threatening diseases. While there is no substitute for medicines, managing diabetes is possible with diet regulation. It is important for people with diabetes to realign their diet plan after recovering from COVID-19. A balanced diet can help them heal quickly and stay protected from other infections, said Sujata Sharma, nutritionist & diabetes educator, BeatO.  Breakfast  Breakfast is an essential part of our diet, which should be taken within two hours of waking up, between 8:00-9:00 am. It reinvigorates our body with a fresh stream of energy by restoring glucose levels and reducing stress; hence, we must choose the components meticulously. A diabetes patient recovering from COVID-19 should choose from the following breakfast options: one bowl of oats with skimmed milk (adding berries and nuts is optional) or vegetable besan cheela or vegetable moong dal cheela or two pieces of multigrain dosa and one bowl of quinowa or boiled chana and moong chaat with vegetables or two egg white omelettes. Pairing any of these with buttermilk can complete the breakfast.  Mid-morning snack  The gap between breakfast and lunch must be covered with some nutritious snack (11:30 am). About 100 gm fruits (apple/ guava/ pear/ strawberries/ berries/ papaya/ watermelon) or nuts and seeds are most suitable for a mid-morning snack.  Lunch  As the day progresses, the body needs the energy to continue its functioning. A wholesome lunch fulfils these requirements while providing a break (between 1:30-2:30 pm). An ideal lunch should consist of one plate of salad, one bowl of green vegetable/dal or homemade chicken, low-fat curd or cucumber raita and multigrain chapatti (1-2) or one bowl of brown rice.  Evening snacks  As the day progresses towards dusk (4:30-5:30 pm), it is necessary to restore energy levels. This light snack can consist of tea without sugar/buttermilk or a handful of roasted makhana or chana or roasted/grilled/toasted paneer cubes or fruits 100 gm or chicken soup or multigrain biscuit or yoghurt with berries.  Dinner  Dinner is an important meal, one of the last food items that an individual eats. Ideally, dinner should be consumed between 7:30 to 8:30 pm and should consist of a plate of salad plus one bowl of green vegetable/paneer gravy/homemade chicken/fish gravy plus 50-100 gm of curd plus one bowl of moong dal khichdi/ vegetable oats khichdi or one to two slices of multigrain chapatti/jowar chapatti/bajra chapatti.  Post-dinner snack  The ideal post-dinner snack is a glass of skimmed/toned milk that can be taken if the individual feels hungry.  Following this diet plan, along with medication and physical exercises, can minimise the various health risks for diabetes patients recovering from COVID-19.",Post-Covid diet for people with chronic conditions: What foods to eat and when,GREEN GRAM DAL (MOONG DAL)

Less than 15% of the beneficiaries have received the food kit with just 10 days left for the festival.  The Food and Civil Supplies Department, which had launched the State-wide programme on July 31, hoped to complete distribution among priority categories, chiefly Antodaya Anna Yojana (AAY) (yellow) and priority household (pink) card holders by August 7. However, the disbursal rate among such sections that came under the ambit of the National Food Security Act, 2013, remained poor. Only 10.54 lakh out of the 38.30 lakh beneficiaries in these categories have received the kits as on 1 p.m. on Tuesday.  Shortage of items  According to reliable sources, the shortage of cashew nuts, green gram cardamom has affected the distribution. While the Kerala State Civil Supplies Corporation (Supplyco), which has been tasked with preparing the kits, has been receiving sizeable stock of green gram and cardamom in the last few days, the failure to obtain cashew nuts in bulk has disrupted the distribution of kits among ration outlets.  However, Supplyco chairman and managing director P.M. Ali Asgar Pasha maintained that there was sufficient availability of all items required for the kits. He attributed the low distribution rate to the failure of the public to adhere to the days allotted for various categories. The drive usually picked up pace from the second week, he said.  In all, 11.24 lakh people out of the 90.96 lakh ration card holders in the State have been provided so far. The government had hoped to complete the distribution by August 16. Specific days had been allotted for each ration card categories in order to prevent crowding. Such plans have, however, gone kaput.  Public anger  All Kerala Retail Ration Dealers Association general secretary T. Muhammedali said the shortage of kits has led to the public venting their ire on ration dealers. The situation is expected to worsen with non-priority card holders beginning to seek their allocated kits. He urged the government to extend the deadline for the distribution drive.

But is it not just on the face, acne can occur anywhere on the body, including the back and chest. This type of acne, hence, is called body acne.  What are the causes?  According to ayurvedic practitioner Dr Shyam VL, body acne is caused by the same factors that trigger acne on the face: overactive oil glands, excess dead skin cells, and a proliferation of acne-causing bacteria. Additionally, it can also be a result of increased sweating and friction from clothing.  As the bacteria multiply in a clogged pore, the pore becomes inflamed. An acne cyst forms when inflammation reaches deep into the skin. Cysts can be very painful. People often see permanent scarring after this type of acne heals, he wrote on Instagram.

2021-08-13,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/papads-pickles-and-partition-a-sindhi-reminiscence/article35891955.ece,"Way back, in the Sindh province, the papad was not just an accompaniment to meals but was offered as a snack to guests along with a glass of water  All three mealtimes at my home  yes, breakfast too  are usually marked with a query of how many papads will be needed at the table. The younger generation requests a particular, rather popular, peppery brand and instantly the voice of a rabbit singing its name echoes in my head. Spouse and I settle for the equally famous Sindhi papad.  The Sindhi papad is unique. It is an amalgamated version of its Punjabi and Rajasthani cousins: it has the urad dal and pepper of the former, and the moong dal and jeera of the latter. Way back in the Sindh province, it was not just an accompaniment to meals, but served to guests on its own as a snack with water. To combat the extremes of climate, its salty flavour compensated for the loss of sodium from the body during sweaty summers while the jeera and pepper fought phlegm in severe winters. Its history is not all innocent. Apparently, prospective brides at one time would be asked to roast a papad over a direct flame to judge their culinary skills.  Scattered community  Partition proved tragic for Sindhis. Unlike the Punjabis, they had no home state to come to. They scattered all over the country and the globe and had to start from scratch as refugees, having been forced to leave all their property and wealth behind. My mother was 14 when her family fled to save their lives. She clearly remembered how the women in her family dipped gold coins in gram flour batter and fried them as pakoras to slip them undetected across the newly formed border. My paternal grandmother sold her thick gold bangle at a refugee camp in Bombay to buy butter and ghee: a far cry from her earlier days when even the vark on sweets was a thin sheet of beaten real gold.  As the business-based community struggled to make ends meet, many of its enterprising women made and sold papads and pickles to keep the kitchen fires burning. The Sindhi pickle is also unique, being oil-less, with carrots, small onions, cauliflower, and sometimes turnips, okra, dry dates and lotus stems, pickled in vinegar and spices.  I once asked my mother why we bought papads and didnt make them at home like many other families. She said that my father had once witnessed how tedious the procedure was and made her swear that she would never ever make them. However, I did get to try my hand at making papads in my in-laws place. But there was a problem. The papad dough was so tasty that I used to pop most of into my mouth, leaving very little to be rolled into papads. Years later, I was thrilled to find the finely kneaded dough of Sindhi papads being sold in Ahmedabad. The shopkeeper told me that it was mostly bought to be eaten as is than to be made into papad!  Often the butt of jokes for their love of papad, many Sindhis claim that it is their favourite chakhna with their daily peg or two. As for me, I relish my papads in this rainy weather  not fried in oil or roasted over a flame but cooked Sindhi style, over a hot tawa dabbed with a few drops of oil. I recall one of my mothers fondest memories. Her toothless grandmother would ask her to crush the papad into a fine powder between her palms so that she could enjoy it without hurting her gums. I often wonder if I too will be as addicted to it if I live to that ripe old age.  Sunday Recipe  Sindhi Papad  Photo: Wiki Commons  Ingredients  1 kg urad dal  1/4 kg moong dal  150 gm chaaniyo (papad khar/soda)  available in Sindhi grocery stores  3 tbsp peppercorns (coarsely ground)  3 tbsp cumin seeds  1/4 tsp cooking soda  1/2 tsp asafoetida  Salt to taste  Method  1. Wipe the dals with a clean dry napkin and keep them in bright sunlight for a couple of hours.  2. Mix both the dals and grind to make a fine flour.  3. Mix the chaaniyo in a glass of water and bring to boil. Cool, strain and keep aside.  4. Mix all the other ingredients with the dal flour. Make a firm dough using the chaaniyo water and a little water too as required.  5. Press and knead the dough for about 10-15 minutes to smoothen it as much as possible.  6. Take small portions of the dough and make thin rolls in the shape of kababs of 1 inch thickness. Cut the rolls into 1/2-inch parts with a knife.  7. Use a rolling pin to roll out each part into a flat and thin roundel.  8. Place on a clean dry mat in direct sunlight, flipping them a couple of times over the next two to three hours.  9. When completely dry, store in airtight containers  10. When required, fry in hot oil, roast on a tawa, or over a flame.

2021-08-28,https://indianexpress.com/article/india/august-dries-up-hopes-of-farmers-monsoon-revival-key-to-kharif-fortune-7475921/,"Rao Gulab Singh Lodhi planted soyabean on 12 out of his 16-acre land on July 11, a day before the southwest monsoon revived after a three-week-long break phase.  It rained well in the first half of June. But we were advised on DD Kisan channel not to sow, as those rains were due to the Cyclone (Yaas) and wouldnt last, says this farmer from Nanhegaon village of Madhya Pradeshs Narsinghpur district. The strong rains on July 12-13 were followed by rimjhim baarish (intermittent showers) throughout July.  However, August has been poora sookha (totally dry). If it doesnt rain in the next seven days, my soyabean crop (which has completed flowering and is in early pod formation stage) will fail, fears Lodhi, who sowed moong (green gram) in his balance 4 acres on August 15. The maturity period for soyabean is 90-94 days and moong about 75 days.  Lodhis worry encapsulates the situation for Indias kharif (monsoon) season crop. An extended dry spell from around June 20 to July 11 resulted in farmers missing the main kharif sowing window between mid-June and mid-July. The monsoons revival, though, led to brisk plantings. By July 30, the cumulative area under kharif crops, at 848.15 lakh hectares (lh), was only 4.7% lower compared to the 889.99 lh during the corresponding period of 2020. This gap has further narrowed (1,064.04 lh versus 1,083.09 lh) as on August 27, according to the Union Agriculture Ministry.

Rao Gulab Singh Lodi at his soybean field in Nanhegaon village of Madhya Pradeshs Narsinghpur district.  But what is of concern is rainfall in August being 26.4% deficient for the country as a whole. The overall area-weighted cumulative precipitation from June 1 to August 28 has been 9.6% below the normal long period average. The crop whose sowing was already delayed is currently facing moisture stress. All hopes are on a low pressure area formed over North-west and West-central Bay of Bengal off the Odisha and Andhra Pradesh coasts. The India Meteorological Department expects this system to bring enhanced rainfall activity over Southern Peninsular India till August 30 and over Central and West India from August 29 onwards.  A quick revival of the monsoon is what Munna Ughreja is also desperately seeking. The 32-year-old from Sultanpur village in Gujarats Morbi district has sown cotton on 100 out of his total 200-bigha (80 acres) holding. On the balance, he has planted groundnut and soyabean on 40 bigha each and sesamum on 20 bigha. On Saturday, Ughreja participated in a rally of farmers from 14 villages of Morbis Maliya taluka, demanding release of water into the Maliya Branch Canal of the Narmada dam project.  Gujarat, unlike most other states, recorded deficient rainfall even during July. We had a good spell in June. But it has hardly rained in the last 72 days, barring a light drizzle early this month. If there are no rains or no release of Narmada water now, our crops will completely wilt, Ughreja told The Indian Express over phone.  Water from the Sardar Sarovar Dam irrigates some parts of Saurashtra (Morbi, Surendranagar, Botad and Bhavnagar districts) and Kutch (Rapar, Bhachau and Anjar talukas). But given the poor rainfall in the Narmada catchment areas, the Gujarat government has decided to prioritise supplies for drinking water over irrigation.  High prices for crops  especially soyabean and also groundnut and cotton  had made farmers keen to take up sowing this time. Kapas (raw un-ginned cotton) and groundnut are trading at Rs 7,000 per quintal levels each, way above their respective government-declared minimum support price of Rs 5,726 and Rs 5,500. Its even better in soyabean, which is quoting at Rs 6,700-7,400 per quintal at Narsinghpurs Kareli wholesale mandi, as against the MSP of Rs 3,950.  What use are these prices if there isnt any crop to harvest?, quips Lodhi. The same sentiment is shared by Ughreja. He had sown soyabean for the first time after his groundnut crop suffered damage for two consecutive years  from excessive rains. I took soyabean because the price was excellent and it can also tolerate excess rains better than groundnut. But my experiment looks like failing, he admits.","August dries up hopes of farmers, monsoon revival key to kharif fortune",GREEN GRAM DAL (MOONG DAL)
2021-10-29,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/how-a-packet-of-rock-sugar-in-my-kitchen-brought-back-memories-of-childhood-temple-visits/article37226466.ece,"Kalkandu is apparently a favourite of the gods too  Organising my kitchen cupboards is a mundane task, but sometimes it is surprisingly rewarding. Ingredients that I never find when I need them materialise like Banquos ghost in Macbeth, but with happier consequences. On one recent cleaning effort I chanced upon a packet of kalkandu or mishri, rock sugar. It transported me back to childhood when temple visits were often rewarded with crinkly yellow-cellophane wrapped treasures of khajoor (dry dates), mishri, raisins and cashew. They stayed fresh for a long time, though I did not usually put them to the test. The thought of rolling around an oversized chunk of rock sugar in my mouth till it dissolved brought so much joy.  Kalkandu is apparently a favourite of the gods too. In my 2019 travels across India exploring sacred food offerings, I learnt of a delicious sounding naivedyam using kalkandu in several ancient temples in Tamil Nadu. I particularly remember an early morning visit to Thillai Kali Amman Kovil, a Shakti Peetham located a short distance from the famous Chidambaram Nataraja temple. Legend speaks of the celestial dance competition between Shiva and Kali, where the goddess is defeated and banished from Thillai to where the Kali Amman temple is now located.  After my darshan of the goddess, the gurukkal (priest) gave me a donnai or leaf bowl filled with steaming hot kalkandu sakkarai pongal. This is a concoction of rice, passi paruppu (moong dal), rock sugar and ghee, garnished with plump fried raisins and fragrant with saffron, cardamom and pachchai karpooram (edible camphor). Kalkandu sakkarai pongal is better known as a signature item in the naivedyam of the Chidambaram temple.  Kongu cuisine  I first tasted this flavourful sweet while staying with my friend, Mangalam, during the Pongal/ Sankranti festival. Her home town, like mine, is Coimbatore, once part of the ancient Kongu Nadu region. Kalkandu pongal is a popular item in this regions cuisine. Mangalams mother prepared a different pongal for each day of the festival: the usual jaggery-based sakkarai pongal with rice and lentils, millet pongal with karuppatti (palm jaggery), savoury ven pongal, and my favourite, kalkandu sakkarai pongal, with brown rock sugar. I was happy that she did not add edible camphor: though reminiscent of temple prasadam, camphor, if not used judiciously, can overwhelm all other flavours and ruin the dish.  Several variations are possible in the preparation of kalkandu pongal. Kalkandu sadam, for instance, has rice (no lentils) cooked in milk. Powdered rock sugar is added, followed by saffron, cardamom and a garnish of ghee-fried raisins and cashew. Alternatively, rice may be cooked in water and milk added (or not) later. Kalkandu may be powdered, melted into a thin syrup, or used as is. While saffron and cardamom are standard ingredients, nutmeg may or may not be included.  Unique flavours  In the southern States, sakkarai pongal, with rice, moong dal, milk and jaggery, is a popular preparation for bhog/ naivedya in homes and temples. Rich with ghee and studded with fried cashew and raisins, it is an all-time favourite, and kalkandu sakkarai pongal is an interesting alternative, with rock sugar, saffron, cardamom and nutmeg each contributing their unique flavour.  The packet of rock sugar in my kitchen brought instant memories of this delectable dish and I put it to good use in a recipe broadly similar to the one used in the Chidambaram temple.  I use my grandmothers vengala paanai or bronze pot to make the pongal. It is heavy-bottomed and allows the dish to slow-cook on low heat. Alternatively, rice and dal may be pressure-cooked and other ingredients added (as in the recipe below). In this recipe, kalkandu may be powdered. However, when the crystal chunks are allowed to dissolve gradually in cooked rice it brings a special flavour. Stirring the saffron gently into the pongal helps it infuse the rice with its aroma and colour, giving the sakkarai pongal its classic pale yellow hue.  Chidambaram temple Kalkandu Sakkarai Pongal  Ingredients  Rice  cup  Passi paruppu/ split moong - 2 tablespoons  Kalkandu/mishri - 3/4 cup  Salt - 1 pinch  Saffron - 4-5 strands  Ghee - 1 teaspoon + 2 tablespoons  Cardamom - powdered 1 pinch  Nutmeg - powdered 1 pinch  Cashew, raisins - a few  Method  1. Soak rice and dal separately for 20 minutes. Drain.  2. Roast dal in 1 teaspoon of ghee. Add rice, roast for 2 minutes.  3. Cook rice and dal till soft. Mash well while hot.  4. Add kalkandu. Let it dissolve (about 10 minutes on low heat). Stir frequently.  5. Add salt, stir.  6. Add saffron, stir for 2 minutes.  7. Add cardamom, nutmeg. Stir.  8. Fry cashew and raisins in ghee. Add them (with ghee) to pongal.

2021-11-01,https://indianexpress.com/article/lifestyle/health/diwali-season-healthy-eating-habits-desserts-7597004/,"In India, festival time is when people tend to stray from healthy eating habits and allow themselves to binge-eat, and eat unhealthy food that is typically not a part of their everyday diet. While occasional cheat-meals are okay, one must also learn to consciously stay away from foods that can harm their health and lead to lifelong issues.  As we await Diwali, Minal Shah, senior nutrition therapist, Fortis Hospital, Mulund shares some pointers on how one can enjoy the festival of lights, keep their taste buds happy and also not compromise on health.  ALSO READ | This festive season, balance your cravings with these simple tips  Here are a few pointers for enjoying guilt-free desserts:  1. Choose a milk-based dessert like shrikhand, sandesh, mishit doi, kheer, etc. Milk is a good source of first-class protein, and these desserts can easily be made at home with any modifications that we desire.  2. Sugar can be replaced with natural flavoring agents like cinnamon, nutmeg, dry fruits like dates, raisins, and fresh fruits. To an extent, jaggery and honey can also be opted over refined sugar, but with quantity restriction.  3. Make a healthier choice among existing desserts.   Choose badam katli (omega-3 fatty acids) over kaju katli.   Choose besan ladoo (protein) or peanut ladoo (MUFA) over rava ladoo, Mysore pak (protein) over coconut ladoo.   Choose carrot halwa or dudhi halwa (antioxidants/vitamins) or moong dal sheera (protein) over rava sheera.   Choose payasam over a regular rice kheer.  4. Try something new and unconventional with a functional food added to it. Like dates sesame ladoo, oats dates nut ladoo, walnut ladoo, methi kheer, dudhi kheer, apple sheera, fruit kheer, papaya halwa, beetroot halwa, carrot kalakand, oats pancakes with cranberry syrup or blueberry syrup or chocolate syrup, homemade protein bars, apple pie, pumpkin pie, fruit yogurt, seeds chikki (pumpkin/sunflower/flaxseed).  5. Consider the portion size. There may be desserts which are high in fats like jalebi, malpua, gulab jamun, gulpapdi, sheera etc. If its your favourite, reduce the portion size. Cut smaller pieces to reduce the calorie intake.  6. Also, remember the basics  add a good bowl of salad with different coloured vegetables and fruits to ensure healthy fibre in every meal.  7. Add fillers for yourself and your guests, which are low in calories and tasty as well like ginger lemonade, virgin pina colada, kiwi margarita, masala milk, thandai, milkshake with fennel seeds, falooda, cucumber mint cooler, tomato mocktail, etc.   For more lifestyle news, follow us on Instagram | Twitter | Facebook and dont miss out on the latest updates!","This Diwali season, incorporate these healthy eating habits",GREEN GRAM DAL (MOONG DAL)

This year, the auspicious occasion falls on November 2, 2021.  It is believed that on this day, the Goddess of Wealth, Lakshmi, had emerged from the ocean during the churning of milk. Hence, Lakshmi and Kubera  the God of Wealth  are worshipped on this day. However, Lakshmi puja performed on amavasya  two days after Dhantrayodashi  is considered more significant.  ALSO READ | This Diwali season, incorporate these healthy eating habits  This day is deemed highly auspicious to invest in gold and silver, and buy utensils for ones home, too. According to mythology, King Himas 16-year-old son was to die on the fourth night of his marriage as a result of snake bite. To save his life, his wife collected all her gold ornaments and gold coins in a heap. She then sang songs and narrated stories to her husband so he doesnt fall asleep. When Yamaraj, the god of death, came in the form of a serpent to take the princes life, he was blinded by the shine of the gold and sat enchanted listening to the melodious music and stories.  Since then, in a tradition called Yamadeepdan, people light diyas on this day throughout the night to worship Yamaraj and ward off evil.  According to drikpanchang.com, Dhanteras puja muhurat is from 06.17 pm to 08.11 pm on November 2, 2021.  Lakshmi puja on Dhanteras is ideally done during pradosh kaal that lasts for two hours and 24 minutes. It is believed that during this time, the sthir lagna prevails, which means the time is auspicious and the Goddess is likely to stay in your house, as per drikpanchang.com.  The puja preparations entail keeping a red cloth on the right hand side of a raised platform, and installing idols of Lakshmi and Ganesha on it. The idols must be decorated with fine clothes. Next, a white cloth should be placed on the left hand side of the platform for installing the Navgraha gods.  Cereals including wheat, urad dal, moong dal, gram, barley and masoor dal are used along with marigold flowers while performing puja. Small footprints using vermillion and rice flour are made on the entrances to show the joyous arrival of the long-awaited Lakshmi.  In addition, they draw intricate rangoli designs at the entrances of workplaces and houses to welcome the goddess. Traditional sweets, called naivedyam made by mixing dry coriander seeds with jaggery, cows milk and saffron are prepared on this day.

It had only been a couple of weeks since Bikanervala, the Delhi-headquartered sweets brand, established its first store in the city on College Road in Nungambakkam  right in time for the Deepavali celebrations  and loyal customers of the brand were still trickling in, consistently.  The century-old brand has already brought its recipes of sweets, snacks, chaat, and food to multiple states  Rajasthan, Delhi, Madya Pradesh, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Haryana, Uttarakhand and more  as well as many other countries, including Nepal, UAE, United States of America, New Zealand and Singapore.  After setting up the Hyderabad branch, this is their second attempt to bring North Indian specialities to the South Indian market. With the aid of the festival time, the brand has welcomed a warm response, as expected according to a staff member. The overall response was exactly how we had hoped. Chennai already has a lot of South Indian food but they were seeking North Indian options. We hope the guests here are satisfied with quality food and proper service, he says, adding that the standard operating procedures and recipes remain the same across all Bikarnervala establishments.  We interspersed our conversation with some raj kachori and bhalla papdi that  though missing the typical north Indian flavour-packed punch  were well-balanced with the savouriness of the puri and filling (kachori) and bhalla, and the sweet, sour and spicy of the chutneys playing with the cold dahi (yogurt). The starters were followed by the tandoori platter and South Indian platter. I must be honest, serving a South Indian platter in Chennai as a north Indian brand was a bold choice. But according to the store manager, this was a deliberate one.  The South Indian platter has a different taste from what is available here. You get a North Indian taste of it instead, he says. He wasnt wrong. The chole bhature and some ras malai were the finishers. While the meal did not wow, it also did not disappoint. However, those comparing to the authentic North Indian flavours may be in for an underwhelming performance.  For the meal, we were seated on the first floor. The store was adequately staffed for the day, especially with the Deepavali festivities setting the fiesta feast mood. This, however, was not the case when another Chennai resident, Radhika Madhavan, visited during the pre-Deepavali weekend. We liked their Hyderabad outlet and so, we were looking forward to this branch. Unfortunately, there was only one person handling the crowd and it soon became evident that he was giving preferential treatment to those who had come to Chennai from north India. Furthermore, there were many options but only a few available. But, the portions and snacks are good, she shares.  The store is focusing on retail sales. Those who come for lunch and dinner often also indulge in their sweets and snacks, mentions an employee. It offers 400-500 varieties of sweets, including kaju katli, moong dal ka halwa, boondi ke ladoo, rasgulla etc. and can also customise some on request.

2021-11-18,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/meat-analogue-vegan-plant-based-foods-in-india-2021/article37539233.ece,"Accelerated by the pandemic and powered by environmentalists, we look back on a 2021 that saw launches of appetising alternatives such as plant-based kebabs, eggs and other mock meats  Pea protein mince, soy meat patties, legume-based eggs, plant derived fish fingers... the meat analogue platter is growing.  There is a huge tailwind for plant-based meats in India, says Abhishek Sinha, CEO, GoodDot, a plant-based meat company from Udaipur that introduced UnMutton Keema on World Vegan Day, November 1. It took his company nearly three-and-a-half years to develop the product and the R&D team is in the final stages of launching plant-based scrambled eggs, omelette, fish fingers and shrimp cutlets.  Similarly, to commemorate the day dedicated to veganism, Chirag Kenia, founder, Urban Platter, a platform for all gourmet and culinary requirements, in Bengaluru, too introduced meatless plant-based burger patties. He says, The plant-based market in India is hungry for diverse options, especially in protein alternatives and were just getting started.  Last month, Imagine Meats founded by Bollywood actors Riteish and Genelia Deshmukh, launched a range of nine plant-based products, which include keema, seekh kebabs, nuggets and sausages, as well as full meals like Afghan and Chettinad biriyani.  Also Read | India leans into better vegan options, seeing a rise in home grown mock meats, dairy-free cheese and desserts  A year old in this space, Mumbai-based Blue Tribe Foods too introduced a range of look like, feel like, smell like, and taste like plant-derived chicken nuggets and sausages. The market is getting innovative with products such as legume-based liquid egg, by Kartik Dixit and Shraddha Bhansalis Evo Foods in Mumbai.  A love for animals, the impact of the meat industry on environment and a conscious move to eat healthy, combine to power this trend globally and the focus of innovation in food is shifting to Asia, say industry watchers.  Kartik stresses on the fact that the egg similitude is made completely from Indian legumes like chickpea, moong and peas, adding that nutrition is their focus. He says a plant-based egg has 11 grams of protein and is at par with an organic egg that has protein, anywhere, between 10 to 12 grams. A 500 millilitre bottle of liquid egg is equivalent to 10 or 11 eggs. Trials are on to make the product more baking friendly, he adds.  Kartik turned vegan five years ago and believes that if the pandemic made people realise the damage from animal agriculture to the environment, it also made them think of rearing animals in coops and closely, of zoonotic transmissions, antibiotic resistance and maladies that can wipe out our race itself.  New developments  Chirag estimates a 15% increase in Flexitarians  people who are vegetarian, non-vegetarian and vegan  to experiment with and opt for more plant-based alternatives. After he turned vegan four years ago, he added more plant-based options to his diet. According to him the pandemic gave people the time to consciously think about their diet and e-commerce made it possible to deliver these curated foods to homes.  Abhishek agrees, pointing to a massive jump in awareness in the last one year: It has skyrocketed, almost a 500 to 800 % increase.  A non-vegetarian, Abhisheks interest in the field arose from his love for animals. While he was doing his engineering in 2003, he came across a study titled In Vitro Meat, by three Dutch inventors  Willem Van Eelen, Willem Van Kooten and Wiete Westerhof  on cultured meat created from tissue. It fascinated me and set me thinking, we could make meat using plant tissue; this was the perfect solution for a person like me, who enjoys eating meat but does not want to hurt or kill an animal, says Abhishek. He founded the company in 2016 with his friend Deepak Parihar.  Sohil Wazir, CCO, Blue Tribe, believes that this trend is driven by two factors: Anti-cruelty movement towards animals and the growing awareness of the high carbon footprint of the meat industry. About 2-3% of the population is aware of the implications of the meat industry on the environment, he says. Animal agriculture contributes to the second largest carbon emissions after fossil fuels.  Genelia discloses a defining moment in her familys turn towards a plant-based diet, recalling a remark that was casually made by her son: We cant have a pet dog and eat chicken at the same time. It hit me so hard, she says adding that Riteish, a meat lover, too wanted to have guilt-free meat.  Overcoming hurdles  Development of plant-based meats is the biggest challenge for the industry that works closely with food and material scientists, chefs, and investors. Abhishek adds that the second biggest challenge is creating awareness of the product but the pandemic has helped in this.  Protein extracted from plants is converted into meat analogue by a process of denaturation where protein linkages are altered using heat and pressure. It is then realigned to match the structure of meat.  It took nine months for Chirag and his brother Dhaval, who set up Urban Platter as an e-commerce platform in 2015, to develop the burger from textured soy proteins. Currently working on developing vegan mayonnaise and butter, the company sources almost 90% of the ingredients locally.  Whats cooking?  Working in the labs of Blue Tribe, chef Nirvaan Thacker who partners QSR, Zaatar and Mozza in Mumbai speaks of the challenges of cooking with mock meats.  Pea and soy are fundamentally different; the meat tends to react differently when used in a Bolognaise sauce or in a lighter preparation like broth. We are working towards addressing these factors, says Nirvaan. He adds that the speed of development of the ingredients has increased in the last six months and that with every trial, he is able to better the product. By Christmas, he says, they could easily move from working with mince to larger chunks of meats, a chicken roast perhaps.  Transitioning to a vegan lifestyle, Pune-based Raina Joseph tried plant-based keema with parathas. She says, Despite being a non-vegetarian, I could not differentiate between meat keema and the UnMutton keema. The texture was chewy, stretchy, the way meat is supposed to be.

And he believes you should too.  A professor of Economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Abhijit Banerjee, shared the 2019 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences with Esther Duflo and Michael Kemer for their experimental approach to alleviating global poverty. (Esther, also an MIT economist, is married to Abhijit.)  (Stay up to date on new book releases, reviews, and more with The Hindu On Books newsletter. Subscribe here.)  His latest project, a whimsical cookbook titled Cooking to Save Your Life (published by Juggernaut) is punctuated with humour and exuberant drawings by Cheyenne Olivier. It seems like a dramatic departure from his work as an economist and social scientist. He does not think so.  In an interview from Delhi  he and Cheyenne are cooking up imaginative multi-course meals in India as part of the book tour  Abhijit explains how the book is connected to his work as an economist. We are exploring the social dimension of cooking. I thought it would be boring to just write recipes, to be honest. I wanted to spice it up for myself. So every chapter has an introduction, which is more social science...  The book introduces dishes tailored for specific occasions  from raspberry ceviche for when you invite the boss home to masala chips, tossed with minced onions, green chillies and chaat masala, for the kind of enemy you have to invite home from time to time. Abhijit adds,  You are cooking for a reason: because you have someone you want to impress, or someone you are scared of...  The book cover | Photo Credit: special arrangement  In an age of restaurant dinners and takeaway, he is hoping to convince readers, especially kitchen novices, to discover the satisfaction of creating delicious meals for friends and family. I cook every single day, he says, We dont really go out. We just eat at home. It is my relaxation when I return from work. Describing their weekly menus, he says, We get back from work by about 6.30 pm, then I start cooking. Three days a week, I make Indian food, a vegetable, dal and meat. Otherwise its pasta, some soup and salad, or Asian food, like stir fries.  Abhijit started cooking when he was about 15 years old, in Kolkata. My mother would often travel on work, and then the choice was between the cook, who was very nice and competent but unwilling to experiment, or me making different things.  When he took over the kitchen, the dining table was laid with lots of roasts, cakes and pastries. Some learnt from watching my mother, some from recipe books.  Decades later, he has developed a fresh appreciation for simple Indian food. I consider dal to be Indias greatest contribution yet to human civilisation. Ahead of chess and zero... often also the tastiest dish in a meal, a tribute to the creativity of a billion cash-strapped cooks, he says in the book, giving the recipe for his favourite comfort food, Bengali mung dal spiked with lemon.  Cooking amidst chaos  The recipes are charming and irreverent, a collection of tweaked classics and innovative staples, focussing on practical ways to get impressive results, in the midst of the chaos of everyday life. Cheyenne, who was Abhijit and Esthers au pair and lived with the couple for three years, chuckles about how cooking on the book tour was simple in comparison to their meals at home. Most of the time we do the cooking between giving the kids a bath, answering calls...This was easy. We actually had way too much time!  Her illustrations are deliberately light, playful and accessible. Photographs are too idealistic. The reality is you are coming home from work, the kids are around, you are tired... you are cooking in the middle of all that, she says.  Cheyenne Olivier | Photo Credit: special arrangement  The recipes are cleverly constructed, using everyday as well as exotic ingredients and simple techniques. Charred avocados with tahini and pomegranate molasses for instance. Or Ambur biryani, which the book promises takes less than 40 minutes to assemble, with a pressure cooker. And that pandemic staple, made in Abhijits home almost once a week: banana bread, but with almond flour.  We were in France, in Provence though the pandemic, and there was nothing much to do. Though most things were closed, the vegetable markets, butchers and fish mongers were open. We took advantage of that, says Abhijit. Cheyenne adds, It cheered us up through the pandemic.  Abhijit has a lot more recipes up his sleeve, but is non-committal about writing a sequel, because, this book is not just about the recipes. It is the whole structure around it that makes it a book.

Revel in their familiar rhythm again over filter coffee and pizza idlis  Sri Sasthalaya Catering, Narada Gana Sabha  After two years, catering contractor Ramesh Krishnan and his team are back: and they are determined to make it a memorable Margazhi. Sri Sasthalaya Catering, who have been running sabha canteens for seven years, will be serving an elaborate lunch at the venue for the first time.  We have been granted permission to serve ela sappad (a traditional lunch on a banana leaf), says Ramesh Krishnan, the proprietor. He adds, We usually serve mini lunch on plates, but this year we are looking forward to serving a freshly made, authentic kalyana sappad (wedding style lunch). The menu will be diverse, with different types of rasam, sambar, vetha kulambu and moru kulambu. There will be a variety of thogayal (lentil based chutnies) and payasams everyday.  He promises that the menus will be non-repetitive, with mavadu (tender mango pickle) and veppalakatti (a traditional dry pickle made with lime leaves) readied exclusively for the meals.  Starting from 6am, the canteen will serve piping hot Chettinad specials such as vella appam, kuzhi paniyaram, appam and idiyappam. They are also launching pizza idlis: idlis steamed in circular plates, topped with mixed vegetables and loaded with cheese. Still in a Mc Sabha frame of mind? Try their cheese idlis as well.  Of course all idlis, even the ones with American accents, must come with chutney and coffee. We are serving ginger chutney, tomato kara chutney, Kumbakonam kadappa (a regional speciality made with moong dal, coconut, spices and mixed vegetables) and Chettinad masala kulambu (an aromatic gravy with vegetables, made with freshly ground coconut and spices), says Ramesh.  As for dessert, as always he says their khoa jangri is what steals the show year after year. Pricing is deliberately competitive. Sabha canteens are an opportunity for caterers like us to find new customers that may bring in business for the rest of the year, says Ramesh. Therefore my focus is to impress the customers with our food, and definitely not profit.  Dont forget to try the coffee, the kiosk is always a major crowd puller here.We source high quality coffee beans from a single estate in Coorg and cows milk from local suppliers, says Ramesh. We start serving coffee as early as 5am.  Although this has been a year of takeaway, Ramesh is determined to keep the experience personal, and packaging free: We want rasikas to come to the venue, enjoy the fresh, hot meal served on the banana leaf and experience authentic Chennai hospitality. Therefore we will not be offering take away.  @Narada Gana Sabha, TTK Road, Alwarpet. The canteen will run December 17 to January 5, from 6am to 10pm everyday.  Call 9500028384.  Sastha Catering Services, Mylapore Fine Arts Club  Last year, RK Venkatesan ran the sabha canteen despite the pandemic, even though there were no music events or concerts. And though people were nervous about crowds, it was comforting to experience at least one familiar note in a tensely unpredictable year.  This year they have started a week ahead of the season due to an overwhelming demand from customers. People are now confident of leaving their homes and heading to the canteen, says RK Venkatesan adding, On day one (December 10) we served 300 lunches, which was rather overwhelming.  Sastha serves a typical South Indian wedding feast on a banana leaf (400 per head). In a wedding feast we normally serve a set menu such as potato roast, aviyal and usili. But I am trying to bring in more variety, says Venkatesan. For example, he says, they serve poosanikka pulippu kootu, chow chow rasavangi (a thick gravy made with coconut, spices, with brinjal or chowchow) and other traditional home style dishes. The focus is on using less oil and spices, he adds.  This is the fifth year that the caterer is running a sabha canteen during the music season.  For breakfast, while there are the traditional ghee dosas, to keep things interesting, Sastha also serves pineapple dosa, beetroot dosa and spinach dosa. If you drop by in the evening, look out for their popular crisp vethala (betel leaf) bajji, Manglore bondas and paani puri.  For the New Year, we will be serving a special lunch (500) where one can taste special items from Andhra, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Karnataka, says Venkatesh.  Kumbakonam degree coffee is available through the day and is served in a brass davara set. Another novelty this year is a counter selling sweets and savouries. The caterer is known for his elaneer payasam, sapota kesari and Asoka halwa.  @Mylapore Fine Arts Club, Mylapore. The canteen will run till January 2, from 6am to 10pm. Call 8925361555. Food is also being delivered through Dunzo and Swiggy.  Mountbatten Mani, Hemamalini Kalyana Mandapam  Legendary cook and caterer, Mountbatten Mani, a trendsetter in the sabha canteen scene, turned 90 last month. His son K Srinivasan who runs the Mountbatten Mani Catering Services, catered at Sri Parthasarathy Swamy Sabha, popular for its elaborate sit down lunches, for a decade. Then, last year the pandemic halted most of the citys Margazhi traditions, including their canteen.  Srinivasan has decided to try a new format this year by organising a Margazhi Food Festival at the Hemamalini Kalyana Mandapam. We are running the canteen as a separate entity at the wedding hall this year, he says, adding This probably is the first time that a canteen is functioning without any concert or under the aegis of any sabha. I am organising such a canteen only for sake of my loyal customers, as they look forward to our elaborate meals every year during the December Season.  His team specialises in traditional vegetarian meals, as well as snacks and tiffin. I try to bring into the menu, what we normally may not find in the restaurant. For example, paal kozhukattai, vella paniyaram and badam halwa, which is my fathers secret recipe, says Srinivasan. The kalyana virundhu we serve has no onion, no garlic (525 per person) and we generally avoid root vegetables during the weekends, he says, adding that Most of us did not get to attend many weddings during the pandemic, so it is a chance to celebrate familiar flavours. Also, these Margazhi canteens break the monotony of life.  @Hemamalini Kalyana Mandapam, Lloyds Road, Royapettah. The canteen will run from December 22 till January 4, from noon to 10pm.

In its order, SEBI asked stock exchanges in commodity derivatives segment to not to undertake any trading in derivative contracts in these key farm commodities with immediate effect.  No new contract shall be launched till further orders. In respect of running contracts, no new position will be allowed to be taken. Only squaring up of position will be allowed, the regulator said in its order.  These directions will be implemented with immediate effect. The above-mentioned directions are applicable, for a period of one year, it added.  India is the worlds biggest importer of vegetable oils. Prices of these kitchen staples have been spiralling in recent months.  The government as well as the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) are struggling to hold prices of food items to curb inflation and Mondays measures are believed to be steps in this direction.

2021-12-21,https://www.newindianexpress.com/business/2021/dec/21/inflation-fears-likely-behind-ban-on-farm-futures-2397977.html,"Ram Sahgal By  Express News Service  MUMBAI: In what market stakeholders see as the governments bid to rein in potential inflationary pressures in key consumables like edible oils, pulses, and foodgrains, stock market watchdog Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), in consultation with it, banned futures trading in seven farm items and their derivatives on December 20. The ban will remain in force for a year.  Accordingly, traders will not be able to punch in any fresh futures trades on soyabean and mustard and their derivatives, crude palm oil (CPO), wheat, paddy (non-basmati ), chana and moong for one year from December 20. They will only be allowed to square off or reverse their existing positions. Sebi did not assign any reason for the suspension in its circular dated December 20.  A futures contract facilitates the purchase or sale of an underlying commodity for delivery at a later date.  NCDEX runs the countrys largest farm derivatives segment while energy and metals bourse MCX offers trading mainly on CPO as part of its much smaller agri bouquet. NCDEX will be the hardest hit by the ban as the soya complex accounted for 36% of its average daily turnover so far this fiscal year. MCX will witness only marginal impact.  Queries to NCDEX and MCX on the reasons for and impact of the ban went unanswered till press time.  Traders and an economist view the latest regulatory move as a measure to pre-empt inflationary expectations primarily in soyabean and CPO.  It looks like a proactive move to curb potential inflationary pressures in the soya complex and in CPO, said Naveen Mathur, director (commodities & currencies), Anand Rathi Share And Stock Brokers. Agreed Madan Sabnavis, chief economist, CareEdge Ratings. Growth in consumer prices of edible oils in November 21 remained high at 29.7% against 17.9% in the corresponding month of the previous year. Inflation of the other domestically produced items remains mostly under control. Given that chana and mustard were banned earlier, the (RBI and governments) point of concern seems to be edible oils.  Food and beverages have a 45.86% weight in the CPI, whose price growth has slowed to 4.9% this November from 6.9% in the same month last year. Analysts feel the government and regulators might not want to leave anything to chance in an environment where inflationary expectations could scuttle the recent recovery in an economy ravaged by the pandemic.  Harish Galipelli, head -strategy, ILA Commodities, said that while the merits of the ban were yet to be seen, trader sentiment in the farm commodity derivatives segment would be adversely impacted.

2021-12-23,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/explained-why-sebi-suspended-futures-trading-in-agri-products/article38003931.ece,"Objective is to rein in prices of essential commodities  The story so far: Securities & Exchange Board of India (SEBI) on Monday issued directions to stock exchanges in the commodity derivatives segment for immediately suspending trading in derivative contracts in key farm commodities, namely paddy (non-basmati), wheat, chana, mustard seeds and its derivatives, soya bean and its derivatives, crude palm oil and moong for a year.  The derivative contracts in these commodities were already suspended, as per a SEBI statement on August 16 and October 8, respectively.  What are derivative contracts?  Derivative contracts are between two or more parties where the derivative value is based upon an underlying asset, in this case agri commodities.  The prices of the derivatives are established by the price fluctuations of the underlying assets. Derivatives can be traded on an exchange or over the counter (OTC).  How does the system work and what are derivatives trading?  Derivatives trading takes place when traders speculate on the future price of an asset through buying or selling of derivative contracts to maximise profit, as compared to buying the underlying asset outright.  Traders also use derivatives for hedging to minimise risk against an existing position. With derivatives, traders can go short and make profit from falling asset prices. They also use derivatives to hedge against any existing long positions. The ultimate objective is to profit. This is viewed as a deterrent to bring in price discipline in the market.  What does the SEBI order mean?  No new contract will be introduced until further orders. In respect of running contracts, no new position will be allowed to be taken. Only squaring up of position has been allowed. The imports in such commodities, especially edible oils, would reduce in the short term as traders will not have a hedging platform. Hedging, which is speculative in nature, has been made difficult. This will lead to release of blocked local produce supplies into the market, which should cool the prices. Imports of commodities for speculative gains will be discouraged.  What is the objective of the suspension?  It is to rein in rising prices of essential commodities, which are fuelling inflation. India is the worlds biggest importer of vegetable oil and this measure will make it difficult for edible oil importers and traders to transact business since they use Indian exchanges to hedge their risk.  It is believed that speculators have a role in jacking up prices and this needed to be discouraged to curb inflation and support growth as the economy is recovering from COVID-19 impact.  The suspension of trading in these commodities follows a communication from the Department of Economic Affairs, which is closely monitoring price movements.  How alarming is inflation?  As per the RBI governors recent monetary policy statement, CPI inflation went up in October to 4.5% from 4.3% in September, after falling sharply between June and September. The persistence of high core inflation (i.e., CPI inflation excluding food and fuel) since June 2020 has been an area of policy concern as input cost pressures could rapidly be transmitted to retail inflation as demand strengthens.  The governors assessment is that price pressures may persist in the immediate term. He observed that supply side interventions by the Government had limited the fallout of continuing high international edible oil prices on domestic prices.  While cost-push pressures continue to impinge on core inflation, the inflation prints are likely to be somewhat higher over the rest of the year as base effects turn adverse. However, it is expected that headline inflation will peak in Q4 of 2021-22 and soften thereafter. RBI has projected CPI inflation at 5.3% for FY22.  What is being done to deal with inflation?  Besides suspension of futures trading in key farm commodities by the SEBI, the Government and RBI are resorting to multiple interventions to curb the rising inflation.  Recently, as prices of edible oil hit near record highs, the Union Government substantially reduced taxes on imports of palm, soy and sunflower oil, but the move had limited impact on combating inflation.  The Union and State Governments had also recently reduced excise duty and VAT on petrol and diesel, which was aimed at bringing down inflation by way of direct effects as well as indirect effects operating through fuel and transportation costs.",Explained | Why SEBI suspended futures trading in agri products,GREEN GRAM DAL (MOONG DAL)

Its partly why she started her ready-to-eat packaged meals company, Triguni Eze Eats, at 69. Its why, at 80, she remains its managing director.  For over a decade, Daga has arrived at her Chennai factory at 10.30 am for inspection rounds, overseeing operations and occasionally conducting taste checks. She may have got into the game late, but this is the future of food, she says. For most of her life, Daga ran a garments factory focused on exports. Then, in 2009, she went to the US on holiday and saw a packet of dehydrated ready-to-eat pasta. She was excited to try it. I never did, she says. But the idea of just adding warm water and getting a piping hot meal stayed with her. The following year, she decided to use a spare room at her garments factory for some food experiments. She hired a chef who helped her create her first dehydrated meal: Cup-o-Idli. We tried different variations, but it was just never soft and fluffy enough to my taste, so I almost gave up, she says. As a last-ditch effort, they tried lemon rice, and this time it worked. The rice retained its texture; the flavour was authentic. They went on to try the same process with vegetable biryani and upma, which are now among their top-selling products.  As people get busier and travel more, they also end up missing home-cooked meals a little more. Thats where we come in, says Radha Daga, 80, managing director of Triguni Eze Eats.  Today, the company has a total of 20 meals on offer, including poha, paneer butter masala, rajma-chawal, bisibele bhath, tamarind rice and vegetable fried rice. The operation has expanded from a seven-person team in 2010 to about 100 employees today. The garment export was shut down and the factory space turned into a certified food plant by 2011.  In addition to retailing online, Eze Eats supplies in-flight meal kits to airlines IndiGo and AirAsia India and to certain Indian Railways services via the Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation (IRCTC). Eze Eats meal prep is now supervised by a team of head chefs and cooks (including the chef behind the original food experiments). They follow traditional recipes to ensure that the end product tastes like home. Each batch has to pass a taste test, Daga says. This is followed by a dehydration process and then the food is ready to package. The whole cycle takes 36 to 40 hours. An Eze Eats meal costs between 80 and 120 and has a shelf life of about six months. The bisibele bhath and moong dal khichdi are hot-selling items on our in-flight menus. Even as the pandemic set in we reached out to Eze Eats for crew meals because of the range of dishes and easy-to-eat and serve packaging, says Parnitha S, an in-flight catering management executive with AirAsia India. While its corporate clients make up its largest revenue stream, the companys newest customers, according to Dagas market research, tend to be college students and travellers who miss the taste of home. As people get busier and travel more, they also end up missing home-cooked meals a little more. Thats where we come in, she says.

Its a mans best friend for a chilly winter night. But have you tried lemon rasam and that too made using masoor dal? Well, Bengaluru-based Teena Augustine has a handful of unique recipes like lemon rasam that she invented in her kitchen in the past few years. Though counsellor by profession, the Kochi-native is an ardent food lover, and also a recipe curator and food blogger. Her social media page, Ooonuready, is a testament to her love for fusion and unique delicacies.  Rich purple mashed organic sweet potatoes sautd in ghee with a dash of milk, cardamom, desiccated coconut and sugar rolled in the shape of laddoo is one of her drool-worthy creations. The almond flakes give it a nutty taste. I started to post recipes and photos of my culinary inventions seven years ago, Teena says. According to her, sweet potato halwa and laddoo have natural sweetness so they can be served without the sugar too.  Teenas experiments were influenced by her childhood spent in Kuwait. Our neighbours included Pakistanis, Philippinos and Indian communities like Kashmiris, Maharashtrians and others. There was a myriad of cultures and cuisines there and they influenced my culinary journey, says Teena.  Her recent hit recipe was the veldt grape chutney aka devils backbone chutney. Teena also has recipes on medicinal dishes and her changalamparanda chutney is one among them. The youngster who is a PhD holder from IIT Madras started to explore the medicinal dishes more to prepare a healthy menu for her mother who is diabetic. Two years ago, my mother was diagnosed with a blood clot in her brain. The doctor directed me to give her six-course meals a day. So I started to prepare unique fusion dishes for her, Teena says. Her invention of devils backbone chutney was quite an accident.  I bought devils backbone plant thinking of it was a cactus. Later I found its medicinal values and tried to create similar dishes using Brahmi which is good for the brain. Bhrahmi-nellikka-panikoorkka pachadi is another dish. Recently I have prepared payasam using aloe vera pulp as it is more like thick ada pradhaman, and healthy for digestion, says Teena.  Custard apple pudding, green gram dosa, pineapple puttu, beetroot payasam, strawberry pickle, corn halwa etc are a few worthy mentions from her recipe list. She has also widely explored the varieties of one of Malayalis favourite breakfasts, idli. Chiblu idli made using a bamboo basket, kanjeepuram kovil idli and beetroot idli are her way to lure her seven-year-old daughter to the breakfast table.  For me, life is popcorn inside the pressure cooker. Cooking soothes our minds. It is like problem-solving. Instead of throwing away the messed up dish, I figure out what went wrong and how to rectify it to a tasty offering, Teena explains.",Healthy experiments to do in the kitchen,GREEN GRAM DAL (MOONG DAL)
