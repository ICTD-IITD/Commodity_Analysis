Recently, Mira Kapoor, whose glowing skin may have already caught your attention, shared some simple DIY face packs, oils and other hacks she personally uses to keep her skin and hair healthy.It is (DIY) one of my favourite approaches to skincare. I have been doing these mixes of all kinds of things from the kitchen since I was probably 14. I still do a lot of the same thingssome of the recipes have been tweaked as my skin concerns change or seasons change.Before sharing her DIY recipes, Mira emphasised that the kitchen ingredients one uses for making them should be pure. Also, make sure that your hands are washed and nails are clipped. She also recommended doing a patch test before applying any of the packs to ensure there is no adverse reaction.View this post on Instagram A post shared by Mira Rajput Kapoor (@mira.kapoor)DIY honey and haldi face packHoney is a natural humectant (retains or preserves moisture) while haldi (turmeric) is anti-inflammatory and anti-bacterial. Mira said she uses the pack as a remedy for zits or muddy skin. I like to mix a pinch of haldi and little bit of honey  please ensure that the honey is pure.DIY facialI have never actually gotten a facial, Mira revealed. In fact, instead of going for bridal facial for her wedding, she applied a chironji (cuddapah almond) scrub, mixed with masoor dal and milk, on her body, every single day. The scrub is good for removing dead skin.Mira also shared her go-to DIY facial routine  first, she applies lemon juice on her face. After removing it, she applies a mask made with besan (gram flour) and curd. To this mixture, you can also add other ingredients; Mira, for instance, adds orange peel powder, moringa powder, neem powder, and so on. Once the mask is semi-dry, rub your skin gradually to remove it.Following the mask, she puts tomato juice on her face. Cut a tomato and apply it straight on your face. Leave it for another 10-12 minutes and then remove.The facial routine is completed with aloe vera, which has many benefits for the skin. I like to do this once in two weeks because it does take quite a bit of time.Raw milk face packI have seen my mom putting raw milk on her face ever since I can remember. It is her go-to remedyfor sunburn, uneven tan, your skin is feeling dry. Mira explained how her mother takes raw milk in a bowl and dabs it on her face with cotton, a method she follows as well. When it dries up, clean it and dab again till you finish the milk left in your bowl. I like to use about three tablespoons of milk and I like to add little bit of rosewater, the celeb mother said. It leaves your skin squeaky clean and supple.

The common ingredient in all of them? PepperThere is a drizzle outside when we sit for lunch.On the menu, is ammas milagu kuzhambu (pepper curry) and hot rice. I scoop a heapful of rice on my plate, add a dash of gingelly oil, and two spoonfuls of the curry. The drizzle becomes a steady downpour and by the time I wolf down the rice, there is thunder and a howling wind. But I am prepared to deal with the weather: the curry, a tangy concoction of pepper, pepper, and more pepper, leaves my palate with a mild burning sensation typical to the spice. It keeps me warm on the inside, at least for a while.Come winter and every part of India starts whipping up winter curries specific to the region. In Tamil Nadu, milagu kuzhambu is a seasonal special. During my childhood, my grandmother would serve this curry or pepper rasam with hot rice and appalam during winters, recalls 74-year-old YouTuber Gita Rajamani, who runs the popular channel Agrahara Recipes from her home in Kallidaikurichi, Tirunelveli district. Back then, in Sirkazhi where I grew up, it would sometimes rain for 15 days straight and this curry was a dinnertime staple to keep warm, she adds.During winters, when nights were dark and the stone mortar and pestle kept in the corner of the house was too cold to be held to make idli batter, milagu kuzhambu came to our rescue, says Gita. Made with plenty of tamarind, that Gita says is a natural preservative, the curry would be stored in a stone pot and was good to be had for 15 days. Pepper was the chief spice employed in Tamil cuisine, she points out. Green and red chillies were actually introduced to us by the Portuguese; but now though, we use more chillies.Pepper Rasam from South India which is very common and popular which can be served with steamed rice and ghee.Pepper was used extensively in winter, in curries and rasams. Betel leaves were used to keep lungs healthy during cold weather, points out Gita. I make a rasam with the leaves; once the regular tamarind rasam is done simmering, I place a betel leaf over it, switch off the stove, cover, and let the juice seep into the rasam, she explains adding that she removes the leaf a little later.In western Tamil Nadu, horsegram dal and rasam are winter delicacies and in places such as Coimbatore where the weather generally leans towards the colder side, the lentil is cooked through the year. In my household, we make kollu paruppu (dal) twice a week, especially during winter since the dish is considered heat-inducing, says Dharchana Muruganandam, who grew up in Pollachi. We make rasam with the water the dal has been cooked in; the dish has crushed shallots in it instead of garlic, she explains.Gita says that horsegram can also be incorporated in a thogayal (thick chutney) by grinding the boiled lentil with onions, tomatoes, pepper, and garlic. It goes well with rasam, she says adding that she spent several years in western Tamil Nadu before she got married. Gita recalls a Tamil saying with a laugh: Elachavanukku ellu, koluthavanukku kollu, which translates to: Sesame for the slim man, horsegram for the plump man, because horsegram helps break down fat in the body.Childhood stapleFood blogger Swayampurna Mishra has a treasure trove of lamb memories to fall back on every winter.She says, Im from Odisha, and my mother would make this amazing lamb curry when I was a child. I remember it being made every single Sunday through the winter: it was familiar and spicy and it would warm us right up.Lamb curry | Photo Credit: Swayampurna MishraShe adds that, admittedly, making a child feel warm was not that mean a feat in her childhood home. It doesnt get as cold in Odisha as it does in parts of the North, but I think every person from that part of the country remembers their childhood lamb curry as a winter ritual.Milagu kuzhambu (pepper curry) recipe:Ingredients2 tsp tamarind paste, turmeric to taste, one sprig curry leaves, 5 to 6 red chillies, a pinch of asafoetida, 1 1/2 tsp fenugreek seeds, 1 1/2 tsp cumin seeds, 1 tsp urad dal, 1 1/2 tsp toor dal, 2 tsp coriander seeds, 1 1/2 tsp pepper corns, 1/2 tsp mustard seeds, gingelly oil to saute, salt to taste, jaggery to tasteMethodRoast pepper and coriander seeds, toor and urad dal, and red chillies with two tsp oil. Introduce half a teaspoon fenugreek seeds, cumin, asafoetida, and curry leaves when the pepper corns start to sputter. Turn off the stove. Now, add salt to taste. Once the mixture cools, grind to a fine paste adding a little water. Heat four to five teaspoons of oil in a pan. Add mustard seeds and once they sputter, add half a teaspoon fenugreek seeds, half a teaspoon cumin seeds, a pinch of asafoetida, turmeric powder, the ground paste, tamarind paste, jaggery, and water to get the runny consistency of a curry.

And not just any kind of saag, but a dish of mustard leaves. Winter, as we know in the north, is the time for sarson ka saag  that creamy dish that so delightfully complements makkey ki roti  or rotis prepared with maize.I studied the menus of the little eateries in and around my neighbourhood to see if anyone was known for its saag and roti. Turned out there was one, Baa Bistro, which had the dish on the menu, along with a Rajasthani thhali. I am fond of Rajasthani food, and gattey ki sabzi  a spicy dish of lentil cakes in gravy  is a particular favourite. So I licked my chops and got ready to place my order.Life is full of little disappointments: It was a rainy night, the delivery agents had called it a day, and I was told that I was not going to get my saag and roti. But, quite like a good hound, once I am on the trail of something, I dont give up easily. I went back to my research, and zeroed in on an old favourite: a small restaurant called SinglaSweets which had fed me little hillocks of bedmi sabzi in kinder times. Singla had sarson ka saag and makkey ki roti, and was delivering (Ph: 9697828888, 011-22232323).The food arrived. And it was so good that I called the owner of the shop to find out about the fare. The trick in the greens was that it was simply cooked  it had neither onions, nor garlic or ginger. It merely had a tempering of ghee and whole red chillies. The roti, again, was surprisingly soft. It was not soaked in ghee, but was nicely moist.I dipped a piece into the saag and popped it into my mouth, and went back to my village, where this was a regular part of our winter fare. I grew up on various kinds of rotis, prepared with millet, maize and gram. There were all kinds of greens too: mustard, fenugreek, and bathua, to name just a few. In the village, of course, a dollop of white butter went on top of the rotis, while the saag was topped with large quantities of ghee. Bliss.Wed also ordered a plate of malai kofta, and that was a rich concoction of cashew, cream, and paneer. But the saag was what the doctor had ordered (without the ghee of course).It rained the next day again, and the heart called out for more saag and roti. I rang up Baa Bistro (9911214567, 9930983076), and found it open.I ordered the saag-roti combo, and the Rajasthani thhali for lunch. The saag was spicy but tasty, and the rotis were thick and firm, the way most makkey ki rotis are. I enjoyed the Rajasthani dishes  especially the hot gattey and the equally spicy mangori-papad ki sabzi. There was a gulab jamun, too, which we shared.On a cold winters day, saag and roti warm up the heart. And a hot and squishy gulab jamun is like the icing  or rather the warm syrup  on top.The writer is a seasoned food critic","Cold weather food, delivered at home in Delhi",MASUR DAL
2021-02-11,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/travel/tracking-tigers-at-panna-national-park-madhya-pradesh/article33793138.ece,"In search of the majestic 141 in Madhya Pradeshs Panna National Park, a brush with brawling langurs, dainty deer and confused pheasantsSpotting the king of the Indian jungle in the wild is an experience in learning about yourself. In this age of instant gratification it can be either a frustrating or a humbling experience to know that your chances of seeing the tiger are pretty much random. Which way you take it depends on who you are as a person.At the invitation of Taj Safaris, we were investigating the reported return of the tiger to Panna National Park in Madhya Pradesh. Panna had lost all its tigers to poaching by 2009 and it is only in the last decade through a careful process of relocation from other tiger reserves and natural breeding that the tiger population has climbed back to about 50. Leopards that had taken over the role of apex predator following the disappearance of the tiger can still be found, though in diminished numbers.Travel Notes Taj Safaris Pashangarh (Madhya Pradesh) is a one hour drive from the nearest airport in Khajuraho. Besides spending a day visiting the world famous temples of Khajuraho, you can also take a two-hour drive to visit Kalinjar, which is a fortress-city containing several temples dating as far back as the Gupta dynasty of the 3rd-5th Centuries.Creatures of the wildThe Pashangarh (stone fortress) property is the smallest of the six luxury safari lodges that Taj runs in India and Nepal. My photographer friend and I were ushered into our rooms done up in muted browns and greys. The floor-to-ceiling windows looked right out at the thick forest beyond. Attached was a sit-out with a fireplace, presided by a bemused grey langur.The safari trail at Panna National Park | Photo Credit: Sundeep KumarAt night, we head out on a safari. As we bumped along the rough forest trail, the headlight beams of the jeep picked out a few stray deer, eyes smouldering like lumps of charcoal on an otherwise still forest. We stopped at a watering hole to admire the blanket of stars covering the open sky as a fiery orange moon climbed out of the trees. No tiger sighting, but we returned to a sumptuous dinner of lentil and coconut soup followed by grilled chicken in wine sauce served on a stone deck overlooking the forest.For the next few days we played Find-The-Tiger, entering through both the Madla and Hinouta gates, but the big cat remained elusive. The core area of Panna with 50 tigers covers a total area of 543 square kilometres but it is a common misconception that the chances of spotting the tiger are influenced by the tiger/land ratio. For one, only 20% of the core area is available for humans to explore through safaris. Secondly, tigers are intensely territorial and respect each others patch. What this means is that you are restricted to searching for only a handful of tigers from the large population in the park.We did see plenty of other wild creatures on our drives. Herds of large sambar deer with their rather drab brown coats were upstaged by their nattier cousins, the sleek nilgai and the delicate chital (spotted deer). Wild boar snuffled along on either side of the trail, eyes darting back and forth, snouts and tails twitching warily. The most entertaining were the grey langurs swinging impossibly from one flimsy branch to another. We came across a troop of them brawling with mock ferocity; the young ones hurled themselves at their older brothers, giving as good as they got.One morning, we went for a walk with the Pardhi, a nomadic tribe of hunter/poachers who are now working as guides for the Taj Safaris. They showed us how to use the bark of trees and the leaves of plants like the lantana, amla and tulsi for medicinal purposes and also pointed out the faint tracks of hyenas and leopards on the dusty trail. The Pardhi are adept at imitating the warning and mating calls of jungle creatures. Their authentic shrill cries caused a red pheasant to waddle up through the undergrowth to see what the fuss was all about, before, of course, beating a hasty retreat.Sense the beastThe closest we came to feeling the presence of 141, the tigress that ruled in this part of the park, was on our last drive. The nomenclature indicates that she is the first-born of the fourth litter of the first tigress to be introduced to Panna.In a stroke of absolute beginners luck, a couple spotted her down by the Karnali River within minutes of their first drive out. The rest of us were alerted quickly to the fact that she had bounded up into the jungle followed by her two cubs. Her overnight kill of a fresh sambar had been dragged into the Karnali by marauding crocodiles.Crocodile, the apex predator in the waters at Panna | Photo Credit: Sundeep KumarWe scrambled into a wooden boat and set off in search of the kill. Here, the Karnali was smooth as glass with no visible flow except where it dropped suddenly over hidden rocks and foam gushed forth like blood from an open wound. We soon caught sight of the carcass floating mid-stream and being fed upon by a bask of mugger crocodiles, all enjoying the lunch they had mugged from the tigress. Their beady eyes rose from the green waters. Lethal tails with scales packed like armour flicked lazily from side to side  the tigers might rule the land but in the water, the crocodiles were the true apex predators.For details, on stay and rates at Pashangarh visit www.tajsafaris.com.

However, heavy rains toward the end of August had queered the pitch for a good harvest with Madhya Pradesh -- the largest producer of the beans -- reporting extensive damage. (Representational)Ahead of elections in four states, prices of urad dal have posed a major concern with supplies being severely constrained at wholesale markets. Traders said the coup in Myanmar has stopped the supply line of imports reaching Indian markets, which would have cooled prices down. On Thursday, the central government announced a 4-lakh tonne import quota of the lentil for the next financial year.Mainly a kharif crop, Indian growers reported 33.38 lakh hectares for the 2020 kharif. Heavy rain towards the end of August, however, adversely affected the chances of a good harvest with Madhya Pradesh  the largest producer of the crop  reporting extensive damage.After a brief slump due to the Covid-19 lockdown led to a demand destruction, wholesale prices of urad crossed government-declared minimum support price (MSP) of Rs 6,000 per quintal across the country. Prices of urad dal  a staple in south Indian delicacies such as dosa  have hovered around Rs 100 per kg for most part of the season.With around 1 lakh tonne of import yet to reach India, the supply chain was severely impacted as the military coup in Myanmar put a stop to shipment.Nitin Kalantari, a Latur-based dal miller and trader, said Myanmar was the only country other than India that produces the lentil. This is the harvest season there, but the military coup in the country has completely stopped all shipments coming from there, he said.At present, prices of urad dal across the country have crossed the Rs 100 per kg mark with south Indian states reporting an average price of Rs 120. At main wholesale markets of the country, urad is now trading at Rs 6,700 to Rs 6,800 per quintal.Kalantari and other traders have ruled out any price correction in the near future till the situation in Myanmar settles down.

Farmers said this was a direct effort on part of the government to control pulse price inflation ahead of state elections at the expense of farmers incomes.Lalit Patil Bahal, executive president of Shetkari Sanghatana, claimed this promotion of imports would result in the ongoing farmers movement spreading to other parts of the country.On March 19, the central government had announced its intention of allowing imports of 4 lakh tonnes of tur and 1.5 lakh tonnes of moong for the next fiscal. This was in addition of 2 lakh tonnes of tur to be imported from Mozambique and 4 lakh tonnes of urad, which was announced earlier. India annually imports 10-15 lakh tonnes of pulses, which is a steep fall from the 30-40 lakh tonnes of import the country used to report around five years ago.Traders pointed out how in the previous years, the import quotas were announced towards end of April or early May, with daal millers and processors expected to complete the imports before the domestic arrivals start in the markets. This year, the import quotas have been preponed, which traders said was because of the pulse price inflation noticed in the country. Prices of almost all pulses in the country is now between Rs 100-120 per kg in retail markets.Arrival of urad and moong, both kharif crops, in wholesale mandis is negligible, but farmers continue to bring tur to the mandi. At Laturs wholesale mandi  the largest tur market in the country  around 2,500 quintals of the lentil arrive on a daily basis. As against the government-declared Minimum Support Price (MSP) of Rs 6,000 per quintal, the average trading price of tur at Laturs market is Rs 6,800.Nitin Kalantri, a Latur-based dal miller and trader, pointed out how mandi prices dropped to Rs 6,700 a day after the import quota was announced.

Referring to the ongoing farmers agitation against the three farm laws in the country, Patil Bahal said such trade decisions would result in the movement spreading to other parts of the country.Interestingly, Patil Bahals outfit had earlier supported the laws. Anil Ghanwat, another leader from Shetkari Sanghatana, which was founded by late Sharad Joshi, is part of the three-member body constituted by the Supreme Court to study the laws.Manikrao Kadam, another farmer leader from Maharashtra, pointed out how farmers had taken to growing pulses to make the country self-sufficient in protein.

Subscribe here.)Her initial idea was to bring out a booklet for the community, but the information proved too voluminous. The result of her research has now been published as Classic Cuisine and Celebrations of the Thanjavur Maharashtrians.Culture across the pagesChennai-based Jaishri took up this task after her elder son was employed overseas and younger one joined university. The Thanjavur Maharashtrian diaspora is spread across the globe, and assuming that both my sons would one day leave the country, I wished to preserve our communitys unique cooking traditions and cultural heritage for the next generation, says Jaishri.The book features over 150 recipes, many of which are offered as naivedya (prayer offerings) during festivals, besides everyday dishes and delicacies.As festivals and religious rituals are a quintessential part of Maharashtrian culture, the author has structured the book chronologically, starting with the festival of Gudi Padwa in the month of Chaithra (March/April) and ending with the festival of Shimga Puneva (Holi) that falls in the month of Phalgun (February/March).As the community follows all rituals and celebrates festivals with fervour, I decided to follow this structure, where I mention the festival, talk about the rituals involved, and the dishes associated with a particular celebration, says Jaishri.In the section on Gudi Padwa, she lists staple heritage dishes such as puran poli, chinch bhath (tamarind rice), limbacha bhath (lemon rice), vaangi bhath (brinjal rice), ambode (a deep-fried spicy snack made with dal), pitla (mixed veg and lentil curry cooked in tamarind water), kadi (buttermilk-based curry) and other recipes.Timely evolutionOver three centuries, the Thanjavur Maharashtrians have also created new dishes, influenced by the Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Karnataka cuisines. Pitla and daangar (urad dal flour blended with curd) are typical Thanjavur Maharashtrian dishes, evolved over a period of time.Early migrants also replaced certain ingredients with locally available ones. For example, copra (dried coconut) is widely used in many Maharashtrian dishes, but in our community freshly grated coconut is roasted and then used to get the copra taste, she says.Coriander seeds, cumin and coconut are the dominant spices used in this cuisine.  We use various spice powders toasted in a minimal amount of oil to flavour the dishes.The simplicity of preparation with a good balance of spices is the hallmark of Thanjavur Maharashtrian cuisine, says Jaishri.A classic combination is ambat bhaaji, daangar and kaatracha misiringa (mor molaga Thanjavur style). Ambat bhaaji is a signature dish of our community. This spinach sambar is prepared with a liberal amount of toor dal, spiced with green chillies and seasoned with mustard, dry chillies and fenugreek. In sweets, puran poli, doodh poli and besan ladoo top the list.Methkoot and daangar are typical examples of the protein-rich diet of this diaspora. Methkoot is a powder made using a mix of lentils such as toor, channa, moong and urad. Coriander, cumin and dry ginger are used to flavour this powder, which can be used in multiple ways as an accompaniment or even mixed with curd or tamarind water.The book has been well received by the diaspora, especially the younger generation, and it has also won the Best Vegetarian Cuisine Book in the World Award by Gourmand International for the year 2020, says Jaishri.The book and Kindle versions are available on Amazon.","This book collates the traditions, rituals and cuisine of the Thanjavur Maharastrian community",MASUR DAL
2021-03-25,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/holi-2021-dahi-vada-specialty-dish-recipe-combinations-dahi-vada-alu-dum/article34160113.ece,"Some dishes and drinks have been irrefutable Holi playmates for aeons. This year, snuggle at home with one such universal favourite  dahi vada, with all its shapes, flavours and toppingsFood in India is decided by season, and the ingredients available in the region one lives in. The festival of colours, Holi is just round the corner and, as the temperature rises, celebrations are incomplete without food that not only tickles your taste-buds, but also cools you down.Rajani Jain, a home chef in Delhi says, What better way than cool dahi vada after spending hours outside playing Holi? The dahi (curd) cools you down and the common urad dal vadas, laced with masalas  cumin, coriander and chat masala powder  bring forth a burst of flavours. I prefer ginger juliennes on it, with anar dana (pomegranate seeds), she adds.A homemade dish of dahi vada | Photo Credit: Prabalika M BorahThere are many such preferences and not restricted to toppings alone. There are variations that give this dish an interesting spin, like vadas made with mixed lentil, moong dal, bread, oats or even with jeera butter cookies. An illustration to go with Tarla Dalals recipe, for instance, suggests vadas can be made with jeera butter cookies, slightly soaked in lukewarm water before dunking them in a pool of seasoned yoghurt. The mixed lentil variety, also called masala vada, consists of chana dal, urad dal and moong dal, all coarsely ground.The tough questionDahi vada is a simple dish, but it can get complicated if the vadas are not soft enough.According to chef Garima Poddar, dahi vadas are unique, because though they are deep fried, they melt in your mouth. She adds: A lot of people get stuck with hard vadas or bhallas. To avoid this, one can soak the fried vadas in water for a few seconds, then squeeze the water out gently by pressing them between ones palms and drop them them in dahi.Having said that, softness need not be an obsession, adds Garima, In Rajasthan, the vadas are made with a slightly coarse paste of lentils, so there is a bite to its texture.Chef Kunal Kapoor suggests that the urad batter be made with less or no water, to get soft vadas. Whisking the batter well, for quite some time, right before frying the vadas will also be helpful, he says.Experimental matchmakingA dahi vada alu dum stall in Cuttack, OdishaStreet food lovers in Cuttack, Odisha have created their own twist to the dahi vada, pairing it with alu dum in a treat exclusive to this city.The now-iconic street food dahi vada and alu dum is a fusion experiment that has clicked very well, says consultant chef Rachit Kirteeman.Homemade dahi vada, by Hina Gujral Ingredients: 1 cup dhuli urad dal (split black gram); 1 chopped green chilli;  inch peeled and grated ginger; A pinch of asafoetida; 4 tbsp water; Salt to taste; Oil for deep frying; Lukewarm water; 2 cups thick yoghurt (curd); 1 tsp chat masala; 1 tsp cumin powder (for curd); 1 tsp cumin powder (for topping);  tsp black salt; 2 tsp sugar; 2 tbsp sweet tamarind chutney; 2 tbsp coriander and mint chutney; 1/2 tsp red chilli powder; 1 tbsp chopped corianderMethod:To make the vada batter, wash and soak dal in water for six hours or overnight. Transfer soaked dal to the grinder with chopped green chillies and grated ginger. Grind dal without using water, stop mixer in between, stir with a spatula and grind again. Keep doing this at regular intervals. If it still does not turn into a smooth paste, add one or two tablespoons of water, then grind. The idea is to use minimum water. Transfer the paste to a large bowl. Add salt, asafoetida and whisk batter briskly for a couple of minutes or till it is light and fluffy.Deep fry the vadas over medium heat by shaping small portions of the batter into flat balls with your fingers (dampened with water), or dropping them into the oil with the help of spoons. Allow them to cook as they fry. They can be turned when they are pale golden from the base and sides. Fry until they become crisp.Soak the vadas in lukewarm water in a wide saucepan. Keep enough space for the vadas to breathe, as they expand in water. Let them soak for about 10 minutes or until soft and drain out excess water from each vada by gently pressing between your palms.To assemble, first take curd in a bowl. Add salt, cumin powder, sugar and chat masala and whisk till smooth. Dilute the curd and season it to taste.Arrange vadas in a serving bowl. Pour the flavoured curd over the vadas, so that it soaks them completely. Top with the green chutney and tamarind chutney. Sprinkle red chilli and cumin powder and chat masala to taste. Garnish dahi vada with chopped coriander leaves. Serve chilled.He elaborates, The Cuttack region of Odisha produces a lot of milk. So instead of letting it go waste, curd was made. Vada is a staple breakfast. Someone who had surplus of both curd and vada mixed it together and added the alu dum as an unusual accompaniment. Dahi vada in Odisha uses diluted curd, so when alu dum is added, it becomes a complete dish.Season to tasteAs for spicing the yoghurt, Garima says, There is no thumb rule to seasoning the dahi. The same applies to its consistency. Some like it thick and creamy, others like it slightly runny. Experiment with what works for your palate on a small quantity of dahi.One of Garimas favourite variations of dahi vada is the South Indian version, which uses a runny curd base.She says, I also enjoy the tempering on it. One can play it up with any seasoning. I have tasted it with a garnish of peri peri masala, and also read about dahi vada with Tabasco sauce.Kunal suggests creative toppings: It is a season of fruits, so there is no harm in adding chopped fruits such as apples, bananas, grapes or even melons to the whisked yoghurt.",Cool off with some dahi vada,MASUR DAL

The restaurant, which boasts a food menu conceived by Michelin-starred Chef Atul Kochhar of Benares, London fame, and executed by Chef Tanvi Goswami, has just introduced an Experience Menu, curated by Kochhar, Available only on Sundays, it is a reflection of SAGAs food philosophy, weaving together the myriad flavours of the country into a nine-course meal that celebrates Indias rich culinary legacies in clean contemporary settings. Speaking of settings, the restaurant itself is stunning, sprawling over three floors and an al fresco area, with the focal point being a bar that towers up through the entire restaurant, requiring mixologists to travel up and down using lifts and pulleys.All of that spectacle is reinforced by some truly stellar cocktails, but more on those later. Going back to the food, Kochhar says, Through this menu we would like to give an experience, which is culturally rich and speaks volume of our heritage and love for food. The menu is brought to life keeping in mind different palates, touching key dishes from our a la carte offerings and also giving unparalleled dining experience. The Chefs Experience menu includes some of the best-selling dishes from the a la carte menu such as Crispy Crab, Ghee Roast Prawn, Sali Murg, Bhuna Mangsho, Edamame and Quinoa, Khari Paneer Tikka along with special dishes created for it, all washed down by a chilled glass of crisp Prosecco and live music by a violinist who traipses through the various floors and mezzanines of the space.Going with the non-vegetarian menu, we are pleased to make the acquaintance of dishes like the aforementioned crab and prawn. The fo rme r comprises a crackling soft shell crab (we recommend downing it in one bite if you have a large enough mouth and or a disdain for decorum), with dollops of saffron-spiked cream and a mustardy catsup, while the latter comes taco style, the Mangalorean prawn dish, scented with fennel and curry leaves, resting on a tortilla shell as delicate as a ballerinas ankles and just as tenacious, gamely managing to contain the shellfish as one wolfs it down.Helping us wash down this surfeit of seafood is the delicious Indo-Negroni, which gives a distinctly desi twist to the classic cocktail with cumin and citrus flavours. Next, we dally with the Himalayan Flavours (a Nepalese-inspi red Roas t Chicken Salad fired up with timur pepper and tart tomatoes) and Lentil Love (comprising slow-cooked lentils fortified with onion and garlic and served in a tart shell which gives the otherwise simple legumes a more complex texture and crumble, making it all the more welcome). We also take a dip in the Lonar Lake, a signature cocktail of SAGA that is a medley of gin, Aperol (an Italian bitter), Orgeat syrup and sparkling wine, perfumed with kaffir lime leaves.Swimming may be out this year but this is definitely something we could dive into again and again. In the interest of brevity, we shall refrain from further details, but suffice it to say that the main courses, which included Sali Murg (Parsi Chicken), Bhuna Mangsho (Bengali style goat mutton) and the Family Affair (a multi-grain khichdi for the whole family to pass around), were each delicious and individual in their own way. For desserts, there is the Petha (an ambrosial cloud of rabadi festooned with orange jelly, winter melon candy and rose) and the Pilgrims Sweet (a platter packed with plum cake, Panchamarat ice-cream, date treacle and wheat halwa). With the menu expected to change seasonally, given Kochhars emphasis of taking cues from nature, diners can keep enjoying new tastes from the country we call home.DETAILSAT: Vatika Atrium, Golf Course Road, Sector 53, GurugramTIMING: Every Sunday, 12:00pm-4:00pm, 7:00pm-11:00pmCOST PER HEAD: Rs 2,995 ++",Amul's 'SAGA' introduces 'experience menu'Â toÂ celebrateÂ Indiaâ€™s rich culinary legacy,MASUR DAL

In Keralas street food hubs and cafes, age-old food pairings are being replaced with quirky combinations that demand a leap of faithPuttu with parippu (dal) and duck egg roast at Nairs Puttu Kada at North Paravur | Photo Credit: Balram MenonPuttu with parippuNairs Puttukada (puttu shop) has a very direct title. But if you go in expecting the usual, cylindrical rice cake puttu to be served along with a plate of kadala (black chick peas) curry, pappadom and a banana, as is the unquestionable tradition in Kerala, you would be surprised. At Nairs, the puttu is served along with dry parippu (lentil), a strange bedfellow. A spicy duck-egg roast is also part of the package. Mohanan P Nair, the owner of the 56-year-old tea shop in Chathanad, about eight kilometres from North Paravur in Ernakulam, says he thought up the combo and started serving it over 17 years ago. I wasnt sure. But it clicked, he says, over phone from his home. Now, he has people from faraway places seeking out the dish. The tea shop that usually opens at 4.30 pm is now closed owing to the COVID-19 situation.We are not entirely new to bizarre food pairings. 2020 saw a few of those go viral on social media. Blame it on COVID-19, for nothing else can logically explain chocolate Manchurian, Nutella biryani or chicken tikka chai. Dishes such as the one at Nairs, however, are unusual yet extremely palatable. It seems very peculiar at first. But the combination grows on you, says businessman and vlogger Balram Menon, who used to frequent Nairs shop. The dry lentil brings in the perfect balance between the spice in the duck egg roast and the puttu, he adds.Pazhampori and beef at Sree Muruga Cafe, Tripunithura | Photo Credit: Balram MenonBeef roast with banana frittersOne of the oldest among Keralas odd couplings is the pazhampori (banana fritters) and beef. Sree Muruga Cafe in Tripunithura, Kochi, popularised this rather wacky combination, which is a popular snack today. Started in 1943, the tea shop has always sold pazhampori and beef roast, but it became famous much later, says Sathyan K B, the owner of Sree Muruga. Around 1994, when Malayalam actor Jayasurya was shooting for a television show, he and the crew happened to see someone relishing pazhampori with beef. Word spread quickly and the media made the dish popular, he adds. The combo is one the best selling at Sree Muruga today.TV personality and chef Raj Kalesh says the pairing owes its origin to North Indian lorry drivers, who ordered the sweet pazhampori to balance the spice of the famed Kerala beef roast. Kerala was always known for its beef roast and it gradually became a thing to order pazhampori with it, he says. The fritters too are crispy, fried in rice batter instead of maida, adds Kalesh.Savalavada (onion pakora) with squid or chicken roastAny fried snack works well with any non-vegetarian gravy, says Ashvin George, a traveller and food enthusiast. Salwa, an eatery in Thoppumpady, Kochi, usually does brisk business around 5 am based on just this principle. Its best-selling dish is savalavada (onion pakora) served with squid roast. It is just savalavada usually, but once in a while, there is pazhampori as well. Every morning, they fry up these delicious snacks by 2 am or 3 am for the men who go out to sea. The savalavada is often had with chicken or beef roast as well, adds Ashvin.While the rest of us drool over porotta-beef fry, Ashvin also suggests you have the beef fry with neyyappam (a traditional sweet made of jaggery and rice flour). He tasted this combo at a small hotel in Wayanad, whose owner (whom he refers to as Majeedka), grinds the rice for the neyyappam in the afternoon and makes them in the evening. The beef, prepped as early as 10 am, is cooked slowly through the day, and makes for a soul satisfying match with neyyappam.These are not conventional combinations. It is up to each person, really. Whatever floats your boat, adds Ashvin, whose personal idea of an ultimate breakfast is poori with fried eggs.Aval isthiri at Satheeshan PVs tea stall in Kannur | Photo Credit: Special ArrangementAval isthiri (poha, sev and banana)Satheeshan PVs tea stall at Kannapuram in Kannur does not have a name. But everyone in the locality and across Kerala knows his shop for its aval isthiri (which loosely translates to ironed flattened rice). Satheeshan is not sure how the dish got its name, but he has been serving it since the 1970s. His father came up with the dish, which is something like a Malayali bhel puri  made of aval, sugar, Robusta banana and sev (omapodi).The magic is in the mixing of ingredients, says Satheeshan, whose has seen his father make it back in the day. It is a hot favourite here; simple, healthy and filling, he adds. People from across Kerala have travelled to Kannur to try the dish, says Satheeshan. If you examine it, it is rather simple. But I am not sure what inspired my father to come up with such an unusual dish, adds Satheeshan, who claims he has not made any change to the dish.It is going to be a while before we can eat out again, so but if you are bored of your rice with sambhar, feel free to reach for the cheese in the fridge.",Unusual food pairings that Malayalis love,MASUR DAL

In our ancient texts, a balance of six tastes - sweet, sour, salty, pungent, bitter and astringent - has been recommended in everyday eating for optimum health.While sugar and jaggery are the primary sweetening agents in our kitchens, we have also been blessed with an array of natural food souring agents which add that tangy zest to any dish. As summer makes its presence felt, tender tamarind leaves make their appearance which are used extensively in meat preparations in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. The same applies to Gongura leaves which are also enjoyed in the form of pickles and chutneys. Another green leafy vegetable that imparts tartness to pappus and chutneys is Green Sorrel.Commenting on the use of these leaves in Indian kitchens, Chef Sudhir Nair, who is the executive chef in The Westin Hyderabad Mindspace, says: The summer season is believed to be a good time to add these leaves to your food as they keep your body cool. It is also a season when appetite goes down and the tang of these leaves can help bring it back. Gongura, as we know, is used extensively in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. We must note that tamarind and Gongura leaves are used mainly in the preparation of meats that have a strong flavour like mutton. In case of chicken or seafood, the taste of the leaves might overpower the dish.Green Sorrel leaves: They are called Chukka Koora in Telugu and Khatta Palak in northern India. Their appearance is similar to spinach leaves but the leaves are darker and the stems thicker. Apart from being added to lentil recipes, they are also used in salads. Their tartness comes from oxalic acid, the quantity of which becomes higher as the leaves grow. They grow all year round but the peak season is summer.Tamarind leaves: Tamarind is one of the most common souring agents in Indian cuisine, and even its leaves are eaten in a few states. Chugur Dal and Chugur Gosht are relished during summer as this is the time when tender, crunchy tamarind leaves are available. These sour leaves are used in Ayurvedic medicines and Chef Sudhir tells us that they taste swell with potatoes too.Gongura leaves: Known as red sorrel leaves in English, these serrated leaves are extensively used in the two Telugu states, Maharashtra, the north-eastern states and other regions. Apart from the celebrated Gongura Mamsam and pickles, they can also be used to whip up a quirky pulihora. They come in green-stemmed and red-stemmed varieties and their pretty fruit pods are used to make red-hued teas.Health benefitsTamarind leavesThe polyphenols in tamarind have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory propertiesThese can protect against diseases such as heart disease, cancer and diabetesThe leaves were also used to promote wound healingTamarind contains a good amount of magnesium, an important mineral that plays a role in over 600 functions in the bodySeveral studies show that tamarind can combat many different microbes. It may help kill bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasitesGreen sorrelRich in vitamin C, it has always been valued for its ability to prevent scurvy, a disease caused by Vitamin C deficiency, especially at a time when other vitamin C-rich foods were not available or affordable.It acts as a diuretic; aids digestion; relieves constipation and alleviates bronchitis and asthma.Gongura leavesGongura is an excellent source of folate and Vitamin B6, both of which are needed to maintain low homocysteine levelsIt is a rich source of iron, vitamin C, anti-oxidants, calcium, iron, zinc and Vitamin A.Gongura leaves and flowers help cool the body and reduce inflammationThey also contain moderate levels of potassium, calcium and magnesium, which help strengthen the bones and are useful in relieving symptoms of fever.Recipe : Gongura MamsamIngredientsDiced lamb (boneless and tender) - 1 kg | Sunflower oil sunflower - 100 gm | Cloves - 4 | Green cardamom - 6 | Cinnamon stick - 1 | Cumin seeds - 1 tbs | Ginger garlic paste - 75 gm | Garlic chopped - 100 gm | Onion chopped - 250 gm | Red chilies split - 8 | Sorrel leaves - 1000 gm | Coriander powder - 2 tbs | Roasted cumin powder - 2tbs | Green chillies slit - 250 gm | Turmeric powder - 15gm | Salt - as required | Water - as required | Ghee - 50 gmMethodFor Gongura paste: Take a pan and heat some oil in it, then add some whole red chillies, cumin seeds, chopped garlic, green chillies and saute till the garlic sweats.Add washed sorrel leaves and simmer in the heat.

2021-08-05,https://indianexpress.com/article/world/inside-lebanons-worst-economic-meltdown-in-more-than-a-century-7439611/,"Rania Mustafas living room recalls a not-so-distant past, when the modest salary of a security guard in Lebanon could buy an air conditioner, plush furniture and a flat-screen TV.  But as the countrys economic crisis worsened, she lost her job and watched her savings evaporate. Now she plans to sell her furniture to pay the rent and struggles to afford food, much less electricity or a dentist to fix her 10-year-old daughters broken molar.  For dinner on a recent night, lit by a single cellphone, the family shared thin potato sandwiches donated by a neighbor. The girl chewed gingerly on one side of her mouth to avoid her damaged tooth.  I have no idea how well continue, said Mustafa, 40, at home in Tripoli, Lebanons second-largest city after Beirut.  Lebanon, a small Mediterranean country still haunted by a 15-year civil war that ended in 1990, is in the throes of a financial collapse that the World Bank has said could rank among the worlds worst since the mid-1800s. It is closing like a vise on families whose money has plummeted in value while the cost of nearly everything has skyrocketed.  Since fall 2019, the Lebanese pound has lost 90% of its value, and annual inflation in 2020 was 84.9%. As of June, prices of consumer goods had nearly quadrupled in the previous two years, according to government statistics. The huge explosion one year ago in the port of Beirut, which killed more than 200 people and left a large swath of the capital in shambles, only added to the desperation.  On Wednesday, Lebanon observed a day of mourning to mark the anniversary of the blast, and government offices and most businesses were closed for the occasion. Large crowds gathered around Beirut to commemorate the day and denounce their government, which has failed to determine what caused the explosion and who was responsible, much less to hold anyone accountable.  After a moment of silence on the highway overlooking the port, thousands of protesters marched toward downtown, where some fired fireworks and threw stones near the Parliament at security forces, who responded with volleys of tear gas.  The blast exacerbated the countrys economic crisis, which was long in the making, and there is little relief in sight.  Mourners march in Beirut, Lebanon on Wednesday, Aug. 4, 2021, to commemorate the one-year anniversary of the catastrophic port explosion in Beirut that killed more than 200 people.(Diego Ibarra Sanchez/The New York Times) Mourners march in Beirut, Lebanon on Wednesday, Aug. 4, 2021, to commemorate the one-year anniversary of the catastrophic port explosion in Beirut that killed more than 200 people.(Diego Ibarra Sanchez/The New York Times)  Years of corruption and bad policies have left the state deeply in debt and the central bank unable to keep propping up the currency, as it had for decades, because of a drop in foreign cash flows into the country. Now the bottom has fallen out of the economy, leaving shortages of food, fuel and medicine.  All but the wealthiest Lebanese have cut meat from their diets and wait in long lines to fuel their cars, sweating through sweltering summer nights because of extended power cuts.  The country has long endured electricity shortages, a legacy of a state that has failed to ensure basic services. To cover the gaps left by the state power supply, residents rely on privately owned, diesel-powered generators.  But the currency collapse has undermined that patchwork system.  As imported fuel has gotten more expensive, power cuts from the grid have stretched from a few hours a day to as long as 23 hours. So demand for power from generators has risen, along with the cost of the fuel to run them.  The resulting price hike has turned a utility essential for business, health and comfort into a luxury that many families can afford only in limited quantities, if at all.  Mustafa Nabo, from Syria, used to work long days on his electric sewing machine, powered by the grid and supplemental power from a generator.  Now the price for generated power is nearly 10 times what it was before the crisis began, so he rushes to work as much as he can during the two hours he gets power from the grid. But less work means less money, and he has cut back on food.  It is better to bring food than to pay for electricity, Nabo said.  Across Lebanon, the fuel shortages have led to long lines at gas stations, where drivers wait for hours to buy only a few gallons or none at all if the station runs out.  The supply of medicines has also become unreliable. The state is supposed to subsidize imports, but the crisis has strained that system, too.  Mustafa Nabo, a tailor who fled the Syrian civil war, sits in a darkened apartment in Beirut, July 7, 2021. Nabo used to work long days on his electric sewing machine here, but now must rush to work as much as he can during the two hours he gets power from Lebanons electrical grid. (Bryan Denton/The New York Times) Mustafa Nabo, a tailor who fled the Syrian civil war, sits in a darkened apartment in Beirut, July 7, 2021. Nabo used to work long days on his electric sewing machine here, but now must rush to work as much as he can during the two hours he gets power from Lebanons electrical grid. (Bryan Denton/The New York Times)  At a pharmacy in Tripoli, a line stretched from the sidewalk to the cash register, where anxious shoppers sought medicines that are now scarce after long being easy to obtain, such as painkillers and blood pressure medications. Other products had disappeared altogether, such as drugs to treat depression.  One shopper, Wafa Khaled, cursed the government after failing to find insulin for her mother and paying five times as much as she would have two years ago for baby food and seven times as much for formula.  The best thing for us would be for some foreign country to come occupy us so we could have electricity, water and security, she said.  The crisis could do lasting damage to three sectors that have historically made Lebanon stand out in the Arab world.  In a country once billed as the Switzerland of the Middle East, the banks are largely insolvent. Education has suffered a blow as teachers and professors seek better opportunities abroad. And health care has deteriorated as reduced salaries have caused an exodus of doctors and nurses.  The emergency ward at the American University of Beirut Medical Center, among the countrys best, has gone to seven physicians, from 12, and lost more than half of its 65 nurses since July 2020, said Eveline Hitti, the head of the department.  They were driven out by waves of COVID-19, declining salaries and the explosion in the Beirut port last year, which flooded the ward with casualties.  You ask yourself, why should I survive this? said Rima Jabbour, the head nurse.  Now COVID cases are increasing, as are food poisonings caused by poor refrigeration and alcohol overdoses.  The countrys political leaders have failed to slow the economic meltdown.  Officials have hampered the investigation into the port explosion, and a billionaire telecoms tycoon, Najib Mikati, is currently the third politician to try to form a government since the last Cabinet resigned after the blast.

Amid a financial collapse that could rank among the worlds worst since the mid-1800s is closing like a vise on Lebanons middle class.

Amid a financial collapse that could rank among the worlds worst since the mid-1800s is closing like a vise on Lebanons middle class. (Bryan Denton/The New York Times)  Mustafa Allouch, the deputy head of the Future Movement, a prominent political party, said, like many other Lebanese, that he feared that the political system, intended to share power between a range of sects, was incapable of addressing the countrys problems.  I dont think it will work anymore, he said. We have to look for another system, but I dont know what it is.  His greatest fear was blind violence born out of desperation and rage.  Looting, shooting, assaults on homes and small shops, he said. Why it hasnt happened by now, I dont know.  The crisis has hit the poor hardest.  Five days a week, scores of people line up for free meals from a charity kitchen in Tripoli, some equipped with cut-off shampoo bottles to carry their food because they cannot afford regular containers.  Robert Ayoub, the projects head, said demand is going up, donations from inside Lebanon are going down and the newcomers represent a new kind of poor: soldiers, bank employees and civil servants whose salaries have lost the bulk of their value.  In line on a recent day were a laborer who had walked an hour from home because he could not afford transportation; a brick layer whose work had dried up; and Dunia Shehadeh, an unemployed housekeeper who picked up a tub of pasta and lentil soup for her husband and three children.  This will hardly be enough for them, she said.  The countrys downward spiral has set off a new wave of migration as Lebanese with foreign passports and marketable skills seek better fortune abroad.  I cant live in this place, and I dont want to live in this place, said Layal Azzam, 39, before catching a flight to Saudi Arabia from Beiruts international airport.  She and her husband had returned to Lebanon from abroad a few years ago and invested $50,000 in a business. But she said that it had failed and that she worried they would struggle to find care if their children got sick.  Theres no electricity. They could cut the water. Prices are high.

Data from the Department of Fertilisers shows DAP stocks at 14.63 lakh tonnes (lt) as on October 31, compared to 44.95 lt and 64 lt for the same day in 2020 and 2019. MOP stock availability was, likewise, down to 7.82 lt, from the corresponding October-end levels of 21.70 lt in 2020 and 21.52 lt in 2019.  The situation isnt as bad in urea and complex fertilisers that contain different combinations of nitrogen (N), phosphorous (P), potash (K) and sulphur (S). October-closing stocks were lower for this year but not at near-crisis levels: 52.90 lt versus 79.76 lt (2020) and 78.95 lt (2019) in urea; and 30.98 lt versus 38.40 lt and 52.13 lt for NPKS complexes.  Farmers mainly plant mustard, potato, garlic, chana (chickpea), masoor (red lentil), matar (green peas), jeera (cumin) and dhaniya (coriander) during October. The peak rabi demand for fertilisers is during November-December, when sowing of wheat and onion happens. The current low stocks raise concerns on that front.  On Monday, however, Union Chemicals and Fertilisers Minister Mansukh Mandaviya termed reports of a shortage as rumours and denied them. Appealing to farmers not to hoard fertilisers, he claimed that 18 lt of DAP will be supplied in November, as against a projected demand of 17 lt. Supply of NPKS fertilisers, at 30 lt, will also surpass the demand of 15 lt for the month.  Interestingly, meanwhile, the official data also reveal higher overall sales of fertilisers in October. The month registered lower retail sales of DAP (13.9 lt against 15.37 lt in October 2020) and MOP (2.5 lt against 2.84 lt). But this was more than offset by increased sales of urea (20.66 lt versus 17.55 lt), NPKS (13.07 lt versus 8.7 lt) and single super phosphate (7.93 lt versus 4.69 lt).  Also Read | How some Punjab farmers are creating bio-enzymes from kinnow  The shortage of material has seemingly forced farmers to replace DAP and MOP, which contain 46% P and 60% K, with fertilisers having less of these nutrients. The latter includes single super phosphate (containing only 16% P and 11% S) and NPKS complexes such as 12:32:16:0, 10:26:26:0 and 20:20:0:13. To what extent the switch to low nutrient-content fertilisers would help meet demand in the coming weeks, however, remains to be seen.  Fertiliser firms have already hiked the retail prices of NPKS complexes like 10:26:26:0 and 12:32:16:0 from Rs 1,175-1,185 to Rs 1,450-1,500 per 50-kg bag.

The food and civil supplies department has withdrawn the price hike of around 12 essential items in the face of growing protests.  At the same time, local traders pointed out that tomato was being sold at Rs 120 per kg in the retail market, and drumstick at around Rs 200 per kg. The damage caused to standing crops by heavy rain in November has been cited as a major reason for the sky-high prices. Food and Civil Supplies Minister G R Anil told reporters the state government would make the necessary market intervention.  The prices of 12 non-subsidised essential items rose when Supplyco revised the monthly rates based on the wholesale price charged during the time of purchase. The government has scrapped the revised rates that came into effect the other day, considering the misery of the people, Anil said.  The prices of items like green gram, black gram, Bengal gram, red gram, coconut oil, fenugreek, green peas, chickpea, sortex raw rice, matta rice, biryani rice and masoor dal have not been changed. The Supplyco has been selling 13 essential items at subsidised rates through 1,506 retail outlets. No price rise has been effected on these items since April 2016, the minister said.  Further, as many as 35 items have been made available in the open market at a rate up to 50% lower than the market rate, he said. The provision of essential items at subsidised rates and purchasing items from neighbouring states without middlemen would be continued with. The government will not allow anyone to cause a price rise in the market. The online sale and home delivery of items launched by the Supplyco will be made available across the state, he said.

Its a mans best friend for a chilly winter night. But have you tried lemon rasam and that too made using masoor dal? Well, Bengaluru-based Teena Augustine has a handful of unique recipes like lemon rasam that she invented in her kitchen in the past few years. Though counsellor by profession, the Kochi-native is an ardent food lover, and also a recipe curator and food blogger. Her social media page, Ooonuready, is a testament to her love for fusion and unique delicacies.  Rich purple mashed organic sweet potatoes sautd in ghee with a dash of milk, cardamom, desiccated coconut and sugar rolled in the shape of laddoo is one of her drool-worthy creations. The almond flakes give it a nutty taste. I started to post recipes and photos of my culinary inventions seven years ago, Teena says. According to her, sweet potato halwa and laddoo have natural sweetness so they can be served without the sugar too.  Teenas experiments were influenced by her childhood spent in Kuwait. Our neighbours included Pakistanis, Philippinos and Indian communities like Kashmiris, Maharashtrians and others. There was a myriad of cultures and cuisines there and they influenced my culinary journey, says Teena.  Her recent hit recipe was the veldt grape chutney aka devils backbone chutney. Teena also has recipes on medicinal dishes and her changalamparanda chutney is one among them. The youngster who is a PhD holder from IIT Madras started to explore the medicinal dishes more to prepare a healthy menu for her mother who is diabetic. Two years ago, my mother was diagnosed with a blood clot in her brain. The doctor directed me to give her six-course meals a day. So I started to prepare unique fusion dishes for her, Teena says. Her invention of devils backbone chutney was quite an accident.  I bought devils backbone plant thinking of it was a cactus. Later I found its medicinal values and tried to create similar dishes using Brahmi which is good for the brain. Bhrahmi-nellikka-panikoorkka pachadi is another dish. Recently I have prepared payasam using aloe vera pulp as it is more like thick ada pradhaman, and healthy for digestion, says Teena.  Custard apple pudding, green gram dosa, pineapple puttu, beetroot payasam, strawberry pickle, corn halwa etc are a few worthy mentions from her recipe list. She has also widely explored the varieties of one of Malayalis favourite breakfasts, idli.
