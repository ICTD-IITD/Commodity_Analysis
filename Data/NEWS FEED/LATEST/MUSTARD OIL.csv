Read MoreNEW DELHI: The farmers protesting on Delhi borders for more than a month against the three agri laws on Saturday threatened to hold a tractor rally towards the national capital on Republic Day if their demands were not met. Meanwhile, the main opposition has asked the centre to withdraw the legislation and not be obstinate.Here are the key developments of the day:1. Hardening their position ahead of the next round of talks to be held with the government on January 5, protesting farmer unions said they will take out a tractor parade towards Delhi on January 26, when the country will celebrate Republic Day, if their demands were not met. Talking to mediapersons, the union leaders said time has come for ""decisive"" action as their demands have not been addressed by the government yet. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson will be the chief guest at the Republic Day parade at Rajpath on January 26. Farmer leader Darshan Pal Singh said their proposed parade will be called ""Kisan Parade"" and it will be held after the Republic Day parade. Thousands of farmers, mostly from Punjab and Haryana, have been camping at three Delhi border points - Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur for more than a month, demanding repeal of the three farm laws , a legal guarantee for minimum support price for their crops and two others. ""We intend to be peaceful and we told the government during the talks that it has only two options - either repeal the three laws or use force to evict us (from Delhi border points). The time has come for decisive action here, and we have chosen January 26 as the Republic Day represents the supremacy of the people,"" the union leaders said.2. A 75-year-old farmer protesting against the centre's new agri laws allegedly hanged himself at the Uttar Pradesh-Delhi border in Ghazipur in the morning. Sardar Kashmir Singh, a native of Bilaspur in Uttar Pradesh's Rampur district, hanged himself in a mobile toilet using a rope, police said. Deputy Superintendent of Police of Indirapuram Anshu Jain said that a suicide note written in Gurumukhi was found on him. Singh wrote in the suicide note that the government must repeal these farm laws as these are against the interests of farmers, according to a leader of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU). In the purported suicide note, Singh expressed anguish that though some people from Punjab died during the agitation, no one from Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand has sacrificed his life for the cause. He also requested the Sikh community to help his family marry off his two granddaughters and to address the domestic problems being faced by his married daughter. His body was handed over to his grandchildren who too were part of the protest in Ghazipur, police officer Jain said.3. Samajwadi Party (SP) president Akhilesh Yadav termed the death of a 57-year-old farmer due to heart attack while protesting against the centre's new farm laws at the Ghazipur border as ""disturbing"", and accused the ruling BJP of being ""heartless"". In a Hindi tweet, he said, ""On the first day of the new year itself, the news of the martyrdom of a farmer at the Ghazipur border is disturbing. The farmers are sacrificing their lives in the dense fog and cold, but the ruling party is sitting heartless. The ruthlessness seen in the BJP has never been seen so far."" Mohar Singh died of heart attack while protesting against the farm laws at the Ghazipur border in Ghaziabad on Friday. A resident of Bhagwanpur Nangal village in Baghpat district of Uttar Pradesh, Singh was rushed to a nearby hospital where the doctors declared him brought dead, an official said. Indirapuram Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) Anshu Jain had said that the farmer died of heart attack. Commenting on the incident, the state president of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU), Rajbir Singh, said all the farmers who lost their lives during the protest against the farm laws must get the status of a martyr.4. The Congress urged the government to abandon its ""obstinate attitude"" and agree to the demands of the farmers protesting the new farm laws amid cold weather conditions. Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra said reports of deaths of farmers while protesting at the Delhi border amid harsh winter conditions are ""disturbing"". ""According to media reports, 57 farmers have lost their lives while scores are unwell. The government is showing gross insensitivity by not acceding to the demands of the protesting farmers,"" said the Congress general secretary and its Uttar Pradesh in-charge. Senior Congress leader and former Union minister P Chidambaram saluted the resoluteness of the farmers. ""The government must relent and agree to keep the farm laws in abeyance pending its repeal. Any new law must take into account the needs and desires of the farming community,"" he tweeted.5. The country's rabi foodgrains production including wheat in the ongoing 2020-21 crop year is expected to be better than the previous year's record of 153.27 million tonne, according to agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar. Sowing of rabi (winter) crops is underway. The rabi sowing begins from October immediately after the harvest of kharif (summer) crops. Wheat and mustard are major rabi crops. The crop year runs from July to June. Tomar said the country's agriculture sector performed well during 2020 as foodgrains production rose to a record in the kharif season with farmers working hard despite the COVID-19 pandemic and proving their relevance. ""This year, we hope better foodgrain production in the rabi season than last year (same season),"" he said. For the 2020-21 crop year, the Centre has set a target of a record foodgrains output of 301 million tonne, out of which it expects 151.65 million tonne to come from the rabi season. Further, the minister said progress to be made in the recent government initiatives including two new farm laws on marketing, formation of 10,000 FPOs (Farmer Producers Organisations ), Rs 1 lakh crore Agriculture Infrastructure Fund, will also benefit farmers and boost the sector. ""I hope farmers' hard work and the Modi government's pro-farmer policies will strengthen the agriculture sector.

Scattered thunderstorm and rain has been predicted for the next two days, agriculture department officials said.Most of the farmers protesting at the Delhi borders have been attending the agitation and coming home from time to time to look after their crops in northern Haryana .Farmer Rajeev Sharma from Hasanpur village in Naraingarh area of Ambala district said, The recent rain and cold weather has come as a boost for the wheat crop, which is growing well. I come home from the protest in Delhi after about 10 days to harvest potatoes. I have also grown wheat. Another farmer, Sukhminder from Sapehra village of Ambala said, The rain has saved our hard work of irrigating fields amid the ongoing protest. The weather is pleasant for wheat and mustard and we are happy that god has irrigated our fields.Districts deputy director, agriculture (DDA) Girish Nagpal said more than about 75,000 hectares of land in Ambala is under wheat cultivation.Ongoing weather conditions are conducive enough for better yield of Rabi crops. At this stage of wheat, cold weather is also beneficial, DDA Nagpal said.He added that thousands of farmers in the state, including Ambala, are given timely information on weather through text messages on their mobile phones from Chaudhary Charan Singh Haryana Agriculture Universitys, agriculture meteorology department.To a query on whether the area cultivated under wheat in Ambala has declined due to the farmers agitation, an official said, There has been no decline in the area and more than about 75,000 hectares of land is cultivated under wheat. Not even one acre of land is empty in the district. Farmers are never careless about their crops.

2021-01-04,https://www.newindianexpress.com/opinions/editorials/2021/jan/04/go-beyond-existingexpenditure-in-budget-2245036.html,"The Union Budget for FY22 will be presented in a few weeks, but Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has partly briefed out its contents, more than once. In her own words, it will include a massive public sector investment and expenditure push on infrastructure and healthcare.This isnt anything extraordinary but an essential act, because of its welfaristic nature and the multiplier effect on the economy. But what is a matter of concern is whether the promised spending binge entails elements of the Rs 111 lakh crore infrastructure bonanza first announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in August 2019. Given the governments record of repackaging programmes and outlays, such a move will end up as a tasteless reheat of past announcements and must be avoided.Theres nothing wrong in chest-beating about landmark initiatives, but the infrastructure investment pipeline didnt cut the mustard when it was rolled out as a kickstart-the-economy package in 2019 itself. To refresh the devil in the details, every year, the Centre and states spend over Rs 10 lakh crore on infrastructure; so the proposed Rs 111 lakh crore for five years didnt enthuse many.But in FY21, the sum to be spent was significantly higher than usual and it cheered up policy watchers. However, there has been little progress since then. If in December 2019, 44% of the total Rs 111 lakh crore-worth projects were under implementation and Rs 22 lakh crore or 20% were under development stage, it remained so as of December 2020.Moveover, the Centres share translates to only 39%, while an equal sum will be borne by cash-starved states. The remaining 21% has to come from the ailing private sector. One noteworthy development, though, is the creation of the India Investment Grid to handhold all greenfield and brownfield infra projects.It will resolve some of the long-standing issues including delayed permissions and land acquisition, which means project execution should be relatively better. That said, the government must think out of the box to ensure that the expenditure push in FY22 stretches beyond what has already been announced.",Go beyond existing expenditure in budget,MUSTARD OIL

It contains natural antioxidants. Gamma Oryzonal present in rice bran oil reduces bad cholesterol and improves lipid profile, Malik added.Brand experts, however, had a different view. I do believe there are several issues at play here. There is brand Adani, brand Saurav, and finally the product, oil. The farmer agitation, the association of brand Adani with the ruling dispensation, Sourav and rumours of his political leanings, are all adding to the jamboree of discontent, said brand expert, Harish Bijoor.He urged brands to stay away from politics and religion. Both these subjects divide audiences. Brands love united audiences as all are then their potential consumers.

The common ingredient in all of them? PepperThere is a drizzle outside when we sit for lunch.On the menu, is ammas milagu kuzhambu (pepper curry) and hot rice. I scoop a heapful of rice on my plate, add a dash of gingelly oil, and two spoonfuls of the curry. The drizzle becomes a steady downpour and by the time I wolf down the rice, there is thunder and a howling wind. But I am prepared to deal with the weather: the curry, a tangy concoction of pepper, pepper, and more pepper, leaves my palate with a mild burning sensation typical to the spice. It keeps me warm on the inside, at least for a while.Come winter and every part of India starts whipping up winter curries specific to the region. In Tamil Nadu, milagu kuzhambu is a seasonal special. During my childhood, my grandmother would serve this curry or pepper rasam with hot rice and appalam during winters, recalls 74-year-old YouTuber Gita Rajamani, who runs the popular channel Agrahara Recipes from her home in Kallidaikurichi, Tirunelveli district. Back then, in Sirkazhi where I grew up, it would sometimes rain for 15 days straight and this curry was a dinnertime staple to keep warm, she adds.During winters, when nights were dark and the stone mortar and pestle kept in the corner of the house was too cold to be held to make idli batter, milagu kuzhambu came to our rescue, says Gita. Made with plenty of tamarind, that Gita says is a natural preservative, the curry would be stored in a stone pot and was good to be had for 15 days. Pepper was the chief spice employed in Tamil cuisine, she points out. Green and red chillies were actually introduced to us by the Portuguese; but now though, we use more chillies.Pepper Rasam from South India which is very common and popular which can be served with steamed rice and ghee.Pepper was used extensively in winter, in curries and rasams. Betel leaves were used to keep lungs healthy during cold weather, points out Gita. I make a rasam with the leaves; once the regular tamarind rasam is done simmering, I place a betel leaf over it, switch off the stove, cover, and let the juice seep into the rasam, she explains adding that she removes the leaf a little later.In western Tamil Nadu, horsegram dal and rasam are winter delicacies and in places such as Coimbatore where the weather generally leans towards the colder side, the lentil is cooked through the year. In my household, we make kollu paruppu (dal) twice a week, especially during winter since the dish is considered heat-inducing, says Dharchana Muruganandam, who grew up in Pollachi. We make rasam with the water the dal has been cooked in; the dish has crushed shallots in it instead of garlic, she explains.Gita says that horsegram can also be incorporated in a thogayal (thick chutney) by grinding the boiled lentil with onions, tomatoes, pepper, and garlic.

As diverse as the food offerings in our country are, the science behind them is even more so. And of the veritable army of reluctant chefs created in urban India during lockdown, at least a few must prefer learning these hows and whys, instead of the how-many-teaspoons. That is the gamble Krish Ashok and Penguin Random House have taken with their recent book Masala Lab: The Science of Indian Cooking.With chapters covering everything from zero-pressure cooking to the science of spices and more, the title offers explanations and cheat sheets galore. Tongue-in-cheek writing coupled with scientific explanations by experts make up a large portion of this book, and the result is oddly gripping. Take, for instance, a small segment titled Mouthfeel  Ashok begins by describing the crunch of a pani puri before moving into an aside about decibels, bats and the way that ultrasound travels, and then concluding confidently: We can, it turns out, feel a good pani puri in our bones. Quite literally.I keep clarifying that a lot of what I talk about is applicable to urban Indian cooking, that has evolved in a very specific way over the last few decades. We dont always have access to fresh produce, and the quality of what we get  both meat and vegetables  is dubious, with concerns about pesticides and other things. So we tend to err on the side of overcooking, just to be safe, he says.He points out that because of a lack of inherent flavour in produce, urban Indian cuisine tends to be spice-heavy, while that in rural or small-town India has always been minimal. He adds: I would argue that it is a lot closer to Italian cooking, in that it relies on a fewer but more quality ingredients that are grown locally, giving the example of the magnificently tasty eggplants of Tirunelveli.An added segue is his observation that hinterland cooking is simplistic in technique, with fewer steps, because the rural woman has so much more to do in a day, from collecting water to tending to the fields and so on.Freedom to experimentAshok emphasises, A big part of the book is about trying to find generalised algorithms, for how to make something taste, say, Gujarati or Bengali or Malabari. And thus, free people from having to bother about authenticity: if you use paanch phoron and mustard oil, it is going to taste Bengali no matter what else you do.And what better way to look at regional variations in Indian cooking, than through the lens of everyones favourite feast  the biryani? Ashoks final chapter is dedicated entirely to that one dish, from its various layers of rice and protein to the different spices, techniques and flavour notes preferred in different regions. In this chapter, he writes, We will marshal every single food science trick we have learnt over the last 200 pages or so to make good biryani at home. Does he succeed? That is for the reader to find out.Masala Lab: The Science of Indian Cooking is available at leading bookstores and on Amazon Kindle.",Krish Ashok’s non-cookbook for kitchen nerds looks at the science behind cooking,MUSTARD OIL

Add some ghee and roast the moong dal. Keep it aside. Take the rice in a strainer and wash it. Roast it in ghee for a minute in the pan.Add the sugarcane juice, one cup of milk, one cup of water and pressure-cook it on medium flame for about five to six whistles (without keeping the inner vessel) until the rice turns soft.Now, add half a cup of powdered jaggery/palm jaggery or natural brown sugar or karuppatti as per your preference.The pongal will melt but will start to thicken after cooking for a few minutes. Add two tablespoons of fresh ghee and ensure that the pongal doesnt stick to the bottom of the vessel.In another pan, add small pieces of coconut, cashews and fry it in ghee and add to the pongal.Crush a few cardamoms and add it with the skin. Mix well and serve.VariationsYou can use any millet instead of rice.While saffron is not added in traditional south Indian pongal, if you wish, you can add it along with a very small pinch of edible camphor.TipsFor pongal, pudu paccha arisi is recommended because it gives a lovely fresh fragrance and turns soft quickly. It is also much cheaper than regular rice variants. Use of pudu paccha arisi is also considered very auspicious during Pongal because its a symbolic celebration of nature and its harvest.Puli Pongal by Jeyashri Suresh(Instagram @Jeyashris Kitchen)IngredientsBroken rice/arisi kurunai: 1 cup Tamarind a lemon sized Sesame oil: 2 tbsp + 2 tsp Mustard seeds: 1/4 tsp Peanuts: 2 tbsp Chana dal: 1 tsp Urad dal: 1 tsp Green chilli: 1 Dried red chilli: 2 Water: 3 1/2 cups Turmeric powder: 1/4 tsp Asafoetida: a generous pinch Curry leaves: few Salt as neededMethodSoak a small lemon-sized tamarind in 1/2 cup hot water for 10 minutes.

Mix well to ensure no lumps are formed.Cover the cooker and pressure-cook for three whistles.Once the pressure is released, open and add two teaspoons of sesame oil.Serve with vadams or appalam.NoteThe water measurement was perfect for this rice kurunai. If the broken rice is little finer than the one I used, you can add three cups of water.Country vegetables sambar by Banumathi Balasubramanian(Instagram @Banumathi Balasubramanian)IngredientsToor dal: 1/2 cup Water: 2 cupTurmeric: 1/4 tsp Sesame oil: 2 tspDry red chilli: 6 Chana dal: 1 tbspCoriander seeds: 2 tbsp Fenugreek: 1 tsp Pumpkin Ash gourd Sweet potato Broad beans Chow chowField beans: 1/4 cup Grated coconut: 2 tbsp Asafoetida; a small pieceTamarind water: 2 cups Salt to tasteMethodPressure-cook 1/2 cup toor dal with two cups water and 1/4 teaspoon turmeric powder.

Add a small piece of solid asafoetida and two cups of tamarind water extracted from a lemon-sized tamarind. Add salt. Bring to a boil. Cook until the vegetables are soft. Add in the cooked dal and the ground spice powder/paste. Add in a cup of water if needed to adjust consistency. This kozhambu should be a little thicker than regular sambar. Bring to a boil. Cook for two more minutes. Turn the heat off. Temper with mustard seeds, curry leaves and 2-3 red chillies broken to pieces in one tablespoon sesame oil. We dont add chopped cilantro/coriander leaves to this sambar.Red rice ven pongal by Padma Balasubramanian(Instagram @Padma Balasubramanian)IngredientsRed rice: 1 cup Moong dal: 1/4 cup Pepper: 1 tsp Jeera: 1 tsp Hing powder: 1/2 tsp Ginger: a small piece, finely chopped Curry leaves: a few Cashews: 10 Ghee: 2 tbsp Oil: 1 tbspMethodWash and soak red rice for an hour in 3.5 glasses of water. Wash the moong dal, drain water and add it to the soaked red rice. Transfer to a pressure cooker and cook for six whistles. Keep the stove in sim for another five minutes and switch off.

Add edible camphor. Roast a few cashew nuts in ghee and garnish the dish.NotesAny millet like barnyard millet, little millet or thinai works well for this millet akkaravadisal. I personally dont prefer adding cardamom powder as it will suppress the flavour, or saffron and edible camphor. The consistency of the akkaravadisal is perfect and stays intact for 4-5 hours.Kambu vella pongal or Bajra jaggery pongal by Praveen Kumar(Instagram @Awesome Cuisine)IngredientsKambu (bajra): 1 cup Moong dal: 1/4 cup Jaggery: 1 1/2 cups Ghee: 1/4 cup Cashew nuts: a handfulRaisins: a handful Cardamoms: a few Water: 6 cupsMethodDry roast the bajra until it gives out an aroma, and keep it aside.To the same pan, add the moong dal and roast for a minute.

Thats how during that time dried and bottled food items especially the condiments like dried onion powder, lemon powder, fried onion ringlets among a gamut of several such other food products.Thats when a city-based entrepreneur Anubhav Bhatnagar, an XLRI alumnus launched a food range with a shelf life of 12-18 months. His startup Zillis is incubated under Atal Incubation Center ALEAP We-hub.The quick DIYs range that also helps to reduce the cooking time have preservatives in them. So while it is about quick food, what assures the same is healthy? Shares Anubhav, The fruits and vegetables have a short shelf life of 7-15 days and they attract fungus and bacteria because of the moisture in them. We follow an age-old technique of dehydration of preserving the food by removing moisture.He cites an example of grandmothers using the process of dehydration by drying chips and papad under the sunlight to remove moisture content.Once dried it can stay up to 1-2 years without attracting fungus and bacteria. Our process is based on the similar concept of drying the fruit and vegetable under hot air to remove moisture content and then making the powder, he adds.He tried making the first product in the kitchen using a microwave oven. I failed multiple times, burnt a lot of onions and garlic to arrive at my desired product. I tried using dehydrated onion and garlic in my curries to understand the difference (good or bad) it brought to my recipes. I was excited to find out that my curries even tasted better and just a spoonful of these powders was enough to bring that natural flavour. Not only did I not have to chop onions and garlic, he says.The powders did not require any roasting as well since they were dehydrated and hence, in concentrated form. This reduced my cooking time almost to half! This is how to we provide RTC products to our customer without compromising on health, he shares. The products that his startup offers are red onion powder, tomato powder, green chilli powder, garlic powder among other items.We also have five blends in our product catalogue and we are consistently working towards launching many more.Kolkata Jhal Muri (Murmura/Puffed Rice) Masala can be used in puffed rice with chopped onions, green chillies, coriander leaves, coconut, peanuts mixed in a small quantity of mustard oil and blended with the goodness of spices which makes it a very tasty and healthy snack.

Sandys cheery new Besant Nagar cafe is a rose-tinted tribute to the past with its old school sandwiches, milkshakes and dcor. A bitter-sweet reminder of our pre-COVID lives.Originally planned as the first of a new line of cafs called Sandys Toasteries, the Besant Nagar space evolved through the many challenges of 2020, and finally opened recently under the familiar flagship brand instead. Now, this is a relaunch of the Sandys brand, says Sandesh Reddy, the founder, adding, We wanted to break away from what we have been doing for the past 12 years. To reinvent ourselves.In times of tumult, such as this, people crave familiarity, leaning on food that reminds them of simpler days. So, not surprisingly, Sandesh has chosen to stick with his core strength, continuing to offer uncomplicated comfort food, with a focus on popular flavours. However, proving that this is a grown up version of his first menu more than a decade ago, the plates are cleverly engineered, harnessing a global array of techniques, recipes and ingredients and influences to create deceptively simple meals. Like the steak sandwich, featuring buttery meat set between thick slices of grilled Texan toast, smeared with mustard and aioli. Or the light, breaded onion rings, steamy inside and crisp outside, topped with microgreens. Or a bowl of hummus, drizzled with olive oil and studded with sturdy chunks of falafel.Desserts are indulgent. The tiny shake shake comprises a thick chocolate shake, topped with a hunk of cake balanced on top of the glass. Of course, theres one for Instagram: Milo tiramisu, designed like a pull up dessert. Im more excited about the fact that there are cortados and Aussie lattes on the menu though: till the vaccine arrives at least we can circle the world on a cloud of caffeine.Sandys Kitchen & Chocolate laboratory is at 5, 4th Main Road, Besant Nagar.The Butterfly EffectNever underestimate a sandwich. They can be wonderful things, as any midnight snacker can attest. At newly-launched Butterfly Effect on Cenotaph Road, popular Kiwi chef Willi Wilson, who was formerly executive Chef at The Park Chennai, has created a line of inventive gourmet sandwiches.The space, launched by architect Junaid Ahmed, is chic and inviting, flooded with natural light. Over a plate of smoky chicken wings, freshly fried and finished with a clingy hot and sweet sauce, Willi says the menu, built around continental and Italian favourites, focuses on food that is sustainable, quick, tasty, fresh.Of course continental food in India has come a long way from the 90s, thanks to Chefs like Willi, moving from stodgy carbs smothered in white sauce and processed cheese to bright inventive takes on classics.For the sandwiches, diners can choose between white bread, wholewheat, baguettes, ciabatta and focaccia. And while fillings include the obligatory roasted chicken, tuna-mayo and vegetable club with cheese, the cafe also offers more unusual sandwiches, including curried apple, set in creamy mayonnaise, chunky with almonds and raisins; chicken quesadilla with oozing cheese and grilled Caprese pesto with mozzarella.Watch out for the just-introduced Asian menu, featuring hawker classics like a spicy Indonesian Naso Goreng, served with egg and chicken wings. Or Willis cheeky Daddy Wus chicken, a tribute to sweet and spicy pop-Chinese food. And, a steamy bowl of creamy cajun spiced butter prawns spooned over warm rice.Restaurants are still struggling with the fallout of the pandemic, fighting hard to retain staff, follow rules of physical distancing, keep customers safe and  though all this  keep updating menus to stay relevant in a competitive market. But, despite the setbacks of 2020, the cheery burst of new openings, as well as encouraging return of diners, signal a new beginning. And what better way to do it than with comfort food that pays tribute to the past.The Butterfly Effect Caf, is at 22 Chamiers Road, Nandanam.This weekly column tracks the citys shifting culinary landscape.

And not just any kind of saag, but a dish of mustard leaves. Winter, as we know in the north, is the time for sarson ka saag  that creamy dish that so delightfully complements makkey ki roti  or rotis prepared with maize.I studied the menus of the little eateries in and around my neighbourhood to see if anyone was known for its saag and roti. Turned out there was one, Baa Bistro, which had the dish on the menu, along with a Rajasthani thhali. I am fond of Rajasthani food, and gattey ki sabzi  a spicy dish of lentil cakes in gravy  is a particular favourite. So I licked my chops and got ready to place my order.Life is full of little disappointments: It was a rainy night, the delivery agents had called it a day, and I was told that I was not going to get my saag and roti. But, quite like a good hound, once I am on the trail of something, I dont give up easily. I went back to my research, and zeroed in on an old favourite: a small restaurant called SinglaSweets which had fed me little hillocks of bedmi sabzi in kinder times. Singla had sarson ka saag and makkey ki roti, and was delivering (Ph: 9697828888, 011-22232323).The food arrived. And it was so good that I called the owner of the shop to find out about the fare. The trick in the greens was that it was simply cooked  it had neither onions, nor garlic or ginger. It merely had a tempering of ghee and whole red chillies. The roti, again, was surprisingly soft. It was not soaked in ghee, but was nicely moist.I dipped a piece into the saag and popped it into my mouth, and went back to my village, where this was a regular part of our winter fare. I grew up on various kinds of rotis, prepared with millet, maize and gram. There were all kinds of greens too: mustard, fenugreek, and bathua, to name just a few. In the village, of course, a dollop of white butter went on top of the rotis, while the saag was topped with large quantities of ghee. Bliss.Wed also ordered a plate of malai kofta, and that was a rich concoction of cashew, cream, and paneer. But the saag was what the doctor had ordered (without the ghee of course).It rained the next day again, and the heart called out for more saag and roti. I rang up Baa Bistro (9911214567, 9930983076), and found it open.I ordered the saag-roti combo, and the Rajasthani thhali for lunch. The saag was spicy but tasty, and the rotis were thick and firm, the way most makkey ki rotis are. I enjoyed the Rajasthani dishes  especially the hot gattey and the equally spicy mangori-papad ki sabzi. There was a gulab jamun, too, which we shared.On a cold winters day, saag and roti warm up the heart. And a hot and squishy gulab jamun is like the icing  or rather the warm syrup  on top.The writer is a seasoned food critic","Cold weather food, delivered at home in Delhi",MUSTARD OIL

To illustrate the Dhokla mix, flour consisted of Udad dal, Chana dal, Sugar, Salt, Sodium Bicarbonate, Citric acid and Asafoedtida. The ingredients of the Rava-Idli mix were Gram dal, Udad dal, Rava, Citric acid, Salt, Green Chilli, Curry leaves, and Mustard seeds.The advance ruling bench has to delve deeply into the classification and sub-headings. While products such as the Dhokla mix, Dahi wada mix, Bhajiya mix and Idli mix fell under one sub-heading; Rava-Idli mix, Upma mix and Muthiya mix fell under another subheading. This despite the fact that all products were essentially flour and spices.The saving grace, there was no difference in the GST rate, which was the same at 5%. As regards Chutney powder, which was supplied free with a few flour mix categories, the AAR held it to be a mixed supply of goods  this too had a GST rate of 5%.",A ruling ‘unites’ foodies with single GST rate,MUSTARD OIL
2021-01-16,https://indianexpress.com/article/lifestyle/health/eight-winter-superfoods-diet-immunity-skin-7145095/,"Winter brings a divergent change in the weather after the wet monsoon and scorching heat of summer. The changing weather necessitates a modification in nutrition as well. Especially this year, our dietary habits can be a decisive differentiator for our health and immunity. Working from home has become the new norm, resulting in far lesser physical activity and a lot more opportunities for eating. It can lead to weight gain, joint problems, vitamin D deficiency, constipation, and so on, says Pradeep Singh, wellness and nutrition expert, and certified dietitian.To add to that, winter brings with it dry skin and hair fall, which are also causes of concern. Therefore, enriching our diet with superfoods may help deal with all these problems and provide you with immunity, good skin, great digestion, and overall holistic health, he tells indianexpress.com.But what are these superfoods, and how do they benefit us? In a nutshell, superfoods are those edibles that contain a high nutritional value and provide us with a variety of health benefits.Below, he shares eight such superfoods that you should be eating this winter.Garlic: If youre a fan of garlic, winter is the time for you to have it. Garlic is a great source of selenium, germanium, and sulfhydryl amino acids, which help in boosting immunity. It is also a natural antibiotic and is effective in preventing urinary tract infections, lowering blood pressure, preventing bronchitis and pneumonia. This makes garlic one of the best winter diet additions.Cinnamon: Everybodys kitchen has this ingredient for sure. Usually shelved with cloves, nutmeg, and other spices, cinnamon is a great source of iron and calcium. It is essential for the production of healthy red blood cells and can also help in reducing spikes in blood sugar levels. A simple way to incorporate it into your diet would be, adding it to your morning cup of coffee or tea.Traditional Indian spices and herbs which are known to boost immunity find more takers in the COVID-19 times. (Source: Getty Images/Thinkstock) Traditional Indian spices and herbs which are known to boost immunity find more takers in the COVID-19 times. (Source: Getty Images/Thinkstock)Almond and walnuts: Just like blankets warm you up in winters, these nuts can warm you up on the inside. Both almonds and walnuts lower bad cholesterol, control blood sugar levels, and reduce inflammation. Walnuts are a great source of Omega-3, while almonds are rich in Vitamin E, antioxidants, and magnesium. So if youre craving a light snack, dont hesitate to pick up a few almonds and walnuts to munch on in between meals.Sweet potatoes: Sweet potatoes are great comfort food. They are also a rich source of fibre, Vitamin A, and potassium. If you want to go easy on the calories and high on the nutrients, sweet potatoes are the answer in winter. It can help with relieving constipation, building immunity, and reducing inflammation.Mustard greens: Mustard greens, just like other green leafy vegetables, are among the most nutritious foods you can eat.

As an added benefit, they have high amounts of antioxidants, vitamin K, and improve overall eye health.Pea protein: Arguably the most complete plant protein, pea protein, is made from yellow split peas.

I mentioned AKUS: The Brrgrr Co. to them one evening, and they assured me that the burgers were Yum. I had first heard about this place when some friends marked an anniversary picnic with AKUS. The praise that followed prompted me to take a look at this burger heaven. I found that it had an outlet in Gurugram and Delhis Defence Colony (call 8826669279).I looked at the menu and saw that they had an interesting mix of burgers: freshly minced lamb patties, chicken breasts, or a prawn patty. We asked for three kinds: a Bold Bingo, Meister and Chalapeno.I had the Bold Bingo, tasted the other two, and loved them all! Mine had a lamb patty, blue cheese, caramelised onions, blended cheese and lettuce. The buns were soft, lamb was juicy, the blue cheese gave it a just-right piquancy, and the lettuce lent crunch.The patty wasnt smothered with sauce (as some MNC burgers are), so it didnt drip messily, but gave the burger a kick. A young nephew who had a Bold Bingo the next day said that the meat, cheese and onions complemented one another well, and what really worked for him was the fact that the burger didnt become a gooey mess in his hands, and the size was just right.The Chalapeno had a stuffing of a grilled chicken breast, cheese blend, lettuce, jalapeo, peppers and jalapeo spread. This was ordered keeping in mind that one member of the household loves hot food  and she felt it was the best shed ever had.The master was the Meister  a lamb patty, with a fried egg, bacon, cheese, caramelised onions and sauce. The egg and the bacon (imported, says the menu) gave the burger a delicious twist. And the egg, of course, added another level of texture and taste.In the vegetarian section, there is a burger called Master Wu with wild mushroom and jalapeos, and a Master Blu with wild mushroom and blue cheese. The grilled Beetburger has a beetroot patty, and the Giza consists of a crisp potato and cheese patty. There is a gluten-free bun on offer, and a DIY kit.If youre hearty eater, this burger wont be enough for a meal. You may need side dishes, or if you are a growing boy (like the aforementioned nephew), you may want to have a full meal after the burger.There are quite a few sides, too. House made chicken nuggets with honey mustard mayo, skin-on French fries, onion rings and more. The fries are of three types: with salt and parsley, paprika, or truffle Parmesan and parsley.Prices range from 250 to 285 for vegetarian, and between 250 and 450 for the non-vegetarian burgers.Now I know why the young neighbours thought the burgers were yum. They indeed are. Yummilicious, Id say.The writer is a seasoned food critic",The burger with a good mouth and hand feel at AKU’S Delhi,MUSTARD OIL

To know more, MetroPlus makes a visitI grab a leaf of peppermint from a bed of mint leaves and taste the intense freshness. Next, I look at thyme and smell the powerful aroma. A little away, purple basil with a beautiful, coppery glow beckon. I crush a lemon balm leaf, and take in the uplifting, mild scent.I am at Parna Farms, Coimbatores first urban hydroponic farm, located right in the heart of the city at an industrial building campus. Spread across 3,000 square feet, it grows 2,520 plants.Akhila Vijayaraghavan | Photo Credit: S Siva SaravananOur fresh lemon balm leaves impart a subtle flavour and fragrance, making it especially nice for custards, jam and jellies, cakes and tea, says Akhila Vijayaraghavan, owner of the farm. The purple basil is used for colour in salads. Except maybe amaranthus and palak (spinach), you can eat all the greens we grow here raw, says Akhila pointing to varieties of lettuce, basil, bok choy, and kale.Asian water spinach (kang kong), red gongura, mustard leaves and methi (fenugreek) are some of the new additions. We also grow dill leaves, which are used as garnish for fish and meat dishes and pastas. Fresh peppermint extracts are used in baking. We constantly try new crops based on demand, after rounds of trial-and-error.Peppermint grown at the hydrophonic Farm | Photo Credit: S Siva SaravananA graduate of Molecular Biology from the University of Glasgow, Akhila ran her own environmental consultancy for over 10 years before turning an urban farmer. I worked with a lot of companies, from pharmaceuticals to FMCG, and learnt that supply of quality end-product is a difficult task. Agriculture has always been one of my passions; I was interested in food crops. A herb can be used in cooking, to extract oil, extract nutrients in dry form, and maybe in alternative medicine, perfumery the possibilities are exciting, adds Akhila.She researched hydroponic methodology and educated herself on farming before diving into it. Anyone can do it, it is not rocket science, she says.Hydroponics combines both sustainability and technology. In indoor hydroponic cultivation, the control on nutrient supply ensures more quality produce, for example improved oil content in herbs, as well as better crop yield. A hydroponic mint has more methanol content than a soil-grown one. The system also uses 80% less water than conventional agriculture. The water is upcycled for reuse.At Parna Farms, greens are grown using the nutrient film technique (NFT), where a thin film of nutrient-rich water with macronutrients like nitrogen, potassium, phosphorous and calcium nitrate, and micronutrients like manganese and zinc nourish the roots of the plants.Seedlings at the nursery at the hydroponic farm | Photo Credit: S Siva SaravananThe farm has germination area that uses coco peat to sprout plants, and a nursery where net cups (small planters) are filled with clay pebbles. There is also the grow system, which involves metal stands and PVC pipes attached to a covered nutrient tank that pumps water to the plants. We incubate the net cups in a plastic tray for a couple of weeks. Once the plant grows roots, it is transferred to the main system with higher nutrients in the water. This is where it is fully grown and harvested, explains Akhila.Hydroponic agriculture, she says, has existed for over 3,000 years, with the Hanging Gardens of Babylon being one of the often quoted examples of this technique. It is one of the more accessible forms of modern agriculture, tackling the dual problems of water scarcity and shortage of farmland. It reduces soil-borne pests and diseases.Akhila says the objective is to ensure that customers get fresh, pesticide-free produce within three hours of harvest. Though a palak bunch from here costs 130, they are willing to pay the premium to enjoy good health, says Akhila, adding, You are what you eat.

Prepared with these antioxidant-rich carrots and spices, the velvety, reddish drink helps us battle the cold in North India. Chilled to the bone in a long cold spell, I had been thinking of kanji when a book arrived at my doorstep with an ode to the drink.(Stay up to date on new book releases, reviews, and more with The Hindu On Books newsletter. Subscribe here.)There was no kanji at home, so I had to make do with an appetising description of it in a story called A Brief History of the Carrot by Rosie Dastgir, included in the Claire Chambers-edited anthology, Desi Delicacies: Food Writing from Muslim South Asia. He poured out two glasses that glowed in the afternoon light. Room temperature, as the aunts recipe specified. The taste of it was sour and pungent and strangely restorative, though not exactly as he remembered, it goes. Was some vital ingredient missing?Wheres the story?Chambers writes that South Asian kitchens are the engines of an entire culture. The volume seeks to capture this essence through essays and short stories. The picture that we get of Muslim South Asian food is extremely eclectic, taking in everything from taco parties to lotus root slow-cooked in yoghurt, and from khichri to barfi, the York University professor says in a recent interview.The collection is quite mouth-watering, especially since each chapter ends with a recipe. The works of fiction, however, left me a bit puzzled. These are nice food pieces, no doubt, but are they stories?Take, for instance, Jackfruit with Tamarind by Mahruba T. Mowtushi and Mafruha Mohua. The short story is peppered with aunty this and uncle that  interesting characters, all, but each of them making only brief appearances. I would have liked to know more about them, especially about Manwara aunty, for I enjoyed the comparison between her fish curry and Ammas.Amma is fussy when it comes to preparing a fish. It has to be cleaned numerous times... She then smears the pieces with turmeric and salt and lightly fries them  for a minute or two  in mustard oil. Amma has a fervid dislike of people who skip this process. Macher jhol should have a light, refreshing taste and so spices are added sparingly, the authors write, adding, Amma always complained of Manwara auntys macher jhol, which contained such inordinate quantities of vegetables and an odd assortment of greens that eating it was like walking through a virgin jungle with a machete in hand!It is always fun to read about food, but the problem is that this isnt really a story. It works well as an essay, and is eminently readable, with little descriptions of dishes after every paragraph or two. But a story needs a beginning, middle and end, and this had none.Stomach rumblingThe Hairy Curry by Asiya Zahoor does have a twist in the end. The story is about young Gulla, a Kashmiri boy who has moved to Srinagar and is working in Bibijis kitchen. The description of a lotus-stem dish is invigorating. The velvety white curry was first to touch his palate. The softness and tangy taste was a delight. Each of the spices had given their essence fully to the curry. Its starchy texture, carrying the spices that complemented each other, was delectable. The lotus stems were cooked properly yet retained a certain crunchiness.But Gulla is troubled: theres hair in the curry  a lot of it!I was drawn more to the non-fiction part, and particularly enjoyed Rana Safvis piece (Qissa Qorma aur Qalia), in which she recounts food memories and practices of Lucknow.I relished the conversation between two uncles-in-law where they complain (in chaste Urdu) about digestive problems, which persist although they have been following their doctors advice and eating vegetarian khichri. It transpires that the cook has been adding large amounts of dried fruit and meat to the dish.The problem with a book like this is that it sends you straight to the kitchen. I certainly felt like cooking khichri after reading Farah Yameens well-written story about a child and her troubled phua.One does not serve khichri without mash and chutney to someone who is loved, Yameen writes. Or without papad or pickle, in my neck of the woods. Shows that food, really, has no religion.Desi Delicacies: Food Writing from Muslim South Asia; Edited by Claire Chambers, Pan Macmillan, 450The reviewer is a food columnist.",The kitchen’s calling: Rahul Verma reviews ‘Desi Delicacies: Food Writing from Muslim South Asia’,MUSTARD OIL

As anyone!Even if your menstrual cycle comes up like clockwork and you one of the lucky ones, chances are, it doesn't always work according to your plans. From cramps, mood swings to the irritability and rashes, having periods can be pretty uncomfortable, especially when you already have something important on your mind. Hence, the wish to 'postpone' your periods.The big question remains- are there ways to actually postpone your periods?Medically, yes there are pills which can help delay the flow of hormones and work to postpone your periods. With the advancement of science, there are some ways for women to put their periods on hold for a while, temporary, or the long run. But opting for synthetic hormonal pills or medicines may not be everyone's cup of tea. You will be surprised to know that there are some all-natural, non-medical ways to delay your periods for a while. Remember, you may not be able to outsmart or fool mother nature, but some of these remedies listed below can definitely be worth a try during times of crisis!Here are some natural herbs and medicines which can delay your periodsKnown to detoxify the body and promote weight loss, there are some old beliefs which suggest that there is yet another use of this humble drink- delaying menstruation.In fact, a lot of researchers have found out that the highly acidic content present in the ACV solution can help delay periods-upto an extent, but there's no credible proof to support it yet.Considering it as a good beneficial drink for your body, consider having a tablespoon of apple cider vinegar (in warm water) regularly for 10-12 days before your expected date.If not delay periods, drinking ACV can definitely help with the bloating and the harsh cramps which make your period woes so uncomfortable.Gram lentils, which can be found in every kitchen can also come of use when it comes to delaying your menstruation.According to some hacks, there is evidence to suggest that using fried, powdered lentils can delay period cycle.But there are some side-effects to the same. Excess consumption of lentils can lead to digestive troubles and flatulence.Using gelatin might come to be of use as a cure in emergency cases.An ancient Chinese remedy, some believe that gelatine, dissolved in warm water can push back periods by some hours, at the very least. It may not be a science-backed measure, but there are women who swear by this hack.For the ones who want relief for a long while, the gelatin treatment can be repeated again a couple of times.To use this, all you need is a couple of spoonfuls of gelatin powder or crystals mixed in a cup of warm water.Lime juice, much like apple cider vinegar is also considered to be a period postponement hack.While lime juice is hailed for its vitamin-c rich properties, the same citrus extract may also come of use in delaying your periods! Plus, it can also relieve any period complications or ease PMS pain which women experience. Some also believe that having citrusy fruits and juices also lightens up the blood flow. Make sure you have fruits, veggies and juices rich in vitamin C days leading up to your cycle.Again, do remember that having too much citrusy or acidic content can lead to gum and teeth deterioration or irritate your stomach.According to Ayurveda, using fuller's earth is not just good for better skin health, but may delay your periods too.Some ancient hacks suggest women wanting to delay periods to add about 25-30 grams of fuller's earth with a cup of warm water and have it regularly for a week before the expected date of menstruation. Some even suggest drinking the concoction for 3-4 times a day to see benefits.Do remember this is not a science-backed cure so proceed with precaution.Mustard seeds, popularly used in Indian cooking is also something a lot of women swear by in times of emergency. Soaking a spoonful of mustard seeds in water/ milk overnight and having them a week before the expected date can prove to be helpful. Antioxidant-rich chia seeds may be helpful in a similar manner.Apart from foods, there are also some other natural methods to postpone, or temporarily delay periods. Exercise and massage are some options.Since a lot of athletes often go by missing their periods due to extreme workouts they follow, it is said that rigorous exercise may postpone periods in cases. But, there is also scientific proof that suggests that exercise can regularize, instead of delaying periods.Getting a uterine massage may also be an option to consider. Not only is it very soothing and relaxing but as experts believe, it can also be a hack to delay periods or postpone cycle. This technique works best when you seek professional help.There are foods and natural techniques, apart from medicinal help you can try to postpone periods.While these methods are safe to try, they may not be the most effective or work for everyone.Again, there can be downsides of postponing your periods in the long run or consuming the foods in excess.Since they are not foolproof remedies, there can also be chances of irregular bleeding or spotting which you can expect.If you are considering halting your periods or searching for a way to deal with regular period woes, getting a gynaecologists opinion before trying out something on your own is advised. They can also devise ways and offer solutions which will help you in the longer run.",Natural ways to delay your periods,MUSTARD OIL

Hyperthyroidism is nothing but the over activity of the thyroid gland, that produces extra thyroid hormone and leads to increased metabolism. The most common type of hyperthyroidism is the autoimmune disorder Graves disease.Here, the body makes an antibody called thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin (TSI) that causes the thyroid gland to produce too much of the thyroid hormone. Excessive consumption of iodine or iodine supplements is also a common cause of hyperthyroidism.FOODS TO REDUCE THYROID ACTIVITYGluten and casein are difficult to digest and can cause irritation and inflammation in the gut lining. Avoid gluten (wheat and wheat products) and casein (milk and milk products) becomes very important to heal the gut lining and manage the condition.Consume food belonging to the Brassica family, like cauliflower, brussels sprouts, peanuts, cabbage, broccoli, kale, mustard greens, turnips, rutabagas and spinach which contain goitrogens that help the body block the ability of thyroid to use iodine and hence slows down the activity of the thyroid.Omega -3- Fatty Acids are the building blocks for hormones that control immune function and cell growth, and also help improve the ability to respond to thyroid hormones. Include fatty fish, flaxseed powder, flax seed oil, cod liver oil capsules, walnuts, chia seeds and other seeds to get a dose of omega-3- fatty acid.Protein sources also contain Lglutamine which helps in rebuilding the gut and de-inflaming the body. Opt for fish, lean chicken and free range eggs. Sattu and sprouts/whole beans combined with a cereal, also make a great protein source as the amino acid profile gets completed.The hyperactive thyroid gland can deplete the zinc in our body.

The government insists the new policy will benefit the growers and refuses to withdraw the legislation. After months of protests, more than 10 rounds of talks and a Supreme Court order to temporarily suspend the laws, the government says it would consider some amendments and could delay implementation by as much as 18 months. But the agitators are in no mood for compromise.Were not going anywhere. We are ready to sit here for years if needed. The government has to listen, said Balwinder Singh, 50, who normally grows rice and wheat on 3 acres of land in Punjab. He has been protesting since Nov. 26 on the Singhu border, the epicentre of the demonstrations outside Delhi. We can survive the coronavirus but not these laws.Behind the protesters fears and the government rhetoric is a reality that the country somehow needs to reshape its agricultural system or face the environmental consequences of overproduction and a fiscal calamity from ballooning farm subsidies. Get the reform right and it could raise millions of agriculture-dependent families out of poverty and propel India to the forefront of global food exports. Get it wrong and it could force tens of millions of people off their land and degrade up to 90% of the nations water supply.Its a problem so titanic that consecutive governments have shied away from making meaningful changes. Not Modi. Emboldened by seemingly unsinkable popular support, even during a devastating pandemic, his administration has weighed in. Its a classic playbook for the prime minister, whose six years in power have been marked by policy reforms that often set off national protests and occasionally thrown the country into turmoil, such as canceling 86% of circulating currency and introducing a religion-based citizenship law. But the governments willingness to compromise on the farm issue shows that this is potentially an even more delicate path one that risks alienating more than half of the nations 1.3 billion people, who rely on agriculture for a living.The two sides are poles apart. The government says the laws will overhaul the way farm goods are produced and sold in the country, opening up a decades-old system of state-run wholesale markets to more private purchases and helping producers earn more. The farmers fear the laws would give companies and large wholesalers the power to dictate prices to small land-holders, who make up the majority of producers.Its about unlocking productivity in areas like farming of cereals by applying high-quality farm inputs such as seeds, and using less water to grow the same amount of grain, said Rahul Bajoria, Mumbai-based chief India economist at Barclays Plc. The best way for the farm sector to grow is to focus more on exports, for which the country needs to improve productivity and quality control.But the nations millions of small farmers live a precarious existence and have come to trust a government support system that allows them to survive year to year with enough to get to the next harvest.Private companies won't pay us on time, said Singh, the protester. If we don't get paid on time, how will we prepare for our next crop? We will die of hunger.""The root of the conflict lies in a system that evolved over more than half a century after the Green Revolution of the 1960s slowly transformed the nation from a land of frequent famines to an agricultural powerhouse. India is now the worlds biggest exporter of rice and the second-largest producer of wheat and sugar. At the same time, a complex and inefficient system of state support, controlled markets and government welfare grew up that Modi is trying to unpick.Under the present system, the government sets minimum prices for about two dozen crops and buys large volumes of rice and wheat for its welfare programs. While traders arent legally obliged to pay the government-set rates, the sheer volume of state purchases creates de facto price support for key grains from small farmers, who sell their produce through licensed traders in designated markets. These markets were set up to open up the industry and prevent exploitation of smallholders, but over time many became effective monopolies, with traders pulling together to stifle competition. As a result, prices of rice and wheat have remained stable over years, while other crops such as soybeans, corn and rapeseed have seen sharp price swings.Farmers like the arrangement because the government provides them with a guaranteed buyer, allowing them to easily secure informal short-term loans to buy farm inputs like seeds in a country where rural banking services are often inadequate.The new rules intend to liberalize trading by allowing farmers to sell crops outside the designated markets. Modis administration has promised that the welfare support mechanism will remain, but protesters arent convinced.Many believe the reforms are designed ultimately to cut the governments food subsidy bill expected to be $33.4 billion in 2021-22 by allowing market forces to drive down prices. The current support rates reflect the cost of production plus a 50% profit, which, along with assured purchases, has encouraged farmers to overproduce some crops. With India growing more wheat, rice, sugar cane and cotton than it needs, a free-for-all could cause prices to slump.Worse still, 86% of Indias farmers cultivate plots of about 2 hectares (5 acres) or less, while the other 14% own more than half the cultivated land. In an unfettered market, large landowners with lower costs per acre and better access to funds could end up dominating markets, forcing smallholders to sell their land. Thats a shift that took decades in many developed nations as rural residents migrated to cities to work in factories. But an accelerated transition on the scale of Indias population risks a major humanitarian crisis.Jokhu Ray, who grew corn and rice in the eastern state of Bihar, has had a taste of what a free market could mean. Bihar abolished its government-managed market in 2006 and Ray says the result was disastrous for him. In the 2019-20 crop year, he could only get 10 rupees (14 cents) a kilogram for his corn, less than the support price of 17.6 rupees or the 15 rupees he got the year before. Like many others, Ray left his village to seek work elsewhere and now works on a construction site in Rajasthan.Stories like Rays have fueled farmers fears. Protesters around the country held 3-hour chakka jams at the weekend, holding up traffic. The government blocked the internet at major protest sites and deployed some 50,000 police and paramilitary, along with riot control vehicles in and around Delhi, according to local media. After violence broke out at a Republic Day rally in the capital in January, the United Nations urged farmers to keep protests peaceful.The government has shut down the Internet here out of fear, said Singh, by phone. We are not scared. We are informing people through phone calls.We are urging those involved in agitation to end protests, Modi told lawmakers in parliament on Feb. 8. We should give these agriculture reforms a chance.Farmers instead are demanding new legislation that makes it illegal to pay less than the minimum support rate, a policy analysts say would distort the market even more. Private buyers could be scared off, forcing the government to have to step in and buy even more. That would worsen a fiscal deficit that is already expected to widen to 9.5% of GDP due to the coronavirus.State-run Food Corp. of India, the nations biggest food-grain buyer, is already stretched after buying 39 million tons of wheat and 52 million tons of rice from last years crop of about 108 million tons and 118 million tons respectively. Recent bumper harvests have filled many state granaries to bursting.Raising minimum prices each year could also hit exports, said B.V. Krishna Rao, president of the nations Rice Exporters Association. The moment we make minimum prices a legal obligation, we are bound to lose our share in the global market. He suggested that support prices should be set close to global levels and farmers compensated if needed for any losses.And there are other, even more serious long-term consequences if India doesnt find an equitable way to reform its agriculture, especially in states like Punjab and Haryana, where the protests began.Indias Green Revolution in the 1960s brought a surge in grain output in Punjab thanks to high-yielding seeds, mechanization and increased application of pesticides and fertilizers. Known as Indias bread-basket, the state supplied about one third of the 62 million tons of water-intensive paddy that the government purchased from monsoon-sown crops so far this year, according to the food ministry.States like Punjab grow more rice than they consume despite unfavorable terrain, which has resulted in a drastic depletion of their water tables, Rini Sen, an economist with ANZ Banking Group, said in a report.India has only about 4% of the worlds fresh water and farmers tap almost 90% of the groundwater available. Growers say they cant afford to switch from water-intensive crops such as rice and sugar cane unless the government ensures the same kind of price support for more sustainable crops like soybeans, mustard or pigeon peas (used to make dal).Finding a compromise that would reassure farmers they can still make a decent living while dismantling an archaic and inefficient agriculture market may be Modis hardest task to date. But as the two sides dig in for what could be a long and bitter stand-off, its one that India must solve.",Farmers protest: Why it may be a pivotal moment in India’s growth story,MUSTARD OIL

2021-02-21,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/modi-govt-to-reduce-dependence-on-edible-oil-imports/articleshow/81135902.cms,"Prime Minister Narendra ModiNEW DELHI: The Modi government is now planning to work on mission mode to reduce the dependence of the country on edible oil imports , under which it would be increasing production of edible oil from various sources along with spreading public awareness for economical consumption of oil.According to experts, the objective of this new mission of the Modi government is not only to bring self-reliance ('Aatmanirbharta') in edible oils but also to transfer money to farmers on the expenses incurred on the oil imports.Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday during the meeting of the sixth governing council of the Niti Aayog also mentioned that despite being an agricultural country, India imports edible oil worth nearly Rs 65,000-70,000 crore annually. The Prime Minister said this money spent on imports could be transferred to the bank accounts of farmers in the country.We are talking about the 'National Mission on Oilseeds', on which there is a plan to spend nearly Rs 19,000 crore in the next five years. A senior official of the Union Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare said the preparations for the mission are foolproof and would be implemented from April 1 in the upcoming financial year.India imports nearly 150 lakh tonnes of edible oil every year while domestic production is nearly 70 to 80 lakh tonnes. With the growing population of the country, consumption of edible oil would also increase moving ahead. In such a situation, bridging the huge gap between the edible oil imports and the domestic production by achieving 'self-reliance' in edible oil is a major goal. But Trilochan Mohapatra , Director General of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), says that when work is undertaken on mission mode, there is a greater chance of achieving success in it.He said to increase the production of oilseeds in the country, along with acreage, more emphasis would be given on increasing productivity.Mohapatra told that in the eastern region of the country, there are nearly 110 lakh hectares of land, which remains vacant after taking out the paddy crop, it can increase its area by growing mustard. In addition, farmers are encouraged to cultivate pulses and oilseeds instead of crops like paddy, wheat and sugarcane in Punjab, Haryana including northern India where there is scarcity of water.Mohapatra said like paddy and wheat, if farmers get the Minimum Support Price (MSP) for oilseeds and high yield seeds are available then their interest in cultivating these crops would increase.He told that according to the study conducted by ICAR, there are 20 agro ecological regions in the country.Mohapatra said that varieties of seeds are prepared for cultivation of suitable crops in climate of a particular region, which increases the yield. He said that India imports palm oil the most, but the emphasis is now on increasing palm cultivation in the country, which would help in bringing 'Aatmanirbharta'.A total of nine oilseed crops are cultivated in India every year. Their annual production has been exceeding 300 lakh tonnes for the last four years and is increasing year by year. These include such oilseeds and oils which are used only in industries, but most of them are used as edible oils.Director ICAR-Directorate of Rapeseed-Mustard Research, Bharatpur (Rajasthan), P.K. Rai, said there is great potential to increase the production of oilseeds in the country and mustard can be seen as an example of this. He said that the emphasis on mustard cultivation in mission mode has increased the acreage this year and production could be between 110 to 120 lakh tonnes.Agriculture Ministry official said that in the next five years, the production of oilseeds in the country could double.Apart from seasonal crops, oil is obtained from the seeds of some evergreen trees in the country. Then, there are also secondary sources of oil. A senior Agriculture Ministry official said the goal of development has been set at every level. Four sub-missions have been made under the 'National Oilseeds Mission' which are as follows:Firstly to increase the production of oil from primary source. Under this it is planned to increase production of soyabean, mustard-rapeseed, groundnut, sunflower, sesame, safflower and ramtil.Secondly to increase the production of oil from secondary source and under it crop which is not produced mainly for oil, but oil comes from it as a by-product. For example, cotton oil, linseed oil etc.Thirdly setting up of processing units in oilseed production areas wherein the areas where oilseeds are produced, provision has been made to set up processing units so that farmers can get a fair price of their crops.Fourthly to create awareness campaign to make people aware of the benefits of economical consumption of oil.Experts point out that oil consumption is steadily increasing with the country's growing population, but a research by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), advises a person to consume 30 grams of oil daily. Adhering to this ICMR study, the annual oil consumption per capita should be nearly 11 kg of oil. Whereas according to the 2017 report, the per capita oil consumption in the country is 19.3 kg.In Video: Centre to reduce dependence on edible oil imports",Modi govt to reduce dependence on edible oil imports,MUSTARD OIL

2021-03-01,https://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/delhi/2021/mar/01/keep-the-flow-2270281.html,"Deepika Rathod ByExpress News ServiceMarch 1, 2021, which is celebrated as Rare Disease Day aims to raise awareness about rare diseases and ways to improve our health or manage it well. Today we are going to discuss a similar rare disease that wasnt common earlier known as Polycythemia. It is a rare blood disorder that causes your body to overproduce red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets.This disease mostly occurs in men after 40. Red blood cells carry oxygen throughout the body, white blood cells fight infection and platelets are involved in clotting the blood to stop or slow down the bleeding which indirectly helps in the healing of wounds. When too many RBC, WBC platelets circulate in our bodies, blood starts thickening and may not flow properly through the blood vessels.This increases the risk of blood clots in major arteries and veins of our body, which can lead to a stroke or heart attack. If clots occur in the entire body, then they can affect other vital organs. Smaller blood vessels can be blocked by clots which may lead to headaches, vision changes, light-headedness, numbness, burning, redness and swelling.While no special diet exists to aid the treatment of polycythemia, it is recommended that you eat a well-balanced meal and limit your intake of sodium. Increased blood volume increases your risk of high blood pressure. Limiting your sodium intake can help you better manage your blood pressure and you can avoid processed foods such as bacon, meat, sausage, frozen meals, salty chips and soup to control the same. Instead, include more fresh, home food with pink salt. Here are few tips to be healthy:Eat antioxidant-rich foods, including fresh fruits and vegetables to add fibre to your body which ultimately will help in controlling blood pressure.Avoid refined foods, such as white processed sugar, bread and junk food to control inflammation as they may contain high-fat content and increase chances of blood thickening.Avoid red meat and choose lean meats like chicken, cold-water fish, pulses and beans, nuts and seeds for protein. Protein repairs the cells in our bodies.Use healthy cold-pressed coconut oil, sesame, mustard or groundnut oil or A2 ghee for cooking, which helps in controlling inflammation.Try to eliminate trans-fatty acids from your routine, found in commercially baked goods such as cookies, crackers, cakes, French fries, onion rings, doughnuts, processed foods and margarine. They can make your blood flow sluggish and can increase the chances of blood clots.Avoid caffeine, alcohol, and tobacco as they can keep the inflammation levels high and will not help the body to heal.Drink eight to 10 glasses of water a day to make sure the body gets detoxified and it doesnt allow the thickening of blood.These practices can be followed daily to keep a check on your blood.DEEPIKA RATHODChief Nutrition Officer, Luke Coutinho Holistic Healing Systems.

""To improve the quality of prices data for reporting daily prices by the price reporting centres, the Department of Consumer Affairs launched a Mobile App on 1st January, 2021,"" the department said in a statement.It said that the monitoring and predictive analysis of prices of essential commodities has taken a giant step forward.The mobile app for price monitoring for 22 essential commodities has started providing effective real time information about retail and wholesale prices from 127 locations across the country, the statement said.The daily report of retail and wholesale prices are obtained from 127 centres located across the country. The daily report of prices and indicative price trends are analysed for taking appropriate decisions such as release of stocks from the buffer and export-import policy etc. ""Price reporting through Mobile App ensures reporting from the market location as data are geo-tagged thereby displaying the location from where price data are reported,"" the statement said.The reporting of static data from office desktop is ruled out through the application of Mobile App. ""Therefore, the condition to operationalise Mobile App is that each Price Reporting Centre has to furnish market details such as names and addresses of the shops and markets from where prices are being collected daily,"" it said.As per the guidelines for retail price reporting, the prices of the same variety of a commodity are to be collected from three markets -- high income market, middle income market and low income market, and the average of the three prices is to be reported.The department said that the mobile App has inbuilt feature to calculate and report the average price. This helps in avoiding human errors in calculation. Market information from Agmarknet, Agriwatch, NAFED and trade associations also constitute inputs for price analysis.The department is also utilising the services of Agriwatch for providing market intelligence, predictive analysis of prices and to develop price forecasting model.The department said it had proposed to DEA (department of economic affairs) for technical assistance fund under CARES Progamme of Asian Development Bank (ADB) for improving price monitoring and analysis.The activity components under the technical assistance are upgradation of price monitoring portal, capacity building for price reporting centres and price monitoring cell, identification of long-term improvements for food commodity supply chain & market efficiency.It said that the DEA has approved the proposal.",Mobile app improves price data collection: Department of Consumer Affairs,MUSTARD OIL

2021-03-05,https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/kolkata/streetwise-kolkata-teliapara-road-7215314/,"A stones throw from the overwhelming bustle of Jadubabu Bazaar in south Kolkatas Bhawanipore neighbourhood, is a narrow, unassuming little lane. As there are no markers for the beginning and the end of the old marketplace, you are most likely to miss the entire Teliapara Road if you are walking down without looking up at street signs.Sign up to get quick access to Indian Express exclusive and premium stories.In his book A History of Calcuttas Streets, historian P Thankappan Nair writes that this short lane was where the telis (the oil-pressers) and the kaluas (the oil-mongers) of old Calcutta had set up their homes and shops until modern methods of mass-produced, mill-made oils became the preference for the citys residents. These oil-pressers would sell everything, from freshly pressed coconut oil to mustard oil, an essential ingredient in Bengali cooking, to other less common oils in between.It is not clear when the road and the neighbourhood came to be associated with the telis of Calcutta. An entry in the September edition of the Calcutta Gazette of 1937 indicates that the Calcutta Municipal Corporation had proposed a change in the spelling of the road from Teliapara to Tilipara but that never came to fruition. Even today, addresses on that road carry two variations of the roads spelling: Telipara or Teliapara.The teli community, writes K S Singh, in his book Indias Communities for the Anthropological Survey of India, derives its name from the Sanskrit word talika or taila, used for the oil extracted from sesame and mustard, thus alluding to their traditional occupation.The teli community found their jobs diminishing after the pressing and extracting of oil largely switched to mechanical production methods, forcing members of the community to turn to other avenues of income, like farming and animal husbandry.An oil shop on Teliapara road. (Express Photo by Shashi Ghosh) An oil shop on Teliapara road. (Express Photo by Shashi Ghosh)The 1837 edition of the Calcutta Review carries an interesting entry about the community. A chapter dedicated to the Territorial Aristocracy of Bengal indicates that the Brahmins had relegated the community as one belonging to lower castes.The Pandits thus referred to unanimously gave the verdict in his favour, a verdict founded on the dictum tula danda dhari taulik; ie, Telis are not common oil-men, but derive their appellation from the fact of their holding the scales for the weighment of goods, and that the word Teli is the corruption of the word Taulik, says the entry.An old building in Bhawanipore. (Express Photo by Shashi Ghosh) An old building in Bhawanipore. (Express Photo by Shashi Ghosh)It further mentions: As holding the scales and weighing the goods is a vocation common to all merchants and mahajans, the Telis came in the same category with other Navasaks or second class Sudras, and like them, were entitled to the privilege of making gifts. According to Singhs writings, because a small number in the community, spread across the country, are landless, many have applied to be recognised as Other Backward Castes.Today, not many oil-pressers remain in Teliapara. The road now houses a mix of residential properties and commercial establishments and it is impossible to discern where the next-door Jadubabu Bazaar ends and where Teliapara begins given that hawkers and pedestrians have taken over the pavements.Bound by the bazaar on one end and Turf Road on the other, the manic pulling down of the citys crumbling architectural heritage appears to have largely evaded the old buildings in and around this road. Some exceptions, however, remain.One would be hard-pressed to find hand-pressed oil in the city today. But Calcutta is a city where one comes in search of history and usually does end up finding what theyre looking for, only perhaps not in the expected form. In this case, remnants of the teli community can still be found in this lane, in the odd shops with yellow hand-painted signboards saying oil-dealer. Of course, these shop owners do not know that the road acknowledges Calcuttas teli communitys work.","Streetwise Kolkata: Teliapara, a narrow lane named after city’s oil-pressers that not many know of",MUSTARD OIL

Similarly, the modal price of packed mustard oil has gone up from Rs 113 per litre to Rs 140 in the past one year.

At all three borders Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur people only start venturing out when the sun goes down. Katyal said, Singhu border is better organised because we get funds from people living in Punjab and their families living abroad. One man donated 500 coolers three days ago. We had started making pucca sheds, but the government filed four FIRs against us. So we resorted to installing iron sheds covered with green nets on the sides as these keep the places airy and prevent mosquitoes. Another alternative are bamboo huts, and we have made a lot of them.All trolleys have also been covered with mosquito nets. Similar arrangements are being made at other borders too. Bamboo huts have been made in 70 per cent of the area at Ghazipur border. Water is the main necessity in summer, so an RO with cooler has been set up here. People are donating coolers and fans. Even I donated four fans, added Jawla. But due to mustard harvest and sugarcane sowing, the numbers have gone down a bit on the borders.Work will wrap up by May 15. People are mostly spending time inside their tractors and tents, but every day one rally is being held at Ghazipur in the evening to keep the spirits of people up. Around 800-1,000 people take part in it, adds Jawla. However, the Kisan Mall is open just two days a week.

While rural roads are being metalled, the national highways are being four-laned.The BJP has done a lot of development work, it has made roads, toilets and houses, said Sanjib Bora, an owner of a shack restaurant next to the national highway in Chabua, Tinsukia. People here will support the BJP for this. Boras sentiment was endorsed by Dhanesh Pegu, also a roadside dhaba owner in Dhemaji district next to the recently-opened Bogibeel bridge, the longest one on the Brahmaputra river. Modi ne bahut kaam kiya hain (Narendra Modi has done a lot of work), he said.Take the Bogibeel bridge for instance, The foundation stone was laid by (H D) Deve Gowda, then (Atal Bihari) Vajpayee did some work but after that there was a Congress government both at the Centre and in the state but nothing happened. When Modi came he finished the bridge, Pegu said. Its no wonder then that from Modi, Union home minister Amit Shah, Chief Minister Sarabanda Sonowal and state finance minister Himanta Biswa Sarma to the ordinary BJP karyakarta (worker), development is one of the main talking points.ALSO READ: Fear, loathing and emergence of new minority politics in poll-bound AssamWhat we have done in the past five years the Congress could not do in 15, said Tutun Kar at the partys dimly-lit and sparse Nagaon district office. Assams Swachh Bharat Mission says more than 35.64 lakh toilets have been built since October 2014, with a 62% increase in households with the facility. As for housing, state culture minister Naba Kumar Doley said in May 2020 that 2.7 lakh houses have been built under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana.The latest data on the increase in road network is not available but according to the Assam Economic Survey 2017-18, surfaced road increased from 21,200 kms in 2011-12 to 27,003 kms in 206-17. National highways in the state increased from 2,848 kms to 3,900 kms in the same period.But the positive sentiment around the Assam governments development record is somewhat marred by the price rise. Everything is so expensive now, dal prices have gone up and mustard oil now costs almost Rs 150 (a litre). I voted for Modi the last time, I am not sure this time, said housewife Sarita Pegu in Dhemaji.Noor-ul-Islam in Nagaon concurs with Sarita on inflation. There is no doubt the BJP government has brought development but what about the price rise? If they have given us Rs 2 in our bank accounts, they have taken away Rs 98, he said.Price rise weapon in the hands of Assam CongressThe price rise has come in handy for the Congress to beat the BJP with. What has the BJP done on jobs and price rise? Their promises are embarrassingly unfulfilled, said party leader and parliamentarian Gaurav Gogoi. Gogoi isnt wrong when it comes to jobs. In some other parameters also Assam lags behind many other states, although many of them could be a legacy the BJP government inherited.According to Assam Agenda 2030, a task-at-hand document brought out by the Sonowal government in early 2018, the unemployment rate stood at 61 per 1,000 population (age 15 and above) against the national figure of 50 per 1,000 population. Poverty and hunger also plague the state. The poverty head count ratio for Assam was estimated at 27.34 percent in 2015-16. This is much higher than the all-India average of 20.74 percent, the Agenda 2030 said.Similarly, hunger remains a major problem in the state. Amongst children, the most vulnerable group in this respect, almost 30% below the age of 5 are undernourished, it said. But the BJP remains confident. We are on the way to getting more than 100 seats (out of the total 126) because of our development work, said Simanta Bora, a party leader in the district of Nagaon.","Thumbs up for delivering development in Assam, but a big no for price rise",MUSTARD OIL

The state has recorded a deficit of 62 per cent in precipitation during March, preceded by a deficit of 80 per cent in February and 58 per cent in January. Water sources in Himachal have been drying up or running low, while shortage of rain has affected rabi crops in a state where around 80 per cent of the cultivated area is rainfed.The average yield of mustard crop in my land is one quintal, but it is not likely to exceed 8 to 10 kilogram this time. Similarly, the yield of barley will not be more than 10 to 15 per cent of the average. In case of wheat, the crop has not even developed sufficiently this time due to lack of rains, said Om Prakash Thakur, a resident of Dhami in Shimla district.According to IMDs meteorological centre at Shimla, Himachal received 41.7 millimetres of rain/snow in March against a long period average (LPA) of 110.9 mm. It was the second-largest rain deficit in the state during March in the last 10 years. The highest deficit of 67 per cent occurred in 2018, when state capital Shimla had suffered a severe water crisis in summer.This March, all 12 districts of Himachal witnessed deficiency or large deficiency in rain as per IMDs classification. Kangra, Hamirpur and Sirmaur were the most-affected, recording a deficit of 84, 79 and 77 per cent respectively, while Kullu (40 per cent), Mandi (40 per cent) and Shimla (41 per cent) recorded the least deficit.According to Pankaj Gupta, associate director of Regional Horticultural Research and Training Station at Mashobra, shortage of rain and snow this year has adversely affected temperate fruits such as apples, cherries and pears in their fruit set stage. The chilling requirements of these fruits could not be completed this winter due to lack of adequate snow and farmers have been demanding an official declaration of drought.

2021-04-03,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/rising-prices-hit-households-reeling-from-shrunk-budgets/articleshow/81880966.cms,"Coronavirus: Live updates(Contributions by Mayur Shetty, Mamtha Asokan, Avik Das, Dipak Dash, Udit Prasanna Mukherjee and Surojit Gupta)NEW DELHI: Households across the country are facing the onslaught of rising prices and are witnessing a sharp dent in their monthly spend capabilities as prices of vegetables, groceries and transport mount steadily.Price pressures have added to the burden of households dealing with job cuts, salary reductions and loss of income as the effect of the pandemic-induced lockdown still plays out across some sectors, despite a strong economic recovery.Recent data point to a hardening of both retail and wholesale price inflation rates. Retail inflation has soared to a three-month high of 5% in February, while WPI (wholesale) inflation surged to a 27-month high of 4.2% in the same month, largely led by strengthening fuel, food and manufactured product prices.This is really a big problem for all of us, as high prices are upsetting our monthly budget, said Paramita Biswas, a professional singer and YouTuber in Kolkata. She said due to the pandemic, sanitisers and masks have added to expenses on health.The retail inflation data for February showed the extent of the strengthening prices. Meat and fish prices rose an annual 11.3% in February, while egg prices shot up 11.1%. Oils and fats rose 20.8%, while pulses and products rose 12.5%. In fact, prices of mutton, which hovered at Rs 500 per kg pre-pandemic, nearly doubled during the lockdown and have remained Rs 750-800 per kg a year later.Price of tur dal, which was around Rs 95 per kg in Delhi in April last year, has now soared to Rs 108 per kg. It is a similar story for other pulses such as urad and moong in cities such as Mumbai and Kolkata. Edible oil prices have also hardened. Mustard oil, which was selling at Rs 114 per kg in Mumbai last year, is now available for Rs 155 per kg, while sunflower, which was at Rs 105 per kg in Kolkata, is now at Rs 179 per kg.Rising fuel costs have also added to the woes of households, although of late there has been some easing. The NDA government had been successful in managing inflationary pressures since assuming power in 2014 against the backdrop of stubbornly high prices, but the pandemic-triggered price increases have upset the cart.Chinmoy Barik, who works as an engineer in an IT company, has been staying in Bengaluru for the last seven years with his wife, daughter and mother. He says the spike in fuel prices has hit his monthly budget majorly this year compared to last year. Though most of the year he has worked from home. It has hit my monthly budget as savings have gone down. A lot of extra expense has been incurred due to ordering food online during the lockdown, he said.The surge in prices of commodities and other costs are prompting people to reduce expenses on activities such as eating out.Rajiv Bansal, a bank employee in Mumbai, has a family of three. He continues to work from home for three days a week. Eating out has dropped substantially. He says his grocery, fruits and vegetables purchase costs have shot up not because of high prices but due to the buying of more quantity and exotic stuff. In education, there is a saving on childrens school uniform, transport and a marginal reduction in fees as extracurricular activities and field trips are not happening due to the pandemic. He has managed to re-negotiate the rent of his one-bedroom flat as several tenants in the complex had vacated and landlords were offering lower rates.While prices of vegetables are expected to stabilise as supplies improve, overall inflationary pressure is expected to linger for now. The latest Reserve Bank of India (RBI) inflation expectation survey showed that more households expect general prices as well as inflation to increase in the next one year. This is prominent in the case of food and non-food commodities. Households also expect more pressure on price of services over the one-year horizon when compared to a one-quarter (three-month) period.Pandemic-induced lifestyle changes are also adding to costs for some households. Consumption of vegetables and fruits suddenly shot up since the outbreak of the pandemic as we were forced to stay indoors. Now, we have decided to cut short on those expenses. Post-lockdown, we are now taking short breaks to entertain us, said Sumathi Jaykumar, a self-employed Chennai resident.",Rising prices hit households reeling from shrunk budgets,MUSTARD OIL
2021-04-04,https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/chandigarh/honey-producers-feel-hybrid-seeds-sting-output-suffers-7258109/,"On manufacturing of artificial honey in India by some groups, Narpinder said the government must make NMR (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) tests for honey compulsory so that only pure honey could be available in the market rather than having sugar-laced syrups by some big companies.WHILE FARMERS of Punjab have been fighting for respectable prices for their crops at Delhis borders for the past over four months, bee keepers of the state are fighting another battle for several years now. The yield of honey per colony has gone down manifold around 2-3 times. The reason, according to them, is that flowers of hybrid seed crops like sarson (mustard), sunflower, and berseem (fodder) etc., do not carry much nectar, because of which they are facing heavy losses.Beekeepers have been writing to the Punjab government as well as Punjab Agriculture University (PAU), Ludhiana, to address this issue by developing varieties which carry good amounts of nectar too. They also blamed that decreasing area under flowering crops.Dharminder Singh (49), a beekeeper from Dharamgarh village in Mohali district, said: I have been into beekeeping for the past 25 years and own 600 colonies (boxes) of bees which I keep across the state  in the Shivalik ranges, and outside the Himachal, Rajasthan as per availability of the flowers with the changing seasons. But the yield of honey has come down 2-3 times in all these years.We met the scientists at PAU a number of times and apprised them about how hybrid seeds of flowering crops are hitting the yield of honey because the amount of nectar in the flowers of these hybrid crops is hardly sufficient, he further said, adding that earlier, they would collect 4-5 times the honey from a box in a single season than what they now collect from one time crop.Another beekeeper, Simarjeet Billa, said that because of low yield per colony, their income has gotten hit manifold.Hybrid seed varietiesNarpinder Singh, president of the PAU Progressive Beekeeper Association Punjab and having 600 colonies, said that in India, 80 per cent honey production takes place from the mustard flower. But in the past 15 years, the average production per colony (per box of bees) has come down from 50 kg to 15 kg during the mustard crop season, which starts from November and continues till March.He said that as per records of the National Bee Keeping Board, Indias honey production was 1.20 lakh tonnes in 2019-20, which is increasing with every passing year. Punjab produces around 15,000 to 20,000 tonnes of honey but in reality, bee keepers like us are getting low yield per colony. Due to hybrid seed varieties, the duration of mustard crop has also decreased from 60 to 65 days to 50 to 55 days only, added Narpinder.Transportation expensesHe said that beekeepers are required to take the colonies from one place to another during the different flowering season. Sometimes we are going to Rajasthan during mustard crop season and some time we are taking bees to Himachal during apple flowering season We are bearing so much in transportation charges, then also keeping caretakers at the place where our boxes are kept. Government must come forward to help us in transportation charges when the yield is also going down, he said, adding that more area must be brought under flowering oil seed crops like sarson in Punjab.Artificial honeyOn manufacturing of artificial honey in India by some groups, Narpinder said the government must make NMR (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) tests for honey compulsory so that only pure honey could be available in the market rather than having sugar-laced syrups by some big companies. Purity of honey will also provide huge opportunities to the bee keepers to expand their beekeeping, he added.Reasons for yield productionPAU scientist Dr Jaspal Singh, principal entomologist told The Indian Express, said there are several reasons for low yield and one of the major reasons is the high competition in this field. He said a honey bee can travel upto 3 km to collect nectar. Earlier, there used to be a very low number of colonies in a particular area when now the number of colonies has increased manifold. Secondly, changing weather conditions also played a big role because high temperatures during February-March led to decrease in yield. Also if a crop is not sown timely, the amount of nectar also gets decreased, he added.PAU records also revealed that oilseeds crops used to be sown on around 5 lakh hectares in Punjab in 1970s and the area has reduced to just 50,000 hectares now, while the number of colonies has increased by 3-4 times now in the state.Narpinder Singh, a national award winner in beekeeping, said a colony carries around 20,000 to 25,000 bees and a bee has a life cycle of around 40 days. In India, Italian bees are rare.","Honey producers feel hybrid seeds’ sting, output suffers",MUSTARD OIL

Here are the diverse ways communities are celebrating the new year:Musical UgadiPantula Rama | Photo Credit: Special arrangementPantula Rama, Carnatic musicianDecorating the threshold with mango leaves is the first thing we do on Ugadi. I follow my mothers recipe to make Ugadi Pacchadi which has nice flavours dominating the bitterness of neem. We will be missing the family get-together and students and friends visiting home this year.Any festival in my family has limited rituals. Being a family of musicians, our major ritual is music-related to that particular festival. This year, I have been invited to do a special recording of a thematic presentation  Musicality of Telugu in Carnatic Sangeetham by the International Music Premier League, an online event for Ugadi.I remember the Ugadi celebration abroad when we were on a concert tour and took a break to celebrate the festival with my brothers family at Maryland in the US.I wish the live concerts resume soon.Lets spread the artKoeli mukherjee ghose | Photo Credit: Special arrangementKoeli Mukherjee Ghose, artistSpring cleaning, decorating the home with flowers and alpana on the floor with watered-down rice paste is something that I look forward to every year. This year, we would miss visiting the Hyderabad Kali Bari to offer our nabo borsho puja and enjoy the bhog prasad. We offer fruits and food at a nearby ashram, which houses homeless people.During childhood, my brother and I would wear new clothes and visit my dad's office in Dalhousie Street in Kolkata. The Stephen House building used to overwhelm us  the smell of the lift, the colonial courtyard with a fountain; everything is a memory now. There would be a little prayer gathering and sweet boxes with yummy goodies would be gifted to all of us. Lunch was at home with a traditional menu and my mother, a wonderful cook, would transform any vegetable, dal, and other eatables into gourmet dishes.The evening would be spent in musical concerts held in Rabindra Sadan, Birla Sabhaghar or Kala Mandir auditoriums. The pandemic has left a lasting impression on our minds. The art scene has shifted online, and I hope and pray that we have more visitors to the sites and art lovers reach out to the artists and buy their works.Culture and creativityRam mohan Holagundi | Photo Credit: Special arrangementRam Mohan Holagundi, theatre directorThe house looks colourful on Ugadi day with rangoli, mango leaves thoranam and marigold flowers. The first thing we do after puja is to eat behu bella, the sweet and sour chutney symbolic of different flavours in life.Three big mango trees in our house are a special part of festivities. We wait till Ugadi to pluck mangoes and distribute them among our friends, relatives and neighbours.The festive meal will have Kannada specialities  kosambri, bisibele baat, mavinkayya chutney and chitranna, muddipalya, saaru, holige and mosaru buttey (curd rice with seasoning).We usually have a family get-together but this time it will be a virtual one. Since we cant meet the elders in the family to take their blessings, we will connect with them over the phone.I hope art and culture will break the barriers and go beyond different traditions and communities.Arts continues to thriveVyshnavie Sainath | Photo Credit: Special arrangementVyshnavie Sainath, dancerMy grandmother instilled excitement in us for Puthandu and would encourage us to buy new clothes. Paati would also make special food and students in my dance centre add extra cheer by wishing Puthandu vazthukal.Our celebrations will be intimate this year starting with puja and my mother (dancer Rajeswari Sainath) is already on a long call with paati to get the recipes right. The pandemic has taught me many things and I want to fearlessly implement them. It has shown me that despite the fear and uncertainty, students/parents/practitioners have not given up on their art and have swiftly shifted to the online platform. It only reinforces the belief in me that arts can adapt to every situation. I pray that the year gets better and I can perform live.Combining traditionsAshwin Nair and Nikita Kak | Photo Credit: Special arrangementStand-up comedian Ashwin Nair and Nikita KakThis year we will be combining the traditions of Navreh and Vishu. Interestingly, Kashmiris and Malayalis place a thali type arrangement of food items in front of the image of KrishnaWe celebrate Navreh by filling a plate with rice, vegetables and fruits called Thaal bharun and cook favourite recipes like Teheri and dum aloo. I miss going to my home town but will connect with them virtually.As children, we were always excited to see the Vishu kani (a beautiful platter of vegetables, fruits, grains, flowers, gold, cash and clothes and jewellery in front of a photo or statue of Vishnu) and receive money from our grandparents. Growing up we realise the pleasure of seeing such prosperity and receive such gifts at the start of the year. Vishu is a time to celebrate the year, the summer solstice and usher in joy and prosperity.The pandemic has limited our interaction with family back in Kerala but we still look forward to celebrating a smaller version of Vishu at home with my wife and mother. Our sweetest memories of Vishu were being surrounded by cousins and extended family and waking up to the Vishu kani with our grandmother and receiving the kaineetam and eating a rich sadhya as children.It was a time of celebrating in every way  beautiful sights, food and the joy of receiving pocket moneySubdued festivitiesMayanand Thakur | Photo Credit: Special arrangementMayanand Thakur, theatre actorWe hoist Gudi (stick, flag, garland of flowers, mango leaves, neem tree leaves and upturned silver or copper vessel on the top) on top of a building or apartment balcony. Gudi padwa is a festival of rituals and traditional food especially a tangy chutney prepared with neem leaves and flowers, grated raw mango, jaggery, pepper and chilli powder with a seasoning of hing and cumin and mustard seeds. This chutney is tasty and also good for health as it improves digestion. Another ritual is to bathe with neem leaves- soaked water that keeps our body cool.We missed grand celebrations due to the pandemic last year and unfortunately, the celebrations will be subdued considering the situation now and keeping each others safety as a priority. My most loved quote during the pandemic is: We isolate now, so when we gather again, no one is missing.New beginningsNidarshana Saikia Das | Photo Credit: Special arrangementNidarshana Saikia Das, entrepreneurRongali Bihu is a celebration of spring and of youth, hence the Bihu dance takes centre stage. Young and old sing, dance and play instruments like the dhol and pepa mostly in the fields and underneath the trees. Thankfully, some Bihu functions still make room for mukoli Bihu (where everyone can dance together). And dancing underneath peepal trees have tiptoed into verandahs and drawing rooms during private home parties.This time of the year is ritualistically spent in Assam but these two pandemic-struck years have been exceptions and we miss the fun of Rongali Bihu in our homeland. We usually plan a get-together with our Assamese friends in Hyderabad but with rising cases, it will be a traditional meal with just the family.In Assam too, my aged parents will be home as the situation is aggravating.I belong to Nagaon, a small town and we used to make a ritualistic trip to the village to soak in traditions and make and savour traditional foods. The whole day wed have these small groups of children and young adults, dressed in traditional attires, flocking from a home to another, singing and performing Bihu dance, collecting money to have a feast at the end. Many a time the hosts would join in.It is quite a sight to soak in  be it Bihu songs celebrating spring, exquisite dance moves, unique musical instruments and of course the food. These become very important windows for our children to a culture theyre fast getting detached from.Foster friendshipsTejdeep Kaur Menon | Photo Credit: Special arrangementTejdeep Kaur Menon, IPS (Retd)We usually have a huge congregation of 10,000 people during Vaisakhi; Singers from different parts of Punjab come here to perform shabd kirtan but we will be missing it this year. The celebrations have become a personal affair. People may visit the Gurudwara on their own but congregations and huge celebrations are not allowed. During this time, I usually have a blue salwar kurta ready for the festival as blue is the colour we wear on the day to go to Gurudwara. I plan to make kadha parshad at home and share it with neighbours.My big wish is for normalcy to return lessons learnt from the pandemic. We should realise life is fleeting and spend good quality time with each other and foster friendships at home and outside.I long to see my granddaughter too play with her friends with the freedom with which we played outside.Every year I get kirpan on Vaisakhi day from the community. It is a rare honour for a woman to receive it but this year I am going to miss it.",New Year flavours from across India,MUSTARD OIL

The state government welcomed the phenomenon saying that the private players procured the oilseed at rates much above the minimum support price.After visiting eight mandis of Gurgaon, Rewari, Mahendragarh, Dadri and Bhiwani, state Agriculture and Farmers Welfare Minister JP Dalal told The Indian Express: The MSP of mustard is Rs 4,650 per quintal while it is being sold up to Rs 5,800 per quintal in Rewari. In other mandis too, its price is above 5,500 per quintal.The government has not purchased even a single quintal of mustard in Haryana mandis till date. We are happy with this situation when the private players buy produce from farmers above the prices of MSP. The welfare of farmers is the utmost priority of the government. If we need the agricultural produce, then we can procure it from the market, said Dalal.Mustard is mainly produced in southern Haryana apart from some areas of Hisar and Fatehabad.High global prices have made edible oil imports dearer, benefiting domestic mustard growers just when their crop is being harvested and brought to the mandis. Haryana Agriculture and Farmers Welfare department Director General Hardeep Singh said, Mustard is used in soaps, cosmetics, personal care products and cattle feed too. We aim to increase the area under the crop also but traditionally it is restricted to southern Haryana, and Hisar.Commenting on the higher market prices of mustard, agriculture and food expert Devinder Sharma said, It gives more reasons to make MSP a legal right for farmers. If markets are willing to pay a higher price, there is no reason why a floor price by way of an MSP should not be fixed. It does not mean the state has to buy the entire produce. It only raises the benchmark for trade.A law to ensure MSP of agricultural crops is one among the main demands of farmers, who are currently sitting at the borders of Delhi as part of their ongoing agitation against three agri laws.Dalal said the Haryana farmers are happy because of higher production of mustard this time. This time, the production will be higher by 1-2 quintal per acre against the normal production of 8 quintal per acre.The minister said kapas (narma cotton) is also fetching higher prices than the MSP in Haryana mandis currently. The Haryana government is procuring 10 crops on MSP including millet, groundnut, sunflower, wheat, paddy and mustard and the farmers are getting payments directly into their accounts, he added.","As mustard prices soar above MSP, private players procure every kilo brought to mandis",MUSTARD OIL

Although he transitioned to a career in food and beverages from science, his new book, The Flavor Equation , goes behind the recipes to investigate the science of taste, combining his knowledge of chemistry with the mysteries of flavour pairings. The popular food columnist, blogger and recipe developer spoke toabout the Indian influences on his writing and also on mainstream American cuisine. Edited excerpts from the interview.They go hand-in-hand. Ive always felt cooking in the kitchen is just like being in a lab but with a tastier outcome. Recipe writing is just like writing experiments -- things work and sometimes they dont. Thats when you try to understand what is happening and how to fix it. A large part of recipe development is also problem-solving and creating solutions. This is where science comes in. For example, for the longest time, the paneer I made in America was too soft with a ricotta-like consistency -- a problem I never encountered in India. It turned out the calcium levels in cows milk is lower than that of buffalos milk used in India. To fix this, I simply needed to increase the amount of calcium and curdle the milk. Calcium chloride, an ingredient commonly used in cheese-making, does both these things. It gives the extra calcium and also the acid to help the milk proteins change their shape and turn into a firm block of paneer.Growing up in India, Ive been fortunate to experience and taste food from different regions as well as see and appreciate Indian ingredients and techniques for their versatility. In India, you can travel through various states and a staple ingredient like rice will morph as it moves from biryanis to fermented batters that make dosas and idlis. It gives me a sense of how ingenuity comes into play as recipes reflect adaptations to changes in geography and culture.While I dont think were exactly there yet, I do think we are on our way to seeing Indian food and ingredients in more homes than earlier. I think this is one of the most exciting times to be cooking Indian food in America because people are genuinely excited to learn about new flavours and ingredients. The works of chefs and writers like the late Floyd Cardoz, Asha Gomez, Tejal Rao, Priya Krishna, and several others are certainly helping cement the prominence of Indian cuisine in America.Cooking and for that matter even appreciating flavour, is something we learn through trial and error over time. It is experiential. Ive learnt to cook by watching my family and friends as well as through cookbooks, magazines, television shows and also working as a pastry cook in a patisserie. Flavour is a wide umbrella that not only encompasses the taste and aroma of the ingredients in our food but it also involves the interplay of our senses -- the shapes and colours of the food we eat, the different textures of food, and even the sounds food makes as we cook and eat. I remember being taught in India to pay attention to the sound of cumin and mustard seeds popping when preparing a tadka. We are constantly using all sorts of sensory cues in our cooking. And then theres the interplay of our emotions and memories that influences our perception of flavour. We love some flavours more than others, be it something we experienced in childhood or something tied into our cultures. The Flavour Equation is a book that gets into all these different facets from a nerdy-yet-fun lens with the recipes acting as enticing experiments.Living in two very different parts of the world gave me the opportunity to not only taste new food but also compare and contrast. You start to notice how people and culture define food. Often, similar beloved combinations exist throughout the world. They just get painted with different spices and are cooked in different ways -- for example, mashed potatoes and meat is a popular dish in the West but in Mumbai, potato chops provide that same degree of comforting flavours and textures where ground meat is encased in a shell of smooth, mashed potatoes before being shaped and pan-fried.My blog started out as a way for me to talk about the Indian food I didnt see in restaurants or in magazines and an opportunity to show the versatility of Indian ingredients and techniques in Western cooking. I dont see myself as an expert on Indian food since I certainly dont know all there is to Indian cuisine but I do my best to share the food I enjoy cooking at home with people. Its been a long journey but one that Ive thoroughly enjoyed. While there are plenty of common misconceptions on Indian cooking, I try to do my best through my work to show people that they can easily incorporate a lot of those flavours in their own cooking at home. Over time, Ive been fortunate to write for outlets such asandIt has certainly helped me share my food with a larger audience.There is an incomparable joy that I nd difficult to express in words when I eat ripe Indian mangoes. During ripening, the starch transforms and gives way to a soft pulp thats sweet and sour, carrying an aroma that reminds me of warm summer holidays in Goa. While mangoes are delicious as a sweet treat, they also make an excellent addition to savoury applications. The fruity, sweet avour of mangoes with lime gives this beet salad a refreshing taste. Try to use a good ripe mango without a chalky aftertaste. Its no surprise that I recommend Indian mangoes, but champagne mangoes are a good option. Youll find paneer in the cheese section at Indian grocery stores as well as most regular food markets.Paneer is not a salty cheese, so the marinade must contain a bit more salt for the cheese to absorb.The salad dressing provides a second layer of flavour as well as salt.While paneer is one of the easiest cheeses you can make at home, I prefer the store-bought variety in this application, where shape and structural integrity are important. It takes the pressure of an extremely heavyweight to bring together the protein molecules in the paneer and force them to coalesce, producing a firm, compact paneer that can hold its shape when cut and cooked. Commercial producers have equipment that generates sufficient pressure; its a little tricky to do this at home but Ive developed a method that you can use; otherwise, store-bought is perfectly fine.Whisk the ker, salt, cumin, turmeric, chilli powder, and black pepper in a small bowl. Taste and season with more salt if needed. Pour the marinade into a large resealable bag.Cut the paneer into approximately 1 by 2 by  in [2.5 cm by 5 cm by 12 mm] cubes and place them in the bag with the marinade, seal, and gently shake to coat evenly. Let the paneer marinate for one hour at room temperature. If you need to marinate it longer, leave it in the refrigerator.Preheat the oven to 400F [204C].While the paneer marinates, prepare the beets. Peel, trim the ends, and cut into quarters. Place the beets in a baking dish or roasting tray, drizzle with the olive oil, and season with salt. Roast for 30 to 45 minutes, until they are tender on the inside and a knife slides through the centre with ease. Remove from the oven and let them rest for 10 minutes.While the beets roast, prepare the dressing. Place the mango, ker, oil, lime juice, mustard, pepper, and chilli powder into a blender and pulse on slow speed until combined and smooth. Taste and season with salt.Grill the paneer just before youre ready to assemble the salad. Heat a cast-iron grill pan or a medium non-stick sauce pan over medium-high heat and brush the surface with a little olive oil. With a pair of kitchen tongs, carefully lift the paneer out of the bag and cook it in batches in the hot pan until it turns golden brown and is slightly seared,two to three minutes per side.To serve, toss the arugula in a large mixing bowl with the olive oil. Add the pepper and season with salt. Add the warm grilled paneer pieces. Drizzle with a few tablespoons of the salad dressing. Sprinkle with the amchur just before serving.Serve the remaining salad dressing on the side.",Science and spices go hand-in-hand for LA chef Nik Sharma,MUSTARD OIL
2021-04-21,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/diet/health-benefits-of-sprouting-why-you-must-have-them-regularly/articleshow/82163826.cms,"It's known to us that for optimum health, we must have options from all core food groups- green leafy vegetables, fruits, pulses and legumes in plenty.Sprouts, too are something which we should be having regularly.Sprouts are young greens that are just days old and have just germinated seeds and sprouting thus is a process by which seeds and legumes are germinated.The germination process begins when any seed is soaked in water for a specific number of hours, with access to the right temperature, shade and environment.While we all remember sprouting moong (or mung) beans in our homes, germination can be done for a lot of different seeds and grains, including some lentils, soybeans, kidney beans, brown rice, quinoa and oats.Amongst the vegetables, a lot of people do prefer to eat leafy sprout versions, such as of mustard greens, fenugreek, radish and broccoli. A lot of nuts and seed varieties can be germinated too.Now, sprouting is said to add to the nutritional content and make it a lot healthier to eat. According to nutritionists, soaking seeds in water allows softening up of the outer shells and membranes that may contain some anti-nutrients and may not facilitate proper absorption. It also eliminates gas-producing starch and lessens the cooking time of legumes and pulses.Usually eaten raw or cooked, sprouts can help maximize nutrient absorption of core vitamins, minerals, antioxidant profiles which benefit good health.Not only are they a powerhouse of nutrition, but their health benefits would also convince you to add them to your diet. We tell you about a few such reasons:Sprouting legumes, seeds or vegetables help eliminate phytic acid present in the membranes which limit the presence of digestive enzymes within the seeds.Now, a lot of the important enzymes present within the seeds help facilitate digestive processes, keep our metabolism in check and also work to improve chemical reactions in the stomach when we digest food. The enzymes also break down the food more effectively upon digestion, which helps us absorb nutrients better.Not to forget, sprouting a legume or a cruciferous vegetable adds dietary fibre to the seeds which eliminate toxin build-up from the body and keep the stomach clean and healthy.While it's crucial to have good quality fruits, vegetables, nuts and seeds to lose weight effectively, sprouts are also a healthy option to have. Not only are they filled with benefitting nutrients, but they also are low on calories, which is a prime reason a lot of weight watchers tend to have them in the form of snacks.The fibre present in the sprouted grains can also induce satiety, make us feel full and limit the release of ghrelin, which is an important hunger hormone.

We take a minute to appreciate three such local favourites, beyond the mainstream bounty of mango and watermelonThe hottest days of summer are here, and it is time to pay attention to staying hydrated while replenishing nutrients.There are various healthy summer coolers which help us to stay refreshed and energised as the mercury rises. The traditional choices of the hot season: musk melon, watermelon, lemon and tender coconut water are also pocket friendly. Here are some more juices that have been part of southern Indias cuisine for many generations.It was nungu paal (ice apple-based) and nannari sherbat that we had during my childhood in Thanjavur, but now the options are wider and healthier, says Devi Bala Chandrasekar, whose foodblog, KitchenDB focusses primarily on traditional, healthy family recipes.Each region in our country has special cool drinks and I have tried Nellai pazharasam (mixed fruit punch) and the much easier neer moru (spiced buttermilk) during summer, she adds.Devi Bala shares recipes of herbal summer drinks like lemongrass lemonade, orange and oregano juice, tulsi sherbet and variyali sherbet (fennel seeds and raisin) on her blog.Nandita Shah, a homeopath suggests juicing vegetables. In North India, aam panna (made with raw mango and jaggery), sol kadhi (a coconut milk drink laced with herbs) and jal jeera (herbs and lemon juice) are popular. But we can also try blending nutrient-rich vegetables with a little lemon juice and mint in a sugar-free drink, she says.She says sugar can be substituted with dates paste or raisins. She also suggests drinking tender coconut chaas, made by combining half a cup of creamy tender coconut kernel, eight drops of lemon juice, two-and-a--half cups of water and one teaspoon chaas masala.When it comes to vegetable juices, everyone prefers carrots and beetroots, which are naturally sweet . But ry blending any kind of gourd along with raw mango (the kilimooku variety) and you will enjoy it, says Sreedevi Lakshmikutty of Coimbatore-based Biobasics.Electrical mixer/blenders have made fresh juices easy to make at home. But we must aim at making these without sugar or at least substituting it with palm sugar or jaggery, she says.Sreedevi suggests trying blending curry leaves with coconut milk seasoned with some salt and palm sugar and adding little water to make it a nutrient loaded drink for the season. I wonder why people have stopped drinking the ragi koozh (fermented porridge) or the simple lemon water with a pinch of salt, she adds.Pune-based Neha Mathur, who blogs at The Whiskaffairs says In Pune, chaas, shikanji and Jeera soda are a daily affair during summer months. I make beetroot chaas which looks great, tastes good and kids simply love it. Also cucumber blended with tender coconut flesh can also be added to the regular chaas as it can cool the body, says Neha.Down South, it has always been the neeraagaram or pazhaya sadam (cooked rice fermented in water overnight) that has been the saviour for many during the harsh weather, says Seethalalshmi N, of Organic Farmers Market, Chennai.She adds, Using heritage rice and making sure to soak few fenugreek seeds along with the rice can promote health and keep the body cool and has numerous health benefits. She adds that soaking sabja seeds and almond gum overnight in water, and adding lemon juice and water and a pinch of salt makes a wonderful drink.Ice Apple Milk DessertIngredients5 palm fruit/nungu, skinned/chopped200 ml milk, boiled/chilled4 tbsp organic brown sugar1 tbsp edible rosewaterA few rose petalsA few pistachiosMethod : Chop the skinned palm fruits into fine pieces and keep aside, add it to the chilled milk in a bowl.

During COVID-19, the body gets weakened and it continues for days even after recovering from the symptoms. Thus, it becomes essential to consume the right kind of diet for a speedy and complete recovery of the body. We spoke to celebrity nutritionist Sandhya Gugnani and she recommended some food and diet tips based on the latest research.Start with meeting 50% of the nutritional requirement of the patient and proceed to 70% by the 3rd day, gradually increasing to 100% by the end of the week.The above micronutrients increase the T-cells & B-cells(antibody) in your body and will help in COVID recovery.The main diet focus for COVID patients is to consume foods that would help rebuild muscle, immunity and energy levels. Whole grains like ragi, oats or amaranth are rich sources of complex carbohydrates. Chicken, fish, eggs, paneer, soya, nuts and seeds are some good sources of protein. Healthy fats like walnuts, almonds, olive oil, mustard oil are recommended during these days. To boost ones immunity, one should take turmeric milk once a day.Five serving of all coloured fruits and vegetables are a must to get adequate vitamins and minerals when you are COVID positive. You can have small amounts of dark chocolate with at least 70% cocoa which can lift your mood, get rid of anxiety and will also boost your immunity.Most COVID patients experience loss of smell and taste or difficulty in swallowing. It is important to eat soft foods at small intervals and to add amchoor in the food.If the patient is getting diarrhoea/ nausea give Veg Khichdi, ginger tea ( ginger, tulsi/ lemongrass, cinnamon, clove or cardamom)Consume energy-boosting foods like banana, apples, oranges or sweet lime juice to deal with post-COVID fatigue. Add sweet potato in the salad or as a part of your meal. Take warm water with organic honey and lime.Drink plenty of fluids, like warm water with tulsi leaves to manage COVID symptoms, like cough and itchy throat. Avoid sugary drinks, alcohol, coffee as it leads to dehydration. Inhale steam with the tongue out at least 2-3 times a day.Fruits and vegetables do not transmit the virus directly, but they should be thoroughly washed before cooking or consumption. They should be ideally washed in warm water or you can add soda-bicarb to the water.

2021-04-27,https://indianexpress.com/article/lifestyle/health/here-are-4-reasons-why-you-should-switch-to-canola-oil-7285833/,"There is the cult sarso ka tael and the refined oil which stands tall on the kitchen shelves of most Indian households. But, have you heard of canola oil? This oil is gradually gaining popularity in the Indian market, owing to its excellent properties, texture, and a plethora of health benefits that you might not find in your usual mustard or even olive oil.So to begin with the basics, what is canola oil?Canola obtains its name from two words  can stands for Canadian, and ola means oil. There is only one thing that differentiates canola from mustard oil: Erucic Acid  mustard oil has 47 per cent erucic acid. To understand the difference in simple terms, mustard oil minus 47 per cent erucic acid is canola oil,  explains Gurpreet Singh, managing director, JIVO Wellness.This vegetable oil is obtained from rapeseed which has a low percentage of erucic acid.Check out these four health benefits of canola oil:No trans fatsCanola oil has zero trans fats, which means, no cholesterol. Thus, it is the best option to reduce those extra kilos.High in good fatsCanola oil has low saturated oil content  only seven per cent, way less than olive oil, which has 15 per cent. Low saturated oil content helps in lowering cholesterol and further lowers the risk of heart diseases, says Singh.Since it is rich in mono-unsaturated fatty acids, the oil will help in the reduction of bad cholesterol and increase the good cholesterol in the body.Rich in Omega 3We all know how important omega 3 fatty acids are and canola oil offers just that. It is an excellent option for vegetarians to obtain these fatty acids to help you maintain a healthy heart, prevent the risk of cardiac diseases, strokes, and ensure healthy blood pressure, he adds.High smoking pointOil is an essential part of cooking in any Indian household, post which there is often a bit of it left over, and contributes to waste. Canola oil, however, has a high smoking point. This makes it healthy to be reused multiple times without compromising the oils taste or quality, Singh shares.For more lifestyle news, follow us: Twitter: lifestyle_ie | Facebook: IE Lifestyle | Instagram: ie_lifestyle",Here are four reasons you should switch to canola oil,MUSTARD OIL

In addition to the night curfew in force, the markets are closed during the curbs.Facing the challenge of maintaining the supply chain, most of the grocery stores in Jaipur and elsewhere have got themselves registered with the platforms which render standardised services in the relaxation period of five hours everyday. The kirana, milk, vegetable and fruit shops are allowed to remain open from 6 a.m. to 11 a.m.The Retail as a Service (RaaS) platform has enabled the grocery shop owners to standardise and digitise their operations and streamline the unorganised segments of their business. The aggregator model, introduced by Kirana King, takes care of supply chain and marketing, besides reducing the working capital requirements and increasing the product range.Kirana King CEO Anup Kumar said here on Wednesday the RaaS platform had helped improve grocers efficiency during the pandemic and ensured replenishment of essential commodities at the shops. It has also provided diverse options to the consumers to purchase essentials from their vicinity during the limited hours of relaxation, he said.The Food and Civil Supplies Department has imposed a penalty of 18,000 on the retails in Bikaner, Alwar and Dungarpur districts for black-marketing and overpricing of food materials. Irregularities were found during 53 inspections, in which the grocers were found selling the items such as chana dal, mustard oil and soaps at prices higher than the maximum retail price.Consumer Affairs Secretary Naveen Jain said instructions had been given to the Collectors to get the price lists of food items pasted outside the grocery shops and ensure a balance between the demand and supply during the restrictions. Mr. Jain said a helpline number had been released for the consumers and the information about wholesalers and the mills of wheat flour, oil and pulses was provided to retailers.However, the guidelines during the restrictions have hampered the agricultural input business, as these shops are allowed to remain open for five hours on only two days in a week. Agricultural Input Dealers Association president Purushottam Khandelwal said since the farmers were unable to get seeds, fertilizers and pesticides for the kharif crops, the agricultural production would be adversely affected this year.",COVID-19 curbs force grocery stores to use new platforms,MUSTARD OIL
2021-04-29,https://indianexpress.com/article/chandigarh/farmers-should-suspend-agitation-amid-second-covid-wave-says-haryana-minister-j-p-dalal-7295912/,"This agitation was started by Congress by creating fear that the mandis will be disbanded, the MSP system will go and the farmers will lose their land with big capitalists snatching the same, Dalal said. (Express File Photo by Amit Mehra)A vocal supporter of the Centres farm laws and the DBT scheme, Haryana Agriculture and Farmers Welfare Minister J P Dalal speaks on wheat procurement, farmers protest and more.What is the scenario of wheat procurement in Haryana?Normally, procurement season goes on for two months  April and May. But this year, we have procured almost the entire wheat brought to the mandis by farmers in just 20 days. The arrival of wheat in mandis has crossed the figure of 80 lakh MT. In the next one week, the entire procurement process is likely to be completed. Early procurement will lead to early sowing of next crops including cotton while sowing seems to be getting late in Punjab. Early sowing of cotton is beneficial for the health of the crop. This time there was no need for the government agencies to procure mustard in Haryana with the private players buying the same at the rate of Rs 6,500 per quintal which is much higher than of its MSP of Rs 4,650 per quintal. With higher prices, the mustard growers in Haryana got around Rs 1,500- Rs 2,000 crore additional income this season.How was the experience of DBT scheme in Haryana which was opposed by arhtiyas?This is a historical step for the economic freedom of farmers. The farmers will understand its results in coming years. We have already made payment of around 50 per cent to total procured wheat from the farmers. The farmers have always been paying interest to the arhtiyas (in lieu of advance taken from them). But this time, if the farmer gets payment after 72 hours, he will get the principal amount from the government along with the interest at the rate of 9 per cent on it.The farmers have apprehensions that the direct supply of crops to the silos is aimed to disband mandis.See, in Haryana we have maximum facilities of transportation and storage but despite that our lakhs of tonnes wheat kept in open ground under tirpals get spoiled. We had invited tenders from private players including farmers urging them to construct godowns. During this process, if somebody constructs silos of big capacity, what is wrong in it? In the country, we have three times more stocks (of foodgrains) than of the requirement. This is also a matter of happiness that the export of agricultural produce has increased by 18 per cent this year. We need logistics and capacity of storage for further exports.What are the preparations of the government for contract farming in light of new laws?The concept of contract farming is not mandatory for the farmers. Even today, contract system is prevalent in the cases of almost 50 per cent farmers where one takes land from another at contract for cultivation purposes. The annual contract ranges from Rs 30,000 to Rs 60,000 per acre. Their issues, if arise, are resolved by the local social panchayats. The Act on contract farming has been introduced to prevent exploitation of farmers by big companies. This concept is not compulsory in nature but optional. All clauses of this Act are pro-farmers.What do you think about crop diversification?First of all, we want mechanisation of agricultural farms, proper management of water, recharging of groundwater and crop diversification by promoting production of fruits. We also want to encourage those crops which require less water for irrigation purposes to break the paddy-wheat circle. There is a serious crisis of irrigation water in Haryana with depleting water levels, so certain schemes have been launched to ensure better utilisation of water too.How do you see the five-month-old farmer agitation?The issue of this agitation is between the central government and farmers. This agitation was started by Congress by creating fear that the mandis will be disbanded, the MSP system will go and the farmers will lose their land with big capitalists snatching the same. Nothing of this sort took place. Moreover, when the Supreme Court has stayed the laws, all the leaders and farmer brothers should suspend the agitation keeping in view the current situation of Corona pandemic.What according to you will be the political fallout of the farmer agitation?The emotions of everybody are attached with the word kisan. This is also a fact that the income of farmers did not increase during the past 60-70 years after the Independence. There is a need to consider that there were shortcomings in the previous policies. So, there was a need to do something different. I would like to express my gratitude to Modi ji that he has done what the leaders of Congress could not do during all these years.The leaders of BJP-JJP have faced a lot of opposition especially in villages because of the farmer agitation. How do you see this situation?They are political men from Congress and few Communists who by misusing the name of kisan indulge in Jindabad-Murdabad while showing black flags. But this is not going to continue for long. This practice is not good. There are workers of all political parties. If such a system develops, then every (politician) may face a similar situation.","‘Farmers should suspend agitation amid second Covid wave,’ says Haryana minister J P Dalal",MUSTARD OIL

Anand suggests, To get the best results, it is advisable to massage with an oil that contains extracts such as neem, tea tree, lemon, grapeseed and almond oil which helps cleanse your belly button.Oiling the navel helps purify your body and provides healthy glowing skin, free from radical damage.

2021-05-11,https://indianexpress.com/article/world/un-experts-islamic-state-committed-genocide-against-yazidis-7310559/,"In this Tuesday, July 22, 2014, file photo, a motorist passes by a flag of the Islamic State group in central Rawah, 175 miles (281 kilometers) northwest of Baghdad, Iraq, nearly six weeks since a Sunni militant blitz led by the Islamic State extremist group seized large swaths of northern and western Iraq. (AP)The head of a U.N. team investigating atrocities in Iraq announced Monday it has found clear and compelling evidence that Islamic State extremists committed genocide against the Yazidi minority in 2014 and said the militant group successfully developed chemical weapons and used mustard gas.Karem Khan told the Security Council the team also concluded war crimes were committed by the Islamic State group against predominantly Shiite unarmed cadets and personnel from the Tikrit Air Academy who were captured, tortured and subjected to mass execution in June 2014. He said an Islamic State video released in July 2015 showing the killings constitutes a direct and public incitement to commit genocide against Shia Muslims.The Security Council voted unanimously in September 2017 to ask the U.N. to establish an investigative team to help Iraq preserve evidence and promote accountability for what may amount to war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide committed by Islamic State extremists, both in Iraq and the Levant, which includes Syria.In his sixth report to the council, Khan said the U.N. Investigative Team to Promote Accountability for Crimes committed by the Islamic State group, also known as Daesh, ISIL and ISIS, rapidly expanded the amount of evidence it has in the last six months.Read | With a mass funeral, Yazidi survivors honor victims of ISISHe said significant developments in collecting forensic evidence from mass grave sites, digital data extracted from hard drives that belonged to the IS group, digitization of case files, and use of advanced technological tools to process and search databases has allowed the team to establish clear timelines of activities of key ISIL members.Khan called it a landmark moment that the team, known as UNITAD, had established convincing evidence that Islamic State extremists committed genocide against the Yazidi as a religious group with the intent to destroy the Yazidi physically and biologically.This was manifest in the IS ultimatum applied to all Yazidis to convert or die and led to thousands killed, either executed en masse, shot as they fled, or dying from exposure on Mount Sinjar as they tried to escape, Khan said. Thousands more were enslaved, with women and children abducted from their families and subjected to the most brutal abuses, including serial rape and other forms of unendurable sexual violence that for many lasted years, often leading to death.Khan added that crimes against the Yazidis continue, with thousands of women and children separated from their families or missing and some still with their their IS captors or those to whom they were sold.In 2016, the U.N.-mandated Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Syria said the Islamic State group was committing genocide against Yazidis, and several non-governmental organizations have echoed that conclusion.But Khan said what UNITAD has done in terms of the Yazidis is more important because the team was mandated to look at a variety of evidence that could stand up in court where the burden of proof is on the prosecution  and to not just draw brush strokes from a survey of victims.He said information from electronic devices that belonged to IS extremists also led UNITAD to open a new investigation into the development and successful deployment of chemical and biological weapons by ISIL in Iraq.Evidence collected by UNITAD details how the militant group used laboratories at Mosul University as the epicenter of its chemical weapons program, drawing on the expertise of scientists and medical professionals from Iraq and abroad, Khan said.Initially, he said, IS weaponized chlorine from water treatment plants captured by its fighters in 2014, and subsequently developed toxic lethal compounds including thallium and nicotine that were tested on live prisoners, leading to death.IS then developed a system to produce mustard gas, also called sulfur mustard, that was deployed in March 2016 through the firing of 40 rockets at the Turkmen Shia town of Taza Khurmatu, Khan said.Khan, who will become chief prosecutor at the International Criminal Court on June 15, said this investigation is rapidly progressing, with initial results anticipated to be completed within five months. By the end of the year, he said, the team also anticipates initial results addressing crimes against minority Christians, Kakai, Shabak, Shia Turkmen and Sunni communities in Iraq, as well as the massacre of predominantly Shia inmates at Badush prison.Khan said the next step is to use the information and evidence collected by UNITAD to meet the expectations of survivors and put it before national courts to prosecute those responsible for these horrific crimes.He expressed hope that Iraqi legislators will adopt a legal basis to prosecute IS members for war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide. He welcomed legislation presented to Parliament in the Kurdistan region last week to establish a court with jurisdiction over international crimes committed by IS.We must make sure that we dont become this archive, this library, Khan said of the teams evidence.He said every member of the international community should feel this sense of urgency for justice as if their own mother, father or child had lost their life or was not accounted for.Nobel Peace Prize laureate Nadia Murad, a Yazidi forced into sexual slavery by IS fighters who killed her mother and six brothers, urged the Security Council to refer the genocide against her people to the International Criminal Court or establish a court to prosecute those responsible for the atrocities.I ask you to start a new chapter  legal accountability for ISIS crimes would dramatically impact every action of my communitys recovery, she said. It is time for the international community to do, more than listen. It is time to act.

2021-05-12,https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/rural-imperative-indian-economy-agricultural-exports-minimum-support-price-7312693/,"The year 2020-21 was exceptional, where the farm sector expanded by 3 per cent, even as the Indian economy as a whole contracted by 6.5 per cent. Agricultural exports also grew 17.5 per cent, despite the value of the countrys overall merchandise shipments falling by 7.2 per cent. There were three drivers behind this unusual dichotomy. The first, of course, was Covid-19 cases being very low in rural areas last year and the government exempting agricultural activities from lockdown restrictions. The second was excellent rains and favourable winter temperatures that helped farmers harvest a bumper crop. The third was a spike in global agri-commodity prices from around October, the benefits of which were reaped by soyabean, mustard, groundnut, cotton, arhar, urad and chana growers. All these crops were sold near or above their minimum support price (MSP) levels, making it a Goldilocks moment of sorts for farmers, who produced more as well as realised good harvest prices. The end result was that rural India provided a cushion for the economy, which suffered its worst recession since Independence and the first after 1979-80.The availability of that cushion is in doubt today, with the second wave of the pandemic not sparing even the hinterlands. The Indian Meteorological Department has forecast a normal southwest monsoon, while the Food and Agricultural Organisations world food price index hit an 83-month-high in April. On both these fronts  rainfall and prices  the outlook for agriculture, thus, remains favourable. That leaves the one, albeit major, source of uncertainty: The spread, intensity and duration of the pandemic. The sole consolation as of now is that the main kharif planting season will begin only from mid-June with the arrival of the monsoon rains. If the current wave subsides by then, things shouldnt turn out too bad. That, needless to add, is a best case scenario  including for tractor, FMCG and cement companies that rode high on rural demand in 2020-21.Last year, the government did two things that were right. The first one was to undertake massive procurement of wheat, paddy, mustard and rabi pulses that were marketed post the lockdown. The second was the record 389.37 crore person-days of employment that got generated under MGNREGA during 2020-21. Both these, together with the Rs 6,000-per-farmer cash transfer under PM-Kisan, ensured sizeable liquidity infusion into the rural economy. This year, there is not much requirement for MSP procurement, barring in wheat. The scope of MGNREGA works is also limited when Covid has made deep inroads into rural areas. The focus should, instead, be more on cash transfers. Theres no better time to put to use the JAM (Jan Dhan-Aadhaar-Mobile) infrastructure than now.",Rural imperative,MUSTARD OIL
2021-05-13,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/indian-meads-make-a-buzz-with-fruit-and-floral-honey-notes/article34552105.ece,"Produced with a minimal carbon footprint, Indian meads rely on existing bee colonies on farmlands, and are slowly making a buzz in the countryWhat is the most sustainably produced alcoholic beverage? It is a non-grain recipe, once known as the elixir of the gods: Mead. Crafted from honey and water and fermented by yeast, mead leaves a small carbon footprint since it depends on bees and nectar already available on existing farmlands, unlike grains that are cultivated specifically for beer, rum or whiskey.In terms of alcohol content, mead is closer to wine than beer, ranging between eight to 20% ABV (the amount of alcohol/ethanol in a drink). Mead is widely thought to be one of the oldest alcoholic beverages, with evidence of a fermented beverage made of honey, rice, and fruit dating to 7BC in China.Over the past decade, meaderies in India have slowly been taking this story forward in some pockets of the country. In barely a year since it opened, Nashik-based Cerana Meads is supplying to select hotels and restaurants in Mumbai, Pune, Thane and Nashik.Pune-based Moonshine, which holds the distinction of being Asias first meadery, has been around since 2018 and retails its experimental wares across retail at about 200 stores and 200 restaurants across Mumbai, Pune, Aurangabad, Nashik, Navi Mumbai,Thane and Goa.We began with just two tanks when we were testing the waters for mead, then we scaled up with two larger tanks and now we have 20,000 litre tanks like the ones at wineries, at our factory. Our idea is to have a pan India footprint and build a global brand, says Moonshine co-founder Rohan Rehani. Clearly, mead is in demand.Built by curiosityFor Yoginee Budhkar and Ashwini Deore, co-founders at Cerana Meads in Nashik, starting a meadery in 2020 was a natural progression of their interest in beekeeping and their fascination with fermentation. Yoginee explains, While doing my doctorate in Food Engineering and Technology, I had a fortuitous introduction to meads while visiting a professor in the UK. My friend and fellow PhD scholar Ashwini was enthusiastic about creating an innovative product from agricultural resources, and her love for wine and spirits led us to Cerana Meads.Along with its flagship mead, the meadery has collaborated with breweries in Maharashtra and Karnataka to make braggots, melding malt and mead, and also makes Indias very first pyment  a mead using grapes. Their version uses chenin blanc grapes from Nashik.Ceranas melomels, which are fruit-infused meads, highlight both local produce and natural honey, Our jamun (black plum) melomel uses local jamuns and jamun honey, which is earthy and spicy. For our pomegranate melomel, we have a lychee honey that has floral notes. We also use multi-floral honey from forests in Himachal Pradesh, where you find citrus fruits and flowers, says Yoginee.All of Ceranas offerings are priced at 180 a pint except for their Yule spice sold in winter at 450. The products find takers among the 25-40 age bracket, largely upper middle class consumers who have travelled and are curious to try out homegrown craft beverages. Says Cerana customer Shilpa Brahme from Pune, Their jamun melomel and yule spice continue to be my favourites. Being a home-baker, I have also used Yule spice for cake preparations when Ive invited friends for dinner and dessert.Business of beesThe founders at Cerana have undergone training in beekeeping. In every natural hive, a portion of the honey is used as food for the bee larvae, and the surplus gets stored in the upper one-third of the structure.Manmade bee-boxes mimic this ingenious design. The upper one-third of the bee-box, called the super, is where honey is stored. The lower two-thirds, called the brood box, houses the queen and worker bees. It took us painstaking effort to convince beekeepers to start using only the supers for their honey collection, instead of invading the brood box, and we buy only that honey for our mead production, states Yoginee.Bee Whisperer Akshay Borse at work for the Moonshine Project. Photo: Special Arrangement/THE HINDUHoney is also important to entrepreneur duo Rohan Rehani and Nitin Vishwas, who started Moonshine. Back then, meads did not exist in the Indian excise lexicon. Now Moonshine Meadery in addition to its regular stream of meads in the market, has branched out to a special Moonshine Honey Project.Moonshine has its own bee whisperer, Akshay Borse, with two years of experience on the field, 10 harvests across the country, and probably 1,000 bee stings, Akshay has made it his mission to change the way beekeeping is practised in the country, adds Rohan. The Mustard honey harvested from Doonda, Rajasthan, in January 2021, tastes like a lemon glaze, quite counterintuitive to the memory of pungent mustard.Our latest harvest was in March, an acacia honey which we will use for the next edition of the Project X mead, to highlight the wonderful single-origin honey that our country has to offer, states Nitin. To revive beekeeping, bee-boxes have been set up in and around Pune, and the Mulshi valley.The post-processing filtration and packaging is carried out below 38 degrees Celsius, to preserve all the bio-enzymes produced by the bees. The lockdown has been busy at Moonshine, with the launch of MeadLABS, gluten-free meads celebrating seasonal fruits andhoney, priced between 130 in Goa to 190 in Maharashtra. The meadery plans to expand retail in Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Kerala by 2022.Moonshines grilled pineapple mead is made with rum-soaked pineapple that has been grilled over coal and combined with a multi-floral honey.

In fact, Dushyant says, this time, 82.1 lakh MT of wheat has been lifted from mandis in a record time due to which the farmers did not have to face loss due to the storm and rain.For the first time in the country, the Haryana government made a provision under which 9 per cent interest was to be paid to the farmer if there was a delay in making a payment. About Rs 77 lakh have been given to farmers as additional interest in such cases, he added.Giving information about the mustard crop, Chautala said that last time over 7 lakh MT of mustard was procured at MSP, and this time the same has been increased to Rs 4,650 per quintal.The state government did not have to procure a single grain of mustard on MSP this time, as farmers were (even) paid Rs 7,275 per quintal in the market, he claimed.He reiterated the commitment to increase health facilities in rural areas and said that an amount of Rs 18.40 crore for 6,136 gram panchayats with less than 10,000 population and Rs 4.90 crore for 98 gram panchayats with over 10,000 population, has been approved to build isolation wards in villages. A 10-member team will look after the health facilities in these isolation wards out of which five members will be from the health department while the rest will be from the gram panchayat.Tauktae alert for next 48 hoursChautala also warned the people regarding Tauktae which is approaching towards the state. He urged the people to stay vigilant during the next 48 hours and to not step out of their homes. According to the Meteorological Department, the cyclone is moving towards Haryana via Gujarat, Rajasthan and its speed can be up to 50 kilometers per hour.All deputy commissioners have been instructed to conduct regular monitoring in this regard. Instructions have been given to make arrangements in order to ensure that there is no loss of life and property in any district, he said.","Over Rs 15,000 cr transferred to farmers under DBT scheme: Dushyant Chautala",MUSTARD OIL

We believe he fell in love with its culture and found remnants of his beloved Lucknow in Metiabruz or Matiaburj where he chose to settle,"" said Shahenshah Mirza, 54, a civil servant and a history buff.The nawab, over the years, built some 18 palaces and the landmark Sibtainabad Imambara in Calcutta, but his descendants live scattered as the British demolished the palazzos on one pretext or the other.Mirza and his father, 86-year-old Sahebzada Wasif Mirza - the president of the Awadh Royal Family Association -- now live in a modest though stately old house at Talbagan Lane, off Dargah Road, in the heart of the eastern metropolis.""Just 500 of his followers came with him in 1856, but as news spread that he was building a Lucknow-like city within a city, at Metiabruz in Calcutta, many of his nobles, artisans and musicians followed and flourished here,"" said Mirza.Though much of the original mini-city which Wajid Ali built was taken over for Garden Reach shipyards, Metiabruz still exists and is now famous as a garment tailoring hub -- reportedly accounting for Rs 15,000 crore worth of textile trade a year -- mainly on account of the skilled tailors who came here as part of the Nawab's entourage.Wajid Ali, who used the pen name ""Akhtarpiya"" for his poetry, prose and thumris, was a known patron of arts, and with the destruction of Mughal cities in the aftermath of the 1857 revolt, Kolkata subsequently became the new cultural capital, attracting talent from all over north India.As time progressed, Bengal's zamindars and rich 'bhadraloks' (gentlemen) enthusiastically developed a taste for the Nawab's leisure activities 'mujra' (music and dance soirees), kite-flying and pigeon games (kabootar baazi). ""Even today some 3,000 people are engaged in the business of making kites in this city,"" explained Mirza.The nawab introduced the citys elite to Thumri, Dhrupad and Kathak. ""Singers and dancers of the calibre of Bindadin Maharaj, Piyari Sahab, Gauhar Jaan, Malka Jaan, Jauhar Jaan came to settle here...Kolkata opened up to Kathak and thumris,"" said well-known Shantiniketan-based musicologist Rantideb Maitra.This, in later years, influenced the film industry and the dance and music forms became part of the pan-Indian culture.The song 'Babul Mora' itself was popularised by Kolkata-based music director Rai Chand Boral when he got Kundan Lal Saigal to sing it for the movie 'Street Singer' in 1938, nearly 80 years after it was written.""Kathak, though it started as a temple dance, had taken a stylised form under the Mughal patronage. When brought to Kolkata by Wajid Ali, who himself often danced as Krishna, it blossomed into a popular classical dance form,"" said Shyam Banerjee, another musicologist and Urdu translator.However, if the average Kolkatan remembers the Awadh ruler with fondness, it is because of the gastronomic legacy he left behind.Said Manzilat Fatima, another of Wajid Ali's descendants from his junior begum, Hazrat Mahal -- who led mutineers in Lucknow and eventually escaped to Nepal -- ""He (Wajid Ali) tried to recreate Lucknow but with a difference...(among other things) his kitchen became an experimental centre for new dishes.""Fatima (53), who runs the up-market restaurant Manzilat's explained that experiments led to the inclusion of potato -- then a rich man's exotic vegetable favoured by Europeans -- and eggs to Awadh's Biryani. ""New spices, coconut milk, mustard oil, all went into the making of Awadhi dishes and the result was the unique dum-pukht Kokata Biryani, now so popular all over,"" she said.The Nawab also set up a printing press in Metiabruz and came out with a weekly gazette in Urdu, adding to the literary and journalistic tradition of the city, which boasts of being the cradle to some of India's oldest newspapers.""We feel he was more popular in the city he chose to make his own than in Lucknow...When the legendary filmmaker, Satyajit Ray, asked my father how he saw Wajid Ali's legacy, he had explained that it lives on, as is evident from the fact that 'you chose to make your first Hindi movie - Shatranj ke Khilari - on a novel based on the the Awadh ruler's life',"" added Mirza.","'Piya ka des': 165 years on, Nawab Wajid Ali Shah's legacy lives on in Kolkata",MUSTARD OIL

Of the 1.4 lakh cotton seed packets (450 grams each) required for this season, 59.32 lakh packets were already positioned in districts.The Minister also stated that the government was not supplying soyabean seed due to non-availability of quality seed on account of excessive and untimely rains in Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh during the last kharif season. The seed was mostly sourced from these two States. He suggested that the farmers either grow alternative crops to soyabean or be extra careful while purchasing seed from private dealers.Asking the field level officials to educate farmers from now on against taking up paddy cultivation on a large scale during the next rabi (yasangi) and instead going for crops such as groundnut, sesamum, mustard and others having good demand in the edible oil market.To encourage cultivation of pulses, particularly redgram, the government had also decided to supply two kg of redgram seed per acre for growing it as an inter-crop with cotton and others. He also suggested that farmers not purchase seed, fertilizer and pesticide from unlicensed dealers and also insist on proper receipt for every purchase so that it could be helpful in getting compensation in case the seed proves to be spurious.","Positioning of seed, other inputs stepped up: Minister",MUSTARD OIL

The mere nature of the rising cases, especially post-COVID-19 is enough to scare people.Unfortunately, the rising proportion of cases has also fueled disputed claims on social media. One such recent one made people believe that things in their home could be spreading scary fungal infections.A recent claim on social media, which has been widely shared has made many believe that the vegetables stored in your refrigerator can have black fungus.Read more: Fact Check: Can black fungus be cured by turmeric, rock salt, alum and mustard oil? A post on Facebook, originally published in Hindi advises people to be careful of common use vegetables, including onions which could be a harbinger of black fungus infection.The post roughly could be translated as ""Beware while buying onions from the market and storing them in the refrigerator. The black grime or fungus often seen on the outer shell of the onions is toxic black fungus that causes mucormycosis.""The viral claim further mentions that if people are not too careful, the black grime can spread if used while cooking curries or stored in the refrigerator's cool settings.Read more: Can you get black fungus infection without testing positive for COVID-19? The writers of the post also claimed that the black mould can collect on the refrigerator surfaces and cause harm.Ever since the date of publishing, the post has been widely shared across platforms.Not only is the claim completely untrue, but the mode of transmission for black fungus also isn't through mere objects, or in this case, fruits or vegetables.For one, the fungi which form inside the refrigerator, the fungal grime present on onion shells are completely different from the black fungus infection.As per experts, the moulds which grew inside a refrigerator may be caused by some forms of bacteria, yeast. While they can be dangerous and cause contamination, they showcase nonspecific symptoms.The fungus, meanwhile, found on the onion shells is the result of a common fungus found in the soil. While it is pertinent that all vegetables be thoroughly washed before use, the fungus found on onions is rarely infectious.The black fungus infection, on the other hand, spreads in a very different manner and is many more times symptomatic. As per health experts, it carries a mortality rate of 50%.Black fungus infection, which is spread through fungal moulds called 'mycormetes' are present in the environment. The infectious spores cause the dangerous disease when a person, who is at risk of infection inhales them via contaminated surfaces (such as unsanitary environment) or humid temperatures. Simply put, it doesn't spread through the food you eat or objects you may touch, but when you inhale these contagious moulds through unclean surfaces.Reports have also suggested that the use of unfiltered or unclean water supply used for oxygenation in COVID-cases may also be a source of transmission of disease.Additionally, a black fungal infection, though carries a high mortality, isn't infectious for everybody. As per AIIMS Director and renowned medical expert, Dr Randeep Guleria, people suffering from extreme or uncontrolled diabetes, or those who have been using steroid therapy for long, since their immunity could be suppressed.Mucurmycetes infection also primarily affects people who are suffering from severe comorbidities or routinely consume medications that suppress the body's immunity to fight off infections.Furthermore, a black fungus infection can be diagnosed and detected by extracting a fluid sample from the sinus passage, tissue imaging and prior medical history.The information on black fungus infection has been clarified by a number of credible medical experts and doctors. Guidelines, information have also been listed down by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) on social media.There's no truth to the matter of the black fungus infection is similar to the moulds growing in your refrigerator, or the onion. At a time like this, it is critical that we get our facts right, be aware of the symptoms and seek treatment at the earliest. If you have recently recovered from coronavirus, or experience symptoms such as black crust formation around the nose, excruciating headaches, swelling, redness, seek a doctor's consultation at the earliest.",Fact Check: Can you catch black fungus from your refrigerator?,MUSTARD OIL

The party accused the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) of reversing all economic gains made by the Congress led United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government, insensitive treatment of the farmers, inept handling of the COVID-19 pandemic and failing to protect the country against threats from China.Randeep Surjewala, Congress general secretary and in-charge of communication department, in a virtual press conference said the Modi government was the weakest government India had had in 73 years.When the UPA government demitted office in 2014, the GDP was 8.1%, Mr. Surjewala said. Even before the pandemic hit in 2019-20 the GDP had fallen to 4.2%. In the first quarter of the 2020-21, the GDP was down to minus 24.1% and in the second quarter it is now minus 7.5%. It is estimated that in 2020-21 the GDP will be close to minus 8%, he said.High unemployment rateThe government came to power on the promise of providing two crore employment. In seven years they should have provided 14 crore jobs. Forget about 14 crore jobs, the unemployment rate is on a 45-year high, he added.Skyhigh inflation was exacerbating the already volatile situation. Petrol is selling at 100 per litre while mustard oil at 200 per litre. The LPG cylinders are at 809 per. The rate of pulses is also skyrocketing, he added.The Congress leader also slammed the government for its insensitive attitude towards the farmers. He said that the BJP government wanted big corporations to replace the small farmers. He also accused the government of going back on their promise of implementation of the Swaminathan Commission report.Govt is against poorThis government is not against poverty, they are against the poor, he said pointing at the World Bank report that claimed that during the UPA years 27 crore persons overcame extreme poverty while the PEW Research Centre in 2020 said middle class had shrunk in India with nearly 3.20 crore people being pushed off the grid.Mr. Surjewala reiterated the Congresss earlier allegation that the government had been under-reporting the COVID-19 deaths. Will the Modi government explain why there is a paucity of vaccines? And if there were no vaccines for us then why were 6.63 crore vaccines sent to the other countries, he said.Despite the chest-thumping by the Modi government, Mr. Surjewala said, China continued to occupy the Indian territory with impunity in Ladakh and Arunachal Pradesh.",Seven years in power: Congress releases ‘chargesheet’ against PM Modi,MUSTARD OIL

affection.""This government is harmful for the country as it has betrayed the faith of people of India.It is betraying the trust and the innate faith the people reposed in prime minister Narendra Modi,"" he said.""This is a deception of the worst kind heaped upon 140 crore Indians by a government they elected based on innumerable promises.After seven years time has come to do stock taking.Time

runaway inflation where petrol is crossing Rs 100 for first time in 70 years and mustard oil is crossing Rs 200 per litre.""The Modi government is guilty of unpardonable compromise on national

pseudo-nationalist government utterly failed to defend our borders and to push back the Chinese from our territory"".""Time has come to ask who is responsible for insurmountable devastation, agony and anguish and unfathomable pain that has been inflicted on the people of India and that is why it is time for stock-taking,"" he said.On the Congress's poor performance at the hustings and the party not being considered as an alternative force, Surjewala said the party leadership is aware that its first priority is to save the nation from the Modi-made disaster and ensure bringing the nation back on the path of progress and help put money in the pockets of people, increase their incomes and wipe the tears of farmers and reach out to the poor and vulnerable.""The Congress party is working out what needs to be done to fulfil these priorities,"" he said, adding that the party will work harder to win the trust of the people.The Congress leader said party chief Sonia Gandhi has ensured that it can

2021-05-30,https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/chandigarh/shift-from-paddy-wheat-cycle-to-oilseeds-isnt-as-difficult-as-it-appears-for-punjab-farmers-7337392/,"At a time when India is meeting over 60% of its edible oil demand through imports at high prices and when Punjabs farmers are targeted for growing only two crops, wheat-paddy, that are supported by an assured MSP, can not the Punjab government, which is blaming the Centre for interfering in agriculture being a state subject and had negated the three farm laws by passing its own three legislations, not frame some policy/law and take initiative to encourage farmers to grow oilseeds, that once used to be its traditional crop but has now been forgotten to a large extent.Also, a little push from the state will ready buyers for oilseeds crop because of its huge consumption and less domestic production, experts say.Why is Punjab, which has all the right to make laws on agricultural subject, not taking steps to become self-dependent or be the leader in growing oilseeds. The answer is lack of political will as well as no vision of the successive governments towards diversification of crops, farmer leaders say.Punjab used to cultivate almost 8 times more area under oilseeds than what is is cultivating now.Data sourced from the Punjab Agriculture University (PAU) Ludhiana, revealed that in 1967-68, Punjab had 3.99 lakh hectares area under oilseeds cultivation (which was maximum in its history since 1960-61).This area reduced to 48,900 hectares (provisional) in 2019-20 which is over 8 times less in area than what it was over five decades back. Also the total production then was 3.14 lakh tonnes, which came down to around 56,000 tonnes in 2018-19.Earlier, groundnut, sesamum, cotton (kharif crops) while sunflower, rapeseed and mustard (rabi crops) used to be grown in large areas.The area under groundnut cultivation was 2.22 lakh hectares in 1967-68 which has now come down to just 1,800 hectares. While the production has come down from 2.40 lakh tonnes to 3,600 tonnes but the yield has increased from 1,024 kg to 1,980 kg per hectare because of good quality of seeds.Similarly, area of rapeseed/mustard has come down to around 3,800 hectares from 1.80 lakh hectares five decades back and the production is now 57,000 tonnes against the then 1.40 lakh tonnes. The per hectare yield of this crop has doubled from 778 kg to 1,478 kg per hectare.Sunflower, which was introduced in Punjab in the early 1990s, had 1.03 lakh hectares in 1995-96 which has now reduced to 4,400 hectares and its production came down from 1.61 lakh tonnes to 8,300 tonnes. However, its yield has increased from 1,566 kg to 1,886 kg per hectare now.Seamum was cultivated in 25,600 hectares in 1974-75 which has come down to 41,000 hectares now while its yield too has decreased from 359 kg to 345 kg per hectares.Talking to The Indian Express, Dr Virender Sardana, Principal Agronomist (oilseeds) at PAU, said, Punjab is blessed to have agro-climatic conditions that are best suited for growing both kharif and rabi season oilseeds. We had been a big producer of these crops till the onset of the Green Revolution when farmers moved to wheat-paddy cycle. It is because of the assured market price that the farmers have got used to. Demand for oilseeds in India is huge. What it calls for is only a little impetus and focused approach of the state government. Paddy is a known water-guzzling crop, and we are not exporting rice but exporting our precious ground blue water.Fortunately, almost all the sarson (mustard) grown in Punjab is Canola sarson, which is the best among all varieties from a health point of view and Punjab can become the leading producer of this crop in the country too. As much Punjab moves to oilseeds, it dependence on the central government will reduce, which has of late, been putting difficult conditions on the state and its farmers just before the wheat and paddy procurment season, he said.Even if Punjab government buys Canola sarson directly from farmers and export it under its own established brands such as Sohna of Markfed, it will soon run out of stock as the well-developed western markets of Europe and North America only use Canola Sarson for human consumption and no other, he said, adding that Sohnas Sarson da Saag is already a big hit among NRIs settled in Europe, Australia and North America.Farmers would be far more than happy to cultivate Canola sarson instead of wheat as it consumes less water, less time and less input cost while its MSP is also quite good, he said.Currently, the total consumption of oil in the state is around 0.54 million tonnes to 0.60 million tonnes. According to the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare data, the per capita oil consumption of India is around 19.5 kg.Going by this calculation, Punjabs consumption will come around to 0.54 million tonnes as Punjab has 2.77 crore population. And this consumption is 2.07% of countrys total oil consumption.Punjabs gross cropped area in 2018-19 was estimated at 78.30 lakh hectares (lh). Out of that, 35.20 lh was under wheat cultivation and another 31.03 lh under paddy, adding up to 84.6% of the total area planted to all crops. That ratio was just over 32% in 1960-61 and 47.4% in 1970-71. This was the result of the Green Revolution.Punjab needs to divert at least 10-12 lakh hectares to other crops. The state can easily increase area under oilseeds by reviving areas under groundnut, sesame, cotton, mustard oil, sunflower and these crops can be easily grown on 10 to 15 hecatres during kharif and rabi seasons collectively. But the state government needs to support its farmers just like other state government do if the MSP of any crop goes down, said Jagmohan Singh, general secretary, BKU (Dakuanda), adding that farmers can grow anything provided he gets an assured market for his produce.Why is the government unable to keep a corpus of few 100 crores for crops other than wheat and paddy for support in case of need, asks a farmer.",Shift from paddy-wheat cycle to oilseeds isn’t as difficult as it appears for Punjab,MUSTARD OIL
2021-06-01,https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/feul-prices-covid-lockdown-indian-economy-7340214/,"Lockdown-induced curbs on economic activity and being mostly confined indoors may have led many to look past the steep hikes in petrol and diesel prices  roughly Rs 4-4.5 per litre in the current month alone. The same, however, cannot be said about edible oils, whose consumption would have gone up with more food getting cooked in homes. The sharp price increase in these is noticeable and is biting consumers. Packed mustard, groundnut and sunflower oil are now retailing at an average of Rs 175-180 per kg, as against Rs 110-140 a year ago. All-India modal prices of even the mass-consumed vanaspati, palm and soyabean oil have risen from Rs 85-90 to Rs 140-150/kg in the last one year.India imports 13-15 million tonnes (mt) of edible oils annually, while domestic production is only 7.5-8.5 mt. The prices that consumers, therefore, pay are largely linked to what it costs to import them. Landed prices of imported crude palm, soyabean and sunflower oil in India now, at around $1,200, $1,400 and $1,550 per tonne, respectively, are way higher than their corresponding May 2020 averages of $558, $672 and $789. The reasons for petrol, diesel and LPG cylinder prices going up in the recent period, apply equally to cooking oil. There is one fundamental difference, though: Unlike with petroleum, where only a handful of indigenous crude producers (as opposed to refiners) exist, India has several thousand oilseed growers. These farmers make money when edible oil prices harden in the international and domestic market. And they did this time: Groundnut, soyabean and mustard traded near or above their official minimum support prices during both the kharif and rabi marketing seasons.Edible oils apart, prices of pulses  mainly chana (chickpea) and tur (pigeon-pea)  have also shown an uptrend, albeit far less compared to the former. The Narendra Modi government, it seems, is concerned. On May 15, imports of major pulses were moved from the restricted to free list. While that is welcome  regulating imports should always be through tariffs, not quantitative restrictions  a simultaneous move directing millers, traders and importers to disclose their stocks on a weekly basis isnt. The government needs to take a balanced view: India produces too much rice, wheat and sugar, while being import-dependent on pulses and edible oils. Farmers should be encouraged to grow more of the latter, which also requires less water. When market prices are favouring this virtuous shift in cropping pattern, any administrative action sending out the opposite signals  ahead of the kharif planting season  is unwelcome.","Oil, on balance",MUSTARD OIL

People of all sections are expecting some relief during the recession and pandemic, but the government is recovering every penny possible from them, he said.""The government, which has already collected huge taxes from the public, has now turned to poor farmers who raise cattle to supplement their income. Not only this, the government has given the responsibility of all the fairs to a single contractor, he added and demanded an inquiry to find out why the government bypassed the government process to benefit the contractor as he sought an immediate withdrawal of the fee hike in cattle fairs.Hooda said that the government has also targeted the poor of the state along with the cattle farmers as the poor now have to deal with market forces. First, the pulses were stopped, after that the subsidy on gas cylinders was abolished, now from the month of June, they have stopped giving mustard oil on the ration card, he said.Apart from this, the leader of opposition has drawn the attention of the government towards the supply of black fungus medicine.""The government has formed a state level committee, which is operating from the state headquarter Panchkula.

(Express File)The Haryana State Co-operative Supply and Marketing Federation Limited (HAFED) has said that it will not distribute mustard oil and salt to AAY and BPL beneficiaries from this month onwards. Saying that farmers have sold their mustard yield to private players and salt could not be procured due to Covid-19 lockdown, HAFED has discontinued the two items.So, the state government has decided to deposit Rs 250 directly into the bank accounts of Antyodaya Anna Yojana (AAY) and Below Poverty Line (BPL) families, it said.It is to inform the general public that HAFED has been unable to procure mustard oil as farmers have sold their produce at a high rate of about Rs 6,500 to Rs 7,000 per quintal in the open market. Because of this ration depots will be unable to distribute oil to the beneficiaries, a HAFED spokesman said, Friday.He added, In this context, it has been decided by the state government that from June-2021, the subsidy (to the tune of Rs 250/- per 2 litre) on mustard oil to be given to the beneficiaries will be directly deposited in their bank accounts. This will benefit a total of 11,40,748 families. This will continue till mustard is available with HAFED. The government is making continuous efforts to ensure the availability of mustard.Meanwhile, beneficiaries are informed that the supplier of salt has been unable to arrange 1 kg packs due to the lockdown. Thus, salt will also not be distributed this month. It is known to the general public that no subsidy is provided on salt as it is purchased in bulk by the government and distributed to the beneficiaries at low prices. Since, the supply of salt is done through a supplier appointed by Confed, so as soon as packs of 1 kg salt is available, its distribution will be resumed. Haryana Food, Civil Supplies and Consumer Affairs Department is committed to safeguard the interests of consumers, the spokesman added.It was in April, 2018 when chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar had announced that the quantity of mustard oil being provided to BPL and AAY families be enhanced from 1 to 2 litres. That time, Khattar had also directed HAFED to increase the procurement of mustard in the state and evolve an effective system for the trading of mustard oil in national and international markets.He had also added that surplus mustard oil available after selling the same at HAFED outlets and providing to BPL as well as AAY families, should be sold in the national and international markets.","Haryana: No mustard oil, salt to AAY, BPL families in Haryana from June onwards",MUSTARD OIL

In the 1980s, Hema's husbands business brought the family to Delhi. She packed a trove of Chettinad recipes and moved North with her husband and three young children.Her daughter, Anjali, recalls that growing up, her friends couldn't get enough of Hema's South Indian fare. ""The idlis and sambar served at home weren't the cookie-cutter stuff available at Delhi restaurants then. The flavours were intense. Eating our food was guaranteed to transport you all the way South,"" says Anjali.In 2016, she and her mother launched Hema's South Indian at Greater Kailash II in Delhi. Hema is the culinary creative brain, while Anjali is the taster and marketing maven, who also designs recipes and menus, and cooks with her mother.They conducted workshops in their kitchen, teaching clients the basics of Chettinad cooking. Enamoured by the exotic and unfamiliar tastes, Delhis ladies who lunched spread the word. Hema started retailing authentic batter, unlike the packaged variety on sale on supermarket shelves.Soon, the Gupta ladies expanded their scale of operations by selling the food they cooked, setting up stalls at popular weekly markets and fairs, and catering for small parties.Now Hemas South Indian is a byword for Chettinad food in Delhi. In 2020, the lockdown forced Hemas epicurean enterprise to shut shop, but the regulars didnt give up. Says Anjali, ""The pandemic was a game-changer. We sold everything from batter to customised food. Before we knew it, we were preparing weekly menus and doing zonal deliveries on specified days across Delhi-NCR.""A client even sends his driver once a week, all the way from Hisar in Haryana to the Gurgaon border, where a delivery guy waits for him with his orders. The Indian gastronomic trend of the noughties was modernising traditional recipes, which has not stopped avant-garde chefs from experimenting until now.Anjali's contributions were the Gunpowder Prawns, Chettinad Mutton Chops and Filter Coffee Pana Cotta prepared with the freshest ingredients. She added non-vegetarian and spicy variants of Hema's traditional dishes to the menu, since she had her finger on Delhi's belly.Despite being head-chef, Hema has never tasted meat. Yet, she intuitively knows what meat is best suited to which curry or powder mix. ""After the curry base is ready, I taste it and advise Anjali on what kind of meat will go best with it,"" shares Hema.Though their extensive menu changes on a weekly basis, the popular dishes remain the same - Mutton Pepper Masala, Crab Sukka, and Malabari Fish Curry are the non-vegetarian options. The high-selling vegetarian dishes include Tangy Pineapple Curry, Jackfruit Chettinad Gravy, soft fluffy idlis with home-made podi, appams, neer dosa, idiyappams, and Malabar parottas. For dessert it is Filter Coffee Panna Cotta or Black Rice Pudding.After the second wave of COVID-19, the team at Hema's South Indian noticed a demand for healthier food options. People were choosing nourishment over fulfilment. The menu was modified by adding new dishes that took the change into consideration.Most appreciated are the prawns cooked in coconut broth without chillies, and appams made with ragi millet.

2021-06-23,https://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/chennai/2021/jun/23/the-boons-of-barnyard-2320006.html,"Sahana Iyer ByExpress News ServiceCHENNAI: The thought of replacing rice in a South Indian household is close to blasphemy. However, with a health-conscious wave looming, millets are finding their permanent residence in kitchens across Tamil Nadu. While some triumphed early on after trials, testing and tasting, others like the barnyard millet or kuthiraivali, scientifically Echinochloa Frumentacea, are now inching their way into peoples diets. .Nutritionally superior to all other millets and cereals, barnyard millet is the wealthiest reserve of fibre and minerals in the food group. Barnyard is the healthiest option of the millets. Low in calories and high in fibre, protein and minerals, replacing merely one meal of other cereals with it can be extremely beneficial. It is also a good choice for those beginning a millet-inclusive diet, says Dr PV Lakshmi, chief dietician at Gleneagles Global Health City.Popularly grown in the Himalayas, barnyard is an important crop to hills and tribal agriculture. It is also grown on a smaller scale in Tamil Nadu, Uttarakhand, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Maharashtra, and Madhya Pradesh. Globally, India is the largest producer of this millet. A fast-growing crop that isresistant to adverse weather conditions, barnyard is a great choice for sustenance farmers and as an alternate crop to replace failed monsoon harvests. The green stems and leaves grow up to 50-95 cm in height and are ready to harvest in merely 45 days.Once harvested, they are threshed by trampling, by bullocks, to produce the nutritional grains we receive. You can make kuthiraivali upma, pongal, dosa, kesari or even try some snacks like murukku and tikki, mentions Dr Lakshmi. Labelled the superior millet, one has to assume it has health benefits aplenty. Dr Lakshmi shares some prominent pros of consuming barnyard millet.Rich reserve of ironJust one meal of barnyard millet can satiate 50 per cent of your daily iron requirements. The low reserve of calcium prevents interference in the absorption of iron and thus, it is the ideal choice in the food group for iron requirements. Hot tip: garnish your food containing the millet with some lemon juice to give even better absorption.Perfect fit for anaemic needsAnaemia refers to a condition indicating a low count of red blood cells or haemoglobin in a patient. With its high dose of iron, barnyard millet is a preventer. It is often prescribed liberally to anaemic patients.An abundant supply of fibreThe ample fibre content in barnyard millet works to the benefit of the human body in several ways  it can prevent a few types of cancer, particularly colon; it relieves constipation; provides satiety or fullness of the stomach, aiding in weight reduction. Furthermore, the presence of amylase, a starch-digesting enzyme, improves digestion.Gluten-free nourishmentLike other millets, barnyard is also free of gluten and can be easily adopted by those who are gluten-intolerant or following gluten-restricted diets.Cuts down cholesterolThose who are looking to reduce their cholesterol can greatly benefit from adding a portion of barnyard to their diet. The low-fat content in the millet absorbs and reduces cholesterol and fat absorption.Prevents cardiovascular diseasesWhile the millet has low-fat content, the presence of fatty acids such as linoleic acid, palmitic acid, and oleic acids are good for the prevention of cardiovascular diseases.For a diabetic-friendly dietThe fatty acids in barnyard millet, coupled with a moderate glycemic index, also cater to the needs of those with diabetes.NUTRITIONAL BREAKDOWN(per 100 g)Energy: 307 kcalProtein: 8.2 g, Fat: 2.2 gCarbohydrates: 65.6 gFibre: 12.5 g, Minerals: 4.4 gCalcium: 23.2 mg, Phosphorus: 280 mgIron: 10-15 mg, Vitamin B1: 0.4 mgVitamin B2: 0.1 mgNiacin (Vitamin B3): 4.2 mgSource: Dr PV Lakshmi,Gleneagles Global Health CityBarnyard millet pudina rice(by cookbook author Krishnakumari Jayakumaar)INGREDIENTSBarnyard millet: 1 cupPudina (Mint):  bunchGreen chillies: 3-4 piecesRed chillies: 2 piecesLemon: 1 pieceMustard seeds: 1 tspUrad Dal: 1 tspChana Dal: 1 tspCurry leaves: 1-2Water: 3  cupsGinger, PeanutsSalt to tastePREPARATIONSoak the millets in one cup of water for five hours at least.Grind together pudina leaves, green chillies, a small piece of ginger, juice of half a lemon and salt to create a chutney.METHODCook the soaked millet in 2  cups of water.To a pan of hot oil, add and saute mustard seeds, urad dal, chana dal, a few peanuts, curry leaves, and red chillies.Pour in your pudina chutney to the same pan and reduce the chutney quantity till the water has evaporated.Once it is reduced, add the cooked millet and salt and mix gently on a slow flame.Take the pan off the heat after 3-4 minutes of cooking.Serve hot and enjoy!",The boons of barnyard,MUSTARD OIL

During the worst of times when the fight should have been united, religion was used to divide, she added. The pandemic has been approached without a plan and is unscientific.Stating that when India is in the grip of the pandemic and witnessing the highest wholesale price index in 11 years, Ms. Karat said: Purchasing power of people has collapsed. While the Centre has helped corporates with tax concessions and financial help, there has been no cash transfers for the poor. Livelihood of 12 crore people has been lost, she added.Referring to the dilution of Essential Commodities Act earlier by the Centre, she said that the importance of price control mechanism is more profound now when the price of commodities has gone up. The cost of a litre of mustard oil has doubled in one year.Further, she said: When the Centre can spend Rs. 20,000 crore for the Central Vista project, but has refused to compensate COVID-19 deaths.

(Representational Image)THE FOOD Safety Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) has banned blending of mustard oil with any other oil. Blending of edible oils was first permitted by the Indian government in the 1990s. After the outbreak of dropsy (due to adulteration of mustard oil) in the late 1990s, the government pushed for blending mustard oil with other edible oils.Experts see the FSSAIs decision as a big opportunity for mustard growers in India and replacing traditional rapeseed-mustard oil varieties with Canola rapeseed-mustard to provide a healthy oil for human consumption and decrease Indias dependence on oil import.VIRENDER SARDANA, principal agronomist and in-charge, oilseeds section, department of plant breeding and genetics, Punjab Agriculture University (PAU), Ludhiana, speaks to ANJU AGNIHOTRI CHABA on what makes canola rapeseed-mustard oil the healthiest oil for human consumption.What are the benefits of vegetable oils?Daily intake of a certain minimum amount of fats is necessary for physical and mental well-being. The nutritional guidelines of Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO), World Health Organization (WHO) suggest consumption of 30g of visible (vegetable oil or animal fat) and invisible (obtained from cereals, millets, pulses, vegetables etc.) fat per person per day.One gram of vegetable oils provides 9 kcal (kilocalories) energy compared to 4 kcal energy obtained from one gram of cereals or legumes.These fats are also carriers of fat soluble vitamins such as A, D, E and K to various parts of the body. These vegetable oils are also primary sources of antioxidants (tocopherols) and phytosterol and suppliers of several minerals such as calcium, magnesium, potassium.Soybean, rapeseed-mustard, groundnut, sunflower, sesame/til, safflower and niger crops are the primary sources of edible oils. Oil extracted from rice bran, corn or maize, cottonseed and from several tree borne oilseed (TBO) crops such as coconut, palm and olive is also used for edible purposes, directly or after blending with traditional edible oils.What are the quality parameters of edible oils?Quality of any oil is determined by its fatty acid composition, which differs from oil to oil. There are three types of fatty acids in any oil including saturated fatty acids (SFAs), mono-unsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs).The PUFAs are also known as essential fatty acids. The proportion of SFAs in plant-derived oils is generally low, except in coconut oil and palm oil. Higher consumption of SFAs is known to increase low density lipoprotein (LDL), bad cholesterol, which is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular diseases.WHO recommends that the total consumption of saturated fats should be less than 10 per cent of total energy intake. The MUFA acts as a cholesterol scavenger and generates high density lipoprotein (HDL/good cholesterol). The PUFAs are known to reduce blood cholesterol, especially the harmful LDL and elevate HDL, which plays a role in transporting excess blood cholesterol back to the liver for degradation and excretion.Vegetable oils are the main source of PUFAs such as omega 6 and omega 3. However, an oil rich in PUFAs is unstable at very high temperature and gets converted into trans fats and therefore is not recommended for cooking or frying. The intake of trans-fats should not be more than 1 per cent of total energy intake. Generally speaking, however, good quality oil should be taken in moderation only.What is the ideal edible oil?An ideal cooking oil is one that contains healthy fats and nutrients, and does not break down on heating.Which oil meets this quality?Among various sources of vegetable oils, rapeseed-mustard oil is used mainly for cooking and frying as it meets most of the characteristics sought in dietary fats and oils. It has a high smoke point (240-250 degrees celcius), is low in saturated fatty acids (less than 10 per cent) and contains a relatively balanced proportion of essential fatty acids such as omega 6 and omega 3.This is in contrast to very high levels of saturated fatty acids in coconut (91 per cent), palm (51 per cent) oils, groundnut, soybean, corn and cottonseed oils (15 per cent). Rapeseed-mustard oil contains about 20-35 per cent PUFAs which are higher than those present in olive, coconut, palm or corn oils (usually 10 per cent or less). Sesame, niger, soybean, sunflower, safflower, corn and cottonseed oils contain 45-70 per cent PUFA. Rapeseed-mustard oil has a better ratio of Omega 3 to Omega 6 (1:2) as compared to soybean oil (1:8).A balanced proportion of omega 6 to Omega 3 is effective in reducing the risk of heart diseases. Rapeseed-mustard oil is also a rich source of plant sterols and vitamin E, which protects the body from cardiovascular diseases and contains higher levels of plant sterols and Vitamin E than soybean, and corn oil. It contains higher plant sterols than sunflowers, which are rich sources of Vitamin E.Meanwhile, rapeseed-mustard is a group of crops which includes Indian mustard/raya/laha, Indian rapeseed/toria, yellow sarson, brown sarson, oilseed rape/gobhi sarson and Ethiopian mustard/African sarson and taramira which are used as edible oil. Black mustard/Banarasi rai (mainly used as condiment in preparation of pickles etc.) and cauliflower/cabbage/broccoli are also members of the rapeseed-mustard family.Is rapeseed-mustard oil the best for consumption then?Not really, because rapeseed-mustard oil derived from conventional (traditional) varieties contains a high proportion (40-50 per cent) of erucic fatty acid (monounsaturated fatty acids) and low proportion of omega 9. Regular consumption of oil with more than 20 per cent erucic acid in the diet can cause thickening of arteries, which may lead to diseases like myocardial fibrosis in adults and lipidosis in children.Can erucic acid be reduced from rapeseed-mustard oil?Need to lower harmful erucic acid in oil has led to the development of low erucic acid varieties in rapeseed-mustard crops. Rapeseed-mustard varieties with low erucic (less than 2 per cent) or zero erucic have been termed as canola varieties.The term canola, which literally means Canadian oil, low acid was coined in Canada by the Western Canadian Oilseeds Crushers Association, where the first such variety was developed.Decrease in erucic acid in canola oil is also associated with corresponding increase in nutritionally desirable MUFA. Canola rapeseed-mustard oil contains higher levels (upto 67 per cent) of Omega 9 than conventional rapeseed-mustard.Other commonly used edible oils as olive oil contain (about 70-75 per cent) Omega 9, groundnut (50 per cent), rice bran, corn, cottonseed, palm, safflower, soybean, sesame and sunflower (less than 50 per cent), coconut oil (8 per cent). Canola oil makes it even better than olive oil which although contains highest proportion of omega 9 but also has higher amounts of SFAs (15 per cent) and much lower Omega-6 (8-10 per cent) and negligible amount of Omega -3 (1-3 per cent) as compared to canola oil which contains 7-8 per cent, 18-22, 8-12, respectively.Oils from groundnut, soybean, corn, sunflower, sesame, niger and safflower contain higher proportion (32-75 per cent) of omega 6, but higher proportion of PUFA makes the oil unstable at higher temperatures and potentially more prone to the production of trans-fats.Going by all these comparable qualities with other oils, Canola rapeseed-mustard oil is now a preferred cooking oil and is the most soughtafter across the world. Nutrition studies have shown that the unique fatty acid profile of canola helps mitigate factors associated with coronary heart disease including high blood cholesterol and thrombosis.In advanced countries including the USA, Canada, Europe, Japan, Australia, New Zealand etc., rapeseed-mustard conforming to canola norms can only be used as edible oil and oil from non-canola varieties is used for energy production (biofuel) or industrial purposes. They do not allow consumption of rapeseed-mustard oil with more than 2 per cent erucic acid.Canola quality rapeseed-mustard cultivars make the meal much safer for dairy animals and poultry where it is used as a preferred source of protein.What is the status of canola cultivation in India?Canola varieties are being grown in various parts of the country. In Punjab, farmers are by and large cultivating only canola quality rapeseed-mustard (mainly gobhi sarson). Canola varieties are also being grown in Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Rajasthan. But traditional varieties are also grown in large areas.PAU has developed and released three varieties  GSC 5 (2004), GSC 6 (2007) and GSC 7 (2014) and one hybrid PGSH 1707 (2020)  of canola quality (double low) gobhi sarson for commercial cultivation. PAU also released a canola variety RLC 3 (2015) and a hybrid RCH 1 (2019) of canola raya. Besides these, one hybrid of canola gobhi sarson developed by a private sector company has also been recommended for cultivation in the state.The ICAR  Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI), New Delhi, has also developed one canola quality variety PDZ 1 of raya (2015).In the past PAU and ICAR IARI have also developed a number of low erucic acid varieties of raya namely RLC 1 and RLC 2 (by PAU) and Pusa Krishma, Pusa Mustard 21, Pusa Mustard 22, Pusa Mustard 24, Pusa Mustard 28, Pusa Mustard 29, Pusa Mustard 30 and Pusa Mustard 32 (by ICAR IARI). Cultivation of these varieties is becoming popular in different mustard growing areas of the country.","‘Ban on blending of mustard oil will benefit farmers, lead to more production of healthier alternative’",MUSTARD OIL
2021-07-04,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/the-as-light-as-air-souffl/article35130887.ece,"The perfect souffl is a work of art, involving a judicial balance between air and moisture, using a bain-marie, pre-chilling the mixture, and so onThe origin story of my souffl-making is now lost in the mists of time. However, I will admit that it had a lot to do with the fact that, after a string of epic fails with everyday lunches, I turned to baking under the impression that baked dinners would make for at least one decent meal per day.I do remember that my first attempt turned out fairly well, and souffl philistines that my husband and I were, how much it rose was the exact amount of rise we expected, and since we loved eggs, this was a light and satisfying dinner. Soon it became cheese souffl for dinner one night every week.My souffl-making started in the pre-Internet days, so my go-to recipe was one culled from a 1966 issue of my grandmothers stash of Woman & Home. I read the recipe, more than a bit surprised at how easy it seemed. Apparently, all one needed was some white flour, butter, eggs, cheese and milk... and some wrist game to beat the eggs to frothy perfection. In 1966, apparently manual exertion was what made for light-as-air souffls. In time, the kid was an enthusiastic, if slightly ineffectual, egg-beater when she was home for the holidays. Later on in life, the husband eschewed the egg-beater in order to go at the mixture manually, with delicious results.Flavours galoreNecessity being the mother of invention and all that, I soon turned to my masala shelves to desify the flavour of my souffl. Voila! A touch of cracked pepper, a pinch of chilli powder, finely minced garlic, all wonderfully amplified the basic flavour.As time went by, I grew more daring in my experiments. Id grate onion and add it to the mix. Paprika and mustard became regular features, as did julienned mushrooms, bits of salmon, ham, bacon. Once in a while, though, Id overplay my hand. Like the time I diced coloured bell peppers, cauliflower and cooked potatoes, and put it into the souffl. Or the time I sliced sausage bits into it; another time I slid sliced sweet potato bits into the mix. These souffls rose but not too high, were definitely not light as air, and though the end result was delectable, any old-fashioned professional chef, fictional or real, from Bertie Woosters aunt Dahlias cook Anatole to Auguste Escoffier would have immediately castigated me for passing off a Spanish omelette as a souffl.Just eggs and cheeseThen there are individuals and establishments aplenty who make fruit souffls but that offends the purist in me. If a souffl doesnt have eggs and cheese in it, it simply is not a souffl, so say I. As for souffls made with coffee liqueurs, chocolate or Grand Marnier, lets call them by their right names, shall we? They are custards. Or mousses.Reading up on this dish, I found that the perfect souffl was a work of art, involving a judicial balance between air and moisture, using a bain-marie, pre-chilling the mixture, and so on. I also gleaned several useful facts. That a souffl rose to wonderful heights only if it involved the use of many eggs and was a smoother than silk mixture. That a spoonful of cream along with the milk made for an uber-binder. That it was best eaten hot, not after it had fallen in on itself and become some sort of an egg casserole; this collapse is often because the dish is baked to a dry consistency, so a jiggle test comes in handy here. That a few cheeses did nothing for the dish, being stringy or bland, while most others gave it a sublime flavour. That the external browning did not always correspond to a fully cooked interior. That all your efforts will come to naught if you dont have a ceramic souffl dish or ramekin with sides high enough to encourage the souffl to reach for the sky. That there shouldnt be even a smidgen of yolk in the egg white mix. That the egg whites have to be beaten to a just-so consistency: not too wet, not too stiff. That all your efforts will (again) come to naught if you open the oven door while the souffl is baking inside.Better versionSome years ago, a group of us dined at Le Voltaire restaurant on the Left Bank in Paris. I ordered an onion soup (another dish which I make often at home) and a cheese souffl. Behaving rather typically, our group was soon tasting each others food. The French onion soup was far better than my version. The souffl was excellent, literally melting in the mouth, the cheese leaving a lingering aftertaste.Everyone had a forkful of the souffl. Then everyone turned to me as one and said, I dont know what it is but I much prefer your souffls. More chatpata.It was hard not to feel smug, that much I will tell you.SUNDAY RECIPECheese souffl(from the cult cookbook Larousse Gastronomique)Ingredients40 gms butter, plus extra for greasing 40 gms flour2 decilitres or 1 cup cold milk4-5 large eggs75-90 gms cup finely grated Gruyere cheese60 gms finely grated Parmesan cheesePinch of saltPepperGrated nutmegMethod1.

2021-07-17,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/the-rasam-that-heals/article35357401.ece,"Mothers rasam had none of the usual ingredients and looked yellow. It tasted different too. The fever was soon gone but not the shock I felt on learning its secret ingredient  Memories of childhood are intrinsically linked with food for most of us. Just a whiff or a mere mention of a favourite dish can transport us to a bygone place and time. One such dish that holds sway over me is the humble yet potent rasam.  The soup-like broth with the tanginess of tamarind, tartness of tomato, sweetness of jaggery and wholesomeness of dal, along with the spice hit from homemade rasam powder, is always a winner. Though there are variations aplenty  with or without garlic, with lemon, and so on  my favourite has always been my mothers heady, red-hued broth. So, imagine my surprise when, one day, I was offered rasam like I had never known it before  without tomato, tamarind or even rasam powder, and it looked yellow.  I still remember that day vividly. I must have been around 10 years old, and was feeling a bit under the weather. My mother brought me the yellow concoction as a home remedy. I was flustered and took a tentative sip. While it tasted nothing like the usual rasam, I took an instant liking to it. I was, however, quite taken aback to learn that one of its ingredients was milk!  Family tradition  Mother explained that this rasam was called menasina saaru, and that it was something she had seen her mother and grandmother make several times. It was extolled for its medicinal benefits and was much sought after whenever family members suffered from a fever, cough or cold. Since it contains pepper, known for its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, menasina saaru calms the body, my mother said. And sure enough, my fever quickly subsided that day, I recall.  As life moved on and over-the-counter drugs took the place of everyday home cures, we forgot about menasina saaru. However, when my sister had her first child, it made an appearance again. It is excellent for postnatal mothers, said my mother, helping to keep the body warm. It was also a great way to increase immunity, she said, with the benefits being passed on from the breastfeeding mother to her newborn.

While it has many ingredients that are great for holistic wellness, what drew me to the dish was its simplicity and lack of fuss  no fancy ingredients thatll make you run to your supermarket (or your smartphone). After all, now was the time to go back to the basics.  And so, I learnt the recipe from my mother and happily made it from scratch. The fact that it was well-received by all at home was an added bonus. The Indian kitchen has so many secrets waiting to be rediscovered that I feel like I have only begun scratching at the surface. More importantly, my experience reiterates that mother, and grandmother, are always right.

From a little kitchen at Chennais Alliance Franaise, blanketed in the scent of vanilla, he whipped together light, fluffy cakes the old fashioned way: with butter, flour and muscle power.  When the pandemic hit in March 2020, and business abruptly stalled, he found himself at home for the first time in decades, with nothing to do. Then, the taciturn baker, who had exchanged nothing more than nods with many students over two decades, suddenly found  to his surprise  that he was a local legend. His number circulated on Whatsapp, and the orders began again. This time, he is baking from home in Royapettah.  My cooking was never really commercial, as there were a small group of regulars: students, as well as the actors who came to Alliance for rehearsals, he says, adding with a chuckle that most of them were fuelled by his signature lemon tea. That used to be my biggest selling point. People are still messaging me to order it.  When he began to run the canteen, Yousuf says he taught himself to cook. It was all survival instincts. I was working with McRennett, and I took a gamble to run my own show. To sustain business, I kept learning new recipes from everywhere.  His menu is short but includes his greatest cafe hits: dark chocolate cake, quiches with buttery pastry bases and spicy chicken cutlets. He also makes family style servings of creamy butter chicken, pepper mutton and an old school Chennai style biryani, if you want something more substantial.  Everything is made by me, from scratch, with no short cuts, says Yousuf, adding that he focusses on quality ingredients and precise techniques to maximise flavour. Business is unpredictable, so he is quick to adapt. Suddenly someone will share my number on Facebook or a Whatsapp group, and I will get a rush of orders, he says. Then, some weeks are quiet. But thats OK. I was 21 when I joined Alliance, and now I am 45. The students treated me like family, and it is nice to be able to still cook for them.  Message Yousuf on 9840082252 to order  Ranna Mashis kitchen  Mutton curry is an unexpected addition to the parasailing, rappelling, camping and scuba-diving offerings of Adventure Zone. Unexpected, but very welcome.  The sprawling property and campsite, popular for corporate training programmes and city getaways, recently started offering a comforting, typically Bengali Sunday lunch.  In a refreshing no frill format, instead of expending energy on a gush of Instagram reels and influencers, this Sunday popup is expanding slowly, the old-fashioned way. For the past four weeks, they have been cooking first for friends, then as word spread, for friends of friends, slowly expanding their reach.  Major SR Roy, who runs Adventure Zone, says he chose to launch Ranna Mashis to showcase the skills of his talented Bengali cook. He used to run a fast food restaurant in Kolkata, serving kati rolls, chops, chicken curry and that typical Bengali biryani, says Major Roy, adding that they source ingredients, from the mustard oil to the spices, from Kolkata to ensure an authenticity of flavour.  Adventure Zone has always had a kitchen, with cosmopolitan food, says Major Roy, adding, We curate it from an activity point of view, keeping it light since people are outdoors rappelling, diving, canoeing etc.  Once COVID-19 struck, the venue fell silent. Over night we went from catering to 650 visitors to absolutely 0, says Major Roy. As restrictions ease, though locals are beginning to trickle back in, he decided it was time to find ways to get busy again.  I have a kitchen. I have the infrastructure. And very good Bengali food, he says. The menu is succinct and simple, with big, homely flavours, tasting like lunch from an aunts house. There is fish, usually a river fish like Catla, and chicken or mutton curry. The typically Bengali vegetarian accompaniments include crisp slivers of fried potatoes, ridge gourd in a rich poppy seed gravy and yellow dal. Orders close on Friday evening, giving the kitchen time to get organised.  For now, they do just one meal a week. Many of our customers now order our Sunday lunch every week, chuckles Major Roy. Then, they can just close down their home kitchens and relax.

Really? she exclaimed, Ordinary poita bhat?  The Melbourne-born chef of Bangladeshi origin, Kishwar Chowdhury, may not have won the recently concluded MasterChef Australia contest, but by wowing the judges with her panta bhat, she has brought into the limelight a humble dish thats consumed in several parts of India and is called by as many names. For Bengalis, its panta bhat, for Odiyas, pakhala bhat, for Malayalis, vella choru or pazham kanji, for Tamils, pazhaya soru. Chowdhury gave her own twist to this dish, presenting it as Smoked Rice Water.  But in each of its versions, the essence of the dish remains the same: leftover rice, fermented overnight in water. Its versatility lies in the way it can take on a range of accompaniments or stand on its own.  Ideal for summer  My first introduction to this dish was at the age of 10 or 11 on a hot and humid summer day. As I waited for my parents to pick me up from school, my best friend invited me for a quick snack at her home, a stones throw away. No harm, I thought and followed her. We took off our shoes at the door and as she ran in to call her mom, I noticed her grandmother slurping what looked like watery gruel from a bowl. There it was, poita bhat.  Curious, I asked my friend if we could have some of that. And I can never forget that taste. With a dash of mustard oil and lime juice, it was one of the best summer meals I have ever had. We gorged on the accompaniments too  aloo pitika (mashed potato) and bengena bhoja (eggplant fritters), which are popular side dishes served with poita bhat in Assam  and slurped our way to the end.  The next time I relished it as much was years later, when I was on an assignment in Odisha. A field worker invited me to an impromptu lunch and as we sat down to feast on an array of dishes, he pulled out a bowl of what looked like poita bhat. Pakhala bhat, he said, In the hot summer months, this is my staple meal. Needless to say, he had to forego much of his pakhala bhat as I slurped it up with green chillies, onion and lime.  Health food  Light on the stomach, cooling and nutritious, poita bhats origins are as simple as the dish. In most States where rice is a staple, soaking the leftover portion in water overnight and consuming it the next morning made sense at a time when refrigerators were not common. This ensured there was no wastage. Left to ferment overnight, the gruelly rice has a high starch content, which sustained farmers and manual labourers for a long period of time after they ate it for breakfast. As we know today, its high Vitamin B12 and probiotic content makes it good for health. Poita bhat was also easy to prepare, standing ready even before the kitchen fire was started for the days meals.

I didnt like eating dosa, idli or upma, but vella choru with curd I loved. Sangya, my Odia friend, who now lives in Delhi, says she still eats pakhala bhat every once in a while. She shared a picture of her Amsterdam-based friends lunch the other day. On the table was a plate of colourful veggies and fritters, nestling close to a bowl of pakhala bhat.  RECIPE  Poita bhat  Ingredients  1 cup of cooked rice soaked in  2 cups of water overnight   cup buttermilk or  cup curd  2 tbsp onion, chopped  2 green chillies, chopped  Salt to taste  Method  Let the cooked rice ferment in water overnight.  Next morning, pour the rice gruel in a bowl and add the buttermilk or curd. Mix well.  Add the chopped onion, chopped chillies and salt.  A dash of mustard oil and a wedge of lemon, and your poita bhat is ready to be served.

2021-08-27,https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/vegetable-oils-november-october-solvent-extractors-association-of-india-7474562/,"India produced 93.18 lakh tonnes (lt) of vegetable oils in 2020-21 (November-October), as against 85.38 lt and 76.87 lt in the previous two years. But despite this record output, as estimated by the Solvent Extractors Association of India, the country will end up importing some 133 lt, from the 155.49 lt of the 2018-19 oil year. Simply put, India imports anywhere from nearly 60 per cent to over two-thirds of its vegetable oil requirement, depending on how good the rains are, entailing an annual foreign exchange outgo of $10-11 billion. It is in this context that one must view the Narendra Modi governments new National Mission on Edible Oils-Oil Palm. The scheme aims at increasing the total area under oil palm from the current 3.5 lakh hectares (lh) to 10 lh by 2025-26. Growers would be entitled to a minimum viability price for their fresh fruit bunches (FFB) production, which is 14.3 per cent of the last five-year-average crude palm oil (CPO) price adjusted for wholesale inflation.  The focus on oil palm is not misplaced as it is a crop that can yield 20-25 tonnes of FFBs per hectare, translating into 4-5 tonnes of CPO. No other oilseed can give so much: Mustard and groundnut yields arent more than 2-3 tonne per hectare and the oil recovery from that only at 35-40 per cent. No realistic plan of reducing import dependence in edible oils  to, say, 30-40 per cent from the existing 60-70 per cent  is possible without recognising the role of oil palm. Out of Indias annual 130-150 lt vegetable oil imports, 80-90 mt is accounted for by palm oil alone.  That said, there are valid concerns over introducing oil palm in tropical rainforests or biodiversity-rich areas such as the Andaman & Nicobar Islands and the Northeast. The crop is probably better suited for states such as Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Odisha, where it can replace paddy and be grown using drip irrigation, mulching and other water-saving practices. India is anyway producing too much rice and any diversification must be welcomed. But the focus should, for now, be on states already cultivating oil palm. Farmers there have had a mixed experience with the crop that takes at least five years to grow and start yielding 20-25 tonnes of FFB/hectare. An assured viability price, protecting against fluctuations in global edible oil markets, should instil confidence among farmers in these states. Let them expand acreages first before others in more ecologically fragile regions.

In a statement Sunday, the Union Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution said: The Department in a landmark decision has imposed stock limits on Edible Oils and Oilseeds for a period upto 31st March, 2022.  The Centres decision will soften the prices of edible oils in the domestic market, thereby bringing great relief to consumers across the country, it said.  The move comes at a time when edible oil prices are hovering at record levels.

The ministry said the high prices of edible oil in the international market have a substantial impact on the domestic prices. The government has formulated a multi-pronged strategy to ensure that the prices of essential commodities like edible oils remain controlled, it highlighted.  The Removal of Licensing Requirements, Stock Limits and Movement Restrictions on Specified Foodstuffs (Amendment) Order, 2021 has been issued with immediate effect i.e. from 8th September, 2021. Future trading on Mustard Oil and Oilseeds was suspended in NCDEX w. e. f October 08, 2021, it said.

2021-10-21,https://indianexpress.com/article/india/govt-sets-up-war-room-on-movement-of-fertilisers-7584041/,"On October 17, three railway rakes carrying di-ammonium phosphate (DAP) were dispatched from Gujarats Mundra, Pipavav, and Kandla ports to Kanakpura, a station in Rajasthan catering to the mustard-growing areas of Jaipur, Tonk, Ajmer, and Sawai Madhopur districts. The permission for moving these rakes, the first two of 2,600 tonnes each and the third of 4,000 tonnes, was secured on an out of turn basis  that too, on a Sunday.  This level of minute planning and prioritisation of fertiliser movement by the Centre is happening for the first time, in response to an unprecedented shortage situation, both domestic and globally. As The Indian Express had reported, all-India stocks of DAP and muriate of potash on September 30 were less than half of a year-ago levels, even as international prices of fertilisers and inputs have surged to their highest since 2008-09.  We were earlier simply sending material based on the month-wise requirements for the season given to us by the states. (Rabi plantings start from October.) But now, we are finding out district-wise requirements and the crops where sowing is taking place. The field demand thus assessed is then sought to be addressed by mobilising rakes to those locations, said a senior official of the Department of Fertilisers (DOF).  On the ground, this means mustard and potato, which are planted in October, taking precedence over wheat. Thus, more rakes are being moved to Rajasthan and railheads such as Rewari, Khori, and Jhajjar in Haryanas mustard belt. In Uttar Pradesh too, the allocations at present are mainly to Aligarh, Mathura, Agra, Mainpuri, Etawah, Farrukhabad, Kanpur, and other rake points near the states potato- and mustard-growing tracts.  The rakes to Kanakpura were listed low in the seniority of indents. But after anticipating heavy demand from East Rajasthans mustard farmers, we sought special permission to allow them to jump the queue, the official said. The DOF is currently operating a 24/7 war room in close coordination with the Railway Board, fertiliser companies, and state agriculture departments.  The official claimed that the estimated 18.08 lakh tonnes (lt) DAP demand this month, mostly for mustard and potato, has already been met through opening stocks of 15 lt and production of 3 lt. In addition, companies have contracted about 6 lt imports, with 4.5 lt out of this reaching the ports, and 1 lt moved to consumption centres. Thus, there is no macro shortage, although the 15 lt stocks with the trade may not all be in places where DAP is immediately required.  Also Read | Fertiliser sales down on erratic monsoon rains  The DOF has assessed the DAP requirement at 17.13 lt in November, 9.48 lt in December, 5.46 lt in January, 4.06 lt in February, and 4.47 lt in March, adding up to 58.71 lt for the season. The same for complex fertilisers (containing combinations of nitrogen, phosphorous, potash and sulphur) has, likewise, been placed at 12.86 lt in October, 12.26 lt in November, 11.09 lt in December, 9.93 lt in January, 7.86 lt in February, and 6.84 lt in March, totalling 60.86 lt.  We were till October 15 moving an average of 50 rakes daily, which has since increased to 55 (30 of DAP/complexes and 25 urea). This will further go up to 60 by October-end. That is when wheat sowings would also start in Punjab, Haryana, and Madhya Pradesh, while only after mid-November in UP, the official added.  He denied that Punjab was facing a shortage of DAP: They have 1.2 lt stocks lying with retailers now. Their requirement for potato (largely grown in Jalandhar, Kapurthala, and Hoshiarpur) was already delivered in late September to early October. We have so far this month moved 35 rakes of DAP/complexes (roughly 1.5 lt) to the state and will do another 15 (45,000 tonnes) within the next one week. All this is for wheat.  Farmers apply DAP, containing 46 per cent phosphorous necessary for root establishment and growth, at the time of sowing. Urea, the most-widely consumed fertiliser having 46 per cent nitrogen content, is generally given first around three weeks after sowing when the crop is in vegetative and tillering stages.  India has some 2.8 lakh fertiliser dealers receiving supplies from 45-odd plants and 21 ports. Around 80 per cent of the material is moved by rail to 940 rake points covering an average distance of 750 km. Never before has this logistics system  reaching adequate quantities of fertiliser at the required place and time  been tested as it is being done currently.

The government has also asked states to ensure that stakeholders do not hold stock beyond two months of their capacity.  In a letter, the Department of Food and Public Distribution said, Demand and consumption of edible oil is different for different States/UTs. However, for finalising stock limit quantity of edible oils and oilseeds, the State/UTs may consider/explore previous stock limit imposed for edible oils and oilseeds by the State/UTs. It may be considered that any stakeholder (refiner, miller, wholesaler, etc.) should not hold stock in excess [of] two months of capacity.  On October 8, the department had imposed stock limits on edible oils and oilseed up to March 31, 2022. The department had left it to states to decide the stock limit of edible oil and oilseed on the basis of available stock and consumption pattern of State/Union Territory, with a few exceptions.  Addressing the media on Friday, Food Secretary Sudhanshu Pandey said despite international commodity prices being high, interventions taken by the Centre and state governments proactive involvement have led to the cooling down of prices in India much more than the international market. Asked whether any state has imposed stock limits on edible oil or oilseed, he said, States are discussing with edible oil processors and traders, and we are hopeful stock limits will be imposed from next week onwards.  On October 22, all-India average retail price of groundnut oil was Rs 182.86/kg, mustard oil Rs 185.55/kg, vanaspati Rs 138.31/kg, soya oil Rs 154.91/kg, sunflower oil Rs 168.21/kg, and palm oil Rs 132.64/kg.  Explained: Govt move to cut prices  On October 14, government cut import duty on crude palm oil to 0%, with agri-cess of 7.5% till March 2022. Import duty on crude sunflower oil and crude soyabean oil was reduced to 0%, with agri-cess of 5% until next March. Import duty on refined palm oil, refined sunflower oil and refined soyabean oil was cut to 17.5% until March 2022.","To check edible oil prices, Centre suggests limit to states: no stocking beyond 2 months",MUSTARD OIL

At a Monday meeting called by the Department of Food and Public Distribution (DFPD), chaired by Joint Secretary Partha S Das, states and Union Territories were informed that the stock limit of edible oil has to be notified by each state or UT based on their consumption pattern.  The meeting came even as the prices of edible oils continue to remain high. On October 25, the All-India average retail price of groundnut oil was at Rs 181.71 per kg, of mustard oil was Rs 185.33 per kg, of vanaspati was Rs 139.21 per kg, of soya oil was Rs 154.85 per kg, of sunflower oil was Rs 168.57 per kg and of palm oil was Rs 133.17 per kg.

2021-11-03,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/eating-out-in-delhi/article37299507.ece,"Despite the challenges of the ongoing pandemic, a surge of feisty restaurants have launched, drawing on memories of the past and summer holidays to create alluring dining spaces  The Tangra Project  Chef Vikramjit Roys face beams like the Qutab Minar on a moonlit night, or, in his case, the Victoria Memorial. He has just launched The Tangra Project, his first own restaurant, after two decades in the industry, along with business partners Vir Kotak and Anurodh Samal. The three had started Context.Eat, the parent company, earlier last year.  Located in Delhis DLF Avenue, this barely two-month-old restaurant is an ode to Kolkata, the city where Vikramjit was born and spent his formative years. Right from the second hand book shops on College Street to the river Hooghly, everything finds a representation in the restaurant, either is the form of decor or dish. This includes marble pillars that resemble stacks of books, a giant mural of a vibrant fish that finds itself sprawled across three walls, and lights on the ceiling which are reminiscent of the toony bulbs that are strung during pujas and festivals.  Working on this project brought to life a gamut of memories for Vikramjit. As we bite into a deliciously creamy haleem on toast, he recalls how he used to catch the 1 pm show with his friends at the erstwhile Chaplin Theatre, and then wait outside for a specific vendor who sold haleem. That is what he recreated.  The kosha mangsho and kochuri are what his Sundays were made up of; he would go to the butcher with his father and get the best pieces to make this household favourite. At this restaurant, Vikram has obediently followed his mothers recipe for the kosha mangsho. She came here and taught us how to prepare it and then followed it up with a video, he laughs.  The menu is a rolodex of Kolkatas iconic dishes: Chinese, Anglo Indian, Mughlai and of course Bengali. Here youll find bhetki fish wrapped with the sharp flavours of kasundi, kanch kola kofta (dumplings made of raw plantain), cholar dal, Tangra style chilli chicken and chicken cutlets so crisp that when you bite in, you hear a satisfying crunch (#ASMR). The breadcrumbs  in which the cutlets are coated  are sourced from Kolkata, as are the other raw ingredients.  Then there are the recipes that took shape in Vikrams head before finding themselves plated on elegant crockery. These include parwal guacamole: pointed gourd being cooked for 18 hours and then made into a fine paste, featuring bits of tomato and pomegranate, shining like bright jewels on a bed of green. Or spinach, roasted poppy seed in sesame sauce, a simple yet delightful combination. If you are in the mood to experiment, the menu also offers a mustard and tender coconut mousse.  The menu, Vikram says, will keep changing according to each season. Hardly a challenge, given they had to bring down the number of entries from 500 to 200.  The Tangra Project Unit No. 154-159 Commons, DLF Avenue, Saket. Call: 8929925253  Colocal  Theres a slice of Pondicherry in the trendy Dhan Mill compound in Chattarpur.  With its sunshine yellow facade  dappled with pink bougainvillea  French style doors and courtyard bordered with white pillars, this chocolate factory and cafe mirrors the laidback charm of the former French colony. Colocal is a passion project of Sheetal Saxena and her husband Nishant Sinha. For Sheetal, a chocolate aficionado, the idea to start a bean to bar brand came to her while she was watching videos of cacao being roasted. Curiosity led her to research more on the subject and thus Colocal was born.  They are currently doing dark chocolate: 55, 66, 72 and 85%. The eventual goal is to reach 95%, says Nishant who also owns the Roastery Coffee House in Hyderabad and Kolkata. There are bonbons and truffles, and the chocolates are also blended with sea salt, nuts, caramel among others.  Also Read | Roastery Coffee House, Hyderabad review  Colocals cacao beans are sourced from Idukki in Kerala. We roast our cacao in a proper coffee roaster and that gives our chocolate a different taste, explains Nishant. He says that often there are many myths associated with chocolate. People think chocolate is sugar. Through these tours of our boutique chocolate factory we are able to show them that it is actually derived from a fruit. They can see the process right from roasting, conching to melanging, he adds.

Fluffy white marshmallows, also made in-house, are just as decadent. The plan is to make quality couverture chocolate and break the international dominance that is there in the market, says Nishant, adding, We want to showcase Indian cacao to the world.

Apparently, that is the best way to enjoy the innovative bite-sized small plates that this trendy bistro by day and gastro by night is known for.  The bistro offers sushi, galouti kebab, golgappa with pomello, dimsums (in stunning red and purple hues, using natural colour from beetroot and purple cabbage) and more. The idea here is to try an array of cuisines rather than commit to one large main course for the entire evening.  There are large plates too. The massaman curry, for instance, where the meat is cooked for 24 hours in a sous vide machine. The food represents the chefs culinary journey across London, Dubai, Maldives and Phuket, among others. The menu also lists favourites from closer home, like appams, chicken Chettinad and cone dosa.  Owned by Gurmehar, Navdeep Singh Sethi and Alekh Vardhan, Klap was born in April, but had to temporarily shut down due to the second wave of the pandemic, before reopening in June. Spread over two floors, it has a terrace offering open air dining. The terrace also has the Chefs garden that grows basil, birds eye chilli, ajwain (carom), coriander, ginger flower, lemongrass, and microgreens such as amaranth, says Gurmehar, adding that he believes in sustainability.  To that end, cucumber and tomato peels are dehydrated and served with a dash of pink salt and paprika, as nibbles at the bar. Stems of broccoli and leftovers of onion are frozen in blocks of ice, which double up as slabs on which sushi, sashimi, and nigiri are served.

2021-11-05,https://indianexpress.com/article/india/prices-edible-oils-down-rs-5-20-per-kg-food-secy-7609386/,"Prices of edible oils in major markets of the country have seen a decline of Rs 5-20 per kg following various steps taken by the Centre, including an import duty reduction, Union Food Secretary Sudhansu Pandey said Friday.  He said branded oil makers have also revised the rates for new stock.  Prices of edible oils in domestic markets have soared in tandem with global prices  which shot up due to reduced availability following diversion for biofuel in Indonesia, Brazil and other countries.  The government has taken a number of steps to ensure consumers get relief from high prices. We are happy to share the trend from 167 centres. Edible oil prices have declined quite significantly in the range of Rs 5 and 20 per kg in the major retail markets across the country, Pandey told reporters here.  Retail palm oil price in Delhi declined by Rs 5 to Rs 133 per kg on November 3, while it fell by Rs 18 to Rs 122 per kg in Aligarh, Uttar Pradesh, by Rs 7 to Rs 125 per kg in Cuddalore, Tamil Nadu in the said period, he said.  The government monitors retail prices of six edible oils from 167 centres across the country.  In the case of mustard oil, Pandey said, we have not seen a significant reduction in prices, but the steps taken by the government including import duty rationalisation will have an impact, Pandey said.  We are going to see a southward trend in mustard oil prices too, he said, adding that ongoing sowing of mustard seed is better than last year. The area sown to mustard seed, a rabi crop, is 11 per cent better than the year-ago period, he added.  He also said that he had spoken to industry stakeholders and that they also revised the prices for new stocks. In fact, industry body SEA has advised its distributions, retailers and wholesalers to pass import duty cut to consumers even on the old stock, Pandey said.  Major players in the industry, including Adani Wilmar and Ruchi industries, have cut wholesale prices by Rs 4 -7 per litres to give relief to consumers during the festival season, a government statement said.  The other players that have reduced the wholesale prices of edible oils are Gemini Edibles and Fats India, Hyderabad, Modi Naturals, Delhi, Gokul Re-foils and Solvent, Vijay Solvex, Gokul Agro Resources and N K Proteins, it added.  While the global edible oil prices have stabilised at higher levels in the last ten days, the reduction in import duty and other steps like imposition of stock limits to curb hoarding has helped cool down domestic prices, the secretary said. Pandey said the reduction in petrol and diesel rates will also have an overarching impact on local edible oil prices as distribution cost will reduce.",Prices of edible oils down by Rs 5-20 per kg across country: Food Secy,MUSTARD OIL
2021-11-06,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/edible-oil-prices-dip-in-some-centres-in-run-up-to-diwali/article37346415.ece,"No plan to extend PMGKAY beyond Nov. 30: Food Secretary  The prices of most major cooking oils dropped about 5-10 a litre in Delhi and as much as 20 in some other cities in the run-up to Diwali, Food Secretary Sudhanshu Pandey said on Friday, giving credit to the stabilisation of global prices as well as measures such as duty cuts and stock limits. However, the national average retail prices for cooking oils showed little change, and mustard oil, which is only produced domestically, continued to see rising prices.  International edible oil prices remain high, but have stabilised over the past week. Interventions by the Central Government along with the State Governments proactive involvement and the cut in wholesale prices by major private players have led to retail prices cooling down much more than the international market, Mr. Pandey told journalists.  Also read: Edible oil prices likely to ease by December: official  Apart from the cuts in duties and cesses, the Centre had used stock limits to help control prices of both edible oils and pulses this year, using the provisions of the Essential Commodities Act. The amendments to the Act, which were passed by Parliament last year but suspended by the Supreme Court in January due to opposition by farm unions, would not have allowed the imposition of stock limits given the current rate of price hikes.  COVID-19 a major factor  These are extraordinary times. These are not normal times. Global commodity prices are extremely high. COVID-19 is a major factor, disrupting supply chains, closing down industry. There is insufficient labour in the oil production industry in many countries. Given the extraordinary circumstances, it is right to invoke this, stated Mr. Pandey, explaining why the Government had chosen to use the same legal provisions it had sought to remove through last years amendments.  The retail prices of most major cooking oils were 35-45% higher than a year ago. However, a clear decline in prices was seen in Delhi from the beginning of the week till Diwali eve, with prices falling 5-10 a kg over the three-day period. Some smaller centres saw greater declines, such as the 18 a kg fall in palm oil in Aligarh and the 20 a kg fall in sunflower prices in Meghalaya. Nationally, the palm oil prices fell about 1.45 a kg, while soybean oil increased the same amount.  Mustard oil, which accounted for 11% of the domestic consumption basket, saw a 2.29 a kg increase in prices, although Mr. Pandey hoped that the 12-15% increase in mustard acreage this winter would cool down prices once the harvest comes in.  Free ration scheme  With regard to Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY), Mr. Pandey observed that there were no plans to extend the free ration scheme introduced as COVID-19 relief last year beyond November 30.  As the economy is also reviving and the OMSS [or open market sale scheme] is also exceptionally good, there is no proposal from the department for extension, he noted.  PMGKAY was rolled out in March 2020 as part of the first COVID-19 relief package, and has been extended twice since then. It provides five kg of free foodgrain a month to the 80 crore beneficiaries of the National Food Security Act, who are already eligible for subsidised grain.","Duty cuts, stock limits helped curtail edible oil prices: Govt.",MUSTARD OIL

In a statement, the grand old party said that the programme named as Jan Jagran Abhiyan is being held to protest the issue of price rise which has been worsened by unprecedented levels of unemployment and loss of jobs.  It also said the prices of mustard and other edible oils have doubled in the last one year, while seasonal vegetable prices have increased by 40-50 per cent in a month. The cost of subsidised LPG cylinder has gone up by 50 per cent to Rs 900-1,000 in the last one year. Similarly, petrol and diesel prices have gone up by Rs 34.38 and 24.38 to Rs 103.97 and Rs 86.67 per litre, respectively in the last 18 months, it added.  Further stating that the unemployment rate is at an all time high of 8-9 per cent, the party said 14 crore jobs were lost during the Covid-19 period alone.  Slamming the Centre, it said the Narendra Modi-led government has pushed 23 crore Indians below the poverty line, while the Congress-UPA pulled 27 crore Indians out from below the poverty line in its 10 years of governance.  Quoting the governments Periodic Labour Force Survey, the opposition party said the report has highlighted the pitiable conditions of farmers, who on an average, earn Rs 27 per day, which is even below the MGNREGA wage.  22 out of 36 states and UTs have run out of MGNREGA funds and an additional Rs 50 thousand crore of budgeted outlay is needed, which the Modi government is refusing to provide. All this is adding to the woes of the people, the statement said.  Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, in a tweet, said the BJP government has been running the public harassment campaign for so long, and now the Congress party will run the Jan Jagran Abhiyan and demand justice for the people of the country.  During the protest period, the party said, it will reach out to the maximum number of people across the country to strengthen the peoples voice against the unprecedented price rise in the CNG, cooking gas, diesel, petrol, cooking oil, pulses and other essential commodities.

The season however may spell trouble for people with heart disease as several studies suggest increase in cardiovascular events like heart attack, heart failure, arrhythmia during winter.  As the temperature drops, our body and heart have to work extra hard to maintain a healthy body temperature. This may strain our heart and increase risk of heart failure in people whose heart function is not up to the mark.  Why winter is problematic for heart patients  ""With fall in temperature, an alteration occurs in the physiology of the body to keep it warm. Low temperature tends to activate sympathetic nervous system and along with that it increases secretion of catecholamines. This in turn leads to constriction of blood vessel which thereby results in increase in heart rate, blood pressure, cholesterol levels and aggravates the blood clotting process. All these detrimental effects eventually increase the risk of heart attack,"" says Dr. Atul Mathur, Executive Director, Interventional Cardiology and Chief of Cath Lab - Fortis Escorts Heart Institute, Okhla, New Delhi.  ALSO READ: World Heart Day: Acute stress can lead to heart attack, says Dr Ashok Seth  ""Additionally, your heart has to work harder during winter to maintain a healthy body temperature. People who are already having heart problems, those who are having high blood pressures and heavy drinkers and smokers are at increased risk during cold weather,"" says Dr Charan Lanjewar, Interventional Cardiologist and Honorary Consultant at Global Hospital, Parel, Mumbai.  Other factors  Dr Mathur says there are other factors like air pollution, decrease in physical activities, emotional stress, poor dietary habits and increase incidence of viral infection during winter also that increases the risk of heart attacks and failure.  ""Those patients who suffer with poor heart function known as severe LV dysfunction are at much more higher risk in this season, because they have a tendency of fluid accumulation within the body that leads to difficulty in breathing,"" says Dr Mathur.  The season of respiratory illnesses  Winter months are also the time when various illnesses, such as the flu and pneumonia, strike. Respiratory illnesses in particular are a real stress on the heart, especially for older people. If you have pneumonia, your oxygen is low and you have to work harder to breathe, which increases heart rate. When youre sick like that, theres a lot of physiological stress, says Dr Lanjewar.  ""Various scientific studies done all over the world have shown an increased incidence of cardiovascular events during the winter season. This may be due to seasonal variations in the levels of vaso active peptides and well as physiological changes like increased cutaneous vasoconstriction. Hence patients with heart disease need to be extra careful during winter seasons,"" says Dr Naeem Hassanfatta, Consultant Cardiologist, Wockhradt Hospital.  How to keep your heart safe during winter  * Dr Mathur advises to wear warm woolen clothes, gloves, hat to keep body warm.  * Avoid excess alcohol consumption and smoking.  * Manage your stress: Engage in hobbies and physical activities like gardening or painting. Try yoga and meditation at home. Take proper sleep in night and regular breaks from work  * Regular exercise: Daily exercise for at least 30 minutes per day is important. Avoid exercising outside early in the morning in cold temperature. Opt for indoor exercises like static cycling, treadmill, yoga etc.  * Improve diet: Avoid excessive salt and sweets in your diet. Use polyunsaturated cooking oil like safflower oil, mustard oil. Increase salad and fruits in diet.  * Regular health checkup: Go for routine visit with your cardiologist and follow the advice.  * Last but not least, keep yourself positive and immediately visit to hospital in case of any emergency.  ""Patients need to make sure that they need to stick to their medication and exercise schedule. Also avoid the increased levels of pollution during winters. Heart failure patients need to be evaluated by their doctors before onset of winter to assess their fluid status,"" says Dr Hassanfatta.

The rabi crops are generally sown in two phases in the State, first in October-November and later in January-February.  Additional Chief Secretary (Energy) Subodh Agarwal instructed the public sector power discoms in Jaipur, Ajmer and Jodhpur on Wednesday to make an assessment of the potential demand in the rabi season based on the average demand during the corresponding period in the last three years. The three discoms were also asked to prepare their action plan within the next three days.  The present supply of electricity for agricultural power consumers is 10,528 MW against the demand for 11,297 MW, while the demand during the rabi season is likely to soar by 790 MW. The power demand during the peak hours at present has been calculated at 13,864 MW. Discom chairman Bhaskar A. Sawant said the average demand during December last year was 10,533 MW and a roadmap would be prepared for meeting the demand this year.  Will meet challenge  Farmers sow the rabi crops of wheat, barley, gram, mustard, taramira, masoor, pea, flaxseed, sunflower, potato and black mustard during the winter season in different parts of the State. Mr. Agarwal said the discoms, which had worked hard during the recent crisis caused by shortage of coal, would meet the challenge of power management for the agriculture sector.",Demand for power in rabi season set to soar in Rajasthan,MUSTARD OIL

(Representational/File)  THE SOLVENT and Extractors Association of India (SEA), the apex body of edible oil manufactures, importers and processors in the country, has requested the Centre for introduction of genetically modified oilseed crops in the country. In their pre-budget consultation with the Centre, the organisation also batted for shifting of grains to oilseeds in north India.  Currently, cotton is the only GM crop allowed for cultivation in the country. The introduction of other GM crops has been a long-standing demand from various farm bodies, but the government has not allowed field trials of any such crop.  Atul Chaturvedi, president of SEA, said that the per-acre yield of soyabean in the country is low at 800-1,000 tonnes per hectare. Whereas GM soyabean offers yield as high as 3-4 tonnes per hectare, he added.  Even if, the government continues increasing the Minimum Support Price (MSP) on a year-on-year basis, it will not translate into great gains for farmers. Technology would help in increasing farmers yields and thus increase their income, Chaturvedi said.  Opposition technology is not scientific as the country has been consuming cottonseed oil for some years now, the SEA president said. Also, the livestock industry has been using cotton seed cake as a protein supplement for years. Without better technology, India would not be able to be self-reliant in oil seeds ever, he said.  SEA has also asked for a diversion of the area under wheat cultivation in northern India for the cultivation of the mustard crop. This, would help in replenishing the water table and also help in the diversification of crops in the states of Punjab and Haryana.  Between Punjab and Haryana, around 60 lakh hectares of land is earmarked for wheat cultivation. Assuming we can shift 50 per cent of the available land for cultivating mustard in the next two to three years, through better incentives for shifting, the additionally available crop would be 60 lakh tonnes of mustard, which translates into an additional 25 lakh tonnes of additional oil, the body added.",Edible oil manufactures’ body seeks introduction of GM oilseed crops,MUSTARD OIL

2021-12-21,https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/chandigarh/haryana-vidhan-sabha-opposition-govt-fertilizer-dap-shortage-7684055/,"Members of the Opposition on Tuesday raked up the shortage of di-ammonium phosphate (DAP) and urea fertilizers across the state during the Haryana Assemblys Winter session, and claimed that the state government was threatening to upset the plans of farmers for sowing of Rabi crops.  On Tuesday, the issue was raised by several Congress MLAs, led by Kiran Choudhry and INLDs Abhay Chautala.  However, the state government assured the House that there was no shortage of either DAP or urea fertilizer and adequate stocks were available.  The Opposition questioned the BJP-JJP government and said that the state was denying any shortage but was failing to explain away why long queues of farmers were being seen lining up to purchase the fertilizers or why the fertilizers had to be distributed to farmers through police stations.  Congress MLAs Kiran Choudhary, Shispal Singh, Mamman Khan, Bishan Lal, Aftab Ahmed, Jagbir Singh Malik, Chiranjeevi Rao, Geeta Bhukkal, and INLDs lone MLA, Abhay Singh Chautala, had given Calling Attention notice and said that panic has gripped farmers across Haryana with a severe shortage of di-ammonium phosphate (DAP), urea and other fertilizers, which are basic nutrients for Rabi crops, threatening to upset their plans for sowing of Rabi crops, especially that of wheat and mustard.  The Opposition pointed out the long queues of farmers wanting to buy DAP outside the offices of primary agriculture cooperative societies and other dealers in several districts  including Charkhi Dadri, Mahendragarh, Nuh, Rewari, Karnal, Ambala, Kurukshetra, Bhiwani, and Hisar. They also claimed that while the DAP requirement for Rabi season in Haryana was estimated at around 3 lakh metric tons, the supply so far had been only around one-third of the demand. If there is no shortage of DAP then why was it distributed through police stations. The government is lying. The fact that raids were conducted clearly indicated that black marketing is being done, Congress MLA Jagbir Singh Malik said.  Leader of Opposition, Bhupinder Singh Hooda, too, questioned the government over the hardships that the farmers were facing over the alleged shortage of fertilizers.  However, Haryana agriculture minister JP Dalal, countered the allegations and said, Till now about 6.93 lakh metric tonnes (MT) of urea, 2.82 lakh metric tonnes of DAP, more than 1 lakh tonnes of SSP, more than 41,000 metric tonnes of NPK was available, out of which 6.24 lakh metric tonnes of urea, 2.60 lakh metric tonnes of DAP, 79,000 metric tonnes of SSP, 38,661 metric tonnes of NPK have been provided to the farmers in the state. In 22 districts, 61 complaints were received, 157 show cause notices were issued, 88 licences were suspended, and 20 FIRs were registered. Besides this, 1685 teams have conducted continuous raids to curb black marketing. The consumption of DAP in the last Rabi season was 2.58 Lakh MT whereas, during the current season a quantity of 2.57 Lakh MT has been made available up to December 15, 2021, to the farmers, which was at par with last years consumption. Further, other sources of phosphatic fertilizers  like SSP and NPK  were also made available in much more quantity than last year (SSP more than two times and NPK around 5 times). Thus consumption of total phosphatic fertilizer was 3.73 lakh metric tonnes up to December 15, 2021, against 3.01 Lakh MT in the last year during the same period. Similarly, the sale of urea fertilizer was 5.88 lakh metric tonne during last year, whereas, it is 5.74 lakh metric tonne during the current Rabi season which indicates that this year the supply to the farmers is almost the same. As of today, the state has a urea stock of 55828 MT, and additionally about 50,000 MT urea fertilizer is likely to arrive in the next 4 days. The Government of India has further announced to supply about 1,25,000 MT of urea by the end of this month.  Major Rabi crops have been sown with sufficient fertilizer as required at the time of sowing. In this Rabi season, the mustard crop has been sown in a 7.6 Lakh hectare area (about 19 lakh acres) against 6.1 Lakh hectare (about 15 Lakh acre) sown last year. Likewise, wheat has been sown in 22.9 lakh hectare area (about 57 Lakh acres) against 23.3 lakh hectares (about 58 lakh acres) sown last year. This clearly indicates that the sowing of wheat and mustard crops have not been hampered adversely due to the shortage of any fertilizer, Dalal added.  Referring to the long queues of farmers at several places, Dalal said, During the purchase of fertilizer at the sale point, the queues at few places were not because of shortage or non-supply of fertilizer rather it takes some time to update the data on PoS machine (Point of Sale machine). The system asks for Aadhaar Card and thumb impression. Government of India has started IFMS (Integrated Fertilizer Monitoring System) since 2018-19 which demands sale through PoS mandatory so that real-time sale and stock data can be captured at the national level, Dalal said.","Haryana Vidhan Sabha session: Opposition corners govt on fertilizer, DAP shortage; minister says enough stocks available",MUSTARD OIL

The ban will remain in force for a year.  Accordingly, traders will not be able to punch in any fresh futures trades on soyabean and mustard and their derivatives, crude palm oil (CPO), wheat, paddy (non-basmati ), chana and moong for one year from December 20. They will only be allowed to square off or reverse their existing positions. Sebi did not assign any reason for the suspension in its circular dated December 20.  A futures contract facilitates the purchase or sale of an underlying commodity for delivery at a later date.  NCDEX runs the countrys largest farm derivatives segment while energy and metals bourse MCX offers trading mainly on CPO as part of its much smaller agri bouquet. NCDEX will be the hardest hit by the ban as the soya complex accounted for 36% of its average daily turnover so far this fiscal year. MCX will witness only marginal impact.  Queries to NCDEX and MCX on the reasons for and impact of the ban went unanswered till press time.  Traders and an economist view the latest regulatory move as a measure to pre-empt inflationary expectations primarily in soyabean and CPO.  It looks like a proactive move to curb potential inflationary pressures in the soya complex and in CPO, said Naveen Mathur, director (commodities & currencies), Anand Rathi Share And Stock Brokers. Agreed Madan Sabnavis, chief economist, CareEdge Ratings. Growth in consumer prices of edible oils in November 21 remained high at 29.7% against 17.9% in the corresponding month of the previous year. Inflation of the other domestically produced items remains mostly under control. Given that chana and mustard were banned earlier, the (RBI and governments) point of concern seems to be edible oils.  Food and beverages have a 45.86% weight in the CPI, whose price growth has slowed to 4.9% this November from 6.9% in the same month last year. Analysts feel the government and regulators might not want to leave anything to chance in an environment where inflationary expectations could scuttle the recent recovery in an economy ravaged by the pandemic.

2021-12-23,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/explained-why-sebi-suspended-futures-trading-in-agri-products/article38003931.ece,"Objective is to rein in prices of essential commodities  The story so far: Securities & Exchange Board of India (SEBI) on Monday issued directions to stock exchanges in the commodity derivatives segment for immediately suspending trading in derivative contracts in key farm commodities, namely paddy (non-basmati), wheat, chana, mustard seeds and its derivatives, soya bean and its derivatives, crude palm oil and moong for a year.  The derivative contracts in these commodities were already suspended, as per a SEBI statement on August 16 and October 8, respectively.  What are derivative contracts?  Derivative contracts are between two or more parties where the derivative value is based upon an underlying asset, in this case agri commodities.  The prices of the derivatives are established by the price fluctuations of the underlying assets. Derivatives can be traded on an exchange or over the counter (OTC).  How does the system work and what are derivatives trading?  Derivatives trading takes place when traders speculate on the future price of an asset through buying or selling of derivative contracts to maximise profit, as compared to buying the underlying asset outright.  Traders also use derivatives for hedging to minimise risk against an existing position. With derivatives, traders can go short and make profit from falling asset prices. They also use derivatives to hedge against any existing long positions. The ultimate objective is to profit. This is viewed as a deterrent to bring in price discipline in the market.  What does the SEBI order mean?  No new contract will be introduced until further orders. In respect of running contracts, no new position will be allowed to be taken. Only squaring up of position has been allowed. The imports in such commodities, especially edible oils, would reduce in the short term as traders will not have a hedging platform. Hedging, which is speculative in nature, has been made difficult. This will lead to release of blocked local produce supplies into the market, which should cool the prices. Imports of commodities for speculative gains will be discouraged.  What is the objective of the suspension?  It is to rein in rising prices of essential commodities, which are fuelling inflation. India is the worlds biggest importer of vegetable oil and this measure will make it difficult for edible oil importers and traders to transact business since they use Indian exchanges to hedge their risk.  It is believed that speculators have a role in jacking up prices and this needed to be discouraged to curb inflation and support growth as the economy is recovering from COVID-19 impact.  The suspension of trading in these commodities follows a communication from the Department of Economic Affairs, which is closely monitoring price movements.  How alarming is inflation?  As per the RBI governors recent monetary policy statement, CPI inflation went up in October to 4.5% from 4.3% in September, after falling sharply between June and September. The persistence of high core inflation (i.e., CPI inflation excluding food and fuel) since June 2020 has been an area of policy concern as input cost pressures could rapidly be transmitted to retail inflation as demand strengthens.  The governors assessment is that price pressures may persist in the immediate term. He observed that supply side interventions by the Government had limited the fallout of continuing high international edible oil prices on domestic prices.  While cost-push pressures continue to impinge on core inflation, the inflation prints are likely to be somewhat higher over the rest of the year as base effects turn adverse. However, it is expected that headline inflation will peak in Q4 of 2021-22 and soften thereafter. RBI has projected CPI inflation at 5.3% for FY22.  What is being done to deal with inflation?  Besides suspension of futures trading in key farm commodities by the SEBI, the Government and RBI are resorting to multiple interventions to curb the rising inflation.  Recently, as prices of edible oil hit near record highs, the Union Government substantially reduced taxes on imports of palm, soy and sunflower oil, but the move had limited impact on combating inflation.  The Union and State Governments had also recently reduced excise duty and VAT on petrol and diesel, which was aimed at bringing down inflation by way of direct effects as well as indirect effects operating through fuel and transportation costs.",Explained | Why SEBI suspended futures trading in agri products,MUSTARD OIL

""We are happy to share that our leading members have responded proactively and reducedP on edible oils marketed by them, across the board by 10-15 per cent to provide relief to consumers during the festival season,"" Solvent Extractors Association of India (SEA) said in a statement.  With a view to providing succour to consumers, Union Food Secretary Sudhanshu Pandey had called a meeting of industry leaders a few days back and requested them to respond positively to the reduction in import duties which the government had announced, it added.  The industry body said it is hopeful the New Year would bring happier tidings for consumers with expectations of a large domestic mustard crop coupled with softening international prices in coming months.  The SEA further said that the exorbitant price increase in edible oils during the last few months on account of high international prices was unnerving domestic consumers as well as policy makers.  To rein in the prices of edible oils, the government has reduced import duties on both refined and crude edible oils several times this year.

According to the SEA, India's dependence on import of edible oils is nearly 65 per cent of the total consumption of about 22-22.5 million tonne. The country imports 13-15 million tonne to bridge the gap between demand and domestic supply.
