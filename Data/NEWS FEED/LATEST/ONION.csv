He noted that the UNs Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) officially announced 2021 as the International Year of Fruits and Vegetables with the idea to improve healthy and sustainable food production through innovative technology, and reduce food loss.Despite obstacles like Covid-19 and heavy rains, horticulture production was better last year. This only indicates that more farmers, mostly in Rayalaseema and upland areas of Krishna and Guntur districts, are shifting to horticulture, he observed.APSAM vice-chairman said more markets need to be explored when there is an increase in production so as to ensure that the farmers do not suffer losses.As domestic consumption cant continue to be a target, focus is on supply to other States. Apart from exploiting those markets, the horticulture department has been asked to ensure smoother and faster transportation and minimal paperwork, given the goods are perishable. To promote the horticulture produce from the State, representatives will be deployed in different markets, he added.At the same time, efforts to promote better quality produce with good demand through extension activities from horticulture and research institutions are underway.Fruits produced in 2019-20 (in lakh MT)Banana 62.97, mango 50.76, orange 22.41, papaya 18.08, lemon 6.57, muskmelon 4.05 , watermelon 3.74, guava 3.3Vegetables produced (in lakh MT)Tomato 26.67, onion 9.8, green chilli, cucumber 8.69, brinjal 4.32, bhendi 3.32","Andhra Pradesh accounts for 11.8 per cent of India's fruits, vegetables",ONION

The CIA director is a woman and women head all five of the agencys branches, including the directorates of science and technology, operations and digital innovation.But while the CIA has been diversifying for years, intelligence agencies still lag the federal workforce in minority representation. With thousands of job applicants annually, the CIA wants to do more to ensure its workforce reflects national demographics.The revamped website has links for browsing CIA jobs complete with starting salaries and requirements, sections on working at the agency, and a streamlined application process.Weve come a long way since I applied by simply mailing a letter marked CIA, Washington, D.C., said CIA Director Gina Haspel, who joined the agency in 1985. She said in a statement that she hopes the new website piques the interest of talented Americans and gives them a sense of the dynamic environment that awaits them here.Haspel has made recruitment a priority since she became the first female director in May 2018. Since then, the CIA has started advertising on streaming services, launched an Instagram account and an online onion site, a feature that makes both the information provider and the person accessing information more difficult to trace.Last year, the CIA designated its first executive for Hispanic engagement, Ilka Rodriguez-Diaz, a veteran of more than three decades with the agency. She first joined after attending a CIA job fair in New Jersey.The CIA had never been on my radar, she wrote in an op-ed in The Miami Herald after getting the job in October. I didnt think I fit the profile. After all, the spies I saw on TV were male Anglo-Saxon Ivy leaguers, not Latinas from New Jersey. Still, I went to my expert life coach, my mother, for advice. She said, No pierdes nada con ir. (What have you got to lose in going?) So, I went to the job fair. The rest, as they say, is history.Across the more than a dozen U.S. spy agencies, including the CIA, 61% of intelligence professionals in fiscal 2019 were men compared with 39% women, according to an annual demographics report compiled by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.In fiscal 2019, the intelligence community saw an incremental increase in the number of minority professionals  26.5%, up from 26.2%. But thats still lower than 37 percent in the federal workforce as a whole and 37.4 percent in the civilian labor force, the report said.The largest minority or ethnic group at all the intelligence agencies, including the CIA, was Black or African American at 12% followed by Hispanic at 7% and Asian at 4%. Persons with disabilities represent 11.5% of the workforce at all the U.S. intelligence agencies  up a point from the year before.Even with all the challenges 2020 posed, it was a standout recruitment year for CIA. Our incoming class is the third largest in a decade and represents the most diverse talent pool, including persons with disabilities, since 2010, said CIA spokesperson Nicole de Haay.",CIA's new recruitment website aims to diversify spy agency,ONION

While most farmers then decided to remain put at the borders  saying authorities wanted to push them into a corner  about 400 eventually moved to the Burari ground.Pointing to a volleyball net tied between a branch and a tent, Jagdeep Singh (24) from Punjabs Faridkot said on Tuesday, A sewadar from Delhi donated this net to us 10 days ago. Since then, some of us gather to play in the evenings. Farmers cannot sit idle, it is in our blood to do something productive. For the same reason, a number of older farmers decided to make use of the land and grow a few vegetables.Rows of 12-day-old onion plants are being cultivated not far from the 40 tractors at the site. Said Gurudev Singh Manga (42): They will take around 60 days to start yielding onions. It is symbolic of the fact that we will not move from here anytime soon.Gurudev and others from Ropar district in Punjab reached the site in the last week of November: We keep visiting Singhu and Tikri, but we will not go anywhere as it is easier to march to Delhi from here.At another corner of the site, Jaskaran Singh Kahan (58) and his family from Firozpur tend to the rows of corn, spinach, tomato and onion: There are 15 corn trees and two rows each of other vegetables. Once it becomes a bit warmer, we will grow rice and a few more vegetables. That way, we do not have to depend on resources from outside.He added that some were grown from leftover vegetables, while some seeds and plants were purchased from a nursery nearby. He said that they will be grown organically as the quality of the mud is good.While sporadic rains have been a boon for these crops, they have posed a new set of challenges. Many farmers dug trenches around their tents and tractors when they were expecting rain so water wouldnt accumulate where they sleep.For others, who have set up bigger tents with cloth on the ground, this was not an option. Pinderjeet Kaur (32), who joined her father-in-law at the protest, came to Delhi in a private vehicle along with her husband and two children. She said, Ten of us, including the children, sleep on three mattresses, which are now wet because of the rain the roof of the tents keep flying at night as well. She said nobody has given them a fresh set of mattresses and that they would have to wait for them to dry.Meanwhile, groups of farmers worked through the day to set up sheds for the two langars at the site. Jaspaal Singh (58) from Faridkot said a number of items come in from Singhu and Tikri borders. When we need something, we tap our networks there. Apart from that, people from Delhi come to our aid. The day it rained, a few sewadaars came and gave us material to set up tents, including asbestos, logs of wood, nails and hammers.As the evening set in, both langars had been sheltered from the drizzle, and farmers said they no longer had to worry about cooking in the rain.","Corn to onions — Burari ground, once feared as a ‘jail’, now a field for farmers",ONION

The wholesale price of onions that had reached 90 a kg over the last two months, is now down to 30 a kilo, said Ravi Kumar from the Bangalore Onion and Potato Traders Association. At present, onions are retailing at around 45, but a price correction over the next two weeks is expected.Onions are a staple ingredient but consumers were upset not only by the high prices but also by the low quality that was being sold. The new onions, a fresh harvest from Maharashtra, are dry and of a high quality.Shubha J., a software engineer, said that for the three months when the price of onions peaked, it had been tough cooking. We use onions almost every day. Even if you were ready to pay, there were no quality onions available in the market. Most of them were wet and sprouted, and would spoil in just a matter of days. The arrival of new onions is something to celebrate, she said.Chandrashekhar Hebbar, president, Karnataka Regional Hotels and Restaurants Association, said they were happy that good quality onions had come back with a price connection. Onions are a staple, especially in North Indian and Chinese cuisines. Even South Indian too, we had stopped selling onion dosas over the last three months, which we will reintroduce now. The ideal price for us would be at 25, a kilo, which we hope it will come down to in the next few weeks, he said.According to Ravi Kumar, a new crop has been harvested in Nashik and surrounding districts of Maharashtra, which has been flooding the States markets over the last one week. The previous crop was severely damaged due to heavy rains and floods, which had made the onions wet. Thankfully, there were no untimely rains this season, and the onions are of a good quality, he explained.After the previous crop was damaged due to floods, leading to a price escalation in the market, many farmers have planted a second crop in the State in the hope of cashing in on the rally in prices, sources said. The second crop in our State - in Belagavi, Haveri and Molakalmuru - is expected to be harvested by month end. There are crops that have been harvested in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, most of which are flooding markets in North India already. So the harvest of the crop in the State is unlikely to have a market in other States, and this will likely create a glut in the market, crashing the prices further, explained a senior onion trader at Yeshwanthpur APMC Yard.",High-quality onions from Maharashtra flood markets,ONION

Busting the myth are several Hyderabadis including celebs such as actor Samantha Akkineni and entrepreneur Upasana Kamineni Konidela who have taken up making their own compost and fertilisersOrganic farming is not a new trend. People in villages across the country have been practising it for years. Its the city folks like us who live in the concrete jungle who have forgotten the traditional ways of growing plants. Many say that its just not feasible to grow plants using organic methods as it requires a lot of space and is a time-consuming process.Busting the myth are several Hyderabadis who have taken their hobby of gardening one step further by not just growing plants, but also making their own compost and fertilisers. One such hobbyist with a green thumb is 64-year-old Rajyalaxmi, who started gardening around 28 years ago, after shifting to their newly-built independent house, which is little over 200 sq yards. Today, the Miyapur resident, along with her 39-year-old daughter Jyothi have succeeded in building a thriving garden in their front yard as well as a full-fledged rooftop vegetable garden.Ten years ago, the mother-daughter duo decided that it was time to get back to basics and stopped buying fertilisers and pesticides.We realised that using chemical-based fertilisers is neither good for the plants nor for those consuming the produce, says Jyothi, who quit her MNC job a couple months ago to start her own consultancy.Today, smartphones have changed the way we access information using the internet and there are a plethora of videos available on every subject on YouTube. But it was not the case couple of years ago. We started collecting newspaper articles and watching TV programmes on organic farming, and then began converting the waste generated at home into compost.While the Maddalis have come a long way and have mastered several techniques of preparing compost, theres another mother-daughter duo, who started their journey recently and are learning the art of compost making through trial and error. Tanuja Kondapalli, 35, and her mother, K Jyothi, 55, began their journey four years ago by raising four flowering plants at the balcony of their apartment in Kukatpally. Today, they have several plants on their roof-top and have inspired a couple of other families also to follow take the green route.Tanuja, who worked at the IIIT-H campus earlier, says she did not have much idea about gardening, but her mother who grew up in Nalgonda, always had a green thumb. Her grandparents had an independent house, where they used to grow various vegetables and also had several fruit bearing trees.My mom started gardening after my father passed away, it was like therapy for her. Two years ago, we thought why not set up a roof-top garden and began getting more and more plants, seeds, soil, fertiliser and pesticides. But everything was so expensive. Then, we started looking for places which would provide quality product at a reasonable price. We found a nursery, 30 km away from our place at Hayathnagar, on the city outskirts. But, going there every time was a task in itself, she adds.Instead of going to the nursery, she took the online route and started sifting through YouTube videos looking for a solution. Tanuja, who lives in a joint family, says they generate a lot of kitchen waste every day, which she has started converting into highly nutritious fertiliser. She is happy and her plants are glowing.Buoyed by their successes at home, both Jyothi and Tanuja, recently started their individual Facebook pages where they share tips on gardening and composting.

Thats how during that time dried and bottled food items especially the condiments like dried onion powder, lemon powder, fried onion ringlets among a gamut of several such other food products.Thats when a city-based entrepreneur Anubhav Bhatnagar, an XLRI alumnus launched a food range with a shelf life of 12-18 months. His startup Zillis is incubated under Atal Incubation Center ALEAP We-hub.The quick DIYs range that also helps to reduce the cooking time have preservatives in them. So while it is about quick food, what assures the same is healthy? Shares Anubhav, The fruits and vegetables have a short shelf life of 7-15 days and they attract fungus and bacteria because of the moisture in them. We follow an age-old technique of dehydration of preserving the food by removing moisture.He cites an example of grandmothers using the process of dehydration by drying chips and papad under the sunlight to remove moisture content.Once dried it can stay up to 1-2 years without attracting fungus and bacteria. Our process is based on the similar concept of drying the fruit and vegetable under hot air to remove moisture content and then making the powder, he adds.He tried making the first product in the kitchen using a microwave oven. I failed multiple times, burnt a lot of onions and garlic to arrive at my desired product. I tried using dehydrated onion and garlic in my curries to understand the difference (good or bad) it brought to my recipes. I was excited to find out that my curries even tasted better and just a spoonful of these powders was enough to bring that natural flavour. Not only did I not have to chop onions and garlic, he says.The powders did not require any roasting as well since they were dehydrated and hence, in concentrated form. This reduced my cooking time almost to half! This is how to we provide RTC products to our customer without compromising on health, he shares. The products that his startup offers are red onion powder, tomato powder, green chilli powder, garlic powder among other items.We also have five blends in our product catalogue and we are consistently working towards launching many more.Kolkata Jhal Muri (Murmura/Puffed Rice) Masala can be used in puffed rice with chopped onions, green chillies, coriander leaves, coconut, peanuts mixed in a small quantity of mustard oil and blended with the goodness of spices which makes it a very tasty and healthy snack.

Sandys cheery new Besant Nagar cafe is a rose-tinted tribute to the past with its old school sandwiches, milkshakes and dcor. A bitter-sweet reminder of our pre-COVID lives.Originally planned as the first of a new line of cafs called Sandys Toasteries, the Besant Nagar space evolved through the many challenges of 2020, and finally opened recently under the familiar flagship brand instead. Now, this is a relaunch of the Sandys brand, says Sandesh Reddy, the founder, adding, We wanted to break away from what we have been doing for the past 12 years. To reinvent ourselves.In times of tumult, such as this, people crave familiarity, leaning on food that reminds them of simpler days. So, not surprisingly, Sandesh has chosen to stick with his core strength, continuing to offer uncomplicated comfort food, with a focus on popular flavours. However, proving that this is a grown up version of his first menu more than a decade ago, the plates are cleverly engineered, harnessing a global array of techniques, recipes and ingredients and influences to create deceptively simple meals. Like the steak sandwich, featuring buttery meat set between thick slices of grilled Texan toast, smeared with mustard and aioli. Or the light, breaded onion rings, steamy inside and crisp outside, topped with microgreens. Or a bowl of hummus, drizzled with olive oil and studded with sturdy chunks of falafel.Desserts are indulgent. The tiny shake shake comprises a thick chocolate shake, topped with a hunk of cake balanced on top of the glass. Of course, theres one for Instagram: Milo tiramisu, designed like a pull up dessert. Im more excited about the fact that there are cortados and Aussie lattes on the menu though: till the vaccine arrives at least we can circle the world on a cloud of caffeine.Sandys Kitchen & Chocolate laboratory is at 5, 4th Main Road, Besant Nagar.The Butterfly EffectNever underestimate a sandwich. They can be wonderful things, as any midnight snacker can attest. At newly-launched Butterfly Effect on Cenotaph Road, popular Kiwi chef Willi Wilson, who was formerly executive Chef at The Park Chennai, has created a line of inventive gourmet sandwiches.The space, launched by architect Junaid Ahmed, is chic and inviting, flooded with natural light. Over a plate of smoky chicken wings, freshly fried and finished with a clingy hot and sweet sauce, Willi says the menu, built around continental and Italian favourites, focuses on food that is sustainable, quick, tasty, fresh.Of course continental food in India has come a long way from the 90s, thanks to Chefs like Willi, moving from stodgy carbs smothered in white sauce and processed cheese to bright inventive takes on classics.For the sandwiches, diners can choose between white bread, wholewheat, baguettes, ciabatta and focaccia. And while fillings include the obligatory roasted chicken, tuna-mayo and vegetable club with cheese, the cafe also offers more unusual sandwiches, including curried apple, set in creamy mayonnaise, chunky with almonds and raisins; chicken quesadilla with oozing cheese and grilled Caprese pesto with mozzarella.Watch out for the just-introduced Asian menu, featuring hawker classics like a spicy Indonesian Naso Goreng, served with egg and chicken wings. Or Willis cheeky Daddy Wus chicken, a tribute to sweet and spicy pop-Chinese food. And, a steamy bowl of creamy cajun spiced butter prawns spooned over warm rice.Restaurants are still struggling with the fallout of the pandemic, fighting hard to retain staff, follow rules of physical distancing, keep customers safe and  though all this  keep updating menus to stay relevant in a competitive market. But, despite the setbacks of 2020, the cheery burst of new openings, as well as encouraging return of diners, signal a new beginning.

Cauliflower, for instance, is selling at Rs 3.50 per kg at the weekly markets and mandis and tomato for as low as Rs 10 per kg.This is because many Haryana farmers are selling their produce directly in the Gurgaon mandis instead of the main market at Delhis Ghazipur. Since several roads are blocked in the national capital, it has been difficult for them to reach Ghazipur, from where their produce is routed to states like UP, Punjab, Himachal and Rajasthan. But with truck movement severely disrupted because of the blockades  the UP Gate protest site is, in fact, right next to the Ghazipur mandi  farmers are opting to sell their produce in Gurgaon and cut their losses.In fact, prices of almost all vegetables have come down by 50 to 75% in the past 20 days. Apart from the local vegetable markets, veggies on aggregator apps and in stores inside condominiums have also been selling at a low price.According to farmers, apart from the blocked roads, the absence of a cold storage facility in Gurgaon is forcing them to sell their produce at a lower rate as they are unable to preserve the veggies. Usually farmers from Pataudi, Farrukhnagar, Nuh, Jhajjar and other nearby districts of Haryana sell their produce at the Ghazipur mandi. However the blockade of arterial roads has meant that sales of fruits and vegetables have shrunk close to 50% at the capitals wholesale market for over a month now.Sellers from Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan are unable to visit the Ghazipur mandi, which has started to hurt their business. Vegetable sales are 50% less than a month ago, said Anil Yadav, a member of the Azadpur mandi, and wholesaler at the Khandsa mandi in Gurgaon. The detour has increased the transport freight and shortage of trucks has also affected our business. Transportation of onions, bottle gourd, bitter gourd, ginger, garlic to north Indian states has come down substantially due to the unavailability of trucks.Rajinder Kumar, a wholesaler, said vegetables are being literally dumped at the Gurgaon mandi. Earlier, vegetables from the neighbouring districts were transported to Delhi. But nowadays, instead of selling their crop in the mandis there, farmers are dumping the same in the wholesale market in Gurgaon. The current climatic conditions are favourable for vegetables and thus a large number of farmers in the adjoining district have been bringing huge quantities of vegetables to the local markets.The rates of onions and potatoes have also seen a dip, being sold at Rs 25 per kg and Rs 15 per kg, respectively, on Wednesday. The price of radish and carrot is Rs 10 per kg, while peas and pumpkin are being sold for Rs 25.Hemant Kumar, another wholesaler, said he has witnessed this sharp slump in vegetable prices for the first time. Be it radish, carrot, onion or potato, prices of all vegetables have crashed. The oversupply in the market is only leading to drop in prices as buyers are less, he said.At present, only 6,000 trucks are moving in and out of Delhi. Earlier this number used to be around a lakh. Not only vegetables, but prices of all essential goods have been impacted, said Rajinder Kapoor, president of Delhi Goods Transport Association.Meanwhile, consumers are a delighted lot. This is the first time that I got five different veggies for less than Rs 40 a kg. I am surprised that I am able to purchase vegetables for such a low price in an expensive city like Gurgaon, said Megha Chawla, a Sector 56 resident.","As blockades force farmers to go local, veggies dirt cheap at mandis",ONION

On Wednesday, the vegetable was sold at Rs 58-60 a kg in major markets like Maniktala .Onions are transported to Bengal in bulk from Nasik in Maharashtra and Bellary in Karnataka. In 2019, the vegetable touched the record price Rs 150 a kg.Asked the reason behind such rise in price, Bhola Das, an onion seller at Lake Market, said, It is not very clear to us. The supply has become a bit erratic. The wholesale rate has been very inconsistent and rising. Today a 40- kg onion bag is being sold at Rs1,800-1,900. Only four days ago it was Rs 1,400-1,500. Moreover, the quantity of damaged or rotten onions is higher in every bag.There was untimely rain in the western part of the country, where onions are produced. The rain led to the rotting of crops. There were issues over loading and unloading. A large number of farmers also joined the anti-farm law agitation in Delhi. All these had a collective impact on the supply of onions to our state, said Chandan Chakraborty, working president of Onion Merchant Association at Posta.Keeping in mind the erratic supply, the onion price is unlikely to dip before the end of February when the new onion crop of Bengal will hit the market.The price rise is all due to the gap between demand and supply, said Taraknath Trivedi, general secretary of West Bengal Federation Traders Organization (FTO).Chandan Chakraborty also hinted at nefarious nexus at some major unloading points in Dhulagarh, Posta, Sealdah and Shyambazar, where some people dictated the price to maximise their profit.",WB: Onion price jumps by Rs 20 in four days,ONION

Inflation in the primary articles group contracted for the first time in five months at 1.6% in December, while wholesale food inflation declined 1.1% during the month compared with 13.3% in the same year earlier month.Arrival of fresh supplies helped ease prices in cereals and vegetables. Cereals contracted an annual 6.5%, while vegetable prices fell 13%. Onion prices, which had been on fire earlier, contracted 55% in December, while wheat prices dipped 11%. Inflation in potato prices persisted and rose 38%, third consecutive month of elevated prices.The trajectory of the WPI data was similar to the retail inflation data , which was released earlier and showed a sharp moderation in December on the back of softening of food prices and improved supplies. The WPI data also showed that core inflation (excluding food and fuel) rose to a 24-month high of 4.2%, which economists said injected an element of uncertainty over the trajectory of WPI in the months ahead. Wholesale prices will continue to see a moderate pick-up in the coming months, especially in manufacturing, owing to firming up of global metal prices following the opening up of the economy, said Madan Sabnavis , chief economist at Care Ratings .",Wholesale inflation eases to 4-mth low at 1.2% in Dec,ONION

I mentioned AKUS: The Brrgrr Co. to them one evening, and they assured me that the burgers were Yum. I had first heard about this place when some friends marked an anniversary picnic with AKUS. The praise that followed prompted me to take a look at this burger heaven. I found that it had an outlet in Gurugram and Delhis Defence Colony (call 8826669279).I looked at the menu and saw that they had an interesting mix of burgers: freshly minced lamb patties, chicken breasts, or a prawn patty. We asked for three kinds: a Bold Bingo, Meister and Chalapeno.I had the Bold Bingo, tasted the other two, and loved them all! Mine had a lamb patty, blue cheese, caramelised onions, blended cheese and lettuce. The buns were soft, lamb was juicy, the blue cheese gave it a just-right piquancy, and the lettuce lent crunch.The patty wasnt smothered with sauce (as some MNC burgers are), so it didnt drip messily, but gave the burger a kick. A young nephew who had a Bold Bingo the next day said that the meat, cheese and onions complemented one another well, and what really worked for him was the fact that the burger didnt become a gooey mess in his hands, and the size was just right.The Chalapeno had a stuffing of a grilled chicken breast, cheese blend, lettuce, jalapeo, peppers and jalapeo spread. This was ordered keeping in mind that one member of the household loves hot food  and she felt it was the best shed ever had.The master was the Meister  a lamb patty, with a fried egg, bacon, cheese, caramelised onions and sauce. The egg and the bacon (imported, says the menu) gave the burger a delicious twist. And the egg, of course, added another level of texture and taste.In the vegetarian section, there is a burger called Master Wu with wild mushroom and jalapeos, and a Master Blu with wild mushroom and blue cheese. The grilled Beetburger has a beetroot patty, and the Giza consists of a crisp potato and cheese patty. There is a gluten-free bun on offer, and a DIY kit.If youre hearty eater, this burger wont be enough for a meal. You may need side dishes, or if you are a growing boy (like the aforementioned nephew), you may want to have a full meal after the burger.There are quite a few sides, too. House made chicken nuggets with honey mustard mayo, skin-on French fries, onion rings and more. The fries are of three types: with salt and parsley, paprika, or truffle Parmesan and parsley.Prices range from 250 to 285 for vegetarian, and between 250 and 450 for the non-vegetarian burgers.Now I know why the young neighbours thought the burgers were yum.

Read MoreNEW DELHI: The price of onions has spiked in Delhi owing to supply being less than usual from various states, including Maharashtra . Many onion producing states have reported damage to crops due to unseasonal rain towards the end of 2020.Currently, the staple is retailing between Rs 40 and Rs 60 per kg across the capital, while the wholesale rate is between Rs 10 and Rs 40. The prices of other vegetables are normal, most of which are supplied from Haryana.Traders say there has been a 50% decline in the stock of onions arriving at Azadpur Mandi, from where the vegetable is supplied to retail markets across Delhi-NCR. Normally, 50-60 trucks of onions used to come every day, but the number has dropped to 30-35 now.However, the traders said the stir by farmers at Singhu , Ghazipur and Tikri borders had not affected supply because trucks were using the peripheral expressway and entering the city through Gurugram. Some drivers were also using village roads to arrive at Azadpur Mandi.Srikant Mishra, secretary of Onion Traders Association, Azadpur Mandi, said, The rain in December last year damaged onion seedlings in the nurseries. The farmers had to prepare the seedlings again, which caused a delay in production.By the end of February, supply of onions from Sikar district in Rajasthan and Ujjain, Bhopal, Narsinghgarh and Ratlam in Madhya Pradesh will start, which will lead to reduction in prices, added Mishra.Ram Avtar Singh, a retailer at Laxmi Nagar, said the price of onions was between Rs 25 and Rs 35 throughout January, but started to increase at the beginning of February. We are buying onions at Rs 30-40 from the wholesale market and selling at Rs 40-50, he added.Onion prices will remain high only for around 15 days and will start coming down by the last week of February. The supply from Maharashtra has been hit because the seedlings got damaged. Within the next 15 days, the wholesale and retail prices of onions will reduce, said Rajinder Sharma, an onion and potato trader.Another trader said the price would have risen further had the supply from Gujarat also been hit.

When the prices start rising, there is massive hue and cry. But, mostly the price of tomato doesnt rise and farmers are compelled to sell it for Rs 3-Rs 10 per kg.

Rural inflation eased last month to 3.23%, while urban inflation stood at 5.1%.The moderation in consumer prices was driven by a broad-based softening in food inflation, with the Consumer Food Price Index rising just 1.89% in January, appreciably slower than Decembers 3.4% pace.However, core inflation, excluding food and fuel prices, was estimated to be at about 5.7% and hovering close to the same level as in December. Economists foresee a resurgence in overall inflation from February as the benefit of a favourable base effect wears off.The sequential momentum in core inflation has risen, following the highest ever WPI-core momentum reading in December, rising mobility indicators and falling COVID-19 cases, said Sreejith Balasubramanian, economist at IDFC AMC.Going forward, the base effect which helped recent lower prints, will wane in February and March and the magnitude of disinflation in vegetables would also most likely ease, while the price movement in pulses and vegetable oils needs to be watched closely, he added.The National Statistical Offices release on the Index of Industrial Production (IIP) for December provided some cheer as it revealed a recovery in output following a 2.1% decline in November and was stronger than the 0.4% growth seen in December 2019. The rebound was led by a 5.1% jump in electricity production, which rose for the fourth month in a row, and a 1.6% increase in manufacturing output.The NSO also revised upwards the industrial output number for September, to growth of 1% from an earlier estimate of 0.5%.There is some comfort in both the IIP growth number and CPI inflation for December and January, respectively, said Madan Sabnavis, chief economist at CARE Ratings, terming the 1% industrial output growth a gentle surprise from its forecast of 0.1% growth.Our forecast of 0.1% was against the backdrop of negative growth in the core industries, but the situation has been buffered by an impressive performance of consumer goods  both durable and non-durable  with the base effect providing an upward bias, he said, adding that increases in electronics, auto and capital goods output had also helped.The December data once again reinforced the view that the uptick witnessed in September and October was due to a combination of festive and pent up demand and the recovery was still fragile, opined Sunil Kumar Sinha, principal economist at India Ratings. However, the positive aspect of the December 2020 factory output is that it has now crossed the pre-COVID level, that is the level of output witnessed in February 2020, he added.Aditi Nayar, principal economist at ICRA, said that food inflation had helped soften retail inflation, but many of the non-food categories had recorded a quickening in inflation in January.Food prices have displayed a mixed trend so far in February 2021. The rise in onion prices, as well as higher crude oil prices and their transmission into retail fuel prices are areas of concern that need to be monitored. With inflation expected to resume an uptrend in February-March 2021, we do not think Januarys inflation numbers create room for an imminent rate cut, she said.","Data buoys: inflation cools to 4.06%, IIP rises 1%",ONION

What is harvested is also still lying on the fields. Similarly, standing sorghum crop in Marathwada is in the matured stage and is yet to be harvested in some places. A rain spell could cause quality deterioration issues in these crops.Thorat said already onion productivity was expected to reduce in the onion belt in Maharashtra because of the above normal winter temperatures.Vijay Thube, the director of Shashwat Krishi Vikas India, a farmers producer company in Pune district, said, Rain in January this year had already damaged many crops, and the impending spell was expected to do further damage. Most of the crops such as gram, wheat, millets are still in the fields. Even light rains are detrimental at this juncture because it is necessary wheat and other rabi crops are not exposed to moisture during the current stage, otherwise they could rot overtime.Shankar Dumre, a Junnar-based farmer owning 5-acre farm land, said, Almost 70 to 80% crop of pomegranate, maize, onion, grapes, wheat is yet to be harvested from my field.

MetroPlus hops on board for a rideIt makes a dramatic entry. Painted in blue, the train emerges from a backdrop of steam and smoke. Chugging towards me, it whistles before halting at platform Number 1 with a hiss. It is early in the morning, the air is nippy, and I am at Mettupalayam Railway Station, thrilled to ride on the Nilgiri Mountain Railway (NMR) toy train, declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 2005. Just across the platform is the NMR museum that celebrates the history of this iconic train (see infobox). The train services were suspended from March 2020 due to the pandemic; and restarted recently, after nearly 10 months.The first-ever trip of the train was on June 15, 1899. After nine years, on October 15, 1908, it got extended till Udhagamandalam, says K Natrajan, founder of Heritage Steam Chariot Trust. The train connects Mettupalayam with Udhagamandalam via Coonoor after passing through Kallar, Adderly, Runnymede, Wellington, Aravankaadu, Ketti and Lovedale stations.Vistas unfoldAs the train starts moving in a slow rhythm, I sit back and enjoy the scenery unfolding outside my window. For the first five kilometres, it chugs along flat plains cutting through banana plantations, arecanut farms, and fields being readied for farming. A peacock shows off its plumage beside the track, unmindful of the steaming train trundling by.The rack and pinion system to climb the steep gradient | Photo Credit: SATHYAMOORTHY MTrain trivia The Nilgiri Mountain Railway is one of three Indian railways which were recognised by UNESCO as outstanding examples of hill railways. The other two are the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway that runs between New Jalpaiguri and Darjeeling in West Bengal and the KalkaShimla Railway that connects the Rajs summer residency at Shimla with Delhi.Nilgiri Railway Company constructed the railway from 1886 to 1899. In January 1903, it was purchased by the government and construction between Coonoor and Udhagamandalam was completed in 1908.The train has six coaches including the first-class and general class compartments. You have to book your tickets much in advance on the IRCTC website as the train has been running full with 180 passengers.The train starts at 7.10 at Mettupalayam and takes fours hours and 50 minutes to reach Udhagamandalam.Coimbatore is the nearest city to reach Mettupalayam. From Coimbatore, it is just an hour journey in a bus.The Museum at Mettupalayam station is a walk through history of how NMR came into being. A number of old photographs taken during the construction of the railways, visits of personalities and inaugural journeys grace the wall. It houses models of of some of the oldest locomotives and coaches used on the Nilgiri mountain route, and other rare artefacts related to the Nilgiri Mountain Railway (NMR) The first loco, made at Swiss Locomotive and Machine Works Winterthur in Zurich in Switzerland, which pulled the NMR on one of its first rides on the Western Ghats in 1899, is on display.Miniatures of narrow gauge, meter gauge and broad gauge railway lines with fish plates, the LHB Coaches( that have been developed in Karpurthala and in use since 2000) designed to use higher operating speed and accomodate more passengers, coaches of Duronto, Jan Shatabdi and Rajdhani trains, Metro trains and Electrical Multiple Units, and the unique rack and pinion system are showcased. The coaches and wagons used to transport coal are also displayed.A vintage ticket machine that is used for punching the ticket and assigning a serial number can be found inside the hall. Other exhibits include old weighing machines, paraffin gas lamps and Berkefeld Filter, rious models of signalling lamps used by Indian Railways as it went through an evolution, Morse code machine and Magneto Telephone.You can also see a five-tonne manually operated crane manufactured at Bradford that was used to move defence materials by train from Mettupalayam to WellingtonAt Kallar, the first station on the route, the rack and pinion system engages and the train begins its ascent through bridges and dark, winding tunnels taking you physically along the stunning views at every single twist and turn.The railway between Mettupalayam and Coonoor was constructed using alternate biting teeth technology in rack and pinion arrangement between the rails. The rack and pinion is a striking engineering feature. It is designed to climb the steepest gradient of 1 in 12 feet, making it the second steepest climb in the world. The rack and pinion extends up to 19 kilometres which is the longest in the world, explains Natrajan.Powered by steamAt Adderly, engineers refill the water tanks and I notice that the locomotive bears the name of Nilgiri flycatcher, an endemic bird that can be seen only in the Nilgiris. As the train is powered by steam locomotives between Mettupalayam and Coonoor, it halts at regular intervals, to refill water, says S Prasanna, Station Master. It uses 4,000 litres of water every five kilometres.Workers, who conduct regular maintenance checks for the engine, tell me that the train crosses 250 bridges and passes through 16 tunnels. Each time we enter or emerge from a tunnel, passengers on board cheer loudly. When an Indian gaur shows up, striking a pose amidst the greenery, there are collective sighs all around.The signature whistling, steam and the rustic wooden coaches with long windows take me back in time to the iconic film Sadma featuring Kamal Haasan and Sridevi, where the train features in songs and key scenes.Stunning viewsThe stretch from Mettupalayam to Coonoor  the first 27 kilometres of the total 46  trundles through deep valleys, thick forests with dense greenery, and by leafy walls covered in yellow, red, and orange wild flowers that are so close, you can reach out and pluck them. As we near Runnymede, neatly trimmed green patches of tea plantations with towering silver oak trees take over. The place is so green, it tempts each of us to step down and soak up the view. A railing has been erected to mark the forest boundary and down below a stream gurgles. There are garden chairs for passengers to sit and stare. Natrajan points out that Mahatma Gandhis ashes were immersed in the nearby wild stream, at the sangamam point of two rivers along the Runnymede.At Coonoor, over sweet masala chai, onion samosas and paruppu vada, we bid goodbye to the oil-furnace-powered steam locomotive. It is detached and replaced by a diesel engine for the last leg of the journey from Coonoor to Udhagamandalam. Onward it goes through tea plantations, and the blue-green expanse of the Ooty lake.

Today we are going to discuss a similar rare disease that wasnt common earlier known as Polycythemia. It is a rare blood disorder that causes your body to overproduce red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets.This disease mostly occurs in men after 40. Red blood cells carry oxygen throughout the body, white blood cells fight infection and platelets are involved in clotting the blood to stop or slow down the bleeding which indirectly helps in the healing of wounds. When too many RBC, WBC platelets circulate in our bodies, blood starts thickening and may not flow properly through the blood vessels.This increases the risk of blood clots in major arteries and veins of our body, which can lead to a stroke or heart attack. If clots occur in the entire body, then they can affect other vital organs. Smaller blood vessels can be blocked by clots which may lead to headaches, vision changes, light-headedness, numbness, burning, redness and swelling.While no special diet exists to aid the treatment of polycythemia, it is recommended that you eat a well-balanced meal and limit your intake of sodium. Increased blood volume increases your risk of high blood pressure. Limiting your sodium intake can help you better manage your blood pressure and you can avoid processed foods such as bacon, meat, sausage, frozen meals, salty chips and soup to control the same. Instead, include more fresh, home food with pink salt. Here are few tips to be healthy:Eat antioxidant-rich foods, including fresh fruits and vegetables to add fibre to your body which ultimately will help in controlling blood pressure.Avoid refined foods, such as white processed sugar, bread and junk food to control inflammation as they may contain high-fat content and increase chances of blood thickening.Avoid red meat and choose lean meats like chicken, cold-water fish, pulses and beans, nuts and seeds for protein. Protein repairs the cells in our bodies.Use healthy cold-pressed coconut oil, sesame, mustard or groundnut oil or A2 ghee for cooking, which helps in controlling inflammation.Try to eliminate trans-fatty acids from your routine, found in commercially baked goods such as cookies, crackers, cakes, French fries, onion rings, doughnuts, processed foods and margarine. They can make your blood flow sluggish and can increase the chances of blood clots.Avoid caffeine, alcohol, and tobacco as they can keep the inflammation levels high and will not help the body to heal.Drink eight to 10 glasses of water a day to make sure the body gets detoxified and it doesnt allow the thickening of blood.These practices can be followed daily to keep a check on your blood.DEEPIKA RATHODChief Nutrition Officer, Luke Coutinho Holistic Healing Systems.

The district has one of Indias highest rates of distress migration, with lakhs of workers looking for jobs elsewhere every year.Things have changed in our village because of MGNREGA. We have been creating ponds and tanks to catch water, and digging wells to harvest the recharged water, he said in a webinar organised by the Centre for Science and Environment on the occasion of World Water Day. He held up an onion plant to the camera, showing off the fruits of his newly fertile land. During the pandemic, most of the returning workers found employment in the village itself, he said.Bhuanpada is not an isolated case. Across the country, the water harvesting and conservation structures that now make up 60% of all new MGNREGA assets are starting to pay off, according to CSE.The MGNREGA is not simply a social security scheme to generate employment for the rural poor. It may also be the worlds largest climate change adaptation scheme, said CSE director Sunita Narain.Over the last 15 years, three crore assets related to water-conservation have been created through the rural jobs scheme with the potential to conserve more than 2,800 crore cubic metres of water. On the ground, this has transformed the fate of some villages. However, challenges remain in obtaining timely payment of MGNREGA wages and ensuring village participation in the planning process.Bhuanpadas sarpanch joined Mr. Bag on the screen. The payment for MGNREGA workers still comes very late, he said, adding that distress migration could not be reversed unless timely payment was made.In Palakkad district of Kerala, women workers have managed to revive streams and rivers in the water-scarce village of Pookkottukavu, which gets only 2300 mm of annual rainfall. With hundreds of water harvesting structures being built under the MGNREGA scheme, 200 wells are now planned to make the village water-surplus.

These projects have helped to reduce their difficulty to a certain extent and give them the hope that in the near future the village will be free of water scarcity. We can see the groundwater levels rising, said Vismaya Sukumaran, who works with MGNREGA.In Vasna village of Gujarats Sabarkantha district, migration has reduced by 40% because of the extensive irrigation system created through small dams constructed under the programme. Earlier, the village was completely rain-dependent, but now the ponds and tanks provide surface water for 10 months of the year. Farming is back as the main occupation, and annual family savings are up to 2 lakh, preventing the need for migration, said Ms. Narain.She emphasised the need for village workers to participate in the actual planning exercises of the Gram Sabha, rather than simply be treated as labour. Villages must also be allowed to take control of their own water security, she said, noting that catchment areas for many villages are on land controlled and owned by the Forest Department. It is important to MGNREGA to measure the sustainability impact, and not just count the number of works created or days of labour provided. The scheme must track and monitor outcomes, measuring the change in groundwater levels and village incomes, said Ms. Narain.","MGNREGA: Water harvesting, conservation structures starting to pay off",ONION

You dash right in, make yourself and your group comfortable while you place the order. The Punjabi Swag, a restaurant at Gachibowli offers ghar da swad with a mouth-watering menu of Punjabi, North Indian, and Tandoori dishes. During the time of the ongoing pandemic what makes a visit to this eatery worthwhile is the social distancing, the staff in masks and the use of disposable containers in which the different food items are served.The best part is that you can fold your feet comfortably on the soft gadda as your relish the morsels. We loved Dhaba Chicken Tikka cooked in white masala and served with raw onion ringlets. The taste is light and doesnt offer a blast of condiments which makes you relish the taste bit by bit. We recommend Patiala Chicken with Garlic Naan for the main course. The meat chunks are succulent with the right blend of spices. The dish that won our hearts is Dal Makhani with its velvety texture and slightly smoky yet light taste. And quite surprisingly, what makes the dish taste different from what we sample in other restaurants is that theres no use of butter. Shares Sandeep Singh the co-owner of the restaurant, studied at the Culinary Academy of India, Begumpet, under chef Sudhakar Rao, On purpose, we do not use butter in any of our dishes. Instead, we use desi ghee as we wanted to do something different from others. Thats how all their dishes are prepared with ghee.The recipes are from Punjabi homes. Sometimes we blend the methods to prepare a dish, but dont change the same entirely, adds Sandeep, whos been living in Hyderabad for the past 12 years. The chefs are from Bengal and they are still waiting for the dessert-chef to come back from Calcutta. The lassi comes in varieties and a board announces the different types under the title Lassi Da Theka and as we enjoy our food there are humorous text pieces on the wall with interesting points such as Punjabi diet plan which begins with bread and a half-boiled egg at 7.30 am and ends with Chicken Tikka, Butter Chicken, Gulab Jamun etc., etc. Reading the same leaves you in splits as you finish your meal.

Srinivasan is seeking to get re-elected, has returned Congress and CPI(M) candidates several times since it came into being in 1957.Jamal Mohideen of the Congress won the first-ever election here. Only in 1984 did AIADMKs Premkumar win the seat. The DMK registered its first victory in the constituency in 1996, when Manimaran became its MLA.The constituency is compact, in that it comprises 48 wards of the Corporation, nine panchayats and a few villages and its population has a mix of various castes, including Pillaimar, Vanniyar, Naidu and Sourashtra, besides Muslims and Christians. Having a total electorate of 2,75,979, The constituency has not witnessed any tangible development worth mentioning, say its residents. Places like Kodaikanal, Sirumalai and Lord Murugas abode, Palani among others, could have been developed in a big way, they felt.Mr. Srinivasan, who has also served as a Member of Parliament, is a familiar figure. But a section of the electorate felt that he had not done much on the development front. For instance, work on the Balakrishnapuram bridge has been going on for almost seven years. Similarly, work on an underpass on the Palani-Dindigul stretch has been going on for the last six years. The AIADMK government upgraded the Dindigul Municipality into a Corporation but residents are yet to benefit from the move. No one, including the civic officials, have a clue as to when the underground drainage work would be completed in all the wards, a resident said.Many roads have been dug up and motorists have a harrowing experience navigating them. Dindigul, which connects Madurai and Tiruchi with Tiruppur, was once famous for its lock industry. However, over the years, the sector has gone silent. The elected representatives have not taken any initiative to revive it, an entrepreneur said.The city does not have a state-of-the-art bus stand. The existing Kamarajar bus stand is being used, as a result of which the roads are always congested. The promise to set up a park for weavers has not materialised. Similarly, farmers growing onion and garlic do not have any storage facility. There are around 30 to 50 small and medium leather/tannery units. They, too, have not got any support from the government, and are constantly under the scanner of the pollution control board..Even before Gandhi Market could be constructed fully, the AIADMK inaugurated it in a hurried manner. Barely a few hours before the model code of conduct came into force, it was opened. But the market has been functioning outside the premises.Speaking to The Hindu, The Minister said the Cauvery water scheme, which had been initiated by the DMK, was completed by the AIADMK. This is a major achievement. The Kudimaramathu scheme has benefited the district in a big way, and farmers are able to conserve water. . The yield of agricultural produce has increasedacross the district, he added.Most importantly, the effective handling of the pandemic brought the virus under control, he said.Admitting that ongoing development work may be posing difficulties for the residents, , he said they would improve the standard of living in the coming years. Attributing the delay in projects to land acquisition and other factors, He said the Balakrishnapuram flyover would be completed by 2021.The DMK has given the seat to its ally, the CPI(M), which has fielded N. Pandi, a veteran politician who is regarded to be accessible and people-friendly. . Having thorough knowledge of the issues facing Dindigul, He is confident of emerging the victor by a margin of at least 25,000 votes.. The DMK-CPI(M) and their allies are confident of garnering a majority of the votes in Begumpur, which has a large Muslim population. Similarly, the AIADMK is relying on votes of Pillaimars and Vanniyars. AMMK, NTK and MNM candidates are also in the fray.The battle seems to be largely between the two Dravidian alliances, but other players are confident of springing a surprise.","Tamil Nadu Assembly Elections | Lacking in development, Dindigul poses a test for Minister",ONION

2021-03-26,https://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/health/2021/mar/28/cure-the-clot-ways-to-prevent-theclump-of-blood-from-affecting-you-2281598.html,"Luke Coutinho ByA blood clot is a clump of blood that can occur in any part of the body, including the brain, eyes, lungs, heart and legs. These could lead to severe pain in the leg, making it difficult to walk. One could even lose a limb if its a severe case of clotting.If found in the arteries, clots can increase the risk of a stroke or a heart attack. Clotting in the veins can cause deep vein thrombosis (a blood clot in the veins of the pelvis, leg, arm, liver, intestines or kidneys) or a pulmonary embolus (blood clot in the lungs).Why clots occurChronic InflammationInflammation by itself is not a problem. Whenever we get hurt, the wounded area swells up and becomes red. This happens because our vessels dilate, making the blood rush to heal the area. The blood also starts thickening and forming clots so we don't bleed. This process is supposed to kick in at the right time, do its job and then switch off. The problem arises when inflammation becomes chronic and doesnt switch off'.Uncontrolled blood pressureMost people take high blood pressure casually and its the very thing that should never be taken lightly. The more forcefully blood pumps, the more the arteries stretch to allow the blood flow. If this force is too high, that too for an extended period of time, it creates vascular weakness, making vascular prone to ruptures.It also causes vascular scarring, which can catch debris such as cholesterol, blood cells and plaque. This leads to an increased risk of blood clots, heart attack and stroke.Gum diseaseGum disease is closely connected to heart disease and should be treated immediately. These are caused by bacteria that are capable of entering the bloodstream and damage the blood vessels or arteries, finally leading to blood clots inside the arteries.Precautionary MeasuresIt is important to seek medical advice and get the nature of the clot checked. Discuss the possible risks and drug interactions before adding supplementation to your diet or making lifestyle changes.For once, go easy on green leafy vegetables as these are loaded with Vitamin K, which cause factors, which could lead to clotting. This means that it can also affect the efficacy of anticoagulant medications like Warfarin, and promote platelet aggregation.Management through foods and lifestyleOur blood gets its volume through the water content present in it. A lack of hydration can cause blood to thicken.Apple cider vinegar may lower blood pressure and reduce the risk of heart disease.Garlic and onion help reduce platelets aggregation due to the presence of an active compound called allicin, which is a vasodilator and anticoagulant. Onion on the other hand is rich in flavonoids called quercetin, which helps in dilating blood vessels.Turmeric acts as an antiplatelet medication and reduces bloods tendency to form clots.Deep breathing, especially nasal breathing, works like magic for bringing high blood pressure under control. It immediately puts us in a parasympathetic state, which helps relax the walls of the blood vessels.Note: It is important to keep your health professional in the loop before making amends to your lifestyle. Nothing mentioned above is a replacement for the medication.(The author is a Mumbai-based holistic lifestyle coach Integrative Medicine)",Cure the clot: Ways to prevent the clump of blood from affecting you,ONION

A Sindhi's quintessential identity is indeed synonymous with this yellow-coloured curry.Bhavnani's aunt Kamla Thakur explains the tedious kadhi-making process in the film from start to finish, with the camera following the rigours. ""Food is something big for us, and so it made sense to weave the story around it. Kadhi is my favourite, and it was my only choice because that is a Sindhis identity,"" says Bhavnani.Sindhi Kadhi is distinctly different from other kadhis. ""It is made from tur daal. We boil it with tomatoes in a cooker, then seave and use the soup, cooking it on slow fire much like a mithai. It is nutritious as we put lots of vegetables in it,"" she says.Chef Sanjeev Kapoor couldn't agree more. ""Sindhi Kadhi is full of flavour. I like the veggies that go into it. Kadhi elsewhere uses curd, but the Sindhi one doesn't,"" he says.Same-same differentWhat sets Sindhi cuisine apart from others is its use of vegetables, spices, and cooking method. ""They use both leafy greens such as spinach, fenugreek, etc, and also other vegetables such as okra, potatoes and drumsticks,"" says Kapoor.Mumbai-based home chef Poonam Shahani, who runs Mamma's Cucina, agrees. ""We use many vegetables that arent common in other cuisines. We also use a technique to allow the food to cook in its juices called teewan, a gravy made of tomatoes, onions and spices."" When made with rice, it is Seyal Teewan; with bread, it is Seyal Dabroti; with roti, it becomes Seyal Mani.Kapoor thinks that Sindhi cooking is an amalgamation. He says, ""They have a unique cooking style and have their favourites when it comes to spices. They like to play with the base of their dishes."" But God is in the details. Chef Satyajit Kotwal of Satyajit's Kitchen elucidates that the most common type of Sindhi cooking is Daag Mein (onion-tomato-based-curry).""It brings out the sweetness of caramelised onions to provide a balanced flavour to the curries. In Seyal, the quantity of onions exceeds that of vegetables that are cooked till translucent. Saye Masale Mein uses coriander leaves, garlic, ginger and green chillies cooked with grated tomatoes and spices; the mix serves as a base in many Sindhi preparations,"" he explains.Another popular Sindhi cooking method is Daas, where whole vegetables are stuffed with a mix of grated onion and Sindhi pesto, and cooked till tender, says Kotwal.Sindhi cuisine has a lot of exciting items too. ""The accompaniments are also imperative. Dishes such as fried potatoes or fried okra, papads, dahi, sweet boondi, etc, are the common ones. Theres an array of sweets, snacks, and bread to choose from,"" says Kapoor.Cooking delightIt was a rather sweet initiation into the home-grown food business for Mumbai-based Uttamchandani siblings - Ritesh, Shirley and Sonia - who made their debut with Sev Mithai or Singharji Mithai and Mohanthaal during the lockdown. ""It was around Riteshs birthday in July last that this idea first cropped up. We were thrilled to bits, so we started it,"" says Shirley.The trio was wary of people's reaction, especially from the traditional Sindhis, but the sweets tickled their taste buds too, besides finding favour among the non-Sindhis. Ritesh attributes it to the ""curiosity factor"".Delhi's Archana Manwani loved to host non-Sindhi friends. ""It was their encouragement that led to this food business. I take orders 24 hours before the delivery. I prepare food with specially sourced ingredients, be it vegetables or spices,"" she says. Giving a rundown of her story, Shahani says, ""Not many people are aware of the range that Sindhi food offers. Also, theres a dearth of places that serve authentic range in Mumbai.""Chipping in, Sonia highlights how most upmarket eating places dont even have Sindhi foods on their menu. ""There's a mention of all but not Sindhi, and that's sad,"" says Sonia, who with Shirley and Ritesh has added many traditional Sindhi foods, and Riteshs special - jaggery Sev Mithai - to the menu.Shahani also got into the business to ""preserve her cultures flavour for those youngsters who are losing touch with their roots"".Manwani is quite keen to promote Sindhi cuisine among Delhiites. ""I approached the Director of Tourism in Delhi for a stall in Dilli Haat. But I havent got any response,"" she rues. Thakur is the go-to person for Bhavnani, be it ""Teevan, Sai Bhaji, Seyal Beeh Patata, and, of course, Kadhi"".

Farmers say they would face severe losses in sale of products such as milk, fruits and vegetables if markets close.While growers of non-perishable commodities like chana, tur and wheat might not face problems with disposal of their produce, a lockdown would result in huge losses to them.

The grape season is in its last leg and there should be no lockdown for at least the next 15 days. If the markets are closed, we will again be compelled to discard our produce, he said.Last year, Gorde and other grape farmers had sustained huge losses as the lockdown had dried up markets and prices had collapsed to Rs 10-12 per kg.

We will be operational with all the Covid-10 measures in place we cant afford another year of loss, he said.As talk of lockdown gains ground, traders from other states have stopped coming to Maharashtra to deal with farmers. Sangli-based farmer Ankush Chormule said markets for fruits like watermelon and musk melon have seen fall in sales. The government has not made any alternate market chain ready. What are farmers supposed to do if the existing markets are closed, he asked.Farmer leader and former MP Raju Shetti also spoke out against a lockdown, saying such a move will backfire on the economy. Other than fruits and vegetable growers, farmers who had invested in high-tech farming, like polyhouses or green houses, have also experienced heavy losses.Shetti said he has decided to meet state Chief Secretary Sitaram Kunte on Tuesday to discuss the issue.","Hit hard by lockdown last year, Maharashtra farmers oppose any such move to tackle second wave",ONION

That was not all. Since my mother, Thelma Gomez, hails from St. Andrews near Menamkulam in the capital city, she also used to make sweet hot cross buns, rich in spices like nutmeg, cloves, cinnamon and all-spice powder. St Andrews had a unique culture with traces of Portuguese influence and so she used to bake the hot cross buns for Easter. My paternal grandmother, Lydia Gomez, was the one who made the Indri appam (or Pesaha appam) and kurukku, which is also called pesaha paal, says Marina, a popular cookery instructor and blogger settled in Bengaluru.Myriad optionsAs with all things food, each region and Christian denomination in Kerala has its own flavours for Lent. What is common is the simple food that is usually served on Maundy Thursday and Good Friday after the church service is over. While it is invariably kanji (rice porridge) and payar (green mung) on Good Friday, on Maundy Thursday it is the Pesaha appam, an unleavened bread made of rice flour that is cooked in many Christian households all over Kerala.Pesaha appam or kurishappam | Photo Credit: Ammu Elizabeth JohnLent is a period of fasting, prayers and abstinence for many Christian families. Although Easter eggs and bunnies are getting increasingly popular, many families continue the tradition of making or buying Pesaha appams. Although we make Easter eggs, cakes and hot cross buns, what is much in demand is the Indri appam that is served on the day of Maundy Thursday, says Reina Thomas, one of the partners of Square One Homemade Treats, a popular bakery in Thiruvananthapuram.Marina says that since cakes are easier to make, many of the ethnic snacks that were traditionally made during the Holy Week have been forgotten as they involve a great deal of time consuming, laborious stirring and cooking, mostly with rice flour. To keep the tradition going, Marina makes it a point to make the Indri appam every year.Traditional treats St. Michels Bakery, Bread Fort, Ambrosia and Square One Home Treats make the hot cross buns that many of us are familiar with because of the popular nursery rhyme about it. Michel David, proprietor of St. Michels Bakery, makes both hot cross buns and hot cross bread. He says there is a clientle for it as some families have the buns or the bread with milk on Maundy Thursday. It is available on Wednesday and Thursday at the different outlets of the bakery.Prasobhithan S says Bread Fort will also be making about 20 to 25 hot cross buns and different kinds of breads for Maundy Thursday. As Square One Homemade Treats will be closed from Thursday for Easter, their hot cross buns and pesaha appam will be available on Wednesday.Preethi Abraham, a home cook, recalls that during her childhood in Ranni, Pathanamthitta, the service on Maundy Thursday used to be early in the morning at around 3 am. The Indri appam, made with rice flour and urad dal, was steamed, either in leaves like an ela ada or in a vessel. The Cross that we got for Palm Sunday is pressed into the middle. In the evening, after prayers, the eldest in the family would bless the appam, cut it and serve it to the others for dinner. It is dipped into a syrup that we called kuruma, also called paal in some places. The paal is made with jaggery and coconut milk, says Preethi. Nowadays, Preethi cooks the paal and a friend of hers makes the appam and they share it.Wayanad-based Babu Stephen, son of YouTuber Annamma Pulivelil aka Annamma chedathi (Annammachedathi Special) explains that in their parish, the Indri appam is steamed in banana leaves while the Pesaha appam is called Kurishu appam as it has the palm leaf cross embedded in the middle.Pesaha appam (unleavened bread) and paal are made on Maundy Thursday in many Christian homes in Kerala | Photo Credit: Bindu JoyTraditions prevailAll my siblings, and our children gather at our house since my mother stays with us. After prayers, it is the kurishu appam, made with a little sugar, that is cut by the eldest in the family and shared amongst all of us. Usually, after the service, this sharing of food was done in the church. This time, in accordance with the COVID-19 protocol, all of us in our parish have been told to conduct the prayers at home after the service, says Babu.Hot cross buns | Photo Credit: PexelsIn many homes in Kollam, the dough, made of rice flour, coconut and jaggery, is filled in vayana leaves (bay leaves) folded into cones and steamed, says Jessie Ignatius, a former school teacher from Kollam. However, my mother in Thrissur used to make pulikatha appam (unfermented appam) made without yeast. It is made with rice, urad dal, shallots and coconut and made as soon as the mixture was ground. My mother used to make the kurukku with rice powder, coconut milk, jaggery, a bit of ghee and roasted cumin. I used to love the flavour of the cumin in the kurukku, she says.Marina says that some people might add a bit of jaggery to the Pesaha appam and that gives it a brownish tone. And the paal could be seasoned with cardamom too. Kalathappam, a bread made in a pot, is also made on Maundy Thursday by some families. Made of rice flour and lightly spiced, there were fried shallots and coconut in it, she says.The flavouring agents and the names might differ but not the solemnity of the occasion when families break bread together for Maundy Thursday, symbolising the Last Supper of Jesus Christ.Recipe of Pesaha AppamIngredientsRice powder: 1 cupUrad dal: 3 table spoonCoconut grated: 1 cupGarlic: 1Small onion: 2Jeera: a pinchWater: 1 to 1 cupsMethodSoak urad dal for 30 minutes and grind it into a smooth paste by adding little water.

Just like last year, the Covid-19 pandemic has thrown a spanner in the celebrations with number of positive cases rising every day. However, it has not dulled the spirit of worshippers who are happy to attend the virtual services from home and share a meal with their families.Talking about the services being held over the Holy Week, Father MM Kennedy from St Francis Xavier Church in Yapral, says: Our services are being held both physically and virtually. We are following government restrictions and allowing only a certain number of worshippers inside the church so as to follow physical distancing. We have open grounds outside the church and that makes the process easier. We had the morning service which reminds us of Jesus instituting the Eucharist and priesthood.Besides these, we carry out the ritual of washing feet which symbolises work of the Lord as service to the people. Today, on Good Friday, we remember the passion and death of our Lord, and we marked the Way of The Cross (14 stations) by taking all safety precautions. During the evening, we will follow Veneration of The Cross. On Saturday, at around 10 pm, we will hold the night Easter vigil which marks the Resurrection of Jesus.Roydin Roach, who is the Telangana president of the All India Catholic Union, says: In Hyderabad, we saw a large number of people offering prayers on Good Friday while taking Covid-19 precautions. Many parishes are broadcasting their services online through their own YouTube channels or Facebook Live feature. Liturgy TV, Catholic Hub and Divyavani TV are a few of the channels which telecast all services, in Hindi and English, live from city churches. We saw tableau and plays enacted across churches on Good Friday. At a few places, only the actors were allowed on the church grounds, while worshippers watched them from home. The night Easter Vigil, which can go on till 1:30 am, is the most important service of Easter. It involves rituals like lighting the candles and sprinkling of holy water.Easter is also the time of feasting for those who have been observing Lent fast for 40 days. Talking about the different dishes that are prepared during the fasting period and its culmination, Jacqueline Nicholas from Jackies Patisserie & Cafe says: My chicken roasts sell like hot cakes on Easter. Many followers do not eat meat during the 40-day period. The fasting ends after the Easter night service and people celebrate with chicken roasts along with grilled vegetables and Easter eggs. We have the tradition of eating hot cross buns and Kanji rice with various chutneys on Good Friday. The dish, to which no tadka is added, is prepared with rice, roasted moong dal and grated coconut. I made groundnut, onion and coconut chutneys to go with Kanji this year.Sujatha Stephen, who is a nutritionist with Yashodha Hospital, says that Easter is an auspicious festival for her family. Describing a typical Easter day at her home, she says: We start preparations for Easter after Good Friday. Due to the pandemic, we are not attending the early morning service at church and will be part of it virtually. In the pre-pandemic days, I used to go to St Georges Church. We would decorate the church with jasmine flowers. After the service, we would be offered Easter eggs which were boiled eggs with coloured shells. At home, we eat chocolate Easter eggs, cakes and a special meal. We marinate turkey in the morning and grill it to perfection. Later, at a lunch attended by friends and family, we serve it with either coconut rice or chicken biryani.

In fact, the real hero of Easter  apart from the Risen Christ himself  is the meat!As Easter is the culmination of 40 days of fasting and penitence, its only fair that the feast is one of grand indulgence. I remember how, growing up in the 70s and 80s in Madras (now Chennai), the season of Lent was a time of complete abstinence at home, when even eggs were off the menu. Stretching into 46 days (to include Holy Week), it was a time to embrace a variety of vegetarian dishes, pachchadis, pickles and vadams, which blended quite well with the onset of spring and summer. Surprisingly, this brief dalliance with vegetarianism would be quite spiritually uplifting, and I wouldnt really miss the meat  until Easter.But the dawn of Easter awakened the senses in more ways than one, and the first dish for breakfast on Easter morning was our cook Shankars green chicken kurma with soft, melt-in-the-mouth idlis. Lunch was a different story. But that kurma, with its profusion of fresh greens and succulent chicken pieces, brings back many fond memories of festivals and the coming together of family and friends. Now, with both my parents gone and community gatherings becoming increasingly rare, it is memories such as these that I find myself reliving often.Feast for the soulBack in the 80s, my family used to man one of the breakfast stalls at the CSI St. Thomas English Churchs annual thanksgiving festival, for the sole reason that our cook used to make the best chicken kurma. I still remember how, on the carnival day, Shankar would arrive at four in the morning to start his preparation, and soon the house would be filled with the aroma of fresh mint and coriander, till the chicken joined in and took it to a different level.My father was a stickler for punctuality and we would arrive at the church well ahead of time, chicken kurma, gas stove, cylinder and Shankar in tow. The freshly-made idlis, dosas and kurma would fly off the plates in a jiffy. By popular demand, we would repeat the idli-kurma treat for carol rounds and choir Sunday breakfasts. Every annual mission fundraiser sale would also feature this star dish.Fresh as a memoryRecently, I happened to delve deeper into the origin of the kurma (or korma, as it is called in the north), which has its roots in Mughlai cuisine. I was surprised to find that this particular green variant is quite popular in the Nilgiris and the surrounding hilly regions of Kongu Nadu. A staple of the tribal Badaga kitchen, the recipe is unique as no powdered masalas are used  its only whole spices and fresh herbs. And the fresher the coriander and mint, the greener the kurma. These little bits of information fit in so neatly, like the missing piece of a jigsaw puzzle, as our cook too was from Coimbatore.I still have Shankars recipe. I remember writing it down as he narrated it the very year I was married. Now my daughter thinks its the only worthwhile dish in my rather limited repertoire of culinary exploits. I make it only for Christmas and Easter.Sunday recipeGreen chicken kurmaIngredients1/2 coconut, grated or cut into small pieces5 sliced onions7 green chillies2 tbsp ginger & garlic paste (freshly ground)1/2 a bunch fresh mint leaves (pudhina)1/2 a bunch fresh coriander leaves2 tomatoes3 bay leaves2 inches cinnamon sticks1 tbsp fennel seeds4 cloves3 cardamoms3 star aniseCurry leaves1 kg chickenSalt to tasteMethod1.

2021-04-08,https://indianexpress.com/article/india/dip-in-exports-pushes-onion-prices-down-7264987/,"This year, exporters fear that chances of the bulb being exported are slim. (Represenational Image)Higher freight charges and newer certification norms have slowed down onion exports, which has seen average traded price of the bulb fall in wholesale markets in Maharashtra. With rabi and late Kharif onions arriving at the same time, most wholesale markets have reported arrivals of around 20,000-25,000 quintals of onions per day.Indian onions have some established markets, especially in Middle Eastern countries, Indonesia, Sri Lanka and the United Kingdom, among others. Exports happen round the year, but the rabi crop  sown in December- January and harvested post-March  comprises majority of the export basked due to lower moisture content and longer shelf life of the bulb.But this year, exporters fear that chances of the bulb being exported are slim.Suresh Deshmukh, a commission agent operating out of Dindori wholesale market in Nashik district, cited increased certification needs for traditional markets like Indonesia and United Kingdom as roadblocks for exports to those countries. Starting this fiscal, these countries have mandated Global Good Agricultural Practices certification for export consignments. This was not necessary for onions and few farms would be eligible for this, he said.GAP certificate is given to farms which adhere to certain agricultural practices prescribed by auditing agencies. This includes adhering to a certain schedule for the usage of fertilisers and other inputs, and the certificate is granted after an audit. Vegetable and horticulture crops have mandatory certifications, which has prompted farmers to adopt these agricultural practices. According to Deshmukh and other exporters, onion farmers usually do not adhere to these practices and thus chances of them getting the certificate are slim.An unusual increase in freight charges and unavailability of containers have also stopped the flow of exports from the country. Deshmukh pointed out how freight charges, which were around Rs 3 per kg a year ago, has since then increased to Rs 6 per kg this year. Due to the global disruption in cargo movements, containers are also hard to get, which has put brakes on exports.Consequently, wholesale rates of onions in most markets in Nashik district have slumped even as farmers continue to harvest and bring their rabi and late Kharif produce. At Lasalagons wholesale market in Niphad taluka, the average traded price of the bulb is now between Rs 775-800 per quintal. Back in February, the price was around Rs 3,358 per quintal.Suvarna Jagtap, chairman of Lasalgaons wholesale market, acknowledged that the present situation was due to lack of exports. If exports pick up, then prices can improve a lot, she said.",Dip in exports pushes onion prices down,ONION

Each trip focusses on a single ingredient and the chefs use their imagination to create dishes that elevate the simple into something striking  all to be paired with the Krug Grand Cuve and Krug Ros. In 2018, they travelled to Mallorca where fish was the focus. 2019 saw Oaxaca and its piquant pepper taking centrestage. Last year, just before the pandemic put an end to international travel, 11 chefs visited India, specifically Jaipur, to celebrate the humble onion.Julie Cavil, Krugs new chef de cave (she took on the role early last year) explains that each excursion is similar to the maisons Champagne-making philosophy, of paying close attention to the vineyards character and of respecting the individuality of each plot and its wine so as to allow each years cuve to shine.Krugs new chef de cave, Julie Cavil | Photo Credit: Special ArrangementA winning cuve2020s epicurean getaway  with names such as Tristin Farmer, executive head chef of Michelin two-star Singapore restaurant Zn, and Hiroyuki Kanda, owner-chef of Michelin three-star restaurant, Kanda, in Tokyo  had an Indian in the ranks. Chef Prateek Sadhu, the chef-partner at Mumbais Masque restaurant, is the first Indian chef ambassade for Krug. Obviously, it was a huge honour. It was so humbling just to be around all these amazing and great chefs, he exclaims, recalling celebrating Holi in Samode, eating dal baati churma in Jaipurs street stalls and enjoying flutes of Krug Grande Cuve in the midst of onion fields. His restaurant is one of the few in India to serve Krug.Given its price tag (21,462 for a bottle of Grand Cuve in Mumbai), Krug is a niche product. Mot and Chandon, which retails for about 8,163 (in Mumbai), is the front-runner in Indias Champagne market.Pink City guide Sadhu donned the role of de facto tour guide in Jaipur. I felt an unsaid responsibility and kept saying, Let me take over, let me tell you, let me do this, he recalls. After a day spent in the city, they discussed parallels in cooking in each ones culture, such as dried fish  be it bonito flakes that are an integral part of Japanese cooking or coastal Indias preservation of fish as suke. However, the highlight of the trip was introducing chefs that are on top of their game, running these top Michelin-starred restaurants to kachoris and a kite-flying experience!Distributors share that the bubbly hasnt seen the kind of growth that other segments such as spirits and beers have over the last couple of years, because every bottle, with its attendant taxes, has to be imported. As a result, Krug is targeted at HNWIs (high net worth individuals) who are willing to pay for quality.However, Sadhu, says the maisons offerings are a great fit for Indian food. By avoiding malolactic fermentation (MLF) in which the tart malic acid, naturally present in freshly-crushed grape juice, is converted to a softer-tasting lactic acid, the final pour still tastes fresh and vibrant. And therefore pairs well with the food that we serve at Masque, where the flavours are very Indian.Chef Prateek Sadhu | Photo Credit: Edouard NguyenAllium talesMeanwhile, for the brand at large, 2020 was about moving online. Cavil says, Last year, we quickly adapted to the situation with digital experiences called Krug Connect, which allowed us to continue to host events and reach out to our network of Krug Lovers while respecting social distancing. We also worked closely with chef partners to create videos, tutorials and social media takeovers so people could get to know the chefs while also having a more inspiring culinary experience at home.Plating up Sadhus Krug x onion collab was a lamb tripe dish with braised Madras onions, topped with red onion oil and katlam (a flaky Kashmiri bread). He says the idea stemmed from a dish his mother made (using tripe, chillies and praan, a wild shallot found in high altitudes).Ultimately though, it is the onion that created the best memories. Ambassade Angus McIntosh Jr, executive chef of The Farm at Brush Creek Ranch (Saratoga, Wyoming) remembers how his father would smell of onions when he would hug him after work. To this day, the scent comes back to me every time I come into the kitchen and put on my apron, he says. For Sicilian chef Ciccio Sultana, the allium brings a moment of self-identification. I like to think I identify with the onion. My homeopath even tells me I share its sulphurous character; I like to lead but I do it with love to create an environment where people enjoy what they do rather than follow orders, he concludes.",Krug’s onion chronicles,ONION

""Last year, our plight was totally ignored by the government. We hardly got any aid and had to either live on debt or do other odd jobs,"" says Bhaskar, a semi-wholesale onion trader.The standoff between the officials and traders, which started in the morning, continued till evening as traders braving the hot sun and surrounded by cops continued their protest after assurances by Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority and Housing secretary that their demand will be considered.A market management committee official told TNIE that the solution is being worked out and the final decision rests with the Chief Secretary, who is currently not in the city. The decision will be announced on Monday.It is learnt that MMC officials are working out an even and odd blueprint where a section of shops will be allowed to open on a given day and another section of shops on the next day. This way there will be no loss of livelihood and social distancing will be maintained.S Chandran, Market management Committee Licensed Merchants Association President and Anaithu Sangankalin Kootamaippu general secretary, told TNIE that traders association also met higher officials in Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority to ensure the ban is not enforced. ""Currently, the public is banned from entering the market and almost 70 per cent of people below the age of 18 have been inoculated. All the precautions are being taken. The retail traders have already been impacted by the lockdown and the government should ensure their livelihoods are not lost,"" he said.He said the traders have nothing to do with the spread of the second wave of the pandemic. ""It was the politicians and the election campaign which was the cause of the rise in a pandemic. The authorities should have been strict in ensuring that social distancing norms are maintained and masks were made mandatory,"" he said.The retail trade in the Koyambedu market was closed on April 27 and the entire market on May 5. The retailers were allowed to restart business on November 16 but with restrictions. Initially, the business was dull and recently trade has been picking up.""I had lost Rs 5 lakh when the lockdown was implemented as I could not locate those who had purchased goods from me. Business was shut and I have to live on cash reserves which was depleting,"" says Bhaskar.Koyambedu Vegetable, Fruits and Flower Merchant association president Thiagarajan said that business has been hit badly due to Covid-19. ""Only half the business compared to pre-Covid time is happening and at this juncture, a clamp on retail trade would impact badly. Most of them had already downed shutters due to debt following seven months of lockdown,"" he said.","Amid coronavirus surge, Koyambedu retail traders up in arms over clamp",ONION

Usually, the market gets around 1,000 vehicles of agriculture produce. Now, it is expected to increase to 1,300- 1,400 vehicles.Farmers are desperate to sell their produce due to the current situation and hence they would bring produce in large quantity, officials from the market said. We can't predict the rates scenario as we can't rule out the possibility of panic buying on Monday, he added.The similar situation is expected to prevail in other wholesale markets across the district, said the officials.Vegetable markets in Kolhapur city are expected to be flooded with supply on Monday as the harvested vegetables have been piling up in the backyards of the farmers due to the weekend lockdown. The farmers will bring their produce to the citys mandis on Monday.Despite allowing vegetable and fruit vendors to operate, most markets and roadside vegetable vendors decided to observe the lockdown. The citizens, abiding by the law, too stayed indoors.As per the government orders, farming operations were allowed to continue. The farmers had expected the mandis to remain open. They had thought that citizens would be coming to buy vegetables.Eknath Pawar, a vegetable grower in Shirol, said, I went to Kolhapur to sell vegetables expecting the mandis to be open. However, most of the markets were shut. Moreover I was not allowed to sell my produce in the residential areas as police and locals said that there will be crowding if I set up shop on the society premises. I am heading to Shirol on Monday. Once the markets open on Monday, many farmers will flock to the mandis to sell their produce and the prices will crash.

They had got some soft, sesame seed topped buns, and ordered pork patties from Meatigo.I began dreaming about this: creamy mayo slathered over a piece of bun, onion rings, perhaps a slice of tomato over it. A juicy patty on that, a crisp lettuce leaf and another soft bun on top. The problem was that we didnt have any buns, and it was too late to have them delivered.But burgers had been promised to two young people at home  one visiting Delhi for the first time. So, I turned to my good friend, the internet, and chanced upon a place called Boss Burger. I liked the different kinds of burgers it offered, and was further encouraged by the fact that it has branches across the city. With the help of Swiggy, we placed our order.The youngsters like chicken, so for them we asked for two OG Chicken Burgers (518 for two). They are also fond of hot food, so we added a Crispy Peri Peri Chicken Burger (299). A Crispy Fish Fillet Burger (349) and what seemed rather interesting  a Mutton Ghee Roast Burger (369).The burgers arrived just when the mice in the stomach had started kicking up a real shindy. The boxes were encouraging  strong, well packed cartons, which contained the burger, as well as sauces and napkins. Without much ado, we got down to business.The young ones were happy with their burgers  brioche wrapped around melted cheese and chicken topped with a hot sauce. The hot peri peri chicken was even better. The chicken and cheese patty had been doused with garlic aioli and a spicy sauce. The fish fillet burger, which came with tartar sauce, was disappointing. The patty was crisp from the outside, but sadly soggy within.My mutton ghee roast burger, however, was delicious, with its fusion flavours. The patty had been prepared in the Mangalorean style  slow cooked and then garnished with curry leaf flavoured mayo. It had a taste of soft onions that I really liked, and, overall, the patty cooked with Indian spices went rather well with the soft, bland buns.My last happy burger meal was when I had ordered in from Akus, which has some outstanding burgers with blue cheese, wild mushrooms, jalapenos, caramelized onions and more.Boss Burgers menu is comprehensive, too. For vegetarians, it offers Aloo Rataloo (sweet potato patty with mozzarella cheese, garlic aioli and chutney), Spicy BBQ Paneer, Quinoa & Veggie (quinoa-crusted roasted root vegetable patty, topped with sriracha mayo and saunth chutney) and Holy Guacamole! Black Bean Burger.Meat lovers can have its Truffled 3 Cheese Tenderloin Burger (grilled tenderloin and cheese patty, topped with truffled aioli and pickles, served in a sesame brioche bun) and a Chicken Tikka Burger. There are fries, chicken nuggets, wings and various kinds of shakes on the menu.All in all, we had a nice meal, indeed. But now I need to order in some buns and patties.

Last Monday, we had received 24,700 quintals of the same. Today (Monday), it was 7,938 quintals more than last Monday. This is adequate to meet Pune and Pimpri Chinchwads requirements. We expect vegetable prices to remain stable in local mandis.Rates of all vegetables and fruits remained stable. Onion was sold in the Rs5 to Rs12 per kg range and potato was also sold in the range of Rs6 to Rs16 per kg. Rates of leafy vegetables were also in the normal bracket. A bunch of coriander was sold in the Rs5 to Rs12 range, fenugreek was in the Rs7 to Rs12 range and spinach was in the Rs4 to Rs10 bracket.Talking about the crowd management, Garad said, We have banned domestic purchase at the market, in view of the increasing crowd here. Also, small-time vendors, who sell the produce on handcarts and set up stalls in the market, too have been stopped. Restaurants on our campus have been told to provide parcel service.Shivlal Bhosale, a commission agent, said, It will be a difficult task for the administration to control the crowd at the market as thousands of them will be working together daily. A section of the commission agents said that the APMC could resort to last years strategy of running each section on alternate days. The measure had controlled the crowd significantly in the market, a commission agent said.While another agent said last years measure would go against the farmers as they wouldnt be able to sell their harvest quickly. Many farmers could not sell their produce last year because of this system, the agent said.Wholesale rates of flowers remain stableRates of flowers remained stable in Gultekdis flower markets on Monday, said Bala Sewale, head of the flower section. There was adequate supply of all flowers. Hence, there was no change in the rates.

The restaurant, which boasts a food menu conceived by Michelin-starred Chef Atul Kochhar of Benares, London fame, and executed by Chef Tanvi Goswami, has just introduced an Experience Menu, curated by Kochhar, Available only on Sundays, it is a reflection of SAGAs food philosophy, weaving together the myriad flavours of the country into a nine-course meal that celebrates Indias rich culinary legacies in clean contemporary settings. Speaking of settings, the restaurant itself is stunning, sprawling over three floors and an al fresco area, with the focal point being a bar that towers up through the entire restaurant, requiring mixologists to travel up and down using lifts and pulleys.All of that spectacle is reinforced by some truly stellar cocktails, but more on those later. Going back to the food, Kochhar says, Through this menu we would like to give an experience, which is culturally rich and speaks volume of our heritage and love for food. The menu is brought to life keeping in mind different palates, touching key dishes from our a la carte offerings and also giving unparalleled dining experience. The Chefs Experience menu includes some of the best-selling dishes from the a la carte menu such as Crispy Crab, Ghee Roast Prawn, Sali Murg, Bhuna Mangsho, Edamame and Quinoa, Khari Paneer Tikka along with special dishes created for it, all washed down by a chilled glass of crisp Prosecco and live music by a violinist who traipses through the various floors and mezzanines of the space.Going with the non-vegetarian menu, we are pleased to make the acquaintance of dishes like the aforementioned crab and prawn. The fo rme r comprises a crackling soft shell crab (we recommend downing it in one bite if you have a large enough mouth and or a disdain for decorum), with dollops of saffron-spiked cream and a mustardy catsup, while the latter comes taco style, the Mangalorean prawn dish, scented with fennel and curry leaves, resting on a tortilla shell as delicate as a ballerinas ankles and just as tenacious, gamely managing to contain the shellfish as one wolfs it down.Helping us wash down this surfeit of seafood is the delicious Indo-Negroni, which gives a distinctly desi twist to the classic cocktail with cumin and citrus flavours. Next, we dally with the Himalayan Flavours (a Nepalese-inspi red Roas t Chicken Salad fired up with timur pepper and tart tomatoes) and Lentil Love (comprising slow-cooked lentils fortified with onion and garlic and served in a tart shell which gives the otherwise simple legumes a more complex texture and crumble, making it all the more welcome). We also take a dip in the Lonar Lake, a signature cocktail of SAGA that is a medley of gin, Aperol (an Italian bitter), Orgeat syrup and sparkling wine, perfumed with kaffir lime leaves.Swimming may be out this year but this is definitely something we could dive into again and again. In the interest of brevity, we shall refrain from further details, but suffice it to say that the main courses, which included Sali Murg (Parsi Chicken), Bhuna Mangsho (Bengali style goat mutton) and the Family Affair (a multi-grain khichdi for the whole family to pass around), were each delicious and individual in their own way. For desserts, there is the Petha (an ambrosial cloud of rabadi festooned with orange jelly, winter melon candy and rose) and the Pilgrims Sweet (a platter packed with plum cake, Panchamarat ice-cream, date treacle and wheat halwa).

This pandemic has brought with it a massive awareness about eating fresh and healthy food to boost immunity and keep illnesses away.Sattvic food  a high fibre and low-fat vegetarian diet as per the principles of Ayurveda, earlier preferred by a few, is increasingly becoming a popular choice among masses. This is evident from the number of dedicated sattvic food restaurants that have cropped up in the recent past.Consisting of fruits and vegetables that are natures source of detoxification, the sattvic diet basically focuses on eating food that is provided to us by nature  seasonal fruits and vegetables, nuts and seeds and non-meat products. A sattvic diet is pure, natural, easy to digest and energy-enhancing, says dietician Shweta Shah.Basil Paneer Tikka, SattvikMore people than ever before are adopting a Sattvic diet. Based on Ayurvedic principles, it is even devoid of onion and garlic, says Amit Juneja, CEO, Annakoot, that opened its third outlet in Delhi last year. The Lajpat Nagar outlet not just offers sattvic Indian and Chinese dishes but sattvic freshly baked cookies as well. We began with one outlet at Preet Vihar. In a few months after opening, sensing the public demand, we opened one each at Bengali Market and Lajpat Nagar. People have enthusiastically adopted the sattvic way of living and believe in the benefits of sattvic food, reveals Juneja.India is culturally inclined to vegetarianism, and especially now with more attention towards immunity-building to beat the coronavirus, people are turning towards a green and clean diet, says nutritionists. People are moving towards sattvic as they are becoming more aware of the benefits of a healthy and a pure diet, and though we cannot ascribe an age group to it, even the younger generation now understands the impact of consuming meat on their health as well as the environment, says Ritika Arora, Director, Sattvik that opened at Select City Walk in 2007 and continues to remain popular. We had started it as a place to provide Indian vegetarian food, embodying the spirit of sattva, she adds.Innately Indian preparations like dal, rice, chapati, vegetables in basic masala are all sattvic. And since its all about the ingredients being used, a lot of dishes from different othercuisines can be made in a sattvic way. In fact, one can also make Chinese and other Asian cuisine in a sattvic way with a little imagination!Though there have been some religious communities who have been consuming only sattvic diet since generations, the pandemic brought to light the unhealthy effects of fast food, notes Juneja, adding, People now realise that food that is not freshly made with natural and pure ingredients is harmful to the body and impedes the immune system.Agrees Shah: Sattvik food can help attain not just optimum physical and mental health, but also spiritual health. It boosts digestion, improves your gut system, builds immunity and strengthens the body from within.Can it be the food of the future?Yes, definitely. With people becoming more inclined towards animal safety and environment-friendly products, we may soon see a shift in the pattern of food consumption. The pandemic has already created panic and increased self-consciousness with regards to the food we consume, says Arora. Sattvic has been here for thousands of years, and it will become more prominent with time, says Juneja, with confidence.",In the spirit of Sattva,ONION

For all the perfectly shaped fruits and vegetables that we buy from the green grocers, there are thousands left on their stalks to rot unharvested in the field simply because they do not meet the aesthetic criteria of retailers.Mumbai-based foodtech innovator Science 4 Society (S4S) Technologies has been working to cut down on this waste by promoting solar dehydration as a way to preserve such produce. In the wake of the lockdown, the company, founded in 2014 by young entrepreneur Vaibhav Tidke along with collegemates Ganesh Bhere, Tushar Gaware, Shital Somani, Ashwin Pawade, Nidhi Pant and Swapnil Kokate, has empowered 2,700 women farmers and 200 micro-entrepreneurs near Aurangabad by training them in dehydration of natural produce.They do this through the patented Solar Conduction Dryer (SCD), a portable solar-powered machine that dries vegetables and spices while retaining nutrients.When we started, the business model was about selling our dehydration equipment to farmers. But we realised eventually that what most farmers want is an alternate source of income during the dry season. Thats how we pivoted, and rather than just providing technology, we started buying back the produce in 2018. So we are now not just selling the machine, but also the food dehydrated by it, says company co-founder Nidhi Pant in a telephone interview from Mumbai.The technology won S4S the 2020 Ashden Award for Energy and Livelihoods, supported by the Waterloo Foundation, UK. It has been installed in 1,200 sites and is used in France, Jamaica, Nepal, Vietnam, Sri Lanka, Kenya and Bangladesh, besides India.Components of the dehydrator vary according to the size and model selected, though all of them are designed to be user-friendly, especially for women. We give a cutting machine, a primary processing dryer and solar conduction dryer in our package. The equipment is non-electrical, as power outages are quite common in villages. It is as simple to use as a domestic mixer or grinder. Our dehydrator helps to maintain moisture, colour and aroma, and completes the process in six to seven hours, to minimise microbial growth, says Nidhi.Four machines with a capacity of 200 kilograms output, cost around 1,40,000. Purchasing the equipment isnt mandatory, as it can also be hired by farmers through financial assistance.Mutual benefitThe companys twin-pronged business model works with growers and women processors in villages. S4S Technologies procures the B and C grade produce (that has been rejected by commercial retail sales because of its non-standard appearance) and delivers it to the women who have been trained in the dehydration process. Since 2019, we have been ensuring that the farmers earn an assured income from our work for at least nine months of the year, says Nidhi.S4S trains women farmers in clusters of 20 per village guided by a field executive, to work on their dehydration projects. The decision to target women agriculturalists was conscious, she says. Due to the water shortage in the Marathwada region, the growing season is limited to four months of monsoon here. Male farmers are more likely to migrate in search of work elsewhere during the dry season, while the womenfolk are usually left behind. Operating our dehydration equipment allows women farmers to earn from the comfort of their homes. Besides, women are more open to trying new things, she says.Sunita Dhyaneshwar Muthe, 30, from Khamkheda village in Nashik district, Maharashtra, is one of the many micro-entrepreneurs who have learned to become financially independent with the help of S4S work. I am from a farming family that grows maize, cotton and bajra. For the past three years, instead of working in the nearby factory during the dry season, I have been drying garlic, turmeric and onion on a contractual basis for S4S at home. I have earned up to 50,000 last year, which helped us buy seeds, repay vehicle loans and budget other household expenses. Earlier, we would have to borrow money at high interest rates just to buy seeds, she says.Building stabilityAmol Padul, an S4S agriculture extension officer, says his mother, Prabhavati from Hatmali village was among the earliest women agriculturalists to get trained in the project. My mother started with farming and dehydrating beetroot, ginger and other crops for S4S. She was able to educate me in a city college and fulfil other family responsibilities with her income as a micro-entrepreneur. I feel we have regained some of our self-respect with this kind of ancillary skill, he says.The S4S solar dehydrator is a non-electrical device that helps to preserve natural produce.

2021-04-22,https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/pune/how-a-group-of-cane-growers-grew-a-company-from-scratch-7285155/,"Hailing from families of farmers whose main source of income was the cane crop, these men knew the crop like the back of their hand, Chormule said. (File)In November 2019, when Ankush Chormule and his five fellow directors decided to launch Ganna Master  the speciality product aimed at better per acre yield for cane farmers, they had almost zero experience of markets. What they had was immense on field practical knowledge about the cane crop.Chormule and his fellow directors were traditional cane growers across the cane belt of South Maharashtra and North Karnataka and by virtue of their agricultural practices, were champion farmers. As against the normal 50-60 tonnes per acre, our individual acreage was around 100 tonnes per acre. What we aimed to do with the Ganna Master Kit was share our package of practices with farmers so that they, too, can increase per acre yield, said Chormule, whose family grows cane over nine acres in the village of Ashta in Walva taluka of Sangli district.Even before they hit the markets, Chormule, who has a PhD in agricultural entomology, and his team was working with cane growers in Maharashtra, Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh. Through their Facebook group Hoy Amhi Shetkari (HAM), the team has been in touch with over 4 lakh cane growers across the sugar producing states.Hailing from families of farmers whose main source of income was the cane crop, these men knew the crop like the back of their hand, Chormule said. Sugar mills pay farmers per tonne of cane procured, so higher the tonnage, higher the paymentBesides basic minerals and nitrogen fixers, cane requires boosters and micro-nutrients to enable better growth and increase per acre tonnage. In our personal fields, we take spraying of amino acid, fulvic acid and cytokinins to accelerate the vegetative growth of cane, he said. Similarly, potassium humate,vitamins and organic phosphates have given a good result in increasing the girth ratio and preventing cane from lodging, Chormule said. The directors, most of whom are administrators of Hoy Ami Shetkari group, have been guiding farmers through their Facebook page on how to improve agricultural practices.Of course, these act like tonics, the farmer should ensure the basic remains strong and he adheres to proper planning for the crop, he said.The team is advised by a retired soil scientist form the Mahatma Phule Agricultural University. Besides Chormule, the team includes Suresh Kabade, Amol Patil, Prakash Khot, Vijay Magdum and Prasad Pawar.While working with farmers, the group had zeroed in on five chemicals, which gave the best result. The final kit has Master root, Master Bonus, Master Growth and Master Speed to be either sprayed or applied through water. Applied individually, these would cost Rs 1,000 per application but the Kit offers them same at Rs 2,600. Before going on the stalls, the kits were distributed free-of-cost to farmers to be applied over 300 acres. The results were very successfulin fact, it was enough for us to launch our company, he said. Before joining the company, Chormule was on the staff of a Singapore-based input company but resigned to join the Ganna Master Agro Industries Private Limited.The company started with a modest investment of Rs 10 lakh and directors working from their homes. Social media, especially Facebook, was the platform of choice for spreading the word. Our initial operations were restricted to the districts of Sangli and Kolhapur. But since then, we have spread to all the cane growing areas in Maharashtra, Karnataka and even in Uttar Pradesh, said Chormule.From selling 200 kits a month at first, the company now sells over 2,500 kits a month. The company has followed a very lean but organic model for growth. Our aim was to reach the farmer directly. So, we have managed to keep the overheads less, he said.Hailing from families whose main source of income was farming, the group understood the complex economics of agriculture perhaps better than any one else. We act as cane consultants but with firmer roots on the ground, said Chormule.Since its launch, the company has expanded its footprint and invested in packaging and a storehouse in Pune. This year, the company has launched on a trial basis Onion Master, Turmeric Master and Vegetable Master kits for other crops.",How a group of cane growers grew a company from scratch,ONION

Rajendran, president of TK Market wholesale vegetable traders Association.The wholesale prices of vegetables have fallen and some farmers and traders are unable to realise even the transport cost. For instance, the price of drumstick used to be 140 a kg. It is 8 to 10 a kg now, he says. The farmer should be get at least 12 a kg. Vegetable markets here get supplies from Karnataka and different parts of Tamil Nadu. The wholesale price of big onion on Thursday ranged between 10 and 15 a kg, that of small onion was 15 to 30 a kg, tomato 6 to 9 a kg, potato 16 a kg and cabbage 6 a kg. Except carrot, beans and cauliflower the other vegetables were selling at less than 20 a kg in the wholesale market.With high number of cases in Kerala, the wholesale traders here are unable to supply the usual volume to the neighbouring State. Most of the traders do not take delivery of the pre-Covid quantity. With the second wave of the pandemic in Coimbatore now, if the vegetable markets are shifted, the traders will be hit further, he says.Amirtharaj, a tomato farmer at Kinathukadavu, says that farmers spend 50,000 to 1 lakh on an acre to harvest tomatoes. This year, the rain was good, there was no problem of pest attack and the harvest was also good. When the farmers take the produce to the markets, the traders lift the vegetables. But, we do not get the prices. Almost throughout the last one year, we got just 100 to 300 for a box of 12 to 15 kg. Farmers are unable to meet the expenses with these prices, he says.Suresh, secretary of Anna market vegetable traders association, says that retail business has taken a hit at the market because of the pandemic, though vegetable prices are low. We will go back to operating just 50 % of the outlets on a rotation basis from Friday. Many people have taken to selling vegetables across the district and hence, sales at the market has dropped. Retail customers are also scared of visiting the market because of the pandemic, he says.",Covid spread takes a toll on vegetable trade,ONION

And even as we wait for the tide to turn and for vaccinations to catch up, we have to reckon with another rising risk, that of mucormycosis adding to the danger of Covid-19, said Dr Atul Patel, infectious disease specialist, Sterling Hospital, Ahmedabad.Mucormycosis is a fungal infection that has a high mortality rate of 50 per cent and an increasing number of Covid-19 patients have been developing this infection while still at the hospital or after discharge, he told indianexpress.com.Here are four things you should know about this infection, some of the common symptoms of which include sinusitis, blackish nasal discharge, facial pain, headaches, and pain around the eyes.Both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with Covid-19 may be at riskPatients who have been hospitalised for Covid-19 and particularly those who require oxygen therapy during Covid-19 illness are at a much higher risk of mucormycosis. However, we have also observed some cases of mucormycosis in patients with an asymptomatic Covid-19 infection who were not even aware of their diagnosis. This is why everyone needs to be aware of the symptoms of mucormycosis so that they can watch out for them, said Dr Patel.ALSO READ | Fact check: Can eating raw onion with rock salt cure COVID-19?Diabetes and Covid-19 increase the risk of mucormycosisBefore the pandemic, patients with uncontrolled diabetes were at a higher risk of mucormycosis because the high blood sugar levels made it easier for the fungi to grow and survive, and their weaker immune systems offered less protection against the infection. During the pandemic, if infected by the virus, the risk of mucormycosis rises for these patients for two reasons. First is that Covid-19 further impairs their immune system and second, they are given corticosteroids for their treatment it leads to a rise in their blood sugar level thus increasing their risk of mucormycosis. This combination of diabetes and Covid-19, therefore, becomes a dangerous and deadly challenge to manage, he explained.People with diabetes need to be extremely careful.

However, the critical factor is that treatment must be given quickly and promptly to reduce the possibility of serious consequences.Research is currently underway to understand more about the association between mucormycosis and Covid-19. Nonetheless, it is vital that we continue to keep our guard up, be alert to any possible symptom and get the necessary medical treatment as quickly as possible.

With veganism, plant-based diets and sustainable living gaining momentum, the use of jackfruit is being reimagined all over the world. Especially in India, where it is a familiar summer fruit.When Goa-based entrepreneur Sairaj Dhond decided to launch a food business five months ago, he chose to focus on jackfruit. The brand, Wakao Foods, began with a range of heat-and-eat products  jack patty, teriyaki, barbecue and even butter chicken-inspired butter jack. The best seller is the jack burger patty and he is currently working on developing a range of desserts from raw jackfruit. It retails online, and has physical stores in Goa, Maharashtra, Telangana, and New Delhi. Chennai and Bengaluru are next on his list.Jackfruit burger | Photo Credit: Wakao FoodsThe fact that it is a tasty cruelty-free alternative to meat works in its favour, he says, refusing to narrow down its definition to mock-meat. He aims to carve an independent identity for the fruit with his brand It is a superfood. We are sitting on something of so much value, and so little is being done with it. Jackfruit is found in almost every backyard in Goa, more of it goes to waste than use. It is underrated and taken for granted. I want to take it across the country, says Sairaj. The other states he sources from, besides Goa, are Kerala, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu.Prized fruitWorld over, however, jackfruit has been touted as a healthy substitute for meat. In Bengal, it is even called gach patha, which translates to tree goat as the unripe pods are used as a substitute for mutton. It is cooked on special occasions too. The non-vegetarian version, when cooked with onion and garlic, is very popular. Another famous variant is cooking with prawns or shutki (dried fish), says Kolkata-based Sunindita Chatterjee, who is into business process outsourcing, adding that it is the perfect substitute for meatless days. Her favourite is the faux mutton curry.While it is prized for its flavour, and sweetness when eaten ripe in the southern States, it is used more as a vegetable [kathal] in the north. Raw jackfruit goes into kathal ki sabzi, another popular take is kathal biryani. In Bihar, it is made in the style of a kala mutton curry  a dish made with whole and ground spices, cooked over low flame. Raw jackfruit pieces are fried and then curried. Jackfruit cutlets [like shammi kebabs] are another popular way of consuming it, says homemaker, Jayati Sinha of Patna.Jackfruit biriyaniFound in Maharashtra, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Goa, Bihar, West Bengal, Odisha and Assam, it is a vegetable/fruit that can be consumed nose to tail, as architect and culinary enthusiast Tsarina Abrao Vacha puts it. Raw or ripe  almost every part of it, including the seed, minus the rind, can be eaten. In Kerala, no part of the chakka (jackfruit in Malayalam) goes to waste. It is eaten in so many forms  from a vegetable stir fry to chips. The fruit is also eaten in so many ways; besides the ripe fruit, jackfruit is also made into preserves, payasam and snacks. But, I believe, it is not being used as much as it should be or could be, she says.Tree Goat Biryani The highlight of the banquet for Chennai-based restaurateur NS Krishnamoorthys daughters wedding recently was the range of dishes made from jackfruit. Biryani, sukka, roast, jackfruit seed curry and even the dessert  mukkani thaen (banana, jackfruit and ripe mangoes in honey). Needless to say that everyone who attended the wedding will remember the spread, chuckles Krishnamoorthy, of Prems Grama Bhojanam.Sous chef D Murugan, of Malgudi  The Savera (Chennai), has perfected jackfruit biryani. We use tender, raw jackfruit which weighs around 750 to 800 grams. Only then we would get the desired texture and taste. It is flavourful because the jackfruit absorbs the masala, looks and tastes just like mutton, he says of his Ambur style biryani.This mock meat biryani is trending as it is vegan, and is enjoyed by the health-conscious too, says Krishnamoorthy, who calls it a treat for vegetarians.During the lockdown, in 2020, jackfruit was widely consumed and experimented with in Kerala when there was a scarcity of fresh vegetables in grocery stores. Traditionally, most Kerala homes have a tree in the backyard. With each tree, which grows organically, giving 50-100 kilos or more of fruit every summer, there is always enough for the household, neighbours and friends.Pride of KeralaIn 2018, jackfruit was declared the State fruit of Kerala, celebrated for its high nutritional value. Kerala boasts several varieties broadly classified into two varieties  varikka (firm fleshed) and koozha (soft-fleshed). Since the State has trees that grow naturally, there arent too many plantations. The State Agriculture Department is promoting its procurement, trade and processing.Even the rind is not discarded, says Sreelakshmi Prabhu, a MasterChef India contestant [Season 5] and home cook. Kochi-based Sreelakshmis ancestors migrated to Kochi from the Konkan coast.The rind of the tender jack is eaten, deep-fried. The leaf is also used to cook. For Ugadi, we steam idlis in them. The tree is important to us. We dry and preserve the rags [which hold the fleshy avril to the rind], use it as kondattam [crispy fries]. Tender jack, deep-fried and dipped in a mix of rice powder, chilli and turmeric and asafoetida tastes as good as fish! she says.Chennai restaurateur NS Krishnamoorthy of Prems Grama Bhojanam says, If not biryani, sukka or curry, people at least make palakottai (jackfruit seed) sambar, and in villages it is usually made along with drumsticks, mango and brinjal. It is a rural delicacy, and you have to taste it to believe it! At the restaurant jackfruit biryani and sukka are made every weekend on pre-orders.When the vegetable is raw or semi-ripe, it does not have a distinct taste, unlike the ripe fruit. The neutral flavour is its USP. It takes on the taste of the spice or ingredient that is added to it, the reason it works as mock meat. The stringy-ness of the flesh and meat-like texture enhances the similarity to meat. I have used it even as a savoury filling for ravioli besides burger patties and barbecue too, says Rajeev Menon former executive chef Crowne Plaza (Kochi), food coach and restaurant consultant.The global superfoodIt is underestimated and ignored, wasted and fed to cattle... it is now in focus when we are conscious about plant-based foods which positively impacts the planet, says Kochi-based Tsarina, who still remembers her first encounter with a contemporary jackfruit dish.Jack in tacos | Photo Credit: Wakao FoodsIt was in 2008, at a vegetarian caf in Zurich. A tart with grilled pulled jack and shards of cheese it was so different from how I knew it was cooked, she says. She has been using it as a vegetable, fruit and flour in her cooking  in souffl, baos, cakes, pies and even cheesecake. She adds it to her sourdough bread mix, with the flour. James Joseph, who came up with the idea of making flour out of jackfruit [branded as Jackfruit 365], says it is an energy-dense food, a replacement for vegetables and fruit. The flour is vegetable in powder form  one tablespoon is equivalent to a serving of vegetables. It has properties that help with blood sugar management, he says. Jackfruits protein and fibre keep its glycemic index low.The flour is dehydrated, powdered jackfruit which extends its shelf life and lends itself to use in various ways  added to dosa batter, chapati dough, dal or any other dish. All the jackfruit he uses is sourced from across Kerala. The jackfruit season starts first in the southern tip of Kerala, the other parts of the State follow. It does not happen all at once, so for almost eight-nine months a year, we have more than enough supply locally to match demand. I have suppliers who can get me 200 tonnes of jack per day; we process only 10 tonnes per day. The demand for flour has increased since October 2020, he says.He uses semi-ripe jackfruit, as the raw ones are exported  to other parts of India and abroad, and ripe ones to Tamil Nadu. All the jackfruit used is sourced from homesteads  uncultivated or wild jackfruit as Joseph calls it.(Inputs from Chitradeepa Anantharam)","The humble jackfruit gets its due, it’s uses are being re-imagined in modern and more contemporary ways",ONION

He is an authority on climate change and sustainable development, while she is a skincare specialist and fashionista. In this candid and freewheeling chat, Turkish Consul General Adnan Altay Altinors and his ever so beautiful wife Kubra Altinors open up on everything from biryani to baklava and Falaknuma to Istanbul. It was 60 minutes of sheer delight to hang out with the Turks. Excerpts:How has Hyderabad been treating you?Adnan AltayAltinors: This is the most common question we are asked and we usually dont know how to answer it because we have a lot of things to say. But so far, so good. Before we could come here, we were told that the people of Hyderabad are warm, friendly and hospitable. We saw this here, a lot of people became our friends, they invited us into their homes, to their events. Before the pandemic, we did not have the time to get bored, we were so occupied. Usually diplomats prefer to go to the Western countries, but in countries like Turkey and India, where hospitality is very important, one really has a good time.Kubra Altinors: Hyderabad means a lot to me. We have strong historical ties with the Nizam family. Before this, we were in New York for seven years and in Belgium for four years. We know the US, Europe and the West in general, and were looking forward to knowing India. Its such a vast country with different cultures, religions. When I got to know that we were assigned as the Consul General for Hyderabad, I was so happy because India has always been on my mind. Now, Ive become a Hyderabadi. The people here never made me feel like a foreigner. Ive never seen such warm and welcoming people anywhere in the world. For me, India is Hyderabad.pic: s senbagapandiyanYour favourite hangouts?AA: We are historically connected to the Falaknuma Palace, so we go there frequently. Before the pandemic, we used to go to so many other places. Also, Hyderabad has many nice clubs  Nizam Club, Golf Club. She (Kubra) knows all the places better than me.KA: We have a good relationship with Princess Esra and Falaknuma is a very special place in Hyderabad. Especially, in these Covid times, it is the one place where we feel safe to visit. We also go to Taj Krishna and ITC Kohenur. Recently, Cock & Bull (a pub in Madhapur) opened up and we go there every other week.Did you face culture shock?AA: No, not at all. Even though we came from New York and my daughter (14-year-old) grew up there, we never faced any culture shock. Thats because we are Turkish people, representing Turkey. Turkey is a transition between the East and the West, the North and the South. We are close to Europe, India, Middle East and Russia. We understand everybody, we keep and digest all cultures, we are much more adaptable in any environment. Our culture incorporates pieces from other cultures.KA: India and Turkey have a lot of things in common. Both are very diverse  the culture, cuisine and people change from region to region. The people live in harmony. Similarly, Ive never seen racism in India. There is a high level of tolerance here, it comes from your culture. This is another major commonality. In Turkey too, there is no discrimination. People accept you as you are as long as you treat them well.How about the Hyderabadi biryani?KA: This is a wrong question... (laughs) The biryani at Jewel of Nizam is the best. Falaknuma serves the best haleem. But whenever we are invited to someones home or to an event, weve never had bad biryani.AA: After dinner, they place a big plate of biryani. Its the culture here. For Hyderabadis, a meal is incomplete without biryani being served at the end.KA: Im so used to having an onion-tomato-chili salad with my dinner after coming to India. Its a must on my dining table. I keep joking with my friends that I havent got Covid so far because I eat onion and chili. (laughs)Speaking of Covid, are we on the right track?AA: India started off very well in the beginning. Last year this time, when there was a lockdown, the cases were low. After that, people were relaxed and for economic reasons, the local and Central governments eased the measures. In September, we saw the first peak which subsided quickly. Everyone thought that Covid was over. But other countries were seeing second and third peaks. Now, Turkey is seeing the third peak, while in India it is the second which is the longest and highest. People should be more careful.In Turkey, a woman is equal to a manPeople have started to wear masks but in Jan-Feb, everyone thought that Covid was gone. The governments shouldve been better prepared. I think this second wave will be over in one-one-and-half months. India is doing great when it comes to producing vaccines, but it has delayed vaccinating large populations. It has accelerated the process. Everything should go hand-in-hand people protecting themselves, measures by the government, increasing the infrastructure capacity and vaccination. If India does these things in harmony over the next three-four months, things will become safer.Last Ramzan you distributed food to the poor in a slum. Whats the plan this year?AA: Last year it was much safer to do that. We were scared, but we took precautions. This year I dont know how it will work. People line up to collect food packages; there are kids, young people and old people. They should not be in such close contact with each other. Now, children are getting infected more. This is our concern. We want to do something this year too, but dont know how. We might do something with the help of our friends and NGOs perhaps.How do you plan to celebrate Eid this year?KA: We will celebrate it at home. This year, Turkey will be in lockdown so we will connect with our family online. But hopefully by Bakrid (July-August) things will be back to normal.Is Hyderabad doing okay with regard to combating climate change?AA: Not only India, the whole world if offtrack. There are so may reasons for this. India has huge potential but with regard to city planning and waste management, it can do better. It has human resources, technology and financial resources, it has to just manage these in a better fashion. I see good examples in Financial District, Gachibowli and the newer neighbourhoods of Hyderabad. With regard to pollution, Hyderabad is okay as compared to other big cities in India. Other than that, the citys waste management and sewage system should be improved. Im encouraging my friends and colleagues here to connect with the Turkish construction sector because we can help build good infrastructure.Ertugrul - a hit Turkish TV showHow do we deal with the high amounts of medical waste generated during the pandemic?AA: This needs specialisation. Hospitals are collecting medical waste and taking all measures to dispose them of carefully but millions of masks used by the people land up in garbage bins and landfills. Theres no segregation. The government should encourage people to sort waste.What does it feel like to be the wife of a Consul General?KA: When you are the wife of the Turkish Consul General, you leave your job behind. Im actually a skincare specialist. I got my education in New York from Christine Valmy and I worked there as a skincare specialist. But if you are a diplomat, you have to make sacrifices  give up your job and follow your husband. Our first responsibility is to perfectly represent our country. But whenever I do go back to Turkey, I have different plans.AA: When we went to Belgium, my first posting was as at the Turkish Mission to the European Union. She had to quit her job in finance. When we moved to New York, she decided to change her career.Kubra, give us some skincare tips.KA: Before going to bed, cleanse your skin with a toner, apply a serum and a moisturiser. Repeat the same cleanse and moisturise in the morning and apply a sunscreen. In India, the Sun is very harsh and dark skin is more prone to hyperpigmentation. Always keep your skin clean and hydrated. But first, be happy. Surround yourself with good people, do whatever that makes you happy and do it with pleasure. This happiness reflects on your skin. First comes mental health, the beauty regimens are all supportive.Whats your secret to your physical fitness?AA: The pandemic has actually helped me stay fit. Ive been taking long walks, playing football and swimming. I do about 15,000 steps every day.KA: Before the summer, I used to take 10,000 steps every morning. After that, between 3 pm and 6 pm, I used to practise yoga or workout, it depends on my mood. I also got a yoga trainer certificate. In Manhattan, we used to walk a lot and never used the subway. Also, I dont like gyms and closed spaces. When you walk, you take in so much fresh air. Especially, when you feel down, just walk and everything sorts out by itself.You have fabulous style. Where do you shop from?KA: Nowadays, I shop a lot online. I love your textiles and fabrics. I like to buy cotton. I like traditional Indian ethnic wear. I have bought so many sarees, lehengas and kurtas. I have five lehengas. If Im going for a wedding, Id like to wear something traditional. White cotton kurtas are my favourite, these are so comfortable during Ramzan. I also like fusion style and floral dresses. I just love to shop but its been three weeks since Ive bought anything. Thats a long time!AA: Im old school. I like to go to a store and feel the clothes that I buy. But now online shopping is getting so popular, even I do it. But I prefer going to a store any day.Id like to conclude by saying, thank you for Ertugrul (Turkish TV series).KA: Theres a funny story. Ertugrul has five seasons and during the lockdown last year, I had nothing to do. I finished all five seasons in one week. And now, I started watching it all over again (laughs). The series shows the importance of women in the Turkish society.

A traditional breakfast in many Tamil households during this time of the year, that also makes an annual appearance on street carts, this pearly-looking millet is the kind of coolant our body needs to stay hydrated.Due to its inherent nutritional value and its ability to tackle body heat, kambu is the second most important food in Tamil Nadu that is consumed predominantly during the summer season, especially in the form of Kambankoozhu (porridge) writes Indra Narayan in her e-cookbook Millet Kitchen - The Simple Art of Millet Cooking.Pearl millet, popularly known as bajra or kambu, is called the magic millet as it is highly nutritious, easy to digest, and has a host of benefits. The traditional crop is widely cultivated in Villupuram, Thoothukudi and Madurai. Home chef and author Indra, also an advocate for consuming locally grown foods, says, Pearl millets are especially power-packed with carbohydrates, essential amino acids, antioxidants, multiple vitamins like thiamine, riboflavin, folic acid, niacin, beta carotene and minerals like iron, phosphorus, magnesium and zinc.Benefits aplentyIt is good for a diabetic diet as the carbohydrates in this are digested slowly and help maintain a stable glucose level.It is beneficial for heart health. Kambu has cholesterollowering properties and is good for heart patients. As it also contains an adequate amount of good fat, it is good for patients with high cholesterol.It is the perfect grain for people with celiac disease and gluten intolerance.Therapeutic for people with frequent acidity and stomach ulcers.The high phosphorus content in kambu helps make the bones stronger, especially in growing children.It has a good amount of dietary fibre and hence helps in relieving constipation.It makes for nutritious baby food.Kambu is rich in antioxidants and helps fight ageing.Ideal food for weight management.A healthy choice for pregnant and nursing mothers.Make the switchYou can make the switch to millets by starting with little millet and then work your way up to other millets. Start with idlis as they are steamed and easy for the body to accept and nourish. Then, gradually, you can make dosas, upmas etc. You can even bake cakes and cookies with kambu.Word of cautionBefore moving from rice to millets, do thorough blood work to check all your parameters. Also, talk to your doctor about opting for millets. When you use millets, never mix different millets in your diet. Each millet has different digestive properties and it may not always suit your body. Soak the millets for five-six hours before cooking them because it can cause bloating otherwise. This is one of the reasons, it is suggested to start consuming millets by making them as idlis, because it goes through the soaking and fermentation process.Kambu IdliINGREDIENTSBajra flour: 3 cupsWhole urad dal: 1 cupFenugreek seeds: 1 tspPoha: 1/4 cupSalt to tasteMETHODSoak urad dal and fenugreek seeds in water for five hours.Soak bajra flour in water too.

2021-05-13,https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/pune/markets-remain-close-traders-go-to-farmers-fields-in-nashik-7313995/,"In response to the 10-day lockdown in Nashik district, traders and market committees have decided to go directly to farmers fields to buy onions. The Lasalgaon Market Committee has made a detailed plan for farmers to sell their produce at the farm gate under its supervision to prevent complaints of cheating.Nashik, like other districts of Maharashtra, has resorted to a strict 10-day lockdown to break the chain of transmission of Covid-19. During lockdown, which is to last till May 23, household essentials like milk and vegetables will be delivered at home. The district collector has also ordered the closure of agricultural produce marketing committees, but farmers who wish to sell their produce are free to do so as traders are allowed to carry out trade directly at the farm gate.At present, farmers have late kharif and rabi onions in storage. While the former has a shorter shelf life, the latter, due to its lower moisture content, has a longer shelf life. Mostly farmers will store their rabi produce, which has been harvested after March, in on-field moisture proof structures called kanda chawls to stop them sprouting green shoots. This stored onion would feed the market till the arrival of the new stock after Diwali.Survarna Jagtap, chairperson of Lasalgaons wholesale market in Niphad taluka of the district, said closure of trade in wholesale markets made preparation for farm gate trade possible. Employees of the market committees had been assigned to traders and commission agents, whom farmers could contact for direct sale, Jagtap said. In case a farmer wants to sell, they are advised to contact traders. The trade would be carried out at the farm gate under the supervision of market representatives, she said.The state has long denotified vegetables from market committees that allows traders to buy from farmers without the supervision of market committees. But numerous complaints of cheating have made farmers wary of farm gate sales.Nashik is also the centre for large-scale procurement of onions by farmer producer companies (FPC). Eknath Sanap, director of Goda Dharna FPC in Sinnar taluka of the district, said their procurement centres were open and farmers who wanted to sell were bringing in their produce. In Ahmednagar, Pune, the FPCs procure at the farm gate, he said.MahaFPC  the consortium of FPCs in the state  has been mandated to procure around 25,000 tonnes of onion by National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation (NAFED), but the consortium is hopeful of procuring 50,000 tonnes. State-wise, NAFED intends to procure around 1.5 lakh tonnes of the bulb this season.Sanap and Jagtap said at present farmers were not in a hurry to sell their produce. Jagtap also said late kharif onions had higher probability of moisture loss, so around 10 to 15 per cent farmers would like to offload their produce. Sanap, however, said most farmers were wary of social contact as the spread of Covid-19 in rural areas was like wildfire. While trade is on, few are venturing out, he added.","Markets remain closed, traders go to farmers’ fields in Nashik",ONION

This is all thanks to the Padma Shri Popatrao Pawar, who has been the Up-Sarpanch of the village since 1990.Impressed by Pawars model of slaying the virus, the Collector and Special Executive Officer () of Ahmednagar district called him to guide around 1,300 village heads on how to become covid-free in their respective villages.Talking about how he went about controlling the spread of the virus,says, In March, one of the villagers had covid symptoms. He was immediately quarantined in a nearby training school, as were all the people who came in contact with him. While we waited for the RT-PCR results, we administered Rapid Antigen Tests for quick results.This is not the first time Pawar has demonstrated his vision for the benefit of the village. He has been widely recognised for his work on water harvesting, water conservation and transforming a drought-prone area into a lush green village.We had 52 covid cases at one time between March and April. After they tested positive, we immediately started treating them with a doctors help. Four of them required ventilators so they were shifted to a hospital. Unfortunately, we lost one of our men. However today we are covid free, says Pawar, proudly.The villagers strictly follow covid appropriate behaviour. Besides following social distancing, every house uses the sanitiser supplied by the, uses masks and four teams keep a tab on the markets to see that covid guidelines are followed.Our main crops are onion, potato and seasonal vegetables. However, villagers are not allowed to grow sugarcane, grapes or even pomegranate as they require huge amounts of water and the village has been focusing on conserving its groundwater level, said Pawar.Due to onion production, several labourers from Marathwada and Konkan keep on coming to our village for work. We have asked them to stay on the farms in sheds and the villagers have been asked to maintain distance while working with them in the fields, said Pawar.Every week teams of gram panchayat staff and volunteers check the villagers oxygen saturation and temperature. Those from Hiware Bazar who go to other villages are advised to sanitise upon return and isolate themselves from their families.This has worked for us because our villagers have cooperated with us. Till now we have vaccinated around 200 senior citizens in our small village that has a population of 1,600, said Prasanna Pawar, son of Popatrao Pawar.Since Pawar took over as the sarpanch in 1990 after completing his post-graduation, Hiware Bazar has built several dams, percolation tanks and bunds. The villagers have always supported my efforts since 1990, said Pawar who has been elected continuously since then.The villagers have not only planted trees but built dams, focused on family planning, laying underground drainage pipeline, clean water, street-lights and banned open defecation. Weve had reverse migration from Mumbai andas peoples incomes went up with more and more land getting access to water, said Pawar who has been unopposed as the leader of the village and even conferred with a Padma Shri for his efforts.Appreciating Hiware Bazars efforts, Rajendra Kshirsagar, chief executive officer,, Ahmednagar, said, They made sure that all the guidelines given by government and health officials were duly followed to become a successful model with zero cases. In rural areas, a lot of people use handkerchieves instead of masks.But here, the village leaders made sure everybody uses masks, follows social distancing and most importantly, ensured that they isolated the person and his contacts while waiting for the test reports to stop further spread of the virus, said Kshirsagar.",How Hiware Bazaar became Covid free,ONION

In our ancient texts, a balance of six tastes - sweet, sour, salty, pungent, bitter and astringent - has been recommended in everyday eating for optimum health.While sugar and jaggery are the primary sweetening agents in our kitchens, we have also been blessed with an array of natural food souring agents which add that tangy zest to any dish. As summer makes its presence felt, tender tamarind leaves make their appearance which are used extensively in meat preparations in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. The same applies to Gongura leaves which are also enjoyed in the form of pickles and chutneys. Another green leafy vegetable that imparts tartness to pappus and chutneys is Green Sorrel.Commenting on the use of these leaves in Indian kitchens, Chef Sudhir Nair, who is the executive chef in The Westin Hyderabad Mindspace, says: The summer season is believed to be a good time to add these leaves to your food as they keep your body cool. It is also a season when appetite goes down and the tang of these leaves can help bring it back. Gongura, as we know, is used extensively in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. We must note that tamarind and Gongura leaves are used mainly in the preparation of meats that have a strong flavour like mutton. In case of chicken or seafood, the taste of the leaves might overpower the dish.Green Sorrel leaves: They are called Chukka Koora in Telugu and Khatta Palak in northern India. Their appearance is similar to spinach leaves but the leaves are darker and the stems thicker. Apart from being added to lentil recipes, they are also used in salads. Their tartness comes from oxalic acid, the quantity of which becomes higher as the leaves grow. They grow all year round but the peak season is summer.Tamarind leaves: Tamarind is one of the most common souring agents in Indian cuisine, and even its leaves are eaten in a few states. Chugur Dal and Chugur Gosht are relished during summer as this is the time when tender, crunchy tamarind leaves are available. These sour leaves are used in Ayurvedic medicines and Chef Sudhir tells us that they taste swell with potatoes too.Gongura leaves: Known as red sorrel leaves in English, these serrated leaves are extensively used in the two Telugu states, Maharashtra, the north-eastern states and other regions. Apart from the celebrated Gongura Mamsam and pickles, they can also be used to whip up a quirky pulihora. They come in green-stemmed and red-stemmed varieties and their pretty fruit pods are used to make red-hued teas.Health benefitsTamarind leavesThe polyphenols in tamarind have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory propertiesThese can protect against diseases such as heart disease, cancer and diabetesThe leaves were also used to promote wound healingTamarind contains a good amount of magnesium, an important mineral that plays a role in over 600 functions in the bodySeveral studies show that tamarind can combat many different microbes. It may help kill bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasitesGreen sorrelRich in vitamin C, it has always been valued for its ability to prevent scurvy, a disease caused by Vitamin C deficiency, especially at a time when other vitamin C-rich foods were not available or affordable.It acts as a diuretic; aids digestion; relieves constipation and alleviates bronchitis and asthma.Gongura leavesGongura is an excellent source of folate and Vitamin B6, both of which are needed to maintain low homocysteine levelsIt is a rich source of iron, vitamin C, anti-oxidants, calcium, iron, zinc and Vitamin A.Gongura leaves and flowers help cool the body and reduce inflammationThey also contain moderate levels of potassium, calcium and magnesium, which help strengthen the bones and are useful in relieving symptoms of fever.Recipe : Gongura MamsamIngredientsDiced lamb (boneless and tender) - 1 kg | Sunflower oil sunflower - 100 gm | Cloves - 4 | Green cardamom - 6 | Cinnamon stick - 1 | Cumin seeds - 1 tbs | Ginger garlic paste - 75 gm | Garlic chopped - 100 gm | Onion chopped - 250 gm | Red chilies split - 8 | Sorrel leaves - 1000 gm | Coriander powder - 2 tbs | Roasted cumin powder - 2tbs | Green chillies slit - 250 gm | Turmeric powder - 15gm | Salt - as required | Water - as required | Ghee - 50 gmMethodFor Gongura paste: Take a pan and heat some oil in it, then add some whole red chillies, cumin seeds, chopped garlic, green chillies and saute till the garlic sweats.Add washed sorrel leaves and simmer in the heat.

The price hike was blamed on a disruption in supply for the past two days in Pune district in the wake of cyclone Tauktae Sources said the intake at the Market Yard was less than average on Monday and Tuesday.The supply disruption has had an effect on the prices of vegetables. But this wont last long as a fresh supply of vegetables is soon expected, said Madhukant Garad, chief administrator of the Market Yard and secretary of the Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC).On an average, the Market Yard gets 900-950 truckloads of vegetables per day. This dropped to 850 truckloads on Monday, officials from the vegetables section at the Market Yard said.On Tuesday, we got 20,599 quintals of vegetables and fruits in 873 vehicles. This is less than the average intake and led to the price hike, Datta Kalamkar, head of the vegetables section, told TOI.Kalamkar said demand for all vegetables was high in the market. Poor weather and the cyclone have affected crops in most tehsils of the district, he explained.Vilas Bhujbal, head of the Commission Agents Association, said most farmers do not cultivate fresh vegetables, particularly coriander, fenugreek and spinach, due to uncertainty in sales and low rates. Several farmers had not planted cauliflower and tomato, among others, due to Covid restrictions. This has also disturbed the supply. Because of this, prices will remain high for a few days, he said.In the retail markets, a kilo of onion was sold for Rs15-20, while potato and tomato were going for Rs15-22 and Rs8-14 respectively.The rates of leafy vegetables too increased by Rs 5-10 per bunch. A bunch of Coriander is now sold for Rs 10Rs 15, while fenugreek is being sold for Rs12-18 per bunch. Spinach, meanwhile, costs Rs 7-12 per bunch.Sandesh Khade, a retailer from the Vishrantwadi market, said he expects the prices to remain high for two weeks at least. The supply shortage could affect prices for the next two weeks or so. Many farmers told us that they havent grown fresh vegetables because of the curbs, he said.Deepti Deshpande, a resident of Dighi employed with a private firm, said citizens will feel the pinch, especially with the financial impact of the ongoing pandemic. This comes at a time when salaries are being reduced. It has become difficult to meet our monthly expenses, she said.Archana Gardare, a resident of Dhankawdi, said, We always buy vegetables at high pricees. The prices of several grocery items too have significantly increased this month. We dont know how to manage monthly expenses.

The mere nature of the rising cases, especially post-COVID-19 is enough to scare people.Unfortunately, the rising proportion of cases has also fueled disputed claims on social media. One such recent one made people believe that things in their home could be spreading scary fungal infections.A recent claim on social media, which has been widely shared has made many believe that the vegetables stored in your refrigerator can have black fungus.Read more: Fact Check: Can black fungus be cured by turmeric, rock salt, alum and mustard oil? A post on Facebook, originally published in Hindi advises people to be careful of common use vegetables, including onions which could be a harbinger of black fungus infection.The post roughly could be translated as ""Beware while buying onions from the market and storing them in the refrigerator. The black grime or fungus often seen on the outer shell of the onions is toxic black fungus that causes mucormycosis.""The viral claim further mentions that if people are not too careful, the black grime can spread if used while cooking curries or stored in the refrigerator's cool settings.Read more: Can you get black fungus infection without testing positive for COVID-19? The writers of the post also claimed that the black mould can collect on the refrigerator surfaces and cause harm.Ever since the date of publishing, the post has been widely shared across platforms.Not only is the claim completely untrue, but the mode of transmission for black fungus also isn't through mere objects, or in this case, fruits or vegetables.For one, the fungi which form inside the refrigerator, the fungal grime present on onion shells are completely different from the black fungus infection.As per experts, the moulds which grew inside a refrigerator may be caused by some forms of bacteria, yeast. While they can be dangerous and cause contamination, they showcase nonspecific symptoms.The fungus, meanwhile, found on the onion shells is the result of a common fungus found in the soil. While it is pertinent that all vegetables be thoroughly washed before use, the fungus found on onions is rarely infectious.The black fungus infection, on the other hand, spreads in a very different manner and is many more times symptomatic. As per health experts, it carries a mortality rate of 50%.Black fungus infection, which is spread through fungal moulds called 'mycormetes' are present in the environment. The infectious spores cause the dangerous disease when a person, who is at risk of infection inhales them via contaminated surfaces (such as unsanitary environment) or humid temperatures. Simply put, it doesn't spread through the food you eat or objects you may touch, but when you inhale these contagious moulds through unclean surfaces.Reports have also suggested that the use of unfiltered or unclean water supply used for oxygenation in COVID-cases may also be a source of transmission of disease.Additionally, a black fungal infection, though carries a high mortality, isn't infectious for everybody. As per AIIMS Director and renowned medical expert, Dr Randeep Guleria, people suffering from extreme or uncontrolled diabetes, or those who have been using steroid therapy for long, since their immunity could be suppressed.Mucurmycetes infection also primarily affects people who are suffering from severe comorbidities or routinely consume medications that suppress the body's immunity to fight off infections.Furthermore, a black fungus infection can be diagnosed and detected by extracting a fluid sample from the sinus passage, tissue imaging and prior medical history.The information on black fungus infection has been clarified by a number of credible medical experts and doctors. Guidelines, information have also been listed down by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) on social media.There's no truth to the matter of the black fungus infection is similar to the moulds growing in your refrigerator, or the onion. At a time like this, it is critical that we get our facts right, be aware of the symptoms and seek treatment at the earliest. If you have recently recovered from coronavirus, or experience symptoms such as black crust formation around the nose, excruciating headaches, swelling, redness, seek a doctor's consultation at the earliest.",Fact Check: Can you catch black fungus from your refrigerator?,ONION

As Chef de Cuisine, when he first served the dish at The Lalit London, it starred king fish along with tapioca, and was simply known as kappa meen curry. Back home in Kerala, sardines are usually used for the dish. Even though Jomon chose king fish because of its fleshy texture, the dish did not get the warm response he was expecting.Not one to give up, a few months later, in one of the usual menu rejigs, Jomon reintroduced the dish using the red mullet, a much-loved variety of fish in London. Now, Jomon had guests ordering it and complimenting him as well. I realised that the way the dish is presented and described makes all the difference. I tweaked the plating a bit, making the fish centre of attraction, so that guests of any nationality could relate to the description. I consider it an honour to showcase Kerala cuisine here, he says, over a call from London.Seared red mullet and cassava mash served with Alleppy fish curryThe only Malayali chef in the five star hotel that serves Indian food, Jomon was keen on including a number of dishes from his homeland in the menu. I just wanted to show that Indian food does not begin and end with butter chicken and tadka dal, he adds.Jomon has served everything from the traditional mathanga erissery (a curry made of pumpkin, dal and coconut) to payasam to the famed duck mappas. He served mathanga erissery as a vegan main course, calling it Pumpkin Steak. The konju theeyal (shrimp onion curry) was served along with lobster tail tandoor, with the theeyal made with shallots and crushed dried shrimp. When I was given charge of the menu, I wanted to bring in some diversity. I started researching my own food and I realise that nothing could possibly go wrong if you turn to your roots, he says.Payasam with caramelised bananaHe says he takes care to retain the authenticity of the dish, tweaking only the plating and the presentation. So even inherently Malayali ingredients such as vazhappindi (banana stem) or kovakka (ivy gourd), for instance, were transformed into steaks and salads. The simple milk payasam was made into a frozen dessert, garnished with caramelised banana sticks and served with crushed pappadam to add texture.The Lalit has just reopened after a year and Jomon spent the time at home, trying out a variety of new dishes and experimenting with unique ways of plating. He took virtual classes for a few universities online as well.Born and raised in Mavelikkara, Kerala, Jomon completed his hotel management course at Sarosh Institute of Hotel Management in Mangaluru. He moved to London in 2008, where he completed his post-graduation in Hospitality Management from the London School of Business and Computing. He started his career in London as the Chef de Partie at Bombay Palace, a high-end Indian restaurant in London. He worked as Senior Chef de Partie at Cinnamon Kitchen, a restaurant which specialises in merging eastern spices with western culinary styles, before moving to Baluchi, the pan-Indian dining destination at The Lalit in 2017.Coconut-stuffed and steamed sardine, colocasia brunoise cooked in turmeric brine liquid and a chutney made of mango, coconut and curry leavesThe love for food is what has brought him so far, believes Jomon, who appeared in BBCs Celebrity Master Chef 2018. He also got an opportunity to teach at the Hammersmith and West London College, where he had once hoped to study. This was a dream come true. I couldnt study at the college 12 years ago, as my circumstances did not permit it. But, I have no regrets today as I got a chance to teach in the very same college, he says.Ayala pollichathu (mackerel steamed in banana leaf) with chilli and shallots; mathi varuthathu (fried sardines); and potato mezhukkupuratti (a pepper stir-fry) are next on his list.

As a result, while transport costs skyrocketed, prices crashed so severely that he decided not to harvest the crop at all.The price offered was not even the quarter of what he would need to meet the costs. If I sell at these rates, I will incur heavy losses considering what it costs to harvest and transport. So I am feeding the ladies finger to my cattle. As for the onions, I have asked the labourers to harvest and take home as much as they want for free, Mr. Rama told The Hindu.Produce dumpedThis is the story of many farmers across Karnataka. A video clip of a watermelon grower in Sagar, Shivamogga, destroying his crop in frustration was widely shared. There was another of a jasmine grower dumping his harvest on the streets in the district, cursing the administration for the lockdown. Many tomato growers in Kolar and Chickballapur recently protested by throwing their produce on the street.A kilo of tomato was selling at less than 2, which wouldnt have even recovered my transport cost, leave alone my investment. So I abandoned the crop at the market and returned, said Adi Reddy, a tomato farmer from Kolar.The fall in demand for vegetables, fruits and flowers, the disruption of transport networks, and high transport costs following the Statewide lockdown imposed for the past three weeks have hit these farmers hard.Despite the lockdown guidelines clearly allowing free movement of all cargo, transport networks have been disrupted, especially inter-district and inter-State ones.For two weeks, vegetables were not being sent out of the State. This has now been resolved. The price of tomatoes improved to 7 to 9 a kg only after the supply to other States, including West Bengal and Bangladesh, resumed, said G. Srinivasan, a farmer from Nandi and a member of HOPCOMS. He also said transport operators were charging several times more than usual, citing the lockdown, police harassment, and skyrocketing diesel prices. Diesel prices have touched an unprecedented 90 a litre. This has also added to the farmers woes, he said.Inadequate reliefThe State government sop of 10,000 a hectare (4,000 an acre) for vegetable, fruit and flower growers has been dubbed woefully inadequate by farmers and farmers unions. The amount they have promised to grant us does not compensate for the loss we are facing every day, said Ganesh, a farmer from Hassan.Kodihalli Chandrashekhar, president of Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha, said, Not only is 4,000 an acre inadequate, the total outlay for this sop is less than 100 crore, which evidently shows not all farmers will get this relief as well.(With inputs by K.V.

One after the other, trucks and pick-up trolleys bearing the seasons produce make their way in and within a few hours, as many as 871 of them have arrived and taken position according to the numbers allotted to them. Hectic auctioning begins, the traders are competitive, and those with the highest bids land the deal.This might appear to be just any other day for a wholesale market. Except, it is not. Its Amavasya  the new moon day  and the first time in 74 years that the market, situated 225km from Mumbai, has been kept open on a day that is considered inauspicious by many.The reason behind the shift in tradition is simple: After bearing heavy losses due to the Covid-induced lockdowns, the traders and farmers are in no mood to let the threat of a bad omen come in way of making a profit.Said Nandkumar Daga, onion trader and Lasalgaon Merchants Association President, The market was shut for 1.5 months due to Covid and we faced major losses. Due to the lockdown, a huge stock of onion had got accumulated with farmers and they do not have any other option but to sell it, especially with the rainy season upon us. Its sowing time and farmers need money for that. Traders, too, are facing financial crunch and it is not practical to keep the market closed for one full day just because of some decades-old tradition.Ever since the market was established in 1947, the attempt to open it on Amavasya was made only once before. Around two decades ago, we tried to open the market on new moon day but one of our traders died in an accident. This further cemented the belief that opening the market on Amavasya is a bad omen, said Daga.Market insiders were surprised at the overwhelming response on Thursday.We were thinking that hardly 200 trucks will come but we were delighted to see so many people coming for the auction, said a market staffer.According to the Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) officials, around 16,833 quintal onions worth Rs 3.03 crore were sold out. Though the quantity is still less than usual, when around 27,000 quintal onions are sold, it was still a good sign, said traders.Yogesh Bhausaheb Jagtap, 36, an onion farmer from Shelkewadi Village in Niphad taluka, said he did not care as much about the bad omen as he did about recovering the money he had invested in the onions after taking a loan. Due to the lockdown, our produce was lying in the field for over a month. The market was also closed, causing us huge losses. Onion is perishable and needs to be sold out as soon as possible.Shiva Gade, another farmer, said that not being able to sell the produce would have been a bigger omen as my whole family would have suffered.Lasalgaon APMC secretary Narendra Vadhavane said, We have been trying to open the market on Amavasya for the last two-three years but didnt get a positive response. But this time, owing to the shutdown for over 25 days, there were major losses and the traders body agreed to open the market by setting the age-old belief aside.The Lasalgaon committee has now decided to keep the market open on all new moon days in the future, even if it is for half a day.As Daga said, We must change ourselves with the time.","Lasalgaon onion market sets aside 74-yr-old belief to recover Covid losses, keeps business open on Amavasya",ONION

That wasn't the case this time only because of the lockdown, which has led to a severe decrease in demand.""With many people leaving the city to work from their hometowns, the city has seen a decline in demand for perishable food items such as fruits, vegetables and even flowers.According to traders, prices of vegetables like beans have risen sharply as their shelf life is less during the monsoon.K Lokesh, president of the Bangalore Onion and Potato Merchants Association, said: ""We used to get nearly 250 truckloads of onions into the city every day before the lockdown, but we now get 120 only. There is excessive produce but absolutely no demand.

2021-06-19,https://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/food/2021/jun/19/bowl-of-carbs-comfort-2318294.html,"By Express News ServiceHYDERABAD: Last month, Tollywood actor Rakul Preet Singh took weight watchers by surprise when she endorsed eating rice by calling it a plate full of happiness. Though it is a staple food item in many parts of the country, this cereal grain has earned the dubious distinction of being fattening.However, of late, celebrities and nutritionists have jumped to its defence, saying that consumers are often overlooking the benefits this traditional item offers. Rakul Preet wrote: Many of us think that rice is fattening! No it isnt. On the contrary, its the easiest form of carbs to digest for the body. It heals the gut which in turn helps in better absorption of nutrients.Most importantly its basic food and easily available even during lockdown. So eat simple, nutritious and balanced meals and improve your immunity. When we asked Dr Janaki Badugu, a nutritionist who runs the Diaita Eatright Clinic, she said: There is nothing wrong with having white rice, but you should watch your portions. It is false that weight gain is proportional to the quantity of rice you eat, but there are many who fear this cereal.They go to the extent of saying that if they eat rice in the afternoon, they will gain weight by evening. But if we look at the major cereals, they release a similar amount of calories. Be it rice, wheat, ragi, millets or even legumes, 100 gm of each of these release calories between 320 to 375. What these cereals differ in is their nutrient profile. For example, wheat and ragi have more fibre than the others. Polishing rice takes away its nutrients, and thereby, hand-pounded rice or brown rice can be alternative options.But if you are taking white rice in limited portions, you can easily include it in your meals. Dr B Sujeeth Kumar, a consultant surgeon, said: White rice is deficient in bran and germ layer, and hence does not have any nutrients and fibre. An easy way to make rice more nutritious is to have it with lentils and green leafy vegetables. This combination brings down the glycemic index of rice, which means sugar is absorbed in the body over three-four hours without causing any sudden spike in blood sugar.This leads to less hunger pangs and prevents overeating. At the end of the day, it is not the fault of the rice that you are gaining weight. If you are eating rice with oily curries and fried sides, it increases the total calories of a meal. Also, lack of portion control too can provide you more calories than you can burn. The body stores the leftover calories as fat, and that is how people gain weight, adds Dr Janaki.A layered thingOuter layer of rice - B vitaminsInner layer - carbohydrates, amino acidsPolishing reduces B vitamins and fibre contentRice and feversRice kanji (gruel) is an excellent potion to have if one contracts the virus. It can bring down fever andalso relieve the body of aches. Another good side of this grain is that it is gluten-free. The starch and B vitamins in rice also makes it a calming agent which can reduce stress and anxiety.Recommended portionA tightly-packed cup (250 ml) of rice per meal is recommended for adults, even for those who are trying to lose weight.Okay for diabetics?Rice has a high glycaemic index (70), which makes diabetics jittery about having it. The index is ameasure of how quickly a food causes our blood sugar levels to rise. However, if we take rice with dal, vegetables, curd etc., the GI comes down to around 50. When the food becomes complex, the GI getsreduced.TRY THESE QUICK RECIPESVEGETABLE SAFFRON RICE PILAFINGREDIENTS:2 cups long grain rice (Basmati)2 tbsp unsalted butter2 tbsp olive oil1 large onion (chopped)2-4 cloves of garlic ( finely chopped)1/4 cup fresh or frozen peas*1 red or yellow bell pepper (chopped*)1 carrot (peeled and chopped*)1/2 tsp salt (or to taste)1/2 tsp white pepper1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley4 1/2 cups (about 1 litre) vegetable stock1/2 tsp saffron threadsMETHOD:Make vegetable stock using carrot,celery, leeks onion and bay leafAdd white wine and sautHeat olive oil in a pan, add onion and saut it until transparent.

2021-07-04,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/the-as-light-as-air-souffl/article35130887.ece,"The perfect souffl is a work of art, involving a judicial balance between air and moisture, using a bain-marie, pre-chilling the mixture, and so onThe origin story of my souffl-making is now lost in the mists of time. However, I will admit that it had a lot to do with the fact that, after a string of epic fails with everyday lunches, I turned to baking under the impression that baked dinners would make for at least one decent meal per day.I do remember that my first attempt turned out fairly well, and souffl philistines that my husband and I were, how much it rose was the exact amount of rise we expected, and since we loved eggs, this was a light and satisfying dinner. Soon it became cheese souffl for dinner one night every week.My souffl-making started in the pre-Internet days, so my go-to recipe was one culled from a 1966 issue of my grandmothers stash of Woman & Home. I read the recipe, more than a bit surprised at how easy it seemed. Apparently, all one needed was some white flour, butter, eggs, cheese and milk... and some wrist game to beat the eggs to frothy perfection. In 1966, apparently manual exertion was what made for light-as-air souffls. In time, the kid was an enthusiastic, if slightly ineffectual, egg-beater when she was home for the holidays. Later on in life, the husband eschewed the egg-beater in order to go at the mixture manually, with delicious results.Flavours galoreNecessity being the mother of invention and all that, I soon turned to my masala shelves to desify the flavour of my souffl. Voila! A touch of cracked pepper, a pinch of chilli powder, finely minced garlic, all wonderfully amplified the basic flavour.As time went by, I grew more daring in my experiments. Id grate onion and add it to the mix. Paprika and mustard became regular features, as did julienned mushrooms, bits of salmon, ham, bacon. Once in a while, though, Id overplay my hand. Like the time I diced coloured bell peppers, cauliflower and cooked potatoes, and put it into the souffl. Or the time I sliced sausage bits into it; another time I slid sliced sweet potato bits into the mix. These souffls rose but not too high, were definitely not light as air, and though the end result was delectable, any old-fashioned professional chef, fictional or real, from Bertie Woosters aunt Dahlias cook Anatole to Auguste Escoffier would have immediately castigated me for passing off a Spanish omelette as a souffl.Just eggs and cheeseThen there are individuals and establishments aplenty who make fruit souffls but that offends the purist in me. If a souffl doesnt have eggs and cheese in it, it simply is not a souffl, so say I. As for souffls made with coffee liqueurs, chocolate or Grand Marnier, lets call them by their right names, shall we? They are custards. Or mousses.Reading up on this dish, I found that the perfect souffl was a work of art, involving a judicial balance between air and moisture, using a bain-marie, pre-chilling the mixture, and so on. I also gleaned several useful facts. That a souffl rose to wonderful heights only if it involved the use of many eggs and was a smoother than silk mixture. That a spoonful of cream along with the milk made for an uber-binder. That it was best eaten hot, not after it had fallen in on itself and become some sort of an egg casserole; this collapse is often because the dish is baked to a dry consistency, so a jiggle test comes in handy here. That a few cheeses did nothing for the dish, being stringy or bland, while most others gave it a sublime flavour. That the external browning did not always correspond to a fully cooked interior. That all your efforts will come to naught if you dont have a ceramic souffl dish or ramekin with sides high enough to encourage the souffl to reach for the sky. That there shouldnt be even a smidgen of yolk in the egg white mix. That the egg whites have to be beaten to a just-so consistency: not too wet, not too stiff. That all your efforts will (again) come to naught if you open the oven door while the souffl is baking inside.Better versionSome years ago, a group of us dined at Le Voltaire restaurant on the Left Bank in Paris. I ordered an onion soup (another dish which I make often at home) and a cheese souffl. Behaving rather typically, our group was soon tasting each others food. The French onion soup was far better than my version. The souffl was excellent, literally melting in the mouth, the cheese leaving a lingering aftertaste.Everyone had a forkful of the souffl. Then everyone turned to me as one and said, I dont know what it is but I much prefer your souffls. More chatpata.It was hard not to feel smug, that much I will tell you.SUNDAY RECIPECheese souffl(from the cult cookbook Larousse Gastronomique)Ingredients40 gms butter, plus extra for greasing 40 gms flour2 decilitres or 1 cup cold milk4-5 large eggs75-90 gms cup finely grated Gruyere cheese60 gms finely grated Parmesan cheesePinch of saltPepperGrated nutmegMethod1.

The pandemic has brought to fore the digital divide in the country and made education a privilege only a few can afford.Lack of smartphones, data costs, technology literacy, mobile connectivity, increased screen time, non-academic distractions and several social ills have only exacerbated the problem.In Chhattisgarh's Raipur, Lakshmi Sahu and her husband Purushottam Sahu together earn Rs 5,400 a month. Last month, they spent Rs 14,000 on a smartphone for their 12-year-old son Kunal ""We took a loan to buy the phone because we didn't want our son to miss out on learning,"" says Lakshmi.The 32-year-old mother works as domestic help and her husband works as a helper at a general store. The couple has enrolled their child at a private English-medium school nearby.The family, already burdened with the loan on the smartphone, is finding it difficult to afford the monthly data recharge.""On some days we do not have money to buy groceries, how we are going to arrange a data pack I don't know,"" she rues.Most of the families have only one smartphone which is shared by all.In Rajasthan's Kota Shila Bai and her husband Ramavtar have a single smartphone for their six daughters and the girls only have access to it once the parents come back home from work.Shila Bai's 15-year-old daughter Kanchan is a student of Class 10. She says the phone access is limited and her father doesn't let them keep it for a long time.""We can have the phone once he comes back home but by then either the data expires or it takes time for the websites to load,"" she says.Technology literacy is a challenge that is confronting both parents and students across the country as most of them rely on basic phones.According to a 2020 Goldman Sachs report  India Internet: A Closer Look Into the Future  only 42% of all mobile phone owners in the country had a smartphone in FY2020. The growth is expected to slow down given the low-incomes levels.""My husband drinks a lot and he doesn't pay attention to Kunal's studies. I am not educated enough to teach him. I don't know how to operate the phone. I get confused,"" Lakshmi says.For Jyoti Yadav, living in Delhis Sarita Vihar its another issue.I can teach my son Yash who is in Class 1 but I carry my smartphone to work and have been unable to focus on his studies. I have to work to make a living but I also want to help my child study, she says.The single mother who works as a maid and lives in a slum where leaving a child on his own is fraught with danger.Sometimes I take him with me to work but many people don't like it. So I tell my neighbours to keep a watch on himYadavs smartphone is a second-hand set with a broken screen. She can hardly operate the touchscreen.Mobile connectivity is another major issue, especially in the hinterlands. In some areas, mobile connectivity is barely enough to make calls.A high-speed internet connection is required to access course material over the internet. With patchy connections and the constant buffering of videos kill the interest of students.Ladakh's Sakti village is home to families of nomads and farmers. Though several private companies have installed mobile towers, the villagers continue to struggle with getting proper connectivity on their phones.""The students log out the moment connectivity is disrupted or the data pack expires. They lose interest and do not take our calls,"" says Sonam Gyaltsan, a national-award-winning teacher and headmaster of Government Middle School, Sakti.In Kerala's Wayanad, the students from tribal regions studying in residential schools have totally lost contact with their teachers post pandemic.""Our students belong to the tribal belts of Wayand and live in the forests; they dont have laptops or smartphones and there is no Net connection. We have not been able to contact most of our students. Not only this, theyre suffering due to the Covid pandemic as they haven't received food supplies,"" says K Purushotham, principal of Vivekananda Tribal Residential School , Wayanad.In a country where girls are often viewed as a "" burden"" and their education a privilege, the newfound barriers have only heightened the challenges.Lockdown and lack of resources have made it worse for young girls to study.Shila Bai, who earns her living by selling cosmetic products door-to-door in Kota (Rajasthan), is under pressure from her relatives to get her daughters married.""I don't want to marry them off so soon despite the pressure. I want them to study but how do we do that,"" she says.Her husband says buying a new phone will make girls go on the 'wrong path'.""What is the need to buy a new phone? What kind of education will they get? It's the teacher who has to teach and not a phone!"" he says.While the girls are living under the pressure of getting married, lack of resources is forcing teenage boys to work as labourers and quit schooling.Fifteen-year-old Mohit residing in Rajasthans Karauli district studies in a school in Alwar. Neither his school, nor his teachers reached out to him for any logistical support related to his studies.My school teachers in Alwar said that I can visit them any time if I face a problem or buy a smartphone if I can't come. How can I travel for three hours each time I face an issue with my studies? If I had a smartphone, I probably wouldn't have had to face this problem,"" Mohit says.According to Dr Amit Sen, who runs Children First Institute of Child & Adolescent Mental Health, the role of children as students whose identity are defined by the school or the sense of belonging to a community have dissipated and the impact will be serious.""Now it is even harder because the children are being told to get a laptop first to attend online classes. I think it is unfair to them or almost abusive to ask them to buy gadgets when they can't get even two meals,"" Dr Sen adds.Mohit now works as a labourer at an onion farm to make a living.The pandemic is here to stay and epidemiologists have given very clear indications that the third wave of Covid-19 is inevitable. Although online education is catching up, we still have a long way to go.An Annual Status of Education Report (ASER) survey conducted in October 2020 on 118,838 households said about 11% of these families bought a new phone since the lockdown began. More than 80% of these new phone purchases were smartphones.Of those who had no smartphone at home, about 13% said their children had access to someone elses smartphone.According to Urmila Chowdhury, education director at Peepul India , an NGO working in the field of education, the digital divide will hamper these children badly and governments and NGOs should join hands to resolve it.""When data finishes, these students don't join back as they do not have the money to recharge,"" she says.""There are many students who were studying with us but went back to their villages and it took us a lot of time to bring them back to online classes,"" Chowdhury adds.Peepul India has been working with the South Delhi Municipal Corporation SDMC ) schools to provide education to junior students.""Less than 50% of economically weaker section students in Delhi have a smartphone. Earlier, our well wishers would donate books for the children now we tell them to help us with tablets, phones and data packs,"" Chowdhury says.Her organisation also trains parents on how to operate smartphones and tablets.In Ladakh, teachers have been visiting the villages in Changthang, Pangong an Nubra where the internet connectivity is very weak. The teachers in coordination with the gram panchayats are connecting with the students from the areas.""We should have community classes for kids and send teachers in every village on a roster system so that students can be updated with the course and given homework which can be checked every week, Gyalstan says.""To solve the problem of weak internet, we have installed a mesh network with the help of an NGO. We upload study videos and assignments on the network which the children download, he says.In Keralas Kozhikode, parents from the fishermen community have been sending kids to learning hubs operated by Nasmina Nasir, founder and director of iLAB, an NGO working for the welfare of coastal communities.In these hubs students are taught with the help of KITE Victers, a state-run educational channel that offered digital classes to lakhs of students.We installed television sets for a group of 7-8 children who are taught with the help of a teacher. It has been a success but interrupted due to the lockdown restrictions and cyclone Tauktae.According to Viplow Shivhare, programme head, Pratham, an NGO working towards education among the underprivileged, providing smartphones and tablets to every student is not logistically possible for the government. The government should develop libraries for economically weaker students from where they can borrow gadgets and later return them.""Panchayats and communities should create groups in villages where they can be given tablets with the study material in it without requiring the internet,"" he says.""The government can help students with free data packs to study. Community servers can be created for students who can download content from these networks,"" Viplow says.For sure the pandemic has created havoc in our lives. But its the children, and especially those from economically weaker sections, who have felt the brunt. Without regular classes, without adequate digital infrastructure education of these children have suffered a big blow.",Covid-19: How online classes have widened the digital divide for under-privileged students,ONION

Altering your diet and choosing home remedies could make a difference.Sweat StackersSays Dr Rinky Kapoor, Cosmetic Dermatologist and Dermato-surgeon, The Esthetic Clinics, pan-India, Food low in fibre strains the digestive system. These include chocolates, breads, processed foods and fast-food items, fat-rich products, including high-fat milk, and liquor. Garlic and onion (their allium content gets converted to sulphur inside our body), hot peppers and spicy foods are high in capsaicin, that cause your brain to think that you are feeling hot, resulting in the sweat glands working overtime. Caffeine too adds to the feeling of hotness as the intake increases heart rate and blood pressure and the body reacts by activating sweat glands. If you have a high sodium diet, the body expels this salt in the form of excess sweat and urine.Carb-rich food is tough to break down by the digestive system and, hence, it produces a significant thermic effect. Sugar-laced foods can spike your insulin, resulting in profuse sweating. Excess of protein powered thermogenic foods on consumption lead to more urea production inside your body, which is expelled as sweat. Smoking contributes to excessive sweating, Kapoor explains adding, When you smoke, the nicotine releases acetylcholine. This increases the bodys temperature, causing more sweating. Likewise, when you take a sip of your favourite beer or wine, the blood vessels dilate, raising the bodys temperature, causing perspiration.Tackle toneWork at reducing the workload on your digestive system by eating the correct foods. Dr Divya Malik, Senior Nutritionist at Apollo Spectra Hospitals, Delhi, suggests using olive oil while cooking food as it prevents the body temperature from rising, curbing sweat production. Green tea is popular for its calming effects. Even a glass of homemade, fresh tomato juice keeps perspiration at bay. Stay hydrated with fluids such as coconut water, lemonade, buttermilk, watermelon juice or fresh fruit juice, if you experience severe sweating.Cut out extra salt consumption by giving up salad dressings, instant soups, potato chips, roasted nuts, and canned foods. Instead, increase your intake of vegetables high in water content like spinach, bottle gourd, cucumber, broccoli, sweet potato, lettuce, cauliflower, bell pepper, cantaloupe, eggplant, and red cabbage. Fruits such as grapes, oranges, lemon, pineapple and watermelon help you stay fresh. Have bananas four times a week, and combine milk with morning cereal. Oats are a good option as they are low-fat and high in fibre. Have soaked almonds and walnuts, suggests Malik.

One of my earlier memories is of a cycle-led cart stopping by the place where I  and a lot of other hungry young lads  lived. The compartment at the back of the cycle was filled with flaky patties and vegetable burgers  essentially a potato patty between two small soft buns. I preferred the burgers to the patties, which were so flaky that they disintegrated when you touched them. The vendor would place one on a paper plate and squeeze some ketchup on the side. Food couldnt ever get better, I used to think, biting into the bun-and-potato.  Over the years, burgers have gone through a metamorphosis. I think my first classy burgers were at Wengers restaurant, just above the confectionery, and then, several years later, at Nirulas in Connaught Place. Until some years ago, burgers were simple dishes  two pieces of soft bun holding together a juicy lamb or chicken patty. The buns were often speckled with sesame seeds, the insides were brushed with mayo or sometimes with thousand island sauce. A crisp lettuce leaf and rings of onion added taste and texture.  But that was then. Over the past few years, I have had various kinds of burgers, prepared with imagination and ingredients such as blue cheese, caramelised onions, imported bacon, celery slaw, fried eggs and what have you.  A foodie friend mentioned ordering burgers from a place called Burgerama. I had heard about it, too, but hadnt tried out their fare. It is a delivery chain that serves Delhi-NCR (order at burgerama.in or on Zomato; 215 to 545). I learnt later that it was the brainchild of three friends and the focus was on cheeseburgers.  Ours is a meat loving home, so when we looked at the website, the focus was on different kinds of meat. We agreed on a bender lamb burger, bacon double cheese chicken burger, and T-Rex tenderloin burger. The sides consisted of onion rings, French fries, hot wings, and galaxy bombs (Panko-crusted deep fried chocolate).  I liked the sides, especially the crispy wings and the crunchy onion rings. The potato fries were a bit limp, though, but that could have been because of the weather.  What I really enjoyed was the bacon wrapped lamb burger. I had a large bite from it and thought the bacon had given the lamb a nice kick, and the fried egg and smoked paprika mayo had added to the taste.  The Galaxy Bombs at Burgerama | Photo Credit: Special arrangement  The quarter pound patty of the tenderloin burger came with caramelised onion, a cheese blend, lettuce, pickle, and a blue cheese dressing. I enjoyed it, but would have liked it more had the patty been softer. But I suppose you cant have the tenderloin rare when you are running a delivery outfit. The chicken and cheese burger got a thumbs up, too, as did the delicious galaxy bombs, which were crisp and sweet.  Burgerama offers an Oink Oink burger, with honey-glazed smoked pulled pork, BBQ sauce, lettuce, jalapenos, and smoked paprika mayo. For vegetarians, there is something called Plane Jane (batter-fried cottage cheese patty topped with sun-dried tomatoes, fresh lettuce, pickles, and smoked paprika mayo); and Spicy Leela, which has all these, topped with hot sauces.  Burgers, clearly, are not what they used to be. For burger lovers, theres a whole new world out there. Blue cheese, anyone?

The shop owner pleaded with folded hands but the cops kept thrashing him till his face got swollen. Both the cops were suspended on Monday morning.Five days ago, a vegetable vendor was also thrashed by a head constable of a police control room (PCR) van in Sama area. Ganesh Sonkar alleged that the cop identified as Suresh Rathwa demanded 20kg of onion for free. When Sonkar asked for money, Suresh allegedly assaulted him. Instead of acting against the cop, the Sama police had acted against Sonkar for not wearing a face mask in a public place.Senior police official, though, transferred the head constable and ordered an inquiry against him. Some days ago a 45-year-old man was reportedly assaulted by a police constable in Chhani. Govind Rathwa had to undergo treatment in a private hospital but he refused to file a complaint against the constable.Actions have been taken in such cases whenever we get complaints. I keep telling the policemen that they should take legal steps as per the situation but never misbehave or use violence on public. In our large police force, very few cops misbehave with people, city police commissioner Shamsher Singh told TOI.Last month, D S Patel, a police sub-inspector posted in Navapura police station that time had beaten up an 18-year-old boy who had not worn a face mask. The incident occurred when Ritham Patel was driving his car without wearing a face mask near Polo Ground. The cops intercepted him and D S Patel was accused of beating up the boy along with some other cops.An inquiry was ordered against Patel who was later transferred to the police control room.

Really? she exclaimed, Ordinary poita bhat?  The Melbourne-born chef of Bangladeshi origin, Kishwar Chowdhury, may not have won the recently concluded MasterChef Australia contest, but by wowing the judges with her panta bhat, she has brought into the limelight a humble dish thats consumed in several parts of India and is called by as many names. For Bengalis, its panta bhat, for Odiyas, pakhala bhat, for Malayalis, vella choru or pazham kanji, for Tamils, pazhaya soru. Chowdhury gave her own twist to this dish, presenting it as Smoked Rice Water.  But in each of its versions, the essence of the dish remains the same: leftover rice, fermented overnight in water. Its versatility lies in the way it can take on a range of accompaniments or stand on its own.  Ideal for summer  My first introduction to this dish was at the age of 10 or 11 on a hot and humid summer day. As I waited for my parents to pick me up from school, my best friend invited me for a quick snack at her home, a stones throw away. No harm, I thought and followed her. We took off our shoes at the door and as she ran in to call her mom, I noticed her grandmother slurping what looked like watery gruel from a bowl. There it was, poita bhat.  Curious, I asked my friend if we could have some of that. And I can never forget that taste. With a dash of mustard oil and lime juice, it was one of the best summer meals I have ever had. We gorged on the accompaniments too  aloo pitika (mashed potato) and bengena bhoja (eggplant fritters), which are popular side dishes served with poita bhat in Assam  and slurped our way to the end.  The next time I relished it as much was years later, when I was on an assignment in Odisha. A field worker invited me to an impromptu lunch and as we sat down to feast on an array of dishes, he pulled out a bowl of what looked like poita bhat. Pakhala bhat, he said, In the hot summer months, this is my staple meal. Needless to say, he had to forego much of his pakhala bhat as I slurped it up with green chillies, onion and lime.  Health food  Light on the stomach, cooling and nutritious, poita bhats origins are as simple as the dish. In most States where rice is a staple, soaking the leftover portion in water overnight and consuming it the next morning made sense at a time when refrigerators were not common. This ensured there was no wastage. Left to ferment overnight, the gruelly rice has a high starch content, which sustained farmers and manual labourers for a long period of time after they ate it for breakfast. As we know today, its high Vitamin B12 and probiotic content makes it good for health. Poita bhat was also easy to prepare, standing ready even before the kitchen fire was started for the days meals.

2021-08-06,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/prateek-sadhu-of-masque-distilling-india-on-a-plate/article35766620.ece,"The countrys most experimental chef is hitting the road, to celebrate Mumbais Masque turning five and to share his ingredients-first approach with pop-ups in five cities  It is a dark and stormy night. Traffic on Delhis pot-holed roads has been crawling for hours. In the quiet, tree-lined neighbourhood of Friends Colony, however, 35-odd diners at boutique hotel The Manor are getting ready for a treat: a 10-course menu featuring some of the bravest, most avant garde Indian cooking yet.  Inside, chef Prateek Sadhu, 34, is readying to roll it all out. This is the first day of a three-day pop-up of Masque, his Mumbai restaurant. Tickets sold out within 48 hours of announcement. Pop-ups in four other cities are to follow  Bengaluru, Chennai, Kolkata and Leh, where Sadhu will keep adding elements to the dishes, building newer ones as he finds inspiration in local cuisines and ingredients.  Also read | Indias new spice merchants  Unique and universal  Before the pandemic hit, Sadhu had been doing precisely this at Masque  a restaurant sans a menu, where guests are encouraged to sit inside a lab and experience how he puts together thoughts and flavours after trips to different regions and farms across the country. The restaurant, which turns five this September, recently made it to number 32 on Asias 50 Best Restaurants list of 2021  the only Indian entry apart from Indian Accent in New Delhi (at number 18).  The Masque team touches down in Delhi | Photo Credit: @masquerestaurant  But this is the first time that many gourmands in other Indian cities are getting to experience Sadhus distinctive cooking because even within our competitive, growing restaurantscape, Masque is more niche than popular, more experimental than mass. Which is a shame because it is perhaps the only one in the country that prizes pure experimentation over commerce. If Masque was cinema, it would have been Satyajit Rays.  Like art house cinema, there is both the unique and the universal in Sadhus oeuvre. Take, for example, some of his dishes from the Delhi pop-up: course one was Carrot kanji, bhekti  brined and cured fish, pickled Kashmiri cherry, pickled lime, gongura greens, aam papad, and carrot kanji. Sour is perhaps the least accepted of tastes with the Indian palate. But Sadhu pushes that boundary with this study in sour. Fermented traditions from across India have been layered  northern Indian kanji, eastern aam papad, southern gongura, the pickled lime of the numerous pan-Indian achars, and the elusive Kashmiri cherry.  In course two, Sadhu puts out Corn pani puri, kalari kulcha, ghevar and chok charwan with tomato rasam. What could be the thread of thought running through his mind while putting together such disparate regional influences? A study in textures: of crusts and breads from several Indian regions. The Marwari pure veg ghevar serves as a base for Kashmiri lamb liver, startling purists, but look closely and youll find a redefining of the idea of Indian bread.  Part of the menu at the Delhi pop-up | Photo Credit: Special arrangement  Food that doesnt pander  Sadhu seems to use his individual experiences  his Kashmiri roots, travels, and the innate internationalism that comes from his stints at top global restaurants such as Alinea, Le Bernardin and Noma  as the lens to look at more universal Indian culinary traditions. Kashmiri lamb neck yakhni meets morels miso in what turns out to be his most popular dish that evening; rogan josh sausage and katlam, the Jammu bread, masquerade with NYC casual-chic; and Pondicherry chocolate gets combined with indigenous central Indian flower liqueur mahua that not many urban Indians have tasted before.  Also read | Sadhu and Krugs onion chronicles  In a way what he does is the opposite of what I do because I do not mix different regional cuisines, chef Manish Mehrotra, one of Sadhus guests that evening, who came with his teenage daughter Adah, tells The Hindu Weekend. Mehrotra, widely regarded as the father of modern Indian cuisine, whose signature Indian Accent dishes continue to be copied and regurgitated by chefs in even small towns, finds Sadhus voice to be among the most unique in Indian kitchens. He mixes cuisines and is not afraid to experiment even if diners here do not accept certain tastes or the importance of things like acidity, something that all Michelin-level dining pays attention to internationally, he points out.  The five-year plan Influenced by zero wastage, techniques like fermentation, and local ingredients sourced directly from farms, the philosophy behind Masque has remained the same since it launched. Even as Sadhu sharpened his focus to researching diverse subregional cuisines. So what is his ambition in the next five years? It is always to survive, he says candidly, about the difficulty of balancing commercial success with cutting-edge experimentation. The pandemic has made this tougher. The next few years will definitely have to be about healing from our current difficult scenario. But, personally, my ambition is to dig deeper into Indian cuisines. I feel I have only scratched the surface. I want to look at home recipes, bring them into the restaurant after R&D, understand different regions and subregions, castes and sub-castes, and how food has changed so many things in the country, he says.  Sadhus signature style is neither purist nor populist, and it is definitely not derivative. In fact, his individualistic experimentation is one of the ways forward for modern Indian food. ITCs Manisha Bhasin concurs. There are two schools of thought when it comes to Indian food, one is purist and other is inventive. But what I like about Prateeks food is that it is not about presentations; the food talks to me, there is a purity in that, says Bhasin. ITC hotels will be the venues for Sadhus pop-ups in Chennai, Kolkata and Bengaluru.  Younger chefs like Dhruv Oberoi of Olive, who was also a guest at the pop-up, add that this is perhaps the boldest experimentation in Indian gastronomy yet  with a sense of internationalism in the dishes. While a few of the courses like the lamb yakhni were comfort, there were bold combinations like chocolate and mahua that I had never experienced before, says Oberoi.  Chefs Dhruv Oberoi, Manisha Bhasin and Manish Mehrotra  What is authentic?  I remember the first meal I had at Masque, in the first week of its opening in Mumbai in 2016 in a mill compound that had fallen into disuse. There was Himalayan rye bread and sea buckthorn berries from Leh, there were textures of potato using techniques like dehydration, cooking in an earthen pit, and sous vide, there was olive oil specially pressed from Rajasthan. The whole approach was described as botanical bistronomy  what appeared to be a mix of international styles of cooking using carefully-sourced (and often unheard of) regional ingredients. Over the last five years, that focus has sharpened.  Koji-cured barramundi, carrot & passion fruit kanji  Sadhu now uses Indian ingredients as well as cooking styles and techniques and refashions them. But the sense of internationalism still binds all these. Does he see his food as Indian? Indian food as we know it today is a result of constant evolution. What is authentic? Is my mothers rogan josh more authentic than what my aunt cooks? Authentic is subjective; food is the result of migration and is constantly evolving. So while tradition is important, innovation is critical, he says. His Indian food, he points out, is not about returning to regional recipes and simply plating them with new tweaks. It demands revisiting ingredients in altogether new ways that can build cross-cultural bridges, he adds.  As you eat a bhetki with clam rogan with a puri flavoured with Goan sausage, thinking cross-cultural bridges is inevitable. The pop-up menu will continue to evolve over all its stops  much like the journey of food itself.  The upcoming pop-ups will be priced 5,500 plus taxes. Bengaluru on August 20-21 and Chennai on August 27-28.  Chef Sadhu and his team  Hat tip  Sadhus innovative cooking and internationalism (that comes from study at the Culinary Institute of America plus work at top global restaurants) have been winning him recognition ever since Masque launched. In its first year, it was ranked among the top 10 on Food Tanks 2016 list of restaurant innovators in the world. In 2020, the restaurant received the Miele One To Watch award in Asias 50 Best Restaurants list before debuting this year on the main list. Sadhu has been the first Indian chef to be a brand ambassador for Champagne brand Krug and, more recently, he contributed a simple but inventive beets with peach chunda recipe for the #Amexforfoodies cookbook featuring recipes by top global chefs. Before the pandemic, Masque had also been collaborating with leading chefs across the world to host pop-ups, including with Matt Orlando who helms Copenhagens Amass, in 2017.",Prateek Sadhu of Masque: distilling India on a plate,ONION
2021-08-12,https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/science/soft-robots-waste-onion-peels-dst-7450800/,"Using porous carbon nanoparticles from waste onion peels, a team of scientists have developed soft robotic actuators with enhanced photomechanical capacity, the Department of Science and Technology said on Tuesday.  The actuators can act as efficient traps for illuminating low-power near-infrared (NIR) light and can convert a control signal into mechanical motion with bioengineering applications such as drug delivery, wearable and assistive devices, prostheses, and even artificial organs.  Soft robots or actuators consisting of rubber-like polymer with embedded nanomaterial, which convert a source of energy to mechanical motion, have been gaining much interest with targeted applications in areas, including bio-medical, military, and remote space operations.  Generation of predesigned motion facilitated by their flexibility, affordability, and easy customisation are the main reasons for such interest. The high thermal conductivity of these nanoforms results in rapid distribution of the heat generated locally by thermal and photo-thermal stimuli, the DST said.  To take these actuators to the next level of development, heat traps can be created to capture and contain the generated heat for slightly longer durations such that the achieved photomechanical actuation can be enhanced.  A team led by prof. S Krishna Prasad at the Centre for Nano and Soft Matter Sciences (CeNS), Bengaluru, has realised such a possibility by utilising porous carbon nanoparticles (PCNs), the DST said.  In the research work recently published in the Journal of Nanostructure in Chemistry, the porous nano-carbons (PCN) prepared from waste onion peels by Gurumurthy Hegde at the BMS College of Engineering in Bengaluru, it added.  The specific surface area of the high porosity PCNs were efficient traps for the illuminating low-power near-infrared (NIR) light resulting in the film comprising PCNs and PDMS achieving large magnitude (multi-mm) actuation with fast (sub-second) responses. These features are seldom obtained in single-layer films containing any other carbon nanostructure. The researchers attribute the heat-trapping capability to the manner in which the PCN is prepared.  Pragnya Satapathy, a senior research fellow, said, Exhaustive measurements performed show that the photothermal conversion efficiency and the heat-trapping capability is seen to be strongly correlated with the pyrolysis temperature employed for PCN preparation, and thus is an effective control parameter.  As a value addition, the team also found with an additional ultrathin (30 nm) gold layer, the actuation magnitude could be more than doubled, and more importantly, bidirectional photo-controlled face-sensitive movement was realised. As a novel application-oriented demonstration of the process, the team fabricated a near-infrared-driven electrical switch, which could activate LED circuits and could be used for other similar applications, it added.",Scientists develop soft robots from waste onion peels,ONION

While reviewing the farming practice here on Friday, he instructed the officials to take help from national and international institutions to extend technological know-how to the farmers for better yield and income.  He emphasised research, knowledge-sharing and search for better varieties that are helpful for the food processing industry, which in turn would help the farmers get assured market. He asked the officials to ensure tomato and onion farmers are not distraught.  Further, the Chief Minister stressed cultivating coconut, banana, papaya, chilli, tomato, onion and sweet potato crops and focus on establishing food processing units in 25 parliamentary constituencies of the State.  The officials said the State tops in coconut, papaya and tomato cultivation and productivity and stated that they have taken up banana cultivation in the tissue culture process. In regard to food processing units, the officials said construction works would begin from October.  The CM said more attention should be paid towards chilli processing, with the cooperation of international organisations. Similarly, he also directed the authorities to ensure better prices are paid to the coconut farmers.  In this regard, he directed vice-chancellor of the horticulture university to conduct continuous research on coconut cultivation with the help of reputed organisations, focussing on the problems encountered. Jagan also suggested setting up a grievance cell at RBKs to clear doubts of the farmers by agriculture assistants.  He directed the authorities to monitor the grievances received and how they were addressed, while inspecting the RBKs. He said agriculture students must work for at least one month at RBKs, as it will give them an understanding of their performance and programmes.

At Lasalgaons wholesale market in Maharashtras Nashik district, the average traded price of onion is rising since the third week of September. The prices, which for most part of the year were around Rs 1,500-Rs 1,600/quintal, have breached Rs 3,300/quintal.  Suresh Deshmukh, a commission agent in Nashiks Dindori taluk, said new arrivals were of poor quality. Such onions dont have much market value. The only tradable onion now is stored onion, which farmers are offloading, he said.  In the case of tomatoes, the average traded price at Karnatakas Kolar market has been over Rs 3,000-Rs 3,500/quintal. Traders in Kolar pointed out that September rains had caused damage to the crop in the area.  The present trend is expected to continue till December-end. Prices are also going to increase as demand increases after Covid-19 restrictions ease out, said Deshmukh.","Heavy rain, poor produce push up onion, tomato prices; trend to stay till Dec-end",ONION

Dheeraj Kumar, commissioner, agriculture, while speaking to The Indian Express, said this decision was taken after receiving complaints from farmers about NAFED procuring onions from them at lower price and selling them at much higher prices.  Last year, MahaFPC, the consortium of FPCs in the state, had participated in procurement of onion on behalf of NAFED under the Price Stabilization Fund (PSF) of the Ministry of Food, Public Distribution and Consumer Affairs. PSF is a central government scheme where the NAFED (National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India Limited) enters the market to procure commodities at prevailing price and offloads them at a later date. This scheme is more of a consumer-centric scheme to allow access to commodities to sell at retail markets. NAFED implements the same mostly for onions in order to cool down the prices.  Kumar said that during the implementation of the scheme, his office had received complaints about NAFEDs agencies procuring onions at lower rates from farmers and selling the same to NAFED at higher rate. There seems to be a lack of transparency in the process in terms of price discovery, he said. MahaFPC had also implemented the first-ever onion storage and handling project under the public private partnership model, which saw the state government, NAFED and FPCs constructing scientifically designed onion holding structures where the commodity can be stored with minimum losses.  After the complaints were received, Kumars office wrote to NAFED as well as MahaFPC to enquire if the profit or dividends were passed on to the member farmers. However, their reply stated that the same was not done, he said.  In order to bring in more transparency, Kumar said his office is going to bring about changes in the manner FPCs function during execution of government processes. For FPCs which would work under SMART project, we would insist on them passing resolutions in their general body meeting to pass on the profits to their members, he said. Kumar also hinted that his office had also received complains about the functioning of FPCs that in many cases, the companies are sold to third parties to carry out business.  In its reply, MahaFPC had pointed out that FPCs/MahaFPC/Nafed Act provides brokerage services and that the final commodity is owned by the department of consumer affairs. Sharing of profit is not included in the scheme guidelines, it added. They, however, maintained that over the last three years, farmers have received Rs 2-3/kg over the prevailing market prices under the scheme.","Sharing profits with farmers must to participate in state government’s programmes, FPCs told",ONION

Back then, the fact that a staple had been priced out of the reach of the masses led to the French Revolution and the dramatic, bloody collapse of the ancien rgime. The situation isnt quite so dire right now  the president of the French Confederation of Bakeries and Pastry Shops has said that unlike then, bread is still available, even if its more expensive.  Around the world, the unaffordability or non-availability of food has, from time to time, led to mass unrest, and even the collapse of governments. Bread riots had preceded the fall of the Bastille in 1789, which was stormed in part because the starving sans culottes were looking for grain. Similarly, in 1918 a precipitous rise in the price of rice caused riots in Japan, which led to the resignation of Prime Minister Terauchi Masatake and his cabinet. And consider how frequently that Indian pantry staple  the onion  has caused electoral convulsions: From fuelling public anger against Indira Gandhis government in the pre-Emergency months to powering her resurgence in the 1980 general elections. Onion price rise was also one of the factors in the ousting of the BJP in the 1998 Delhi Assembly elections.  Frances current surge in the price of the baguette is due to bad harvests in Russia, which have led to a global rise in the price of wheat. Greater energy prices have also made ovens more expensive to operate and the heat is being felt by the nations famous boulangeries, as well as the average consumer of the long, baton-shaped bread which is seen as an icon of French culinary heritage. As history teaches us, when people complain about basic foodstuff being unaffordable, governments cant just ask them to eat cake.

A native of North Paravoor, Kiran was one of the 800 applicants who thronged the Ernakulam Town Hall to attend a recruitment seminar for an onion farming job at South Korea organised by Overseas Development and Employment Promotion Consultant (ODEPC)  a state agency.  I have no prior experience in agriculture. But I am desperate for a job with a decent salary. I am ready to toil abroad for that. I could not apply online for the job as the ODEPC website crashed after many people submitted applications through the site, said Kiran. The seminar organised to explain the work atmosphere, climate, living conditions and food style in South Korea was held in two sessions  300 people in the first batch and 500 in the second batch.  A similar orientation was held in Thiruvananthapuram too, attended by around 600 persons on Wednesday. This recruitment is for a South Korea government-aided onion farming project. A South Korean agency entrusted ODEPC to conduct recruitment for 100 vacancies. The agency said that they may recruit 1,000 more people in future. We received over 4,000 applications and our website crashed because of the traffic. Though the required qualification was Class 10 pass, we received applications even from youngsters who have completed MTech and MBA, said Anoop K, managing director of ODEPC.  The onion farms are located in the Sinan and Muan islands in the southern part of South Korea. The salary promised is $1,500 monthly (around Rs 1,12,500 going by todays exchange rate). Those selected will work for 28 days a month from 8am to 5pm  9 hours daily.  The weather sometimes turns extreme. Temperature can drop to minus 20 degree celsius. South Korean food is very different from Kerala. Pork is the staple there. Employers will not manage the workers accommodation, Anoop said A 26-year-old Kakkanad-native who is employed in an IT company was at the recruitment drive too, because this opportunity would help him explore other jobs once he reaches South Korea. I completed B.tech in electronics two years ago. There are several multinational companies in South Korea that offer good salaries to engineers. If selected, I will work at the farm for a year and try engineering jobs afterwards, he said.  According to Anoop, three kinds of youngsters have applied for the job. The first kind genuinely likes farming and wants to learn new farming techniques used in South Korea. The second category just wants to reach South Korea and take up other careers there. The third category is ready to take up any job. We will scrutinise the applications and complete the selection procedure in 10 days, he said. Covid vaccination will be a hurdle for many applicants apart from the maximum age limit of 40. The agency has stated that people who have taken two doses of WHO-approved vaccine will be selected for the job, an ODEPC official said.","Techies, MBA grads in Kochi queue up for onion farming job in South Korea",ONION

Picture those dreamy, table settings with lovely floral patterned tea cups and saucers, ornate cake stands stacked with fancy pastries and plates full of daintily cut sandwiches!  But how did this charming ritual come into existence? Lets travel back in time to early 19th century England, where Duchess Anna of Bedford would have hunger pangs every afternoon, as in those days, people would routinely only eat two meals a day; breakfast and dinner. So, she started having a pot of tea and snacks in her boudoir to quash the unladylike rumblings of an empty stomach.  She enjoyed this practice so much that she decided to invite her friends over to also take part in this delightful pastime. Other hostesses decided to follow suit and afternoon tea gained enough respect to move into the drawing rooms of the finest homes in England. During the Edwardian period, afternoon tea started being served in tea lounges of hotels and in niche stores like Harrods, Fortnum and Mason in London.  The experience would be enhanced with music and sometimes dancing too. Cut to 21st century and afternoon tea is making a comeback in many hotels across the city. What exactly would one expect to indulge in over a typical, traditional afternoon tea? Finger sandwiches are a must. think fillings like smoked salmon and cream cheese, cucumber, egg mayonnaise and watercress, tuna salad and celery.  Theres no afternoon tea without scones! Warm scones are accompanied by clotted cream and strawberry jam. There would also be an assortment of homemade cakes and pastries such as the Victoria sponge cake, Bakewell tart, Eccles cakes and custard pie as well as savoury dishes like cheese and onion quiche and Scotch eggs. All that delicious food would be accompanied by a selection of teas such as Assam, Darjeeling and Earl Grey.  Back home, the afternoon tea at the spectacular Taj Falaknuma is the epitome of elegance. In 1896, the Nizam hosted a luxurious, afternoon tea to celebrate the coronation of Queen Victoria. These events became a tradition at Falaknuma and the palace has seen many more since then. Taking inspiration from Nizami cuisine, they have also incorporated Paan Gulkand sandwich, Lukmi and Haleem Bruschetta served with Irani Chai.

2021-10-31,https://indianexpress.com/article/india/indian-railways-kisan-rail-subsidy-7601167/,"The Railways has raised a red flag over the burgeoning operational costs of its Kisan Rail service with the subsidy it gives farmers for transportation of their produce at half-rate already exceeding the maximum of Rs 50 crore it is scheduled to get this fiscal under the initiative from the Ministry of Food Processing Industries (MoFPI), The Indian Express has learnt.  The Railways has conveyed to MoFPI that the amount required to cover the relief this year would be almost three-fold the money sanctioned, records reviewed by The Indian Express show.  In its communications with the MoFPI, the transporter broached the subject of discontinuation of subsidy and warned that it would lead to dissatisfaction among the farming community.  Records show that the Railways has so far provided Rs 70 crore worth of subsidy to farmers this year, and that the cap of Rs 50 crore got breached by August. In letters sent to MoFPI Secretary Pushpa Subrhamanyam, the Railways has conveyed that the actual amount required to cover the subsidy this fiscal would be about Rs 150 crore.  Considering the huge popularity of this scheme and Railways plans to introduce Kisan Rail in newer regions, it may please be considered that discontinuation of subsidy under Operation Greens TOP to Total will lead to dissatisfaction among the farming community. It is, therefore, requested that the Ministry of Food Processing Industries may please increase the ceiling to at least Rs 150 crores for the year 2021-22, Railway Board chairman Suneet Sharma wrote in a letter to Subrahmanyam in August.  When contacted, officials in the MoPFI declined to comment. But sources in the Ministry told The Indian Express that it has released Rs 37 crore as subsidy for this fiscal so far. The balance (Rs 13 crore) will be released in subsequent months, the sources said.  They said the Ministry had requested the Department of Expenditure for more funds this fiscal and to raise the subsidy ceiling of Rs 50 crore a year, which was originally set for the entire duration of the 15th Finance Commission (2021-26).  We dont have much money, so we have restricted the subsidy amount to Rs 50 crore for the financial year 2021-22. We had written to the Expenditure Department asking if they can provide us additional funds on this account but they have denied the request. So now, the Indian Railways is taking up the matter with the Expenditure Department, MoPFI sources said.  During the last financial year, records show, the Railways released a subsidy of Rs 27.33 crore under the scheme. For this period, sources in MoPFI said, the Ministry released Rs 23.33 crore to the transporter. Subsequently, the Government renewed the subsidy for this financial year, but with a cap of Rs 50 crore.  In another letter sent to the MoPFI Secretary, Railway Board Member (Operations and Business Development) S K Mohanty wrote that the amount of subsidy would be around Rs 110 crore by the end of this fiscal, going by the growth trajectory of the popular service.  Indian Railways have been making sincere efforts to increase the reach of Kisan Rail, so that all sections of our farming community and all geographical locations get the benefit of this scheme  and as a result of these efforts, new routes and services are being included on a regular basis, Mohanty wrote.  Kisan Rail was launched on August 7, 2020, to transport fresh fruits and vegetables from farmers to markets across India. The MoPFI introduced the subsidy scheme in October that year.  Under the Operation Greens  TOP to Total scheme, which was notified by the MoFPI, the 50 per cent subsidy to farmers covers the cost of transportation of popular produce, such as tomato, onion and potato. The arrangement was that while farmers would get to transport their produce at half-rate, the Railways would get the subsidy amount from the MoFPI.  Sources told The Indian Express that officials from both sides have been engaged in discussions over the last two months to resolve the impasse.  The Railways, meanwhile, has been planning to upgrade the Kisan Rail service. Sources said discussions are on to introduce air-conditioned coaches to transport produce based on feedback from farmers in parts of Maharashtra to keep fruits and vegetables fresh as they reach markets. But introducing such a product would mean incurring more cost, officials said.",Railways red flags Kisan Rail subsidy: exceeded year’s quota in August,ONION

Talking more about their inspiration, Monica Shah, creative director and co-founder of the label, shared what went into making the clothes, cultural sustainability and more. Excerpts:  Lakme Fashion Week hosted a phygital event this time. How different was it?  While I would love for people to experience our collections firsthand in person on the runway, this new phygital format not only helps us push the boundaries of innovatively presenting our work, but also helps us reach a wider network. The pandemic has reinforced the role digital media plays in our lives and business. It only makes sense that fashion weeks  which are such an important part of every designers work  include the digital world in unique forms too.  View this post on Instagram A post shared by JADE by Monica and Karishma (@jade_bymk)  Tell us about your collection BaniThani.  We wanted to create a collection inspired by the strong sense of individuality and the beauty of authenticity  of acknowledging your inner fire and celebrating what makes each of us so unique yet so connected. For the longest time we have been drawn to the way women have been represented in Rajasthani miniature paintings in the 18th century. These women were portrayed to be so at ease with themselves, embracing all aspects of themselves without a care for convention. We wanted a collection that inspired this feeling of liberation, of shedding your inhibitions and being yourself.  How are you celebrating tradition through the collection?  The collection is largely inspired by Rajasthani art forms, techniques and practices. We have collaborated with award-winning Leheriya artist Mohammad Saquib to create select couture pieces using this technique. But leheriya is more than just a technique. Its a connection that the people of Rajasthan share with their land. The technique uses materials that are naturally available in the landscape  such as madder root, turmeric, indigo, onion peels and so on. In addition, we have also collaborated with miniature artist Gopal Prasad Sharma to create unique accessories inspired by miniature paintings.  View this post on Instagram A post shared by JADE by Monica and Karishma (@jade_bymk)  In what ways can fashion in India gain better recognition internationally?  I think retaining our traditional roots, while adopting a global perspective is one way. In most of our creations, we use traditional techniques but our colour palettes and silhouettes are rather global and contemporary. I think each of us  from designers to consumers  carries a responsibility to be our countrys cultural ambassadors. No matter where we go, its up to us to celebrate our heritage and artisanal legacy. After all, this is what makes us unique.  Also Read | Fashion 2021: Four bridesmaid outfit trends that will make you stand out  Many designers are now focusing on sustainability. What is your take?

We endeavour to innovate with traditional techniques such that they can be used in myriad ways even in modern times.  How has the pandemic changed our perspective on fashion?

Data from the Department of Fertilisers shows DAP stocks at 14.63 lakh tonnes (lt) as on October 31, compared to 44.95 lt and 64 lt for the same day in 2020 and 2019. MOP stock availability was, likewise, down to 7.82 lt, from the corresponding October-end levels of 21.70 lt in 2020 and 21.52 lt in 2019.  The situation isnt as bad in urea and complex fertilisers that contain different combinations of nitrogen (N), phosphorous (P), potash (K) and sulphur (S). October-closing stocks were lower for this year but not at near-crisis levels: 52.90 lt versus 79.76 lt (2020) and 78.95 lt (2019) in urea; and 30.98 lt versus 38.40 lt and 52.13 lt for NPKS complexes.  Farmers mainly plant mustard, potato, garlic, chana (chickpea), masoor (red lentil), matar (green peas), jeera (cumin) and dhaniya (coriander) during October. The peak rabi demand for fertilisers is during November-December, when sowing of wheat and onion happens. The current low stocks raise concerns on that front.  On Monday, however, Union Chemicals and Fertilisers Minister Mansukh Mandaviya termed reports of a shortage as rumours and denied them. Appealing to farmers not to hoard fertilisers, he claimed that 18 lt of DAP will be supplied in November, as against a projected demand of 17 lt. Supply of NPKS fertilisers, at 30 lt, will also surpass the demand of 15 lt for the month.  Interestingly, meanwhile, the official data also reveal higher overall sales of fertilisers in October. The month registered lower retail sales of DAP (13.9 lt against 15.37 lt in October 2020) and MOP (2.5 lt against 2.84 lt). But this was more than offset by increased sales of urea (20.66 lt versus 17.55 lt), NPKS (13.07 lt versus 8.7 lt) and single super phosphate (7.93 lt versus 4.69 lt).  Also Read | How some Punjab farmers are creating bio-enzymes from kinnow  The shortage of material has seemingly forced farmers to replace DAP and MOP, which contain 46% P and 60% K, with fertilisers having less of these nutrients. The latter includes single super phosphate (containing only 16% P and 11% S) and NPKS complexes such as 12:32:16:0, 10:26:26:0 and 20:20:0:13. To what extent the switch to low nutrient-content fertilisers would help meet demand in the coming weeks, however, remains to be seen.  Fertiliser firms have already hiked the retail prices of NPKS complexes like 10:26:26:0 and 12:32:16:0 from Rs 1,175-1,185 to Rs 1,450-1,500 per 50-kg bag.

He has just launched The Tangra Project, his first own restaurant, after two decades in the industry, along with business partners Vir Kotak and Anurodh Samal. The three had started Context.Eat, the parent company, earlier last year.  Located in Delhis DLF Avenue, this barely two-month-old restaurant is an ode to Kolkata, the city where Vikramjit was born and spent his formative years. Right from the second hand book shops on College Street to the river Hooghly, everything finds a representation in the restaurant, either is the form of decor or dish. This includes marble pillars that resemble stacks of books, a giant mural of a vibrant fish that finds itself sprawled across three walls, and lights on the ceiling which are reminiscent of the toony bulbs that are strung during pujas and festivals.  Working on this project brought to life a gamut of memories for Vikramjit. As we bite into a deliciously creamy haleem on toast, he recalls how he used to catch the 1 pm show with his friends at the erstwhile Chaplin Theatre, and then wait outside for a specific vendor who sold haleem. That is what he recreated.  The kosha mangsho and kochuri are what his Sundays were made up of; he would go to the butcher with his father and get the best pieces to make this household favourite. At this restaurant, Vikram has obediently followed his mothers recipe for the kosha mangsho. She came here and taught us how to prepare it and then followed it up with a video, he laughs.  The menu is a rolodex of Kolkatas iconic dishes: Chinese, Anglo Indian, Mughlai and of course Bengali. Here youll find bhetki fish wrapped with the sharp flavours of kasundi, kanch kola kofta (dumplings made of raw plantain), cholar dal, Tangra style chilli chicken and chicken cutlets so crisp that when you bite in, you hear a satisfying crunch (#ASMR). The breadcrumbs  in which the cutlets are coated  are sourced from Kolkata, as are the other raw ingredients.  Then there are the recipes that took shape in Vikrams head before finding themselves plated on elegant crockery. These include parwal guacamole: pointed gourd being cooked for 18 hours and then made into a fine paste, featuring bits of tomato and pomegranate, shining like bright jewels on a bed of green. Or spinach, roasted poppy seed in sesame sauce, a simple yet delightful combination. If you are in the mood to experiment, the menu also offers a mustard and tender coconut mousse.  The menu, Vikram says, will keep changing according to each season. Hardly a challenge, given they had to bring down the number of entries from 500 to 200.

2021-11-09,https://www.newindianexpress.com/states/tamil-nadu/2021/nov/09/farmers-hit-as-seed-act-silent-on-compensation-2381342.html,"Saravanan MP By  Express News Service  TIRUPPUR: Several instances of farmers suffering the loss of yield, allegedly due to the poor quality of seeds, have been reported in the district. But the affected farmers stand no chance of getting relief because the Seed Act of 1966 and Seed rules and Seed control order 1983 do not have a compensation clause. As a result, no appellate or nodal authority could be created to determine the right amount of compensation in cases arising out of seed quality.  A section of farmers in Mantripalayam, Kulampalayam, Kallipalayam and Koradamuthur bought shallot seeds from a trader in Kallipalayam. After the harvest in August (2021), they were in for a shock since the yield was the big onion (Bellary variety) and they could not sell it because of poor returns. Similarly, another set of farmers from Kundadam, Pallampatti, Nandavanapalayam in Dharapuram Taluk faced similar issues in July 2021.  Speaking to TNIE, Prakash a farmer from Palladam, ""Around 60-70 farmers bought onion seeds for a price ranging from Rs 6,000-7000 a kilo and spent more than Rs 50,000 to Rs 60,000 per acre on fertilizers, insecticides and labour. But the crops failed due to sub-standard seeds. Most of the farmers bought from middlemen and others from seed dealers. The affected farmers staged protests and after intervention from the agriculture department, they were able to trace the seeds from the distributor from Dindigul and got compensation of ` 25,000 per acre from him. But, this is very little. Neither the agriculture department nor seed inspection department arranged fair compensation.""  Elaborating, Tamil Nadu Farmers' Protection Association President A Esan said, ""Sub-standard seeds are causing huge losses for farmers for the past several months now. Private individuals have allegedly been selling onion seeds mixed with substandard onion seeds to the farmers. It is difficult to trace them. In order to regulate seed selling, the seed act 1966 and Seed control order 1983 are enforced. Though the Act has a criminal clause to check wrong or false selling, which offer a heavy fine and six months imprisonment, there is no compensation component. A compensation clause is needed to be added to these rules. The kind of compensation should be given and assessed by a special appellate authority or a nodal officer who can resolve the problems arising from sub-standard seeds.""  Speaking to TNIE, Deputy Director (Seed Inspection Department) - Coimbatore Zone - Dr Venkatachalam said, ""To address problems related to substandard seeds, we have listed a set of procedures to be followed by the seed dealers and distributors including Enrolment certificate, Seed service sample result etc. Non-maintenance of these procedures could invite severe penalties. We have even cancelled the licenses of four dealers in the Coimbatore zone. But, the assessment of compensation isn't added or mentioned in Seed Act or Seed rules and control order 1983. We will inform higher officials about the need to amend the act and rules.""",Farmers hit as Seed Act silent on compensation,ONION
2021-11-09,https://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/chennai/2021/nov/09/tomatoes-turn-dearer-courtesy-rains-2381175.html,"C Shivakumar By  Express News Service  CHENNAI: Heavy rains in Chennai have impacted the prices of vegetables, including tomatoes and carrots, which are now costing over Rs 100 in retail stores. If rains continue, traders said the prices may skyrocket further.  While business is dull in Koyambedu Wholesale Market, the prices of vegetables keep soaring. President of Koyambedu Vegetable Wholesale Merchants Association S Chandran told TNIE the prices of vegetables have shot up as there have been fewer arrivals. Usually, 80 trucks of tomatoes reach the city every day but on Monday, only 40 trucks reached the market, he said.  Retail shops in and around Koyambedu are selling tomatoes at Rs 100. A box of 12 kg tomatoes costs above Rs 1,000 today. So we are selling it above Rs 100, says a retail trader. President of Koyambedu Vegetable, Fruit and Flower Sellers Welfare Association M Thiagarajan told TNIE the price of tomato is expected to go up due to its unavailability.  On Sunday, tomatoes were selling at Rs 60 to Rs 65 per kg and on Monday, it touched Rs 70. On Tuesday, the price could go up by another Rs 5, he said. Until fresh crops arrive from north India, the price of tomatoes will continue to rise drastically as the traders here are competing with each other to get the vegetable, added Thiagarajan.  A woman, who was bargaining with a shopkeeper, says if the prices go up then she has to think twice about using tomatoes in curry or rasam. The prices have gone up drastically. I am finding it difficult to afford. My house owner gave me a Rs 50 note to buy a kg of tomato. How can I buy a kilo of tomato at Rs 50? she asked.  Apart from tomatoes, the price of other vegetables has also gone up by Rs 5 to Rs 10, says Chandran. Till the rains last, the vegetables will be costlier, he observed. President of Kovai Thyagi Kumaran Anaithu Kaikari Viyabarigal Sangam M Rajendran said the supply of vegetables to the market was not a problem. However, sales dropped drastically. He attributed the sales drop to the festival holidays followed by rain in the region. The wholesale price of onion per kg has gone up to Rs 40 from Rs 30 four days ago, he added.","Tomatoes turn dearer, courtesy rains",ONION

2021-11-10,https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/pune/state-agri-commissioner-flags-lack-of-transparency-in-nafed-onion-procurement-7616862/,"Maharashtras agriculture commissioner Dheeraj Kumar has flagged lack of transparency in the procurement of onion by NAFED through farmer producers. Kumar told The Indian Express that the process could end up becoming a monopoly in the hands of a few in Maharashtra.  NAFED, the central cooperative agricultural marketing body, procures onion to create buffer stock through the Price Stabilisation Fund (PSF). When wholesale prices crash in the mandis, NAFED buys onion in bulk under the Price Support Scheme (PSS). In both cases, the produce is offloaded by NAFED in consumer markets at an appropriate time. Both the schemes are implemented by NAFED through sub-agents, which are generally Farmer Producer Companies (FPC). The schemes aim to help farmers and consumers when prices are too low or too high.  Kumar, who had visited some onion procurement centers in Nashik, said, In most cases, the FPCs that are implementing the scheme do not give the farmer the prevailing price at the nearest mandi. Without this information, the farmer will be unable to make any definite decision. Many times, farmers are asked to deliver their onion at a fixed point, Kumar said. It is expected that the farmer should know the prevailing price in the markets before they deliver. But even proper receipts are often not given to the farmers, he added.  The matter assumes significance as the government has invested in onion storage structures across the state, Kumar said. The expectation is that farmers earn more if they sell through the FPC, he added. We have come to know of instances where FPCs had not even disclosed their total earning to their members. There appears to be a move to monopolise the whole onion trade through some FPCs, he said.  In future, the state government will stress on governance and transparency before awarding projects under SMART and other government schemes, Kumar said. While the business plan will be an important component, factors like how often members are intimated about the business and how information is given to them will also be considered, he added. We are working on a mechanism to bring in a matrix which will address all the concerns, he said.",Maharashtra agri commissioner flags lack of transparency in NAFED onion procurement,ONION

The drug was bought via Darknet and payment was made in Bitcoin.The accused have been identified as Karan Sajnani (24), Priyansh (22) and Sanjeev Midha (39). Around 11.15am on Monday, a Crime Branch team raided a flat in Shalimar Bagh and caught the trio and seized 1,873 grams of fine quality Canadian ganja.The selling price of the seized consignment is Rs 40,000-50,000 for each ounce (28 grams) depending upon the paying capacity of the buyer. In USA, it costs about 600 dollars per ounce, said Alok Kumar, joint commissioner (Crime).During interrogation, it was found that Sajnani had a family business of car sale and purchase. Priyansh is his friend. Their common friend, Pankaj Davar, was engaged in procuring marijuana from the US by courier to sell it in Delhi. About four months ago, Sajnani and Davar procured approximately 1.5kg of the drug. Three months ago, they had procured another consignment in the same manner. This time, Davar cheated Sajnani by not sharing the profit equitably. Sajnani then decided to work without him, said the joint commissioner.Kumar said about two months ago, Sajnani and Priyansh procured around 1kg marijuana and sold it to two men, Golu and Vicky, in Paschim Vihar. They had ordered the recent consignment a week ago, which was intercepted by the Crime Branch.Police also found that the trio used to chat with people abroad using a special app in which the conversation was automatically deleted after three days.The seller was traced on the Darkweb through an onion browser, which directs internet traffic through a free, worldwide volunteer overlay network consisting of more than 6,000 relays. After striking a deal, payment was made in Bitcoin or other cryptocurrency. Priyansh paid for the consignment using his bitcoin wallet. The drug parcels were sent through an international courier, package delivery or express mail service and sold to buyers in Delhi, said the officer.",Delhi: 3 arrested with imported marijuana worth Rs 35L,ONION

The onion price at the Yeshwantpur market was Rs 4,500 per quintal last week and it dipped to Rs 2,200. Farmers, who have not transported their produce, are also suffering losses as they cannot leave the crop in the field due to rain and there is no proper facility to store harvested onions.  Farmers said that TN traders usually buy onions from the Yeshwantpur market. Due to rain, the traders have not lifted already purchased commodities, so a lot of stock was left in the market. The traders in the market are not purchasing from farmers.  Since the supply has increased, the onion price has plunged and is hovering around Rs 2,000 per quintal, sources said.They said, We took onion loads to the Yeshwanthpur market on Saturday. We expected Rs 4,000 plus per quintal but when we reached there, prices came down and we got only Rs 1,800-2,200 depending on the quality.

The WPI data comes close on the heels of the retail inflation data, which showed it rose marginally to 4.5% in October, largely on the back of higher prices of edible oil, price of services and an uptick in vegetable prices.The WPI data showed the prices of fuel and power segment rose an annual 37.2% during the month, higher than the 24.8% in the previous month. The recent cut in excise duty and similar tax moves by states are expected to provide some relief to consumers in the months ahead.Inflation in vegetables fell 18.5% in October, while prices of potatoes declined 51.3%. Onion prices fell 25% during the month.

2021-11-17,https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/pune/how-decentralised-markets-are-ushering-in-reforms-for-farmers-in-maharashtra-7626639/,"When Suresh Senkar, a farmer from Sawargaon village in Junnar taluka of Pune district, was preparing to sell his onion produce in June, instead of the Narayangaon Mandi situated several kilometres away, he decided to try out the market operated by Vaishnavdham Paunde Farmers Produce Company (FPC) in his own village. Run by Dagdu Pawar, this FPC has been in operation since 2017, concentrating on government procurement of onion on behalf of National Cooperative Agricultural Marketing Federation (NAFED).  Since May this year, open auction has been taking place every Tuesday and Saturday at the onion storage structure of this FPC. When Pawar told me about this, I decided to bring the first lot of my total of 180-tonne produce, said Senkar, who mainly grows onion during the rabi season over 20 acres of his 50-acre holding.  There has been no looking back for Senkar who has offloaded majority of his produce at this new market with his average earning between Rs 3,400 and 3,600/quintal. I saved up on transport and got quite a decent price, said Senkar.  Even as protest continues at Delhi borders and other places over Centres three farm laws passed last year, a new experiment in market reforms has started taking baby steps in Maharashtra. Led by MahaFPC  the consortium of FPCs in the state  this reform aims to create decentralised markets in onion-growing areas wherein FPCs use their storage structure as auction halls for traders to buy directly from local farmers.  Yogesh Thorat, managing director of MahaFPC, calls this experiment as a step towards creation of stakeholders markets through which farmers would graduate from being just stock creators to becoming marketplace facilitators.  The basic principle behind this is simple  a mandi requires stakeholders, assured arrival of crops, infrastructure where traders and farmers can participate in auction and a mechanism to ensure farmers get their payment on time. Our FPCs tick all the boxes and it was just a matter of time before we took the decision to start such markets, he said.  Starting 2018, MahaOnion  a joint venture between MahaFPC and NAFED  has created a value chain as part of which village-level FPCs have procured onions on behalf of NAFED under the Price Stabilization Fund (PSF), and offloaded when prices in retail markets shot up.  As a step towards scientific storage, MahaFPC has also spearheaded creation of decentralised storage structure of 1,000 tonnes each at six places in the state. With traders and farmers coming together, these structures can assure both storage as well as space for auction, Thorat said. While these markets save farmers the transport cost, for traders, they save market cess which, at 4 per cent, is less than the 7 per cent charged in Narayangaon market, Thorat said. Also, Pawar said, farmers are paid within 25 hours of the trade being conducted.  During the auction, FPCs act as commission agent, with traders calling the prices. In case farmers do not agree to the price, they have the freedom to take back their produce. At Narayangaon market, we would have no other option but to sell at the price decided as bringing back the produce would be more costly, said Senkar.  Since it started its auction in May, Vaishnavdham FPC has seen trade of 28,000 tonnes worth Rs 2 crore. Thorat said Kamlabhavani FPC in Karmala taluka of Solapur district has also started similar auctions. We have plans to start five more stakeholder markets in the next few weeks, he said.  For Pawar, though, the auction is not without its risks  unlike mandis which take bank guarantees from traders, which are revoked in case of default in payment to farmers, the FPC and its infrastructure do not have that cushion. Our main strength is the social capital we have created after working for so many years. So, we only invite traders whom we trust. But the risk still remains, he added.  Farmers, as a whole, have given a cautious welcome to this move. Maruti Kashid, a farmer from the nearby Chincholi village, has sold around 400 quintal of his total 480-quintal onion produce at this market. Kashid took back the remaining produce as he was not satisfied with the price offered. Traders are the same everywhere, they intentionally bring down prices. I will try my luck in the Otur market, he said, even as he insisted that his overall experience at the FPC was not bad. At the end of the day, its a matter of economy; prices and overall costs will decide where I go, he said.   Stay updated with the latest Pune news.

With crops in several hundred of acres being affected, experts said demand in the market might go up in December, leading to a price hike.  Shallots arrive at central zone markets from cultivators in Tiruchy, Perambalur, Namakkal and Kallakuruchi. They will be brought to the Tiruchy wholesale market and then dispatched across the central districts. Incessant rains have affected the arrival in a big way and demand is currently being met from old stocks.  Speaking to TNIE, Vimala, Deputy Director of Horticulture Department, Tiruchy, said, Weather condition and waterlogging in fields have led to the spread of the disease in Tiruchy. Crops on over 1,000 hectares out of the total 2,000 hectares under shallot cultivation have symptoms.  As the entire area is covered under crop insurance, farmers have escaped a major financial impact. Though the actual area under shallot cultivation is more than 2,000 hectares, only a few farmers are involved in the current special season (October to December) owing to the current scenario.  M Indira, Deputy Director of Horticulture Department, Perambalur district, said, Over 40 per cent of mature crop out of the total 4,400 hectares in the district is likely to be affected by the disease.  Speaking to TNIE, Thangaraj, secretary of Tiruchy Onion Wholesalers Association, said, On Wednesday, first grade shallot was sold at Rs 45 a kg and second grade at Rs 20 a kg.  Major part of harvest this season has been taken out by the disease and old stocks are fast depleting. There are chances for a spike in demand in December and the price might once again go beyond `65 a kg. The next batch of crops is likely to be harvested in January next year.

It will not only give sufficient time to decide on healthy snacks but also prepare you for a workout plan that suits you.  For those cravings in between meals, people with diabetes can opt for dry fruits like almonds and walnuts, while hot soups are perfect as evening snack. Also, diabetics should make sure to include a high-protein meal in their routine to keep them full.  ALSO READ: Should people with diabetes avoid eating all fruits? A dietician busts myths  If you are still unsure about how to control your blood sugar levels in winters, Kanika Malhotra, Celebrity Nutritionist and weight loss specialist shares some useful tips with HT Digital.  Why diabetes management becomes tricky in winter season  ""Diabetic management might need to change once the temperature begins to come down. Thats because diabetes can be difficult to manage during the winters than during the summers because low temperatures combined with comfort food (read fried and unhealthy snacks) can make it difficult to stick to your meal plan as well as your daily workout plan,"" says Malhotra.  If you are one of those who like to curl up on the couch binge-watching your favourite series, you must take extra precautions to make sure the pounds don't pile up.  ""Extra snacking, hearty comfort meals and a lack of physical activity can lead to weight gain. Come up with a plan so that this doesnt happen,"" says Malhotra.  Carrots and cucumber are also rich in vitamins and antioxidants and help boost your immunity. (Pixabay)  The nutritionist advises people with diabetes to pick lower-calorie, lower-carb snacks such as raw veggies, popcorn or hard-boiled eggs. ""Dry fruit like almonds, walnuts, figs, pine nuts also help to keep the body warm,"" says the wellness expert.  People also love to sip tea and coffee all day long during the cold weather, but diabetics must make sure they go for healthy alternatives.  ""Make a habit to sip sugar free beverages while sitting at work or leisure like green tea, jasmine tea, chamomile tea, ginger tea etc as they help in burning extra fat and ease the process of digestion,"" says the nutritionist.  Soups and salads for evening hunger pangs  Malhotra suggests making soups and healthy warm veg salad to satiate those evening food cravings.  ""Try brewing some hot clear soups for supper to ease the hunger pangs specially during evenings. A healthy warm veg salad with two egg whites is also an amazing evening option to provide satiety when the clock strikes 5:00,"" says Malhotra.  Chicken sweet corn soup(Whirlpool of India)  Protein for dinner  A high protien meal like cottage cheese, chicken, eggs, lentils at night will help you keep fuller, says Malhotra. She also suggests adding 1 tsp of desi ghee in the diet daily for people with diabetes. ""It not only provides immunity but also helps keep ur body warm and nourished,"" she says.  Go for walks  Try not to let the cold weather prevent you from moving and getting in way of your daily workout routine.  ""Remember that the goal is to be fit all year round with five days of physical activity every week. Your warm-weather physical activities may no longer work when the temperature is below freezing, so think about other options to help you meet your activity goals during the winter months,"" says Malhotra.  She advises to include yoga in the daily routine if going to the gym is inconvenient.  Malhotra also suggests an amazing evening snack recipe you can try in winters.  Broccoli almond soup  Ingredients  3/4th broccoli flower  6-7 almonds  3-4 peppercorns  Onion and bay leaf  Method  Boil 3/4th broccoli flower for 5 minutes  Blend 6-7 almonds and 3-4 peppercorns to form a mixture  Sautee 1 finely chopped onion with 1 bay leaf till it is pinkish brown.

Along with eggs, these were the only two items that recorded a fall. However, not all vegetables followed this trend. Tomatoes were an outlier with a staggering 31% rise in costs. Their bloated costs were induced by a drastic fall in supply. Also, when demand surged, traders and retailers increased their mark-ups, inflating prices further.  Highs and lows  India's retail inflation rate, measured by the Consumer Price Index, stood at 4.91% in November. The price of oils and fats, fuel and light, and transport and communications increased the most in November. On the other hand, vegetable prices contracted by 13.62%.  Chart appears incomplete? Click to remove AMP mode  Outliers  The chart plots the retail inflation rate of vegetables in November against their assigned weights in the inflation calculation. Two of the three staple vegetables which carry much weight in the calculation  onion and potato  recorded a 30% and 45% drop in prices respectively compared to a year ago. However, the vegetable which carried the third most weight, tomato, recorded a 31% rise in prices compared to last year. No other vegetable recorded an increase of more than 20% in prices.  Costly vs cheap  A look at retail prices show that there is no distortion in inflation figures. Chart shows the retail prices of staple vegetables for the past two years. Tomato prices have been rising since October, while prices of onion and potato have softened. A kg of tomato, which cost 41 in November 2020, was 58 in November 2021  a 42% rise.  Across centres  The price of tomato was costlier across centres in November and December. In Amritsar it crossed 83/kilo in December and in Guwahati it touched 76/kilo on an average. In Bhubaneswar a kilo was bought for 70 on an average in December whereas in Bengaluru and Lucknow it crossed the 60 mark  Arrivals and mark-ups  The surge in tomato's November prices was preceded by a steep fall in their arrivals at the markets. The coloured lines in Charts 4A, 4B and 4C depict tomato arrivals in select cities in the last few November months. The coloured lines in the charts depict the average prices in November. Across all cities, a clear pattern emerges from the charts  if arrivals dip, prices surge. However, how is this price rise being managed, and who benefits from this? Charts 5A, 5B and 5C depict the difference between the wholesale price and retail price in all the months between Jan. 2017 and Nov. 2021. As can be observed, the price difference is peaking again in November 2021. This indicates that as the demand surged and supplies dropped, retailers increased their mark-up and sold at a much higher multiple than what they purchased. The graphs show that this is a routine practice almost every year-end when supplies drop and demand peaks.  Targeted mark-up  The graph shows the % of mark-up set by traders and retailers for food products in Indian cities. The data is based on a 2019 survey done by RBI. For instance, in the case of tomatoes, traders increased the price by around 20% and the retailers increased it by 40%.  Farmers don't benefit  However these markups don't translate to higher profits for farmers, especially in the case of vegetables. Results from RBI survey:  A routine event  Vegetable prices are highly volatile and increases at the year-end due to reduced supply. A similar trend was observed for onions in September 2019, when prices crossed 100/kilo. However the gains do not percolate to farmers. According to the RBI survey, farmers felt that reliable weather forecasts and better storage facilities will help in better price realisation  Source: National Horticulture Board, MOSPI, RBI  Also read: Data | Onion costs hit 100 as supply to markets dip",Data | The crux of the tomato price hike,ONION
2021-12-22,https://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/bengaluru/2021/dec/22/an-ode-to-tomatoes-2398217.html,"Hriday Ranjan By  Express News Service  BENGALURU: The last month brought in sorrow, with the news of a few vegetables prices soaring above the 100 rupees per kilo mark. Caused by heavy rains, the price-rise brought much discomfort to both farmers and consumers. Some of those vegetables were the usual suspects  capsicum, brinjal  those two overrated brother-vegetables that enjoy a niche audience and high prices. Onions were there on the list too, but our nation is no stranger to the antics of onions.  Onion prices have toppled governments in the past and shaken up hastily made coalitions of the previous decade. Our nation has its own methods of dealing with sky-rocketing onion prices. Sometimes, we are told that there is great virtue in eating satwik food, without onion and garlic. In fact, the humble garlic is not given credit. It is an indispensable part of our diet; adds taste and flavour  but never throws tantrums of price-rise and stock-shortage.  But to see tomato in the list of vegetables was a little surprising to me. India has a rich, enviable food culture dating back to thousands of years. In this long history, tomato has made a fairly recent entry. The first tomato was brought by the Portuguese in the 16th century, and its successors quickly made themselves an important part of our diet. Travel to any part of the country, and you will find the humble tomato having assimilated with the local culture. From the Punjabis, who add copious amounts of tomatoes in their Paneer Butter Masala. To down south, where we literally bathe the dish with tomato, resulting in tomato bath.  The tomatoes were such a part of our culture, that they entered our cinema too. Imaginative directors of the 80s used tomatoes (along with lemons, mangoes and other vegetables) to show budding love in the era of kiss-less cinema. Even modern filmmakers were not immune  remember the film Zindagi Milegi Na Dobara? Where the leads broke their shackles from middle-class problems by hurling tomatoes at each other in the La Tomatina?  While the prices have thankfully stabilised since, there were reports that this could have caused a shortage in the market. I cannot claim to know much about the commodities market, but it made me appreciate the many ways tomatoes found its way to my stomach everyday. I had begun to dread a time when ketchup sachets are not handed out wherever I go. Will the gold-coated samosa in a theatre taste the same without a packet of ketchup? In fact, one dares say  will our lives even be the same without the humble sachet of ketchup being silently peddled to us? From movie halls, to restaurants, to roadside Chinese stalls, to airplanes. Imagine being given the ghastly mayonnaise with samosas. Or having a plate of sinfully delicious chow-mein desecrated by pudina chutney!  Philosophers often ask us to appreciate what we have today, instead of lamenting about the past, and worrying miserably about the future. Last months spike of inflation made me appreciate the value of the tomato in my life. There are several vegetables that are native to India. Brinjal, bitter-gourd, and drumsticks. While they are all cool in their own ways, tomato is a red vegetable that makes all the others green with envy.  Pumpkin may be the National Vegetable of India. The tomato was not born in this land. In fact, in many languages, the tomato is literally called vilayati  meaning foreigner. And yet, the tomato has found its way into our lives, our cuisines, and our systems.

Kurnool district has been allocated onion processing units and Chittoor tomato processing under a scheme of the Food Processing Ministry.  Under the One District One Product Scheme, every district in Andhra Pradesh that has the highest sowing of horticulture or agriculture crop has been allocated financial support for a food processing unit funded by the Pradhan Mantri Formalisation of Micro food processing Enterprises (PMFME) Scheme.  Anantapur has become the first district in the State to ground the project sanctioned for it.  Horticulture assistant director G. Satish told The Hindu that his office had received 80 applications and of them 25 units were approved and bank finance linkage also provided under the PMFME scheme, that entitles the entrepreneur to 35% subsidy from the Food Processing Ministry, 55% bank loan, and he/she needs to invest 10% of the project cost. The maximum subsidy for a single unit has been, however, capped at 10 lakh.

The cook works a slicer through peeled raw bananas at top speed. Thin discs of fruit fall in rapid succession into a container below. Then, they are dropped with a flourish into a giant wok of boiling coconut oil. As the golden-yellow chips crisp up, they are scooped out with a large perforated ladle, and tossed in the air for a microsecond before being laid out on a tray. One cannot help but marvel at the chip-makers skill.  For anyone who has grown up in Kerala, this is a familiar sight. The Malayalis relationship with banana chips is unquestionable, not even potato in its fancy versions has been able to replace it. However, to appeal to a wider, and younger audience, the classic banana chips are now being reinterpreted.  A spicy twist  Alappuzha-based startup Beyond Snacks has come out with banana chip flavours such as peri-peri, salt and black pepper, and sour cream, onion and parsley. The idea was to give the time-tested snack a global makeover, says Manas Madhu, director of Beyond Snacks. Attempting to contemporise banana chips did seem daunting initially, but we wanted to show that it could be a lot more than just banana chips, he adds.  The team tried out a variety of flavours before narrowing it down to a few. The spiciness of peri peri worked really well, sour cream too complemented the original flavour; but tomato fell flat, Manas adds.  As an experiment, the team set up a stall at a popular consumer fair in the State and their chips were an instant hit. We had to keep getting more stock as the demand was huge. This is when we were sure that there is scope for innovation, Manas says.  The company, which launched its banana chips in 2020, now has a manufacturing unit in Kalamassery, Kochi, and is a prominent presence on e-retail platforms delivering across the country. More flavours will be rolled out soon, such as barbecue, North Indian and sweet and sour. It retains the original style classic salted version, too.  Malabar Masala flavour brought out by A1 Chips, Coimbatore | Photo Credit: Special Arrangement  In Bengaluru, PR Heaven Chips has launched five new flavours developed in-house: biryani, noodles, cheese, black pepper and tomato. While biryani is aimed at an older demographic, the noodles and cheese versions appeal to younger people and children, says Anish Swaminath, general manager of PR Heaven Chips. Unlike potato, banana has a very distinct flavour. So the new flavour should complement it, he adds.  Anish continues, Though banana chips are a Malayali staple, we seem to consume potato and tapioca chips more than banana, perhaps because we have always shied away from contemporising it. Launched in November 2021, PR Heaven Chips has its manufacturing unit in Thrissur and will soon be sold through distributors in the State and supermarkets.  Delhi-based Motherland Aromatic South has tied up with the 55-year-old, Coimbatore-based traditional chips maker A1 Chips to bring in a twist to tradition. Banana chips with the flavour of curry leaves, thin chips with rock salt and sweet ripe ones are the versions sold online. We wanted to give a gourmet aesthetic to banana chips and tap into another socio-economic bracket, says Devika Mohan, brand manager. It has been available online across the country for the past two years and the response has been great, she adds.  The nendran variety of bananas works the best for chips, say the brands, as cavendish varieties may be lacking in flavour. Most companies now have automated machinery that makes the chips. Even the frying time is controlled.  Traditional players  Now, even traditional players are welcoming change. A1 Chips has over 11 flavours, including chilli masala, Malabar masala, salsa masala, sweet chilli, pepper, aloo tandoori and honey for a sweet touch. It is all about adapting to newer tastes. Banana chips are our signature product, and anything we add to it only improves its value, says Sudeesh Dhamodaran, joint managing director of A1 Chips. The brand has 53 outlets in various parts of South India, all of which have these varieties. Sudeesh, however, loves to eat original Kerala banana chips dipped in lime pickle. It is the best, he says.  Abhirami N, managing partner of N Vasudevan Banana Chips and Halwa in Kozhikode, says the business gives ample scope for experimentation, but demand is still more for the conventional salted banana chips. However, there are two variations  pepper and chilli  that are available. When she took over the 45-year-old family business started by her father, Abhirami realised that a lot of factors go into the perfection of the final product. We still use coconut husk in the traditional stove where the chips are made; I believe all this adds to the taste of the product, she says.",Banana chips get a global makeover,ONION
