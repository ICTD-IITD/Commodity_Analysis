The concrete barricades, thorny iron fences and powerful water cannons have not been able to prevent their tractor trollies from reaching the vicinity of the national capital. They have been so determined and prepared that the Delhi winter has failed before them. Assembled in their thousands, they have established a new way of life at Singhu, Tikri, Ghazipur, Noida and Shahjahanpur. In some manner, the upsurge by these farmers resembles the Occupy Wallstreet Movement in the United States, in 2011, whose slogan reverberates even today across the world: We are the 99 percent.Unflinching willpowerThe government might have thought that the farmers would retreat to their villages after a couple of days or a week at the most, but this is not the mood at all among the farmers. As a frequent visitor to one or the other centres of struggle, this writer would definitely say that this farmers struggle is unique in the history of free India. A self-contained lifestyle with all necessary arrangements for food, shelter, clothing, and sanitation are in place. Scores of them, young and old, with whom this writer could interact with, represent the unflinching will of a people who consider agriculture as their culture. Their utmost proximity to soil and nature has tempered them as steel, while helping them remain calm and cool at the same time.Farmers protest | Farmers to escalate protest if deadlock continues on January 4The firefighters in the government who talk in different terms (may be purposefully), might have prepared their own strategy to face this struggle of the annadatas. Some of them say that the doors of dialogue are always kept open. There are certain others who are stubborn in saying that there can be no compromise on the implementation of the three Farm Bills. There are also those who still promise to take a relook if necessary, but only after two years. There is no need to ponder on this as most of these officials have been trained in a certain ideological school. As part of their campaign of malignment, the propaganda managers have labelled the farmers Khalistanis and urban naxalites.But these sons and daughters of the soil, who sow the seeds of hope to feed their fellow beings, have maintained inimitable self-restraint. Their struggle, their unity, their patience, and the massive nature of their battle are having an impact on the cohesive nature of the ruling alliance, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA). Following in the footsteps of NDA ally, the Shiromani Akali Dal that walked out of the NDA in support of the farmers, the Rashtriya Loktantrik Party has also snapped its ties with the alliance. Another important party that shares power with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Haryana continues to remain unhappy with the central governments approach to the farmers issues.The Narendra Modi government expected the farmers to tire out and slowly retreat from the battlefront. But it is mistaken. The determination by the farmers to go on with the struggle is only strengthening by the day. The Prime Minister himself has come forward to lead a frontal attack on the annadatas. Recently, he minced no words in expressing his disappointment while accusing the struggle of being a politically motivated one. The thrust of his attack was evident when he criticised the Opposition as misleading the farmers and shooting from their shoulders to target the government. In this tirade, the Prime Minister pointed a finger against the Left-led government in Kerala.Farmers protests | Ready to celebrate Lohri at the borders, but theres no going back now, say farmersThe situation in KeralaAll the allegations that he has levelled against the Kerala government are unfounded, and far from truth. In his exhortation that there are no Agricultural Produce Market Committees (APMCs) and mandis in Kerala, he presumed that the concept of the Minimum Support Price is not prevalent in the State. He has shut his eyes to the basic truth about the agricultural scenario in Kerala.It is true that mandis regulated by an APMC are not in existence in Kerala. But it does not mean that the interests of farmers are not taken care of in the State. In fact, Kerala is the State where farmers rights are being protected by the government itself, and much more effectively than any other Indian State.Also read | Do new agri Bills impact Kerala?While the government of India has fixed the procurement rate for rice at 18 a kg, the Left Democratic Front government in Kerala is procuring rice from cultivators at 27.48 a kg. In the same manner copra (dried coconut) is also procured at a much higher rate in Kerala than the price announced by the central government. Kerala is the State where increased basic price is ensured not only for paddy but also vegetables and fruits. Sixteen such items are enlisted by the government where the basic prices (per kg) are guaranteed. To cite some of them, tapioca (12), banana (30), garlic (139), pineapple (15), tomato (8), string beans (34), ladies fingers (20), cabbage (11) and potato (20).Apart from crop insurance, paddy cultivators will get the royalty in Kerala at the rate of 2,000 per hectare. They have a pension too, which is something unique in India. In 2006, when farmers suicides became the order of the day across the country, the Left Front government introduced a debt relief commission that extended a helping hand to the farmers, thereby saving them.Also read | Kerala Assembly passes resolution urging Centre to scrap farm lawsThere is basis for a counterNo BJP-led government in the country can even imagine the measures that the Left government in Kerala has initiated for the welfare of farmers. Instead of understanding those measures, the Prime Minister has chosen to train his political guns on the Kerala government and the farmers. The influence of corporates on his allegations is clear. The Left has the moral and political authority to engage in any polemics with the BJP-led central government in this regard.It is intriguing why the Prime Minister has never said a word about the experience of Bihar where mandis were abolished in 2006 and the plight of farmers that only worsened after this measure was initiated. After the three farm ordinances of June 2020, 40% of mandis in Madhya Pradesh have registered only zero transactions.Also read | Mandis not an option for Kerala: Agriculture MinisterThe corporate stampThis is the reality of the farm Bills. Though they claim to enable the protection and the empowerment of farmers, the truth is just the opposite. The purpose of these laws is the enabling of the corporatisation of Indian agriculture and the introduction of contract farming. When Ministers continue to assure the continuance of mandis they are practically pushed out of the scene, as it happened in Madhya Pradesh and elsewhere. The annadatas have been able to foresee the evil in the three farm laws that would eventually find them at the mercy of corporate profit mongers. They know that these laws would ruin the backbone of the agricultural economy and badly affect the food security of India.Also read | You are being misled, Narendra Modi tells farmersThe farmers are in the struggle in order to prevent such a calamity from happening.

Chandrasekhar Rao has called up N. Nagi Reddy of Ranzole village and enquired about his potato crop. The conversation is reported to have continued for about five minutes.Mr. Chandrasekhar Rao asked Mr. Nagi Reddy whether the cultivated area has remained the same or had come down.The farmer replied that compared with previous years it was reduced but by and large remained at about 2000 acres whereas it used to be about 3,000 acres in that area. The seed is called Pokaraj166 variety. As we felt this is good we went for this crop in Zaheerabad area. Each plant yields about eight to 10 potatoes which weighs nearly a kilogram. Per acre yield will be 15 to 16 bags. The crop growth is very impressive. It is some 45 days since the crop was sown. Jahangeer is speaking with me once in a while, said the farmer adding that they never counted on how many plants there are per acre and added that the total yield was estimated to be between 12 and 15 tonnes.The farmer explained that while potato in white colour which is cultivated in black soil will fetch a better price of 200 per quintal, the crop grown in red soil commands a lower price of about  175 per quintal. Mr. Nagi Reddy also informed the Chief Minister that the yield would begin in 85 days and water should be stopped to the crop 15 days before harvest.

Wondering how it works? Read on.How does GM diet promise?GM diet is known to have been formulated in General Motors Corp in 1987, to tackle weight and health issues faced by its employees. It was field-tested at John Hopkins Research Centre and then approved for distribution by the board of directors of GM Corp.According to gmdiet.in, the diet plan works on providing simple nutrients to burn calories than adding further to your body, on a seven-day schedule which would enable weight loss, body detox and giving body cleansing benefits too. The diet claims to focus on eating wisely rather than starving.GM diet menuGM diet can be both vegetarian and non-vegetarian  while the diet remains the same for both groups on the first four days, it changes as per ones food preferences on day 5,6 and 7. Heres a brief look at the diet plan:On day 1, you can eat sweets and tangy fruits like melons, to keep you full for a long time. Other fruits include strawberries, apples, watemelon, and cantaloupe.Also Read | Have you heard of cookie diet?

Choose a salad, boiled vegetables and ample water to keep your body hydrated, mentions gmdiet.net.On day 4, soup is recommended but more bananas and milk are to be consumed. 8 medium-sized bananas and 3 glasses of skimmed milk must be consumed over the day, as suggested by the website.Bananas are an integral part of the diet plan.

This can be consumed in two meals along with six tomatoes. Vegetarians can replace meat with cottage cheese or brown rice in addition to tomatoes.On day 6, meat (or cottage cheese) and vegetables are recommended with no tomatoes.On day 7, the last day, more fruits and vegetables are to be added to the diet.Apart from these foods, GM diet focusses on drinking enough water  about six to eight glasses each day.Also Read | Should you follow keto diet for weight loss? A clinical dietitian answersIs GM diet sustainable?This diet plan involves the consumption of low-calorie or negative-calorie foods which provide fewer calories than they take to digest, thereby promoting weight loss. Besides, it emphasises drinking water which helps detoxify the body. But like most other fad diets, experts are divided in their opinion about whether this diet plan is sustainable.According to medicalnewstoday.com, the diet lacks essential vitamins and minerals that come with eating a variety of healthy foods daily. Besides, most days of the entire diet plan provide low amounts of protein, which, researchers argue, can decrease appetite and promote weight loss.Moreover, the diet can only lead to temporary weight loss. Once the GM diet plan is over, it is likely that you would regain weight once you resume your normal diet, according to Healthline.For more lifestyle news, follow us: Twitter: lifestyle_ie | Facebook: IE Lifestyle | Instagram: ie_lifestyle",GM diet: Know all about the diet plan that promises weight loss in just seven days,POTATO

But going just by the looks of it may prove fatal considering the extent of spurious food that have made their way into the open markets, particularly from Cuttack. The recent raids by the Commissionerate Police are a pointer to the volume of fake and sub-standard food items laced with chemicals flooding the markets.What are you consuming?From ghee, honey, turmeric and chilli powders to tomato sauce and soya chunks, the food adulteration network runs deep. The products are prepared using harmful chemicals, colours and sold to unsuspecting consumers at cheaper rates. A report suggests that spurious ghee is a heady mix of palm oil, vanaspati and yellow chemical colour; honey is prepared using water, sugar and chemical colour. For turmeric powder, the adulterators use waste rice powder and non-edible synthetic yellow colour.The list does not end here. Soya chunks are prepared using flour and ammonium bicarbonate (a levelling agent) that makes the dough light and airy besides, chilli powder is laced with non-edible aniline dyes. The innocuous ketchups that go into your noodles, rolls and fast food are prepared using cheap red, orange and green colours along with a mixture of pumpkin, potato and tomato paste. These sauces are easily available in the market and commonly used by street food vendors.Capital Hospitals Department of Forensic Medicine and Toxicology (FMT) consultant Dr LK Behera says adulterated food can cause serious health hazards and lead to diseases like cancer. Turmeric is often adulterated by mixing wood powder and can cause obstruction in the intestine while chemicals in food products can cause cancer, gastroenteritis, liver and skin diseases, and others, he says.Profits First, Health SecondThe trade of spurious food is booming and food adulterators make a profit of 200 per cent (pc) through the illegal trade as cost of production is cheap.For example, production cost of a kg of refined honey is Rs 200 but that of adulterated honey is only Rs 40 which though sells for Rs 140 per kg in the market, says a report by Commissionerate Police. Whereas pure honey costs Rs 300 a kg and has a profit margin of 15 pc, sale of spurious honey brings 100 pc profit.Similarly, production of branded and popular tomato or chilli sauce would cost Rs 120 per kg but the spurious and low-quality costs only Rs 30. The genuine sauce costs Rs 160 per kg having a profit margin of 20 pc but the fake one is sold at Rs 70 per kg with an 80 pc profit margin.The production cost of pure turmeric and chilli powders is Rs 150 per kg and adulterated is Rs 70 per kg. Unadulterated turmeric and chilli powders are available for Rs 260 per kg with a profit margin of 20 pc and the spurious powders are sold for Rs 120 per kg having a profit margin of about 60 pc.Similarly, adulteration of clarified butter or ghee is equally profitable with the unscrupulous elements earning 40 pc profit from the business. Production of ghee costs Rs 300 per kg and a kg of the spurious stock can be prepared with just Rs 80. Pure ghee is available in the market between Rs 350 and Rs 500, the spurious counterpart is available at Rs 150 a kg.When it comes to soybeans, production cost is Rs 60 per kg as compared to Rs 30 per kg for the unadulterated item. Soybeans are sold for Rs 80 per kg in the market with 15 pc profit margin as compared to Rs 50 for the adulterated product having 40 pc profit margin. Its the high profit margin which drives these spurious food manufactures to sustain, says Cuttack DCP Prateek Singh who has gone after the adulterators in his area of operation.The Market & ConsumersThe recent raids show food adulteration mafia operates mostly out of Cuttack city and Jagatpur which are hubs of manufacturing consumer goods besides outskirts of the Millennium City where they can remain low-profile. The businesses have been flourishing as surveillance by Cuttack district administration as well as the municipal corporation is next to nothing.The consumer base, though, is spread across the region and food class. Much of the low-standard food is consumed by caterers which use the cost advantage to save on spending. Fast food makers are a big consumer base too as they pay little attention to health and hygiene; nor do their buyers.These manufacturers also focus on suburban and rural landscape of neighbouring districts where quality of packaged food is never under scrutiny due to poor surveillance of Food Supplies and Consumer Welfare Department, says an officer.Last year, Commissionerate Police alone registered 21 cases against production of adulterated food items and arrested 25 persons arrested while seizing goods worth over Rs 7.36 crore. This means the overall business of such spurious food manufacturers run into tens of crores rupees across the State, just going by the volume exposed by Twin City Police.Intensifying SurveillanceThe raids have led to alarm but also brought relief from people in general that adulterated food is being obliterated from the markets. Locals have urged police to continue raids at food manufacturing units to arrest the menace. Surveillance is the need of the hour, they said. Apparently, such illegal units continue to thrive due to complacence of the municipal corporations and district administrations. Consider this: Odisha scored only 53.15 pc in Food Safety and Standards Authority of Indias second State Food Safety Index in 2019-20.This index is based on performance of the State on five significant parameters - human resources and institutional data, compliance, food testing (infrastructure and surveillance), training and capacity building, and consumer empowerment. The Index is a dynamic quantitative and qualitative benchmarking model that provides an objective framework for evaluating food safety across all States/UTs. FSSAI states that states scoring below 60 pc score need a push.Keep an Eye on PricesCuttack-Bhubaneswar Police Commissioner Sudhanshu Sarangi has urged citizens to not compromise with price while buying food items as adulterated products cost less in open markets. People must inform police if they find the price of a food product to be surprisingly low.Our raids will continue so that health is not a casualty. We have also requested Odisha Industrial Infrastructure Development Corporation to review the land allotment of the units found to be involved in manufacturing adulterated food items and take necessary action against them, said Sarangi.Food adulteration is conducted to alter the taste and quantity and can have serious impacts on an individuals health. People must be alert, Dr Behera cautions.",Poison on the plate: Markets see rise in fake food products,POTATO

The wholesale price of onions that had reached 90 a kg over the last two months, is now down to 30 a kilo, said Ravi Kumar from the Bangalore Onion and Potato Traders Association. At present, onions are retailing at around 45, but a price correction over the next two weeks is expected.Onions are a staple ingredient but consumers were upset not only by the high prices but also by the low quality that was being sold. The new onions, a fresh harvest from Maharashtra, are dry and of a high quality.Shubha J., a software engineer, said that for the three months when the price of onions peaked, it had been tough cooking. We use onions almost every day. Even if you were ready to pay, there were no quality onions available in the market. Most of them were wet and sprouted, and would spoil in just a matter of days. The arrival of new onions is something to celebrate, she said.Chandrashekhar Hebbar, president, Karnataka Regional Hotels and Restaurants Association, said they were happy that good quality onions had come back with a price connection. Onions are a staple, especially in North Indian and Chinese cuisines. Even South Indian too, we had stopped selling onion dosas over the last three months, which we will reintroduce now. The ideal price for us would be at 25, a kilo, which we hope it will come down to in the next few weeks, he said.According to Ravi Kumar, a new crop has been harvested in Nashik and surrounding districts of Maharashtra, which has been flooding the States markets over the last one week. The previous crop was severely damaged due to heavy rains and floods, which had made the onions wet. Thankfully, there were no untimely rains this season, and the onions are of a good quality, he explained.After the previous crop was damaged due to floods, leading to a price escalation in the market, many farmers have planted a second crop in the State in the hope of cashing in on the rally in prices, sources said. The second crop in our State - in Belagavi, Haveri and Molakalmuru - is expected to be harvested by month end. There are crops that have been harvested in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, most of which are flooding markets in North India already. So the harvest of the crop in the State is unlikely to have a market in other States, and this will likely create a glut in the market, crashing the prices further, explained a senior onion trader at Yeshwanthpur APMC Yard.",High-quality onions from Maharashtra flood markets,POTATO

The information gathered by The Indian Express, however, reveals that the food parks have not given much fillip to crop diversification.The first such project  International Mega Food Park Limited (IMFPL) worth Rs 130 crore and spread in an area of 55 acres  was set up in Fazilka district. It ran into financial trouble in 2018, nearly four years after becoming operational in October 2014 during the Harsimrats second tenure as Union Food Processing Minister.Read | Pune start-up helps farmers make crops more resilient to changing climateA functionary of the IMFPL informed that the park had been in financial trouble and National Company Law Tribunal had appointed an administrator for resurrecting the it and infuse investment by new investors.The functionary said the only facility which was currently functional there was a venture by Schreiber Dynamix Dairies Private Limited (SDDPL) and Tetra Pak South Asia Markets, manufacturing beverages using fruit concentrates.Before it ran into fiscal woes, the park housed facilities for processing milk and manufacturing milk powder (Novello brand), Individually Quick Frozen (IQF) line to freeze peas and power generation from husk, among others.On June 30, 2019, IMFPL chairman and managing director Sukhinder Singh was booked by the Central Bureau of Investigation for allegedly orchestrating a fraud of Rs 33 crore  the amount it had taken as loan from the Small Industries Development Bank of India (SIDBI).As per the FIR, the fraud where bills of industrial machinery were allegedly forged, was carried out by the IMFPL through its machinery supplier, Food & Biotech Engineers Pvt Ltd. The FIR also named Sukhinders wife Kanwal Sukhinder Singh, son Simarinder Singh, and others.Explained | How can Punjab achieve crop diversification?The second project of Union Food Processing ministry promoted and developed by Punjab Agro Industries Corporation (PAIC) in Ladhowal in Ludhiana, as per the information gathered by The Indian Express reveals, has an occupancy of only little more than 33 per cent of the plotted area.The Rs 117-crore PAIC project, which also goes by the name of Gur Kirpa Mega Food Project, is yet to be formally inaugurated. Three players, however, had started their operations in the park between 2018 and 2019, said a government functionary.In the total plotted area of 54 acres out of the total 100 acres of the project land (which include roads, green belt and other parameters), 12 food processing units have come forward to start operations on 17 acres of land.Also Read | For farmers, agency means choiceGodrej Tyson, which is into ready to eat and cook products and frozen food; Iscon Balaji, which is into production of potato flakes; and Meat Masters, which is into frozen meat products, have already started commercial production at PAIC food park.

Bajwa said a cut was made by the Centre in third tranche of the grant as there was less than 25 per cent of the plot occupancy in the park at that time.Grants are released conditionally. To receive fourth grant, a minimum of 75 per cent plots should have been sold, said Bajwa, adding that state government cannot do much in that scenario and it depended entirely on market players coming forward to buy plots.Opinion | Govt must promote crop diversification by setting MSP for other crops as wellThe plot occupancy in the Ludhiana park remains around 33 per cent, despite the fact that any industrialist setting up a unit can get loan from NABARD. There is another incentive  the industry is offered 35 per cent subsidy, maximum upto Rs 5 crore, on plant and machinery.Bajwa, meanwhile, added that we are coming up with a state-of-the-art food testing laboratory, which would have certification from National Accreditation Board (NABL).The third and latest of the three projects in Punjab, Sukhjit Mega Food Park and Infra Limited (SMFPIL), was inaugurated by Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar in November last year, after Harsimrat quit the Union Cabinet.The 107.83-crore project is spread over 55 acres in Kapurathalas Rehana Jattan village. The land has been taken on a 30-year lease by the promoter. The Centre has so far released a grant of Rs 38.76 crore.The mega food park, among other operations, is aimed at encouraging cultivation of maize in the region, which had been a traditional maize growing belt before the crop pattern tilted towards wheat-paddy cycle.We are moving towards stabilization phase, said SMFPIL CMD Bhavdeep Sardana. We have set up a maize-based anchor unit at a cost of over Rs 100 crore. The central and Punjab governments have encouraged us to create facilities to give an alternate option to the farmers, other than paddy. The park will cater to traditional maize growing belt. The idea is to create industrial demand, said Sardana, elaborating that products lines in the park would include starches, sweeteners, starch derivates which go into food and beverages, pharmaceuticals, textiles, papers and poultry and cattle feed.Sardana, however, said that due to Covid-19 pandemic, and a policy clause, both big and small investors, respectively, were not coming forward to set up the units in the park.He added that while big investors had postponed their investment activities, the smaller ones were not going for getting plots as they are not allowed to mortgage the leased land to get loans.Due to Covid, Sardana said, there were delays in commissioning of the machinery imported from China for the anchor plant as zoom meetings were the only way where technical assistance was being sought to commission the machinery.He added that once we reach full capacity, we would be able to process 600 tonnes maize a day and more than 2 lakh tonnes per annum.Marketing of maize will be no longer a problem for farmers. They can sell in vicinity. Not only maize, they can also sell vegetables like carrot, peas, cauliflower etc if the local entrepreneurs join hands to set up such units in the park, said Sardana.Noted agri-economist and Chancellor of Central University of Punjab at Bathinda, Sardara Singh Johl said, I do not see any crop diversification happening in Punjab. Until and unless there is assurance of equal marketing and income as is the case with wheat and paddy, there are no chances of crop diversification.Johl added that while designing such mega food projects, the viability has to be seen. He added that comprehensive scheme should be in place, demand for the alternate crops should be created and businessmen and industrialists should be taken on board.Harsimrat was not available for comments despite repeated attempts.",Food Parks — the mega push that did mighty little for crop diversification,POTATO
2021-01-09,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/zaki-ur-rehman-lakhvi-the-terror-mastermind/article33538780.ece,"Mumbai attack mastermind jailed over fears of FATF action over terror financingJust six days after his arrest on January 2, Zaki-ur-Rehman Lakhvi, the known Lashkar-e-Taiba mastermind of the 2008 Mumbai terror strikes, was sentenced to a five-year jail term on terror financing charges on January 8.The speed with which the wheels of justice turned in Pakistan in the case of Lahkhvis terror financing case are in sharp contrast to the years he remained charged in the Mumbai attack case, in which he was eventually bailed out.Also read: Ahead of crucial FATF meeting, Pakistan arrests LeT leader LakhviIts evident that where Indian pressure and American prodding didnt work in ensuring Lakhvis conviction in the Mumbai terror strikes, in which 166 persons were killed, Islamabads fears about punitive action from the Financial Action Task Force, or FATF, seem to have done the trick.Islamabad has been facing the heat from the financial watchdog for some time on the issue of terror financing and has called upon Pakistan to make sure it complies fully with its action plan prior to a key FATF meeting in February.Saeeds convictionLakhvis sentence is also in line with that of Jamaat-ud-Dawa chief Hafiz Saeeds conviction in four terror-financing cases in November and February 2020. In October 2020, FATF decided that Pakistan would remain on its grey list, pending full compliance with its action plan.In a statement, FATF said Pakistan needed to work in four areas to address strategic deficiencies as far as terror financing was concerned. Among other things, Pakistan needed to demonstrate effective implementation of targeted financial sanctions against all [UN-mandated] 1267 and 1373 designated terrorists.Also read: U.S. welcomes arrest of 26/11 attack mastermind and LeT commander LakhviSo, here we have the context behind all the action from the Pakistani establishment relating to Lakhvi and Saeed, who prospered and thrived in the warm embrace of the Pakistani establishment for decades. They are now being treated as a public liability and, hence, the arrests and rather speedy convictions.Also, key for the Pakistan Army/ intelligence establishment is that their convictions are not in relation to an India-related terrorist case. Bending before India, or being seen to be bending before India, is not good policy for any Pakistani establishment. The fallout of an India-terror related conviction would be a hot potato to handle, given that many key figures in the Pakistani establishment said at the time of the Mumbai terror strikes that these had been conducted by India itself.Also read: India terms action against Lakhvi a farceIn Lakhvis case, the prosecution seems to have had its way with the Lahore anti-terrorism court judge. The court was informed that Lakhvi was a founding member of the banned LeT, which was proscribed in the country in 2002 due to its involvement in terrorism, while the United Nation Security Council (UNSC) has also imposed financial restrictions on him, The Express Tribune reported on Friday. The court held that a dispensary was under Lashkars charge and being used for terrorist purposes.In all, the Dawn newspaper reported that the Pakistani Punjabs counter-terrorist department had registered 41 FIRs against Jamaat-ud-Dawa (the parent wing of the Lashkar) leaders, of which trial courts had decided as many as 27 cases.Strategic decisionIts clear that a strategic decision has been taken to shut down the JuD-Lashkar combine by the Pakistani establishment. However, even during his time as an under trial detainee in Adiala jail, Rawalpindi, Lakhvi could receive guests and use the Internet, access a mobile phone and watch television. He is even believed to have fathered a child while in jail. So, the jury will have to wait and watch what kind of jail treatment awaits Lakhvi this time.The secrecy with which the Pakistani deep State operates makes it difficult to assess what exactly is happening. A recent arrest warrant for Masood Azhar, leader of the Jaish-e-Muhammad, confirms after years the presence of the wanted terrorist in Pakistan. Remember that Azhar was one of the terrorists exchanged by India in return for the passengers of the hijacked Indian Airlines flight to Kandahar in December 1999. Given their being creatures of the Pakistani establishment, and the enduring interest in using non-State actors to foment trouble in Jammu and Kashmir, its quite likely that new outfits may have already received the blessings of the deep State. For now, Lakhvi and Saeed are in jail. Azhars fate will be keenly watched in India.",Zaki-ur-Rehman Lakhvi | The terror mastermind,POTATO

Roshne Balasubramanian and Vaishali Vijaykumar give you...Sugar cane juice pongal by Shanthi Ramachandran(Instagram @shaanthram)IngredientsRice: 1 cup (150 g) Moong dal: 1 tbsp Sugarcane juice: 2 cups (You can prepare using the stalk at home or use store-bought juice) Jaggery/palm sugar/kalkandu:  cup or required Ghee: 100 g or required amount Cashew, raisins, coconut pieces for garnishingMethodTake a pan. Add some ghee and roast the moong dal. Keep it aside. Take the rice in a strainer and wash it. Roast it in ghee for a minute in the pan.Add the sugarcane juice, one cup of milk, one cup of water and pressure-cook it on medium flame for about five to six whistles (without keeping the inner vessel) until the rice turns soft.Now, add half a cup of powdered jaggery/palm jaggery or natural brown sugar or karuppatti as per your preference.The pongal will melt but will start to thicken after cooking for a few minutes.

Mix well and serve.VariationsYou can use any millet instead of rice.While saffron is not added in traditional south Indian pongal, if you wish, you can add it along with a very small pinch of edible camphor.TipsFor pongal, pudu paccha arisi is recommended because it gives a lovely fresh fragrance and turns soft quickly. It is also much cheaper than regular rice variants. Use of pudu paccha arisi is also considered very auspicious during Pongal because its a symbolic celebration of nature and its harvest.Puli Pongal by Jeyashri Suresh(Instagram @Jeyashris Kitchen)IngredientsBroken rice/arisi kurunai: 1 cup Tamarind a lemon sized Sesame oil: 2 tbsp + 2 tsp Mustard seeds: 1/4 tsp Peanuts: 2 tbsp Chana dal: 1 tsp Urad dal: 1 tsp Green chilli: 1 Dried red chilli: 2 Water: 3 1/2 cups Turmeric powder: 1/4 tsp Asafoetida: a generous pinch Curry leaves: few Salt as neededMethodSoak a small lemon-sized tamarind in 1/2 cup hot water for 10 minutes.

Cook for two more minutes. Turn the heat off. Temper with mustard seeds, curry leaves and 2-3 red chillies broken to pieces in one tablespoon sesame oil. We dont add chopped cilantro/coriander leaves to this sambar.Red rice ven pongal by Padma Balasubramanian(Instagram @Padma Balasubramanian)IngredientsRed rice: 1 cup Moong dal: 1/4 cup Pepper: 1 tsp Jeera: 1 tsp Hing powder: 1/2 tsp Ginger: a small piece, finely chopped Curry leaves: a few Cashews: 10 Ghee: 2 tbsp Oil: 1 tbspMethodWash and soak red rice for an hour in 3.5 glasses of water. Wash the moong dal, drain water and add it to the soaked red rice. Transfer to a pressure cooker and cook for six whistles. Keep the stove in sim for another five minutes and switch off.

Inflation in the primary articles group contracted for the first time in five months at 1.6% in December, while wholesale food inflation declined 1.1% during the month compared with 13.3% in the same year earlier month.Arrival of fresh supplies helped ease prices in cereals and vegetables. Cereals contracted an annual 6.5%, while vegetable prices fell 13%. Onion prices, which had been on fire earlier, contracted 55% in December, while wheat prices dipped 11%. Inflation in potato prices persisted and rose 38%, third consecutive month of elevated prices.The trajectory of the WPI data was similar to the retail inflation data , which was released earlier and showed a sharp moderation in December on the back of softening of food prices and improved supplies. The WPI data also showed that core inflation (excluding food and fuel) rose to a 24-month high of 4.2%, which economists said injected an element of uncertainty over the trajectory of WPI in the months ahead. Wholesale prices will continue to see a moderate pick-up in the coming months, especially in manufacturing, owing to firming up of global metal prices following the opening up of the economy, said Madan Sabnavis , chief economist at Care Ratings .",Wholesale inflation eases to 4-mth low at 1.2% in Dec,POTATO
2021-01-16,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/akus-burgers-in-delhi-are-yum/article33586630.ece,"In Delhi, AKUS: The Brrgrr Co. delivers burgers that come together well at different levels: the softness of the patty, the umami of the cheese, the sweetness of brown onions, and the juicy pattyOur young neighbours are great foodies, so we have detailed food conversations. I mentioned AKUS: The Brrgrr Co. to them one evening, and they assured me that the burgers were Yum. I had first heard about this place when some friends marked an anniversary picnic with AKUS. The praise that followed prompted me to take a look at this burger heaven. I found that it had an outlet in Gurugram and Delhis Defence Colony (call 8826669279).I looked at the menu and saw that they had an interesting mix of burgers: freshly minced lamb patties, chicken breasts, or a prawn patty. We asked for three kinds: a Bold Bingo, Meister and Chalapeno.I had the Bold Bingo, tasted the other two, and loved them all! Mine had a lamb patty, blue cheese, caramelised onions, blended cheese and lettuce. The buns were soft, lamb was juicy, the blue cheese gave it a just-right piquancy, and the lettuce lent crunch.The patty wasnt smothered with sauce (as some MNC burgers are), so it didnt drip messily, but gave the burger a kick. A young nephew who had a Bold Bingo the next day said that the meat, cheese and onions complemented one another well, and what really worked for him was the fact that the burger didnt become a gooey mess in his hands, and the size was just right.The Chalapeno had a stuffing of a grilled chicken breast, cheese blend, lettuce, jalapeo, peppers and jalapeo spread. This was ordered keeping in mind that one member of the household loves hot food  and she felt it was the best shed ever had.The master was the Meister  a lamb patty, with a fried egg, bacon, cheese, caramelised onions and sauce. The egg and the bacon (imported, says the menu) gave the burger a delicious twist. And the egg, of course, added another level of texture and taste.In the vegetarian section, there is a burger called Master Wu with wild mushroom and jalapeos, and a Master Blu with wild mushroom and blue cheese. The grilled Beetburger has a beetroot patty, and the Giza consists of a crisp potato and cheese patty. There is a gluten-free bun on offer, and a DIY kit.If youre hearty eater, this burger wont be enough for a meal. You may need side dishes, or if you are a growing boy (like the aforementioned nephew), you may want to have a full meal after the burger.There are quite a few sides, too. House made chicken nuggets with honey mustard mayo, skin-on French fries, onion rings and more. The fries are of three types: with salt and parsley, paprika, or truffle Parmesan and parsley.Prices range from 250 to 285 for vegetarian, and between 250 and 450 for the non-vegetarian burgers.Now I know why the young neighbours thought the burgers were yum. They indeed are. Yummilicious, Id say.The writer is a seasoned food critic",The burger with a good mouth and hand feel at AKU’S Delhi,POTATO

2021-02-11,https://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/chennai/2021/feb/11/pressure-that-pleases-the-palate-2262302.html,"Anushree Madhavan ByExpress News ServiceCHENNAI: Imagine this. You are in a foreign land, in a small apartment with not many vessels to cook in, and you are craving for a bowl of piping hot sambar saadam. What do you do? If you are someone like B Ramakrishnan, or Ramki as he is fondly called, you would resort to the One Pot One Shot (OPOS) cooking method.After all, it was this craving for sambar while in Bahrain that led the masterchef of the OPOS methd on this journey, nearly 15 years ago. Since the success of his first book  OPOS Cookbook: 5 Minute Magic  in 2018, Ramki has upgraded his recipes for his recent launch The Complete OPOS Cookbook. Here, he introduces the concept of pressure baking, cold pressure deep fry and other new techniques.Journey in the kitchenFor Ramakrishnan, cooking is a science and every recipe is a problem to be solved. My journey into cooking is similar to what each one of us has gone through. Cooking is like drawing a freehand circle that is taught by your mom. How much ever you practise, you will not be able to draw as precisely as your mom can. And it takes a lot of experience and skill to draw a freehand circle. Traditional cooking is like that because there are a lot of variables involved.Even if you follow every single step precisely, the results will be different for your mom and you. There are things that you have to learn by experience  when to add what ingredients, when it is cooked, etc. And this is why cookbooks do not do a good job of teaching cooking. This is why many of us who learn cooking from a cookbook give up on this art out of frustration. The result we get is nowhere near what is shown in the book, he details. Ramki also had his tryst with cookbooks while in the Middle East.And he was on the brink of giving up on cooking when he realised that the problem was not with him but with the cookbooks. I am an engineer. If I have to design a car or a gear box, the solution is straightforward  take a manual and follow the instructions. They are precise, and no subjectivity involved. When I was trying to learn cooking from a cookbook, I found the instructions were contradictory, confusing, and very subjective.Two books teach different ways to make sambar and each book claims theirs is the proper method. When I realised the problem is with the instructions in the cookbook, I was trying to figure out how cooking can be made into a science, and recipes into scientific experiment where there is no subjectivity. You dont look for kai manam or kai pakkuvam in a scientific experiment, do you? So, I wanted to convert an art into science, he elaborates.I ntroducing OPOSFor everyone to get the same results while making a recipe, Ramki realised that the equipment had to be the same  like with your Chemistry experiments. Rice is the perfect example. The steps to cook rice in Chennai or Himalayas is the same. It is not subjective. Even a child can follow that. My idea was to make all recipes similar to cooking rice.But for cooking, the equipment, heat source, cooking conditions, and even geography matters. So I had to standardise the equipment, he explains. And soon he and his team of OPOS chefs from all over the world, who discuss recipes virtually, decided on working with a two-litre pressure cooker to get to solve the problem in hand. This formidable team has proven that all kinds of Indian dishes  from Mysore pak to malai kofta can be cooked using the OPOS method.Bettering the processWhile choosing a pressure cooker leveled the playing field, there were some glitches reported by most chefs. We found that a lot of vegetables turned mushy and colourless when cooked in a pressure cooker using OPOS method. It lost all its taste and texture. And people were willing to use a cooker to cook dal, pongal or potato where the texture and consistency is not important, but refused to use it for vegetables, he shares. In their learning process, they discovered that to retain the colour, taste and texture of the vegetables, they need to cook it like a stir-fry that a Chinese master would make.We realised the key to doing that is to cut out all water and cook them on very high heat. This was the mantra that took us around 15 years to discover  high heat, low time, no water. You have to cook all the vegetables on very high heat for a very short time, in their own juices. When cooked so, the results were mindblowing, he narrates. Hence, they began the deskilling process and came up with the pressure baker, which is a pressure cooker that is redesigned to work on very high heat, without water. We designed this pressure baker and got Butterfly and Prestige to manufacture it according to our design specifications.If you try using a normal pressure cooker to cook vegetables without water, a lot of mishaps can happen. We gave a presentation to companies and explained to them the difference between pressure cooking and what we are trying to do. It is not easy convincing companies that have been manufacturing pressure cooker for 50 years to ask them to change their design. Fortunately, we were able to convince them. With the equipment and these recipes, instead of drawing a freehand circle, we have given everyone a compass. Now, a perfect circle is even possible for a child. That is what OPOS has done to all recipes, he says proudly. The pressure baker can handle any kind of recipe as this is just a cooking technique.The taste testWhen you cook anything beyond five minutes, everything is lost, he says. In every single traditional recipe, vegetables get completely massacred. Even in restaurants, what you eat is dead carcasses of vegetables. And the only way to eat that is by covering it with loads of masala, he explains. With the OPOS technique, you completely do away with the unwanted masalas. While the pressure baker is ideal to master the art of cooking using the OPOS technique, Ramki does have a solution to those who dont own one. For OPOS, standardisation is important.So, to cook the basic recipes that we have given in the book, use a two or three-litre pressure cooker because all the vegetables need to cook within five minutes. For a small family, a two-litre cooker is enough; for a slightly larger family, use a three-litre one. But, if you are cooking for more people, do not use a bigger cooker, instead cook twice or use two pots, he advises. In the two years since the last book was released, Ramki has been able to master the technique of caramelisation and invent a method called cold pressure frying, where you can deep fry without using a drop of oil.Deep frying or shallow frying is extremely injurious to health. Once the oil starts boiling it produces a lot of toxic chemicals. Even a simple thalipu you do at home creates a lot of smoke. This technique, done inside OPOS pressure cooker, eliminates oil smoke and oil breakdown. We didnt know this in 2018. The techniques keep evolving. Three years down the line we, will need a completely different set of recipes, he shares.Cooking talesRamkis house in Chennai does not have a kitchen. All he needs is a tabletop, a heat source and his pressure baker, and he is good to go. I cook in my balcony, my living room or even out of the boot of my car! There is no smoke or pollution; I take the kitchen wherever I want, he says. He has even taken it to high altitudes to cook for the Indian army in Akhnoor, on the India-Pakistan border in Jammu and Kashmir. It was mind-numbingly cold. The squadron of soldiers was surprised to see me with a backpack and one cooker. When I said I am going to cook a feast for them they didnt believe it. We managed to feed 40 soldiers in one hour.They were shocked as they often live on frozen food. We showed them how easy it is to cook fresh food and they just loved it. One of my most prized possessions is a citation from the army and a medal. It was a heart-touching experience, he reminisces. Now that he and his team have demystified and deskilled every single Indian cuisine, standardised the themes and recipes, the OPOS chefs are on a journey to take on global cuisines.We are working on a Singapore cookbook, Southeast Asian cookbook, Continental, Mediterranean, etc. People staying in those places are working on these recipes and coming up with a book. We also want to set up a chain of restaurants based on this concept  chef-less kitchen-less restaurants, he signs off.Now wouldnt that be something to watch out for?

Read MoreNEW DELHI: The price of onions has spiked in Delhi owing to supply being less than usual from various states, including Maharashtra . Many onion producing states have reported damage to crops due to unseasonal rain towards the end of 2020.Currently, the staple is retailing between Rs 40 and Rs 60 per kg across the capital, while the wholesale rate is between Rs 10 and Rs 40. The prices of other vegetables are normal, most of which are supplied from Haryana.Traders say there has been a 50% decline in the stock of onions arriving at Azadpur Mandi, from where the vegetable is supplied to retail markets across Delhi-NCR. Normally, 50-60 trucks of onions used to come every day, but the number has dropped to 30-35 now.However, the traders said the stir by farmers at Singhu , Ghazipur and Tikri borders had not affected supply because trucks were using the peripheral expressway and entering the city through Gurugram. Some drivers were also using village roads to arrive at Azadpur Mandi.Srikant Mishra, secretary of Onion Traders Association, Azadpur Mandi, said, The rain in December last year damaged onion seedlings in the nurseries. The farmers had to prepare the seedlings again, which caused a delay in production.By the end of February, supply of onions from Sikar district in Rajasthan and Ujjain, Bhopal, Narsinghgarh and Ratlam in Madhya Pradesh will start, which will lead to reduction in prices, added Mishra.Ram Avtar Singh, a retailer at Laxmi Nagar, said the price of onions was between Rs 25 and Rs 35 throughout January, but started to increase at the beginning of February. We are buying onions at Rs 30-40 from the wholesale market and selling at Rs 40-50, he added.Onion prices will remain high only for around 15 days and will start coming down by the last week of February. The supply from Maharashtra has been hit because the seedlings got damaged. Within the next 15 days, the wholesale and retail prices of onions will reduce, said Rajinder Sharma, an onion and potato trader.Another trader said the price would have risen further had the supply from Gujarat also been hit. The supply of onions from Gujarat is by and large normal, so that has helped cover up some shortage from Maharashtra, he added.",Delhi: Onion prices rise to Rs 60/kg,POTATO

While a kilogram of drumstick at Koyambedu Wholesale Market Complex (KWMC) costs Rs 120, curry leaves was sold at Rs 60 a kg. Traders attributed the unprecedented increase to a drop in arrivals to the market.V R Soundararajan, a former member of the market management committee of KWMC and a wholesale trader, said unseasonal rain damaged crops, resulting in short supply and price rise. Harvest and ,in turn, arrivals to Chennai, have reduced. I havent seen such high prices sustain in the wholesale market in the past. Wholesale cost of curry leaves has never exceeded Rs 30 per kilogram, he said.Curry leaves, which cost Rs 80/kg last week, will be sold for Rs 60 this week. The Rs 20 drop was due to a dip in sales, Soundararajan said. Koyambedu market sources curry leaves from Mettupalayam in Coimbatore district and parts of Andhra Pradesh.Cost of drumstick too has reduced by Rs 20 and will cost Rs 120 a kg this week. The market currently gets only 100 tonnes of drumstick a day, 50% of the daily average of 200 tonnes of drumstick supplied usually. The highest the vegetable cost all of last year was Rs 60/kg and at times, dropped to Rs 15/kg. Its cost is likely to stabilise in April, when fresh yield is expected to hit the market, he added.On the other hand, costs of other vegetables barring shallots continue to remain stable. Shallots cost Rs 80/kg this week, Rs 20 more than last week. While staples potato and tomato are expected to cost Rs 20-Rs 25, grade I onions will cost Rs 40/kg.","Curry leaves, drumstick cost still high in Chennai",POTATO

After listening to the Prime Ministers address in Parliament, the farmer is feeling insulted and has become more resolute in his stand against the farm laws, he said.A large number of farmers turned up for the panchayat yet again. The protests have emerged from the grassroots, but strangely Mr. Modi is keeping his eyes shut to their [farmers] demands, Mr. Chaudhary said.Whenever there is a challenge, people unite and give birth to a new leader, a new movement, he said.Mr. Chaudhary reminded how his grandfather Chaudhary Charan Singh had argued in his book  Indias Economic Policy: The Gandhian Blueprint, published in 1978  that those who were running the country didnt know the social and psychological make-up of the farmers. People with urban upbringing make laws for rural India. Even if they have the farmers interest in mind, they are not practical. This is proving to be true in 2021, he said.Benefit of capitalistsThe Prime Minister said in Parliament that one should not insult the capitalists. This in a country where there is still inequality, where a large section of the electorate is still poor. It shows the PM knows everything. The laws are made for the benefit of his capitalist friends, said the RLD leader.Raising the issue of a farmer from Aligarh who recently killed himself, Mr. Chaudhary said: They seek vote in the name of Ram, but they are not concerned about Ramjilal who ended his life after facing humiliation at the hands of officials for his inability to pay electricity bill.He recalled that the government had promised to develop 22,000 Gramin Hats (rural marketplaces). I could not find one in this region that is known for potato cultivation. The Shanta Kumar Committee had said in 2015 that only 6% of farmers could sell their produce at MSP. The goal should have been to increase procurement by increasing the number of government mandis, he said.Mr. Chaudhary feared that the government would sell the Food Corporation of India as well as it is running losses.

2021-02-17,https://indianexpress.com/article/india/sukhpal-singh-interview-contract-farming-7191898/,"Despite having three sets of contract farming laws being enacted in the past less than two decades, including the 2020 Act, the basic fear among the farmers is that their land will be snatched by companies with whom they enter into contract. Government, however, claims that farmers land is protected under provisions of the new Act.An expert on contract farming, Dr Sukhpal Singh, Professor, Centre for Management in Agriculture (CMA), Indian Institute of Management (IIM), Ahmedabad, having an experience around 3-decade on CF, shares his views on the farmers fear, why contract farming is needed but not a successful operation and how a small farmer can use it to enhance his income. Excerpts from his interview with The Indian Express.Why is contract farming needed?For contracting agencies, contract farming (CF) is the only alternative to buying from APMC mandi or private wholesale market, or buying directly from farmers without contract, as corporate farming (wherein corporate agencies undertake farming operations on owned or leased land for their consumptive use or for commercial purpose) option is not available in India. This is so because under the Ceiling on Land Holdings Act, non-agriculturists cant own agricultural land, and under the Land Leasing Act, cant even lease in agricultural land, both Acts being at the state level.So, if a company wants to procure desired quality raw material or farm produce in adequate quantity at reasonable cost which may not be available in the open market or sometimes not even grown by farmers e.g. processing variety (chips grade) potatoes in India before the Pepsi came in, then CF was the only option in India which Pepsi used.But, many times, corporate farming even if allowed, is not a viable option given that we are in the age of vertical coordination (buying from others) rather than vertical integration (making in-house). For farmers, CF can bring benefits of not only assured market and price but also new technology, seeds, extension, diversification and such other non-price benefits.Dr Sukhpal Singh, contract farming expert Dr Sukhpal Singh, contract farming expertWhen was contract farming started in India, Punjab?Contract Farming has been in practice in India since the 1960s in the seed sector wherein both public and private entities have been using this mechanism to get certified seed produced, and in other farm produce in many states like Punjab and Haryana since the 1990s with the PepsiCo undertaking tomato, chilly and potato contract farming. Pepsi was brought in for attempting crop diversification when contract farming was not even legal in India.When were the first rules governing CF framed?CF has been permitted in most states as per the model APMC Act 2003 of the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmer Welfare (MoAFW) wherein three new channels of farm produce buying and selling i.e. direct purchase, contract farming and private wholesale market were made legal, which most states adopted in a few years, with the exception of one or two states, and later, under the separate model Agricultural Produce and Livestock Contract Farming and Services (Promotion and Facilitation, APLCF&S (P&F)) Act, 2018. Punjab was the only state which, in 2013, framed a separate Act on contract farming instead of providing for it under the APMC Act which it had not amended adequately until 2017. However, a separate Contract Farming Act was never operationalised, and it was also not needed as all other states had provided for CF under the APMC Act itself.How has been the experience of CF so far?There is a widespread practice of contract farming across crops, states and agencies (public, private and multinational) in India covering dozens of crops and livestock products with hundreds of contract farming projects or schemes, for domestic processing or for export, and there have been dozens of studies over the last 20 years on its performance and experience.Default by both sides (companies and farmers) has been an issue and contract farmers in various parts of India have faced many problems like undue quality cut on produce or no procurement of produce, delayed deliveries at the factory, delayed payments, low price, poor quality inputs, no compensation for crop failure and even stagnation of contract prices over time, besides contract agreements being in favour of the contracting agencies. Also, the exclusion of small holders remains a key challenge as contracting agencies prefer larger farmers to reduce their transaction costs. Further, contract production of the same crop is generally higher cost than open market production as certain recommended practices have to be followed as far as input use and crop management is concerned which also leads to resource constrained small producers being excluded. The companies also put minimum land and other resources as the criteria for farmers being eligible to produce under contract.If contract farming has not been successful in areas, what have been the reasons?Poor regulation and lack of an enabling policy are the major reasons. There is no policy to support smallholder inclusion e.g. lower cost credit or encouragement to group contracts. Thailand had used CF as a mechanism to achieve agricultural development by including it in their 5-year plans and then bringing state support like extension and credit for making it spread across crops and farmers besides promoting group, not individual, contracts.Now that there have been three sets of Acts including two independent Acts on it (the central Act 2020, Model CF Act 2018 and APMC Act 2003), why are farmers still worried about their land being snatched by the sponsors. Is their fear genuine?It is land leasing under CF laws which worries farmers the most. The model APMC Act 2003 had protected farmer land clearly. Even if famer committed default, the contracting agency could not lay claims to farmer land or other assets. But, since the model ALPCF&S (P&F) Act, 2018, the land leasing has been made part of the contract farming definition which is not correct as contract farming can never include land leasing. This is one of the reasons for fear among farmers.The 2020 Act protects farmers land when it states in Section 14: No farming agreement shall be entered into for the purpose of (a) any transfer, including sale, lease or mortgage of the land or premises of the farmer. But, some other provisions are at a departure from this provision. For example, the dispute resolution section clause 14(7) states: The amount payable under any order passed by the Sub-Divisional Authority or the Appellant Authority, as the case may be, may be recovered as arrears of land revenue. However, then again, it states in the next clause (15), Notwithstanding anything contained in Section 14, no action for recovery of any amount in pursuance of an order passed under this section, shall be initiated against the agricultural land of the farmer.But, still it means it can be recovered from other assets and properties of the farmer.The biggest problem is that in the 2020 CF Act, contract farming has been mixed up with corporate farming. Land Leasing Acts at the state level are still intact though may not remain for long going by what Karnataka, Rajasthan and Punjab are planning in terms of opening up land lease markets. The way production agreement is defined also raises doubts whether land leasing is also a part of contract farming. The mix up between contract and corporate farming in the Act is so significant that the Rajasthan Amendment Bill, 2020 assumes that leasing is a part of contract farming.How can farmers land remain safe under CF?For safety of farmer land ownership under CF, it is important to exclude land leasing from the definition of contract and it should be written clearly in the Act that no recoveries other than from farm produce can be made from famers even if they default.How can a farm friendly CF model be achieved which can help small farmers in an effective manner to enhance their income?Better and more effective regulation is the first step to protect famer interest and to ensure that they benefit from contract farming engagement. Further, since Indian farmers are mostly marginal or small, they cant deal with large buyers on their own even if they are brought under contract farming by some companies. Therefore, group contracts should be encouraged by policy incentives to make the mechanism inclusive and effective for farmers. The government can facilitate such contracts through credit and extension support to such small farmer groups like in Thailand. Also, we have thousands of Farmer Producer Companies (FPCs) now which are very business-like entities of farmers and they can play a role in making contract farming deliver the objectives of farmer income enhancement by facilitating contract farming with smallholders, and also undertaking contract farming on their own. But, these entities have been treated as farmers in the Act despite the fact that no FPC undertakes production. They should have been defined as sponsors in the agreement as they do buy from their members and non-members and also undertake or facilitate contract farming. They should have been given better treatment in the new Acts.Finally, the 2020 CF Act has left the very basic aspects of CF like acreage, quantity and quality, timing and place of delivery besides price for the contracting parties to decide for inclusion into the CF agreement. But, these should have been mandatory aspects of the contract agreement like in the model CF under the model APMC Act of 2003.",Dr Sukhpal Singh: ‘Land leasing provisions under present laws worry farmers the most’,POTATO

Ashok Behera of Iswarpur village is worried that he would not be able to cover the input cost if the price remains unchanged.Abani Swain of Bahakandia village said he had availed a loan of Rs 1 lakh for growing potato on his four acre of land and has sustained a loss of around Rs 40,000.Absence of cold-storage and food processing units in the district have only made matters worse for the farmers, whose overall input cost including fertiliser and irrigation was much higher this year. Left with little option, several farmers of the district are resorting to distress sale of the tuber.The two primary reasons for this are lack of market linkage and unavailability of cold storages, said Sarafat Ali, a vegetable seller of Kendrapara town, adding he is procuring potato for Rs 5 per kg from the farmers and selling it for Rs 7 per kg.In a bid to make Odisha self-sufficient in potato cultivation, the State government had launched the State Potato Mission in 2015-16 for production, storage and distribution of the tuber.The scheme was implemented through the Directorate of Horticulture under Agriculture Department. Under the scheme, the department was supposed to extend incentive to farmers for undertaking large-scale cultivation of potatoes in clusters.This apart, the farmers were to be given incentive for production of seed potatoes and support for setting up of adequate number of cold storages.However in 2019, the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) in its report stated that the State government failed to utilise a single penny of the Rs 20 crore sanctioned in 2017-18 for promotion of Potato Mission.Due to the apathy of the State government towards the mission, a large number of farmers are in deep trouble, alleged farmers leader and president of Krusaka Sabha, Umesh Chandra Singh.Assistant director of Horticulture department, Kanda Jena said the district needs more cold storages to ensure the farmers do not resort to distress sale of the tuber.",Kendrapara potato farmers left in lurch,POTATO

2021-03-07,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/digging-in-for-the-summer/article34009812.ece,"In a bid to handle the heat, protesting farmers at Delhis borders are setting up trolley colonies and semi-permanent structures that have been fitted with desert coolers and air conditionersProtesting farmers at Delhis borders are relying on their innovative skills to tackle the impending summer, and encouraging empathetic collaboration to ensure a good harvest back home.The agitation against the three contentious farm laws began over 100 days ago. At the start, roads leading up to the protest sites were packed with tractors. But the numbers have dipped slightly as the machines are needed back in the villages for harvest season. The number of trollies, however, has increased and they are at the core of the changing landscape at the protest sites.Innovations range from RO purification-enabled submersible water devices, 500-litre water storage tanks filled with buttermilk, air-conditioned semi-permanent structures with their own sewerage system, trollies with desert coolers, and trenches to keep water from entering tents during the monsoon.Trolley colonies have sprung up around semi-permanent structures laden with wet jute bags that will cool the air through portable fans, and submersible pumps are being installed along NH 9 to help create bathrooms for women protesters.At the Singhu border protest site, trollies have been fitted with desert coolers and even air conditioners. A dental clinic near the main stage has started distributing medicines from inside a semi-permanent structure and is also fitted with an air conditioner.Fans are being brought to the Tikri and Ghazipur border protest sites to cool the tents. Multiple 500-litre water tanks are replenished several times a day with lassi or buttermilk at the Tikri border and, like in Ghazipur, more bathing areas have also been created there. Both sites have also received additional washing machines.Summer planSemi-permanent tents are being pitched not only to counter the heat but to also provide accommodation for farmers staying at the Singhu border without trollies. Ply-based and ready-made structures that can accommodate around 10-15 people have also been procured.Meanwhile, several patches of vacant land along NH 9 have been cleared of shrubbery and rocks to make way for trollies covered with tarpaulin and plastic sheets parked in a rectangular pattern  each seemingly constituting a separate room surrounded by porous green cloth  forming mini dwellings with elderly farmers resting on mattresses placed in the middle. The vacant plots are covered in trees that provide some relief from the sun.Rohtash Kumar from Bhiwani said semi-permanent structures such as sheds for tractors, and trollies laden with supplies, are coming up along the highway. The already-erected tents will see slight modifications as the mercury rises.Some of our tents have multiple arrangements, including a kitchen and sleeping area. Then, there are the larger tents, which are used to store vegetables and other edibles... We are covering the tin ceilings of sheds for our vehicles with jute bags, and will put cardboard ceilings on the smaller tents for the summer. The larger ones will be covered by jute sheets which will be kept wet around the clock and have fans to keep the edibles cool, he said.Luvpreet Singh from Fatehabad led the way to a large tractor colony that has been set up on a recently-cleared vacant plot. The encampment is preparing for the arrival of women protesters. The owner of the land is a farmer like us. Not only did he give us permission to use the plot but also allowed us to build semi-permanent structures, Mr. Singh said.Suresh Goswami from Jind in Punjab, who has been camping along the NH 9 since late November last year, said large fans that are used on farms will be placed next to the semi-permanent structures. They will be covered with wet jute sheets to keep them cool. Since it is proving slightly difficult to gather water on a daily basis, we have made arrangements to ensure our own water supply by installing submersible pumps. Around a dozen have been set up and we will instal a total of 50 by April. We will not leave till the laws are repealed, he said.Community harvestThe number of tractors is about the same as when the agitation started but sometimes tractors do need to go back to villages since the fields are being watered for the fourth time before the harvest, said Virender Singh from Hisar, whose tent is among the many occupying the divider on NH 9 near the Rohtak bypass.We have assigned duties for this. For example, one brother waters the fields and then comes here on the family tractor so the other can go back. If the family tractor is not available for some reason, a trolley  sometimes even two  take its place here, he added.Gurdeep Singh from Patiala said though the harvest season was still a month away, farmers were in the process of making adjustments and arrangements so they did not face issues once the harvest began.Village panchayats have played a significant role in helping households reach an understanding regarding the pooling and sharing of resources, he said, adding: Once the harvest begins, farmers will be sharing their resources with each other to ensure the process is completed smoothly. Each village has sent around 50 tractors and trolleys. There are hundreds that are still in the villages and that should suffice for the season.Manjeet Singh Shergill from Bahal village said their goal to get the controversial laws repealed necessitated willingness to be able to fight for a long duration. Usually, each household has at least two tractors and trolleys. In case a family faces some kind of a shortage due to the protest, other villagers are more than willing to share. Had there been a logistical issue, we would not have brought tractors here in the first place, Mr. Shergill said.Jatvinder Singh from Hoshiarpur said only half of the tractors and trollies in his village had come to the protest. In our village, we have around 200-250 tractors and trolleys. Out of that, only about 100 are here. We have also started putting up tents as there is uncertainty over how long this will continue, he said, adding: In case some of us are required to take back our trolleys for a few days, with the tents installed, there accommodation will be sorted.There is a sense of community sharing in the villages and there were enough resources back home for the upcoming harvest, Ramandeep Singh from Patiala said, adding: Recently, a farmer from our village found himself without a tractor which he required for harvesting potato. His neighbours arrived with seven tractors to compensate for the one tractor that is stationed at the Singhu border protest site.Sukhjeet Singh Sidhu from Ajrawar village said people were more than ready to help each other out given the ongoing agitation. Currently, it is harvest season for potato and sugarcane. Once those farmers are done, they will replace us at the borders. There are a large number of trolleys in our villages, it is unlikely that we will need to take back the trolleys stationed at the protest sites, he said.",Digging in for the summer,POTATO

Their condition is improving gradually, according to the police.Sources said the control valve of a pipeline carrying ammonia to the Vindeshwari cold-storage facility exploded, causing panic. Four labourers working in the unit at the time inhaled the ammonia. The deceased were identified as Sitapur residents Mishrilal (28) and Dharmendra (27), while Paramanda and Vinod were injured and moved to KGMU. About half-a-kilometre of the area around the facility was cordoned off as a precautionary measure as the fire department brought the gas leak under control.We have registered an FIR against the cold storage owner, identified as Santosh Pandey, and manager, who is yet unidentified, under sections 304 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder), 308 (attempt to commit culpable homicide) and 269 (negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) of the IPC. As per the information there was an explosion in the oxygen supply and caused a leak of ammonia gas, said Bakshi ka Talab Circle Officer (CO) Hirdesh Katheriya.Lucknow (Rural) SP Hirdesh Kumar said experts were trying to figure out why the explosion occurred. Action would be taken based on their report, he added.After coming to know about the incident, our main focus was on the treatment of the injured. Based on the statement of those injured, and findings by the experts we will come to know more about the incident. We will be taking further action based on that. As of now, we know that there was a leak of ammonia gas that is used in cold storages. The death was caused by the inhalation of the same. There were four labourers present on the premises at the time of the incident and they came in contact [with the gas], said the SP.Ammonia is used in agriculture as a high-nitrogen fertilizer. In cold-storage facilities, it is stored for industrial use in liquid form under high pressure and low temperature. It adversely affects human beings who come in contact with it. It can cause irritation in eyes, skin, nose and throat even in moderate amounts. Ammonia interacts immediately upon contact with available moisture in skin, eyes, oral cavity or respiratory tract to form the very caustic ammonium hydroxide that disrupts cell membrane lipids. It ultimately leads to cellular destruction. The gas is toxic and affects lungs, with a possibility of causing chemical pneumonitis  inflammation of the lung caused by aspirating or inhaling irritants.",Lucknow: Two workers killed in ammonia gas leak in cold-storage unit,POTATO

After my husband, John, fell ill, it is my earning that helped raise my three daughters and son. My husband was a fisherman and we had our own boat and nets. But all that was sold to meet his medical expenses, she says.In a chequered kaili lungi, long blouse and a thorthu thrown over her shoulder, Aleyamma is a picture of resilience. Her weatherbeaten face is wreathed in smiles as she pulls out a smaller aluminium container from the large one she keeps the fish in, turns it over and sits on it to talk about life.Hailing from a fishing community at Vettukadu, Aleyamma recalls her mother walking from the beachside village to the city, 10 kilometres away, every day. Many women in my generation followed in their footsteps. Rain or shine, we had to reach the city and back again. No buses would permit us to travel with our wicker baskets of fish. The day still starts early with Aleyamma making her way to the Vettukadu or Vizhinjam, near Kovalam, to buy the catch of the day. But now, she and two others take an autorickshaw to the city and then walk to the homes of their regular customers. Each of them has a route, and they sell the fish and clean it for the buyer.Earlier, we used to go to the Karamana river at Edapazhanji and have a bath after we were done for the day. Nowadays kind householders permit us to use the washroom on their premises and also store the fish in an icebox. In the evening, we sit by the roadside at Vazhuthacaud to sell the fish. That is when officer-goers stop by. Aleyamma is grateful that she was able to get her children educated and married. Her son and one son-in-law is in West Asia. One grandson studies engineering and another works for a company in Technopark. My children are better off than where we started from. I keep reminding them that they must save for a rainy day.Alankrita Narula, paratha seller, DelhiEvery morning, Alankrita Narula would slip out of her city-girl clothes and into a salwar kameez. She would be up at 6 am, cooking, so she could head out on to the street by 9.30 am to set up her thela (cart), calledBalaji Paranthe, in a market near her apartment building in Delhis Dwarka.After spending 13 years in advertising, Alankrita decided to quit to follow her passion. It is a clich, she says, that rolls off the tongue easier than what it takes on ground  where pushing the cart, standing next to the fire, and working in sun and rain until 5.30 pm is not easy.She began in January 2020, mostly feeding daily wagers, Uber drivers, electricians and plumbers. In the beginning I thought of just serving aaloo ke parathe with dahi and pickle. I priced it at 50. In a couple of days I realised that people want a meal, and that 50 is too much for someone who barely earns 200 a day, she says. She brought her prices down to 20, and introduced a vegetable.Her family was nervous about how she would manage on the road, but Alankrita says she has never faced a security problem. The only problem she has is from people who came by in big cars and who bargain.I do think I am privileged, so sometimes I wonder whether I should be out on the street. For someone else it may not be a choice, and it does make me feel a little guilty to eat into someone elses street food business.Elardini Gautami, vegetable vendor, HyderabadThirty-eight-year-old Elardini Gautami does not know to read or write. However, her determination to educate her daughters drives her to work hard. Her day begins at 6 am when she heads to a vegetable wholesale market with her husband on his two-wheeler. Once she is back, she arranges them in a push cart and off she goes. Elardini says, My husband is a painter. I used to work as a part-time domestic help. The earning wasnt sufficient. Especially after my daughter passed her Class X we realised it would be tough for us to send her to college.Elardini (in yellow saree) selling vegetables to a customer in herI dont want my daughters to end up as domestic help. Pushing the cart around is not easy but then I have to do it to run my home and earn enough to pay my daughters fees.Elardinis elder daughter is in college and the younger one is in Class VIII. Elardini is satisfied that her daughters do well. I send them to a private school and want them to be able to speak in English. She admits that her work is challenging. When my body doesnt allow me to push the cart, I find a convenient and safe spot and sell from there. I cannot drink much water because there are no toilets. It results in headaches and body pain. Making a living from the road is a battle, but I will take it up for my daughters.Raji Muthuraj, bhajji seller, KochiRaji Muthuraj arrives at her pushcart, parked in Vyttila, Kochi, in an autorickshaw. She and her husband Muthuraj have the supplies for the day with them. Loaded in the three-wheeler are a gas cylinder and stove, various containers filled with batter and sliced onions for vada, boiled eggs for bhajji, potato mix for bonda, raw banana and chilli for fritters, and water, oil and milk for tea, besides utensils. They arrive at 3 pm to get ready for rush hour that starts at 4 pm. By the time they get home it is 10 pm.An adjective Raji frequently uses is super  the vada is super, as is the tea and the crisp egg bhajji. Cheerful with a ready smile, Raji is popular among regulars, most of whom have been buying from her for the 10 years they have been at Vyttila. Ever since we started, 20 years ago, I have been constantly by my husbands side  day or night, rain or shine. There is no other way to do this work, she says.She is the heart of the business, which has helped them raise and educate their four children  three girls and a boy; besides getting two of those girls married. She looks after the familys finances deciding on the investments, usually chit funds, big purchases such as the television and payment of EMIs too.The last year has been very tough for us financially, like it has been for everybody else. The first 50 days of lockdown, business came to a standstill. We are behind on the payment of some of our chit fund investments, she says, adding, We bought land [near Vyttila] and built our house without a housing loan, with the money we earned, she says. The money also goes into travelling with family to places such as Tirupati, Madurai or Kaniyakumari.

The retail cost of veggies in the city is usually 20%-25% more than what they fetch in the Koyambedu Wholesale Market Complex (KWMC).The cost of few vegetables such as carrots and shallots, being sold for twice as much as their wholesale cost, are currently burning a hole in consumers pockets.According to market sources, the cost of tomatoes , potatoes and shallots are expected to drop by Rs 10 to Rs 20 a kilogram, while drumstick rates could plunge by Rs 50/kg as arrivals to the city is increasing.The cost of curry leaves has been in the Rs 50 to Rs 70 price range for a while and a bunch of coriander is available for Rs 1 to Rs 3.S S Muthukumar, president of Koyambedu Semi-Wholesale Vegetable Traders Association, said carrot and drumstick prices have plunged as it is the harvest season of the vegetables. ""Carrot is largely procured from The Nilgiris district and the city receives drumstick from Ariyalur, Cuddalore and Villupuram districts,"" he said. The prices of potato and tomato are expected to fall further, he added.

Not only is the erroneously called Taj Man Singh a fixture of the Capitals landscape, but it is also home to The Chambers, a private members club dating back to 1982. Many a landmark deal has been struck over its menu, and the destinies of millions decided over dessert.Crust on ToastAlways only accessible to members, in its new avatar post renovation, The Chambers now comprises a new restaurant (Rayasina), seven meeting rooms, The Chambers Lounge, a whiskey bar, and a cigar lounge, sprawling over two floors of the iconic hotel. The Chambers, for those able to access it, is present across seven marquee Taj hotels in six cities including Dubai, and will soon have cream-of-the-crop up in London and Bengaluru. Membership to one means access to the rest, with newly updated technocrats, scions of business houses, and a select other few in line to become members. And yes, it is transferable to your descendants.Not being a member, yet an invitee, I begin the meal with a splash of Stranger & Sons Gin and tonic water (the restaurant has a gin cart with a plethora of spirits, mixers and garnishes), which goes down as smoothly as do the starters: Treacle Cured Salmon and Crab on Toast. Needless to say, there is something to whet and satiate every appetite. Crab on Toast is my favourite; the carelessly placed medallion of chicken liver pate accompanying it reminding me of the benefits of success. Forget goodie bags, Id like more sweet yet salty salmon, elevated by pickled cucumber, red radish and mandarin segments.Continuing the acquaintance with Strangers, I gravitate towards the Nossoto, and a Double Baked Cheddar Cheese Souffl, both dishes having such a powerful flavour profile that I cant help circling back to these.The Nossoto is, yes, a risotto, but made with pine nuts and pecorino, its utter umami broken up by citric grapefruit segments. The souffl, the double baked cheese one, gives you a perspective on decadence, in that theres no such thing as too much: the souffl, drenched in truffle oil and accoutred with pickled mushrooms and charred leeks, hits every flavour note.Speaking of bittersweet symphonies, lets go to the mains: Grilled Sea Bass with Admiral Sauce; Curry Grilled Lamb Chop; and an Olive Dust Chicken designed to simultaneously beguile the senses. The last comes with a potato gratin shaped into a chicken breast and soaked in the fowls natural jus, attended by crisp-yet-tender pieces of chicken.Thats why I stumble into the lamb chops, accentuated by quenelles of green pea mash and more. Indignantly stripping the meat off the bones, I go out to sea. Thank you Admiral (sauce) for your service, and thank you chef (meet him later this week in this publication) for the flaky fish and the lavishly scattered shrimp that festoon it.For dessert, we dabble with the Raspberry and Yoghurt Semifreddo, the Tasting of Coffee, and Chocolate Cheese Center. The first is an orchestra of flavours and textures, a dessert sans saccharine sweetness; while secundo is every coffee aficionados dream dessert. Then theres the price de resistance: three types and textures of chocolate shaped into a solid bar, with parmesan custard running through its middle.

His wife Basmati Devi and children  Nandini (6), Muskan (3) and Sanjna (one)  are back too. While he is working as a labourer at a construction site, his wife has found work in potato fields.We came back to Jalandhar in December last year because there was no work in the village, said Vijendera, adding that if this time lockdown is imposed he would prefer to stay back.There was no clarity about anything that time as I was penniless, and my family in MP had sent me Rs 5,000 to purchase ration as no one had given us anything and everyone was very scared, he said, adding that he has come here again to ensure good education for his children.Opinion | Post-lockdown misery of Indias migrant workersNandu Mistri (40) is also back from Chak village of district Palamu in Jharkhand.Nandu had left for his village during lockdown along with wife Banita Devi (30) and then his 26-day old twin sons and a daughter in the first Shramik train from Jalandhar.

You work your guts out and then to have it all just washed away in the blink of an eye.""Costigan, 40, a road maintenance worker whose farm is in the Hollisdale community about a five-hour drive north of Sydney, said he's thankful that so far he's managed to avoid yet another disaster the plague of mice that is affecting some farms in the region.Maybe, he hopes, the floods will help wash them away.Australia has always been a land of harsh weather, where droughts and fires form part of the nation's psyche.But experts say that global warming is likely making recent weather events more extreme.The raging wildfires that burned through until early last year killed at least 33 people and destroyed more than 3,000 homes.""These events are expected,"" said Sarah Perkins-Kirkpatrick, a climate scientist at the University of New South Wales.""But climate change has put them on steroids.""She explained that, paradoxically, a warming atmosphere can worsen both droughts and floods.The extra heat can suck more moisture from the ground during droughts.But warmer air can also hold more moisture, she said, so that when it does rain, it pours.Some towns in New South Wales have set 50- or 100-year records for rainfall over the past week.The floods have killed two men in separate incidents, both of whom were trapped in their cars, and have forced more than 20,000 people from their homes.Dale Ward this week was trying to clean out the rental apartment she owns, and where her daughter and their family live, in the town of Windsor.She said she was mopping up sludge after about 1 foot (30 centimeters) of water coursed through, destroying a box of photos and other memorabilia.""It's like someone dropped three tons of dirt in your house, and then dropped a bucket of water over the top,"" she said.Ward estimates it will take at least a month to get the place habitable again, with plumbers and electricians needed to get everything fixed.Elsewhere, people are still dealing with the plague of mice.Last year in eastern Australia, months of rain doused wildfires and ended a drought that had crippled the region for more than two years.That led to bumper crops on many farms, and an explosion in the mouse population.Pompy Singh, the manager of the Spar supermarket in the town of Gulargambone, said they started to notice the number of mice increasing before Christmas.They used to set one or two traps a day, he said.They started buying much larger traps and setting many more of them until they had 20 set all the time.Suddenly they were catching 100 or 200 mice each day.The critters began eating through everything, getting into the lettuce, the potato chips, the dog food, even the tobacco.Singh said they started storing everything in refrigerators or sealed containers.Still, he said, the mice kept coming.Some days, they were catching up to 600.Even the fridges kept breaking down as the mice chewed through the wiring.Singh said the numbers of mice seem to have decreased somewhat since the floods hit, although they're still catching plenty.And Australia's troubles may not yet be over.Some experts have been warning people to check their shoes and clothes for deadly spiders, as swarms of them seek refuge from the floodwaters by moving into residential homes.Meanwhile, Costigan said he intends to rebuild.He's spent too much time putting up fences on his farm many of which survived the flooding and making other improvements to give up now.He adds that he moved his small herd of cattle to higher ground before the floods hit and they all survived.Costigan said he feels lucky his farmhouse is insured and is also thankful to family members and neighbours who have contributed to an online fund to help his family rebuild.He said these kind of troubles all come with living in Australia, and even perhaps explain why the British initially treated the continent as a place to send their prisoners.""They thought it was hell on earth,"" he said.""What they didn't realise is that it's a beautiful part of the world.""","Australia endures droughts, fires, floods and marauding mice",POTATO

Their ruins today remind us of the glorious heritage of India.My travels were aimed at experiencing first-hand the connectivity of Buddhist sites falling along this great heritage route running through northern India and the foothills of the Himalayas. The book gives an idea of Gandharas architectural wealth stored in the museums of Pakistan and Afghanistan.You have written extensively on the Silk Road. What draws you?I was fascinated by the story of the Silk Road. The myriad goods that were traded, of marvellous art that flourished, of faiths that travelled along the trade highways I was amazed to find that Indian goods, traders, artisans were in great demand as far as the Caspian and the Black Sea. The travels undertaken by Chinese and Korean pilgrims to India between the fourth and eighth century CE also inspired me greatly.Could you share some anecdotes while travelling and writing this book?In Kabul my friends suggested that if I wanted to work undisturbed, I should cover myself. And so, whether I was in Kabul, going to the National Museum, or visiting the Bagh-e-Babur at Charbagh, or sitting on a charpoy over an icy stream at Paghman Darrah I never ventured out without the cosy comfort of the burqa.At the remote village of Aibak near Samangan I circumambulated the great stupa of Top-e-Rustam, along the pradikshana path as a Muslim, clad in a burqa. I explored every nook of the forsaken monastery of Aibak, unnoticed. But not everything was smooth-sailing.At Kakrak valley, east of Bamiyan, I found a bunch of women tilling a potato field and making cow dung cakes. It prompted me take a couple of photos. No sooner had I clicked a few shots that a volley of stones was thrown at me and I had to quickly escape.The one city in your journey that has stayed with you.Bamiyan, because of its wondrous beauty, pleasant weather and architectural wealth. Even though the Buddha colossi are lost to the Taliban, there is much to see in the beehive of caves. Remnants of beautiful paintings and stucco figures can be traced.The people are warm and friendly, the food delicious and the antique bazaars, especially the Titanic, is where you can spend hours looking at ancient carpets, coins and birch bark manuscripts.What next?My next work is yet another travelogue. It is based on the Buddhist cities lying along the Asian highway through Bangladesh. It involves a journey from the northern regions of Rajshahi right up to Coxs Bazaar in Chittagong.In ShortWhat are you reading right now?Anton Chekhovs Grief from his collection The Stories.Had you not been an authorA teacher, for sure.One book you could not finish?Emily Brontes Wuthering Heights.

That explains, to an extent, why Mexican food appeals to me. It is, after all, a glorious mix of fluid and tonal flavours.It is also the cuisine that a talented young chef called Noah Barnes has been focusing on. Id had some delicious Mexican food at his restaurant Arriba some years ago, and still remember the taste of the habanero-smoked pork skewers, flavoured with honey and served with a hot chilli sauce.The chef now runs a new restaurant called Miss Margarita (Ph no 8920331591; M block market, GK 2), which specialises in Mexican food. Chef Barnes, who learnt the nuances of Mexican cooking from the former ambassador of Mexico in India, and a visiting master chef at the embassy, prepares various kinds of tortillas, quesadillas, tacos and more.Mexican food has a spicy edge that appeals to the Indian palate. Some of the flavours  such as cilantro  are used in both cuisines. We love our tomatoes and onions; so do they. A lot of what we eat  think corn on the cob or peanuts  came to our shores from distant Mexico.I love all their open and closed wraps. The tacos that he prepares, with different toppings are superb. His Street-styled grilled chicken and chilli bean taco (475) consisted of grilled chicken strips, a sweet paprika drizzle, refried beans, rocket, and smoked tomato salsa, topped with fresh tomato and onions.The dish I really loved was the diablo prawn (725). With a pressed tomato and coriander drizzle, it had a tamarind and habanero glaze and came with burnt garlic and lime. The prawns were first grilled and then tossed in the sauce. The tart flavours of the tamarind went well with the sharpness of the chillies. The prawn  soft inside and crunchy outside  had soaked in the flavours.The cheesy jalapeno chicken chipotle quesadilla (625) was just that  hot with a sharp taste of cheese, while the charred sweet potato and crispy cauliflower taco (395) was a spinach tortilla, also topped with a hot sauce. The problem with the latter was that I didnt really get the taste of cauliflower or the sweet potato, as it had been overwhelmed by the sauce.The pork carnitas tacos, however, were superb. Soft pork belly had been topped with a potato, pineapple and jalapeno salsa, smoked tomato salsa and refried beans (575). The chicken enchilada, the chef said, was a dish of chargrilled chicken, mixed with peppers and cheese, rolled in tortilla bread and topped with home-made fermented hot sauces, baked with cheese.Churros with chocolate and chilli chocolate sauce at Miss Margarita in Delhi | Photo Credit: Special arrangementChef Barnes takes pride in his Fresh Guacamole Bar, where guacamole is prepared at the table with avocado, tomatoes, jalapeno, onion, coriander and lime, and served with chips. There is a smoked chicken guacamole, too.There is a lot else on the menu: blackened Cajun fish taco (475), gondhoraj flavoured lime shrimp fajita (975) and a chicken casserole consisting of crispy, skinned chicken and spiced pilaf (775).I ended the meal with my favourite churros, eaten with chocolate and chilli chocolate sauce (425). It is a simple dish  fried dough dusted with sugar and cinnamon, but it is the sauce that gives it its singular taste. I dipped the churros in the chilli chocolate sauce and thought that was a blend worth a salsa.The writer is a seasoned food critic",Do a salsa and more at Miss Margarita in South Delhi,POTATO

They will not call you bohiragato. You will get to meet a lot of tilakwallahs and chotiwallahs there. They will chant Har har Mahadev. But they, along with others in Varanasi, will give you love. They may make you stay there, the PM said at the Sonarpur rally in what was evidently a response to the declaration by TMC leaders that Banerjee would, after defeating BJP in Bengal, take on Modi in his Lok Sabha constituency of Varanasi.BJP leaders, including Modi, have claimed that Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee is looking for a second seat as she is scared of losing from Nandigram. Trinamool leaders, including MP Mahua Moitra, have responded to that by saying  sarcastically  that Banerjee might contest from Varanasi in the 2024 Lok Sabha to take on Modi directly. Contesting from second seat?... Yes Mr Prime Minister, she will. And it will be Varanasi! So go get your armour on, a Trinamool tweet had said. Modi on Saturday latched onto the Trinamools response.Modi seized upon Trinamools taunt to make an attempt to cast Trinamool as parochial while seeking to depict BJP as an outfit which does not differentiate among people on the basis of states they belong to.The PM countered Trinamools  anti-outsider plank also by reiterating that the the leader of a BJP government in West Bengal would be a  son of soilBJP tacticians seem to reckon that Trinamools nativist pitch would not play well with  outsiders who constitute a chunk in many constituencies. However, PM said that public disparagement of outsiders militated against Bengals inclusivist grain. He cited Netaji Subhas Chandra Boses example to debunk the Trinamools outsider campaign. Born in Odisha and having his education in Bengal, Netaji used to say Bharat ek hai, our hopes and aspirations were the same. It pains me when the Trinamool and Mamata Didi talk about outsiders in India, the PM said.Modis speeches were marked by trademark aggression . He Bengal had made up its mind to vote the Trinamool out of office, and dubbed Trinamool a Taka Mar Company (TMC) at the Haripal rally and accusing it of taking cut money even for admission of patients to government hospitals. The middle class has slogged, the Trinamool has taken a cut from their income. It looted the poors rations following Amphan. It took away a major chunk of the 23 lakh tonnes of rice and 1 lakh tonne of pulses that the centre sent here during the lockdown. Apni nijer goondader samlan (Rein in your goons). Bengal has had enough of their torture. Bengal wants education, security for its women, the PM said, adding that the BJP government would use Digital India to transfer welfare benefits directly to people without any need for cut money.PM sounded confident of the BJP being able to form Bengals next government. Come May 2, someone from Bengal will be sworn in as Bengals CM. I will attend the swearing-in ceremony and ask the CM to expedite the process of transferring Rs 18,000 to each farmers account under the PM Kisan Samman Nidhi, he said.Modi took a jibe at the Bengal CMs complaints against security forces, electronic voting machines and the Election Commission. Didi, why are you angry? Is it because you did not get to do chhappa votes (rig the poll)? You were all praise for the EC, EVMs and security forces when you came to office 10 years ago, he added.  When an athlete starts complaining against the umpire than you can safely conclude that the game has been lost.There is a churning going on inside the Trinamool itself. Sensible people are saying Didi made a big mistake by shifting to Nandigram. A few reportedly advised her to contest from a second seat. But others prevailed upon Didi. I think this was sane advice because it would be difficult to run the Trinamool if Didi lost from two seats, he said.Modi, sensing Banerjees traction among women, said the Bengal government was sitting on files for establishment of fast-track courts for trial of crime against women when a thousand such such courts had already come up across the country. We have provisioned for setting up an anti-trafficking unit and a womens desk in each police station. The government here is not making full use of it, he said.PM also harped on the double-engine sarkar promise to emphasise how Bengal could be developed and connected if there was the same party in office both at the centre and in the state. Look at Singur today. The Trinamool drove away industry from the state. It lacks vision and political will. Potato growers in Hooghly are selling their produce cheap because the government has not set up adequate cold storages; and the existing storages are being run by Trinamool syndicates. Jute growers in Hooghly are facing a similar plight. We have set up an infrastructure fund to give a boost to the jute industry but things are not moving because the state government does not support jute mills, he said.",WB polls: PM Modi calls TMC ‘Taka Mar Company’,POTATO

Singur, which has great symbolic and political value in the States politics, is going to election in the fourth phase of polling on April 10. The Trinamool Congress government and Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee have described the return of land to farmers unwilling to have it acquired as one of the biggest achievements of her government.Addressing a public meeting at Haripal in Hooghly district, in the constituency bordering Singur, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday accused the Trinamool Congress (TMC) of using Singur for its political gains and then leaving its people in a lurch.People are aware more than me what kind of deceit was done at Singur Today, there is no industry at Singur, no jobs at Singur and the farmers are troubled by land sharks, Mr. Modi said, addressing a public rally at Haripal.Days before the PM raised the issue of Singur, Ms. Banerjee on March 31 held a public rally at Singur after the campaign for Nandigram drew to a close. The CM had also said that she had given thought to contesting from Singur because of its history of struggle, like in Nandigram, against land acquisition.At Singur, TMC Minister Becharam Manna is contesting against four-time MLA Rabindranath Bhattacharya, formerly of the TMC, who joined the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) days before his candidature from the saffron party was announced. Though the local BJP had objected to the 89-year-old-veteran, who is known as mastermoshai (teacher), Mr. Bhattacharya said it was a fight for his prestige. I was disowned by the party, he said, expressing strong reservation over the nomination of Becharam Manna as the TMC candidate from the seat. The mastermoshai remains a respected figure but many people are unable to reconcile his change of political affiliations. The BJP had a lead at Singur in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls but its the States ruling party that may be helped by the last-minute defection, feel political experts.I cannot understand how mastermoshai can contest from Singur as a BJP candidate. I respect his age. We had got him elected four times from here, the Trinamool Congress chairperson has said. Ms. Banerjee recounted her 26-day strike against forcible land acquisition at Singur, and also the police atrocities and excesses at the Block Development Office during the Left front regime.The Supreme Court in 2016 had turned down the land acquisition at Singur during the Left front regime, and in September same year, Ms. Banerjee returned the land to the farmers. The 997-acre plot at Singur that was at the heart of the debate over industry and agriculture has changed significantly since 2006 and many farmers have complained that they could not even identify their plots. After removing concrete from the land for three to four years, farmers like Vivekananda Das have managed a satisfactory yield of potato this season. But the farmers claim that they have to spend a large sum of money to make their land tillable again.It was the resistance at Singur that enabled Ms. Banerjee to make a remarkable political comeback and assume power in the State in 2011. Sensing unease among the people, the TMC government and Ms. Banerjee are promising to bring industry to Singur, which has been the BJPs poll plank. On Saturday, the party was quick to react to Mr. Modis barb by asking why the Tata Motors car factory at Sanand in Gujarat had been closed.The Left parties are also hoping to recapture lost ground by fielding 27-year-old Srijan Bhattacharya who, unlike the earlier Left candidates, is not riding a Nano car to campaign in the constituency but at times gives a hand to potato farmers working in the field. Like Nandigram, which witnessed a high pitched electoral contest, Singur, which has seen life come full circle from industry to agriculture and then back to industry, is once poised for a prestige battle.","West Bengal Assembly polls | After Nandigram, the electoral contest heats up Singur",POTATO

2021-04-07,https://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/chennai/2021/apr/07/swayed-by-sweet-potato-2286703.html,"Kannalmozhi Kabilan ByExpress News ServiceCHENNAI: The humble sweet potato, in all its weird and wobbly innocuousness, often gets a poor rep. Especially when pitted against, rather unfairly, the universally loved potato. While madhura kizhangu puzhukku and sweet potato fries have persuaded many to switch camps, it doesnt exactly top the list of favourite vegetables for too many.But, maybe it should, given that theres plenty more to this unassuming tuberous root, says Yamini, clinical dietician, Kauvery Hospital. Theres a misconception that roots and tubers are not to be consumed in large quantities because of their starch content. But, when it comes to the nutritional value, the other components like micro-nutrients also have to be kept in mind.For this, sweet potato can be consumed, explains Yamini. There are two types of the sweet potato. The one which is available in India is the orange-pinkish one; the other one is purple and not commonly available here. But, both of them have the same properties and are very good for your health. It is antiinflammatory, reduces free radicals and boosts your immune, she details.Addresses anaemiaIt is very rich in ascorbic acid, fulfilling the vitamin C part. Its also a good source of iron. If cooked with jaggery, the nutritional anaemia can be treated.Potassium powerSweet potato is a rich source of potassium. This can help manage high blood pressure, its water retention properties can regulate muscle contractions and prevent kidney stones too.Starchy but goodEven though it is a starchy vegetable with a minimal amount of carbohydrates, it minimises the absorption of sugar in the body; thanks to its good fibre content both soluble and insoluble. So, even diabeticpatients can consume it once or twice a week if their sugar level is under control.Metabolism mattersThe high fibre content also helps in maintaining gut health. It enhances the growth of beneficial bacteria in your stomach; this way, it can help treat infective diarrhoea, irritable bowel syndrome and other digestive disorders. It helps in weight gain but portion size is the key and it has to be taken appropriately.Brain foodIt is a very good source of choline an essential nutrient that enhances the brain function.Vitamin storehouseSweet potato is also very rich in beta carotene, which is the precursor for vitamin A. This vitaminis very essential in all stages of life, playing a vital role in eye health.Rich in antioxidantsIt is filled with anthocyanins with antioxidant properties. Hence, it has to be included in everyday diet.ConsumptionA 100 grams of baked sweet potato offers 51 grams of carbohydrates, 4 grams of protein, 6 to 7 grams of fibre and very minimal fat. Otherwise, it is also rich in vitamin C and B6, magnesium, etc. The best way to consume sweet potato is to steam/bake it and have it with jaggery or slight seasoning. It can also be made as a regular south Indian curry or poriyal, with tomato and onions and spices.Sweet potato is not given much importance on the plate. But, you should try to include it regularly in your diet. In layman terms, it just looks like the pancreas the shape of the tuber. And Mother Nature has given it all these properties too. That depicts that it is very good for your vital organ, pancreas, she concludes.",Swayed by sweet potato,POTATO

Usually, the market gets around 1,000 vehicles of agriculture produce. Now, it is expected to increase to 1,300- 1,400 vehicles.Farmers are desperate to sell their produce due to the current situation and hence they would bring produce in large quantity, officials from the market said. We can't predict the rates scenario as we can't rule out the possibility of panic buying on Monday, he added.The similar situation is expected to prevail in other wholesale markets across the district, said the officials.Vegetable markets in Kolhapur city are expected to be flooded with supply on Monday as the harvested vegetables have been piling up in the backyards of the farmers due to the weekend lockdown. The farmers will bring their produce to the citys mandis on Monday.Despite allowing vegetable and fruit vendors to operate, most markets and roadside vegetable vendors decided to observe the lockdown. The citizens, abiding by the law, too stayed indoors.As per the government orders, farming operations were allowed to continue. The farmers had expected the mandis to remain open.

However, most of the markets were shut. Moreover I was not allowed to sell my produce in the residential areas as police and locals said that there will be crowding if I set up shop on the society premises. I am heading to Shirol on Monday. Once the markets open on Monday, many farmers will flock to the mandis to sell their produce and the prices will crash.

They had got some soft, sesame seed topped buns, and ordered pork patties from Meatigo.I began dreaming about this: creamy mayo slathered over a piece of bun, onion rings, perhaps a slice of tomato over it. A juicy patty on that, a crisp lettuce leaf and another soft bun on top. The problem was that we didnt have any buns, and it was too late to have them delivered.But burgers had been promised to two young people at home  one visiting Delhi for the first time. So, I turned to my good friend, the internet, and chanced upon a place called Boss Burger. I liked the different kinds of burgers it offered, and was further encouraged by the fact that it has branches across the city. With the help of Swiggy, we placed our order.The youngsters like chicken, so for them we asked for two OG Chicken Burgers (518 for two). They are also fond of hot food, so we added a Crispy Peri Peri Chicken Burger (299). A Crispy Fish Fillet Burger (349) and what seemed rather interesting  a Mutton Ghee Roast Burger (369).The burgers arrived just when the mice in the stomach had started kicking up a real shindy. The boxes were encouraging  strong, well packed cartons, which contained the burger, as well as sauces and napkins. Without much ado, we got down to business.The young ones were happy with their burgers  brioche wrapped around melted cheese and chicken topped with a hot sauce. The hot peri peri chicken was even better. The chicken and cheese patty had been doused with garlic aioli and a spicy sauce. The fish fillet burger, which came with tartar sauce, was disappointing. The patty was crisp from the outside, but sadly soggy within.My mutton ghee roast burger, however, was delicious, with its fusion flavours. The patty had been prepared in the Mangalorean style  slow cooked and then garnished with curry leaf flavoured mayo. It had a taste of soft onions that I really liked, and, overall, the patty cooked with Indian spices went rather well with the soft, bland buns.My last happy burger meal was when I had ordered in from Akus, which has some outstanding burgers with blue cheese, wild mushrooms, jalapenos, caramelized onions and more.Boss Burgers menu is comprehensive, too. For vegetarians, it offers Aloo Rataloo (sweet potato patty with mozzarella cheese, garlic aioli and chutney), Spicy BBQ Paneer, Quinoa & Veggie (quinoa-crusted roasted root vegetable patty, topped with sriracha mayo and saunth chutney) and Holy Guacamole! Black Bean Burger.Meat lovers can have its Truffled 3 Cheese Tenderloin Burger (grilled tenderloin and cheese patty, topped with truffled aioli and pickles, served in a sesame brioche bun) and a Chicken Tikka Burger. There are fries, chicken nuggets, wings and various kinds of shakes on the menu.All in all, we had a nice meal, indeed. But now I need to order in some buns and patties.

I had no option other than paying the cut money. How could I build a house with concrete walls with my monthly earning of Rs 4,500, Ali says.BJP has been making relentless attacks on the Mamata Banerjee government on the issue of cut money.But the campaigns electoral impact seems to be missing in this minority-dominated region of north Bengal comprising two districts North Dinajpur and Malda where 21 Assembly constituencies are located. Whom will you vote for?Do we have an option? We have to vote for those who have given us half a house. If they (BJP) come to power, we will be driven out of the country, says the father of three, who migrated from Bangladesh 35 years ago.Extreme polarisationSensing adverse impacts of the Citizenship Amendment Act and lukewarm impact of TMCs alleged corruption on the regions minority vote bank which forms around 50 per cent of the total electorates, BJP is trying to hard sell the Hindutva rhetoric.This region is set to experience an extremely polarised election on the line of religion. BJP faced largescale agitations over its choice of candidates, which is also a factor that might fetch TMC electoral dividend.Asgar Ali, a graduate in philosophy, is more concerned about his future than BJPs Hindutva or TMCs minority appeasement.Practically, I dont see a reason to vote for either. Joblessness is an issue among the youth like me which the TMC government failed to address in 10 years. Many from our area secured jobs of teachers in primary schools after paying bribes ranging from `10 lakh to `15 lakh. On the other hand, BJP leaders never hesitate to issue statements which not only hurt us but also makes us feel insecure, he says.JP supporters during Union Home Minister Amit Shahs roadshow in Nadiadistrict on SundayThe 27-year-old, a face of Bengals educated and jobless young voters, finds no reason to support the LF-Congress alliance as it would mean wasting his valuable vote.My political allegiance might be towards TMC. At least, they would be opposing CAA, which poses as a threat to us, says the resident of Chakulia, another minority-dominated pocket in North Dinajpur.The electoral landscape in Bengals concentrated minority pockets was not as polarised during the 2016 elections.Though BJP is painting Mamata as anti-Hindu, Muslim voters had shown that she was not their preferred choice in the previous Assembly elections.In the districts of Murshidabad, Malda and North Dinajpur, which have a minority population of over 50 per cent, the CPI(M)-Congress alliance had won 31 seats out of 43. But in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, TMC secured lead in 23 Assembly constituencies.Debasish Biswas, professor of economics in Raiganj University and a political observer, described TMCs surge in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections as a fallout of BJPs aggressive Hindutva campaign.The minorities, who did not vote for TMC in the 2016 Assembly polls, extended their support to them in 2019. It is a direct impact of NRC and CAA, which Mamata Benerjee also described as a threat to the minority community, he observes.How lotus bloomedAsim Biswas, a farmer in his 40s, said most of the Hindus had migrated from Bangladesh and CAA is promising citizenship for them.When Muslims of this region united, Hindus, too, decided to come under the umbrella of BJP. Thats why BJP secured lead in this Assembly seat in the 2019 elections despite TMC winning the seat in 2016, says Biswas, who has shifted allegiance from CPI(M) to BJP, like many others across the state.They are a massive factor behind the saffron camps rise in Bengal. In Raiganj, the headquarters of North Dinajpur which is infamous for hooligaism, shootouts and gang rivalries, TMC is trying to dent Congresss vote bank after winning the civic body, which was ruled by the grand old party since 1950.The TMC also erected two statues of Priya Ranjan Dasmunsi, the late Congress stalwart from the region.A considerable number of Congress workers still carry Dasmunsis legacy. Congress has no chance of doing well in this region. Our attempt is to woo Congress supporters, said Kanhaiyalal Agarwal, TMCs candidate from Raiganj.","Haunted by Trinamool's cut money culture, Bengal minorities forced to choose a lesser evil",POTATO

Last Monday, we had received 24,700 quintals of the same. Today (Monday), it was 7,938 quintals more than last Monday. This is adequate to meet Pune and Pimpri Chinchwads requirements. We expect vegetable prices to remain stable in local mandis.Rates of all vegetables and fruits remained stable. Onion was sold in the Rs5 to Rs12 per kg range and potato was also sold in the range of Rs6 to Rs16 per kg. Rates of leafy vegetables were also in the normal bracket. A bunch of coriander was sold in the Rs5 to Rs12 range, fenugreek was in the Rs7 to Rs12 range and spinach was in the Rs4 to Rs10 bracket.Talking about the crowd management, Garad said, We have banned domestic purchase at the market, in view of the increasing crowd here. Also, small-time vendors, who sell the produce on handcarts and set up stalls in the market, too have been stopped. Restaurants on our campus have been told to provide parcel service.Shivlal Bhosale, a commission agent, said, It will be a difficult task for the administration to control the crowd at the market as thousands of them will be working together daily. A section of the commission agents said that the APMC could resort to last years strategy of running each section on alternate days. The measure had controlled the crowd significantly in the market, a commission agent said.While another agent said last years measure would go against the farmers as they wouldnt be able to sell their harvest quickly. Many farmers could not sell their produce last year because of this system, the agent said.Wholesale rates of flowers remain stableRates of flowers remained stable in Gultekdis flower markets on Monday, said Bala Sewale, head of the flower section. There was adequate supply of all flowers. Hence, there was no change in the rates.

Although he transitioned to a career in food and beverages from science, his new book, The Flavor Equation , goes behind the recipes to investigate the science of taste, combining his knowledge of chemistry with the mysteries of flavour pairings. The popular food columnist, blogger and recipe developer spoke toabout the Indian influences on his writing and also on mainstream American cuisine. Edited excerpts from the interview.They go hand-in-hand. Ive always felt cooking in the kitchen is just like being in a lab but with a tastier outcome. Recipe writing is just like writing experiments -- things work and sometimes they dont. Thats when you try to understand what is happening and how to fix it. A large part of recipe development is also problem-solving and creating solutions. This is where science comes in. For example, for the longest time, the paneer I made in America was too soft with a ricotta-like consistency -- a problem I never encountered in India. It turned out the calcium levels in cows milk is lower than that of buffalos milk used in India. To fix this, I simply needed to increase the amount of calcium and curdle the milk. Calcium chloride, an ingredient commonly used in cheese-making, does both these things. It gives the extra calcium and also the acid to help the milk proteins change their shape and turn into a firm block of paneer.Growing up in India, Ive been fortunate to experience and taste food from different regions as well as see and appreciate Indian ingredients and techniques for their versatility. In India, you can travel through various states and a staple ingredient like rice will morph as it moves from biryanis to fermented batters that make dosas and idlis. It gives me a sense of how ingenuity comes into play as recipes reflect adaptations to changes in geography and culture.While I dont think were exactly there yet, I do think we are on our way to seeing Indian food and ingredients in more homes than earlier. I think this is one of the most exciting times to be cooking Indian food in America because people are genuinely excited to learn about new flavours and ingredients. The works of chefs and writers like the late Floyd Cardoz, Asha Gomez, Tejal Rao, Priya Krishna, and several others are certainly helping cement the prominence of Indian cuisine in America.Cooking and for that matter even appreciating flavour, is something we learn through trial and error over time. It is experiential. Ive learnt to cook by watching my family and friends as well as through cookbooks, magazines, television shows and also working as a pastry cook in a patisserie. Flavour is a wide umbrella that not only encompasses the taste and aroma of the ingredients in our food but it also involves the interplay of our senses -- the shapes and colours of the food we eat, the different textures of food, and even the sounds food makes as we cook and eat. I remember being taught in India to pay attention to the sound of cumin and mustard seeds popping when preparing a tadka. We are constantly using all sorts of sensory cues in our cooking. And then theres the interplay of our emotions and memories that influences our perception of flavour. We love some flavours more than others, be it something we experienced in childhood or something tied into our cultures. The Flavour Equation is a book that gets into all these different facets from a nerdy-yet-fun lens with the recipes acting as enticing experiments.Living in two very different parts of the world gave me the opportunity to not only taste new food but also compare and contrast. You start to notice how people and culture define food. Often, similar beloved combinations exist throughout the world. They just get painted with different spices and are cooked in different ways -- for example, mashed potatoes and meat is a popular dish in the West but in Mumbai, potato chops provide that same degree of comforting flavours and textures where ground meat is encased in a shell of smooth, mashed potatoes before being shaped and pan-fried.My blog started out as a way for me to talk about the Indian food I didnt see in restaurants or in magazines and an opportunity to show the versatility of Indian ingredients and techniques in Western cooking. I dont see myself as an expert on Indian food since I certainly dont know all there is to Indian cuisine but I do my best to share the food I enjoy cooking at home with people. Its been a long journey but one that Ive thoroughly enjoyed. While there are plenty of common misconceptions on Indian cooking, I try to do my best through my work to show people that they can easily incorporate a lot of those flavours in their own cooking at home. Over time, Ive been fortunate to write for outlets such asandIt has certainly helped me share my food with a larger audience.There is an incomparable joy that I nd difficult to express in words when I eat ripe Indian mangoes. During ripening, the starch transforms and gives way to a soft pulp thats sweet and sour, carrying an aroma that reminds me of warm summer holidays in Goa. While mangoes are delicious as a sweet treat, they also make an excellent addition to savoury applications. The fruity, sweet avour of mangoes with lime gives this beet salad a refreshing taste. Try to use a good ripe mango without a chalky aftertaste. Its no surprise that I recommend Indian mangoes, but champagne mangoes are a good option. Youll find paneer in the cheese section at Indian grocery stores as well as most regular food markets.Paneer is not a salty cheese, so the marinade must contain a bit more salt for the cheese to absorb.The salad dressing provides a second layer of flavour as well as salt.While paneer is one of the easiest cheeses you can make at home, I prefer the store-bought variety in this application, where shape and structural integrity are important. It takes the pressure of an extremely heavyweight to bring together the protein molecules in the paneer and force them to coalesce, producing a firm, compact paneer that can hold its shape when cut and cooked. Commercial producers have equipment that generates sufficient pressure; its a little tricky to do this at home but Ive developed a method that you can use; otherwise, store-bought is perfectly fine.Whisk the ker, salt, cumin, turmeric, chilli powder, and black pepper in a small bowl. Taste and season with more salt if needed. Pour the marinade into a large resealable bag.Cut the paneer into approximately 1 by 2 by  in [2.5 cm by 5 cm by 12 mm] cubes and place them in the bag with the marinade, seal, and gently shake to coat evenly. Let the paneer marinate for one hour at room temperature. If you need to marinate it longer, leave it in the refrigerator.Preheat the oven to 400F [204C].While the paneer marinates, prepare the beets. Peel, trim the ends, and cut into quarters. Place the beets in a baking dish or roasting tray, drizzle with the olive oil, and season with salt. Roast for 30 to 45 minutes, until they are tender on the inside and a knife slides through the centre with ease. Remove from the oven and let them rest for 10 minutes.While the beets roast, prepare the dressing. Place the mango, ker, oil, lime juice, mustard, pepper, and chilli powder into a blender and pulse on slow speed until combined and smooth. Taste and season with salt.Grill the paneer just before youre ready to assemble the salad. Heat a cast-iron grill pan or a medium non-stick sauce pan over medium-high heat and brush the surface with a little olive oil. With a pair of kitchen tongs, carefully lift the paneer out of the bag and cook it in batches in the hot pan until it turns golden brown and is slightly seared,two to three minutes per side.To serve, toss the arugula in a large mixing bowl with the olive oil. Add the pepper and season with salt. Add the warm grilled paneer pieces. Drizzle with a few tablespoons of the salad dressing. Sprinkle with the amchur just before serving.Serve the remaining salad dressing on the side.",Science and spices go hand-in-hand for LA chef Nik Sharma,POTATO

(Source: Getty Images/Thinkstock)The Holy month of Ramadan has officially begun in India (from April 14) and will continue for 30 days  till May 13. During this period, devotees observe day-long fasts or roza that require them to avoid food and water. Hence, it is only natural to feel tired and hungry by the evening meal for Iftar.However, instead of straightaway opting for foods that might make you feel bloated, it is important to first replenish the lost liquids to prevent dehydration.The first meal after a long fast should be small and include foods that give instant electrolytes, fluid, and some sugar. This is why traditionally Iftar includes a lot of drinks, fruits, dates, etc. The best way to replace lost fluids and electrolytes is to break your fast with coconut water or salty lemon water with a small amount of quickly absorbed fruit sugar from two dates, prunes, dry figs or fresh fruit, mentioned nutritionist Rashi Chowdhury in an Instagram post.ALSO READ | Ramadan 2021: Date, sehri and iftar timings, prayer time table, significance, and fasting rulesWhat is a perfect Sehri or pre-dawn meal?According to lifestyle coach Luke Coutinho,Foods that quench thirst such as cucumber, zucchini, buttermilk, curd, melon, bananaComplex carbohydrates to keep one feeling full and energetic including oats, jowar, ragi, sugar-free muesli, whole wheatProteins for repair and growth including egg, pulses, sattu and nutsGood fats for satiety, vital functions, hormones and fat-soluble vitamins including cold-pressed oil of your choice, organic A2 ghee, avocadoWhat should you have when breaking the fast?What can help?Take a prayer break or a quick workout session before you have your bigger meal, said Chowdhury.For your main meal or dinner, your plate should have 30 per cent clean carbs, 30 per cent good proteins, and 30 per cent of high fibre vegetables. Carbs could be sweet potato or rice or millets like jowar, bajra, amaranth. Get your proteins from meat, chicken, fish or daal (please soak the lentils for 12 hours before cooking), mentioned Chowdhury.According to Coutinho, khichdi, a meal with a combination of dal and rice, pot meals, and well-cooked farm-fed chicken are dinner meals that are easy on the gut.However, the key lies in portion control.Its very important to watch your portion of fruits as you wouldnt want to overdo it if youre diabetic, have PCOS, insulin resistance or youre trying to lose weight, she mentioned.What to avoid?Avoid sugar, desserts and fruit juices that will raise your blood-sugar immediately. This is going to mess up with your insulin levels, especially when you fast the next day, leaving you with cravings and low energy levels, mentioned Chowdhury.For more lifestyle news, follow us: Twitter: lifestyle_ie | Facebook: IE Lifestyle | Instagram: ie_lifestyle",Ramadan 2021: Some essential fasting tips,POTATO

Working on the same lines, Pitaara Kitchen presents a fare exploring regional specialities instead of the common Indian dishes.Researched and curated by Chef Udit Maheshwari, the menu features delicacies from the length and breadth of India. And now that we have habituated to the idea of ordering in, we thought of beating the pandemic blues by treating our selves to their delicacies.Since a lot of such ventures are working on a sustainability model, the food is delivered in eco-friendly packaging. For the starters, we chose the Fake Wasabi Paneer Tikka. It was quite creamy unlike the spicy wasabi, because the paneer chunks were marinated in mock wasabi made using green pea, cheese and cashews, cooked in the tandoor. But this dish is a delight for cheese lovers.The Thatte Idli seemed a bit dry and hard, but Recheado Potato was the show stealer. The tangy tiny tikkis come slathered in a paste of tamarind, gur shakkar, and whole spices that just rejuvenate the taste buds. Green chutney came as an accompaniment with starters, which further enhanced the flavour. For our mains, we went with the Broccoli Makhani and Walnut Paneer.Walnut PaneerThe former had a buttery and fiery flavour, thanks to the broccoli marinated in cashews, cream, chillies and spices before being put into the spicy gravy, the latter is cheese chunks stuffed with cottage cheese, walnuts, spices and cheddar cheese, which gives it a sharp taste. Maheshwari says, The dish was developed by me.Rather, most of the dishes on our menu have been created by us to give people a truly unique experience. Pudina Paratha and Haak Saag Paratha are good accompaniments, but the latter could be too much for you if you are not a fan of the leafy greens. Tamarind Moilee came loaded with veggies like carrots, beans, broccoli and potatoes cooked in coconut milk with a hint of tamarind to balance out the sweetness.It didnt look very pleasant but the taste took away all my doubts about it. To end the meal on a sweet note, we tried the Salted Caramel Kheer. Made from Samak Chawal (Barnyard Millet), the kheer had the right amount of sugar, garnished with dry fruits and a hint of salted caramel.

Given that Vox Media has already done an in-depth video on the topic with the title Food waste is the worlds dumbest problem, which was largely US-centric, we decided its time to look at us. Think about it; you can order everything from Peruvian potato fries to desi Dal Makhani on your phone in a few taps and have it delivered to your doorstep, but within your proximity of a kilometre, there are probably people going to bed hungry and malnourished every night.It boggles the mind. It also befouls the earth. Food waste is a problem across the world, with global rates averaging around 40 per cent of food being produced being wasted. As opposed to most other metrics, India sort of achieves this one. As quoted by several sources, The Food Waste Index Report 2021, conducted by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and its partner organisation WRAP, states that around 931 million tonnes of food waste was generated in 2019, 61 per cent of which came from households, 26 per cent from food service and 13 per cent from retail.AMIT BANDREOut of that staggering amount, India contributed a stunning 68.8 tonnes a year, averaging out 50kg per household per year. According to FAO estimates in The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World, 2020 report, About 189.2 million people are undernourished in India. By this measure 14 per cent of the population is undernourished in India. Michelin-starred Chef Suvir Saran, of New York and New Delhi, believes there needs to be a three-pronged approach to tackle the issue. It needs to start with the chefs first. A few like Manu Chandra and Prateek Sadhu (of Masque) are responsible for engineering their menus according to the season, sustainability, and portion size.They think about tomorrow as opposed to profits today, which needs to be celebrated. The government and other authorities are the second tip of the spear, with Saran saying, Look at telecommunications. India is an industry leader in how fast we adapted to mobile technology and online, cashless payments. It would be amazing to see that same spirit of innovation in food management. The third prong is something well come back to. Chef Manu Chandra, who has been championing for using locally-sourced produce and helping in cutting down potential wastage for monkeys years, says, The idea of food waste goes way beyond cooking.You have all these catch-all rubbish terms like root-to-fruit, which all sound lovely, but are things we have been doing for years. Instead, Chandra follows that simple maxim of waste not, want not: We dont just carve out the hearts of vegetables and chuck the rest; instead we use everything, from discarded roots to leaves, to enrich our vegetable stocks, while I also try and keep items on the menu which can be cooked cooked to order as and when they come, we are not keeping items that could potentially go bad. Chandra is leading the way, but thats not to say others are not doing their bit. Sustainability is the key word for our brand.Our entire kitchen is made out of sustainable materials and we have tied up with a company called Vlu-o. Its a Chennai-based company that makes all our bags and stationery items out of recycled plastic. On festivals like Holi and Diwali, we curate hampers using sustainable products, aver Chef Vikramjit Roy and Anurodh Samal, co-founders of Hello Panda and Park Street Rolls & Biryani, adding, For instance on Holi, the hamper had gulaal that was made out of recycled flowers, a mask and a pouch that were made out of recycled plastic. An outsourced company converts our segregated waste into compost which further helps the environment.Park Street Rolls & Biryani outsourcesa company converts their segregatedwaste into compostWe also use only bio plastic packaging and all our uniforms are made out of recycled plastic that is converted into linen.

As to unsold products which are returned to LOpras Production Centre, the company uses some as input for new products, others which are still absolutely fine for consumption are offered to the staff at discounted prices or sent to temples, orphanages and occasionally to schools.In the cooler months of the year, cream-based products are distributed, however, during the warmer period of the year temperature- sensitive products, which may adulterate rapidly are discarded, says Kazem Samandari, Executive Chairman, LOpra, adding, Unsold breads are sent to animal shelters and being used to feed, mainly dogs. All products are delivered by the companys own vehicles to their destination. Then theres Aavika Chhawchharia, Co-Founder of Honey & Dough, who says, Over the past few years, we avoid over-buying stock. We also make sure to store our food properly at the right temperature so that it lasts long and does not go to waste.We always request our customers to not leave leftovers with us; rather take them home to reuse them later. Our employees are trained to make the food portions in the right amount and at the beginning of the day, plan the portions and amount of food to be made accordingly. We make sure to not bulk cook or bulk order any food to reduce wastage as much as we can. And that brings us back to you and me, the consumers (and potential wasters) of all that food that is being prepared, be it at home or in restaurants. We are an old culture, but a very young nation, and the dining scene here reflects that. Its in its teenage phase, meaning that diners are making the wrong decisions for the wrong reasons, be it wanting a dish to Instagram about or ordering larger portions than we can possibly consume.And then we waste it, points out Saran, noting how many countries seem to take their cue from the US, which, in food terms, translates into bigger is better. I dont like to do buffets, because theres so much potential for wastage. If there is an event, Id prefer to do pass-arounds, which tend to be consumed entirely, followed up by wholesome, but not multi-coursed, mains, says Chandra. Harking back to how bigger is not better, Saran concludes, Its a lot to do with portion control. Restaurants in India are seeing that if they offer big meals at small prices, they are bound to succeed.And so they load up their plates for people who are happy to consume with their eyes, and waste most of the dish without a thought. We need to learn what we are putting into our bodies. Its not about consuming 300 calories in a dish. Its about what those calories consist of: fats, carbs, whatever. And which of those we actually need. And that is the lesson we should take away: quality over quantity.As quoted by several sources, The Food Waste Index Report 2021, conducted by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and its partner organisation WRAP, states around 931 million tonnes of food waste was generated in 2019, 61 per cent of which came from households, 26 per cent from food service and 13 per cent from retail. Out of that staggering amount, India contributed a stunning 68.8 tonnes a year, averaging out 50 kg per household per year.",Wasted food is choking the earth,POTATO

Rajendran, president of TK Market wholesale vegetable traders Association.The wholesale prices of vegetables have fallen and some farmers and traders are unable to realise even the transport cost. For instance, the price of drumstick used to be 140 a kg. It is 8 to 10 a kg now, he says. The farmer should be get at least 12 a kg. Vegetable markets here get supplies from Karnataka and different parts of Tamil Nadu. The wholesale price of big onion on Thursday ranged between 10 and 15 a kg, that of small onion was 15 to 30 a kg, tomato 6 to 9 a kg, potato 16 a kg and cabbage 6 a kg. Except carrot, beans and cauliflower the other vegetables were selling at less than 20 a kg in the wholesale market.With high number of cases in Kerala, the wholesale traders here are unable to supply the usual volume to the neighbouring State. Most of the traders do not take delivery of the pre-Covid quantity. With the second wave of the pandemic in Coimbatore now, if the vegetable markets are shifted, the traders will be hit further, he says.Amirtharaj, a tomato farmer at Kinathukadavu, says that farmers spend 50,000 to 1 lakh on an acre to harvest tomatoes. This year, the rain was good, there was no problem of pest attack and the harvest was also good. When the farmers take the produce to the markets, the traders lift the vegetables. But, we do not get the prices. Almost throughout the last one year, we got just 100 to 300 for a box of 12 to 15 kg. Farmers are unable to meet the expenses with these prices, he says.Suresh, secretary of Anna market vegetable traders association, says that retail business has taken a hit at the market because of the pandemic, though vegetable prices are low. We will go back to operating just 50 % of the outlets on a rotation basis from Friday. Many people have taken to selling vegetables across the district and hence, sales at the market has dropped. Retail customers are also scared of visiting the market because of the pandemic, he says.",Covid spread takes a toll on vegetable trade,POTATO

During COVID-19, the body gets weakened and it continues for days even after recovering from the symptoms. Thus, it becomes essential to consume the right kind of diet for a speedy and complete recovery of the body. We spoke to celebrity nutritionist Sandhya Gugnani and she recommended some food and diet tips based on the latest research.Start with meeting 50% of the nutritional requirement of the patient and proceed to 70% by the 3rd day, gradually increasing to 100% by the end of the week.The above micronutrients increase the T-cells & B-cells(antibody) in your body and will help in COVID recovery.The main diet focus for COVID patients is to consume foods that would help rebuild muscle, immunity and energy levels. Whole grains like ragi, oats or amaranth are rich sources of complex carbohydrates. Chicken, fish, eggs, paneer, soya, nuts and seeds are some good sources of protein. Healthy fats like walnuts, almonds, olive oil, mustard oil are recommended during these days. To boost ones immunity, one should take turmeric milk once a day.Five serving of all coloured fruits and vegetables are a must to get adequate vitamins and minerals when you are COVID positive. You can have small amounts of dark chocolate with at least 70% cocoa which can lift your mood, get rid of anxiety and will also boost your immunity.Most COVID patients experience loss of smell and taste or difficulty in swallowing. It is important to eat soft foods at small intervals and to add amchoor in the food.If the patient is getting diarrhoea/ nausea give Veg Khichdi, ginger tea ( ginger, tulsi/ lemongrass, cinnamon, clove or cardamom)Consume energy-boosting foods like banana, apples, oranges or sweet lime juice to deal with post-COVID fatigue. Add sweet potato in the salad or as a part of your meal. Take warm water with organic honey and lime.Drink plenty of fluids, like warm water with tulsi leaves to manage COVID symptoms, like cough and itchy throat. Avoid sugary drinks, alcohol, coffee as it leads to dehydration. Inhale steam with the tongue out at least 2-3 times a day.Fruits and vegetables do not transmit the virus directly, but they should be thoroughly washed before cooking or consumption. They should be ideally washed in warm water or you can add soda-bicarb to the water.

Some experts fear that it could hit a million daily infections in May, with daily deaths nearing 5,000. It is a different matter that the story these numbers tell is itself only a tiny fragment of the misery enveloping the country. The health-care infrastructure is stretched to breaking point in most parts of the country. Given this situation, more restrictions cannot be avoided. At the end of a week-long lockdown, Delhi extended it by another week on Sunday. After months, Chennai came under a complete Sunday lockdown with increased restrictions during the week; Kerala had the whole weekend in shutdown. A national lockdown was a sledgehammer approach last year and its memories still haunt. The Centre, once bitten and twice shy, has conveniently left any decision on lockdowns to the States. The learning from the first lockdown should not be that it is a political hot potato that is to be passed around; but that it could serve as a smart instrument in combating the outbreak.It is meaningless to calculate the reduction in the spread of the virus attributable to lockdowns. In Delhi, the test positivity rate has reportedly come down from 36%-37% at the start of the lockdown to around 30% in a week, but that is besides the point. The challenge is in managing the pandemic with the least required and unavoidable disruption in economic activity. The lesson from the first lockdown that put the burden almost entirely on the poorest is that a better design for restrictions is essential. At the heart of managing any disaster is reliable information and trust in the government. Both seem to be deficient currently. The Centre appears to be eagerly watching and unhesitatingly intervening in some streams of information to deflect public attention from its own performance. However, there is little engagement with the States, the Opposition parties and the media. The Centre has viewed them with suspicion while the Opposition views the government as inept. All this is a replay of the responses last year, suggesting little learning. Lockdowns themselves cannot erase the pandemic, but they could give the government the breathing space to prepare. Ramping up of the health infrastructure must be taken up on a war footing. Going in for a shock and awe lockdown would cause more harm than good; but equally bad is the abdication of responsibility by the government. The Centre must work together with the States and the Opposition to design a flexible and phased scheme of restrictions that takes into account specific requirements and concerns of various places, and sectors of the economy.","Viral load: On lockdowns, lives and livelihoods",POTATO

Groups have been formed of people donating blood, or looking for donors. People are organising food for those who are in no position to cook. And some small entrepreneurs are supplying home-cooked food  at nominal costs  to those looking for nutritious meals that are tasty and prepared and delivered with all precautionary measures in place.I got a call from one such kitchen a few days ago. Called Bhojan, it has a subscription meal plan offering light meals and snacks, and a small combo meal package.The food from Bhojan (bhojan.co.in) was healthy, as it had been cooked with few masalas, but was delicious nevertheless. I learnt it was started in 2020, and has four kitchens, three in Delhi-NCR and one in Bengaluru. The minimum subscription plan is of seven days (plans for a fortnight and a month are also available (WhatsApp 9311419770). People can check the food out before opting for a subscription.The prices are affordable, something one can appreciate in these times when everyones pocket is hurting. The Chhota Bhojan breakfast or snack costs 45; combo meal of roti with sabzi or rice with gravy is priced at 49; a classic meal that includes rice, roti, vegetable, gravy and pickle is at 69; and a standard thhali has all this, but in somewhat larger quantities, and a salad, at 89.For breakfast, they serve masala puri with bhaji, idli sambar, pao bhaji, poha, plain paratha with zeera aloo, and vegetable coleslaw sandwich. On Sunday, there are various types of parathas with curd. Lunch consists of mixed vegetables, kadhai style aloo mattar, petha masala, baingan masala, lauki channa. There is something called gravy, which includes Amritsari chholey, rajma, and kadhi pakora.I enjoyed the food. The vegetable  muttar paneer  had been cooked with a light hand, but was good to eat. Likewise the chholey was deliciously light  in taste and colour. The aloo parathas were soft, filled with a light potato mash, and served with curd. The samosas were the way I like them  with a crisp crust that was not oily, and a scrumptious potato and pea filling.Another interesting place is Paanch Phoran, which has decided to keep its gourmet fare (from Exotisch Cuisines) on the backburner and focus on the kind of food that the body demands in times of crises. Sonali Chatterjee (WhatsApp 9910474449), who runs this service, does various kinds of soups and other dishes. On Thursday, for instance, she had prepared a clear chicken soup and clear vegetable soup.She offers a vegetarian meal of dal, sabzi, roti and rice (150); all this with chicken or fish (200) and a meal of chicken/ mushroom/ paneer/ tofu grilled, a soup or stew or broth, with bread/rice and sauted vegetables (250). She has a delivery charge of 100.There is also the House of Kitchens, which serves food across Delhi: East Delhi, GK2, Kalkaji, Panchsheel Park, West Delhi, Dwarka, Faridabad, Gurugram, Noida and Greater Noida. I rang the East Delhi number (9873939959). A representative answered the phone, and said that they had simple meals of rice, roti, sabzi, dal for 110, which they delivered to east Delhi neighbourhoods.For many people, this is not quite business  but almost a mission.

Moreover, this food service being free (pay as you wish, and open to donations) and catering only to a limited crowd has caused envy and admiration in other parts of Delhi-NCR.Radhika KhandelwalBut Khandelwal and business partner, Ravish Bhavnani, can only do so much. Last week, the duo went against the tide by discontinuing their delivery service, so that their 32-member staff can stay safe at home. For this service, they pooled in their own resources with some aid from family, friends and well-wishers, and are using their restaurants kitchen (to ensure highest levels of hygiene as the couple have three dogs at home) that was deep-sanitised before work on the food service began.Between the two, they handle purchase of ingredients, cooking, cleaning, packaging and even delivery in their Volkswagen Vento between 12:30-1:30pm every day. Hence, after announcing their service via their Instagram handles, they could yes to only 58 families close to the restaurant (they dont have an e-pass, but have formally stated their purpose in print stamped by the company letterhead, Radish Hospitality Pvt. Ltd).The main reason behind rolling out such an eclectic menu, for Khandelwal, stemmed from this innate need to help. I think people with Covid deserve a treat, and cooking is the only thing I know. Also, I advocate a lot of seasonal produce, and I am aware that for a Covid patient, it is important to have alternate grains, lesser fat, in their diet. So, the risotto is made from barley, red snapper and eggplant accompany the kodo millet, egg curry is with Kerala red rice, chicken/vegetarian noodles has Soba noodles.The meals appear elaborate but consist of very few elements, so these can be put together swiftly. Plus, with us professionals running the service, the health and safety standards are in place. So uniforms are put to wash the moment we are done, all packaging has double marking, double bagging...In the near future, Khandelwal wants to amplify the initiative and get more restaurants onboard. For now, I want to see how this model works, because these are dark times, and I dont know whether I have the bandwidth to lead a bigger initiative at this point.In a nutshellThe menu, subject to change every week, with one new dish every day, has immunity powerhouse offerings such as Pumpkin and Barley Risotto today, Tamarind Eggplant/Fish Curry with Kodo Rice tomorrow, Egg Curry with Kerala Rice on Friday, Sweet Potato and Spinach Burger on Saturday certainly cuts through the stereotype of bland, sick persons diet one is conditioned to assume.GK-II residents can message Khandelwal on WhatsApp (+ 91 8800665972)",A treat for the Covid positive,POTATO

Suddenly, I decided, I will make baklava, he says, walking through his first store, set beside Buva House on Khader Nawaz Khan Road.There was just one catch: he had no idea how to do it.Over the past one year, a combination of YouTube classes and determination, have resulted in Ottomans Turkish Baklava & Kunafa, which began as an Instagram start-up, then gathered enough steam, and confidence, to launch a store on Chennais most buzzy high street.Baklava is a 40-layered dessert made of phyllo pastry, filled with chopped nuts and sweetened with syrup, Sevki says, adding that it was developed in the kitchens of Topkapi Palace in stanbul.After a year of patient tweaking, he says his version tastes almost perfect. He adds, We source everything locally  but we need pistachios from Gaziantep for proper Turkish baklava. In the future, we will add that too.Pistachios, walnuts and cashew nuts are encased in translucent layers of crisp phyllo, that is generously brushed with ghee. Syrup is added judiciously, so the pastry stays crunchy, ensuring it is rich, yet deceptively light.The new space will open with baklava and kunafa, then expand into Turkish coffee.

But when there is an opportunity to go zero waste, why not, right?Helping residents in this endeavour is entrepreneur Jignesh Pujara, owner of Lyfe by Soul Garden Bistro. Plans were put in place last year after he studied responsible consumption and sustainability. But owing to the pandemic, his zero-waste store, Eko-Lyfe was launched in mid-April 2021.Claiming to be the citys largest zero-waste store, Eko-Lyfe is located opposite Lyfe by Soul Garden Bistro in Alwarpet. Giving a virtual tour of the 1,200 sq ft space, its in-house facilities and the extensive line-up of products, he says, Customers are encouraged to leave their footwear outside as a mark of respecting food. You find reusable containers and glass jars on the shopping trolley. You can either pick that up or bring your containers.The shop is divided into different segments based on where each product is stored. Soon after you enter, to your left youll find indigenous rice varieties such as kichili samba, sona masuri hand-pounded raw rice, kullakar boiled rice, mappillai samba boiled rice, thooyamalli raw and boiled rice kept in canisters. The segments are separated by a weighing machine to measure the product purchased. To ease the process, weve placed dals, hand-pound flours, nuts and millets next to rice. Weve invested in a machine in which fresh flour is ground and handed over to customers, explains Jignesh.Placed next to the shelves of grains are sweeteners like powdered jaggery, palm jaggery, palm crystals and palm sugar. To make your daily cooking easier, the shop offers in-house masala and spices. In-house idli and dosa batter, ground flour, and peanut butter are made to order. Their specially curated bread menu comprising whole wheat, multigrain, pav bun, ciabatta, focaccia, French baguette, sourdough loaf, etc is a delight for the expats, he says.

After shopping, patrons can relax at their in-house cafe Antari for quick eats.The cafe serves coffee and tea in edible biscuit cups. Other food and drinks like air-fried samosa, french fries, potato wedges, sandwiches and pastries are served in biodegradable bagasse plates and cups. Even the furniture in the cafe are made from waste paper pulp. However, due to the lockdown restrictions, they only offer takeaways.The store reflects Jigneshs vision. Theres a community fridge outside the store, where edible food (extra food from our bistro) can be picked up by the needy.

Scientifically called Eleusine coracana, it is an annually cultivated cereal crop, vastly found in the tropical regions of Africa and Asia, such as in Ethiopia, India and Sri Lanka.The drought-resistant nature of the crop makes it conducive to grow in various geographical terrains across India. Widely distributed across several states in India, its local names include ragi in Kannada, Hindi and Telugu, nachni in Marathi, madua in Bengali and kezhvaragu in Tamil. Ragi is the king of millets. Theres a reason why its consumed by farmers as porridge before they get on with labour-intensive work on the fields. Its also given to babies in South Indian households.Its so versatile in nature that you can prepare idli or dosa batter with it, use the flour to make rotis, koozh and kali for summer. It will cool the body. I was introduced to millets by my Ayurveda doctors for a health condition. With time, Ive witnessed drastic changes in my body and fitness level. Im a full-fledged milletarian now and I encourage people to incorporate millets in their everyday diet, says Indra Narayan, home chef. The annual grass grows up to a height of 1 to 2 metres.Narrow and green, the leaves measure between 30 and 70 cm. The straight, or sometimes curved, branches hold seeds arranged in florets, which can be brown, red or purple in colour. Upon developing, the seeds of the ragi plant are dried, cleaned and stored as grains. Over the years, the humble millet may have taken a backseat due to the increasing popularity of other cereals. But, its making a comeback with increasing awareness and dietary modifications, she says. The author of Millet Kitchen: The Simple Art of Millet Cooking throws light on this millets impressive nutritional profile.Holistic breakfast foodRagi comprises a vast array of key nutrients like vitamins C and E, B-complex vitamins, iron, calcium, antioxidants, proteins, fibers, sufficient calories and useful unsaturated fats. Having it for breakfast ensures faster assimilation of nutrients which is absorbed and transferred to the vital funct i oning of body organs.Gluten-free dietIt is low on calories. Good for diabetic patients and keeps blood sugar levels in check. Reduces cholesterol and lowers blood pressure.High on fibreIts good for digestion, keeps you satiated for a longer time and relieves you of constipation.

In many wealthy countries, and increasingly in lower income nations, a significant proportion of sodium in the diet comes from manufactured foods such as bread, cereal, processed meats and dairy products including cheese, the WHO said.Sodium chloride is the chemical name for salt and sodium is a mineral that regulates the amount of water in the body.Authorities must establish policies to reduce salt intake and provide people with information to make the right food choices, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said.We also need the food and beverage industry to cut sodium levels in processed food, Tedros said in a statement.The new WHO benchmarks, for 64 food and drink categories, are aimed at guiding health authorities in its 194 member states in talks with the food and beverage industry.For example, potato crisps should contain a maximum of 500 mgs of sodium per 100g serving, pies and pastries up to 120 mgs and processed meats up to 360mgs, according to its benchmarks.Excess dietary sodium intake increases blood pressure and consequently increases the risk of cardiovascular diseases, the WHO said.Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of deaths from non-communicable diseases worldwide, responsible for 32% of all deaths, the WHO said. High sodium intake is associated with obesity, chronic kidney disease and gastric cancer, it said. WHO recommends that people consume less than 5g of salt (or less than 2g of sodium) per day, it said.Its global target, set in 2013, is for a 30% reduction in the population average intake of salt by 2025, it said, adding: The world is not currently on track to meet this goal.For more lifestyle news, follow us: Twitter: lifestyle_ie | Facebook: IE Lifestyle | Instagram: ie_lifestyle",Don’t pass the salt – WHO issues benchmarks for sodium content in food,POTATO

2021-05-15,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/water-crisis-couldnt-be-worse-on-oregon-california-border/articleshow/82651401.cms,"The water crisis along the California-Oregon border went from dire to catastrophic this week. AP PhotoPORTLAND: The water crisis along the California-Oregon border went from dire to catastrophic this week as federal regulators shut off irrigation water to farmers from a critical reservoir and said they would not send extra water to dying salmon downstream or to a half-dozen wildlife refuges that harbor millions of migrating birds each year.In what is shaping up to be the worst water crisis in generations, the US Bureau of Reclamation said it will not release water this season into the main canal that feeds the bulk of the massive Klamath Reclamation Project, marking a first for the 114-year-old irrigation system. The agency announced last month that hundreds of irrigators would get dramatically less water than usual, but a worsening drought picture means water will be completely shut off instead.The entire region is in extreme or exceptional drought, according to federal monitoring reports, and Oregon 's Klamath County is experiencing its driest year in 127 years.""This year's drought conditions are bringing unprecedented hardship to the communities of the Klamath Basin,"" said Reclamation Deputy Commissioner Camille Calimlim Touton, calling the decision one of ""historic consequence."" ""Reclamation is dedicated to working with our water users, tribes and partners to get through this difficult year and developing long-term solutions for the basin.""The canal, a major component of the federally operated Klamath Reclamation Project, funnels Klamath River water from the Upper Klamath Lake just north of the Oregon-California border to more than 130,000 acres (52,600 hectares), where generations of ranchers and farmers have grown hay, alfalfa and potatoes and grazed cattle.Only one irrigation district within the 200,000-acre (80,940-hectare) project will receive any water from the Klamath River system this growing season, and it will have a severely limited supply, the Klamath Water Users Association said in a statement. Some other farmers rely on water from a different river, and they will also have a limited supply.""This just couldn't be worse,"" said Klamath Irrigation District president Ty Kliewer. ""The impacts to our family farms and these rural communities will be off the scale.""At the same time, the agency said it would not release any so-called ""flushing flows"" from the same dam on the Upper Klamath Lake to bolster water levels downstream in the lower Klamath River. The river is key to the survival of coho salmon, which are listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act. In better water years the pulses of water help keep the river cool and turbulent - conditions that help the fragile species. The fish are central to the diet and culture of the Yurok Tribe, California 's largest federally recognized tribe.The tribe said this week that low flows from drought and from previous mismanagement of the river by the federal agency was causing a die-off of juvenile salmon from a bacterial disease that flourishes when water levels are low. Yurok fish biologists who have been testing the baby salmon in the lower Klamath River are finding that 70% of the fish are already dead in the traps used to collect them and 97% are infected by the bacteria known as C. shasta.""Right now, the Klamath River is full of dead and dying fish on the Yurok Reservation,"" said Frankie Myers, vice chairman of the Yurok Tribe. ""This disease will kill most of the baby salmon in the Klamath, which will impact fish runs for many years to come. For salmon people, a juvenile fish kill is an absolute worst-case scenario.""Irrigators, meanwhile, reacted with disbelief as the news of a water shut-off in the canals spread. A newsletter published by the Klamath Water Users Association, which represents many of the region's farmers, blared the headline, ""Worst Day in the History of the Klamath Project."" Farmers reported already seeing dust storms that obscured vision for 100 yards (91 meters), and they worried about their wells running dry.About 30 protesters showed up Thursday at the head gates of the main dam to protest the shut-off and ask the irrigation district to defy federal orders and divert the water. The Herald and News reported that they were with a group called People's Rights, a far-right organization founded by anti-government activist Ammon Bundy.Oregon Gov. Kate Brown and California Gov. Gavin Newsom, both Democrats, have declared drought emergencies in the region, and the Bureau of Reclamation has set aside $15 million in immediate aid for irrigators. Another $10 million will be available for drought assistance from the US Department of Agriculture .Ben DuVal, president of the Klamath Water Users Association, urged his members to remain peaceful and not let the water crisis ""be hijacked for other causes.""The seasonal allocations are the region's most dramatic development since irrigation water was all but cut off to hundreds of farmers in 2001 amid another severe drought - the first time farmers' interests took a backseat to fish and tribes.The crisis made the rural farming region hundreds of miles from any major city a national political flashpoint and became a touchstone for Republicans who used the crisis to take aim at the Endangered Species Act, with one GOP lawmaker calling the irrigation shutoff a ""poster child"" for why changes were needed. A ""bucket brigade"" protest attracted 15,000 people who scooped water from the Klamath River and passed it, hand over hand, to a parched irrigation canal.The situation in the Klamath Basin was set in motion more than a century ago, when the U.S. government began draining a network of shallow lakes and marshlands, redirecting the natural flow of water and constructing hundreds of miles of canals and drainage channels to create farmland. Homesteads were offered by lottery to World War II veterans.The project turned the region into an agricultural powerhouse - some of its potato farmers supply In 'N Out burger - but permanently altered an intricate water system that spans hundreds of miles and from southern Oregon to Northern California.In 1988, two species of sucker fish were listed as endangered under federal law. Less than a decade later, coho salmon that spawn downstream from the reclamation project, in the lower Klamath River, were listed as threatened.The water necessary to sustain the coho salmon downstream comes from Upper Klamath Lake - the main holding tank for the farmers' irrigation system. At the same time, the sucker fish in the lake need at least 1 to 2 feet (30 to 60 centimeters) of water covering the gravel beds they use as spawning grounds.The drought also means farmers this summer will not flush irrigation water into a network of six national wildlife refuges that are collectively called the Klamath National Wildlife Refuge Complex. The refuges, nicknamed the Everglades of the West, support up to 80% of the birds that migrate on the Pacific Flyway. The refuges also support the largest concentrations of wintering Bald Eagles in the lower 48 states.",Water crisis 'couldn't be worse' on Oregon-California border,POTATO
2021-05-15,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/the-flavor-equation-by-nik-sharma-is-all-about-sugar-spice-and-a-pinch-of-science/article34564218.ece,"The food writer-photographer marries his training as a molecular biologist with his experience as a cookLos Angeles-based Nik Sharma effortlessly dons the hats of food writer, photographer and scientist. A captivating blend of Blumenthalian gastronomy and (Sanjeev) Kapooresque simplicity, Sharmas food creations are based on one philosophy  flavour comes first. With his new cookbook, The Flavor Equation, he has invested in trying to understand, and helping us understand, why our grandmothers or favourite aunts food tastes the way it does. What are those simple elements and ingredients that help to produce tasty food every single time? Excerpts from an interview:Where does your understanding of flavour come from?Flavour is something we all experience through our own lens but what makes it individualistically unique is the way our cultures and emotions tinged with our memories come into play. It affects how we perceive aromas, tastes, textures, sights, and sounds when we try a dish. Growing up in Mumbai, and then later moving to America, made these concepts much more obvious because it was an opportunity to compare and contrast the differences and similarities across these two different parts of the world.Tell us about the creative process behind The Flavor Equation. Where did you start from?The Flavor Equation is part science text, part cookbook. When I started to work on the book, I sifted through science books, recipes, research papers, and even my old school notes that I still keep stacked away. The recipes in the book serve as illustrative examples, similar to a lab experiment, that highlight and explain the science behind our actions in cooking. Of course, the end results are much tastier since this is food!What has been your personal connection with food? At what point in your life did cooking become a source of comfort or a personal project of sorts?While I cooked for many years, cooking as a storytelling medium became much more prominent when I entered academia. I worked as a researcher during the day and went to school in the evening. Cooking became a refuge, a place where I could simply relax and have fun but also express myself.It led to the start of my blog, A Brown Table, and that became a platform to develop my writing and photography and also to share recipes and talk about the food Im interested in cooking and eating. Much of my writing is influenced by the work of food writers like Diana Henry, Nigella Lawson, Niloufer Ichaporia King, Julie Sahni, Nigel Slater, and others. There are Indian recipes, a lot of Goan food, but also recipes that are an amalgamation of my experiences living and growing up in two different parts of the world.Over time, the blog started to receive attention and I realised that cooking and writing about it made me happy. I woke up excited every morning looking forward to spending time in the kitchen. Eventually, I left my job in pharmaceutical research to work as a pastry cook in the San Francisco Bay Area. After that, I worked as a food photographer for a start-up and soon got a chance to write a food column for the San Francisco Chronicle. Writing for the newspaper led to newer opportunities and also made people sit up and take notice of my work.Acidity, sweetness, heat... Is there one flavour profile you turn to often in your cooking?Im definitely a sweet and sour type of person. When I cook, that combination tends to make most tastes shine beautifully. For instance, any type of chaat with the jaggery/ dates/ tamarind sauce, or like a tart lemon ice cream. In summer, when my husband and I grill a lot of food, I often add amchur and jaggery to barbecue rubs. Its a game changer.What do you make of the impact the pandemic has had on our food and eating practices?The pandemic and the ensuing lockdowns revealed how much I took for granted: from the simple acts of shopping for produce at the farmers market or grocery stores to eating out at restaurants and travelling. With those avenues unavailable, I turned to books and documentaries more than ever before to learn more about food, culture, places, and people.Also, attitudes towards cooking at home have changed and I think its one of the few positives to come out of the global pandemic. I often get emails from parents, about their young children who have started to cook from my books and use the recipes as a way to learn about science, cultures, and people.Another wonderful thing to have happened is the reduction in food wastage. In fact, some of the recipes in The Flavor Equation  the debittering of olive oil and the oven-baked fries  rely on the science gleaned from food waste research. In the case of the debittering of olive oil, I found I could apply the method of extraction to remove certain substances from olive tree waste to debittering the oil  the chemicals were exactly the same. For the fries, I came across a research paper that was trying to increase the yield of pectin from potato waste and I realised the same technique could be used to make a potato fry crisp on the outside and creamy on the inside simultaneously.Your food is a happy amalgamation of East and West. How mindful are you of what you bring to the table as a person of colour?While I dont ascribe to the notion that food always brings people together, it does possess the powerful ability to do so. I cook with my soul and share the food I love, and I hope people will not just enjoy the food but also the stories behind these recipes. Food is a tool I use to tell my story and share the experiences that shape me.Your first book, Season (2018), told the story of your journey from India to the U.S. What was the motivation behind The Flavor Equation?The Flavor Equation marries my training and experience as a molecular biologist and a cook. While my first book, Season, was much more personal and told people who I am, The Flavor Equation tells you how I think, how I work with flavour in my cooking. I want people to cook food that tastes great but also know why things work or why they dont. There are a myriad opinions on food and this book in a way tells you why  its culture, geography, but also science.Snapshots from The Flavor Equation by Nik Sharma.Your food photos are stark, and youve spoken earlier about showing your brown hands in your images. When did this simple act become political? How important is it for you to put yourself out there?My style of photography represents the way I see food and want it to be seen. It is my point of view. I want people to see themselves cooking the food I cook, so they feel comfortable attempting my recipes. Thats the reason I began to photograph myself cooking.I had also noticed how a lot of American media outlets always depicted only light-skinned people in their photos  be it a food gathering, in a cookbook or a magazine, or even on products. None of them seemed to represent dark-skinned people, either by omission or maybe they just didnt care enough. For my blog, I didnt need anybodys permission to shoot food the way I wanted to. At the time, photo curating sites were all the rage and often the images that showed my hands would evoke negative reactions because food and hands was forbidden. I knew Id lose traffic to my blog but it also didnt feel right to adhere to something I didnt believe in. I stuck to my style and people noticed. Things are different now than they were six years ago but I often wonder, why did it even have to come to this?julie.m.v@thehindu.co.in","‘The Flavor Equation’ by Nik Sharma is all about sugar, spice and a pinch of science",POTATO

Ask her how she juggles between the two starkly different roles and she credits her commitment and passion, along with the fact that she likes to keep trying out new things.I want to challenge myself, and I feel we subconsciously go towards what inspires us at that moment I am in a state of discovery right now; I am finding new aspects in myself in terms of creativity, she says.In an exclusive email interaction with indianexpress.com, Rhea, who is sister to Bollywood fashionista Sonam Kapoor, talks about her working mantra, pandemic learnings, and her latest collaboration with Johnnie Walker Gold Reserve for its latest campaign #PourofGold in association with ace designers Abu Jani and Sandeep Khosla.Excerpts:You are a producer and stylist, two absolutely different roles. How do you strike a balance?I think my circumstances help me strike a balance. I take each day as it comes, and complete the task at hand. Life does it for you. If you are committed and passionate about what you do, then you will only have that much space at that time for a particular thing. Not saying that you ignore the other thing but sometimes it takes a back seat. When I am making my films, I am first working on them and then I end up styling, too. So, in that way celebrity styling does take a little bit of a back seat. But it is also like I am growing and evolving and my interests are changing. I want to challenge myself and I feel like we subconsciously go towards what inspires us at that moment.View this post on Instagram A post shared by Rhea Kapoor (@rheakapoor)Which do you enjoy more and why?I, right now, think am into my movies and creating products and entrepreneurship. I am in a state of discovery right now; I am finding new aspects in myself in terms of creativity. I have been styling for 12-13 years, and now I just feel like it has to evolve into something else  which it is  and I am really enjoying it.ALSO READ | I got to play the most important role of my career during pandemic: Sonu SoodIf you had to curate a style checklist for the modern Indian bride, what would it include?I would make sure it included everything she needs to be comfortable. Comfortable shoes or a change of shoes that dont hurt  something like an ankle slip-on, and hooey socks that can keep her comfortable. I would make sure that she has weather-appropriate clothing, a little handbag (or whatever is comfortable for her) for holding the phone. I would say that a stylists checklist should have things you need to have a good time.View this post on Instagram A post shared by Rhea Kapoor (@rheakapoor)Your sister Sonam is known for her impeccable fashion choices. But a lot of ideation goes behind creating the final look, and you are often a part of it. How is it styling her, and could you share the BTS process?The behind-the-scenes for creating a look always starts with a story. But sometimes the outfit inspires us, sometimes Sonams mood, sometimes a piece of jewellery, and sometimes the location. Then we go on from there. If the look is reminiscent of Japanese streetwear, then you take inspiration from Kabuki or Harajuku Girls. You use the little nuances to have fun with makeup, hair but make sure that it doesnt look too costumey. So, historical figures, photographs, anything can give you inspiration and you just work backward and modernise elements, make them individual and then put it all together.ALSO READ | The concept of love has been changing dynamically: Imtiaz AliYour association with designer duo Abu Jani-Sandeep Khosla goes way back and you have often donned their creations. What is special about the latest collaboration?Sonam and my association with Abu Jain-Sandeep Khosla goes way back. My mother, aunt knew them, and its a name that I have always heard to be synonymous with utmost luxury, originality, knowledge, ethnic wear, and Indian fashion. My collaboration with them is special because they know how to make you feel special not only in their clothes but also when they host you at their home. Its just so fitting because they are all about glamour but also comfort, and this idea of glamour, luxury, bling, and celebration feels like home and embraces you. I feel thats what makes it special  its not just glamour and excitement, but it is also family.View this post on Instagram A post shared by Rhea Kapoor (@rheakapoor)What is the most challenging thing about being a stylist?It is to make sure that you are not letting the trends run your work. You are instead using them to your advantage to keep things exciting and fun. But its essential to remember that thats not all you are about, and that you have your own style. You just have to make sure that your own and your clients style are coming across. That is difficult when there is a trend every five minutes that everyone feels like they need to embrace.ALSO READ | In styling, there is a fine line between loud and dramatic: Sushmita SenIt is not only films and fashion  #rheamade dishes look equally impressive. Is cooking something you indulged in more during the lockdown?I have made a lot of burgers during the lockdown. I think a burger is the ultimate comfort food. It is just amazing and it makes you feel complete. Nothing like taking a big bite of a good burger, and also lots of fries. I have made fresh potato chips with thyme, lemon zest and pepper, and I have made spicy fresh potato chips, sweet potato fries and even cinnamon and Cajun sweet potato fry. Yeah, lots of fried potatoes (chuckles).View this post on Instagram A post shared by Rhea Kapoor (@rheakapoor)What has been your biggest lockdown experience?Having so much time with my family. Sonam and Anand came and were locked up in the house for so long and it was actually really nice. I miss them. The biggest thing is that I have not seen my sister in almost a year. We have been inseparable since we were babies. So thats the biggest thing that I have faced. Also, all our birthdays during lockdown have been pretty special because they have all been different.ALSO READ | Designer Shehla Khan: Sonam Kapoor was my first-ever museWhile you and Sonam regularly share snippets from your life on social media, if you had to share one thing about you both that not many people know, what would it be?I am actually a super-private person. Also, I am media-shy and only share certain snippets of my life on social media, and keep my personal life to myself. It is just recently that I have started sharing my relationship, which I have had for 12 years. I think people have different ideas of how Sonam and I actually are. Or at least of me. I know how they misconstrue how Sonam is but I am pretty laid back and not very fussy. I am just very pragmatic. There is a very dreamy quality to me, but I am also straightforward and chilled out. I feel people think that we just wear gowns and go into fancy places, but I am happiest in my sweatpants chilling on the couch with my friends without wearing any make-up. Sometimes I even forget to even brush my hair (chuckles). But yeah, that is who I am.View this post on Instagram A post shared by Rhea Kapoor (@rheakapoor)One celebrity you really wish to work with (in the film) and also as a stylist?I really want to work with Alia Bhatt; as an actor, I think she is special.

What was happening? Had someone been injured on the streets of Gaza City, or worse?It was 1.55 p.m. on Saturday. I had been napping on the upper floor of the two-floor penthouse that served as The Associated Press offices in Gaza City since 2006. This was not unusual in recent days; since fighting began earlier this month, I had been sleeping in our news bureau until early afternoon, then working through the night.I hurried downstairs and saw my colleagues donning helmets and protective vests. They were shouting: Evacuation! Evacuation!The Israeli military, I would learn later, had targeted our building for destruction and offered up a brief advance warning: They had taken out three buildings so far this week, warning residents and occupants sometimes minutes beforehand to get out. Hurriedly, I was told: You have 10 minutes.What did I need? I grabbed my laptop and a few other pieces of electronics. What else?

Had someone been injured on the streets of Gaza City, or worse?It was 1:55 p.m. on Saturday. I had been napping on the upper floor of the two-floor penthouse that served as The Associated Press offices in Gaza City since 2006. This was not unusual in recent days; since fighting began earlier this month, I had been sleeping in our news bureau until early afternoon, then working through the night.I hurried downstairs and saw my colleagues donning helmets and protective vests. They were shouting: Evacuation! Evacuation!The Israeli military, I would learn later, had targeted our building for destruction and offered up a brief advance warning: They had taken out three buildings so far this week, warning residents and occupants sometimes minutes beforehand to get out. Hurriedly, I was told: You have 10 minutes.What did I need? I grabbed my laptop and a few other pieces of electronics. What else?

This is all thanks to the Padma Shri Popatrao Pawar, who has been the Up-Sarpanch of the village since 1990.Impressed by Pawars model of slaying the virus, the Collector and Special Executive Officer () of Ahmednagar district called him to guide around 1,300 village heads on how to become covid-free in their respective villages.Talking about how he went about controlling the spread of the virus,says, In March, one of the villagers had covid symptoms. He was immediately quarantined in a nearby training school, as were all the people who came in contact with him. While we waited for the RT-PCR results, we administered Rapid Antigen Tests for quick results.This is not the first time Pawar has demonstrated his vision for the benefit of the village. He has been widely recognised for his work on water harvesting, water conservation and transforming a drought-prone area into a lush green village.We had 52 covid cases at one time between March and April. After they tested positive, we immediately started treating them with a doctors help. Four of them required ventilators so they were shifted to a hospital. Unfortunately, we lost one of our men. However today we are covid free, says Pawar, proudly.The villagers strictly follow covid appropriate behaviour. Besides following social distancing, every house uses the sanitiser supplied by the, uses masks and four teams keep a tab on the markets to see that covid guidelines are followed.Our main crops are onion, potato and seasonal vegetables. However, villagers are not allowed to grow sugarcane, grapes or even pomegranate as they require huge amounts of water and the village has been focusing on conserving its groundwater level, said Pawar.Due to onion production, several labourers from Marathwada and Konkan keep on coming to our village for work. We have asked them to stay on the farms in sheds and the villagers have been asked to maintain distance while working with them in the fields, said Pawar.Every week teams of gram panchayat staff and volunteers check the villagers oxygen saturation and temperature. Those from Hiware Bazar who go to other villages are advised to sanitise upon return and isolate themselves from their families.This has worked for us because our villagers have cooperated with us. Till now we have vaccinated around 200 senior citizens in our small village that has a population of 1,600, said Prasanna Pawar, son of Popatrao Pawar.Since Pawar took over as the sarpanch in 1990 after completing his post-graduation, Hiware Bazar has built several dams, percolation tanks and bunds. The villagers have always supported my efforts since 1990, said Pawar who has been elected continuously since then.The villagers have not only planted trees but built dams, focused on family planning, laying underground drainage pipeline, clean water, street-lights and banned open defecation. Weve had reverse migration from Mumbai andas peoples incomes went up with more and more land getting access to water, said Pawar who has been unopposed as the leader of the village and even conferred with a Padma Shri for his efforts.Appreciating Hiware Bazars efforts, Rajendra Kshirsagar, chief executive officer,, Ahmednagar, said, They made sure that all the guidelines given by government and health officials were duly followed to become a successful model with zero cases. In rural areas, a lot of people use handkerchieves instead of masks.But here, the village leaders made sure everybody uses masks, follows social distancing and most importantly, ensured that they isolated the person and his contacts while waiting for the test reports to stop further spread of the virus, said Kshirsagar.",How Hiware Bazaar became Covid free,POTATO

But now, Indias tea market is witnessing an increasing number and variety of immunity booster teas.Teas and herbs have always been widely used for several centuries owing to their natural immunity-building properties, but it is only after the pandemic struck that people started giving renewed importance to these, says Nutritionist Diksha Sharma, adding that not just people but tea brands too have realised that adding superfoods to normal tea helps make it a healthy beverage which can help fight infection.The past couple of years have seen a massive shift to Immunity- Boosting Teas, more so in the post-Covid world. There have been tailwinds especially for high quality, natural, organic wellness teas, says Bala Sarda, Founder & CEO, Vahdam India.The brand has launched a range of immunity boosting, certified organic green teas and turmeric teas and lattes that blended the goodness of high-quality teas with pure and natural super foods such as turmeric, ashwagandha , moringa, giloy, etc., that have immense health benefits.Tea has been an integral part of our culture, and a favourite amongst millions of Indians, says Karan Shah, Director, Society Tea, adding,Lately, due to the increased emphasis on the consumption of healthy and immunity boosting beverages, the brand launched Cleanse: Green Tea Detox Kahwa Premix.It contains turmeric, ginger, asafoetida, cardamom, black pepper, clove, cinnamon, green tea extract, and other ingredients, all of which are antioxidants with anti-inflammatory properties.There is a change in the mind set which is causing a change on the product choices being made, and I am convinced it is going to outlast the pandemic and break long time purchase habits, adds Sarda.Another brand Teabox has created two new chai blends inspired by the age-old traditions of Ayurveda  Rajasik and Rasayana, which make these teas nutritional blends.Rajasik has the much needed pick-me-up quality to help with a lazy morning.

2021-05-22,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/dr-mark-hyman-book-the-pegan-diet/article34597422.ece,"Dr Mark Hyman, functional medicine practitioner, on his book The Pegan Diet, food practices and food habits to adopt, and what elements to pick from paleo and veganIn his new book The Pegan Diet: 21 Practical Principles for Reclaiming Your Health In A Nutritionally Confusing World, American physician Dr Mark Hyman, who practises functional medicine, talks about getting our food from a farmacy not a pharmacy. In effect, he says food is medicine.He goes onto the specifics  telling us to eat organic, avoid gluten, eat the rainbow, a lot of which we already know  he also gives new advice, such as not combining saturated fats with starch and sugar.In a line, what his book is about appears in the introduction: Shifting people from an obesogenic, disease-causing, nutrient depleting diet to one rich in whole foods and protective foods that promote weight loss, health, and well-being.Food is often rooted in culture, tradition, and celebration, but this diet that combines the best of paleo and vegan practices, shifts the focus from pleasure to rejuvenation and regeneration. Perhaps what we need in COVID-19 times. An interview with the author.We often use food as a distraction, to fulfil an emotion, or give in to cravings because of the addictive nature of packaged food. How do we bring the body and mind more in sync with each other in order to adapt to the diet you recommend?Many of us spend years in the cycle of eating processed foods, especially in moments of distress. It can take time to break out of this cycle, but once you use biology (not willpower) to break free from the grips of ultra processed food, your body will actually crave real whole foods.Now I walk straight past the pastry aisles without a moment of pause. Those foods dont look like real food to me. I dont even crave them. I dont need the fillers, additives, excessive amounts of sugars, fats, salts and other measures taken to taint the natural goodness of real food. This can take time. You have to be gentle and patient with yourself.Start by incorporating an abundance of real, whole foods. Incorporate more veggies, more fruits, healthy fats, and clean protein. Crowd out the bad stuff. One of the easiest ways to do this is start your morning with a nutritious breakfast with some protein like eggs, protein shakes, or nut butters. Starting your day off with a nutrient dense meal will help to balance your blood sugar and allow you to make better decisions throughout the rest of the day.The Pegan Diet | Photo Credit: Special arrangementYou call several foods superfoods. How do you distinguish between a food and a superfood?Any food that is nutrient dense is a superfood. This includes vegetables, fruits, healthy fats, organic and grass-fed protein. Any food that provides you with healing information is a superfood.What if I cant eat organic and have no access to meat thats not pumped with antibiotics?Buying organic fruits and vegetables is important for your health, but it can get costly. It turns out that we dont always have to buy organic. Some foods are more likely to contain pesticides than others. EWG (Environmental Working Group, ewg.org) puts out a Dirty Dozen and Clean Fifteen list every year. Follow it to know which veggies and fruits should be organic and which are okay as conventionally grown. If you dont have access to meat thats not pumped with antibiotics, do your best. Eat a variety of protein sources from either animal protein or plant protein like low starch beans, tempeh, tofu, and nuts and seeds.How important is the whole process of shopping, cutting, cleaning and cooking, before we actually eat?Preparation is everything! Before you go to the grocery, I highly recommend planning your meals. Money and time are wasted while wandering around aimlessly at the grocery store. Take 30 minutes before you shop to think about what you need for the week. Plan out breakfast, lunch, and dinner, at least for a few days at a time. Once you know what you need, youll spend less money, and you wont pick up foods that might go to waste.Food is often reflective of culture, so how do we tell a predominantly wheat-eating community to stop eating wheat?Education is the key. Our modern diet is riddled with sugar and starch that is fuelling our chronic disease epidemic. Insulin resistance (from eating too much bread, rice, pasta, cereal, etc) is the biggest cause of rapid aging and leads to things like diabetes, heart disease, and more. My friend and Harvard researcher, Dr David Ludwig, recently gave a talk in India (which has a high percentage of vegetarians) in which he discussed why type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and heart disease are on the rise in South Asia. Ancient and traditional diets, while focussed on vegetarian foods, did not contain the amount of starch and bad fats that many vegetarians consume in these modern times. Replacing starch with vegetables, good fats, and protein is essential for stopping heart disease which is the number one killer in India.Mark Hyman, author of The Pegan Diet | Photo Credit: Special arrangementYouve said in your book, Be your own guinea pig  try, test, and try again. What do you eat on a daily and weekly basis?I eat the pegan diet, which is a fun way of saying that I take the best of a vegan diet and the best of a paleo diet and combine them into a way of eating that is inclusive and works for everyone. I fill 75% of my plate with non-starchy vegetables like broccoli, arugula, peppers, bok choy, and Brussels sprouts. I add about a palm size of protein from organic poultry or grass-fed meat. Sometimes I opt for vegetarian protein like tempeh or low-starch beans. I add in some healthy fats like avocado, nuts and seeds, or olive oil. Finally, I add 1/2 cup of starchy vegetables or gluten-free grains like sweet potato or wild rice. Thats pretty much what I eat for most meals. In the morning, Ill usually have an omelette or a green smoothie.How has your own perspective on food changed over the last 40 years  we understand you tried being vegan for a decade?One hundred years ago we didnt need a label to tell us that our food was local, organic, and grass-fed; all food was whole, real, unadulterated, traditional food. Fake foods weve been introduced to in the 20th Century  many of which contain high-fructose corn syrup and other added sugars  have hijacked our brains, hormones, and our metabolism. These Franken foods have literally created a vicious cycle of hunger and cravings. Its really quite sad how much our food system has changed and the damaging effects it has had on our communities, planet, and individual health. We have the power to take back our health and vote with our dollar when we choose real, whole foods. Ive followed many diets in the past  vegan, keto, etc but now I follow the pegan diet, which focusses on real whole foods.",Now I follow the Pegan Diet: Dr Mark Hyman,POTATO

We believe he fell in love with its culture and found remnants of his beloved Lucknow in Metiabruz or Matiaburj where he chose to settle,"" said Shahenshah Mirza, 54, a civil servant and a history buff.The nawab, over the years, built some 18 palaces and the landmark Sibtainabad Imambara in Calcutta, but his descendants live scattered as the British demolished the palazzos on one pretext or the other.Mirza and his father, 86-year-old Sahebzada Wasif Mirza - the president of the Awadh Royal Family Association -- now live in a modest though stately old house at Talbagan Lane, off Dargah Road, in the heart of the eastern metropolis.""Just 500 of his followers came with him in 1856, but as news spread that he was building a Lucknow-like city within a city, at Metiabruz in Calcutta, many of his nobles, artisans and musicians followed and flourished here,"" said Mirza.Though much of the original mini-city which Wajid Ali built was taken over for Garden Reach shipyards, Metiabruz still exists and is now famous as a garment tailoring hub -- reportedly accounting for Rs 15,000 crore worth of textile trade a year -- mainly on account of the skilled tailors who came here as part of the Nawab's entourage.Wajid Ali, who used the pen name ""Akhtarpiya"" for his poetry, prose and thumris, was a known patron of arts, and with the destruction of Mughal cities in the aftermath of the 1857 revolt, Kolkata subsequently became the new cultural capital, attracting talent from all over north India.As time progressed, Bengal's zamindars and rich 'bhadraloks' (gentlemen) enthusiastically developed a taste for the Nawab's leisure activities 'mujra' (music and dance soirees), kite-flying and pigeon games (kabootar baazi). ""Even today some 3,000 people are engaged in the business of making kites in this city,"" explained Mirza.The nawab introduced the citys elite to Thumri, Dhrupad and Kathak. ""Singers and dancers of the calibre of Bindadin Maharaj, Piyari Sahab, Gauhar Jaan, Malka Jaan, Jauhar Jaan came to settle here...Kolkata opened up to Kathak and thumris,"" said well-known Shantiniketan-based musicologist Rantideb Maitra.This, in later years, influenced the film industry and the dance and music forms became part of the pan-Indian culture.The song 'Babul Mora' itself was popularised by Kolkata-based music director Rai Chand Boral when he got Kundan Lal Saigal to sing it for the movie 'Street Singer' in 1938, nearly 80 years after it was written.""Kathak, though it started as a temple dance, had taken a stylised form under the Mughal patronage. When brought to Kolkata by Wajid Ali, who himself often danced as Krishna, it blossomed into a popular classical dance form,"" said Shyam Banerjee, another musicologist and Urdu translator.However, if the average Kolkatan remembers the Awadh ruler with fondness, it is because of the gastronomic legacy he left behind.Said Manzilat Fatima, another of Wajid Ali's descendants from his junior begum, Hazrat Mahal -- who led mutineers in Lucknow and eventually escaped to Nepal -- ""He (Wajid Ali) tried to recreate Lucknow but with a difference...(among other things) his kitchen became an experimental centre for new dishes.""Fatima (53), who runs the up-market restaurant Manzilat's explained that experiments led to the inclusion of potato -- then a rich man's exotic vegetable favoured by Europeans -- and eggs to Awadh's Biryani. ""New spices, coconut milk, mustard oil, all went into the making of Awadhi dishes and the result was the unique dum-pukht Kokata Biryani, now so popular all over,"" she said.The Nawab also set up a printing press in Metiabruz and came out with a weekly gazette in Urdu, adding to the literary and journalistic tradition of the city, which boasts of being the cradle to some of India's oldest newspapers.""We feel he was more popular in the city he chose to make his own than in Lucknow...When the legendary filmmaker, Satyajit Ray, asked my father how he saw Wajid Ali's legacy, he had explained that it lives on, as is evident from the fact that 'you chose to make your first Hindi movie - Shatranj ke Khilari - on a novel based on the the Awadh ruler's life',"" added Mirza.","'Piya ka des': 165 years on, Nawab Wajid Ali Shah's legacy lives on in Kolkata",POTATO

While most vegetables were being sold at double, or even triple the price in most shops, many outlets ran out of supplies by noon.In the retail market, per kg, potato was being sold at Rs 40-50, as against the usual price of Rs 20-30, beans at Rs 150-190 (usually Rs 70), ladies finger at Rs 50-60 (usually Rs 20), and onion at Rs 60 (usually Rs 30). Similarly, the prices of almost all vegetables were hiked. At the big, air conditioned vegetable shops in the city, prices were almost four times higher than usual. For example, beans were sold at Rs 290 per kg, carrot at Rs 190, brinjal at Rs 100 and potato at Rs 80.As it is, we dont have enough money to stock up vegetables for a week. With such prices, we can only buy supplies for two days. We hope the government will step in and help us, said P Hassar, a daily wage labourer from Velachery. Meanwhile, the lack of physical distancing was evident in almost all markets on Sunday. Ironically, the lockdown is being imposed to control the spread of Covid, but on Sunday, markets withnessed heavy crowding with people pushing each other and removing their masks from time to time.Queue outside a shop at Valluvar Kottam High RoadGST Road, Mount Road and other arterial roads in Chennai were clogged with vehicles as shops were open throughout the day. The scene resembled a carnival, with clothing stores, among others, also being opened. People from moffusil and rural areas of the city also indulged in panic buying. Mullaimagal, a resident of Chittamur village in Chengalpattu, told The New Indian Express she does not trust that the government will supply fruits and vegetables. In case no officer comes to our village, what will I feed my children? I bought groceries for 10 days already, she said.The roads were also dotted with makeshift shanties that were set-up on Sunday. People flocked these street markets with their children. We did not know if vegetables would reach us from Koyambedu, if we set up our shops in different places. So many vendors decided to gather and set up shops in groups. We have already lost our income, so we had to make the best of Sunday, said a vendor near Pallavaram.In areas such as Chromepet, Hasthinapuram and Chittlapakkam, people formed long queues outside supermarkets as early as 6 am. Street hawkers too made brisk business, causing dense crowds on narrow streets.Corporation to deploy mobile carts for fruits, veggiesThe city corporation is set to deploy mobile carts across the city to sell fruits and vegetables from Monday. To know the time of arrival of the carts or to check the prices, residents may contact the helpline numbers 94999 32899 or 044 4568 0200. The mobile carts will deliver from 6 am to 12 noon. In addition, online delivery services like Big Basket, Sunny Bee, Reliance and Pazhamudir have been allowed to continue their delivery services from 8 am to 6 pm.","People throng shops, disregard rules ahead of week-long intensified Covid lockdown in Tamil Nadu",POTATO

The price hike was blamed on a disruption in supply for the past two days in Pune district in the wake of cyclone Tauktae Sources said the intake at the Market Yard was less than average on Monday and Tuesday.The supply disruption has had an effect on the prices of vegetables. But this wont last long as a fresh supply of vegetables is soon expected, said Madhukant Garad, chief administrator of the Market Yard and secretary of the Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC).On an average, the Market Yard gets 900-950 truckloads of vegetables per day. This dropped to 850 truckloads on Monday, officials from the vegetables section at the Market Yard said.On Tuesday, we got 20,599 quintals of vegetables and fruits in 873 vehicles. This is less than the average intake and led to the price hike, Datta Kalamkar, head of the vegetables section, told TOI.Kalamkar said demand for all vegetables was high in the market. Poor weather and the cyclone have affected crops in most tehsils of the district, he explained.Vilas Bhujbal, head of the Commission Agents Association, said most farmers do not cultivate fresh vegetables, particularly coriander, fenugreek and spinach, due to uncertainty in sales and low rates. Several farmers had not planted cauliflower and tomato, among others, due to Covid restrictions. This has also disturbed the supply. Because of this, prices will remain high for a few days, he said.In the retail markets, a kilo of onion was sold for Rs15-20, while potato and tomato were going for Rs15-22 and Rs8-14 respectively.The rates of leafy vegetables too increased by Rs 5-10 per bunch. A bunch of Coriander is now sold for Rs 10Rs 15, while fenugreek is being sold for Rs12-18 per bunch. Spinach, meanwhile, costs Rs 7-12 per bunch.Sandesh Khade, a retailer from the Vishrantwadi market, said he expects the prices to remain high for two weeks at least. The supply shortage could affect prices for the next two weeks or so. Many farmers told us that they havent grown fresh vegetables because of the curbs, he said.Deepti Deshpande, a resident of Dighi employed with a private firm, said citizens will feel the pinch, especially with the financial impact of the ongoing pandemic. This comes at a time when salaries are being reduced. It has become difficult to meet our monthly expenses, she said.Archana Gardare, a resident of Dhankawdi, said, We always buy vegetables at high pricees.

As Chef de Cuisine, when he first served the dish at The Lalit London, it starred king fish along with tapioca, and was simply known as kappa meen curry. Back home in Kerala, sardines are usually used for the dish. Even though Jomon chose king fish because of its fleshy texture, the dish did not get the warm response he was expecting.Not one to give up, a few months later, in one of the usual menu rejigs, Jomon reintroduced the dish using the red mullet, a much-loved variety of fish in London. Now, Jomon had guests ordering it and complimenting him as well. I realised that the way the dish is presented and described makes all the difference. I tweaked the plating a bit, making the fish centre of attraction, so that guests of any nationality could relate to the description. I consider it an honour to showcase Kerala cuisine here, he says, over a call from London.Seared red mullet and cassava mash served with Alleppy fish curryThe only Malayali chef in the five star hotel that serves Indian food, Jomon was keen on including a number of dishes from his homeland in the menu. I just wanted to show that Indian food does not begin and end with butter chicken and tadka dal, he adds.Jomon has served everything from the traditional mathanga erissery (a curry made of pumpkin, dal and coconut) to payasam to the famed duck mappas. He served mathanga erissery as a vegan main course, calling it Pumpkin Steak. The konju theeyal (shrimp onion curry) was served along with lobster tail tandoor, with the theeyal made with shallots and crushed dried shrimp. When I was given charge of the menu, I wanted to bring in some diversity. I started researching my own food and I realise that nothing could possibly go wrong if you turn to your roots, he says.Payasam with caramelised bananaHe says he takes care to retain the authenticity of the dish, tweaking only the plating and the presentation. So even inherently Malayali ingredients such as vazhappindi (banana stem) or kovakka (ivy gourd), for instance, were transformed into steaks and salads. The simple milk payasam was made into a frozen dessert, garnished with caramelised banana sticks and served with crushed pappadam to add texture.The Lalit has just reopened after a year and Jomon spent the time at home, trying out a variety of new dishes and experimenting with unique ways of plating. He took virtual classes for a few universities online as well.Born and raised in Mavelikkara, Kerala, Jomon completed his hotel management course at Sarosh Institute of Hotel Management in Mangaluru. He moved to London in 2008, where he completed his post-graduation in Hospitality Management from the London School of Business and Computing. He started his career in London as the Chef de Partie at Bombay Palace, a high-end Indian restaurant in London. He worked as Senior Chef de Partie at Cinnamon Kitchen, a restaurant which specialises in merging eastern spices with western culinary styles, before moving to Baluchi, the pan-Indian dining destination at The Lalit in 2017.Coconut-stuffed and steamed sardine, colocasia brunoise cooked in turmeric brine liquid and a chutney made of mango, coconut and curry leavesThe love for food is what has brought him so far, believes Jomon, who appeared in BBCs Celebrity Master Chef 2018. He also got an opportunity to teach at the Hammersmith and West London College, where he had once hoped to study. This was a dream come true. I couldnt study at the college 12 years ago, as my circumstances did not permit it. But, I have no regrets today as I got a chance to teach in the very same college, he says.Ayala pollichathu (mackerel steamed in banana leaf) with chilli and shallots; mathi varuthathu (fried sardines); and potato mezhukkupuratti (a pepper stir-fry) are next on his list.

2021-05-27,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/the-post-covid-19-diet/article34656244.ece,"Once youve recovered from COVID-19 and are out of quarantine, your body needs strengthening for quick healingAsk anybody who has gone through the suffering and stress of COVID infection in the last 18 months; the common thread of complaints that emerges from their post-recovery experience is all about fatigue, weakness, and the loss of energy, appetite, strength, muscle mass and weight. The road to complete recovery from COVID-19 is tiring. Besides sleep and rest, eating healthy is an essential now to aid in healing.Good nutrition helps your battered body build up its energy levels as fast as possible, says Dr Kavitha Fenn Arunkumar, Madurai-based psychiatrist, referring not just to those who have suffered the sickness, but also those who have seen adversity through the pandemic. In fact, she recommends the intake of easy-to-digest food in frequent and small measures because the body and mind are both vulnerable and not in a condition to labour hard over three big elaborate meals.Dr Arunkumar receives three or four calls a day from those who have seen a COVID-19 death in their families and now during their own recuperation are finding it difficult to eat. The food we eat should be easy and comforting to chew and swallow, she says. She also cautions against emotional eating (feeding on convenience foods to satiate cravings). Its best to eat food that does not cause distress to the digestive system or any other part of the body, she says.Power up with nutrientsTo gain stamina and fight the weakness, Delhi-based nutritionist Shweta Gupta says it is important to power up with proteins as they help reverse tissue damage and stimulate the production of T-cells, the agents that promote healthy immune functioning. Proteins are the most important macro-nutrients that aid in rebuilding and recharging the body; vitamins improve immunity and probiotics improve the gut bacteria after the heavy antibiotic and steroid used in treatment, says Anjali Dange, nutritionist and founder of Starlite Nutrition and Wellness Centre, Visakhapatnam. For those who are lactose tolerant milk-based products have immunomodulatory, antimicrobial, and anti-hypertensive effects on the body.Buy fresh and seasonal fruits and vegetables for good healthThe carbohydrates in our breakfast and lunch can constitute up to 25%, says Gurugram nutritionist Asheesh Grewal. Our Indian kitchens are full of potent anti-inflammatory and anti-viral ingredients such as ginger, turmeric, garlic, cumin, coriander, mint, cinnamon, honey, all of which are usually and can be used in different combinations and different items for overall well being. One should nourish the body well for at least six months post-COVID treatment, he says.Comfort foodHome-maker Mili Ghosh from 24 South Paraganas, West Bengal, cooks and packs seven different types of khichdi for each day of the week and home delivers it fresh in her neighbourhood to those in home quarantine. After hearing a dietician on television, I began preparing khichdi using a different millet and combination of dals each day and powered it with lots of seasonal vegetables, says Mili, who has been doing this free of cost for six weeks now ever since her husband fell to COVID-19. Along with the nutritious and tasty khichdi, she also gives them a boiled egg five days a week and a flask of lassi daily. I am alone and this work keeps me going, she says.Suman Agarwal, from Mumbai, recommends the 4X model: four meals at agap of four hours each. Follow the 8 am- noon-4pm-8 pm or 9 am-1 pm-5 pm-9 pm schedule and control the portions, especially carbohydrates. Feed your hunger but never over-stuff, she says.Tips to follow at home: Avoid elaborate cooking and stick to simple recipes with more greens (Spinach, methi, sarson saag and other keerais) as they are known to lower anxiety levels.Make one or two vegetable chutneys and store, so that you can use them every day with rice or chapatis.Keep a jar of nuts and seeds by your side for easy snacking, They are potent sources of essential fatty acids such as Omega-3 and healthy fats that boost energy and promote healthy cholesterol levelsTaste and smell may take a while to return to normal making every bite of food utterly tasteless but it is important to keep up the appetite with small and frequent meals.The essential vitamins required during the period of healing are C and D. They help to prevent the body from oxidative damage and reduce inflammation. Stock yourself up with guavas, amla, kiwis, oranges and sweet lime for your lung healthSubhashree Ray, clinical and public health nutritionist in Mumbai, focusses on customised nutritional requirements of those with co-morbidities, particularly diabetes. Those with insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome need to be extra cautious of what is entering their body, she says and suggests complex carbohydrates such as whole grains and legumes for them. High fibre cereals and pulses like jawar, bajra, ragi, brown rice, oatmeal, millets, quinoa take longer to digest than simple carbs (refined grains like maida  often found in bread) and thereby keep the blood sugar from spiking, she adds. A staple cuisine of Bengal, the tetor dal (bitter lentil) made with the yellow split moong dal and karela (bitter gourd) is considered good.Nutrients-dense post-COVID recovery mealPasty khichdi with lots of vegetables; mashed dal or rasam with rice; curd rice; paneer or soya curry with two to three soft phulkas; green leafy and seasonal vegetables; steamed fish, egg and chicken (for non-vegetarians).Eat home-made balanced diet for the body to respond well and fast after infectionHealthy snacks:A bowl of salad or low-fat curd at room temperature, figs and dates, a spoonful of pumpkin, chia or flax seeds, boiled peanuts or chick peas, a fistful of nuts (including almonds, walnuts), sweet potato chaat or seasonal fruits.High hydration:Enough water, low salt lassi, coconut water, butter milk with a dash of cumin and mint, chaach, and fresh juice with seasonal fruits (without adding sugar), bael ka sharbat (it is high in fibre).Chicken or vegetable broth soupThe immunity boosters:You can make a variety of health drinks at home to improve your haemoglobin levels. Here are a few suggested by the nutritionists:Blend one small amla, half a carrot and apple each, one tomato, quarter of a boiled beetroot and half cup pomegranate; dilute it with little water to suit your taste.Kadha: To 300 ml boiling water add 10 basil (tulsi) leaves, four lightly crushed peppercorns, half inch grated ginger and one pinch cinnamon. Reduce the concoction to half and add one teaspoon honey.A simple concoction of coriander, cumin and fennel seeds (saunf) or lemon and barley water is good for general well-being.",Here’s what to include in your post-COVID-19 diet,POTATO

The government has not yet responded to the court order. Giving an indication that the government will take extreme caution before taking a stand on demands for and against going for appeal against the court order, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan at his press conference said any decision on the issue will be made after studying the details of the order.Blaming VS-led govt.The Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) leadership is in the forefront of the demand that the government appeal against the Division Bench order. Blaming the LDF government for the High Court ruling, IUML general secretary P.K. Kunhalikutty and party organising secretary E.T. Mohammed Basheer said at Malappuram that the order issued in 2011 by then LDF government led by V.S. Achuthanandan that introduced allocation up to 20% for Latin Catholics and converted Christians had created all the trouble. They noted that the earlier decision to provide scholarships and training to Muslim youths had been based on the Paloli Mohammed Kutty Commission recommendations.Sunni leader Kanthapuram Aboobacker Musaliyar, the Samastha Sunni faction, Jamaat-e-Islami State Ameer M.I. Abdul Azeez and Kerala Nadvathul Mujahid State committee also separately demanded that the State government appeal against the verdict. Kasim Irikkur, general secretary of the Indian National League, a coalition partner in the LDF, said the court order did not take into consideration the backwardness of the Muslim community detailed by the Sachar Committee.As expected Christian organisations welcomed the HC order. Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church Episcopal Synod secretary Youhanon Mar Diascoros Metropolitan and Malankara Mar Thoma Syrian Church head Mar Theodosius Mar Thoma Metropolitan were among the Church leaders who said that the court order would bring equality in the distribution of benefits to the minority communities. The Kerala Catholic Bishops Council and the Malankara Syrian Jacobite Church too have hailed the verdict. P.J. Joseph, chairman of the Kerala Congress, which is a coalition partner in the Opposition United Democratic Front, urged the State government to implement the HC order.A balancing actThe LDFs political experiment of forging a rainbow coalition that helped it make inroads into traditional anti-Left vote bases in the two dominant minority communities will now be under scrutiny.

About 34 deaths are being reported in Michigan each day, down from more than 130 a day last spring. (File)Written by Sarah MervoshAfter more than a year of pandemic restrictions, many Americans are leaving their masks behind, making summer travel plans and joyously reuniting with family and friends. As more are vaccinated and new infections plummet, there is a sense that the worst of the pandemic is over in the United States.But for people like Michele Preissler, 60, the worst has just begun.Preissler lost her husband to COVID-19 in late May, just as many restrictions were being lifted and life, for many, was starting to look more like normal. Customers were going without masks last week at the Walmart near her home in Pasadena, Maryland, where she was shopping for items for her husbands funeral.Everybody is saying, Oh, its fine, said Preissler, whose husband, Darryl Preissler, 63, loved to hunt, camp and go crabbing with his grandson, and was not vaccinated when he caught the virus at a wedding in early April. Im just thinking to myself, If you only knew what I just went through.With half of Americans protected with at least one dose of a vaccine, the virus outlook in this country is the best it has been at any point in the pandemic. New cases, hospitalizations and deaths are lower than they have been in many months, and even the most cautious health officials are celebrating the countrys progress. Fully vaccinated people, who are at low risk of catching and spreading the virus, have been told they can take off their masks and return to many regular activities, with the support of top scientists.Even now, though, about 450 deaths are being reported each day, and that has left hundreds of families dealing with a new kind of pandemic grief.Opinion | Vulnerable, scared, grief-stricken: How govts can support children whove lost parents to CovidUnlike earlier periods when most Americans were seeing their lives affected by COVID, relatives of people dying of the virus now describe a lonely sorrow: They are mourning even as so many others are celebrating newfound freedom. In one sign of the dissonance, the pandemic has improved enough that funerals  once forced to take place over Zoom  are mostly permitted to happen in person again, a bittersweet shift for those losing people now.In some cases, the grief has been complicated by new  and thorny  questions about vaccination. People dying from COVID-19 today are largely unvaccinated, health experts say. There have been some reports of people dying after being vaccinated, but experts say those are rare exceptions.Some people who died in recent weeks got sick before they were eligible for shots, raising questions about whether the United States vaccine rollout moved quickly enough to reach all Americans. The widespread availability of vaccines is still relatively recent  most states had opened vaccines to all adults by mid-April, with up to six weeks needed for full immunity  and it can take several weeks from the onset of symptoms for cases to turn fatal.Don't Miss | Mortgaging property, selling jewellery, drawing loans: how high Covid-19 bills are pushing families to the brink of penuryOthers who have died lately were hesitant to get shots, their relatives said, underscoring the challenge that remains ahead for health authorities in their quest to convince Americans of the safety of vaccination. Still others, like Darryl Preissler, who was busy at his job remodeling homes, simply had not yet gotten around to getting his shot, according to his wife, who already had been vaccinated.Its like being related to the soldier who gets shot before the armistice kicks in, said Dr. Toni Miles, an epidemiologist at the University of Georgia who studies grief and bereavement. Everybody else is insanely happy, as they should be, because the war has stopped, but you lost somebody during a period when nobody wants to grieve.The nation has not reached this level of deaths since early July, after the virus had diminished from the spring surge in places like New York and before a summer outbreak worsened. At the worst point, in January, more than 3,000 people were dying each day of the virus, a daily toll that has diminished by about 85%. Now, there is no one city or region driving COVID deaths. Small numbers of people are dying all over, from California to Florida.Even in the worst spots  Michigan leads the country in recent deaths per capita  the situation is vastly improved. About 34 deaths are being reported in Michigan each day, down from more than 130 a day last spring.In recent weeks, the people dying have been slightly younger, often in their 50s and 60s, a group that became eligible for vaccines later than the oldest Americans and has been slower to accept the vaccine. In May, there were more deaths reported among people ages 50 to 64 than in those 85 and older, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In January, those numbers were reversed; people 85 and older had accounted for about double the number of deaths as the younger group.Most of the people critically sickened from the virus now have not had vaccines.The majority that Ive taken care of personally that became sick enough to be hospitalized, all of them were not vaccinated, either fully or at all, said Dr. Mark Hamed, an emergency room physician in Sandusky, Michigan, and the medical director for eight rural counties in the state.For families of those who are dying now, the entire issue of vaccination has created a new layer of discomfort  and a set of difficult questions that no one was asking in the early months of the crisis, before vaccines.Hollie Rivers has been devastated in the weeks since her husband, Antwone, died in Michigan. He had helped raise their blended family of five children, Rivers said, and had worked his way up to manager level at his job at a vehicle logistics company. She said he became her life partner  the Charlie, as she called him, to her Angel. At his funeral in May, she helped carry the coffin.I wanted to hold him until the very end, until I couldnt hold him any longer, Rivers said.But after Rivers, 28, gave an interview to a Detroit-area television station and disclosed that her husband had not been vaccinated, she said she faced critical comments online. She and her husband had been initially hesitant, she said, but were considering getting the vaccine. Then Antwone Rivers, 40, got sick in early April, his wife said, before Michigan opened up vaccination to people his age.Hollie Rivers described some online comments, including on a family GoFundMe page, as plainly hostile: He refused the shot, how could you dare ask for money? she recalled the tone of one message suggesting.Now I just feel like I want to cancel it. Its not about money, said Rivers, who is on short-term leave from her job installing car door panels. I would live in a cardboard box if it meant my husband coming back to me and his kids.Miles, the epidemiologist who studies grief, said she had seen such dynamics play out in deaths from diseases like lung cancer or diabetes.We are shaming the dead, just like we always have, she said.Camille Wortman, a grief expert and professor emeritus at Stony Brook University in New York, said that survivors who lose a loved one to COVID-19 at this point in the pandemic might be more likely to experience feelings of anger, guilt and regret.The impact of the vaccine is really huge, and the grief of survivors will be more intense, she said.For Yvonne Santos, 30, of Houston, questions about whether her husbands death could have been prevented find her in quiet moments  when she is looking at photos of the two of them together, or when she feels the weight of her in-laws grief. Santos said she had been worried about the safety and efficacy of the vaccines, because of how rapidly they had been created and produced. Her husband, Angel, also delayed getting a shot.I dont talk about it with anybody else, but I do feel bad, because he didnt really question it as much as I did, Santos said. I was the one who was still afraid.Santos said she and her husband both came down with the virus. After testing positive in early April, Angel Santos, a juvenile supervision officer, spent weeks in the hospital, where, she said, he expressed regret that he did not get the vaccine. He died May 19, at the age of 35.Yvonne Santos now plans to get vaccinated, she said. While she said she didnt know if getting vaccinated would have spared her husband, she said she might have fewer regretsThen at least we knew we did everything we could, she said.Deaths from the coronavirus typically happen several weeks after initial infections, experts say. As cases plunge nationally, deaths have also fallen and may continue decreasing in the weeks to come.On the day that the CDC announced that vaccinated Americans no longer needed to wear masks in most situations indoors  a move that was greeted by many as a sign of the end to the pandemic  Kole Riley, 33, was at his mothers bedside at a hospital near Sedona, Arizona, saying a final goodbye.His mother, Peggy Riley, 60, had taken a turn for the worse after falling sick with the coronavirus weeks earlier. She had not gotten vaccinated because she believed she had antibodies, her family said. Several members of their family, including Rileys husband, had shown signs or been diagnosed with COVID-19 late last year.After holding her hand in her final moments, her son emerged from the hospital to find far fewer people wearing masks and a country that seemed to have moved on. He was still thinking about his mother, a real estate agent who jogged in her free time and wowed family and friends with her homemade ribs and potato salad.Angry is the best and most polite way I could say it, said Kole Riley, after seeing maskless shoppers in a convenience store.He struggled to reconcile his grief with the countrys optimism.I didnt think I would be dealing with this, he said, when all the arrows are pointing back to normal.","Pandemic in US has vastly improved, but for these families, the worst has just begun",POTATO

Dr Markus Hofmeyr, a wildlife veterinarian who is the Director of Rhino Recovery Fund, and Vivek Menon, Chair, Asian Elephant Specialist Group, IUCN, suggested that the cause of deaths was suspected lightning strike.Meanwhile, Apurba Ballav Goswami, who is an Assam-based environmentalist and senior journalist, filed an FIR with the police on Thursday holding some senior forest officials and a power company responsible for the alleged choking of the elephant corridor at the site of the incident.""At the foothills of Bamuni Pahar, there has been a village named Mikir Bamuni Grant village.

(Representational Photo)Balwinder Singh (50), a farmer of Tarewala village in Moga district, had grown summer moong on 35 acres this year with a hope of getting Rs 7,196 MSP announced by the Centre. On Tuesday, however, he sold his crop at the rate of Rs 6,000 to 6,200 per quintal, around 17 per cent to 14 per cent below the MSP fixed on the recommendation of Commission for Agriculture Cost and Price (CACP).As summer moong started reaching Punjab mandis a few days back, the price opened 10 to 17 per cent below MSP.After selling his crop, Balwinder said: I brought my crop to Jagraon mandi in Ludhiana district as it is one of the main markets for moong dal crop. It is auctioned with the help of arhtiyas and private players purchase it. Government has neither any role in procurement nor a control over its prices. We have to sell it as per market rate as we do not have any other optionAlso Read | For Punjab, pulses could hold key to breaking wheat-paddy cycleBalwinder grows summer moong (March to June), apart from paddy (June to October) and potato (October to March). He has around 60 acres of land.Another farmer, Avtar Singh, sold his moong crop at the rate of Rs 6,500 per quintal in Rayya mandi in Amritsar district. He said that private players are not ready to give farmers the MSP fixed by the government. Government must have some control on the MSP fixed by it, he said.In the retail market the rate of moong dal is Rs 110 per kg, which comes to Rs 11,100 per quintal.Moong cultivation provides farmers with an opportunity to have a third crop in a year. Moreover, moong being a leguminous crop is beneficial for the soil as it helps in nitrogen fixation and contributes to improving soil fertility. It is just a 65-day crop.President of Federation of Arhtiya Association Punjab, Vijay Kalra, said that the moong dal has started arriving in around half dozen markets of the state and the maximum rate is Rs 6,500 per quintal and minimum around Rs 6,000 per quintal, which may go up because it is just the beginning of the arrival of the crop in the mandis.Going by the economics of this crop, farmers can get 5-6 quintals moong per acre (12-15 quintals per hectare if the crop is bumper) which translates to Rs 35,980 to 43,176 per acre if they get the MSP of moong decided by the Centre (Rs 7,196 per quintal). But at the current market price, a farmer would be selling it at Rs 30,000 to Rs 36,000 per acre. While the input cost would be around Rs 8,000-9,000 per acre including seed, labour, and other expenditure. But if the farmer has taken the field on rent then he has to bear the rental cost of around Rs 18,000 per acre. (Annual rental cost of per acre is Rs 45,000 to 55,000 per acre in most part barring some districts of Malwa regions where annual rent is Rs 60,000 to 65,000 per acre. If a farmer is growing three crops he has to include 1/3rd rental cost per crop)Experts said that after deducting input cost and rental cost, he would be left with Rs 8,000 to 15,000 per acre if he sells crops at the fixed MSP, but at current market price, he would be getting Rs 3000 to Rs 9,000 per acre only. If a farmer has his own land then he can make a reasonable profit of Rs 21,000 to Rs 27,000 per acre.This expenditure does not include the family labour hours and when those are included, then the farmers will be at loss which means that not only the MSP should be increased as per the formula of M S Swaminathan commissions recommendation but also farmers should get the full MSP, said Jagmohan Singh, general secretary, BKU (Dakuanda).","Summer moong sells below MSP in mandis, farmers say have no choice",POTATO

Of course. The real challenge is creating one that is delicious as well, since virtue alone cannot fuel sales.Recently launched Flipside has a secret weapon up its sleeve: the Beyond Meat burger, which is now making its India debut.In the bustling kitchen, chef Deepesh Chandran experiments with the first batch, searing a Beyond Meat patty, then layering it with cheese, lettuce and tomatoes. Placing it on the table with a flourish and French fries, he slices the burger into two to study its pleasing caramelised surface and intricate marbling of fat for optimum juiciness and a springy texture. Then does the same with the brands Beyond Sausage.A worthy back storyA clever alchemy of plant proteins, cacao butter and beetroot juice all intricately knitted together to provide a tasty alternative to meat, the product has a loyal following among vegetarians and vegans in the United States, where it was launched in 2012. Founded in 2009, in Los Angeles, Beyond Meat attempts to offer consumers plant-based substitutes that have more protein than their animal counterparts, no cholesterol, less saturated fat and no antibiotics or hormones.More sophisticated than the fake meat and soy substitutes of yore, these products are engineered to taste familiar, primarily appealing to a niche but growing group of vegans and vegetarians who have given up eating meat for ethical reasons. For protein, there is pea, mung bean, faba bean and brown rice, with beetroot juice and apple extract for colour, potato starch for texture and so on.Read More | India leans into better vegan options across the boardThe company saw a surge in demand with the pandemic, with more people cooking at home, and also looking for healthier alternatives for themselves as well as the planet. Now, expect to see it roll out in supermarkets and restaurants in India.In Chennai, you can sample it first at Flipside, where Beyond Meat burgers will be added to the menu this weekend. Taruna Hinduja, who runs Flipside, says that they are excited about being able to showcase what she believes could be the future of protein.Of course, the cheery restaurant, which as a mid-pandemic launch has been focussed on takeaway, will continue to put together traditional meat burgers as well. The American style smash burgers they specialise in, involve pressing down the meat on an iron skillet with a spatula and searing it for crisp edges with steamy interiors.Flipside offers customers the option to tailor burgers with the plant-based alternative, thus gently updating a deliberately old school menu focussed on comfort food and nostalgia. Leaning into a world of bright American sitcoms from the 90s, choose from classic burgers, as well as a kitchen sink version, with smoky barbeque sauce, jalapenos and fries.If you are feeling adventurous, try the startling Louisiana Fry Master, where the entire burger is deep fried with cheddar, mozzarella, garlic aioli, pickles and caramelised onion.Will it work with Beyond Meat?

Raised at Iwo Jima, it was a symbol of victory. Lit on fire, it became a searing image of the protests against the Vietnam War. Ribboned around the twin towers on commemorative 9/11 lapel pins, it is a reminder of the threats against a delicate democracy.Politicians of both parties have long sought to wrap themselves in the flag. But something may be changing: Today, flying the flag from the back of a pickup or over a lawn is increasingly seen as a clue, albeit an imperfect one, to a persons political affiliation in a deeply divided nation.Supporters of former President Donald Trump have embraced the flag so fervently  at his rallies, across conservative media and even during the Jan. 6 assault on the Capitol  that many liberals such as Treiber worry that the left has all but ceded the national emblem to the right.What was once a unifying symbol  there is a star on it for each state, after all  is now alienating to some, its stripes now fault lines between people who kneel while The Star-Spangled Banner plays and those for whom not pledging allegiance is an affront.And it has made the celebration of the Fourth of July, of patriotic bunting and cakes with blueberries and strawberries arranged into Old Glory, into another cleft in a country that seems no longer quite so indivisible, under a flag threatening to fray.Treibers farm is in the town of Southold, a string of hamlets and a village on the North Fork of Long Islands Suffolk County.

The sentiment was shared by about 80% of white Americans, just under 70% of Hispanic Americans and slightly less than 60% of Black Americans.The divisions were deeper when it came to politics. While 66% of Republicans surveyed said they associated the flag with their own party, only 34% of Democrats said the same.At its 1777 inception, the flags very design signified unity, the joining of the 13 colonies, said John Vile, a professor of political science and a dean at Middle Tennessee State University.Politicizing the American flag is thus a perversion of its original intent, according to Vile, who is also the author of The American Flag: An Encyclopedia of the Stars and Stripes in U.S. History, Culture and Law.

His kneeling protest, Kaepernick has said, still demonstrated respect for the flag, but others saw him as hijacking the flag for political purposes.Maryneily Rodriguez, 33, said she believed that Trumps most fervent supporters had done the same. Rodriguez, who was visiting Greenport with her fiance during the Fourth of July weekend, said she once regularly flew the flag at her home in Freeport, about 80 miles west on Long Island, taking it down only in winter for safekeeping.

It was not a prop for a political rally, but rather a peaceful field of honor installed by the Greenport Rotary Club.Each flag represented not an ideological belief, according to the club, but a veteran or other citizen who had inspired or helped the community.Ive always loved the American flag so much, and now seeing it by the carousel I felt happy again, Rodriguez said, as all around her red, white, and blue cloth still waved.

2021-07-04,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/the-as-light-as-air-souffl/article35130887.ece,"The perfect souffl is a work of art, involving a judicial balance between air and moisture, using a bain-marie, pre-chilling the mixture, and so onThe origin story of my souffl-making is now lost in the mists of time. However, I will admit that it had a lot to do with the fact that, after a string of epic fails with everyday lunches, I turned to baking under the impression that baked dinners would make for at least one decent meal per day.I do remember that my first attempt turned out fairly well, and souffl philistines that my husband and I were, how much it rose was the exact amount of rise we expected, and since we loved eggs, this was a light and satisfying dinner. Soon it became cheese souffl for dinner one night every week.My souffl-making started in the pre-Internet days, so my go-to recipe was one culled from a 1966 issue of my grandmothers stash of Woman & Home. I read the recipe, more than a bit surprised at how easy it seemed. Apparently, all one needed was some white flour, butter, eggs, cheese and milk... and some wrist game to beat the eggs to frothy perfection. In 1966, apparently manual exertion was what made for light-as-air souffls. In time, the kid was an enthusiastic, if slightly ineffectual, egg-beater when she was home for the holidays. Later on in life, the husband eschewed the egg-beater in order to go at the mixture manually, with delicious results.Flavours galoreNecessity being the mother of invention and all that, I soon turned to my masala shelves to desify the flavour of my souffl. Voila! A touch of cracked pepper, a pinch of chilli powder, finely minced garlic, all wonderfully amplified the basic flavour.As time went by, I grew more daring in my experiments. Id grate onion and add it to the mix. Paprika and mustard became regular features, as did julienned mushrooms, bits of salmon, ham, bacon. Once in a while, though, Id overplay my hand. Like the time I diced coloured bell peppers, cauliflower and cooked potatoes, and put it into the souffl. Or the time I sliced sausage bits into it; another time I slid sliced sweet potato bits into the mix. These souffls rose but not too high, were definitely not light as air, and though the end result was delectable, any old-fashioned professional chef, fictional or real, from Bertie Woosters aunt Dahlias cook Anatole to Auguste Escoffier would have immediately castigated me for passing off a Spanish omelette as a souffl.Just eggs and cheeseThen there are individuals and establishments aplenty who make fruit souffls but that offends the purist in me. If a souffl doesnt have eggs and cheese in it, it simply is not a souffl, so say I. As for souffls made with coffee liqueurs, chocolate or Grand Marnier, lets call them by their right names, shall we? They are custards. Or mousses.Reading up on this dish, I found that the perfect souffl was a work of art, involving a judicial balance between air and moisture, using a bain-marie, pre-chilling the mixture, and so on. I also gleaned several useful facts. That a souffl rose to wonderful heights only if it involved the use of many eggs and was a smoother than silk mixture. That a spoonful of cream along with the milk made for an uber-binder. That it was best eaten hot, not after it had fallen in on itself and become some sort of an egg casserole; this collapse is often because the dish is baked to a dry consistency, so a jiggle test comes in handy here. That a few cheeses did nothing for the dish, being stringy or bland, while most others gave it a sublime flavour. That the external browning did not always correspond to a fully cooked interior. That all your efforts will come to naught if you dont have a ceramic souffl dish or ramekin with sides high enough to encourage the souffl to reach for the sky. That there shouldnt be even a smidgen of yolk in the egg white mix. That the egg whites have to be beaten to a just-so consistency: not too wet, not too stiff. That all your efforts will (again) come to naught if you open the oven door while the souffl is baking inside.Better versionSome years ago, a group of us dined at Le Voltaire restaurant on the Left Bank in Paris. I ordered an onion soup (another dish which I make often at home) and a cheese souffl. Behaving rather typically, our group was soon tasting each others food. The French onion soup was far better than my version. The souffl was excellent, literally melting in the mouth, the cheese leaving a lingering aftertaste.Everyone had a forkful of the souffl. Then everyone turned to me as one and said, I dont know what it is but I much prefer your souffls. More chatpata.It was hard not to feel smug, that much I will tell you.SUNDAY RECIPECheese souffl(from the cult cookbook Larousse Gastronomique)Ingredients40 gms butter, plus extra for greasing 40 gms flour2 decilitres or 1 cup cold milk4-5 large eggs75-90 gms cup finely grated Gruyere cheese60 gms finely grated Parmesan cheesePinch of saltPepperGrated nutmegMethod1.

This year  hold your breath  chocolate meets Maggi.The popular noodles, garnished with Cadburys Gems or MnMs, created a stir on Social Media. It was not the only one. It inspired another dessert, created by mixing crumbled Oreo cookies with boiled Maggi, much to the delight of meme-makers.Deepa Reddy, founder of Fonce Chocolates in Hyderabad, says she still has nightmares about an encounter with chocolate dosas. I saw it on a menu in Hyderabad and felt bad for both the dosa and chocolate. I love both, but cannot imagine putting the two together, even for the sake of experimenting. She tried chocolate makhana (fox nut) too and was left disappointed, she says.Nevertheless, Deepa is eager to push boundaries too: At Fonce, she has introduced potato wafers with chocolate (on the lines of popular Royce chocolate potato wafers), and also offers more conventional combinations with fresh fruits like kiwi and pineapple.Indians are not the only ones experimenting with unexpected combinations; worldwide, there have been experiments like chocolate pasta, chocolate mushroom, chocolate Cheetos, chocolate octopus and more. And then there is the oddly seductive chocolate bacon.In the meantime, however, many connoisseurs prefer their bars unsullied by distracting ingredients.

2021-07-08,https://www.newindianexpress.com/business/2021/jul/08/does-itcs-potato-biscuit-infringe-prans-trade-dress-2326965.html,"Sesa Sen ByExpress News ServiceNEW DELHI: Packaged food major ITC Ltd has launched Sunfeast All-Rounder  a chatpata masala flavored thin potato biscuits widely advertising it is as Indias own just weeks after Bangladesh-based Pran Foods Potata became an internet sensation.However, questions have been raised on its identical product packaging, which comes in bright red colour with a stacking of potato wafers in the same quadrant on the wrapper, triggering concerns over violation of trade dress under the ambit of Intellectual Property Rights (IPR).It is a fairly common branding strategy to deliberately use some similar elements. But that said, ITC seems to have the upper hand here because of the distinct brand name. At this stage, Pran can make a trade dress claim. But, protection of trade dress is an evolving concept and doesnt have much of a legal recognition in India, said Nikhil Narendran, a Partner in Trilegal.Trade dress is a form of intellectual property, which deals with the visual or sensual appearance of a packaged product, which can even include its packaging, shape, combination of colors which may be registered and protected from being used by competitors in relation to their business and services. In India, there is no specific definition of trade dress under Trademark Act 1999. But due to the development in intellectual property laws, a new amendment recognised trade dress protection through a new definition of a trademark under Section 2 of the Trademark Act.The common law of passing off provides protection of trade dress. According to Ankur Raheja, an expert in IPR law, this case can amount to passing-off as to packaging. The packaging gets a cover under Copyright Act as to artistic work, and that need not be compulsorily registered in India. However, it may not be easy as the court may look into various other factors in addition to packaging such as for how long and how widely the product of the Bangladesh brand is available in India, and if the reputation of the other brand (Pran) is being impacted. Passing off is akin to trade mark infringement, but applies to protect unregistered rights associated with a particular business, its goods or services.Law professionals agree that similarity exists in this case, but they say it is a theoretical argument as all copying is not actionable under law. Also, high-profile trademark disputes, such as the litigation between Britannia and ITC over the packaging of digestive biscuits or even the Emami-HUL tussle over rights of brand name, often pit big businesses against one another. But, when the defendant is a relatively smaller company it can be a life-or-death contest.FMCG major ITC Ltd has a stronger distribution muscle and with the new launch the company is well placed to disrupt Indias Rs 6,000 crore cracker biscuits category. Pran is not as big as ITC Ltd, but it isnt a small company either. It has a factory in Agartala, Tripura and the brand Potata has a registered trademark in India. The company exports to over 140 countries and its export revenues alone are nearly Rs.100 crore.Dev Robinson, partner and national practice head, IPR, Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas & Co pointed out that, only that which comes too close such that there is confusion in the minds of the consumers, or very close in terms of artwork etc., may be actionable. Even in saying so, two products of different sources and having similar overall visual get up may not be actionable, one against the other, if either one cannot demonstrate having acquired significant goodwill. This presupposes the fact that none of them have trade mark registrations, because if one does, a trade mark gives a prima facie actionable right in the favour of the registrant.He further added that the court has to balance both the similarities and the dissimilarities in this case, to arrive at a position as to whether the dissimilarities are sufficient to enable a person of average intelligence to discern that the two products are indeed from different sources. In other words, such a person would not confuse one product as actually being the other.Even given the similarities that both packages are predominantly red, have stacking of potato wafers, presence of natural potato, spices and herbs, the common elements have been differently used. Therefore, the similarities, though they exist, are not likely to be sufficient to be able to objectively conclude that there is an infringement either in copyright, trademark or the law of passing off and trade dress.ITC Ltd has dodged the query and refused to comment. Ahsan Khan Chowdhury, chairman and CEO of the Pran-RFL Group, the parent company which owns the brand, said it doesnt have any copyright issues with ITC. Nonetheless, even if the company is dragged to the courts, ITC will be well prepared to defend such claims, as this is part of the business environment, noted Sandeep Pai, partner at Link Legal.",Does ITC’s potato biscuit infringe Pran's trade dress?,POTATO

Their demand is complete repeal of these legislations. According to them, the stockholding limits go against the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.Pulses are basic and essential food items in our country, but these have been excluded from the list of essential food items under the EC (Amendment) Act, said Jagmohan Singh Patiala, general secretary, Bharti Kisan Union (BKU) Ekta (Dakaunda). Farm unions have already pointed out that the new amended Act says that its purpose is enhancing income of farmers, but the Essential Commodities (EC) Act, 1955, was never about farmers or their incomes. It was about preventing agri-business companies and big traders  which have the means to stock farmers produce  from hoarding and then selling these at higher price at the time of shortage or by creating false shortage of such items, which are the basic requirement of every consumer, including the poor, he added.But new Act has removed all these restrictions and given a free hand to agri business companies or traders to hoard such food commodities. This is why farmers are calling it the Food Hoarding (Freedom for Corporates) Act, said Satnam Singh Sahni of Samyukat Kisan Morcha (SKM).Now when the government is imposing restrictions on stock limit to control the inflation of food commodities, it means that government itself wants to stop stockists from hoarding pulses and taking control of the market, said another farm leader of SKM, Balbir Singh Rajewal, adding that price rise in retail market never benefits farmers but stockists, and badly impacts consumers, particularly the poor. The government should realize this as soon as possible and repeal these laws, he added.How can the government exclude cereals, pulses, oilseed, onion, potato from the list of essential commodities, when hoarding of these would lead to inflation? If the government needs to issue such stockholding limits orders often, then what was the need to include such clauses in the amended Act? said Sukhdev Singh Kokrikalan, general secretary, BKU Ugrahan, adding that while the Act says that the government will regulate these commodities under extraordinary circumstances, prices are rising every coming day.The Department of Consumer Affairs (DCA) had last week issued an order to impose stockholding limits on all pulses, barring moong or green gram, for a period up to October 31, 2021. The limits have been fixed at 200 tonnes for wholesale traders and importers, and 5 tonnes for retailers. The stock limit for processors/dal millers has been set at the last three months production or 25 per cent of annual installed capacity, whichever is higher.Threat to food securityFarmers said this is a threat to food security. There used to be several regulatory tools with the government in the earlier ECA 1955  licensing, price control, compulsory licensing, stocking, information collection and production for inspection records, entry/search/examination of premises and seizure etc.  but all of this is being thrown away now under the new law, said Sahni.Not only is this Act is arbitrary but another farm law  the Contract Farming Act, 2020  promotes hoarding under its section -7, which says obligation related to stock limit shall not be applicable to such quantities of farming produce as are purchased under a farming agreement entered into in accordance with the provisions of this Act, said the All Indian Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee had said in its earlier statement sent to the Centre.Such a clause of the Contract farming Act is also arbitrary and it is again a proof of the governments hasty decision of bringing such laws and overlapping the provisions of one law with the other to complicate the matter for every one, said a farmer, adding that the government should shun its ego in the larger interest of the poor of this country as well as farmers and general consumers.The Essential Commodities Act, 2020","In pulses’ stock limit order, govt admission that not all right with agri laws: farm unions",POTATO

Altering your diet and choosing home remedies could make a difference.Sweat StackersSays Dr Rinky Kapoor, Cosmetic Dermatologist and Dermato-surgeon, The Esthetic Clinics, pan-India, Food low in fibre strains the digestive system. These include chocolates, breads, processed foods and fast-food items, fat-rich products, including high-fat milk, and liquor. Garlic and onion (their allium content gets converted to sulphur inside our body), hot peppers and spicy foods are high in capsaicin, that cause your brain to think that you are feeling hot, resulting in the sweat glands working overtime. Caffeine too adds to the feeling of hotness as the intake increases heart rate and blood pressure and the body reacts by activating sweat glands. If you have a high sodium diet, the body expels this salt in the form of excess sweat and urine.Carb-rich food is tough to break down by the digestive system and, hence, it produces a significant thermic effect. Sugar-laced foods can spike your insulin, resulting in profuse sweating. Excess of protein powered thermogenic foods on consumption lead to more urea production inside your body, which is expelled as sweat. Smoking contributes to excessive sweating, Kapoor explains adding, When you smoke, the nicotine releases acetylcholine. This increases the bodys temperature, causing more sweating. Likewise, when you take a sip of your favourite beer or wine, the blood vessels dilate, raising the bodys temperature, causing perspiration.Tackle toneWork at reducing the workload on your digestive system by eating the correct foods. Dr Divya Malik, Senior Nutritionist at Apollo Spectra Hospitals, Delhi, suggests using olive oil while cooking food as it prevents the body temperature from rising, curbing sweat production. Green tea is popular for its calming effects. Even a glass of homemade, fresh tomato juice keeps perspiration at bay. Stay hydrated with fluids such as coconut water, lemonade, buttermilk, watermelon juice or fresh fruit juice, if you experience severe sweating.Cut out extra salt consumption by giving up salad dressings, instant soups, potato chips, roasted nuts, and canned foods. Instead, increase your intake of vegetables high in water content like spinach, bottle gourd, cucumber, broccoli, sweet potato, lettuce, cauliflower, bell pepper, cantaloupe, eggplant, and red cabbage. Fruits such as grapes, oranges, lemon, pineapple and watermelon help you stay fresh. Have bananas four times a week, and combine milk with morning cereal.

2021-07-14,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/sri-lanka-economy-in-crisis-as-debt-mounts-reserves-dwindle/article35315515.ece,"Sri Lanka was in trouble before the pandemic struck, laying low a tourism industry that is a vital source of foreign exchange earnings.  Sri Lanka has cut back on imports of farm chemicals, cars and even its staple spice turmeric as its foreign exchange reserves dwindle, hindering its ability to repay a mountain of debt as the South Asian island nation struggles to recover from the pandemic.  Toothbrush handles, venetian blinds, strawberries, vinegar, wet wipes and sugar are among the hundreds of foreign-made goods that were banned or made subject to special licensing requirements meant to chip away at a trade deficit that has been deepening the country's financial quandary for years.  Shortages are pushing prices higher for many consumer goods, from bread to construction materials to gasoline, triggering protests among Sri Lankans fed up with the prolonged crisis.  Thusitha Vipulanayake ran out of motorcycles to sell in August 2020. Usually able to sell at least 30 a month, and a dozen motorized trishaws, he now gets by selling bottled, locally grown turmeric paste and LED lightbulbs.  This is something we never expected,"" Mr. Vipulanayake said as he sat at his empty motorcycle showroom along a road outside the capital Colombo.  Tourism  Sri Lanka was in trouble before the pandemic struck, laying low a tourism industry that is a vital source of foreign exchange earnings. It normally provides jobs for more than 3 million people and accounts for about 5% of GDP.  Visitors already were staying away after deadly suicide bombings on Easter Day 2019 killed more than 250 people. But efforts to revive the industry are falling flat as the country endures another wave of COVID-19 infections.  Foreign debts  Now, the countrys foreign exchange reserves have dwindled to barely enough to pay for three months of imports at a time when big repayments of its foreign debts are falling due, straining its financial system. The Petroleum Minister, Udaya Gammapilla, recently said the country lacked enough cash to pay for oil imports.  To conserve precious foreign exchange, the government has limited U.S. dollar transactions. Despite the limits imposed last year, imports still outpace the country's exports of tea, rubber, seafood and garments.  The condition of the economy is in dire straits, there is no doubt about it said Muttukrishna Sarvananthan, head of the economic research group Point Pedro Institute of Development.  Sri Lanka needs to make foreign debt payments totaling $3.7 billion this year, having paid $1.3 billion so far. Thats in addition to local debt, according to the central bank. Its currency has been gradually weakening against other major currencies, making such repayments more costly in local terms.  Fitch Ratings has downgraded Sri Lanka to its CCC category, indicating a real possibility of default. It says the countrys foreign debt obligation will balloon to $29 billion over the next five years.  And it is facing the possible loss of preferential trade status for its garment exports to Europe, due to criticism over an terrorism law that critics say violates human rights.  To help rebuild its reserves, Sri Lanka obtained a $1.5 billion swap facility from China earlier this year. A $400 million swap from India will be available by August, according to the Central Bank.  Officials say they hope to attract more foreign investment and avoid seeking help from the International Monetary Fund, which tends to impose strict policy conditions on its borrowers.  Organic farming  The government's decision in April to ban the use of agricultural chemicals, ordering farmers to switch to organic farming, was aimed at saving $400 million a year on imports.  But Sri Lankan farmers rely heavily on such chemicals. Some said they are using cow dung, poultry litter and compost to make up for the loss of fertilizer, but the sudden switch is hurting yields.  The leaders of the country could have done better in making decisions, farmer Pathmasiri Kumara said he worked in his field in Welimada, a village in the central hills of this tropical island country. These problems come when you dont come and see the farmers and make decisions sitting on swiveling chairs.  Look at this potato plant, it's not growing the way it should because there is no fertilizer, Kumara said. It's a very sad situation. This is our main crop and if we dont get chemical fertilizer we will be losing our income for the entire year, at least by half.""  The pressure is on garment makers, as well, as the European Union reviews its favorable tariff treatment for Sri Lankan products under the GSP, or generalized system of preferences. It eliminates import duties on a large share of Sri Lankas products, such as textiles, tea and fish, an advantage worth some $360 million annually, according to the EU.  A decision is not due until next year. But the impact of losing the concessions would be quite severe,"" said Sirimal Abeyratne, professor of economics at the University of Colombo.  About 20% of Sri Lankas total exports are to EU countries. Another 10% go to the United Kingdom, which may follow the EUs lead if it suspends its GSP status, said Abeyratne.  In the meantime, Sri Lankans are chafing at the import restrictions that are slowing activity in various industries.  Metlal Weerasuriya waited five months to buy a toilet for his home.  I went to many retail and wholesale shops. They had run out of stocks and there was a waiting list to get one, said Mr. Weerasuriya, a journalist. Finally, he tracked down one advertised online.  So, it took at least five months to buy a commode and complete the bathroom, he said.  Mr. Vipulanayake, the motorcycle dealer, said he's relying on income from a modest rubber plantation he owns, on top of his sales of various other products, to get by.  He's determined to hold onto his showroom, which is in a prime location.  I believe things will be okay and bikes will come,"" he said.

One of my earlier memories is of a cycle-led cart stopping by the place where I  and a lot of other hungry young lads  lived. The compartment at the back of the cycle was filled with flaky patties and vegetable burgers  essentially a potato patty between two small soft buns. I preferred the burgers to the patties, which were so flaky that they disintegrated when you touched them. The vendor would place one on a paper plate and squeeze some ketchup on the side. Food couldnt ever get better, I used to think, biting into the bun-and-potato.  Over the years, burgers have gone through a metamorphosis. I think my first classy burgers were at Wengers restaurant, just above the confectionery, and then, several years later, at Nirulas in Connaught Place. Until some years ago, burgers were simple dishes  two pieces of soft bun holding together a juicy lamb or chicken patty. The buns were often speckled with sesame seeds, the insides were brushed with mayo or sometimes with thousand island sauce. A crisp lettuce leaf and rings of onion added taste and texture.  But that was then. Over the past few years, I have had various kinds of burgers, prepared with imagination and ingredients such as blue cheese, caramelised onions, imported bacon, celery slaw, fried eggs and what have you.  A foodie friend mentioned ordering burgers from a place called Burgerama. I had heard about it, too, but hadnt tried out their fare. It is a delivery chain that serves Delhi-NCR (order at burgerama.in or on Zomato; 215 to 545). I learnt later that it was the brainchild of three friends and the focus was on cheeseburgers.  Ours is a meat loving home, so when we looked at the website, the focus was on different kinds of meat. We agreed on a bender lamb burger, bacon double cheese chicken burger, and T-Rex tenderloin burger. The sides consisted of onion rings, French fries, hot wings, and galaxy bombs (Panko-crusted deep fried chocolate).  I liked the sides, especially the crispy wings and the crunchy onion rings. The potato fries were a bit limp, though, but that could have been because of the weather.  What I really enjoyed was the bacon wrapped lamb burger.

Chowdhury also presented this dish the traditional way, with side dishes of a home-style aloo mash and sardines fry.  Naturally, netizens in the region went wild with appreciation for Chowdhurys home-pride move.  Panta bhaat, also known as poita bhaat or pakhala bhaat, is nothing but leftover rice that has been fermented overnight. What makes this dish a favourite is the wide range of side dishes that can accompany it, varying according to the season.  Read More | Panta bhaat: What makes a dish of leftover rice soaked in water so special?  In Odisha, a favourite side dish with the pakhala bhaat is a batter-fried pumpkin flower, apart from potato mash and fish fry. In Bengali homes, panta bhaat is always accompanied by fried fish or potatoes. In Assam, the favourite accompaniment with poita bhaat is the aloo pitika (potato mash), roasted brinjal mash, roasted jackfruit seed mash and fried fish. Stir-fried tender pumpkin creepers are another popular accompaniment.  Those who love that extra tang in their bowl of fermented rice add a dash of lemon to it. Panta bhaat lovers will also agree that the best flavour from the bowl of fermented rice comes only after the mushy rice and water have been mixed well by hand before eating. A dash of mustard oil, salt, green chillies and finely-chopped onions can heighten the flavour.  The best panta bhaat has rice that is starchy and non-fragrant.

They have big plans for fast-casual Indian food. (Emon Hassan/The New York Times)  Written by Priya Krishna  Ten years ago, Roni Mazumdar cautiously added a Bengali dish from his childhood  a beet, carrot, potato and pea cutlet called vegetable chop  to the menu of his restaurant, Masalawala, on Manhattans Lower East Side.  No one would buy it, Mazumdar said. I remember the batches that would go bad, and after two weeks, we were like, Why are we wasting? We might as well do chicken tikka masala.   When he and chef Chintan Pandya opened Rahi in Greenwich Village in 2017, Mazumdar thought they needed to go contemporary, serving truffle khichdi and smoked salmon chaat. The place was less about showcasing Indian food and more about following culinary trends, Mazumdar said.  But with the openings of Adda in Long Island City in 2018 and Dhamaka on the Lower East Side in February, the partners stopped trying to adhere to an existing narrative, and started writing their own. They put Indias bold, regional flavors front and center, rather than hiding them behind truffles or tikka masala.  A number of restaurants, like Ghee Indian Kitchen in Miami and Besharam in San Francisco, have won followings for their focus on regional Indian cuisine. But few have done so at the scale that Mazumdar and Pandya are aspiring toward.  Chintan Pandya in the kitchen of Rahi in New York, Feb. 24, 2018. (Source: Casey Kelbaugh/The New York Times) Chintan Pandya in the kitchen of Rahi in New York, Feb. 24, 2018. (Source: Casey Kelbaugh/The New York Times)  From the aromatic Lucknow-style goat neck biryani at Adda, to the fiery, pork-and-herb-laden Meghalayan doh khleh at Dhamaka, the food at these restaurants speak in exclamation marks. Both places earned glowing reviews from critics, and Pandya received a James Beard award nomination in 2020.  As the country opens back up, Mazumdar, 38, and Pandya, 41, are planning an aggressive expansion in New York this year. It will include two fast-casual restaurants in the East Village, Kebabwala and Rowdy Rooster; a new location and menu for Masalawala; and a reimagined Rahi, inspired by incoming chef Vijay Kumars South Indian heritage. Adda will also move to a larger location about a mile away and plans to get its liquor license.  The partners ultimate goal is to expand well beyond New York.  Until we really reach the heart of the country, Mazumdar said, I dont think we can really move Indian cuisine forward.  But opening an Indian restaurant is complicated. Americans expect to pay less for tandoori paneer than they would a burrata salad, and to dictate the level of spiciness, said Pandya.  Have you gone to your home and asked your mother, Can you make a chicken, on a scale of 1 to 10 spice level, a 5?  he said.  We are stopping this idea of catering to every other person but the Indian palate, added Mazumdar.  Pandya has long wanted to start a fast-casual Indian restaurant with a national reach, and is inspired by the popular New York taqueria, Los Tacos No. 1. (Curry Up Now is a successful Indian street food restaurant with locations across the country.)  Dhamaka, which opened in February, in New York, May 5, 2021. (Source: Emon Hassan/The New York Times) Dhamaka, which opened in February, in New York, May 5, 2021. (Source: Emon Hassan/The New York Times)  It is a phenomenal product, he said of Los Tacos No. 1.  The first of the teams fast-casual restaurants, the fried chicken-centric Rowdy Rooster, opens in August on First Avenue and Ninth Street. Pandya is studying the numerous Indian iterations of fried chicken, from pakoras to Chicken 65, a spicy snack that supposedly originated in a hotel in Chennai. A month later comes Kebabwala, on Second Avenue and Fifth Street, which will focus on classic kebab preparations like chicken tikka and seekh kebabs.  At Rahi, Kumar, 39, who was recently the chef of Rasa in Burlingame, California, will introduce a menu of regional southern Indian food in September. He grew up in Natham, a village in Tamil Nadu, with dishes like maan kari, venison with coconut, curry leaf, coriander, cumin and star anise; and blood poriyal, made by cooking nutrient-rich goat blood with turmeric, cumin, lentils and coconut. He said he wants to show diners that southern Indian food is more than just dosa and idli.  Opening in November, the revamped Masalawala in Park Slope, Brooklyn, on the corner of Fifth Avenue and Fifth Street, will venture into retail, selling staples like basmati and atta, along with spice blends and sauces. It will also offer an all-day menu of regional Indian comfort food like pigeon Chettinad seasoned with star anise and coriander, and patrani macchi, a Parsi dish of fish steamed in banana leaf.  There have been two very specific angles to Indian food in restaurants, Mazumdar said. One side has been this idea of higher-end cuisine, which automatically has to be with foreign ingredients, the other the generalization of Indian cuisine.  Building a deeper understanding of Indian food among all Americans wont happen with just one restaurant group, he said.  But perhaps they can make the path a little smoother for the next Indian restaurant.

2021-07-23,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/indian-fermented-rice-dishes-restaurants/article35405177.ece,"Masterchef Australia is late to the party. Indias fermented rice dishes, from Bengals panta bhat to Keralas pazhamkanji, have long been moving up the culinary ladder from farms to restaurants, as gourmets discover their many benefits  Panta bhat, trending after it was featured in Masterchef Australia by contestant Kishwar Chowdhury, is known by many names in India  poita bhat (Assamese), pakhala bhat (Odiya), pazhaya sadam (Tamil), geel bhat (Bihar), chaddannam (Telugu) and pazhamkanji (Malayalam). Call it what you will, but fermented rice is comfort food for many in India and in Southeast Asia. Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam have their own versions.  Author and academic Krishnendhu Ray, associate professor of Food Studies at New York University, says there are three reasons for the popularity of fermented food in general and rice in particular. One, the idea of a national cuisine is pass. We know that there are regional and sub-regional cuisines. Two, the 21st Century has seen the death of the taste for cold and sweet in the American century of taste. Realising the ill-effect of sodas and colas, people are going for tepid and sour foods. Three, studies have shown that gut health is closely related to the immune system, health, and mental health. Earlier, the ambition was to boil and cook everything to kill all microbes. But now, we know that certain microbes are necessary for our health. Fermented food is rich in microbes, yeast, and mould, all necessary for our health.  Pazhamkanji | Photo Credit: S Mahinsha  Krishnendu says that, like music and textiles, tastes in food can also travel from the subaltern to the mainstream and he attributes the popularity of fermented rice gruel to that movement.  Fermented rice gruel, he says, has existed for centuries in one form or the other in every place where rice is grown, especially in the era before refrigeration. But it was the food of the common man, not of royalty. That was one of the reasons why it was not served in restaurants. Now, fermented food has caught the attention of gourmets but we have to wait and see if it is a fad and how long it lasts, says Krishnendu.  Fermented for fine dining  As the locavore movement gains in strength, regional staples like fermented rice finds a place in the sun  and in upscale restaurants around India. Regi Mathew, chef and culinary director of Chennai-based Kappa Chakka Kandhari, has been serving pazhamkanji and cherupayar kanji in his restaurant since 2018. Diners were pleasantly surprised when they saw it on the menu for lunch. Unless we serve these ethnic foods, they will vanish from our plates. Nutritious and packed with probiotics, pazhamkanji used to be a staple in households in Kerala, says Regi. He speaks nostalgically of sharing the pazhamkanji that farm labourers working their land in Kottayam used to bring for lunch. Pazhamkanji reminds me of vacations, home and childhood, he adds.  Agreeing with his sentiments, chef Suresh Pillai, culinary director of Raviz Hotels, gushes about pazhamkanji. Although it is not on the formal menu of Raviz, he says there are many expatriates who ask for it. We prepare it for them. Cooked rice is soaked overnight in water with shallots and birds eye chilli. In the morning, it is served with chutney, pickle, fish curry or fish fry (sun-dried fish fry), curd, pappadam and, occasionally, kappa (tapioca), he says.  The sides served with the fermented rice vary from place to place. Even the number of hours it is soaked can vary. When it is soaked for more than 48 hours, the cooked rice releases a small amount of alcohol, which has a kick.  According to Regi, pazhamkanji has a cooling effect on the body and that is why farm labourers used to prefer it to cooked rice.  Pazhamkanji with fish fry and fish curry | Photo Credit: Sreejith R Kumar  Combined with a variety of sides, pazhamkanji is also now offered by small dedicated eateries, where it is often the only dish on the menu. Moopilans, perhaps the first in Thiruvananthapuram to serve only pazhamkanji, began five years ago. For three-four months, there were queues at our place. Seeing its popularity, other joints also began serving it, says Vijayakumari V, who has reopened her small eatery after the lockdown. Now, only parcels are being given.  In Orissa and West Bengal, it is usually served with potato and fried fish. Regi says that in Kerala, the fish curry served it with the pazhamkanji was also usually the previous days fish curry. Our older generation never wasted food. Pazhamkanji was a way of making the best of the what was in the house when there were no refrigerators. Soaking the rice overnight broke down the micro-nutrients in the rice, making it easily digestible, says Regi.  In Malayalam, kanji is often used as a derogatory term to refer to someone who is not quick-witted or in with the times. From the looks of it, this will soon have to be changed to keep with the times as kanji takes centre-stage in the culinary world.",‘Poita bhat’ or ‘pazhamkanji’: India’s fermented rice finds its place under the sun,POTATO

Scientists from the University of Chicago, Peking University and Guizhou University in a report said that adding a gene encoding for a protein called FTO to both rice and potato plants increased their yield by 50 per cent in field tests.

Whats more, it worked with almost every type of plant we tried it with so far, and its a very simple modification to make, said University of Chicago Prof Chuan He, who together with Prof Guifang Jia at Peking University led the research. This really provides the possibility of engineering plants to potentially improve the ecosystem as global warming proceeds.  This is a brand new type of approach, one that could be different from GMO and CRISPR gene editing; this technique allows us to flip a switch in the plants at an early point in development, which continues to affect the plants food production even after we remove the switch, he said. It seems that plants already have this layer of regulation, and all we did is tap into it. So the next step would be to discover how to do it using the plants existing genetics.

He is a professor at the University of Chicago.  Even beyond food, there are other consequences of climate change, said Prof Chuan He. Perhaps we could engineer grasses in threatened areas that can withstand drought.

2021-08-02,https://indianexpress.com/article/lifestyle/health/effective-dietary-rules-control-blood-glucose-diabetes-7425205/,"The goal of medical nutrition therapy in type 2 diabetes mellitus is to regulate the amount of carbohydrate, cholesterol and salt consumption to help optimise glycemic control, lipid (cholesterol) and blood pressure control. Lifestyle intervention can only do as much and patients always require effective medical therapies to optimise risk factor control in diabetes, said Dr Vishal Gupta, director of VG-Advantage diabetes thyroid and endocrine Centre, Mumbai, and consultant endocrinologist at Breach Candy Hospital and Research Centre, Mumbai.  Monitor daily calorie intake  For the normal weighted diabetic with BMI 18-23kg/m2, the aim is to maintain the body weight by consulting an average of 1,2001,500 kcal per day for women, and 1,5001,800 kcal for men. In order to lose weight, one must consume a 500750 kcal/day energy deficit dietary plan, said Dr Gupta, who is also the author of Beyond Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.  Monitor daily carbohydrate consumption  Focus on the intake of carbohydrates from vegetables, legumes, fruits, dairy products, and whole grains. Strongly discourage the diabetic patient or minimise the consumption of refined carbohydrates such as white flour, white rice, low-fat or non-fat food products with high amounts of refined grains, table sugar and sugar-sweetened beverages like soft drinks, he mentioned.  The WHO recommends that sugar intake be reduced to 5 per cent of the total calorie intake which is 25 grams of sugar per day for an average-sized person. It is seen that the average adult in India consumes approximately 58 grams of sugar daily.  Also Read | How many servings of fruits a day can lower risk of type 2 diabetes?  Effective rules to help control blood glucose in diabetes. (Source:Pixabay) Effective rules to help control blood glucose in diabetes. (Source:Pixabay)  Monitor the quality of carbohydrate consumed  Glycemic index (GI) refers to the quantitative assessment of the post-meal blood glucose response of certain foods, which is expressed as a percentage. So higher the glycemic index, greater is its ability to raise the patients blood glucose.  Foods with a GI score over 70 are referred to as high glycemic, which is fast release of carbohydrate and higher post-meal blood glucose response. Foods with a GI score of 55 or less are referred to as low glycemic which help in slow release of carbohydrate and lower post-meal blood response. For example, white rice has a GI close to 93 as do commonly consumed biscuits versus brown rice which has a GI of 50.  Also Read | Longstanding uncontrolled diabetes can be a major cause of reduced memory: Mayo Clinic expert  Monitor the quality of carbohydrates consumed. (source: Pixabay) Monitor the quality of carbohydrates consumed. (source: Pixabay)  Consume carbohydrate along with fibre and protein  Dietary fibers can be described as any non-digestible carbohydrates that cannot be broken down in the upper food tract, thus helping reduce the GI of foods.  For examples, soluble dietary fibre in fruits, berries, certain vegetables i.e., pectins from guava, carrots; beans, lentils; nuts; germ fraction from oat and barley products, and psyllium. Insoluble dietary fibre include whole grain and bran products; skins of fruit; cucumbers, tomatoes; hull of grains; brown rice; legumes; nuts, almonds. High dietary fibre intake has shown to result in a 2030 per cent decrease in future risk of type 2 diabetes and lower the post-meal glucose excursion, said Dr Gupta.  Protein ingestion has appeared to stimulate insulin secretion and cause a decrease in post-meal glycemic response. When dietary protein (e.g. leucine) is ingested along with glucose, it helps in reducing the post-meal glycemic response by 50 per cent.  Similarly, the co-ingestion of soya protein along with rice has shown to reduce the post-meal blood glucose response. With regards to protein intake in diabetic patients without diabetic kidney, the average daily protein intake can be up to 11.5 gm/kg bodyweight per day or 1520 per cent of the total calories. Whereas, for those with diabetic kidney disease, the aim should be to restrict the daily allowance of protein to 0.8 gm/kg bodyweight per day.  Also Read | Healthy lifestyle: Five yoga asanas that can help diabetes patients  Monitor the method of cooking  Dr Gupta explained that potatoes generally have one of the highest GI values of any food. Baking a potato may offer an advantage over boiling as it involves less cooking of its internal part, thereby helping to reduce the digestibility of potato.  The average GI of canned potatoes is almost 36 per cent less as the preservation method that involves placing foods in jars or similar containers and heating them to a temperature that destroys microorganisms which spoils the food. Canning of starch-rich foods such as potatoes could decrease the GI. Cooling can also lower the GI of the food as it helps reform the crystalline structure of the carbohydrate known as Retrogradation thereby reducing the GI, he said.  For example, pasta cooked hot and fresh has a high GI but upon refrigeration or cooling and consuming the next day, the GI reduces substantially. Cooking Indian basmati rice in a microwave oven compared to a rice cooker lowered the GI by 20.4 per cent, he mentioned.  However, the problem that remains despite all these different cooking methods is the absolute increased carbohydrate consumed by the average Indian diabetic.  Efforts must be taken to improve health-related outcomes, especially in India, and from the evidence it is clear, that by limiting both total carbohydrate intake and foods with high GI, not only weight but also all indices of metabolic health can be improved, he stressed.

2021-08-04,https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/ludhiana/mission-punjab-in-bhagat-singhs-village-chaduni-urges-farmers-to-contest-polls-will-have-more-than-enough-votes-to-win-7437980/,"BHARTIYA KISAN Union (BKU) Haryana chief Gurnam Singh Chaduni, under his Mission Punjab, launched to motivate farm unions and farmer leaders to contest state Assembly elections in 2022, reached Garhshankar area of Hoshiarpur district Tuesday, following which he also visited Khatkar Kalan, the ancestral village of Bhagat Singh and met office bearers of truck unions.  He appealed to farmers to contest elections, vote for themselves and bring a model that will be replicated across the country. He said Punjabs farmer-related votes are more than double what is needed to win an election.  In Garhshankar, he was invited by former Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) state president Rachhpal Singh Raju, who was recently expelled by BSP over his objections to the seat-sharing formula of the SAD-BSP alliance.  He was welcomed by a large number of locals including Dalits, farmers, and farm labourers.  Chaduni, who was suspended for a week by the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) over his Mission Punjab statements, has not stopped his journey under this vision. He said: Punjab is number one in every field, be it the freedom struggle of the country or the ongoing farmers protest at the Delhi border where 500 farmers/farm labourers out of total 600 who had died in last eight months are from Punjab. Punjab is number one in filling the granary of the country in Green and White revolutions, then why cant Punjab be number one in launching Mission Punjab movement which will pave the way for the Mission India movement to save this countrys poor from the cultures of political leaders?  The farmer leader was welcomed with slogans like Chaduni ji tum sangharsh karo hum tumhare saath hain (You carry on this struggle, we are with you).  If we see the history of Punjab, majority people from here are connected to agriculture only and now its the duty of the state to change the history/system to save the lives of lakhs of farmers as in the past 20 years, 3-4 lakh farmers and farm labourers have died by suicide due to debts and poor incomes, he said, while addressing the gathering.  The debt on farmers of the country is nearly Rs 7-8 lakh crore while the corporates debt is double, around Rs 15 lakh crore, but not a single capitalist or corporate had died by suicide while 30-35 farmers and farm labourers are taking their own lives in the country daily, he added.  If we see this years record, 3 per cent of peoples (the rich of this country) income has gone up and 97 per cent people have witnessed a downfall. So what is the solution to this? This farmers protest is not only a struggle against three farm laws, which should be called agri trade laws, or only a struggle of farmers, it is peoples protest now because these corporates are purchasing apple, onion, potato at the rate of Rs 25/kg, 8/kg and Rs 5/kg, respectively, from farmers and selling to the people at the rate of Rs 250 per kg, Rs 80/kg and Rs 40/kg, respectively. Still there are 20 crore people in our country who do not get two meals, Chaduni further said.  Agro business laws (three farm laws) will loot every section of society and now it is our duty to snatch this power from these leaders and become our own master by contesting elections. These leaders have looted us and deposited money in foreign banksTell me 600 people have already died at Delhi border, they are sitting under the sky in 2 degrees and 45 degrees temperature. Where is the government? Who has come to see them, the farm leader asked.  Our condition was bad before these laws too which are death warrants for us and even if we got these cancelled we are still on the ventilator because we are still dependent on them for every little thing, he said, adding, Political power is the game of votes, why we are giving our votes to them, why cant we give it to ourselves?  The farmer leader claimed that farmers and farm-related sections make up nearly 80-90 lakh votes. When we are the owners of this many votes, which is more than sufficient to win an election, why have we (farmers) become beggars and asking them to change policy for us? Why can we not contest under Mission Punjab and win the elections? he asked.  Mission Punjab is just the beginning, we need Mission India soon. Under Mission Punjab, we just need 117 honest leaders to win this power game for the good of this society where poor can have food, education and health facilities, said Chaduni.","‘Mission Punjab’: In Bhagat Singh’s village, Chaduni urges farmers to contest polls: ‘Will have more than enough votes to win’",POTATO
2021-08-05,https://indianexpress.com/article/world/inside-lebanons-worst-economic-meltdown-in-more-than-a-century-7439611/,"Rania Mustafas living room recalls a not-so-distant past, when the modest salary of a security guard in Lebanon could buy an air conditioner, plush furniture and a flat-screen TV.  But as the countrys economic crisis worsened, she lost her job and watched her savings evaporate. Now she plans to sell her furniture to pay the rent and struggles to afford food, much less electricity or a dentist to fix her 10-year-old daughters broken molar.  For dinner on a recent night, lit by a single cellphone, the family shared thin potato sandwiches donated by a neighbor. The girl chewed gingerly on one side of her mouth to avoid her damaged tooth.  I have no idea how well continue, said Mustafa, 40, at home in Tripoli, Lebanons second-largest city after Beirut.  Lebanon, a small Mediterranean country still haunted by a 15-year civil war that ended in 1990, is in the throes of a financial collapse that the World Bank has said could rank among the worlds worst since the mid-1800s. It is closing like a vise on families whose money has plummeted in value while the cost of nearly everything has skyrocketed.  Since fall 2019, the Lebanese pound has lost 90% of its value, and annual inflation in 2020 was 84.9%. As of June, prices of consumer goods had nearly quadrupled in the previous two years, according to government statistics. The huge explosion one year ago in the port of Beirut, which killed more than 200 people and left a large swath of the capital in shambles, only added to the desperation.  On Wednesday, Lebanon observed a day of mourning to mark the anniversary of the blast, and government offices and most businesses were closed for the occasion. Large crowds gathered around Beirut to commemorate the day and denounce their government, which has failed to determine what caused the explosion and who was responsible, much less to hold anyone accountable.  After a moment of silence on the highway overlooking the port, thousands of protesters marched toward downtown, where some fired fireworks and threw stones near the Parliament at security forces, who responded with volleys of tear gas.  The blast exacerbated the countrys economic crisis, which was long in the making, and there is little relief in sight.  Mourners march in Beirut, Lebanon on Wednesday, Aug. 4, 2021, to commemorate the one-year anniversary of the catastrophic port explosion in Beirut that killed more than 200 people.(Diego Ibarra Sanchez/The New York Times) Mourners march in Beirut, Lebanon on Wednesday, Aug. 4, 2021, to commemorate the one-year anniversary of the catastrophic port explosion in Beirut that killed more than 200 people.(Diego Ibarra Sanchez/The New York Times)  Years of corruption and bad policies have left the state deeply in debt and the central bank unable to keep propping up the currency, as it had for decades, because of a drop in foreign cash flows into the country. Now the bottom has fallen out of the economy, leaving shortages of food, fuel and medicine.  All but the wealthiest Lebanese have cut meat from their diets and wait in long lines to fuel their cars, sweating through sweltering summer nights because of extended power cuts.  The country has long endured electricity shortages, a legacy of a state that has failed to ensure basic services. To cover the gaps left by the state power supply, residents rely on privately owned, diesel-powered generators.  But the currency collapse has undermined that patchwork system.  As imported fuel has gotten more expensive, power cuts from the grid have stretched from a few hours a day to as long as 23 hours. So demand for power from generators has risen, along with the cost of the fuel to run them.  The resulting price hike has turned a utility essential for business, health and comfort into a luxury that many families can afford only in limited quantities, if at all.  Mustafa Nabo, from Syria, used to work long days on his electric sewing machine, powered by the grid and supplemental power from a generator.  Now the price for generated power is nearly 10 times what it was before the crisis began, so he rushes to work as much as he can during the two hours he gets power from the grid. But less work means less money, and he has cut back on food.  It is better to bring food than to pay for electricity, Nabo said.  Across Lebanon, the fuel shortages have led to long lines at gas stations, where drivers wait for hours to buy only a few gallons or none at all if the station runs out.  The supply of medicines has also become unreliable. The state is supposed to subsidize imports, but the crisis has strained that system, too.  Mustafa Nabo, a tailor who fled the Syrian civil war, sits in a darkened apartment in Beirut, July 7, 2021. Nabo used to work long days on his electric sewing machine here, but now must rush to work as much as he can during the two hours he gets power from Lebanons electrical grid.

Nabo used to work long days on his electric sewing machine here, but now must rush to work as much as he can during the two hours he gets power from Lebanons electrical grid. (Bryan Denton/The New York Times)  At a pharmacy in Tripoli, a line stretched from the sidewalk to the cash register, where anxious shoppers sought medicines that are now scarce after long being easy to obtain, such as painkillers and blood pressure medications. Other products had disappeared altogether, such as drugs to treat depression.  One shopper, Wafa Khaled, cursed the government after failing to find insulin for her mother and paying five times as much as she would have two years ago for baby food and seven times as much for formula.  The best thing for us would be for some foreign country to come occupy us so we could have electricity, water and security, she said.  The crisis could do lasting damage to three sectors that have historically made Lebanon stand out in the Arab world.  In a country once billed as the Switzerland of the Middle East, the banks are largely insolvent. Education has suffered a blow as teachers and professors seek better opportunities abroad. And health care has deteriorated as reduced salaries have caused an exodus of doctors and nurses.  The emergency ward at the American University of Beirut Medical Center, among the countrys best, has gone to seven physicians, from 12, and lost more than half of its 65 nurses since July 2020, said Eveline Hitti, the head of the department.  They were driven out by waves of COVID-19, declining salaries and the explosion in the Beirut port last year, which flooded the ward with casualties.  You ask yourself, why should I survive this? said Rima Jabbour, the head nurse.  Now COVID cases are increasing, as are food poisonings caused by poor refrigeration and alcohol overdoses.  The countrys political leaders have failed to slow the economic meltdown.  Officials have hampered the investigation into the port explosion, and a billionaire telecoms tycoon, Najib Mikati, is currently the third politician to try to form a government since the last Cabinet resigned after the blast.  Residents wait for meals at a charity kitchen in Tripoli, Lebanon, July 9, 2021. Amid a financial collapse that could rank among the worlds worst since the mid-1800s is closing like a vise on Lebanons middle class. (Bryan Denton/The New York Times) Residents wait for meals at a charity kitchen in Tripoli, Lebanon, July 9, 2021. Amid a financial collapse that could rank among the worlds worst since the mid-1800s is closing like a vise on Lebanons middle class. (Bryan Denton/The New York Times)  Mustafa Allouch, the deputy head of the Future Movement, a prominent political party, said, like many other Lebanese, that he feared that the political system, intended to share power between a range of sects, was incapable of addressing the countrys problems.  I dont think it will work anymore, he said. We have to look for another system, but I dont know what it is.  His greatest fear was blind violence born out of desperation and rage.  Looting, shooting, assaults on homes and small shops, he said. Why it hasnt happened by now, I dont know.  The crisis has hit the poor hardest.  Five days a week, scores of people line up for free meals from a charity kitchen in Tripoli, some equipped with cut-off shampoo bottles to carry their food because they cannot afford regular containers.  Robert Ayoub, the projects head, said demand is going up, donations from inside Lebanon are going down and the newcomers represent a new kind of poor: soldiers, bank employees and civil servants whose salaries have lost the bulk of their value.  In line on a recent day were a laborer who had walked an hour from home because he could not afford transportation; a brick layer whose work had dried up; and Dunia Shehadeh, an unemployed housekeeper who picked up a tub of pasta and lentil soup for her husband and three children.  This will hardly be enough for them, she said.  The countrys downward spiral has set off a new wave of migration as Lebanese with foreign passports and marketable skills seek better fortune abroad.  I cant live in this place, and I dont want to live in this place, said Layal Azzam, 39, before catching a flight to Saudi Arabia from Beiruts international airport.  She and her husband had returned to Lebanon from abroad a few years ago and invested $50,000 in a business. But she said that it had failed and that she worried they would struggle to find care if their children got sick.  Theres no electricity. They could cut the water. Prices are high. Even if someone sends you money from abroad, it doesnt last, she said. There are too many crises.",Inside Lebanon’s worst economic meltdown in more than a century,POTATO
2021-08-06,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/prateek-sadhu-of-masque-distilling-india-on-a-plate/article35766620.ece,"The countrys most experimental chef is hitting the road, to celebrate Mumbais Masque turning five and to share his ingredients-first approach with pop-ups in five cities  It is a dark and stormy night. Traffic on Delhis pot-holed roads has been crawling for hours. In the quiet, tree-lined neighbourhood of Friends Colony, however, 35-odd diners at boutique hotel The Manor are getting ready for a treat: a 10-course menu featuring some of the bravest, most avant garde Indian cooking yet.  Inside, chef Prateek Sadhu, 34, is readying to roll it all out. This is the first day of a three-day pop-up of Masque, his Mumbai restaurant. Tickets sold out within 48 hours of announcement. Pop-ups in four other cities are to follow  Bengaluru, Chennai, Kolkata and Leh, where Sadhu will keep adding elements to the dishes, building newer ones as he finds inspiration in local cuisines and ingredients.  Also read | Indias new spice merchants  Unique and universal  Before the pandemic hit, Sadhu had been doing precisely this at Masque  a restaurant sans a menu, where guests are encouraged to sit inside a lab and experience how he puts together thoughts and flavours after trips to different regions and farms across the country. The restaurant, which turns five this September, recently made it to number 32 on Asias 50 Best Restaurants list of 2021  the only Indian entry apart from Indian Accent in New Delhi (at number 18).  The Masque team touches down in Delhi | Photo Credit: @masquerestaurant  But this is the first time that many gourmands in other Indian cities are getting to experience Sadhus distinctive cooking because even within our competitive, growing restaurantscape, Masque is more niche than popular, more experimental than mass. Which is a shame because it is perhaps the only one in the country that prizes pure experimentation over commerce. If Masque was cinema, it would have been Satyajit Rays.  Like art house cinema, there is both the unique and the universal in Sadhus oeuvre. Take, for example, some of his dishes from the Delhi pop-up: course one was Carrot kanji, bhekti  brined and cured fish, pickled Kashmiri cherry, pickled lime, gongura greens, aam papad, and carrot kanji. Sour is perhaps the least accepted of tastes with the Indian palate. But Sadhu pushes that boundary with this study in sour. Fermented traditions from across India have been layered  northern Indian kanji, eastern aam papad, southern gongura, the pickled lime of the numerous pan-Indian achars, and the elusive Kashmiri cherry.  In course two, Sadhu puts out Corn pani puri, kalari kulcha, ghevar and chok charwan with tomato rasam. What could be the thread of thought running through his mind while putting together such disparate regional influences? A study in textures: of crusts and breads from several Indian regions. The Marwari pure veg ghevar serves as a base for Kashmiri lamb liver, startling purists, but look closely and youll find a redefining of the idea of Indian bread.  Part of the menu at the Delhi pop-up | Photo Credit: Special arrangement  Food that doesnt pander  Sadhu seems to use his individual experiences  his Kashmiri roots, travels, and the innate internationalism that comes from his stints at top global restaurants such as Alinea, Le Bernardin and Noma  as the lens to look at more universal Indian culinary traditions. Kashmiri lamb neck yakhni meets morels miso in what turns out to be his most popular dish that evening; rogan josh sausage and katlam, the Jammu bread, masquerade with NYC casual-chic; and Pondicherry chocolate gets combined with indigenous central Indian flower liqueur mahua that not many urban Indians have tasted before.  Also read | Sadhu and Krugs onion chronicles  In a way what he does is the opposite of what I do because I do not mix different regional cuisines, chef Manish Mehrotra, one of Sadhus guests that evening, who came with his teenage daughter Adah, tells The Hindu Weekend. Mehrotra, widely regarded as the father of modern Indian cuisine, whose signature Indian Accent dishes continue to be copied and regurgitated by chefs in even small towns, finds Sadhus voice to be among the most unique in Indian kitchens. He mixes cuisines and is not afraid to experiment even if diners here do not accept certain tastes or the importance of things like acidity, something that all Michelin-level dining pays attention to internationally, he points out.  The five-year plan Influenced by zero wastage, techniques like fermentation, and local ingredients sourced directly from farms, the philosophy behind Masque has remained the same since it launched. Even as Sadhu sharpened his focus to researching diverse subregional cuisines. So what is his ambition in the next five years? It is always to survive, he says candidly, about the difficulty of balancing commercial success with cutting-edge experimentation. The pandemic has made this tougher. The next few years will definitely have to be about healing from our current difficult scenario. But, personally, my ambition is to dig deeper into Indian cuisines. I feel I have only scratched the surface. I want to look at home recipes, bring them into the restaurant after R&D, understand different regions and subregions, castes and sub-castes, and how food has changed so many things in the country, he says.  Sadhus signature style is neither purist nor populist, and it is definitely not derivative. In fact, his individualistic experimentation is one of the ways forward for modern Indian food. ITCs Manisha Bhasin concurs. There are two schools of thought when it comes to Indian food, one is purist and other is inventive. But what I like about Prateeks food is that it is not about presentations; the food talks to me, there is a purity in that, says Bhasin. ITC hotels will be the venues for Sadhus pop-ups in Chennai, Kolkata and Bengaluru.  Younger chefs like Dhruv Oberoi of Olive, who was also a guest at the pop-up, add that this is perhaps the boldest experimentation in Indian gastronomy yet  with a sense of internationalism in the dishes. While a few of the courses like the lamb yakhni were comfort, there were bold combinations like chocolate and mahua that I had never experienced before, says Oberoi.  Chefs Dhruv Oberoi, Manisha Bhasin and Manish Mehrotra  What is authentic?  I remember the first meal I had at Masque, in the first week of its opening in Mumbai in 2016 in a mill compound that had fallen into disuse. There was Himalayan rye bread and sea buckthorn berries from Leh, there were textures of potato using techniques like dehydration, cooking in an earthen pit, and sous vide, there was olive oil specially pressed from Rajasthan. The whole approach was described as botanical bistronomy  what appeared to be a mix of international styles of cooking using carefully-sourced (and often unheard of) regional ingredients. Over the last five years, that focus has sharpened.  Koji-cured barramundi, carrot & passion fruit kanji  Sadhu now uses Indian ingredients as well as cooking styles and techniques and refashions them. But the sense of internationalism still binds all these. Does he see his food as Indian? Indian food as we know it today is a result of constant evolution. What is authentic? Is my mothers rogan josh more authentic than what my aunt cooks? Authentic is subjective; food is the result of migration and is constantly evolving. So while tradition is important, innovation is critical, he says. His Indian food, he points out, is not about returning to regional recipes and simply plating them with new tweaks. It demands revisiting ingredients in altogether new ways that can build cross-cultural bridges, he adds.  As you eat a bhetki with clam rogan with a puri flavoured with Goan sausage, thinking cross-cultural bridges is inevitable. The pop-up menu will continue to evolve over all its stops  much like the journey of food itself.  The upcoming pop-ups will be priced 5,500 plus taxes. Bengaluru on August 20-21 and Chennai on August 27-28.  Chef Sadhu and his team  Hat tip  Sadhus innovative cooking and internationalism (that comes from study at the Culinary Institute of America plus work at top global restaurants) have been winning him recognition ever since Masque launched. In its first year, it was ranked among the top 10 on Food Tanks 2016 list of restaurant innovators in the world. In 2020, the restaurant received the Miele One To Watch award in Asias 50 Best Restaurants list before debuting this year on the main list. Sadhu has been the first Indian chef to be a brand ambassador for Champagne brand Krug and, more recently, he contributed a simple but inventive beets with peach chunda recipe for the #Amexforfoodies cookbook featuring recipes by top global chefs. Before the pandemic, Masque had also been collaborating with leading chefs across the world to host pop-ups, including with Matt Orlando who helms Copenhagens Amass, in 2017.",Prateek Sadhu of Masque: distilling India on a plate,POTATO
2021-08-07,https://indianexpress.com/article/lifestyle/health/migraine-eat-more-fish-7443030/,"Written by Anahad OConnor  A diet high in omega-3s, the fats found in fish, and low in omega-6s, found in many vegetable oils, led to fewer headaches.  For most of her life, Tanya Kamka suffered migraine headaches on a weekly basis.  The headaches would usually come on gradually and then build, causing excruciating pain and pressure behind her left eye that would culminate in her vomiting or visiting the emergency room. The ordeal would often leave her feeling weak and exhausted for days afterward.  Anytime I had a migraine Id be wiped out for three or four days, said Ms. Kamka, 58, a post office clerk who lives near Fort Bragg, N.C. I missed a lot of work because of migraines.  But a few years ago, Ms. Kamka and 181 other people who routinely experience migraine headaches joined a clinical trial, sponsored by the National Institutes of Health, which was designed to test whether a special diet could alleviate their frequent headaches. The diet that Ms. Kamka was assigned to follow emphasized foods that contain large amounts of omega-3 fatty acids, the oils found in some fish, while limiting foods that are rich sources of omega-6 fatty acids, such as many vegetable oils.  Omega-3s and omega-6s are both considered essential fatty acids  critical for health, and because our bodies cant make them, they must be obtained from foods. Historically humans consumed roughly equivalent amounts of both fatty acids. But the typical American diet today tends to contain a much larger proportion of omega-6 fats. Some health authorities see this as a good thing: Vegetable oils and other rich sources of omega-6 fats have been found in many studies to be beneficial for cardiovascular health. But others argue that this could be problematic because omega-6 fats have been shown to promote pain and inflammation, while omega-3 fats tend to have the opposite effect in studies, helping to reduce pain and inflammation.  The authors of the new study wanted to know: Could a diet that boosts omega-3 fats while lowering omega-6 fats make life easier for people burdened by frequent migraine headaches?  For Ms. Kamka, the benefits of a change in diet were striking: After a few months of increasing her fish intake and avoiding many common vegetable oils, she noticed that her headaches had all but disappeared. Other people on the new diet also reported fewer headaches. Although the trial ended after 16 weeks, Ms. Kamka has remained on it ever since. Gone are the days when she ate foods like fried chicken, French fries and potato chips that were cooked in vegetables oils rich in omega-6 fats. She now makes a point of eating foods like cod, tuna, sardines, spinach salads, hummus and avocados, and she cooks with olive oil instead of corn, soybean and canola oils.  ALSO READ | Suffering from migraine? These food items may help reduce the throbbing headache  I havent had a migraine, not even a mild one, in over two years, she said. Going from having one a week to not having any was just amazing to me.  Migraine headaches are one of the most common causes of chronic pain, affecting about 12 percent of all Americans, most of them women. For many people, the condition can be debilitating, causing intense pain, nausea and other symptoms and sharply increasing the likelihood of developing depression and anxiety. Studies have found that migraine attacks can take a toll on workplace productivity, too, causing people to lose, on average, about four work days per year.  But the new study provides evidence that the right diet could provide relief to some people who experience frequent migraine attacks, helping them reduce the number and severity of their headaches. Similar studies are underway to assess whether dietary changes could help ease other kinds of painful chronic ailments, such as low back pain.  Dr. Christopher E. Ramsden, the lead author of the study, said the findings suggest that dietary changes could be a useful complement to existing treatments for chronic pain. Many people with chronic pain continue to suffer despite taking medication, said Dr. Ramsden, a clinical investigator in the National Institute on Aging Intramural Research Program. I think this is something that could be integrated with other treatments to enhance their quality of life and reduce their pain.  For the new trial, published in the BMJ in July, participants were randomly split into three groups and followed for 16 weeks. One group, which included Ms. Kamka, followed a diet that was high in omega-3 fats and relatively low in omega-6 fats: They ate plenty of foods like wild salmon, albacore tuna and trout, while trying to minimize rich sources of omega-6 fats such as corn, soybean and canola oils. To make it easier to follow the diet, all of the subjects were given meals, snacks and recipes prepared by a dietitian throughout the course of the study.  Vegetable oils high in omega-6s are abundant in the American diet. They are often used for cooking and found in many packaged foods and restaurant meals. To see whether reducing these fats could have an impact on migraine headaches, the researchers had a second group of people add more fish and other rich sources of omega-3s to their diets without decreasing their intake of omega-6s. A third group of people, serving as controls, consumed typical amounts of both types of fats.  At the start of the study, the participants experienced, on average, about 16 headache days per month. But after 16 weeks, the group that had increased their fish intake and avoided vegetable oils had an average of four fewer headache days each month compared to the control group, as well as a 30 to 40 percent reduction in headache hours each day. The group that increased their omega-3 intake without reducing their omega-6 consumption benefited as well, though they had a smaller improvement of two fewer days without headaches each month. Both of these groups reported shorter and less severe headaches than people in the control group. They also used fewer pain relievers like acetaminophen.  The researchers also noticed differences in important blood biomarkers. The two groups that increased their fish intake had greater levels of compounds known as oxylipins, which are involved in soothing pain. They had particularly high levels of 17-HDHA, an oxylipin that in other studies has been shown to reduce pain in people with arthritis.  ALSO READ | Health tips: Simple ways to manage migraine at work  Dr. Rebecca Burch, a neurologist who was not involved in the new study, said that the findings were striking. She wrote an editorial in the BMJ pointing out that recently approved migraine medications have been shown in studies to produce two to two and a half fewer headache days per month compared to placebo, which is less than the four-day reduction caused by the high omega-3, low omega-6 diet.  Four days per month really outperforms anything weve seen from a pharmacological preventive, said Dr. Burch, a headache medicine specialist at Brigham and Womens Hospital and an assistant professor of neurology at Harvard Medical School.  Dr. Burch said that people who struggle with migraine headaches are often motivated to follow restrictive diets to try to find some relief for their condition. But until now there has not been much evidence that any particular diet works. This is the first time that weve had a robust, solid diet that we can recommend to patients, she added.  For people who want to try the diet on their own, the researchers said that the simplest way to increase omega-3 intake is to eat more fatty fish, such as sardines, anchovies, mackerel, salmon, albacore tuna and trout. Some of the best and most affordable options are canned and pouched fish. For vegetarians, good plant sources of omega-3 fats are ground flaxseeds, chia seeds and walnuts.  Another important component of the diet is avoiding fried, processed and fast foods, which are typically made with oils that are low in omega-3s and high in omega-6s. Beth MacIntosh, a co-author of the new study, said that extra virgin olive oil, avocado oil, macadamia oil, coconut oil and butter tend to contain low amounts of omega-6 fats.  You can use these oils to cook meals or to make your own snack foods, like popcorn, hummus and granola. The researchers also encouraged people in the study to eat at least five servings of fruits and vegetables per day.  Fruits and vegetables are naturally low in omega-6 fatty acids  and theyre just healthy, said Ms. MacIntosh, the clinical nutrition manager of the Metabolic & Nutrition Research Core at UNC Health in Chapel Hill.",Why migraine sufferers may want to eat more fish,POTATO

We met at the hotel and became good friends. From there, we moved to the United States to work with Marriott Hotels on a cultural exchange programme, after which we started working in an Indian restaurant, gained some exposure, and then were finally able to open our own restaurant as we dreamed of, Sankar recollects.The duo ran a smaller restaurant but saw an opportunity to move to a bigger space and extend their brand when they opened the twin bistros in northern Virginia. The properties they found were perfect because they replaced two other Indian restaurants Bombay Curry Company in Del Ray and Delhi Club in Clarendon and there was no need to buy tandoor ovens which were already installed.Before the Covid-19 pandemic, Spice Kraft Indian Bistro, located in a family-friendly neighbourhood, was popular among mainstream customers and not just Indians. But the pandemic hit restaurants hard across America and exposed the vulnerability of Indian cuisine to flourish in the mainstream American culture.People tend to stay with comfort food during times like these. We are not only dependent on the Indian community to thrive in this situation, but simply just to survive, Sankar says. People like to eat out, but the pandemic has made them order delivery and curb side pick-up more than dine-in, he adds. Fortunately, we had adapted well to the technology before the pandemic itself - offering online ordering, partnering with a delivery service, etc.From the best samosas to braised lamb shank, these restaurants offer the entire range of Indian cuisine. And with vegetarianism becoming a fashionable option in the US, theres a lot on platter that attracts that segment of customers.We believe in accommodating vegans, vegetarians, and carnivores with an innovative restaurant menu that will make customers feel welcome. Many diehard non-vegetarians quickly replaced chicken tikka masala with its vegetarian counterparts like vegetable, tofu, or paneer tikka masala, says Chef Durairaj.Customers can even customise their own classic dish with a protein and sauce of their choice. Theres a dedicated menu section for vegans and gluten-free lovers.We have a moderate number of fusion dishes and mixed drinks such as chicken tikka burger with potato kuri kuri fries; quinoa kale kofta with turmeric coconut sauce; lamb shank rogan josh with south Indian potato mash; blueberry chutney martini and curry leaves and smoked cumin margarita, Chef Durairaj told us.Despite the US economy opening up after the pandemic, challenges remain. From workforce issues to Indian grocery supply chain and increase in product prices, we face many challenges. Fortunately, we didnt get hit by the pandemic as much as other restaurants, mainly due to effective management of our operating expenses and adapting to the changing situations, Sankar says.The two friends are now planning to install new branches of the restaurant at a couple of locations in Washington DC and Maryland.",Indian American restaurateurs cash in on craving for comfort food in bad times,POTATO

The youngster, who is also a vocalist and a guitarist, is a fan of the slow cooking technique which can only be mastered with a lot of time, patience and practice. His online business Smoke Culture by Steve is his vision to make the cooking style more common in Kochi. Smoked cooking was largely popular in India. With time we have switched to other mediums. However, western countries still eat a lot of smoked food and use it as a technique to enhance taste in many recipes, he says.  The 22-year-old single-handedly cooks Texas-style beef briskets, Kansas-style smoked chicken, Pulled pork, Neapolitan-inspired wood-fired pizza, and artisanal sausages. The smoked cuisines are notched up by Steves authentic sides like Coleslaw, Mac and Cheese, baked potato salad, British yellow cheddar and corn pudding. I experiment with flavours from around the globe. It is amusing to see how well some unexpected combinations work out. One of the most widely-accepted sauces is the Kochi city sauce, where Kanthari (Tabasco pepper) is blended with some foreign ingredients, he says.  Briskets  From the Barbeque and smoked meat menu, the most hyped dish is the Smoked Beef Brisket. Flavoured meat from the breast or lower chest of beef is cut out and cooked to form a brisket. Having a family-run meat business has turned out to be a boon for Steve. The taste and flavour of Briskets depend on the quality of meat. It is a huge task to pick the right quality of beef as it varies from place to place, says Steve.  According to Steve, the meat should be cooked at a low temperature for about 16 hours. At times, it can go up to even 20 hours. While it is being cooked red wine will also be added.Briskets will turn out stiff and chewy otherwise, so we adopt slow cooking. Through this method, the collagen tissue which firmly connects the meat will break and form gelatin, giving the meat a right tenderness, he adds.  The meat is kept in an offset smoker, where flavoured wood, preferably tamarind, imported apple, cherry-oak wood, mango, guava are used to enhance the briskets flavour. One has to spend most of the day in front of the machine to check if the meat is getting smoked properly. Steve claims he takes limited orders because it is tough to cook many briskets at a time. Even slicing is a meticulous process and if done wrongly, the meat can lose its texture.  Though the process is labour-intensive, the effort is worthwhile, Steve says. The smoky tender juicy briskets are seasoned with salt and pepper. The luscious dish is available in one pound and half-pound.  Instagram @smokeculturebysteve",Smells like a smokey spirit,POTATO

While reviewing the farming practice here on Friday, he instructed the officials to take help from national and international institutions to extend technological know-how to the farmers for better yield and income.  He emphasised research, knowledge-sharing and search for better varieties that are helpful for the food processing industry, which in turn would help the farmers get assured market. He asked the officials to ensure tomato and onion farmers are not distraught.  Further, the Chief Minister stressed cultivating coconut, banana, papaya, chilli, tomato, onion and sweet potato crops and focus on establishing food processing units in 25 parliamentary constituencies of the State.  The officials said the State tops in coconut, papaya and tomato cultivation and productivity and stated that they have taken up banana cultivation in the tissue culture process. In regard to food processing units, the officials said construction works would begin from October.  The CM said more attention should be paid towards chilli processing, with the cooperation of international organisations. Similarly, he also directed the authorities to ensure better prices are paid to the coconut farmers.  In this regard, he directed vice-chancellor of the horticulture university to conduct continuous research on coconut cultivation with the help of reputed organisations, focussing on the problems encountered. Jagan also suggested setting up a grievance cell at RBKs to clear doubts of the farmers by agriculture assistants.  He directed the authorities to monitor the grievances received and how they were addressed, while inspecting the RBKs. He said agriculture students must work for at least one month at RBKs, as it will give them an understanding of their performance and programmes.  Further, the officials were asked to video record the suggestions and solutions given to the farmers and upload them on digital platforms, as several will benefit.

Usually, the prices of vegetables go higher during the Onam season every year.  However, with the COVID pandemic dampening the spirits of festivals, the vegetable stall owners are not seeing a brisk sale this year as it was during the pre-COVID times. All the vegetables except carrot, Chinese potato (koorkka), and cauliflower are now priced below Rs 50 per kilogram in the retail market and the price is not likely to go up during this week, said the vendors.  ""One of the main reasons for the low prices is because we are getting enough supply from neighbouring Tamil Nadu. During the lockdown, several people started farming for their livelihood in the neighbouring states. Meanwhile, in Kerala, the demand for veggies has drastically come down during the last year. As we are getting enough stock and with less demand in here, the prices have come down,"" said Ernakulam Market Stall Owners Association president KK Ashraf.  He said with the schools remaining closed, most of the families are not buying more vegetables now. ""Veg items was always included while preparing lunch box for children. Now without schools functioning, families dont need that additional quantity. Another reason is the restrictions on marriage functions. Since a minimal number of 20 or 30 people are allowed now, caterers are also not buying vegetables in bulk. Hotels too are not buying more veggies for Onam Sadya as the customer turnouts are low,"" he said.  In the Ernakulam market, a minimum of 12 (big and small lorries) are delivering vegetables from Tamil Nadu on weekdays.

The August 14 quake hammered infrastructure, destroying or damaging some 130,000 homes, cutting off roads and pitching thousands of families in the Western Hemispheres poorest country into an uncertain future.  When the magnitude 7.2 quake struck, homemaker Lovely Jean was resting inside the general hospital of the southern city of Les Cayes, while her three-day-old baby, Love Shaiska, was in the neonatal ward being treated for an infection.  Les Cayes was one of the areas worst hit by the quake, and as the hospital walls trembled, Jean sent her husband, Pierre Alexandre, to grab the infant while she fled the building.  The earth was shaking and I was crying, so scared of what was happening, the 24-year-old said, cradling her child on the porch of their damaged home in a tiny village outside the town of Camp-Perrin, northwest of Les Cayes.  The three survived, though the hospital suffered damage that forced some of its departments, including the neonatal ward, to operate outside for days after the disaster.But the problems were only beginning for Jean and her husband, a subsistence farmer.  Alexandres fields were buried by landslides during the earthquake and rain unleashed by Tropical Storm Grace, which pummeled Haiti last Tuesday.  His entire potato and yuca crop was unreachable, leaving the family with barely any food to eat.Meanwhile, Love Shaiska was struggling to suckle, forcing her parents to pull together cash to buy formula.I dont know what well do, said Alexandre, 30.  More than a dozen other parents who spoke to Reuters in the quake zone expressed similar concerns about how they would cope.Over half a million children were affected by the earthquake, the U.N. childrens agency UNICEF said.  The temblor claimed the lives of at least 2,207 people, injured 12,268 more and left 344 missing, according to Haitian authorities, and followed an even more destructive earthquake in 2010 which killed tens of thousands of Haitians.Still, there are a few encouraging developments.  Late on Sunday, civil protection authorities said 24 people who had been reported missing, including four children, had been found and taken by helicopter to Camp-Perrin to be looked after.  Recovery efforts have been impeded by flooding and damage to roads, feeding tensions in hard-hit areas.

The quake destroyed their homes, crops and the deep concrete-lined holes used to collect and store rain water.  Now, with scant food and water, many of the young children suffer from hunger, fevers and infections, said Evelya Michele, a mother of five living in the encampment.

Talkative, yellow-beaked Juji had a brief star turn on social media, its story of survival amid the frenzied evacuations from Taliban-run Afghanistan striking a nerve with a global audience.  While searing scenes from the American-led airlift from Kabul after 20 years of war  such as those of Afghans falling to their deaths after trying to cling to the wheels of a military transport jet  gripped the world, France also was intensely involved in evacuating those who had risked their lives to cooperate with its government over the years.  French Ambassador Xavier Chatel was scrambling to support the efforts at Al-Dhafra airbase in the United Arab Emirates. Thousands of Afghan evacuees flooded the base near the UAE capital, along with military bases across the region, to be screened by American, French and other authorities over 12 sweltering days in August.  There were many exhilarating stories because there were artists, there were musicians, there were people who were so relieved that they could be evacuated, Chatel told The Associated Press Sunday from his residence overlooking the turquoise waters of the Persian Gulf. But at the same time, there was also an outpouring of distress.  Some 2,600 Afghan interpreters, artists, journalists, activists and military contractors squeezed onto flights out of Kabul to Abu Dhabi on their way to Paris with barely enough time to consider all theyd left behind. French authorities had started evacuations around a year ago, with 2,400 people airlifted from Kabul in the months before the fall, Chatel said.  In the midst of the chaos at Al-Dhafra, Chatel received a security alert. Officers, on the lookout for al-Qaida and Islamic State extremist threats, had discovered illegal cargo on board.  French Ambassador to the United Arab Emirates, Xavier Chatel gestures towards Juji, a rescued yellow-beaked mynah carried into the United Arab Emirates by a fleeing Afghan refugee, in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. (AP) French Ambassador to the United Arab Emirates, Xavier Chatel gestures towards Juji, a rescued yellow-beaked mynah carried into the United Arab Emirates by a fleeing Afghan refugee, in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. (AP)  A woman no older than 20 appeared, clutching a mystery cardboard box. Packed inside was her beloved pet with clipped wings  the famously chatty mynah, common in its range across Southeast Asia.  But because of sanitary concerns, there was no way she could bring the small bird, the only possession shed apparently taken with her from Kabul to Paris.  She started to cry, Chatel said. He declined to disclose details about the young woman and her circumstances for privacy reasons, except to say that she had lost everything. She had lost her country. She had lost her house, she had lost her life.  Chatels story of what happened next took hold on Twitter last week and turned Juji into a minor sensation, providing an uplifting counterpoint to the economic and humanitarian crises afflicting Afghanistan amid the Taliban takeover.  After receiving detailed instructions about Jujis dietary preferences  cucumbers, grapes, bread slices and the occasional potato  Chatel decided to adopt the bird, promising hed take good care of it.  The young woman found the ambassador on Twitter soon after landing in France. Top of her mind upon starting a new life as a refugee was her pet stranded on the Arabian Peninsula.

After chirping in Pashto for its first few days in Abu Dhabi, Juji had managed to utter something akin to Bonjour.  (The woman) told me something which still remains with me, Chatel said. The fact that the bird was still alive and that he was well looked after gave her faith and hope to start again.  Exactly why the story was so avidly embraced on social media remains a mystery, Chatel said. But there were no good news days out of Afghanistan during the anguished withdrawal of US and NATO forces.  A suicide bomber blew himself up at Kabul airport in late August, killing scores of Afghans and 13 US service members, and those who managed to escape their homes for new lives abroad were grappling with feelings of bewilderment and guilt. With the countrys economy in free fall, ordinary people have struggled to survive.  At Al-Dhafra airbase in August, you could see the fear in peoples faces, Chatel said. Children cried at the sound of popping balloons. One woman said she had forgotten her parents in a traumatic haze at Kabul airport. Parents arrived with stories of children theyd abandoned.  Until Chatel can devise a way to reunite Juji with its former owner, he said the black-winged bird remains a reminder to France of those frantic days  the courage of those embarking on new lives and the emotional toll of so many left behind.

2021-10-16,https://indianexpress.com/article/india/fertiliser-stocks-dip-as-global-prices-surge-farmers-are-hit-hard-7575438/,"DAP bazaar mein nahi hai (theres no di-ammonium phosphate in the market), says Pritam Singh Hanjra.  This farmer from Urlana Khurd village in the Madlauda tehsil of Haryanas Panipat district is, like many others, desperately searching for Indias second-most consumed fertiliser after urea. Containing 46% phosphorous, which is necessary for root establishment and growth, farmers mostly apply DAP as a basal dose before sowing.  It is neither available at the nearby Madlauda and Safidon mandis nor the more distant ones at Karnal and Kaithal. Farmers who go to sell paddy (currently being harvested) normally bring back DAP for their next wheat crop on the same tractor trolleys to save on burning diesel. But this time, they are all returning empty, notes Hanjra.  Farmers require about 110 kg of urea, 50 kg of DAP and 20 kg of MOP (muriate of potash) for every acre of wheat. The first dose of urea can be given 25-26 days after sowing. But DAP cannot wait and we need it well before sowing starts first week of November, he adds.  The desperation is more for potato, where sowing is already underway in Punjab and extends from mid-October to early-November in Uttar Pradesh. The fertiliser requirement, per acre, for it is around 110 kg urea, 90 kg DAP and 80 kg MOP.  Harjinder Singh from Malliwal village in Shahkot tehsil of Punjabs Jalandhar district plans to cultivate potato on 85 acres, including 47 acres of his own and the remaining taken on lease.  I have just 30 bags (each of 50 kg) of DAP and 10 bags of 12:32:16 (a complex fertiliser containing 12% nitrogen or N, 32% phosphorus or P and 16% potassium or K). These will suffice for hardly a fourth of my area, he complains.  The picture projected by farmers  there are viral media videos of lathi charges and even trucks being raided  is consistent with the stocks position of key nutrients, as per the governments own data.  Opening stocks for this month were less than half of their year-ago levels in the case of DAP and MOP, while also lower for urea and NPKS complexes.  The main reason for the precarious stocks  ahead of rabi plantings and also crucial Assembly polls in Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and Uttarakhand, scheduled for February-March  is surging global prices.  The landed price of imported DAP in India is now $675-680 per tonne (cost plus freight), compared to $370 at this time last year. MOP was imported at $230 per tonne a year ago, whereas it is available for not less than $500 today.  Prices have similarly soared for urea (from $280-285 to $660-665) and also intermediates such as phosphoric acid (from $689 to $1,160), ammonia ($230 to $615-625), rock phosphate ($100 to $150) and sulphur ($80-85 to $250-260).  The Narendra Modi government, on October 12, approved an increase in the subsidy on DAP from Rs 24,231 to Rs 33,000 per tonne, besides that on three NPKS complexes (from Rs 18,377 to Rs 20,377 for 12:32:16, Rs 16,293 to Rs 18,293 for 10:26:26 and Rs 13,131 to Rs 15,131 for 20:20:0:13, 0 refers to zero potassium, 13% Sulphur.).  The decision was taken to make it viable for fertiliser firms to import and also stop them from raising maximum retail prices (MRP) too sharply, especially given the upcoming state elections. Some companies had already hiked the MRP of the popular 12:32:16 complex from Rs 23,700-24,000 to Rs 34,000 per tonne. With the latest subsidy announcement, that is expected to be partially rolled back to Rs 29,000-29,500 levels.  But the main concern is availability: Has the higher subsidy come too late?  There would certainly be incentive to import more now. I expect ships to start arriving by end-October to early-November. The government should undertake 24/7 surveillance so that the imported material is moved directly to the consumption centres rather than being stocked. Secondly, some kind of rationing is required. DAP can be reserved mainly for wheat-growing areas, with 12:32:16 going for oilseeds; 10:26:26 for rabi paddy, pulses, sugarcane and potato; and 20:20:0:13 for universal application, industry expert G Ravi Prasad told The Sunday Express.","Fertiliser stocks dip as global prices surge, farmers are hit hard",POTATO
2021-10-21,https://indianexpress.com/article/india/govt-sets-up-war-room-on-movement-of-fertilisers-7584041/,"On October 17, three railway rakes carrying di-ammonium phosphate (DAP) were dispatched from Gujarats Mundra, Pipavav, and Kandla ports to Kanakpura, a station in Rajasthan catering to the mustard-growing areas of Jaipur, Tonk, Ajmer, and Sawai Madhopur districts. The permission for moving these rakes, the first two of 2,600 tonnes each and the third of 4,000 tonnes, was secured on an out of turn basis  that too, on a Sunday.  This level of minute planning and prioritisation of fertiliser movement by the Centre is happening for the first time, in response to an unprecedented shortage situation, both domestic and globally. As The Indian Express had reported, all-India stocks of DAP and muriate of potash on September 30 were less than half of a year-ago levels, even as international prices of fertilisers and inputs have surged to their highest since 2008-09.  We were earlier simply sending material based on the month-wise requirements for the season given to us by the states. (Rabi plantings start from October.) But now, we are finding out district-wise requirements and the crops where sowing is taking place. The field demand thus assessed is then sought to be addressed by mobilising rakes to those locations, said a senior official of the Department of Fertilisers (DOF).  On the ground, this means mustard and potato, which are planted in October, taking precedence over wheat. Thus, more rakes are being moved to Rajasthan and railheads such as Rewari, Khori, and Jhajjar in Haryanas mustard belt. In Uttar Pradesh too, the allocations at present are mainly to Aligarh, Mathura, Agra, Mainpuri, Etawah, Farrukhabad, Kanpur, and other rake points near the states potato- and mustard-growing tracts.  The rakes to Kanakpura were listed low in the seniority of indents. But after anticipating heavy demand from East Rajasthans mustard farmers, we sought special permission to allow them to jump the queue, the official said. The DOF is currently operating a 24/7 war room in close coordination with the Railway Board, fertiliser companies, and state agriculture departments.  The official claimed that the estimated 18.08 lakh tonnes (lt) DAP demand this month, mostly for mustard and potato, has already been met through opening stocks of 15 lt and production of 3 lt. In addition, companies have contracted about 6 lt imports, with 4.5 lt out of this reaching the ports, and 1 lt moved to consumption centres. Thus, there is no macro shortage, although the 15 lt stocks with the trade may not all be in places where DAP is immediately required.  Also Read | Fertiliser sales down on erratic monsoon rains  The DOF has assessed the DAP requirement at 17.13 lt in November, 9.48 lt in December, 5.46 lt in January, 4.06 lt in February, and 4.47 lt in March, adding up to 58.71 lt for the season. The same for complex fertilisers (containing combinations of nitrogen, phosphorous, potash and sulphur) has, likewise, been placed at 12.86 lt in October, 12.26 lt in November, 11.09 lt in December, 9.93 lt in January, 7.86 lt in February, and 6.84 lt in March, totalling 60.86 lt.  We were till October 15 moving an average of 50 rakes daily, which has since increased to 55 (30 of DAP/complexes and 25 urea). This will further go up to 60 by October-end. That is when wheat sowings would also start in Punjab, Haryana, and Madhya Pradesh, while only after mid-November in UP, the official added.  He denied that Punjab was facing a shortage of DAP: They have 1.2 lt stocks lying with retailers now. Their requirement for potato (largely grown in Jalandhar, Kapurthala, and Hoshiarpur) was already delivered in late September to early October. We have so far this month moved 35 rakes of DAP/complexes (roughly 1.5 lt) to the state and will do another 15 (45,000 tonnes) within the next one week. All this is for wheat.  Farmers apply DAP, containing 46 per cent phosphorous necessary for root establishment and growth, at the time of sowing. Urea, the most-widely consumed fertiliser having 46 per cent nitrogen content, is generally given first around three weeks after sowing when the crop is in vegetative and tillering stages.  India has some 2.8 lakh fertiliser dealers receiving supplies from 45-odd plants and 21 ports. Around 80 per cent of the material is moved by rail to 940 rake points covering an average distance of 750 km. Never before has this logistics system  reaching adequate quantities of fertiliser at the required place and time  been tested as it is being done currently.

For millennia, this humble, unprepossessing tuber flourished in the inhospitable terrain of the Andes, feeding the civilisations that rose and fell on its volatile slopes. It then crossed the cold Atlantic to stave off hunger in the Old World and here, just like in its South American homeland, it was made to do the work of 10 crops. It has given bulk and bite to meat-deprived pies and curries and added creaminess to stews and soups. It has been mashed to replace bread, brewed to make alcohol and roasted and fried to a crispness that no other food  whether it comes from animal or plant  can hope to match.  Now, it has been used to make something called potato milk. Veg of Lund, a Swedish plant-based company, has developed what it claims is the worlds first plant-based milk made from potatoes. The company claims that its potato milk is the most sustainable of all plant-based milk  56 times more water-efficient than almond milk and twice as efficient in land use as compared to oat milk. In a market that is always on the lookout for the next big plant-based substitute, the idea of milk squeezed out of a potato may just catch on. According to a recent trends report published by a UK-based retail chain, potato milk is set to be one of of the hottest new foods in 2022.  In view of the climate crisis, the urge to give up all animal-based foods is laudable. Given that food systems are designed to make us more dependent on animal proteins, it is perhaps even heroic. But, some things are sacred and the potato is one of these. It is meant to be hearty and heavy, shoring up the most meagre meal with its abundance of carbohydrates.

As the couple knelt down and began digging around the object, Colin wondered if it was some kind of strange fungal growth, a giant puffball. After Colin pried it out with his garden fork, he scratched away a bit of the skin and tasted it.  A potato.  We couldnt believe it, Donna said. It was just huge.  A New Zealand couple dug up a potato the size of a small dog in their backyard and have applied for recognition from Guinness World Records. (Colin Craig-Brown via AP) A New Zealand couple dug up a potato the size of a small dog in their backyard and have applied for recognition from Guinness World Records. (Colin Craig-Brown via AP)  And not exactly pretty. Donna describes its appearance as more of an ugly, mutant look.  But its quite possibly the largest potato on record. When the couple lugged it into their garage and put it on their old set of scales, it weighed in at a remarkable 7.9 kilograms (17.4 pounds). Thats equal to a couple of sacks of regular potatoes, or one small dog.  In the weeks since their unusual find on Aug. 30, the couples potato has become something of a celebrity around their small farm near Hamilton. Theyve named the potato Doug, after the way it was unearthed, and Colin even built a small cart to tow Doug around.  We put a hat on him. We put him on Facebook, taking him for a walk, giving him some sunshine, Colin said. Its all a bit of fun. Its amazing what entertains people.  A more official weigh-in at a local farming store put Doug at 7.8 kg. The Guinness World Records entry for the heaviest potato is a 2011 monster from Britain that weighed in at just under 5 kg. The couple say theyve applied to Guinness to have Doug recognized and are waiting to hear back.  Guinness said it couldnt share information on the application and that the British potato remained the record-holder, for now at least.  A large potato sits on kitchen bench at Donna and Colin Craig-Browns home near Hamilton, New Zealand. Theyve named the potato Doug, because they dug it up. (Donna Craig-Brown via AP) A large potato sits on kitchen bench at Donna and Colin Craig-Browns home near Hamilton, New Zealand. Theyve named the potato Doug, because they dug it up. (Donna Craig-Brown via AP)  Colin said he doesnt have any secret gardening tips. Usually they throw a bunch of cow manure and straw onto their garden and see what happens. He said theyd been growing cucumbers in that area of their garden before the weeds took over and hadnt planted any potatoes. Doug must have been self-sown, and quite possibly growing for a couple of years or more.  Its a mystery to me, Colin said. Its one of natures little pleasant surprises.  But Doug hasnt proved an easy charge to look after. As the couple showed the potato off, it began drying out and losing weight. Mold started growing from its wounds.  He was getting a bit pongy, said Colin, referring to the potatos smell.  So Colin cleaned up Doug as best he could and put the potato in the freezer, where it remains.  But Colin may not be done with Doug yet. An amateur brewer, Colin said hes keen to turn Doug into a nice drop of potato vodka.

Though they are not directly involved in the illegal activity, they are hired by contractors or middlemen to work in ganja fields. The tribals are paid Rs 200 to Rs 300 per day depending on the nature of the work.  A visit to Odia Camp has revealed that the tribals are ignorant of ganja cultivators and where the raised crop goes. Some of the tribals are not aware of the fact that ganja cultivation is a crime, said a revenue official.  Odia Camp is one of the hamlets in Mothugudem panchayat. It is named Odia Camp as about 55 tribal families migrated from Odisha, live in the hamlet. We cultivate paddy and cereals in 30 to 40 acres in the fringes of the adjacent hill. We also get some income through the sale of honey, tamarind and other forest produce, said Kilo Mothi, a dweller of Odia Camp.  In the absence of any other work for the tribals of Odia Camp located in Andhra and Odisha Border, they used to work in ganja fields. The farm work includes sowing seeds, watering plants, removing weeds and harvesting the crop, said a tribal.  The hamlet does not have power supply. Though there are no borewells, watering the crop is not a problem as hill streams flow throughout the year. Pipelines have been laid to ganja fields by cultivators to draw water from streams.  Ganja seeds are sown between April and May. The crop comes to harvest in four to six months. For the tribals of Odia Camp, working in ganja fields is a matter of survival as they are illiterate and ignorant to be aware of its harmful effects.  Generally, middlemen maintain secrecy in cultivation of ganja. They do not hire the same group of tribals for sowing seeds and raising the crop.If a group of tribals is hired for sowing seeds, another group is engaged for watering the crop and removing weeds.  As the tribals do not have any address proof and caste certificate, a majority of them are not getting benefits of any welfare scheme. Some receive monthly ration and pension at the Mothugudem panchayat office, said Chintur tahsildar K Satyanarayana.  SP M Ravindranath Babu said, Alternative livelihood will be provided to tribals as part of Parivarthana to curb ganja cultivation in AOB.  790 kg of ganja worth Rs 80 lakh seized in Vizag  Visakhapatnam: In a major haul, the city police seized 790 kg of ganja worth Rs 80 lakh, while it was being smuggled in a truck to Tamil Nadu. Duvvada CI Lakshmi said ganja was concealed under potato bags in the truck.

Foods with a long shelf life often have preservatives that cause inflammation in the brain, which leads to memory loss.   It ages the brain and brings on cognitive decline.   Things such as potato chips, frozen pizza, pasta, meat, chicken and other items with large amounts of preservatives, are harmful to the brain.   Only four weeks of processed food consumption can affect brain functioning adversely.  For  Damage is inevitable  Dr Aditya S Chowti, Senior Consultant Internal Medicine, Fortis Hospital, Cunningham Road, Bengaluru  Eating a lot of processed food or complex carbohydrates can result in the production of toxins, which triggers an inflammatory process, hence leading to cascading mental health. Some foods contain substances like nitrosamines, which can cause the liver to produce fats that are toxic to the brain, while others contain diacetyl, which may increase the amyloid plaques in the brain, linked to Alzheimers disease. Thus, those who consume a lot of processed food will eventually be at a greater risk of memory loss.  Against  Its not the villain  Dr Sreekanta Swamy, Head of Neurology, Aster RV Hospital, Bengaluru  There is a combination of many other factors that can affect memory problems, so blaming only processed food is not right. Those who follow a balanced diet, exercise regularly, take care of their mental health, have no associated co-morbidities, arent likely to be impacted by the moderate intake of processed food, neither is their memory in danger.

The past few years have witnessed the humble Indian sweets undergo a metamorphosis and the dessert category is responding to the demand for healthier choices. Luxury brands are answering this call by taking popular sweets such as besan laddoo, kaju katli and khoya barfi, and swapping their ingredients for healthier ones.  Salaluddin Ahmed, chef with Namaste Dwaar, shares that there has been a 30-40 percent shift in food consumption pattern with healthy food, especially healthy sweets, becoming a top priority. Till a few years back, requests for vegan or gluten-free sweets were few and far between, but now, specifically after the pandemic, people are all for healthier options.  Chef Anand Panwar, Executive Pastry Chef, Roseate Hotels and Resorts, agrees. Owing to this trend, we introduced several alternatives that are gluten-free, or sugar-free. People are loving things such as flaxseed laddoo, roasted channa laddoo, coconut laddoo, hazelnut peda, walnut peda, and bal mithai.  Oil-free, no-dairy laddoos?  Gita Ramesh, Managing Director Kairali Ayurvedic Group, says its possible. Jaggery is a hit. Palm sugar comes next as it has less glucose content that keeps blood sugar level stable. Chef Vidushi Sharma, Founder of Truffle and Co., a bespoke desserts company, has been making things in almond milk or oat milk, cashew butter, or coconut oil. Almonds are a versatile ingredient that go well with vegan desserts, she says.  Given the growing concern over food adulteration with the use of synthetic colour, wax, and preservatives in food, especially desserts off-late, people are ever more concious of what they consume. We will see more of plant-based and plant-forward foods in the future, says Jasjit Singh, Co-founder, and Business Partner, La Marinate.  If nothing else, the pandemic has increased peoples awareness for nourishment. Food is not seen just as an indulgence but also as a value addition to ones health. Thats why, a sweet dish has to find the right balance between healthy and decadent, says Chef Himanshu Taneja, Culinary Director, South Asia, Marriott International, adding, In the past two years, I have received more requests for steamed and low-fat dessert than ever before.

Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia said the Delhi Government was the only one in the country to have earmarked 800 ghats for the puja even as North East Delhi BJP MP Manoj Tiwari argued that devotees were forced to take a dip in toxic Yamuna water because of lack of proper arrangements by the city government.  Revolving around the cultural sensitivities of Delhis Purvanchali population  which numbers upwards of 20 lakh  the observance of Chhath Puja first became a political hot potato when the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) denied approval to the residents to perform the rituals at public places due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  The issue snowballed into a full-blown controversy after the DDMA allowed the devotees to perform the puja at public places but prohibited them from doing so on the banks of the Yamuna where it has traditionally been observed for decades.  Despite all the COVID-19 hurdles, the Delhi Government had decided to celebrate the Chhath Puja in a grand manner. The way the celebrations started today, I can certainly say that our efforts for a grand celebration have borne fruit, Mr. Sisodia said.  We all very well remember that before the Kejriwal Government was formed in 2015, barely 80-90 Chhath ghats were set up by the previous Governments. Only a select few from BJP and Congress could use these ghats. Today, there are over 800 Chhath ghats spread across Delhi, the Deputy Chief Minister said.  However, Mr. Tiwari, who visited the locations where the puja was allowed by the authorities, accused the Delhi Government of neglecting not just the arrangements for the festival but also the health of devotees who were forced to take a dip in toxic foam.  He added that the abysmal condition of the Yamuna was fit to be taken suo motu cognisance by the Supreme Court to dismiss the Delhi Government for lying regarding its condition and promising to clean it over the last seven years.  Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal is not only playing with the cultural feelings of the people but also their health. Water from drains being allowed to fall into the river has completely choked it, he said after speaking to devotees at a Chhath ghat in Kalindi Kunj.  I have no words; this is what all the promises regarding the cleanliness of the Yamuna and improving its condition over the last seven years have culminated into. The Supreme Court should take cognisance of these lies and dismiss the Kejriwal Government, he demanded.","Govt., Oppn. play blame game over Chhath Puja arrangements",POTATO

In the last three weeks, the prices of vegetables including tomato, beans and drumstick have seen a three-fold surge. Wholesale dealers said that even before the beginning of Deepavali, there was a shortage of supply from Tamil Nadu, from where over 60 per cent of supplies are coming to Kerala.  This has resulted in a sudden surge in prices of vegetables. Schools reopened in the state last week and there was an increase in demand for vegetables. This was also another reason for the price hike.  ""There is a 30 per cent dip in overall quantity of loads arriving from Tamil Nadu every week.  The suppliers have informed us that the cultivation in low-lying areas was severely affected due to floods. The volume of cultivation was also low during the last few months resulting in a dip in supply,"" said Ernakulam Market Stall Owners Association president K K Ashraf. He said that other than Chinese potato (Koorkka,) the prices of all other vegetables have witnessed a surge in the last couple of weeks.  Among vegetables, tomato price in the retail market touched Rs 80 on Wednesday. Ashraf said that in the wholesale market, tomato is priced at Rs 55 and the retailers will add their margin to the actual price, which has resulted in the surge. There are also complaints from consumers that there is no uniformity in price and it varies from shop to shop. ""The vegetable vendors/retailers are charging as per their will for vegetables. If we get a kilogram of tomato for Rs 80 from one shop, another shop nearby will charge Rs 75 or Rs 85, as per their will. Most of the shops do not display the price list,"" said Harikrishnan, a resident of Vazhakkala.",Vegetable prices rise in Kerala as supply from TN dips due to floods,POTATO

There are about 15.70 lakh agricultural power connections in Rajasthan.  The State governments Energy Department has launched an exercise to assess the demand for electricity at agricultural fields during the next two months to ensure adequate supply to farmers. The rabi crops are generally sown in two phases in the State, first in October-November and later in January-February.  Additional Chief Secretary (Energy) Subodh Agarwal instructed the public sector power discoms in Jaipur, Ajmer and Jodhpur on Wednesday to make an assessment of the potential demand in the rabi season based on the average demand during the corresponding period in the last three years. The three discoms were also asked to prepare their action plan within the next three days.  The present supply of electricity for agricultural power consumers is 10,528 MW against the demand for 11,297 MW, while the demand during the rabi season is likely to soar by 790 MW. The power demand during the peak hours at present has been calculated at 13,864 MW. Discom chairman Bhaskar A. Sawant said the average demand during December last year was 10,533 MW and a roadmap would be prepared for meeting the demand this year.  Will meet challenge  Farmers sow the rabi crops of wheat, barley, gram, mustard, taramira, masoor, pea, flaxseed, sunflower, potato and black mustard during the winter season in different parts of the State.

If this becomes a reality, it will upset the poll calculations of all established parties in the state.We are actively working in this direction and contacting different farm unions to form a party of farmers and also to widen the platform to contest the elections.The issue is already being discussed among farm groups and we are trying to take all stakeholders on board to form a farmers party and also to take good representatives from other sections and professions to bring a qualitative political change in Punjab, said Jaswinder Singh Sangha, general secretary of Jalandhar Potato Growers Association, in influential group of farmers in the region.He said they were also working to bring into the fold Mission Punjab launched by BKU leader Gurnam Singh Chaduni so that a formidable force is formed. We are talking to unions that are part of the Sanyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), other farm groups and mazdoor organizations as people are already disenchanted with other established political parties and there has been strong undercurrent for a qualitative change, he added.Common refrain among farm groups and farmers is that farmers should widen their platform and contest on their own in place of having alliance with any existing political party, Sangha said.The farm movement has already added to the political fluidity in the state and in case the farm groups jump into the poll fray by forming a common platform, this would further complicate the situation and all the poll arithmetic would change. Other parties - Congress, Shiromani Akali Dal and AAP  are likely to be impacted while BJP is already limited to urban areas, barring very few exceptions.Traditionally, Congress and SAD Dal have dominated in Punjabs political scene, and the latter had an alliance with BJP, its earlier avatar Jan Sangh till 1980 and then with BSP. However, as disenchantment with principal players grew, it proved advantageous for AAP in the 2014 elections despite lack of party infrastructure. However, the party failed to gain further as its central leadership through its observers from Delhi micro-managed the party affairs, and it could get just 20 seats in 2017 assembly election, with its vote share also slightly dipping despite SADBJP alliance being relegated to third place. In 2019, AAP lost even security deposits at most of the seats but after the crisis in Congress started in April, it started gaining ground.Well-placed sources revealed that AAP had also sent emissaries to a senior farm leader for joining hands.

Senior BJP leaders including Leader of the Opposition Suvendu Adhikari, State president Sukanta Majumdar and national vice-president Dilip Ghosh attended an event organised by party Kisan Morcha at a time when Trinamool Congress chairperson and Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee is busy campaigning in Goa.  The BJP leadership highlighted issues of farmers distress particularly loss of crops due to floods and rains earlier this month because of the impact of the deep depression in the Bay of Bengal and demanded compensation for the affected farmers.  Wrath of floods  Several areas of south Bengal have faced the wrath of floods this time. The areas of Hooghly and Howrah, which are part of the Lower Damodar basin, have been inundated not once, twice but three times. After Aman paddy was destroyed, the farmers cultivated potato and vegetables but the untimely rains have destroyed even them, Mr. Adhikari said.  The BJP leaders demanded compensation to the farmers who have suffered crop loses. Mr. Adhikari threatened a march from Singur to Nabanna (State Secretariat) and asked his party supporters to form Krishak Bachao Committees in their respective areas. Pointing out at the site where the structure of the factory had come up, the BJP MLA said, Mamata Banerjee has shown how to jeopardise agriculture.  Singur is synonymous with the fight against forcible land acquisition against Tata Motors small car project which catapulted Ms. Banerjee to power in 2011. While the TMC Government has facilitated the return of land to unwilling farmers, a large part of it at the proposed factory site cannot be cultivated because of concrete.  The BJPs decision to protest at Singur is not only to raise the issue of the farmers but also take the fight to rural Bengal. Interestingly, the three-day protest comes just before the December 19 elections to the Kolkata Municipal Corporation.  Mr. Majumdar asked why subsidised electricity is not made available to the farmers in the State. He and other leaders took a swipe at the TMC chairpersons campaign in Goa.  In Goa, there are many people from districts of West Bengal as migrant workers. The people of Goa must realise that if they support the TMC then they will have to go to other States to work, Mr. Majumdar said. Many BJP MPs and MLAs were present at the protest venue.  Diversionary tactic: TMC  The TMC leadership asked why the BJP was shying away from campaigning in Kolkata and instead went to Singur.  It is nothing but a diversionary tactic to go Singur. Even at Singur, the BJP had lost in the Assembly polls, TMC leader and Minister Firhad Hakim said. Referring to the criticism of Mr. Adhikari, TMC leader Kunal Ghosh said the BJP leader has built his entire political career on the success of the Singur land movement under the leadership of Ms. Banerjee.",BJP stages protest at Singur as Mamata Banerjee campaigns in Goa,POTATO

Along with eggs, these were the only two items that recorded a fall. However, not all vegetables followed this trend. Tomatoes were an outlier with a staggering 31% rise in costs. Their bloated costs were induced by a drastic fall in supply. Also, when demand surged, traders and retailers increased their mark-ups, inflating prices further.  Highs and lows  India's retail inflation rate, measured by the Consumer Price Index, stood at 4.91% in November. The price of oils and fats, fuel and light, and transport and communications increased the most in November. On the other hand, vegetable prices contracted by 13.62%.  Chart appears incomplete?

Two of the three staple vegetables which carry much weight in the calculation  onion and potato  recorded a 30% and 45% drop in prices respectively compared to a year ago. However, the vegetable which carried the third most weight, tomato, recorded a 31% rise in prices compared to last year. No other vegetable recorded an increase of more than 20% in prices.  Costly vs cheap  A look at retail prices show that there is no distortion in inflation figures. Chart shows the retail prices of staple vegetables for the past two years. Tomato prices have been rising since October, while prices of onion and potato have softened. A kg of tomato, which cost 41 in November 2020, was 58 in November 2021  a 42% rise.  Across centres  The price of tomato was costlier across centres in November and December. In Amritsar it crossed 83/kilo in December and in Guwahati it touched 76/kilo on an average. In Bhubaneswar a kilo was bought for 70 on an average in December whereas in Bengaluru and Lucknow it crossed the 60 mark  Arrivals and mark-ups  The surge in tomato's November prices was preceded by a steep fall in their arrivals at the markets. The coloured lines in Charts 4A, 4B and 4C depict tomato arrivals in select cities in the last few November months. The coloured lines in the charts depict the average prices in November. Across all cities, a clear pattern emerges from the charts  if arrivals dip, prices surge. However, how is this price rise being managed, and who benefits from this? Charts 5A, 5B and 5C depict the difference between the wholesale price and retail price in all the months between Jan. 2017 and Nov. 2021. As can be observed, the price difference is peaking again in November 2021. This indicates that as the demand surged and supplies dropped, retailers increased their mark-up and sold at a much higher multiple than what they purchased. The graphs show that this is a routine practice almost every year-end when supplies drop and demand peaks.  Targeted mark-up  The graph shows the % of mark-up set by traders and retailers for food products in Indian cities. The data is based on a 2019 survey done by RBI. For instance, in the case of tomatoes, traders increased the price by around 20% and the retailers increased it by 40%.  Farmers don't benefit  However these markups don't translate to higher profits for farmers, especially in the case of vegetables. Results from RBI survey:  A routine event  Vegetable prices are highly volatile and increases at the year-end due to reduced supply.

Sri Sasthalaya Catering, who have been running sabha canteens for seven years, will be serving an elaborate lunch at the venue for the first time.  We have been granted permission to serve ela sappad (a traditional lunch on a banana leaf), says Ramesh Krishnan, the proprietor. He adds, We usually serve mini lunch on plates, but this year we are looking forward to serving a freshly made, authentic kalyana sappad (wedding style lunch). The menu will be diverse, with different types of rasam, sambar, vetha kulambu and moru kulambu. There will be a variety of thogayal (lentil based chutnies) and payasams everyday.  He promises that the menus will be non-repetitive, with mavadu (tender mango pickle) and veppalakatti (a traditional dry pickle made with lime leaves) readied exclusively for the meals.  Starting from 6am, the canteen will serve piping hot Chettinad specials such as vella appam, kuzhi paniyaram, appam and idiyappam. They are also launching pizza idlis: idlis steamed in circular plates, topped with mixed vegetables and loaded with cheese. Still in a Mc Sabha frame of mind? Try their cheese idlis as well.  Of course all idlis, even the ones with American accents, must come with chutney and coffee. We are serving ginger chutney, tomato kara chutney, Kumbakonam kadappa (a regional speciality made with moong dal, coconut, spices and mixed vegetables) and Chettinad masala kulambu (an aromatic gravy with vegetables, made with freshly ground coconut and spices), says Ramesh.  As for dessert, as always he says their khoa jangri is what steals the show year after year. Pricing is deliberately competitive. Sabha canteens are an opportunity for caterers like us to find new customers that may bring in business for the rest of the year, says Ramesh. Therefore my focus is to impress the customers with our food, and definitely not profit.  Dont forget to try the coffee, the kiosk is always a major crowd puller here.We source high quality coffee beans from a single estate in Coorg and cows milk from local suppliers, says Ramesh. We start serving coffee as early as 5am.  Although this has been a year of takeaway, Ramesh is determined to keep the experience personal, and packaging free: We want rasikas to come to the venue, enjoy the fresh, hot meal served on the banana leaf and experience authentic Chennai hospitality. Therefore we will not be offering take away.  @Narada Gana Sabha, TTK Road, Alwarpet. The canteen will run December 17 to January 5, from 6am to 10pm everyday.  Call 9500028384.  Sastha Catering Services, Mylapore Fine Arts Club  Last year, RK Venkatesan ran the sabha canteen despite the pandemic, even though there were no music events or concerts. And though people were nervous about crowds, it was comforting to experience at least one familiar note in a tensely unpredictable year.  This year they have started a week ahead of the season due to an overwhelming demand from customers. People are now confident of leaving their homes and heading to the canteen, says RK Venkatesan adding, On day one (December 10) we served 300 lunches, which was rather overwhelming.  Sastha serves a typical South Indian wedding feast on a banana leaf (400 per head). In a wedding feast we normally serve a set menu such as potato roast, aviyal and usili. But I am trying to bring in more variety, says Venkatesan. For example, he says, they serve poosanikka pulippu kootu, chow chow rasavangi (a thick gravy made with coconut, spices, with brinjal or chowchow) and other traditional home style dishes. The focus is on using less oil and spices, he adds.  This is the fifth year that the caterer is running a sabha canteen during the music season.  For breakfast, while there are the traditional ghee dosas, to keep things interesting, Sastha also serves pineapple dosa, beetroot dosa and spinach dosa. If you drop by in the evening, look out for their popular crisp vethala (betel leaf) bajji, Manglore bondas and paani puri.  For the New Year, we will be serving a special lunch (500) where one can taste special items from Andhra, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Karnataka, says Venkatesh.  Kumbakonam degree coffee is available through the day and is served in a brass davara set. Another novelty this year is a counter selling sweets and savouries.

Food is also being delivered through Dunzo and Swiggy.  Mountbatten Mani, Hemamalini Kalyana Mandapam  Legendary cook and caterer, Mountbatten Mani, a trendsetter in the sabha canteen scene, turned 90 last month. His son K Srinivasan who runs the Mountbatten Mani Catering Services, catered at Sri Parthasarathy Swamy Sabha, popular for its elaborate sit down lunches, for a decade. Then, last year the pandemic halted most of the citys Margazhi traditions, including their canteen.  Srinivasan has decided to try a new format this year by organising a Margazhi Food Festival at the Hemamalini Kalyana Mandapam. We are running the canteen as a separate entity at the wedding hall this year, he says, adding This probably is the first time that a canteen is functioning without any concert or under the aegis of any sabha. I am organising such a canteen only for sake of my loyal customers, as they look forward to our elaborate meals every year during the December Season.  His team specialises in traditional vegetarian meals, as well as snacks and tiffin. I try to bring into the menu, what we normally may not find in the restaurant. For example, paal kozhukattai, vella paniyaram and badam halwa, which is my fathers secret recipe, says Srinivasan.

2021-12-19,https://indianexpress.com/article/world/he-bombed-the-nazis-outwitted-the-soviets-and-modernized-christmas-7679953/,"Written by Laurie Gwen Shapiro  The B-17 he was piloting had lost two of its four engines to enemy fire, and as Si Spiegel surveyed the ruined landscape, he had one thought: We have to get behind the Russian front.  As part of the Allied raid on Berlin, his bomber had dropped its payload over the German capital, but hed been hit with flak and would almost certainly not make it back to the base in England. No pilot wanted to get shot down over Nazi Germany, especially not a Jewish pilot.  Spiegel had essentially bluffed his way into the cockpit as a skinny teenager from Greenwich Village, trusting hed figure it out as he went. This was no different. He told his crew they were headed for Poland; they could get their parachutes ready, but were not to bail out unless he gave the order. They would attempt an emergency landing.  Si Spiegel is one of the last bomber pilots of World War II still with us. I met him on a windy December morning in 2019. I happened to overhear him discussing Eleanor Roosevelts love of aviation in front of her sculpture on Riverside Drive. I couldnt help butting in  I was writing a biography of Mrs. Roosevelts great friend Amelia Earhart. He seemed wary of my enthusiasm, but when he saw the Lower East Side address on my business card, he smiled. I had inherited my grandparents old apartment in one of the International Ladies Garment Workers Union buildings, the same address where his union parents had lived.  He invited me over for coffee that week. What began as a way to do research for my book  there arent many living aviators from that era, after all  evolved into a series of conversations over weeks and then months. His considerable charm and sharp memory were matched by his stamina  he would happily talk for hours but only if they didnt conflict with his regular gym workouts.  But he was 95 then (now 97), and he clearly had been needing an audience for his stories. In the first hour of our first meeting, I learned that he flew dozens of critical and dangerous missions during the war, had saved his crew by successfully crash-landing an enormous bomber in no-mans land  and then helped orchestrate a daring escape back out.  Si Spiegel, 97, at his home in New York, Dec. 18, 2021. Spiegel, a bomber pilot, can claim a dual legacy: as a war hero and as a father of the artificial tree. (Carly Zavala/The New York Times) Si Spiegel, 97, at his home in New York, Dec. 18, 2021. Spiegel, a bomber pilot, can claim a dual legacy: as a war hero and as a father of the artificial tree. (Carly Zavala/The New York Times)  Perhaps most remarkable: Spiegel is improbably best known as the king of the artificial Christmas tree.  Si Spiegel was born in New York City in 1924, the first year of the Macys Thanksgiving Day Parade and the last year that Ellis Island operated as an immigration station. It was the Jazz Age, and Si wore button-up knickers. He remembers his first zip-up fly and when his family got their first telephone. They would crowd around the radio, especially whenever the president gave an address. Roosevelt, he said, was our hero.  He was tuned to the radio the day Amelia Earhart disappeared over the Pacific. And when Pearl Harbor was attacked, Si was 17 years old and living near his fathers hand laundry in Greenwich Village.  After graduating from Textile High School, he went to work in a machine shop, but he wanted to fight the Nazis. So without telling his parents, Spiegel enlisted in the Army shortly after he turned 18. He was a reedy youth, 5-foot-7 and 150 pounds. In basic training, noting his machine-shop skills, they sent him to aircraft mechanic school at Roosevelt Field on Long Island. He was crestfallen.  How would I fight Hitler with a wrench? he recalled thinking.  A sympathetic officer in the hangar with him suggested he go to Mitchel Field, just a couple of miles by bus. Maybe theyd take him as a pilot. Unlike the recruitment office at Times Square, the one at Mitchel Field was deserted. It set his life on a different path.  I signed up in an unusual place already in uniform, and there were only two of us that day, Spiegel recalled. The other fellow was foiled by the eyesight tests. I had perfect vision.  He was accepted into pilot training, which took him to Nashville, Tennessee, then California and then, as a cadet, to Hobbs, New Mexico, where hed learn to pilot a B-17, the massive bomber known as the Flying Fortress.  Many military men were chain-smoking drinkers when not on duty, but Spiegel, still a teenager, never smoked or drank much or hit the brothels. Maybe I had a lot of opportunities as a new pilot, but I was too shy to recognize them or take advantage.  Hobbs had one thing of interest, a girl named Frankie Marie Smith. She was only 17 and a beauty. Back in high school, Si Spiegel would never have thought he had a chance with a girl like that. But now he was a dashing lieutenant who flew a B-17.  Within weeks, they were married in Lovington, New Mexico. Her father insisted we get married in an Evangelical church, the Church of God, Spiegel said. When they parted, Frankie Marie gave him a photo he would carry during missions. Then he left New Mexico and went to meet his crew, a motley collection of leftovers.  We had five Catholics, two Jews, he said. Catholics werent treated too well, either. We had a Mormon, too. Spiegel said the only WASP was a ball-turret gunner who had gotten into trouble with the law in Chicago. And a judge said, You have two choices, he recalled. You can go to jail or join the Army.  Spiegel has outlived all of his crew members but still holds their stories. His bombardier and first real friend in the service, Danny Shapiro, was later shot down on another plane and held as a prisoner of war for a year. Dale Tyler was the Mormon tail gunner from Utah who came from a family of 13. Harold Bennett was my top turret gunner, from Massachusetts. Killed in a training accident on another plane. His chute never opened.  They were assigned to the U.S. 8th Air Force, and their base of operations would be in an English town called Eye, near the coast about 100 miles northeast of London.  Spiegels first flight in formation, at age 20, was a short mission over Belgium when the Germans were retreating. We were bombing them to prevent blowing up a bridge, he said. It was what airmen would call a milk run  a mission with little danger. I thought, oh, this is great!  Over the next year, Spiegel would carry out 35 missions, all of them in daylight, which conferred a strategic advantage but often resulted in significant casualties.  Their odds of survival were terrible. More than 50,000 American airmen lost their lives in World War II, mostly on B-17s and B-24s. The 8th Air Force suffered 40% of all casualties in the air war.  Mission 33 is what he often relives when reflecting on his war years.  It was an early-morning departure on Saturday, Feb. 3, 1945, a maximum-effort campaign now studied by military historians as the Berlin Mission. An overwhelming force of 1,437 bombers and 948 fighters took off from the English countryside to hit the Third Reichs Luftwaffe headquarters.  They said we were bombing Berlin headquarters, Spiegel recalled. In his previous missions, he said, he had never given much thought to where the bombs fell. But as he approached Berlin, it suddenly dawned on him that this would not be a precision raid against a military installation. With 2,000 planes, and its pattern bombing, he said, were bombing civilians. But our command wanted to get the war over with.  He had thought about this a lot over the years. What he thought then, he agrees with now: Whatever it takes to stop this evil. We went on a mission, we dropped bombs, we came back. As far as other bombers, Ive gone to a lot of reunions, and I never heard any regret.  The plane had an engine malfunction early in the flight, not unusual on a B-17. But over the target in Berlin, he lost the second engine to flak, and fuel was leaking.  Spiegel said he could keep up with the formation with one engine gone. With two, it was impossible. To make it back to England, they would have to fly into a headwind and back through a flak area. We would be losing altitude, which meant that they could shoot us from the ground.  By this late stage of the war, the German forces had retreated to Germany, and the Soviets, American allies, were coming across Poland. Spiegel knew from radio broadcasts that the Soviets had taken Warsaw. He asked his navigator, Ray Patulski, to give him a heading for Warsaw. Spiegel thought they would be safe if they got past Russian lines. He told his crew to throw stuff out of the plane as they lost altitude: flak suits, extra ammunition, anything of any weight.  The radioman made contact with England and relayed their status: No one hurt, two engines out, attempting to land in Warsaw. The Brits said they would notify the Yank authorities. That was the last anyone heard from the plane for weeks.  The nine men reached Warsaw at 1:30 p.m. The city was rubble. A bridge lay torn and twisted across the frozen Vistula River. Looking for a place to land, they headed downriver until they spotted a single-engine plane with the Soviet red star. It was barely 200 feet off the ground.  Spiegel partly lowered his wheels and fired flares  a friendly gesture. The Soviet pilot wiggled his wings to indicate, Follow me and led them over forests, a treacherous flight path for such a huge plane. Eventually, they belly-landed in a frozen potato field in the village of Reczyn. No one was injured, although the aircraft would never fly again.  The Nazis had held much of Poland at one point, and Spiegel didnt know if any Germans were still there. He and his co-pilot, Bill Hole, left through the hatch to be met by villagers.  Amerikansky! Spiegel hollered. Some of the gathering villagers hollered too. Benzine! Benzine! They wanted the gasoline  the benzine  that was leaking out of the plane and ran toward them with buckets to collect the fuel. The crew let them have it.  The Americans were soon taken to Plock, a small city north on the Vistula, where they were billeted in apartments the Russians took over from locals  and treated as heroes by the Soviets after the successful raid on Berlin. Then they were moved again, to the Polish city of Torun, where the Red Army had taken over an abandoned German airfield. There they met another American crew whose plane had made a landing at Torun. They expected to stay until a rescue plane arrived  a week at most.  The Americans were not prisoners, but they were not allowed to leave until Moscow approved  and they had no means to leave anyhow. Spiegel met the other pilot, a fiery Illinois officer named George Ruckman, whose plane had lost one engine to flak and had blown a tire in its landing.  Despite confinement, the Americans largely did what they pleased. Over the coming weeks, the crews would go down to the Vistula and spend the day target shooting with rifles lent by the Russians. But life at Torun was mostly waiting. They gave up hoping for the C-47 transport plane. The official status of those flying on the B-17 43-38150 during the Berlin Mission: missing in action.  The other pilot soon devised a wild escape plan. They would send a team to Spiegels wrecked plane, 70 miles away, and have them collect an engine and a spare tire and return to Torun. It would require stealth, courage and bribery.  Both American crews bartered with the Soviet soldiers. Several revolvers and a $10 fountain pen paid for the gasoline for their secret flight; a $75 wristwatch given to a Russian officer secured a Ford tractor to haul the second engine back. According to war records, with the $30 Ruckman had in his own wallet, he bribed Russian MPs to overlook the cutting down of two telephone poles needed as hoists.  Using salvaged tools left by the Nazis, the crews worked in plain sight of the other Russians, who seemed more concerned with random artillery fire and the possibility that German snipers were still in the area. The Americans feared too much attention, though, and Spiegel made sure to drink with the Russian officers in Torun, toasting Stalin, Roosevelt and Churchill, the day Ruckman had villagers hoist the plane in the potato field.  Early on St. Patricks Day, 1945, the Americans jumped into the jury-rigged plane and began to taxi along the frozen ground. A single Soviet guard waved frantically to stop. But the Russians never chased them as they cleared the field and lifted off. Maybe they were relieved they didnt have to feed us, Spiegel offered.  Determined to avoid German anti-aircraft guns in their hobbled plane, the 19 men headed south, and eight hours later landed at an American air base in Foggia, Italy.  There the Red Cross had a party for the crew, giving them candy, cookies and much-needed toiletries  they hadnt brushed their teeth since the bombing of Berlin. U.S. Army staff checked the escape plane, and other than a few loose bolts, it was fine.  After months of fearing Spiegel had been killed in action, his family in New York received a telegram from Italy shortly before April 3, 1945, the shared birthday of Spiegels younger brother and his father: Am safe and well. Letters following. Happy birthday. Love.  Spiegel led two more missions after making it back to England, though since he had been presumed dead, his belongings had already been sent to New York.  Spiegel returned home on Aug. 31, 1945.  He was given a heros welcome in his home on West 11th Street. Times Square had become an all-night party where military men were gods. Yet despite his 35 missions and multiple awards for bravery and exemplary behavior, Spiegel went to war as a first lieutenant and returned as one.  Looking back, having spoken to other Jewish GIs, he believes now that many Jewish soldiers were denied promotions because of antisemitism. He has some thorny memories: Many heroes in the Army Air Corps joined the commercial airline industry after the war, which was then based in New York. But here too, Spiegel said he faced discrimination. They werent taking Jews after World War II, he recalled. They were blatant.  Frankie Marie Spiegel joined him in New York for several months before they moved back to New Mexico. Spiegel got a job there as a radio announcer on a country and western program. (He went by the name of Muddy Boots.) But the marriage soon soured. They had no children, and he made a clean break, returning East.  It was a vibrant time in Greenwich Village, and he joined Pete Seegers Good Neighbor Chorus after the war and made new friends. And in midsummer of 1949, he went to Camp Unity, a leftist camp in Wingdale, New York.  Within hours he met a young woman named Motoko Ikeda. She was an artsy girl in pigtails, and he was fascinated by her. She was frank about her time in an internment camp during the war. It was eye-opening.  Her parents were born in Japan, and her family of six, she told him, had been forcibly sent from Los Angeles to a camp in Wyoming. At 14, she was kept behind barbed wire and watched by armed guards. After the war, many Japanese Americans held in the camps went back to California. Ikeda chose a one-way ticket to New York.  Motoko was mental refreshment after divorce, Spiegel says now. I liked her because she was pretty, bright, patient and a good person. I wanted to learn more about her.  They married in the Municipal Building around Thanksgiving in 1950, and a daughter, Kazuko, the first of their three children, was born in 1951. His blended family was accepted without reservation by his parents. Motoko was better at Jewish food than my mother. She could cook in any language.  Still frozen out of aviation, Spiegel went to vocational school and found a job as a machinist at a brush manufacturer in Mount Vernon for $1.80 an hour.  It was at the Westchester factory that his luck turned.  A strange design fad hit the country in the late 1950s: Shop designers were using millions of small multicolored brushes, which when assembled in department store windows looked, in his words, like miniature pastel waves. American Brush Machinery, where Spiegel was employed, fabricated machines to make these brushes, which could sell for $12,000 each  sound money, but then the fad died.  His bosses decided to repurpose the machines: They could make Christmas trees. The first ones they produced, out of green polyvinyl chloride plastic, didnt look much like Scotch pines. Business was slow. Midcentury America liked futuristic aluminum trees lit by color wheels, and few people owned fake trees at all. Spiegel, by then a senior machinist, was sent to close the factory, but he reported back there was big money to be made. One boss thought he was out of his mind, but the other gave him his own division, called American Tree and Wreath.  Determined to improve on his product, Spiegel brought in real trees to study. He tinkered with his machines to speed up the process, and soon he was selling quickly made and perfectly shaped fakes.  By the mid-1970s, Spiegels company, American Tree and Wreath, was producing about 800,000 trees a year, one off the assembly line every four minutes.  After expanding and starting his own artificial tree company, he finally sold that business and retired in 1993 as a multimillionaire.  He had been a workaholic, and now he wanted to travel with Motoko and enjoy life. She had become an accomplished painter and was inspired by new places, from Paris to Japan. But after her sudden death in 2000, Spiegel found himself drawn powerfully to military reunions and the company of veterans.  He became involved in a couple of Army Air Corps historic associations, enjoying the camaraderie of the airmen, who understood his night terrors and late-diagnosed PTSD. These society gatherings continued in dwindling numbers until about 2012. Now, as far as he knows, he is the only member from World War II.  Eventually, his daughter Kazuko Spiegel introduced her father to the woman who would become his third wife, JoAnn Bastis, a real estate agent she had met in Westchester social circles. They would be married only for a few years before she died in 2018, though the couple traveled in Europe together twice, including a visit to Reczyn, the tiny village where he belly-landed in 1945.  Spiegel now lives in a large apartment building with a doorman and a magnificent view of Central Park. Although artificial trees descended from Spiegels designs are found in close to three-quarters of the American homes that put up Christmas trees, he doesnt keep a tree himself.  He raised his children to take pride in their Jewish-Japanese heritage, and he still makes the Hanukkah latkes for his grandchildren. But when his children were young, they always had a tree, first a real one, and then the best of his fakes. Do you think Christmas trees were really a religious symbol? They were pagan symbols. My kids liked them.  When asked what he would like his legacy to be  artificial trees or military heroism  he closed his eyes.  The war, he admits, was probably the most exciting time in his life. Whos left to talk about it with, though?  I can tell you this, he finally said. We fought against fascism. We fought against Hitlers desire for a master race.  He is surrounded by pictures of his children and his grandchildren, and he worries about growing racism. I never thought that fascism was a possible threat to our nations democracy until now, Spiegel said. Right now, however, all Im trying to do is stay alive.","He bombed the Nazis, outwitted the soviets and modernized Christmas",POTATO

The current buzzword in the wellness circuit is the pegan plan, which includes 75 percent vegetables and 25 percent high-quality meat. And it is for the inveterate weightwatchers. Most of us are familiar with either of the two surrogates of the pegan planpaleo and vegan. Presented to the world by the US-based Cleveland Clinic doctor and bestselling author Dr Mark Hyman in 2015, the pegan diet supports a novel practice of nourishment by integrating the cores of the paleo diet with veganism. Astonishingly at the start, paleo and vegan diets seem to be an erratic combo in nature as the former is meat-based and the latter excludes any kind of animal product. Pegan inherits the best of both worldsplant-rich, whole foods, healthy fats with minimum processed foods, and reduced sugar and starch intake.  pexels.com  Understanding the Plan  Dr Hyman advocates nutritious plant foods low in sugar and starch and those which promote HDL (high-density lipid) or good fat like nuts and seeds, olive oil and avocados. Nutritionist Ritu Gupta, the founder of Nutrique, a New Delhi-based weight and health management portal, explains, The pegan diet focuses strongly on whole foods that are plant-based and discourages eating conventionally farmed meats or eggs.  Instead, it places emphasis on grass-fed, pasture-raised sources of poultry, and whole eggs. It does help reduce inflammation and maintain blood sugar levels naturally for a healthier you. Anisha Arora Chopra, a 37-year-old dentist from Raipur, who found it difficult to follow it in the initial stages, testifies the beneficial effects of this regimen. After a month into the pegan diet, it felt amazing. I saw many changes, some of which were that I lost six kilos in two months. My anxiety attacks stopped occurring and I slept better, she states. Chopra says that her blood sugar levels are in better control without any medicines,  she can focus better on work and personal life, and is an overall happier person now.  The Nutritional Gap  There is no definition of an ideal diet. Every eating habit we have comes with its own set of advantages and disadvantages. Nutraceutical Formulation expert and the founder of supplement brand PRO2FIT, Saurabh Shah answers: Essentially, every diet choice we make needs to be supplemented well to avoid lack of nutrient deficiency. Vegans usually find it difficult to meet their daily protein, calcium, Vitamin B12 needs. It becomes necessary to complement it with the right kind of supplements so that the deficiency of these is met to avoid complications.  Starch is an essential part of our diet as they provide energy to the body. Avoiding any particular macro-nutrient from the diet is not advisable. Everything, when eaten in proportion, serves its purpose in the body and the same applies to starch and carbs. Carbs (starch, fibre, sugar) are a good source of energy, iron, Vitamin B, provided it is not processed, advises Shah.  Chefs Take  Unlike vegan, its not featured in restaurant menus yet but awareness among chefs is created by requests for preparations with specific ingredients. Ganesh Chandrakant Teli, the Executive Chef at The Leela Palace Jaipur, who innovated sweet potato burritos and shrimp with zucchini noodles on a guests request, says, It can be compared to the very popular Mediterranean dietfresh and organic ingredients, heart-friendly, obesity-controlled and aids in keeping disorders at bay.  The pegan diet is trending as it allows vegans to have animal products in moderation. It broadens their dietary choices, and lowers the chance of developing deficiencies. This is something Indians have been following since long, concludes Dietician Rajat Jain, founder of Health Wealth Diet Clinic.

Unlike the popular belief, its not just about Indian-Chinese cuisine. The pop-up that ends this Sunday showcases Kolkatas distinctive cosmopolitan culinary convergence.  Delhi-based The Tangra Project, a restaurant presents the food of Kolkata in a different light and beyond the usual suspects like dab chingri, murgir jhol, cholar dalna etc. This restaurant brings under its roof all the flavours of Kolkata including puchka, shrimp paturi, gondraj fish and chives dumpling, and an array of Anglo-Indian specialities.  Curated by Chef Vikramjit Roy, the founder of The Tangra Project, the menu for the pop-up is designed to cater to all palates. Mughlai food to Anglo-Indian specialities, from classic Bengali dishes to famous Indian-Chinese inspired by the Hakka community who migrated to India, we serve them all. The handcrafted menu features meals and expertly picked delicacies from Kolkatas major culinary areas, he explains.  Vikramjit also says, The Tangra Project is a structured balance of cuisine and nostalgia. Every element of the restaurant brings to the forefront, my love for Kolkata culture and the fact that food is ingrained in the anatomy of the city. Its like the circle of life for me.  What can one expect at The Tangra Project pop up? To begin with there are some dishes that will leave the diner in awe with the selection of ingredients and combination. For example, when a beautiful roll that looked like the cham cham was presented in a creamy sauce I was taken aback thinking this pop-up serves dessert first. This, until I dug my fork in it. It turned out to be a tightly blanched palak roll in a creamy sauce of sesame and poppy seeds. It wasnt something I tasted before. The surprise elements in the menu didnt just stop there. There was guacamole made from parvel, it was served with air-fried plantain and sweet potato chips. This was a game-changer like the spinach roll.  The other dishes that followed had an element of Kolkatas food fusion. They include murrel dimsum with gondhoraj lebu. Sunday Mutton Curry with jhur jhuri aloo, kancha lonkar mugrir jhol with chilli oil paratha.  The murrel dimsum for fish lovers will be a winner. The Sunday Mutton Curry with jhur jhuri aloo was a revelation. The crunch from the crispy fried potato with the gravy of mutton curry was a lovely combination.  This pop-up is a cut above the rest and needs every food lovers attention so that they can stop relating Bengali food with just sorshe bata ilish, kosha mangsho and cholar daal.

Theres no reason that you cant make Christmas a special occasion  one that celebrates family, friends, and all thats really important.  Getty Images  The Christian festival celebrating the birth of Jesus Christ goes by many namesNavidad in Spanish, Natale in Italian, Nol in French, Weihnachten in German  but it is synonymous with one theme: joy to the world. Modern holiday customs include completing an Advent calendar, Christmas music and carolling, church services, a special meal, and gift giving.  Not to be forgotten are the many ways Christmas impacts homes  the plethora of decorations, including Christmas trees, lights, wreaths, garlands, mistletoe, holly, and nativity scenes, completely transform spaces into winter wonderlands. Try these ideas to add cheer to each and every corner of your home.  Winterise the entryway  Begin by clearing out the clutter  tip out all that you dont need (donate things you havent used in a while), and bring in a bench so no one has to hop as they pull on their boots.  Give a coir rug a Christmassy flavour by stamping simple white trees (paint and a potato block work well). Add other elements  a green garland, a set of pillar candles or pinecones nestled in a bed or tinsel, or a handmade wreath. A set of poinsettias standing guard by the doorway will hint that Christmas is here.  Make way for the green  What would the festival be without a Christmas tree? A tree works as the focal point of your living room, and decorating it is part of the tradition.  Skip the routine decorations available in the market and invest in glass, mercury, or wood ornaments  they look much better and can be recycled year after year.  Getty Images  The tree isnt the only green that should be seen  bring in fresh greens and create garlands, wreaths, or simply clip up boughs to hangers/bannisters/curtain rods. If youre short of fresh greens, DIYing your own paper garland  complete with holly berries  adds a quirky touch. Adding a metallic garland and glittery pillar candles to fresh greens create a glamorous tabletop setting.  Bring out the red  The bubbly, sure, but dont forget to bring home the colour thats synonymous with Santa Claus.  Getty Images  There are numerous ways that you can use this bright colour  festive pillows, plaid throws, stockings, wreaths with berries, candles, Christmas tree decorations, rugs, and more. Incorporating pops of plaid helps boost the living room's cozy factor. Try wrapping books with leftover wrapping paper in shades of red and vibrant prints to add a novel touch.

Vegetables of various kinds are now available in the markets with the prices crashing by almost half. The price of cauliflower has fallen to Rs 20 per piece against Rs 40 a few days back. Similarly, the price of brinjal which was Rs 30 per kg has now gone down to Rs 15 per kg. The price of pumpkin and tomato has gone down too.  The prices of several vegetables have crashed by as much as 50 per cent. But prices of onion and potato are not falling. We hope within two weeks the prices of potato and onion will crash, said Ajit Behera of Garapur.  While the reduction in price of vegetables may have brought cheer to consumers, the same cannot be said about the farmers who are suffering due to high fertiliser and irrigation costs this year, said Sarada Dalei, a farmer of Rajnagar.  Sangram Sahoo of Patkura said several traders from Cuttack, Bhubaneswar and other areas procure vegetables from the local markets at throwaway prices and sell them at malls for a premium.  Exploitation by middlemen is rampant in vegetable trade as farmers always look to dispose of their produce at the earliest, he said.",Consumers breathe easy as vegetable prices crash in Odisha,POTATO

A few singular New York power dining rooms opened new locations in Miamiamong them, the Italian American hotspot Carbone and Cote, the buzzy Korean steakhousebut thats just one reason for its ascendancy from South Beach party scene to culinary destination.  The city represents much more than a retreat for bankers setting up shop in Wall Street south. The new spots exude the culinary diversity to be found at every price point in Miami, whether its Middle Eastern breakfast specialists, groovy Vietnamese dining, or outstanding sushi.  This year, Miami also welcomed the Michelin Guide, which announced it would start bestowing stars on the city in 2022; its only the fifth U.S. destination to be graced by the tiremakers restaurant rating wing.  It seems like every day there's a new restaurant opening in Miami, observes Niven Patel, chef of the modern American restaurant Orno. A lot of the new restaurant action is happening in the Design District. The 18-square-block area, already home to design stores and art galleries, has become a favorite of luxury fashion retailers, with the first freestanding Louis Vuitton mens store in the U.S. having just opened and Chanel investing more than $40 million in a flagship store.  The Design District is also the place to find terrific Nikkei cuisine at Itamae, which serves some of the citys most scintillating fresh fish. The first brick-and-mortar location for pandemic success story Old Gregs Pizza is here, too. Dough expert Greg Tetzner and his partner Jackie Richie became famous for their square pies after they couldnt make round pies in their home oven. Now, customers will be able to choose either with the duos famed OG roni/pepperoni topping.  Read on to learn more about the 13 places where the citys best chefs hang out when theyre not cooking in their own homes or professional kitchens.  El Turco  Tables are packed with dishes of varying colours, flavours, and textures at chef Vural Aydogans vibrant Turkish cafe. Everything in this little shop is delicious, from the Turkish coffee to the freshly made pastries and bread, says Michelle Bernstein. You can see the chef preparing everything daily.  Turco is open all day, but Bernstein recommends it for morning people like herself. I would absolutely go for the Turkish breakfast platter that has something for everyone, she says. The restaurants specialty includes fresh baked bread, homemade jams, a variety of cheeses, and steak tomatoes. It really feels like your grandma is cooking for you. Recommended by Michelle Bernstein, chef-owner of Caf La Trova and Michelle Bernstein Catering  Cote  In a Design District building whose entrance suggests a spaceship, this Korean steakhouse has a high-octane vibe and USDA Prime steak menu, like its Manhattan flagship. My favorite restaurant this year, says chef Valerie Chang. They just bring it, from their immaculate hospitality to their dishes that are pungent with flavor. You cant help but feel excited as you exit that hallway and enter the restaurant and feel the vibe. The kimchi stew and janchi somyun (angel hair in broth) from chef David Shim are among Changs favorite dishes. Recommended by Valerie Chang, chef-owner of Itamae and B-side by Itamae  Tran An  At this Vietnamese hotspot in Little River, the room is decorated with huge, circular light fixtures and metallic animal heads. The place is named for chef-owner Jon Nguyens grandfather, who encouraged him to open a banh mi shop. Pubbelly chef Jos Mendin appreciates the overstuffed versions with such fillings as barbecued pork with maggi butter and char siu jackfruit with tofu mayonnaise. The flavors are authentic in a cool and playful way, says Mendin, who also shouts-out the green papaya salad and chicken pho. Recommended by Jos Mendin, chef and co-founder of Pubbelly Restaurant Group  Leku  The restaurant at the Rubell Museum has a terrific al fresco vibe, whether youre sitting in the plant-filled outdoor patio or the airy white dining room. The menu brings me back to Basque Country, says Cerveceria La Tropical chef Cindy Hutson. The croquetas are amazingly creamy and crisp outside. The beet tartare is very balanced with acidity and flavor; I am not a vegan, but I order it every time we go. Alongside Mikel Goikoleas starters are a selection of entrees such as bacalao, or confit cod, and 50-day, dry-aged, bone-in rib-eye. The cocktails are inspired, with an emphasis on macerated gins in such flavors as basil and strawberry, with a choice of tonics. Recommended by Cindy Hutson, executive chef at Cerveceria La Tropical  Eleventh Street Pizza  As a New Yorker spending large amounts of time in Miami these days, [I find that] Eleventh Street Pizza is serving an elevated version of the classic New York style pie, says Major Food Groups Mario Carbone. The brainchild of David Foulquier and Danielle Hultman, the pizzeria has whole-pie options, as well as by the slice, including the Carmine, a cheese pie on blistered crust. The pepperoni has a top dominated by little sausage cups, Calabrian chile paste, and honey. Recommended by Mario Carbone, chef and co-founder, Major Food Group  Uchi Miami  The outpost of chef Tyson Coles sushi spot in Wynwood has an unconventional menu much like the one at the place he started in Austin, Texas. In Miami, the busy kitchen is overseen by Dina Butterfield. Leku chef Mikel Goikolea applauds the innovation. The akami of bigeye is a surprising combination of sliced tuna with a housemade granola of assorted seeds baked with agave and miso, dressed with a balanced light aji amarillo sauce; and the pork belly comes with toasted kabocha squash in a sweet pepper gastrique. Recommended by Mikel Goikolea, executive chef-partner, Leku  Luca Osteria  This casual spot in Coral Gables Giralda Plaza takes its pasta seriously. Chef Giorgio Rapicavoli makes the shapes in-house and serves such preparations as pappardelle with short rib Bolognese and mortadella butter. Niven Patel, chef of nearby Orno, is excited about the restaurant: Chef Giorgio offers a rotating menu based off of what is fresh and in season, which is important to me. He loves Rapicavolis pasta al limone, made with the ribbon-shaped mafaldine. He tops the pasta with lemon sauce, a 24-month aged parmigiano reggiano, and a little bit of black pepper. The dish showcases the lemon, which balances the salty flavors of the cheeseits bright and delicious. Recommended by Niven Patel, chef and owner of Orno  Abbal Telavivian Kitchen  In a sunny cottage on Miami Beach, this cafe features specialties from the Middle East and the Mediterranean. For me, the combined flavors and spices used in dishes from Israel, Turkey, Greece are unparalleled, says Michael Schwartz of Miamis foundational restaurant Michaels Genuine, who worked with Abbal chef Sam Gorenstein. They influence my cooking. He adds: The Moroccan garbanzos, roasted beets, and sumac chicken shashlik are the winners. I paired my meal with the La Vie Blanc from Jerusalem. At lunch are housemade pita sandwiches; brunch features a terrific shakshuka with Jerusalem bagel. Recommended by Michael Schwartz, chef/restaurateur, Genuine Hospitality Group  Itamae  Positioned amid the luxury stores in the Design District is the vibrant Itamae, where the flavor-packed food is served on tin Peruvian plates. I love this Nikkei restaurant from chefs Nando and Valerie Chang, says chef Makoto Okuwa. They are incredibly talented, and the way they are presenting Japanese and Peruvian cuisine to Miami is inventive and delicious. He cites standouts baby romaine with shiso green goddess dressing; fluke tiraditofish served sashimi style in a spicy saucewith murasaki potato and corn nuts; and cremolada, the Peruvian slushie containing starfruit, mango, and makrut lime leaf. Recommended by Makoto Okuwa, executive chef, Makoto  Zitz Sum  The menu at Zitz Sum mashes up inspired dim sumpork potstickers, enlived with Calabrian chil, or seared brisket bao with ginger jam hoisinwith such plates as karaage (Japanese fried chicken) and tamarind-glazed chicken cooked over Japanese charcoal. I love Zitz Sum because you can feel the passion chef Pablo [Zitzmann] has for his food, says Dallas Wynne. This project really shines through after he was selling dumplings through social media during the pandemic. Then it blossomed into this hybrid of dumpling and izakaya. Recommended by Dallas Wynne, pastry chef-partner, Toothfairy Bakery  Sushi Yasu Tanaka  Helmed by former Azabu corporate sushi chef Yasu Tanaka, this high-level fish spot is located in the middle of MIA food hall in the Design District. Tanaka serves up perfect nigiri and appetizer plates, says Luciana Giangrandi. He sources great fish, and cooks and seasons his rice perfectly. You can get the same food as a $300 omakase for less than a third of that, and he and his team still provide courteous and attentive service, despite being in a food hall. An eight-piece nigiri platter with options such as o-toro, salmon, and hamachi goes for $38; a la carte options including charcoal aburi toro and double-smoked salmon are available, too. Recommended by Luciana Giangrandi, chef and co-founder of Boia De restaurant  Old Gregs Pizza  After selling inspired sourdough-crusted pies at pop-ups during the pandemic, chef Greg Tetzner and partner Jackie Richie have created a brick-and-mortar location in the Design District, with such pies as Shroomz with maitake and oyster mushrooms and wild ramp salsa verde. Old Gregs Pizza was one of the first to hype natural leavened square dough, says Timon Balloo. His favorite order is classic pepperoni with basil and cheese. Recommended by Timon Balloo, partner at Sugarcane Raw Bar Grill and chef-owner at the upcoming Katherine  Hiyakawa  In a dramatic dining room with an undulating wooden ceilingthe space looks like a futuristic movie set from the streetchef Masayuki Komatsu specializes in serving both classic and modern sushi interpretations and dishes such as chawan-mushi, the steamed egg custard, with uni or A5 wagyu nigiri. When I want to spoil myself and my wife, this is the perfect place, says chef Cesar Zapata. The sushi is pristine and perfectly executed. We go for the omakase to get the chefs full experience.

2022-01-15,https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/art-culture/thats-a-mouthful-a-look-at-the-science-behind-quick-meals-101642250833789.html,"Food tech advancements help feed astronauts on space stations and folks on Earth who are hungry at 3 am. Weve figured out ways to keep milk fresh for months, cook rice faster, and dehydrated mummys pav bhaji so itll last through lonely semesters abroad. Here are some of the processes behind the most common preserved foods.  Dehydration: Every culture in history has figured out that leaching moisture from a food item can make it last longer. This began as a way to preserve certain foods through ingredient-scarce winters or during long journeys. Sundried tomatoes, air-dried fruit and cured fish and meats all started out this way. Electric and microwave dryers use the same principle to create soup mixes, noodle garnishes, long-life spice and trail mixes. Some dehydrated foods, raisins for instance, can last years if properly dehydrated.  Spray-drying: Used most commonly for milk and coconut milk powder, it exposes the liquid to a blast of hot gas to quickly let the moisture (but not the fat) evaporate, leaving a fine-particle powder behind. Dried eggs, instant coffee, fruit juice and honey powders and flavourings are made in much the same way, and shelf lives range from weeks to years.  Freeze-drying: High-tech, but really simple. Food is frozen to a low temperature to turn its moisture into ice. The water is then sublimated, turning the ice directly into vapour that is sucked away. Whats left is room-temperature food that retains most of its nutrients, with taste, colour and shape intact too. Most freeze-dried foods can last years. This method is most commonly used for fresh fruit and vegetables, and pet food.  Flash-freezing: As the name suggests, fresh food, fish or meat is put into an air- or brine-based freezer. Commercial versions do the freezing in as little as two minutes. Speed is essential; it prevents the food from forming ice crystals that might break down its cellular structure, compromising on flavour and texture, and drying it out. Most flash-freezing is done immediately after harvest, yielding foods that are fresher than the ones sitting on supermarket shelves.  Reconstituted food: These are the dried foods that you just add water to to revive. Think of preserved mushrooms, instant oats, noodles. Potato reconstitutes well too  its what makes mashed-potato mixes and instant-aloo-sabzi kits so popular in fast-food kitchens. Most packages last 18 months.  Irradiation: This no-heat process can kill bacteria, mold and pests that would have made fresh meats and farm produce rot faster. The World Health Organization and Food and Agriculture Organization have declared it to be safe. But there arent enough studies on the long-term effect of this ionising method on humans, so several countries, particularly those in the European Union, prohibit its use.  Retort: The tech was developed in the US to feed astronauts during long spells in space. Theres no heat, no chemicals, no exposure to gas, just filtered water and extreme pressure. Cooked food is sealed in flexible, multilayer pouches and sterilised under pressure (in a process called Pascalization) to destroy microorganisms but retain nutrients. Food in these pouches can last more than a year at room temperature. It started out being better suited for Western food  oils and spices dont take well to the process. But recipes for biryani and curries have since been developed, allowing for more diversity.  Modified atmosphere: Another way to preserve food is to replace or deplete the oxygen around it. Oxygen helps microbes grow; in preservation, the less of it there is, the better. This is why salad greens are often packed with dry ice at the bottom, slowly increasing carbon dioxide levels in the container. Its why food is vacuum-packed. And why potato-chip packets are inflated with nitrogen.  Ultra-Pasteurisation: Sure, boiling milk makes it last longer. But new dairy processes take it a step further. They boil milk to 137 Celsius for just a few seconds and then rapidly cool it, which kills more bacteria. This, along with sterile packaging, creates long-life milk, which can last six months outside a refrigerator, unopened.",That’s a mouthful!: A look at the science behind quick meals,POTATO

Its a mans best friend for a chilly winter night. But have you tried lemon rasam and that too made using masoor dal? Well, Bengaluru-based Teena Augustine has a handful of unique recipes like lemon rasam that she invented in her kitchen in the past few years. Though counsellor by profession, the Kochi-native is an ardent food lover, and also a recipe curator and food blogger. Her social media page, Ooonuready, is a testament to her love for fusion and unique delicacies.  Rich purple mashed organic sweet potatoes sautd in ghee with a dash of milk, cardamom, desiccated coconut and sugar rolled in the shape of laddoo is one of her drool-worthy creations. The almond flakes give it a nutty taste. I started to post recipes and photos of my culinary inventions seven years ago, Teena says. According to her, sweet potato halwa and laddoo have natural sweetness so they can be served without the sugar too.  Teenas experiments were influenced by her childhood spent in Kuwait. Our neighbours included Pakistanis, Philippinos and Indian communities like Kashmiris, Maharashtrians and others. There was a myriad of cultures and cuisines there and they influenced my culinary journey, says Teena.  Her recent hit recipe was the veldt grape chutney aka devils backbone chutney. Teena also has recipes on medicinal dishes and her changalamparanda chutney is one among them. The youngster who is a PhD holder from IIT Madras started to explore the medicinal dishes more to prepare a healthy menu for her mother who is diabetic. Two years ago, my mother was diagnosed with a blood clot in her brain. The doctor directed me to give her six-course meals a day. So I started to prepare unique fusion dishes for her, Teena says. Her invention of devils backbone chutney was quite an accident.  I bought devils backbone plant thinking of it was a cactus. Later I found its medicinal values and tried to create similar dishes using Brahmi which is good for the brain. Bhrahmi-nellikka-panikoorkka pachadi is another dish. Recently I have prepared payasam using aloe vera pulp as it is more like thick ada pradhaman, and healthy for digestion, says Teena.  Custard apple pudding, green gram dosa, pineapple puttu, beetroot payasam, strawberry pickle, corn halwa etc are a few worthy mentions from her recipe list. She has also widely explored the varieties of one of Malayalis favourite breakfasts, idli. Chiblu idli made using a bamboo basket, kanjeepuram kovil idli and beetroot idli are her way to lure her seven-year-old daughter to the breakfast table.  For me, life is popcorn inside the pressure cooker. Cooking soothes our minds. It is like problem-solving. Instead of throwing away the messed up dish, I figure out what went wrong and how to rectify it to a tasty offering, Teena explains.",Healthy experiments to do in the kitchen,POTATO

The cook works a slicer through peeled raw bananas at top speed. Thin discs of fruit fall in rapid succession into a container below. Then, they are dropped with a flourish into a giant wok of boiling coconut oil. As the golden-yellow chips crisp up, they are scooped out with a large perforated ladle, and tossed in the air for a microsecond before being laid out on a tray. One cannot help but marvel at the chip-makers skill.  For anyone who has grown up in Kerala, this is a familiar sight. The Malayalis relationship with banana chips is unquestionable, not even potato in its fancy versions has been able to replace it. However, to appeal to a wider, and younger audience, the classic banana chips are now being reinterpreted.  A spicy twist  Alappuzha-based startup Beyond Snacks has come out with banana chip flavours such as peri-peri, salt and black pepper, and sour cream, onion and parsley. The idea was to give the time-tested snack a global makeover, says Manas Madhu, director of Beyond Snacks. Attempting to contemporise banana chips did seem daunting initially, but we wanted to show that it could be a lot more than just banana chips, he adds.  The team tried out a variety of flavours before narrowing it down to a few. The spiciness of peri peri worked really well, sour cream too complemented the original flavour; but tomato fell flat, Manas adds.  As an experiment, the team set up a stall at a popular consumer fair in the State and their chips were an instant hit. We had to keep getting more stock as the demand was huge. This is when we were sure that there is scope for innovation, Manas says.  The company, which launched its banana chips in 2020, now has a manufacturing unit in Kalamassery, Kochi, and is a prominent presence on e-retail platforms delivering across the country. More flavours will be rolled out soon, such as barbecue, North Indian and sweet and sour. It retains the original style classic salted version, too.  Malabar Masala flavour brought out by A1 Chips, Coimbatore | Photo Credit: Special Arrangement  In Bengaluru, PR Heaven Chips has launched five new flavours developed in-house: biryani, noodles, cheese, black pepper and tomato. While biryani is aimed at an older demographic, the noodles and cheese versions appeal to younger people and children, says Anish Swaminath, general manager of PR Heaven Chips. Unlike potato, banana has a very distinct flavour. So the new flavour should complement it, he adds.  Anish continues, Though banana chips are a Malayali staple, we seem to consume potato and tapioca chips more than banana, perhaps because we have always shied away from contemporising it. Launched in November 2021, PR Heaven Chips has its manufacturing unit in Thrissur and will soon be sold through distributors in the State and supermarkets.  Delhi-based Motherland Aromatic South has tied up with the 55-year-old, Coimbatore-based traditional chips maker A1 Chips to bring in a twist to tradition. Banana chips with the flavour of curry leaves, thin chips with rock salt and sweet ripe ones are the versions sold online. We wanted to give a gourmet aesthetic to banana chips and tap into another socio-economic bracket, says Devika Mohan, brand manager. It has been available online across the country for the past two years and the response has been great, she adds.  The nendran variety of bananas works the best for chips, say the brands, as cavendish varieties may be lacking in flavour. Most companies now have automated machinery that makes the chips. Even the frying time is controlled.  Traditional players  Now, even traditional players are welcoming change. A1 Chips has over 11 flavours, including chilli masala, Malabar masala, salsa masala, sweet chilli, pepper, aloo tandoori and honey for a sweet touch. It is all about adapting to newer tastes. Banana chips are our signature product, and anything we add to it only improves its value, says Sudeesh Dhamodaran, joint managing director of A1 Chips. The brand has 53 outlets in various parts of South India, all of which have these varieties. Sudeesh, however, loves to eat original Kerala banana chips dipped in lime pickle. It is the best, he says.  Abhirami N, managing partner of N Vasudevan Banana Chips and Halwa in Kozhikode, says the business gives ample scope for experimentation, but demand is still more for the conventional salted banana chips. However, there are two variations  pepper and chilli  that are available. When she took over the 45-year-old family business started by her father, Abhirami realised that a lot of factors go into the perfection of the final product. We still use coconut husk in the traditional stove where the chips are made; I believe all this adds to the taste of the product, she says.",Banana chips get a global makeover,POTATO

For any Bengalurean, this is a match made in heaven. It's a classic combination that many devour irrespective of the time of day. However, theres a new version of the masala dosae trending on social media - one with ice cream. And Bengalureans are furious about this unusual mash up.  This social media innovation that has gone viral has a street vendor mashing the masala dosae on a cold stone with vanilla ice cream and converting it into a brand new flavour. Naveen Suresh, food blogger known as bangaloreepicure, is popular for recommending street vendors across the city, but he cant seem to grasp the idea of this combo.  He says, ""It's ridiculous! The combination is so weird. We've always had fusion food available but this is just disrespecting the humble dosae."" He points out that a crepe is probably a better choice to add ice cream to.  ""Crepe is already sweet and toppings can be added along with any flavour of ice cream. Maybe using that on a cold stone to recreate a new version of ice cream makes sense. Masala dosae, on the other hand, is a savoury dish and to convert it into a sweet one like this is unacceptable,"" adds Suresh, who has tried a similar combo on RV Road. ""I swore not to try it again,"" he says.  A hotspot among Bengalureans is Vidyarthi Bhavan in Basavanagudi. Owner Arun Adiga, upon hearing about the masala dosae trend, had one thing to say, ""Yuck"". ""There's a lot of innovations happening in the food industry. It's a good thing to experiment because people do tend to get bored with the same thing all the time. But what's the point if it doesnt taste good?"" he wonders.  Adiga says that changing the temperature of the food it's meant to be in takes away from its originality. ""I strongly feel that some things should not be experimented with or it will turn into a mess. Masala dosae is meant to be had hot out of the tawa and not as a cold dish,"" he opines.  Software consultant  Rishabh Waykole recalls how he stopped scrolling Instagram when he saw the ice cream video. ""As someone who enjoys some yummy masala dosae, this was horrifying to watch and know that people are actually purchasing it.
