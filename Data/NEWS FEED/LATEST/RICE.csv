The concrete barricades, thorny iron fences and powerful water cannons have not been able to prevent their tractor trollies from reaching the vicinity of the national capital. They have been so determined and prepared that the Delhi winter has failed before them. Assembled in their thousands, they have established a new way of life at Singhu, Tikri, Ghazipur, Noida and Shahjahanpur. In some manner, the upsurge by these farmers resembles the Occupy Wallstreet Movement in the United States, in 2011, whose slogan reverberates even today across the world: We are the 99 percent.Unflinching willpowerThe government might have thought that the farmers would retreat to their villages after a couple of days or a week at the most, but this is not the mood at all among the farmers. As a frequent visitor to one or the other centres of struggle, this writer would definitely say that this farmers struggle is unique in the history of free India. A self-contained lifestyle with all necessary arrangements for food, shelter, clothing, and sanitation are in place. Scores of them, young and old, with whom this writer could interact with, represent the unflinching will of a people who consider agriculture as their culture. Their utmost proximity to soil and nature has tempered them as steel, while helping them remain calm and cool at the same time.Farmers protest | Farmers to escalate protest if deadlock continues on January 4The firefighters in the government who talk in different terms (may be purposefully), might have prepared their own strategy to face this struggle of the annadatas. Some of them say that the doors of dialogue are always kept open. There are certain others who are stubborn in saying that there can be no compromise on the implementation of the three Farm Bills. There are also those who still promise to take a relook if necessary, but only after two years. There is no need to ponder on this as most of these officials have been trained in a certain ideological school. As part of their campaign of malignment, the propaganda managers have labelled the farmers Khalistanis and urban naxalites.But these sons and daughters of the soil, who sow the seeds of hope to feed their fellow beings, have maintained inimitable self-restraint. Their struggle, their unity, their patience, and the massive nature of their battle are having an impact on the cohesive nature of the ruling alliance, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA). Following in the footsteps of NDA ally, the Shiromani Akali Dal that walked out of the NDA in support of the farmers, the Rashtriya Loktantrik Party has also snapped its ties with the alliance. Another important party that shares power with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Haryana continues to remain unhappy with the central governments approach to the farmers issues.The Narendra Modi government expected the farmers to tire out and slowly retreat from the battlefront. But it is mistaken. The determination by the farmers to go on with the struggle is only strengthening by the day. The Prime Minister himself has come forward to lead a frontal attack on the annadatas. Recently, he minced no words in expressing his disappointment while accusing the struggle of being a politically motivated one. The thrust of his attack was evident when he criticised the Opposition as misleading the farmers and shooting from their shoulders to target the government. In this tirade, the Prime Minister pointed a finger against the Left-led government in Kerala.Farmers protests | Ready to celebrate Lohri at the borders, but theres no going back now, say farmersThe situation in KeralaAll the allegations that he has levelled against the Kerala government are unfounded, and far from truth. In his exhortation that there are no Agricultural Produce Market Committees (APMCs) and mandis in Kerala, he presumed that the concept of the Minimum Support Price is not prevalent in the State. He has shut his eyes to the basic truth about the agricultural scenario in Kerala.It is true that mandis regulated by an APMC are not in existence in Kerala. But it does not mean that the interests of farmers are not taken care of in the State. In fact, Kerala is the State where farmers rights are being protected by the government itself, and much more effectively than any other Indian State.Also read | Do new agri Bills impact Kerala?While the government of India has fixed the procurement rate for rice at 18 a kg, the Left Democratic Front government in Kerala is procuring rice from cultivators at 27.48 a kg. In the same manner copra (dried coconut) is also procured at a much higher rate in Kerala than the price announced by the central government. Kerala is the State where increased basic price is ensured not only for paddy but also vegetables and fruits. Sixteen such items are enlisted by the government where the basic prices (per kg) are guaranteed. To cite some of them, tapioca (12), banana (30), garlic (139), pineapple (15), tomato (8), string beans (34), ladies fingers (20), cabbage (11) and potato (20).Apart from crop insurance, paddy cultivators will get the royalty in Kerala at the rate of 2,000 per hectare. They have a pension too, which is something unique in India. In 2006, when farmers suicides became the order of the day across the country, the Left Front government introduced a debt relief commission that extended a helping hand to the farmers, thereby saving them.Also read | Kerala Assembly passes resolution urging Centre to scrap farm lawsThere is basis for a counterNo BJP-led government in the country can even imagine the measures that the Left government in Kerala has initiated for the welfare of farmers. Instead of understanding those measures, the Prime Minister has chosen to train his political guns on the Kerala government and the farmers. The influence of corporates on his allegations is clear. The Left has the moral and political authority to engage in any polemics with the BJP-led central government in this regard.It is intriguing why the Prime Minister has never said a word about the experience of Bihar where mandis were abolished in 2006 and the plight of farmers that only worsened after this measure was initiated. After the three farm ordinances of June 2020, 40% of mandis in Madhya Pradesh have registered only zero transactions.Also read | Mandis not an option for Kerala: Agriculture MinisterThe corporate stampThis is the reality of the farm Bills. Though they claim to enable the protection and the empowerment of farmers, the truth is just the opposite. The purpose of these laws is the enabling of the corporatisation of Indian agriculture and the introduction of contract farming. When Ministers continue to assure the continuance of mandis they are practically pushed out of the scene, as it happened in Madhya Pradesh and elsewhere. The annadatas have been able to foresee the evil in the three farm laws that would eventually find them at the mercy of corporate profit mongers. They know that these laws would ruin the backbone of the agricultural economy and badly affect the food security of India.Also read | You are being misled, Narendra Modi tells farmersThe farmers are in the struggle in order to prevent such a calamity from happening. It is high time that the Prime Minister and his government understand the patriotic and selfless role being played by the food providers of the country and the genuine nature and cause of their struggle.Binoy Viswam is Secretary, CPI National Council, and leader of the party in Parliament.

If the air is cold and crisp, the food should be warm and soft. That explains why I have been countering this cold spell with steaming dim sums. I mentioned the mouth-watering momos I had last week, but now I must tell you about the delicious Prawn Har Gao dumplings (350) that did a jig in my heart a few days ago that came from Yang & Yum. The casing was delightfully thin and translucent; the filling was soft and warm.I had quite a few (with home-cooked broccoli soup), and then focused on the other appetisers from the eatery: fiery salmon sushi, Katsu chicken volcano (335 for four) and chicken and chives dumplings (295). I have always held that if you get your sushi right, you are on the correct track. These rolls were perfect: soft within, but with a mildly vinegary rice coating.The menu  with Japanese, Chinese, Burmese and Thai dishes  is an interesting mix, with dishes such as the Vietnamese pho, southeast Asian laksa and Burmese khao suey. I wanted to taste some of their Thai dishes, as I have been a diehard fan of the cuisine ever since I visited Thailand some years ago and discovered the unadulterated joy of its fish and meat dishes. I had Yang & Yums Chiang Mai banana leaf fish (475), Bang Bang chicken (395), diced chicken in black bean sauce (345) and minced chicken in Thai basil (345).I must admit that I was a bit nervous when I saw that two of the chicken dishes looked almost the same  dark in colour and thick in texture. But the tastes turned out to be remarkably different. The diced chicken consisted of chunks of chicken steamed in black bean sauce. It was pleasantly spicy, and I enjoyed it as much as I did the minced meat, which came wrapped in a sauce flavoured with basil leaves. The somewhat fiery Bang Bang chicken (crispy fried chicken in a hot and sweet sauce, a roadside favourite) was superb.The fish, however, was disappointing. The fillet marinated in a Thai curry paste came wrapped in a makroot leaf, but I felt the spices that the fillets had been coated with were a little raw.The outlet delivers food across Delhi and NCR (12 noon to 2 am; 7860000420).

There are options for vegetarians, too, including Thai curried veg dumplings (245), and Guangzhou mushroom and asparagus dumplings, flavoured with spicy chilli oil (275).Yang & Yum is good news.

In a study done on food eating habits, Professor Jayashankar Telangana State Agricultural University (PJTSAU) said that there has been a significant increase in the expenditure incurred on milk by the rural households, while expenditure incurred on non-vegetarian food has shown a considerable decrease.In the case of urban households, there is a significant rise in the amounts spent on groceries, fruits, milk and beverages after the lockdown was imposed in comparison to expenditure incurred before the lockdown. Milk consumption had gone up in rural households from Rs 900 per month to Rs 1,037 after the pandemic We undertook this study to observe the changing food eating patterns and to understand the preferences of consumers in terms of health consciousness and varied tastes. We will update this study along with our previous study reports, university vice chancellor Dr V Praveen Rao told TOI.Among the rural households, consumption of rice increased in the range of 3%-15% among various income groups. Whereas the increase among urban households with regard to rice ranged between 4% and 10%.Among the urban households, consumption of pulses (chana dal) went up between 7% and 17% during the lockdown.

Some had lost jobs, some a place of stay and scores of migrant workers were seen walking kilometres to reach their hometowns.When the Covid-induced lockdown cast a pall of gloom and robbed people of their livelihood, the challenges also brought out the best of humanity . Many residents of NCR accepted the ones in despair as their own. Hundreds of families came together to feed the migrant workers and students left stranded in the big city.It was a conversation between strangers on social media that started it off. On a Facebook page where athletes often discussed their upcoming running and cycling events, the talk veered towards the migrants plight.Shaurya Roy, a businessman, got in touch with Abhishek Mishra, an entrepreneur. Together, they visited slums in Saraswati Vihar , which has about 1,500 shanties, and interacted with daily wage labourers, construction workers and domestic helpers who had lost their jobs. The Facebook page soon became a platform for the athletes to contact each other on the ground when they were out to provide aid and food.Many of the workers wanted to leave for their hometowns as they feared running out of supplies. We counselled them and assured them they would get help. We have been in touch with them ever since and provided them food, Roy, a resident of DLF-5, said.People were not well-informed about the crisis and often missed the administrations announcements, Roy said, adding that they tried to bridge this gap.Sonal Pathak, who lives in Suncity Township, similarly joined hands with five other residents of the society in March to help out more than 1,000 migrant workers and labourers who had lost their jobs at construction sites around the Golf Course Road area.

Ironically, neighbours connect with each other more often and more meaningfully when staying connected takes some effort, not to mention some masks and some distance.At the height of the lockdown, strangers with shared common areas suddenly became truly neighbours. Community webinars led to pleasant discoveries of in-house talent. Youngsters carried supplies to seniors doorsteps, leading to inter-generational friendships. Doctors offered free consultations in their communities, adding a new layer of meaning to home care.Sometimes, the connection had a rare intensity to it. Lavanya Krishnakumars contribution slots into this category.The pandemic has made her the Anna Kendrick of her community. When she started a Drum Circle for her neighbours, she in fact used Annas immensely famous Cups song which is based on a folk classic When I am Gone. Originally from the musical comedy Pitch Perfect, it gained a breath of its own and more legs, when Anna reworked it into a single, which climbed up musical charts on both sides of the Atlantic.While Anna used papercups as drums for the song, Lavanya used cylindrical thingamajigs to suit her Drum-Circle drill.Lavanya explains that she would fill these cylindrical objects with rice and daal to create a shifting-and-shaking ssshh-ssshh, ssshh-ssshh sound and have it overlaid on the rhythm.Lavanya had done Arts-based Therapy (ABT) from Babu Trust in Pune, and that is where she got introduced to drumming as a therapeutic tool. She still considers herself a learner in ABT.Drumming or any other art form can meet a therapeutic need when it is used in conjunction with other tools such as counselling to fix a problem, she states, adding that it can however also be used to create an atmosphere of trust where a group comes together to create something together, and there is a sense of shared joy.It is this form of therapeutic need Lavanya sought to meet when she decided to have the first Drum Circle in December for her community, The Central Park South on Old Mahabalipuram Road.I had two African djembes, which were given to me as part of the course. Over that, we had some tambourines; and anything that I had picked up that could make sounds. It could include bells. I even had daal and rice put in a cylinder so that when I shake it up, it gives that ssshh-ssshh sound. I have a modest collection, and that is about how much I could collect in this amount of time, explains Lavanya.She asserts drumming is one activity that fires every nerve cell in your brain, and that it can benefit anybody, and be practised by anyone.When we went to do this course, none of us were drummers. We were not percussionists. The more we sat in a group and explored rhythm, we only realised that rhythm was already in us, says Lavanya, referring to the drum-circle component of the ABT course she undertook.On the Drum Circle drill conducted at her community, Lavanya elaborates, We followed all the COVID-19 norms; we had only ten people in the group, and we explored some rhythms.I would suggest a rhythm or a lead, which people would follow. We had what you call the start and stop cues. We had something called a rumble which we would build up to a crescendo.We did something that was already available, such as the Cups, a song from the musical comedy Pitch Perfect, which uses a papercup as a drum. There are so many derivatives of it, which people can go home and try out.The purpose of the Drum Circle is to get residents to collaborate through drumming as a creative pursuit.Each one now will explore their own rhythm. And also they can drum as a community, creating a nice synergy.It is not a performance, but just participation. There is no facilitator, only facilitators. Anyone can facilitate the drum circle. People took turns to facilitate the drum circle during the one hour, explains Lavanya.Supriya Santhanam, who coordinated the Drum Circle, points out, We would allow only ten people in a session to maintain COVID-19 prevention norms, and so there are people on a waiting list. They would be accommodated in subsequent Drum Circle gatherings, one of which is coming up around the Pongal season.Lavanya, who is founder-trustee of Golden Butterflies, a paediatric palliative care foundation, says the as part of the ABT programme, her first pilot project was with differently-abled children.She adds, There is a little school inside Loyola College called BLINK which is for children with special needs. My first pilot novice project of 20 hours was with them, and I organised a drum circle with them.All of them wanted to drum. There was a child with extremely limited mobility in one hand, but I held a bell, and she wanted to participate; all of them wanted to participate.",Have you tried ‘drumming together’ as a community?,RICE

Delhi had submitted its proposal on September 1. It is not understood how the government of NCT Delhi intends to utilise the foodgrains now and how it will benefit beneficiaries who have already been deprived of the foodgrains. Therefore, it is not feasible to consider the request for allocation of foodgrains for the first half of 2020-21 at this stage, it said.The request for allocation for the second half of 2019-20 has also been rejected, saying the Centre does not make retrospective allocation of foodgrains.For the period October 2020 and March 2021, 1.976 metric tonnes of wheat and 0.503 metric tonnes of rice have been allocated, the department said. For the first half of 2018-19, 42.53 MT wheat and 10.59 MT rice was allocated for Delhi.The Centre had in February and September 2020 also informed Delhi that the scheme will once again cover government-aided institutions and hostels as well, which was discontinued in March 2019, and sought details on the unspent balance of foodgrains.Asked for a comment, the Delhi Food Department, in a written statement, attributed the delay to administrative reasons, saying the proposal could not be finalised on time as the utilisation certificates from circle food safety officers were not cleared by the accounts branch.Explained Behind Centres push to carry out audits of scheme The Centre had urged states and UTs in the past to carry out regular audits of its Welfare Institutions and Hostel Scheme, citing the absence of detailed norms and criteria for allocation of foodgrains. It had pointed out that utilisation of the allocations made are often unmonitored. Even in this case, the delay in submitting proposals happened due to variations in utilisation certificates made by two different wings of the Delhi government. Delhi has several such homes, where the foodgrains are disbursed, such as After Care Home for Women, Bal Niketan, Widow Home at Nirmal Chaya Complex, Nari Niketan.As per guidelines, the Centre makes the allocation on a half-yearly basis, based on proposals from states and UTs, which are to be backed with utilisation certificates relating to the previous batch of allocation.There was considerable delay in providing utilisation certificates (UC) by the welfare institutions concerned as routine functioning in most of the departments/institutions was adversely affected due to Covid-19. There were also variations in UCs submitted by the departments officers. Moreover, the department was occupied with various food relief measures during the lockdown. Various new schemes such as Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana, Atma Nirbhar Bharat scheme, Mukhya Mantri Corona Shayata Yojana were announced to tackle the food security situation. Due to this, disposal of other routine matters could not be fast tracked or prioritised, the department told The Indian Express.No communication/instruction was received from the Government of India regarding functioning of the scheme during the Covid-19 outbreak or that any retrospective proposals will not be henceforth entertained by the ministry, it added.It said the Delhi government has written to the Centre again to reconsider its stand in view of the unprecedented circumstances and needs of the beneficiaries.","Proposal delayed, Delhi failed to get subsidised foodgrains for welfare homes",RICE

The gap between farm harvest prices and MSP for three major crops - paddy, wheat and maize - has either widened or remained at the same level.What's more, it appears that low harvest prices have caused agricultural wages in Bihar to remain suppressed as compared to Punjab and Haryana and resulted in labour migration from the state.The analysis of farm harvest prices and MSP for wheat in Bihar from 1998-99 to 2016-17 shows that for nine harvest seasons from 1998-99 to 2006-07, the harvest price remained above MSP in three, from 90% to 100% of MSP in three, and below 90% of MSP in three. During the same period, the prices in Punjab remained above MSP in three seasons and 90% or more of MSP in the remaining six seasons. In Haryana, the prices remained above MSP in five seasons and 90% or more of MSP in the remaining four.Farm harvest prices collated by the agriculture ministry are averages of wholesale prices at which the farmer sells to the trader at the village site.Follow TOI's live blog for latest updates on farmers protestIn the ten marketing seasons between 2007-08 and 2016-17 (the latest data available), not a single season saw prices in Bihar go beyond MSP. Prices remained 90% or more of MSP in four seasons and fell even below that level in the remaining six. In Punjab, on the other hand, there were two seasons when prices went beyond MSP, while only one saw them fall below 90% of MSP. Similarly, for seven seasons during this period, farmers in Haryana sold wheat at higher prices than MSP, while two seasons saw prices at between 90% and 100% of. Data was not available for one marketing season in Haryana.The trends are in harvest prices for paddy. Paddy is cultivated in both autumn and winter in Bihar and the higher of the two prices is taken for this analysis. Haryana is excluded from this comparison because the cultivation of high-quality rice in the state has pushed farm harvest prices to a much higher level than the MSP.In Bihar, in the nine harvest seasons between 1998-99 and 2016-17, only one saw prices nearly on a par with MSP (99.5% of MSP), for three prices were within 80-90% of MSP and for the remaining five farmers got 70-80% of MSP. In the ten seasons between 2007-08 and 2016-17 after APMC act was abolished, prices were within 70-80% of MSP in three and between 80-90% of MSP in the remaining six.This raises questions about the claim that farmers are trapped in the MSP and APMC mandis system and opening up the market leads to corporates and private buyers giving higher prices. It also helps explain the farmer anguish over uncertainty of MSP and distrust of 'free markets'.In Punjab, for the 16 marketing seasons for which data is available since 1998-99, the paddy harvest price fell below MSP (96.6%) only once and remained higher than the MSP in the rest.The patterns hold even in maize which unlike paddy and wheat doesn't have government procurement and is sold mostly to private buyers. In the nine seasons before the abolition of the APMC act, there were two when maize was sold higher than MSP in Bihar. In the ten seasons after abolishing the mandis, again only two saw prices go beyond MSP. For the last four seasons, it has remained below 90% of MSP. In contrast, farmers in Punjab sold maize above MSP in 14 of the 18 seasons for which price data is available. Prices fell below MSP only four times but remained between 90% and 100% of it. In Haryana, prices never fell below MSP.Data on average daily wages of male ploughman or field Labour (data for female labour was not available for all the years) between 2005-06 and 2017-18 shows that the lower price of output might have suppressed agricultural wages in Bihar. In 2006-07, the average wage in Bihar was 79% of wages in Punjab and 66.8% of wages in Haryana. Today, farm labour in Bihar earns 61% of what it could in Punjab and 50-60% of wages in Haryana, the latest figure being 59.1%.","Bihar junked APMC Act in '06, but it hasn't benefited farmers",RICE

These panicles are of the Black Jasmine rice variety cultivated by Nayanan C.C., a Health Department employee-cum-paddy farmer.He is growing the rice variety, known for its medicinal properties, on one acre of leased land. He sowed the seeds two months ago and the harvest is expected in February.Nayanan says that his aim is to popularise rice varieties with medicinal properties.In India, Black rice with numerous health benefits is mostly grown in Manipur, West Bengal and some north-eastern States. When I came to know about the benefits of it, I decided to cultivate it in the puncha crop season, he says.He got 25 kg seeds of the Black Jasmine rice from a farmer in Wayanad. It is being grown in an organic way. The farmer was reluctant to give the seeds saying that they might not germinate in our conditions. The germination was in fact difficult. I had soaked the seeds in water for several hours and repeated the process quite a few times before they germinated. Black rice can be grown in our conditions with slight changes in the germination process, says Mr. Nayanan, a resident of Thirumala ward in the Alappuzha municipality.Black rice also known as the forbidden rice is rich in nutrients and is deep dark in colour. It will turn deep purple when cooked due to the high level of antioxidant called anthocyanin. Studies have also revealed that the rice variety contains fibre and has anti-inflammatory properties.Apart from Black rice, he is also cultivating Rakthashali and Krishna Kamod varieties in another half an acre at the Kombankuzhy Padasekharam, which is spread over 110 acres.Flood resistanceIn August 2020, Nayanan C.C. had hit headlines after the Rakthashali rice variety cultivated by him on half an acre withstood three weeks of flooding.The Kombankuzhy Padasekharam was inundated on August 7 following a heavy downpour. When the waters receded after three weeks, paddy cultivated on 109.5 acres (Uma variety) was destroyed. Although the field where he sowed Rakthashali too was inundated, the rice variety withstood the flood much to the surprise of farmers and agriculture experts. In November, the paddy was hand-harvested in the presence of farmers, scientists, and environmentalists.",Forbidden rice finds its way to Kombankuzhy Padasekharam,RICE

Pelosi must win support from 50% of members voting -- during a global pandemic -- to claim another term leading the chamber.Im fine, Pelosi said last week when asked whether she has the support to continue as speaker, after the Democratic majority shrunk to 11 votes from 37 after Republican gains in the November election.For the past two years, Pelosi has been the Democrats main foil for President Donald Trump, and thats helped keep her caucus unified despite the ideological spread from progressives like New York Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to centrists like Representative Josh Gottheimer of New Jersey. For the next term, Pelosis challenge is to keep the party marching behind President-elect Joe Bidens agenda.Pelosi, 80, the only woman to hold the speakers gavel, faced a mini-revolt in 2019 after Democrats regained the House majority in the midterm elections. Fifteen members of her party cast their ballots for someone else as speaker or voted present, and at least 10 of them will be part of the Democratic delegation again this year.Republicans have tried to stoke dissent among Democrats, particularly those from closely divided districts. Dan Conston, president of the Congressional Leadership Fund, the super-PAC for House Republicans, tweeted that, We view any weak-kneed Democrats voting present or *conveniently* skipping the vote as a move to enable Pelosi and the lefts radical agenda -- well be sure voters know exactly what they did.Republican members will nominate their leader, Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, for speaker. But the nominee of the majority party typically sails to victory, and theres been no late entry by another Democrat seeking to try to topple Pelosi.Roll CallThere still may be some tense moments during the roll call vote, which will take longer than usual and extend into the evening due to procedures in place because of the pandemic. The winner must gain an actual majority of votes cast by both parties. Democrats hold a 222-211 advantage in the new Congress -- with two House seats currently still open -- leaving Pelosi little room for party defections.It is clear that were going to need to unite around a Democratic speaker and not Kevin McCarthy, said Representative Pramila Jayapal of Washington state, chair of the 100-member Congressional Progressive Caucus.I have no doubt in my mind we are going to elect Nancy, said House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer.Each lawmaker who shows up on Sunday can nominate and vote for people who arent even members of Congress, or even vote present, rather than for their partys nominee, a move that lowers the threshold for achieving a majority.If no candidate emerges with a simple majority of all the votes cast for a named person, the balloting would continue until someone passes the 50% threshold. The last multiple-ballot speaker election was in 1923, when the winner wasnt decided until the ninth ballot.Bad OpticsRoss Baker, a professor of American politics at Rutgers University, said Pelosi will benefit from consensus across ideological lines in the House caucus that a public battle right now is bad optics. Democrats need to show theyre ready and able to work with the incoming Biden administration to get things accomplished, he said.The 10 returning Democrats who didnt vote for Pelosi in 2019 are representatives Elissa Slotkin of Michigan; Abigail Spanberger of Virginia; Mikie Sherill of New Jersey; Jared Golden of Maine; Jason Crow of Colorado; Ron Kind of Wisconsin; Conor Lamb of Pennsylvania; Kurt Schrader of Oregon; Kathleen Rice of New York; and Jim Cooper of Tennessee.Among those whove publicly stated their intentions, Slotkin, who represents a Republican-leaning district, has already said she would vote present, as she did in 2019. Golden, also from a swing district, has said he will not vote for Pelosi.Schraders office confirmed hell back Pelosi this time around, as will Cooper. I will vote for Pelosi for Speaker because she has led a contentious Democratic caucus well during the pandemic and the Trump presidency, Cooper said.Two newly elected progressives who won their seats after ousting long-time Democrats, Jamaal Bowman of New York and Cori Bush of Missouri, havent committed.Youll find out when my vote is tallied, Bowman said in a recent interview on CNNs State of the Union. On the same program, Bush said that, What Im going to do is make sure that the voices of the people of St. Louis are heard, and that we have what we need, and so youll find out then.Next GenerationOcasio-Cortez has been among the most vocal Democratic House members calling for current leadership to give way to a younger generation. But in an interview with the Intercept published in December, she said, the left isnt really making a plan for how to accomplish that in the near future. Her office didnt return emails seeking comment on Pelosis election.Pelosi committed in 2018 to not seeking the speakership beyond 2022 in response to demands from younger Democrats seeking generational change. Talking with reporters last month, Pelosi declined to directly respond to a question about that commitment stands.We never expected to have another term now, she said. I consider this a gift.",Nancy Pelosi seeks speakership with slim margin in new Congress,RICE

Further it suggested that a strong brand symbol can be created by creating a brand logo associated with Telangana Sona.Over time, we believe that Telangana Sona will also have significant potential in overseas markets such as the United States that already has a strong health revolution underway and has a significant population of the Indian diaspora, the report added.",Low awareness about Telangana Sona: ISB,RICE

(Representational)Rice procurement from Chhattisgarh has been restricted at 24 lakh metric tonnes during the kharif marketing season (KMS) 2020-21, the Centre said on Sunday.However, the Centre has advised the state not to announce or pay bonus over and above the MSP to farmers.In a statement, the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution said, Central Government is following a uniform policy and supporting farmers across the country. Same is followed in Chhattisgarh procurement.The ministry cited provisions of a memorandum of understanding signed between the Centre, states and Food Corporation of India, under which the Centre is not bound to take the excess quantity procured by such state to the central pool.As per Clause No.3 of MoU of DCP State, in the situation of State giving any bonus/ financial incentive in direct or indirect form, over and above MSP, if the overall procurement of the State is in excess of the total allocation of the State made by the Government of India under TPDS/ OWS, such excess quantity shall be treated to be outside the Central Pool, it said.Initial targets are only estimates settled with States and States are asked if they are giving incentive or not. Some states including Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh were found to be giving incentive so Central Government procurement is restricted to quantity which was procured in past without bonus/incentive.It also said, During KMS 2020-21, the Government of Chhattisgarh had also published an advertisement/press release on 17.12.2020 detailing the Rajiv Gandhi Kisan Nyay Yojana that they will procure paddy from the farmers @ Rs.2500/- per quintal during KMS 2020-21 by paying Rs.10,000/- per acre which is a form of indirect incentive over and above the MSP which is as good as bonus on procurement of paddy. Accordingly, it has been decided to allow 24 lakh MT of rice to be delivered to FCI under central pool during KMS 2020-21 which is equivalent to the quantity as allowed in previous years.The move comes after the Chhattisgarh governments decision to halt paddy procurement, saying the Centre is not lifting stock.Chhattisgarh is a DCP State. Under DCP or Decentralized (DCP) Procurement system, the state government/its agencies procure, store and distribute (against Government of Indias allocation for TPDS & OWS etc) rice /wheat/coarse grains within the state.

The session was moderated by Senior Assistant Editor Avishek G DastidarNITIN GADKARI: The most important development for the country is infrastructure development In my office in Delhi, we have put up a statement by former American President John F Kennedy: American roads are not good because America is rich. But America is rich because American roads are good. Prosperity comes from roads. India has a huge potential for infrastructure development. We have the potential of making at least 300 airports. We have already completed 100 new airports. We can launch seaplanes. The service is already available in Gujarat at the Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel statue (Statue of Unity in Kevadia in Narmada district)  And, we can convert our rivers, lakes and dams into water ports. This is going to encourage tourism, and will go on to provide employment.ANANT GOENKA: When will India see large-scale production of electric vehicles (EVs)?NITIN GADKARI: Already a lot of people, small companies are making e-bikes and e-scooters in Uttar Pradesh and other states in India. The crucial problem with EVs is the lithium-ion battery. Now, we are encouraging people to make in India and Made in India. The important thing is that a lot of research is going on to make aluminium-ion (batteries) and other new alternatives. I am confident that in some time we will get a lot of new alternatives, and soon EVs will be the future of the country.Already there is a lot of sale of electric buses, like in Mumbai, Pune, Nagpur etc. They are there at airports too. Even an electric tractor is now in the process of being manufactured. One of the leading companies wants to launch an electric truck. Just 20 days ago, I launched a JCB on CNG. So, a lot of change is going on and we are a hundred per cent certain that it will be a very cost-effective import substitute, and will also be pollution-free and indigenous. We are already in the process of making (vehicle) scrapping policy. With the scrapping policy, I am confident that in the next five years India will be the number one manufacturing hub in the world.Tesla is preparing to start operations in India by early 2021. I am sure that there are a lot of EVs which are equal to Tesla from the technology point of view. Indian manufacturers are doing a lot of research and changes. In due course, you will get electric cars which will be equal to Tesla. I am confident of that, and the cost will be very less too.ANANT GOENKA: Lithium-ion is mostly being imported from China. Is that a concern?NITIN GADKARI: Yes, there are some problems related to lithium-ion. Argentina has got huge reserves of lithium-ion. Indian players are also trying to get lithium-ion from across the world. But it is also true that the Chinese have already picked up stakes in a majority of the lithium-ion mines But our research arm is fully competent. Take for example ISRO (Indian Space Research Organisation), which is using different types of batteries to send satellites. Research is going on and our people are competent and we will get the solution for that.Sodium-ion batteries are also in the process of being made. The research is in the final stages. I am very confident about our IITs and engineers. We will get success in this field. The sodium-ion batteries are very cheap We will be the number one manufacturers of electric bikes, scooters, tractors, trucks, and even electric construction equipment in due course.AMITABH SINHA: While the infrastructure in India  roads, railways, Metro etc  has improved in the last three decades, we are among the last countries to have developed these. Are we now building infrastructure that is futuristic?NITIN GADKARI: It is true that our railway stations are not of a global standard. But we are building a multi-modal station worth Rs 1,200 crore in Nagpur. It has been designed by an American architect. It will be among the five best railway stations in the world. So, things have begun to happen slowly.The cost of building the Metro in Nagpur, Pune and Delhi is Rs 350 crore per kilometre. The one that I have proposed costs Rs 5 crore per kilometre (the Nagpur broad gauge Metro)  Using the existing railway stations, lines and signals, the broad-gauge, six-coach Metro will run at a speed of 160 km per hour. We have already got the permission Of the six coaches, three will have motors, and will cost Rs 8 crore. The coaches without a motor will cost Rs 4 crore. There will be an additional coach for carrying luggage. While a luxury bus from Nagpur to Amravati takes about two-and-a-half hours, this Metro will reach in one hour and 15 minutes It will be air-conditioned and will also have business and economy classes. It will be of a global standard. So, its not that the standard in India is not goodRead | MSP as legal provision will lead to loss for Punjab farmers: BJP leaderI have prepared a new model for this project. I am holding a meeting with the Vidarbha Industries Association and the Metro team in a few days. I have also invited travel and tourism companies for the meeting. One Metro will cost Rs 36 crore. These private companies can buy one or two Metros. The Nagpur Metro will provide the driver If this service becomes popular, people will stop using the road. This is Nagpurs first public-private investment. The system will use the countrys existing broad gauge, and the capital cost will also be less. So, we are doing things which are of an international standard, and some of these projects are also being done for the first time in the world.AVISHEK G DASTIDAR: Farmers have been holding protests at Delhis borders for over a month now. How do you think the government can resolve their issues?NITIN GADKARI: Firstly, at one point we had a shortage of foodgrains in the country. Then, after the Green Revolution, we now have surplus rice. Prior to 2020s production, we had about 280 lakh tonnes of rice in our godowns. We can give rice to the entire world. In case of corn, the MSP is Rs 1,700, when the market price is about Rs 1,100. Last year, we exported 60 lakh tonnes of sugar, providing a subsidy of Rs 600 crore. Why is it that the cost of sugar in the international market is Rs 22 per kg but we are paying Rs 34 per kg for sugarcane? Our MSP is more than the international and market prices, and that is the problem.I have been talking about ethanol for the last 12 years. But the permission to convert foodgrains (to fuel) was not granted. We import fuel worth Rs 8 lakh crore. We can make 480 litres of ethanol from 1 tonne of rice. From 1 tonne of corn, we can make 380 litres of ethanol. The economy of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh will be transformed. And, instead of making sugar, we could make ethanol from sugarcane juice and molasses As Transport Minister, I have launched scooters and bikes of Bajaj and TVS which run on ethanol A lot of products are made from ethanol including bio-plastic (which is biodegradable). Ethanol is a green fuel If we can build this economy, our farmers can earn more. It could help in reducing import (of fuel) by Rs 2 lakh crore, and pollution will also reduce. And, Rs 1 lakh crore will go to farmers The root cause of the problem is surplus foodgrains and higher MSP than the market price.At a pharmacy, the shopkeeper decides the price (of the products). The price of an advertisement in the newspaper is decided by the newspaper. The cost of food in a restaurant is decided by the restaurant The airline companies and the railways decide the price of their tickets. Then why should farmers not decide the price (of their produce)? Farmers should be able to sell anywhere they want, wherever they get more money. We have not closed down any APMC.Another important aspect is contract farming. About 10,000 farmers in the Vidarbha region dont have capital and their land is lying barren. This is compelling them to commit suicide. If a third person tills the land, buys the seed and fertiliser, and then shares the profit, or leases the land, the farmer still gets some money When we ride a taxi for half an hour, do we become its owner? In contract farming, no change is going to be made in the revenue record. So, the farm laws are not against farmers We have to understand the problems faced by farmers The government has no place to store foodgrains. Diversification of agriculture towards the energy and power sector, changing the crop pattern, increasing production of edible oils is necessary for the country.DEEPTIMAN TIWARY: During certain months in the year, there is not enough water in the waterway from Varanasi to Haldia (in West Bengal). Its a concern for ships. How do you plan to resolve this for making waterways?NITIN GADKARI: For rivers which dont have water in March and April, we are working on water conservation projects. Such work has been done in Maharashtra. We are ensuring waterways only on two rivers, which will have water round the year Apart from this, it is also important to develop port-related infrastructure such as godowns, cold storage facilities, railway line connectivity. Now we can send mangoes from Uttar Pradesh to the Northeast. The fly ash in Farakka (West Bengal) is exported to Bangladesh in large quantities. The aim is to develop the trade business and increase connectivity.In the case of seaplanes, we are looking for investors. A few of them are approaching us SpiceJet is interested in taking about 100 seaplanes.SHUBHANGI KHAPRE: Do you think it was right to cancel the Winter Session of Parliament?NITIN GADKARI: In the previous session, a few members got Covid-19, including me. So, I think it had to be postponed. Delhi has pollution as well as Covid-19. Although I am keeping well, I am afraid of Delhi pollution In such a situation, while a Parliament session is important for democracy We have also lost a few ministerial colleagues. Till a vaccine is out, we should be careful.TABASSUM BARNAGARWALA: Overcrowding has been a problem on Mumbais local trains. Has the ongoing pandemic led to any discussion on the need for more local trains in Mumbai to ensure social distancing?NITIN GADKARI: My personal view is that we must continue all services with preventive measures. We shut down shops, restaurants On the one hand it was necessary to ensure social distancing, but now as the Minister for Minister of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME), I understand how people lost their livelihoods in the process. We now need to understand the art of living with Covid-19  wearing masks and face shields, using sanitiser, washing hands, ensuring one metre distance from other people, sitting apart at restaurants. We need to understand these things and move forward. Shutting things down has many disadvantages.In Mumbai, we can decide how many people will get on a train. We have good technology now, and numbers can be restricted. But everything needs to start, whether it is trains or buses, and at the same time we need to protect ourselves and others. People such as tea stall owners, barbers, gym instructors, all lost their source of income. Their livelihood is as important as taking precautions for Covid-19. I conducted 280 conferences and met 80 crore people. I learnt that the hotel industry employs 1.4 crore people as chefs and waiters. Over one crore people work in beauty parlours and hair salons. We need to protect their jobs too.SANDEEP SINGH: To help lockdown-battered MSMEs get back on their feet, the government launched the over Rs 3 lakh crore emergency credit line guarantee scheme (ECLGS) as part of the AtmaNirbhar Bharat package in May. But till November, the sanction was short by Rs 1 lakh crore and disbursement was also below 50 per cent. The MSMEs are feeling the stress. What is the way forward?NITIN GADKARI: We had sanctioned Rs 3 lakh crore for collateral-free loans for MSMEs. Of this, Rs 2 lakh crore has been sanctioned, and disbursement stands between Rs 1.6-1.8 lakh crore I have requested the Finance Minister to give more relaxations in the scheme. Also, we found that urban cooperative banks and Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) have also financed MSMEs. So they too must be brought under the scheme. That will help too.We had also given Rs 20,000 crore for distressed MSMEs. We have restructured (debts of) around six lakh MSMEs under it. We also announced a fund of funds for MSMEs to provide equity support of Rs 50,000 crore. We are processing it. The MSMEs which have good export turnover, tax return, GST and bank records Now if such MSMEs want to tap the capital market, we will provide them with 15 per cent equity infusion and the rest they can get from the market. So in the insurance , pension, and share economy, we have a lot of potential in comparison to other countries. And some of our MSMEs are doing very well.Of the total exports by the country, MSMEs account for 48 per cent. Their contribution to the GDP is 30 per cent. I want the 48 per cent export figure to reach 60 per cent and GDP contribution to become 40 per cent. MSMEs have created 11 crore jobs, and in the coming time we want them to create five crore more jobs.The market needs liquidity. I want to request the banks to adopt a liberal approach to financing people, which will increase liquidity, growth, employment, export So we are monitoring all aspects. We have created a portal called Champion and we are addressing all problems raised by the MSME sector on it.SANDEEP SINGH: Will Tesla come to manufacture in India?NITIN GADKARI: Its better to talk about it when they come. India is going to be an automobile manufacturing hub in five years. The industry is worth Rs 4.5 lakh crore and gives the maximum employment And, bio-fuel, ethanol, methanol, bio-CNG, bio-diesel, electric research is underway on all these in India. In the coming time, all the big world brands will come here (Tesla) will begin sales operations, not manufacturing. Once the sales increase, they will move to assembling, and then manufacturing.VANDITA MISHRA: Do you think the farmers protest could have been handled in a better manner by the government. The protests began in June in Punjab and Haryana, but the government only took note once these reached the Capital. Also, has the split with the Akali Dal made the situation more difficult to handle?NITIN GADKARI: We are constantly making efforts to hold talks A lot of confusion has been created about the three farm laws. We were ready for talks then (in June) too Even in Parliament we were open to talks with other parties, and we are ready to talk now as well. I am positive that the issue will get resolved soon through talks.The BJP-Akali Dal alliance has been there since the Jana Sangh days. During the Emergency, leaders of both parties were in jail. We have had good relations with them, and the alliance was a symbol of Hindu-Sikh unity. It is unfortunate that they left us. All I want to say is that our government has taken many decisions in favour of farmers. We are not against them We are increasing the MSP every year The government is working for farmers benefit. Now, I am not the BJP president, so I dont want to comment on the politics. But I want things to work out and our relations to get better soon.MANOJ C G: Many BJP-ruled are drafting laws against love jihad. Should the State decide who one can marry or fall in love with?NITIN GADKARI: There are two sides to all issues. As per my knowledge, many incidents have happened which have triggered the issue of love jihad. To maintain law and order and ensure a healthy society if a state government feels the need for such a law, there is no harm in it. It is not against any religion. Central and state governments have the right to create laws to address certain issues in society.AVISHEK G DASTIDAR: In the MSME and the highways space, you have been making policies vis-a-vis AtmaNirbhar Bharat, to ensure that influence of Chinese players is less in the market. Can you elaborate on your policies?NITIN GADKARI: I dont want to say anything about China. We increased the import duty on incense sticks. It is a Rs 4,000 crore industry. Now it is being developed in our country. Over 25 lakh people got jobs. Sanitiser was not available, it was being sold for Rs 1,200/litre, now it is available at Rs 160/litre. We are exporting PPE kits I told the automobile sector to not get parts from China or any other country, and develop local vendors. Give them machines, money and produce on a large scale to reduce costsThe mindset of major industry players has changed. Technology is being upgraded, foreign investment is coming to our country, and India is being preferred in the global market. It is a golden opportunity for us.",Nitin Gadkari: Root cause of the problem is surplus foodgrains and higher MSP than the market price,RICE

However, sources from the state government say that is down from the 60 lakh MT that they were assured. The state government fears that the central government will ask the state to discontinue Rajiv Gandhi Kisan Nyay Yojana.The state government hopes that the remaining rice will also be taken later. But the worrying thing is that the central government has made a condition that the state government will not give any kind of bonus with the purchase of crops right now or in future. Actually, the Centre has objections with the state governments Rajiv Gandhi Kisan Nyay Yojana. The BJP leaders of the state have complained to the Centre that the Congress government is giving bonus to the farmers. Whereas the truth is that after the central governments condition of not giving bonus, the state started the Rajiv Gandhi Kisan Nyay Yojana and announced to give it per acre instead of crop, said a senior official in the Chief Ministers Office (CMO).Another source from the government said that we are apprehensive that the central government will ask to discontinue the Rajiv Gandhi Kisan Nyay Yojana in the future.Actually the central government is not okay with cash going in the pockets of farmers. They want the farmer to keep going through Modi jis 500 rupees per month plan.The BJP state unit pointed out that the directive about not giving bonus have been issued to the Madhya Pradesh government as well.There is federal structure and every state has to follow it because we follow constitution. The central government has issued such directions to Madhya Pradesh also which is BJP ruled state. The Chhattisgarh government is doing politics by saying that state BJP unit has complained about Nyay Yojana or bonus, said Sacchinand Upasane, senior BJP leader and spokesperson.Meanwhile, chief minister Bhupesh Baghel thanked the Centre and also hoped that the permission for more procurement would be granted further in the central pool.CM Baghel had recently spoken to Prime Minister Narendra Modi over phone and requested to ensure issuance of final order from the Centre to lift rice after custom milling from the state for the central pool.The Centre had earlier given in principle approval to take 60 lakh MT rice from the state in the central pool.As per a letter issued by the Government of India on Sunday, The Government of India has decided to allow 24 lakh MT of rice to be delivered to FCI under central pool during KMS 2020-21 which is equivalent to the quantity as allowed in previous years to Chhattisgarh.The Centre had categorically stated that it could not purchase excess paddy procured by the states by giving bonus and incentives in direct or indirect form citing the clauses of procurement scheme agreement.A Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) has been signed between Government of India, State Government and Food Corporation of India in both DCP (decentralized procurement scheme) and non-DCP States for procurement of paddy from farmers under central pool, the letter stated.As per Clause No.3 of MoU of DCP State, In the situation of state giving any bonus/ financial incentive in direct or indirect form, over and above minimum support price (MSP), if the overall procurement of the state is in excess of the total allocation of the state made by the Government of India under TPDS (Targeted Public Distribution System)/ OWS (Other Welfare Schemes), such excess quantity shall be treated to be outside the Central Pool.The Chhattisgarh government had also published an advertisement/press release on December 17, 2020 detailing the Rajiv Gandhi Kisan Nyay Yojana that they would procure paddy from the farmers at Rs 2,500 per quintal during KMS 2020-21 by paying Rs 10,000 per acre which is a form of indirect incentive over and above the MSP which is as good as bonus on procurement of paddy, it said.",Nyay scheme to be hit?

SV Ranga Rao, who played the iconic role of Ghatotkajan in the 1957 cult classic film Mayabazar, lipsynced to this song, heartily laughing and taking in the aromatic flavours of the wedding feast that he waited to devour.Decades later, the song is as fresh as the raindrops outside when one thinks of a traditional kalyana sappadu. But in a pandemic world, when marriages have been cancelled or postponed, guest list restricted and other protocols put in place, much of the grandeur of the wedding ceremonies has lost its sheen.Not to forget the morning tiffin of idli, vadai, pongal, kesari and chutney accompanied by filter kaapi, and the post-muhurtham elaborate elai sappadu that we missed in 2020. But, if the past year has taught us anything, it is that hope keeps the head and heart alive.Its with this sentiment that Chennais wedding caterers now deliver this feast of joy at our doorsteps. Business models, menu plans and packaging of the feast are being tweaked to include the virtual guests.Recreating experienceAfter several brainstorming sessions, the team of Arusuvai Arasu caterers joined hands with Weddings & Marigolds, an event management company. The duo toyed with multiple ideas to package the lavish feast in a way that offered a been there, ate that experience of elai sappadu. Putting their creativity and coordination skills to test was one such wedding project where they handled the delivery of sappadu to 85 households in the city.All 23 items, which normally get served in south Indian weddings, had to go to the bridegrooms friends and relatives. We created a little menu card, which also showed the order of serving at a wedding. Each partition in the hot case was numbered according to the printed menu card so that you knew exactly what each box contained. To avoid spillage, we mixed kuzhambu, rasam, sambar with rice so that its easier to consume, shares Mathangi Srinivasamurti, founder, Weddings & Marigolds. Rolled banana leaves are kept along with containers in wire baskets of yellow, orange and pink colours, woven by Manjal  an NGO that attempts to revive Chettinad crafts.The main dishes are served in hot packs to maintain the temperature. All other smaller items like curies and poriyals are packed in airtight containers. The hot pack and basket are for the guests as return gifts. A hot pack serves one. So, we distribute according to the count in a household. In the case of large families, a bigger carrier is provided. No food goes waste as it can always be carried forward to the next day. We also add bakshanam if requested. The idea is to keep it as aesthetically pleasing as possible, details Mathangi, who has executed this concept in a few weddings in Chennai since September 2020. But, the team still had the huge responsibility of delivering the food on time.One of our clients suggested Unanu, a delivery service, for professional and safe delivery to all the families on the guest list. We divided the 85 households into zones and aimed at having all five trucks depart between 9 am and 9.30 am with the truck carrying food to the farthest location being the first to leave, explains Mathangi, adding that they can deliver wedding food to a minimum of 20 guests or more. The pricing for the customisable meal portions range from Rs 1,500 to Rs 5,000 depending on the choice of packaging and menu.For Mathangi, however, it was the typical sappadu scenes  watching kids trying to stop the rasam from flowing out of the banana leaf, elders scooping up the payasam in one swift hand movement, and making sure every guest has eaten to their hearts content  that she sorely missed. Yet, amid the cacophony of nadaswaram and clattering of vessels, her phone just did not stop ringing, once the guests had polished off the containers of food. Sappadu is an emotion.The way the whole meal was meticulously packed reflects the love and affection of the grooms family. The way the food needs to be served is an art in itself and not many pay attention to it in a dining hall. So, their illustration and numbered boxes helped us arrange the items on the leaf, just like how its done traditionally. This thought is commendable and definitely needs to be explored. Relatives, especially the elderly, feel satisfied, shares Latha Ganesh, a guest, who was served by Mathangis catering service.Ups and downsWhile this wasnt the plunge several conventional caterers were willing to take, a few such as Sastha Catering Services (Porur), Mountbatten Mani Iyer Catering Services and Sri Balaji Catering services tapped on this opportunity. Weighing the pros and cons, K Srinivasan, son of veteran caterer Mountbatten Mani Iyer, shares One has to be careful with the items in the menu. If I deliver a box of cauliflower roast, poori or bajji, it will get chewy and hard by the time it reaches the guest. Clients must understand that and not raise it as a complaint.The delivery model doesnt give me complete satisfaction. However, if this is the way forward then we will have to adjust. Mountbatten Mani Iyer Catering services and Sri Balaji Catering Services prefer delivering the bulk supply to the host family at a convenient time. Its not cost-effective for us to deliver at the doorstep of every person in the guest list. So we leave it to the families to handle it through Dunzo, says Balaji Pattappa, a sixth-generation caterer.On the other hand, Venkatesan Krishnan of Sastha Catering Services (Porur), offered the taste of the kalyana sappadu during Margazhi music festival for rasikas. Besides, he also catered at a few weddings and took charge of the delivery of sappadu as well. On the bright side, Mathangi is glad that the business model is picking up. I think we have begun our new journey quite well even if we didnt get everything right. We can either handle the catering, packaging and delivery for clients or just the delivery by leaving the choice of caterers to them.If we can create more employment opportunities this way, then why not? We have to constantly update ourselves to sustain in this ever-evolving hospitality industry. The lockdown has prepared us for the game with enough trial runs, says a hopeful Mathangi. Like Neil Armstrong said when he first walked on the moon, Thats one small step for man, a giant leap for mankind, Mathangi and her ilk have taken their first steps in a newnormal. And perhaps now, the battle for mudhal pandi will be a nostalgic story to be narrated to future generations.",D-day delicacies in dabbas,RICE

The laws change the way Indias farmers do business by creating free markets, as opposed to a network of decades-old, government marketplaces, allowing traders to stockpile essential commodities for future sales and laying down a national framework for contract farming.These laws are The Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020.Together, the laws will allow big corporations and global supermarket chains to buy directly from farmers, bypassing decades-old regulations.Farmers say the reforms will make them vulnerable to exploitation by big corporations, erode their bargaining power and weaken the procurement system, whereby the government buys staples such as wheat and rice at guaranteed rates.",Reliance moves HC against vandalism of telecom towers,RICE

Since then, though, the mall compound has become a safe haven for protesting farmers and a storehouse of supplies for langars. And numerous empty shop plots at the Kessel Grand Mall are now makeshift rooms providing relief in the rains to protesters.As protesters from Punjab started arriving at the Singhu Border more than a month ago, the largely unused mall was one of the places where they began unloading supplies. Since then, dozens of tractors have been parked outside the malls and langars have come up for protesters. Such is the popularity of the location that people use it as a landmark to provide directions.In the main lobby of the mall, sacks of grains, wheat, atta and rice are piled up. Volunteer groups heading langars nearby say they prefer to keep the food inside since that keeps it safe from the rain. This place helps us to keep things organised especially when it comes to food. Its an open area and anyone can come and stay here. It has become even more useful especially in the rains since its a covered building. There are tents set up and washrooms outside, said Bahadur Singh from Major League Federation, which is providing seva at the protest.Protesters say no one from the malls management has approached them so far.In the rear end of the mall, a row of camping tents have been set up, while a counter has come up where three people note down details of those using the tents. Plastic sheets have been installed as doors on empty shop plots where mattresses have been placed for women and children. During the rain, protesters say, a part of the railing on one of the floors collapsed but no one was hurt.Currently, nearly 400-500 people can find accommodation in the mall.The parking lot is used for washing clothes and clotheslines have been installed to dry them.

It seems that this government too is waiting for a century of farmer deaths to complete. It is a dictatorial government which doesnt understand that farmers were your voters.

I do believe there are several issues at play here. There is brand Adani, brand Saurav, and finally the product, oil. The farmer agitation, the association of brand Adani with the ruling dispensation, Sourav and rumours of his political leanings, are all adding to the jamboree of discontent, said brand expert, Harish Bijoor.He urged brands to stay away from politics and religion.

The petition said 1,500 telecom towers operated by Jio in Punjab had been vandalised, crippling the mobile network in Punjab, where the company has 14 million subscribers.Subscribers are compelled to port to other networks, the plea said, adding that the acts of vandalism had also endangered the lives of thousands of its employees.Jios parent company, Reliance Industries Limited (RIL), and its retail arms or affiliates have no interest and does not intend in future to do corporate or contract farming, according to the petition. RIL and its retail arms have not purchased any agricultural land directly or indirectly for the purpose of farming, it said.Underscoring that Jio and RIL have the greatest regard for the hard work of farmers, the petition added that RIL and its affiliates have never entered into long-term procurement contracts to gain unfair advantage over farmers or their produce.Reliance Jio filed the petition on Monday seeking a direction to the government authorities in the state and at the Centre to protect its communication infrastructure as well as ensure the safety of its employees.The plea claims it had been targeted in Punjab because those with vested interests were taking advantage of the farmers agitation against the recently enacted agricultural laws.Jio also sought the appointment of a competent authority to assess the damages to be recovered from the vandals in the context of a judgment by the Supreme Court that rioters must be made to pay for the destruction of properties.The destruction has been done in a well orchestrated manner, which is result of a sustained disinformation campaign being carried out by vested interests, said the plea, demanding that adequate security arrangements be made to stop the vandalism of its infrastructure.Telecom infrastructure owned by the company has been targeted in parts of Punjab by protesters who have alleged that the new farm laws were meant to benefit certain corporate houses at the cost of farmers. The laws change the way Indias farmers do business by creating free markets as opposed to a network of government marketplaces, allowing traders to stockpile essential commodities for future sales, and laying down a national framework for contract farming.In response to submissions, states advocate general, Atul Nanda said that the company itself has admitted that the action has been taken to protect its assets. The government has deployed 1019 patrolling parties in 22 districts and has appointed 22 nodal officers to ensure that no further damage is caused. The state is carrying out the duty enjoined upon it by the various statutes. ..the impact of the agitation on 1300 affected towers has been removed and they are now functioning, Nanda told the court adding that the task of the state agencies would become easier, if the petitioner was to share information regarding the alleged vested interest involved.These laws are the Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020.Farmers say the laws will make them vulnerable to exploitation by big corporations, erode their bargaining power and weaken the procurement system, whereby the government buys staples such as wheat and rice at guaranteed prices","HC seeks Centre, Punjab replies on Reliance petition against vandalism",RICE

While most farmers then decided to remain put at the borders  saying authorities wanted to push them into a corner  about 400 eventually moved to the Burari ground.Pointing to a volleyball net tied between a branch and a tent, Jagdeep Singh (24) from Punjabs Faridkot said on Tuesday, A sewadar from Delhi donated this net to us 10 days ago. Since then, some of us gather to play in the evenings. Farmers cannot sit idle, it is in our blood to do something productive. For the same reason, a number of older farmers decided to make use of the land and grow a few vegetables.Rows of 12-day-old onion plants are being cultivated not far from the 40 tractors at the site. Said Gurudev Singh Manga (42): They will take around 60 days to start yielding onions. It is symbolic of the fact that we will not move from here anytime soon.Gurudev and others from Ropar district in Punjab reached the site in the last week of November: We keep visiting Singhu and Tikri, but we will not go anywhere as it is easier to march to Delhi from here.At another corner of the site, Jaskaran Singh Kahan (58) and his family from Firozpur tend to the rows of corn, spinach, tomato and onion: There are 15 corn trees and two rows each of other vegetables. Once it becomes a bit warmer, we will grow rice and a few more vegetables. That way, we do not have to depend on resources from outside.He added that some were grown from leftover vegetables, while some seeds and plants were purchased from a nursery nearby. He said that they will be grown organically as the quality of the mud is good.While sporadic rains have been a boon for these crops, they have posed a new set of challenges. Many farmers dug trenches around their tents and tractors when they were expecting rain so water wouldnt accumulate where they sleep.For others, who have set up bigger tents with cloth on the ground, this was not an option. Pinderjeet Kaur (32), who joined her father-in-law at the protest, came to Delhi in a private vehicle along with her husband and two children. She said, Ten of us, including the children, sleep on three mattresses, which are now wet because of the rain the roof of the tents keep flying at night as well. She said nobody has given them a fresh set of mattresses and that they would have to wait for them to dry.Meanwhile, groups of farmers worked through the day to set up sheds for the two langars at the site. Jaspaal Singh (58) from Faridkot said a number of items come in from Singhu and Tikri borders. When we need something, we tap our networks there. Apart from that, people from Delhi come to our aid. The day it rained, a few sewadaars came and gave us material to set up tents, including asbestos, logs of wood, nails and hammers.As the evening set in, both langars had been sheltered from the drizzle, and farmers said they no longer had to worry about cooking in the rain.","Corn to onions — Burari ground, once feared as a ‘jail’, now a field for farmers",RICE

Under the mission, strategy was devised to increase household consumption of millets by reviving its production in identified areas and improving their productivity.Millet was included in Mid-Day Meal, Integrated Child Development Service and Public Distribution System.Initially, millet cultivation, which was started in 30 blocks in 7 districts in 2017, was expanded to 55 blocks in 11 districts in 2018 and to 72 blocks (14 districts) in 2019. Another 4 blocks were added in the June 2020.There has been increase in area under millets cultivation from 2,949 hectares to 5,182 hectares (almost double) and increase in yield by 120% between 2016-17 to 2017-18, says the apex policy think-tank of Centre.As many 26,495 farmers were registered under the mission whereas almost 95% of millet was procured from farmers in 2019-20.NITI Ayog attributed success of the millet mission to Ragi procurement from local farmers at minimum support price, farmer registration, establishment of district wise storage godowns and streamline of procurement system.In 14 districts procuring Ragi, 1 kg of rice has been substituted by Ragi owing to its higher nutritional value. It was distributed at the rate of 1 per kg under PDS scheme in six districts to 16,01,206 ration card holders under National Food Security Act.",NITI Aayog hails millet revival in Odisha,RICE

(Source: Getty Images/Thinkstock)There is a lot of debate about the health benefits of brown rice vs white rice. Many people believe that brown rice, which is unrefined, is the healthier variety, and also helps one lose weight as compared to white rice which contains starch. However, are these beliefs true?Nutritionist Rashi Chowdhary recently took to Instagram to bust some such myths, and answer a few commonly-asked questions.I know you think brown rice is better than white because its unrefined and contains more nutrients. Well, not necessarily, she said.Heres why white rice may be better compared to most grains.*Whole grains can be hard for the body to digest, especially if you have a sensitive gut.The outer layer of all grains, including brown rice, contains phytic acid which is an anti-nutrient and can cause digestive distress. Nature does this when a grain (which is essentially a seed) hits the earth and sprouts into a new plant. Moisture, warmth, and other soil conditions will naturally release the bran. This is not a problem with white rice as the bran has already been removed. People with chronic digestive issues will have a much easier time digesting white rice than brown rice.Keep a check on what you are eating. (Source: Getty Images/Thinkstock) Keep a check on what you are eating. (Source: Getty Images/Thinkstock)*White rice does not contain gluten or any of the other possibly unhealthy compounds that are a part of the three main sources of gluten  wheat, barley and rye.*Consuming steamed white rice helps boost your intake of zinc.Getting enough zinc in your diet supports reproductive health, and also boosts your immune system. It also helps you consume a significant amount of manganese. Each 1-cup serving of white rice boasts 0.6 milligrams of manganese. Manganese activates a number of proteins needed for cell function. It allows your body to derive energy from nutrients, boosts collagen production to support wound healing, and acts as an antioxidant to prevent cell damage.ALSO READ | Switching to brown rice may help shed weight*Brown rice has 80 per cent more arsenic compared to white rice. Aresenic is a heavy metal and can lead to toxicity.White rice taste has no comparison with brown rice or any other grains, said Chowdhary.So, what happens to the glycemic index load? We never really eat white rice by itself. Always add extra vegetables or some protein to your white rice to take care of the glycemic index, she remarked.For more lifestyle news, follow us: Twitter: lifestyle_ie | Facebook: IE Lifestyle | Instagram: ie_lifestyle",Brown vs white rice: Which is better?,RICE

As a result, the students, many of whom hail from tribal areas, are at risk of malnutrition.When The New Indian Express visited Mallahalli village in Kottayur panchayat, located in Anchetti taluk at a distance of 130 km from the district headquarters, residents complained that the dry ration given to their children at a panchayat union middle school (PUMS) in the locality fell short of the specified quota.Since schools were shut owing to the pandemic, the government had ordered supply of dry ration to government school students to prevent malnutrition among children. As part of the initiative, each student is to be provided 10 eggs per month. Besides, 100 grams of rice and 40 grams of dal are also to be provided to students in classes I to V.For students in classes VI to VIII, 150 grams of rice and 56 grams of dal are to be given. While rice and dal were distributed from May onwards, the supply of eggs started in September.A tribal man in the village, Veerabadrappa, said that his son had received three batches of raw eggs over the past three months -- half a dozen of them twice, and ten eggs once, which fell short of the quota.The child also received 5 kg of rice and 2 kg of dal. Meanwhile, members of three other tribal families in the village claimed that their children received only five eggs, along with rice and dal.PUMS Headmaster Mohan Kumar said that he was unaware of the number of students who got eggs as part of the midday meal scheme, and pointed to the organiser for the details.Noon meal organiser Shanthi said that they were unable to provide the prescribed number of eggs for every student as the supply was short. The school has been indenting for dry ration based on a feeding strength of 100, calculated using the average attendance, while the actual number of students on roll stood at 117. Among them, only 25 students consume eggs.Some eggs also fall down and break while unloading, said Shanthi. Further, she lamented that a few kg of rice is usually missing in every sack of rice supplied to the school, and in turn, the students get less than their actual quota. Bananas were also not supplied to those students who do not eat eggs, the organiser said.Assistant Accounts Officer P Chenna Kesavan of the Nutritious Meal Programme department said that the organisers typically place the indent for dry ration, and the principal may be unaware of it. He further said that the department would look into the issue and inform the Thally Block Development Officer accordingly.Thally Block Development Officer Tamilarasan and Regional Manager of Tamil Nadu Civil Supplies Corporation Bala Murugan also promised to look into the matter.

Each variety was indigenous to a particular region and had a unique shape, taste, fragrance and feature.Narrow it down to Tamil Nadu and youll find hyperlocal varieties like kavuni arisi, mapillai samba... Among them is a rare type called Thooyamalli, a fine-grained white rice that is packed with fibre and vitamins. The traditional rice variety strengthens nerves in the body. Loaded with medicinal benefits, this grain delays ageing of internal organs, keeps the mind active and skin healthy, Balaji had said.Three years hence, the rice variety still remains largely unknown to even the local populace. Having originated and first sown in Tamil Nadu, it was once a thriving staple across the state. However, market preferences have pushed farmers to sow more popular varieties of rice, making Thooyamalli a rarity. This rice is named after the jasmine flower (Thooya means pure and malli means jasmine), as during the flowering stage, the grains of the rice look and smell like the bud of the fragrant flower.Throughout the historic accounts of this rice variety, farmers have preferred Thooyamalli over others for its influence in building nerve strength and a healthy immune system. Its often used to make fragrant rice dishes like biryani. K Vijayalakshmi, author of Traditional Rice Varieties of Tamil Nadu, and research director at Centre for Indian Knowledge Systems, which has been conserving and upscaling these traditional varieties for the last 26 years, says, This type of rice is the easiest to farm. It naturally repels pests and is extremely nutritious for humans. In fact, it is known to improve nerve strength and eyesight. She shares three important benefits of the native variant.Smooth digestionThe rice has proven to be great for digestion. It has a good amount of fibre content in its composition. This property helps in loosening the bowels and improving the movement of digesting food in the intestine. The fibres in this grain are also influential in repairing the wear and tear of internal organs and boosting immunity.Weight lossWith protein, magnesium, calcium, iron and zinc in it, Thooyamalli rice contains the perfect composition to help regulate a healthy and balanced diet. These grains are also packed with just the right amount of carbohydrates, which aids in healthy weight loss over time.Boosts calcium levelsThooyamalli rice is high in protein and calcium. It is often recommended for children, pregnantand lactating mothers and athletes. It is also considered as good fat that the body burns easily, owing to its property of being easy to digest.THOOYAMALLI BIRYANIIngredientsThooyamalli rice: 1 tumblerCarrot (small): 2Beans: 10Capsicum: 2Garlic: 10 podsGreen chillies: 2Ghee: 2 tspCinnamon stick: an inchCardamom: 2Cloves: 2METHOD",A fistful of fragrance and flavour,RICE

(Source: Getty Images/Thinkstock)COVID-19 presents itself with various symptoms like fever, dry cough, and headache. But these symptoms are also common in people who have stomach flu, or any gastrointestinal issues (GI) like nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. So, how does one determine the difference? Indianexpress.com reached out to medical experts to understand more about stomach flu, which is also known as gastroenteritis and the precautions and treatment for the same.What is gastroenteritis?Viral gastroenteritis can be termed as an intestinal infection accompanied by watery diarrhea, abdominal cramps, nausea, fever, and vomiting. This infection can be a matter of concern during winters. You will also be shocked to know that it can be life-threatening for infants, older adults, and people with a compromised immune system. Hence, it is essential to keep stomach flu at bay by adhering to vital tips like hand washing and avoiding cross-contamination of food, said Dr Suresh Birajdar, consultant paediatrician and neonatologist, Motherhood Hospital, Kharghar, Mumbai.What are the causes?Stomach flu is caused by norovirus, which is also known as the winter vomiting bug. It can be caused due to coming in contact with an infected person or by eating contaminated food and water. One may experience chills, fever, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, aches, and even pains, he said.It may spread to people in confined spaces; which means that transmission from one-person-to-other is also possible. Another cause can be rotavirus. Adults who are infected with rotavirus will not showcase symptoms but still may pass it on to others, added Dr Birajdar.ALSO READ | Probiotics wont help kids with stomach flu: StudyHow is stomach flu different from COVID-19?Heres what to know about stomach flu. (Source: Getty Images/Thinkstock) Heres what to know about stomach flu. (Source: Getty Images/Thinkstock)Almost 20 per cent of COVID-infected patients are reporting GI symptoms like diarrhoea with no apparent lung issues, said Dr Monika Jain, chief of gastroenterology and hepatology, Sri Balaji Action Medical Institute. Agreed Dr Sukrit Singh Sethi, consultant, gastroenterology and hepatology, Narayana Hospital Gurugram, who shared that a recent study published in the American Journal of Gastroenterology noted how diarrhoea commonly occurs in people with COVID-19, with 19.4 per cent of the subjects experiencing diarrhoea as their first symptom. Additionally, researchers at Stanford University found that up to 30 per cent of patients with mild COVID-19 had symptoms affecting the digestive system.If the patient comes with COVID symptoms in the form of cough, sore throat etc., followed by GI symptoms, then COVID is likely to be present and it is easy to detect. But the challenge lies in detecting COVID in cases where GI symptoms are apparent but respiratory symptoms are lacking, said Dr Jain, adding that symptoms like nausea, vomiting, pain abdomen, loss of appetite are also commonly reported in COVID patients. It is, therefore, imperative to be tested and treated for the same.Following are the conditions when a patient has to be admitted to the hospital without delay:*Persistent severe diarrhoea*Abdominal pain*Decreased urine output or altered sensoriumTreatmentMany Indian households rely on home remedies, which may be detrimental, said Dr Sethi. Although stomach flu is curable if treated early, in some cases repeated episodes of vomiting restrict eating and also taking oral medicines. If diarrhea remains for a longer time and the patient is unable to take adequate fluid, then this condition can affect the kidney as well. The treatment may also involve medicines and therapies, mentioned Dr Birajdar.Prevention*Amid pandemic and COVID related restrictions, following required precautions, and maintaining hygiene is the key.*Keep washing your hands; dont touch edibles with unwashed hands.*Ensure hydration. Drink adequate filtered or RO water*If repeated consumption of medicines doesnt cure the symptoms, then one should seek expert help.*Avoid eating out, or unhygienic and unhealthy food.*Do not share any personal items with others. You will have to use separate towels, napkins, plates, utensils, and bedding.*Make sure you clean and disinfect door, knobs, and other surfaces on a weekly basis.*Opt for ginger or peppermint tea that can help you deal with symptoms of nausea and vomiting. Eating bananas and even rice can be a good option. Give up on spicy, oily, and dairy products.*Motivate children to stay hydrated by drinking a lot of water, and rest as much as they can. Likewise, older people may have high chances of dehydration so tackle it by fueling the body with water.For more lifestyle news, follow us: Twitter: lifestyle_ie | Facebook: IE Lifestyle | Instagram: ie_lifestyle",What you must know about stomach flu in winter amid pandemic,RICE

(AP)CAIRO: Sudan on Wednesday said it signed the Abraham Accords with the US, paving the way for the African country to normalise ties with Israel .A statement from the office of Sudan's prime minister said Justice Minister Nasredeen Abdulbari signed the accord Wednesday with visiting US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.The recent US-negotiated deals between Arab countries and Israel have been a major foreign policy achievement by President Donald Trump 's administration . The deals were named the Abraham Accords after the biblical patriarch revered by Muslims and Jews.The signing came just over two months after Trump announced that Sudan would start to normalize ties with Israel.Before Sudan, the Trump administration engineered diplomatic pacts late last year between Israel and the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain  the first since Jordan recognized Israel in the 1990s and Egypt in the 1970s. Morocco also established diplomatic ties with Israel.The agreements are all with countries that are geographically distant from Israel and have played a minor role, if any, in the Arab-Israeli conflict.The accords have also contributed to the severe isolation and weakening of the Palestinians by eroding a longstanding Arab consensus that recognition of Israel should only be given in return for concessions in the peace process.Earlier, the US and Sudan agreed to settle the African country's debt to the World Bank , widely seen as a key step toward the nations economic recovery after the 2019 overthrow of longtime autocrat Omar al-Bashir.The move came during Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin's visit to Khartoum, making him the first senior American official to land there since President Donald Trumps administration removed the African country from the list of state sponsors of terrorism.Mnuchin arrived at Khartoums international airport, where he received by acting Finance Minister Heba Mohammed Ali, and U.S. Charge dAffaires in Sudan Brian Shukan, the prime minister's office said in a statement.It is the first visit by a sitting U.S. treasury chief to Sudan, the statement said. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in August became the first top American diplomat to visit Sudan since 2005, when Condoleezza Rice visited. Pompeo was also the most senior U.S. official to visit the African country since last years ouster of al-Bashir.Mnuchin's visit came after a one-day-visit to Cairo, where he met with Egypts President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi, a close U.S. ally. The stops are part of a flurry of activity during the final days of the Trump administration. Democrat Joe Biden becomes president on Jan. 20.The U.S. treasury secretary met with Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok, and is scheduled to meet with other Sudanese leaders including Gen. Abdel-Fattah Burhan, head of the ruling sovereign council.The visit came at a time when our bilateral relations are taking historical leaps towards a better future. Were planning to make tangible strides today as our relations enter a #NewEra, Hamdok tweeted.Mnuchins one-day visit focused on the countrys struggling economy and possible U.S. economic assistance, including debt relief, the statement said. Sudan today has more than $60 billion in foreign debt. Relief from its arrears and access to foreign loans are widely seen as its gateway to economic recovery.Sudans Finance Ministry said it inked a memorandum of understanding with the U.S. treasury department to to facilitate the payment of Sudans arrears to the World Bank.The ministry said the settlement would enable Sudan's government to have more than $1 billion annually from the World Bank, for the fist time since nearly three decades when Sudan was designated as pariah state. It did not provide further details.The Justice Ministry, however, announced last month that the U.S. would play a $1 billion bridge loan to the World Bank to help clear Sudans arrears with the institution, in addition to $1.1 billion direct and indirect aid from the U.S.Sudan is on a fragile path to democracy after a popular uprising led the military to overthrow al-Bashir in April 2019. The county is now ruled by a joint military and civilian government that seeks better ties with Washington and the West.The government has been struggling with a huge budget deficit and widespread shortages of essential goods, including fuel, bread and medicine.Annual inflation soared past 200% in the past months as prices of bread and other staples surged, according to official figures.Last month, Trumps administration finalized the removal of Sudan from the US list of state sponsors of terrorism. The move was a key incentive for the government in Khartoum to normalize relations with Israel.The two countries, Sudan and Israel, have agreed to have full diplomatic ties, making Sudan the third Arab state  after the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain  to move to normalize relations with Israel late last year. Morocco also established diplomatic ties with Israel.Sudans economy has suffered from decades of US sanctions and mismanagement under al-Bashir, who had ruled the country since a 1989 Islamist-backed military coup.The designation dates back to the 1990s, when Sudan briefly hosted al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden and other wanted militants. Sudan was also believed to have served as a pipeline for Iran to supply weapons to Palestinian militants in the Gaza Strip.",Sudan says it signed 'Abraham Accords' with US,RICE

(Representational)ANNOUNCED in the 2019-20 interim Budget, the Rashtriya Kamdhenu Aayog lists organisation of animal husbandry on modern and scientific lines among its prime objectives. Now, taking upon itself the mission to infuse curiosity about the importance of cows, it has announced an online nationwide exam where participants will be tested on, among other things, knowledge of Indian cows superiority over foreign breeds, including in showing emotions; cow dung benefits, including in ensuring people were not affected during the Bhopal gas tragedy; the link between cow slaughter and earthquakes because of animals generating Einsteinian Pain Waves; and how India became a leading beef exporter under a cow-eating leader.On Tuesday, the Aayog uploaded on its website a 54-page reference material for the Kamdhenu Gau-Vigyan Prachar-Prasar Examination, to be held on February 25. The material would help candidates get maximum awareness about Kamdhenu Gau-Vigyan, the notice on the website says.The reference material talks at length about the divinity of the cow, mentioning the Rigveda to the Bible, adding, Her face epitomises innocence her eyes reflect peace, her horns, royalty and her ears, intelligence. Her udders are the fountain of ambrosia in the form of milk; her tail, a stairway to the higher regions of being.Another section lists how the Indian desi cow is vastly superior to the exotic Jersey variety. Unlike the Indian cows that have many medicinal benefits, the reference material says, the foreign breeds are harmful to health. And while the former is kind, warm, active, and hygienic, in the reference materials words, no emotion is displayed by the latter. It goes on to list all the indigenous cattle breeds, and to explain what a gaushala (cow shelter) is, and the five freedoms it must aim for.A section called Panchgavya and its Usefulness has details on properties and medicinal significance of cow dung and urine  including fighting all blood disorders and leprosy, as an antiseptic, skin tonic and tooth polish, and for anti-radioactive and anti-thermal properties. Calling its urine a great elixir and as pious as Gangajal, the Aayog says, In 1984, more than 20,000 people died due to gas leak in Bhopal. People living in houses with cow dung coated walls were not affected. Even today, nuclear power centres in India and Russia use shielding dung (against) radiation.The Cow  Environment Protection & Climate Change section starts by talking about parts of the world where people live a pre-industrial life. For example, Indonesian Borneo. Daily life in Borneos upcountry is usually pleasantly dull, as chickens scratch around, the women fan rice on mats to dry it, thunderstorms roll through, the sun dries the muddy paths, flowers riot into bloom, and it all starts over again the next day.Cow Slaughter, Catastrophes and Earthquakes  An Interrelationship says karma suffered bad press under European missionaries who belittled it as fate and fatalism, and today finds itself again in the ascendancy as the subtle and all-encompassing principle which governs mans experiential universe in a way likened to gravitys governance over the physical plane. And goes on to argue, Physicists M M Bajaj, Ibrahim and Vijayraj Singh have proposed the theory that animal slaughter and natural calamities like earthquakes have an interrelationship The theory examines the complex role of nociceptive waves (or the waves generated by the animals on the verge of being butchered) in shearwave splitting which is related to seismic anisotropy The daily butchering of thousands of animals continually for several years generates acoustic anisotropy due to Einsteinian Pain Waves (EPW) emitted by dying animals.Cow: An Engine of Progress and Prosperity says, Reintroduction of cows can drastically change the rural landscape in India but the entire government machinery is geared towards killing and exporting cows. After Independence, it took 65 long years for Indian leaders to realise their cherished dream  to make India a world leader in beef export. This feat was achieved in year 2012 under the able leadership of a cow-eating leader.While Rashtriya Kamdhenu Aayog Chairman Dr Vallabhbhai Kathiria did not respond to email or messages, a query sent to Atul Chaturvedi, Secretary, Department of Animal Husbandry and Dairying, who is the ex-officio vice-chairman of the the Aayog, remained unanswered.An official, speaking off the record, said the reference material for the planned exam was not approved by the government. The Rashtriya Kamdhenu Aayog is an autonomous body, the official said.While announcing the constitution of the Aayog during the presentation of the interim Budget on February 21, 2019, then Finance Minister Piyush Goyal had said it would seek to upscale sustainable genetic up-gradation of cow resources and to enhance production and productivity of cows, as well as effective implementation of laws and welfare schemes for cows.While details are not available about expenditure of the Aayog, the government allocated Rs 310 crore in the Union Budget 2020-21 for a Rashtriya Gokul Mission, to conserve and develop Indigenous Breeds in a scientific and holistic manner.An official pegged the Rashtriya Kamdhenu Aayogs annual budget at close to Rs 1 crore, mainly on account of salaries and office expenses.Kamdhenu Gaumata Exam Syllabus by The Indian Express on Scribd","Emotions to earthquakes, Einstein waves: A govt body’s cattle class",RICE

Palaniswami on Wednesday challenged DMK president M.K. Stalin to an open debate on the corruption charges levelled by the latter.Addressing an election campaign Vetrinadai Podum Tamizhagam (Tamil Nadu marches on successfully) in Anthiyur, Erode, he recalled that Mr. Stalin had submitted a memorandum to Governor Banwarilal Purohit, levelling corruption charges against him and some Ministers. Where did the corruption take place? I am ready for a debate, at any place, and if he has the courage, he should take part in it, without any notes, he said.According to him, the DMK government was the only one in the country to be dismissed on corruption charges [1976]. They [the DMK] committed a rice scam, the Veeranam scam and a pesticide scam, he said. He said the 2G spectrum scam [accused acquitted] had rocked the entire world, and the scam kings were now criticising the AIADMK government.Earlier, he raised doubts if senior DMK leaders against whom cases were pending would be able to contest in the Assembly election as the Madras High Court had called for expediting trial in criminal cases involving elected representatives.At Bhavani, Mr. Palaniswami alleged that Mr. Stalin was holding makkal gram sabhas only to blame the government and deceive the people.Recalling similar meetings prior to the last Lok Sabha polls, when Mr. Stalin collected petitions from the people, he wondered to whom he had submitted them, or what steps he had taken to resolve the grievances.At Punjai Puliyampatti, Mr. Palaniswami said the DMK president had chased away his elder brother M.K. Alagiri [expelled during former Chief Minister Karunanidhis time] to promote his son Udhayanidhi as his successor. He wondered how Mr. Stalin could do good to the people when he could not accept his brother. First let him save his party from splitting, the Chief Minister said, accusing the DMK leader of trying to capture power through shortcuts.Asking whether the DMKs 2006 electoral promise of giving two acres of land to the landless had been fulfilled, he alleged that party men were grabbing land. Contending that AIADMK founder M.G. Ramachandran and his successor Jayalalithaa lived for the people, he said the AIADMK government had taken action against anyone who had committed an offence. In the case of DMK, the leaders themselves had committed mistakes, he said.",Palaniswami challenges Stalin to a debate on corruption charges,RICE

Here's what a nutritionist says. (Source: New York Times/Getty Images; designed by Gargi Singh)The food we eat gives the body energy and helps us sustain through the day. However, a lot of people follow eating plans that require them to skip or include certain food items in their daily diet. But, there are many others who, in general, avoid eating grains, including rice, for the fear of gaining weight. But does eating rice really lead to weight gain? Also, does that make roti, which is made of wheat, a better alternative?Nutritionist Pooja Makhija debunks the many myths of nutrition associated with the two staple grains of India.Heres what she had to say.According to her, carbs or carbohydrates should not be banned if you are on your path to lose weight. Carbs are energy-givers, sleep-enhancers, mood-lifters, and hunger busters, she mentioned.So, despite both cereals having a similar carbs profile, why is one considered better than the other?In my opinion, the choice is in your preference and the way your body reacts to it. Some find rice less filling than rotis and thus end up eating larger quantities per sitting. Thats where the trouble begins and the weight begins to rise with rice, described Makhija, while adding that the culprit is not the grain but your style of eating.ALSO READ | These versions of your everyday rotis are healthier and equally tastyIf you feel rice is less satiating, ensure that the quantity of vegetables or dal that you are eating is more or equal. Similarly, some find eating rotis very difficult to digest because it causes more gas. Thus, they tend to eat less of it per sitting. Perhaps, thats the reason why it is associated with more weight loss, she stressed.So, what should you have?When you are trying to lose weight, no one grain is superior to the other, she said. We eat them for better energy. So, choose the grain of your choice and enjoy eating it. The key is in portion control. Eat roti or rice or both, whatever suits you better, she said.For more lifestyle news, follow us: Twitter: lifestyle_ie | Facebook: IE Lifestyle | Instagram: ie_lifestyle",Rice or roti: Which is better for weight loss?,RICE

In Tamil Nadu, milagu kuzhambu is a seasonal special. During my childhood, my grandmother would serve this curry or pepper rasam with hot rice and appalam during winters, recalls 74-year-old YouTuber Gita Rajamani, who runs the popular channel Agrahara Recipes from her home in Kallidaikurichi, Tirunelveli district. Back then, in Sirkazhi where I grew up, it would sometimes rain for 15 days straight and this curry was a dinnertime staple to keep warm, she adds.During winters, when nights were dark and the stone mortar and pestle kept in the corner of the house was too cold to be held to make idli batter, milagu kuzhambu came to our rescue, says Gita. Made with plenty of tamarind, that Gita says is a natural preservative, the curry would be stored in a stone pot and was good to be had for 15 days. Pepper was the chief spice employed in Tamil cuisine, she points out. Green and red chillies were actually introduced to us by the Portuguese; but now though, we use more chillies.Pepper Rasam from South India which is very common and popular which can be served with steamed rice and ghee.Pepper was used extensively in winter, in curries and rasams. Betel leaves were used to keep lungs healthy during cold weather, points out Gita. I make a rasam with the leaves; once the regular tamarind rasam is done simmering, I place a betel leaf over it, switch off the stove, cover, and let the juice seep into the rasam, she explains adding that she removes the leaf a little later.In western Tamil Nadu, horsegram dal and rasam are winter delicacies and in places such as Coimbatore where the weather generally leans towards the colder side, the lentil is cooked through the year. In my household, we make kollu paruppu (dal) twice a week, especially during winter since the dish is considered heat-inducing, says Dharchana Muruganandam, who grew up in Pollachi. We make rasam with the water the dal has been cooked in; the dish has crushed shallots in it instead of garlic, she explains.Gita says that horsegram can also be incorporated in a thogayal (thick chutney) by grinding the boiled lentil with onions, tomatoes, pepper, and garlic. It goes well with rasam, she says adding that she spent several years in western Tamil Nadu before she got married. Gita recalls a Tamil saying with a laugh: Elachavanukku ellu, koluthavanukku kollu, which translates to: Sesame for the slim man, horsegram for the plump man, because horsegram helps break down fat in the body.Childhood stapleFood blogger Swayampurna Mishra has a treasure trove of lamb memories to fall back on every winter.She says, Im from Odisha, and my mother would make this amazing lamb curry when I was a child. I remember it being made every single Sunday through the winter: it was familiar and spicy and it would warm us right up.Lamb curry | Photo Credit: Swayampurna MishraShe adds that, admittedly, making a child feel warm was not that mean a feat in her childhood home. It doesnt get as cold in Odisha as it does in parts of the North, but I think every person from that part of the country remembers their childhood lamb curry as a winter ritual.Milagu kuzhambu (pepper curry) recipe:Ingredients2 tsp tamarind paste, turmeric to taste, one sprig curry leaves, 5 to 6 red chillies, a pinch of asafoetida, 1 1/2 tsp fenugreek seeds, 1 1/2 tsp cumin seeds, 1 tsp urad dal, 1 1/2 tsp toor dal, 2 tsp coriander seeds, 1 1/2 tsp pepper corns, 1/2 tsp mustard seeds, gingelly oil to saute, salt to taste, jaggery to tasteMethodRoast pepper and coriander seeds, toor and urad dal, and red chillies with two tsp oil. Introduce half a teaspoon fenugreek seeds, cumin, asafoetida, and curry leaves when the pepper corns start to sputter. Turn off the stove. Now, add salt to taste. Once the mixture cools, grind to a fine paste adding a little water. Heat four to five teaspoons of oil in a pan. Add mustard seeds and once they sputter, add half a teaspoon fenugreek seeds, half a teaspoon cumin seeds, a pinch of asafoetida, turmeric powder, the ground paste, tamarind paste, jaggery, and water to get the runny consistency of a curry.

But now, he wants the case in the top court to be withdrawn for participating in the debate, he said, adding, Dont give excuses.

Calling this a trailer of Republic Days Tractor Parade, the farmers made it clear they were not going to retreat in the ongoing struggle against three controversial farm laws.Tractors, far more in number that what was estimated by police, moved to the expressway from different sides. The movement of a long cavalcade of tractors were seen on roads in Haryana from morning to evening on Thursday. Long tractor marches were undertaken on national highways and local roads. Farmers from neighbouring areas moved to the KMP with tricolour and flags of kisan unions. Despite participation of a large number of tractors, the discipline shown by the agitators even impressed the policemen on duty to maintain law and order. Volunteers were managing the movement of tractors by giving necessary instructions to their drivers.Songs related to farmers and freedom struggle were sung to boost the morale of the agitators. At many places, women were at the drivers seat of tractors.At Aashodha village of Jhajjar, tractors were coming from Tikri border and villages of Haryana to get on the KMP Expressway.

There are books, often story based, that will help your child understand gender fluidity, the loss of a grandparent, the concept of adoption.Lately, theres been another turn in the road  books written by Indians to cater to the Indian child with an evolving special interest, whether in food or art, travel, heritage or commerce. Heres a look at five unusual publications to check out:Breakfasts of India (2019) features morning meals from 14 states across the country  from pink noon chai, lavasa and harissa in Kashmir to siddu in Himachal Pradesh, misal pav in Maharashtra and luchi and aloo tarkari in West Bengal.We saw a lack of inclusivity in content for children in India and decided to create and publish books on different aspects of culture and heritage of the country, said Sneha Sundaram, founder of Bengaluru-based Kutuki Publishers, founded in 2019.The book, aimed at children aged three to six, unfolds as a story, with the protagonist, a little boy, wondering what his friends across India are having for breakfast. It goes on to describe the colours and flavours of each dish. Siddu, it tells the reader, is a type of bread that can be sweet or savoury, is made with wheat and spices and eaten with ghee. Puttu kadala are rice dumplings eaten with a black chana gravy. The noon chai is salted, turned pink by the addition of baking soda.Breakfasts of India is part of Kutukis heritage series. A previous release, also in 2019, explored the many New Years celebrated by different communities in India.Ambica Gulatis travel books explore some of the great wonders of the world.From the Great Wall of China to Indias Taj Mahal and Italys Leaning Tower of Pisa, writer Ambica Gulati has written a series of six travel books, aimed at children aged three to 10. All six were published in 2019 as cutout books made to resemble the monument explored within.The books are part of a series called Monuments of the World, published by Om Books International. Theres one on Americas Statue of Liberty, another on the pyramids of Egypt, and a little volume on the Eiffel Tower in France. In each one, a family explores an iconic piece of built heritage in their own country.Details are offered in the form of conversations between the family members, framed in short, simple sentences. I think our children must be exposed to different subjects and to content that is both fun and educative, said Gulati. This travel series with great illustrations aims to do just that.A Brush with Indian Art by Mamta Nainy offers simple notes on styles ranging from ancient cave art to tribal forms to Modernist masters like MF Husain, accompanied by sketches such as the one of Husain above.A Brush with Indian Art (2018) by Mamta Nainy offers an overview of art in India that stretches from the ancient cave paintings of Bhimbetka and Ajanta and Ellora to the works of Modernist masters such as MF Husain and SH Raza and contemporary artists such as Bharti Kher and Subodh Gupta. Theres a chapter on folk and tribal art forms as Madhubani, Gond, Pattachitra and Kalamkari.The content is conversational, broken down into boxes of trivia. Reproductions of the art works are accompanied by detailed descriptions and pointers to online resources and museum and galleries where young readers can seek out more works from a genre or time period.Its really a book for readers of all ages, though its primarily aimed at children, Nainy said. Most children do not know about our rich visual arts heritage or about Indian artists and their inspiring life stories. I felt there was a compelling need to liberate the thought process of children by exposing them to these stories and offering a comprehensive and inclusive idea of art in general. It was also important to show them how any art form or idea changes and evolves over time  thereby encouraging them to think up ideas, explore them visually and bring their dreams, imaginations, and stories to life, added Nainy.The US-based global consultancy firm McKinsey & Company uploads content on its website aimed at children. McKinsey for Kids: Hungry Fish, Baffled Farmers, and What Happened Next, uploaded in October, for instance, draws on images, animation and slides to explains how a fish farming project changed lives in Latin America. It offers information on kinds of fish, what they eat, life cycles and what it took to revive a dying fish farm project.

But going just by the looks of it may prove fatal considering the extent of spurious food that have made their way into the open markets, particularly from Cuttack. The recent raids by the Commissionerate Police are a pointer to the volume of fake and sub-standard food items laced with chemicals flooding the markets.What are you consuming?From ghee, honey, turmeric and chilli powders to tomato sauce and soya chunks, the food adulteration network runs deep. The products are prepared using harmful chemicals, colours and sold to unsuspecting consumers at cheaper rates. A report suggests that spurious ghee is a heady mix of palm oil, vanaspati and yellow chemical colour; honey is prepared using water, sugar and chemical colour. For turmeric powder, the adulterators use waste rice powder and non-edible synthetic yellow colour.The list does not end here. Soya chunks are prepared using flour and ammonium bicarbonate (a levelling agent) that makes the dough light and airy besides, chilli powder is laced with non-edible aniline dyes. The innocuous ketchups that go into your noodles, rolls and fast food are prepared using cheap red, orange and green colours along with a mixture of pumpkin, potato and tomato paste. These sauces are easily available in the market and commonly used by street food vendors.Capital Hospitals Department of Forensic Medicine and Toxicology (FMT) consultant Dr LK Behera says adulterated food can cause serious health hazards and lead to diseases like cancer. Turmeric is often adulterated by mixing wood powder and can cause obstruction in the intestine while chemicals in food products can cause cancer, gastroenteritis, liver and skin diseases, and others, he says.Profits First, Health SecondThe trade of spurious food is booming and food adulterators make a profit of 200 per cent (pc) through the illegal trade as cost of production is cheap.For example, production cost of a kg of refined honey is Rs 200 but that of adulterated honey is only Rs 40 which though sells for Rs 140 per kg in the market, says a report by Commissionerate Police. Whereas pure honey costs Rs 300 a kg and has a profit margin of 15 pc, sale of spurious honey brings 100 pc profit.Similarly, production of branded and popular tomato or chilli sauce would cost Rs 120 per kg but the spurious and low-quality costs only Rs 30. The genuine sauce costs Rs 160 per kg having a profit margin of 20 pc but the fake one is sold at Rs 70 per kg with an 80 pc profit margin.The production cost of pure turmeric and chilli powders is Rs 150 per kg and adulterated is Rs 70 per kg. Unadulterated turmeric and chilli powders are available for Rs 260 per kg with a profit margin of 20 pc and the spurious powders are sold for Rs 120 per kg having a profit margin of about 60 pc.Similarly, adulteration of clarified butter or ghee is equally profitable with the unscrupulous elements earning 40 pc profit from the business. Production of ghee costs Rs 300 per kg and a kg of the spurious stock can be prepared with just Rs 80. Pure ghee is available in the market between Rs 350 and Rs 500, the spurious counterpart is available at Rs 150 a kg.When it comes to soybeans, production cost is Rs 60 per kg as compared to Rs 30 per kg for the unadulterated item. Soybeans are sold for Rs 80 per kg in the market with 15 pc profit margin as compared to Rs 50 for the adulterated product having 40 pc profit margin. Its the high profit margin which drives these spurious food manufactures to sustain, says Cuttack DCP Prateek Singh who has gone after the adulterators in his area of operation.The Market & ConsumersThe recent raids show food adulteration mafia operates mostly out of Cuttack city and Jagatpur which are hubs of manufacturing consumer goods besides outskirts of the Millennium City where they can remain low-profile. The businesses have been flourishing as surveillance by Cuttack district administration as well as the municipal corporation is next to nothing.The consumer base, though, is spread across the region and food class. Much of the low-standard food is consumed by caterers which use the cost advantage to save on spending. Fast food makers are a big consumer base too as they pay little attention to health and hygiene; nor do their buyers.These manufacturers also focus on suburban and rural landscape of neighbouring districts where quality of packaged food is never under scrutiny due to poor surveillance of Food Supplies and Consumer Welfare Department, says an officer.Last year, Commissionerate Police alone registered 21 cases against production of adulterated food items and arrested 25 persons arrested while seizing goods worth over Rs 7.36 crore. This means the overall business of such spurious food manufacturers run into tens of crores rupees across the State, just going by the volume exposed by Twin City Police.Intensifying SurveillanceThe raids have led to alarm but also brought relief from people in general that adulterated food is being obliterated from the markets. Locals have urged police to continue raids at food manufacturing units to arrest the menace. Surveillance is the need of the hour, they said. Apparently, such illegal units continue to thrive due to complacence of the municipal corporations and district administrations. Consider this: Odisha scored only 53.15 pc in Food Safety and Standards Authority of Indias second State Food Safety Index in 2019-20.This index is based on performance of the State on five significant parameters - human resources and institutional data, compliance, food testing (infrastructure and surveillance), training and capacity building, and consumer empowerment. The Index is a dynamic quantitative and qualitative benchmarking model that provides an objective framework for evaluating food safety across all States/UTs. FSSAI states that states scoring below 60 pc score need a push.Keep an Eye on PricesCuttack-Bhubaneswar Police Commissioner Sudhanshu Sarangi has urged citizens to not compromise with price while buying food items as adulterated products cost less in open markets. People must inform police if they find the price of a food product to be surprisingly low.Our raids will continue so that health is not a casualty. We have also requested Odisha Industrial Infrastructure Development Corporation to review the land allotment of the units found to be involved in manufacturing adulterated food items and take necessary action against them, said Sarangi.Food adulteration is conducted to alter the taste and quantity and can have serious impacts on an individuals health. People must be alert, Dr Behera cautions.",Poison on the plate: Markets see rise in fake food products,RICE

The first two were earned within three weeks of each other by mid-November. On December 30, he finished second at Italys Vergani Cup in Bassano del Grappa, to win his third and final norm.The first thing I did was play in the snow, Leon says. Playing chess while taking Covid-19-related precautions was fraught. Wearing a mask resulted in the bespectacled youngsters glasses fogging up when sitting across the board.Going through so many PCR tests and staying away from home for so long has been challenging, the youngster said. Hungary, Serbia, Greece, Italy, Slovakia, Germany, Czech Republic and Spain were covered by rail, with Budapest being the base camp since March.Having his father Lyndon to take care of everything  from booking train tickets, cheap Air bnbs, cooking all meals, checking pandemic restrictions for each city  made the European stay easier. I just focus on my chess, while he takes care of everything, Leon said.Lyndon, a marine engineer now on a sabbatical (unpaid break), was fully-prepared, though the extended stay was not in the initial plan. I carried an induction stove, rice cooker, pressure cooker and all sorts of pots and pans, Lyndon said.Dal, rice, rajma, soups, pasta and pizza has been the staple during these months. There is the cost factor and also it is about health (diet) and hygiene. Right now in the apartment in Italy there is an oven. So I am able to make bakes which he loves, the father said.Violin-chess connectBecause of lugging along all the utensils, some things had to be left behind, like Leons violin. Appearing for the Grade-5 test at Trinity College was put on the backburner. He also had to find new ways to unwind between playing. I could not play the violin, so I compensated by listening to a lot of western classical on my laptop. It (playing the violin) is a form of relaxation and de-stressing after a long and strenuous game, Leon said.Being musically inclined also helped Leon become more instinctive on the board, his coach Vishnu Prasanna said. The coach, who stays in Chennai, and his ward have been video-calling each other.He plays the violin which makes chess more creative for him. Instead of slogging it out, I told him to come up with spontaneous ideas. You have to prepare obviously. I encouraged him to be more intuitive. Like they say in music, you have to play with the feel. Same in chess too. He hated mechanical repetition. Chess can also be approached as an art form. There have been chess players who have been musicians. It goes well together. He would often get into time trouble because of overthinking and trying to play without mistakes, Prasanna said.On his return home, he is looking forward to seeing his elder sister Beverly, against whom he first started playing chess, and mother Anita who is a doctor at the Goa Medical College.My sister Beverly inspired me and I first played against her. My only ambition was to outbeat her in all her endeavours.The Mendoncas have scrounged and dipped deep into their savings to make Leon Indias 67th Grandmaster.Despite support from Geno and Microsense, they stuck to low-cost accomodation and didnt waste a penny. However, there were unexpected expenses.Right from June and July we have been doing nothing but tests. The worst one (most expensive) was in Spain where they charged us 145 euros each for a PCR. This was in Sitges in the Barcelona region when he travelled for a tournament. At some tournaments we were fortunate because they asked for an antigen test, Lyndon said.Nothing short of miracleLooking back, Lyndon says the year has been nothing short of a miracle.There was no question of planning because things changed not by the day or hour, but by the second. So there was unpredictability. Even if we thought of planning to go for a tournament, we did not know if they were going to have the tournament or not because other players also have to travel. Everyone had to test negative. We have always gone through that risk of uncertainty. We would go to the station, book a train ticket and just go. God has been kind to us.","7 nations, 16 tournaments, numerous tests: How teen Leon Mendonca became a GM",RICE

She is too ashamed to say that her husband, an upstanding, respected lawyer, used to rape her.Criminal Justice: Behind Closed Doors is a fictional show. But its central theme is all too real for hundreds of thousands of women, opening up a conversation on marital rape that India refuses to have.For all its flaws  too many digressions, an ending thats too neat  I watched all eight episodes of the show that debuted on HotStar with interest. By week two, 9.9 million people had watched it.It takes courage to push a conversation that evokes almost zero public sympathy in an audience that is inclined to believe that consent has no place on the marital bed. A proudly liberal male lawyer once said: You cannot have the law in the bedroom.But the law is already in the bedroom. Much of domestic violence takes place behind closed doors. In seven states, more than a quarter of married women have experienced it, according to the National Family Health Survey 2019-20. If theres no data for marital rape, it is because India, like 36 other countries, does not consider it a crime.We have a pretty good idea of how bad it is. In 2013, a United Nations survey found that a quarter of 10,000 men in six Asia Pacific countries, including India, said they had raped a female partner. Also, in 2013, Ashish Gupta of Rice Institute, a non-profit, found that the number of women who experienced sexual violence by husbands was 40 times that of women who experienced it from non-intimate perpetrators.Yet, our lawmakers insist that marriage is a sacrament and the concept of marital rape goes against our culture.If culture is a reason to not legislate against marital rape, then here is popular culture presenting a point of view without ambiguity, treating abuse as something that is complex, layered and committed by the best of us.Times are changing, Apurva Asrani, the shows writer whose past work has included the stereotype-smashing Aligarh, told me. This show is positioned for an audience that doesnt talk about these issues.The Supreme Court has ruled that women are not the property of men (the Joseph Shine judgment on adultery). As far back as early 2013, the Justice JS Verma Commission had recommended the criminalisation of marital rape. For women like the protagonist in the show, Anu Chandra, rape by a husband represents not just the breaking of trust but a denial of her identity, autonomy and right to say no.In the past few years, India has broken traditional silences on sexual abuse, on consent, and on the rights of sexual minorities. Its time to break another traditional silence.A popular show might have just begun that conversation.Namita Bhandare writes on gender",The conversation India refuses to have,RICE

Read MoreNEW DELHI: The eighth round of talks on Friday between the government and the farmers protesting against the three contentious agri laws for over a month now failed to break the deadlock between the two sides. While the farmers stuck to their demand of repeal of the legislation enacted by Parliament in the monsoon session last year, the government appeared firm on not acceding to their demand. However, the only silver lining was that the two sides agreed to meet again on January 15.Here are the key developments of the day:1. At the eighth round of negotiations with the 41-member representative group of protesting farmers, the government ruled out the repeal of the laws, while asserting that these reforms have been welcomed by a large section of farmers in various states and asked the unions to think about the interests of the entire country. Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar; railways, commerce and food minister Piyush Goyal; and minister of state for commerce Som Parkash; who is an MP from Punjab, have been holding talks with farmer unions at Vigyan Bhawan in the heart of the national capital, while thousands of farmers have stayed put at various Delhi borders to protest against the three laws they find pro-corporate and against the existing mandi and minimum support price (MSP) procurement systems.2. At the outset, Tomar appealed to unions for discussions on the laws, while farm leaders reiterated their demand that the new Acts must be withdrawn, sources said, adding that the agriculture minister stressed on protecting the farmers' interest of the entire country. ""Our 'ghar wapsi' (return to home) can happen only if you do 'law wapsi' (repeal of laws),"" a farmer leader said at the meeting. ""Ideally, the centre should not interfere in agriculture matters as various Supreme Court orders have declared farming as a state subject. It seems you (the government) do not want to resolve the issue as talks have been happening for so many days. In that case, please give us a clear answer and we will go. Why waste everyone's time,"" another farmer leader said at the meeting. All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee (AIKSCC) member Kavitha Kuruganti, who was also present in the meeting, said the government has told unions that it can not and will not repeal these laws. Around one hour after the meeting, the three ministers stepped out of the discussion hall for their own internal consultations, after union leaders decided to observe silence while holding out papers with slogans including 'Jeetenge ya Marenge' (We will either win or die).3. As the eighth round of talks between the centre and protesting farmers failed to break the deadlock, Tomar said no decision could be reached as unions did not give alternatives to their demand for the repeal of laws. Speaking to reporters after the meeting that lasted for little over two hours, Tomar said the government is still hopeful that union leaders will come with alternatives to discuss in the next round of talks on January 15. But, he virtually ruled out repeal of the laws saying many other groups across the country are supporting these reforms. On whether the government made a proposal to farmers to join a pending case in Supreme Court on issues related to farmers' protest, Tomar said the government did not make any such suggestion but it is always committed to following whatever is decided by the Supreme Court. Sources said the next date has been decided after keeping in mind a scheduled hearing of the Supreme Court on January 11 as the government feels the apex court may look into the legality of the three laws, besides other issues related to farmers' protests. Asked whether the government would consider any proposal for allowing states to decide whether to implement the laws or not, Tomar said no such proposal was made by any farmer leader in this regard, but if such a suggestion is made the government will take a call at that time.4. After the meeting, farmers union leader Joginder Singh Ugrahan said the meeting was inconclusive and it was unlikely that any resolution can happen in the next round of talks as well. ""We do not want anything less than the repeal of laws,"" he said. ""Government is testing our strength, but we will not bow down. It seems we will have to spend Lohri and Baisakhi festivals here at protest sides,"" he said. Another union leader Hannan Mollah said farmers are ready to fight till death and going to court was not an option. He said the farmer unions will meet on January 11 to decide their next course of action. Jai Kisan Andolan union leader Ravinder Kaur was seen crying after the meeting and said many mothers have lost their sons and many daughters have lost their fathers. Sticking to their key demand of the repeal of three farm laws to end their protest, farmer leaders told the government their ""ghar wapsi"" from protest sites on Delhi borders can happen only after ""law wapsi"" but the centre insisted talks must be limited to contentious clauses and ruled out a complete withdrawal of Acts.5. The farmer union leaders refused to take a lunch break and stayed put in the meeting room, a source said. In the sixth round of talks, the three Union ministers - Narendra Singh Tomar, Piyush Goyal and Som Prakash - had lunch with the farmer unions representatives at a langar organised by them. In the seventh round of the meeting, the Union ministers and the farmer union leaders had lunch separately.6. Before the start of the meeting, Tomar met senior BJP leader and home minister Amit Shah for about an hour. Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar also separately met the home minister in the national capital.7. The budget session of the Kerala assembly began on a stormy note as the opposition UDF staged a protest against speaker P Sreeramakrishnan over the dollar smuggling case and boycotted the policy address by governor Arif Mohammad Khan, who flayed the contentious central farms laws. Sticking to the policy address of the CPI(M)-led LDF government, Khan read out in full the remarks against the farm laws, against which the assembly had passed an unanimous resolution on December 31. In his two-hour and ten minutes-long address, he also attacked the central investigating agencies, probing various allegations against the state government programmes, saying they have ""overstepped the constitutional contours"".8. BJP president JP Nadda will reach out to farmers in poll-bound West Bengal on Saturday by addressing them in Burdwan and also kickstart his party's door-to-door rice collection, aimed at underlining its ""commitment"" to peasants' growth, progress and prosperity. Party chief spokesperson Anil Baluni said Nadda will spend most of the day with farmers of Jagdanandpur village during his day-long trip to the state. The BJP chief will hold a roadshow from Burdwan Clock Tower to Lord Curzon Gate in Burdwan and address a press conference too. His address at Krishok Surokkha Gram Sabha (Farmers security village meeting) in Jagadanandpur will mark the beginning of 40,000 such meetings to be held by the BJP across West Bengal before the assembly elections, Baluni said. As part of its plan to collect a fistful of rice from farmers, the BJP plans to reach out to the homes of all the 73 lakh villagers across the state.9. On a day farmers held the eighth round of talks with the government, the Congress said there is no solution except repealing the three farm laws. The Congress also stepped up the offensive against the government by launching an online campaign in support of the farmers' agitation, with party leader Rahul Gandhi accusing the government of betraying the farmers for benefitting their 'corporate friends'. Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra also met the party's MPs and MLAs from Punjab who are sitting in protest at Jantar Mantar demanding repeal of the farm laws. ""The only solution is to repeal the three farm laws. There is no other solution,"" she told the protesting legislators during her meeting with them. ""We have always stood by the farmers and we will not step back,"" she also said while reiterating the party's support for farmers. Punjab MPs Ravneet Singh Bittu, Jasbir Singh Gill and Gurjit Singh Aujla, along with some of the party MLAs including Kulbir Singh Zira have been sitting on a dharna at Jantar Mantar for the last 32 days in support of the farmers and seeking repeal of the farm laws. The meeting of protesting Punjab leaders with Priyanka Gandhi took place at Rahul Gandhi's residence.10. Rahul Gandhi took to Twitter to seek the support of party leaders in favour of farmers. ""The Modi government has betrayed the 'Annadata' of the country for the benefit of their capitalist friends. The farmers have spoken through their agitation. It is the duty of all of us to raise the voice of the 'annadata' and support their demands,"" he said in a tweet in Hindi. ""Peaceful agitation is an integral part of democracy. The farmers' movement is getting the support from all over the country. You too should raise your voice in support of them and strengthen the voice of farmers so that the anti-agricultural laws are repealed,"" he said in another tweet. Congress leaders participated in the online campaign in support of the farmers by putting out their videos on Twitter and sought support for the agitating farmers.","Deadlock continues after 8th round of talks between farmers, govt; next meeting on Jan 15: Top 10 developments",RICE

(Representational)First, it was the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) that, on December 4, revised downwards its GDP de-growth projection for 2020-21 from 9.5% to 7.5%. On Thursday, the National Statistical Office (NSO) pegged the current fiscals GDP growth at minus 7.7%. The figure was even better, at minus 7.2%, after netting out taxes and subsidies on products.These official estimates  along with data pertaining to the purchasing managers index, electricity and fuel consumption, goods and services tax collection, Google mobility index and other high-frequency indicators  confirm one thing: The extent of negative growth induced by Covid-19 and the lockdown hasnt been as much as was initially feared.Food and Agriculture Organisations food price index highest since 2014. Food and Agriculture Organisations food price index highest since 2014.The NSOs first advance estimates suggest that the Indian economy may even register a small 0.3% year-on-year growth in the second half (October-March), after contracting minus 14.9% in the first half (April-September) of 2020-21.But this relative optimism on growth  economic activity seems inching towards its pre-pandemic levels  is tempered by an emerging challenge: food inflation.This also makes it difficult for the RBI to further cut interest rates or even continue with its accommodative monetary policy stance.The NSOs GDP data came the same day the UN Food and Agriculture Organization released its latest Food Price Index (FPI) number for December. This index  reflecting international prices of a basket of food commodities against a base year (2014-16) value of 100  averaged 107.5 points for the month. It was the highest since November 2014.What is significant is how the FPI has soared since May 2020 (see chart). From falling to a four-year low of 91 points then, it has hit a more than six-year high in December.This extreme global price volatility can be seen across farm commodities.Wheat, corn and soyabean prices at the Chicago Board of Trade exchange (for the most actively-traded futures contracts there) are ruling at $6.42, $4.94 and $13.55 per bushel, respectively, as against their corresponding year-ago levels of $5.50, $3.84 and $9.44. The price of raw sugar futures traded at the Intercontinental Exchange has similarly gone up from 13.59 cents to 15.60 cents a pound in the last one year. So has crude palm oil from 3,042 to 3,817 ringgit per tonne at Kuala Lumpurs Bursa Malaysia Derivatives exchange.Export prices of rice (Thai white grain with 5% broken content) and cotton (the benchmark Cotlook A index of Far East landed rates) are also higher compared to a year back: $512 versus $418 per tonne and 86.55 cents versus 78.75 cents per pound, respectively.Skim milk powder prices at Global Dairy Trade, the fortnightly auction platform of New Zealands Fonterra Cooperative, averaged $3,044 per tonne on January 5. That is a steep jump from $2,373 eight months ago.There are three main reasons for international agri-commodity prices firming up in the past few months.The first is a steady normalisation of demand as most countries, including India, have unlocked their economies after May. Even as demand has gradually recovered, restoration of supply chains post-Covid is taking time. Dry weather in major producing countries such as Thailand, Brazil, Argentina and Ukraine, plus a shortage of shipping containers, has only aggravated the supply-demand imbalances.The second reason is stockpiling by China, which has stepped up imports of everything  from corn, wheat, soyabean and barley to sugar and milk powder  to build strategic food reserves amid rising geopolitical tensions and pandemic uncertainties. Last month, the country published a new draft law taking into account new situations and questions posing severe challenges to its grains stockpile security.The third reason may have to do the ultra-low global interest rates and floodgates of liquidity opened by major central banks. This money, which has already flowed into equity markets, could well find a home next in agri-commodities  more so, in a scenario of tightening world supplies.Household inflation expectations in India have traditionally been shaped by food and fuel prices. Retail prices of petrol and diesel in Delhi have, since last year, moved from Rs 75.74 and Rs 68.79 to Rs 84.20 and Rs 74.38 per litre, respectively. Annual consumer food price inflation stood at 9.43% in November.

The new farm laws will not only strengthen the cultivators but also give them the liberty to settle profitable deals with contract buyers. We will make arrangements to get the acts implemented,"" said Nadda, while addressing a rally. He claimed that during the regime of PM Narendra Modi, the MSP of agricultural products increased by 50 per cent.Selecting East Burdwan to kick off the outreach drive was said to be politically significant because the district is known as Bengals rice bowl. The district produces 28 lakh metric ton of rice out of the states total production of 150 lakh metric ton.""The move is aimed to countering the narrative spun by the BJPs rivals that the new farm laws will be harmful to the farmers. The plan to launch was focused at endearing the party to over 72 lakh farmers in the state at a time when opposition parties are slamming the saffron camp over the ongoing protest in the national capital region,"" said a senior BJP leader.Nadda announced that BJP workers will meet farmers in 40,000 booth areas across Bengal and collect fistfuls of rice from them to deliver a message that the saffron camp-led central government is determined to uplift the farmers. Sources in the BJP said with the rice collected from the farmers will be cooked as prasad and distributed among the cultivators in the state.Referring to Bengal CM Mamata Banerjees nod to allow the Centres PM Kishan Samman Nidhi in the state, Nadda said she (Mamata) of is now allowing the central scheme only after realising that her party is fast losing ground among the farmers in the state.""There is no use crying over spilt milk now. Bengal stands at 24 out of 28 states in terms of farmers' betterment. I came to the rice bowl of Bengal. This region had a good record of industrial development. In 1947, industrial output was 25 per cent and now it is 3 per cent.""The BJP will come to power in Bengal and the benefits of the central scheme will be given to the farmers. More than 76 lakh farmers should get the benefit. The people of Bengal have made their mind to welcome the BJP and overthrow the Trinamool Congress,"" he said.Referring to attack on his convoy on December 10, Nadda said it was pre-planned. ""Criminalisation in Bengal politics is clearly visible. I am a person who went through political movements. As far as the attack on my convoy is concerned, we will combat it politically,"" he said.In a roadshow in Burdwan town, Nadda travelled a stretch of 1.5 km. ""The presence of people is unbelievable. They are not BJP workers. They are common people. It reflects that the people of Bengal are all set to welcome the BJP,"" he said.On the issue of the Hindu refugees from Bangladesh and implementation of CAA, Nadda said once the rules are framed, ""we will implement it.""",'BJP will provide justice to farmers after it forms next govt': Nadda in Bengal,RICE

He stated that Nadda will kick-start door to door rice collection Ek Mutthi Chawal Sangrah campaign from Jagdanandpur also.The Ek Mutthi Chawal Sangrah campaign of the BJP is to reassert the party and its governments commitment and conviction towards the growth, progress and prosperity of farmers, he added. Baluni also stated that the BJP ahead of the Assembly elections will reach out to the homes of all the 73 lakh villagers across the state. Nadda will also take lunch at a farmers house in the Jagdanandpur village. Nadda will also hold a core committee meeting of the party in Burdwan on Saturday.Meanwhile, BJP national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya on Friday said that the saffron party, if voted to power in West Bengal, will ensure that each farmer of the state gets `18,000 in arrears under the PM Kisan scheme.The assertion of Vijayvargiya, the BJPs West Bengal in-charge, came days after Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee indicated that she was agreeable to implement the central scheme in the state, under which farmers get Rs 6,000 a year in three equal instalments. The move of the Trinamool Congress supremo, made months before the assembly election, is being seen as an attempt to blunt the BJPs accusation that her party is preventing farmers of the state from getting benefits of the scheme.Farmers of Bengal will get their due after the Mamata Banerjee government goes and the BJP government comes to power, Vijayvargiya said, while addressing a party rally at Nandigram in Purba Medinipur district. The mafia controls coal and sand mining in the state and indulges in cattle smuggling, he alleged, asserting that those involved in such rackets will be driven out by the BJP.

2021-01-09,https://indianexpress.com/article/world/south-korean-wartime-sexual-slavery-comfort-women-7139623/,"Kang Il-chul was 16-years-old when Japanese military police arrived at her home in Sangju, a town in South Korea, and took her away to China. I was kept inside a small room and was forced to sleep with 10 to 20 soldiers a day, she says. The Japanese took everything; everything that was valuable to us, even rice. Rice was valuable at that time because we didnt have enough food. They destroyed everything.Kang, 92, sits in one corner of the living room inside her home located within the complex of The House of Sharing, trying to put together pieces of a puzzle, her short curly hair a halo around her head, more salt than pepper. For at least two decades, she has repeated her story more times than she can remember.Kang Il-Chul is among the 16 South Korean survivors, and one of the five presently living in the House of Sharing. She is pictured here in her living room in a photograph from October 2019. (Express Photo: Neha Banka) Kang Il-Chul is among the 16 South Korean survivors, and one of the five presently living in the House of Sharing. She is pictured here in her living room in a photograph from October 2019. (Express Photo: Neha Banka)The House of Sharing, located down a narrow winding lane in South Koreas Gyeonggi province, is a shelter and museum founded in 1992, for women who were subjected to sexual slavery by the Japanese military during the Second World War. Kang is among the thousands of girls and women across the Asia-Pacific who were forced to work in brothels for Japans Imperial Army from the early 1930s till the end of the Second World War, in territories occupied by Japan, and were euphemistically called comfort women.This aspect of the war years had been hidden till a South Korean survivor came forward in the early 1990s, prompting others to speak more openly about their experiences and seek accountability. Today, only 16 South Korean survivors remain, with five presently residing at the House of Sharing.Portraits of comfort women are exhibited in the House of Sharing in Gyeonggi province, South Korea. (Express Photo: Neha Banka) Portraits of comfort women are exhibited in the House of Sharing in Gyeonggi province, South Korea. (Express Photo: Neha Banka)This week, on January 8, a Seoul court ruled that Japan was liable to pay compensation for wartime sexual slavery, and ordered the Japanese government to give 100 million won (approximately $91,340) to each victim. In its ruling, the court said the women were the victims of harsh sexual activities and were subjected to physical harm, venereal diseases and unwanted pregnancies by Japanese soldiers, that left the women with big mental scars, the Associated Press reported.Japans refusal to cooperate had resulted in delays in legal proceedings. Of the 12 plaintiffs in this case, seven survivors had died while waiting for this ruling.According to a Kyodo News report, Japan summoned South Koreas Ambassador Nam Gwan-pyo and lodged a protest over the court ruling, while Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga called the decision utterly unacceptable. This ruling is likely to aggravate disputes between Seoul and Tokyo.South Koreas historical memory of Japanese colonial rule that lasted for 35 years, from 1910-1945, remains a point of intense conflict between Seoul and Tokyo, and continues to influence nationalist sentiments, domestic politics and foreign policy. While Fridays ruling may be welcome news, it is of little comfort to survivors like Kang. We want the people to know what the Japanese did to us. We demand an apology and legal compensation from the Japanese government, she says slowly, her age impacting her speech. A little over a year after Kang sat for this interview with indianexpress.com, her sentiments have not changed.Since 1992, several Japanese leaders have issued official apologies, but in many instances have also followed up with statements questioning the credibility of the womens testimonies. In the past, Japans Prime Minister Junichi Koizumi and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe have also been recorded making dismissive and inflammatory comments on the subject.94-year-old Lee Ok-seon sits in her bedroom inside the House of Sharing in Gyeonggi province, South Korea.

(Express Photo: Neha Banka)Temperatures have fallen in South Korea and 94-year-old Lee Ok-seon, sits on a narrow bed inside the House of Sharing, wearing an embroidered brown sweater. I was kidnapped from Ulsan and taken to China. I was forced to become a sex slave by Japanese soldiers. Lee was just 14-years-old at that time. Even after the camps were liberated after the end of the Second World War, Lee remained in China. It would be another five decades till she saw her homeland again.I returned to Korea on 1st June, 2000, Lee says. Ive had a good memory since birth, she says with a laugh. Some eight decades have passed since the day she was put on a train to China by Japanese soldiers, but some memories are vivid. It was hard. Receiving the soldiers was the most difficult thing for me.I told the soldiers to let me go home, but they did not listen. I did not know what a comfort woman did or what a comfort station was. When I found out, I wanted to die.Lee says she was forced to provide sexual services to 10 to 15 men each day for three years till she was rescued in 1945, by which time she had lost count of the number of men who had subjected her to sexual violence. After the war ended in 1945, Lee wanted to go back home, but found that she couldnt. I thought that something like a signboard with the words comfort woman was hanging over my head and I was ashamed of myself. I did not have any face to show my family. With nowhere else to go, she remained in China.A photograph showing a comfort station in downtown Malacca, Malaysia, from an exhibit at The House of Sharing.

(Photo credit: Hirofumi Hayashi/The House of Sharing/Express Photo: Neha Banka)In 2015, South Korea under the Park Geun-hye government, came to an agreement to settle the long-standing issue of comfort women. Under the clauses of this agreement, Japan would give 1 billion yen to a fund for the comfort women to be administered by the South Korean government. Japans then prime minister Shinzo Abe had also issued an apology, accepting deep responsibility for the issue.At that time, South Korea had said that under the clauses of the agreement, it would consider the matter resolved finally and irreversibly if Japan were to fulfill its promises. In addition, South Korea promised to look into removing a statue symbolising comfort women, which had been erected by activists outside the Japanese embassy in central Seoul in 2011. Both sides had also agreed to refrain from criticising each other in the international community on this issue.Following the agreement between the countries, where no official document was signed, former president Park Geun-hye faced fierce criticism in South Korea for accepting the clauses that many said were offensive, along with accusations from some lawmakers who called it a traitorous deal.In 2015, the foreign ministers of South Korea and Japan had only held a joint presser, where the agreement was read out in Korean and Japanese. Yet, because each (high-ranking) official made the statement in front of the worlds media, it is, as bizarre and self-defeating agreement as it is, still an international agreement, explains Professor Lee Sung-yoon, Kim Koo-Korea Foundation Professor in Korean Studies and Assistant Professor, The Fletcher School, Tufts University.This 2015 agreement still distresses Lee, who believes that the South Korean government unilaterally made decisions, prioritising its own interests, without consulting the surviving comfort women in the country. It is not only the Japanese government, the Korean government is also responsible for this, she says of the 2015 agreement.It was a deeply flawed agreement as what is essentially a matter of crime against humanity in principle (but without legal application to actions taken in the 1930s and 1940s) and must be remembered and discussed in perpetuity, says Professor Lee.But this weeks ruling, he says, is largely political a stratagem for the South Korean government to score political points by appealing to ethnonationalism and a sense of justice. Professor Lee believes that from a legal perspective, the ruling may just set a new precedent for a violation of international agreements and treaties. He points to the treaty of 1965 between Japan and South Korea that addressed the settlement of issues in regard to property, claims and aspects of what it termed economic cooperation. Through the terminology used in the treaty, Japan had made it clear that it was not offering reparations.Kang Il-chul describes her experiences in a comfort station in China where she was kept by the Japanese Imperial Army, during an interview in October 2019. (Express Photo: Neha Banka) Kang Il-chul describes her experiences in a comfort station in China where she was kept by the Japanese Imperial Army, during an interview in October 2019. (Express Photo: Neha Banka)According to clauses of this treaty, all issues between the two countries that were a result of Japans colonisation and the Second World War, had been settled finally and completely. But eldery survivors of Japans wartime sexual slavery and forced labour have been pursuing independent claims through legal systems for years, often aided by rights groups. In 2017, survivors and the rights groups got an unexpected boost after South Koreas President Moon Jae-in took office and openly expressed support for their endeavours.In 2018, South Koreas Supreme Court ruled in favour of South Koreans seeking compensation from Japans Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal over the issue of being subjected to forced labor during Japanese colonial rule. A few months after this ruling, in a separate lawsuit, the Supreme Court ordered Japans Mitsubishi Heavy Industries to compensate 10 South Korean nationals for being forced to build ships and aircraft for Japans war ambitions in 1944.Japan rejected these rulings, issuing sharp criticism, because from Tokyos perspective, Professor Lee explains, it appears that these lawsuits filed against the Japanese government and organisations were construed as having violated the norms of state sovereign immunity but also a breach of basic trust in the bilateral relationship.Kang Il-chul walks back to her room inside The House of Sharing, in Gyeonggi province, South Korea, after this interview in October 2019. (Express Photo: Neha Banka) Kang Il-chul walks back to her room inside The House of Sharing, in Gyeonggi province, South Korea, after this interview in October 2019. (Express Photo: Neha Banka)During the 2018 ruling, South Koreas Supreme Court had rejected the argument that the treaty of 1965 had put an end to the matter. The treaty does not cover the right of the victims of forced labor to compensation for crimes against humanity committed by a Japanese company in direct connection with the Japanese governments illegal colonial rule and war of aggression against the Korean Peninsula, the court had said in a statement.Relations between Seoul and Tokyo deteriorated following the 2018 court ruling and the conflict escalated into a trade war between the two countries. Both countries downgraded the others trade status and Seoul went one step further by threatening to end a trilateral military intelligence-sharing agreement signed in 2016 between South Korea, Japan and the US.In a blog post in 2020 for Origins, published by the Ohio State University and Miami University, Professor Lee had said that the South Korean Supreme Courts argument in the 2018 ruling was weak because the 1965 treaty predates the establishment of the International Criminal Court (ICC) per the Rome Statute in 1998.My point is that South Korea does not have jurisdiction over Japanese companies or the Japanese government for actions that happened before 1945, he explains. Ex post facto criminalization of the Japanese states offenses, as cathartic and just in principle as it may be, is a faulty legal argument. Imperialism and colonization are always exploitative. They are always cruel. But reconciliation and atonement must come from historical writing, public discourse, cultural contact, foreign aid, etc., not by formal government reparations.Following the Seoul courts latest ruling, while in theory, the South Korean government could proceed and seize any Japanese property within its territorial jurisdiction, for instance, the Japanese embassy and the Japanese Cultural Center in Seoul and the Japanese consulate in Busan, Professor Lee believes that such moves would amount to a salvo to breaking off the diplomatic relationship. The impact would have wider implications for South Korean politics and economy and would be risks that the Moon administration may not be willing to take.A photograph showing a structure used as a comfort station for coal miners in Chikuho, Kyushu, Japan, from an exhibit at The House of Sharing.

(Photo credit: Rumiko Nishino/The House of Sharing/Express Photo: Neha Banka)The legacy of Japanese colonisation is always in the background when it comes to geopolitics in East Asia, but especially in the case of South Korea and Japan, with both sides unvaryingly accusing the other of deliberate provocation. In 2013 when Shinzo Abe made visits to the Yasukuni shrine, a controversial war memorial which honours Japans war dead, but also 14 convicted war criminals, both China and South Korea issued strong objections. In 2020, days after Abe stepped down as prime minister, he made yet another public visit to the shrine, one that was sharply criticised by North Korea. Seoul, Beijing and Pyongyang have considered these visits by Japanese leaders a show of a lack of remorse for Japans colonial brutality and war crimes during the Second World War.The fierce public backlash to the 2015 agreement also prevented the South Korean government from removing the bronze statue symbolising comfort women, which had been erected by activists outside the Japanese embassy in central Seoul in 2011. Every Wednesday since 1992, a small group of protestors gather outside the embassy, calling for accountability and justice, in what they call the Wednesday Demonstrations.At a Wednesday Demonstration taking place outside the Japanese embassy in central Seoul, South Korea, a protestor cleans the statue symbolising comfort women in October 2019.

(Express Photo: Neha Banka)Two days after the 2015 agreement was signed, a group called the Anti-Abe and Anti-Japan Joint Action set up a small tent just beside the bronze statue, and has been sitting in permanent protest outside the Japanese embassy, with volunteers manning the tent round the clock, regardless of weather conditions. Protecting the embassy are several buses belonging to the city police and a dozen policemen on both sides of the street.On a cold Autumn morning in Seoul, two 20-year-old women sit, huddled in long puffy coats, with their tent having been unexpectedly taken down.

(Express Photo: Neha Banka)The tent is down, they explain, because they were forced to do so by the local Jongno District office, but the city government was unable to remove the women from the protest site. We are fighting with the Japanese embassy. Its difficult but we can do it. We see the embassy everyday, says one woman, both requesting anonymity.The Seoul city governments attempts to remove the protest site shouldnt come as a surprise, Professor Lee says. (President) Moon seeks to mend fences with Tokyo and use the Summer Olympics as a stage for a summit meeting with Kim Jong Un. While Kim is unlikely to show up in Tokyo as one among many, that has been the main incentive for Seouls de-escalation in recent months.The statue symbolising comfort women sits facing the Japanese embassy in central Seoul. (Express Photo: Neha Banka) The statue symbolising comfort women sits facing the Japanese embassy in central Seoul. (Express Photo: Neha Banka)It is also complex domestic politics at play: when anti-Japanese stance is prescribed, the lower officials follow. When the mood swings the other way, the lower officials are quick to catch on and discourage anti-Japanese protests by civic groups. Following the coronavirus outbreak in 2020, the city government appears to have cleared the tent citing public health protocols, but the protestors have continued demonstrating at the site outside the embassy.A photograph showing the entrance to a comfort station for the Japanese military in Nanking, China, from an exhibit at The House of Sharing.

The museum at the House of Sharing has extensive archives of photographs, recorded testimonies, manuscripts, etc. that document the war years and the womens experiences.Some survivors who had retained objects from their time in the Japanese military camps later donated them to the House of Sharing and other similar institutions for research and archival purposes. When asked about whether she did something similar, Lee laughs: No, I only have oral testimonies as evidence.Suddenly, her voice cracks. Of course it is very hard. It is still hard to make a testimony in public. Although so much time has passed, I was just a 14-year-old girl (then). I still feel pain when I remember that time.Demonstrators at a rally outside the Japanese Embassy in Seoul in June gathered around a statue symbolizing a woman forced into wartime sexual slavery.

Therefore, we have decided to launch weeklong Krishak Bhoj campaign from January 24 in 40,000 Gram Sabhas in West Bengal to make them understand the actual benefits of farmers policies and schemes launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi The farm laws will make farmers free. These laws will enable farmers to set the price of their produce and choose buyers, Nadda said as he launched the partys Krishak Suraksha Abhiyan and Ek Mutho Chal campaign at a village in East Burdwan district, considered the states rice bowl.Ever since Modiji became the Prime Minister, he has increased the budget for farmers to more than six times. He also implemented the Swaminathan Commission reports recommendations and increased the Minimum Support Price (MSP) by nearly 50 per cent. But here in Bengal, Didi (Mamata Banerjee) blocks all the Central schemes and deprives the poor and farmers of availing the benefits, he added.Accusing the Chief Minister of depriving over 70 lakh farmers of the state the benefits of the Centres flagship PM-KISAN scheme, he said: The Mamata Banerjee government agreed to implement the PM Kisan Samman Nidhi after such a long time as she has realised that the TMC is fast losing ground in Bengal. But, let me say it clearly that it is already too late for the TMC government.The TMC government will be surprised to know that more than 23 lakh farmers from Bengal have made online registration for the scheme and the state government has halted the verification process, Nadda alleged.He also accused the Chief Minister of blocking the Centres Ayushman Bharat scheme in the state.In a veiled attack on Trinamool MP and Mamata Banerjees nephew Abhishek Banerjee, Nadda said: Our target is to ensure good governance and development in West Bengal and on the other side the rajkumar is busy minting money. Now the people of Bengal have to decide what they want.He also targeted the TMC and Chief Minister Banerjee over allegations of corruption in Cyclone Amphan relief, alleging that TMC leaders siphoned off money and food grains sent by the Centre for the cyclone-hit people.The BJP leader, whose convoy was pelted with stones during a roadshow last time, hit out at the TMC over the latters outsider jibe. You (TMC) dont represent Bengali culture, you represent anarchy. But we (BJP) represent good administration, Nadda said at a press meet in Burdwan.Nadda questioned whether attaching adjectives to his name and attacking his convoy was a part of West Bengals culture.In a recent video, Mamata Banerjee was seen purportedly mocking Naddas surname.There have been discussions by the TMC on people coming from outside West Bengal but what about the acts committed by the party and its chief that go against the traditions, heritage and culture of the state, Nadda asked while addressing people during a roadshow earlier in the day. I want to ask you if hurling objects at my convoy in Diamond Harbour is a part of West Bengals culture. I want to ask the TMC if extortion activities by syndicates in coal, cattle and sand smuggling and taking cut-money goes in sync with the states culture. The answer is no. TMC has lost the right to talk about West Bengals culture.He said that he also knows Bengali culture as his wife is a Bengali. Hum bhi topor pehen ke shaadi karne gaye the. (I also wore topor for my wedding) We respect Bengali culture. This is indeed a very rich culture. We used to learn from Bengali culture, he added as he concluded his speech with Jai Maa Durga, Jai Maa Kali slogan. .Nadda also visited Radha-Krishna temple at Jaganandpur village and Sarbamangala Mandir in Burdwan town.Nadda, who was accompanied by state BJP leaders, including the partys state unit chief Dilip Ghosh, also had lunch at the house of a farmer.","Farm laws will set farmers free, too late for Bengal to implement PM-KISAN: Nadda",RICE

Under the Rice Brigade initiative, scientists from the KVK will impart training on planting paddy seedlings.According to the officials, those willing to associate themselves with the programme can earn Rs 4,000 to Rs 5,000 from planting seedlings on one acre of paddy field. The programme will enable unemployed youths to earn a decent living during the present crisis triggered by Covid-19.We want more youngsters to enrol for the programme which provides them green jobs. Four or five people can complete the planting of paddy seedlings on one acre of land within five to six hours. This means one person can earn close to Rs 1,000 for a single days toil. Its potential should attract the youth. The youngsters must take up agricultural work in the same manner as they will do catering jobs and enjoy mud football, said P K Abdul Jabbar, a scientist with the Kendra.A major advantage enjoyed by the district over the others is the kole fields spread across 650 hectares. The kole fields will be used to provide green jobs to youngsters under the programme. Jabbar says the Rice Brigade programme will help create a vital association between youths and farmers in the district. Migrant labourers utilise the opportunities available for carrying out farming in the state. Every season, migrant labourers earn over Rs 3 crore from agricultural activities in Malappuram alone. Last year, people from Chhattisgarh flew down here to do the planting jobs. Youngsters and jobless people are reluctant to take up farming jobs due to a sense of shame over performing such tasks Our aim is to create a sense of pride among the youth for doing agricultural activities. The programme will also make them understand that they should be part of the nation-building process by helping out farmers.KVK has already provided training to more than 50 youngsters in the district. The institute has also developed a team of farmers in the district who can work with youngsters as part of the programme. Youth clubs, organisations and individuals can take up the work on contract basis. Those interested should get in touch with the officials at the following number: 9447228022. As of now, youngsters are only taught how to plant seedlings. But in the future, exhaustive training on paddy cultivation and employing all types of crop growing methods will be provided.

As diverse as the food offerings in our country are, the science behind them is even more so. And of the veritable army of reluctant chefs created in urban India during lockdown, at least a few must prefer learning these hows and whys, instead of the how-many-teaspoons. That is the gamble Krish Ashok and Penguin Random House have taken with their recent book Masala Lab: The Science of Indian Cooking.With chapters covering everything from zero-pressure cooking to the science of spices and more, the title offers explanations and cheat sheets galore. Tongue-in-cheek writing coupled with scientific explanations by experts make up a large portion of this book, and the result is oddly gripping. Take, for instance, a small segment titled Mouthfeel  Ashok begins by describing the crunch of a pani puri before moving into an aside about decibels, bats and the way that ultrasound travels, and then concluding confidently: We can, it turns out, feel a good pani puri in our bones. Quite literally.I keep clarifying that a lot of what I talk about is applicable to urban Indian cooking, that has evolved in a very specific way over the last few decades. We dont always have access to fresh produce, and the quality of what we get  both meat and vegetables  is dubious, with concerns about pesticides and other things. So we tend to err on the side of overcooking, just to be safe, he says.He points out that because of a lack of inherent flavour in produce, urban Indian cuisine tends to be spice-heavy, while that in rural or small-town India has always been minimal. He adds: I would argue that it is a lot closer to Italian cooking, in that it relies on a fewer but more quality ingredients that are grown locally, giving the example of the magnificently tasty eggplants of Tirunelveli.An added segue is his observation that hinterland cooking is simplistic in technique, with fewer steps, because the rural woman has so much more to do in a day, from collecting water to tending to the fields and so on.Freedom to experimentAshok emphasises, A big part of the book is about trying to find generalised algorithms, for how to make something taste, say, Gujarati or Bengali or Malabari. And thus, free people from having to bother about authenticity: if you use paanch phoron and mustard oil, it is going to taste Bengali no matter what else you do.And what better way to look at regional variations in Indian cooking, than through the lens of everyones favourite feast  the biryani? Ashoks final chapter is dedicated entirely to that one dish, from its various layers of rice and protein to the different spices, techniques and flavour notes preferred in different regions. In this chapter, he writes, We will marshal every single food science trick we have learnt over the last 200 pages or so to make good biryani at home. Does he succeed?

Such was the response by artists that the show had to be split into two, where the first will feature works by budding artists till Jan. 25, and part-2 will start in three weeks with a lineup of works by mid-career and senior artists.You find many shows on paintings or sculptures and only a few on drawing so we wanted to encourage the latter, says gallery director Premilla Baid. She continues, You need not be very skilled with painting but drawing, on the other hand, really shows how good you are as an artist.The lineup features artists from different parts of the country like Hyderabad, Baroda, Lucknow and Bengaluru  all of them exploring a range of topics.

He has submitted two works  watercolour and pencil on paper.Mohit MahatoThey are juxtapositions Ive made between images of uranium mines in my hometown Jamshedpur, which I grew up hearing stories about, and stories about my fathers contractual projects, with the flora found around houses in urban colonies in Bangalore, and how people seemed to construct their houses without harming the plants around it. Talking about his decision to participate in the exhibition, Mahato explains how drawing is a fundamental process that precedes the production of paintings, sculptures or prints. It was interesting to see the artists who practise various things strip down to the basics of drawing and be displayed in one physical space, he adds.Nostalgia also reigns in two of A Naveen Kumars artworks. Called Magical Stories for My City I & II, these have been made with cartography drawing on rice paper, using watercolour and graphite. The works speak about his childhood and the food from the places he spent it in. His other two works, I couldnt write poetry, so I decided to be a poem I & II, are also graphite and watercolour drawing on rice paper but these are pasted on plates instead.It is an expression of my life post the pandemic.

Thats how during that time dried and bottled food items especially the condiments like dried onion powder, lemon powder, fried onion ringlets among a gamut of several such other food products.Thats when a city-based entrepreneur Anubhav Bhatnagar, an XLRI alumnus launched a food range with a shelf life of 12-18 months. His startup Zillis is incubated under Atal Incubation Center ALEAP We-hub.The quick DIYs range that also helps to reduce the cooking time have preservatives in them. So while it is about quick food, what assures the same is healthy? Shares Anubhav, The fruits and vegetables have a short shelf life of 7-15 days and they attract fungus and bacteria because of the moisture in them. We follow an age-old technique of dehydration of preserving the food by removing moisture.He cites an example of grandmothers using the process of dehydration by drying chips and papad under the sunlight to remove moisture content.Once dried it can stay up to 1-2 years without attracting fungus and bacteria. Our process is based on the similar concept of drying the fruit and vegetable under hot air to remove moisture content and then making the powder, he adds.He tried making the first product in the kitchen using a microwave oven. I failed multiple times, burnt a lot of onions and garlic to arrive at my desired product. I tried using dehydrated onion and garlic in my curries to understand the difference (good or bad) it brought to my recipes. I was excited to find out that my curries even tasted better and just a spoonful of these powders was enough to bring that natural flavour. Not only did I not have to chop onions and garlic, he says.The powders did not require any roasting as well since they were dehydrated and hence, in concentrated form. This reduced my cooking time almost to half! This is how to we provide RTC products to our customer without compromising on health, he shares. The products that his startup offers are red onion powder, tomato powder, green chilli powder, garlic powder among other items.We also have five blends in our product catalogue and we are consistently working towards launching many more.Kolkata Jhal Muri (Murmura/Puffed Rice) Masala can be used in puffed rice with chopped onions, green chillies, coriander leaves, coconut, peanuts mixed in a small quantity of mustard oil and blended with the goodness of spices which makes it a very tasty and healthy snack.

The four-day festival marks the onset of Uttarayan, which is the beginning of the suns journey northwards.The second day of the festivities, or Thai Pongal, is considered the most important day, and also coincides with Makar Sakranti. This year, Pongal celebrations will start from January 14 and continue till January 17. Thai Pongal is followed by Mattu Pongal, which is then followed by the Kaanum Pongal. The day before Thai Pongal is celebrated as Bogi Pandigai.Pongal means spilling over and it has been named after the tradition of boiling freshly-harvested rice in a new clay pot along with milk and jaggery until it starts overflowing. This signifies auspicious beggings, along with the gradual heating of Earth by the sun.The concoction of rice, milk, and jaggery is then prepared with ghee, sugar, raisins, and cashews, and served to the Sun God first, as gratitude for an excellent harvest. This dish is also called pongal. It is later served on banana leaves and fed to an entire community. Pongal is cooked at sunrise, and in an open space.What happens during Pongal?On the first day of Pongal, people clean their homes, discard unused and redundant items, and light a bonfire.

Read MoreHYDERABAD: Fulfilling a major promise made in last month's elections to Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation , the TRS government in Telangana on Tuesday launched 20,000 liters free water scheme in Greater Hyderabad government .Minister for municipal administration and urban development KT Rama Rao formally launched the scheme at Rahmat Nagar in the city.The scheme is expected to benefit nine lakh families, who use less than 20,000 liters of water every month.The minister issued zero water bills to some beneficiaries on the occasion. He said though the scheme would put an additional burden of Rs.500 crore on the state exchequer, the government kept its promise.Ruling Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS), in its manifesto for Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation ( GHMC ) elections, has promised that all households in Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) limits will get free drinking water from December with the ceiling of 20,000 liters per month.Chief minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao had stated that Hyderabad, which has 10 lakh domestic water connections, will become the second city in India after Delhi to provide free drinking water. The move will benefit 97 per cent of consumers.The chief minister had also revealed that he spoke to his Delhi counterpart Arvind Kejriwal about the implementation of the scheme before including it in the election manifesto.Chandrasekhar Rao also appealed to people to cooperate in ensuring that the water is not wasted. He said if the scheme is successfully implemented in Hyderabad, it will be subsequently extended to other municipalities.In the elections held on December 1, TRS won 55 seats in 150-member GHMC but fell short of majority due to impressive performance by BJP, which bagged 48 seats.Even before its candidate is formally elected as mayor, TRS government fulfilled the poll promise.Launching the scheme, Rama Rao said despite financial crisis due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the state government was continuing all development and welfare programmes.He pointed out that distribution of assistance to farmers under Rythu Bandhu, one rupee a kg rice to the poor, double bedroom housing for poor and social security pensions were all delivered despite the financial constraints.KTR, as the minister is popularly known, claimed that history was being created. ""It's a big day for Hyderabad which witnessed drinking water scarcity and people protesting with empty pots,"" he said and remarked Sankranti has come two days in advance for people in Hyderabad.At a time when other metro cities such as Chennai were suffering from scarcity of drinking water and the same was being transported through trains from far off places, it is due to the farsightedness of Chandrasekhar Rao that Hyderabad was not facing such problems, he said.The minister said Hyderabad was being supplied safe drinking water from Godavari and Krishna rivers. Projects are being taken up to ensure there is no shortage of drinking water till 2048.",Free drinking water scheme launched in Hyd,RICE

Narayanasamy, under the banner of the Secular Democratic Progressive Alliance, against Lieutenant Governor Kiran Bedi came as no surprise, given the strained ties between the two constitutional functionaries. They have been at loggerheads over many matters, most recently on the appointment of the State Election Commissioner, an office critical to holding elections to local bodies in the Union Territory. But the principal issue of contention is the implementation of direct benefit transfer in the public distribution system using cash, instead of free rice, being given to beneficiaries. The agitation was meant to highlight the demand of the Congress and its allies for the recall of the Lt Governor. As a prelude to the stir, the Chief Minister presented memoranda to President Ram Nath Kovind and Union Minister of State for Home Affairs G. Kishan Reddy, accusing Ms. Bedi of functioning in an autocratic manner and adopting an obstructionist attitude in ensuring the progress and welfare of people. On her part, Ms. Bedi has advised him to refrain from misleading the public about the Centre and her office. She has even attributed his anguish and disappointment possibly to the diligent and sustained care exercised by the Lt Governors secretariat in ensuring just, fair and accessible administration following the laws and rules of business scrupulously.With the Assembly election likely in April or May, the Chief Minister leading the protest against the Lt Governor was clearly an act of political mobilisation, even though the Congresss major ally, the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, chose to stay away from it. The agitation should be seen as a reflection of the political reality in the Union Territory as Mr. Narayanasamy does not have any effective Opposition. This allows him to turn all his energy and time against the Lt Governor instead of on his political adversaries at a time when the election is near. And this seems to be his strategy to ward off any criticism against his governments non-functioning by laying the blame at the doorstep of the Lt Governor. On her part, Ms. Bedi should take into account the legitimate requirements of an elected government and try to accommodate Mr. Narayanasamys views on important matters such as the free rice scheme. After all, the Centre itself did not see any great virtue in the DBT mode when it decided to give additional food grains (rice or wheat) free of cost at five kg per person a month to ration cardholders during April-November last year  a relief measure during the COVID-19 pandemic. With the near breakdown of communication between the Lt Governor and the Chief Minister, the Centre should step in, in the interest of smooth administration.",Strained ties: On Puducherry standoff,RICE

Perhaps thooyamalli, a heritage rice variety?The cooker with black rice and dal whistles, puffing steam along with a drizzle of purple-coloured water onto my kitchen walls.I wince at the thought of cleaning up: black rice, evidently, is not easy to handle. But once I open the cooker  after five whistles and 10-minutes of simmering on low flame  the glistening deep-purple rice makes me forget all else.Kavuni arisi or black rice pongal is the third variety I am experimenting with. In an attempt to make sakkarai pongal with heritage rice varieties this year, I narrow down to three: thooyamalli, kavuni arisi, and thinai arisi. The best pongal wins, which I will cook on the big day.Sakkarai pongal is a silky concoction of rice, moong dal, jaggery and ghee. Although raw rice is widely used, several heritage rice varieties make for a great pongal. These include iluppai poo samba, mappilai samba, neelam, Salem sanna, jeeraga samba, hand-pound raw rice, thooyamalli, kuruvai, and thinai arisi, according to Praveen Anand, executive chef, South Indian Cuisine, ITC Hotels.Millet on white backgroundPongal is a festival in which farmers offer to Nature whatever they grew on their land, explains Praveen, adding, The above varieties are grown in the Madurai belt, the stronghold of Tamil culture.Cooking time and the amount of water required, varies for each; Praveen suggests soaking the hard varieties such as mappilai samba for half an hour before cooking.Round 1Thooyamalli is from his list and the rice, slightly longer, but as thin as jeeraga samba, does a great job of becoming one with the jaggery and dal. The taste is similar to the typical raw rice pongal; the rice, a shade darker than ivory, bears a mild fragrance.Round 2Thinai or foxtail millet is technically not a rice variety. But I decide to cook it thanks to a conversation Coimbatore-based A Shrikumar, (who works for an NGO) had with an elderly man from a tribal village in the Sathyamangalam forest.I learnt that people of the Urali tribe make pongal with millets, thinai, ragi, cholam, varagu or samai, says Shrikumar. This is because they chiefly grow millets in the hills. And years ago, when jaggery was difficult to source, tribal people used honey to sweeten their pongal. They also made a curry with the vegetables they grew, to be had with pongal, he points out. They used wild tubers, broad beanswhatever they cultivated.Clockwise from left: Black rice, thinai, and thooyamalli pongal | Photo Credit: Special arrangementI cook thinai pongal in a steel wok since millets do not require pressure-cooking. The tiny round morsels yield well  in no time, they take in the jaggery syrup I spoon in. Thinai has a nice earthy fragrance that is subdued in the end result: what makes this pongal stand apart is the pleasingly grainy texture.Round 3Kavuni or black rice is the best-looking of them all. Apart from the health benefits the rice boasts, I pick it to attempt cooking a hard rice variety. Which means it requires soaking the night before to make the rice pliable. I pressure-cook it: it is easier that way. But before that, I spread the soaked rice on a piece of cloth to dry and dry roast it before cooking.I add jaggery syrup and simmer the deep-purple mix of rice and dal, but the colour remains the same. Once done, I top it with plenty of ghee-roasted cashews. The taste is unique: the rices nutty flavour fits jaggerys sweetness to the T. And the pongal is chewy, with a depth of flavour.The winner is undoubtedly black rice. It is slightly more elaborate to cook, but the end result is worth it.",A kitchen experiment to find the best alternative to raw rice for sweet pongal,RICE

In a recent Zoom interaction for The Hindu Weekend, author Shoba Narayan and chef and TV host Rakesh Raghunathan compared notes on how religious, agricultural and social practices were interlinked in various parts of India.Narayans new book, Food and Faith: A Pilgrims Journey Through India (HarperCollins), is an attempt to understand her faith through the lens of temple prasadams. Calling herself a lapsed Hindu, who was first an atheist in her teens, then agnostic in her 20s, she says, After having two kids, faith was a way of going back to my roots, finding meaning. The journey of writing this book also became a sort of pilgrimage. Despite the current socio-political scenario in the country, she refrains from linking faith to politics, and discusses religion in broad strokes. In her introduction, she maintains that the book is written by a sceptical seeker and is largely about Hinduism, even though other religions make an appearance.Shoba Narayan and Rakesh RaghunathanRaghunathan suggests that there is a stark contrast between temples in the South and Central/North India. Here, we have a mediator who does the rituals, whereas even in Kashi Vishwanath Temple, we are allowed inside [the sanctum sanctorum] to do the abhishegam [anointing of the deity], he explains. Narayan, who also wrote The Cows of Bangalore (2018), agrees that the experience at Kashi was quite overwhelming for her. Thats where prasadam comes in. Food is a very earthly way to approach this faith, she says. Her research included visiting and speaking to the priests and elders, and turning to ancient sacred texts, as well as works by Diana Eck (Banaras: City of Light, etc).Interlinked livesApart from being delicious treats one can look forward to while visiting temples, prasadams can also tell us a lot about the region and society that created it, says Narayan. A prime example of agriculture and how it influences temple foods is the current Tamil month of Margazhi, where Vaishnavite temples serve ven pongal. Hearty with rice and dal, with whole pepper for our winter months and generous addition of ghee for warmth, says Raghunathan. Both he and Narayan bemoan the loss of hundreds of indigenous rice varieties that were integral to regional cuisines. Now, we uniformly have sona masoori, sighs Narayan. Yet the tradition continues in places like Udupis Sri Krishna Matha. In keeping with the four-month fast called Chaturmasya vrat, where devotees give up dairy, greens and other ingredients in turn, around Navratri, they serve chitranna [lemon rice] for the devotees and also offer it to the gods, she says, as this is the period of the fast when lentils are avoided.(Clockwise from right) Bhog at Jagannath Temple in Puri; devotees at the Amritsar dargah; cooking in progress at Azhagar Kovil, Madurai; and a stall in the Palani templesModernisation has crept into the temple kitchen as well, we are told, as is the case of the Arulmigu Dhandayuthapani Swamy Temple in Palani. The famed panchamirtham (the first prasadam in Tamil Nadu to get a GI tag) now has fully automated production. Which is great in a post-pandemic scenario, where we can have it shipped to us, laughs Narayan. But she wonders what we have lost in the process, in terms of the devotees who would come and make the offering by hand, and present it to Murugan. Raghunathan agrees, saying, During my travels, what I have seen is that the most delicious food can come out of the smallest, hole-in-the-wall places.Prasadam picks Paal Payasam from Ambalapuzha templeDosai from Azhagar Kovil, MaduraiVadai from Hanuman templesBhog from Jagannath Puri TempleApart from Hindu temples, Narayan also talks about experiencing the layers of tradition in a Goan Christmas, a dargah in Ajmer, where there was qawwali and kesaria bhat, and being part of a Jewish Rosh Hashanah, or New Year with the Bene Israelis in Mumbai. Each dish had meaning: a bowl of pomegranate signified bounty, there was head of fish and goat..., she recalls. (In the book, she explains that the festival is all about leadership, about being the head, and so the choice to serve these particular portions.) The highlight from the Jewish meal for her was the halva, a sweet dish with coconut milk added for richness.However, theres plenty I missed out on, including the Thirupathi laddoo, says Narayan (both in the book and on video), since it felt overexposed. She had researched Jain and Zoroastrian shrines too, which did not make it into the book due to space constraints. All the more reason for a second edition of Food and Faith, then?Food and Faith: A Pilgrims Journey Through India (HarperCollins) available in bookstores and online at 499",Finding faith in sacred meals,RICE

Earlier, people used to get at least a week off during Sankranthi which would allow them to take part in the festivities in full spirit. With only two days now, people mostly like to meet their relatives, have good food and relax. However, most families do make muggu during this festival.In my house, my mother and I have been making them. I search for designs online and we take turns to make designs with rice flour and fill them with colours. Another factor that comes into play here is the lack of space. We only have a ramp in front of our house which is not very suitable to put rangoli on. The space on the narrow road in front of our house is vied for by houses from both sides of the street.That is why, we have to compromise on the size and designs of our rangolis. During my childhood, I would visit my maternal grandparents house in Mahbubnagar district and enjoy with my entire family. Abundant open spaces there ensured that there were many colourful muggu around."" Dr Siri Challa, dancer and influencerOld customs are dying""People from Telangana usually do not celebrate Sankranthi in a big way. All we do is put muggu and make sweets and savouries. I love the Sakinalu my mother makes. My neighbours too send different varieties of festival delicacies to our house. My memories of the festival date back to my school where we used to have intra-house rangoli competition. They were conducted in my college too. The part I enjoy the most is 'Gangiredhullaata'.On Kanuma, our cousins come to my place and we enjoy different varieties of non-vegetarian dishes. The present generation is not enjoying what we experienced during our childhood. Even if we want to try and make them have those experiences, they find them funny and say it is not their thing. This is neither their fault nor ours. The modern, fast lifestyle is contributing to the sidelining of customs."" Sindhu Katike, actorChange in size and pattern""When I was a child, I would hear the cry of an old woman selling 'muggu flour', which was dry rice flour. Dotted kollams would be a sight to admire on morning walks - their intricate nature and mathematical precision drawn purely by the eye and feel. My mother was so obsessed with the designs that she still recollects ones seen in her native town when she was a child.As she grew older, she would think up and draw various designs, and I have reams of papers and books on them. Though a homebody, she would go around a few neighbouring streets at the crack of dawn to 'spy' on rangolis drawn in front of other houses. With failing eyesight, her trips have stopped, and so have her muggu drawing.Over time, with women participating in the workforce, muggulu became smaller or have stopped altogether. Since it is still seen as a sign of welcoming prosperity, some houses pay their house helps to draw it, but the designs are hurried and out of rote, unlike the commitment of the lady of the house.Migration to multi-storey buildings has made the rangolis a five-inch design in front of flats, and if anyone drew them at the entrance of their buildings, the increased footfall wipes them out in a jiffy. However, yearly muggu making competitions are organised during certain seasons. I see this art dying out in metro cities over the next generation, but as long as there are villages and towns where this is still a thriving form of art, it will still trickle into our major cities."" Vinoth Jeyaraj, wealth management professionalThe tradition is not lost""I do not think the art of muggu making is disappearing, but yes, we do see less of them now. We follow the ritual of making muggu in front of the threshold every day. In fact, all my neighbours follow it. A family member or the domestic help puts a simple chalk one daily. On Sankranthi, we make elaborate ones with colours. The apartment watchmans wife is very skilled in this, and she makes beautiful ones in front of the main gate during festivals.This tradition followed in south India - called kollam in Tamil and muggu in Telugu - is rooted in our culture. A muggu in front of the threshold signifies cleanliness. My grandfather used to say that if we make rice flour rangoli at the entrance, then ants (or other insects) would eat the flour and remain there, keeping the house free from pests.However, I see people putting turmeric powder and kumkum in their rangolis, which is wrong as per tradition. Turmeric powder and kumkum are sacred for us, and if we use them to colour the muggu, someone might step on it. We use these two substances to anoint our thresholds only. That is why, we are told never to step on the thresholds.""

On the auspicious occasion, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath , also the Peetadheeshwar of Gorakhnath temple, will follow the age-old tradition by offering the first khichdi at the Gorakhnath temple on Makar Sankranti on January 14.After the CM, the khichdi sent by the King of Nepal is offered to Guru Gorakhshnath every year. A huge number of people from UP, Bihar, Nepal and across the country come to offer khichdi to Guru Gorakhshnath. The tradition of offering khichdi to Guru Gorakshnath is centuries old. The temple also holds a month-long khichdi fair which begins on the day of Makar Sankranti. Every Sunday and Tuesday has a special significance during this fair.It is believed during the Treta Yuga, Siddh Guru Gorakshnath went to Jwala Devi temple , situated in Kangra district of Himachal, on the invitation of Goddess Jwala Devi. Seeing the tamasi food (also known as tamasic food ) there, Gorakshanath said, I accept only rice and pulses in alms."" To which Jwala Devi replied, Go and bring rice and pulses in alms, till then I am boiling water to food.Later, Guru Gorkshnath reached Gorakhpur situated on the foothills of the Himalayas and placed his bheekshapatra at the confluence of Rapti and Rohini rivers, and started his spiritual practice. People started adding rice and pulses but it did not fill the akshaypatra. People considered it a miracle of Guru Gorakshnath. Since then, the tradition of offering khichdi to Guru Gorakshnath is continued in Gorakhpur.",CM Yogi to offer first ‘khichdi’ to Guru Gorakshnath,RICE

To illustrate the Dhokla mix, flour consisted of Udad dal, Chana dal, Sugar, Salt, Sodium Bicarbonate, Citric acid and Asafoedtida. The ingredients of the Rava-Idli mix were Gram dal, Udad dal, Rava, Citric acid, Salt, Green Chilli, Curry leaves, and Mustard seeds.The advance ruling bench has to delve deeply into the classification and sub-headings. While products such as the Dhokla mix, Dahi wada mix, Bhajiya mix and Idli mix fell under one sub-heading; Rava-Idli mix, Upma mix and Muthiya mix fell under another subheading. This despite the fact that all products were essentially flour and spices.The saving grace, there was no difference in the GST rate, which was the same at 5%. As regards Chutney powder, which was supplied free with a few flour mix categories, the AAR held it to be a mixed supply of goods  this too had a GST rate of 5%.",A ruling ‘unites’ foodies with single GST rate,RICE

Vinod Kumar here on Wednesday, the Chambers, however, suggested that rice exports from Telangana could be made more viable with supportive measures. Stating that Telangana is a landlocked State and the transport charges for shipment from the nearest port are costing high to the exporters, the report suggested that the State could bat for CONCOR (container corporation) subsidy scheme, which is extended to a few dry ports in the country. However, the subsidy is not extended to the inland container depot (ICD) at Sanathnagar.Underscoring the fact that price competitiveness is key to export marketing, the trade and industry body felt that the CONCOR subsidy scheme should be extended to Telangana too and the State government must take it up with Railways for the same.Global marketsFurther, the report suggested that there is every need to establish ICDs in Nizamabad and Karimnagar districts, both of which are over 150 km away from Hyderabad, emerging as major rice belts and the two ICDs at Sanathnagar and at Thimmapur in Mahabubnagar districts are far away from the rice belts.Stating that international markets are agnostic for a product such as rice and always go by the landed cost, the report pointed out that all the rice exporters have been unanimously contending that implementation of minimum support price (MSP) has been adding to distortion of the paddy market with artificial increase in the price of paddy. Besides, new areas growing paddy within the country such as Chattisgarh, Odisha, Jharkand, West Bengal, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh have added to high price variation amongst States.Unless the price disadvantage is addressed, low procurement of rice by exporters cannot increase, the FTCCI report said. It has strongly suggested to give subsidy to rice exporters to make the price on a par with other States.The Federation of Telangana Chambers of Commerce and Industry asked the State government to address the price variation by following Taiwan model in implementing MSP, wherein the government would buy paddy and auctions it to exporters to buy at market price. The system will reduce the burden on market variations but also clears the inventories, the report noted.",FTCCI seeks more support measures for rice exports,RICE
2021-01-13,https://indianexpress.com/article/india/first-rice-now-wheat-india-rides-on-global-grain-trade-bandwagon-7145485/,"After rice, India is set to turn a major exporter of wheat as well  thanks to surging international prices from Chinese stockpiling and ultra-low interest rate money increasingly finding its way into agri-commodity markets.The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) on Tuesday upped its forecast of Indian wheat exports for 2020-21 (July-June) to 1.8 million tonnes (mt), as against its earlier estimate of one mt. That would be the highest ever in the last six years (see chart).The trebling of shipments this year is mainly on the back of rising global prices. Wheat future contracts for March delivery at the Chicago Board of Trade exchange are currently at $244.35 per tonne, 18.3% higher than the $206.59 a year ago. This opens up possibilities for Indian exports to nearby markets, especially Bangladesh that buys mostly from Russia.With the Russia government levying a 25 euros-per-tonne export tax on wheat effective from February 15  in response to high domestic prices  Bangladesh is beginning to shift its purchases towards India, the USDA has noted in its latest world grain trade report. Bangladeshs total wheat imports are placed at 6.6 mt in 2020-21.Traders, however, believe that Indian wheat is still not competitive at the governments minimum support price (MSP) of Rs 19,750 per tonne. The export price of wheat bought in Gujarat at that rate  after adding roughly Rs 1,200 towards cost of cleaning, bagging, loading and transport to Kandla or Mundra port  would be Rs 20,950 per tonne.That works out to $286 per tonne or $290-plus, after adding exporter margins.The above price is higher than the $275-280 that major exporters such as Australia, France, US, Russia and Canada are quoting for March-April shipments. Indian grain, moreover, fetches a $10-15/tonne discount relative to Australian premium white and Russian wheat having more protein content (12.5% versus 11.5%) and less foreign matter/impurities.In all, given our MSP, we are $25 or so per tonne costlier today, said Amit Takkar, managing director, Conifer Commodities Pvt. Ltd.That disadvantage can, of course, be overcome if wheat is sourced at below MSP from Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Gujarat and Maharashtra, where not much government procurement happens. The new crop arriving in these markets from March onwards would be available at Rs 17,000-18,000/tonne. This wheat can be exported by rail rakes to Bangladesh or shipped to the Middle East (UAE, Oman and Bahrain) and Southeast Asia (Indonesia, Vietnam and Malaysia).The USDA report, meanwhile, has also estimated Indias rice imports to have hit a record 14.4 mt in 2020, up from 9.79 mt and 11.791 mt of the preceding two years. The countrys closest competitors  Thailand and Vietnam  have seen their exports during this period fall from 11.056 mt to 7.562 mt and 5.5 mt and from 6.59 mt to 6.581 mt and 6.1 mt, respectively. Both have had drought-reduced crops, with Vietnam recently even contracting 70,000 tonnes of Indian rice for the first time, following China in December.USDA has projected Indias rice imports in 2021 at 14 mt. Bangladesh, which imported just 80,000 tonnes in 2020, is expected to buy one mt this year. The beneficiary of it will again be India. Despite concerns about the availability of shipping containers, which is impacting rice exports from Vietnam and Thailand, India can export to Bangladesh via rail and truck, the report added.All this export demand isnt bad at a time when Indias own domestic production of rice and wheat touched an all-time-high of 118.43 mt and 107.59 mt, respectively, in 2019-20. Government agencies also procured a record 52 mt of rice and 38.99 mt of wheat. This year, too, similar bumper crops are likely.The key driver of global price turnaround seems to be China. USDA data has forecast record Chinese imports of oilseeds (mainly soyabean) and coarse grain (maize and sorghum) in 2020-21 (October-September), apart from end-year stocks of rice and wheat. The reasons for its building strategic stockpiles of everything arent as fully clear as their effect on international prices.","First rice, now wheat: India rides on global grain trade bandwagon",RICE

The House passed a single article of impeachment - a formal charge - accusing Trump of ""incitement of insurrection,"" focused on an incendiary speech he delivered a week earlier to thousands of supporters shortly before the pro-Trump mob rampaged through the Capitol.

(Reuters)The House on Wednesday impeached President Donald Trump for inciting a violent insurrection against the United States government, as 10 members of the presidents party joined Democrats to charge him with high crimes and misdemeanors for an unprecedented second time.Reconvening under the threat of continued violence and the protection of thousands of National Guard troops, the House was determined to hold Trump to account just one week before he was to leave office. At issue was his role in encouraging a mob that attacked the Capitol one week ago while Congress met to affirm President-elect Joe Bidens victory, forcing lawmakers to flee for their lives in a deadly rampage.The House adopted a single article of impeachment, voting 232-197 to charge Trump with inciting violence against the government of the United States and requesting his immediate removal from office and disqualification from ever holding one again.Ten Republicans joined Democrats in voting to impeach: Reps. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, the partys No. 3 leader in the House; Jaime Herrera Beutler and Dan Newhouse of Washington; John Katko of New York; Adam Kinzinger of Illinois; Fred Upton and Peter Meijer of Michigan; Anthony Gonzalez of Ohio; David Valadao of California and Tom Rice of South Carolina.The defections were a remarkable break from the head of the party by Republicans, who voted unanimously against impeaching Trump just over a year ago.The vote set the stage for the second Senate trial of Trump in a year, though senators appeared unlikely to convene to sit in judgment before Jan. 20, when Biden will take the oath of office. The last proceeding, over Trumps attempts to pressure Ukraine to smear Biden, was a partisan affair.This time, Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, was said to support the effort as a means of purging his party of Trump, setting up a political and constitutional showdown that could shape the course of American politics when the nation remains dangerously divided.In a note to Republican colleagues on Wednesday, McConnell did not deny that he backed the impeachment push, but he said that he had not made a final decision on how I will vote, and I intend to listen to the legal arguments when they are presented to the Senate.Trump showed no contrition for his actions. But in the run-up to the vote Wednesday, he issued a statement urging his supporters to remain peaceful as federal authorities warned of a nationwide wave of violence surrounding Bidens inauguration.There must be no violence, no lawbreaking and no vandalism of any kind, the president said in a statement that was read by Republicans from the House floor. That is not what I stand for, and it is not what America stands for. I call on all Americans to help ease tensions and calm tempers.The Houses vote was historic. Only two other presidents have been impeached; none has been impeached twice, by such a large bipartisan margin, or so close to leaving office.Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California implored colleagues before the vote to embrace a constitutional remedy that will ensure that the Republic will be safe from this man who is so resolutely determined to tear down the things that we hold dear and that hold us together.He must go. He is a clear and present danger to the nation that we all love, she said, adding later, It gives me no pleasure to say this  it breaks my heart.Republicans, who stood unanimously behind Trump in 2019 during his first impeachment, were split over the charge this time.Rep. Kevin McCarthy of California, the House Republican leader, spoke out against impeachment, warning that it would further fan the flames of partisan division. But he also pinned blame on Trump for the attack and batted down false suggestions from some of his colleagues that antifa had actually been responsible for the siege, not loyalists to Trump. He proposed censuring the president instead of impeaching him.The president bears responsibility for Wednesdays attack on Congress by mob rioters, McCarthy said. He should have immediately denounced the mob when he saw what was unfolding.Democrats and some Republicans had tried  briefly  to take another course. They urged Trump to resign voluntarily and voted late Tuesday to call on Vice President Mike Pence to invoke the 25th Amendment to wrest the powers of the presidency from Trump for the remainder of his term. Trump refused, and so did Pence.","House, with some GOP support, impeaches Donald Trump for ‘Incitement of Insurrection’",RICE

By deliberately promoting baseless theories suggesting the election was somehow stolen, the president created a combustible environment of misinformation, disenfranchisement, and division. When this manifested in violent acts on Jan. 6, he refused to promptly and forcefully call it off, putting countless lives in danger.Not holding the president accountable for his actions would be a direct threat to the future of our democracy, he said.Rep.

2021-01-14,https://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/chennai/2021/jan/14/thanksgiving-the-tamizh-way-2249801.html,"Kannalmozhi Kabilan ByExpress News ServiceCHENNAI: Arisi paanai pongucha? In some parts of Tamil Nadu, post-Pongal greetings eschew the usual pleasantries to adopt the festive marker of an overflowing pongal pot. The ceremonial pongal, boiling and flowing out of the pot without any hitches itself is something we all look forward to as it is a good omen, says Chokkalingam, reminiscing about the practice in his ancestral village of Pallathur in Sivagangai district. It is local conventions like these, as much as our prowess in jallikattu and manjuvirattu or propensity for sugarcane, that point to the significance the harvest festival holds in Tamizh culture.Going past the restrictions of religion and beyond the concept of God, the agrarian societys way of thanksgiving still finds its place in the conglomeration we live in today; the ways of yore passed on from one generation to another. The excavation at Adichanallur recovered remnants of an earthen pot that bears traces of the depiction of nel kathir and a goddess, dating the harvest festival (or some version of it) to circa 1500 BC, points out R Mathivanan, historical linguist and former director of Tamil Nadu Governments Tamil Etymological Dictionary Project.The first of the Tamizh month of Thai was considered the start of the new year and this was celebrated as a harvest festival. The first day  that is now Bhogi  is considered to be in honour of Lord Indra. Yet, thats not how it started; we have no association with Indra. The first day was called Vendhan Naal (day of the king). People believed that they will get rain only if the kings rule is prosperous. In some places in Tamil Nadu, this day is known as Kinatru Pongal because of the flowers and leaves hung by the well, he explains, tracing the early ways of the festival.Going by this form, every day of Pongal was a different version of thanksgiving, he says. Thamizhargal nanri udayavargal. Theres thanksgiving for the kings good governance, one for the sun that brings in rain, and one for the animals that assisted in the agriculture work, he lists, encapsulating the spirit of Vendhan Naal, Pongal and Maattu Pongal. While Kaanum Pongal is now considered a day to be spent with the family, visiting relatives and such, it began as Kari Naal (kari means elephant)  the day when the king came riding on the elephant, honouring the subjects who had excelled in their line of work in the past year; it was also a day of trade, he says.Keeping traditions aliveToday, while the search for a livelihood has removed us from the ways of an agrarian society, the harvest festival still finds representation in its original form. Vasanth Kumar Pitchaimani moved to the city after the death of his father in 2001. Yet, Pongal in the village of Rajapalayam in Virudhunagar district more or less stayed true to the cause, he says. Even now, Pongal is the most important festival for us. We buy new clothes only for this festival. Luckily, we have enough space in front of the house for us to make pongal the traditional way in man paanai and veragu aduppu.Now, with modern construction, we paint the house only once in five years. But, when I was a kid, Pongal time was when we had the vellai adikara velai. One week before the festival, my dad, brother and I would clean the house. Wed go to the nearest sunnambu kalvai to get sunnambu katti for the walls. The brush would be ready by then  made from thennai mattai soaked in water and Robin Blue liquid, he recounts.Chokkalingam describes what Pongal mornings are like. Early in the morning, all the men in the house get together and ensure the vegetables (a mix of sakkaravalli kizhangu, karunai kizhangu, palakka, kathrikai) needed to make the savoury pongal are bought, cut, prepped and kept ready. We then head to the koil veedu (the temple of the family/communitys presiding deity) to flag off the days rituals and light the wooden stove to cook the pongal. But, before we do this, we usually pray and wait for a signal from the Nagarathar Sivan Koil in the area. After the Sivan temples members prepare the pongal, boil it and allow it to spill, they ring the temple bell.Only after we hear the sound, we start the rituals at our koil veedu. This includes the preparation of pongal with all the vegetables and the sweet vella (jaggery) pongal. Once its cooked, one of the men from the group walks to the house (now phones have come in handy) and tells the women: Pongiduchu! (It has boiled over). Then, the women prepare another pot of pongal at home. We then give a pallayam (offering) to the deity and head home to pray together with our family, he narrates, describing the rituals followed at his village.Close to the rootsInnum kozhantha maathiri pongalo pongal nu katharathuku wait pannuvom, begins Archana Stalin, a software engineer-turned-farmer and founder of myHarvest Farms. I saw how well Mattu Pongal is celebrated only after I got into farming. It was then that I got to know that the cow is important; not the cow dung and cow urine. It is not just about painting the animals. You hear it in cinema songs: maadu ration card la illatha family member. I saw this sentiment in person. Everyone pampers their cows, like the child of the house. Kalyana oorvalam maathiri koilkku kootittu ponanga.It is more eco-friendly than what you see in the cities. The decorations are done with palm fronds and the painting is with turmeric, she describes. Archana, who took part in the 2017 jallikattu protests, says her opinions about the sport were inspired by this real-life co-existence of man and animal. The manjuvirattu (bull-taming) sport in Siravayal village is something popular and what supplements the Kannum Pongal festivities. After Alanganalur and Mellur, Siravayal is most popular for the sport! points out Chokkalingam. Kaanum Pongal only remains a day to sit back and relax with the family, with the focus being getting to eat meat and enjoy perhaps return to the place of work, says Archana.But, villages still hold the charm of the festival intact. I spent last Pongal with my farmers in Thiruvallur district. Then, we had a lot of games like vazhukkumara potti, kabaddi and such. Uri adithal went on till late in the night and by the time I had my turn it was 2 am. And, I hit the pot! she shares. We stay as close to the roots as possible. While some traditions have faded way, we hold on to a few of them. Its hard to find a kudukuduppai karan or a boom boom maatukaran. As much as possible, we do not contribute to pollution in any way.Even on Bhogi, you dont find people burning plastics. In case of an old rubber tire, half of it is buried in the ground and the rest that remains above the surface is used to tie the cow. Its firm enough to prevent the cow from running away. People here are mindful and aware of the consequences. In fact, those that you burn in the city like an old cot or chairs are considered essentials by people here. You can instead donate those to help them, elaborates K Nambi Arooran, who spends the Pongal days at his ancestral village located between Tirupathur and Uthangarai.One for the farmersBut, theres much to Pongal past these celebratory rituals, finds Archana. It has much to do with the resources of the land and life built around it. All the vegetables used in the padayal and through the day are local vegetables. We tend to think of just capsicum and carrots and like when we say vegetables. But, here, it is the avaraikkai, motchai, peerkangai, kathirikai. I campagin for use of local vegetables throughout the year and it is only during Pongal that I see people scouting for these. Vellai poosanikai ku demand athigam. So, I find a lot of connect between the land and the festival.More than Tamizhar thiruvizha, I find this to be an iyarkai thiruvizha, she says. In many ways, harvest marks the start of the prosperous new year  one that has people from all ranks of life reaping the spoils of last years labour. Thai piranthaal vazhi pirakkum nu solluvanga. Even when business is dull, Pongal is a time that traders look forward to for it always gets better with Thai. From farmers, to rice traders to turmeric traders, to clothes merchants  everybody makes money. So, this becomes a social festival, one not restricted to one community or one line of business people, points out Vasanth.While the modern corporate structure at the workplace may have found ways to incentivise every festival, it was Pongal that held that place for the majorly agrarian community. Farm workers, past their kooli were given a part of the harvest as Pongal nerai. This was given to agricultural labourers and those who do ooru pothu sevai, explains Mathivanan. The Tamil Nadu governments practice of a Pongal dole and a hamper of rice, sugar and cane, is a modern-day derivation of this practice, it would seem. Yet, little of this is now of benefit to people in the farming community. Nambi, like many other new-age farmers, is disappointed with the plight of the farmers.People who have a day job like me can invest some amount in agriculture and sustain. While most of the farmers do not have the capital investment so they eventually give up. Most farmers do not have any form of liquidity despite owning farms. We need a proper platform for farmers to network and keep themselves updated on the advancement in technologies. On the positive side, its motivating to see youngsters see this as a prospective occupation, suggests Nambi who has built a small house near his farm that can house 20 people. He plans to rent it out to corporates.They can plan for a day-out to experience village life. People can stay here, use vegetables from the farm to cook and enjoy. While people in the city may have money to buy many things, they cant buy nature, fresh air or peace of mind. My parents celebrated Pongal grandly. My generation is inconsistent. But the younger generation is enthusiastic and highly aware, thanks to technology, he says. While landed farmers find some level of prosperity come harvest, farm labourers find few benefits in the world that has left them working for someone elses harvest.Eppothume maadu meikara vela dhan seyyarom, begins 35-year-old Ezhumalai, who is the caretaker of a farm in Ranipet districts Vellambi. When his father was alive, they were doing agriculture on a land of their own and then, Pongal held some interest. Now, between the farm work, he is having to find employment in the construction sector too to make ends meet. This Pongal, he is busy. He has prepared the field for the next set of crops. Come Maattu Pongal day, he has to bathe the cows and decorate them and walk them down to the village centre. Pongal begins and ends with more work. Ezhumalai too would be looking for the pongal to boil over, but for someone elses pot.A day of tradeWhile Kaanum Pongal is now considered a day to be spent with the family, it began as Kari Naal (kari means elephant)  the day when the king came riding on the elephant, honouring the subjects who had excelled in their line of work in the past year; it was also a day of trade, says R Mathivanan, historical linguist and former director of Tamil Nadu Governments Tamil Etymological Dictionary Project.With inputs from Roshne Balasubramanian and Vaishali Vijaykumar",Thanksgiving the tamizh way,RICE

When I inquired about the bleeding, he had assured me that there was nothing to worry about. He said that the people of Kalahandi loved him and he reciprocates that love and respect.

(Representational)The government on Thursday notified the modified scheme for extending financial assistance for producing 1st generation (1G) ethanol from feed stocks such as cereals (rice, wheat, barley, corn and sorghum), sugarcane and sugar beet.Under the scheme, the Centre will provide interest subvention to encourage the funding in this sector. According to the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution, the scheme will attract an investment of about Rs 40,000 crore.In a statement, the ministry said, To achieve 20% blending by 2025 as well as to meet out the requirement of ethanol production capacity in the country, the Department of Food & Public Distribution has modified earlier scheme & notified the modified scheme for extending financial assistance to project proponents for enhancement of their ethanol distillation capacity or to set up distilleries for producing 1st Generation (1G) ethanol from feed stocks such as cereals (rice, wheat, barley, corn & sorghum), sugarcane, sugar beet etc. or converting molasses based distilleries to dual feedstock vide notification dated 14th January, 2021.To increase production of fuel grade ethanol, Govt. is also encouraging distilleries to produce ethanol from maize; & rice available with Food Corporation of India, the statement said.The Ministry said that to avail the assistance under this scheme, the sugar mills/ distilleries/entrepreneurs would be required to submit an application in the prescribed proforma to the Food Department within 30 days from the date of notification of the scheme.The ministry said states have been asked to promote the scheme to the entrepreneurs of their state and encourage them to participate in the scheme so that the target set by the Government could be achieved well within the timeline.The statement said, This scheme would not only facilitate diversion of excess sugar to ethanol but would also encourage farmers to diversify their crops to cultivate particularly maize/corn which needs lesser water compared to sugarcane and rice. It would enhance production of ethanol from various feed stocks thereby, facilitate in achieving blending targets of ethanol with petrol and would reduce import dependency on crude oil, thereby, realizing the goal of Atmanirbhar Bharat.It will also enhance income of farmers as setting up of new distilleries would not only increase demand of their crops but would assure farmers of getting better price for their crops, it said.The government had earlier fixed a target of 10 per cent blending of fuel grade ethanol with petrol by 2022 & 20 per cent blending by 2030. Now it has been proposed to prepone the 20% blending of ethanol with petrol by 2025, the statement said.According to the ministry, to achieve 20 per cent blending by 2025 and to meet the requirement of chemical & other sectors, about 1,200 crore liters of alcohol / ethanol would be required. Out of a total requirement of 1,200 crore litres, 700 crore litres is required to be supplied by sugar industry & another 500 crore liters need to be supplied by grain based distilleries, said the statement.To produce 700 crore liters of ethanol by sugar industry, about 60 Lakh Metric Tonne (LMT) of surplus sugar would be diverted to ethanol which would solve the problem of excess sugar, relieve sugar industry from the problem of storage of surplus sugar, & improve the revenue realization of sugar mills which will facilitate them in making timely payment of cane dues of sugarcane farmers, the statement said.To produce 500 crore liters of ethanol/alcohol from food grains, about 125 LMT of food grains would be utilized; this extra consumption of surplus food grains would ultimately benefit the farmers as they will get better price for their produce and assured buyers; and thus will also increase the income of crores of farmers across the country.",Govt notifies modified scheme to produce 1G ethanol,RICE

(Image source: Angel Garcia/Bloomberg)Xiaomi Corp plunged 11 percent after the Trump Administration blacklisted Chinas Number 2 smartphone maker and 10 other companies, broadening efforts to undercut the expansion of the countrys technology sector.The US has targeted scores of Chinese companies for the stated purpose of protecting national security, but going after Xiaomi was unexpected. The Beijing-based company has been viewed as Chinas answer to Apple Inc, producing sleek smartphones that draw loyal fans with each new release. The company, which vies with Huawei Technologies Co for the title of Chinas No 1 mobile device brand, also makes electric scooters, earphones and smart rice cookers.The news was really surprising to me, said Kevin Chen, a Hong Kong-based analyst at China Merchants Securities Co.The US Defense Dept identified Xiaomi as one of nine companies with alleged ties to the Chinese military  which means American investors will be prohibited from buying their securities and will have to divest holdings by November.Other firms targeted include Luokong Technology Corp, Gowin Semiconductor Corp, Global Tone Communication Technology Co. and Advanced Micro-Fabrication Equipment Inc. Index stalwarts such as Chinas three biggest telecom firms are already on the list.Xiaomi said in a statement it is not owned or controlled by the Chinese military, adding that it would take appropriate actions to protect its interests.Unless the ban is reversed, the smartphone maker risks being delisted from US exchanges and deleted from global benchmark indexes. China Mobile Ltd, China Telecom Corp and China Unicom Hong Kong Ltd were removed by MSCI Inc. last week.The Trump administrations blacklistings have focused on Chinese companies with military ties and strategic value to the industrys growth. Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp., Chinas largest chipmaker and critical to the countrys ability to build a self-sufficient tech industry, was included in December.Xiaomi was co-founded by billionaire entrepreneur Lei Jun about 10 years ago, with US chipmaker Qualcomm Inc as one of the earliest investors. Its since expanded well beyond Chinas borders, particularly into Europe and India, becoming one of the countrys more recognisable brands. It surpassed Apple in global smartphone sales in the third quarter, according to the International Data Corporation, and joined Hong Kongs benchmark Hang Seng Index in September.The move sent Xiaomi suppliers south on Friday: FIH Mobile Ltd., which helps it assemble smartphones, plunged as much as 14 percent after a strong rally in recent days. Component suppliers including Largan Precision Co., Sunny Optical Technology Group Co. and AAC Technologies Holdings Inc. also fell. Spreads on Xiaomis dollar bonds widened as much as 40 basis points Friday morning, according to credit traders.Xiaomi plunges after the Pentagon added it to a blacklistSeparately, the US Commerce Department blacklisted Chinas No 3 oil company, China National Offshore Oil Corp., and Skyrizon, which develops military equipment. The Commerce designation is more severe and prohibits American firms from supplying those entities.Investors may be concerned that Xiaomi could be targeted by Commerce in the future, after the Defense Dept.s move. Huawei was forced to sell off its Honor smartphone business after it was cut off from American suppliers, including Android-developer Google.Trumps increasingly aggressive stance towards Chinese corporations has provoked Beijing, which views the litany of US actions as a threat. The government this month issued new rules to protect its firms from unjustified foreign laws and previously talked about creating its own Unreliable Entities list, though no concrete retaliation has emerged.Despite Fridays selloff, some investors held out hope that the incoming US administration will reverse actions taken in the twilight days of Donald Trumps presidency.This is not going to be a priority for the Biden administration. This ruling will be reversed before November, so we are going to hold, and not just hold but be a buyer on this weakness, Vanessa Martinez, a partner at Lerner Group, told Bloomberg TV. This is just like that last parting shot against China by the Trump administration.Chen of China Merchants Securities also argued the fallout for Xiaomi may be limited. Many investors would choose to lock in profit since the stock rallied a lot in the past year, he said. But I think the impact on Xiaomi would be more sentimental than fundamental. These declines could be short-lived.",US blacklists Xiaomi in widening assault on China tech companies,RICE

Economists blame a chronic trade imbalance and costly state FX interventions that depleted reserves.Political testA Metropoll survey last month showed 80% believe inflation is higher than the official tally.

Ankara has already cut taxes on tobacco, which weighs heavily in the consumer price index (CPI), even while it raised duties on alcohol and road tolls which have less impact on the headline number.State agencies also set the price of utilities such as natural gas and electricity. Last month the government raised the minimum wage by a net 16% for 2021, to 2,825 lira ($377) a month, in a boost to workers but also to overall CPI.You cannot solve the food problem with interest rates, Gizem Oztok Altinsac, chief economist at Turkeys top business organisation TUSIAD, told a conference last week.Our problem with inflation is too big so we have to take more targeted steps to solve it.",Less for more in Turkey: costly food starves economic rebound,RICE

I have supported him in campaigning. I have supported him in voting, Rice said. It hurts my heart.Among the lesser-known members of South Carolinas delegation, Rice had long been a reliable backer of the president, campaigning with him and, according to FiveThirtyEight, voting 94% of the time in favor of Trump-backed legislation  the highest percentage among South Carolinas current delegation.In his only primary since first being elected in 2012, Rice won with 84% of the vote. He's been reelected each time with at least 56% of votes cast.Some say Rice's decision Wednesday may come back to haunt him against a field of primary challengers in 2022, when he plans to seek a sixth term. Rice represents South Carolinas 7th District, an area including Myrtle Beach that has voted heavily for Trump.Walter Whetsell, Rice's longtime political advisor, said he expected Rice would field primary opposition based off Wednesday's landmark vote, but noted it would be difficult for someone to say they'd be a candidate more closely aligned with Trump's policies than Rice.It is a remarkably high hurdle to make that argument, when you have, in Tom Rice, a guy that supported Donald Trump 94% of the time,"" Whetsell said.Some of that blowback appears to have already begun. In South Carolina's Horry County, GOP Chairwoman Dreama Perdue said her phone had been ringing nearly constantly since Rices vote, with angry constituents venting their frustration over what many have characterized as a betrayal.We were all taken aback by this, Perdue said, adding shes had to set the phone down as some callers ranted so she could do tasks around the house, like taking out her trash. There are some that, as soon as I answer, theyre just yelling and screaming.State GOP Chairman Drew McKissick said he was severely disappointed with Rice. And Matt Moore, McKissick's predecessor, said he initially assumed Rice was planning to retire, given possible electoral ramifications.My first reaction was, gosh, Tom Rice is not running again,"" Moore said, citing Trump's high base of support in Rice's district.On Thursday, however, Rice said he knew he'd likely face a difficult primary and that the impeachment vote could potentially cost him his seat.

Read MoreNEW DELHI: The negotiations between the protesting farmers and the government remained inconclusive after the ninth round of talks held between them in the national capital on Friday. While the farmers were unrelenting in their demand of repealing the three farm laws, the government suggested that they should form an informal group to prepare a concrete proposal over the Acts. The tenth round of talks would be held on January 19.Here are the key developments of the day:1. The government asked the protesting farmers to form an informal group to prepare a concrete proposal about their objections and suggestions on the three farm laws for further discussion at their next meeting on January 19 to end the long-running protest at various Delhi borders, but unions stuck to their main demand of a complete repeal of the three Acts. As nearly five hours of talks between 41 unions and three central ministers did not reach a decisive stage in the ninth round of talks at Vigyan Bhawan, the two sides decided to meet again the next Tuesday. Agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar told farmer leaders at the meeting that the government has been flexible in its approach and urged the same from them.2. Incidentally, the tenth round of talks has been scheduled for a day when a Supreme Court-appointed committee to resolve the impasse is also likely to hold its first meeting. A day before that, the apex court is likely to hear a petition against a tractor rally call given by the protesting farmers for the Republic Day on January 26.3. After the meeting, Tomar told reporters that two separate deliberations can run parallely as the farmer unions want to continue their talks with the government and the court-appointed panel has also been set up with an aim to resolve the crisis and a solution can emerge from anywhere. ""Discussions happen at various platforms and a solution can emerge from anywhere... Our effort is to find a solution at the earliest through dialogue so that the farmers' protest ends. Farmers are sitting in cold weather amid the threat of COVID-19 and the government is concerned about that also and is therefore engaging with farmers with an open mind,"" he said and added that the government will also present its side before the SC-appointed panel whenever it is asked to do so. In his opening remarks, Tomar urged farmer leaders to be flexible in their approach as has been done by the government. Besides Tomar, railways, commerce and food minister Piyush Goyal and minister of state for commerce Som Parkash were part of the government side.4. Urging farmer unions to form an informal group among themselves to prepare concrete proposals to be discussed in the next meeting, Narendra Singh Tomar said detailed discussions took place at the ninth round of talks but could not reach a decisive stage. The two sides, therefore, decided to meet again on January 19 at 12 pm, Tomar told reporters after the end of the meeting that lasted for nearly five hours. ""Talks took place over three farm laws in a cordial atmosphere and detailed discussions took place on some issues, but couldn't reach a decisive stage,"" he said. ""We suggested they can form an informal group of people who can understand the laws better and prepare some concrete proposals, detailing what are farmers' expectations and what clauses are problematic for them, which the government can consider with an open mind,"" the minister said. He further said the government is hopeful of discussions reaching some decisive stage at the tenth round of talks on January 19.5. Farmers union leaders, who had their own langar food during the lunch break, said at the meeting they are committed to continuing holding direct talks to resolve the over-one-month-long deadlock over three agri laws, even as a committee has been formed by the Supreme Court to resolve the deadlock. ""Both the government and farmer unions have reaffirmed their commitment to continue with the direct dialogue process,"" said All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee member Kavita Kuruganti, who was part of the meeting. Farmer leader Darshan Pal said there was a good discussion on all three laws. ""There is a possibility of some resolution. We are positive,"" he added. Another leader Rakesh Tikait said: ""Government has told us that solution should be found through dialogue and not a court. Everyone is of the same view. There is a possibility of some solution.""6. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi alleged that Prime Minister Narendra Modi does not respect farmers and wants to tire out those protesting against the centre's new agri laws. He also said that the talks that are being held with the protesting farmer leaders are part of the government's delaying tactics. Farmers will not relent till the laws are repealed, said Rahul Gandhi at Jantar Mantar, where he along with Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra joined party MPs in their demonstration against the legislation. ""The talks are being held only to delay. PM Modi thinks he has the power and will tire the farmers out, but he is mistaken. Narendra Modi does not have basic respect for farmers. He does not even care if over 100 farmers die. He thinks he has the power and the protesting farmers will tire out after some days, but they will not relent,"" Rahul Gandhi told reporters. ""The farm laws will have to be repealed. They (the government) do not know the strength of farmers, they will not relent. PM Modi does not understand this. Had he understood this, the government would have taken back the laws today itself,"" he said.7. Narendra Singh Tomar hit back at Rahul Gandhi for his remarks against Prime Minister Narendra Modi over the ongoing farmers' protest at Delhi's borders and said even the leaders of his own party do not take the Gandhi scion seriously and laugh at his remarks. Addressing the media after the meeting with the farmers, Tomar said Gandhi's statements and actions are laughed at even within his own party. ""The Congress manifesto in 2019 itself had promised these reforms and therefore, Sonia and Rahul Gandhi should tell us whether they were lying then or are lying now,"" he said.8. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) believes the farm bills passed by the Indian government have the potential to represent a significant step forward for agricultural reforms, but a social safety net is needed to protect those who might be adversely impacted during the transition to the new system, a spokesperson of the global lender said in Washington. Gerry Rice, director of communications at the IMF, said the new measures will reduce the role of the middlemen and enhance efficiency. ""We believe the farm bills do have the potential to represent a significant step forward for agricultural reforms in India,"" Rice said at a news conference. ""The measures will enable farmers to directly contract with sellers, allow farmers to retain a greater share of the surplus by reducing the role of middlemen, enhance efficiency and support rural growth,"" he said. ""However, it is crucial that the social safety net adequately protects those who might be adversely impacted during the transition to this new system,"" the spokesperson said responding to a question on the ongoing protests by farmers against the laws in India. This can be done by ensuring that the job market accommodates those that are impacted by the reforms, he said. And of course, the growth benefits of these reforms will depend, critically, on the effectiveness and the timing of their implementation, so need to pay attention to those issues as well with the reform,"" Rice said.9. Congress workers held protests in Chandigarh in support of farmers agitating over the new agri-marketing laws, with one group facing a water cannon as it tried to push past police barricades. The Congress had planned to gherao the Punjab and Haryana Raj Bhavans as part of a nationwide protest called by the party over the new farm laws. Haryana Congress leaders were detained by police as they marched towards the state Raj Bhavan. A separate march by the party's Punjab unit was also stopped. Police used a water cannon against workers from the party's Chandigarh unit as they tried to march towards Punjab Bhavan. Several of them were taken into custody. State Congress chief Kumari Selja, Haryana in-charge at AICC Vivek Bansal, former chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda , Randeep Singh Surjewala and Kiran Choudhary were among the Haryana unit party leaders detained by the Chandigarh police. They were taken to different police stations and later released.10. The Himachal Pradesh Congress staged a protest outside the Raj Bhawan in Shimla in support of farmers agitating against the centre's new agri laws. The state unit of the Congress observed the day as Kisan Adhikar Divas on the directions of the All India Congress Committee.

The health infrastructure has been allotted a massive amount of 3,122 crore through KIIFB, he said, also welcoming the continuation of the Karunya scheme.There are many positive steps for helping NRKs, especially those who have returned to the State recently. The assurance of 10% return on investment through the Pravasi Dividend Scheme is highly welcome which will help a large number of NRKs to have an assured income, he said.One of the areas which has not received attention from the Finance Minister is the health tourism sector, which has huge potential for generating jobs and revenues for the State, he added.K. Harikumar, president of the Cochin Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said recommendations by the chamber such as revival of sick MSMEs, promotion of innovation with a larger role for K-DISC, support for status, reduction of VAT on CNG and LNG to 5% and support for the plantation sector found place in the budget proposals.The decision to invest 50,000 crore for three industrial corridors, with Kochi as one of the major hubs for activities, definitely deserves appreciation, he said.The impetus provided to the start-up sector will boost entrepreneurs. The governments dedicated Venture Capital fund to support start-ups in their expansion projects will go a long way in generating more jobs and opportunities. The governments decision to raise the base price of rubber, paddy, and coconut to 170, 28 and 32 respectively indicates its concern for the plantation sector. According to the latest economic review, coconut occupies the largest area with 29.3% coverage followed by rubber with 21.28%. Rice comes third with 7.37% of the total cropped area, he said.He also welcomed the decision to withdraw flood cess and not to impose further taxes.Merchants ignoredHowever, Kerala Merchants Chamber of Commerce rued that traders were ignored in the budget. Besides giving concession in registration fee of land for industrial purposes, there was nothing else for the business community, chamber president G. Karthikeyan and general secretary K.M. Vipin said.They said the announcement of huge allocations for welfare projects and more development projects could only be seen as with an eye on the forthcoming Assembly elections. Even the demand for a 5-lakh health insurance for merchants licensed by local bodies and with an annual turnover of less than 40 lakh was not heeded, they said.FICCIIncreased allocation of funds and thrust on development of digital economy, knowledge society, innovation society, and start-ups are appreciated, said Deepak L. Aswani, co-chair, FICCI Kerala State Council.Allocation of 55,000 crore for three industrial corridors in the State will accelerate infrastructure development. Reduction of State VAT to 5% will be a great boost for LNG-related projects. Reduction of stamp duty and registration to 4% and 1% respectively will be a great boon to real estate and construction industry. Increased allocation of funds for infrastructure and marketing activities of the tourism sector at 117 crore and 100 crore will be a great help for the tourism sector, which has been severely affected by the pandemic and is now slowly on the revival path, he said.",Welfare measures for the poor draw praise,RICE

The new measures will reduce the role of middlemen and increase efficiency, director of communications at the IMF Gerry Rice said.However, it is crucial that the social safety net adequately protects those who might be adversely impacted during the transition to this new system, the IMF spokesperson said, adding this can be done by ensuring that the job market accommodates those that are impacted by the reforms.Upon being asked on how a social security net can be created for the persons who could be adversely affected, Rice said that this could be done by making sure that the job market accommodates such persons.The IMF comments on a day the ninth round of talks between the government and the farmers took place but failed to break the deadlock and days after the Supreme Court stayed the implementation of the three new agricluture laws and formed a four-committee to oversee the negotiations.The farm protests had garnered international attention after Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had expressed concerns over the protests.

2021-01-16,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/xiaomi-collateral-damage/article33589440.ece,"The U.S. has termed the start-up a Communist Chinese military companyOn January 14, the U.S. Department of Defense released its latest list of what it called Communist Chinese military companies operating in the U.S., as part of the National Defense Authorization Act. The aim was to highlight and counter the Peoples Republic of Chinas Military-Civil Fusion development strategy, which supports the modernisation goals of the Peoples Liberation Army by ensuring its access to advanced technologies and expertise acquired and developed by even those PRC companies, universities, and research programs that appear to be civilian entities.Since the first such list was released in June last year, the U.S. has named some of Chinas most well-known state-run firms, such as the Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC) and Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC) that manufacture aircraft, the China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC), the China Nuclear Engineering and Construction Corporation (CNEEC), and the telecommunications giant Huawei.The latest list, however, included a surprising name  Xiaomi, a 10-year-old smartphone and smart appliances manufacturer that has made a name for itself, both in China and abroad, for its cutting edge consumer products. The company immediately issued a statement, saying it is not owned, controlled or affiliated with the Chinese military.The listing of Xiaomi sheds a spotlight on the unique space it occupies in Chinas private sector, as well as the broader challenge that firms in China that have sought to differentiate themselves from state-backed entities increasingly face overseas.Founded in 2010, Xiaomi (pronounced sheow-me) was a start-up that entered an already highly competitive smartphone market. Their initial modus operandi was to sell phones close to manufacturing cost, while making money off accessories and other smart devices from smart bands to air purifiers and smart rice cookers, and avoiding investment into brick and mortar retail stores. They relied on the Internet and in creating a buzz about their young brand. One such method was to create its own MIUI platform, an Android-based operating system that differentiated its products. This model allowed the company to make rapid inroads into its competitors markets both at home and abroad. As of August last year, Huawei still enjoyed a dominating 45% smartphone market share, according to a report from market intelligence firm IDC, greater than its next three rivals, Oppo, Vivo and Xiaomi, whose share is a little over 10%.Overseas successXiaomis great success has been overseas. Last year, the company said it ranks in the top five in 50 global smartphone markets, and with the largest market share in India and Spain, second in France and Russia, fourth in China, Germany, Indonesia and South Korea, and fifth in Brazil, Malaysia and Singapore.For Xiaomi, the listing in the U.S. could hurt its carefully built reputation as an upstart Chinese start-up. If Huawei was the all-powerful telecom firm that was loved by the state as a national champion even if it was a private company, Xiaomi has positioned itself as an outsider rival, a message conveyed even in its name, which means millet. Its founder Lei Jun once said he was inspired by the humble crop and a Chinese saying that the Buddha, even in one grain of rice, could see a mountain.The U.S. listing also highlights the broader global debate about how private Chinese companies can truly be, at a time when the Communist Party has increasingly made it clear entrepreneurs should be patriots first and serve the state, as underlined in recent actions against e-commerce giant Alibaba.On the spectrum of Chinese private firms, Xiaomi has sought to position itself as far as it can from hardware manufacturing telecom firms such as Huawei, cultivating the image of a company that relies more on individual consumers than state contracts. If the U.S. description of Xiaomi as a Communist Chinese military company might appear a stretch, that will matter little for President Donald Trump, as he leaves behind a parting gift for China. The greater concern for Xiaomi is how much it will matter to its customers, from India and Indonesia to Brazil and beyond.",Xiaomi | Collateral damage,RICE

He said that the particular kaje variety of rice was once being cultivated in Karkala and its neighbourhood on a vast scale. As its cultivation came down gradually the cooperative society, which is full of farmers, thought of conserving it from fading from the fields. As some farmers who had its seeds were cultivating its paddy on a small scale the cooperative society gave its seeds to about 100 farmers to promote its cultivation.As a first crop under the cooperative societys initiative between 250 and 300 farmers cultivated it on about 200 hectares (900 acres) last year. We got about 3,000 quintals of rice from about 5,000 quintals of paddy cultivated. The same rice is ready for sale now, he said, adding that preparations have been made to cultivate its second crop whose harvesting is expected in late February or in March.Mr. Jain said that the Kaarla Kaje will be sold in Dakshina Kannada and Udupi districts in 5, 10 and 25 kg bags.The president, who himself cultivates it on about 35 acres to 40 acres, said that the particular variety yielded 15 quintals of paddy per an acre of land. Its rice can be stored up to three to five months. He said that if the paddy after drying is stored up to three months and then made as rice it tasted better.As the society now had only 3,000 quintals of rice with it, it can not be marketed outside the twin districts, which consumed boiled rice, even if demand grew, Mr. Jain, who is also the vice-president of Udupi District Krishika Samaja and president of Udupi District Bharatiya Kisan Sangha, said.The rice will be promoted as the brand of Karkala.

But his biggest contribution to farming is he is the proud owner of 90 varieties of indigenous beans and peas. He cultivates each of the varieties to conserve them. ""Earlier farmers were conservators too. But now they depend on the market every sowing season. I thought we should not lose out on the indigenous varieties in the mad rush for hybrid ones,"" he says. ""For there will be new varieties only if the old survives.""Recognising his effort, the Kerala Agricultural University has nominated him for the Plant Genome Saviour Farmer Reward instituted by the Ministry of Agriculture's Protection of Plant Varieties and Farmers' Rights Authority.Narayanan is not just a farmer. He is an accredited journalist with an evening daily in Kasaragod, a theatre artiste, helps publish work of rural talent, and a sought-after social worker.

After a cup of tea, he changes to lungi and wears his headlamp, and hits the field again with his mother. ""I water plants every day and it can go on till 10 pm. That is why I farm round the year,"" he says.In 2018, he lost 13 varieties of rice in the flood. ""All of them were indigenous varieties from Wayanad,"" he says. He started conserving beans on a largescale in 2016 when the United Nations General Assembly declared it as the International Year of Pulses. Pulses are beans and peas that are harvested dry. ""When I read it in newspapers, I thought of finding out how many varieties of beans are there in Kerala and why not conserve them,"" he says.He had 10 varieties of beans with him in 2016, and he started getting new varieties from his farmer-friends and agriculture scientists from faraway places such as Rajasthan and Assam. ""Unlike conserving mangoes and jackfruit varieties which can be planted and forgotten, I have to grow beans every year to conserve them,"" he says. He grows around 20 to 30 varieties at a time and labels them properly. ""Growing all of them together will be hard to maintain and increases the risk of cross-pollination,"" he says.Narayanan sells his vegetables but not seeds. ""I will have seeds of any of the vegetables I grow to give away free of cost to at least 25 farmers.

This is something we are working on. For TMC, the definition of a Bengali is someone who lives in the state, understands it, knows its culture, and contributes to it. It doesnt matter where they come from. They are all welcome in Bengal and you will see this in the campaign. Those who attack Bengali culture and have no understanding of it, they are the outsider, a senior leader drafting the partys strategy said.On December 2, Ghosh said those who have come from other states have played a crucial role in Bengals development. He accused TMC of resorting to divisive politics and tagging those who worked for the welfare of the state outsiders.According to party leaders, non-Bengali votebank in the state is around 15 per cent of the electorate and it is influential in and around Kolkata, where it accounts for about half of the population. Kolkata attracts lots of workers from nearby states and they make up a big number. Then there is the Marwadi community that is very influential and prosperous, a senior leader said.Explained Fine-tuning strategy A key plank of TMC has been to attack BJP as a party of outsiders, accusing the party of having few local faces. This has been furthered by allegations against economist and Nobel laureate Amartya Sen, including remarks by BJP state president Dilip Ghosh. The TMC used this as an example of the BJP attacking an icon of Bengal.Mohammad Salim, politburo member of the CPM, which is fighting the election in alliance with the Congress, said the politics of both the TMC and BJP is based on exclusion. If you look at the years before this one, TMC was nearly always aligned with the BJP. They have no ideological opposition. This insider-outsider politics is only an extension of these ideas that divide, Salim said.The CPM leader said, In the rest of India, in the BJPs worldview, particularly of Hindi, Hindu, Hindustan, Bengalis have faced being the outsider, being called puffed rice eaters etc. This is what TMC is doing in Bengal, and Bengal has always fought against these divisions.In the eighties, the Amra Bangali movement that espoused Bengali ways and language had attempted to turn such a narrative political. Amra Bangali had emerged as a counter to a movement in Assam to drive away Bengalis called Bongali Kheda. The outfit has now been reduced to a fringe role. Shiv Sena, which also has little presence in Bengal, has said it may tie up with Amra Bangali.Sukhendu Sekhar Ray, Chief Whip of TMC in Rajya Sabha, said it is a wrong perception that the party is calling the BJP outsiders. We call them outsider bargis. This word is important. In 2011, CPM were called Harmads for their reign of terror. We call BJP bargis because during the Maratha invasion, Bargis destroyed crops and plundered. If you look at BJPs language, it is not a language of winning elections. It is one of conquest. They do not say they want to come to Bengal, present their vision for development and win people over. They use words of bahubalis They want to create a situation of violence, Ray said.Ray said TMC was proud of its non Bengali residents and that Bengal has always been mini India. Bengalis and non Bengalis have always stood side by side, as brothers and sisters.A key member of TMCs communication wing said the party was keen to focus on the term tourist gang in its outreach. Both words are important. Tourist or outsider by itself isnt bad. But the gang is important as people who dont respect Bengal. For instance, the strategy is to juxtapose two images. One of Amit Shah eating at a village home and Mamata Banerjee standing in queue for her Swasthya Sathi health card. These two images show who is an outsider just here for photo opportunities, while the other is invested in the state, a senior leader said.",TMC wary of BJP using its ‘outsider’ plank to woo non-Bengali voters,RICE

Tribal communities, who are allowed to collect the minor forest produce, have been harvesting the seeds, known as bamboo rice, for consumption as it is known to be a rich source of protein.Bellessi, a 60-year-old Paniya tribal woman from the village of Erivayal in Thorapalli, said she had last collected and cooked the bamboo rice as a child. We prepare it just like rice, she said.The tribal people, who use the bamboo seeds that come under the minor forest produce category, said there was also a belief among them that the gregarious flowering of the bamboo was a portent of an adverse ecological event.Godwin Vasanth Bosco, a restoration ecologist from the Nilgiris, said the gregarious flowering of Dendrocalamus strictus was sometimes thought to be a stress response. As a result, local communities believe that it could be a forewarning of a drought, while the blooming also could lead to an increase in the rat population, which in the past led to crop damage and the spread of disease, said Mr. Bosco.M. Francis, an agronomist from Karnataka, said it was unlikely that the flowering was linked to any factors such as climate change or as a stress response to a future drought event. Bamboo is a monocarpic species, which flower, seed and then die. This is its natural life cycle, said Mr. Francis, who called on the forest department to also limit the amount of seed collection by the local communities.The department should limit the collection to around 10-15 %, and then propagate the seeds to allow for the bamboo to grow again as they are an important source of food for wildlife, he said.The bamboo is also one of the prime food sources for elephants and other herbivores, and there is a fear that the resulting death of the bamboo could lead to a reduction in food availability in the region for wildlife, possibly exacerbating human-animal confrontations.It is important that the bamboo is allowed to re-establish itself as an invasive species of flora, Senna spectabilis, is spreading in the habitat which is occupied currently by the bamboo. If the seeds are not allowed to propagate and grow, their habitats might be taken over by the invasive species, said Mr. Bosco.The forest department should also facilitate the setting up of nurseries, where the seeds of these bamboos can be collected and grown before they can be replanted in the forests, he added.",Tribal communities harvest ‘bamboo rice’ in Mudumalai,RICE

We have books on history, religion and literature in Hindi, Punjabi and English. Between 20 and 25 books are issued every day.

This protest is not just to determine the fate of a few harvests but of the ownership of the seed out of which food grows, he said.Before 1947, we had one lakh varieties of rice in this country but now there are just 5,000. Soon, even the seed that a farmer sows will have to be the variety which is sold by corporates.

The trigger for the floods is believed to be either a glacial lake being breached or a broken mountain peak falling on a glacier. Scientists from the Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology (WIHG), Dehradun were among the first teams of experts to leave for an examination of the causes of the disaster. Kalachand Sain, Director, WIHG, says in an interview to The Hindus Jacob Koshy, that it was large rock falling on a hanging glacier that precipitated the avalanche and flood. He also highlighted the challenges of accessing the glacier because of which it could be months before the exact cause that triggered the rockfall could be determined.The Wadia Institute has sent a team of scientists to explore the causes of the flash flood. What have they found so far?A team of five immediately left for the spot. They have made some measurements of the topography near the locations but access is difficult. They also undertook an aerial survey. What we know so far is almost entirely based on an analysis of satellite imagery, with some ground observations. Ground-based measurements are critical to supplement this but the prevailing conditions arent conducive. These are glaciers at an elevation of 5,000-6,000 metres. Himachal Pradesh has 10,000 glaciers, Uttarakhand has 1,000 glaciers  and all are in extremely inhospitable locations. Normally, access to these regions is only possible in the summer, and its not easy even then. Thats why our knowledge of glaciers is limited and this is inadequate. That makes satellite analysis or aerial surveys critical but they have their limitations.What does your preliminary analysis suggest?We are about 90% certain that this was caused by a combination of a large piece of rock, possibly from a mountain peak, breaking off. This was probably part of the Raunthi/Mrigudhani mountain. It fell on a hanging glacier, probably perched off a cliff. The impact from the falling rock broke it [the glacier] and this mass of rock and ice debris avalanched over a nearly 40 degree slope for two kilometres before falling onto the Raunthi Gadhera stream floor. There was thus a huge mass of rock, ice and other debris that stayed that way for a while. It looks like it stayed that way for three days and the ice and snow started to melt from the heat. It was a clear sky. Eventually, the pressure created by the volume of water and other debris forced its way down the valley and led to the flooding and deluge. This was different from a situation like Kedarnath in 2013. There, multiple cloudbursts in June led to a torrent of snow and water that resulted in a flash flood. (This resulted in widespread destruction in Uttarakhand and the loss of nearly 5,700 lives, along with damaged hydropower tunnels as well as destruction of livestock and property.)What made the mountain peak break?This is still to be determined. What is likely is that this is a result of decades of freezing and thawing that would have led to weaknesses and cracks forking in those mountain structures. It was not a sudden event, and this underlines the reasons of why we need to keep monitoring the Himalayas. They are fragile and host to several complex processes that need to be monitored. Global warming contributes to the weakening of the glaciers and we need several organisations and specialists working on these aspects to monitor, make models and thereby make predictive forecasts that can warn of such occurrences in the future.We need some ground-based measurements and we have already made a scientific plan to be able to access these mountains in the summer. We will have to investigate if there was some tectonic activity, or a blast from somewhere higher up that triggered fault-lines. We dont know yet and it will take some time to establish that. But imagine a heap of rice. If the base is not strong and grains accumulate, there will at some point be a single rice grain, that when added to the heap, will cause it to crumble. So we have to determine structural weaknesses too.Do such accidents show that its foolhardy to construct hydropower projects in Uttarakhand beyond a certain elevation?Ideally, before projects are conceived, there are expert assessments done and these are expected to be followed.",‘Himalayas are fragile and host to several complex processes that need to be monitored’,RICE
2021-02-11,https://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/chennai/2021/feb/11/pressure-that-pleases-the-palate-2262302.html,"Anushree Madhavan ByExpress News ServiceCHENNAI: Imagine this. You are in a foreign land, in a small apartment with not many vessels to cook in, and you are craving for a bowl of piping hot sambar saadam. What do you do? If you are someone like B Ramakrishnan, or Ramki as he is fondly called, you would resort to the One Pot One Shot (OPOS) cooking method.After all, it was this craving for sambar while in Bahrain that led the masterchef of the OPOS methd on this journey, nearly 15 years ago. Since the success of his first book  OPOS Cookbook: 5 Minute Magic  in 2018, Ramki has upgraded his recipes for his recent launch The Complete OPOS Cookbook. Here, he introduces the concept of pressure baking, cold pressure deep fry and other new techniques.Journey in the kitchenFor Ramakrishnan, cooking is a science and every recipe is a problem to be solved. My journey into cooking is similar to what each one of us has gone through. Cooking is like drawing a freehand circle that is taught by your mom. How much ever you practise, you will not be able to draw as precisely as your mom can. And it takes a lot of experience and skill to draw a freehand circle. Traditional cooking is like that because there are a lot of variables involved.Even if you follow every single step precisely, the results will be different for your mom and you. There are things that you have to learn by experience  when to add what ingredients, when it is cooked, etc. And this is why cookbooks do not do a good job of teaching cooking. This is why many of us who learn cooking from a cookbook give up on this art out of frustration. The result we get is nowhere near what is shown in the book, he details. Ramki also had his tryst with cookbooks while in the Middle East.And he was on the brink of giving up on cooking when he realised that the problem was not with him but with the cookbooks. I am an engineer. If I have to design a car or a gear box, the solution is straightforward  take a manual and follow the instructions. They are precise, and no subjectivity involved. When I was trying to learn cooking from a cookbook, I found the instructions were contradictory, confusing, and very subjective.Two books teach different ways to make sambar and each book claims theirs is the proper method. When I realised the problem is with the instructions in the cookbook, I was trying to figure out how cooking can be made into a science, and recipes into scientific experiment where there is no subjectivity. You dont look for kai manam or kai pakkuvam in a scientific experiment, do you? So, I wanted to convert an art into science, he elaborates.I ntroducing OPOSFor everyone to get the same results while making a recipe, Ramki realised that the equipment had to be the same  like with your Chemistry experiments. Rice is the perfect example. The steps to cook rice in Chennai or Himalayas is the same. It is not subjective. Even a child can follow that. My idea was to make all recipes similar to cooking rice.But for cooking, the equipment, heat source, cooking conditions, and even geography matters. So I had to standardise the equipment, he explains. And soon he and his team of OPOS chefs from all over the world, who discuss recipes virtually, decided on working with a two-litre pressure cooker to get to solve the problem in hand. This formidable team has proven that all kinds of Indian dishes  from Mysore pak to malai kofta can be cooked using the OPOS method.Bettering the processWhile choosing a pressure cooker leveled the playing field, there were some glitches reported by most chefs. We found that a lot of vegetables turned mushy and colourless when cooked in a pressure cooker using OPOS method. It lost all its taste and texture. And people were willing to use a cooker to cook dal, pongal or potato where the texture and consistency is not important, but refused to use it for vegetables, he shares. In their learning process, they discovered that to retain the colour, taste and texture of the vegetables, they need to cook it like a stir-fry that a Chinese master would make.We realised the key to doing that is to cut out all water and cook them on very high heat. This was the mantra that took us around 15 years to discover  high heat, low time, no water. You have to cook all the vegetables on very high heat for a very short time, in their own juices. When cooked so, the results were mindblowing, he narrates. Hence, they began the deskilling process and came up with the pressure baker, which is a pressure cooker that is redesigned to work on very high heat, without water. We designed this pressure baker and got Butterfly and Prestige to manufacture it according to our design specifications.If you try using a normal pressure cooker to cook vegetables without water, a lot of mishaps can happen. We gave a presentation to companies and explained to them the difference between pressure cooking and what we are trying to do. It is not easy convincing companies that have been manufacturing pressure cooker for 50 years to ask them to change their design. Fortunately, we were able to convince them. With the equipment and these recipes, instead of drawing a freehand circle, we have given everyone a compass. Now, a perfect circle is even possible for a child. That is what OPOS has done to all recipes, he says proudly. The pressure baker can handle any kind of recipe as this is just a cooking technique.The taste testWhen you cook anything beyond five minutes, everything is lost, he says. In every single traditional recipe, vegetables get completely massacred. Even in restaurants, what you eat is dead carcasses of vegetables. And the only way to eat that is by covering it with loads of masala, he explains. With the OPOS technique, you completely do away with the unwanted masalas. While the pressure baker is ideal to master the art of cooking using the OPOS technique, Ramki does have a solution to those who dont own one. For OPOS, standardisation is important.So, to cook the basic recipes that we have given in the book, use a two or three-litre pressure cooker because all the vegetables need to cook within five minutes. For a small family, a two-litre cooker is enough; for a slightly larger family, use a three-litre one. But, if you are cooking for more people, do not use a bigger cooker, instead cook twice or use two pots, he advises. In the two years since the last book was released, Ramki has been able to master the technique of caramelisation and invent a method called cold pressure frying, where you can deep fry without using a drop of oil.Deep frying or shallow frying is extremely injurious to health. Once the oil starts boiling it produces a lot of toxic chemicals. Even a simple thalipu you do at home creates a lot of smoke. This technique, done inside OPOS pressure cooker, eliminates oil smoke and oil breakdown. We didnt know this in 2018. The techniques keep evolving. Three years down the line we, will need a completely different set of recipes, he shares.Cooking talesRamkis house in Chennai does not have a kitchen. All he needs is a tabletop, a heat source and his pressure baker, and he is good to go. I cook in my balcony, my living room or even out of the boot of my car! There is no smoke or pollution; I take the kitchen wherever I want, he says. He has even taken it to high altitudes to cook for the Indian army in Akhnoor, on the India-Pakistan border in Jammu and Kashmir. It was mind-numbingly cold. The squadron of soldiers was surprised to see me with a backpack and one cooker. When I said I am going to cook a feast for them they didnt believe it. We managed to feed 40 soldiers in one hour.They were shocked as they often live on frozen food. We showed them how easy it is to cook fresh food and they just loved it. One of my most prized possessions is a citation from the army and a medal. It was a heart-touching experience, he reminisces. Now that he and his team have demystified and deskilled every single Indian cuisine, standardised the themes and recipes, the OPOS chefs are on a journey to take on global cuisines.We are working on a Singapore cookbook, Southeast Asian cookbook, Continental, Mediterranean, etc. People staying in those places are working on these recipes and coming up with a book. We also want to set up a chain of restaurants based on this concept  chef-less kitchen-less restaurants, he signs off.Now wouldnt that be something to watch out for?

The government has started the process to hire multiple flour mills for grinding wheat as it plans to deliver flour instead of grain. Mills will also be roped in to refine rice and weed out impurities.Under Mukhya Mantri Ghar-Ghar Ration Yojna , which also seeks to deliver ration items in packets to ensure right quality and quantity, will be implemented simultaneously across the capital.Delhi State Civil Supplies Corporation Limited floated a tender in January for the empanelment of flour mills for transportation and grinding grain, which will be sourced from Food Corporation of India ( FCI ) godowns in Delhi. The mills will also package the flour in different sizes and send these to a delivery agency. The government has also floated tender for selecting the delivery agency.Once the scheme is launched, the beneficiaries will not have to visit the fair price shops. Supply of flour instead of grain will also save their time and money, said an official. In the existing system, most food articles are distributed loose, but the new scheme will deliver them in packets with manufacturing and expiry dates, he added.The entire process will be monitored through CCTV cameras, GPS, PoS devices with biometric authentication. The information will be made available on real-time basis to the authorities, which will help in prevention of waste and corruption, said an official. The CCTV cameras will function 24 hours and the footage will be stored for two months.Under the public distribution scheme, the food and supplies department distributes 3.6 lakh quintals of subsidised wheat and rice and other essential commodities like sugar and salt every month through fair price shops. Delhi has over 17.5 lakh ration card holders with nearly 72 lakh beneficiaries.The new scheme will be executed in two steps. First, foodgrains will be sourced from the FCI godowns and sent to the mills for processing and packaging. In the second step, these will be sent to the delivery agency, which will plan distribution schedules and doorstep deliveries after successful biometric authentication.The delivery agency will receive the food packets by the 13th of every month for the next months distribution and set up large facilities at district levels to store them.

Two-and-a-half-months on, the farmers still want a complete repeal of the laws while the government continues to stand in stout defence of its agri reforms.But what is the story all about? Who are its main protagonists? And how did so many people  including international celebrities like Rihanna  get involved in a row between the government and farmers. Here's a look:The entire logjam between the government and farmers rests on the following three legislations:* Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act 2020* Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance* Farm Services Act, 2020 and The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020The government introduced the laws to deregulate the agriculture markets, allow farmers to directly sell their produce to private players (even enter into contracts with them) and remove stock limits on certain crops unless under extraordinary circumstances.But the farmers see them in a different light.They fear that the laws could end up dismantling the Agriculture Produce Marketing Committees (APMC)  or the mandis  and create a scenario where the Minimum Support Price(MSP)-based procurement will cease to continue.Consequently, they believe that large corporates will mop up their produce at cheaper rates as small & marginal farmers, with limited means, will be unable to strike the right price for their crops.Here's a chart to understand this better:The farmers have categorically said that they will not settle for anything less than a complete rollback of the laws.Even the government's offer of pausing the implementation of the laws for 12-18 months did not cut ice with them as most of the farm unions remained firm on their original demand.In addition to this, the farmers now want a legal guarantee to ensure the continuation of the MSP system.The government has taken an equally firm stand on the new laws, saying that repeal is not possible.Agriculture minister Narendra Tomar and Prime Minister Narendra Modi have asserted that there is not a single flaw in the laws pointed out by either the protesting unions or the opposition parties backing them.The government did, however, try to make several concessions to end the impasse.During its negotiations with farmers, the government offered to provide a written assurance on MSP, said it's willing to stay the implementation of laws for 12-18 months to iron out differences and expressed willingness to discuss the laws in detail (""clause-by-clause"") to address each and every concern of the unions.The issue of MSP-based procurement lies at the heart of the farmers agitation.The government has said the laws have nothing to do with the MSP system. This is a fair argument since state procurement was always an administrative decision and never written in the laws.The ministers maintain that the new laws will not affect the old regime and MSP-based procurement will continue like it always did.""MSP tha, hai aur rahega,"" PM Modi said in Parliament recently in an attempt to assuage the concerns of the protesting unions.But the farmers remained unconvinced.""The country doesn't run on trust but on laws and Constitution,"" farmer leader Rakesh Tikait quipped in response to Modi's ""assurance"".Since the laws don't mention MSP at all, the farmers believe the system will be abolished once private players flood the markets and the mandis become obsolete.MSP acts as a safety cushion for farmers growing specific types of crops  23 to be exact.It's the minimum price at which the government procures these crops from the farmers. This price is announced by the state-run Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) on an annual basis.The Food Corporation of India (FCI)  the main state-run grain procurement agency  largely buys only paddy and wheat at MSP and sells them at highly subsidised prices to the poor.Since Punjab and Haryana farmers primarily grow wheat and paddy, they depend heavily on the MSP system.And there's the data to back all this.In 2018-19, only 12% or 97 lakh of Indias over 8 crore paddy farmers benefitted from procurement operations.However, a closer look reveals that the numbers are skewed heavily in favour of Punjab and Haryana - which are seen as the country's granaries.More than 95% of paddy farmers in Punjab and about 70% of farmers in Haryana were covered under procurement operations. On the other hand, the figures are abysmally low for states like Uttar Pradesh (3.6%), West Bengal (7.3%) and Bihar (1.7%).In her Budget speech earlier this month, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said the government's payment on wheat procurement increased to Rs 62,802 crore in 2019-20, a significant rise from Rs 33,874 crore in 2013-14. She added that nearly 43.36 lakh wheat growers have benefitted from the MSP procurement in 2020-21.Similarly, the MSP payment on rice procurement increased to Rs 1,41,930 crore in 2019-20 and an estimated Rs 1,72,752 crore in 2020-21 from Rs 63,928 crore in 2013-14.Thus, the mere possibility of the MSP system going away has rung alarm bells in the two north Indian states.As the talks between the farmers and government failed to yield any result, the Supreme Court intervened and stayed the implementation of the laws for two months.It ruled that MSP-based procurement should continue until further orders and farmers; landholdings should be protected.While we may not stifle a peaceful protest, we think that this extraordinary order of stay of implementation of the farm laws will be perceived as an achievement of the purpose of such protest at least for the present ... the bench said in its order.Holding that judges are not experts on agriculture or economics, the CJI-led bench also ordered the formation of a four-member expert committee to hold consultations with various stakeholders and submit a report during the period.One member of the committee  BKU president Bhupinder Singh Mann  later recused himself from the panel.The farmers didn't welcome the top court's decision to form a committee, claiming that all its members have backed the government's agriculture reforms.The Supreme Court said that the panel would proceed with or without the farmers' participation and strongly deprecated attempts to besmirch the reputation of members by branding them as biased.So far, the panel has held seven meetings with various stakeholders, which included talks with some representatives of the farmer unions. However, there is still no breakthrough in sight.Even as the farmers continued their protracted siege at Delhi borders, causing inconvenience to commuters, both the government and the Supreme Court lauded the peaceful nature of the agitation.But this changed on January 26.The symbolic tractor parade by farmers on Republic Day descended into chaos and anarchy as the protesters breached barricades ahead of time, clashed with police personnel at various places in Delhi and stormed into the iconic Red Fort.The waving of the religious flag from the ramparts of Red Fort evoked national condemnation and came as a body blow to the hitherto nonviolent agitation.The unions immediately distanced themselves from the violence and alleged widespread conspiracy to sabotage the movement. Nonetheless, the movement did suffer as a fallout of the violence, with some unions withdrawing from the agitation.And just when things appeared to be fizzling out, BKU spokesperson Rakesh Tikait made a tearful appeal to stir the sentiments of the dejected protesters.In pictures: Key protagonists of farmers agitation""I will commit suicide but won't end protest until the farm bills are repealed""  with a single statement, Tikait turned the tide in favour of the farmers and became the new face of the agitation.Thousands of protesters joined in overnight, coalescing at the Ghazipur border to rally behind the agitators. The mass support even forced the UP government, which had ordered the farmers to vacate all the protest sites, to soften its stand.But with memories of Republic Day violence still afresh, the government and security forces too responded in equal measure.Concrete barricades, nails, trenches, cemented walls, additional forces ... the Delhi Police fortified the Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur protest sites to prevent the protesting farmers from forcing their way into the national capital.In pictures: 5-layer security in Delhi after R-Day violenceInternet was banned at the protest sites as well as adjoining areas and border movement completely halted.The action by the government and security agencies expectedly drew criticism from farmers, who alleged a conspiracy to scuttle their agitation.But the unexpected bit was the reaction from an unlikely source  international pop icon Rihanna.The singer tweeted a CNN report about the internet shutdown at Delhi borders with the caption ""Why aren't we talking about this?"".Her tweet triggered a chain reaction on social media.Shortly thereafter, US vice-president Kamala Harris's niece Meena Harris, who's a lawyer, climate activist Greta Thunberg, US House foreign affairs committee member Jim Costa, YouTuber Lilly Singh, poet Rupi Kaur, rapper Russ, former adult film star Mia Khalifa, UK MP Claudia Webbe and a host of others came out in support of the agitation.This prompted the ministry of external affairs to take the unusual step of reacting to tweets by private foreign individuals with a detailed official statement.Not much later, senior government ministers and Indian celebrities too joined in on the chorus.Actors Akshay Kumar and Ajay Devgn, producer-directors Karan Johar and Ekta Kapoor, singer Lata Mangeshkar and cricketers Sachin Tendulkar and Virat Kohli supported the MEA's stand on Twitter with government-approved hashtags IndiaTogether and IndiaAgainstPropaganda.Several ministers of the Modi government, including home minister Amit Shah and finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, also joined the counter-attack.The sudden internationalisation and counter-attack added another layer of controversy to the movement. The Maharashtra government has now decided to probe allegations that celebrities were ""pressurised"" by the government to tweet in their support.The farmers and the government have both expressed willingness to initiate dialogue.After Prime Minister Narendra Modi's recent appeal in Parliament, some farmer leaders said they are ready for further talks and even asked the government to fix a date.Separately, the farmers have announced a nationwide rail roko protest on February 18 to step up pressure on the government.More such protests are likely to follow if the deadlock continues.Tikait had earlier said the farmers have given the government time till October 2 to repeal the laws and will decide the next course of action after that. Meanwhile, the government continues to support the laws in ongoing Parliament session with PM Modi himself leading the defence.And the saga continues ...","Controversy, violence, international support: The farm stir saga so far",RICE

In 2010, they had purchased three tainted properties in Mumbai originally owned by the Mirchi clan.While several properties have already been attached by the ED, sources said the agency has collected evidence of Mirchis multiple foreign passports, his banking channels and contacts in Pakistan.The ED, sources said, has tracked down residences, hotels and offshore companies purchased from proceeds of smuggling. Some offshore entities listed by the ED, like Country Properties Limited, were incorporated by Mossack Fonseca and were flagged by The Indian Express as part of its investigation into The Panama Papers.Among Mirchi relatives questioned by the ED last year is Abdul Kadar Merchant, Iqbal Mirchis older brother who has confessed that Mirchi began his illegal activities way back in 1970 by stealing goods from the Mumbai Dockyard and selling them in local markets.He is said to have told investigators that Mirchi moved to Dubai to begin his drug cartel in 1993 and with handlers like distant relative, Pakistan-based Mahmood Ismail, used to procure consignments from that country or Afghanistan.According to a witness statement of Nadeem Abdul Kader, the nephew of Iqbal Mirchi (a British citizen), he had been asked by his uncle to work in the hotel he bought in Dubai in 1990 called Imperial Suites. The ED has recorded how, according to Nadeem Kader, the hotel was known as Dawood Hotel and that he had seen Dawood visit the place on several occasions to meet Iqbal Mirchi.Another incident recalled by Iqbal Mirchis nephew is about how during a visit to Mirchis godowns in Mumbai, one of the bales split open and he was shocked to find large bundles of US dollars concealed inside.Jordanian national Mohammed Saleh Mahmood Saleh is said to have talked about how drugs were sold in foreign currency concealed in containers of used clothes. And liquor to Kuwait and Saudi Arabia concealed in oil tankers.Once, while welding, a blast occurred and the consignment was caught at the Kuwait port. The Jordanian witness has admitted to meeting Dawood Ibrahim at the Dubai residence of Mirchi as has another witness, the then General Manager of Imperial Suites Hotel.The global reach of Iqbal Mirchis smuggling network has also been revealed by another witness, Nasreen Farid Edroos, former wife of an associate of Iqbal Mirchi named Humayun Merchant.They were both intercepted and detained in Hong Kong once with a consignment of opium, which, she was told, belonged to Iqbal Mirchi. She told the ED that Iqbal Mirchi used to run a mill in London, Eden Fine Rice, where her husband worked as a supervisor.Once on a tour of the mill, a container of rice fell down and packets of white powder spilled with the rice. She was told the powder was cocaine and belonged to Mirchi.The EDs case is that Iqbal Mirchis money laundering operations commenced in 1986 and that, till date, proceeds of crime to the tune of Rs 216 crore have been identified.This, in turn, was used by him and his family, including his wife, Hajra Iqbal Memon, and his sons, Asif Iqbal Memon and Junaid Iqbal Memon, to acquire properties valued at Rs 573 crore, some of which have already been attached.A list of properties valued at Rs 225 crore has been provisionally attached in 2020. The supplementary chargesheet, sources said, has alleged that the three Mumbai properties purchased by Dheeraj Wadhawan for Rs 225 crore are also part of the proceeds of crime and that a sizeable part of the payments (Rs 154 crore) were sent to foreign entities controlled by Iqbal Mirchi via nonbanking channels.The lawyer for Asif Memon  Iqbal Mirchis son  did not respond to questions sent by The Indian Express.",From Dawood Hotel to cocaine stash: ED maps Iqbal Mirchi’s global network,RICE

John Sherry, assistant director, Farm Information Bureau, Ernakulam, came up with a novel idea of soilless farming. He said rice husk and rice husk ash can be used as substitute for red soil. Sherry, who took up soilless farming during the initial days of the lockdown on an experimental basis, has cultivated several vegetables  snake guard, tomatoes, chilly, capsicum and ridge gourd  in 27 growbags on his rooftop near Thoppumpady.Growbags potting mixture is prepared and filled with red topsoil, sand and organic fertilisers. But often crops fail to give enough yield because of poor soil. As a remedy, I tried rice husk as an alternative. Compared to the traditional method of farming, the potting mixture prepared with husk and organic manure provides good yield in growbags, said Sherry. According to the agriculture officer, complaints from rooftop farmers forced him to find a solution.The quality of seed and the soil medium is the determining factor of yield. If the farmer uses low-quality soil, the yield will be poor and chances of crop damage are high. But rice husks chemical composition consists mainly of silica, ash, carbon calcium and magnesium.It gives good strength to the plant. Growbag gets better root growth and better yield as it gets more ventilation. Pest infestation can be reduced to a great extent. Moreover, vegetables have longer shelf life, said Sherry, who has over eight years experience in growbag farming.

The food joint was formerly a home nestled in greenery, with a library housing several books and a garden courtyard where late writer Girish Karnad spent several years. Now, the restaurant brings alive Siem Reap with its Asian-styled sculptures, a waterfall and koi pond. The erstwhile home of Karnad has now been turned into the Cambodian restaurant Khmer Kitchen, which offers South-East Asian dishes.Karnads son, Raghu Karnad, tells CE that he did a walk-through of the space a couple of days before its intended launch in December. Its a trip. I loved that they havent cut down any trees, and the structure of the house is unchanged, so its an uncanny transformation from the dusty, bookish home I grew up in to a low-lit trendy Angkor Wat, says Raghu.He recalls how his mother, Dr Saraswathi Ganapathy, practically built that house herself, and their family lived there for about 25 years starting from 1994, before moving to central Bengaluru. When we moved out, we spent a lot of time weighing different, solemn options for the house. I love how un-pompous the final outcome has been. And unexpected, he adds.It was sometime in 2018 that Naveen Reddys (managing partner of the restaurant) wife Veena (partner of the restaurant) wanted to start an Asian-style cafe. It so happened that Reddy was in Cambodia at that point. I loved the food and ended up going to Cambodia at least eight times to learn the finer-details of Cambodian cooking  making rice noodles or garden cooking. We also collaborated with chefs like Kethana Dunnet, author of Cookin Cambodian, who taught Gordon Ramsay (celebrity British chef) how to make Fish Amok, he says, adding that he also closely worked with chef Nak before opening the place to the public.As an architect, Reddys first instinct was to retain the greenery as is. The structure itself was a challenge to restore. Weve tried to maintain every branch of the trees. It was interesting to use the old form and fuse the old and new together, along with the trees that became a part of the concept itself, says Reddy,who has leased the property from a friend to whom the house was sold to in 2018. We finalised things sometime in 2019 and have been working on it ever since, says Reddy about the 3,000 sq ft space that has now been doubled. Only the sloped Mangalore tile roof of Karnads home was dismantled, he adds.As an ode to Karnad, the library at Khmer Kitchen has been retained in its original location, where children are encouraged to engage themselves reading. The private dining rooms also retain the original terracotta filler slab roof that adorn the ceiling, while overlooking the garden court yard below, he adds.",A homely affair,RICE

As a farmer however, he wasnt too excited by the idea of loading the body for the required Vit D with medicines.A recipient of the Padma Shri award in Feb 2020 for his natural innovations in farming, went on to win the patent for Vitamin D enriched rice and wheat variety from World Intellectual Property Organisation, Geneva (WIPO) on February 11, 2021.Having listened to the doctors, he started to work on a technique that would enrich rice and wheat with Vitamin D naturally. The 70-year-old farmer who resides in Alwal, Secunderabad, says I succeeded after working on it for two years. Then filed for a national patent in August 2019 and a year later, I applied for International patent on August 1, 2020. My concern was simple: why should we take medicines for something that is coming to us naturally, for free? I had already worked on rice with Vitamin A and C; my crops are fed with natural nutrients through drip irrigation. It is a simple technique and absolutely natural. I tweaked the process and the nutrients to enrich rice and wheat with Vit D. Venkat Reddy is jubilant at winning the WIPO patent and hopes farmers worldwide will adopt the method to fight the Vitamin D deficiency. He explains Vitamin D is such an important mineral and though present abundantly we are having to rely on medicines. Normal or conventional rice and wheat have no presence of Vitamin D. Through my farming method I was able to test the presence of vitamin D ranging from 102 international units (IU) per 100 gram to 141 IU per 100 grams in rice. Same goes with wheat. My experiments on an agricultural plot in Alwal came up with 1606 IU per 100grams and 1832 IU per 100 grams in wheat.This is not Venkat Reddys only success. Last year, his innovative technique of using the sub soil as a pest repellent had helped fellow farmers avert the attack of locusts in their fields. I have always been in support of natural ways to cultivate, which eventually takes care of soil health, the environment and us. I look at methods that are not expensive for farmers. As a farmer I have a duty towards the soil and our future generations, he says.",Hyderabad-based farmer Chintala Venkat Reddy wins patent for Vit D enriched rice and wheat,RICE

2021-02-13,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/farmers-protest-why-it-may-be-a-pivotal-moment-in-indias-growth-story/articleshow/80898931.cms,"Migrating FarmersGreen RevolutionHundreds of thousands of farmers are swelling protests along arterial roads into the capital and other cities across India. The police and paramilitary forces have deployed up to 50,000 personnel, as well as barricades, barbed wire and riot-control vehicles. The United Nations is urging restraint. And each day, more farmers and tractors arrive to join the disgruntled ranks.Prime Minister Narendra Modi is no stranger to sparking public anger with his determination to push through reforms, but this may be his most vital stand-off yet. The farmers are demanding he repeal laws passed in September that they say will ruin their livelihoods. The government insists the new policy will benefit the growers and refuses to withdraw the legislation. After months of protests, more than 10 rounds of talks and a Supreme Court order to temporarily suspend the laws, the government says it would consider some amendments and could delay implementation by as much as 18 months. But the agitators are in no mood for compromise.Were not going anywhere. We are ready to sit here for years if needed. The government has to listen, said Balwinder Singh, 50, who normally grows rice and wheat on 3 acres of land in Punjab. He has been protesting since Nov. 26 on the Singhu border, the epicentre of the demonstrations outside Delhi. We can survive the coronavirus but not these laws.Behind the protesters fears and the government rhetoric is a reality that the country somehow needs to reshape its agricultural system or face the environmental consequences of overproduction and a fiscal calamity from ballooning farm subsidies. Get the reform right and it could raise millions of agriculture-dependent families out of poverty and propel India to the forefront of global food exports. Get it wrong and it could force tens of millions of people off their land and degrade up to 90% of the nations water supply.Its a problem so titanic that consecutive governments have shied away from making meaningful changes. Not Modi. Emboldened by seemingly unsinkable popular support, even during a devastating pandemic, his administration has weighed in. Its a classic playbook for the prime minister, whose six years in power have been marked by policy reforms that often set off national protests and occasionally thrown the country into turmoil, such as canceling 86% of circulating currency and introducing a religion-based citizenship law. But the governments willingness to compromise on the farm issue shows that this is potentially an even more delicate path one that risks alienating more than half of the nations 1.3 billion people, who rely on agriculture for a living.The two sides are poles apart. The government says the laws will overhaul the way farm goods are produced and sold in the country, opening up a decades-old system of state-run wholesale markets to more private purchases and helping producers earn more. The farmers fear the laws would give companies and large wholesalers the power to dictate prices to small land-holders, who make up the majority of producers.Its about unlocking productivity in areas like farming of cereals by applying high-quality farm inputs such as seeds, and using less water to grow the same amount of grain, said Rahul Bajoria, Mumbai-based chief India economist at Barclays Plc. The best way for the farm sector to grow is to focus more on exports, for which the country needs to improve productivity and quality control.But the nations millions of small farmers live a precarious existence and have come to trust a government support system that allows them to survive year to year with enough to get to the next harvest.Private companies won't pay us on time, said Singh, the protester. If we don't get paid on time, how will we prepare for our next crop? We will die of hunger.""The root of the conflict lies in a system that evolved over more than half a century after the Green Revolution of the 1960s slowly transformed the nation from a land of frequent famines to an agricultural powerhouse. India is now the worlds biggest exporter of rice and the second-largest producer of wheat and sugar. At the same time, a complex and inefficient system of state support, controlled markets and government welfare grew up that Modi is trying to unpick.Under the present system, the government sets minimum prices for about two dozen crops and buys large volumes of rice and wheat for its welfare programs. While traders arent legally obliged to pay the government-set rates, the sheer volume of state purchases creates de facto price support for key grains from small farmers, who sell their produce through licensed traders in designated markets. These markets were set up to open up the industry and prevent exploitation of smallholders, but over time many became effective monopolies, with traders pulling together to stifle competition. As a result, prices of rice and wheat have remained stable over years, while other crops such as soybeans, corn and rapeseed have seen sharp price swings.Farmers like the arrangement because the government provides them with a guaranteed buyer, allowing them to easily secure informal short-term loans to buy farm inputs like seeds in a country where rural banking services are often inadequate.The new rules intend to liberalize trading by allowing farmers to sell crops outside the designated markets. Modis administration has promised that the welfare support mechanism will remain, but protesters arent convinced.Many believe the reforms are designed ultimately to cut the governments food subsidy bill expected to be $33.4 billion in 2021-22 by allowing market forces to drive down prices. The current support rates reflect the cost of production plus a 50% profit, which, along with assured purchases, has encouraged farmers to overproduce some crops. With India growing more wheat, rice, sugar cane and cotton than it needs, a free-for-all could cause prices to slump.Worse still, 86% of Indias farmers cultivate plots of about 2 hectares (5 acres) or less, while the other 14% own more than half the cultivated land. In an unfettered market, large landowners with lower costs per acre and better access to funds could end up dominating markets, forcing smallholders to sell their land. Thats a shift that took decades in many developed nations as rural residents migrated to cities to work in factories. But an accelerated transition on the scale of Indias population risks a major humanitarian crisis.Jokhu Ray, who grew corn and rice in the eastern state of Bihar, has had a taste of what a free market could mean. Bihar abolished its government-managed market in 2006 and Ray says the result was disastrous for him. In the 2019-20 crop year, he could only get 10 rupees (14 cents) a kilogram for his corn, less than the support price of 17.6 rupees or the 15 rupees he got the year before. Like many others, Ray left his village to seek work elsewhere and now works on a construction site in Rajasthan.Stories like Rays have fueled farmers fears. Protesters around the country held 3-hour chakka jams at the weekend, holding up traffic. The government blocked the internet at major protest sites and deployed some 50,000 police and paramilitary, along with riot control vehicles in and around Delhi, according to local media. After violence broke out at a Republic Day rally in the capital in January, the United Nations urged farmers to keep protests peaceful.The government has shut down the Internet here out of fear, said Singh, by phone. We are not scared. We are informing people through phone calls.We are urging those involved in agitation to end protests, Modi told lawmakers in parliament on Feb. 8. We should give these agriculture reforms a chance.Farmers instead are demanding new legislation that makes it illegal to pay less than the minimum support rate, a policy analysts say would distort the market even more. Private buyers could be scared off, forcing the government to have to step in and buy even more. That would worsen a fiscal deficit that is already expected to widen to 9.5% of GDP due to the coronavirus.State-run Food Corp. of India, the nations biggest food-grain buyer, is already stretched after buying 39 million tons of wheat and 52 million tons of rice from last years crop of about 108 million tons and 118 million tons respectively. Recent bumper harvests have filled many state granaries to bursting.Raising minimum prices each year could also hit exports, said B.V. Krishna Rao, president of the nations Rice Exporters Association. The moment we make minimum prices a legal obligation, we are bound to lose our share in the global market. He suggested that support prices should be set close to global levels and farmers compensated if needed for any losses.And there are other, even more serious long-term consequences if India doesnt find an equitable way to reform its agriculture, especially in states like Punjab and Haryana, where the protests began.Indias Green Revolution in the 1960s brought a surge in grain output in Punjab thanks to high-yielding seeds, mechanization and increased application of pesticides and fertilizers. Known as Indias bread-basket, the state supplied about one third of the 62 million tons of water-intensive paddy that the government purchased from monsoon-sown crops so far this year, according to the food ministry.States like Punjab grow more rice than they consume despite unfavorable terrain, which has resulted in a drastic depletion of their water tables, Rini Sen, an economist with ANZ Banking Group, said in a report.India has only about 4% of the worlds fresh water and farmers tap almost 90% of the groundwater available. Growers say they cant afford to switch from water-intensive crops such as rice and sugar cane unless the government ensures the same kind of price support for more sustainable crops like soybeans, mustard or pigeon peas (used to make dal).Finding a compromise that would reassure farmers they can still make a decent living while dismantling an archaic and inefficient agriculture market may be Modis hardest task to date. But as the two sides dig in for what could be a long and bitter stand-off, its one that India must solve.",Farmers protest: Why it may be a pivotal moment in India’s growth story,RICE

People rejoice as they welcome the spring season or the Vasant Ritu which is considered the king of all seasons as it is a balance between scorching heat, harsh winters, and heavy rains.Popular belief says that Goddess Saraswati, the Goddess of Knowledge, Art, Music, Science and Technology, was born on Basant Panchami and thus people worship her on this day.While many households perform the Saraswati Puja at home; the rituals are also performed at many educational institutions, libraries, offices etc. Worshippers offer pushpanjali (floral offering) to the Goddess and receive khichdi bhog and jaggery rice as prasad. People alsoadorn the threshold of their houses with beautiful alpona which is a sacred hand-painted art made with a paste of rice and flour. After the puja is complete, children bring their books and instruments to the Goddess and offer their prayers for her to enlighten them with knowledge and wisdom. People dress up in yellow as the colour is considered to be auspicious; it also marks the harvest of the mustard crop which has yellow blooms.According to the Hindu calendar, Basant Panchami is celebrated on the fifth day of the month of Maagh and thus, the name Panchami. This year the festival falls on Tuesday, February 16. This day is also considered great for new beginnings and so, many people begin work on this day.For more lifestyle news, follow us: Twitter: lifestyle_ie | Facebook: IE Lifestyle | Instagram: ie_lifestyle",Basant Panchami 2021 Date: When is Saraswati Puja in 2021?,RICE

(Express File)The Food Corporation of Indias (FCI) economic cost of wheat sold through the public distribution system (PDS) is budgeted to go up to Rs 29.94 per kg and that of rice to Rs 42.94 per kg in 2021-22, from their corresponding current levels of Rs 27.40 and Rs 39.99 per kg.These numbers are significant, given that under the National Food Security Act (NFSA) of 2013, 81.35 crore persons, accounting for over 67% of the countrys population, are entitled to receive 5 kg of PDS wheat or rice per month at Rs 2 and Rs 3 per kg, respectively.Also, the political pressure from the farmer protests may force stepped-up procurement by the government.At the projected economic cost of Rs 29.94/kg for wheat and Rs 42.94/kg for rice, the corresponding per-kg PDS consumer subsidy in the coming fiscal would work out to Rs 27.94 and Rs 39.94, respectively.The economic cost is what the FCI incurs in procuring, transporting, storing and distributing every kg of wheat or rice.The estimated Rs 29.94/kg economic cost for wheat in 2021-22 includes a pooled cost of Rs 19.21 (roughly what the farmer gets); procurement incidentals of Rs 3.20 (gunny bags, market fee, arhtiya commission, labour and other mandi-level expenses); and distribution cost of Rs 7.53 (freight, handling, storage, interest and other administrative charges).In the case of the Rs 42.94/kg for rice, the pooled cost is Rs 27.90, with procurement incidentals at Rs 4.85 and distribution cost at Rs 10.19.Under NFSA, enacted during the previous United Progressive Alliance regime, the Rs 2-3/kg PDS issue prices for wheat and rice were valid for up to three years from the date of commencement of the law on July 5, 2013.The Narendra Modi government has not raised these rates even as the Finance Ministrys latest Economic Survey has pointed to the need to consider a revision in the Central issue prices of PDS grain to reduce the bulging food subsidy bill.Meanwhile, rice and wheat stocks in the Central pool remain at way above necessary levels, despite the Modi government implementing special schemes for alleviating the widespread economic distress resulting from the Covid-19-induced lockdown.As against 65.91 million tonnes (mt) of grain offtake from public godowns in 2018-19 and 62.19 mt in 2019-20, the Modi government has allocated a total quantity of 94.37 mt in the current fiscal.That includes 57.15 mt under NFSA (at Rs 2-3/kg), 4.31 mt under other welfare schemes (at higher rates of Rs 4.15/kg for wheat and Rs 5.65/kg for rice) and 32.91 mt under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana.The latter scheme involved providing an extra 5 kg grain per month, free of cost, to NFSA beneficiaries (for eight months from April-November 2020) and 8 crore returning migrant labourers (for two months from May-June).But notwithstanding these extraordinary liquidation measures, total grain stock in the Central pool stood at 82.18 mt as on February 1, compared to 75.17 mt a year ago (see table).The 82.18 mt included 31.83 mt of wheat, 24.36 mt of rice and 38.79 mt of un-milled paddy (whose milled rice equivalent, at 67 per cent, was 25.99 mt).","Challenge for Food Corporation of India: Rising stocks, cost, & push to procure",RICE

It will improve irrigation facilities for 2.27 lakh acres of land and especially, Thanjavur and Pudukkottai districts stand to gain from this, he added.Appreciating the State farmers for a record food grain production and for the good use of water resources, Modi said that the Grand Anicut and its canal systems had been the life-line of the rice bowl of the State for thousands of years. Hailing the Grand Anicut as a living testimony to our glorious past, the Prime Minister quoted Tamil savant, Avvaiyar, saying that her verses provide an inspiration to Atma Nirbhar Bharat goals.Avvaiyar said: When water levels rise, cultivation rises, people prosper and the State prospers. We have to do whatever we can to conserve water, NarendraModi said. He added that the water issue was not just a national issue but a global subject. The mantra of per drop, more crop will help future generat ions, he underscored.Devendra Kula VellalarModi said that the Centre has accepted the long-standing demand of the seven sub-sects. They will now be known by their heritage name and not the six to seven names listed in the Schedule to the Constitution. The draft gazette to amend the Constitutional schedule has been approved by the Centre. It will be placed before the Parliament before the start of the next session. Thanking the Tamil Nadu government for a detailed study done on this demand, Modi recalled how emotional his meeting was with the representatives of Devendra Kula Vellalar community, five years ago.During the meeting, their sadness could be seen. Colonial rulers had taken away their pride and dignity. For decades, nothing happened. They pleaded to many governments but nothing changed. I told them one thing  their name, Devendra, rhymes with my own, Narendra, said the Prime Minister. This decision is more than a name change. It is about justice, dignity and opportunity. We all have lots to learn from the culture of the Devendra Kula community.They celebrate harmony, friendship and brotherhood. Theirs was a civilisational movement. It shows their self-confidence and self pride. Explaining welfare measures extended to the Lankan Tamils, the Prime Minister referred to the problems faced by fishermen from the State as well. Let me assure you that my government will always protect their rightful interests, he said.Modi pointed out that the Centre had ensured early release of fishermen whenever they were apprehended in Sri Lanka. Over 1,600 fishers have been released during our tenure. Currently, there is no Indian fisherman in Sri Lankan custody. Similarly, 313 boats have also been released and we are working for the return of the rest of the boats, he said.Thank you, says EPSThanking Modi for accepting his invitation to inaugurate and lay the foundation for projects in the State, Chief Minister Edappadi K Palaniswami requested him to provide necessary financial assistance to the Grand Anicut extension and modernisation scheme. Explaining its importance, Palaniswami said that the Grand Anicut, built by King Karikal Chozhan, stands tall even after many centuries trumpeting the engineering skills of Tamils to the world.EPS recalls appreciation for Covid efforts from PMOn the occasion, Palaniswami recalled Modis appreciation for the efforts taken by the State government in containing the Covid-19 pandemic effectively, and his advice to other States to follow the Tamil Nadu model. He also thanked the PM for announcing new NH projects, and improvement of various fishing harbours in the Budget. These projects would be a boon to the people of the State, he said.MORE PROJECTSChief Minister Edappadi K Palaniswami inaugurated and laid the foundation stone for a slew of projectsacross the State through video conference on Saturday","Centre with TN, says PM Modi after an Rs 8,000-crore infra blitzkrieg",RICE

The subsidy component remained 24.9 a cylinder. This is the second increase in LPG price this month. It was 735 for a domestic cylinder in the beginning of the month when it went up from last months price of 710.Ramakrishnan Ganeshh of Mylapore said that this hike was a burden on consumers. In the last three-and-a-half months, it has gone up by 175 a cylinder and the increase has happened twice in the same month. There are homes that have stopped buying even essential medicines meant for diabetes and blood pressure and begun depending completely on rice issued by the public distribution system, he said.These people have stopped subscribing for cable TV, switched over to consuming water from taps instead of buying water cans and stopped newspapers just to manage within their reduced income or no income due to job losses amidst the pandemic, he said.An oil industry observer said that LPG price is fixed based on international prices and accordingly, it should have gone up by 90 a cylinder in the beginning of the month itself. However, they did not want to effect the full hike since Parliament was in session and they did not want to attract attention to it, he said.A distributor said that bookings had been down this month. When a cylinder was priced 800 the last time, the subsidy component was 340 per refill. However, now it is only 25, which is a dismal amount, he said.J. Jayakumar, general secretary, Tamil Nadu Progressive Consumer Centre, said the oil companies should step in to help the consumers at such a point of time.They are their customers after all.

Causes of death were pending, but officials said the sub-freezing temperatures were likely to blame.The toll of the worsening conditions included the delivery of new COVID-19 vaccine shipments, which were expected to be delayed until at least midweek. Massive power outages across Houston included a facility storing 8,000 doses of Moderna vaccine, leaving health officials scrambling to find takers at the same time authorities were pleading for people to stay home.Temperatures nosedived into the single-digits as far south as San Antonio, and homes that had already been without electricity for hours had no certainty about when the lights and heat would come back on, as the States overwhelmed power grid began imposing blackouts that are typically only seen in 38-degree Celsius summers.The storm was part of a massive system that brought snow, sleet and freezing rain to the southern Plains and was spreading across the Ohio Valley and to the Northeast. The Southwest Power Pool, a group of utilities across 14 states, called for rolling outages because the supply of reserve energy had been exhausted. Some utilities said they were starting blackouts, while others urged customers to reduce power usage.Were living through a really historic event going on right now, said Jason Furtado, a professor of meteorology at the University of Oklahoma, pointing to all of Texas under a winter storm warning and the extent of the freezing temperatures.State officials said surging demand, driven by people trying to keep their homes warm, and cold weather knocking some power stations offline had pushed Texas system beyond the limits.This weather event, its really unprecedented. We all living here know that, said Dan Woodfin, senior director of system operations at the Electric Reliability Council of Texas. He defended preparations made by grid operators and described the demand on the system as record-setting.This event was well beyond the design parameters for a typical, or even an extreme, Texas winter that you would normally plan for. And so that is really the result that we're seeing, Mr. Woodfin said.More than 500 people were hunkering down at one shelter in Houston, but Mayor Sylvester Turner said other warming centers had to be shut down because those locations, too, lost power.The largest grocery store chain in Texas, H-E-B, closed locations around Austin and San Antonio, cities that are unaccustomed to snow and have few resources to clear roads. The slow thaw and more frigid lows ahead was also taking a toll on Texas distribution of COVID-19 vaccines.State health officials said Texas, which was due to receive more than 400,000 additional vaccine doses this week, now does not expect deliveries to occur until at least Wednesday.The weather also put existing vaccine supply in jeopardy. Rice University on Monday abruptly began offering vaccines on its closed Houston campus after Harris Health System told the school it had about 1,000 vaccines that were going to go to waste, said Doug Miller, a university spokesperson.The window was just a couple hours. They have to take care of it quickly, Mr. Miller said.Harris County officials said a facility storing the vaccines had lost power Monday and that a backup generator also failed. Ms. Hidalgo said she did not believe any vaccines were lost.Caught without enough groceries on hand, Lauren Schneider, a 24-year-old lab technician, walked to a Dallas grocery store near her home on Monday morning dressed in a coat, hat and face mask. Ms. Schneider said she didnt feel comfortable driving with the roads covered in snow and ice. She said she hadnt seen a serious snowfall in Dallas since her childhood.I really didnt think its would be this serious, Ms. Schneider said.Teresa and Luke Fassetta, trundling through the snow carrying grocery bags, said the store lost power while they were shopping. The couple said they lost power overnight, then got it back around 9 a.m., and they were hoping it would still be on when they arrived home. If not, Ms. Teresa said, we just have a bunch of blankets and candles and two cats to keep us warm.Several cities in the U.S. saw record lows as Arctic air remained over the central part of the country. In Minnesota, the Hibbing/Chisholm weather station registered minus 39 degrees Celsius, while Sioux Falls, South Dakota, dropped to minus 26 degrees Celsius.In Kansas, where wind chills dropped to as low as minus 34 degrees Celsius in some areas, Gov. Laura Kelly declared a state of disaster.Most government offices and schools were closed for Presidents Day, and authorities pleaded with residents to stay home. Louisiana State Police reported that it had investigated nearly 75 weather-related crashes caused by a mixture of snow, sleet and freezing rain in the past 24 hours.We already have some accidents on our roadways, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said during a morning news conference. It is slick and it is dangerous.Air travel was also affected. By mid-morning, 3,000 flights had been cancellated across the country, about 1,600 of them at Dallas/Fort Worth International and Bush Intercontinental airports in Texas. At DFW, the temperature was minus 15 degrees Celsius)  minus -16 degrees colder than Moscow.In Houston, officials said Bush Intercontinental Airport runways would remain closed until at least 1 p.m. Tuesday, a day longer than previously expected.The storm arrived over a three-day holiday weekend that has seen the most U.S. air travel since the period around New Years. More than 1 million people went through airport security checkpoints on Thursday and Friday. However, that was still less than half the traffic of a year ago, before the pandemic hit with full force.The southern Plains had been gearing up for the winter weather for the better part of the weekend. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott issued a disaster declaration for all of the States 254 counties. Mr. Abbott, Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt and Arkansas Gov.

(Michael A. McCoy/The New York Times)Capt. Paris Davis was in the thick of a predawn raid on an enemy camp in Vietnam when a grenade blasted out several of his teeth and, more troubling, tore off part of his trigger finger. Then enemy fire started pelting the Special Forces team he commanded. His most experienced sergeant was shot down. Then the demolitions specialist. Then the only medic.It was June 18, 1965, and according to after-action reports, Davis, 26, was suddenly the last American standing with a ragtag company of 90 South Vietnamese volunteers, pinned down by hundreds of enemy troops.In an undated photo from Ron Reis, Capt. Paris David, center, gives a tour of his camp in South Vietnam to the commander of U.S. forces there, Gen. William Westmoreland, left. (Ron Deis via The New York Times) In an undated photo from Ron Reis, Capt. Paris David, center, gives a tour of his camp in South Vietnam to the commander of U.S. forces there, Gen. William Westmoreland, left. (Ron Deis via The New York Times)Certain that he was as good as dead, he began fighting without fear of consequence, pulling his M-16 trigger with his pinkie, sprinting repeatedly into open ground to rescue teammates, and refusing to leave the fight, even after being shot several times.He made it out alive and was immediately nominated for the militarys highest award, the Medal of Honor. But the Army somehow lost the nomination. His frustrated commander resubmitted it, and inexplicably the nomination disappeared again.His teammates pushed several more times over the years for the medal, only to be met, they said, with silence and indifference. They eventually came to believe the Armys inaction had nothing to do with what the captain had done in 1965 and everything to do with who he was: one of the first Black officers in the Special Forces.What other assumption can you make? said Ron Deis, 77, who was the youngest soldier on the team in 1965 and is one of a group of veterans who are still pressing for Davis to receive the award.We all knew he deserved it then, Deis said during an interview from his home in Anchorage, Alaska, as he wiped away tears. He sure as hell deserves it now.After 55 years of trying, the group got a sign of hope in January. Acting Secretary of Defense Christopher C. Miller personally ordered an expedited review of the lost nomination, to be completed by March. The resulting report will then go up the chain to the secretary of the Army, the secretary of Defense and finally President Joe Biden. If they all sign off, Davis, now 81, may finally be recognized.The Army declined to comment on the award or answer questions about the reasons for earlier delays, saying in a statement that its policy is not to discuss any award until a final decision is made.In a recent video interview from his home in Arlington, Virginia, Davis, who retired from the Army as a colonel in 1985 after a highly decorated career, shook his head and smiled at the mention of the long-delayed submission. He downplayed the significance of all this stuff, medals and all that, adding, People need to keep on keepin on, he said. Weve got to make this a better world. Thats how I feel.Over generations, there are examples of the military struggling with bias when it came to recognizing valor. In the segregated forces that served in World Wars I and II, no Black soldiers were awarded the Medal of Honor, despite clear examples of selfless heroism. It was only decades later that some presidents worked to correct past injustices, but veterans groups say there remains much more to be done.When Davis took command of a Special Forces team in 1965, he was a tough but thoughtful college graduate with soft-spoken Midwestern humility, his fellow soldiers said. The son of a foundry worker in Ohio, he had studied political science on an ROTC scholarship at Southern University in Louisiana, played football and was named an All-American at halfback. In the Army, his quick mind and explosive strength earned him a spot in the elite and unruly Special Forces.He arrived in Vietnam a month after the bloody civil rights march in Selma, Alabama, at a time when the Special Forces, like the country as a whole, were fraught with racial tension. As a rare Black officer in the Special Forces, he was warned by his commander, he would have to work twice as hard.Youre going to have an all-white team, and you have some guys from Alabama and one from Mississippi  it could be a rough thing, Davis recalled his commander saying.The young captain tried to be friendly but told his men straight away that if they called him anything besides sir, he wouldnt waste time reporting them, he would just knock them to the ground.The team was airdropped in a remote farming district of Binh Dinh province, a thoroughfare for enemy troops heading south, where they were to train a force of local volunteers. The United States would eventually send thousands of troops to try to hold that province, but in early 1965, Davis team numbered just 12.He recalled that, as his commander had warned, not all of the men liked taking orders from a Black officer. But combat became a powerful unifier, and over time the team grew close.Soldiers forget race when they are fighting together, Davis said in a 1969 television interview. Were a kin. Not ethnically, but by virtue of being Americans.As the June 18 raid began, he and three other Special Forces soldiers crept silently through the jungle before the sun was up, leading a file of South Vietnamese troops to strike an enemy camp. Davis and the teams master sergeant, a Texan named Billy Waugh, stormed into the enemy commanders hut and killed him at close range, according to witness statements and Army records. Then the team surged through the camp, throwing grenades and shooting everything that moved. Caught sleeping, scores of North Vietnamese troops died in their cots, while others fled into the jungle.The captain was congratulating the team on a successful raid when enemy bugles sounded, announcing a counterattack by a much larger force.The team was pushed back into a muddy rice paddy with no cover. A sniper bullet shattered the knee of Waugh, and two more splintered his foot. On the edge of the paddy, the teams weapons specialist was knocked out by a mortar blast, and the medic was shot through the head.Davis and his company of local volunteers took refuge on a small hill and spent the next 10 hours holding off waves of attackers, some getting close enough that he killed one with the butt of his M-16.When American fighter jets bombed the enemys positions, instead of taking cover, Davis used the distraction to sprint out and rescue his wounded teammates, the after-action reports show. First he brought in the weapons specialist. Then he ran to get the master sergeant but was shot through the leg and had to retreat. During the next bomb strike, he limped back out across the rice field and grabbed the sergeant. A bullet clipped Davis arm this time, but he hoisted the sergeant over his shoulder and carried him back to safety.Reinforcements arrived and found Davis wounded and covered in blood. The major in command ordered him to evacuate, but he refused, saying he still needed to rescue his medic.Under the cover of friendly fire, he lurched again into the open, grabbed the wounded medic and started crawling back. Am I going to die? he recalled the medic mumbling to him. His reply: Not before me.All four of the Special Forces soldiers made it out alive that day. Waugh went on to a storied 40-year career as a CIA agent. Now 91, Waugh declined to be interviewed for this article, saying his memory was failing. In a summary of the battle he wrote in 2016, Waugh wrote about his former commander, I only have to close my eyes to vividly recall the gallantry.Knowing that Davis heroism easily cleared the bar for the Medal of Honor, his commander, Maj. Billy J. Cole, immediately submitted his name. He has showed as much cold courage as any human Ive ever heard of, Cole proudly told the newspaper that covered their home base at Fort Benning, Georgia.But nothing happened. The major pushed for an inquiry. In 1969, a hearing determined that no record of the original nomination could be found and directed the Army to resubmit it. The file disappeared again.Over the decades since then, men from the team petitioned their senators to revive the matter, without success. Cole, who died in 2003, grew so frustrated that in later years he wondered aloud if the obstacle might be race, according to his daughter, Carol Cole, who helped him write a memoir. She said that failing to get the medal for Davis was one of his greatest regrets.The cause was picked up in 2014 by a group of veterans and volunteers who specialize in winning recognition for overlooked Special Forces soldiers. They pieced together tattered newspaper clippings, yellowed Army files and firsthand accounts, and got their work into the hands of high-ranking Pentagon officials who moved the award forward.After the Army, Davis started a small newspaper in Virginia called The Metro Herald, for 30 years regularly publishing articles about the accomplishments of Black residents and local civil rights issues. During that time, he said in the interview, he gave little thought to why he had repeatedly run into danger in 1965 to save his men or why the medal nomination kept getting lost.I use this term a lot: Life suddens upon you; it just suddens upon you, he said. Every day, something comes up that you dont expect.After some thought, he smiled and added, Im not a victim of anything. The other night, I tried to write down the things Im a victim of. I couldnt think of a thing.","A Black soldier’s heroism, overlooked in 1965, may finally be lauded in 2021",RICE

This will also bring down the economic cost of the foodgrains that FCI procures, stocks and transports for distribution to nearly 82 crore beneficiaries under the national food security act .Sources said the average economic cost of wheat will decline by nearly Rs 300 per quintal in the case of wheat and Rs 400 per quintal for rice. They added that had the government not increased the budgetary allocation for food subsidy to FCI from Rs 78,000 crore to Rs 3.44 lakh crore during 2020-21, the interest burden of FCI on the loan it has taken would have increased to Rs 32,000 crore in the next financial year.Its a very bold step by the government. The higher allocation proposed for 2021-22 at Rs 2.02 lakh crore will reduce our outstanding loan and its very crucial for the finances of the organisation, which plays the most important role in food security, said a government official. According to official data, the total loan taken from National Small Savings Fund (NSSF) has kept increasing from only Rs 90,000 crore in 2015-16 to Rs 2.53 lakh crore in 2018-19. This year it touched Rs 3.5 lakh crore.Last week while replying to the budget discussion, Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman had said, Their (FCI) outstanding loans from NSS, that is, National Savings Scheme, are estimated to be reduced from Rs 3.39 lakh crore to Rs 1.19 lakh crore by the end of the current financial year and to only Rs 0.58 lakh crore by the end of the next of financial year. The government has been completely responsible and careful to repay the debts which are taken by the FCI from the NSSF.Sources said the governments decision to distribute additional foodgrains free of cost during the Covid pandemic also helped the FCI to free up space to keep the foodgrains being procured now. They said storage space to stock around 31.2 million tonnes of foodgrains was cleared. Had this not happened, we would have a huge problem by now.The total stock of wheat and rice with FCI as on February 1 is estimated to be 82.2 million tonnes, which is much higher than what the corporation needs to keep in the stock for operational and strategic purposes.",450% budget hike to give FCI Rs 17k cr relief,RICE

However, Chelsea 's 2-0 win over Newcastle United in Monday's late game lifted them above the Hammers again on goal difference.A fourth win in their last six league games boosted West Ham's hopes of a place in European club competition next season while keeping the Blades at the foot of the table with 11 points from 24 matches.""If you look at last season when we were fighting relegation to where we are now, there's been a massive improvement,"" said captain Rice.""It's massive to be in the top four and we need now to be pushing ourselves week in and week out.""The visitors received an early let off from VAR after Enda Stevens gave away a needless spot kick for a shove on West Ham defender Craig Dawson, as both were chasing the ball after goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale had parried away a Rice free kick.A VAR check found Dawson was offside when Rice struck the free kick, so the penalty was ruled out.But six minutes from halftime, Blades defender Chris Basham tripped Jesse Lingard in another clumsy challenge to hand West Ham a first penalty of the league season, which Rice tucked into the corner.Lingard again injected pace and energy into the West Ham attack as he continued to impress early into his loan spell from Manchester United .West Ham doubled their lead when Diop headed home from Aaron Cresswell's corner.It followed shortly after the best chance for the visitors when David McGoldricks headed effort was tipped over the crossbar by Lukasz Fabianski.Fredericks tucked away a shot deep in stoppage time after being set up by fellow substitute Said Benrahma to round off a satisfying evening for the hosts and another disappointing one for the Blades.""The game is hard enough for us in the Premier League, especially when we're not getting the results we want, and we can't make it even harder for ourselves, which we are doing now,"" Sheffield United boss Chris Wilder told BT Sport.",West Ham up to fifth after comfortable win over Sheffield United,RICE

The Budget promise resources and fund allocation for the contentious Chennai-Salem highway project, one that was vehemently opposed by farmers for it requires the acquisition of thousands of agricultural lands. While newer issues in the agriculture sector continue to take up our collective interest, heres documentary filmmaker Tamil Prabhagaran who has focused the lens on the unresolved issues of Tamil Nadus rice bowl  the several fossil fuel projects in the Cauvery Delta region and the havoc its wrought  with Soru.The movies working line is: how Indias dream on fossil fuel knocking the door of climate change and endangering onshore and offshore of Cauvery Delta region (rice bowl) of Tamil Nadu. Its about the exploration projects happening (and planned for) in the land and sea in these regions. It looks into the agricultural problems that affect the rice bowl region, and how the oil/hydrocarbon projects have added to this, he narrates.The film features the woes of the people of the core Cauvery Delta districts  Thanjavur, Thiruvarur and Nagapattinam. It was media reports and stray information about these projects that got him interested in the subject. He began work on it three years ago, planning to make a documentary short. But, when he landed in these districts for research, he understood how much people like him from the outside do not know about whats happening in plain sight. I had seen the presence of a few oil wells in TV reports. But, it was when I reached there that I realised they were everywhere. Besides the active ones, many had been drilled and abandoned too. That such massive projects had been sanctioned for the region that guarantees our food grain production came as a shock, he shares.For the farmers there, the problems start from the seed and last till insurance claim. Going beyond the sheer threat this poses to agricultural activity and, ultimately, climate change, the movie also delves into the politics of the oil game. Even as it talks about the profits that can be had by plundering the resources of this fertile belt, the movie will also tell you about who gets to benefit from these profits. The many contradictions within the government agencies that allow for these projects on such questionable turf have also been explored.The going was not without its share of troubles. One of them had been how little the local people were aware of whats happening around them. These projects had many a name. First, they said oil wells; then, it was methane extraction and hydrocarbon exploration. This did not only confuse me; the local people were equally confused. That all this is one and the same was made clear by the Hydrocarbon Exploration License Policy brought out by the Central government, he says. Getting some of the authorities to talk also had not been easy. But, beyond these functional difficulties, it was presenting the larger picture that proved to be the biggest challenge. When the world is moving towards renewable energy, the government is constantly presenting fossil fuel as a means of development.These projects, over the years, have offered no benefit to these districts or its people. Bringing out this narrative was challenging. Even shooting certain things turned out to be a problem. But, this offers a balanced narrative with fifty per cent of the movie hosting the opponents views as well, he reveals. Besides farmers, the film also features activists on the ground and working alongside the farmers  be it Bharathi Selvan from Mannargudi, professor Jayaraman or Iranian.The film, funded by the NGO Poovulagin Nanbargal, has garnered attention with the release of the music single Enga Nilam Enga? by Therukkural Arivu of the Casteless Collective fame. Within days of its release, the 3.50-minute song has received an overwhelming response on social media.

The farmers should double their income by cutting down expenditure in farming with the mechanisation, reducing the use of pesticides and fertilizers and by using organic fertilizers and also by cultivating commercial crops, he pointed out.Mr. Ravinder on Tuesday went on a whirlwind tour of Rajanna-Sircilla district participating in various developmental works of the bank in the interior villages. He inaugurated the DCCBs 32nd ATM centre in Rudrangi village, participated in a meeting with the PACS members of Chandurthi mandal and also visited the once Naxalite bastion village of Manala abutting the forests adjoining Nizamabad district, where the villagers have formed into society and joined the Karimnagar DCCB.Speaking on the occasion, he said that the farmers cannot reap riches by doing farming of cultivating conventional crops like paddy and cotton. They should process and add value to their products through rice mills and ginning mills respectively before branding and marketing, he stated. He also called upon the primary agricultural cooperative societies (PACS) to provide mechanised tools to the farmers on rent to reduce the farming costs and increase yield.At Manala village, which was merged with the Rajanna-Sircilla district from the adjoining Nizamabad district, he assured to sort out all the issues and take up regular lending of loans for agriculture and other purposes for the prosperity of the villagers.

Suspending the order of the State Election Commission (SEC) to stop door delivery of ration through mobile dispensing units (MDUs) in rural areas till the time colours on the vehicles are changed as they resemble a particular party, the High Court gave interim orders directing the SEC not to obstruct the distribution till March 15. Justice DVSS Somayajulu said that the State government has a good intention of providing rice and essential commodities to the poor people through door delivery.The wellbeing of people is the supreme law and keeping it in view, the court is issuing the interim orders allowing the government to deliver ration at the doorstep of beneficiaries through MDUs, he said. Justice Somayajulu observed that in view of the Covid-19 pandemic, door delivery of ration to beneficiaries will ensure that there will be no gathering of people at fair price shops. He further pointed out that the scheme is already being implemented in urban areas of the State.The operators of MDUs have purchased the vehicles by obtaining bank loans and they need to repay the debt. Changing the colours on MDUs involves a huge expenditure. It is not correct to stop door delivery of ration till the time colours on MDUs are changed, he said. On the objection raised by the SEC pertaining to photos of Chief Minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy and former Chief Minister YS Rajasekhara Reddy on MDUs, he cited the judgement of the Supreme Court in the State of Karnataka and Common Cause & others and also in another PIL, where the apex court did not impose any ban on using photos of political leaders and those in power in advertisements during elections.

2021-02-16,https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/farmers-protests-agricultural-reform-laws-modi-government-msp-7191647/,"The nearly three-month-long farmers protests continue, even as the Narendra Modi government isnt conceding to their demand to repeal its three agricultural reform laws. But the impact of the stir  which has also acquired political colour, with parties such as the Congress and Rashtriya Lok Dal holding kisan mahapanchayat rallies  is already being felt. Government agencies, last year, procured a record 52 million tonnes (mt) of milled rice and 39 mt of wheat, whose combined minimum support price (MSP) value was Rs 2,16,988 crore. Those all-time-highs are set to be surpassed this year. Rice purchases in the 2020-21 kharif marketing season (October-September) have so far been 15.4 per cent higher than for the same period last year. This story is likely to be repeated in wheat, where the new crop  which looks yet another bumper one, on the back of excellent rains and favourable winter temperatures  will start arriving in the mandis from late-March.There are clear political pressures driving the massive buying. The Modi government wants to dispel any apprehensions that its reform laws are aimed at ending the existing regime of MSP-based procurement through state-regulated mandis. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharamans latest Union Budget speech had a section detailing the significant increase in official purchases of not just cereals, but even pulses and cotton, under the present government. PM Modi himself has repeatedly emphasised that MSP was there, is there and will remain in future. Also, the biggest jump in rice procurement this time  from 10.9 mt to 13.6 mt  has taken place in Punjab, where the protests against the farm laws have been the loudest.But this apparent bending-over-backwards effort to pacify angry farmers isnt going to be costless. At 82.2 mt on February 1, total public stocks of rice and wheat were above the 75.2 mt level a year ago and could cross 100 mt by June. The COVID-19 lockdown afforded an opportunity last year to give out large quantities of grain from the Food Corporation of Indias warehouses free of cost, in addition to the regular subsidised sales at Rs 2-3/kg under the National Food Security Act. Such liquidation options arent available this year, save in the event of drought or a fresh pandemic. The FCIs granaries will, then, overflow further, even as its economic cost of procuring, storing and distributing wheat and rice is projected to touch Rs 30 and Rs 43 per kg, respectively. This is unsustainable. It raises a related point: Has the Modi government expended too much political capital on the farm laws, wherein any movement now on capping MSP purchases and replacing price with income support for farmers is ruled out? These reforms, along with deregulating urea prices or phasing out distortionary subsidies on water and electricity, may well be put on the backburner.",Price of reform,RICE

Wind-chill warnings extended from Canada into Mexico.In all, at least 20 deaths were reported. Other causes included car crashes and carbon monoxide poisoning. The weather also threatened to affect the nation's COVID-19 vaccination effort. President Joe Biden's administration said delays in vaccine shipments and deliveries were likely.North Carolina's Brunswick County had little notice of the dangerous weather, and a tornado warning was not issued until the storm was already on the ground.The National Weather Service was ``very surprised how rapidly this storm intensified ... and at the time of night when most people are at home and in bed, it creates a very dangerous situation,'' Emergency Services Director Ed Conrow said.In Chicago, a foot and a half (46 centimeters) of new snow forced public schools to cancel in-person classes for Tuesday. Hours earlier, along the normally balmy Gulf of Mexico, cross-country skiier Sam Fagg hit fresh powder on the beach in Galveston, Texas.The worst U.S. power outages were in Texas, affecting more than 2 million homes and businesses. More than 250,000 people also lost power across parts of Appalachia, and another 200,000 were without electricity following an ice storm in northwest Oregon, according to poweroutage.us, which tracks utility outage reports. Four million people lost power in Mexico.Texas officials requested 60 generators from the Federal Emergency Management Agency and planned to prioritize hospitals and nursing homes. The state opened 35 shelters to more than 1,000 occupants, the agency said.More than 500 people sought comfort at one Houston shelter. Mayor Sylvester Turner said other warming centers were closed because they lost power.After losing power Monday, Natalie Harrell said she, her boyfriend and four kids sheltered at a Gallery Furniture store in Houston. The warming center at the store provided people with food, water and power to charge essential electronics.``It's worse than a hurricane,'' Harrell said. ``I think we are going to be more days without light, that is what it seems like.''Utilities from Minnesota to Texas implemented rolling blackouts to ease the burden on power grids straining to meet extreme demand for heat and electricity.Blackouts lasting more than an hour began around dawn Tuesday for Oklahoma City and more than a dozen other communities, stopping electric-powered space heaters, furnaces and lights just as temperatures hovered around minus 8 degrees (minus 22 degrees Celsius).Oklahoma Gas & Electric rescinded plans for more blackouts but urged users to set thermostats at 68 degrees Fahrenheit (20 degrees Celsius), avoid using major electric appliances and turn off lights or appliances not in use.Nebraska's blackouts came amid some of the coldest weather on record: In Omaha, the temperature bottomed out at 23 degrees below zero overnight (minus 30 degrees Celsius), the coldest in 25 years.The Southwest Power Pool, a group of utilities covering 14 states, said the blackouts were ``a last resort to preserve the reliability of the electric system as a whole.''The outages forced a Texas county to scramble to administer more than 8,000 doses of Moderna's coronavirus vaccine after a public health facility lost power early Monday and its backup generator also failed, said Rafael Lemaitre, a spokesman for Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo.County officials distributed the doses that could have spoiled at three hospitals, Rice University and the county jail because there were large groups of people available who would not have to drive and appropriate medical personnel present.``It feels amazing. I'm very grateful,'' said Harry Golen, a college sophomore who waited for nearly four hours with his friends, much of it in the cold, and was among the last people to get the shots, which otherwise would not have reached students until March or April.Texas officials said more than 400,000 doses due now will not arrive until at least Wednesday because of the storm.The tornado that hit North Carolina's Brunswick County was an EF3 with winds estimated at 160 mph (257 kph), the weather service said on Twitter.Three people died and 10 were injured when the tornado tore through a golf course community and another rural area just before midnight Monday, destroying dozens of homes.Sharon Benson, 63, said her roof was damaged and her garage door blown off. Windows were shattered and nearby trees were uprooted.``The sky lit up and there was a lot of pop-pop-popping`` and thunder, she said.Authorities in multiple states reported deaths in crashes on icy roads , including two people whose vehicle slid off a road and overturned in a waterway in Kentucky on Sunday, state police said. A Mississippi man died after losing control of his vehicle, which overtuned on an icy road Monday night near Starkville, Oktibbeha County coroner Michael Hunt said Tuesday.In Texas, three young children and their grandmother died in the Houston-area fire, which likely began while they were using a fireplace to keep warm during a power outage, a fire official said. And in Oregon, authorities on Tuesday confirmed the deaths four people last weekend in the Portland metro area of carbon monoxide poisoning.At least 13 children were treated for carbon monoxide poisoning at Cook Children's Medical Center in Fort Worth, the hospital said in a social media post, which warned that families were ``going to extreme measures to warm their homes'' _ with propane or diesel-burning engines and generators, gas ovens and stovetops. One parent died of the toxic fumes, pediatrician Phillip Scott told Fort Worth television station KTVT.Other Texas deaths included a woman and a girl who died from suspected carbon monoxide poisoning in Houston at a home without electricity from a car left running in an attached garage, and two men found along Houston-area roadways who likely died in subfreezing temperatures, law enforcement officials said.In western Tennessee, a 10-year-old boy died after falling into an ice-covered pond on Sunday during a winter storm, fire officials said.Several cities had record lows: In Minnesota, the Hibbing/Chisholm weather station registered minus 38 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 39 degrees Celsius). Sioux Falls, South Dakota, dropped to minus 26 Fahrenheit (minus 26 degrees Celsius).At midday, more than 2,700 U.S. flights had been canceled, led by more than 800 at Dallas Fort Worth International Airport and more than 700 at Bush Intercontinental in Houston.Authorities pleaded with residents to stay home Tuesday.

The city is looking for businesses that still have power to open their doors as warming centers.It's critically, critically important to get the power restored as quickly as possible. It's priority number one! Mr. Turner said.Officials in south Texas warned citizens to not bring grills or propane heaters indoors. Hospitals have treated people for carbon monoxide poisoning as they tried to heat icy homes using those items.Mr. Turner said vaccination centers in Houston would remain closed on Wednesday and probably Thursday. The Texas Department of State Health Services said vaccine shipments around the state would be delayed.No one wants to put vaccine at risk by attempting to deliver it in dangerous conditions, department spokesperson Douglas Loveday said by email, adding it is not safe for people to be out across much of Texas.In neighbouring New Mexico, a state spokesperson said by email there were delays in some Pfizer vaccine shipments, which were expected to be brief.The deep freeze grounded operations at the Houston Shipchannel and curbed output in the nation's largest oil field: the Permian in West Texas.

Forecasters predicted up to 4 inches of snow and freezing rain from the southern Plains into the Northeast.We're calling it Storm System No. 2, with very similar placement to the previous storm, said meteorologist Lara Paganoof the National Weather Service's Weather Prediction Center in College Park, Maryland.An Arctic air mass descended over much of the country,pushing temperatures to historic lows on Tuesday, Ms. Pagano said.In Lincoln, Nebraska, a reading of minus 35 degrees Celsius on Tuesday shattered a record set in1978 of minus 27C.In typically toasty Dallas-Fort Worth, minus 17C broke a record set in 1903 of minus 11C.It's just dangerous, Ms. Pagano said.With more than 4.4 million power outages in Texas alone,authorities shut down inoculation sites and scrambled to use 8,400 vaccines that require subzero refrigeration before they spoiled after a backup generator failed, Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo said. Doses were rushed to area hospitals and Rice University to be injected into the arms of people already at those locations and who did not have to travel on slick roads.In the Southeast, a low-pressure system that developed along the Arctic front created fuel for storms that unleashed at least four tornadoes, said meteorologist Jeremy Grams of the weather service's Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Oklahoma. One ripped through the Florida Panhandle and two through southwestern Georgia on Monday.The fourth, most severe twister left three dead and homes flattened after it swept overnight through North Carolina's coastal Brunswick County in the state's south-eastern corner between Wilmington and Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, the local sheriff's office said early on Tuesday.After a brief lull on Tuesday, rough weather including potential twisters was expected to return on Wednesday into Thursday, Mr. Grams said.Those very same areas could be impacted  that will include tornadoes and damaging winds, he said.",21 dead as Texas deep freeze leaves millions without power,RICE

Separate regional grids in the Southwest and Midwest also faced serious strain. As of Tuesday afternoon, at least 23 people nationwide had died in the storm or its aftermath.Analysts have begun to identify key factors behind the grid failures in Texas. Record-breaking cold weather spurred residents to crank up their electric heaters and pushed power demand beyond the worst-case scenarios that grid operators had planned for. At the same time, a large fraction of the states gas-fired power plants were knocked offline amid icy conditions, with some plants suffering fuel shortages as natural gas demand spiked. Many of Texas wind turbines also froze and stopped working.The crisis sounded an alarm for power systems throughout the country. Electric grids can be engineered to handle a wide range of severe conditions  as long as grid operators can reliably predict the dangers ahead. But as climate change accelerates, many electric grids will face extreme weather events that go beyond the historical conditions those grids were designed for, putting them at risk of catastrophic failure.While scientists are still analyzing what role human-caused climate change may have played in this weeks winter storms, it is clear that global warming poses a barrage of additional threats to power systems nationwide, including fiercer heat waves and water shortages.Measures that could help make electric grids more robust  such as fortifying power plants against extreme weather or installing more backup power sources  could prove expensive. But as Texas shows, blackouts can be extremely costly, too. And, experts said, unless grid planners start planning for increasingly wild and unpredictable climate conditions, grid failures will happen again and again.Its essentially a question of how much insurance you want to buy, said Jesse Jenkins, an energy systems engineer at Princeton University. What makes this problem even harder is that were now in a world where, especially with climate change, the past is no longer a good guide to the future. We have to get much better at preparing for the unexpected.A System Pushed to the LimitTexas main electric grid, which largely operates independently from the rest of the country, has been built with the states most common weather extremes in mind: soaring summer temperatures that cause millions of Texans to turn up their air conditioners all at once.While freezing weather is rarer, grid operators in Texas have also long known that electricity demand can spike in the winter, particularly after damaging cold snaps in 2011 and 2018. But this weeks winter storms, which buried the state in snow and ice, and led to record-cold temperatures, surpassed all expectations  and pushed the grid to its breaking point.Texas grid operators had anticipated that, in the worst case, the state would use 67 gigawatts of electricity during the winter peak. But by Sunday evening, power demand had surged past that level. As temperatures dropped, many homes were relying on older, inefficient electric heaters that consume more power.The problems compounded from there, with frigid weather Monday disabling power plants with capacity totaling more than 30 gigawatts. The vast majority of those failures occurred at thermal power plants, like natural gas generators, as plummeting temperatures paralyzed plant equipment and soaring demand for natural gas left some plants struggling to obtain sufficient fuel. A number of the states power plants were also offline for scheduled maintenance in preparation for the summer peak.The states fleet of wind farms also lost up to 4.5 gigawatts of capacity at times, as many turbines stopped working in the cold and icy conditions, although this was a smaller part of the problem.In essence, experts said, an electric grid optimized to deliver huge quantities of power on the hottest days of the year was caught unprepared when temperatures plummeted.No ones model of the power system envisioned that all 254 Texas counties would come under a winter storm warning at the same time, said Joshua Rhodes, an expert on the states electric grid at the University of Texas , Austin. Its putting major strain on both the electricity grid and the gas grid that feeds both electricity and heat.While analysts are still working to untangle all of the reasons behind Texas grid failures, some have also wondered whether the unique way the state manages its largely deregulated electricity system may have played a role. In the mid-1990s, for instance, Texas decided against paying energy producers to hold a fixed number of backup power plants in reserve, instead letting market forces dictate what happens on the grid.On Tuesday, Gov. Greg Abbott called for an emergency reform of the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, the nonprofit corporation that oversees the flow of power in the state, saying its performance had been anything but reliable over the previous 48 hours.A Difficult Balancing ActIn theory, experts said, there are technical solutions that can avert such problems.Wind turbines can be equipped with heaters and other devices so that they can operate in icy conditions  as is often done in the upper Midwest, where cold weather is more common. Gas plants can be built to store oil on-site and switch over to burning the fuel if needed, as is often done in the Northeast, where natural gas shortages are common. Grid regulators can design markets that pay extra to keep a fleet of backup power plants in reserve in case of emergencies, as is done in the Mid-Atlantic.But these solutions all cost money, and grid operators are often wary of forcing consumers to pay extra for safeguards.Building in resilience often comes at a cost, and theres a risk of both underpaying but also of overpaying, said Daniel Cohan, an associate professor of civil and environmental engineering at Rice University. Its a difficult balancing act.In the months ahead, as Texas grid operators and policymakers investigate this weeks blackouts, they will likely explore how the grid might be bolstered to handle extremely cold weather. Some possible ideas include: Building more connections between Texas and other states to balance electricity supplies, a move the state has long resisted; encouraging homeowners to install battery backup systems; or keeping additional power plants in reserve.The search for answers will be complicated by climate change. Overall, the state is getting warmer as global temperatures rise, and cold-weather extremes are, on average, becoming less common over time.But some climate scientists have also suggested that global warming could, paradoxically, bring more unusually fierce winter storms. Some research indicates that Arctic warming is weakening the jet stream, the high-level air current that circles the northern latitudes and usually holds back the frigid polar vortex. This can allow cold air to periodically escape to the South, resulting in episodes of bitter cold in places that rarely get nipped by frost.But this remains an active area of debate among climate scientists, with some experts less certain that polar vortex disruptions are becoming more frequent, making it even trickier for electricity planners to anticipate the dangers ahead.All over the country, utilities and grid operators are confronting similar questions, as climate change threatens to intensify heat waves, floods, water shortages and other calamities, all of which could create novel risks for the nations electricity systems. Adapting to those risks could carry a hefty price tag: One recent study found that the Southeast alone may need 35% more electric capacity by 2050 simply to deal with the known hazards of climate change.The task of building resilience is becoming increasingly urgent. Many policymakers are promoting electric cars and electric heating as a way of curbing greenhouse gas emissions. But as more of the nations economy depends on reliable flows of electricity, the cost of blackouts will become ever more dire.This is going to be a significant challenge, said Emily Grubert, an infrastructure expert at Georgia Tech . We need to decarbonize our power systems so that climate change doesnt keep getting worse, but we also need to adapt to changing conditions at the same time. And the latter alone is going to be very costly. We can already see that the systems we have today arent handling this very well.",A glimpse of the future in Texas: Climate change means trouble for power grids,RICE

Traders and industry representatives have urged the state government to ease the impact by lowering local taxes.Petrol is sold at Rs 92.3 per litre and diesel at Rs 84.5 in Bengaluru. The freight charges for all commodities have gone up by at least 75 paise per kg. Wholesale prices of commodities are increasing because of higher freight charges and accordingly, retail prices are also climbing up, said Lahoti, a former president of the Bangalore Wholesale Food Grains and Pulses Association .Tur dal, which was available at Rs 90 per kg in November 2020, is now being sold at Rs 125. The price of edible oil has increased from Rs 85 per litre to Rs 142 in the same period.Prices are moving up at a time when the demand is low. For instance, about 100 trucks of rice arrive at the Yeshwanthpur APMC every day instead of the earlier daily average of 250 trucks. (Each truck carries about 20 tonnes of cargo.) The number of trucks bringing sugar has come down from 20 to 14 and those bringing tur dal, 60 to 35.A spike in the base price and higher central and state taxes have made fuel pricey. Traders are particularly concerned about trends in diesel prices. Diesel was sold at Rs 67.3 per litre a year ago. The fuel cost of a cargo truck was Rs 19 per km at the time. On Tuesday, the fuel cost was estimated to be around Rs 27 per km.The transport sector is also feeling the pinch. K Radhakrishna Holla, the president of the Karnataka State Travel Operators Association, said that the fuel cost of an Innova taxi had increased from Rs 10 to Rs 14 per km. This is at a time when only 40 per cent of 2.5 lakh taxis in Bengaluru are because of poor demand, he said.Truckers plan chakka jamMembers of the South Zone Lorry Owners Association plan to stage a chakka jam by parking trucks in the middle of highways next week.

Wind-chill warnings extended from Canada into Mexico.In all, at least 20 deaths were reported. Other causes included car crashes and carbon monoxide poisoning. The weather also threatened to affect the nation's COVID-19 vaccination effort. President Joe Bidens administration said delays in vaccine shipments and deliveries were likely.North Carolina's Brunswick County had little notice of the dangerous weather, and a tornado warning was not issued until the storm was already on the ground.The National Weather Service was very surprised how rapidly this storm intensified ... and at the time of night when most people are at home and in bed, it creates a very dangerous situation, Emergency Services Director Ed Conrow said.In Chicago, a foot and a half (46 centimeters) of new snow forced public schools to cancel in-person classes for Tuesday. Hours earlier, along the normally balmy Gulf of Mexico, cross-country skiier Sam Fagg hit fresh powder on the beach in Galveston, Texas.The worst U.S. power outages were in Texas, affecting more than 2 million homes and businesses. More than 250,000 people also lost power across parts of Appalachia, and another 200,000 were without electricity following an ice storm in northwest Oregon, according to poweroutage.us, which tracks utility outage reports. Four million people lost power in Mexico.Texas officials requested 60 generators from the Federal Emergency Management Agency and planned to prioritize hospitals and nursing homes. The state opened 35 shelters to more than 1,000 occupants, the agency said.More than 500 people sought comfort at one Houston shelter. Mayor Sylvester Turner said other warming centers were closed because they lost power.After losing power Monday, Natalie Harrell said she, her boyfriend and four kids sheltered at a Gallery Furniture store in Houston. The warming center at the store provided people with food, water and power to charge essential electronics.Its worse than a hurricane, Harrell said. I think we are going to be more days without light, that is what it seems like.Utilities from Minnesota to Texas implemented rolling blackouts to ease the burden on power grids straining to meet extreme demand for heat and electricity.Blackouts lasting more than an hour began around dawn Tuesday for Oklahoma City and more than a dozen other communities, stopping electric-powered space heaters, furnaces and lights just as temperatures hovered around minus 8 degrees (minus 22 degrees Celsius).Oklahoma Gas & Electric rescinded plans for more blackouts but urged users to set thermostats at 68 degrees Fahrenheit (20 degrees Celsius), avoid using major electric appliances and turn off lights or appliances not in use.However, Entergy began rolling blackouts Tuesday night in Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi and Southeast Texas at the direction of its grid manager, the Midcontinent Independent System Operator, as a last resort and in order to prevent more extensive, prolonged power outages that could severely affect the reliability of the power grid, according to a statement from the New Orleans-based utility.Due to extremely cold temperatures over the last several days, the demand for electricity has reached an all-time high, the Entergy statement said. Additionally, these weather conditions have forced off generation resources across the system. The implementation of this load shed across the Entergy region will help ensure an adequate reserve margin, which helps ensure Entergy is better positioned to manage through additional extreme weather this week.Entergy has almost 3 million electric power customers in the four states.Nebraska's blackouts came amid some of the coldest weather on record: In Omaha, the temperature bottomed out at 23 degrees below zero overnight (minus 30 degrees Celsius), the coldest in 25 years.The Southwest Power Pool, a group of utilities covering 14 states, said the blackouts were a last resort to preserve the reliability of the electric system as a whole.The outages forced a Texas county to scramble to administer more than 8,000 doses of Modernas coronavirus vaccine after a public health facility lost power early Monday and its backup generator also failed, said Rafael Lemaitre, a spokesman for Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo.County officials distributed the doses that could have spoiled at three hospitals, Rice University and the county jail because there were large groups of people available who would not have to drive and appropriate medical personnel present.It feels amazing. Im very grateful, said Harry Golen, a college sophomore who waited for nearly four hours with his friends, much of it in the cold, and was among the last people to get the shots, which otherwise would not have reached students until March or April.Texas officials said more than 400,000 doses due now will not arrive until at least Wednesday because of the storm.The tornado that hit North Carolina's Brunswick County was an EF3 with winds estimated at 160 mph (257 kph), the weather service said on Twitter.Three people died and 10 were injured when the tornado tore through a golf course community and another rural area just before midnight Monday, destroying dozens of homes.Sharon Benson, 63, said her roof was damaged and her garage door blown off. Windows were shattered and nearby trees were uprooted.The sky lit up and there was a lot of pop-pop-popping"" and thunder, she said.Authorities in multiple states reported deaths in crashes on icy roads , including two people whose vehicle slid off a road and overturned in a waterway in Kentucky on Sunday, state police said. A Mississippi man died after losing control of his vehicle, which overturned on an icy road Monday night near Starkville, Oktibbeha County coroner Michael Hunt said Tuesday.In Texas, three young children and their grandmother died in the Houston-area fire, which likely began while they were using a fireplace to keep warm during a power outage, a fire official said. And in Oregon, authorities on Tuesday confirmed the deaths four people last weekend in the Portland metro area of carbon monoxide poisoning.At least 13 children were treated for carbon monoxide poisoning at Cook Childrens Medical Center in Fort Worth, the hospital said in a social media post, which warned that families were going to extreme measures to warm their homes  with propane or diesel-burning engines and generators, gas ovens and stovetops. One parent died of the toxic fumes, pediatrician Phillip Scott told Fort Worth television station KTVT.Other Texas deaths included a woman and a girl who died from suspected carbon monoxide poisoning in Houston at a home without electricity from a car left running in an attached garage, and two men found along Houston-area roadways who likely died in subfreezing temperatures, law enforcement officials said.In western Tennessee, a 10-year-old boy died after falling into an ice-covered pond on Sunday during a winter storm, fire officials said.Several cities had record lows: In Minnesota, the Hibbing/Chisholm weather station registered minus 38 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 39 degrees Celsius). Sioux Falls, South Dakota, dropped to minus 26 Fahrenheit (minus 26 degrees Celsius).At midday, more than 2,700 U.S. flights had been canceled, led by more than 800 at Dallas Fort Worth International Airport and more than 700 at Bush Intercontinental in Houston.Authorities pleaded with residents to stay home Tuesday.

2021-02-17,https://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/chennai/2021/feb/17/a-decadent-tribute-with-tamil-flavours-2264951.html,"VAISHALI VIJAYKUMAR ByExpress News ServiceCHENNAI: Its not without any reason that we say Chennai is a city, but Madras is an emotion. Ask founders of Kocoatrait, Poonam and L Nitin Chordia, who have taken this emotion a notch higher with their latest limited edition of nine exquisite dark chocolate bars, all inspired by the flavours of the city and the state.Having sniffed the local flavours like panakam, sakkarai pongal, paneer roja and some others through their growing up years, it was time, they decided, to offer a fitting tribute to Tamil Nadu  where their heart finds a sweet home. We planned to launch this on the occasion of Tamil New Year last year, but it got rescheduled to the first week of February 2021, owing to the pandemic.This one year also worked for us as people became more aware of dark chocolates and its health significance. Were glad its happening now, says Nitin, co-founder and chocolatier. As a major chunk of the mindfully-curated collection of 75 boxes gets ready to be shipped, I get a sneak peek into the last batch of chocolate bars under preparation, at their facility in Gopalapuram.I find the perfect spot beside a grinder with heavy rollers ploughing back and forth through the velvety chocolate paste. Its hard to chew on any other thought, mind you, when you are on the dark side of this (chocolate) heaven. Just as I ready myself to be surrendered to these scents and sights, the couple offers me a fresh set of flavours  sukku malli kaapi, kozhukattai, malligai and mor milagai  to sample. What I taste is an alchemy of the choicest order.A dynamic combinationIts not easy to comprehend the magical compatibility of traditional flavours with a dark chocolate base. Poonam hands me over a spoon of malligai flavour in its semi-liquid consistency, fresh off the grinder. The flowers are sourced from specific vendors. If youre tasting jasmine, then its only the fragrance of the flower as we have not infused any oil or petals in the making as it has a sharp, bitter taste. Instead, we put the cocoa beans and jasmine buds in a container and let the flower blossom overnight. Once the flower blooms, the aroma gets captured, she explains.My favourite pick from the lot was mor milagai. For someone who has always enjoyed it in its crunchy form with curd rice during the summer, picturing it in a cold, condensed avatar of dark chocolate seemed inconceivable. But the traces of fermented buttermilk and tanginess in every bite betrayed my apprehension. Likewise, the strong flavour of roasted coffee beans in the filter coffee bar is no sublime offering for the faint-hearted. It wasnt easy to replicate the flavours. For instance, seven herbs went into making sukku malli kaapi. But the taste of dry ginger is dominant compared to the rest. You need to relish one cube at a time and let it melt in your mouth, slowly.It demands your attention to pick the right flavours. Cleanse your palate with water if you want to try another flavour or you may not be able to identify and appreciate the flavours to the fullest, offers Nitin. Four out of nine bars constitute A2 milk (extracted from indigenous cows), the rest are vegan and gluten-free, says Nitin. Each bar has a certain percentage of cocoa content.Higher the cocoa presence, higher the bitterness. We had to pair the flavour and cocoa accordingly so that one complements the other.Panchamritham, Tirunelveli halwa, coconut barfi...were all part of our ambitious list of choices but we didnt want the taste to overlap. For instance, kozhukattai has coconut filling in it and we use coconut milk and jaggery to replicate the taste. If we have coconut barfi as well on the list, then the two would taste similar because of the ingredients. This helped us narrow down. And, for sweetness, we have used only khandsari sugar, the non-refined version of sugar, he explains. I agree, feeling overwrought by the heady flavours.Sustainable in a sweet wayHaving always made inclusivity and sustainability a part of their brand, Kocoatrait also partnered with nine city-based sustainability initiatives and they find a place on the wrapper. The bars come in baskets woven by Chettinad artisans employed by M Rm Rm Cultural Foundation. On the inside of the wrapper, you will find a few musical instruments and Bharatanatyam dance postures sketched by two artists with disabilities  Rupak Manj e and Akas h Parekh. The printing is done by V Excel Foundation that employs persons with disabilities.We wanted to incorporate so much detailing into it so that every piece of the bar would have a local touch to it, details Poonam. To ensure the collection is eco-friendly, everything from the chocolate wrappers and the foil to the packaging box is plastic- free. Even the ink used for printing on the cover is water-based and does not have plastic. The baskets are multi-purpose and boxes are recyclable and biodegradable. Nothing that goes out of the store will harm the environment, assures Nitin. The chocolates are currently available for sale only on their website.We may go into reprinting depending on the demand. Each batch of the chocolate bar takes weeks to make it to the shelves. They go through multiple stages such as cleaning the cocoa bean, roasting them, removing shells and nibs, kneading them into paste and tempering. I want to give this box to the Prime Minister of India. This is a small way to take the pride of Tamil Nadu to a larger audience. Expect a coffee collection soon, notes Nitin. Sweeter words couldnt have been said to a coffee and chocolate lover. Some joys like chocolate are more than an indulgence. They are a way of life.The box of nine bars is priced at Rs 3,250 inclusive of delivery and taxes.

The scientists received a patent for the invention on February 8.The breakthrough technology is billed to be a potent weapon in the hands of the farmers to combat pest and insect attacks, which are increasing at an alarming rate.The AELT includes a light trap unit for attracting flying insects and a collector unit for depositing them. The scientists said monitoring insects in light traps will enable the farmers to know the species that lurk in the field and whether or not they are at a manageable level. Once the insect population in the light traps crosses economic threshold level (ETL), the farmers can decide on appropriate pest management interventions.Explaining the device, lead innovator Das Mohapatra said the light trap can be installed right on the crop fields. The collection unit has two chambers separated by a mesh with big size holes to separate the tiny insects (mostly beneficial insects) from the bigger ones. The unit further comprises a vibration assembly, which will separate the species.Once, the mesh starts vibrating, the tiny beneficial insects will fall down and get collected in the second chamber. The non-target insects can then easily escape into the crop environment. This facility for escaping of non-target/natural enemies from the main insect collection unit is a desirable attribute for bio-intensive approach of pest management, said Dr Das Mohapatra.The light trap unit is provided with a sensor which automatically gets lighted during twilight and switched off after three to four hours as per time set by the user in the timer. A heavy battery has been fitted with the device to store and operate the device even in the cloudy and foggy weather. The battery can run for four to five days. The device would cost between `4,100 and `8,000, Das Mohapatra said.",NRRI scientists develop solar device to combat pest menace,RICE

For starters, an enviable expertise in food from around the world. And the confidence to helm a large commercial kitchen that can whip up almost any dish requested by the diners. According to Satish Reddy who took over the reins of Le Meridien Kochi as its executive chef before the pandemic outbreak last year, the mark of a truly good chef is to gauge the preferences of the guests to serve their gastronomical desires on the plate.With the hospitality industry slowly getting back on its feet, Express caught up with chef Satish whose vision for the hotel is to bring the best of world cuisine to its diners. The hotel is currently hosting the Mumbai khau gali food festival on Fridays.Tell us a little about your background and your journey in the fine-dining sector.I was born and brought up in Chennai but my roots are in Andhra Pradesh. Even as a young boy, I was a foodie. I would be in the kitchen after school and experiment with recipes. Being a chef was a natural choice. I completed my higher education in Chennai. I have worked in Visakhapatnam, Chennai and the US with several high-end brands. My last base was Pune.How did you get acclimated to various cuisines?When I started, my focus was mainly on European food but the place where I was working back then emphasised Indian cuisine. So I would finish my work early and assist the chef whose speciality was Indian food -- eventually, that became my strength. The same happened with Chinese and others. Over the years I became familiar with almost all major cuisines except for confectionery. I have spent a good amount of time with each taste profile so I dont think there is currently a gap I need to fill.You landed in Kerala close to a year ago, what did you observe about the food culture of the state?I found that Malayalis are very open to experimenting with food. There is a lot of depth and nuance of flavour in Kerala food. There is also a lot of preference for meat and the sheer variety and the number of non-vegetarian preparations is huge. Around 65 to 70 per cent of the spread we have at Le Meridien is non-vegetarian which was not the case in the cities where I worked before.What is your stand on the fusion food trend that seems to have taken over the world?I am a proponent of traditional and authentic recipes than fusion preparations. Also, a majority of what is being termed as fusion food is inspired cooking. For instance, the pairing of kheema and appam is quite divine. So I would like to take the inspired cooking route.Rapid-fireAny new dish you encountered in Kerala?I found that appam or kallappam here is different from what you find elsewhere. Also the ada pradhaman and pazham payasam are excellent.What is your comfort food?Sambar with piping hot rice and fish fry on the sideOne place in Kochi/ Kerala you want to dine at I have heard there is a small shop nearby which serves toddy along with all kinds of meat.

Utilities from Minnesota to Mississippi have imposed rolling blackouts to ease the strain on electrical grids buckling under high demand during the past few days. And power outages have become a rite of summer and autumn in California, partly to reduce the chances of deadly wildfires.But the fact more than 3 million bone-chilled Texans have lost their electricity in a state that takes pride in its energy independence underscores the gravity of a problem that is occurring in the US with increasing frequency.Plunging temperatures caused Texans to turn up their heaters, including many inefficient electric ones. Demand spiked to levels normally seen only on the hottest summer days, when millions of air conditioners run at full tilt.The state has a generating capacity of about 67,000 megawatts in the winter compared with a peak capacity of about 86,000 megawatts in the summer. The gap between the winter and summer supply reflects power plants going offline for maintenance during months when demand typically is less intense and there's not as much energy coming from wind and solar sources.But planning for this winter didn't imagine temperatures cold enough to freeze natural gas supply lines and stop wind turbines from spinning. By Wednesday, 46,000 megawatts of power were offline statewide - 28,000 from natural gas, coal and nuclear plants and 18,000 from wind and solar, according to the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, which operates the state's power grid .""Every one of our sources of power supply underperformed,"" Daniel Cohan, an associate professor of civil and environmental engineering at Rice University in Houston, tweeted. ""Every one of them is vulnerable to extreme weather and climate events in different ways. None of them were adequately weatherized or prepared for a full realm of weather and conditions.""The staggering imbalance between Texas' energy supply and demand also caused prices to skyrocket from roughly $20 per megawatt hour to $9,000 per megawatt hour in the state's freewheeling wholesale power market.That raised questions whether some power generators who buy in the wholesale market may have had a profit motive to avoid buying more natural gas and simply shut down instead.""We can't speculate on people's motivations in that way,"" said Bill Magness, CEO of ERCOT. He added he had been told by generators that they were doing everything possible to provide power.Gas-fired plants and wind turbines can be protected against winter weather _ it's done routinely in colder, northern states. The issue arose in Texas after a 2011 freeze that also led to power-plant shutdowns and blackouts. A national electric-industry group developed winterization guidelines for operators to follow, but they are strictly voluntary and also require expensive investments in equipment and other necessary measures.An ERCOT official, Dan Woodfin, said plant upgrades after 2011 limited shutdowns during a similar cold snap in 2018, but this week's weather was ""more extreme.""Ed Hirs, an energy fellow at the University of Houston, rejected ERCOT's claim that this week's freeze was unforeseeable.""That's nonsense,"" he said. ""Every eight to 10 years we have really bad winters. This is not a surprise.""In California, regulators last week ordered the state's three major utilities to increase their power supply and potentially make plant improvements to avoid another supply shortage like the one that cropped up in California six months ago and resulted in rolling blackouts affecting about 500,000 people for a few hours at a time.""One big difference is that leadership in California recognizes that climate change is happening, but that doesn't seem to be the case in Texas,"" said Severin Borenstein, a professor of business administration and public policy at the University of California, Berkeley who has been studying power supply issues for more than 20 years.Grid operators say rolling blackouts are a last resort when power demand overwhelms supply and threatens to create a wider collapse of the whole power system.Usually, utilities black out certain blocks or zones before cutting off power to another area, then another. Often areas with hospitals, fire stations, water-treatment plants and other key facilities are spared.By rolling the blackouts, no neighborhoods are supposed to go an unfairly long period of time without power, but that was not always the case this week in Texas. Some areas never lost power, while others were blacked out for 12 hours or longer as temperatures dipped into the single digits.Rolling blackouts are usually triggered when reserves fall below a certain level. In Texas, as in California last August, grid operators tell utilities to reduce load on the entire system, and it is up to the utilities to decide how to do that.In Texas this week, grid operators and utilities knew about the dire weather forecast for at least a week. Last weekend they issued appeals for power conservation, and ERCOT tweeted that residents should ""unplug the fancy new appliances you bought during the pandemic and only used once.""The lighthearted attempts at humor were lost on residents, few if any of whom were told in advance when their homes would lose power. Once the outages started, some utilities were unable to provide information about how long they might last.Start with the obvious steps: When power companies or grid operators warn about trouble coming, turn down your thermostat and avoid using major appliances. Of course, those steps are sometimes easier said than done, especially during record-breaking temperatures.Like in other places, Texans might be more willing to adjust their thermostats a few more notches if regulators imposed a system that required households to pay higher prices during periods of peak demand and lower rates at other times.""People turn up their furnaces now because there isn't a financial incentive for them not to do it,"" Borenstein said.Experts also say more fundamental - and costly - changes must be made. Generators must insulate pipelines and other equipment. Investments in electricity storage and distribution would help. Tougher building codes would make homes in places like Texas better insulated against the cold.Texas, which has a grid largely disconnected from others to avoid federal regulation, may have to rethink the go-it-alone strategy. There could be pressure for the state to require power generators to keep more plants in reserve for times of peak demand, a step it has so far resisted.""The system as we built it is not performing to the standards we would like to see,"" said Joshua Rhodes, an energy researcher at the University of Texas in Austin. ""We need to do a better job. If that involves paying more for energy to have more reliability, that's a conversation we're going to have to have.""",Why the power grid failed in Texas and beyond,RICE

Stop. Its time to be seen with kombucha in your hand, as the brew evolves from virtuous health fad, to fiesty summer coolerConsider your drink game up-to-date if you have had kombucha and want it as your go-to summer drink this year. Those who have not tried it yet, even out of curiosity, better step up their beverage game.Home brewers of kombucha like to call it their lockdown drink experiment, driven by an urge to try and brew something new and safe for all. Soon enough, its popularity blossomed and kombucha made its way into branded bottles in cafes and store shelves in many cities.Home brewed brands like Kombucha of the Earth, Ombucha, Hydra Kombucha, Booch Please, CommBucha Happy Booch, Bhu Kombucha The Kombucha Co. etc are finding an increasing number of takers who want to experiment with newer drinks with or without health benefits.Rohan Srivatsa who launched Ombucha in Hyderabad following his lockdown trials, feels the drink is closely associated with veganism because of the ingredients used.He says, Every ingredient used is natural and plant-based, so it is assumed to be vegan. As a kombucha brewer, I would call it a safe drink for everyone. I got hooked on to it in Goa and back in Hyderabad, I couldnt find a good kombucha. So, I started brewing it on my own. I started small and when I was confident of the flavours, I began sharing it with friends.Dhanesh Sharma of Hyderabad-based Terrasen caf explains that kombucha is an ancient Central Asian drink. It started getting associated with vegan food because vegans, in their need to explore healthier alternatives, started exploring a food option that was less heard of, he adds.In layman terms, kombucha is a fermented tea that is best enjoyed cold, and may or may not be flavoured. It is often made from green or black tea. Kombucha brewer Renuka Vijay Kumar says, It is largely classified as a functional beverage, which means it is a non-alcoholic drink that contains vitamins, amino acids or other nutrients associated with health benefits.Talking about the merits claimed by kombucha brewers, Delhi-based nutritionist Lovneet Batra says Anything to do with gut health is gaining popularity these days. Kombucha being fermented tea, gets its probiotic goodness. The author of 50Desisuperdrinks, Lovneet adds, The addition of herbs and the use of green tea makes it an anti-oxidant.how Indians love to ferment Gundruk, fermented radish shootsShikanji made with winter black and red carrots and beetsFermented bamboo shootFermented cane shootTungrumbai made by the Khasi tribe of MeghalayaApong, fermented rice beerThe process of preparing kombucha can vary. As a thumb rule, it involves a double fermentation process wherein a SCOBY (a disc-shaped symbiotic culture of bacteria and yeast) is placed in a sweetened tea mixture and left to ferment at room temperature for one to three weeks. Then, it is bottled and made to sit, to encourage carbonation. After that, the bottled kombucha is placed in a cooler environment to slow down the carbonation and fermentation processes, adds RohanAdditionally, the anti-microbial properties of this process make its production sanitary, and safe for home-brewing.According to health journals like Science Direct, kombucha originated in Northeast China (historically referred to as Manchuria) around 220 BC and was prized for its healing properties.A question of rootsSome journals say its name is reportedly derived from Dr Kombu, a Korean physician who brought the fermented tea to Japan as a curative for Emperor Inkyo.Hydra Kombucha brewer Rahul S, based in Hyderabad, says he tasted his first kombucha in Gokarna while on holiday and soon began brewing it from his place in Manipal.Rahul says, I was a student at Manipal and wanted to drink kombucha once I was back from my holiday. When I couldnt find any, I decided to brew my own kombucha . I studied all about the brewing process on the Internet. After two or three trial batches, I had my drinks. When I first made kombucha three years ago, it took me six or seven months to make small batches and cater to smaller groups who appreciate the drink.Rahul suggests fruity tropical flavours as the best ones to begin with. Rohan adds that a number of the followers of his brand are people who look for anything fizzy, non-alcoholic and not sweet. Those who want to avoid sugary fizzy drinks, happily pick up a kombucha.But let us not be fooled: kombucha has sugar and Lovneet suggests that to avoid excess intake of sugar we must pay attention to the label.A 250 ml bottle shouldnt contain more than 10 grams of sugar, she advises.",Cha-cha with kombucha,RICE

A window into another city, another life.Once every month at their nascent Instagram business Koi (@cookwithkoi), the 22-year-olds curate DIY meal kits featuring traditional food from faraway lands. Founded in July last year, the Koi box has brought customers, in Mumbai and Bengaluru, three-course meals from Thailand, Vietnam, Korea, Greece, and Spain. This month, Koi heads to Japan; the kit contains all ingredients needed to make Japans umeboshi onigiri  seasoned sticky rice parcels wrapped in seaweed and stuffed with salty sweet plums; miso nikomi udon  a bowl of umami flavoured chewy noodles; and fluffy souffle pancakes.Aaron and I have known each other through college. Food and travel is what we bonded over, says Arnav. The duo has travelled across South-East Asia, to Singapore, Vietnam, and Thailand. Everywhere they went, food was the first thing to make me feel at home in a new place, says Arnav.I remember talking to Aaron about a specific kind of noodles that you just dont get in Mumbai. You can probably Swiggy or Zomato it, but you have to really look for these niche places, adds Arnav, We have such great memories of all these foods from different places and we just wanted to share them with our family and friends.So while the travelling has paused, their experiments with cooking foreign dishes began. Arnav recalls the deep, happy slumber he fell into, 30 minutes after polishing off an indulgent treat of loukoumades  Greek fried doughnuts, served with honey and orange sauce  that he made from scratch. Aaron, on the other hand, took a deep dive into Asian fermented foods. Kimchi was the first thing that I ever tried and it opened up a whole new world for me, he says.Sourcing the exoticAaron explains that they select recipes of food they have tasted, or take extensive feedback from those familiar with the culture in question.Initially, we replicated the recipes with Indian ingredients, but now we also import certain ingredients, he says, Take the Japanese box for example: it needs a combination of fresh and dry shiitake mushrooms, which we get from a mushroom farmer in Lonavala. But others like matcha tea leaves, and togarashi ( a mixture of seven Japanese spices), are easier to import.Once the recipes are tried and tested, ingredients for a three-course meal (barring kitchen essentials such as sugar, salt, pepper, oil, milk) are packed into the kit. Orders are open until the 21st of every month, and on the last Saturday, the boxes are packed and dispatched with a recipe note.So far, the Korea and Greece kits have seen the best sales, says Arnav, Ever since we did these two countries, people have asked us to do it again for birthday parties. So now, Koi also offers meal kits for events.This year, expanding their original idea, Koi has started mid-monthly kits delivered every second Saturday. Called the Dive Bar Nostalgia kit, it was targeted at those missing student haunts next to colleges, and featured combinations like chaklis with Schezwan, cheese and popcorn, and butter garlic naan with chicken or paneer chilli.People will pay for experiential dining, this they have zeroed in on. Meanwhile, they are choosing between Indonesia and Sri Lanka for the next month. Do they every worry they will run out of countries?We will go back and revisit every country; we have just made three out of the thousand dishes they have. So it is more a problem of plenty, and the world is very much our oyster, says Aaron.","Experience one foreign cuisine every month, with Koi’s DIY mealkit",RICE

But, look past the wonders of such easy access, and youll find that it doesnt apply to a karupatti kadalaimittai or a panam kizhangu halwa. It was precisely this conundrum that P Balathandayuthabani and S Balaji wanted to address when they quit their jobs and launched B&B Organics. Working with farmers from across Tamil Nadu, the duo has made available several varieties of indigenous rice and traditional produce, and the byproducts they have to offer. Four years down, the Tiruchy-based company has a second base in Washington and customers from the US and Scandinavian countries.First stepsAll this started with just trying to source authentic organic food for his brother, says Bala. Balaji and I are agriculture students; I did my Bachelors in organic farming. We got to meet many farmers in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry. Then, I moved to Sweden to pursue my Masters and PhD. When my brother wanted organic food, I sourced it for him. Later, his friends reached out too. So, we realised that there is a demand for the food but people were not sure about the authenticity of the organic food they were getting. We wanted to break this mistrust, recounts Bala. Armed with the theoretical knowledge of the business that their education gave them, they decided to take the plunge into the bottomless world of entrepreneurship. After a year of ground research, they set up the store. And thats where it stopped going as per plan.They started with different types of indigenous rice but couldnt sell anything. When bugs began feasting on the stored-away produce, it was Balas mother who stepped in and bought it from him. Ladys fingers is available in the market for say `20 per kg; if we sell organic ladys fingers for `40, even the affluent people were not willing to buy. We couldnt market anything that way, he narrates. It was then that they decided to build a unique identity for themselves, instead of competing in a market that already had organic brands that were far older than them.The first step was to reassure the customer that their products were 100 per cent organic. They began sending samples of all the products they had in store for testing and provided the nutritional information for the customer. With that out of the way, they focussed on creating a stand-out inventory  one that featured produce and products that were nearing extinction from disuse. We collaborated with farmers to bring many indigenous rice varieties to the open market. Initially, the farmers were hesitant. But, we let them fix the price and promised to deliver on it; even then, they were reluctant. When we started buying from them (post-harvest), they began to trust us. Now, we work with over 500 farmers and sell more than 50 rice varities. With this, we began to provide value-added products (flour, rice flakes, dosai batter). Soon, we plan to increase it to 365 kinds of rice, he details.Finding a balm for palmThe interest to bring back foods that are fast disappearing from our way of life turned their attention towards the palm tree. It was this search that led them to introduce kadalaimittai made with palm jaggery and palm sugar syrup to their list. Even as the trees population is on a steep decline in the state, they are teaming up with palm workers from several districts to bring out more products like panam kizhangu halwa. Karupatti-based sweets, millet cookies, millet/red rice noodles and semiya are in the making too.The website also provides insights on the best nutritional cures/supplements for ailments and the perfect additions for an average humans age and gender-based needs.

Even as start-ups like his are doing their part in bringing the balance back to our skewed lifestyles, we  as the consumer  just step up and take responsibility in our choices, urges Bala. When it comes to food, people look for cheap stuff. It is important to know where the food is coming from and how its made. Now, theres plenty of awareness for cold-pressed oils. But its the people who force the sellers into adulteration. If a litre of cold-pressed gingelly oil is sold for `350, thats the real price. When we expect that for `100-`200, theres adulteration.

2021-02-18,https://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/chennai/2021/feb/18/preservingpaddy-for-posterity-2265429.html,"Kannalmozhi Kabilan ByExpress News ServiceCHENNAI: While the Green Revolution has been credited, among other things, with furnishing answers to humankinds pressing need to end drought, it has also been heavily criticised for squandering biodiversity in lieu of high-yielding hybrid varieties. Even as weve been reduced to consuming just a handful of rice, pulses and vegetables, the fairly sustained organic farming wave over the past decade has been trying to script a change. More people are going out of their way to learn about indigenous crop variants, more farmers are being able to take that risk and, in the process, theres an alternative market in the making. Furthering this revolution, on the side of revival, is the Thondaimandalam Foundation and its paddy conversation project. This initiative, started in August 2019, focuses on cultivating, conserving and characterising over 150 indigenous rice varieties.Genetics matterMany people claim that they have 20 varieties of paddy, or that they cultivate over a 100 types. But, the problem is, they do not know if these varieties are genetically pure; for they dont know how to maintain such purity. Earlier, farmers used to have one or two types of rice to raise on their lands. So, there was no risk of cross-pollination. Now, the conservators have the quantity over quality method; which means, a few years down the line, the seed quality would change. Then, people would argue over who has the right kind of see for a particular variety, explains Hima Kiran, organic farmer and a trustee of the Foundation, detailing the common problems plaguing the conservation sector. This is where they step in.Hima and his fellow conservators follow a parameter-based template  over a course of three years  to ensure that the genetic makeup of a particular indigenous variety is preserved in its true form. Many of them have been trained in genetic characterisation by Dr Debal Deb, an Odisha-based scientist, farmer and founder of the largest folk rice seed bank in eastern India  Vrihi Beej Binimoy Kendra. Those who attended the training are scattered in a few districts; thats where we are doing this project. Paddy has over 50 genetic characteristics. We study about 35-40 of them  colour of the rice, the horn, grain length and width, leaf angle and much more  from seed to post-harvest stage. It is this methodology that he trained us in, says Hima. This theoretical information has to be tested against the crops in the field. For their project, they have started work on the seed varieties they acquired from Deb and other indigenous ones they managed to source in the Thondaimandalam region. They use this process to raise the paddy and maintain records of the yield. For example, if its seeraga samba, anyone will be able to check the yield against their database and determine its genetic purity. Thats what they are working towards.Risks and recordsOn his part, Dr Deb is said to be working on a book, documenting the over 1,400 paddy landraces (see box) in his possession. The book would be a peer-reviewed work that offers the genetic characteristics of all these varieties. The Foundation essentially carries his work forward to the field, ensuring that conservation doesnt stop at the records. In the next two-three years, if we manage to train 20-30 people, then well be able to raise all 1,400 varieties. This is important because this is where we will be able to find solutions to many problems that might befall us in the future. For example, women are prone to anaemia; they are prescribed iron tablets for it. But, there are rice varieties with a high iron content. In tribal societies, if a woman seems anaemic, she will be given the kanji of that rice. There, it becomes a solution for food security, nutrition security and health; besides being heavily localised. From here, we have moved to the standardisation brought in by corporatisation. From one lakh varieties, we are now working with just 200, he says.Beyond this, the biggest risk we face as a modern society is that we have not domesticated any new variety of rice in the past 100 years. If the future were to bring in a big calamity in the form of climate change or a plant disease, the high-yield varieties will not hold. Then, what will we produce for our food? After the tsunami in 2004, salinity in the soil increased in the affected areas. Even then, the department varieties did not work well. It was traditional salt-tolerant varieties that managed to thrive. Debal Deb also contributed to the effort then. Tomorrow, if the government says it is ready to promote traditional varieties, we need the seed and it has to be pure. Thats what we are trying to achieve, he concludes.Besides this project, the Foundation has also been working on many others that ensure income generation and livelihood guarantee for villagers. Conservation of waterbodies, native cattle and red sheep and tree plantation drives are also part of their extensive portfolio. All this is hinged on one central principle. Modernity is a continuum. What was modern when we were in college would be old for youngsters today. But, some things live past its era. Instead of dismissing them as old, we have to look at how best we can take it forward to the next generation, he declares.To know more about their work and participate in it, visit: thondaimandalam.org",Preserving paddy for posterity,RICE

In States such as Punjab and Haryana, where the agitation has been strongest, middlemen who act as commission agents or arhitiyas are a key part of the procurement process at these mandis.The Centre had already taken steps to roll out online payments to farmers who sell their produce to the government, said Food Ministry Additional Secretary Edwin Kulbhushan Majhi. It had directed the State governments of Haryana and Punjab to ensure payments in e-mode from the upcoming season, and was expecting all States to follow suit this year.We would like all payments released by the Central government to farmers, that we are able to track them online. There should not be any intermediaries, farmers should not be given cheques to be encashed. The money should go directly into the farmers accounts, said Mr. Majhi.Faster processThe next step was the biometric authentication scheme that U.P. had already rolled out. The entire process of procurement has to be made faster. Once you have data of farmers available, and once they are bio-authenticated, the entire details are digitally available to the procurement machinery, the kind of crop hes cultivating, the kind of landholding he has, all the details are available, said Mr. Majhi.This initiative reduced the need for extensive paperwork, prevented leakages and speeded up the process of procurement, with payment settlement being completed within 72 hours, he said, adding efficiency and greater cost-effectiveness to the system.The other advantage is that the farmer gets a receipt for his goods, showing the quantity and the MSP price, so nobody can cheat the farmer. He gets the full fair price, said Mr. Goyal. He did not respond to a query whether bio authentication would be mandatory for farmers to participate in the procurement process.States are welcoming it, it is easier for the farmer, the farmer doesnt have to depend on the middleman or the arhitiyas, added Mr. Majhi.With regard to the Economic Surveys recommendation for a hike in the subsidised prices of rice and wheat sold at ration shops, Mr. Goyal said it was not under consideration at the moment. At present, there is no such proposal in the Ministry to increase the prices of products given under the [National] Food Security Act. It continues to be 3, 2 and 1 for rice, wheat and coarse grain [respectively], he said.The Economic Survey had urged that prices be hiked in order to reduce the burgeoning food subsidy bill.",Biometric authentication to benefit farmers: Centre,RICE

It was a wedding with too many twists in the tale - a bride on the run; a humiliated groom in for a surprise and entry of police at the end.After his would-be bride eloped with her boyfriend with the marriage procession only 50 metre away from her house, a 26-year-old youth did not return disheartened from the hamlet under Jaipatna blocks Badkarlakot village. He was in for a bigger surprise when the bride's family offered her minor younger sister for marriage.The groom had the consolation of a symbolic marriage with the 15-year-old girl but his cheer was short-lived as the district administration reached his house in Tentulikhunti village under Kalampur block and took away the bride.The drama unfolded after the groom Ramesh (name changed) reached Badkarlakot in a procession to marry Sarita (name changed). When he was metres away from the brides house, Sarita eloped with another man wearing all the gold ornaments bought for the marriage.On hearing the news of the missing bride, panic broke out among members of both the bride and grooms families. Fearing social stigma, the brides father offered to marry off his younger daughter to the groom.Later, a symbolic marriage was conducted with Ramesh applying rice tikka on the girls forehead. In the night, the groom returned home with the girl.On being informed that the girl was a student of Class X in Badkarlakot high school and set to appear for her board examinations this year, Jaipatna Child Development Project Officer (CDPO) Sukanti Behera and police reached her house at Malguda late in the night.However, she had already left with the groom. The CDPO along with the police team reached Rameshs house at Tentulikhunti at around 4 am and rescued the girl. The grooms family members were counselled and told that the girl was a minor and is not of marriageable age.They agreed and handed over the girl to her brother who was accompanying the team. The girl is now staying in her own house with her parents and will appear in the Class X examinations later this year.

Her acrimonious relationship with Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy over the last four and a half years, eventually led the Centre to being forced to act against its own nominee to enable smooth administration at a time when the announcement of the Assembly elections is just round the corner. Despite her laying emphasis on sanitation, rejuvenation of waterbodies, and transparency and accountability in the administration, Ms. Bedi ended up, in the eyes of the public, being someone who was disrupting administration. Her many differences with the CM were well known. Be it the suspension of an official over obscenity on social media, the helmet rule for two-wheeler riders, the free rice scheme, the appointment of the State Election Commissioner, the quota for government students in medical admission, or even the manner of release of money from the CMs Fund, she was caught up in a war of words with the CM instead of being more discreet. She should have shown more restraint as a constitutional functionary and adopted a consensual approach on matters affecting the people directly, even though the Lt. Governor in a Union Territory, as the Presidents nominee, enjoys powers superior to those of the CM and the Council of Ministers. Though it was an amusing sight of the CM holding dharnas, not once but twice in the last couple of years, the fault was not entirely his own. All along, he regarded the Lt. Governor as a political adversary, with his political activity centred around her. His demand for her ouster grew louder in recent months. It is likely that the Bharatiya Janata Party, which aims to build a base in Puducherry, concluded that her continuation in office in the backdrop of the Assembly elections could prove a political liability.Her exit comes at a time when Puducherry is in the midst of political instability. The strength of the Congress-led coalition (including the Speaker) is now on a par with that of the Opposition, after four party MLAs, including two Ministers, quit the Assembly since January. On assuming charge as the officiating Lt. Governor on Thursday, Tamilisai Soundararajan, the Telangana Governor, ordered a floor test to be held on February 22. Dr. Soundararajan, who is perceived to be cordial towards political leaders of all hues, is expected to restore some measure of cohesion between Raj Nivas and the rest of the official machinery, irrespective of the outcome of the floor test. Ms. Bedis innings in Puducherry should serve as a lesson to those in constitutional positions that however well meaning ones actions may be, one should not go beyond the mandated role.",End of an innings: On Kiran Bedi’s ouster,RICE

(Eli Hartman/Odessa American via AP)The White House said on Thursday a severe winter storm engulfing Texas and nearby states was the type of extreme weather event that climate change is triggering, rejecting assertions by Texas officials that green energy caused widespread power outages.The crisis in the largest U.S. oil- and gas-producing state has put Democratic President Joe Bidens White House squarely at odds with Republican Texas Governor Greg Abbott, who initially did not acknowledge Bidens 2020 election win.Read | Reeling from a brutal storm, Texas now faces water shortageAbbott had ordered state officials in January to fight Bidens push to combat climate change by pausing new oil and gas leases, and cutting fossil fuel subsidies.Biden spoke with Abbott late on Thursday, promising the federal government would continue to work with state and local authorities to meet the critical needs of those affected, the White House said in a statement. Biden also said he would instruct additional federal agencies to look into immediate steps that could be taken to help Texans.White House homeland security adviser Liz Sherwood-Randall told reporters earlier that 1 million or more people were still suffering power outages as a result of the storm and blamed it on climate change, which some Republican officials in affected states have denied or downplayed.Read | Texas power plants back online, but 325,000 households still in the darkThe extreme weather events that were experiencing this week  do yet again demonstrate to us that climate change is real and its happening now, and were not adequately prepared for it, she told a White House phone briefing.White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said Biden also spoke two days ago with Abbott, who came under fire this week after initially blaming the crisis on Democratic efforts to transition to green energy sources and away from fossil fuels.She noted that the Texas agency that operates the states power grid itself had said that failures in solar and wind power were the least significant factor in the blackout.Reports that suggested otherwise were inaccurate, Psaki said, adding it was critical to assess how to better protect the U.S. national infrastructure and ensure its resilience going forward. The Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), a cooperative responsible for 90% of the states electricity, said on Thursday it had made significant progress in restoring power. It did not provide detailed figures.Some 325,000 Texas households were still without power, down from about 2.7 million on Wednesday, according to poweroutage.com, a website that tracks outages.INFRASTRUCTURE WEAKNESSESAngry residents have trained much of their ire on ERCOT, which critics say did not heed warnings after a cold-weather meltdown in 2011 to ensure that Texas energy infrastructure, which relies primarily on natural gas, was winterized.Two-thirds of the electric power that was lost during the cold was due to a lack of natural gas supplies, and one-third came from wind turbine shutdowns, said Jim Blackburn, an environmental lawyer and Rice University professor. Abbott said on Thursday he asked the state legislature to mandate the winterization of generators.Sherwood-Randall said the storm, which left millions of people in freezing temperatures without heat and adequate water pressure had exposed weaknesses in American infrastructure that needed to be addressed.Power grids across our country, particularly in Texas, are overloaded by the demands that are placed on them under these conditions, and the infrastructure is not built to withstand these extreme conditions, she said.Biden would lead an effort to strengthen and harden our critical infrastructure so that it can be prepared to meet a full spectrum of challenges that were likely to face, Sherwood-Randall added.Psaki said the administration was working to hammer out a large infrastructure modernization plan that would be introduced once Congress passed a $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package.",White House says Texas winter storm likely due to climate change,RICE

His designs and colourways go beyond the Jaipur market and have a contemporary appeal: a bangle with one end twisted into a snake head; a speckled choker, primary colours mixed into a black base; beads twined into balls or fashioned into barrel shapes.Avaz Mohammed working with lac in his studio | Photo Credit: Special ArrangementTools of the tradeI am the seventh generation doing this work, he says, having trained his children to take the craft forward. We sit on the floor in his home and studio near Jaipurs Jantar Mantar as he explains the way lacquer is made: 250 grams of resin from the cheed ka ped (pine), half a kilo lac from the peepal, budh, beri (the cheapest), or kusum (the most expensive) trees, and one kilo soapstone powder. The lac itself is an insect secretion found on the tree. A lot of what you see in the market is just resin and soapstone, he says, as he praises his daughter, who teaches other women the trade.Indiraji [late prime minister Indira Gandhi] came to one of my exhibitions, he shares, showing a four-inch thick album with pictures of his work, dignitaries, and a thank you note from the Prince of Wales. The conversation traverses many areas and takes us through time.Abhi biryani mangva deta hoon [Ill order some biryani now], he says, gesturing to one of his family members who are hovering around with water, milky North Indian coffee, sweets and mixture. The generosity of spirit is humbling. Especially when his wife, Anwar Jahan, tells me, The lockdown was almost a year of starvation for us. But they are not billing me for the biryani, their time or the use of their tools: the bhatti with coals to soften the sticks of lac, the wooden hatta to flatten the warm plasticine-like mixture, the patti to cut the lac. I am invited into their home, their lives, to experience the way they work, to play with the lac, creating what I want.Mohammed talks of going to Milan in 2017, with the Export Promotion Council for Handicrafts. Wahan bahut kadr karte hain craft ka [they hold craft in high regard there], he says, remembering how the people who watched him work later used the lac disks to make oversize pendants and masks.

These were not those of traditional craftspeople, but of artists of different types. He is now working to hive off this business on to an app called Rooftop  on-demand virtual activity with 100 passionate influencers and users who can unlock value.Culture karmaThe experience has been organised by Jaipur-based Rajasthan Studio, which works to connect craftspeople with customers  those with passion to those with an interest, as Kartik Gaggar, who founded the brand in January 2019, says. Currently, they do 27 experiences across Jaipur, Udaipur, and Jodhpur, with Kota and Bikaner up next, spread across craft forms like blue pottery, miniature painting, and puppet making (which is my first experience of the day).There are 103 forms of craft to be explored across the state, so Rajasthan is an obvious place to start. We are a destination management company, where the artist is the hero, says Gaggar, who is hoping to grow the brand pan India. The highest priced experiences, at 6,000, are meenakari and fresco painting; some like sandalwood art are at 3,500; while many like writing on rice grains are at 2,500. Each is meant for a small group, usually no larger than four people.Gaggar believes the future of travel will be about learning, experiencing, and exploring. And with Indians being their mainstay  before the lockdown and after  it is all the more reason to put karigars and the Indian craft story in the spotlight.Craft driveGaggar is a chartered accountant who has worked in consulting, and experimented with organising experiential trips within Mumbai. Later, his training in PricewaterhouseCoopers taught him processes, so he spent three-and-a-half years studying the market worldwide. The turning point that solidified his method was when he and his wife took a trip to Seattle and a rower who had won an Olympic gold showed them the city through its waterways.Back in Jaipur, where his family is from, he began documenting specific craft forms, beginning with information found on Google. The deeper I go, the more I feel I dont know anything, he says, adding that in time the company aims to look at museum records and those kept by royal families. From the craftspeople he has learnt patience, making the experiences as slow as possible. Across the world, there is no blueprint of how to sell folk art, he says.His vision meshes with that of puppeteer Pappuji, whom Id visited earlier  that the craftsperson does not have to stand on the street peddling his wares. As Pappuji chisels the jaw of the raja puppet and smooths the edges off the face of the rani, he asks that people come to his house to buy rather than visit a shop.

The President then announced Telangana Governor Tamilisai Soundararajan would hold additional charge in Bedis place.Bedi, whose storied career as an IPS officer made her an inspiration to women across India, earned few fans during her tenure in Puducherry. From the get-go, the elected government headed by Narayanasamy clashed with the Lt Governors office over everything from a scheme to provide free rice (she favoured a direct benefit transfer) to the implementation of a helmet rule. The CM accused her of running a parallel government and instructing officials directly.Based on this, the Congress has held multiple protests against her, and last week Narayansamy met the President demanding her removal. While her exit may appear a win for the Congress, her presence was also an issue around which the ruling party campaigned for five years. Narayanasamy has successfully blamed her interference for the stalling of every development scheme.Even local BJP workers were unhappy with her performance, believing the party was adversely impacted by the perceived mood against her. In fact, the renewed demand of political parties for statehood was built off perceived discontent of the public at her style of functioning.Interestingly, Bedis removal came just months before the Assembly polls even as the Congress has lost at least four key leaders to the BJP. The ruling alliances tally in the House is now equal to that of the Opposition and Soundararajan has asked the CM to prove his governments majority on February 22. Having inducted the heavyweight erstwhile Congress leaders, the BJP sees itself having a fighting chance in the UT.A cynics view may be that in the event of a close poll verdict, the BJP might prefer a L-G more in tune with local politicsSoundararajan is a former Tamil BJP chiefto be in a position to weigh in. Whatever the cause for Bedis removal, ironically it may only be Narayanasamy who misses her, especially during the upcoming campaign.",Curious timing of Kiran Bedi’s exit,RICE

Instead, the large corporates who make large profits from agribusiness must be forced to share their surplus with the primary producers, AIKS general secretary Hannan Mollah told journalists.Basmati farmers get paid 18-30 per kg for their crop. The Adani groups Fortune Special Basmati rice is sold at 208 per kg. Some brands sell in the range of 700 to 2,200 per kg. Those who make such immense profits must share some of it with primary producers. Why not pay 40 per kg to the farmer? There will still be plenty of profits left over, he said.Mr. Mollah argued that the Centres role was to enact a law stipulating that no one  neither government nor private players  could buy farm produce below the MSP rate. We are not saying that the government should purchase everything. We are not stubborn. We understand that no government can pay that kind of money. Let the government buy 15%, [which is] needed for the public distribution system anyway. But the remaining 85% should also be bought at a remunerative price for the farmer, he said.He alleged that the only reason the government was not willing to consider this proposal was because it had sold its soul to its corporate cronies to ensure that they were guaranteed maximum profits at the cost of the farmer. Every time we raised the MSP issue during the 10 rounds of talks, the government would say later, later, he alleged.The AIKS refuted the Prime Ministers assertion that the protesting farmers were anti-reforms, and simply want to cling to the status quo. We do not want the status quo situation where farmers are committing suicide, where 94% of farmers do not get MSP ... We are in favour of pro-farmer reforms, not pro-corporate reforms, said Mr. Mollah.He urged reforms to create and strengthen non-profit social cooperatives for farmers so that they were able to undertake value additions such as agro-processing and marketing themselves. This would help minimise the differences between producer and consumer prices, he said. A legislative framework to encourage contract farming between farmers and cooperative institutions would also be a welcome reform, Mr. Mollah added.",Make private traders pay MSP to farmers: All India Kisan Sabha,RICE

There are now good roads to reach the villages here. One has to see to believe it, says the native of Phatu Seneri, one of the three villages in the Kotia panchayat which has been grabbing headlines ever since Andhra Pradesh administration shocked Odisha by holding rural elections on February 13.Hareka credits Odisha government for the good work. They have put in the hard work to give us connectivity which is key, he says. In the same breath, he appreciates Andhra for sending in 35 kg PDS rice home, without fail.Odisha government provides just 5 kg per head in two months interval, he says. That primarily sums up the moods in the 21 villages where a border dispute is raging again.Caught between two states for over seven decades, the villagers are in a dilemma. Amidst a legal wrangle, they are now getting attention from both the states.Welfare programmes and infrastructure development are picking up pace. It was not the case till three years back. When the then Vizianagaram Collector launched Janmabhoomi scheme in January 2018, Odisha was served a rude shock because Kotia had remained far beyond the administrative sight.The road leading to KotiaForced to up the ante, it rolled out development programmes. In the ongoing phase, focus has been on development of health, education, drinking water, communication and public transport system.The State government has already spent Rs 19 crore for construction of roads, bridges, market yards, bank services, government bus service, mobile connectivity, a 10-bed hospital, official staff quarters, revenue and panchayat office as well as police station out of its Rs 150 crore special package it had announced.The development notwithstanding, villagers remain undecided. Thats because the Andhra administration appears to have its nose ahead so far as the race for pumping in the goodies is concerned.Villagers say the neighbouring state provides old age pension of Rs 2,250 per head per month whereas Odisha pays only Rs 500. If children from Kotia want to join Andhra schools, the government releases Rs 15,000 to bank account of mothers, besides providing school uniform, shoes, books and notes.Odishas provision of school uniforms, shoes and free textbooks do not seem alluring enough though it pays Rs 240 to girls and Rs 180 to boys from SC and ST categories towards yearly stipend for Class VI onwards besides mid day meal for all categories of students. Andhra provides Rs 13,000 for land development to those having forest land patta.Bisu Gamel, a resident of Talganjipadar village says Odisha brought in electricity to Kotia, Ganjeipadar and Tala Paniki where energy charges are collected but AP provides electricity for free to 15 disputed villages.Some villages like Mohipani and Simageda still rue the absence of power. Observers say an important factor ignored by Odisha government is the fact that more than 60 per cent population in Kotia belongs to Dora community while the rest are tribals.Divided into three categories - Konda Dora, Numa Dora and Moka Dora - the community is given tribal status by Andhra whereas Odisha considers them SEBC which deprives them of welfare programmes.The recent overtures of AP appear to have made Koraput administration determined to develop Kotia as a model panchayat.With the existing programmes, the administration has a roadmap to strengthen livelihood support for Kotia through different projects. There is also need to create cultural and literary bonding with people, says Collector Abdaal Akhtar.He also plans to generate employment opportunity through tourism development. Social activist Pratap Choudhury feels Odisha must form at least three panchyats for the 21 villages for smooth administration and implementation of welfare programmes. The local officials must visit regularly to bring back the confidence, he adds.",Odisha presses on amid Kotia conundrum,RICE

This is not just a business, but its our passion project, asserts Abhipsa who quit her job at a call centre to start this kitchen with her mother. And the passion surely transcends into the delicious food that they make. Specialising in Marwari cuisine, giving healthy twists to regular food is what sets them apart.For instance, the Rajkachori that I had was made in fresh, crisp poori stuffed with dhokla made with spinach and topped with sev, coriander and tamarind chutney and curd. The green dhokla gave the chaat a splash of colour and a unique twist to this street-food. Abhipsa says, Some people do not prefer aloo, so we add dhokla.Abhipsa ans Nirmala TulshanThe Marwari lunch that followed was a simple meal that had the quintessential tastes of ghar ka khana, without any added colours, preservatives or extra oil. The paneer badami was not spicy, was a little sweet in light tomato gravy topped with slivers of almonds. It paired well with hara bhara parathas made of wheat. The nutritious rotis were soft and thankfully, not oily. The meal also had a mix of dal chawal  typical tuvar daal in a flavourful tadka mixed with white rice.Two types of home-made pickles  one with red chillies and the other made with potatoes and green peas!

(Express photo by Amit Mehra)Chief Ministers raised several demands and flagged their concerns at the sixth Governing Council virtual meeting of Niti Aayog chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday. The Sunday Express takes a look at some of the suggestions.Odisha: Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik said it is high time that the country gets out of election mode and allows state governments to function.Elections are an essential feature of democracy. However, the hallmark of a mature democracy is that once elected, governments are meant to work for people, beyond party lines. Its high time that we, as a country, have serious introspection on whether we are able to do the same. Every crime is being politicised, every action of an elected government is being seen from a political angle, he said while describing the current environment as one of the biggest threats to the pace of development and peace in the country.The Chief Minister also called for serious deliberations to proceed on the demand for womens reservation in the Lok Sabha and State Assemblies. He also pushed for committed and targeted action by the NITI Aayog in regions that are neglected and populations that are vulnerable in areas such as malnutrition, connectivity, sex ratio imbalances.Arguing that the existing pattern of examinations will eliminate merit in the long run and deny justice to lakhs of children in rural areas, Patnaik also pitched for a revaluation of the examination pattern for UPSC, NEET and JEE. History will remember us on what our response has been on critical issues affecting our people and the country, rising above political considerations, he said.Rajasthan: Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot urged the Prime Minister to declare the Eastern Rajasthan Canal Project (ERCP) as a national project.Gehlot said while Rajasthan is the largest state in the country with 10 per cent of the land mass, it still has water scarcity as it has been part of the desert.Gehlot said Prime Minister Modi had himself promised to declare ERCP as a national project during his visits to Rajasthan. He said the estimated cost of the ERCP plan is around Rs 40,000 crore and it is not possible to be borne by the state government alone. There are 16 such projects which are national projects in states. If in place of 16 projects, there are 17, then I feel this project can be completed on priority, said Gehlot. Under this, both irrigation could be done as well as drinking water will also be availablethis is your promise and I am reminding you of it, said Gehlot.Bihar: Chief Minister Nitish Kumar said the Centre should adopt one nation, one electricity rate policy. He also asked the Centre to increase the credit deposit ratio of Bihar. He said the money of Bihar deposited in Bihars banks often goes to developed states. He reiterated the demand for special category status to Bihar.Karnataka: Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa requested Prime Minister Narendra Modi to declare the Upper Bhadra Project and Upper Krishna Project irrigation projects as national projects. He also requested approval for six proposals worth Rs 6,673 crore for modernisation of canals and additional grants for river diversion projects. The PM was requested to set up a mechanism to fast-track disposal of cases in courts because infrastructure projects tend to get stalled due to litigation and environmental protests.Chhattisgarh: Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel requested the Prime Minister to provide additional economic resources to Chhattisgarh, saying that a special package is expected for industrial development. He said the state is deprived of coal blocks despite having large reserves of mineral coal. After 2014, the royalty rates of minerals have not increased, and this has caused irreparable damage to the state government, he said.Baghel also requested not to disinvest the Nagarnar Steel Plant of Bastar. He urged the Prime Minister to provide GST compensation, the amount of additional levy on coal, the remaining amount of rice in the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana under the PDS, as well as the states total amount of Rs 13,440 crore as soon as possible and to keep the amount of excise duty to be paid to the state, as it is.Madhya Pradesh: Stating that Madhya Pradesh is committed to achieve the target or GDP of 10 lakh crore this year to make India an economy of $ 5 trillion by 2024, Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan emphasised that the six-point agenda of police commission will be given practical form. Initiative will be undertaken in the private sector to develop forest and solar energy in the degraded forest area spread over 30 lakh hectares in the state to monetise assets in a scientific manner.Calling the three new farm laws revolutionary, Chouhan said the state has already started working to become a self-reliant Madhya Pradesh, in line with PM Modis vision for a self-reliant India. He said the Governing Council of NITI Aayog is an ideal platform for interaction between the Centre as well as states.Goa: Chief Minister Pramod Sawant sought the Centres help in bringing about an amendment to the mining laws, especially for Goa. He also urged the Centre to shift towards vertical mobility for execution of its infrastructure projects in small states with limited land availability.Sawant said only 30 percent land is available for development activities in Goa and central projects have a huge land requirement . He said, We will get relief if vertical mobility is brought about in these projects.Our efforts are going on in full swing towards central government projects like Mopa International Airport, national highway, double tracking of rail. You will have our full support, Sawant said. The three projects have faced opposition in Goa.Mining activity was banned in Goa following a Supreme Court order in 2018. This has had a big impact on the states economy and on jobs. I request you to grant us some relief in mining activity, Sawant said at the meeting. He also sought necessary amendments in the Coastal Zone Regulations for sand mining.Assam: Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal said that considering the paucity of land in the state, the NITI Aayog must give special relaxation to Assam for setting up of any mega-project.Jharkhand: Chief Minister Hemant Soren asked the Centre to consider the proposal for the demand of Sarna Adivasi Dharma Code after it was passed in the Jharkhand Assembly.

Kaipad rice received the Geographical Indication tag in 2014.From just 5,000 kg in 2019 to 20,000 kg this year, paddy procured from just four panchayats is a huge leap, said M.K. Sukumaran, secretary of the society. Still, the society is not able to meet the demand thanks to insufficient stock, he added.Mr. Sukumaran said when Kaipad farming was launched, it was limited to around 200 acres, but it has grown to a large area, and cultivation is now done in over 2500 acres.Kaipad farming is done at Ezhome, Cherukkunnu, Pattuvam, Cheruthazham and Ramanthali panchayats.Mr. Sukumaran said that besides the traditional seed varieties of Kuthiru and Orkayama, new varieties like Ezhome 1, Ezhome 2, Ezhome 3, Ezhome 4, and Mithila were introduced last year.Labour shortage and huge production cost were the major issues facing Kaipad farming. Making matters worse, mangroves have come up in areas that were left idle for several years. It is an issue of concern for farmers, as the Forest Department has not granted permission to remove mangroves citing environmental issues, he informed.However, the society has been able to enhance production with the support of the Regional Agricultural Research Station (RARS), Pilicode. GI-tagged Kaipad rice is now sold in Kasaragod, Kannur, Kozhikode, Thrissur and Ernakulam districts. The sale is through ecoshops, horticorp, and VFPCK outlets.Mr. Sukumaran said the procured paddy has huge export potential. A number of companies and traders have approached the society for export of the rice variety. However, the society is not able to meet their demand, as it has stock only up to August, he added.T.

""I want the war to stop so we can go back to how we were ...

In 2018 and 2019, the UN prevented famine due to a well-funded aid appeal. But in 2020, the world body only received just over half the $3.4 billion it needed.""What is happening to the people of Yemen is unimaginably cruel.

However, people in the district, who mostly depend on agriculture and daily wages, are waiting for industrial growth to brighten their lives.With the State bracing for Assembly elections on April 6, the district too is gearing up for battle. The controversial Chennai-Salem eight-lane expressway project and infrastructure woes are the issues that would dominate electoral domain this time around. Of the eight Assembly constituencies falling under the district, the ruling AIADMK represents three  Kalasapakkam, Arni and Cheyyar, while DMK represents Chengam, Tiruvannamalai, Kilpennathur, Polur and Vandavasi.The Rs 10,000 crore access-controlled Chennai-Salem eight-lane expressway is expected to significantly weigh in during the polls. The farming community in the district, from about 90 agrarian villages, have been up in arms against the project from the very beginning. Farmers have taken a firm stand that they will vote for the party which genuinely promises to work for stalling the project, says S Abiraman, the convenor of the Movement against Eight Lane Expressway.He notes, Not only farmers who have to forfeit their precious lands, but even others staying in the villages through which the road has been proposed, will be affected. Inadequate infrastructure such as poor rail and road connectivity to major cities of the State and unavailability of marketing and cold storage facilities for farmers are other serious concerns. Several years have passed after the Villupuram-Katpadi broad gauge rail link was laid.The route holds the key to connecting central and southern districts to northern parts and neighbouring Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka. Yet, adequate number of trains are not operated, rues Pasarai Babu, a political activist. The Puducherry-Krishnagiri national highway project, passing through Tiruvannamalai, remains only on paper. If it fructifies, the road connectivity will help commuters, traders and farmers to travel/ferry goods to far off places such as Bengaluru, where large consignments of flowers are transported to, he notes. The Tiruvannamalai ring road project too has been dragging on for long.Despite devotees thronging the town in lakhs during the Karthigai Deepam festival, amenities are below-par. The miseries of the agrarian community too are expected to grab attention during the polls. From reviving the groundnut oil manufacturing unit run by the Tamil Nadu Cooperative Oil Seeds Growers Federation (closed in 2001 citing loss), establishing cold storage facilities for agricultural produce, setting up of a rice research centre and a silk park at Arni - where a large number of rice mills operate and silk sarees are woven  to desilting of Sathanur dam, the pleas of the farmers are yet to be fulfilled.

As distressing scenes were witnessed from across the State with farmers threatening to commit suicide if their produce are not procured at the authorised mandis, the House panel headed by senior Congress member Narasingha Mishra urged the government to direct the department to renew tokens that have lapsed due to mismanagement at market yards.The prevailing crisis is an offshoot of a nexus between mandi functionaries who are under the administrative control of Cooperation department and rice millers, the committee noted and suggested neither rice millers nor their agents be allowed to enter paddy purchase centres (PPCs).The committee further recommended to install CCTV cameras at all the PPCs to ensure transparency in mandi management and prevent entry of agents of rice millers and private traders into the centres. The house panel suggested the government to assign the job of buying paddy from those farmers who could not sell their produce to State appointed agencies, to Food Corporation of India (FCI). As per law, if a farmer is not able to sell his produce to any of the State government agencies, it is the responsibility of the FCI to purchase it, Mishra told the TNIE.The committee also suggested the government to open mandis in gram panchayats having requisite infrastructure in the next kharif season.During a recent debate on farmers problems in the context of mandi irregularities, Minister for Food Supplies and Consumer Welfare Minister Ranendra Pratap Swain put the blame on farmers whose tokens had lapsed as they failed to bring their paddy to the mandis on the specified dates. However, the fact remains that majority of small and marginal farmers are not getting a chance to sell their paddy while some favoured few are getting multiple chances to dispose of their stocks.",Paddy procurement: House panel suggests renewal of lapsed tokens,RICE

However, we seldom find people here adding it as a staple in their meals, notes Dhanalakshmi R, dietician, Rainbow Childrens Hospital, talking about the underground veggie variant.Gut healthAvailable at stores in the local markets and priced anything between Rs 25-Rs 30 (per 500 g), turnips are packed with fibrous goodness and can help in aiding weight loss and relieving intestinal problems. A cup of raw turnip has about 2.75 g of dietary fibre in it.This helps reduce pressure and inflammation in the colon, explains the medical practitioner, adding that the presence of high dietary fibres can also enable making bowel movements easier. The gut function is important in getting rid of toxins through bile and stool and the properties in turnips aids in maintaining a healthy digestive tract, she says.Aids in weight lossWith a high water content and low-calorie count, the consumption of the non-starchy vegetable makes people fuller for a longer period, aiding in weight loss. A 100 g of turnip has only 1.39 g of carbohydrates. So, it can be consumed by all and especially those who are on a journey to manage their weight, she says.Reduces blood pressureAccording to a study in the British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology, foods containing (read turnips) high dietary nitrates were projected to benefit the health of the blood vessels. Rich in potassium (about 300 mg), it helps in lowering the bodys blood pressure by releasing sodium from the body. This helps the arteries dilate, she shares.For a long time, a healthy intake of cruciferous vegetables like cauliflower, cabbage and our star of the day, turnip, have been associated with a lower risk of cancer. Dhanalakshmi supports this link. The presence of a sulphur-rich compound called sulforaphane, a phytochemical can neutralise toxins. This plays an integral part in promoting anti-cancer activities in the body, she explains.Studies of a kind of indole in turnips, arvelxin, also suggest that it blocks pro-inflammatory compounds such as nitric oxide, aiding in reducing inflammation caused by diseases including arthritis, cancer, and high blood pressure.Immunity boosterBesides its wide profile of benefits, the vegetable is also rich in vitamin C, which is important for building and maintaining collagen, the component which provides structure to the skin and hair. Consuming an adequate amount of turnips can benefit the immune system and reduce hair loss prompted by iron deficiency.It can be added twice or thrice in a week in a meal, she shares.

Anwardeen, Additional Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (Coimbatore Circle) and Field Director of ATR.Arockiaraj Xavier, Deputy Field Director of ATR and District Forest Officer of Pollachi Forest Division, oversaw the training given to the elephant.Now the elephant is obeying commands. It will be stationed at the Varagaliar camp as of now, said N. Naveen Kumar, forest range officer of Ulandy forest range of ATR.Before its capture, the tusker had killed three persons from Navamalai and Arthanaripalayam. It also damaged several houses and shops in search of soft food items.

2021-03-04,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/persevering-with-our-martian-fantasies/article33983386.ece,"Unresolved questions and the hope of finding life on the planet have intrigued experts for decadesThe recent NASA mission of putting its latest rover, Perseverance, on Mars  a breathtaking technological feat  has once again ignited our Martian fantasies and the fascination with discovering alien life forms. Ingrained in our minds is the idea that Mars holds some sort of wherewithal in the innumerable crannies within its rocks to support traces of life. The question that whether humans will be able to make use of even such modicum of habitability to utilise its landscape is also significant, assuming that we will be able to deal with the moral question of whether to cordon off the planet from human interference in case we do find indigenous life forms there.Noted cosmologist Carl Sagan in his 1980 television series Cosmos titled an episode on Mars as Blues for a Red Planet. As with Earth, blue is the colour radiated by water, and Earth, therefore, presents itself as a pale blue dot to orbiters and astronauts from outer space. Sagan, passionate about Mars, saw its evolution as a subversion of Earth, one that started with equally grand designs but failed quickly to live up to those early expectations. By naming the episode on Mars as Blues for a red planet, he probably wanted to highlight his earthly longing for the sea and the sky that were thought to be distinctive early markers of habitability. Thus, singing the blues for a dried-up red planet, Sagan, who was brought up on science fantasies by Edgar Rice Burroughs and H.G. Wells about Martian invaders of Earth, may have wanted to signal a lasting tribute to a possible glorious Martian life of the past.Editorial | Time and perseverance: On NASAs rover on MarsThe Martian science fantasy of the 19th century was an offshoot of reports of canals on Mars. Nineteenth-century Italian astronomer Giovanni Schiaparelli had claimed that he saw water-filled canali, or channels, on the red planet. This topic assumed greater significance when a businessman-turned-astronomer, Percival Lowell, reported similar observations. After painstaking telescopic work that was set up on the desert of Arizona, Lowell, after years of observation, talked about hundreds of canals on the equatorial region of Mars. He propagated the idea that these were engineered structures used for channelising water from the polar regions to meet the requirements of a dehydrating planet, somewhat eerily reminiscent of a bleak hothouse Earth, triggered by the runaway greenhouse effect.A backup planet?Historically, Mars has always been depicted as a backup site for humanity to migrate to; it is now once again being promoted as such by avant-garde entrepreneurs like Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk. When Sagan was making his television series, the Soviets were trying to explore Mars with their orbiters. Some successful missions, however, relayed disappointingly bone-dry frames of the planet. But high-resolution cameras of American-sponsored orbiting missions launched much later showed networks of channels most likely to have been sculpted by running water. Thus, modern research informs us that Schiaparelli and Lowell were not completely off the mark in their interpretations, though Lowell was wrong in attributing those morphological features as being engineered by intelligent beings. A few weeks before his death, Sagan recorded a moving message for future explorers: Maybe were on Mars because of the magnificent science that can be done there  the gates of the wonder world are opening in our time...More surprises, as well as disappointments, were in store. In 2005, the Mars Express satellite found evidence of clays that may have formed after solid rocks were exposed to water, as analogous examples of Earths rock inventory would testify. But some scientists were not easily convinced as their Martian climate models failed to predict temperatures high enough for continuous generation of rain to have liquid water on the surface. So, it was concluded that any water on Mars would have been locked up in its polar regions with brief periods of melting and flooding that carve out the valley networks. Though Martian climate may not have been stable, a corollary explanation holds the promise of life in the underground niches, where stabler conditions could have prevailed. Such examples of subsurface life are plenty in Earths environment.Also Read NASA releases first audio from Mars, video of Perseverance rover landingThe predecessor of Perseverance, the Curiosity rover, which has been surveying and testing the Martian surface since 2012, added some interesting findings. Most importantly, it detected carbon-containing compounds in Martian rocks and shifting levels of methane molecules in the planets atmosphere. Two papers published in the journal Science in 2018 concluded that these findings support the possibility of the existence of microbial life. Inge Loes ten Kate, an astrobiologist at the Utrecht University, in a commentary on the papers, said the question of whether life might have originated or existed on Mars is a lot more opportune now that we know that organic molecules were present on its surface.Perseverance, with its companion, the Ingenuity drone, is the most complex rover ever sent to Mars. It has now reached its destination, the 45-km-wide Jezero Crater, where an old lake supposedly existed. The rover will roam around this crater and sample carbonate rocks that might host algal mats called stromatolites, as we find in the oldest carbonate rocks on Earth.Also Read Decoded: the secret message on Mars rovers giant parachuteStill a mysteryBut as a geologist, I will remain sceptical until I see some hard evidence on biogenic remains. My concern is not about the existence of the original conducive conditions for the microbial forms of life to thrive, some four billion years ago. It may have been a reality. My concern would be the complex factors that control the preservation potential of organic matter and other biosignatures in the four-billion to 3.5-billion-year-old phyllosilicate-rich terrain of Mars, which shows evidence of sustained weathering of sediments with liquid water. Like the rusty red and iron oxide-rich lateritic soil we see in the tropical regions of Earth, the weathered soil formation of Mars may be a poor medium to preserve biogenic signatures. That could be one reason why the Perseverance rover is programmed to seek carbonate rocks within the Jezero crater, where the pristine nature of the original biological and climatic signals is expected to be preserved better. We still do not understand the mechanisms of the formation of carbonates on Mars and whether they are comparable to Earths processes, which are often related to oceanic settings.Also Read Scientists decode how Mars may have lost its atmosphereIf the search for evidence of life on Mars is successful, it will prove that life is a ubiquitous feature of the universe, and that will have momentous repercussions on how we see ourselves in the overall scheme of things. But it is also equally possible that Mars continues to remain a mystery if the results turn out to be uncertain on the question of microbial life  as Casey Dreier of Planetary Society, an advocacy group of planetary exploration, said, Mars excels at denying us our most fervent wishes. From not fitting into the epicycles of Ptolemy, to lacking the canals of Lowell, to supplying no organic material (yet) to the Curiosity rover team, the reality of Mars has consistently irritated humanity throughout history.The author is an adjunct professor at the National Institute of Advanced Studies, Bengaluru",Persevering with our Martian fantasies,RICE

The bench agreed to do so provided he did social service. States special counsel A Sanjeev Kumar readily agreed to this and assured the court that the officers would serve some needy sections like orphaned children or poor kids. The bench posted the case to April 7. Though the current appeal was filed by Patil, we will request the court to apply this verdict to the other contemnor (Sandhya Rani) also, the state counsel said.The court in its previous order had ordered Patil and Sandhya Rani to restore supply of paddy to the mill owner for the purpose of custom milling and supply the same later to the Telangana State Civil Supplies Corporation. The court also took a serious view of efforts to subvert its order.It all started when the civil supplies officials booked a case against the miller following discrepancies at his unit. They punished him by seizing half of the stock at the mill. They also stopped paddy supply to the mill and blacklisted his mill. The aggrieved miller then approached the court and questioned the punishment without even proving the case against him. He also told the court that several mills in the district were facing similar cases, but none of them was blacklisted.I was singled out and was subjected to double jeopardy, he contended. The court agreed with him and directed the officials to restore paddy supply to the mill. It was after this order that the officials still tried to blacklist the miller. A single judge bench of the high court then saw an unwarranted design in this and convicted Patil and Sandhya.",Serve needy to avoid jail: Telangana HC to babus,RICE

But, if you had to pick just one, itd probably be strife maketh a man. And his thallu vandi-to-global restaurant chain story too. The man behind the success that is SS Hyderabad Biryani would not be where he is now, if not for the fire that ravaged his fathers poultry factory and changed the nature of their lives overnight.Forced to become enterprising, it was his mothers culinary skills born of the experience generations of her family had gained in the palace of Mysuru that Abdul turned to. In the summer of 1995, three years after the fire, after a prolonged period of search and salvation and a succession of kind encounters, he set up his first thallu vandi selling chicken pakoda.It took another three years for him to move to the biryani business. The kind where theres one man with a katta pai full of heavy biryani packages, delighting the hungry merchants of Richi Street and ravenous swimmers near Marina with meaty goodness. In the years that followed, he did move on to take a day job in the marketing world, while also handling party orders for his biryani that had by then garnered a solid word-of-mouth reputation.It was in 2003 that Abduls biryani enterprise found a mortar-and-brick home in Perambur. And there has been no looking back since. While the going had certainly not been easy by any means, trust in his mothers recipe that he had worked hard to master, faith in God and earnest eagerness in doing his part in the scheme of things and doing it well at that is what has kept him going, he says. Heres an excerpt from the conversation.Biryani might have still been a novelty when you started out. But what has made you thrive in the business for so many years, amid such competition?I was a field worker from the start; thats what helped me survive the competition. When I was selling biryani in Richi Street, people did come back to my biryani master to get him to make the same food for them. But it wasnt the same. My mother used to say You be there through the entire food-making process. Make use of what I gave you, what the cook offered and what you saw fit in both and make a distinct recipe. No one should know what you do to make the biryani taste this way.But it should be unique. Even in those days, I used to give a sufficient quantity of rice in each biryani packet. Because people should bless you from the heart after eating and not feel cheated. I would pack rice till it looks enough to my eyes; you take it in your hands and it will feel heavy. People began buying one packet for two. This made my biryani stand out. Even today, there is no measure; people still buy one packet for two.You have had many principles and ideologies define your work. But, what stands out the most?When I spoke at an event in Bangkok recently, they asked me what is quality to me. Others would say it is in the key ingredients, flavours... But thats not it. Its working in such a way that you know god is watching. Because the customer wouldnt know what I put in the food when I serve it. But He is watching. And thats the challenge I present to all restaurants. At least after this pandemic, I ask them to give up adding colours and Ajinomoto (MSG) to food. Today, some chef or master might do it to a stranger; but, the same thing is being done to his kin by someone else. This is how it works.Beyond good food, what would you like your business to stand for?The idea is to give. In our big outlets in the city, we plan to provide sanitary napkin dispensers in the womens restrooms; so that it comes in handy during emergencies. Besides this, we plan to introduce a food bank at every one of our outlets. On my part, I will provide ten packets of biryani. Those in need can approach the counter and they will be offered food from this bank. The public can contribute to this effort too, adding the food they can to the bank. In other restaurants, they will give away food to the needy only after they have attended to the customers. Here, its the needy we address first.CHICKEN FRY THE SS WAYWhile all of SS Hyderabad Biryanis outlets have maintained their standard menu with biryani,tandoori and Indo-Chinese food on offer, the new outlet at Royapuram has stepped off this well-established mould. Shaped like a container unit (though youre not likely to notice it with all the decor), this outlet features a SS special food court on the ground floor and a small party hall above it.

Thus, we have enough grounds to completely deny the implementation of these black laws in Punjab.Yet why, in this case, are we just amending the Central laws and sending them back, when we know very well that all these amendments will not be implemented until either approved by the President of India or if the Central laws are first withdrawn? By means of mere amendments, we are going to the Constitutional head, who may not choose to help us, and maybe is not a good position to be in at this decisive critical juncture. Instead, why not use the democratic power given to us by 3 crore Punjabis by honouring their aspirations? said Mr. Sidhu.Mr. Sidhu, a legislator of the ruling Congress party in Punjab, addressing a press conference here, said that to help farmers get MSP, there should be an expansion of procurement beyond wheat and rice in the State. He added farmers cannot diversify until MSP is provided and theres assured procurement.To begin with, Punjab can procure pulses and oilseeds through Markfed or PunSup on MSP. Punjab imports pulses and edible oils for our own consumption. Keep aside the money we use to import pulses and edible oil from outside and utilise it to procure from Punjab itself. State Corporations can further process oil seeds and market them outside Punjab... In future, Punjab can expand MSP and assurance of procurement to vegetables and fruits.

It will benefit not only the labour as an increment in their daily wages but also help the farmer as an agricultural labour subsidy and ease their [the farmers] financial burden.

Most of the marine species that recorded prior to construction of the barrage has now disappeared. They have been replaced by freshwater and estuarine species, according to a group of researchers from the Kerala University of Fisheries and Ocean Studies (KUFOS), Kochi.The research paper was jointly published by K. Roshni, C. R. Renjithkumar, Rajeev Raghavan, K. Ranjeet of the university.The barrage, which was constructed in the middle of the lake in 1975, has a length of 1,402 metre. It prevents seawater from entering the low-lying paddy fields in the southern part of the estuary, enabling double cropping of rice and ensuring drinking water to nearby areas.Every year, the barrage is closed for three months from mid December to mid March. At times, the closure period will be extended up to May to prevent saline water intrusion.The unscientific management of the barrage over the past 45 years has hydrologically transformed the estuary into three distinct zones with distinct salinity regime and diverse physiography and hydrography, they noted.Fish sampling was carried out in each zone from June 2015 to May 2016, during monsoon, post-monsoon and pre-monsoon periods. Since the saline stretch of the estuary had been reduced considerably due to hydrological modifications, most migratory species are trapped near the barrage and caught in local fisheries, concluded the researchers.The researchers have suggested management interventions including allowing free movement of migratory fish by setting up fish passes during closure of the barrage. Though the restoration of the estuary to its original form will be impossible, management measures like periodic removal of silt, curbing the inflow of pollutants, restricting further developmental activities and continuous monitoring of the ecosystem could help revive and maintain the biodiversity and ecosystem services it supports, they suggested.",Fish species in Vembanad have declined by 40%: study,RICE

(Express File)The Punjab Vidhan Sabha Thursday passed a resolution unanimously asking the state government to take effective steps to raise the underground water level to save the state from turning into barren land.Speaker Rana K P Singh also announced the formation of a committee to look into ways and means of optimum utilisation of water resources and suggest steps to re-charge groundwater.The Speaker suggested that the principal secretary of the water resources department should assist the committee. The committees report will have to be submitted within three months. The Speaker made the suggestion after Congress MLA Kuldeep Singh Vaid suggested the same while participating in the debate on the deteriorating groundwater table in the state.The passing of the resolution was preceded by a discussion on the water table of Punjab where all members, cutting across party lines, expressed their dismay at the fast-receding underground water levels and made several suggestions ranging from diversification of crops to various methods to conserve water while sowing paddy.Only a handful of Congress MLAs were present in the House when the resolution was passed. Notable among the absentees was Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh, who is also the agriculture minister.Earning more from Rajasthan land than PunjabFinance Minister Manpreet Badal said that if anyone knows how to practice agriculture, it is the farmer of Rajasthan who faces a shortage of water. I earn more from my land in Rajasthan than Punjab, he added.Stating that water was available only in finite quantities, he added that a big myth was being propagated in the country that Punjab has surplus water. Five hundred kilo water is required to grow one kg of paddy while 3,000 kilo water is required to grow one kg of wheat.Punjab is not selling wheat and paddy but it is selling its water at the rate of one paise per litre, said the minister.Manpreet Badal also gave the example of Israel, which nationalised its water resources immediately after independence in 1948. They took water out of politics and out of the hands of politicians, he said.The finance ministers suggestion that the Centre should take over research activities related to agriculture was opposed by opposition MLAs who said that the Centre was already encroaching upon the powers of the state and there was no need to cede more power to it.Manpreet Badal then clarified that he did not mean that research activities should be taken out of Punjab, but that the Centre should fund it because the states had no money for it.What is cooperation department doing?An embarrassing situation developed during the debate when Congress MLA from Kapurthala Rana Gurjit Singh questioned Cooperation Minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa over why the Cane Research Institute was shifted from Jalandhar to Gurdaspur.He also argued that the cooperation department was doing little to increase the yield of the sugarcane crop and that initiatives taken by his sugar mill were producing more results on ground that the cooperation department of the state.Arguing that there should be a discussion on why recharging of ground water was not taking place in Punjab, Rana Gurjit said that water in villages should be treated and used for agriculture. He also said that the Direct Seeding of Rice (DSR) technology should be used for paddy sowing to save water and electricity.Diversification of crops needed, say MLAsCutting across party lines, MLAs who spoke on the resolution argued in favour of diversification of crops so as to break the wheat-paddy cycle.SAD MLA Harinderpal Singh Chandumajra said the state had 105 blocks categorised as dark zones due to depleting groundwater level and out of 138 blocks, 45 blocks were in critical condition.Maize and wheat used to be the principal crops of Punjab, but we took to paddy due to the needs of the country. Now diversification of crops is a must, he said. He criticised the Congress government for not taking advantage of the Atal Bhu Jal Yojana worth Rs 6,000 crore as the state government failed to make a presentation for staking a claim for funding.AAP MLA Kulwant Singh Pandori highlighted the increasing number of cancer cases in the Malwa region and said that in Barnala district, there is a sharp spike in of Hepatitis C cases due to contaminated ground water.Suspended AAP MLA Kanwar Sandhu said he was surprised to find out that India imported canola oil from Canada and that the growing of canola crop is banned in India.It is also sad to note that an agriculture commission was formed by Congress government some time back but its report has not yet been placed before the House. Even if the government disagrees with the recommendations of the commission, at least the contents should be debated, said Sandhu.Commenting that the chief minister should have been present in the House during this important debate, Leader of Opposition Harpal Singh Cheema said that illegal mining has caused widespread damage to river beds.

The stalks are green and tall, and wave out to me cheerily when I am anywhere around it. I get its fragrance, and look at the plant a bit sorrowfully. I am sorry, but one day you are going to get added to my soup, I tell the plant.And when it does, it will greatly enhance the flavour of the soup -- just like the lemongrass that gave zest to the tom yam soup I had a few days ago. The soup had been tempered with Thai herbs, and the presence of lemongrass in it was unmistakable. I scooped out the small shrimps in the broth and, with that, started quite a memorable Oriental meal delivered by a new outlet called Azuma Kara. Based in Shahpur Jat, it delivers food with the help of Swiggy and Zomato, and its own delivery service. It is open every day of the week, from 12pm to 12am (Ph no: +917827906772)I opened the elegantly designed menu card on the net, and found that it had some of my favourite dishes. I am greatly fond of Thai food  and cant have enough of the flavours that kaffir lime leaves, lemongrass and galangal add to the cuisine. So even though the menu has Japanese and other kinds of cuisines, I stuck (more or less) to my favourite Southeast Asian region. I asked for chicken Thai herb dim sums and Prawn kaffir lime dim sums ( 390 each), char sui bao pork ( 490), Thai green curry chicken ( 680), pad Thai noodles ( 280) and lemongrass tiramisu ( 380).The tom yam prawn soup ( 340) was hearty, if a bit salty. It was pleasantly aromatic, and I had it with a crusty piece of bread. I moved on to the dim sums. The filling in the dim sum casings were robust  the chicken with Thai herbs had a nice flavour, as did the prawn with kaffir lime leaves. I then had a piece of the bao  and enjoyed the pork belly filling on spicy mayo.I am a green curry fan, and enjoyed it thoroughly. The chicken had soaked in the tastes and aromas of the herbs  especially the lemongrass  and I had it with some sticky rice and vegetable pad Thai. The icing was the lemongrass tiramisu  the herb gave the soft and cheesy dessert a delicious kick and aftertaste.The menu is an interesting one, and I am not surprised, for the chef at Azuma Kara was earlier at Blue Ginger, known for its Vietnamese cuisine, in Taj Palace. It has Vietnamese summer rolls on the menu, and the soup list includes cauliflower miso soup and Thai coconut soup (both  350). On the sushi list are rolls with mango and avocado, salmon and tuna ( 460-890). Among the interesting dishes are its one-meal bowls  spicy tuna poke bowl ( 690), tofu poke bowl ( 620), massaman pork curry with sticky rice and Asian greens ( 840) and Peruvian potatoes, wild mushroom and winter truffles ( 940).But I was happy with my dishes. In these troubled times, it was nice to get the old familiar fragrance of Thai herbs in my food. The lemongrass plant in the pot  still intact  seemed happy as well. It gave me a whiff of its heady scent when I stepped out to the balcony the next morning.(The writer is a seasoned food critic)",All things lime and lemony,RICE

A line of people, mostly women, flitted out of the supermarket every few minutes, carrying large bags laden with groceries, fruits and vegetables.This is no ordinary supermarket. Here, a 10-kilogram pack of brown matta rice costs just Rs 84, down from over Rs 450 in the open market. Half-a-litre of milk costs Rs 5, 250 grams of tea Rs 14 and a pack of six eggs comes to Rs 9. When prices of essential food items are so heavily subsidised with discounts ranging from 30% to 70%, who wouldnt line up to buy?An auto-rickshaw driver, who buys provisions from the supermarket every month, said, I have a five-member family. If I buy Rs 2000 worth of products, we can live lavishly for a month. Its a big relief for those with tight family budgets.The bhakshya-suraksha supermarket in Kizhakkambalam, started in 2017, has been one of the flagship initiatives of Twenty20, the charitable arm of garment exporter KITEX Group which has its headquarters in the village. In 2015, after running into a tussle with local politicians, Twenty20 decided to test the electoral waters. It contested in the local body elections that year, winning 17 of the 19 wards. Kizhakkambalam made headlines; it was the first time in Indias history that a corporate firm-backed party captured power of a local body.The panchayat building. The panchayat building.Fast-forward six years, Twenty20 has emerged a potent political force not just in Kizhakkambalam, but also in neighbouring panchayats of Aikkaranadu, Mazhuvannur and Kunnathunad where it came to power in last years polls. And now, it has gone a step ahead, announcing its intention to contest the Assembly elections due in April.The outfit hasnt spelled out how many seats it plans to contest, but its seen as primarily wielding influence in Kunnathunad constituency, represented by the Congress-led UDF since 2011. In what was a straight CPM-Congress fight till 2016, the entry of Twenty20 makes it an intriguing three-way contest.Sitting inside his palatial corporate office, Sabu M Jacob, the chief coordinator of Twenty20 and the managing director of Kitex Group, said, For the Assembly elections, we need to find qualified, knowledgeable people, preferably youngsters. We can make compromises if we find a retired IAS officer or retired judge as their experience will compensate for age. If we get the right person, we will contest.Sabu M Jacob interview | People are supporting Twenty20 because we are different from other partiesLocal leaders of the CPM and the Congress admit that the political equations in Kunnathunad have changed post 2020, and that their primary fight is not with each other, but with the Twenty20 candidate. At the same time, they believe they stand a chance because people vote differently in panchayat and Assembly elections.Zakeer, a local committee member of the CPM in Kizhakkambalam, said, In the local body polls, a lot of people did not want to upset the Twenty20 and vote for us as they were getting access to food subsidies. The Assembly election is a pakka political fight. It will be fought on issues like CAA-NRC and theres a large Muslim community here. They (Twenty20) dont have a stand on major political issues.He alleged the benefits of measures like subsidised food are only offered to those attending meetings and public programmes of Twenty20. Nearly 30% of the residents of Kizhakkambalam dont have access to the supermarket for the same reason, he said.In contrast, the ruling CPM-led governments disbursal of welfare pensions for different categories of people like elderly, disabled, agricultural labourers and widows transcend political affiliations, said Zakeer. One in three houses here has a member whos getting one of these pensions. They will surely vote for us, he said.Elias Karipra, the Congress local mandal president, was dismissive of the corporate partys term in power, Their rule is dictated by slavery. There is an ooruvilakku or social boycott practiced among their members. They cannot interact or engage with people of other political ideologies. They cannot even invite them to marriages/funerals at their homes.If votes of CPM do not go toward Twenty20 like in the panchayat election, we will win comfortably, said Karipra.","In Kochi suburbs, a triangular election fight in offing with a corporate twist",RICE

Not only are all our eggs in one basket but that basket is also not ours; it is outside the country, Goyal said at a meeting of relevant industry representatives and Container Corporation of India (CONCOR), the biggest player in container movement, which has decided to support indigenous manufacturing of containers for the first time in India.Today the problem we are facing of containers is affecting exports rice, wheat, sugar, all are suffering because we dont have enough containers, Goyal said. He said the volumes for export of sugar, rice and wheat alone might require half a million containers, making the point that there is sense in aiming for largescale production.Scale presents huge cost-benefit opportunities. If you produce a high-quality product, our neighbours will never be able to match it, he said, adding, How can we be dependent on other countries for such a simple thing like making containers? he said.As reported in The Indian Express on Friday, state-owned wagon manufacturer Braithwaite, and engineering behemoth Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited have received an order from CONCOR to develop and produce 1000 containers each, a first such move in India. Containers are typically imported from China the global leader in this thanks to its scale and price.

Terming the action as unfeasible, arhtiyas have vehemently opposed the new directions, decided not to cooperate the government or the FCI in updating records and have given a call for shutdown of grain markets across the state from April1. The arhtiyas point out that even after updating of land records, there will be lots of lacunas as not all the landowners are tillers and many of them have leased out their land to tenant farmers. They have also termed this move as punishment for supporting farmers struggle against new central agriculture laws.After announcing direct online payments to farmers upon purchase of grains on February 22, the FCI on Thursday asked the state food department to update land records before commencement of the rabi marketing season 2021-22 to avoid any future complications.Speaking to TOI, Federation of Arhtiyas Association Punjab president Vijay Kalra said, ""This move is not foolproof, rather it will lead to litigation or quarrels among farmers.

It was pure desperation that pushed Sebastian into a self-immolation bid in front of the Kallara Krishi Bhavan in Kottayam on February 25. Fortunately, the timely intervention of a few locals saved the farmers life. Over the past 10 days, two farmers of Upper Kuttanad have attempted suicide citing the allegedly deliberate delay by mill owners in procuring their paddy and the apathy of the Civil Supplies Corporation towards their plight.The government, however, is yet to intervene. According to the farmers, about two lakh tonnes of paddy has been lying in the open fields of Upper Kuttanad, Vechoor, Makopara, Kallara and Neendoor areas for more than one month. The Civil Supplies Corporation has tasked the rice millers to procure the rice on the condition that they will provide 68 per cent rice to the corporation. But the farmers allege the mill owners are deliberately delaying the procurement to bargain and lower the prices.Thomas, a farmer from Neendoor Makkethara, said the mill owners are demanding a huge wastage discount to the tune of 10 to 20 per cent. As the acidity of the soil in the Upper Kuttanad region is high, the yield is poor. So, they are trying to exploit us. Around 13,500 quintals of paddy have been lying in the Makkethara Kunnathukandam fields for more than 15 days.What are we supposed to do, said an aggrieved Thomas, who was the second farmer to attempt suicide in the Upper Kuttanad region over the past 10 days. He had tried to set himself ablaze on March 1, but was saved by other farmers. Sebastian, who is also the convener of Mundar Paddy Growers Forum, said he took the extreme step because his family was struggling due to mounting debts. I have availed a bank loan of Rs 3 lakh to meet agriculture expenses.Though it is a six-month interest free loan, the bank will charge 15 per cent interest if we dont close it within the stipulated period. The paddy was harvested on January 31 and a spell of summer rain could have destroyed the yield, he said, adding the mill owners and agents were deliberately delaying the procurement to frustrate the farmers.They know we will be desperate to sell yieldThey know we will be desperate to sell the yield as it may rain any time. They are demanding 16 per cent wastage discount, which is unbearable. In July last year, I had suffered a huge loss because the rains destroyed the first crop, he said.The government gives Rs 2,140 per quintal as procurement charge to the mills, but they are still demanding huge discounts in the name of wastage, said Sajeev Rajappan of Chengalam.As we use machines for harvest, the wastage is low. We gave them a discount of 2.5 per cent last year. We also had to bear other expenses like labour cost and harvester charges, Sajeev said. The paddy was harvested on February 6 and the agents arrived for procurement on March 4.Babu Simon, of Neendoor Kaipuzhakara paddy fields, said he suffered a huge loss last year because the mill owners refused to procure his yield for questioning the high wastage charge. We have been pleading with the paddy procurement and agriculture officers to take steps for early procurement. But nobody has responded positively, he said.Meanwhile, the Civil Supplies Ministers Office said the mill owners were not keen on procuring paddy from Upper Kuttanad because the yield is low and wastage is high. They have been demanding government compensation.

Several schools were turned into dry ration distribution centres for migrant labourers and economically weaker sections during the Covid-induced lockdown. Around 8 months after the process was stopped, food and supply officers are now asking them to produce the empty gunny bags .A letter sent to principals Kirari schools on Monday stated that in compliance of the instructions received from assistant commissioner (policy), all head of schools and in-charge of non-PDS distribution schools in the area are directed to provide details of number of empty gunny bags of available so that further action may be taken.Similarly, another letter from a food supply officer in Sultanpur Majra stated that the empty bags of non-PDS foodgrains stored in the schools should be auctioned and the money deposited for credit to the government account.

The report states that over 4 lakh kilograms of wheat and 1 lakh kilograms of rice were distributed from these centres and 10,208 sacks were utilised, it stated.TOI spoke to several teachers in these centres, who said they were no longer in possession of the bags. Many needy recipients of the grains took the sacks to carry ration back home.Each school now needs to supply thousands of empty gunny bags.

He feels Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan should take everyone into confidence. People have a right to know what Pinarayi and the CPM have to say on the Customs affidavit linking him in the dollar smuggling case. While rejecting allegations that Congress leaders will go to the BJP if the party fails, Chandy also raised apprehensions over the Enforcement Directorate action against KIIFB. Excerpts.Q: Has UDF seat-sharing reached a deadlock with PJ Josephs adamant stand? Will Congress too go for fresh faces?A: Seat-sharing talks are in the final stage. We started early and reached a general understanding. Its not Josephs stubbornness. They are ready to make compromises. The delay has not happened because of differences in opinion. Congress was the first to field young candidates in 1970 when seven of us, including A K Antony and myself, contested. New faces, youth and women will get 50 per cent seats.Q: For the first time, the Congress has no government at the Centre or the state. How crucial are these elections for the very existence of the party?A: Apart from that, BJP is putting up a huge fight too. We approach the elections realising these aspects. For the first time, the Congress is displaying unity. This has given the UDF and the Congress the impetus to return to power.Q: Is there a hidden pact between BJP and CPM so that the Left can retain power and BJP increase its tally?A: Going by the developments, that cannot be ruled out. The CPM agenda is to ensure a second term and BJP wants to garner a few seats. Both want to ensure Congress defeat. But we are confident people will rally behind Congress and we will emerge victorious.Instead of trying to hoodwink people, we will address their issues. Sabarimala was widely discussed in LS polls. We supported the devotees, and wanted to protect customs and rituals. This has always been our approach. We have never used Sabarimala for political advantage.The Left is making a slew of propaganda campaigns. You must have thought highly of free kits. The UDF government had given free rice to BPL families. That too, not at the fag end of the tenure. The Left is now taking handling charges from consumers.Q: Theres a general feeling there will be an exodus of Congress leaders to BJP if the UDF does not win. Even K Sudhakaran mentioned it.A: Congress has never taken advantage of someones weakness or felt threatened. Congress doesnt fear CPM or BJP. I dont know under what context Sudhakaran said that. Tell me, which leader went to BJP after the 2016 setback? Even when PM Modi has been ruling at the Centre with all power and money as well as the central agencies under him, the Congress in Kerala never lost a single days sleep.Q: Didnt Rahul Gandhi raise concerns on Congress MLAs going to BJP?A: He highlighted BJPs despicable ways. After the 1984 LS election, BJP had just two MPs. Did Congress clamour for a BJP Mukt Bharat? In Pondicherry, the BJP toppled the government and democratic values were trampled upon.Officials in other states tell me they feel the difference between Congress and BJP. In a democratic setup, all have a right to protest. Look at the farmers protest. The PM has never bothered to hold talks with protestors.Q: Do you think the central agencies are targeting Pinarayi?A: It is Pinarayi who should reply to this. On the ED action against KIIFB, I have certain apprehensions. If the state government is right in the KIIFB masala bond issue, then I dont endorse EDs intervention. The LDF government should explain that. We will stand by truth.Q: Pinarayi began his innings as CM after meeting you at your residence. How do you rate his five years on a scale of 10?A: People should rate him, not a former chief minister. When I was CM, someone had asked me how many marks I would give myself. I said zero.Q: So are you giving zero to Pinarayi?A: Not at all. He should listen to others and take them into confidence.Q: Has there been a deliberate move to brandish the communal card?A: The CPM unleashed the communal card, which is really unfortunate. They had to correct their own secretary in-charge. The Congress leadership had visited Panakkad numerous times and this is the first time they made such an allegation. Why did that happen now? They wanted to create communal polarisation.Q: Contrary to the usual practice of Opposition leader getting prominence, the focus has shifted to you.A: Thats incorrect. The election coordination is being done collectively. I have been trying to bring everyone together and lead the election.","INTERVIEW | For first time, Congress is displaying unity, says Chandy",RICE

(Representational/Crowd Foresting)Tiny but dense forests are springing up in the metropolis. In a year, a patch, as small as a tennis court, in Mumbais eastern suburbs has become a testament to the creation of urban forests through the Miyawaki technique.Along with manicured gardens, playing arenas, jogging and cycling tracks, the 57,000-sq m Bhakti Park, located in the citys industrial ward Chembur/Wadala, hides a nascent forest of nearly 1,100 native plants that were planted a year ago on 230 sq m of area.Like a green wall, three more similar patches are planted within the garden with 36,000 saplings. Some trees at the site are neem, amla, hibiscus, jamun and cashew.These urban forests are created through Miyawaki, an afforestation method based on the work of Japanese botanist Akira Miyawaki in the 1980s. The technique compresses layers of a forest  shrubs, trees, canopies  on small plots of land, turning them into tiny forests.Read | Chennai has a new Miyawaki forest, near SecretariatAdvocates for the method say mini forests grow 10 times faster and become 30 times denser and 100 times more bio-diverse than those planted through conventional methods. This method involves planting three to four saplings per square metre, using native varieties adapted to local conditions. A wide variety of species  ideally 30 or more  are planted to recreate layers of a natural forest.Before plantation, local agro-climatic conditions, including soil quality, are studied. Three layers of greens  shrubs and undergrowth, medium-height trees and taller canopies  are integral components of the Miyawaki forests. Mulching, natural water retention and perforation material like rice husk and use of organic compost, cow dung support their growth.Miyawaki forests grow in two to three years and are self-sustaining, like how a forest is. We have to remove weeds, water the saplings for those two to three years. It is not a garden, which needs long-term maintenance, where grass needs trimming or watering is done regularly, said Nilesh Pawar, junior tree officer from M-Wests garden department.The urban forests also help lower temperatures in concrete heat islands, reduce air and noise pollution, attract local birds and insects, and create carbon sinks. The method advocates planting of diverse native species. These small patches do attract birds, squirrels, insects, but they cannot serve the purpose of natural forest. Along with these urban forests, it is important to keep our natural forests intact and to protect them, said Pradeep Tripathi, founder of NGO Green Yatra, which has executed four Miyawaki projects in Mumbai.Miyawaki forests are designed to regenerate land in far less time than the time it takes a forest to recover on its own, which is over 70 years. In a bid to compensate for the depleting green cover over the years, the BMC, in the last two years, has taken up the project to create small urban forests in the city.The brainchild of former municipal commissioner Praveen Pardeshi, the 24 ward officers were asked to identify sites for plantation. The BMC, in its budget for 2020-21, allocated over Rs 254 crore for plantation. Due to plantation in built-up spaces like roads, footpaths and covered tiled area, incidences of tree fall and human death are high. Hence, a further increase in tree cover will come from plantations in open spaces/gardens and in private layouts of developers in recreation grounds via a method of dense urban forests of indigenous local species, stated the budget speech.The idea of increased plantation within gardens was criticised by corporators. Congress corporator Asif Zakaria said, The BMC selected a patch behind the Bandra fort. Nothing has happened in over a year, instead, the area has been encroached upon. Plantations at another location within Bhakti Park, Worli, Chandivali and Kurla have begun.The BMC has set a target of planting 4,00,000 trees in 65 plots across Mumbai at the cost of Rs 32 crore. At present, the BMC has planted 54,760 trees in 14,258 sq m of space in the city.",‘Urban forests’: Miyawaki technique helps create dense green patches in one year,RICE

Rajbir is the eighth person to have allegedly killed himself at the borders of the capital, demanding that the three farm laws be repealed.A suicide note was found in the pocket of Rajbirs kurta, other farmers protesting at the site said.Read | As rate of farm suicides fell, protest claimed lives of many more farmers from PunjabInspector Sunil Kumar, Station House Officer (SHO) of Bahadurgarh City police station, said, We received information from other farmers regarding the matter. The deceased was found hanging from a tree near the bypass. In a suicide note that was found, he has stated he was taking the extreme step due to frustration regarding the farm laws.The deceased belonged to Sisai village in Hisar, and had been living in a tent at the Tikri border, 11 km from the main stage of the protests.The note found in his pocket read, To the government, I am begging you to fullfill a dying persons last wish, which is that the three laws be taken back. Bhagat Singh laid down his life for the country, I am taking my life for my farmer brothers.He asked the protesters to ensure that his sacrifice does not go in vain, and said they should leave the site only after the three laws have been repealed, and they have got guaranteed MSP.Rajbir is survived by his wife and two children. He owned around 2 acres of land, on which he grew rice and wheat.Rajender Kumar (63), his paternal uncle who reached the protest site on Saturday, said: We played cards till midnight. Around 5 am, we woke up and found that he was hanging from a tree. He went for the chakka jam in a tractor yesterday.Rajender said that since Rajbir was a small farmer, the new laws would have impacted him more severely. He did not even receive MSP the previous year. He barely used to make any money because all of it would go in transportation, fertilisers, etc. He probably thought that he would now have to suffer for the rest of his life. We have all been pained by the way the government has responded to our protests. But he could not take the pain any longer.Other farmers said Rajbir had been at the site since the protest began in November, and would assist in a langar nearby.Surender Singh (30), who is from the same village, said, He was very helpful and involved in all activities. Yesterday, he spoke to his family around 8.30 pm. His 25-year-old daughter is studying, and his 18-year-old son is a sportsperson. His wife had been managing his fields while he was away. He used to rear cattle to make some extra money, but this too was on hold since the protests began.","Farmer kills himself at Tikri, eighth suicide since protest began",RICE

They not only saved a lot of water and significantly lowered their transplanting costs but also got almost equal yield as from puddled fields.In Gurdaspur district, Dostpur villages Kulwinder Singh said he used anaerobic sowing of rice (ASR)  also called  Phagwara technique  as it was developed by Phagwara-based farmer Avtar Singh  for sowing in five acres and another five acres paddy was sown on puddled beds. With ASR technique yield was around 26 quintals per acre, while on beds, though hard work was bit more, the yield was 28 quintals per acre. It was same as others got in the area who has used traditional method of puddling the fields. Apart from saving a lot of water I also saved on and labour cost and fertiliser consumption which led to increase in the profit margin, he said.This year I shall use ASR technique in all 10 acre. If government brings mass awareness about such techniques and stops puddling then water table would come up quickly as rainwater would quickly seep into the earth. Puddled fields block seepage of rain water into earth, he said.Gurpreet Singh of Chandbaja village in Ferozepur district said he did direct seeding on beds and despite facing a few issues his yield was around 24-27 quintals depending upon quality of water. He would stick to it with further improvisation, he said, adding, biggest satisfaction is that I saved a lot of water.Malluwal villages Sukhdev Singh said he used ASR technique in 28 acres and yield was around 30 quintals per acre which was comparable to what they got with puddled fields with low input cost.In Muktsar, Shaminder Singh of Burj Sidhwan village claimed his harvest was around 32 quintal per acre after using ASR technique in his 4.5 acres, while other got around 30 quintal in the area. Several people came to see my crop. I also saved in input cost on labour as it required much less work as compared to puddled fields. Even the quality of my yield was better, he said.Haryana farmers have also started using the direct seeding technique. Gurmeet of Balasar village in Sirsa district said he used the technique in four acres last year and his harvest was equal or more than others in the area and this year he planned to increase it to 15 acres. My input cost also came to be around Rs 7,000 per acre, he added.The risk-takerIn Sirsa district of Haryana, Damdama villages Sukhwinder Singh said he used ASR technique for basmati on his entire 70 acre land and his yield was around 30 quintals per acre, which was a little higher than others.

But, little did they realise that Pramila still is an outsider in official documents and deprived of social security benefits. For more than a year, she has been running from pillar to post to get her name included in the ration card of her in-laws but to no avail.Her name was removed from the ration card of her father after her marriage. Though Budhan submitted a copy of her Aadhaar card and other details to panchayat officials, they expressed inability to add the name.Pramila is not the only victim. Thousands of women in the State are unable to access their share of ration they are entitled under the National Food Security Act (NFSA) and State Food Security Scheme (SFSS) just for the reason of getting married and moving on to their new families. Their names are deleted from the ration card of their parents, but not added to the card of their in-laws. Several families also find it difficult to add names of children.As per the 2011 Census, 46 per cent (pc) of migration was due to marriage, of which 97 pc were women. Since nearly 78 pc of Odishas population are PDS beneficiaries, observing the widespread exclusion of women, it is estimated that around 10 lakh women have been left out from PDS since NFSA came into force.A host of measures for ensuring beneficiaries their entitlements and simplification of procedures with the use of technology, notwithstanding, people in the State continue to suffer due to lack of monitoring and accountability.For Pramila and her ilk, it would be the best gift this Womens Day if the government develops a mechanism for easy inclusion of the deprived beneficiaries. The newly wed women from poor families are deprived of their entitlements as unlike Antyodaya Yojana under which a family is considered as a unit and entitled for 35 kg rice per month, the beneficiaries issued with priority household ration cards are individually entitled for 5 kg rice per month.This is why the women are suffering the most. Sometimes the beneficiaries are not aware that their names have been successfully added as dealers keep it secret for siphoning off ration, said co-convenor of Odisha Right to Food Campaign Sameet Panda.The government lacks a transparent process to port names of migrated individuals and ironically, the process remains just as opaque as people find it difficult to navigate even after Aadhaar seeding and digitisation of PDS.A mechanism should be developed to inform when a beneficiarys name is deleted or added. Since the ration card management system is dynamic, an updated list of beneficiaries must be made available at each fair price shop every month, Panda pointed out.10 lakh women left out from PDSAs per the 2011 Census, 46 pc of migration was due to marriage, of which 97 pc were women.

A native of Pedda Kurumapally village in Karimnagar district of Telangana, Mallikarjun is the only one from the State to receive the Jagjivan Ram Abhinav Kisan Puruskar from the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR). The award was given to him for cultivating different types of crops through organic farming.A day after receiving the award in Delhi, Mallikarjun is back at his experiment ground: the farms. His wife Sandhya says the buzz of the past month is new to the family. Many friends and relatives who chided his decision to quit his job and move back to the village are now appreciating his success. It feels happy to reap the benefits of hard work and innovation, she says over a phone call.Mallikarjun Reddy and his wife Sandhya | Photo Credit: Special arrangementThe story began in 2014 when Mallikarjun, a graduate in B.Tech (Computer Science) and an employee of SemanticSpace Technologies quit his software job in Hyderabad. The decision was not too sudden. Most relatives and friends used to stay with his family in Hyderabad during hospital visits, and he would accompany them sometimes. Hospitals were full of patients and doctors often spoke about the toxic effect of harmful chemicals in food and milk. It was alarming to see the way we are polluting ourselves and the environment.The last straw was the death of his friends daughter due to cancer. I didnt want toxins for my family and began the change, says Mallikarjun.Inspired by an episode of Aamir Khans talk show Satyameva Jayate and agriculturists Subhash Palekar and Rajiv Dixit, Mallikarjun decided to take the plunge.Farming was not new to his family. He took over the 12 acres that his farmer-father and role model Laxma Reddy owned, and began ploughing a unique path  a semi-organic farm with paddy. Since the results were not as expected, he cultivated paddy in drip irrigation and then tried hybrid red gram farming. He then followed the System of Rice Intensification (SRI) farming methodology to increase the yield of rice.New path Mallikarjun working at home; (below) in his fields | Photo Credit: Special arrangementHe constantly enhances knowledge by following the farming innovations propelled by the Professor Jayashankar Telangana State Agricultural University in Rajendranagar, on the outskirts of Hyderabad. He also won the best farmer award from the University. Now, he says, his organic farming brings him more returns than other farmers. If regular farming requires investment of 50,000 for 60 quintal paddy, Mallikarjun invests only 25,000 to get the output, with a gross revenue of 1,13,000. A major reasons for his ICAR award was his ability to invest less and get big returns. Mallikarjuns efforts in integrated farming, rainwater harvesting through farm ponds and open wells for increased ground water, spreading awareness among other farmers on the misuse of pesticide and stubble management have also been appreciated. Stubble burning has a negative effect on ones health and the environment too. I use waste decomposer, a bio-decomposer technique which is the result of 11 years of research by the agricultural university.Interestingly, Mallikarjun manages the fields single-handedly, without workers. I am a one-man army, he jokes. He follows a 12-hour work schedule  waking up at 4 am to feed sheep (nine), goats (21) and cows (three  Ongole, Ghir and Sahilwal) before going to the farm. His daughters delight in 600 fish that live in an open well in the fields. Every day I record around 26,000 steps at the farm; Ive lost six kilos after shifting to agriculture, he laughs.The techie-turned-farmer has also opened an organic shop in KPHB colony, where he sells produce of a group of farmers from his village.

The daily menu has been tweaked for most of the animals. We include fruits and vegetables that are juicy and fleshy, especially watermelons and salad cucumbers, so that residents are not dehydrated. Both animals and birds relish those, says TV Anilkumar, Superintendent of the zoo.In the 155-plus kilograms of fruits and vegetables purchased daily, there are 25 kilograms of watermelon, nine kilograms of salad cucumber, 20 kilograms of cucumber (vellari) and 25 kilograms of different banana varieties. Salad cucumber is an addition this year because the animals like it more than vellari. We have even cut down the quantity of vellari by five kilograms, adds Sangeetha Mohan, Curator at the zoo.Carnivores reduce their meat intake during the summer months. For instance, tigers normally consume seven kilograms of meat daily. It comes down to five kilograms or so, says Dr Jacob Alexander, Zoo Veterinarian.

Carnivores fast on Mondays, a regular holiday for the zoo.Water birds, otters, gharials and turtles eat fish. Ducks and swans have rice, amaranthus, green gram and cucumber. Peacocks and pheasants eat green chillies, coriander leaves, green gram, cooked rice and big onions.Among the flightless birds, rheas prefer cabbage, carrot, poultry feed, amaranthus and rice. While ostriches have amaranthus mixed with dog food, bananas and vegetables, emus are given carrot and bananas.Rhinos have cattle feed, cucumber, carrot, long beans, onion, grass, fodder and mineral mix.Monkeys now get more fruits, especially oranges and grapes, besides their daily meal of boiled eggs (they love egg whites!), guava, apple, bananas, coconut, papayas, groundnut (husked and de-husked), tomatoes, pineapple and long beans.Bath timeElaborate arrangements are also in place to keep the animals hydrated throughout the day.

Or they move towards the fans to get relief. Sprinklers also ensure that there is enough green vegetation in the enclosures, adds Anilkumar.Meanwhile tigers, leopards and lions have the luxury of showers and concrete water pools within their cages. They love to rest in the water. Water is let out to the enclosures of Barasingha (swamp deer) and sambar deer so that they can create their own swampy environment with puddles, adds Dr Jacob.

It is not just a manifesto but a resolution letter for West Bengal by the country's largest party. We will create a Sonar Bangla"".Unveiling the ""Sonar Bangla Sankalpa Patra"" at EZCC in Salt Lake, Union Home Minister Amit Shah said that BJP will ensure the implementation of the Ayushman Bharat healthcare scheme and the PM-Kisan programme in the state, besides giving at least one job per family.The BJP's manifesto mentioned that no infiltrators to be allowed in Bengal and border fencing will be strengthened with CCTVs and other devices.

By 2024, the market is expected to grow to $1.3 trillion.India - population 1.3 billion - has over the years become a sought-after retail destination with a growing base of young and affluent shoppers. The sector contributes 10% to India's gross domestic product and accounts for 8% of India's employment, according to Invest India , the country's investment promotion arm.Mom-and-pop stores and 'kiranas'India's mom-and-pop stores sell everything from clothes and footwear to groceries and electronics. Most of India's grocery retail happens at kiranas - small- and mid-sized mom-and-pop outlets which account for 75-78% of the consumer goods market, Ambit Capital estimates.Store owners typically have a strong and regular customer base in their neighbourhood, with home delivery and taking orders on phone a common phenomenon.Hundreds of household items are crammed inside wall-to-wall glass or wooden shelves, or in the open, at such stores. Many outlets are so small and cramped that customers don't set foot inside - products are handed over by store staff who stand behind a counter.Many of these shops also offer staples - such as pulses, rice and flour - in loose or unbranded form. They typically operate from early morning till late evening.Supermarkets - Modern retailThis segment is a growing trend in India, with companies like Reliance Industries , led by India's richest man Mukesh Ambani, Future Retail, led by Kishore Biyani , and Avenue Supermarts' DMart all competing for customers.This segment accounts for about 12-15% of consumer goods sales, according to Ambit. A long-established store format in the West, supermarkets are the polar opposite of kiranas; tidy, well-lit and with plenty of space for customers with shopping carts to seek out items from neatly stacked shelves themselves.Mini-supermarkets in built-up residential areas are also spreading in response to the need to cater to urban shoppers buying supplies in smaller volumes on a daily basis rather than in a once-a-week drill. Most supermarkets operate during usual business hours and shut in late evening.E-commerce - $200 billion market by 2026Shoppers in India are increasingly turning to e-commerce to shop for everything from electronics to groceries, boosted by online discounts and the development of rapid delivery services across the country.While companies such as Amazon.com Inc and Walmart's Flipkart dominate the market, smaller startups have also introduced app-based services for daily delivery of morning essentials like milk and eggs.Boston Consulting Group says e-commerce currently accounts for about 5-6% of Indian retail. But growth is phenomenal: India's e-commerce retail market stood at $30 billion in 2019 but is set to expand by an annual 30% to $200 billion by 2026, Invest India estimates.",Nearly $900bn mkt dominated by mom-and-pop stores,RICE

The temples, however, can supply Anna Prasadam to the devotees in packets, by strictly adhering to the Covid guidelines.After observing the spike in coronavirus cases, we took the decision and it will come into force with immediate effect. Giving priority to the devotees sentiments, we have also decided to provide them food in packets, Arjuna Rao told TNIE. He said instructions have been issued to all temple executive officers to ensure that Covid guidelines such as wearing face mask, social distancing and sanitisation are followed strictly on the premises.Acting on the instructions of the commissioner, Kanaka Durga temple authorities started distribution of food packets instead of serving food to the devotees in the Annadana Satram. The SDMSD authorities are planning to distribute 2,000 packets of sambar rice and another 2,000 packets of Daddojanam to the devotees. Everyday, the SDMSD is providing food for over 1,500 devotees at Annadanam Satram on the temple premises. Now, we are going to supply food packets to 4,000 devotees, said Durga temple EO MV Suresh Babu.Meanwhile, the authorities of Sri Bhramaramba Mallikarjuna Swamy temple in Srisailam suspended the Annadanam services from Monday to prevent gatherings of pilgrims. At least 10 people, including priests and staff, tested positive for coronavirus in the past few days in the Srisailam temple town. Soon after the completion of Maha Shivaratri Brahmotsavams on March 14, the positive cases witnessed a steady increase and the temple authorities have decided to strictly enforce No Mask - No Entry rule, the temple executive officer KS Rama Rao said. He said after relaxation of lockdown norms, Annadanam was resumed at the temple on February 4.Now, we are providing free food packets to the devotees, he added. The free food packets will be provided to all devotees between 10.30 am to 3 pm every day by following the Covid guidelines, he said.Temple authorities said 6-7 lakh devotees visited the temple during Mahashivaratri Brahmotsavams and nearly 10,000 devotees are visiting the temple daily. Stating that sanitiser dispensers were installed at various parts of the temple town, the EO said they are planning to allow only those devotees who booked online in the next couple of days, if the situation continues.Even the holy baths are not allowed at Patalganga to prevent gathering of people, he added. Rooms are allocated to the pilgrims as per Covid guidelines, he said.On the functioning of the Agama Patasala, he said all precautions have been taken in view of the Covid-19 outbreak at Veda Patasala at Tirumala. A decision may be taken to close the patasala if cases emerge in the school, he said.Speaking to TNIE, Srisailam medical officer M Soma Sekhar said they were conducting testing and vaccination daily. As many as 500 of the 1,600 temple staff have been tested after the Sivaratri Brahmotsavams. At least 450 staff were given vaccines so far, he explained. Screening centres are working in the temple town where RTPCR and rapid tests are being conducted round-the-clock for both the temple staff and pilgrims, Soma Sekhar said.","Annadanam stopped in temples, devotees to get food packets",RICE

The study, released on World Water Day , demonstrates a grim picture of groundwater depletion in the state. It shows that the highest groundwater drop in Bengal since 2013 has been up to 11m, mostly in the central zone or the rice bowl of Bengal, which is Burdwan district.There has also been a decline of groundwater level in Kolkata from 7m to 20m in the last 12 years. Says Vinay Jaju of SwitchON Foundation, Due to the absence of technologies to harvest rainwater, the state is struggling to meet the aspirations of its farmers and the time has come for taking a critical look at the deteriorating resource.To tackle this situation, the not-for-profit organization is partnering with various academic institutions, like IITs, with a plan to undertake rainwater harvesting in Kolkata and groundwater recharge in four districts of Bengal. Part of the agenda is to spread awareness among farmers and citizens to save water.In recent years, farmers and cities have started facing water stress, which has resulted in heightened distress, says Parul Thapa of SwitchON Foundation. SwitchON has launched their flagship Stren-gthening Energy Water Agriculture (SEWA) programme to promote clean energy in agriculture, doubling farmers income and conserving water resources. With aggressive use of groundwater, the second green revolution is also being promoted in east India. The consequences will lead to wells going dry, groundwater contamination emerging more strongly than what we have now, competition and conflict over groundwater, along with groundwater depletion, said Himanshu Kulkarni, executive director of Advanced Centre for Water Resources Development and Management.",Study finds signs of groundwater dip in Bengal,RICE

There were more than 43,000 U.S. gun deaths last year, according to the Gun Violence Archive.Ive beaten the National Rifle Association nationally twice, passed meaningful gun legislation at the federal level, and Ill do it again, Biden said last year at one of several campaign events focused on the issue, referring to the influential gun rights group closely aligned with Republicans.As president, I promise you I will get these weapons of war off the street again, Biden added, referring to a national ban on assault-style weapons that lapsed in 2004.We can ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. We can close loopholes in our gun background check system. This is not a partisan issue  its an American issue that will save lives. Congress needs to act.  President Biden (@POTUS) March 23, 2021The numerous U.S. mass shootings have failed to prompt lawmakers to pass gun control legislation, thanks in large part to opposition from congressional Republicans and the NRA. The right to bear arms is enshrined in the U.S. Constitutions Second Amendment and many Americans cherish gun rights.Nearly 70% of Americans support adding strong or moderate federal gun restrictions, and ideas such as background checks and databases to track ownership have even greater public support, a 2019 Reuters poll found https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/news-polls/reuters-ipsos-data-gun-control-2019-02-08.Bidens fellow Democrats hold only slim majorities in both the House of Representatives and the Senate.The House on March 11 passed two bills that would broaden background checks for gun buyers, but the legislation faces an uncertain future in the Senate. Most legislation requires 60 votes in the 100-seat chamber to move forward. With Republicans holding 50 seats, reaching that threshold appears difficult.Biden has not put forth his own legislation but on Tuesday reiterated his call for the Senate to approve the House-passed bills and also advocated a ban on assault-style weapons. A Senate panel held a hearing on gun issues on Tuesday.This is not and should not be a partisan issue. This is an American issue. It will save lives  American lives  and we have to act, Biden said.Asked by a reporter if he would propose his own bill, Biden said he would talk about that later.Any potential gun control measures passed by Congress would almost certainly face a legal challenge that could reach the Supreme Court, whose 6-3 conservative majority is seen as sympathetic to an expansive view of gun rights.PAST FAILURESBiden has long embraced gun control. As vice president under President Barack Obama, Biden was instrumental is seeking congressional approval of legislation after a 2012 mass shooting at a Connecticut elementary school.After a fierce NRA lobbying campaign, Senate Republicans in 2013 thwarted legislation that would expand background checks for gun buyers, ban assault-style weapons and bar high-capacity gun magazines. The NRA since then has encountered internal upheaval and legal challenges.As a candidate, Biden pledged to hold gun makers accountable in the courts for firearms violence, to sign new laws restricting assault weapons and to expand background checks for gun sales. Many of his promises would require congressional passage but gun control activists have urged Biden to take executive action on matters he has the power to address by himself.These activists proposed even before the recent shootings that Biden direct the Justice Departments Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to block the sale of self-assembled ghost guns without background checks or serial numbers to identify the finished product.They also urged Biden to name a permanent director of that agency, which is headed by an interim chief installed under Republican former President Donald Trump, a close NRA ally.Gun control activists have been holding regular virtual meetings with senior White House aides Susan Rice and Cedric Richmond. These sessions have been focused on soliciting views rather than outlining policy action, according to people who attended, speaking on condition of anonymity.Ryan Borowski, a 37-year-old massage therapist who was in the Colorado grocery store during Mondays shootings, said that he would like to see lawmakers pursue practical gun regulations to take weapons out of the hands of mentally unstable people.Ive listened to gun advocates and Ive listened to the other side, and I have to agree with both sides there is a lot of common sense laws that can be passed, Borowski said. There are a lot of stupid loopholes.",Latest U.S. mass shooting puts pressure on Biden to secure new gun laws,RICE

The Ministry of External Affairs is negotiating. We hope to see a breakthrough soon. We are trying to resolve this by April,"" Food Secretary Sudhanshu Pandey told PTI.Iran still has some quantity of other currencies. The two countries are discussing to allow any other currency that banks can accept for bilateral trade, he said.Asked when sugar export from India will resume, the secretary said the issue will hopefully get resolved by April and thereafter the shipments can take place.Iran needs sugar. It imports sugar from India as prices are better and transportation cost is less, he said.During last year, Iran had imported 11 lakh tonnes of sugar from India, which is one-sixth of the country's total exports, he added.On India's sugar export quota fixed at 6 million tonne for the current 2020-21 marketing year (October-September), the secretary made it clear that the quota remains the same and there is no question of increasing it.""There is confusion if export quota will be increased or not. 6 million tonne is the quota for this year. For next year's quota, we will not make a decision now,"" he said.The decision on fixing an export quota for the 2021-22 marketing year will be determined based on the area sown under sugarcane crop and production estimates, he said. He further said India has contracted 4.3 million tonne of sugar export so far this year.Of which, about 2.1 million tonne have left sugar mills.Almost 1.63 million tonne have been despatched from ports.

(Representational)The Delhi government Wednesday rolled back its decision to implement the proposed doorstep delivery of ration scheme under the name Mukhya Mantri Ghar Ghar Ration Yojna, but the Centre indicated that the logjam persists over other provisions such as conversion charges.According to the initial plan drawn up by the Delhi government, the doorstep delivery agents were expected to wear t-shirts on which the name Mukhya Mantri Ghar Ghar Ration Yojana (MMGGRY) would be written. The Centre had pointed out that such a nomenclature may lead to a situation where people would start misinterpreting benefits under the National Food Security Act as state government benefits.The Centre had also made it clear that foodgrains allocated under the National Food Security Act cannot be used for a policy drawn up at the local level.The Union Food Secretary also questioned one of the components of the proposed scheme which involves collection milling/conversion charges from beneficiaries. The Delhi government has not yet made public the charges.Read | You can take credit, let us launch ration scheme: Delhi CM to CentreSpeaking to The Indian Express, Union Food Secretary Sudhanshu Pandey said, The (MMGGRY) notification says that cost of subsidised foodgrains, which is subsidised by the Government of India, and a specified amount as milling/conversion charges will be collected from the beneficiaries. It means that this charge will be decided by contractor How much of that will you collect from the beneficiary One does not know what the cost of delivery is.According to the notification of the doorstep scheme, millers empanelled with the Delhi State Civil Supplies Corporation Ltd (DSCSC) will be tasked with lifting wheat and rice from the godowns of the Food Corporation of India (FCI). The wheat will be processed into flour before distribution by doorstep agents, while the rice will be cleaned of impurities.Pandey pointed out that under the NFSA, states cannot charge higher prices from the beneficiaries for the foodgrains.Pandey also questioned the provision under which every beneficiary will have to annually inform the authorities whether they want to remain under its ambit or return to the previous arrangement of collecting directly from ration shops.In Delhi, residential address changes very often due to change in employment, residence and other reasons. I can decide whether I want to draw the ration from X place or Y place. If I cannot change my option at the beginning of the year, it becomes a very tricky situation, he said.He said the Delhi government had been told clearly that they could make their own scheme and run it, not mutate the existing scheme.The distribution of ration in Delhi is currently managed by a network of 2,005 fair price shops. Under the NFSA, approximately 17.77 lakh ration card holding families in Delhi are divided into three categories 15.12 lakh priority households (PR), 1.73 lakh priority state households (PRS), and 68,468 Antyodaya Anna Yojana (AAY) families.The beneficiaries coming under the PR and PRS categories are entitled to 5 kg of foodgrains per month while AAY households receive 25 kg wheat, 10 kg rice and 1 kg sugar.",Delhi: Union Food Secretary questions execution of ration scheme,RICE

Western brands face pressure at home to distance themselves from possible abuses.More than one million people in Xinjiang, most of them from predominantly Muslim ethnic groups, have been confined to work camps, according to foreign researchers and governments. Beijing denies mistreating them and says it is trying to promote economic development and stamp out radicalism.On Monday, the 27-nation European Union, the United States, Britain and Canada jointly announced travel and financial sanctions on four senior Chinese officials blamed for abuses in Xinjiang.Beijing retaliated by saying it would impose unspecified penalties against European legislators and a German researcher who has publicised information about the detention camps.H&Ms statement last March cited a decision by the Better Cotton Initiative, an industry group that promotes environmental and labour standards, to stop licensing Xinjiang cotton because it was increasingly difficult to trace how it was produced.

Last week, the Centre had objected to the AAP government s flagship scheme stating that highly subsidised foodgrains from the central pool under National Food Security Act couldnt be used for the Mukhyamantri Ghar Ghar Ration Yojna, which was expected to be rolled out on March 25.The Delhi cabinet chaired by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday approved the scheme to be rolled out without any name. The scheme will now be sent to the Centre for its approval.Kejriwal said beneficiaries face several issues while collecting ration from fair price shops. At times, they dont even get the rations. This had prompted Delhi government to deliver packed rations at their doorstep. The Centres objection came as a shock to Delhi government. Perhaps, the Centre had an objection to the word mukhyamantri. Therefore, we have decided to roll out the scheme without any name, the CM added.The AAP government hopes that the Centre will give its nod to the revised scheme under which wheat flour, rice and sugar would be delivered to homes in packed bags in place of loose rations. The government believes that this will help weed out the ration mafia and beneficiaries will get the advantage of the scheme. Moreover, taking rations from public distribution system (PDS) shops will become optional.We do not want any credit for this scheme. Thats why the name is being removed. There will be no mention of mukhyamantri anywhere. Delhi government just wants to provide ration in good quality and quantity to people, said Kejriwal.The doorstep delivery of ration, which led to confrontation between Delhi government and the Centre, is the brainchild of Kejriwal, who struggled for years to make PDS transparent before he joined politics.The scheme was designed in early 2018, but could not be passed because the lieutenant governor had different views. He had asked the AAP government to send the proposal to the Centre with all implementation details for approval. This was one of the reasons behind Kejriwal and his ministers holding days-long dharna at Raj Bhavan in June 2018.

I am sorry, but one day you are going to get added to my soup, I tell it.When it does, it will greatly enhance the flavour of the soup  just like the lemongrass that gave zest to the tom yam soup I had a few days ago. The soup had been tempered with Thai herbs, and the presence of lemongrass in it was unmistakable. I scooped out the small shrimps in the broth and with that, started quite a memorable Oriental meal delivered by a new outlet called Azuma Kara.

I cant have enough of the flavours that kaffir lime leaves, lemongrass and galangal add to Thai food. So even though the menu has Japanese and other kinds of cuisines, I stuck (more or less) to my favourite Southeast Asian region. I asked for chicken Thai herb dim sums and prawn kaffir lime dim sums (390 each), char siu bao pork (490), Thai green curry chicken (680), pad Thai noodles (280) and lemongrass tiramisu (380).The tom yam prawn soup (340) was hearty, if a bit salty. It was pleasantly aromatic, and I had it with a crusty piece of bread. I moved on to the dim sums. The filling was robust  the chicken with Thai herbs had a nice flavour, as did the prawn with kaffir lime leaves. I then had a piece of the bao and enjoyed the pork belly filling on spicy mayo.Char Siu Bao at South Delhis Azuma Kara | Photo Credit: Special arrangementI am a green curry fan, and enjoyed it thoroughly. The chicken had soaked in the tastes and aromas of the herbs  especially the lemongrass  and I had it with some sticky rice and vegetable pad Thai. The icing was the lemongrass tiramisu. The herb gave the soft and cheesy dessert a delicious kick.The menu at Azuma Kara is interesting, and I am not surprised, for the chef here was earlier at Blue Ginger, known for its Vietnamese cuisine, in Taj Palace. It has Vietnamese summer rolls on the menu, and the soup list includes cauliflower miso soup and Thai coconut soup (both 350). On the sushi list are rolls with mango and avocado, salmon and tuna (460-890). Among the interesting dishes are its one-meal bowls: spicy tuna poke bowl (690), tofu poke bowl (620), massaman pork curry with sticky rice and Asian greens (840) and Peruvian potatoes, wild mushroom and winter truffles (940).In these troubled times, it was nice to get the old familiar fragrance of Thai herbs in my food.

In September, H&M announced it would stop working with a Chinese manufacturer that was accused of using forced labor in a unit unrelated to the Swedish brand.In January, Washington imposed a ban on imports of cotton from Xinjiang, a major supplier to clothing producers for Western markets.Chinas official outrage has focused on Europe, possibly because relations with the EU were relatively amicable amid rancor with Washington over trade disputes and accusations of Chinese spying and technology theft.Official criticism of H&M reflected that tone of grievance at being hurt by a friend.How can H&M eat Chinese rice and then smash Chinas pot? state television said in a commentary on Wednesday.On its social media account, H&M Group said the company doesn't represent any political standpoint"" and respects Chinese consumers.The company said it deals with 350 Chinese manufacturers to make products that comply with the principles of sustainable development. H&M said it is committed to long-term investment and development in China.On Thursday, H&M products were missing from China's two most popular online retailers, Alibaba Group's TMall and JD.com. News reports said they were removed due to public criticism over its Xinjiang statement. Spokespeople for Alibaba and JD didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.Internet users pointed to clothing brands Uniqlo of Japan and The Gap of the United States as other possible offenders. It was unclear how many of those accounts were members of the public and how many were operated by the ruling partys vast propaganda apparatus.Pop star Wang Yibo's announcement that he was quitting as a Nike brand ambassador"" didn't mention Xinjiang. It said he firmly resists any words and actions that pollute China.""Others including singer and actress Song Qian, a former member of Korean pop group f(x) who also is known as Victoria Song, and actor Huang Xuan announced they would end endorsement contracts with H&M. Actress Tang Songyun said she was breaking ties with Nike.Chinese athletic shoe brand ANTA announced it was pulling out of BCI, the industry cotton group.","China attacks foreign clothing, shoe brands over Xinjiang",RICE

This is how Holi was traditionally celebrated; but somewhere along the line, it was replaced by mass-produced synthetic colours, says the 28-year-old natural colour artist based in Hyderabad.Manya who has been conducting workshops on natural colours for the past two years, is among the growing tribe of people choosing to go eco-friendly for the popular festival of colours. Over the past few years home-grown brands have also come up with ways to help people celebrate Holi, guilt-free.Avani, a Kumaon-based cooperative founded in 2012, produces an organic range of Holi colours in five shades. The orange shade is from the flame of the forest, blue from Himalayan indigo, yellow from turmeric, green a combination of turmeric and indigo and lac from a resinous secretion from the lac insects, explains Rashmi Bharti, co-founder of Avani.They have a model where local farmers convert wastelands to produce raw materials. We work with 600 farmers and have around 150 acres of land to grow our raw materials. The pigments are also used to dye clothes and create organic crayons.The organisation uses rice flour as the base and the organic colours are mixed with it. Dyes and detergents are the major cause of pollution of our water bodies, soil and ocean. When we choose not to use them, we are contributing less to the pollution. Then we oblige the chemical manufacturers to shift to making nature-friendly products, says Rashmi.Home-made Holi colours by Manya Cherabuddi | Photo Credit: Special ArrangementNatural colours not only require less water to wash off but the runoff also will not pollute groundwater.Many organisations also use recycled flowers to make pigments. Visakhapatnam-based GreenWaves Environmental Solutions collects floral waste from temples to make their organic Holi colours, with the help of a small team of women.This year the startup, which specialises in e-waste recycling and eco-friendly products, is offering Holi colours in yellow, green, pinkish-red and purple for the first time. The yellow is made from marigold and turmeric that are collected from seven temples across Visakhapatnam. Our collection drive started in the last week of February. On an average, we collect nearly a ton of temple floral waste every month, says Potluri Anil Chowdary, managing director of GreenWaves Environmental Solutions.The green is from neem and tulsi leaves, pinkish-red from rose petals and beetroot is used to make the purple Holi colour. A major part of the production time goes into drying the floral waste since most flowers are collected in a wet or semi-wet condition. Once dry, it takes a day to complete the process of turning it into Holi colours. Every element in the colours is natural; you can even smell the fragrance of natural product in the colours, says Chowdary.People with intellectual disabilities making skin-friendly Holi colours for Craftizen Foundation | Photo Credit: Special ArrangementFor the past four years, Bengaluru-based NGO, Craftizen Foundation, has been selling skin-friendly Holi colours labelled Petalists made from discarded flowers collected from temples and marriage halls. The production is done by 200 people with intellectual disabilities from four organisations  NIMHANS, Grameena Abhyudaya Seva Samste (GASS), Orione Seva and Richmond Fellowship Society, in the city. We provide the training and also market their products, explains Mayura Balasubramaniam, founder of Craftizen.It takes around four kilograms of flowers to make a kilogram of the Holi colour. Though they sold 3,000 kilograms last year, this year we have only made 1,700 kilograms. With the pandemic, we were unsure of the market, but the sales have been good so far Mayura explains.Natural pigment extracted from recycled flowers by Phool.co | Photo Credit: Special ArrangementPhool.co has a similar story. The company launched skin-friendly organic Holi colours last year with 5,000 packets. We were sold out in a week. So we increased our production by five times this year, but still, we ran out of our products in three weeks. We had four colours on offer  pink, yellow, green and blue. We also used essential oils to give them fragrance, says Apurv Misal, head-Marketing and Sales of Phool.co.The firm also sells charcoal-free incense made with recycled flowers collected from temples around the Ganga in Kanpur.

2021-03-26,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/kong-flody-and-pig-trotter-soup/article34168314.ece,"Pig trotter soup is a popular dish in the local cuisine of Shillong. It scores high both in nutritional value and tasteOne rainy afternoon in Jhargram, Medinipur, I was making my way home from work through runnels of rainwater on a muddy path with paddy fields on either side. I was cursing myself for not carrying an umbrella, and also for choosing this shortcut because it was picturesque. Suddenly, I remembered my days in Shillong where rain could come similarly unannounced, and longed for Kong Flodys pig trotter soup.Before I go any further, let me tell you a little about Kong Flody and pig trotter soup.Kong Flodys name (Kong in Khasi means elder sister) was on most peoples lips in Shillong in the early 1970s on account of her instinctive healing touch. She became a professional therapeutic masseuse almost by accident after she heard a sages prophecy and grew aware of her ability. When my mother had a severe case of frozen shoulder and muscle debilitation that did not respond to modern treatment, our neighbours suggested we call Kong Flody. Not only did she cure my mother over the course of the next six months, she also became a fast friend. Very often on my way back from college I would sight one of her daughters waiting for me at the head of the lane leading down to their house. She would whisper in her excitement, Come quickly, Mother has just taken the pig trotter soup off the fire, or, We saved some doh khlieh (pork brain salad) for you from lunch, come on.Nutritious dishPig trotter soup is a popular dish in the local cuisine of Shillong. It scores high both in nutritional value  it is recommended for pregnant women, children and the elderly  and taste. For that matter, my mother fed us trotter soup when we were children to build strong bones, but most of the time it was lamb trotter soup (tengrir soup in Bengali). It was good enough but from what I remember, it didnt have the same rich taste or flavour as pig trotter soup.Kong Flodys soup, a broth really, which we called suruwa, was cooked on a slow coal fire and left to simmer all day. There was no seasoning save salt, peppercorns and onions. By the time the soup was done, the trotters would have almost melted to the point that they could be chomped into a mash, and the marrow blended with the onion.I sat around the fire with Kong Flodys three daughters in a small, cosy kitchen with a wooden floor while she ladled out the soup in large mugs. Transparent globules of fat floated on the surface of a steaming, thickish broth. She served this with hunks of crusty white bread, which I had, while her daughters preferred to drop red rice into their mugs to be spooned up.You dipped your bread slice into the mug for a moment, lifting it to your mouth just before it threatened to fall into the soup, then sucked it up, followed by a sip from the mug. It was rich and coated your lips as you drank. And you licked your lips off roundly. I remember the three girls and me laughing at each other as we did this while Kong Flodys eyes twinkled and she beamed at us indulgently like a big mother cat.Winter treatThat rainy afternoon in Jhargram I decided to try out Kong Flodys soup. The only trouble was that I had no access to pig trotters. Well, I thought, lamb trotters would have to do. Incidentally, in the early 1980s in Jhargram when I was posted there, meat was unbelievably cheap, even for those times. Chicken and lamb sold for 13 a kilo while khashi (castrated goat) was 25. Trotters cost 25 paise each.There was radhuni pata, or wild celery, growing in patches all over the garden, so I decided to use it. In the absence of radhuni pata you could use celery stalks and leaves. This is my recipe. You could try it on a winters day.SUNDAY RECIPELamb trotter soupIngredients6-8 lamb trotters12-15 cups water2 large onions, sliced roughly1 tbsp pepper corns5 cloves garlicSalt to taste1 handful radhuni pata with stalks or two stalks of celeryMethod1. In a heavy bottomed kadhai or handi set the trotters to boil over medium heat.2. Slice the onions and chop the radhuni pata. Peel the garlic.3. Once the water starts boiling, add the garlic, peppercorns, onions and radhuni pata stalks, leaving the leaves for garnish.4. Cover the pot, reduce the heat and allow the soup to simmer. Stir it once in a while. The longer a soup simmers the better it is. When I cooked this in Jhargram, I let the soup remain on the coal stove all day. In a slow cooker this would take about the same time, say 5-6 hours. The soup should have about 6-7 cups at the end.5. Stir well to mix the soup. Add salt and white pepper. Garnish with radhuni pata or celery leaves.6. Serve with croutons, soup sticks or crusty bread.The writer is the author of the food memoir, Spiced, Smoked, Pickled, Preserved: Recipes and Reminiscences from Indias Eastern Hills.",Kong Flody and pig trotter soup,RICE

If the auctioned lot was not lifted by that date, the rice would be re-appropriated by the FCI, and the State would have to participate in fresh auction, which might entail an additional burden on the the government.The EC's directive to defer the distribution till the election was over would adversely affect at least 50 lakh families, thereby impinging on the fundamental right guaranteed to them under Article 21 of the Constitution.Need of the hourIn fact, a social welfare measure such as distribution of rice was the need of the hour in this pandemic situation in view of the fast approaching Vishu  Easter and Ramadan festival seasons. If all the Election Commission was worried about the opposition from some political party, it is also trite that such political opposition alone was not a material factor, the government added.The Election Commissions counsel submitted that the order directing to defer the distribution of rice was based on a decision of a screening committee consisting of the Chief Secretary and other secretaries constituted to streamline the grant of permissions in view of the Model Code of Conduct.The purpose of such a committee was to expedite the grant of permission in the light of the code of conduct.

With this order, the state government can continue the distribution of rice as fixed earlier.Justice PV Asha issued the order on the petition filed by the state of Kerala represented by the Additional Secretary to Government of Kerala, Food and Civil Supplies Department seeking to quash the order of the Commission.The Election Commission requested the court to ensure that the stay order shall not be used as a weapon in the election by the ruling party to influence the voters. The court made it clear that the distribution should be strictly in accordance with the manual of the Model Code of Conduct (MCC).All ostentatious functions should be strictly avoided with regard to the rice distribution and no impression should be given or allowed to be created that such welfare measures or relief and rehabilitation works are being undertaken by the government in office so as to influence the electors in favour of the party in power.ALSO READ: Kerala elections: Congress alleges widespread irregularities in postal votingThe state government argued that the Model Code of Conduct does not apply to the implementation of ongoing programmes. The decision regarding the special distribution was taken on February 4, much before the election notification. The decision was taken on based on the budget speech of the Finance Minister.In the Kerala Budget, 2021, the government announced additional rice of 10 kg at the rate of Rs 15 would be provided to 50 lakh families having blue and white ration cards, which means non prioritised categories. Hence it will not fall under the prohibition under the Model Code of Conduct, said the government.The government had ordered that the additional rice required for the distribution must be procured from the Open Market Sale Scheme (OMSS) of the Food Corporation of India (FCI). The state, thereafter, successfully got an auction acceptance offer for rice worth Rs 84 crore from the OMSS of the FCI. If the scheme does not materialise by March 30, the state will have to take steps for a fresh auction, which may entail an additional burden on it.The concept of a welfare state implies governmental interference for the welfare of its citizens. Such a social welfare measure is the need of the hour in this pandemic situation coupled with the fast-approaching Vishu-Easter festive season and subsequent Ramzan. It was settled law that the object of the MCC is not to stop all governmental activities in the state. If at all the Election Commission were worried of opposition from some political party, that alone is not a material factor. Hence, the act of the commission is not legally sustainable.The Election Commission submitted that a screening committee consisting of the Chief Secretary has been constituted to streamline the grant of permissions regarding the issues arising out of the model code of conduct. The purpose is to expedite the grant of permission wherever an issue arises. The proposal which was forwarded by the screening committee doesn't disclose any of the aspects mentioned in the writ petition.Clause 5.4.1 of the manual of MCC with regard to the announcement of financial grants, concessions, relief and subsidy clearly stated that the Election Commission invariably takes a humanitarian view on the works that are necessitated due to man-made and natural calamities. It does not refuse approval for schemes undertaken for tackling emergencies or for providing relief to people suffering from drought, floods, pestilences, other natural calamities or welfare measures for the aged and infirm. In these matters, however, prior approval of the Election Commission should be taken.In this case, the proposal was insufficient and it was not the opposition or any other political party has raised objection regarding the distribution. The aspect that the last date for the tender is on March 30 is not before the Commission. Let the government file a fresh proposal, argued the Commission.",Kerala HC stays EC decision to halt distribution of rice to non-priority ration card holders,RICE

On both occasions, the then oppositions found fault with the governments undue haste in distributing freebies to voters ahead of election.In 2011, V S Achuthanandan government announced rice at Rs 2 per kg for all ration card holders without APL/BPL distinction. The decision was taken in the cabinet meeting held on February 23, 2011, which was the last full-fledged meeting held before the notification of the assembly election. In fact, the government issued hasty orders to ensure that the distribution of subsidised rice wouldnt be hit by the model code of conduct.However, the election commission vetoed the decision after the then opposition leader Oommen Chandy raised a flag against the intention of the government. The commissions order was challenged in the High Court by CPI leader and then MLA Rajaji Mathew Thomas.The division bench led by Justice J Chelameswar quashed the EC order and allowed the government to implement the scheme, by noting that the decision and other steps for implementing the scheme were taken before March 1, 2011, when the model code of conduct came into effect.In 2016, the election commission found fault with the Oommen Chandy governments decision to provide free rice to all BPL families in the state. The decision was announced in the budget that year and also necessary orders were issued before the model code of conduct came into force. However, the then chief electoral officer E K Majhi told the government that the scheme couldnt be launched as a new scheme as notification for election has been issued.The government then forwarded all files to the commission and decided to approach the High Court against the order. On the eve of going to the court, the commission cleared the proposal after receiving legal advice that the 2011 order by Justice J Chelameswar was binding for this decision too. The commission had laid out several strictures including not adding any new beneficiary to the scheme or not advertising the scheme as an achievement of the government during the campaign while clearing the proposal. Interestingly, the then CPM state secretary Pinarayi Vijayan was supportive of the ECs decision.Oommen Chandy is intolerant to the Election Commission. His government would be known as the first to take on the Election Commission which only questioned its wrongdoings, Pinarayi had said during an election campaign meeting in Kozhikode then.As his role reversed to the chief minister, Pinarayi is now finding fault with Opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala, alleging a bid by him to stop the distribution of food to the needy. In 2011, V S Achuthanandan sought a public apology from Oommen Chandy after the High Court cleared the Rs 2 rice scheme for trying to sabotage the scheme.Along with the distribution of free rice under the noon-meal scheme to schoolchildren, the LDF Government has made all arrangements to finish the distribution of the Ramzan-Vishu free grocery kit before April 6, the polling day. The decision to start distribution in the last week of March, which was now changed to April 1, was to ensure that maximum number of families would receive the kit before D-Day. Arrangements were also made to provide two months social welfare pension of Rs 3,100  including Rs 1,500 for March and the revised Rs 1,600 for April - to nearly 50 lakh beneficiaries. For streamlining the fund flow, Finance Minister Thomas Isaac convened a meeting of the Finance Department and Treasury officials on March 19.The state has borrowed Rs 8,000 crore by auctioning bonds this month for facilitating the smooth distribution of all welfare schemes. The additional revenue in the states coffers will also help it provide revised pay for government employees and revised pension for state government employees in the first week of April itself. The March-19 meeting convened by Isaac had also decided to make Good Friday and Easter as working days for treasuries so that salary and pension are distributed before the polling day. Christian employees will be given restricted holidays on both days.",Kerala elections: War over charity a repeating feature in election years,RICE

Easily, it is through songs and punch dialogues. None other than the Dravidian majors, who used films to reach the masses, could have understood it better.Adhimoolam, a functionary of DMKs literary wing, told The New Indian Express, Despite many of our poll promises and policies being good, there is a difficulty in taking them to the people as many do not understand them. At the same time, catchy songs like Stalin than vararu, vidiyal thara poraru (Stalin is coming and he will bring us dawn) bring cheer and enthusiasm among the party cadre.Viralimalai Manickam, who has been involved in poll-related works since 1967, told The New Indian Express, During the 1967 general elections, there was no practice of using many songs. At the time, DMK cadres aired the songs Oodivarugiran Udhaya Sooriyan (The rising sun is running to us), Azhaikinrar Anna (Anna invites) and some songs from MGR films, which highlighted the DMKs ideology and CN Annadurais capability. He also recalled a punch dialogue based on the DMKs election promise  Moondru padi latchiyam, oru padi nichayam (Three padi is our goal, one padi is surety). Padi is a local measure approximately equivalent to 1.5 kg of rice. The punch dialogue worked as a game changer and brought the DMK to power in the State.Veteran journalist T Koodalarasan said, But, the situation has widely changed after the death of former Chief Minister CN Annadurai. The 1971 general election witnessed several personality-centric songs such as Naangu kodi Makkalukku Thalaivan (Leader of four crore people) to glorify the then Chief Minister Karunanidhi. Later, the airing of tracks singing glories of personalities became normal after MGR floated AIADMK and contested elections. Now, all leaders want the tracks to sing only their glories instead of highlighting the ideologies of the party, he underlined.Some of the famous songs and punch dialogues of DMK & AIADMK1967DMK: Oodivarugiran Udhayasooriyan (Rising sun is running to us), Azhaikkindrar Anna(Anna invites)1977DMK : Kallakudikonda Karunanidhi Vazhgave (Long live Karunanidhi, who won through protests in Kallakudi)1980AIADMK: What sin did I commit?

Although the extent of duty collected through a 2% levy will add up to around $55 million annually, the damage will be assessed by the USTR as part of the investigation. Experts believe it is bad optics considering that India the US are strategic allies but are yet to clinch a deal to sort out earlier action and retaliatory measures.The action came days after Catharine Tai was sworn in as the new USTR and had a virtual meeting with commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal . Last year, US had started a probe against India and several other countries for imposing DST.Exporters are cautious on their assessment. ""If the US goes ahead with the move, it will have a dampening effect on Indian exports. It is discriminatory tariff, especially when Indian exporters are competing with others for the same products. But the impact will depend on the extent of the duty imposed. If it is 2-3%, exporter may be able to absorb it. But it will sure hurt them if the tariff is 15-20%,"" said Ajay Sahai, director general of Federation of Indian Export Organisations .Others are seeking a multilateral solution to the issues, something that is being debated at international forums such as OECD. ""While Retaliatory tariffs can hamper the interests of SMEs and consumers both in India and US, a possible action by India will create a rollerball effect. Tax challenges in digital economies are not just limited to India but will involve many countries soon, and hence a multilateral approach by the way of dialogues should be considered,"" industry lobby group Trade Promotion Council of India said.The USTR move reiterates that countries do not change their policies despite the change of leadership, said trade experts.Given the tough bargain that US is known for, it is unlikely to settle for a deal without extracting concessions in return, especially when the finance ministry , which had imposed the levy, has failed to convince India's key trading partner on the issue.For the last two years or so, India is hoping to address US concerns, ranging from price control on medical devices IPR to e-commerce and export promotion schemes, while also negotiating a deal that will see both countries open up their markets for each other for products ranging from apple to technology products.","Govt, exporters hope USTR goes slow on retaliatory levy",RICE

But races are so close, with timings measured in thousandth of a second.And it is a young flyer's game.Lightning-fast reflexes, visual sharpness and hours of training are the key to success, according to Kang.He says he is already facing physical decline as a new generation of younger rivals arrives, some of them still in primary school.""Those qualities are the best in your early- to mid-teenage years,"" said the still pimply-faced pilot.Kang said his reflexes were ""inevitably"" slowing with each passing year, and he was not ruling out retirement before turning 20.It will be ""pretty tough to compete against them in my adult years,"" he said.""I think I may not make it past this year.""One 12-year-old girl already has him in her sights.""When I first met Kang Chang-hyeon, I was in awe of him and it felt like a dream,"" said Jeong Ryeo-won, after taking part in a league round in the southern county of Hadong.But now she ""really wants"" to beat him: ""He is my role model, so I hope to compete against him at the world championships , but win.""Only three years after first flying a toy drone, Kang, at age 16, took the world title at a 2019 championship in China, where South Korean pilots dominated.""Maintaining composure is key to winning because a split-second decision can determine the outcome of a race,"" he said.""Minimising your mistakes while staying calm regardless of who's ahead of you is critical.""Kang's high school in rural Hongseong county has sought to capitalise on his success by promoting itself as a specialist drone school -- with Kang as its ambassador -- offering lessons in piloting to attract more pupils.But the coronavirus pandemic deprived him of the chance to defend his crown at the peak of his abilities, when the Swiss-based Federation Aeronautique Internationale, the world governing body for air sports, was forced to cancel the 2020 world championships.""I could have competed really well last year,"" he said.Like other young South Korean men achieving global success, from pop stars BTS to Spurs striker Son Heung-min , compulsory military service weighs on his path.South Korea remains technically at war with nuclear-armed North Korea , and all able-bodied South Korean males must spend around 18 months in the forces before they turn 30.The only exceptions are for Olympic medallists and Asian Games champions, along with the winners of some international classical music competitions.But Kang's skills could be of ""great value"" for the armed forces, said his coach Kim Jae-hong, who led the national team at the 2019 world championships.South Korea's 555,000-strong military is heavily outnumbered by North Korea's 1.28 million troops.But the South enjoys technological superiority including, according to the defence ministry , a fleet of around 800 drones for training and experimental combat purposes.""The drone units' monitoring mission is basically based on controlling a drone with a camera live feed, which is the same for drone racing,"" the coach said.""Kang and other racers can contribute greatly to its mission while maintaining their drone-control skills.""",Top flight: South Korea's 18-year-old world drone champion,RICE

My paternal grandmother, Lydia Gomez, was the one who made the Indri appam (or Pesaha appam) and kurukku, which is also called pesaha paal, says Marina, a popular cookery instructor and blogger settled in Bengaluru.Myriad optionsAs with all things food, each region and Christian denomination in Kerala has its own flavours for Lent. What is common is the simple food that is usually served on Maundy Thursday and Good Friday after the church service is over. While it is invariably kanji (rice porridge) and payar (green mung) on Good Friday, on Maundy Thursday it is the Pesaha appam, an unleavened bread made of rice flour that is cooked in many Christian households all over Kerala.Pesaha appam or kurishappam | Photo Credit: Ammu Elizabeth JohnLent is a period of fasting, prayers and abstinence for many Christian families. Although Easter eggs and bunnies are getting increasingly popular, many families continue the tradition of making or buying Pesaha appams. Although we make Easter eggs, cakes and hot cross buns, what is much in demand is the Indri appam that is served on the day of Maundy Thursday, says Reina Thomas, one of the partners of Square One Homemade Treats, a popular bakery in Thiruvananthapuram.Marina says that since cakes are easier to make, many of the ethnic snacks that were traditionally made during the Holy Week have been forgotten as they involve a great deal of time consuming, laborious stirring and cooking, mostly with rice flour. To keep the tradition going, Marina makes it a point to make the Indri appam every year.Traditional treats St. Michels Bakery, Bread Fort, Ambrosia and Square One Home Treats make the hot cross buns that many of us are familiar with because of the popular nursery rhyme about it. Michel David, proprietor of St. Michels Bakery, makes both hot cross buns and hot cross bread. He says there is a clientle for it as some families have the buns or the bread with milk on Maundy Thursday. It is available on Wednesday and Thursday at the different outlets of the bakery.Prasobhithan S says Bread Fort will also be making about 20 to 25 hot cross buns and different kinds of breads for Maundy Thursday. As Square One Homemade Treats will be closed from Thursday for Easter, their hot cross buns and pesaha appam will be available on Wednesday.Preethi Abraham, a home cook, recalls that during her childhood in Ranni, Pathanamthitta, the service on Maundy Thursday used to be early in the morning at around 3 am. The Indri appam, made with rice flour and urad dal, was steamed, either in leaves like an ela ada or in a vessel. The Cross that we got for Palm Sunday is pressed into the middle. In the evening, after prayers, the eldest in the family would bless the appam, cut it and serve it to the others for dinner. It is dipped into a syrup that we called kuruma, also called paal in some places. The paal is made with jaggery and coconut milk, says Preethi. Nowadays, Preethi cooks the paal and a friend of hers makes the appam and they share it.Wayanad-based Babu Stephen, son of YouTuber Annamma Pulivelil aka Annamma chedathi (Annammachedathi Special) explains that in their parish, the Indri appam is steamed in banana leaves while the Pesaha appam is called Kurishu appam as it has the palm leaf cross embedded in the middle.Pesaha appam (unleavened bread) and paal are made on Maundy Thursday in many Christian homes in Kerala | Photo Credit: Bindu JoyTraditions prevailAll my siblings, and our children gather at our house since my mother stays with us. After prayers, it is the kurishu appam, made with a little sugar, that is cut by the eldest in the family and shared amongst all of us. Usually, after the service, this sharing of food was done in the church. This time, in accordance with the COVID-19 protocol, all of us in our parish have been told to conduct the prayers at home after the service, says Babu.Hot cross buns | Photo Credit: PexelsIn many homes in Kollam, the dough, made of rice flour, coconut and jaggery, is filled in vayana leaves (bay leaves) folded into cones and steamed, says Jessie Ignatius, a former school teacher from Kollam. However, my mother in Thrissur used to make pulikatha appam (unfermented appam) made without yeast. It is made with rice, urad dal, shallots and coconut and made as soon as the mixture was ground. My mother used to make the kurukku with rice powder, coconut milk, jaggery, a bit of ghee and roasted cumin. I used to love the flavour of the cumin in the kurukku, she says.Marina says that some people might add a bit of jaggery to the Pesaha appam and that gives it a brownish tone. And the paal could be seasoned with cardamom too. Kalathappam, a bread made in a pot, is also made on Maundy Thursday by some families. Made of rice flour and lightly spiced, there were fried shallots and coconut in it, she says.The flavouring agents and the names might differ but not the solemnity of the occasion when families break bread together for Maundy Thursday, symbolising the Last Supper of Jesus Christ.Recipe of Pesaha AppamIngredientsRice powder: 1 cupUrad dal: 3 table spoonCoconut grated: 1 cupGarlic: 1Small onion: 2Jeera: a pinchWater: 1 to 1 cupsMethodSoak urad dal for 30 minutes and grind it into a smooth paste by adding little water. Grind coconut (don't grind the coconut to fine paste) with garlic, small onion and jeera with little water. Add salt and boil water and when it starts boiling add rice powder, little at a time and mix well. Now add the dal mixture and coconut mixture and mix well. Transfer the batter to a greased pan and place a cross made with palm leaves. Now steam for 20 minutes. Cool it and transfer to the serving dish.How to make paalMelt jaggery (200 gm) with water and strain it. Add the thick coconut milk (4 cups) and stir for few seconds, don't let it boil.

2021-04-01,https://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2021/apr/01/writer-painter-indomitable-fighter-mamata-banerjee-faces-her-biggestpolitical-challenge-at-nandig-2284381.html,"By ANINANDIGRAM: Mamata Banerjee, the indomitable fighter clad in a white sari, is a writer, poet and painter who had ended the decades-long rule of the Left Front but after two successive terms faces a major challenge to her political career.Striving to prove that ""Bangla nijer meyekei chaye"" (Bengal wants its own daughter), she continues her stride in the political spectrum of the nation that began in 1975 making the headlines by dancing on the car of the most influential leaders of that time Jayaprakash Narayan as a mark of protest.Forty-six years have passed since then; her fighting spirits continue to shine in Indian politics. She is 'Nation's Didi' Mamata Banerjee.She became the chief minister of West Bengal in 2011 by ending the 34-year-long CPI(M) regime, one of the longest-serving elected governments in the world. Now after ruling the state for two successive terms, the 2021 poll battle is surely not a cakewalk for her. It is the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) that trespassed her dominion after gaining overwhelming results from the state in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. And, the emergence of the Left-Congress-ISF alliance has made the situation more complicated for her.Banerjee endorses her governance as the rule of three 'M's, that is, 'Maa', 'Mati' and 'Manush' (mother, soil and people). But, the Bengal elections have another 3M factor this time, that is, 'Mamata', 'Modi' and 'Muslim'. So, Banerjee's challenge is to counter Prime Minister Narendra Modi's popularity in Bengal at one side and regain her support base of the minority community that might step out with the Left-Congress-ISF alliance.Now making the battle of power more interesting, Mamata has chosen Nandigram over her home turf Bhabanipur seat this time to test her fate in the 2021 elections. It was the agitation in Nandigram and Singur against the Left government's land acquisition policies that made Mamata Banerjee the Chief Minister of West Bengal.Now not just Bengal, but the country's eye is on Nandigram that will witness the most high-profile contest on April 1 with the chief minister taking on her former ministerial colleague Suvendu Adhikari, who had joined the BJP in December last year.Further, Banerjee's poll campaign this time got a new dimension with a wheelchair after she suffered an injury earlier this month while campaigning in Nandigram.Not to mention, the West Bengal Chief Minister spared no poll stage to launch scathing attacks on Prime Minister Modi. However, the Modi-Mamata battle was quite visible even before the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. She played an instrumental role in bringing together all opposition parties against the Centre prior to the 2019 general elections. The seventh-term MP also has been among the first key figures who heavily criticised the central government in issues starting from demonetisation to Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and lockdown to fuel prices. Her fighting spirit and mass appeal have made her one the tallest opposition figures in the current political arena.Mamata Banerjee started her political career as a Youth Congress worker in the 1970s. She quickly rose the ranks and became the general secretary of Mahila Congress and later All India Youth Congress. In 1984 she was elected as a member of parliament in the 8th Lok Sabha becoming one of India's youngest parliamentarians. She founded the All India Trinamool Congress in 1997 after a disagreement with Congress.Mamata Banerjee worked with three Prime Ministers including PV Narasimha Rao, Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Dr Manmohan Singh. She had been a Union Minister in both National Democratic Alliance (NDA) and United Progressive Alliance (UPA) governments and held portfolios like Human Resource Development, Youth Affairs and Sports, Women and Child Development, Coal and Mines and the Railways. Notably, she was the first woman to become a railway minister in the country. The Time Magazine named her among the 100 most influential people in the world in 2012.Hailing from a lower-middle-class family, Mamata Banerjee worked as a milk booth vendor to battle poverty. Her father passed away due to the lack of treatment when she was just 17. The fighter in her never let the barriers dominate her. She continued her education and earned a Bachelor's degree in History, a Master's degree in Islamic History and degrees in Education and Law from the University of Calcutta. She also worked as a stenographer and a private tutor before joining full-time politics.Another disposition of Mamata Banerjee is her minimalist lifestyle. Despite being the Chief Minister, she still lives in her ancestral terracotta-tiled roof house at Kolkata's Harish Chatterjee Street. White cotton sarees having mono-colour borders and slippers are all that define the fashion statement of Mamata Banerjee.The West Bengal Chief Minister is also a self-taught painter, poet and writer. She has authored more than 100 books. She is also tech-savvy and remains active on social media. The Trinamool Supremo is also known for her walkathons or marches. Here it needs to be mentioned that she walks five-six kilometres on a treadmill every day. When it comes to evening snack time, she likes to have tea, puffed rice and 'aloo chop'.The second phase of the West Bengal Assembly polls is scheduled for April 1. In phase-II, 30 seats covering a segment of South 24 Parganas, Bankura, Purba Medinipur and Paschim Medinipur will go to polls to decide the fate of 171 candidates including 19 women.Meanwhile, the first phase of the West Bengal Assembly elections concluded with an estimated 79.79 per cent voter turnout on Saturday.In the first phase, 30 seats covering all Assembly constituencies from the districts of Purulia and Jhargram and a segment of Bankura, Purba Medinipur and Paschim Medinipur went to polls.","Writer, painter, indomitable fighter Mamata Banerjee faces her biggest political challenge at Nandigram",RICE
2021-04-01,https://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2021/apr/01/suvendu-adhikari-vs-mamata-banerjee-nandigram-talking-point-across-bengal-2284175.html,"Santwana Bhattacharya ByExpress News ServiceBOLPUR/SUIRI/RAMPURHAT,BIRBHUM: Mamata Banerjee lit up Nandigram with a slogan that perhaps encapsulates where West Bengal is right now, in terms of the gap between its reality and its desire. Cool cool Trinamool, thanda thanda cool, vote paabe jora phool, she thundered, with an elan that TV advertising professionals would envy. Jora phool is the grass flower associated with the West Bengal Chief Ministers party, the Trinamool. Will it get the votes? Therein hangs a tale.Now, West Bengal may well be renamed Nandigram. You must of course overlook a few distractions like Amit Shah claiming a clean sweep, in arid Purulia. Or Mamata Banerjee actually demanding that the PMs visa and passport be cancelled for having visited Orakandi in Bangladesh. Those distractions are quite a handful for an Assembly election, you think? Yes. But then, this is West Bengal.A little detour: Orakandi is revered by the Matua community, quite a vital component of the voters in three Bengal districts. Nobody here, among the intelligentsia, quite likes the fact that the name of caste has been taken. Bengals politics has always avoided it. And thats the BJPs opening. Bengal still speaks a universal language. It still responds to resonating phrases like Amar Naam, Tomar Naam, Nandigram, Nandigram...Thats not just a slogan, by the way. Kolkata, Howrah, Hooghly, Burdwan, Birbhum, 24 Parganasdistricts which vote in the third and fourth phases or later seem somewhat indifferent about what happens to their own constituencies. But theyre not indifferent about Nandigram. Anywhere and everywhere, its difficult to get people focused on any other issue. The small talk all around the small tea shops, the small man walking back after his days work in those rich rice fields invariably focuses on that one thing.Its the Big Fight. The questions are: Is Didi panicking? Will Suvendu Adhikari pull it off ? Will Nandigram again be the turning point of Bengals political history? Its quite the local thriller. If you so much as mildly declare that you have been to the epicentre and have come out in one piece, you may very well get a discount at a sweet shop, or at Sonajuri haat, Santiniketan.Old stories form part of new narrativeWhat did you see there? Tell us, please. You can pay me later! Dulal Basak, with that incredulous look on his face, could be the face of the rest of Bengal. He has that look of having accidentally met an astronaut just back from the moon.Myths abound. That the Adhikaris virtually own Nandigram. That Didi is liberating it the second time over. Or just the opposite: that TMC atrocities have touched such heights that only the BJP can save the people. Nandigram, seven years since the violence against that old farmland acquisition felled even a Left government, is back haunting public memory.For all the contrary feelings that thought may evoke, its also influencing voting decisions across districts. Perhaps not even the voter knows where her finger may pass, such are the sentiments here. Its rich political drama.Even the long-forgotten Laxman Seth, the erstwhile CPI-M MLA, the villain of the piece in 2007, under whose watch the police firing took place in which over a dozen got killed in 2007, the man you could arguably blame for the Lefts near comatose state in Indiaeven he has come out of the woodwork. And hes not even contesting, but thats half the story.Now, Laxman Seth was called a harmand (goon) those days, maybe not without reason. And he was not heard of after a failed attempt to revive his political career in 2019, when he contested the Tamluk parliamentary seat on a Congress ticket. Congress? Yes. The CPI-M had expelled him in 2014, and he had then joined the BJP, before his compass shifted again. Tamluk is his old fort, the place where hed defeated Sisir Adhikari in 2004. No relation to Suvendu, you ask? Of course, hes the father, also old Congress stock, was MoS for rural development by the way under Manmohan Singh.Why are these old stories important? Because theyre part of the narrative in 2021. Its not so much party politics, as much as the underlying economic issues. Laxman Seth has been giving interviews. And been touching a chord with a rural Bengal that, contrarily, also wants industrialisation. A Bengal that doesnt want to go to Kerala and Bangalore just to have a job.All political parties are the same. When they first come to power, they make promises of a better system, but later the same bad elements come to rule the roost, says Ranjit Das, a voter in Bolpur constituency in Birbhum. He cites the Nandigram trajectory and draws parallels with the local politics in his constituency.This disillusionment is commonly heard in and around the Visva Bharati campus, perhaps even more keenly in the crafts markets adjacent to Santiniketan. The artisanal markets that dot the now burgeoning campus city may have only an ironic resemblance with things that Tagore said. The poet is mostly to be found caged in photo frames, sold at every street corner. He wanted the world to come to the country. In a way, the country wants the same.The elections themselves are a local Mahabharataa distraction, almost. Who has joined whom? Thats the talk everywhere. The protagonists of Nandigram or the general trend of TMC MLAs and other sundry heavyweights switching camps, thats what everyone talks about. This is the place that gave India Mir Jafar.If Purba Medinipurof which Nandigram is one of the 16 Assembly constituencies is seen as Adhikari turf, Birbhums 11 Assembly constituencies are considered a stronghold of the TMC. If Suvendu, and his father Sisir in particular, have a deep hold over that neck of the woods, Birbhum is the playfield of TMC district in charge Anubrata Mandal, a local toughie.The Adhikharis were perceived to be the last word in their bastion, while they were in TMC Mamata allowed their writ to run. (Its just coincidental that they happen to be on the other side now.) But that federal approach is true about Birbhum too, they say. Whether in Rampur, Siuri or Santiniketan, the refrain is that shes too indulgent of  Anubrata Mandal. In short, what the Adhikaris are or were to Nandigram, Mandal is to Birbhum. Not a leaf moves without him raising his finger, they say.Didis allegation that it was the Adhikaris who got the police in chappals into Nandigram in 2007 and thats what led to the mayhemfinds odd resonance here. Its almost a mythological narrative that gets repeated everywhere. Facts? They belong to another planet. Myths have a self-sustaining life of their own. There are stories about how many got killed, about dead children filled into sacks, about truckloads of dead bodies hidden under vegetables. The mass hysteria around has been reignited, in different ways.Didi allows Anubrata to manage this outpost in the same way, quips a Visva Bharati lecturer, who would rather not be named. The current V-C here, Bidyut Chakrabarty, makes no secret of his support to the BJP and the Prime Minister. Its fairly overt. But theres tangible tension on the ground. Its often, but not necessarily party-related.The young, for one, have no qualms at all. Deepak, a biotech student from the nearby Puralia, feels a change would be good for Bengalit would bring industry and jobs. We dont want to go out of the state to look for employment. Bengal should be an industrial leader again. We cant be doing artisanal work or cottage industry like our parents for all time. Theres no future in small scale, he says. Maybe Mahatma Gandhi should have been alive to hear his idea of paribartan.Birbhum is of course a TMC fortress, controlled by Mandal with an iron fist. Everyone agrees its impregnable. But local street cred is not the only factor. The CAA is an issue here, and it gives the TMC a fillip. Both the Hindus who migrated from then East Bengal and the original Muslim settlers here cite the Assam NRC fiasco. We may also be thrown out or our names may go missing! Most of us dont have old papers, says Subhas. Its not about religion here, as the national narrative goes, but about the precarity of life that all have faced equally.The students at Kalabhavan still have a whiff of Left idealism, and have their own story to tellone of resistance, and of standing to safeguard Bengals cultural ethos. Anirban Ganguly, the BJP Bolpur candidate, rubbishes those as wayward western thoughts. Tagore? Keep him to a side. Our central leaders have closely studied culture and thought process, claims Ganguly.Thats where the aspirational middle class is, even if theyre not big in numbers. One of them, an old neighbour of TMCs Anubrata Mandal, predicts that the BJP will get 4 out of 11 seats here, and three more after the elections are over! Khela hobe, he quips.",Suvendu Adhikari vs Mamata Banerjee: Nandigram talking point across Bengal,RICE

The APERC has fixed a deficit of Rs 7,433.80 crore for the three Discoms thus avoiding a burden of Rs 4,307.38 crore on consumers.The Average Cost of Service (ACoS) has been reduced from Rs 7.17 to Rs 6.37 per unit as per the APERC approvals. The State government has agreed to bear a subsidy burden of Rs 7,297.08 crore pertaining to agriculture consumers eligible for free supply of power and dhobi ghats for the financial year 2021-22.In order to maintain uniform tariff across the State, the government has also agreed to bear a subsidy of Rs 136.72 crore arising due to concessional tariff extended to domestic consumers of APEPDCL, he said.The APERC had accepted the proposal of Discoms to collect Rs 10 per kW a month from domestic consumers in lieu of minimum charges. The decision will benefit all the domestic consumers who do not consume energy in any given month on the one side and generate a moderate additional revenue to the Discoms from the consumers who consume energy on the other side, he said.Justice Nagarjuna Reddy said they rejected the proposal of Discoms to bill apartment consumers under a single point HT connection as it will create problems for the middle class apartment dwellers.The proposal to remove fixed charges (Rs 100/kW/month) for function halls was accepted. The proposal to change the present peak Time of Day (6 am to 10 am) to 4 am to 8 am was rejected as it will effectively reduce off peak time by 2 hours for industries, he said.Existing rice mills and pulverisers are given one more opportunity to avail the benefit of getting billed under LT tariff up to a connected load of 150 HP against the present limit of 100 HP, the APERC Chairman said.Average unit price reduced to Rs 6.37 from Rs 7.17The Andhra Pradesh Electricity Regulatory Commission has fixed a deficit of Rs 7,433.80 crore for the three Discoms in the State thus avoiding a burden of Rs 4,307.38 crore on power consumers.

The sun sets and a refreshing breeze blows through Thekkinkadu Maidan, the heart of Thrissur city. High-mast lamps illuminate the park. The hundreds of elders and youngsters, who gather there after a hectic day, discuss current affairs like rising fuel prices, the impact of Covid on trade and, of course, politics. Thrissur, the constituency, is witnessing a high-profile, three-cornered fight among UDFs Padmaja Venugopal, NDAs Suresh Gopi and LDFs P Balachandran.As poll campaigning reached a crescendo on Tuesday, the discussions revolved around election trends. BJPs slogan: We are giving Thrissur to you, was also a topic.Will it happen? The opinions are divided. One thing is sure, that Suresh Gopi is making waves in the constituency and even if he doesnt win, he can make or mar the chances of his rivals.ITI instructor Rajan said, It is a three-cornered fight and LDFs vote share will come down to 45,000 from 53,000 polled by V S Sunil Kumar in 2016. Forward caste votes will get divided between Padmaja and Suresh Gopi. NDA will poll 35,000 riding on the Suresh Gopi factor and UDF vote share will come down. LDF candidate P Balachandran can win with traditional Left votes.Though P Balachandran may not get personal votes, the goodwill created by the government through welfare schemes may aid him. People from marginalised sections survived the lockdown with the food kits distributed by the government, said Jose Kuriachira, who had to discontinue his gold wholesale business due to the loss incurred during the lockdown.Prabhakaran, a trader at Kuttimukku, differs. There is no Pinarayi wave. Whatever PR exercise you conduct, people can judge for themselves. UDF will come to power in state. Padmaja will win, he said.In another corner, Sreejith and Sivadas, both computer service personnel, are discussing Suresh Gopis prospects. There is a chance for him as he is known to have supported the poor using his MP fund, said Sreejith.They talk about food kits and rice only. Is it the right development model? We need more industries. Suresh Gopi helped many people through charity and by facilitating their return from West Asian countries in Vande Bharat flights. It will not be a surprise if he wins, said Sivadas.Autorickshaw driver Johnson said odds are in Padmajas favour. She is familiar here and voters sentiments towards her father K Karunakaran is a factor. However, there is a change in BJPs favour among upper class Christians, Though known as a UDF bastion, the family of Karunakaran has unpleasant memories in Thrissur.Karunakaran was defeated by V V Raghavan in the 1996 Lok Sabha elections while his son K Muraleedharan lost in 1998. Padmaja was defeated by V S Sunil Kumar in 2016 from Thrissur.Therambil Ramakrishnan represented Thrissur for five terms and Thrissur stood with my father even when he lost in 1996. People here know me and cannot be fooled through food kits. Suresh Gopi will get only BJP votes, said Padmaja.Projects implemented by Sunil Kumar as MLA to address issues like drinking water and infrastructure will work in LDFs favour. The poor who are struggling to tide over lockdown blues cannot be fooled by raising the Sabarimala issue, said Balachandran. Suresh Gopi urged voters to choose NDA to ensure happiness, peace and protection of rights. If you think NDA will need time to take the reins of power, cast your votes to transform BJP into a corrective force in the state, he told voters at Thiruvambady.Activist K Venu, a former Naxalite, feels Padmaja has an edge in the battle. Though Balachandran is known among party workers, he is not as popular as Sunil Kumar. The governments welfare measures have influenced marginalised sections. However, it would be the 10% neutral votes that prove crucial in Thrissur, he said.With campaigning set to end soon, the three fronts are leaving no stone unturned to attract voters.

If one party promises monthly assistance of Rs 1,000 to women household heads, there is a counter offer of Rs 1,500. It goes on. The result is people started having a mindset that they could make a living out of freebies,"" a Division Bench of Justices N Kirubakaran and B Pugalendhi said.A trend has been created that whoever avails loan from banks does not repay them, expecting waiver of loans during election.In this way, people themselves get corrupted by the political parties.The way in which the parties throw their promises, which are unreasonable and unworkable, are really unwanted.""Unfortunately, freebies are not connected with job creation, development, or agriculture. Voters are lured to cast votes in their favour by these magical promises. Once in 5 years, this tamasha is being continued for decades together. Promises have always remained as promises. Most of them except freebies are not implemented,"" it said.The Bench noted that every candidate has to shell out about Rs 20 crore in the election, as many of the people have become corrupt by selling their votes for one or a few thousands, biriyani and liquor.""It is a stark reality. If that is so, how could the people expect good leaders. Do people, who sell their votes, have any moral right to question their leaders,"" the Bench wondered.The judges opined that if money spent for freebies is utilised constructively by creating job opportunities, building infrastructure like dams and lakes and better facilities and incentives to the agriculture, which has become an 'orphan' in the country as most of the people have quit it as it does not provide a secure income, definitely, there will be social uplift and progress of the State.The political parties should be prohibited or prevented from giving election promises, which are capable of adding burden on the public exchequer, especially, the State facing a financial crunch, it said.Otherwise, for the sake of finance, the State has to increase the number of liquor shops.Every political party is bound to make promises to voters giving their social policies and plans for improving the standard of living of the people by providing clean governance, infrastructure, especially, providing basic amenities like water, transportation and health.But, the promises made by the political parties are aimed at clinching power, it said.In addition to colour televisions, laptops, mixers, fans and grinders among others, every family cardholder in the State is given 20 kgs of rice free every month.That apart, during festival seasons like Pongal and Diwali, public money is drained.In fact, the celebrations are being taken care of by the government by providing free dhoties, sarees and items necessary for cooking and making pongal and expenses for celebrations.""These kinds of freebies and money given during festivals, though it would be justified that the government is taking care of the people's needs, in fact are making the people lazy and dampening their working culture,"" it said ""In the process, the honest tax-payer is made a mute spectator of these expenditures by the government,"" it said.Consequently, even for any normal work, no force is available in Tamil Nadu and it has to depend on the migrant workers from northeast and northern states like Manipur, Meghalaya, Assam, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal and Odisha, the Bench said.Most of the North Indian workers are employed in agriculture work, hotels, industries, shops and saloons in Tamil Nadu.""It is not as if everyone in Tamil Nadu have become an entrepreneur or persons with resources and if we go into details, most of the persons including the wealthy are expecting freebies,"" the court said.The way in which things are happening today, one would not be surprised to see that migrant workers would be owners of the properties in due course and the sons of the soil will become workers working under them.It may be the only achievement, probably, the political parties have attained through election promises by providing freebies for the past 20 years, the judges said.","Stop freebies, create infrastructural facilities: Madras High Court",RICE

Speaking to TNIE, a senior officer in the Commissionerate of Civil Supplies said, The welfare kit distribution for the month of April will start on Tuesday and the exercise is expected to be completed by this weekend, he said.Whether politics over the kits has helped the ruling dispensation politically or not, the distribution was one of the mammoth special drives carried out by the department that evoked huge public interest. On average, 84 lakh families bought the kits distributed by the government through ration shops every month from April 2020.In the beginning, it was the survival kit during lockdown, which was followed by the Onam kit, and then the welfare kit in the following months. If 18 types of grocery worth Rs 1,000 were in each survival kit, the welfare kit had around 10 items worth Rs 500. The last kit will have 14 items due to Easter and Vishu festivals and it will mark the end of the year-long kit distribution.The kit also courted controversy during Onam after jaggery and pappad distributed through the kits were found to be of inferior quality. Later, the companies which supplied the groceries had to face legal issues and fine. The state had spent around Rs 4,198 crore for the distribution of kits, including money from the Chief Ministers Distress Relief Fund. It was widely acknowledged that the kits distributed by the LDF government helped the front romp home during the last local body elections following which the government decided to extend the kit distribution till April 2021.The government had made arrangements also to distribute special rice to non-priority ration card-holders (blue and white cards), but it was halted by the Election Commission following a complaint by the Opposition leader stating that it was in violation of the model code of conduct. However, the High Court on Monday stayed the Election Commission order.BAG OF CONTENT",LDF govt’s last food kits to be given away by weekend,RICE

After the Congress passed the Quit India resolution on August 8, 1942, 10,000 people marched to the Nandigram police station on September 30, 1942, to hoist the Tricolour there.The British troops fired at them, killing eight. Dictionary of Martyrs Indias Freedom Struggle (1857-1947) Vol 4, published by the ministry of culture and the Indian Council of Historical Research, unveiled by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on March 7, 2019, mentioned the eight martyrs, including Sheikh Alauddin (40), who was actively participating in the Quit India movement. Ajim Baksh and Sheikh Abdul, who were arrested and sentenced to imprisonment, died in Midnapore jail.Tamluk, along with adjoining areas, were the only pocket in the entire country to gain independence from the British twice  once after the Quit India movement and again, on August 15, 1947, said Raj Sekhar Basu, historian and professor of modern Indian history, caste movement and history of medicine at Calcutta University.The undivided Midnapore, then a Congress stronghold, witnessed mass mobilisation during Civil Disobedience Movement in the early 1930s and Union Board Boycott Movement in early 1920s. The movements continued there for almost five years even after it lost steam in other parts of the country. This is because the leaders there hailed from the grassroots. The working class was suffering due to several restrictions, like free movement of boats and people that impacted residents livelihoods, said Basu.Now, parties were attempting to divide the people of Nandigram on religious lines to gain votes, experts said. Nandigram has always been a hub of cultivation of rice and vegetables, which explains the high population of Muslims there. Some Muslims are also weavers by profession. Nandigram is also a centre of Baishnabs. When the police entered Nandigram in March 2007, there were special azaans from the mosques and prayers by Baishnabs. The farmers, irrespective of their religions, have always been united in Nandigram.

Why not whip up a batch of Easter eggs with your loved ones? Experts share tips for first-timersFrom pretty pastel marzipan shades to velvety chocolate hues and everything in between, there is a childlike wonder to receiving Easter eggs. It really does not matter if they are elaborately designed or just wrapped in shiny tin foil, the anticipation of being gifted one is well worth the wait.The fact you get them just at this time of year, makes them all the more desirable. Every other delicacy and baked delight can be conjured up at birthdays or Christmas or any other special occasion  except Easter eggs.Easter eggs by Sris Cake Lab in Bengaluru | Photo Credit: Special arrangementAnd while egg-shaped chocolates with little toys inside can be bought off the shelf any day of the year now, there is still a lot of fun to be had in making your own Easter eggs. They may not look perfect the first time round, but the glorious mess and lingering aroma of hot chocolate or the sticky sweetness of marzipan that goes into fashioning one, will have you at it till you get it right.Though the process seems pretty straightforward, there are some directions you must keep in mind to achieve the desired ovoid result.First, the basicsYou will need: Cooking chocolate, food thermometer, candy treatsTo begin with, one needs to melt chocolate to the right temperature. Called tempering, this step is needed to keep the chocolate smooth and glossy and more importantly, to keep it from melting easily; a big plus when fashioning an Easter egg.So how do you temper chocolate? Firstly, never heat chocolate directly. Put two-thirds of your cooking chocolate in a bowl and hold it over a saucepan of boiling water. Keep stirring till it melts. Take it away from the heat and add the rest of the chocolate, all the while stirring so it melts too.Easter eggs by Sris Cake Lab in BengaluruMake sure you use a food thermometer while tempering chocolate. It will break easily if the consistency is not right, says Sunita Rebecca, a home baker from Hyderabad.Ideally, the temperature of the chocolate should not exceed 120F for dark chocolate or 105F for milk or white chocolate.Sounds tiresome? Rohit Thomas Kadicheeni of Silvis Creations, Kochi, recommends that first timers use compound chocolate instead of cooking chocolate, as it does not need tempering.It doesnt melt so fast either, making it easier to work with. Melt it, set it and your egg is done, he says.However, he does warn against trying to melt a bar of store-bought chocolate. It would need tempering too, he cautions.Next, smear the melted chocolate on the insides of a mould with a basting brush. If you do not have a brush, swirl the chocolate around the insides of the mould and remove the excess.If you dont have a mould, reuse a Kinder Joy casing or any other rounded object to make your eggs, says Meena Faszer, a home baker from Bengaluru. Online tutorials advocate the use of balloons for the same purpose.Next, refrigerate the mould for 10-15 minutes till the chocolate solidifies. Apply another layer of chocolate and refrigerate for another 10-15 minutes. Repeat the process for a third coat.Remember, the more layers you have, the stronger the egg shell.Once you are done with the layering process, ease the egg halves out of the moulds.Oiling the moulds before you begin makes this step easier and gives your egg shell a glossy finish. Fill one half of your egg with smaller sweet treats.Place the other half on a warm surface, just enough to melt the edges a bit and then glue both the halves together.Voila! And there you have it  your very first Easter egg!Easter eggs by Sris Cake Lab in BengaluruOnce you have a number of eggs ready, decorating them is a fun family pastime  whether you are icing shapes or names on them or just getting them basket ready, says Meena.You can decorate your eggs with melted chocolate or icing sugar. White chocolate or milk chocolate stands out if you are writing something on the egg, though you can use the same chocolate base for simple decorative designs. (It is also a great way to use up any extra melted chocolate).You can use icing sugar paste that can be coloured for brighter designs. Just fill up a piping bag and use different nozzles to make a variety of patterns.If you dont have a piping bag: Find a small plastic bag that is of a sturdy quality, roughly about the size of your palms. Fill it halfway with your icing of choice. Squeeze the filling to a corner of the plastic bag, giving it a conical shape and secure the opening with a rubber band or tape.Finally, cut the tip of the cone  you now have a home made piping bag. Keep in mind the surface area you will be working on. Snipping out a biggish piece of the corner will leave you with a lot of icing gushing out; which might be difficult to manage on a small egg.If you are fairly confident of your skills and/or have a steady hand, you can also roll up butter paper or parchment paper into a cone and use it instead of a piping bag.If not chocolate...Easter eggs can be made with marshmallows too, says Sunita Rebecca. Melt marshmallows and add crushed rice Krispies to the mix and you get a pliable, colourful medium you can use to shape eggs.Rice cereal is required to bring stiffness to the melted marshmallows, which would otherwise be too runny to use.Moisten your hands with water or dab butter on your palms to make the moulding easier, advises Sunita.According to Srivatsan S of Sris Cake Lab, Bengaluru, Marzipan is a great medium to make Easter eggs as you can use a lot of colours on them. Srivatsan, who has been creating themed Easter eggs this season, uses cashew paste instead of the traditional almond paste for his marzipan.You have to realise this is a very delicate material and an oily substance as well, so dont be discouraged if it doesnt turn out well the first few times. Youll eventually get the hang of it, he says.Once you do, it is almost as versatile as edible play dough, and can be moulded into any shape on its own without casings.Though marzipan eggs are not hollow, Srivatsan says people have been known to customise them by placing useful items like stationery instead of candy inside. Once you have your fillings decided, all that is left is icing. Pour some icing sugar into a piping bag and just have fun!",Make your own chocolate eggs this Easter,RICE

In the kharif marketing season (KMS) last year, the total paddy procurement was 53.31 lakh tonne.Expecting a bumper harvest of paddy, the government had set an ambitious target to procure 71 lakh tonne of paddy during 2020-21 KMS. It had fixed a target to procure 48 lakh tonne of rice (equivalent to 71 lakh tonne of paddy) for 2020-21.The State Cabinet had approved a target of 37 lakh tonne rice (equivalent to 54 lakh tonne paddy) for kharif season and 11 lakh tonne of rice (equivalent to 17 lakh tonne paddy) for rabi season. However, the government has exceeded its kharif target by nine lakh tonne. The rabi paddy procurement will start from May 1 and continue till June 30.Though 14.97 lakh farmers have registered online for sale of their surplus paddy under minimum support price (MSP), a report of the Food Supplies and Consumer Welfare department said 11.92 lakh farmers sold their paddy till the deadline.The government failed to explain why 2.05 lakh registered farmers couldnt sell their produces. This points at the alleged irregularities in procurement process. The Food and Procurement Policy approved by the government said there was no bar on procurement of any higher quantum if more paddy comes to mandis from registered farmers.The fact remains that more mandis (3,840) were opened during this kharif season than last year (3,543) and 2,881 primary agriculture cooperative societies were engaged for procurement against 2,853 last year.

The court said the Finance Ministry failed to prove Yingluck was directly responsible for the financial losses.Yingluck, whose government was ousted in a 2014 coup, was sentenced in absentia to five years in prison in 2017 for negligence in instituting the subsidy program. She fled Thailand before the verdict and called the case politically motivated.The rice subsidy program was a flagship policy that helped Yinglucks Pheu Thai Party win the countrys 2011 general election. Under the program, the government paid farmers about 50 percent more than they would have received on the global market, with the intention of driving up prices by warehousing the grain.But other rice-producing countries captured the international rice market by selling at competitive prices. Thailand as a result lost its position as the worlds leading rice exporter and large amounts of rice sat unsold in government warehouses.Yinglucks critics described the overriding motive of the rice subsidy program as political  an effort to buy the loyalty of rural voters with state funds.Yingluck and her defenders said she was persecuted in an effort by political enemies to dismantle the political machine of her brother, former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, who was toppled from power by a 2006 military coup after being accused of abuse of power, corruption and disrespect for the countrys monarchy.His supporters, who delivered him unprecedented electoral victories, believe his only offense was challenging the power of the countrys traditional elite, which is led by monarchists and the military and supported by the urban middle class.Yingluck and Thaksin remain in self-imposed exile.",Thai court voids order for former PM to pay $1B for losses,RICE

Just like last year, the Covid-19 pandemic has thrown a spanner in the celebrations with number of positive cases rising every day. However, it has not dulled the spirit of worshippers who are happy to attend the virtual services from home and share a meal with their families.Talking about the services being held over the Holy Week, Father MM Kennedy from St Francis Xavier Church in Yapral, says: Our services are being held both physically and virtually. We are following government restrictions and allowing only a certain number of worshippers inside the church so as to follow physical distancing. We have open grounds outside the church and that makes the process easier. We had the morning service which reminds us of Jesus instituting the Eucharist and priesthood.Besides these, we carry out the ritual of washing feet which symbolises work of the Lord as service to the people. Today, on Good Friday, we remember the passion and death of our Lord, and we marked the Way of The Cross (14 stations) by taking all safety precautions. During the evening, we will follow Veneration of The Cross. On Saturday, at around 10 pm, we will hold the night Easter vigil which marks the Resurrection of Jesus.Roydin Roach, who is the Telangana president of the All India Catholic Union, says: In Hyderabad, we saw a large number of people offering prayers on Good Friday while taking Covid-19 precautions. Many parishes are broadcasting their services online through their own YouTube channels or Facebook Live feature. Liturgy TV, Catholic Hub and Divyavani TV are a few of the channels which telecast all services, in Hindi and English, live from city churches. We saw tableau and plays enacted across churches on Good Friday. At a few places, only the actors were allowed on the church grounds, while worshippers watched them from home. The night Easter Vigil, which can go on till 1:30 am, is the most important service of Easter. It involves rituals like lighting the candles and sprinkling of holy water.Easter is also the time of feasting for those who have been observing Lent fast for 40 days. Talking about the different dishes that are prepared during the fasting period and its culmination, Jacqueline Nicholas from Jackies Patisserie & Cafe says: My chicken roasts sell like hot cakes on Easter. Many followers do not eat meat during the 40-day period. The fasting ends after the Easter night service and people celebrate with chicken roasts along with grilled vegetables and Easter eggs.

Due to the pandemic, we are not attending the early morning service at church and will be part of it virtually. In the pre-pandemic days, I used to go to St Georges Church. We would decorate the church with jasmine flowers. After the service, we would be offered Easter eggs which were boiled eggs with coloured shells. At home, we eat chocolate Easter eggs, cakes and a special meal. We marinate turkey in the morning and grill it to perfection. Later, at a lunch attended by friends and family, we serve it with either coconut rice or chicken biryani.

2021-04-03,https://indianexpress.com/article/world/palestinian-refugees-lebanon-covid-19-pandemic-7257515/,"'Long live Palestine' is painted on a wall at the Burj Barajneh camp: Life for Palestinian refugees in Lebanon is hard and getting harder. (DW/D. Hodali)Here in the camp, people dont stick that strictly to the coronavirus measures, says Kholoud Hussein as she shrugs her shoulders. There are just as many people out in our streets as there always are.Kholoud Hussein has lived her whole life in the Palestinian refugee camp Burj Barajneh in the south of the Lebanese capital, Beirut. She works as an English translator and a project coordinator in a local womens organization. Until fairly recently, she had to go to the Haifa Hospital several days a week to translate for a team of doctors from the Japanese Red Cross, but since the start of the pandemic, the doctors havent been coming anymore. Now she works at home, translating studies and surveys.More to worry about than COVIDThe Haifa Hospital is located right in the heart of the camp. Kholoud is in close contact with the staff there. They tell me that they often have problems persuading the relatives of patients that they have to wear a mask when entering the hospital, she says. Kholoud always wears her mask, she says, because she doesnt want to be responsible for infecting anyone else.A lot of local organizations distribute free masks in the camp, she says. But according to Kholoud, not everyone here is convinced that they are of any use. What is more, she says, most people in the refugee camp have existential problems that far overshadow any worries about being infected by the coronavirus.A large proportion of the residents relies on food donations from organizations, with even milk now being a luxury item, Kholoud says. Her sister always liked making rice pudding, she adds, but that is no longer possible. The Lebanese economy was already in big trouble even before the pandemic. The Lebanese pound went down massively in value. And the devastating explosion in Beiruts port in August 2020 was the final straw.I get only 50% of my pay, she says. Her husband, her son and her stepson have all lost their jobs amid the economic crisis in Lebanon. Her daughter is still working. The two of us feed the family, she says.Financial problems at the UNRWAThe United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) is responsible for the Palestinian refugees in the 12 official camps in Lebanon. This is because Lebanon does not accept any costs for the Palestinians.But the UN organization frequently becomes a pawn of political interests, as happened, for example, when former US President Donald Trump withdrew financing from the agency and made a dent in its finances to the tune of $300 million (255 million)  his successor, Joe Biden, has announced he will commence payments again. The main criticism leveled at the UNRWA is that by looking after 5.7 million Palestinians in the region, it creates incentives for them not to integrate in other Arab countries so that they remain permanent refugees instead.The background to this argument is the Palestinians right of return enshrined in the UN Resolution 194, which is one of the big issues in the quest for a resolution to the Middle East conflict between Israelis and Palestinians. While Israel declared its independence on May 14, 1948, for Palestinians, May 15 of that year marked the start of their flight and forced displacement to todays Palestinian territories and bordering countries, including Lebanon. However, what was initially considered to be a temporary solution for the Palestinians has now become a home for several generations. The UNRWA needs more than a billion US dollars each year to keep up its regular, emergency and lifesaving services.Erosion of rightsThe Palestinians in Lebanon have never been recognized by a Lebanese government as having equal rights. This is partly because the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) was involved in fighting in the Lebanese Civil War, something that angered various political groups in the country. In Lebanon, Palestinian refugees pass on their refugee status to their children. They are not allowed to work in academic professions and are worse-paid than Lebanese with the same qualifications.The Lebanese side has always officially justified this exclusion with the argument that a complete integration of the refugees in Lebanon would make it harder for them to return home. So while the US, for example, would like to see the Palestinian refugees settle permanently in the country, Lebanon does not want them to.The Burj Barajneh camp was originally meant to house 3,500 people. But the UNRWA has officially registered 20,000 Palestinians in the camp, and, with the arrival of more refugees from war-torn Syria, the actual number of residents is believed to be twice as high as that.No room for quarantineThe lanes in the camp are narrow. Residents often cynically say that not even a coffin can get through them. Wherever you go, a tangle of telephone wires and uncovered electrical cables hangs above your head  residents regularly die from electrocution when it rains.Here in the camp, and in the houses, too, you cant really keep any distance, says Kholoud Hussein. Sometimes, as many as seven people share two rooms.Coronavirus testsMedical care is mostly provided by the UN aid agency. One day a week, the UNRWA, Doctors Without Borders (MSF) and the southern Lebanese Al Hamshari Hospital each carry out tests in the camp, which means there is testing on three to four days out of seven. That is quite well organized now, says Kholoud, recalling that it was not always that way: Particularly during the first days of the pandemic, she says, people had to pay a lot of money for tests in Lebanese hospitals  money that wasnt there.The coronavirus committee in the camp, which consists of NGOs and the Palestinian Red Cross, says that there were around 670 people in the camp infected by the coronavirus in February and March. But the unofficial number is likely to be higher, as not everyone takes a test.Anyone who becomes severely ill with COVID-19 is taken to the Al Hamshari Hospital. It is located near the city of Sidon, about 45 minutes drive to the south of Beirut. Kholoud has often worked as an interpreter there as well. A COVID ward has been set up at the hospital, partly paid for with money from Germanys Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development. Patients are transported there by ambulances.The UNRWA has also set up a quarantine center with 96 places for those people who have milder cases of the disease and are unable to isolate because of cramped living conditions. This so-called Medical Isolation Center is in Siblin.One of the people who went into quarantine there is Rayan Sokkar. She was infected by the coronavirus and was worried about passing it on to her family.This young Palestinian journalist was born and grew up in the Shatila refugee camp but now lives outside it. We were examined three times a day  mostly, they measured the oxygen level in our blood and our blood pressure or listened to our lungs with a stethoscope. We were well looked after.The coronavirus pandemic has put more financial pressure on the UNRWA. That is why its director, Philippe Lazzarini, does not tire of appealing to the international community for financial support. Unprecedented levels of despair with growing hunger & anger, he recently tweeted, adding that money was needed for food, the COVID response and dignified shelters.Kholoud Hussein has almost given up hope on this score. The world has forgotten us, she says. She doesnt expect much more from the international community. But at least she has a small reason to be pleased: She has already had her first coronavirus vaccination.",Palestinians in Lebanon: ‘The world has forgotten us’,RICE

They will not call you bohiragato. You will get to meet a lot of tilakwallahs and chotiwallahs there. They will chant Har har Mahadev. But they, along with others in Varanasi, will give you love. They may make you stay there, the PM said at the Sonarpur rally in what was evidently a response to the declaration by TMC leaders that Banerjee would, after defeating BJP in Bengal, take on Modi in his Lok Sabha constituency of Varanasi.BJP leaders, including Modi, have claimed that Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee is looking for a second seat as she is scared of losing from Nandigram. Trinamool leaders, including MP Mahua Moitra, have responded to that by saying  sarcastically  that Banerjee might contest from Varanasi in the 2024 Lok Sabha to take on Modi directly. Contesting from second seat?... Yes Mr Prime Minister, she will. And it will be Varanasi! So go get your armour on, a Trinamool tweet had said. Modi on Saturday latched onto the Trinamools response.Modi seized upon Trinamools taunt to make an attempt to cast Trinamool as parochial while seeking to depict BJP as an outfit which does not differentiate among people on the basis of states they belong to.The PM countered Trinamools  anti-outsider plank also by reiterating that the the leader of a BJP government in West Bengal would be a  son of soilBJP tacticians seem to reckon that Trinamools nativist pitch would not play well with  outsiders who constitute a chunk in many constituencies. However, PM said that public disparagement of outsiders militated against Bengals inclusivist grain. He cited Netaji Subhas Chandra Boses example to debunk the Trinamools outsider campaign. Born in Odisha and having his education in Bengal, Netaji used to say Bharat ek hai, our hopes and aspirations were the same. It pains me when the Trinamool and Mamata Didi talk about outsiders in India, the PM said.Modis speeches were marked by trademark aggression . He Bengal had made up its mind to vote the Trinamool out of office, and dubbed Trinamool a Taka Mar Company (TMC) at the Haripal rally and accusing it of taking cut money even for admission of patients to government hospitals. The middle class has slogged, the Trinamool has taken a cut from their income. It looted the poors rations following Amphan. It took away a major chunk of the 23 lakh tonnes of rice and 1 lakh tonne of pulses that the centre sent here during the lockdown. Apni nijer goondader samlan (Rein in your goons). Bengal has had enough of their torture. Bengal wants education, security for its women, the PM said, adding that the BJP government would use Digital India to transfer welfare benefits directly to people without any need for cut money.PM sounded confident of the BJP being able to form Bengals next government. Come May 2, someone from Bengal will be sworn in as Bengals CM. I will attend the swearing-in ceremony and ask the CM to expedite the process of transferring Rs 18,000 to each farmers account under the PM Kisan Samman Nidhi, he said.Modi took a jibe at the Bengal CMs complaints against security forces, electronic voting machines and the Election Commission. Didi, why are you angry? Is it because you did not get to do chhappa votes (rig the poll)? You were all praise for the EC, EVMs and security forces when you came to office 10 years ago, he added.  When an athlete starts complaining against the umpire than you can safely conclude that the game has been lost.There is a churning going on inside the Trinamool itself. Sensible people are saying Didi made a big mistake by shifting to Nandigram. A few reportedly advised her to contest from a second seat. But others prevailed upon Didi. I think this was sane advice because it would be difficult to run the Trinamool if Didi lost from two seats, he said.Modi, sensing Banerjees traction among women, said the Bengal government was sitting on files for establishment of fast-track courts for trial of crime against women when a thousand such such courts had already come up across the country. We have provisioned for setting up an anti-trafficking unit and a womens desk in each police station. The government here is not making full use of it, he said.PM also harped on the double-engine sarkar promise to emphasise how Bengal could be developed and connected if there was the same party in office both at the centre and in the state. Look at Singur today. The Trinamool drove away industry from the state. It lacks vision and political will. Potato growers in Hooghly are selling their produce cheap because the government has not set up adequate cold storages; and the existing storages are being run by Trinamool syndicates. Jute growers in Hooghly are facing a similar plight. We have set up an infrastructure fund to give a boost to the jute industry but things are not moving because the state government does not support jute mills, he said.",WB polls: PM Modi calls TMC ‘Taka Mar Company’,RICE

On a microphone nearby, Dishna Prasad, a young SFI firebrand, is busy unleashing a tirade against Congress for indulging in rice politics. A sea of red with scores of men, women, and children listens with rapt attention, all eyes on the road. No sooner does the array of vehicles show up, than Dishna quickly winds up her hour-long address. Here he comes... come and hear him speak, invites Vijayan as Pinarayi Vijayan steps out of his cavalcade.The atmosphere begins to reverberate with incessant sloganeering. Mobile cameras flash, percussionists beats reach a crescendo and a frenzied crowd struggles to catch a glimpse of the man they call The Captain. At Kilaloor Vayanasala near Makreri in Dharmdom, Pinarayi tells the crowd why the Left remains the right choice, alleges a hidden nexus between the BJP and the UDF, and finally dwells upon the politics of welfare.Last time, the BJP opened its account through Nemom. We have decided to close it this time, he states firmly, inviting loud cheers from his adoring listeners. Both O Rajagopal and a UDF leader said Congress votes had gone to the BJPs kitty. Recently, an MP said he wants the UDF candidate to win from Guruvayoor and LDFs A N Shamseer to lose from Thalassery, says Pinarayi, taking a potshot at Suresh Gopi.However, its the welfare politics that strikes a chord with the masses. And Pinarayi knows it well. In these trying times of Covid, the Left was very clear that not one person should stay hungry. Our state has about 4.5 lakh people living in utter poverty and whom the state wants to support, asserts Pinarayi.As the CM dwells on the LDF governments plans for further welfare measures, a visibly moved Vijayan nudges his friend who shares his elation on hearing their beloved leader air his views.A slew of posters, flex boards of Captain Pinarayi and red flags welcome those who enter Dharmadom. Congress C Raghunath and BJPs C K Padmanabhan pale in comparison on the campaign front, while the mother of the Walayar kids has a low-key campaign.The scorching sun does not dim the spirit of the enthusiastic cadre. They are unanimous in their verdict that Pinarayi alone can lead the state in these testing times.On a given day, Pinarayi visits around 14-16 venues in his constituency. On Thursday, he began the campaign by addressing gatherings at Mundayod, Elavana, and Mavilayi near Cherumavilayi UP School. In his address, Pinarayi leaves no stones unturned as he launches into a short but to-the-point speech that lasts for seven to eight minutes.He begins by mentioning the unholy nexus between UDF and BJP, goes on to hammer the Opposition and the Centre, and ends with a portrayal of the ground realities, winding with a humble but firm reminder, This time too, the Left chose me to contest from here. Cast your vote for the Left!After a two-hour break for lunch, Pinarayi is back on the trail at 3pm. At Ivarkulam, Peralassery and Palayam, kids present him with his portraits they drew. Class 6 student Swathik is all joy wearing a face-mask sporting the CMs visage, while four-year-old Nisa fiddles with her own mask. Ask Nisa whose face is it and pat comes the reply. Pinarayis. Who is Pinarayi? After a brief surprised look, she replies, rather patronisingly: Hes our chief minister, dont you know?At Cheguvera Nagar, an all-woman percussion band Sahridaya appears worn out from the scorching heat. But once Pinarayi arrives, the atmosphere changes. At venues like Palakkeezh, Vannante Matta, and Urppalli junctions near Paduvilayi, its mostly women who gather for family meets. Winding up his campaign for the day at Vengad at around 8pm, Pinarayi goes full throttle, attacking the Centre over its Fascist approach.

(Express Photo: Gurmeet Singh)Amid ongoing standoff over the agri laws, a Niti Aayog members remarks that the target of doubling farmers income by 2022 will not be fulfilled if the three new legislations are not implemented immediately, has sparked a fresh debate.Farmers and farm experts termed the statement as an excuse to protect the central government  which had announced in 2017-18 its target to double farmers income by 2022  and asked how these laws can double their income when there is no provision of even assured Minimum Support Price (MSP) in these laws.The debate began when Niti Aayog member Ramesh Chand, said, I will say that if these three farm laws are not adopted immediately, then I dont see that goal (of doubling farmers income by 2022) getting fulfilled.He was replying to a question on whether the government is still confident of doubling farm income by 2022.Expert on farm issues and retired economics professor from Punjabi University Patiala Professor Gian Singh said that even if these laws are implemented today, they can never double farmers income by 2022. These laws lay more stress on privatisation and private mandis. Can the private player pay farmers so much that their income would be doubled? he asked.He further said that per capita income of a farmers family was Rs 54 per day in 2015-16 and even if it is increased to double, that is Rs 108 per capita, it cannot meet their basic needs including food, shelter, education, health etc.The pandemic has also proved that a human being can survive without cars, airplanes, big houses but cannot survive without food. Government must realise the contribution of farmers and should seriously do something to increase their income rather implementing these laws which have no guarantee of even getting a price equal to the current MSP, said Prof Gian Singh, adding that during the pandemic, India and particularly Punjab farmers have procured record paddy and even India has exported more rice this year to other countries.But our government, instead of rewarding them, is punishing them by running from government purchase.To double their income we need a farmer-friendly model not the corporate-friendly model, he added.In Punjab, wheat and paddy are the two main crops which are procured at MSP by the government and now the government is running from it giving several excuses in the name of direct payment, providing land record of the farmers etc. When around 68 per cent farmers have less than five acres and government is running from MSP purchase, how these laws can double the income of farmers? asked Jagmohan Singh, general secretary, Bharti Kisan Union (Dakaunda).We had length and breadth discussions on every clause of these laws with the government but government could not explain how the income of farmers can be enhanced by adopting these laws when government has no control on private players, he said, adding that farmers income can be increased only if the MSP of every crop is given as per recommendations of the Swaminathan report.Our demand for legal status of MSP for every crop is only because this is the only way to double farmers income, he said.Another expert from Punjab Agriculture University (PAU) Ludhiana, said that the Ramesh Chand committee 2014-15 had several good recommendations according to which he had recommended MSP of the crops, but as per these three laws the government is not talking about MSP, but about private mandis and players, which mean minimising the government purchase which would result in no purchase at MSP.The Niti Aayog member is thinking from the point of view of the private players, not from the farmers point of view and assuming that private players are paying much more to the farmers than the governments price. How can things be assumed when everyone is aware that a businessman (private players) is much more worried about his own profit not about the welfare of the farmers?Only the state can think about the welfare of farmers but the state is running from its responsibility, said BKU (Ugrahan) General Secretary, Sukhdev Singh Kokrikalan.If the government is saying it wants to double the income of farmers, it should take such steps, not the steps it has taken in the form of these three laws which are more suitable to private players, he added.The lives of small and marginal farmers are already in a miserable state and now these laws will push them further into more poverty as they are not in a position to bargain with private players and sell their crop going one place to another, said Kokrikalan, and asked whether the Niti Aayog member convince farmers in layman language how these laws would double their income.Can he quote even a single such model where small and marginal farmers are earning a respectable income without the support of the government, he asked.",Niti Aayog member sparks farm income debate,RICE

2021-04-07,https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/delhi/delhi-govt-plans-to-roll-out-doorstep-ration-scheme-7263145/,"Having dropped the name Mukhya Mantri Ghar Ghar Ration Yojna after the Centre raised a red flag over it, the Delhi government plans to roll out the doorstep delivery of ration scheme inOn Wednesday, the Delhi Food department ordered that the ration distribution for April be carried out through biometric verification using e-POS machines at all ration shops in the Seemapuri circle on a pilot basis, including at the ones set up for doorstep delivery of foodgrains under National Food Security Act.In circles, except Seemapuri, the ration shops will remain open, the order added.A senior government official said there is no need to re-notify the scheme just because its name has been dropped. The scheme was notified on February 20 and was scheduled to be launched on March 25.We plan to launch it very soon, most likely in April itself. There is no need to notify it afresh. The Cabinet has already approved the decision to drop the name and we are hopeful that the Centre will not have any objection now as it is not being rolled out in the form of any local scheme, the official said.According to the notification of the doorstep scheme, millers empaneled with the Delhi State Civil Supplies Corporation Ltd (DSCSC) will be tasked with lifting wheat and rice from the godowns of the Food Corporation of India (FCI). The wheat will be processed into atta before distribution by doorstep agents, while the rice will be cleaned of straws, stones, jute bag thread, mud or other impurities and foreign substances.Apart from the name of the scheme, the Centre has also questioned one of the components of the proposed scheme that involves collection of the cost of subsidised food grains and a specified amount as milling/conversion charges from beneficiaries. The Delhi government has not yet made public the charges that it plans to collect.However, existing ration dealers feel they will be thrown out of business once the scheme is rolled out as the agency picked for doorstep delivery will also be tasked with setting up large warehouses where supplies will be stocked before delivery at the doorstep of beneficiaries.Following a delay in supply of ration for the month of April to around 71 fair price shops in Seemapuri, Ballimaran and New Delhi circles, the Delhi Sarkari Ration Dealers Sangh served a legal notice to the Delhi Food Commissioner on March 31 to resume supply within 24 hours.According to the National Food Security Act, 2013, The State Government shall ensure the lifting of foodgrains from the Corporation (FCI) by the last day of the month preceding the allocation month.Supply eventually resumed on April 6. We have repeatedly assured the ration dealers that supply to fair price shops will not be discontinued. The scheme is optional and only those who opt for it will have their share delivered straight to their homes, the official quoted above said.Saurabh Gupta, secretary of the Delhi Sarkari Ration Dealers Sangh, said the modalities of the scheme clearly state that the doorstep agency will set up its own large fair price shops, the license of which will be obtained in the name of the Delhi Consumers Cooperative Wholesale Store Ltd (DCCWS).During the lockdown, when entire cities had shut down, ration shops remained open and continued to serve people despite all odds. Casually dismissing us as ration mafia does no good, Gupta said.Public distribution system welfare association president Shailendra Kumar questioned the long-pending implementation of usage of e-POS machines at ration shops. The government says the scheme will put an end to pilferage and theft. Then why do the e-POS machines lie unused in all ration shops? Even under the scheme, doorstep agents are expected to hand over ration after biometric verification through e-POS machines, Kumar said.The distribution of ration in Delhi is currently managed by a network of as many as 2,005 fair price shops. Under the National Food Security Act, 2013, which governs the PDS, the approximately 17.77 lakh ration card holding families in Delhi are divided into three categories  15.12 lakh priority households (PR), 1.73 lakh priority state households (PRS), and 68,468 Antyodaya Anna Yojana (AAY) families.The beneficiaries coming under the PR and PRS categories are entitled to 5 kg of foodgrains per month while AAY households receive 25 kg wheat, 10 kg rice and 1 kg sugar.",Delhi govt plans to roll out ration at doorstep scheme this month,RICE

But I didnt factor in the full-blown symptomsAfter being in the vaccine hesitancy group for the longest time, I took the jump to the other side and got my first shot on April 3.In truemovie style, my aunt sent me sheera (suji ka halwa with bananas,and lots of ghee) on Friday night, like I was going to battle. Or was it my last supper, I wondered.The actual vaccination was over in a snap. I spent an hour waiting for the doctor to arrive to check my vitals, only because I reached earlier than the appointed time. It gave me time to ask the volunteer a million questions on how many they vaccinate per day (about 45 to 50), how many vials are wasted per day (one or two), how many can they vaccinate (100), what kind of symptoms warrant a visit to a hospital (high fever, breathlessness), allergies I had (penicillin and peanuts). When my doubts were all cleared, my brain went into journalists mode. What stories can I milk from this visit? A first-person account? What to wear when you are going in for the vax? The morning papers had a photo ofgetting herin a strappy top. What to eat before you go for the jab?Fortunately, the doctor arrived and checked my train of thought and my saturation, blood sugar and blood pressure and pronounced me fit. He directed me to a room where a male nurse brought a vial, showed me that he was opening a new one and I was done. It hurt less than a blood test. But wait, where was I supposed to schedule a vaccine selfie? I had missed the cue.I was then directed to a room as per the Adverse Effect Following Immunisation (AEFI) protocol and waited. Waited to grow an extra nose, waited to faint like a Victorian heroine you get the drift.Thankfully none of that happened. I got my certificate and left after 30 minutes, with my left arm smarting just a little bit.From there, I met a friend for lunch at a fancy new caf near the Bangalore Mirror office, then went home and waited to feel different. Nothing.I prepped for dinner. Boiled eggs to paint on them later. Bookmarked a YouTube tutorial to follow on how to paint Easter eggs. Chauffered a friend.Came home and made dinner. And sat down to paint Easter eggs. Symptoms? Zero.However, by 12 pm I had finished painting 3 easter eggs and I finally started feeling the first signs of what my doctor has warned me about. Chills and feverishness. I almost let out a cheer. I was on my way to developing immunity.I popped aand took to bed. The next few hours gave me in spades what I was expecting for the last 12 hours  a splitting headache, body ache, nausea and low-grade fever. It was like having a bad flu and I hadnt had the flu in ages. The next day was the same. My friends and cousin who had taken the shot on the same day as I were relatively fine. Calls, messages and food boxes from friends and loved ones made me feel good but the food was untouched.My appetite disappeared. Nausea made me want to lie prone. Even a sip of water made me want to upchuck. The pain in my body was excruciating and no surface alleviated the pain. I moved from bed to couch to window seat to finally lying on my yoga mat to give my back some support. That helped and I slept for a few hours.I woke up and the symptoms remained for the next 48 hours. I survived on water, tender coconut, a few slivers of fruit and paracetamol. I was away from work for two days which I did not factor in. My neighbours, in the 70s and 80s were surprised at my reaction because they felt no after-effects.

But that was not enough to deter the 34-year-old candidate, who kept on visiting one sensitive booth after another in the interiors of Arambag even as purported BJP workers kept attacking her through the day. The windshield of her car was also damaged.Bordering Bankura and East Midnapore on either side, Arambag in Hooghly has contributed two former chief ministers to Bengal  Prafulla Chandra Sen and Ajoy Mukherjee  between 1962 and 1976. But not once since 1951, when this assembly segment was formed, the constituency has ever voted for a woman MLA. Trinamools Mondal, who happens to be the wife (currently going through a divorce proceeding) of BJP MP Saumitra Khan , vows to change the history. I will be the first woman, that too from a scheduled tribe, to become an MLA from here.I consider myself an iron lady who goes by the principles of Rani Lakhsmi Bai and such attacks cannot break me physically and mentally. I am a fighter and I will fight till my last breath, said Mondal.Mondals day started at 5am as she set out on her booth visit. Around 11am, she, along with a handful of TMC supporters and two security guards, entered the Arandi village following complaints that a sizeable Muslim population in the village were being stopped from going to booths by BJP workers.She stormed into the village on a bike, threatening BJP workers to break their hands. At Mohollapara, she led a procession of voters to the voting booth. But halfway to the booth, a group of men and women armed with sticks, bamboo poles, bricks and stones came charging at her. Mondal was pushed to the paddy field as villagers rained stones and bricks on her, resulting her security guard to flash the gun. But, he didnt fire as the men backed off. Mondal literally had to run along the paddy field to reach a safe zone.Cops and CRPF personnel reached later as Mondal levelled allegations of favoritism and corruption on the local inspector in charge.BJP candidate Madhusudan Bag, meanwhile, claimed Mondal and his men attacked a pregnant woman and kicked a bowl of rice that triggered the assault. At the end of the day, the booth recorded 61% votes, 18% less than district average.

The state agencies shall ensure the use of EAT module of PFMS while making the payment, as mandated by the ministry of finance, Government of India. The state government may take action to integrate their online payment system with PFMS, wherever applicable. The Online Procurement System shall necessarily have the features of online registration of farmers and online payment to them; and all other features as mandated by the Government of India , according to Clause-5 of the MOU.Clauses 25 and 26 of the MOU state, In case of any dispute arising out of the operation of the scheme or interpretation of the terms of the MOU, the decision of the central government taken, shall be final. The MOU will be applicable for the RMS 2020-21 onwards for procurement operations of wheat.An examination of various official communications between the Centre and the Punjab government on procurement has been revealed that repeated relaxations were given for the implementation of online direct payment to the farmers, right from 2019. However, Punjab had only sought time to implement the direct transfer scheme every time and had made no other objection.In a letter dated August 21, 2019, the Centre had directed that an online procurement system has to be put in place by the middle of September 2019 and directed FCI to accept custom milled rice (CMR) and make payment to the state agencies only if the payments are made online directly to the accounts of registered farmers by the agencies. The states were also asked to make changes in their APMC Acts in line with the Centres instructions on utilization of subsidy and tracking it till the end beneficiary.However, the Centre vide letter dated December 2, 2019 considered the request of the state government as a special case and Punjab was informed that no further relaxation will be accorded in future and it will have to implement direct online payment to farmers from RMS 2020-21onwards without fail.The FCI in letter dated January 3, 2020, requested Punjab to make necessary changes in APMC Act in line with GOI directions. Accordingly, the state government amended the relevant clause of the APMC Act in January 2020.However, vide notification dated April 8, 2020, Punjab again made amendments for making payments through arhtiyas. Thereafter, it requested for relaxation during RMS 2020-21 after which the Centre vide letter dated April 24, 2020, said that in view of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic and associated lockdown conditions requiring observance of social distancing norms, there can be risks associated with the registration of farmers and it was decided that the payment to farmers through arhtiyas was permitted subject to certain conditions. This relaxation was applicable only to RMS 2020-21. Thereafter, at the time of Kharif Marketing Season (KMS) 2020-21, Punjab informed that owing to pre-ponement of procurement season, agitation by farmers due to three agriculture laws, the state could not complete KYC of farmers for ensuring direct online payment from state agency through Anaaj Kharid portal and accordingly requested the Centre to continue with existing arrangements of payment of MSP in KMS 2020-21through arhtiyas temporarily.Again vide letter dated October 6, 2020, Punjabs request was considered by the Centre in the public interest, and it was decided to allow online MSP payment to the farmers through arhtiyas in Punjab only for KMS 2020-21subject to certain conditions. Thereafter, Punjab was asked to ensure implementation of direct online payment from RMS 2021-22 instead of through intermediaries or arhtiyas in compliance with PFMS mandate.",Procurement: Punjab had agreed to DBT for farmers in February,RICE

To recuperate from childbirth, physically and mentally, takes time. So, it is important to replenish the nutritional levels to quicken the process of recovery. And for this precise reason, our ancestors resorted to the traditional pathiya samayal post-delivery.The diet eliminates consumption of spicy, acidic and fried foods by turning the spotlight on homegrown vegetables, fruits, spices and herbs that aid in secretion of breast milk and improve gut health. If you have never heard of pathiya samayal or do not live with elders who can help you with traditional delicacies, fret not.City-based homechef Yogambal Sundar, who specialises in south Indian cuisine, guides us through food items that should and should not be included in a postpartum diet. While a carefully curated prenatal diet is mandatory, a postnatal diet is equally important. A lot has changed from our times to yours.

It is not so. Even lean women tend to have PCOS. A low carbohydrate and high protein diet can help. A high carb diet affects insulin sensitivity. Take carbs with a low glycemic index (which does not spike your insulin), said Kimble.As an imbalance in the metabolism of hormones, the ovaries produce higher levels of androgen which interfere with the development and release of eggs. Some of the eggs develop into cysts  which are the little sacs filled with liquid.

There's nothing left. It was all destroyed.""The cyclone is now headed for Australia where authorities urged holidaymakers to evacuate a stretch of the country's western coastline before it hits landfall late Sunday or early Monday.- Aid arriving -In Indonesia, the navy vessels docked at Lembata and Adonara islands with a hospital ship that was also en route to the ravaged area, where thousands have been left homeless and dozens are still missing.The storm on Sunday swept buildings in some villages down a mountainside and to the shore of the ocean on Lembata.The navy vessels are packed with food, including rice and noodles, as well as blankets and other materials for some of the region's more than 20,000 evacuees.""Another ship will arrive later today carrying military personnel who will be deployed to help people in the aftermath of the disaster,"" Kompiang Aribawa, a regional naval base chief, said earlier Thursday.A cargo plane left Jakarta for the disaster-struck region with about 100,000 face masks, Covid-19 test kits, as well as prepared food and blankets for survivors, Indonesia's disaster agency chief said earlier.At least 140 people have been listed as dead in Indonesia.Another 37 were killed in East Timor -- a tiny half-island nation of 1.3 million sandwiched between Indonesia and Australia that is officially known as Timor-Leste.More than 70 people are still listed as missing, with disaster agency officials deploying sniffer dogs to search mountains of debris for bodies -- and any survivors.Rescuers have spent the past few days using diggers and shovels to extract mud-covered corpses from the debris.- 'They weren't ready' -Hospitals, bridges and thousands of homes were damaged or destroyed by the storm.Authorities in both countries are also battling to avoid Covid-19 outbreaks in crammed evacuation shelters.Fatal landslides and flash floods are common across the Indonesian archipelago during the rainy season, with deforestation often the cause, environmentalists say.This week's disaster in East Nusa Tenggara hit a relatively dry region that suffers from a lack of mitigation planning for floods and landslides, said Greenpeace Indonesia researcher Sapta Ananda Proklamasi.""In the past decade these storms have been happening more frequently,"" he said.""But land use planning there rarely factors in what happens if heavy rains come...

(Source: Getty Images/Thinkstock)Stomach flu, also known as gastroenteritis, is usually caused by any virus that may attack the gastrointestinal system. It can also be caused by bacteria through contaminated water and food. Stomach flu can wreak havoc on the system. Remember, our overall health is closely interlinked with our digestive health. Hence, stomach flu can have a deep impact on physical, mental, and emotional health, said nutritionist and lifestyle educator Karishma Chawla.Stomach flu symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach cramping, and abdominal pain.Here are foods that one should have and avoid when down with stomach flu:*Drinking adequate amounts of fluids is imperative to make up for the fluid loss due to diarrhea and vomiting. Fluids include plain water, infused water with herbs, electoral water, coconut water, broth, herbal tea with ginger, and peppermint. In fact, the smell of peppermint tea may help reduce nausea as well.Drink enough water to stay hydrated. (Source: Getty Images/Thinkstock) Drink enough water to stay hydrated.

The ninth month of the Islamic lunar calendar, it prescribes dawn-to-dusk fasting. And this fasting is naturally accompanied by feasting, in various degrees of richness. The Ramzan spread has to have a little of everything  warm soups, cold sherbets, fried snacks, grilled meats, gravies and rice dishes  but it is the date, the small fruit of the Phoenix dactylifera L. palm, that crowns the table globally, especially during iftar (breaking of the fast).Eating dates after the maghrib (evening) call to prayer during Ramzan is considered to signify the commencement of the iftar. They are also eaten by many Muslims as part of the pre-dawn suhour meal.The maamoul is a date-filled cookie that is made in big batches during Ramzan in Arab countries. Photo: Sawsan Abu Farha/Special ArrangementThe sugar in dates keeps your energy levels high, and its high fibre content also makes you feel full for a longer time, which is why it is commonly eaten during both iftar and suhour. But more than the science, Muslims cherish the date because of its associations with Prophet Muhmamads traditions, says Delhi-based celebrity chef and writer Sadaf Hussain, who has chronicled Islamic recipes and the stories behind them from across India in his 2019 book Daastan-e-Dastarkhan: Stories and Recipes from Muslim Kitchens (Hachette).In India, where processed dates are becoming more common on shop shelves as contemporary syrups and jams, heritage dishes from the erstwhile princely states use the fruit in both chutneys and pickles. Chef Hussains take on this old recipe uses plums, jamun fruit and date pulp, spiced with chillies and chaat masala to create a piquant chutney.Last year I tweaked the recipe for a Kashmiri Ramzan beverage called babribyol, which is usually made with sabja (basil) seeds, milk, sugar, saffron and coconut shavings. I replaced sugar and blended the milk with dates, which made it into a nice thick shake. Such smoothies can easily be substituted for the sugary bottled fruit cordials that we commonly have for iftar, says Hussain, who has also made cheesecake with date pulp.To make date paste at home, simply deseed the fruit and blend the pulp in a mixer, or knead manually with a small amount of water.This year, Hussain is in talks for a pop-up restaurant on an all-vegetarian Ramzan menu platter-to-order in Delhi and Lucknow. I have always tried to break the stereotype that the typical Muslim diet is only about biryani, korma, and kebabs. We have a healthy selection of vegetarian dishes, he says.In Arab countries, where dates are a major agricultural crop, both religious tradition and culinary affiliation make them a very commonly used ingredient throughout the year. Dates in the Levant are an integral part of the cuisine especially when it comes to baked goods. If you walk into any bakery in the morning, you are sure to find freshly baked date-filled bread rings. They are a popular breakfast item that many people pick up on their way to school or work, writes Sawsan Abu Farha, a food writer based in Jordan, who blogs as Chef in Disguise, in an email interview.The weeks before Ramzan are a time for Arab families to stock up on dates to enjoy them as is or to use them in various recipes during the holy month.Plum and dates chutney. Photo: Sadaf Hussain/Special ArrangementAmong the most popular of these is the cookie called maamoul, made by filling balls of a soft and buttery semolina and flour dough with date paste. Long-handled wooden moulds are used to imprint pretty designs on the maamoul tops, and then baked in a medium oven.Plum and dates chutney Ingredients300 gm plums250 gm jamuns4-6 tsp jaggery powder50 gm dates2-3 green chillies1/12 tsp fennel seedsA pinch of fenugreek seeds8-10 green cardamoms4-6 small pieces of cinnamonSalt to taste1 tsp chaat masala1 tsp sesame seeds (optional)MethodBoil the plum, jamun and dates together, till they become soft and fork tender. In a mixing bowl or mortar pestle, grind all the dry spices with green chilli. Take plum, jamun and dates, retain some water but throw away rest or use it to make a beverage. Make a rough paste of these fruits, and put it back in a saucepan. Cook this paste for five5 minutes with the spice mixture, and check the seasoning. When the chutney becomes homogenous and tastes delicious, toss in toasted sesame seeds. Serve chutney with bread, roti or rice.Recipe by Sadaf HussainMaamoul is the ultimate cookie to make for Eid al Fitr (the festival that marks the end of Ramzan). We greet our guests on Eid morning with fresh coffee, a bowl full of dates and lots of maamoul and kaak (ring cookies), says Sawsan.Interestingly, maamoul is also made for Easter by Arab Christians, and the Purim festival by Jews, showing the biscuits sweet ties with the regions history.Ready to snackDate paste finds its way into other delicacies also, like tamer-bi-simsim, where it is rolled in roasted sesame seeds and served as a quick snack, in Arabian Gulf countries. Pitted dates are also used as a casing for nuts like almonds and walnuts, and served plain, or dipped in chocolate ganache.What many may not know is that the Ramzan diet has instructions not only for fasting, but also for the feasting, adds Sawsan. She writes, We are told to start the iftar with some dates. After this, one is encouraged to go pray before eating the main meal, because this short break gives the body time to metabolise the dates and water that have been consumed and to start the bodys digestive processes, which have been resting all day.

(File)Two days before it starts the mega exercise of procuring nearly 130 lakh tonnes of wheat crop, the Punjab government Thursday agreed to implement the direct bank transfer of MSP to farmers, bypassing the arhtiyas, from the current season saying it was left with no choice but to implement the scheme as Centre said it will not lift the grains if the new system was not followed.The move is bound to create ripples among the farmers, the arhtiyas and the political class in the agrarian state, where the commission agents have traditionally been carrying out the procurement for the government agencies. Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh had earlier written to Centre, urging it to let Punjab carry on with the old system of procurement and payment through arhtiyas. In a meeting with the commission agents, he had refused to implement the new system that seeks to bypass the arhtiyas.However, a five-member Punjab delegation that met Union Minister Piyush Goyal had to return empty handed Thursday with the Centre refusing to budge on the issue of direct benefit transfer (DBT) to farmers.State Finance Minister Manpreet Singh Badal, who led the delegation, talking to The Indian Express said, He told us to go back and follow the system. He told us either we follow the new system or they would not procure our crop. He said they will not budge.Besides Badal, Punjab Food Minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu, PWD Minister Vijay Inder Singla and Mandi Board Chairman Laal Singh attended the meeting. State Food Secretary KAP Sinha and senior officials from Union Food and Agriculture Ministries were also present.Punjab procures wheat and paddy at the MSP for central pool under the National Food Security Act (NFSA). Currently, the payment to farmers in Punjab is done through arthiyas.Manpreet said that the central government argued that the food stock procured belongs to it and the state government is just an agent and should make payment directly to farmers.We told him that we have our own APMC Act in place that provides for payment through the arhtiyas. He told us to amend the Act if we want our grains to be procured. He said they are the owners of the grains and we are just the agents and whenever an owner tells the agent to follow a system, it is to be done, Manpreet said.Ashu said that they told the Union Minister that the arhtiyas will not lift the grains if the money is given directly to the farmers. To this, he said that if arhtiyas do not lift the grains, then the agencies would lift it directly.Manpreet said the state government has no other choice but to implement the DBT for farmers from the current season itself and a new mechanism will be worked out. The Government of India (GoI) had asked us to implement the DBT for farmers. We had sought more time.But the GoI dismissed our demand. We tried a lot but they did not listen, he said.It is a question of Rs 28,000 crore. We will hold a meeting with arhtiyas and work out how it is to be done, he added.The Punjab CM has called a meeting with arthiyas on Friday to discuss about a new mechanism ahead of wheat procurement that will commence from April 10. We will develop a mechanism that will give some protection to arthiyas, Ashu said.News agency PTI quoted Union Food Secretary Sudhanshu Pandey: Punjab ministers in the meeting agreed to implement the DBT for farmers from this season. Currently, MSP payment is routed through arthiyas. We are asking them to pay directly to farmers.State governments were asked to implement DBT to farmers in 2018. By 2019, almost all states started implementing it except for Punjab, he said.Manpreet said that Centre has agreed to defer implementation of land records integration (required to track land ownership of farmers during procurement) by six months. They deferred the requirement for one more procurement season, said Manpreet.On the issue of pending rural development fund (RDF), the Centre told the Punjab delegation that they were not satisfied with the states reply. We told him that this is our statutory fund and we have every record of how this money is spent and we are willing for an audit. He told us to send a detailed reply following which they will release our remaining 2 per cent of the fund, said Manpreet.The Centre had released only 1 per cent of RDF to state for the paddy procurement season while the state charges RDF at 3 per cent of the MSP. They Centre had sought a record on how the RDF was being spent.On the issue of moving the stock from granaries in the state, Ashu said, He told us they have devised a new system under which the grains would be lifted and sent directly to the states which were to be supplied with the grains.Manpreet said that the Centre had also agreed to pay Rs 1600 crore recoverable to Punjab, They said they will clear this amount soon.The minister also informed the Centre that the state will implement the distribution of fortified rice via Public Distribution System and welfare schemes like Midday Meal Scheme.","Punjab gives in, will implement DBT for farmers",RICE

However, those States were producing required quantities of common grade paddy and as a result the FCI was seeking only raw rice, processed from fine varieties of paddy, from Telangana.Keeping in mind such changing scenario, the farmers were required to grow only those crops which have demand in the market, the TSCSC Chairman said.He further stated that in spite of the financial constraints of the State government, the Chief Minister had agreed to take up paddy procurement this season and the government had given guarantee for borrowing 20,000 crore by the corporation for the purpose.Mr. Srinivas Reddy stated that the TSCSC would open 6,575 procurement centres to purchase paddy from farmers this season at support price, provided they bring the produce with fair average quality specifications such as maximum moisture content of 17% and chaff up to 3% among others.

2021-04-09,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/explaining-pakistans-flip-flop-on-trade-with-india/article34275043.ece,"The shadow of politics still looms over trade, which runs contrary to Islamabads statements on the need for better tiesPakistans double U-turn on resuming trade with India highlights the internal differences within Ministries, between business and political communities, and the emphasis on politics over economy and trade. It also signifies Pakistan cabinets grandstanding, linking normalisation of ties with India to Jammu and Kashmir.On March 31, Pakistans new Finance Minister Hammad Azhar, announced Pakistans Economic Coordination Committee (ECC)s decision to import cotton, yarn, and 500,000 metric tons of sugar from India. The media dubbed it as a political breakthrough but the ECCs decision was not on bilateral trade; it was about importing only three items  cotton, yarn and sugar.Also Read No trade with India under current circumstances: Pakistan PM Imran KhanA day later, Pakistans cabinet overruled the decision; the meeting was chaired by Prime Minister Imran Khan and which included Shah Mohammad Qureshi (Foreign Affairs Minister), Fawad Chaudhry (Science and Technology Minister) and Shireen M. Mazari (Human Rights Minister). The Dawn quoted Mr. Qureshi as saying, A perception was emerging that relations with India have moved towards normalization and trade has been opened there was a unanimous opinion as long as India does not review the unilateral steps it took on August 5, 2019, normalising relations with India will not be possible.Mr. Hammad Azhar, whose Ministry proposed the idea, accepted the cabinets decision as the working of economic and political interface in a democracy, and it was left with the Prime Minister and the cabinet to endorse, reject or modify the ECCs proposals. However, Pakistans textile industry has not taken the cabinets decision kindly; for them, importing cotton yarn from India is an immediate need; else, it would impact their export potential.Three takeaways can be identified from the above. The first relates to the ECCs decision to import only three items from India, namely cotton, yarn and sugar. It was based on Pakistans immediate economic needs and not designed as a political confidence-building measure to normalise relations with India.Worldview with Suhasini Haidar | India-Pakistan to restart trade?Practical and economicFor the textile and sugar industries in Pakistan, importing from India is imperative, practical and is the most economic. According to the latest Pakistan Economic Survey, 2019-20, though the agriculture sector witnessed a growth of 2.67% (with an increase in rice and maize production), cotton and sugarcane production declined by 6.9% and 0.4%, respectively. Sugar exports came down substantially last year, by over 50% in 2019-20, when compared to 2018-19. Yarn, cotton cloth, knitwear, bedwear and readymade garments form the core of Pakistans textile basket in the export sector. By February 2020, there was a steep decline in the textile sector due to disruptions in supply and domestic production. When compared to the last fiscal year (2019-20), there has been a 30% decline (2020-21) in cotton production.According to State Bank of Pakistans latest quarterly report, the decline in cotton production is also due to fewer areas (the lowest since 1982) of cotton cultivation. By the end of 2020, there was a sharp decline (around 40%) in cotton production. Besides the decline in the area of cotton cultivation, there was also a decline in yield per acre. The ginning industry estimates that in 2021, it would receive less than half of what was projected. In 2019-20, Pakistan produced around nine billion bales; this year, the ginning industry estimates only around seven million bales. This would mean, Pakistans cotton export would reduce, creating a domino effect on what goes into Pakistans garment industry. Pakistan is the fifth-largest exporter of cotton globally, and the cotton-related products (raw and value-added) earn close to half of the countrys foreign exchange.Another industry in crisisThe sugar industry in Pakistan is also in crisis. When compared to cotton, the sugar industrys problem stem from different issues  the availability for local consumption and the steep price increase. The sugar industry has prioritised exports over local distribution. Increased government subsidy and a few related administrative decisions resulted in the sugar industry attempting to make a considerable profit by exporting it. By early 2019, the sugar prices started increasing, and in 2020, there was a crisis due to shortage and cost.Also read | Pakistan issues global tender for import of 50,000 tonnes of sugarIn February 2020, Mr. Imran Khan announced an investigation and constituted a commission of inquiry into Pakistans sugar crisis, 2019-20. According to the report, sugarcane was purchased off-the-books by the sugar mills, and sugar sold off-the-books. The report also noticed market manipulation and hoarding resulting in increased sugar price within Pakistan. In short, the subsidies, cheap bank loans, a few administrative decisions, manipulation and greed, especially by the sugar mill owners, mean high cost paid by the consumers.As a result, importing sugar from India would be cheaper for the consumer market in Pakistan. Clearly, the crises in cotton and sugar industries played a role in the ECCs decision to import cotton, yarn and sugar from India. It would not only be cheaper but also help Pakistans exports. This is also imperative for Pakistan to earn foreign exchange.Politics firstThe second takeaway from the two U-turns  is the supremacy of politics over trade and economy, even if the latter is beneficial to the importing country. For the cabinet, the interests of its own business community and its export potential have become secondary. However, Pakistan need not be singled out; this is a curse in South Asia, where politics play supreme over trade and economy. The meagre percentage of intra-South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) trade and the success (or the failure) of SAARC engaging in bilateral or regional trade would underline the above. Trade is unlikely to triumph over politics in South Asia; especially in India-Pakistan relations.Editorial | Fits and starts: On India-Pakistan dialogue processThe Kashmir linkThe third takeaway is the emphasis on Jammu and Kashmir by Pakistan to make any meaningful start in bilateral relations. This goes against what it has been telling the rest of the world that India should begin dialogue with Pakistan. Recently, both Pakistans Prime Minister and the Chief of Army Staff, Qamar Javed Bajwa, were on record stating the need to build peace in the region. Gen. Bajwa even talked about burying the past and moving forward. There were also reports that Pakistan agreeing to re-establish the ceasefire along the Line of Control (LoC) was a part of this new strategy.The latest statement by Pakistans cabinet that unless India rescinds the decision of August 5, 2019 in Jammu and Kashmir, there would be no forward movement, goes against what Mr. Imran Khan and Gen. Bajwa have been stating in public. This position also hints at Pakistans precondition (revoking the August 2019 decision on Jammu and Kashmir) to engage with India.Pakistan has been saying that the onus is on India to normalise the process. Perhaps, it is New Delhis turn to tell Islamabad that it is willing, but without any preconditions, and start with trade. It may even allow New Delhi to inform Pakistans stakeholders about who is willing to trade and who is reluctant.D.

Otherwise, they said, they (the Centre) will not procure from Punjab. They said that its their money, their food and this is the way they want it. They will not pay the arhtiyas (commission agents).Else, the Centre said the Punjab government may procure on its own and then liquidate the stocks, added Manpreet.He said that he and his colleague Bharat Bhushan Ashu, who heads the food and civil supplies department, tried to convince Goyal that it has been the traditional practice in Punjab to make payments through the arhtiyas, but he did not agree to Punjabs request and outrightly rejected it.The Centre reiterated that it would transfer money directly to the farmers and the arhtiyas commission would be transferred separately. Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh had urged the Centre to defer the DBT for some time so that the practice can be changed, but the Government of India has rejected it, said Manpreet.On the other condition about uploading of farmers land records, the Centre has agreed to defer it for one more season, added Manpreet.On the issue of the Centre withholding Punjabs rural development fund ( RDF ), the Government of India told Punjab that the state governments reply on how the money had been used in the past was not satisfactory and it should be sent again and the Centre will take a sympathetic view this time. This, even as the Punjab ministers offered to have the accounts audited by the Government of India.The fact that three ministers were in Delhi shows the kind of importance that the Punjab government was staking on the meeting and hoping for a positive outcome, said Manpreet.On the request for evacuation of the existing stocks of food grains out of Punjab, the Centre assured it would be done promptly in view of the fact that food grains were deteriorating and also because of limited storage space left in the state.The Punjab ministers also raised the issue of pending dues (recoverables) from the Centre to the tune of Rs 1,600 crore and the Government of India agreed to release it without delay.Another issue discussed during the meeting was fortification of rice that is used for midday meal schemes, it was pointed out that Punjab is almost compliant.Experts believe that for now, it seems that the state seems to be left with little option but to implement the DBT scheme. Meanwhile, the arhtiyas had threatened to boycott the wheat procurement if the existing system is changed and the state government is likely to reach out to them on Friday.",Centre to Punjab: Implement DBT or no procurement,RICE

(Austin Police Department via AP)The son of former cyclist Lance Armstrong was charged with sexual assault from 2018 when he was 18, according to a police arrest warrant.The alleged victim told police in November 2020 she was assaulted by Luke Armstrong after he drove her from a party to his fathers house. Because she was 16 at the time, Luke Armstrong has been charged with felony sexual assault of child.Luke Armstrongs attorney said Armstrong, now 21, and the girl, now 19, were in a consensual relationship and there was no assault. Armstrong was arrested Tuesday and released on a personal bond, according to court records.A complete review of the facts will confirm what has been alleged absolutely did not occur and a proper and thorough legal process will exonerate Luke, Leavitt said.What occurred three years ago in high school was not a crime and was not a sexual assault. It was a consensual relationship then and continued consensually between two young people, with both ultimately going their separate ways.These charges should never have been filed, certainly not three years later. However, thankfully, the Texas court system works, and will establish Lukes innocence.Luke Armstrong was a reserve fullback for Rice in 2018-2020. He was not listed on the Owls roster Thursday and a team spokesman did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment.According to the arrest affidavit issued April 1, the woman told police she met Luke Armstrong on June 20, 2018, and that she was intoxicated at a party two days later when she called him to pick her up. She didnt remember the ride but woke up in his house where she told police he sexually assaulted her and then drove her home.She made a recorded call to Armstrong on Dec. 8, 2020, during which Armstrong admitted to having sex with her at his fathers house a few years earlier, the affidavit said.The girl told police she informed six people that Armstrong had sex with her. Four of them remembered the girl describing the sex as nonconsensual, the affidavit said. One told police she interpreted what happened as consensual.Lance Armstrong won the Tour de France seven times before he was stripped of those titles following revelations he used performance-enhancing drugs for much of his career.",Lance Armstrong’s son charged with sexual assault from 2018,RICE

Somehow, things went out of control. The people here now want industry. If the BJP comes to power, we will work to bring investments in the area.""Manna, who is trying his best to keep the TMC flag flying in the constituency, said agro-based industries are best suited for the place.""A few agro-based industries have already come up in Singur. The TMC dispensation had been putting in efforts to make this area a major hub of agro-industries in the near future,"" he claimed.Srijan, the 28-year-old firebrand student leader, mocked both Bhattacharya and Manna over their assertions and said the TMC and the BJP are only repeating what the Left Front had said 15 years ago.""Both of them are shedding crocodile tears, having sensed the mood of the people. We had missed the bus back then. Only the Left, however, can change things for better,"" the SFI state secretary said.Singur -- once known for multiple crop farming - hogged the limelight after Tata Motors set its sight on the area to build its cheapest car manufacturing unit, Nano, in 2006.The Left Front government had acquired 997.11 acres along National Highway 2 and handed it over to the company.Leading from the front, the then opposition leader and TMC supremo Mamata Banerjee had called for a 26-day hunger strike, demanding the return of 347 acres that were apparently forcibly acquired.The TMC, which had a strong support base in the area with Bhattacharya as the sitting MLA, spearheaded a mass movement against the alleged acquisition.Despite numerous meetings and consultations between the TMC and the Left Front government, no solution was reached, and Tatas eventually moved out of Singur and built its plant in Gujarat's Sanand.Land acquired for the project was subsequently returned to locals in 2016.The Mamata Banerjee government, over the last few years, however, failed to turn the barren tracts fertile as it involvea huge expenditure, and many farmers ended up selling their plots.According to agricultural experts, with concrete pillars and cement slabs embedded in the land, at least seven to eight inches of topsoil will have to be removed to make the plots in Singur cultivable.The TMC dispensation, even after hosting various business summits, could not bag any investment for the constituency that had given the party the political heft to rise to power.Over the years, the Singur movement might have found a place in school textbooks, but the residents here continue to stare at a bleak future.""What did we get out of this agitation? Nothing. Now we feel it was all a mistake. We have no work, and our land has turned infertile. We are living in abject poverty,"" Biren Mondal, who got back his 60 Kottah of land in 2016, rued.The TMC, post its electoral reverses in the segment in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, took up the job of restoring the land; but large swathes still remain unproductive.""Even in the tracts that has been restored, crop production is not up to the mark, unlike what was the case two decades ago,"" said Mahadeb Das, a farmer who, too, was part of the movement.In villages of Gopalnagar, Khaserbheri, Beraberi, where huge tracts were acquired for the car project, at least 3,000 farmers and sharecroppers now thrive on Rs 2,000 cash and 16 kg rice provided by the TMC government, and most men in their families have moved out of Bengal in search of jobs.Gopal Das, who had willingly given up his land for the Tata project and had even got his sons trained for jobs in the Nano plant's ancillary units, curse the Singur movement.""After the Tata group left, my sons found no job for two years. I used to run a tea stall. Now they work at a car plant in Gurgaon. Had the locals and politicians not stopped the company from setting up the car manufacturing plant, a lot would have changed in Singur. Our children would have been living here, with us,"" he said.Riding on this resentment, the BJP made deep inroads in the area in 2019 by wresting the Hooghly Lok Sabha seat from the ruling TMC -- which experienced a significant dip in its vote share.Singur, one of the keenly watched seats this assembly elections, has 2,46,726 voters.The constituency is set to go to on April 10.","Bengal polls: 13 years after Tata's ouster, Singur seeks industrialisation",RICE

The spotlight was brought back on the humble solutions left behind by our forefathers. Tapping into one of them millets or whole grains is home chef Indra Narayan, with her debut eBook Millet Kitchen: The Simple Art of Millet Cooking.Fondly called the Millet Queen in her culinary circle, its been four years since Indra made a mindful switch to millets as her everyday staple. I underwent an eye surgery albeit without any health complications. But, the doctor felt I was obese and cautioned me to keep a tab on my weight. Over time, Ive experimented with this versatile ingredient in all possible ways. Ive even witnessed a significant change in my weight and lifestyle.Now, I have a dedicated following just for my millet recipes, narrates Indra Narayan, whos been actively sharing recipes on social media since 2012 and has 3,426 followers on Instagram. Documenting the recipes and presenting them in a palatable format to those who seek yet struggle to maintain a healthy lifestyle has been on her wishlist for a long time. It was in August 2020 when she decided to come out with an ebook that promises to handhold you through all aspects of millet cooking from starters to desserts. Well-wishers shared how my posts transformed their lives and they got into millet cooking.This inspired me to take my knowledge-sharing to the next level. The book has 25 simple and easy-to-make millet recipes that will serve as a perfect beginners guide, shares the 60-something homechef, who has won many competitions with her healthy recipes. Released on April 1, the 55- page book does not delve deep into a particular category of millets. Rather, it offers nofrills recipes that can be whipped up quickly with minimal ingredients in the pantry. For instance, Kodo millet Kashmiri pulav, millet halwa. Every recipe also comes with a tidbit on the type of millet used and its health significance.My decision to incorporate millet into my diet was well-thought-out after consulting Ayurvedic doctors. The whole grain offers a host of health benefits especially to those trying to make dietary modifications. There are a few myths that its not easy to digest. Id suggest you consult your doctor and read about them before taking a call. A common advice I give my followers is not to mix types of millets in one item. If you are making rice out of foxtail, stick to that.Dont mix other varieties such as kodo or barnyard, suggests Indra. First-timers need not worry. The glossary section at the end of the book ensures you get all the names of millets correct. The next book Im working on will deal with a specific category of millet. I wanted the first one to be light in its format. I come from a generation that ate and cooked good food to replenish the body and the soul. This book is a small effort to share with everyone.

In just two years, the area covered under the millet in the state has increased and production has doubled. With the State Government planning to introduce ragi under the Public Distribution System from May this year, the demand is expected to increase further.In the state, Ragi is grown in Bengaluru Rural, Bengaluru Urban, Chikkaballapur, Chitradurga, Chikkamagaluru, Hassan, Kolar, Mandya, Ramanagara, Tumkur, Ballari and Davangere districts. In 2018-19, ragi was sown in 5.55 lakh hectares, in 2019-20, it was in 6.74 lakh hectares and last year, it increased to 7.08 lakh hectares. The production, which was 6.78 lakh tonnes in 2018-19 shot up to 11 lakh tonnes in 2020-21 and this year, it is close to 13 lakh tonnes.Sources in the state agriculture department said there has been an increase in demand for ragi over the last few years. The pandemic came as a blessing last year with many people from cities returning to their hometowns in rural areas. The majority of them went back to farming, increasing the area under cultivation. Good rains this year too boosted the production.Food and Civil Supplies Minister Umesh Katti told The New Sunday Express that they were planning to distribute ragi to PDS beneficiaries from April, but had to delay it because of the by-elections. Starting May, we will distribute 3 kg ragi and 2 kg rice per person in the Old Mysuru region, where ragi is a staple. For this, we need 6.5 lakh tonnes per year. We have got the Union Governments approval for the scheme, he said.There demand for this healthy millet in the international market too. Prof M B Rajegowda, an Agrometeorologist, who was earlier with the University of Agricultural Sciences (UAS), said ragi is sold for $1.25 to $1.5 per kilo in the United States, which comes to around Rs 100 per kilo. But in Karnataka, it is sold for Rs 30 to Rs 35 per kilo. The State Government is helping farmers with quality testing, allowing its increased export. People have realised the value of ragi and there is a potential for its sales to grow, he added.","Humble ragi back in demand, production doubles in two years",RICE

Since we cant meet the elders in the family to take their blessings, we will connect with them over the phone.I hope art and culture will break the barriers and go beyond different traditions and communities.Arts continues to thriveVyshnavie Sainath | Photo Credit: Special arrangementVyshnavie Sainath, dancerMy grandmother instilled excitement in us for Puthandu and would encourage us to buy new clothes. Paati would also make special food and students in my dance centre add extra cheer by wishing Puthandu vazthukal.Our celebrations will be intimate this year starting with puja and my mother (dancer Rajeswari Sainath) is already on a long call with paati to get the recipes right. The pandemic has taught me many things and I want to fearlessly implement them. It has shown me that despite the fear and uncertainty, students/parents/practitioners have not given up on their art and have swiftly shifted to the online platform. It only reinforces the belief in me that arts can adapt to every situation. I pray that the year gets better and I can perform live.Combining traditionsAshwin Nair and Nikita Kak | Photo Credit: Special arrangementStand-up comedian Ashwin Nair and Nikita KakThis year we will be combining the traditions of Navreh and Vishu. Interestingly, Kashmiris and Malayalis place a thali type arrangement of food items in front of the image of KrishnaWe celebrate Navreh by filling a plate with rice, vegetables and fruits called Thaal bharun and cook favourite recipes like Teheri and dum aloo. I miss going to my home town but will connect with them virtually.As children, we were always excited to see the Vishu kani (a beautiful platter of vegetables, fruits, grains, flowers, gold, cash and clothes and jewellery in front of a photo or statue of Vishnu) and receive money from our grandparents. Growing up we realise the pleasure of seeing such prosperity and receive such gifts at the start of the year. Vishu is a time to celebrate the year, the summer solstice and usher in joy and prosperity.The pandemic has limited our interaction with family back in Kerala but we still look forward to celebrating a smaller version of Vishu at home with my wife and mother. Our sweetest memories of Vishu were being surrounded by cousins and extended family and waking up to the Vishu kani with our grandmother and receiving the kaineetam and eating a rich sadhya as children.It was a time of celebrating in every way  beautiful sights, food and the joy of receiving pocket moneySubdued festivitiesMayanand Thakur | Photo Credit: Special arrangementMayanand Thakur, theatre actorWe hoist Gudi (stick, flag, garland of flowers, mango leaves, neem tree leaves and upturned silver or copper vessel on the top) on top of a building or apartment balcony. Gudi padwa is a festival of rituals and traditional food especially a tangy chutney prepared with neem leaves and flowers, grated raw mango, jaggery, pepper and chilli powder with a seasoning of hing and cumin and mustard seeds. This chutney is tasty and also good for health as it improves digestion. Another ritual is to bathe with neem leaves- soaked water that keeps our body cool.We missed grand celebrations due to the pandemic last year and unfortunately, the celebrations will be subdued considering the situation now and keeping each others safety as a priority. My most loved quote during the pandemic is: We isolate now, so when we gather again, no one is missing.New beginningsNidarshana Saikia Das | Photo Credit: Special arrangementNidarshana Saikia Das, entrepreneurRongali Bihu is a celebration of spring and of youth, hence the Bihu dance takes centre stage. Young and old sing, dance and play instruments like the dhol and pepa mostly in the fields and underneath the trees. Thankfully, some Bihu functions still make room for mukoli Bihu (where everyone can dance together). And dancing underneath peepal trees have tiptoed into verandahs and drawing rooms during private home parties.This time of the year is ritualistically spent in Assam but these two pandemic-struck years have been exceptions and we miss the fun of Rongali Bihu in our homeland. We usually plan a get-together with our Assamese friends in Hyderabad but with rising cases, it will be a traditional meal with just the family.In Assam too, my aged parents will be home as the situation is aggravating.I belong to Nagaon, a small town and we used to make a ritualistic trip to the village to soak in traditions and make and savour traditional foods. The whole day wed have these small groups of children and young adults, dressed in traditional attires, flocking from a home to another, singing and performing Bihu dance, collecting money to have a feast at the end. Many a time the hosts would join in.It is quite a sight to soak in  be it Bihu songs celebrating spring, exquisite dance moves, unique musical instruments and of course the food. These become very important windows for our children to a culture theyre fast getting detached from.Foster friendshipsTejdeep Kaur Menon | Photo Credit: Special arrangementTejdeep Kaur Menon, IPS (Retd)We usually have a huge congregation of 10,000 people during Vaisakhi; Singers from different parts of Punjab come here to perform shabd kirtan but we will be missing it this year. The celebrations have become a personal affair. People may visit the Gurudwara on their own but congregations and huge celebrations are not allowed. During this time, I usually have a blue salwar kurta ready for the festival as blue is the colour we wear on the day to go to Gurudwara. I plan to make kadha parshad at home and share it with neighbours.My big wish is for normalcy to return lessons learnt from the pandemic. We should realise life is fleeting and spend good quality time with each other and foster friendships at home and outside.I long to see my granddaughter too play with her friends with the freedom with which we played outside.Every year I get kirpan on Vaisakhi day from the community. It is a rare honour for a woman to receive it but this year I am going to miss it.",New Year flavours from across India,RICE
2021-04-12,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/vishukkanji-and-vishukkatta-are-vishu-specials-in-some-parts-of-kerala/article34302158.ece,"Ahead of Vishu 2021, we examine the popularity of Vishukkanji and Vishukkatta and how they are prepared at different households in the northern KeralaGolden yellow blooms of kanikkonna or Indian laburnum herald the arrival of the festival of Vishu in April. Vishukkani, the tradition of opening your eyes to witness the bounty of Nature, gold and God and the practice of receiving money from elders as Vishukaineetam are all integral to the festival. Then, of course, the joy in bursting crackers and feasting on the sadya.The festival has many regional variations. The celebrations are at its zenith in northern Kerala. Vishukkanji and Vishukkatta, for instance, are prepared only on the day of Vishu in those regions. If Vishukkanji, a gruel with rice and coconut or coconut milk is special for Palakkad and some parts of Kozhikode, Vishukkatta or rice cake cooked in coconut milk is a speciality of Thrissur district.Vishukkanji and butter beans stir fry | Photo Credit: Spicy N TastyEven the kanji has its variations. The simplest method is cooking unakkalari (raw rice with bran) and adding a generous amount of grated coconut to it at the end. We have it with a stir-fried curry, generally prepared with puliyavara (butter beans or Lima beans), says Vishnukumari A, a native of Kannambra in Palakkad, now settled in Kannur.The popular preparation of kanji has puliyavara and split green gram cooked with any variety of rice, such as puzhukkalari (red rice), pachari (raw rice) or Ponniyari (full-boiled rice). Both puliyavara and green gram are dry roasted. The former is pounded so that the outer skin, which is hard, comes off. If you are using whole green gram, it is better to pound it after dry roasting the same.Kanji wont be tasty if the skin is not removed. It can cause indigestion as well. We keep puliyavara as one of the items in the Vishukkani and the same beans is used in the gruel, says Lakshmi Kutty PP, a homemaker from Kallekulangara in Palakkad. Cumin, ghee or pepper can be added to up the taste of the gruel. If jackfruit is available, we make puzhukku (raw jackfruit cooked with coconut paste and spices) as the side dish, she adds.A different spinVishukkanji is usually served for breakfast on the festival day. In our tharavadu (ancestral home), it is served from 10.30 am onwards and is had for lunch as well. We dont prepare the sadya, says Manjula Jyothiprakash, a YouTube food blogger (Spicy N Easy) from Alathur in Palakkad.Vishukkanji (Palakkad style) Cook raw rice (1/2 cup), Matta rice (1/2 cup), split green gram (1/2 cup, dry roasted and with skin), and puliyavara or butter beans (2 tsp, dry roast and pound to remove the skin) with salt (as required) and water (one litre) in a pressure cooker. Switch off the stove after six whistles. Add water to adjust the consistency and cook. When the gruel boils, mix grated coconut (1 cup). Have it hot with a side-dish of your choice or pappadams or rice fritters.Courtesy: Spicy 'N' EasyI use both pachari (raw rice) and Ponniyari in equal quantities. Although some people cook the rice in coconut milk, I find it more tasty with grated coconut. In our house, we have stir-fried puliyavara as the side-dish. For this, the puliyavara has to be soaked overnight. Pappadams and rice kondattam (rice fritters) make it an even more tastier spread, says Manjula.However, neither puliyavara nor green gram figure in the gruel prepared by Kozhikode-based Hemalatha Chandran. I use nellu kuthari (par-boiled rice). Once the rice is almost cooked in water, ground cumin is mixed to it. Then coconut milk is added (first add second extract or randaam paal followed by the thick first extract or onnaam paal) and boiled. Add salt and adjust the consistency. It is more like a jeeraka (cumin) kanji, she says. The side-dish is stir-fried raw banana and long beans.Vishukkatta is a rice cake cooked in coconut milk and is often had with jaggery syrup | Photo Credit: Aswathy ManuVishukkatta is made with pachari. It is cooked in randaam paal and water. Once the rice is cooked and water dries, salt and the thick onnaam paal is added. Keep stirring it until it reaches the consistency of halwa. Grease a plate with some coconut milk and transfer the preparation on to it. Once it cools, it can be cut into pieces, says Anitha Hari from Edamuttam in Thrissur. A breakfast or pre-lunch dish, it tastes best with jaggery syrup.  We also have it with inji puli (tangy dish made with ginger, tamarind and jaggery), she adds.Karayappam, a different version of unniyappam (deep-fried dumpling with rice flour, banana and jaggery) is made in parts of Kannur on Vishu day. It has sugar instead of jaggery and is slightly bigger than the unniyappam. It is an offering for the deity when we arrange the Vishukkani, says Indira Jayadas from Vadakara.Vishukkatta is a rice cake cooked in coconut milk and is often eat with jaggery syrup | Photo Credit: Aswathy ManuAlthough the Vishu feast is usually a vegetarian affair, non-vegetarian dishes are also served in several households. Pork is a favourite in some families in Thrissur and Ernakulam. In some parts of Palakkad district, a meat dish (chicken or mutton) with ash gourd is prepared on the next day of Vishu. Meat masala and fish fry are a must on the leaf! As in the case of Onam, we begin the sadya with pazham-pappadam kuzhachathu (a mix of mashed banana, sugar, pappadam, ghee and nuts). Cherupayar parippu (split green gram) pradhaman is the payasam of the day, says Indira.",Celebrating Vishu with ‘Vishukkanji’ and ‘Vishukkatta’,RICE
2021-04-12,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/crowd-of-23-candidates-floods-special-congressional-election-in-texas/articleshow/82031084.cms,"United States Capitol (File photo)WASHINGTON: The race to succeed the only sitting US congressman to have died from Covid-19 has drawn a free-for-all of 23 candidates in a Republican-leaning district of north Texas , where Democrats have made gains in recent years.Representative Ron Wright, a Republican, succumbed to Covid-19 in February. The May 1 special election to replace him will be the first test of the Texas electorate, where Democrats hope to advance, since President Joe Biden 's 2020 election victory.With so many people competing to represent the suburban Dallas-Fort Worth area, the special election is expected to produce a summer runoff between the two top performers. The contest could pit a Republican against a Democrat or feature two Republicans, depending on the results of the May 1 vote.The race may be the most competitive of several special elections this year to replace House members who have either died or gone to work for Biden's administration. Others will be held in New Mexico in June and Ohio in November; the date for a Florida special election has not been set.Every House seat counts. Democrats currently have just a seven-seat majority in the chamber and will be battling to keep it in next year's mid-term congressional election.The sheer number of candidates in the Texas district - ten Democrats, 11 Republicans, an independent and a Libertarian - suggests anything can happen. Early voting starts April 19. If no one gets a majority on May 1, the governor will schedule the runoff.Wright's widow Susan, a conservative party activist with a string of endorsements from Texas Republicans, is thought by analysts to have the edge over a Republican field that includes Texas state legislator Jake Ellzey; two former Trump administration officials, Brian Harrison and Sery Kim; and an anti-Trump Republican, Michael Wood.Prominent Democratic candidates include Jana Lynne Sanchez, who Wright defeated in 2018; Lydia Bean, who lost a 2020 race for the Texas state legislature; and Shawn Lassiter, a Black former science teacher.The north Texas region has sent a Republican congressman to Washington since the 1980s, but Trump only narrowly won the district last year.Democrats are a relevant force and if they dont overly fragment their own vote, should be able to place a Democratic nominee in the runoff,"" said Mark Jones, a political science professor at Rice University.The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the party's congressional campaign arm, has not thrown its weight behind anyone.Last year Democrats made a big play for Texas in the congressional election by targeting ten seats including the 6th district, but they lost all of them. The late Wright beat a Democrat by nearly nine points in November.Democrats think they have a chance in May if their voters turn out.""In a special election you can have disproportionate turnout and it gives Democrats a shot here,"" said Matt Angle of the Lone Star Project, a Democratic political action committee.Others are doubtful.""As much as they may talk about flipping this congressional district, their recent track record suggests that's unlikely to happen,"" said Joshua Blank, research director at the Texas Politics Project at the University of Texas at Austin.Former President Donald Trump has not endorsed anyone in the race.",Crowd of 23 candidates floods special congressional election in Texas,RICE

The paddy production this season was 61,89,000 tonnes compared to 57,11,000 tonnes in the 2019-2020 Rabi season.These figures were part of the third advance estimates released by the department of economics and statistics and might vary in the final estimates to be presented later. As per the statistics, the increase in production has been attributed to three factors: more area brought under cultivation of paddy, better water availability and no heavy rains during the Rabi season.The area of paddy cultivation was increased to 8,81,000 hectares in the 2020-21 Rabi season from 8,05,000 hectares in the 2019-20 Rabi season. However, yield per hectare has decreased this Rabi compared to the previous one. As per the estimates, the yield per hectare this year was 7,025 kgs while it was 7,095 kgs per hectare in the last Rabi.It is true that the area of cultivation has increased and there was good ground water and sufficient water in reservoirs, but a couple of moderate rains in between and delay in transplantation of paddy from nurseries might have resulted in the low yield per hectare. With low moisture content, the percentage of broken rice is increasing. Millers are suggesting us to harvest the crop even if there is one or two per cent more moisture, Koti Reddy, a farmer in Dagadarthi mandal of Nellore district said.His family has cultivated paddy in 30 acres of land and hoped to get a good harvest to overcome the nightmare called Nivar cyclone. However, fall in quality is a worrying factor for Reddys family. We have only harvested a part of it and hope the quality of the rest is better, he said.Sriramulu, another farmer in Nellore, said that the government has to ensure that millers do not exploit the farmers in the name of quality and see that they get a fair price. He said it should negotiate with the Food Corporation of India for taking more boiled rice variety.In East Godavari district, harvesting of paddy commenced a week ago and is expected to continue for the next one month. Compared to previous Rabi and Kharif, the production is better. Hopefully, we will recover the losses suffered during Kharif, said Subba Reddy, a farmer in Kakinada rural. As per the advance estimates, the total food grains production this Rabi is estimated to be 90,10,000 tonnes compared to the previous Rabi production of 82,95,000 tonnes.Rabi yield61,89,000 tonnes paddy production in Rabi 2020-2157,11,000 tonnes paddy production in Rabi 2019-20",Farmers heave a sigh of relief as paddy production in Rabi increases,RICE

Since festivals last year were cancelled, most artistes were asked to perform this year at the same temples. But 2021 has also proved to be disastrous.We are losing opportunities this year too.

I know you have to step out of the house to earn a living, but I appeal to you to leave your home only when its absolutely necessary. I also appeal to the youth that when you do step out, do so only after wearing a mask and following COVID-19 protocols.There is very little stock of plasma in the Capital. If you are eligible to donate plasma please do so. Over the past few months there have been fewer cases so there are fewer eligible donors.Planned surgeries need to be delayed at hospitals.

Although he transitioned to a career in food and beverages from science, his new book, The Flavor Equation , goes behind the recipes to investigate the science of taste, combining his knowledge of chemistry with the mysteries of flavour pairings. The popular food columnist, blogger and recipe developer spoke toabout the Indian influences on his writing and also on mainstream American cuisine. Edited excerpts from the interview.They go hand-in-hand. Ive always felt cooking in the kitchen is just like being in a lab but with a tastier outcome. Recipe writing is just like writing experiments -- things work and sometimes they dont. Thats when you try to understand what is happening and how to fix it. A large part of recipe development is also problem-solving and creating solutions. This is where science comes in. For example, for the longest time, the paneer I made in America was too soft with a ricotta-like consistency -- a problem I never encountered in India. It turned out the calcium levels in cows milk is lower than that of buffalos milk used in India. To fix this, I simply needed to increase the amount of calcium and curdle the milk. Calcium chloride, an ingredient commonly used in cheese-making, does both these things. It gives the extra calcium and also the acid to help the milk proteins change their shape and turn into a firm block of paneer.Growing up in India, Ive been fortunate to experience and taste food from different regions as well as see and appreciate Indian ingredients and techniques for their versatility. In India, you can travel through various states and a staple ingredient like rice will morph as it moves from biryanis to fermented batters that make dosas and idlis. It gives me a sense of how ingenuity comes into play as recipes reflect adaptations to changes in geography and culture.While I dont think were exactly there yet, I do think we are on our way to seeing Indian food and ingredients in more homes than earlier. I think this is one of the most exciting times to be cooking Indian food in America because people are genuinely excited to learn about new flavours and ingredients. The works of chefs and writers like the late Floyd Cardoz, Asha Gomez, Tejal Rao, Priya Krishna, and several others are certainly helping cement the prominence of Indian cuisine in America.Cooking and for that matter even appreciating flavour, is something we learn through trial and error over time. It is experiential. Ive learnt to cook by watching my family and friends as well as through cookbooks, magazines, television shows and also working as a pastry cook in a patisserie. Flavour is a wide umbrella that not only encompasses the taste and aroma of the ingredients in our food but it also involves the interplay of our senses -- the shapes and colours of the food we eat, the different textures of food, and even the sounds food makes as we cook and eat. I remember being taught in India to pay attention to the sound of cumin and mustard seeds popping when preparing a tadka. We are constantly using all sorts of sensory cues in our cooking. And then theres the interplay of our emotions and memories that influences our perception of flavour. We love some flavours more than others, be it something we experienced in childhood or something tied into our cultures. The Flavour Equation is a book that gets into all these different facets from a nerdy-yet-fun lens with the recipes acting as enticing experiments.Living in two very different parts of the world gave me the opportunity to not only taste new food but also compare and contrast. You start to notice how people and culture define food. Often, similar beloved combinations exist throughout the world. They just get painted with different spices and are cooked in different ways -- for example, mashed potatoes and meat is a popular dish in the West but in Mumbai, potato chops provide that same degree of comforting flavours and textures where ground meat is encased in a shell of smooth, mashed potatoes before being shaped and pan-fried.My blog started out as a way for me to talk about the Indian food I didnt see in restaurants or in magazines and an opportunity to show the versatility of Indian ingredients and techniques in Western cooking. I dont see myself as an expert on Indian food since I certainly dont know all there is to Indian cuisine but I do my best to share the food I enjoy cooking at home with people. Its been a long journey but one that Ive thoroughly enjoyed. While there are plenty of common misconceptions on Indian cooking, I try to do my best through my work to show people that they can easily incorporate a lot of those flavours in their own cooking at home. Over time, Ive been fortunate to write for outlets such asandIt has certainly helped me share my food with a larger audience.There is an incomparable joy that I nd difficult to express in words when I eat ripe Indian mangoes. During ripening, the starch transforms and gives way to a soft pulp thats sweet and sour, carrying an aroma that reminds me of warm summer holidays in Goa. While mangoes are delicious as a sweet treat, they also make an excellent addition to savoury applications. The fruity, sweet avour of mangoes with lime gives this beet salad a refreshing taste. Try to use a good ripe mango without a chalky aftertaste. Its no surprise that I recommend Indian mangoes, but champagne mangoes are a good option. Youll find paneer in the cheese section at Indian grocery stores as well as most regular food markets.Paneer is not a salty cheese, so the marinade must contain a bit more salt for the cheese to absorb.The salad dressing provides a second layer of flavour as well as salt.While paneer is one of the easiest cheeses you can make at home, I prefer the store-bought variety in this application, where shape and structural integrity are important. It takes the pressure of an extremely heavyweight to bring together the protein molecules in the paneer and force them to coalesce, producing a firm, compact paneer that can hold its shape when cut and cooked. Commercial producers have equipment that generates sufficient pressure; its a little tricky to do this at home but Ive developed a method that you can use; otherwise, store-bought is perfectly fine.Whisk the ker, salt, cumin, turmeric, chilli powder, and black pepper in a small bowl. Taste and season with more salt if needed. Pour the marinade into a large resealable bag.Cut the paneer into approximately 1 by 2 by  in [2.5 cm by 5 cm by 12 mm] cubes and place them in the bag with the marinade, seal, and gently shake to coat evenly. Let the paneer marinate for one hour at room temperature. If you need to marinate it longer, leave it in the refrigerator.Preheat the oven to 400F [204C].While the paneer marinates, prepare the beets. Peel, trim the ends, and cut into quarters. Place the beets in a baking dish or roasting tray, drizzle with the olive oil, and season with salt. Roast for 30 to 45 minutes, until they are tender on the inside and a knife slides through the centre with ease. Remove from the oven and let them rest for 10 minutes.While the beets roast, prepare the dressing. Place the mango, ker, oil, lime juice, mustard, pepper, and chilli powder into a blender and pulse on slow speed until combined and smooth. Taste and season with salt.Grill the paneer just before youre ready to assemble the salad. Heat a cast-iron grill pan or a medium non-stick sauce pan over medium-high heat and brush the surface with a little olive oil. With a pair of kitchen tongs, carefully lift the paneer out of the bag and cook it in batches in the hot pan until it turns golden brown and is slightly seared,two to three minutes per side.To serve, toss the arugula in a large mixing bowl with the olive oil. Add the pepper and season with salt. Add the warm grilled paneer pieces. Drizzle with a few tablespoons of the salad dressing. Sprinkle with the amchur just before serving.Serve the remaining salad dressing on the side.",Science and spices go hand-in-hand for LA chef Nik Sharma,RICE

Though harvest operations were complete in most locations, the delay in procurement is expected to affect the next cycle of cultivation as well.Protests heldEarlier last month, farmers in the Neendoor and Kallara regions had organised protests against rice mill owners for delaying the procurement of paddy citing unfair reasons.

Besides, several tonnes of harvested paddy kept in paddy polders to be shifted to rice mills got drenched in the rain.According to paddy farmers and officials, the upper Kuttanad region has been the worst affected. In the Chennithala region, paddy in 500 hectares has been destroyed/submerged. Farmers in Mannar, Thalavady and other parts of the region too suffered losses.With the weather agency predicting rain in the coming days, the farmers are a worried lot. Apart from fields with standing crops getting submerged, the harvested paddy stored in the polders or in the open, due to lack of proper storage facilities, also gets damaged. Farmers said that due to the high moisture content in the rain-soaked paddy, rice mills were demanding wastage up to 15 kg per quintal of paddy. This wi resulting in friction between the farmers and mills.We cannot do much about rain destroying standing crops. But authorities can ensure the procurement of harvested paddy in a time-bound manner.

Toshiba is a wonderful company and is Japans precious wealth. I love Toshiba deeply, Mr. Kurumatani said in his message.The CVC deal is estimated to be worth 2 trillion yen ($18 billion) and will turn Toshiba private. Toshiba had said it was giving it careful consideration. Osamu Nagayama, a board member, told reporters the proposal lacked details and could not yet be evaluated.Trading in the companys shares was suspended when the news hit last week. Shares of Toshiba, whose sprawling business includes making elevators and railways, shot up on the CVC news and have been trading at nearly 5,000 yen ($46).CVC is a European private equity firm, based in Luxembourg, which has committed nearly $162 billion in funds, managing more than 300 investors. It declined to comment on the acquisition proposal or the presidents resignation.But speculation has been growing other funds may offer better prices.Mr. Kurumatani will be replaced as chief executive and president by his predecessor, Satoshi Tsunakawa, who remained on the board, first as COO and currently chairman.Mr. Tsunakawa oversaw some of the recent financial challenges at Toshiba. Before becoming CEO, in his previous stint from 2016, he had headed Toshibas medical systems business, now a group company of Japanese camera and equipment maker Canon.Mr. Tsunakawa told reporters Toshiba was ready to embark on growth as an infrastructure services company. He promised to work in the interests of shareholders, employees and society overall, and continue to strengthen governance.We stand behind the principle of Do the right thing, he said, delivering the motto in English.Toshiba, founded in 1875, was long revered as one of Japans respected brands, developing the nations first radar and microwaves, electric rice cookers and laptop computers.It also invented flash memory, the ubiquitous computer chips that store and retain data for digital cameras, cell phones and other gadgets. Toshiba no longer makes laptops, and it has sold its computer chips division.The companys fortunes began to crumble over its heavy investment in nuclear power. After the March 2011 nuclear disaster in Fukushima, costs of the business ballooned because of growing safety concerns. Some nations are turning toward sustainable energy.Toshiba also had massive losses from the nuclear power operations of U.S. manufacturer Westinghouse, which Toshiba acquired in 2006. Westinghouse filed for bankruptcy protection in 2017.In Japan, Toshiba is decommissioning nuclear plants, including the one in Fukushima, where the tsunami 10 years ago set off multiple reactor meltdowns.In 2015, Toshiba acknowledged it had been systematically falsifying its books since 2008, as managers tried to meet overly ambitious targets. An outside investigation found it had inflated profits and hid massive expenses.",Japan’s Toshiba president steps down amid acquisition talks,RICE

(Source: Getty Images/Thinkstock)The Holy month of Ramadan has officially begun in India (from April 14) and will continue for 30 days  till May 13. During this period, devotees observe day-long fasts or roza that require them to avoid food and water. Hence, it is only natural to feel tired and hungry by the evening meal for Iftar.However, instead of straightaway opting for foods that might make you feel bloated, it is important to first replenish the lost liquids to prevent dehydration.The first meal after a long fast should be small and include foods that give instant electrolytes, fluid, and some sugar. This is why traditionally Iftar includes a lot of drinks, fruits, dates, etc. The best way to replace lost fluids and electrolytes is to break your fast with coconut water or salty lemon water with a small amount of quickly absorbed fruit sugar from two dates, prunes, dry figs or fresh fruit, mentioned nutritionist Rashi Chowdhury in an Instagram post.ALSO READ | Ramadan 2021: Date, sehri and iftar timings, prayer time table, significance, and fasting rulesWhat is a perfect Sehri or pre-dawn meal?According to lifestyle coach Luke Coutinho,Foods that quench thirst such as cucumber, zucchini, buttermilk, curd, melon, bananaComplex carbohydrates to keep one feeling full and energetic including oats, jowar, ragi, sugar-free muesli, whole wheatProteins for repair and growth including egg, pulses, sattu and nutsGood fats for satiety, vital functions, hormones and fat-soluble vitamins including cold-pressed oil of your choice, organic A2 ghee, avocadoWhat should you have when breaking the fast?What can help?Take a prayer break or a quick workout session before you have your bigger meal, said Chowdhury.For your main meal or dinner, your plate should have 30 per cent clean carbs, 30 per cent good proteins, and 30 per cent of high fibre vegetables. Carbs could be sweet potato or rice or millets like jowar, bajra, amaranth. Get your proteins from meat, chicken, fish or daal (please soak the lentils for 12 hours before cooking), mentioned Chowdhury.According to Coutinho, khichdi, a meal with a combination of dal and rice, pot meals, and well-cooked farm-fed chicken are dinner meals that are easy on the gut.However, the key lies in portion control.Its very important to watch your portion of fruits as you wouldnt want to overdo it if youre diabetic, have PCOS, insulin resistance or youre trying to lose weight, she mentioned.What to avoid?Avoid sugar, desserts and fruit juices that will raise your blood-sugar immediately. This is going to mess up with your insulin levels, especially when you fast the next day, leaving you with cravings and low energy levels, mentioned Chowdhury.For more lifestyle news, follow us: Twitter: lifestyle_ie | Facebook: IE Lifestyle | Instagram: ie_lifestyle",Ramadan 2021: Some essential fasting tips,RICE

However, it had no mention of the One Nation One Ration Card policy.The Centre had halted the launch of the scheme, which was scheduled for March 25, after raising objections on its proposed name in Delhi  Mukhya Mantri Ghar Ghar Ration Yojana. The name gives an impression that the scheme is run by the state, while the foodgrains come from the Centre at highly subsidised rates, the Centre had contented.The Delhi Cabinet then dropped the name of the scheme. The Centre has also questioned one of the components of the proposed scheme that involves collection of the cost of subsidised food grains and a specified amount as milling/conversion charges from beneficiaries.According to the notification of the doorstep scheme, millers empaneled with the Delhi State Civil Supplies Corporation Ltd (DSCSC) will be tasked with lifting wheat and rice from the godowns of the Food Corporation of India (FCI).

But it cant be used to provide individual benefits. If the Centre treats the pandemic as a natural calamity and finalises a methodology to decide on the category of affected people, then the state can give individual benefits to people.The official added that the affected people, who could be covered under the National Food Security Act, can be given Rs 100 per day during the period of restrictions. Who have been affected can be decided based on the restrictions imposed from time to time since April 5.

Earlier, the state government had permitted 500 people at outdoor events and 200 at indoor programmes.Khattar said, It is the constitutional right of every person to protest. We do not have a problem with anyone protesting in a peaceful manner. However, the situation due to rising Covid cases is a matter of concern. This is not the right time to protest.I once again appeal to the farmers to withdraw their movement on humanitarian grounds.

The site, at the eastern side of Jharkhands Sitagraha hills, has been cordoned off by security personnel.Earlier this year, the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) announced a major discovery here  remains of a sprawling Buddhist monastery at least 900 years old, full of small and large statues of Buddhist deities, along with some Shaivite remains.Bhagwan ke darshan karne aaye hain, Prajapati, a skilled labourer trying to make his way to the site, said. He said he was hoping the excavation would continue for some time, so he could perhaps find a job at the site. Already, shops selling tea and sugarcane juice have come up at some distance from the site; villagers claimed there were days when up to 5,000 people came to look at the statues.Among the ASIs discoveries were four statues of Taras, the saviouresses of the Thunderbolt Vehicle, displaying the Varada mudra, a hand gesture signifying the dispensing of boons; and six statues of the Buddha in the Bhumisparsha mudra, with all five fingers of his right hand extended towards the earth, symbolising his enlightenment. Remnants of a statue of the Shaivite goddess Maheswari, with a coiled crown and chakra, appear to suggest a degree of cultural assimilation at the site.We had excavated this area in November 2019 Since January 31 this year, we focused on a mound near Juljul Pahar in the Sitagarhi hills, where we found remains of a Buddhist monastery-cum-shrine, with an open courtyard and rooms along the sides, Assistant Archeologist Niraj Kumar Mishra of Excavator Branch III, Patna, said.Soon after the findings were widely known, two of the statues disappeared from the site. The thieves were arrested in Ranchi a week later and the statues were recovered, but the incident underlined the neglect that the priceless archaeological site faced.Mahesh Tigga, mukhiya of Gurhet panchayat, said: Buddhist relics have been found at several places in this area. We have asked the government to build a museum here. We will not allow the statues to be taken away from our land.The first archaeological discoveries in this area were made some three decades ago. In 1992, veteran environmentalist and tribal arts conservationist Bulu Imam, convener of the Hazaribagh chapter of the Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (INTACH), stumbled upon pottery and remains of Buddhist relics and statues here. Imam reported the discovery of painted grey ware (PGW) pottery, a votive stupa, a black basalt apsara torso, and an eight-petalled astadala lotus inscribed on stone.Remains of a vihara, stupa, and village with iron smelting siter alongside in a Sarna or sacred grove which yielded PGW fragments are confirmed. It seems that several tanks and wells and villages in the region were once part of comprehensive Vihara on the pilgrim route to Midnapore (Tamralipti), Imam wrote (Damodar Valley Civilisation, 2001)Imam estimated the antiquity of the Buddhist sites of Hazaribagh from 300 BC to the period of the Palas (8th to 12th centuries AD) and the Sena (11th-12th centuries). The monastery that has now been excavated lies on the old trade route from Varanasi to Tamralipti, via Sherghati in Gaya district and Sitagraha hills in Jharkhand.A lot of Hazaribagh district is forested, and is home to the Birhor tribals to whom Juljul Pahar is sacred. Every year on Buddha Purnima and other occasions of religious significance, local people go to the top of the hill with offerings of rice and milk. Besides the remains of the ancient vihara, the hill has a 65-foot stone face that the Birhors revere as Mahadeva.Imam, who is now 79 and runs a museum that contains neolithic artefacts and collections of the local Khovar and Sohrai paintings, told The Indian Express that he had been trying to get the central government to relocate a BSF firing range in the area from the early 1990s.However, till date, the firing range remains as it is I informed ASI in 1992, but it took them close to 30 years to begin excavating this major Buddhist site The ASIs recent findings are the most significant archaeological discovery in Jharkhand in modern India. No other intact Buddha statue of this beauty and quality, around 4 feet tall and with heavy back support typical of the time of the Palas, has been found Even in Bihar only a few statues of this quality have been found, he said.Imams discoveries were confirmed in the ASIs report on Exploration in districts Hazaribagh and Chatra, 1995. The report, published in 2000, said: Historical sites at Sitagarh yielded evidence of three circular brick structures besides one habitational mound, while Itkori yielded temple remains alongside a huge habitational area. At both these sites were noticed the sculptures of both Brahmanical and Buddhist pantheon. At Itkori a large number of sculptures, majority of which comprised votive stupas, were noticed. These sculptures belong to the Pala period, and only a few of these are inscribed.Imam believes the Chinese scholar Hiuen Tsang (Xuan Zang) may have visited Sitagraha during his travels in India in the 7th century. His visitations were very complex, but at that time, he could have gone back to China through one of only two routes, from Mayurbhanj in Odisha and Tamralipti in Bengal, he said.","By a hill in Jharkhand, Buddhist remains from a millennium ago",RICE

However, a few sprigs of hope have appeared on the horizon with more and more citizens getting vaccinated. For those who are infected and isolating at home, we have better facilities this year to make the process easier.A few caterers and organisations in Hyderabad have introduced food packages for the infected. These can ease the burden on those who are living alone or the ones who do not want to pass on the infection to other more vulnerable family members. This has also helped failing food businesses find new avenues to make money.In this piece, we talk to a few of the package providers and know what they are offering.Mini and big thalisAnil Agarwal of Sai Kailash Dhaba started supplying meals for the Covid-affected as charity last year, but when he saw the high number of infected persons, he decided to take it up commercially. ""Till now, we have delivered 3,000 vegetarian meals. We dispatch 400 thalis to areas all over the city every day. We bear the delivery charges if 5-6 orders come from one house, but otherwise we use bike services to deliver the meals,"" shares Anil. The dhaba offers 14-day Mini Home Thalis and Home Thalis at Rs 4,000 and Rs 6,000 respectively. The packages include lunch and dinner only.A family affairAnand Sanghi, who runs a catering business called Sanghi Caterers in Old City for the last 15 years, is still recovering from the blow that the pandemic dealt to his venture. Faced with the prospect of going bankrupt, he started delivering meals to people who are quarantining at home. When the number of cases dwindled after October last year, he was hopeful that his business would return to its glory days. But unfortunately, he sighs, the second wave has dashed all his hopes. ""We are working full capacity and supplying 20-25 meals per day. The number of cases rose astronomically in the last one month. We provide pure vegetarian meals three times a day. My wife cooks the food and my family members deliver it within 25 km radius. If someone lives beyond that, one can use other apps to get the food delivered at their doorstep,"" shares Anand. It has become difficult to find staff to deliver food due to the scorching sun outside now, he adds. Their package costs Rs 9,000 for 14 days.Fresh meals and immunity-boosting powderNikhil, who started a Covid package from his establishment called 7thecloudkitchen three days ago, provides breakfast, lunch and dinner to the affected quarantining at home. Speaking about the venture, he says: For now, I am focussed on providing quality food to the consumers and not looking for profits. That is why the customer has to pay only the production cost of the food and the delivery charges. One of the highlights of his offer is that it comes with a special immunity-boosting Ayurvedic powder from Kerala. We have been using the powder in our family, and by Gods grace, no one has contracted the virus so far. I also provide the ghee with which the powder has to be consumed. Besides these, we provide fruits, soups and rice kanji for diabetics. All our food items are made in ghee. The package costs Rs 650 per person per day. They deliver vegetarian and non-vegetarian meals all over the city.Food, lodging and medical careThe Jain Relief Foundation has gone a step ahead and arranges food and lodging for people affected by coronavirus. They also have a nurse on the premises round-the-clock and daily visits by doctors. People from all faiths can avail the facilities. Talking to Express, Prashant Kocheta and Pramod Jain from the foundation said: ""We take care of every worry of patients so that they have the required mental peace to bounce back to health.

We have ensured that the nurse and doctors who come in contact with the patients are vaccinated. In emergency cases, we have helped patients get shifted to hospitals.""

Four MPs including NCP chief and former agriculture minister Sharad Pawar have also sought the re-run of the scheme which was launched last year during the first wave of the pandemic.Early on Thursday, responding to a question from reporters, Union food secretary Sudhanshu Pandey said 3-4 states and public representatives have made specific requests to the Centre to consider that kind of (PMGKAY) scheme implemented last year.Under PMGKAY, the Centre distributed 5 kg rice or wheat per person and one kg of pulses per family to all those covered under the National Food Security Act. This covered the April- November period of 2020 and had come as a big brief to the poor families across the country.Sources said currently no discussion has started on the suggestions from the three states, Pawar, and TMC law maker Saugata Roy, left party MPs Binoy Vishwam and Elamaram Kareem. They added there are different suggestions. While some have sought the rerun of the scheme for 2-3 months, some have suggested this should be implemented for six months to one year. Officials in the Food Corporation of India said similar requests have been coming from time to time.The FCI has huge surplus stock, almost two-and-half times more than what the government needs to meet the requirement for NFSA and other welfare schemes. Moreover, the government is heading towards a record procurement of 42.73 million tonnes of wheat this year, which Pandey said will be a record. So far 6.47 million tonnes of wheat has been purchased within a month since the procurement started.He also said the direct benefit transfer (DBT) of MSP to farmers accounts has been successful in Punjab. Even arahtiyas in Punjab, who get 2.5% commission for their service, are getting their dues directly in their accounts.

Read MoreCHICAGO: The family of 12-year-old Tamir Rice , who was shot and killed by Cleveland police in 2014, asked the Justice Department on Friday to reopen the case into his death after it was closed in the waning weeks of the Trump administration.In late 2020, federal prosecutors said they would not bring charges against the two police officers involved, saying video of the shooting was of too poor a quality for them to conclusively establish what had happened. There were no other prosecutions in the case. In December 2015, a grand jury declined to bring criminal charges against the officers.Rice's family said in a letter to the Justice Department that it believes Trump officials were uninterested in seeking justice for him because of political reasons and made the case needlessly complicated.""The truth is this case is tragically simple. Tamir Rice was a boy. On November 22, 2014, he was doing something many boys enjoy: playing with a toy gun in a park near his house,"" attorneys for the family wrote in the letter.Rice was Black, and the police officer who shot him was white. The shooting sparked community protests about the police treatment of Black people, especially after a grand jury decided not to indict the officer or his partner.The family's request puts pressure on Attorney General Merrick Garland and the Biden administration to begin publicly delivering on a commitment to combat racial discrimination in policing. Garland has said America doesn't ""yet have equal justice."" But reopening the case could be complicated.""The election of President Biden, your appointment, and your commitment to the rule of law, racial justice, and police reform give Tamir's family hope that the chance for accountability is not lost forever,"" the family said in the letter.Rice was playing with a pellet gun outside a recreation center in Cleveland on November 22, 2014, when he was shot and killed by Officer Timothy Loehmann seconds after Loehmann and his partner, Officer Frank Garmback, arrived. The officers had been dispatched to the recreation center after a man drinking beer and waiting for a bus called 911 to report that a ""guy"" was pointing a gun at people. The caller told a 911 dispatcher that it was probably a juvenile and the gun might be ""fake,"" though that information was never relayed to the officers.To bring federal civil rights charges in cases like these, the Justice Department must prove that an officer's actions willfully broke the law and are not simply the result of a mistake, negligence or bad judgment. It has been a consistently tough burden for federal prosecutors to meet across both Democratic and Republican administrations, with the Justice Department declining criminal charges against police officers in other high-profile cases in recent years, including in the deaths of Eric Garner in New York City and Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri.In Rice's case, the Justice Department said poor-quality surveillance video recorded in the area where the shooting took place prevented prosecutors from being able to conclusively determine whether Rice was or was not reaching for his toy gun just prior to being shot. The two officers who were investigated told authorities soon after the shooting that Rice was reaching for the gun prior to being shot and was given multiple commands to show his hands.But the video, while grainy, shows what prosecutors need to know, said Zoe Salzman, an attorney with Emery Celli Brinckerhoff Abady Ward & Maazel, which is working with Rice's family.""It is very clear on the most important points,"" she said. The timing, for one. It shows that Loehmann was primed to shoot within one or two seconds after encountering Rice, and he didn't pause to investigate. She said the officers' claims they gave Rice commands were proven untrue, and prosecutors included them as fact.But the letter from the Rice family's attorneys said the Justice Department's explanation was designed to make the case seem as ""complicated as possible,"" in an effort to run out the clock on certain federal charges. The letter asks that federal prosecutors convene a grand jury to consider charges against the police officers.Salzman said the family hopes Cleveland would also reconsider charges but feels its best chance is with the federal government.""All the Rice family is asking for here is a chance for justice,"" she said. ""Again and again politics trump justice. All they asked for is an honest investigation and a fair presentation of the evidence to a grand jury.""",Family asks feds to reopen case on Tamir Rice police killing,RICE

However, a few sprigs of hope have appeared on the horizon with more and more citizens getting vaccinated. For those who are infected and isolating at home, we have better facilities this year to make the process easier.A few caterers and organisations in Hyderabad have introduced food packages for the infected. These can ease the burden on those who are living alone or the ones who do not want to pass on the infection to other more vulnerable family members. This has also helped failing food businesses find new avenues to make money.In this piece, we talk to a few of the package providers and know what they are offering.Mini and big thalisAnil Agarwal of Sai Kailash Dhaba started supplying meals for the Covid-affected as charity last year, but when he saw the high number of infected persons, he decided to take it up commercially. ""Till now, we have delivered 3,000 vegetarian meals. We dispatch 400 thalis to areas all over the city every day. We bear the delivery charges if 5-6 orders come from one house, but otherwise we use bike services to deliver the meals,"" shares Anil. The dhaba offers 14-day Mini Home Thalis and Home Thalis at Rs 4,000 and Rs 6,000 respectively. The packages include lunch and dinner only.A family affairAnand Sanghi, who runs a catering business called Sanghi Caterers in Old City for the last 15 years, is still recovering from the blow that the pandemic dealt to his venture. Faced with the prospect of going bankrupt, he started delivering meals to people who are quarantining at home. When the number of cases dwindled after October last year, he was hopeful that his business would return to its glory days. But unfortunately, he sighs, the second wave has dashed all his hopes. ""We are working full capacity and supplying 20-25 meals per day. The number of cases rose astronomically in the last one month. We provide pure vegetarian meals three times a day. My wife cooks the food and my family members deliver it within 25 km radius. If someone lives beyond that, one can use other apps to get the food delivered at their doorstep,"" shares Anand. It has become difficult to find staff to deliver food due to the scorching sun outside now, he adds. Their package costs Rs 9,000 for 14 days.Fresh meals and immunity-boosting powderNikhil, who started a Covid package from his establishment called 7thecloudkitchen three days ago, provides breakfast, lunch and dinner to the affected quarantining at home. Speaking about the venture, he says: For now, I am focussed on providing quality food to the consumers and not looking for profits. That is why the customer has to pay only the production cost of the food and the delivery charges. One of the highlights of his offer is that it comes with a special immunity-boosting Ayurvedic powder from Kerala. We have been using the powder in our family, and by Gods grace, no one has contracted the virus so far. I also provide the ghee with which the powder has to be consumed. Besides these, we provide fruits, soups and rice kanji for diabetics. All our food items are made in ghee. The package costs Rs 650 per person per day. They deliver vegetarian and non-vegetarian meals all over the city.Food, lodging and medical careThe Jain Relief Foundation has gone a step ahead and arranges food and lodging for people affected by coronavirus. They also have a nurse on the premises round-the-clock and daily visits by doctors. People from all faiths can avail the facilities. Talking to Express, Prashant Kocheta and Pramod Jain from the foundation said: ""We take care of every worry of patients so that they have the required mental peace to bounce back to health. These are super deluxe rooms which are also available on a sharing basis for infected persons from the same family. We provide breakfast, lunch, hi-tea, dinner and haldi milk at night. We have ensured that the nurse and doctors who come in contact with the patients are vaccinated. In emergency cases, we have helped patients get shifted to hospitals.""

In scenes reminiscent of the first wave of the coronavirus pandemic in India, thousands of workers are leaving for their hometowns and villages, fearing that they will lose their housing and livelihood if they remain in big cities.During a nationwide address on Tuesday night, Prime Minister Narendra Modi urged state governments to convince labourers not to leave for their hometowns, while assuring them that they will not be stripped of their livelihood. If we all follow COVID-19 protocols, therell be no need to impose lockdowns, PM Modi said.But despite the Prime Ministers efforts to allay fears of an imminent lockdown, migrant workers continue to flee cities and towns across the country.DelhiAmidst a debilitating surge in coronavirus cases in the National Capital, thousands of migrants are rushing to bus depots and railway stations in search of a way out of the city.

The one silver lining on the horizon is the steady rise in farm output. Food grains production, according to the Union agriculture ministry, is estimated to rise 2% for crop year 2020-21 to a new high of over 303 million tonnes (MT) from the earlier 297.5 MT on the back of higher rice, wheat, pulses and coarse cereals production. The crop year is taken from July 1 to June 30.While rice production is projected to cross 120 MT, wheat production will be up to 109 MT from the earlier 107.9 MT. The rain gods too seem to be smiling. Both the Indian Meteorological Department and the private sector Skymet have predicted an above-normal monsoon. Skymet has predicted a 103% rainfall for the June-to-September period this year. This follows above normal rains at 109% and 110% in 2019 and 2020 respectively.Though some parts of India like Jharkhand and the Northeast may be rain deficient according to IMD, an overall good monsoon will continue to spur agricultural production; private consultant ICRA therefore predicts FY2022 will also see agricultural production rise moderately by 2%. There has been a spin-off effect too on some sectors of industry. Tractor sales have been doing well and rose 34% in March this year, compared to the same period last year. Pesticide and fertiliser, farm equipment and chemical companies too have shown robust results.What is worrisome is that imbalanced growtha slowdown in other sectorswill have a negative impact on the rural economy. Lack of purchasing power leading to lower consumption of rural products by other sections of the population will restrict offtake and push down farm prices. This will create a logistical and storage crisis, generating waste. Lower income for farmers has a cyclical effect of squeezing demand for FMCG and other consumer goods, dragging the slowdown longer. The government has to ensure economic growth and job creation are evenly spread in all sectors. Otherwise, our agricultural sector may find itself bogged down by a crisis of plenty.",Farm sector growth provides the silver lining,RICE

This would compel them to study at home for the examinations and not neglect their studies. They should also be directed to clear 70% of the fees, he said.Many of the school managements are under a steep financial crisis since last year due to COVID, he said, adding that the government should extend a helping hand to the schools that are unable to pay rents, taxes and instalments for the loans.

Mr. Chauvin has been convicted of second-degree and third-degree murder, and manslaughter  all three for an encounter that lasted around nine minutes, during which he pinned Mr. Floyds neck to the roadside with his knee until he stopped breathing. Mr. Floyds final words, I cant breathe, became the clarion call of a massive wave of street protests across the U.S. At the time, erstwhile President Donald Trump fanned outrage when he described the protests a result of the radical left and threatened to send in the National Guard. President Joe Biden, at the time a presidential race frontrunner, contrarily went to Houston to meet with Mr. Floyds relatives. He said at the time that he would not fan the flames of hate, but instead, seek to heal the racial wounds that have long plagued this country. A few months ahead of one of the most remarkable presidential elections in recent history, his words lent hope to many Americans that should he win, there might be a real possibility for reform in law enforcement and criminal justice that could result in less violence against racial minorities.Yet, it is clear that the road towards achieving a more perfect union is laden with pitfalls that render the task at hand formidable. Literally minutes before the verdict in the Chauvin trial, a teenage girl in Columbus, Ohio, was killed by the police. Her death comes in the wake of others felled in police encounters, including Eric Garner, Michael Brown and Tamir Rice in 2014, and Breonna Taylor in 2020, to name but a few. In most such cases, charges have been rare, and convictions rarer still. Analysis of these cases suggested that most often charges were dropped, or plea bargains and civil settlements agreed. It is only a minority of these instances of what many consider police brutality against people of colour that result in convictions at trial. Four years under Mr. Trump did little to build, across communities, bridges of the sort necessary to bring about a greater measure of empathy and nuance in policing. Now, Mr. Bidens ambitious police reform bill, which bans chokeholds, offers qualified immunity from lawsuits for law enforcement and creates national standards for policing towards greater accountability, has cleared the House and faces a steep climb at the Senate, where analysts say it is unlikely to pass without the support of at least some Republicans.

We take a minute to appreciate three such local favourites, beyond the mainstream bounty of mango and watermelonThe hottest days of summer are here, and it is time to pay attention to staying hydrated while replenishing nutrients.There are various healthy summer coolers which help us to stay refreshed and energised as the mercury rises. The traditional choices of the hot season: musk melon, watermelon, lemon and tender coconut water are also pocket friendly. Here are some more juices that have been part of southern Indias cuisine for many generations.It was nungu paal (ice apple-based) and nannari sherbat that we had during my childhood in Thanjavur, but now the options are wider and healthier, says Devi Bala Chandrasekar, whose foodblog, KitchenDB focusses primarily on traditional, healthy family recipes.Each region in our country has special cool drinks and I have tried Nellai pazharasam (mixed fruit punch) and the much easier neer moru (spiced buttermilk) during summer, she adds.Devi Bala shares recipes of herbal summer drinks like lemongrass lemonade, orange and oregano juice, tulsi sherbet and variyali sherbet (fennel seeds and raisin) on her blog.Nandita Shah, a homeopath suggests juicing vegetables. In North India, aam panna (made with raw mango and jaggery), sol kadhi (a coconut milk drink laced with herbs) and jal jeera (herbs and lemon juice) are popular. But we can also try blending nutrient-rich vegetables with a little lemon juice and mint in a sugar-free drink, she says.She says sugar can be substituted with dates paste or raisins. She also suggests drinking tender coconut chaas, made by combining half a cup of creamy tender coconut kernel, eight drops of lemon juice, two-and-a--half cups of water and one teaspoon chaas masala.When it comes to vegetable juices, everyone prefers carrots and beetroots, which are naturally sweet . But ry blending any kind of gourd along with raw mango (the kilimooku variety) and you will enjoy it, says Sreedevi Lakshmikutty of Coimbatore-based Biobasics.Electrical mixer/blenders have made fresh juices easy to make at home. But we must aim at making these without sugar or at least substituting it with palm sugar or jaggery, she says.Sreedevi suggests trying blending curry leaves with coconut milk seasoned with some salt and palm sugar and adding little water to make it a nutrient loaded drink for the season. I wonder why people have stopped drinking the ragi koozh (fermented porridge) or the simple lemon water with a pinch of salt, she adds.Pune-based Neha Mathur, who blogs at The Whiskaffairs says In Pune, chaas, shikanji and Jeera soda are a daily affair during summer months. I make beetroot chaas which looks great, tastes good and kids simply love it. Also cucumber blended with tender coconut flesh can also be added to the regular chaas as it can cool the body, says Neha.Down South, it has always been the neeraagaram or pazhaya sadam (cooked rice fermented in water overnight) that has been the saviour for many during the harsh weather, says Seethalalshmi N, of Organic Farmers Market, Chennai.She adds, Using heritage rice and making sure to soak few fenugreek seeds along with the rice can promote health and keep the body cool and has numerous health benefits. She adds that soaking sabja seeds and almond gum overnight in water, and adding lemon juice and water and a pinch of salt makes a wonderful drink.Ice Apple Milk DessertIngredients5 palm fruit/nungu, skinned/chopped200 ml milk, boiled/chilled4 tbsp organic brown sugar1 tbsp edible rosewaterA few rose petalsA few pistachiosMethod : Chop the skinned palm fruits into fine pieces and keep aside, add it to the chilled milk in a bowl.

The Telangana High Court had to put its foot down and take action against the errant officers who either ignored its orders or found ways to circumvent their implementation. Recently, the HC sentenced Nalgonda Collector Prashant Jeevan Patil to do social service at an orphanage for two hours a week for six weeks.This came after an appeal sought by the collector on a single judge order that he should pay a fine of Rs 2,000 or serve a jail term for six weeks. The single judge found him and his junior, a civil supplies corporation official, guilty of avoiding implementation of a verdict on restoration of rice supply to a miller who petitioned the court against both the officials for the imposition of severe punishment on him for minor discrepancies.In March, Sircilla Collector Krishna Bhaskar (who was collector of Siddipet earlier) and Siddipet Collector R Venkataram Reddy were sentenced to a three-month jail term for ignoring a restraining order issued by the High Court and dispossessing petitioners of their land for construction of Mallanna Sagar Project in the district. Along with the IAS officers, their juniors too took the rap. The petitioners were from Vemulaghat and the surrounding villages in Siddipet district.The officials are anxious to please their political bosses and under pressure to meet deadlines. But this cannot be an excuse for them to disregard directions from the courts. The High Court, while commuting punishment in contempt cases to social service, had said that being IAS officers, they should have known better and that non-implementation of the orders raised questions over their administrative capabilities.Courts are the last resort for justice for anyone who feels wronged by the government and if the officers cannot implement the orders of the judiciary, it calls for a serious review of the way they are working.

However, BJP leaders thrashed these suggestions and by November they started claiming that the battle against COVID-19 was over. Testing had been reduced and test results have been delayed. He said that the situation had become so distressing now that even last rites cannot be done honourably, and livelihood of small businessmen is being snatched away without warning due to the imposition of curfew. Despite the crisis, the government has reduced PDS rice distribution to BPL families by 2 kg, and increased the cost of fertilizers.DKS condemns forcible closureMeanwhile, criticising the government for imposing lockdown-like curfew due to closure of non-essential businesses, KPCC president D.K. Shivakumar on Friday told presspersons that the curfew is condemnable. The government has failed, but we are cooperating with the government by being humane. Despite our promise to cooperate, forcible closure is not acceptable. The government has to work. We will fight the government politically.

2021-04-23,https://indianexpress.com/article/lifestyle/health/nutritional-guidelines-post-covid-patients-pandemic-7283069/,"Written by Shwetha BhatiaIn my practice so far, Ive managed cases from mild to severe across various age groups. As we fight the second wave, here are guidelines for those recovering from Covid 19 infection. A good diet promotes faster recovery. We now know that Covid is an inflammatory condition that can have lasting effects for up to six-eight months after discharge affecting different organs, especially the liver and lungs.DietAspects that need to be kept in mind:*Managing other complications if any e.g.., hypertension, diabetes, kidney dysfunction, cardiac involvement.*Digestive disturbances, loss of taste/smell.*Difficulty in breathing*Difficulty in swallowing, especially in those who may have been intubated during hospitalisation.CaloriesAdequate calories must be provided depending on the patients nutritional status. Malnutrition is not only having low body weight but also the inability to maintain healthy fat:muscle ratio.Patients with obesity often have respiratory dysfunction, impaired immune function, increased inflammation and low lung volume and muscle strength. These individuals are more prone to pneumonia and cardiac stress. Obesity with diabetes is even more complicated. Caloric restriction is needed for ensuring healthy fat loss and lean mass maintenance in obese patients.Have fibre-rich diet (Photo: Pixabay) Have fibre-rich diet (Photo: Pixabay)ProteinIt is indicated as a top priority. It is recommended to be at 1.2-1.3 g/kg per day; increasing the supplementation of branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) to 50 per cent, to prevent muscle loss and enhance the strength of respiratory muscles. Whey protein is the ideal choice if budget permits, at least for the first two-three weeks. If not, fresh curd, paneer or thoroughly cooked eggs can be given depending upon meal preference and digestive function. Protein must be individually adjusted with regard to nutritional status, physical activity level and digestive tolerance.CarbohydrateThe total must not exceed 100-150g per day. The usage of carbohydrates leads to the production of equal carbon dioxide (called respiratory quotient) which must be avoided to decrease respiratory distress. If the patient is diabetic, he/she has to be monitored closely for episodes of glucose highs and lows and the medication needs to be adjusted. Persistent high glucose is an effect of infection and can also delay recovery. Opt for pulses, dairy, and vegetables over grains. Avoid fruit juices.ALSO READ | Covid-19: Simple precautionary measures and immunity-bosting tips for pregnant womenFatTo maintain calories, the proportion of fat can be increased. Give priority to the use of medium-chain fatty acids. Also, increase the proportion of omega-3 fatty acids. They play a major role in immune responses. They reduce inflammation. Coconut oil, butter, ghee, nuts, MCT oil can be used. Olive oil, rice bran oil, groundnut oil can also be used for cooking.Vitamins/mineralsRoutine supplements of multivitamins and minerals are needed with emphasis on adequate vitamin B/C/D, zinc, and selenium. Iron deficiency or anemia should be treated.Immuno-nutrientsThese are specific nutrients shown to have a considerable influence on immune function. There are several types of immunonutrients, such as arginine and glutamine which support both the immune and the digestive system. Curcumin (found in turmeric and as capsules) also aids recovery.ProbioticsHave curd. (Source: Getty Images/Thinkstock) Have curd. (Source: Getty Images/Thinkstock)The alteration of healthy gut bacteria is due to the increase in gut permeability. This occurs as a result of infection as well as treatment with antibiotics. This drives the inflammation further. Probiotic supplements help to restore immunity. They need to be prescribed by a doctor in this case.Fluids and saltsEven mild fever is associated with loss of fluids which can lead to dehydration. Thin buttermilk, soups, coconut water (unless there is a potassium restriction), salted lemon water and ORS can be used. For cardiac and kidney patients, the volume of fluid and sodium, along with other electrolytes may have to be restricted. Your physician will advise you on the total fluid intake for the day.Meal frequency and consistencyIf the patients dry cough and sore throat are severe, solid food intake may decrease. Therefore, warm, soft foods and supplements can be used. Small frequent feeds would be better if the appetite is less, timing of fluid consumption should be in between meals and not with the meal.ICU patients can have swallowing issues called  prolonged post-extubation swallowing disorder  after discharge. This can last even up to four months after and must be managed with alternatives.Make sure you have enough vitamins and minerals from food. (Source: getty images) Make sure you have enough vitamins and minerals from food. (Source: getty images)ExerciseProlonged homestay may lead to reduced regular physical activity and hence a drop in muscle mass. ICU patients suffer the most muscle loss. Once the patient is stable and the physician gives a clearance, exercise must be slowly encouraged as per tolerance.Safe, simple, exercises may include, strengthening exercises, activities for balance and control, stretching, or a combination of these to maintain fitness, done preferably under guidance.Finally, patients may need support with their mental health as well. Seek counselling from appropriately trained mental health professionals.Even if you are vaccinated, heres why you should still wear masks:*No vaccine is 100 per cent effective.*No vaccine is effective right away. It takes about two weeks for the immune system to make the antibodies that block viral infections, especially in the case where two doses are needed.*In other words, a vaccinated person might still be able to spread the virus, even if they dont feel sick.*A vaccinated person might still be able to contract the infection with milder symptoms.*Masks protect against any strain of the coronavirus, in spite of genetic mutations.The best hope for ending the pandemic isnt to choose between masks, social distancing and vaccines, but to combine the three approaches to work as a team.(The author is a nutritionist and dietician)For more lifestyle news, follow us: Twitter: lifestyle_ie | Facebook: IE Lifestyle | Instagram: ie_lifestyle",Post Covid-19 care: Nutritional guidelines for those recovering from coronavirus,RICE

2021-04-24,https://www.thehindu.com/elections/west-bengal-assembly/of-mini-mutinies-and-shifting-sands-the-many-strands-of-a-polarised-bengal-campaign/article34396606.ece,"As the BJP makes inroads into West Bengal, the incumbent Trinamool Congress government is pushing back, even as an experiment in Muslim politics is under way. Shiv Sahay Singh and Sudipta Datta report on the many strands of a polarised Bengal campaign.On the sinking island of Ghoramara, at the southernmost tip of West Bengal, which falls under the Sagar Assembly constituency, the impact of cyclone Amphan that hit the State last May is still visible. Homes near the coast lie flattened, the banks have eroded further, and uprooted trees are yet to be cleared. Ashima Giri got 20,000 as Amphan cyclone relief. We are for [West Bengal Chief Minister] Mamata Banerjee, she says without any hesitation. But there are several others like Sareja Bibi who point out that they either did not get anything following the devastation or had to pay the local Trinamool Congress network cut money to get the amount. In the coastal areas of South 24 Parganas, North 24 Parganas and Purba Medinipur, corruption in the Trinamool local leadership over Amphan relief is a common refrain.In Bengal, where two phases of a long eight-phase election are yet to be held, the Trinamools entire campaign is built around Banerjee. Didi, didi aar ke, Bangla nijer meye keyi chaay (Didi, who else? Bengal wants its own daughter) is the partys resounding slogan. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which has quickly emerged to become the primary opposition to the ruling party, is trying to push the idea of ashol paribartan (real change) in its campaign. And the Samyukta Morcha, comprising the Left, Congress, and newly floated Indian Secular Front (ISF), has tried to shake things up by challenging both the main contenders. The contest has been marked by numerous defections, taunts, communal statements, violence, and aggressive campaigning even as the number of COVID-19 cases rises alarmingly in Bengal.Fear of violenceAcross the river, in Purba Medinipur district, all eyes are on the electoral contest at Nandigram where Banerjee is taking on Trinamool-turned-BJP rival Suvendu Adhikari. An injury to the Chief Minister on March 10 has restricted her movement, forcing her on a wheelchair for the rest of the campaign.For several women in Nandigram who were witness to the violent land agitation of 2007-08, the high-voltage contest has rekindled fears of violence after results are declared on May 2. Suvendu looked after us on behalf of Didi. And now we have been asked to pick one, says the elderly Narmada Sith, who was tortured during the anti-land acquisition movement.Siths fears are not unfounded. Despite the huge deployment of Central forces in West Bengal, the Election Commission of India has not been able to insulate the State from poll-related violence. Till April 22, several incidents of voters being threatened, clashes between political parties, and the killing of political workers have been reported. In the fourth phase of polling, at Sitalkuchi seat in north Bengals Cooch Behar district, Central forces opened fire killing four people. They maintain that they fired in self-defence. A primary assessment of the violence suggests that more than 20 people have lost their lives since the Model Code of Conduct was put in place and more than 30 candidates have been attacked during the poll process.Also Read West Bengal Assembly Elections | Bengal BJP president warns of more Sitalkuchi-like shootings, draws condemnationMemories of violence and area domination clashes are heard not only in Nandigram, but in many other parts of the State too. In Singur, an elderly farmer, Vivekananda Das, says he was beaten up by the police during the land agitation in 2006 and was only able to re-cultivate his land after 14 years, in 2020.In the Jangalmahal region, which was gripped by mindless violence from 2008 to 2011, 30-year-old Chiranjib Maity from Jhargram stays away from the rallies conducted by Chhatradhar Mahato of the the Trinamool. Mahato led the Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities, the frontal organisation of the Communist Party of India (Maoist), before joining the Trinamool last year after spending more than 10 years in jail. Maitys father was killed by the CPI (Maoist) before his own eyes in 2010.Also read | From land movement to industry, Singurs resistance has come full circleIn Darjeeling, which witnessed a 100-day lockdown and economic blockade in 2017, during which at least 11 persons lost their lives, the elections present an opportunity for the people to express their political preferences. While there are broad-based State-level issues dominating the Assembly polls, West Bengal remains a story of many revolutions and mutinies, big and small, and they will determine the outcome of the polls, say observers.Delivery of welfare schemesFor the Trinamool, the biggest poll plank is the delivery of welfare schemes. Banerjee claims that her government has launched 70 welfare schemes. Some of them like Kanyashree (which provides a one-time grant of 25,000 for a girl child who studies till Class 12) and Rupashree (which provides a one-time handout of 25,000 for a girls marriage for economically stressed families) are targeted towards girls.In densely populated North and South 24 Parganas (64 seats, of which the ruling Trinamool won 56 in 2016), the party is banking on such schemes to see it through. But though the Trinamool chief is popular, there is resentment against the party. Didi is good. But very few people can say the same of local Trinamool workers, says Bulti Das of Champahati in South 24 Parganas, who was given some seed money for poultry farming. Former bureaucrat Dilip Ghosh explains that though the Trinamool has done a lot of good work, such as giving rice at 2 a kg, it has not allowed people to voice their concerns. Recalling the words of Santosh Rana, one of the leaders of the Naxal movement, Ghosh believes that it is the Trinamools lack of democracy that has pulled the BJP to the State.Also Read Will West Bengal tilt towards the right this election?Ghosh, who was Secretary of Panchayat and Rural Development and later Health and Family Welfare, says during the 34-year Left Front rule, there was a sort of class alliance in rural Bengal and it was an open secret that benefits were linked to party loyalty. With the Trinamool in power, the MLAs and the bureaucracy appear to be more powerful than panchayat functionaries. Like in the later part of the Left regime, the Trinamool has also given an impression that you need to be with the party to get benefits, he says.A Professor who has followed the rise of the Trinamool points out that control of local administrative bodies is vital to the partys electoral success. The Trinamools narrative of welfare transfers may not work as a section of its leaders at the grassroots level were involved in corruption, taking cut money for disbursement of schemes. In case of some schemes like honorarium to imams and muezzins, the BJP accused the Trinamool of appeasement politics, he says.According to Ardhendu Sen, former Chief Secretary of West Bengal, some of the development schemes of the Trinamool government have been well implemented, but the party has destroyed the panchayats. He says, Whatever the people get today is what Mamata wants to give. The food situation has improved, but not health as she publicises. As for Kanyashree, I looked at whether the school dropout rate is going down, but there is no comprehensive evidence of that. Her reign has been a mixed bag. After the 2019 Lok Sabha election, the Trinamool government embarked on some course correction, launching outreach programmes like Duare Sarkar (government at the doorstop), Paray Paray Samadhan (resolving issues in the neighbourhood) and Swasthya Sathi (a health insurance scheme where the medical card is handed over to the oldest woman member of the family).Also read | Hunger situation in West Bengal critical, finds surveyBlow to democracyFor bureaucrats, the biggest difference between the Left and Trinamool governments is that the latter seems to have stopped taking into account inputs from the ground. Under the Left regime, there was some semblance of consultation with the people. Now, if you ask for something, leaders get annoyed, says Sen.The 2018 panchayat elections dealt a blow to grassroots democracy and the three-tier panchayat network, say voters and leaders. Not only were Opposition candidates not allowed to file nomination papers but even dissidents within the ruling party were not allowed to contest, say Left and Congress leaders. The Trinamool won 34% of the seats during that election, about 20,000 without a single vote being cast. State Congress president Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury claims that on the day of polling, 70-80 people were killed. Veteran Left leaders who led their supporters to file nomination papers were assaulted. The ruling party ensured that not a single civic body was administered by the Opposition and all barring the Siliguri Municipal Corporation were run by the Trinamool.Also Read West Bengal | Two-year-old panchayat poll results in the darkIt is this stifling of the Opposition that gave BJP oxygen in the State, say both Left and Congress leaders. Also, the Trinamools over-reliance on minority politics has afforded the Hindu right a political space. The BJP vote share in the 2014 Lok Sabha polls was 17%. It dropped to 10% in the 2016 Assembly polls and rose to 40% in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.In Bengal, people vote for a party not because of ideological affiliation but because of the perception of protection against violence. If the party they have traditionally voted for cannot protect them in the face of violence perpetrated by hoodlums close to the party in power, their allegiance is bound to shift to the one which can. While the BJPs capacity to resist Trinamool violence has increased significantly over the last three years, it is ultimately this balance of coercion that will decide who wins rural Bengal, says a teacher.The BJPs might and muscleTaking full advantage of this rancour, the BJP has used its might and muscle to set foot in Bengal. It has worked assiduously on the disgruntlement on the ground and used defections as a political tool to poach leaders of the ruling party. The politics of defections started in West Bengal in 2011, when MLAs of the Congress defected to the Trinamool even though both the parties had joined hands and contested polls to defeat the Left Front government.Prime Minister Narendra Modi arrives at a public rally in Kawakhali on the outskirts of Siliguri on April 10, 2021. | Photo Credit: AFPIn 2016, the Trinamool stormed to power for a second term with 211 seats, but the party continued to break into the rank and file of the Opposition. Of the 44 Congress MLAs who won the 2016 Assembly polls, more than 20 defected to the Trinamool, says senior Congress leader Abdul Mannan. Taking a leaf out of the Trinamool handbook, the BJP began to engineer defections before the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. Senior Trinamool leaders like Mukul Roy, Arjun Singh, Nisith Pramanik and Locket Chatterjee switched to the BJP and the party won 18 out of 42 Lok Sabha seats in the State. Once the BJP got its formula right, it began to woo more members of the Trinamool. In December 2020, one of the key Ministers of the Trinamool, Adhikari, joined the BJP. He was soon followed by Rajib Banerjee. By the time the State went to the polls, more than 30 MLAs of the Trinamool had defected to the BJP, and many were given tickets.What is most crucial to the rise of the BJP in Bengal is that the party gained strength without participating in any prolonged peoples movement like Singur or Nandigram, say observers. It has used defections, religious polarisation using the trope of infiltration and the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, and also highlighted communal violence in some parts of the State to stake claim to power.Also Read Gunning for victory in BengalIn many areas of rural Bengal, villagers talk about a desire for change. Onek toh dekhlam, baam ke, didi ke, ebar dekhi notun party ke diye (We have seen the Left and Trinamool, let us try a new party), says a young man waiting for Home Minister Amit Shahs road show at Nandigram. A farmer in the agriculture-rich Bardhaman district is candid: If there is a new broom, do we use the old one? Similar sentiments are echoed in Jhargram (the BJP did very well in this erstwhile Maoist belt in the Lok Sabha elections, winning all four seats), Howrah, Hooghly and North and South 24 Parganas. To build on this, the Prime Minister and the BJP top brass including party chief J.P. Nadda, Home Minister Shah, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath besides State BJP president Dilip Ghosh held rallies and road shows. Modi held over 20 public rallies across the State.Identity politicsThe campaign has been bitter, fractious and communal. The Election Commission has taken some note of the polarisation, but not enough, says a senior Congress leader. Speaking in Bidhannagar, which went to the polls on April 17, on the citys north-eastern fringes, Shah said only the BJP can stop infiltration in Bengal. Communists, Congress and the Trinamool have vote banks in ghuspetias (infiltrators). Campaigning in Asansol, the Prime Minister raked up the 2018 riots: Who supported the rioters? Who undertook the policy of appeasement? For whom did the police support the rioters? There is only one answer. Everyone is saying because of Didi. The Trinamool was quick to retort that the person the BJP had blamed then for being a bystander, Jitendra Tiwari, is now with the saffron party. In Nandigram and other parts of Purbo and Paschim Medinipur, Adhikari has constantly harped on the 70:30 divide of Hindus and Muslims in Bengal. The Muslims make up 27% of the population, according to the 2011 Census.Biswanath Chakraborty, psephologist and professor at Rabindra Bharati University, says this is a watershed election because Bengal is witnessing the rise of identity politics  not just of Hindus and Muslims, but also Dalit sections like Matuas and Rajbanshis. The BJP has focussed on getting the disaffected and neglected elements together from all walks of life to rally against the Trinamool. The Matuas are Hindu migrants from Bangladesh and the BJP has promised to implement the Citizenship (Amendment) Act if voted to power. On the ground, a section of Matuas do not want special favours and point out that they already have Aadhaar and voter cards, markers of Indian citizenship. The Matuas had backed Trinamool earlier but are now divided between the BJP and the ruling party  they have a say in at least 30 seats.Also read | Matuas grappling with identity politicsAn experiment called the ISFWith the Left vote share falling from 26.6% in 2016 to 7.5% in 2019, the Left Front felt it had to do something to stop all anti-incumbency votes from going to the BJP. In an attempt to remain relevant in the contest, the Left and Congress alliance joined hands with the ISF , formed by Furfura Sharif cleric Abbas Siddique. This will help stop votes from going to the BJP, at least a part of them, claims Mohammed Salim, Polit Bureau member of the CPI(M). The ISF is fighting in 28 seats, says Abbas Siddiques brother Naushad Siddique, chairman of the ISF and a candidate in Muslim-dominated Bhangar, located about 40 km from Kolkata. In 2019, the Trinamool had led in 60 of the 74 Assembly segments in which Muslims constitute over 50% of the electorate. The Muslim vote is likely to be divided in places where the ISF is strong, says Chakraborty. And that will not help the Trinamool.A section of Left supporters who first went to the Trinamool is likely to have voted for the BJP in 2019 and may go with either the BJP or the Left-Congress-ISF alliance, says Ambikesh Mahapatra, who teaches at Jadavpur University and had contested the 2016 Assembly polls with support from the Left and Congress. Things may have changed for the Congress, however, in the Muslim-majority seats of Malda and Murshidabad after the Sitalkuchi firing. The Muslim vote may consolidate behind the Trinamool, says a local leader.Also read | Crucible of ISF, Bhangar reflects experiment in Muslim politicsThe BJP has targeted the Trinamool government over alleged corruption, particularly using the term cut money. It has taken on Banerjees nephew Abhishek Banerjee, the ruling partys MP from Diamond Harbour. Those who have defected from the Trinamool to the BJP often attack the bhaipo or nephew saying he is a tolabaj (extortionist). While there have been cases of local-level functionaries at panchayats being involved in taking cut money and the Trinamool chairperson has asked people to return the money, Abhishek Banerjee has turned out to be an easy target for the Opposition.High turnout amidst a pandemicCharges of mismanagement in dealing with the pandemic are a cause of concern for the ruling party. But now there is anger against the BJP too, in some sections, as Modi continued to hold large rallies where most were seen packed in close proximity without masks, even as cases have soared. The Prime Minister has cancelled his rallies for the last two phases. Banerjee has also promised to connect with the electorate virtually. On April 21, the States daily COVID-19 infections crossed 10,000 for the first time since the outbreak of the pandemic.On April 22, the day of polling for the sixth phase, the Calcutta High Court came down heavily on the Election Commission saying it is only issuing circulars but not ensuring that COVID-19 protocols are implemented. Despite the surge, there has been no drop in voter percentage. In each of the six phases, more than 80% polling was registered.The 2021 Assembly polls are no ordinary elections, say political observers. This is the first time that the State is witnessing the rise of the BJP as well as a high-pitched campaign that started months before the poll dates were announced, says Chakraborty.

BJP leaders thrashed these suggestions and by November they started claiming that the battle against COVID -19 was over. Testing was reduced and test results delayed, he said.He said the situation has become so distressing now that even the last rites of victims cannot be done honourably and livelihoods of small businessmen were being snatched away without warning because of the imposition of curfew. Despite the crisis, Mr. Siddaramaiah said the government has reduced PDS rice distribution to BPL families by 2 kg and increased the cost of fertilisers.Meanwhile, criticising the government for imposing a lockdown-like curfew with the closure of non-essential businesses, Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee president D.K. Shivakumar on Friday told presspersons that the curfew was condemnable. The government has failed, but we are cooperating with it by being humane.

Now, the 13 districts of Old Mysore region are getting 3 kg of ragi and 2 kg of rice instead of the 5 kg of rice given per unit earlier.Mr. Katti had announced in the Legislative Assembly that the State government would distribute locally favoured foodgrains other than rice and wheat from April 1. The distribution of ragi has started, but jowar is yet to be included in the scheme.The department has procured around five lakh tonnes of ragi, but has been able to buy only around 50,000 tonnes of jowar. With this procurement, we can distribute ragi to 13 districts for 10 months. But the jowar collected can last only one month. That is why we are yet to start distributing jowar, Mr. Katti told The Hindu.Our motto is to give people the grains that they normally eat. We have changed the eating habits of almost the whole State because of the distribution of rice and wheat, which are not the staple of either north or south Karnataka. The 13 districts of the north eat jowar and the southern districts eat ragi. Residents of the remaining four districts eat parboiled rice or red rice. We want to introduce local grains for all the regions, slowly, he said.Ive written to the Centre to increase the cost of procurement of jowar and fix separate prices for the Mal Dandi native variety, hybrid variety, and Kaniki or split grain. I have met the Union Food Minister and V.P. Sharma, chairman of the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices, and explained the problem. He has agreed to consider our demand, the Minister said. We have asked the Centre to divert some of the jowar collected from Maharashtra.Officials said the primary issue was pricing. Foodgrains are procured with the funds pooled by the Centre and the State. The Centre contributes around 90% of the cost and the States pay around 10%. We have little say in the procurement. When the Centre allows us to buy local foodgrains using Central funds, we are supposed to distribute it within the State. There is a big difference between the prices that we offer through the Food Corporation of India and the market prices. While jowar growers sell for between 4,000 and 5,000 per quintal, we offer only 2,600 to 3,200. Jowar growers will sell only if we pay attractive prices. Otherwise, it will remain an empty promise, said a senior official.The official said the Centre gives around 28 lakh tonnes of rice every year. That is more than we can consume. We only need around 18 lakh tonnes. If the Centre can reduce this quantity and instead allow us to buy jowar, red rice, and parboiled rice for the rest of the amount, we would be very happy. This request has been communicated to the Food Ministry.OppositionThe decision has not gone down well with all, especially in districts such as Shivamogga where rice rather than ragi is the staple. The governments decision to replace rice with ragi has been opposed by many ration-card holders in the district. Nagaraj, of Salukodu in Sagar taluk, said rice was a common food in his family. Already, the government has reduced the quantity of rice from 7 kg to 5 kg. A further decrease in quantity will affect us. We dont want ragi. The government should continue with rice and increase the quantity, he said. His family of four used to get 20 kg of rice a month.","Local grain in PDS: Ragi in, jowar to wait in Karnataka",RICE

(Express Photo by Harmeet Sodhi)For the past four days, farmer Narinder Singh has been waiting at Jalandhars Shahkot mandi to get his crop unloaded. But his arhtiya has categorically told him that his crop cannot be weighed and sold as there is no bardana (packing bags of jute or plastic material) available.Another farmer, Nirbhair Singh, has also been waiting here for the past two days as he had brought two trolleys of wheat crop but it is yet to be unloaded. The reason given by the arhtiya in this case too is the same  shortage of bardana.In Bholath and Nadala mandis of Kapurthala district too several farmers could sell their crop only after waiting for bardana for 5 to 7 days.I had brought the crop to mandi 7 days back, but had to wait here till my arhtiya provided bardana. Government should have tackled such issues before the procurement started, he said.Farmers Baldev Singh, Gurtej Singh and Rattan Singh have all spent over a week at Bathinda, Sangat and Jumba mandis, respectively, with their crops. All of them have been held up due to shortage of bardana.Reports coming in from all three regions of Punjab  Majha, Malwa and Doaba, tell the same story.The state which has required 5.24 lakh bales (which comes to 26.20 crores) of gunny bags, had only got 2.65 lakh bales which is almost50.5 per cent of the total requirement at the time of beginning of the procurement. One bale contains 500 storage bags.Later that week, the state also got 50,000 more bales of jute while 90,000 plastic bags were in transit. Now the state is receiving a supply of 6,000 bales per day for the past few days. Despite having all the supply of bags from the Centre, the state is still having a shortage of over 20 per cent bags.Bardana is in short supply because the production of jute bags is little low due to Covid and the plastic bags are mainly manufactured in Maharashtra and Gujarat and due to Covid several industries are being closed there or running at very low capacity.Now, the state has decided to use the already used bags to fill the grain and for that 28,000 arhtiyas of the state are the main source.The government has fixed a price of Rs 41.90 for such used bags and arhtiyas, which have got large numbers of such bags with them, have started providing these bags now.This year due to early ripening of the crop, the state mandis witnessed 7.5 million tonnes wheat arrive in just 12 days while there was a record arrival on a single day on Wednesday when over 15 lakh tonnes of wheat arrived in mandis.Punjab is expected to procure 13 million tonnes of wheat this year and 57 per cent of it has already arrived in mandis. The state was not prepared for such a heavy arrival in just 12 days.A District Mandi Officer in Doaba said that there was shortage of bardana in all those mandis where the arrival of the wheat was quite heavy, but now with the permission of taking the used bags from arhtiyas the matter will be resolved in a day or two. However, there are still several arhtiyas who have not been able to procure bags from market till date.Earlier also, we took used bags for filling the grain and arhtiyas used to provide without any hesitation but this time because of the direct payment to the farmers accounts, they are not providing them. Now when the government had fixed the rate of these bags and started making the payments of these bags they (arhtiyas) have started providing these in every mandi, said a senior officer in the Punjab Food and Civil Supplies Department.President of Arhtiya Association of Khanna Mandi, which is the largest mandi of the region, Harbans Singh Rosha, said that there is a requirement of 21 lakh bags in Khanna Mandi while they have got 17 lakh bags till now while there is a need of 4 lakh more bags. We are purchasing used bags from the rice shellers now and they will be used to fill the wheat, he said.Ravinder Singh Cheema, president of Arhtiya Association Punjab, said that there is a shortage for filling around 30 lakh tonnes (3 million tonnes) of wheat and this wheat would require 6 crore bags (1.20 lakh bales). He added that arhtiyas cannot arrange more than 50 lakh bags because the availability of used bags is not there in the market in such a huge number.Director, Department of Punjab Food and Civil Supplies, Ravi Bhagat, told The India Express that there was some issue of bardana in some mandis in the beginning but now everything has settled down as apart from the Centres supply of bags, the remaining requirement will be met locally by procuring bags from the arhtiyas. Also we are getting a supply of 6,000 bales daily from the Centre and it will continue till the harvesting period is over, he said, adding also the department has already transferred money in the accounts of arhtiyas for the bags which they are providing.","Punjab: Record wheat arrival in mandis, but shortage of storage bags adds to farmers’ woes",RICE

We started preparing food for them and then, as the numbers exploded, we began getting calls from people who are suffering from the virus and cannot cook, says Harjeet Singh Wadhwa of Ghar Ghar Langar Seva.The group of 35 volunteers is working hard to ensure food for the people who contact them. Last year, we were able to distribute food door-to-door, but this time, we are worried because every other house has somebody infected. The volunteers are, nonetheless, delivering food. Some of the most urgent calls are from senior citizens who are confined to their homes. We also receive calls from their children, who stay outside the country, requesting us to arrange for an ambulance or meals for their elderly parents who live here. Then, there are migrants at the railway station who are hungry, says Wadhwa, adding that they sent out 450 food packets on Friday.Members of the civil societies are also coming together to provide support.

As a result, Vietnamese food is very light and flavourful, unlike other cuisines of the region. To experience the joy of Vietnamese cuisine, I am going to share a few dishes that I cook on a daily basis at home. Stir Fried Vegetables in clear broth with Jasmine Rice is one of my favourites, it is a very simple and hearty dish.To begin with, I stir fry some garlic with carrots, knol khol, broccoli, spring onions and coriander in a fish sauce with lemon and sugar. Once the vegetables are sauted and the fragrance is evident, I add some salt and vegetable stock or chicken stock as per preference. I then add tofu or chicken, simmer for about 15 minutes and serve with hot steaming Jasmine Rice for a delectable dish thats a family favourite. Another of my go-to choices for something quick and easy is fried rice.As Ive said before, the fried rice in Vietnamese households is very light compared to other South East Asian varieties. Fried rice is typically made in a wok on a stove-top. Even if you dont have access to those, youre still in business. You can still make delicious fried rice in a rice cooker! Simply throw everything together - oil, rice, seasonings (fish sauce and salt), and your favourite vegetables and proteins. I use sausages in the mix to add that extra layer of texture.For the vegetables, I stick to peas, carrots, and corn to keep the recipe simple and foolproof. I usually avoid food with high water content like fresh leafy greens as these tend to make the fried rice soggy. Other than that, youre all good, and can use almost any veggies and protein that you like. Fried rice is normally served with some raw cut cucumber on the side, and this simple dish is a family favourite in our house, especially with young children.",Easy Vietnamese Home Cooking,RICE

Thats how the foods that we eat can affect our weight, hormones and the health of various organs, including our heart. Eating a healthy and balanced meal will help us reduce the risk of heart disease and stroke.Coronary arteries are the major blood vessels that supply blood, oxygen and nutrients to our heart, and a person faces Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) when these arteries become damaged or diseased.When plaque or cholesterol or fat containing deposit settles in our arteries, this condition is referred to as atherosclerosis i.e. commonly known as hardening of the arteries. This plaque is the main reason that puts you at a risk of getting coronary artery disease.When there is a build up of plaque, they narrow the coronary arteries blocking or slowing the flow of blood and oxygen needed for proper heart function and this decreased blood flow may cause chest pain also known as angina in medical terms. Other symptoms observed include shortness of breath, dizziness, nausea and an irregular heartbeat.The disease is multifactorial and the most important risk factors are tobacco or smoking, diabetes, a familial tendency to develop this condition, high blood pressure and an abnormally high cholesterol level in the blood.Atherosclerosis can also be seen due to various other reasons like sedentary lifestyle, obesity, and psychological stress. A complete blockage of these arteries can cause a heart attack, and thats why it is wise to make lifestyle changes to have an effect on improving coronary artery health.General recommendations to help you tackle CADWe all know certain foods which are not heart or health friendly and we shouldnt eat them.However, its often tough to change our lifestyle and eating habits but still working on making healthier food choices and keeping our heart healthy isnt as hard as it sounds! Lets look at the guidelines below:Choose healthy fats: When it comes to heart health, fats are always termed as bad, but its only the transfat and over consumption of oils or fat which is bad for our health.Some fats are actually good for our body like Medium Chain Triglycerides (MCTs) from coconut oil or A2 ghee which when taken in moderation works on controlling the inflammation from our body. Omega-3 fats found in walnut, flaxseed and fish are also healthy choices as they are really good for the heart and brain, plus help in controlling inflammation.The bad fats from junk or processed or fried food should be avoided. Cold pressed or unrefined oils like sesame, mustard, groundnut, rice bran oil can be used for cooking but in moderation.Staying active: Movement or activity is very important to have proper blood circulation which reduces the pressure from the heart and doesnt allow plaque formation to happen.Try to engage in daily physical activity, at least a 30 to 45-minute brisk walk, 10,000 steps, cardio, yoga, swimming and aerobic exercises.Hydrate: Water is the most essential macro nutrient that we always forget to focus on. Almost 80 per cent of our body is made up of water and if we dont drink an adequate amount, it will put a strain on our organs and make us feel sluggish.Drinking water is also important for detoxification, proper circulation and ensuring that plaque doesnt get deposited in the arteries. Try and drink around 2.5 to three litres of water daily to help your body eliminate toxins.Bulk with fibre: Fibre is essential to bind with the bad fat in our body and its elimination. Soluble fiber which is easily found in many grains and fruits helps us reduce the total blood cholesterol levels by lowering the LDL or bad cholesterol in the body. A fibre-rich diet has also shown to have heart-health benefits, such as reducing hypertension, inflammation and plaque deposits.Watch how you cook: Instead of frying, go for healthy cooking options like steaming, baking, broiling, sauteing, stir frying, grilling, poaching and roasting.",Follow your heart,RICE

Most of the temples in the state have varieties of pitha offerings depending on the availability of raw ingredients and seasonal harvest. When we talk about them, one in all likelihood is reminded of the subtly flavoured Manda, Enduri, Kakera, Arisha, Chandrakanti or Poda pithas.However, there are many more that are rarely made in urban households today, blame it on lack of time or interest. Bhubaneswar-based home chefs Avinash Patnaik and Saroja Chaudhury are trying to change this notion by using social media to revive and popularise heirloom pithas which are not just integral to festivals but also weddings and every day rituals.With very little literature available on Odia pithas except for scriptures, Avinash, a former agriculture officer with the Government of Odisha, is currently documenting these recipes and their significance. A foodie, Avinash has so far documented traditional recipes of 15 Odia pithas and the history behind them. There are many varieties of pithas or sweet pancakes that form the basis of an Odia platter.They can be steamed, deep-fried or pan-roasted, which define its texture and name, says Avinash who posts the recipes on his social media handles that go by the name, Bhukad Insaan. Saptapuri or Satapuri pitha, for instance, is rarely made except for one day in a year. Because making it is time-consuming and needs a lot of patience. It is a kind of sweet patties that has seven layers of Puri with sweet stuffing of coconut and jaggery in each layer and then fried in ghee.It is made on the day of Saptapuri Amabasya (a day when ancestors are paid homage) in the Hindu month of Bhadrab and offered to Lord Jagannath, says Avinash who began learning about them from his maternal grandmother and fellow food bloggers. Like Saptapuri, Chunchi Patra pitha is limited to certain parts of Odisha, related to festivals like Manabasa Gurubar.The Khira Poda pitha and Ghora Manda are the USPs of Saroja who vlogs (YouTube) at Rosys Kitchen and runs a kitchen in Bhubaneswar by the same name. While the former is a popular delicacy from Berhampur in Ganjam district, the latter is made in Sundargarh district. The Khira Poda pitha or Khira Saku, she says, is a 1000- year-old milk cake recipe that is made from rice and milk. Till a decade back, it was only made in some households during special occasions.

Groups have been formed of people donating blood, or looking for donors. People are organising food for those who are in no position to cook. And some small entrepreneurs are supplying home-cooked food  at nominal costs  to those looking for nutritious meals that are tasty and prepared and delivered with all precautionary measures in place.I got a call from one such kitchen a few days ago. Called Bhojan, it has a subscription meal plan offering light meals and snacks, and a small combo meal package.The food from Bhojan (bhojan.co.in) was healthy, as it had been cooked with few masalas, but was delicious nevertheless. I learnt it was started in 2020, and has four kitchens, three in Delhi-NCR and one in Bengaluru. The minimum subscription plan is of seven days (plans for a fortnight and a month are also available (WhatsApp 9311419770). People can check the food out before opting for a subscription.The prices are affordable, something one can appreciate in these times when everyones pocket is hurting. The Chhota Bhojan breakfast or snack costs 45; combo meal of roti with sabzi or rice with gravy is priced at 49; a classic meal that includes rice, roti, vegetable, gravy and pickle is at 69; and a standard thhali has all this, but in somewhat larger quantities, and a salad, at 89.For breakfast, they serve masala puri with bhaji, idli sambar, pao bhaji, poha, plain paratha with zeera aloo, and vegetable coleslaw sandwich. On Sunday, there are various types of parathas with curd. Lunch consists of mixed vegetables, kadhai style aloo mattar, petha masala, baingan masala, lauki channa. There is something called gravy, which includes Amritsari chholey, rajma, and kadhi pakora.I enjoyed the food. The vegetable  muttar paneer  had been cooked with a light hand, but was good to eat. Likewise the chholey was deliciously light  in taste and colour. The aloo parathas were soft, filled with a light potato mash, and served with curd. The samosas were the way I like them  with a crisp crust that was not oily, and a scrumptious potato and pea filling.Another interesting place is Paanch Phoran, which has decided to keep its gourmet fare (from Exotisch Cuisines) on the backburner and focus on the kind of food that the body demands in times of crises. Sonali Chatterjee (WhatsApp 9910474449), who runs this service, does various kinds of soups and other dishes. On Thursday, for instance, she had prepared a clear chicken soup and clear vegetable soup.She offers a vegetarian meal of dal, sabzi, roti and rice (150); all this with chicken or fish (200) and a meal of chicken/ mushroom/ paneer/ tofu grilled, a soup or stew or broth, with bread/rice and sauted vegetables (250). She has a delivery charge of 100.There is also the House of Kitchens, which serves food across Delhi: East Delhi, GK2, Kalkaji, Panchsheel Park, West Delhi, Dwarka, Faridabad, Gurugram, Noida and Greater Noida. I rang the East Delhi number (9873939959). A representative answered the phone, and said that they had simple meals of rice, roti, sabzi, dal for 110, which they delivered to east Delhi neighbourhoods.For many people, this is not quite business  but almost a mission.

2021-04-26,https://indianexpress.com/article/world/split-second-decisions-how-a-supreme-court-case-shaped-modern-policing-7289680/,"A demonstrator holds a photo of Ma'Hkia Bryant, who was shot by a police officer as she attacked another teenager while wielding a knife, in Los Angeles, April 20, 2021. Officers using deadly force rely on a legal doctrine set forth decades ago. (Allison Zaucha/The New York Times)Written by David D. KirkpatrickIn case after case, it took only a split second for an officer to pull the trigger.Adam Toledo, a 13-year-old in Chicago, had tossed away a handgun and begun raising his hands. MaKhia Bryant, a 16-year-old in Columbus, Ohio, lunged with a knife at another teenager. Tyrell Wilson, a 33-year-old mentally ill homeless man in Danville, California, had a knife in hand when he shouted Kill me at an approaching deputy sheriff.All three were among more than 100 people shot and killed by police over the previous six weeks.The officers justification for the use of lethal force in each instance differs with the circumstances. But as in almost every other recent case involving questions of police use of force, law enforcement officials defending the officers are relying on a doctrine set forth by the Supreme Court three decades ago and now deeply ingrained in police culture: that judges and juries should not second-guess officers split-second decisions, no matter how unnecessary a killing may appear in hindsight.Now, the national movement launched by the death of George Floyd, emboldened by an officers conviction last week for his murder, is pushing to change that standard.While most agree that officers must sometimes use deadly force to protect themselves or others, many criminologists say the wide latitude under the rule is an obstacle to reducing the number of police killings, and lawmakers in Congress and many states have begun seeking tighter restrictions.The number of people killed by the police in the United States  consistently about 1,000 a year  is far higher than in other developed countries. A disproportionate number of the shootings are by white police officers against people of color, as in the cases of Adam Toledo, MaKhia Bryant and Tyrell Wilson. And many experts say the split-second standard is partly to blame for that death toll.I am convinced that is the No. 1 cause, said Lawrence W. Sherman, an American criminologist with experience in the police departments of New York and Minneapolis who is now an emeritus professor at the University of Cambridge.The Supreme Court building in Washington, Oct. 26, 2020. Officers using deadly force rely on a legal doctrine set forth decades ago. (Anna Moneymaker/The New York Times) The Supreme Court building in Washington, Oct. 26, 2020. Officers using deadly force rely on a legal doctrine set forth decades ago. (Anna Moneymaker/The New York Times)It puts the United States into an extreme exceptionalism in allowing killings that would be prosecuted as murder elsewhere, like the U.K., he added.Lawyers for police unions argue that the rate of police killings in the United States reflects a higher level of civilian violence because of greater gun ownership and a flimsier social safety net than in other wealthy countries. They say the split-second decision standard is essential to keeping officers and the public safe.If the officer doesnt act, theres a strong probability that an individual will be killed, said Larry James, general counsel for the Fraternal Order of Police, pointing to the recent shooting of the 16-year-old in Columbus.The officer is duty-bound to take that action to protect the life of another citizen or him or herself  that is the standard that police should be judged by, not Monday morning quarterbacking, he added.Until the mid-1980s, policies on the use of force varied widely across the states. Some allowed deadly action against any fleeing suspect of a felony, even if the suspect posed no imminent threat.That changed in 1985. The Supreme Court ruled in Tennessee v. Garner that police could shoot only if they had probable cause to believe that a fleeing suspect posed a significant threat of injury or death to an officer or others. The number of police killings steadily declined over the next four years, studies show.But in 1989, a more conservative court took a different approach in the ruling of Graham v. Connor, establishing the precedent that dominates today.The case was brought by Dethorne Graham, a Black man the police had stopped in Charlotte, North Carolina, on suspicion of shoplifting because he had hurried in and out of a convenience store.Graham, a diabetic desperate for orange juice to avoid a seizure from low blood sugar, told the police that he had rushed out of the store because of a long checkout line. But as he staggered and briefly passed out, officers assumed he was drunk and forced him into tight handcuffs, leaving him with a broken foot, cuts on his wrists, bruises on his forehead and an injury to his shoulder.The Supreme Court sent the case back to a lower court, finding that the police needed only to meet the standard of what a reasonable officer might do. The criteria for reasonable, the high court said, should include special accommodations for the pressures of police work.The calculus of reasonableness must embody allowance for the fact that police officers are often forced to make split-second judgments  in circumstances that are tense, uncertain and rapidly evolving  about the amount of force that is necessary in a particular situation, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist wrote in the majority opinion.Not every push or shove was improper even if it may later seem unnecessary in the peace of a judges chambers, the chief justice wrote, quoting an earlier ruling. The lower court ultimately ruled in favor of the police.The Supreme Court opinion did not explicitly address lethal force and defined only the rights of a suspect, not the restrictions a state could impose on law enforcement.But state legislatures and judges, often sympathetic to the police, largely adopted the question of what would be reasonable to an officer making a split-second judgment as the test for assessing any police use of force, whether deadly or not.Graham v. Connor became the lodestar and created this impression that almost nothing is out of bounds, said Barry Friedman, a law professor at New York University and the director of its Policing Project, which has drafted a model statute to regulate the police use of force.The same standard also became embedded in the training and practices of American police  part of law enforcement DNA, often unnoticed as it works in the background to determine our actions, a magazine for police officers declared in a 2014 article about the ruling.A generation of officers has been trained in the cases practical meaning and has spent decades applying it to every use-of-force decision, the article said.It was published in response to a wave of protests over allegations of excessive force in the fatal shooting of Michael Brown, a Black man in Ferguson, Missouri. In part because he claimed he had made a split-second decision about his self-defense, the officer who killed Brown never faced charges.Chauvin was convicted in part because he could not claim that Floyds suffocation was a split-second decision. But critics of the split-second standard cite a litany of police shootings of innocent Black people. In 2015, Cleveland police officers screeched their cruiser to a halt just a few feet from Tamir Rice, a Black 12-year-old playing in a park with a toy replica gun, and within 2 seconds had shot him because they deemed him a threat. He died the next day.The next year, a police officer in a suburb of Minnesota pulled over Philando Castile, a 32-year-old Black man driving with his girlfriend and daughter. The officer shot him five times at close range, killing him in the seat of his parked car, out of a mistaken fear that he might have been reaching for a gun.In 2018, the police raced to a street corner in the Crown Heights section of Brooklyn to investigate reports of a possible gunman, and moments later shot and killed Saheed Vassell, a 34-year-old mentally ill Black man who was well known around the neighborhood. He had been pointing a piece of pipe they mistook for a weapon.The officer who shot Castile was acquitted of manslaughter. The officers in the other cases were not charged. The cities where Tamir Rice and Castile were killed paid millions of dollars to settle civil claims.The split-second standard has become a way to insulate officers from any critical review, said Seth Stoughton, a professor at the University of South Carolina School of Law. A former police officer in Tallahassee, Florida, he testified as an expert witness in the trial of Derek Chauvin, the officer who killed Floyd.Now, after the uproar over the Floyd killing, many state and federal lawmakers are trying to impose new restrictions on the use of force. A Maryland law passed this month over the objections of the governor requires that any such actions must be necessary and proportional to prevent an imminent threat of physical injury or to achieve a legitimate law enforcement objective. It specifies a prison sentence of up to 10 years for any officer who causes injury or death by violating those rules.California, Illinois and other state legislatures have debated similar measures, and the House of Representatives last year passed its own bill raising standards for the use of force and requiring attempts at de-escalation.",Split-second decisions: How a Supreme Court case shaped modern policing,RICE

Karnatakas initiative as well as the Centres efforts to get international recognition for these nutrient-rich crops have yielded results with the United Nations (U.N.) declaring 2023 as the International Year of Millets.The U.N. General Assembly recently adopted a resolution, sponsored by India and supported by more than 70 countries, declaring 2023 as the International Year of Millets. The resolution is intended to increase public awareness on the health benefits of millets and their suitability for cultivation under tough conditions marked by climate change.The adoption of the resolution elated Karnatakas farm sector as the State, spearheaded by the then Agriculture Minister Krishna Byre Gowda, had put in efforts to give a push to the idea after its experiments in organising international organic and millets trade fairs yielded encouraging results. The Centre, which was convinced about such a proposal, had played a decisive role in building consensus among the other countries.However, the initial euphoria about the resolution getting adopted is now slowly paving way for anxiety among experts in Karnatakas farm sector, which is one of the prominent cultivators of millets. This is because of the alleged lack of preparation and plan of action, both on the part of the State and the Centre, to capitalise on the U.N.s declaration.The main intention behind the initiative is to help Indian millet farmers get decent revenues by capitalising on their crop getting international recognition. But they cannot get such a benefit unless we play a proactive role. The real success of observing international millet year comes only when we take measures to help our farmers reap the benefits, said Mr. Gowda. To do this, we must form a technical group of subject and policy experts to coordinate as well as lobby with the U.N., along with our diplomats concerned.In fact, India must now take a lead in popularising the theme in a strong manner at the international level through various campaigns, he said.According to him, it is a rare occasion to help millet growers, who are mostly poor and marginal farmers from parched areas, and this has the potential to change the fortunes of millet growers. So far, only spices and basmati rice are dominating the Indian exports. But now there is a golden opportunity to add millets to the export basket. But this can happen only if we really evolve a meticulous plan and work accordingly, he said.What is disappointing is that Karnataka appears to be doing nothing about this issue. There was no mention of it even in the State Budget and other forums, including the recently concluded legislature session. The State should play a key role in at least taking up the issue with the Centre, Mr. Gowda said.He also sought to counter the argument that 2023 was still far away. At the international level and on forums like the U.N., the calendar of events is drawn and finalised at least an year in advance. We are bound to lose the opportunity if we keep quiet now.Three dimensionsT.N. Prakash Kammaradi, agricultural economist and former chairman of Karnataka Agricultural Prices Commission, observed that millets have three different dimensions of climate, nutrition, and cultural quotient. This is because they are climate-resilient and suit dryland farming. Similarly, they have high nutritional value. They are also related to culture since they are an integral part of food habits, he said.Apart from holding an international campaign, there was a dire need to focus on production aspects, he said, pointing out that the area under cultivation of millets had decreased both in the State and the country. If we need to capitalise on the opportunity of the U.N. declaring 2023 as the International Year of Millets, we need to plan well to expand the area under cultivation of millets by creating awareness among growers, he said.",United Nations declares 2023 International Year of Millets,RICE

They said that despite the threat of rain, harvested paddy was being kept in polders itself.Apart from Kavalam, farmers in Ramankary, Kainakary, Thalavady, Veeyapuram, Cheruthana, Pallipad, Haripad among other places in Kuttanad and Upper Kuttanad regions are facing procurement delays. On Monday, farmers staged an agitation in front of Thalavady Krishi Bhavan demanding speedy procurement of the harvested crop.Farmers in the region alleged that mills were demanding more wastage citing high moisture content in the harvested paddy.Rice mills are trying to take advantage of the situation. They are demanding more wastage knowing farmers are desperate to sell produce due to rain threat among other factors. Some of the agents are demanding wastage up to 15 kg per quintal of paddy. The sad part is the officials concerned remain a mute spectator to all this, said a paddy farmer from Kainakary.Paddy farming has been undertaken in around 28,913.655 hectares in Alappuzha district in the puncha crop season (first crop), a major portion of which is in Kuttanad. The Supplyco has so far procured 1.10 lakh tonne of paddy from around 24,000 hectares in Alappuzha in the puncha season. Rest 5,000 hectares are expected to go under combine harvesters in the coming days.Alini Antony, Principal Agricultural Officer, said that 5,200 tonnes of harvested paddy had been awaiting procurement. The procurement of the harvested paddy would be completed in a week.Earlier this month, several farmers who cultivated paddy had suffered huge losses after summer rain destroyed harvest-ready crops in large tracts in different parts of the district. Besides, the rain-drenched several tonnes of harvested paddy stored in paddy polders for shifting to rice mills.Meanwhile, the district administration has postponed the opening of the shutters of the Thanneermukkom bund due to a delay in the completion of harvest and procurement in Kuttanad.

As the Burapahar mountain range becomes visible, we would sit up from our sluggish postures in the backseat.At the sight of the signboard reading animal corridor, I was always hopeful of spotting a wild animal other than the grazing rhinos or elephants that crossed the road. Another favourite activity was to squint attentively at the treetops at the wild orchids.This year, when I drove the 350- odd kilometres on that familiar route, my focus was on the road rather than thinking of playing spot the orchid with my cousin and niece. Instead I made a surprise stop at the Kaziranga National Orchid Park, a couple of kilometres from the Kaziranga National Park. This was my first visit there.Established in 2015, it is designed as a mini-themed village, and encompasses a natural history museum, rice museum, a cultural centre, a handful of handicraft shops and a restaurant. The main attraction however is the Orchid display museum.Staggering numbersI wasnt expecting much from the Orchid museum, but once inside, I was pleasantly surprised. I noticed the visitors being stunned the moment they enter the enclosed area. The museum, roughly the size of a hall that can accommodate about 1,000 people, is designed to suit the growth of the orchid, the State flower of Assam and Meghalaya. The air inside the greenhouse is muggy, as orchids need humidity but the scent of the nearly 700 species of orchids growing in coconut husk, tree barks, bamboo hollows and pots makes up for it.A guide explains, There are 35,000 species of orchids in the world, of which approximately 1,314 are found in India. Interestingly, about 850 of them can be found in the Northeast. Arund 402 species are found only in Assam.The wild orchids here are collected from all across Northeast India. It is a riot of colour  yellow, orange, purple, pink, white and red. The main characteristic of an orchid is that it has six petals  five identical and one modular, explains our guide and adds that along with the orchids there are other plants growing, to support the atmosphere and to maintain the moisture balance. All these wild plants are collected from all over the Northeast. There are also a few cultured hybrid orchids growing in the park.Treat with respectAs we proceeded, still in awe at the variety, some of the flowers with their fascinating colours look unreal and we are encouraged to touch gently. The team inside explains the orchid species to everyone, especially children. Owing to its wild nature, it is difficult to grow orchids at home. Only a few common varieties like the ground orchid/pineapple orchid, the garland orchid can be grown with proper care.Orchids named Joker face and Dancing Lady appear to be the highlight until the guide points out the tiniest species, blooming silently in one corner. This orchid needs a magnifying glass and the flower measures 1.2 millimetres. The scientific name for it being Taeniophyllum glandulosum. The worlds tiniest orchid, it is a leafless epiphyte (a plant that requires another object or plant for physical support), he informs.While at the park, dont miss the butterfly orchid, pineapple orchid, rabbit orchid, starfish orchid, the joker face and dancing lady orchid.The best time to visit Kaziranga Orchid National Park is between March and November.

At the worlds largest idli and dosa batter preparation and packaging plant they are busy to do the math, given the soaring demand. For the record it is approximately 20 lakh idlis. Built by Bengaluru-based iD Fresh Food, the fully automated Giant Home Kitchen was inaugurated on World Idli Day, March 31, in Anekal, Karnataka. With more people staying at home, as a result of the global pandemic, idli and dosa batter is in high demand, leading to a surge in new start ups, as existing companies bolster their capabilities.Market research shows that the pandemic has spurred consumer demand for fresh and healthy foods like the idli and dosa, and for the batter, says Musthafa P C, co-founder and CEO, iD Fresh Food. He adds, There has been a perceptible cultural shift in the home cooking trend in India and an increasing number of people are consciously exploring ways of preparing easy-to-cook food at home.Last year, the company sold 35 crores idlis. This spike was seen not just in India but also overseas. California-based Mani Krishnan, CEO, Shastha Foods who hails from Tirunelveli in Tamil Nadu, says he had to quickly equip his kitchens so they could meet the rising demand last year. Krishnan, who founded the company at San Jose in 2003 today supplies to 300 stores across California.With the shut down, WFH and schools being closed, there was a massive surge in home cooking. The demand for dosa batter skyrocketed 100% across the country, he says. Krishnan adds that he also realised there was a need to provide variety at comfortable price points and hence introduced variants of millet and organic batters like brown rice, oats, quinoa, mixed pulses and green gram.Trial and errorThe variants got better visibility and people were willing to try and taste them. It now forms a significant growth opportunity, he adds. There has also been an explosion of dosa-inspired talent across cloud kitchens. Krishnan cites the example of Once Upon A Dosa, which was born, in August 2020, during the pandemic in Bay Area, California. It offers gluten-free waffle made with dosa batter and adapts it to Mexican, American and Japanese accompaniments, like a Szechuan paneer topping.Suvai Bhavan in Chennai with five cloud kitchens too introduced the millet dosa during the pandemic and offers an interesting range of premixes like rava, ragi and rava kesari. They also have pesarattu batter and masala, medhu and keerai vada mix.Another spin-off of the pandemic has been the sprouting of a batter-making cottage industry. With people stuck at home and time on hand, many are retailing home-made batter at attractive rates and even organising home-delivery options.With the demand from apartments close to her home increasing last year, Kavitha Mohan in Coimbatore grew confident enough to mechanise and upscale the business she ran from her kitchen. I use to provide batter locally to friends but, as demand soared, I found myself making 50 kgs of batter daily, she says. Last year during the pandemic, she began retailing on a small scale and finally went commercial with her brand Thrupth in February 2021. Kavitha has added appam and adai to her product list. She plans to add chutney packets.There is a demand for specials like appam and adai batters; the going is good, says Kavitha who is retailing a minimum of 70 to 100, one kilogram packets a day.Men and women behind the batterAnpumathi JJ who began JJ Foods in 2005 with a three-litre home grinder, and upscaled to three five-litre grinders the next year, said she was busy right through the lockdown.We did not close even for a single day. I had to provide people with their daily staple. Anpumathi now has a mechanised dosa batter facility at her home with an all-woman staff of five. In April 2020, her production was around 300 litres a day, but is now increased to 600 litres. Her team  Shobha, Jyothi, Chitra, Supriya and Geetha  made it to the unit during the lockdown too, says Anpumathi, as she extols their efficiency in making 100 packs in half hour. Anpumathis recipe is a mix of rice and urad dal in a 1: 4 ratio with salt and water.Amal Muraleedharan, who set up his business two years ago along with his mother Akhila in Kochi, has seen production increase from 300 packets to 700 a day during the health crisis. As we had surplus stock of rice and dal for three months, we could meet the increased demand, when others were unable to carry on, says Amal whose biggest buyers are small corner shops.For Kochi-based Swamy Food Products, sales dropped by 50% when its supply chain broke down in the initial days of the crisis in April, last year. But things have picked up; we are almost back to 80% of the business, says Shankar M Iyer, the founder who has been in the business for the past 15 years. He feels that the cottage industry that has mushroomed during the pandemic will need to match as consistency, quality, pricing, FSSAI license and GST registration to be in businessEncashing on a 300-year-old idli recipe, Kochi-based food start up Farmtodine built up a steady market by supplying supermarkets and luxury hotels. The restrictions of the pandemic affected them during the lockdown and a few months after, but they soon regained lost ground and began to supply 1,000 litres a day as before.Soni P Mani, managing director and CEO, is looking forward to introducing an exclusive idli mix that fulfills the four essential criteria  colour, texture, mastication, and stickiness  of an idli, he says. Visalam Nagarjan the woman behind the batter says the recipe belongs to her Changanaserry-based family. For five generations we lived in Alappuzha but there was a Tamil Nadu and an Andhra connect in the older generations, which is how we got this particular recipe, she says.Visalam speaks of a rice which she can identify, and of a supplier who informs them of its harvest details. The difference is in the ari or rice, says Visalam explaining that the taste and texture of the batter depends on the moisture content, soaking time and the grinding of the rice. I have been making batter for home consumption for 35 years now and its only recently that we went commercial. , she says.It is idli-dosa all day long in her household.

The menu, subject to change every week, with one new dish every day, has immunity powerhouse offerings such as Pumpkin and Barley Risotto today, Tamarind Eggplant/Fish Curry with Kodo Rice tomorrow, Egg Curry with Kerala Rice on Friday, Sweet Potato and Spinach Burger on Saturday certainly cuts through the stereotype of bland, sick persons diet one is conditioned to assume. Moreover, this food service being free (pay as you wish, and open to donations) and catering only to a limited crowd has caused envy and admiration in other parts of Delhi-NCR.Radhika KhandelwalBut Khandelwal and business partner, Ravish Bhavnani, can only do so much. Last week, the duo went against the tide by discontinuing their delivery service, so that their 32-member staff can stay safe at home. For this service, they pooled in their own resources with some aid from family, friends and well-wishers, and are using their restaurants kitchen (to ensure highest levels of hygiene as the couple have three dogs at home) that was deep-sanitised before work on the food service began.Between the two, they handle purchase of ingredients, cooking, cleaning, packaging and even delivery in their Volkswagen Vento between 12:30-1:30pm every day. Hence, after announcing their service via their Instagram handles, they could yes to only 58 families close to the restaurant (they dont have an e-pass, but have formally stated their purpose in print stamped by the company letterhead, Radish Hospitality Pvt. Ltd).The main reason behind rolling out such an eclectic menu, for Khandelwal, stemmed from this innate need to help. I think people with Covid deserve a treat, and cooking is the only thing I know. Also, I advocate a lot of seasonal produce, and I am aware that for a Covid patient, it is important to have alternate grains, lesser fat, in their diet. So, the risotto is made from barley, red snapper and eggplant accompany the kodo millet, egg curry is with Kerala red rice, chicken/vegetarian noodles has Soba noodles.The meals appear elaborate but consist of very few elements, so these can be put together swiftly. Plus, with us professionals running the service, the health and safety standards are in place. So uniforms are put to wash the moment we are done, all packaging has double marking, double bagging...In the near future, Khandelwal wants to amplify the initiative and get more restaurants onboard. For now, I want to see how this model works, because these are dark times, and I dont know whether I have the bandwidth to lead a bigger initiative at this point.In a nutshellThe menu, subject to change every week, with one new dish every day, has immunity powerhouse offerings such as Pumpkin and Barley Risotto today, Tamarind Eggplant/Fish Curry with Kodo Rice tomorrow, Egg Curry with Kerala Rice on Friday, Sweet Potato and Spinach Burger on Saturday certainly cuts through the stereotype of bland, sick persons diet one is conditioned to assume.GK-II residents can message Khandelwal on WhatsApp (+ 91 8800665972)",A treat for the Covid positive,RICE

Only a negligible number of transactions is being recorded. Consequently, an insignificant quantity of foodgrains (rice or wheat) is being distributed through the public distribution system.One of the key features of the scheme is ensuring that migrant workers can claim their quota of rations from anywhere in the country without disturbing the entitlements due to their family members residing in their native places. The Central government, in May last year, made the ONORCs implementation a condition to be fulfilled by the States for making use of the additional borrowing of 0.25% of GSDP.The Tamil Nadu government has allowed families migrating to the State to receive their entitlements at prices determined by the Centre at the fair price shops concerned.Several reasons are cited for the poor response to the scheme. A senior official of the State Civil Supplies Department says inter-State migrant workers prefer obtaining fresh ration cards from the State Department to getting their original cards transferred to Tamil Nadu. This is because of better benefits being provided by the Tamil Nadu government when compared to their home States.In Tamil Nadu, edible oil and tur dal are being supplied to ration cardholders, along with rice or wheat and sugar. But under the ONORC scheme, only rice or wheat and sugar are covered. While 5 kg rice or wheat per month per person, at 2 per kg for wheat or 3 per kg for rice, would be given only to those holding priority household (PHH) cards, Antyodaya Anna Yojana (AAY) cardholders, representing the poorest of the poor, would also get sugar at the price stipulated by the Central government, apart from rice or wheat.The official explains that the authorities also cannot refuse to issue ration cards to the migrant workers who, using their Aadhaar numbers, first get cooking gas cylinder connections in the State. One of the requisites to obtain a ration card is that the applicant must have a cooking gas cylinder connection, the official says, adding that the card is issued before an inspection of the place of stay of the applicant by the departments staff.The unwillingness of migrants to make use of the scheme and procedural hassles are also cited as reasons for the perceptibly low number of transactions.Notwithstanding the situation, the Department is making efforts to sensitise the migrants on the benefits of the scheme, the official adds.",Poor response to portability of ration cards,RICE

The gruel is an integral part of the fast-breaking meal (iftar) among South Indian Muslims. For decades, mosques and other religious institutions have involved the local community in preparing and distributing the gruel to anyone who asks for it.While last years lockdown saw a complete closure of Ramzan activities in mosques, this year, many institutions in Tamil Nadu have opted to resume serving nonbu kanji while following hygiene and social distancing protocols.Using roughly the same spices as biryani, nonbu kanji is a meal in itself. Raw rice (basmati or jeeraga samba) is cooked to a mushy consistency in a flavourful broth of mutton or vegetables, and then tempered with thinly-sliced fried onions. Recipes vary according to region, and availability of ingredients. As the nonbu kanji is perhaps the only proper food that many poor fasting Muslims can afford to have during Ramzan, we try and reach out to as many needy people as possible, says Mohamed Yusuf, secretary of the Masjid Javeed mosque, which functions under the auspices of the Anna Nagar Islamic Centre in Chennai. We are happy that we have been allowed to serve kanji this year, in keeping with the spirit of Ramzan. We have been following the health guidelines to ensure a safe experience for both the public and the staff, he adds.Nonbu kanji being distributed to the public at the Masjid Javeed in Anna Nagar, Chennai. Photo: Special Arrangement/THE HINDUThe mosque employs four cooks, who have cleared the COVID-19 test and who wear gloves and masks before they begin the mammoth task of preparing kanji from at least 40 kilos of rice per day. Earlier around 80-100 kilos of rice were needed as we would serve kanji at the sit-down iftar to around 1000 people on our premises, besides the public takeaway. Due to the lockdown, we have decided to cancel the iftar on our premises, and prepare kanji only for distribution this year, says Yusuf.Social distancing norms are being followed, with separate entry and exit points to keep the entire process as hygienic as possible, he adds. Close to a thousand people from areas in and around Anna Nagar avail the nonbu kanji serving.In Madurais Masjid-ut-Taqwa mosque, mass caterer Syed Ibrahim and his mother have been up since 5am, cooking kanji with jeeraga samba rice using his fathers recipe; he starts with the broth rather than sauting the basic ingredients in oil to keep the dish lighter on the stomach.Syed Ibrahim puts the finishing touches on nonbu kanji at the Masjid-ut-Taqwa in Madurai. Photo: Special Arrangement/THE HINDUThe kanji is built up in layers, with rice, lentils, fenugreek, coconut shavings, coriander and mint leaves added to the glutinous mix. On some days, minced mutton is added for a non-vegetarian twist. When eaten with fried snacks like samosas and vadais, a bowl of nonbu kanji can be a hearty dinner.After the kanji is ready here, I go off to Sempatti (55 kilometres from Madurai) to make the same dish at a mosque there, says Ibrahim, adding, Its not just about the food, but also a kind of social service, because countless people are going to eat what we cook.A community effortContributing towards nonbu kanji preparation has been a tradition for many Muslim families over generations in Tamil Nadu. Funding the kanji operations adds to the camaraderie in the congregation, where everyone does their bit, says V M Abdul Rafi, a Madurai-based functionary of the Tamil Muslim Munnetra Kazhagam (TMMK). In cities like Madurai, the kanji alone in some mosques will cost upwards of 25,000 per day, which congregation members will sponsor. Others who want to be part of the effort, can chip in for side dishes like fried snacks, fruits, cool drinks and bottled water, he adds. Earlier, nonbu kanji used to be prepared in huge cauldrons at home, and families used to share it with everyone in the neighbourhood, irrespective of their religious affiliation, says Rafi. At Tiruchis Periya Pallivasal (Big Mosque) on Tennur High Road, nonbu kanji is served post noon. This year, we are making kanji from 65 kilos of rice which will feed around 1,200 people, says mosque trustee Maulvi M Zahir Hussain Ilhami.The five-hour cooking process ends with the kanji left on dum (heat compress) on the firewood stoves, until it is ready to serve. Nonbu kanji aficionados say the firewood imparts a smoky flavour to the dish that is quite impossible to achieve at home. Zahir adds that though most mass caterers ensure that the entire cauldron of nonbu kanji is distributed before 8pm, they prefer to serve it fresh every day, to keep it as nutritious as possible.",Sharing ‘Nonbu Kanji’ during Ramzan: Gruel for the fasting soul,RICE

He said the number of ventilator beds needs to be increased significantly, and if ventilators are not available with the State and Central governments, they must be imported.

But a positive RT-PCR test can deprive you of reliving the nostalgia in seconds.Ever since the pandemic broke out, all weve been hearing and reading about is immunity-boosting foods to help our bodies fight the virus. But no ones telling us what to do when we contract the infection which compromises our sense of taste and smell. Though temporary (three-four weeks), imagine eating three meals a day without being able to experience our food in totality. The result is loss of appetite and mental agony, which adds to the existing frustration the pandemic has caused us.Fret not! Heres a humble attempt to make things better for Covid patients in recovery. We speak to chefs and nutritionists in Hyderabad to find out what flavours, textures and aromas can cut through the bland palate of those battling the Chinese virus.Add colour to your plateFood stimulates parts of our brain, its changes our mood and brings back memories. For example, comfort food relaxes the mind and body as it is easy on the digestive system. But for Covid patients, who cannot smell or taste, colour can up their spirits. Their meals can include green, red and yellow fruits/vegetables,says chef Sudhir Nair, executive chef at The Westin Hyderabad Mindspace. Well, its a given in nature -- anything green, red and yellow is nutritious. According to nutritionist and dietitian Apeksha Ekbote, simply replacing boiled rice with jeera rice or adding kesar and elaichi to dishes can help make food look appealing. Covid patients tend to lose their sense of smell and taste because of decreased immunity and high levels of antigens in the body. Adding a fruit or vegetable salad to the meal makes the plate look good, she suggests.Crunchier the betterTexture of food makes a whole lot of difference, especially when the two key senses are compromised. It reminds the mind of how a dish tastes and smells. Fresh vegetables and fruits, such as lettuce and apples, are not only rich in nutrients but are also fun to eat. Have a salad with a lemon-honey dressing, its tangy and crunchy, says Sudhir. Apeksha says dry fruits and nuts are a healthy snack and a much-needed addition to the diet as they are rich in proteins. So, start fussing about texture, even if its at the risk of you sounding like a MasterChef judge. Youll at least be able to feel some part of your food.Steamed yet yummyDigestion takes up a lot of energy, which Covid patients cannot afford to waste. Their bodies are already working overtime to beat the virus. Whats better than clean, simple food. Sudhir recommends a bowl of hot soup with a dash of salt and pepper, which is immensely satisfying. Avoid thick soups though, in which cornflour is added. Go for thin/clear soups such as chicken clear soup or a veg clear soup. Purees are also very easy on the digestive system.

While help had poured in for the underprivileged from many quarters during the 2020 lockdown, the two-week shutdown this year is expected to be tough as most philanthropic enterprises are now focused on providing medical help.The government, meanwhile, has not made any commitment to the unorganised sector and daily wagers. The vulnerable section had received 10 kg of rice per person, which was two months quota, at one go soon after the lockdown was announced in 2020. The State had announced an one-time payment of 5,000. This time around, there has been little expected from the State. The Karnataka State Unorganised Workers Social Security Board does not have the financial strength to bail this section out. In the midst of the crisis, changes brought in to the public distribution system (PDS) on the quantum of rice to be issued (down to 2 kg) has added to the problem.Health crisis has become the focus over food. It is also a nightmare under the current pandemic situation to set up a community kitchen or bring people together to pack and deliver dry ration kits since there is no guarantee of a bed available for volunteers if one turns positive, said Nalini Shekar of Hasiru Dala. Her organisation that had supported about 50,000 people through campaigns earlier has restricted it to 6,000 families without BPL cards during this second wave.Logistical nightmareThe transgender community has frantically reached out for help, but we are in no position to help them. It is a logistical nightmare, she rued.Ms. Shekar, however, emphasised, It is not that volunteers are not working. But all their efforts are now on identifying bed for the needy, sourcing medicines, and other health issues. Bengaluru is witnessing a huge volunteer participation in the health sector besides organising the final rites of those succumbing to COVID-19.Vinay Srinivasa from Bengaluru Street Vendors Federation concurred. Most volunteers are firefighting on the medical front. There is also fatigue among the volunteers as their health is also important in the pandemic, he said.With the anticipation of a lockdown, several families were also this time preparing to meet the harsh realities. If some had stocked up rations for a few weeks time taking loans, many migrants returned home in the preceding weeks. Unlike the last lockdown, Mr. Srinivasa said, there was no panic this time as in anticipation of strictures, vulnerable sections such as street vendors were prepared to an extent.Restarting kitchensAmid heart-wrenching scenes from hospitals, there have been organisations such as Mercy Mission and Urban Homeless who continue to work among these vulnerable groups.Mercy Mission, which had a massive food aid programme during the pandemic last year, is all set to reopen five kitchens in Bengaluru. There is a food crisis looming. Many homeless and daily wage workers who have lost jobs seem to be running out of whatever little they had and once that happens, a food crisis will become a reality.

Unable to find sustenance, on Saturday he was found foraging for food in a waste dump yard at Kone Pete near Alur.Sathish C.K., a resident of Chikka Kanagal in Alur taluk, spotted him on Alur-Bikkodu Road near Kone Pete. I was on my way back from Alur when I saw him looking for something in the waste dump. I stopped my bike and went close to him. I was shocked to see him eating the food thrown out by hotels, he told The Hindu.Mr. Sathish stopped him from having the spoilt food and arranged for rice and sambar with the help of a local friend. During the conversation, he said he had come to Alur to work on loading ginger bags at a farm. After completing his work, he could not return to his place because of the lockdown. He had no food or shelter. Some of his words were incomprehensible, but he was clear that he had had no food for the past four days, Mr. Sathish said.Later, Mr. Sathish contacted the Health and Family Welfare Department to get him tested for COVID-19. Anand, a building contractor of Alur, has come forward to offer Mr. Raju temporary shelter and food. We will make arrangements to send him to his native place once the lockdown is relaxed, Mr. Sathish said.Not a one-off caseLocals say they have come across many such cases. Akmal Javed, an activist, said, I see many people struggling to get food every day. Many people have come to Hassan from distant places for small jobs. They work in the daytime and sleep in bus stands or on pavements. Nobody is bothered about such people.Indiramma, who runs a hotel with other women, said that four senior citizens used to visit her hotel regularly for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. As they had differences with their children, they were having food outside three times a day. They preferred to have food in hotels to taking parcels. I am worried how they are managing now with all the hotels closed, she said.Last year, during the lockdown, the district administration, with the help of donors, had made arrangements to distribute food kits to the needy. This time, the authorities have not taken any such steps.",Hungry man with no help scavenges for food during Karnataka lockdown,RICE

Smell the fragrant steam rising from the mincemeat stuffing. Squeeze some lemon on it. Add a dash of mint chutney. Blow in through the hole to cool the inside. Take a mouthful. Sigh. This is the recommended procedure to relish the famous smoked keema samosa at Mumbai's The Bohri Kitchen (TBK) owned by Munaf Kapadia.With the city reeling under a never-subsiding coronavirus tsunami, samosas are salvation. So is TBKs pineapple ice cream, rainbow pulao, zuban (goat tongue) in red gravy, bheja (brain) pakora and ghevar mithai. TBK is a pioneer in organised Bohri commercial cuisine in Mumbai where until four-odd years ago, the menu was niche and the khansamas rare.Kapadia was inspired by the traditional dinners made by his mother. TBK started off for selective clients being served in the familys dining room. Mumbai is an eclectic food city - like the butter chicken of Delhi Punjabis and the shami kababs of Purani Dilli, Mumbai's generic food comes from Parsi tables, Irani cafes and the kitchens of the Bohras.""Security and stability are subjective,"" says the foodpreneur who quit a job at Google to sell samosas and has been featured in Forbes Under 30 list. The company's monthly turnover reached Rs 35 lakh with over 200 orders a day.""In August 2015, when I was hesitant to take the leap, my boss said, 'Kapadia, in the worst case scenario, TBK won't work out and youll be back to the corporate race. But, if TBK works out, what it would do for your personal and professional growth would be incomparable'. I took his advice.To catch up on pandemic reading, a samosa aficionado cannot make a better choice than How I Quit Google to Sell Samosas by Kapadia and published by HarperCollins India. A light-hearted take on his entrepreneurial journey as the Chief Eating Officer of TBK, it captures the highs and lows of setting up a food business.""My parents have impacted and contributed to my success. They are behind the incredibly high C-Sat (customer satisfaction) and the impeccable quality of TBK's menu. It is ironic that people give me credit for empowering my mother, when its the other way round,"" Kapadia says.Having become famous for signature Bohri dishes, TBK has wowed the Bollywood crowd. He recalls the evening when a young lady came for a weekend meal. Throughout the meal she kept her sunglasses on. ""I was surprised because our living room isnt that well lit,"" remembers Kapadia.It was only when she got up to wash her hands that the family recognised her - film actor Aditi Rao Hydari, a half Bohri herself. Another time, Kapadia got a call from 'Adi' asking for a 'Thaal' experience to be arranged at his residence. He refused since they had not begun catering yet. Later it turned out that it was Aditya Chopra of Yash Raj Films. He wanted to treat his wife Rani Mukherjee, which Kapadia eventually agreed.Before the COVID-19 wave, Kapadia had scaled up TBK from an exclusive home dining concept to an exotic delivery business with five outlets. ""The pandemic stopped us in our tracks,"" he regrets. Now TBK has shrunk to one outlet, but it plans to expand to other cities such as Delhi and Bengaluru.""Despite the uncertainty we are not giving up. We are fighting COVID with our own weapon -Bohrifoodcoma which is equally contagious, but of the good kind. We are kind of starting from scratch, one biryani at a time,"" smiles Kapadia.

2021-05-01,https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/badminton/aditi-mutatkar-the-girl-who-lived-in-saina-nehwal-shadow-7298379/,"""Being a wife to Chinmay and a mother to Agastya now has made me a much better and a happier human being,"" says Aditi Mutatkar.When a friend who Aditi Mutatkar had not spoken to for years called her last month and guffawed Teri wajah se Saina ko chaataa padaa, the 33-year-old was intrigued. The movie Saina had had its theatrical release and a shadow had propped up from Aditis distant past. Whats more, there had been a dramatic slap on the big screen  when Sainas angry mother raises her hand on her daughter, for losing to Aditi  and Aditi didnt quite remember witnessing any of it.It was only when she nervously watched the film on an OTT platform that Aditi would grapple with a memory that seemed seared in both the minds of the winner and the one who lost.Watching it was a trigger. Though I understand I was just used as a prop (in the plot) to show how she couldnt take a loss against me and it proved to be a sort of a turning-point, Aditi says.While her name was used, she wasnt contacted by the filmmakers. There was no negative reference so thats ok. But when I saw it, I felt I want to tell my story as well, so I got down to penning my thoughts.Saina had risen to stratospheric heights and earned herself a biopic. Aditi was content to tease out a thread of that walk-in part, and flesh it out in a blog-post.It triggered a string of emotions in me and took me back to a period  the last time I was Indias No. 1 without doubt. Everything shifted after that match. I had my knee injuries and Saina just shot up to another level winning the World Juniors by 2008, she says.The comparison would wreck her mind. Look, me and Saina will always be a painful memory for me. She was extra-ordinary. I wasnt extra-ordinary. It is not easy to accept that someone is so good that you dont have a chance at all. I could never break through that aura of Saina, Aditi says, in what is a mix of staggering awe and cutting sorrow.Saina and I were part of the Indian junior team for the European circuit. That was one fun trip and the beginning of the many trips we would make as Indian team players and roommates. Saina and I were part of the Indian junior team for the European circuit. That was one fun trip and the beginning of the many trips we would make as Indian team players and roommates.What happened that dayWhat they showed was that the two shake hands, Sainas pretty happy but her mother is angry. Im on the podium and then comes the slap. But frankly it wasnt in public. I never saw the slap. What I remember is I had proven a point to myself and my coaches that I had not given up. I was back, Aditi recalls.At the 2002 junior nationals in Guntur, weeks before the sub-juniors at Patna, Aditi had received a hammering from Saina. Id never lost to her before that, but she ran past me in that match, Aditi concedes, of a time when she was Indias top junior and Assams southpaw Krishna Dekaraja was No.2. Those were the beginnings of Sainas giant-kills.The Punekar would head back to her base, while coaches Prakash Padukone and Hemant Hardikar would voice their disappointment over a call and say the sorry scoreline was just not done. I was under a lot of pressure and in a different ruthless mindset because I was irritated and focussed on proving a point that coaches couldnt write me off, she remembers.Winning at Patna beating Saina, with Anand Pawar. The one emotion I felt holding that trophy was relief. I had lost to her the earlier week and had faced a lot of backlash from coaches and parents. I was angry with myself and wanted to prove to myself and everyone else that I was still the best player in the country. Winning at Patna beating Saina, with Anand Pawar. The one emotion I felt holding that trophy was relief. I had lost to her the earlier week and had faced a lot of backlash from coaches and parents. I was angry with myself and wanted to prove to myself and everyone else that I was still the best player in the country.Aditi remembers a crackling electric tinge to the rivalry in that final. There was pressure on both sides. Khunnas! I was in good shape and roaring and fighting and got a comfortable lead. By the second game, her confidence had dropped and body language was down.While the loss would be the last time Aditi bested Saina, their careers would head south and north.An aggravated knee would stalk Aditis progress  every good win followed by a longer break nursing truant tissues. Shed concede midway at a nationals playing Saina and then rupture the knee badly in training.When she was chasing me in rankings, there was mutual respect. Her mother would tell her uske jaise khelo, spirit rakho and put me on a pedestal. Off the court I was known for my work ethic, so in our conversations her mother would urge her to follow that. Once she got a hang of it, the distance became too much, she recalls. Saina was World No. 15 and Aditi, 28.Saina would win the Philippines Open in 2006, and move into another orbit as a junior World Champion. Aditi would string a month of good results over the European swing including a fighting final at Bitburger Open Grand Prix, but the gap had begun to widen vastly.Post Bitburger, I could never match her in pace and technique, she recalls of funding herself in Europe, arranging her budget hotel bookings, carrying a rice cooker, MTR packets and 5 litre Bisleri cans everywhere to refill at stadiums so she wouldnt need to spend on water.Indian badminton by now was besotted with the Haryanvi teenager shaking up the global order.Making the Bitburger final and beating some good names was a big deal in 2008. But I remember when I came back to Pune, the World Juniors were on. An umpire Ive known for years walked upto me and asked, Havent seen you around. Have you stopped playing badminton? Id come back with a lot of confidence. But people in my hometown either didnt know or didnt care, she says, more amused now, than bitter.Aditi Mutatkar on the podium at the Bitburger Open: I was in a daze. I had lost that match after serving a few match points. I dont remember the ceremony at all. It only dawned on me later of the things I had achieved through the week and that I had played the Grand Prix final. Aditi Mutatkar on the podium at the Bitburger Open: I was in a daze. I had lost that match after serving a few match points. I dont remember the ceremony at all. It only dawned on me later of the things I had achieved through the week and that I had played the Grand Prix final.Saina had taken the cake though. I knew Id done something big, and I was playing decent badminton internationally. But given my limitations, Saina had become so big in comparison that whatever I did couldnt capture anyones imagination, she says, objectively dissecting a situation as if it was someone else being shaded a dozen years ago.Aditi would beat the domineering Julianne Schenk, a frightful German in quarters, but falter to Indonesian Maria Febe Kusumastuti in finals, despite a bunch of match-points. I had my teammates saying If Saina was playing, she wouldve easily won that match.The shadow had well and truly glued itself to her by now. I lived with that line for a long, long time. I shouldve enjoyed the journey and whatever I was achieving. It wasnt bad. But whatever you did wasnt good enough. I never could step out of the Saina shadow.Coaches Padukone and Vimal Kumar would celebrate her European progress in their under-stated way, but Aditi couldnt match Sainas astounding consistency of the earlier years, which set the future World No.1 apart at the topmost level. She never dropped the ball.Treating her like GodOn her return from Europe, a writer from Bangalore would urge Aditi to scribble about her fruitful European sojourn. I actually wrote a nice piece titled Thank you, Saina! It was written in the spirit of You raised the bar, so we could follow. Day after, Tom sir (coach Tom John) was looking at me funny and asked me in his typical way: Are you an idiot? What have you written? Dont treat her like a god.'Aditi remembers settling into the distant No.2 spot without giving it much thought. It was difficult to push her down from godly level. Because in my head shed become a big deal. Shed raised the bar for every girl in every sport winning titles and beating the best. I couldnt get that aura out of the way, she says.This was a death-knell for her competitive bite, that every challenger needs. Though she could get stuck into Saina using long rallies back then, that only prolonged the inevitable.Aditi jokes she can serve as a giant WARNING sign to the next generation, now chasing PV Sindhu, an even bigger figure. Never put them on a pedestal if you have to play them! Have respect for them, but dont be satisfied with just nicking a few points off them. On the court, you have to start as equal. They shouldnt be beating you in the head even before the game has begun.Badmintons famous clash of cultures between Bangalore and Hyderabad, didnt help matters. Prakash sir and Vimal sir had a very democratic setup. Noone received special attention, and it was like sabko saath leke chalo. (Take everyone along). I had my Pune middle class attitude which could only take me to a certain level. At the top level, you need to be extremely selfish, doesnt matter who falls by the wayside, she explains.Aside of the fact that her body was giving up on her game, Aditi confesses she didnt have the drive in her. If I wanted it as bad, I shouldve gone and snatched it, she says, comparing it to the ruthless setting in Hyderabad.Gopi changed that way of thinking. He professionalised training. For him, it was like Saina is my next project and Im taking her to the next level. Hell take ownership of his players careers and then ensure they reach that level. Practice at 4 am to 5 am. Bas, Aditi says in a mock military general tone.Would she have done anything different?I was in Hyderabad for camps a lot and because Saina was around it was difficult to get unbiased attention. I never felt at priority there. In Bangalore or in Pune there was a sense of independence where I may not have had an individual team for myself I achieved everything on my own terms the best way I knew at that time.Beyond the courtI was immensely proud of what I had accomplished as a student. I had graduated with a 4.0 GPA and had won the University scholarship for being one of the best students in the school. It remains one of my most satisfying days yet. I was immensely proud of what I had accomplished as a student. I had graduated with a 4.0 GPA and had won the University scholarship for being one of the best students in the school. It remains one of my most satisfying days yet.As a 15-year-old, the match recreated in the movie, remained an inflection point for Aditi. We were all in uncharted territory in dealing with me being stuck at No 2. India hadnt seen anything like Saina before, and only I understood what I was going through as a No. 2 and I couldnt articulate it, she says. Her parents and coaches couldnt know the tumult she was going through.I was competitive. But how do I accept that shes 10 times better than me. Not knowing how to deal with it even when I played against her, ate me up, she recalls of a torrid time.By the time Saina medalled at the Olympics, Aditi had faded out in the wings. I wanted to move on. She would apply for Masters in Public Affairs at University of Texas in Dallas, studying government and non-profit management.Its only when I started talking to professors and people outside the sport that I realised Id actually achieved a lot in my career and the magnitude of being an international athlete, even if I wasnt Saina Nehwal. Amongst my classmates, I always brought a fresh perspective to the table. It was as if my life as an athlete was mere preparation for this career, Aditi says, having recalibrated how she saw her achievements.At 15, Aditi had looked at her achievements the way other people saw them: casually tossing them aside compared to Sainas. I saw myself the way Saina saw me. But I shouldve enjoyed the journey more, rather than being caught up in this, she says.She was determined to not marry an athlete of any kind, and in Chinmays family found an environment far removed from the constant comparison.His IT background and their stay in the US helped, as did the arrival of her child, Agastya. Badminton was never a topic of conversation at home. I married a middle class IT guy and that aura of athlete subsided. My in-laws still dont know what that space of sport is.It helped her bring contented closure to her career.I learnt that we should enjoy what were doing and not let another athlete bog you down. Sport is cruel, theres no place to hide. But you cant say, whats the big deal in No. 2. Atleast you are No 2! When I won titles it was always back of my mind that shes not there. But there were other challengers. And I beat them all. It really wasnt as bad as I thought.Aditi frets over headlines that declare an athlete losing in the final as some sort of a failure, while their journeys to the final are ignored. Its either jam nai rahaa hai usko jeetna or its the media teaching them how they need to win. I mean Sindhu knew what she needed to do to win, better than any of us! But everyone had to tell her this is how you should play. We lionise winners, but theres no space for ordinary champions or runners-up. In my life, every opponent gave me something to learn from, and were important in my journey, she rues.Like her, they had untold stories too, beyond a flimsy scoresheet.Having started a bit of coaching few months back, she is at her wits end dealing with parents. Now its everyone working in silos. Parents talk straight away about making kids world champion, theres no reality check. Its a big reason why theres no bench strength in badminton after Saina and Sindhu.The gap between ambition and ability, is gobsmacking for her.And shes lived the gap.Having tried all her life to shrug off the shadow, Aditi is now firmly in Sainas corner wishing her the last gust of power to see out this illustrious career.The kind of person she is, shell come back. Shell leave Gopi, shell leave Vimal, shell do whatever it takes if she decides she wants something. Her team will work around her injuries and maybe get her to play a less explosive game. As a fellow Indian, I want to see Saina as I know her. And Sainas game is in her head. I wont be surprised if we see a last push.Not many can argue with Aditi Mutatkar on her assessment of Saina: their rivalry being nothing short of a movie script in her own head.Shes tried blinking that bit-scene away all her life. But Saina is hard to miss that way.",Aditi Mutatkar: The girl who lived in Saina Nehwal’s shadow,RICE

It is with this idea that the Tirupati Urban Development Authority (TUDA) has proposed to develop a park with high-density plantation, with the larger aim of environment management and carbon dioxide mitigation.The idea is simply based on the survival of the fittest concept.Random saplings are planted in close proximity, that is, at a distance of half a metre, so that the truly deserving ones not only survive but also emerge stronger. The concept was introduced in Japan in the eighties by Akira Miyawaki, a renowned botanist and expert in plant ecology, as a new and innovative reforestation approach. The specialist in seeds used native plant varieties and recommended an unusually dense plantation to trigger competition.The technique has worked worldwide, irrespective of soil or agro-climatic conditions.TUDA has taken up the task of developing a park, touted as a mini forest, in Avilala panchayat abutting Tirupati, where a total of 4,200 plants, comprising 130 species, will be grown in a small area of 1.3 acres.A similar attempt was made by the Forest Department in Vijayawada, Srikalahasti, and near Naravaripalle in the past, but this is the first time that an urban development authority has taken up the challenging task.Native plantsWe are growing native plants such as Maredu, Bandaru, Peddamanu, Udaga, Chigara, Panasa, Adavinimma, Kanchanam, Pasupu veduru, Bandiga Gurivinda, Velaga and Bommalamarri in this park, says TUDA Chairman Chevireddy Bhaskar Reddy. Such trees with wider canopy will ensure development of an entire ecosystem, including microbes, worms and insects, reptiles and birds.Miyawaki parksGoing by its success, more such Miyawaki parks will be developed across TUDA limits, adds Vice-Chairman S. Harikrishna, hinting at plans to create such urban forests in Tiruchanur and Srikalahasti. TUDA invested a mere 10 lakh towards bore-well and drip irrigation network, as the saplings were supplied free of cost by Andhra Pradesh Greening and Beautification Corporation. The existing soil was replaced with fertile top soil, coco peat, vermicompost, or cow dung, and rice husk in equal proportion.",TUDA plans ‘mini forest’ near Tirupati,RICE

(Photo: Pixabay)When it comes to health, people mostly understand it as independent of their genetic makeup. But health and wellness do not exist in a vacuum. Everything is interconnected and interdependent and within you, in the form of a network, which helps the body stay in the pink of health.As such, given that one factor influences the other, and given the fact that we have been braving the pandemic for a while now, the overall well-being of a person needs to be prioritised. How can that be done?Amol Naikawadi, preventive healthcare specialist Indus Health Plus, says that although humans are similar in genetics, they have slight differences called single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that make each one of us unique.These polymorphisms are responsible for differences between individuals and the impact nutrients have on our body in terms of how we metabolise the food we eat. Any individual response towards a diet will be different due to genetic variance, he tells indianexpress.com.Naikawadi explains that genetics can help us understand the tendencies for deficiencies and levels of certain vitamins  like A, C, D, B12, D  minerals, calcium, homocysteine levels, etc.He adds that genetics influences our food tastes and sensitivities. For example, tendency of lactose intolerance, preference to bitter taste or sweet taste, response to fiber-rich diet, protein-rich diet, gluten intolerance etc.ALSO READ | Here are four reasons you should switch to canola oilHow can a person know about their genetic makeup?They can identify their genetic makeup through genetic testing.

I grew up with Gujarati friends. And the realisation of being Jewish. So I was really inhabiting three worlds, says author Esther David, over a call from Ahmedabad.Her latest book, Bene Apptit: The Cuisine of the Indian Jews, published by HarperCollins, opens with the lines Food is memory. Food is culture. Food bonds families and communities. Hence, in the face of a rapidly fading collective memory of the Indian Jewish experience, Esther decided it was time to travel across the country to record their traditions. In the process, she uncovered closely guarded recipes for dishes such as chik-cha-halva, jumping potatoes, agar agar jelly and even a Jewish biryani.But you are still thinking about the zoo, arent you? Esthers unconventional childhood was thanks to her father Reuben David, a self-taught veterinarian and influential conservationist who created the Kankaria Zoo in Ahmedabad and was awarded the Padma Shri in 1975.An illustration from the book | Photo Credit: Esther DavidMy father decided that religion was not really necessary. So yes, we were told we were Jews. But there was no orthodoxy, she says, explaining that she imbibed the idea of being a Bene Israel Jew in bits and pieces. She adds, A lot was forgotten. But relatives would come from Israel. Jewish friends would arrive with chick-cha-halwa a fudgy, labour intensive sweet made with whole wheat, coconut milk, nuts and raisins. I would come across a prayer book in Marathi, Hebrew and English All this made me think about what it meant to be Jewish.Tracing rootsFrom 50,000 Jews who lived in India till the 1940s, there are only 5,000 families left.They form five main communities: The Bene Israel Jews of Western India, the Cochin Jews of Kerala, the Baghdadi Jews of Kolkata, the Bene Ephraim Jews of Andhra Pradesh, and the Bene Menashe Jews of Manipur and Mizoram.All these communities found ways to adapt local recipes and ingredients, in keeping with our dietary laws. Meat must be kosher and you cannot eat it with dairy  so you cannot even put ghee on a chappati, says Esther.To record the recipes from each community, Esther travelled to synagogues and Jewish homes across the country, starting with Machilipatnam, Andhra Pradesh.Everywhere people were really wonderful. There is a fraternity, a family feeling. They were not only happy to cook these recipes for me, but also to translate and write them down.While most of the recipes are simple, with tweaks, like using coconut milk instead of dairy in keeping with Jewish dietary laws, the collection is also a fascinating account of a diaspora that blended into India harmoniously, yet managed to retain a unique identity.Author Esther David | Photo Credit: Special ArrangementIn India, it it difficult to find kosher meat, so many Jews here are vegetarian. When we have the fast of Yom Kippur, we break it with grape sherbet and sweet puris in Gujarat. In Kerala, they eat rose cookies, or achappam. The law is it has to be something sweet and salty: and both fit exactly, says Esther, explaining how local curries, snacks and sweets have been adapted.The community has been very observant, and adapted what is most authentic and closest to the dietary law, she says, adding, So for Shabbath (Judaisms day), if you cant make bread, make chappatis. Of you dont want to do that, appams are fine. Everywhere I went I noticed they found a balance between dietary laws and the regional culinary influence.Adapting local recipesThough many Indian Jews have moved to Israel, Esther says they continue to cook the food they grew up eating. South of Israel, it is like little India in the kibbutz: the food, the language, the songs... Every year, they all make it a point to come to India for the festivals like Yom Kippur. If there is a wedding, they come.As she recorded recipes, Esther was fascinated to find some that spanned the world. Kanavali, or Shabbath cake, is made by the Bene Israel Jews with roasted semolina, jaggery and coconut milk. The Cochin Jews make a version with grated coconut, eggs and cardamom. I found some version of this all over the world, she says, adding that she traded recipes at Jewish conferences in Israel, France and London.Confessing that she does not consider herself a great cook, (I am too impatient,) Esther still worked her way though the recipes in the book, with help. Chick-cha-halwa is very difficult. You start at 5am and end at midnight, she says. Now there are shortcuts, but that is a another reason I thought I need to document the original recipes.A sculptor and artist, Esther also drew the charming illustrations that punctuate the book and brighten its cover. Winner of the Sahitya Akademi Award in 2010 for English Literature, her previous novels focus on the Jewish experience in India.A book cover of Bene Apptit: The Cuisine of the Indian Jews | Photo Credit: Esther DavidExplaining why she decided to plunge into food writing, she says, My sources are beginning to forget some of the older recipes. Everyone is now into quick cooking and fusion. Our tastebuds are forgetting our heritage.Esthers Jewish roots combined with her unorthodox upbringing proved to be the ideal recipe for Bene Apptit, since research involved sitting down at many dining tables. Though there are many rules, my father lived in the land of the tigers, she laughs. He was very particular that if someone invites you home, you should enjoy whatever they serve.Despite being a reluctant cook, along the way she too picked up memorable recipes from Indian Jewish kitchens. I love the Bene menashe communitys black rice pudding, with chak-hao, nutmeg and cashewnuts, in Manipuar she says. And I am now famous for my Tilkut potatoes, tossed with spring onions and sesame seeds.",Esther David collaborates with Indian Jewish communities to record recipes for ‘Bene Appétit: The Cuisine of the Indian Jews’,RICE

Plants and tending to them is a therapy, it is mentally unwinding and de-stressing. And millennials have made it A Thing. Its a beautiful feeling to come back home to gaze and tend to your garden, whether its in a balcony or just a nook of a room on some old furniture. Plants reduce anxiety and have a calming effect. Research shows that horticulture therapy helps old people struggling from dementia or people with depression or addiction.Since many of us these days live in apartments and space is less, there are various ways to set up a small garden. It could be your bedrooms window sill or a corner of your kitchen. Growing herbs such as coriander, dill, etc, could be used to flavour your cookouts. Its fresh, convenient and using your hands in the mud helps to iron out worries, a rewarding feeling when you reap the fruits of your labour.A typical urban apartment has the choice of getting customised balcony gardens these days with professionals to lend an aesthetic air based on the space, light, personal taste and exposure. Terracotta pots could be heavy, so lighter pots made of fibreglass or rice pots are being used by many. Therapeutic gardens are becoming popular, particularity in special needs settings such as care facilities for the elderly or hospitals for engaging in activities such as watering or getting your hands dirty in the mud.Nature heals, there was this story of the last leaf when this girl was sick and the artist drew a leaf and she survived thinking that the leaf is still there despite the stormy night. such is the power of nature.

Union home minister Amit Shah was here every week over the past three months.But their strike rate in the districts was lower than that before the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. This time, the BJP seniors focus was more on connecting with the Bangali bhadralok.Modi addressed the Visva Bharati convocation, pointing out how Rabindranath Tagore was the guiding light for his New Education Policy.Later, Shah spent hours at Visva Bharati, listening to Rabindrasangeet and watching a dance recital by the students there, before holding an impressive road show in Bolpur.But all these efforts didnt translate into seats in Birbhum, where the BJP won only Dubrajpur out of 11 constituencies there.Modi, however, seemed to have a high impact on the Siliguri electorate, as they voted CPM-turned-BJP candidate Sankar Ghosh to victory with a massive margin, as well as the people of Jalpaiguri.The PM and the home minister also steered the party to victory in seven of the nine seats in Cooch Behar.Modis visit to the seat of Matuas at Orakandi in Bangladesh also helped BJP win the seats in Bongaon of North 24 Parganas, but his magic failed to work at the Barrackpore and Barasat.Their campaign in South Parganas took BJP to the second position in some seats, but couldnt win a single seat from the district.BJP seniors were in for a shock in Hooghly and Howrah that had upset them the most. BJP national president J P Naddas intensive campaign in East Burdwan  the rice bowl of Bengal  didnt fetch the party expected seats either.On the contrary, a dissent against the huge election gatherings in the times of Covid was gathering among some voters in Kolkata and its periphery, prompting BJP spokesperson Shamik Bhattacharya to point out Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee, too, was holding such meetings.Modi didnt address any meeting in Kolkata other than his opening rally at Brigade Parade Grounds in February. Shah also cancelled his roadshow later.Shahs campaign to win over the dalits, Adivasis and namasudras didnt work at expected levels in South 24 Parganas, Burdwan and North 24 Parganas, while the Muslim votes consolidated in favour of Trinamool.While Adivasis in north Bengal went with BJP, their counterparts in Jhargram and parts of West Midnapore didnt favour BJP as much as they did in the 2019 LS polls.","Modi-Shah magic worked in north Bengal, not in south",RICE

With veganism, plant-based diets and sustainable living gaining momentum, the use of jackfruit is being reimagined all over the world. Especially in India, where it is a familiar summer fruit.When Goa-based entrepreneur Sairaj Dhond decided to launch a food business five months ago, he chose to focus on jackfruit. The brand, Wakao Foods, began with a range of heat-and-eat products  jack patty, teriyaki, barbecue and even butter chicken-inspired butter jack. The best seller is the jack burger patty and he is currently working on developing a range of desserts from raw jackfruit. It retails online, and has physical stores in Goa, Maharashtra, Telangana, and New Delhi. Chennai and Bengaluru are next on his list.Jackfruit burger | Photo Credit: Wakao FoodsThe fact that it is a tasty cruelty-free alternative to meat works in its favour, he says, refusing to narrow down its definition to mock-meat. He aims to carve an independent identity for the fruit with his brand It is a superfood. We are sitting on something of so much value, and so little is being done with it. Jackfruit is found in almost every backyard in Goa, more of it goes to waste than use. It is underrated and taken for granted. I want to take it across the country, says Sairaj. The other states he sources from, besides Goa, are Kerala, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu.Prized fruitWorld over, however, jackfruit has been touted as a healthy substitute for meat. In Bengal, it is even called gach patha, which translates to tree goat as the unripe pods are used as a substitute for mutton. It is cooked on special occasions too. The non-vegetarian version, when cooked with onion and garlic, is very popular. Another famous variant is cooking with prawns or shutki (dried fish), says Kolkata-based Sunindita Chatterjee, who is into business process outsourcing, adding that it is the perfect substitute for meatless days. Her favourite is the faux mutton curry.While it is prized for its flavour, and sweetness when eaten ripe in the southern States, it is used more as a vegetable [kathal] in the north. Raw jackfruit goes into kathal ki sabzi, another popular take is kathal biryani. In Bihar, it is made in the style of a kala mutton curry  a dish made with whole and ground spices, cooked over low flame. Raw jackfruit pieces are fried and then curried. Jackfruit cutlets [like shammi kebabs] are another popular way of consuming it, says homemaker, Jayati Sinha of Patna.Jackfruit biriyaniFound in Maharashtra, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Goa, Bihar, West Bengal, Odisha and Assam, it is a vegetable/fruit that can be consumed nose to tail, as architect and culinary enthusiast Tsarina Abrao Vacha puts it. Raw or ripe  almost every part of it, including the seed, minus the rind, can be eaten. In Kerala, no part of the chakka (jackfruit in Malayalam) goes to waste. It is eaten in so many forms  from a vegetable stir fry to chips. The fruit is also eaten in so many ways; besides the ripe fruit, jackfruit is also made into preserves, payasam and snacks. But, I believe, it is not being used as much as it should be or could be, she says.Tree Goat Biryani The highlight of the banquet for Chennai-based restaurateur NS Krishnamoorthys daughters wedding recently was the range of dishes made from jackfruit. Biryani, sukka, roast, jackfruit seed curry and even the dessert  mukkani thaen (banana, jackfruit and ripe mangoes in honey). Needless to say that everyone who attended the wedding will remember the spread, chuckles Krishnamoorthy, of Prems Grama Bhojanam.Sous chef D Murugan, of Malgudi  The Savera (Chennai), has perfected jackfruit biryani. We use tender, raw jackfruit which weighs around 750 to 800 grams. Only then we would get the desired texture and taste. It is flavourful because the jackfruit absorbs the masala, looks and tastes just like mutton, he says of his Ambur style biryani.This mock meat biryani is trending as it is vegan, and is enjoyed by the health-conscious too, says Krishnamoorthy, who calls it a treat for vegetarians.During the lockdown, in 2020, jackfruit was widely consumed and experimented with in Kerala when there was a scarcity of fresh vegetables in grocery stores. Traditionally, most Kerala homes have a tree in the backyard. With each tree, which grows organically, giving 50-100 kilos or more of fruit every summer, there is always enough for the household, neighbours and friends.Pride of KeralaIn 2018, jackfruit was declared the State fruit of Kerala, celebrated for its high nutritional value. Kerala boasts several varieties broadly classified into two varieties  varikka (firm fleshed) and koozha (soft-fleshed). Since the State has trees that grow naturally, there arent too many plantations. The State Agriculture Department is promoting its procurement, trade and processing.Even the rind is not discarded, says Sreelakshmi Prabhu, a MasterChef India contestant [Season 5] and home cook. Kochi-based Sreelakshmis ancestors migrated to Kochi from the Konkan coast.The rind of the tender jack is eaten, deep-fried. The leaf is also used to cook. For Ugadi, we steam idlis in them. The tree is important to us. We dry and preserve the rags [which hold the fleshy avril to the rind], use it as kondattam [crispy fries]. Tender jack, deep-fried and dipped in a mix of rice powder, chilli and turmeric and asafoetida tastes as good as fish! she says.Chennai restaurateur NS Krishnamoorthy of Prems Grama Bhojanam says, If not biryani, sukka or curry, people at least make palakottai (jackfruit seed) sambar, and in villages it is usually made along with drumsticks, mango and brinjal. It is a rural delicacy, and you have to taste it to believe it! At the restaurant jackfruit biryani and sukka are made every weekend on pre-orders.When the vegetable is raw or semi-ripe, it does not have a distinct taste, unlike the ripe fruit. The neutral flavour is its USP. It takes on the taste of the spice or ingredient that is added to it, the reason it works as mock meat. The stringy-ness of the flesh and meat-like texture enhances the similarity to meat. I have used it even as a savoury filling for ravioli besides burger patties and barbecue too, says Rajeev Menon former executive chef Crowne Plaza (Kochi), food coach and restaurant consultant.The global superfoodIt is underestimated and ignored, wasted and fed to cattle... it is now in focus when we are conscious about plant-based foods which positively impacts the planet, says Kochi-based Tsarina, who still remembers her first encounter with a contemporary jackfruit dish.Jack in tacos | Photo Credit: Wakao FoodsIt was in 2008, at a vegetarian caf in Zurich. A tart with grilled pulled jack and shards of cheese it was so different from how I knew it was cooked, she says. She has been using it as a vegetable, fruit and flour in her cooking  in souffl, baos, cakes, pies and even cheesecake. She adds it to her sourdough bread mix, with the flour. James Joseph, who came up with the idea of making flour out of jackfruit [branded as Jackfruit 365], says it is an energy-dense food, a replacement for vegetables and fruit. The flour is vegetable in powder form  one tablespoon is equivalent to a serving of vegetables. It has properties that help with blood sugar management, he says. Jackfruits protein and fibre keep its glycemic index low.The flour is dehydrated, powdered jackfruit which extends its shelf life and lends itself to use in various ways  added to dosa batter, chapati dough, dal or any other dish. All the jackfruit he uses is sourced from across Kerala. The jackfruit season starts first in the southern tip of Kerala, the other parts of the State follow. It does not happen all at once, so for almost eight-nine months a year, we have more than enough supply locally to match demand. I have suppliers who can get me 200 tonnes of jack per day; we process only 10 tonnes per day. The demand for flour has increased since October 2020, he says.He uses semi-ripe jackfruit, as the raw ones are exported  to other parts of India and abroad, and ripe ones to Tamil Nadu. All the jackfruit used is sourced from homesteads  uncultivated or wild jackfruit as Joseph calls it.(Inputs from Chitradeepa Anantharam)","The humble jackfruit gets its due, it’s uses are being re-imagined in modern and more contemporary ways",RICE

As the vicious second wave of coronavirus sweeps across the nation, there is no end to the horror stories of people struggling and suffering. But in these moments of adversity, there are some acts of kindness and compassion that have helped lift the gloom and doom of Covid-19. In such extraordinary times, humanitarian response is needed to heal the scars of the pandemic and Dr Tapas Panda and his wife Rajashree Panda have done just that, going the extra mile to lend a helping hand to those suffering. The couple has started a free kitchen service for Covid patients in home isolation and their families in Bhubaneswar. Riding his bike, 50-year-old Tapas covers the length and breadth of the State Capital, distributing food packets to families bearing the brunt of the ongoing crisis.On an average, he travels more than 100 km and caters to around 60 families on a daily basis. And the number of beneficiaries is rising with each day as the pandemic tightens its grip on the city. When I started the initiative 15 days back, there were only a handful of infected families who sought my help. Now, I provide food to more than 60 families every day. The households that I serve have several members, the maximum being 11 and the lowest 4, all in home isolation. There are single persons too who need my assistance, informed Tapas. An associate professor in the Centre for Agri-Management of Utkal Universitys MBA department, Tapas is a native of Nayagarh district who currently resides at Nandan Vihar in Patia.Since classes in the university have been suspended due to the pandemic, he is devoting his entire time to reach out to those in distress. Supporting him in the initiative are his wife Rajashree, viceprincipal of a play school, and 11-year-old daughter Tapasya, a student of Class V. I am only a postman delivering food packets but taking all the credit. In reality, she is the one doing all the work. She has to cook four times a day to prepare food for such a large number of people. My daughter is the packaging in-charge as she packs the food in boxes. The food packets contain rice, chapattis, fried veggies, dal and a curry. Tapas said he provides extra servings of chapatis and rice in a packet so that people dont stay hungry in the night.What made him start the free kitchen service? Tapas said, Two of my friends went into depression after getting infected by the deadly strain of Covid- 19 in the second wave. Despite being well-educated, they were gripped with the fear of death and became so hopeless that they stopped taking food. On seeing their condition, I decided to deliver food at their doorsteps. Subsequently, they recovered but I realised that hundreds of infected persons might be having similar thoughts. I decided to extend my food delivery service to other Covid patients and their families too. In order to reach out to more people, he shared a post on Facebook providing his contact number and details of his service.My students helped me make the post viral. I knew food was an essential need for infected persons staying away from their families. But I was not aware of the severity of the situation. A few regional media houses did stories on my initiative following which calls for help started increasing. The demand swelled after Union Minister Dharmendra Pradhan tweeted about me. Now, most of the families I serve food have their kids working overseas, he said.Tapas and his wife get up at 3 in the morning every day to ensure that the food is prepared in time and the packets delivered by lunchtime. The packaging is done by 8.30 am after which Tapas rides out to deliver the packets. Now, he is assisted by five volunteers who help him deliver the food across the city. Many people have come forward to provide financial help but Tapas feels it is his responsibility to give it back to the society which helped him during his time of need. Throughout my life, I have been working for cause-related initiatives. There were many people who helped us when we needed it the most. We are paying it forward by helping those in need. Its as simple as that, he informed.Rajashree echoes her husbands views. She said, Cooking for around 2,500 persons daily is no doubt a tough job but I dont complain. Both of us went through difficult times, but there were people who came to our rescue during our crisis. Now it is our chance to do good for others. Tapas said it is disturbing to see deaths in families and the pain of losing a loved one.I feel helpless of not being able to do anything. Every day, we read about the suffering and agony of Covid patients and the rising number of deaths. This only creates panic and anxiety among people. Due to misconceptions associated with coronavirus, some people think they are going to die. The fear of Covid has become worse than the disease itself.

What with the civic body banning plastics in 2019 and people, at least most of them, adhering to it. But when there is an opportunity to go zero waste, why not, right?Helping residents in this endeavour is entrepreneur Jignesh Pujara, owner of Lyfe by Soul Garden Bistro. Plans were put in place last year after he studied responsible consumption and sustainability. But owing to the pandemic, his zero-waste store, Eko-Lyfe was launched in mid-April 2021.Claiming to be the citys largest zero-waste store, Eko-Lyfe is located opposite Lyfe by Soul Garden Bistro in Alwarpet. Giving a virtual tour of the 1,200 sq ft space, its in-house facilities and the extensive line-up of products, he says, Customers are encouraged to leave their footwear outside as a mark of respecting food. You find reusable containers and glass jars on the shopping trolley. You can either pick that up or bring your containers.The shop is divided into different segments based on where each product is stored. Soon after you enter, to your left youll find indigenous rice varieties such as kichili samba, sona masuri hand-pounded raw rice, kullakar boiled rice, mappillai samba boiled rice, thooyamalli raw and boiled rice kept in canisters. The segments are separated by a weighing machine to measure the product purchased. To ease the process, weve placed dals, hand-pound flours, nuts and millets next to rice. Weve invested in a machine in which fresh flour is ground and handed over to customers, explains Jignesh.Placed next to the shelves of grains are sweeteners like powdered jaggery, palm jaggery, palm crystals and palm sugar. To make your daily cooking easier, the shop offers in-house masala and spices. In-house idli and dosa batter, ground flour, and peanut butter are made to order. Their specially curated bread menu comprising whole wheat, multigrain, pav bun, ciabatta, focaccia, French baguette, sourdough loaf, etc is a delight for the expats, he says. People have become health conscious after the pandemic. As retailers, we need to be one step ahead of their needs. Our dairy products are procured from native cow varieties. The edible cold-pressed coconut, gingelly and groundnut oil are also in demand, he shares.A whole section is dedicated to vegan goodness. Our frozen mock meats are hot-sellers. Theres vegan curd, milk, cheese and spreads. We also offer in-house Italian low-fat gelatos. Seasonal vegetables and fruits are also available and theres a shandy every Wednesday and Sunday, he shares. We also catch a glimpse of a collection of eco-friendly vessel scrubs, bottle cleaners and traditional cookware at the shop. After shopping, patrons can relax at their in-house cafe Antari for quick eats.The cafe serves coffee and tea in edible biscuit cups. Other food and drinks like air-fried samosa, french fries, potato wedges, sandwiches and pastries are served in biodegradable bagasse plates and cups. Even the furniture in the cafe are made from waste paper pulp. However, due to the lockdown restrictions, they only offer takeaways.The store reflects Jigneshs vision. Theres a community fridge outside the store, where edible food (extra food from our bistro) can be picked up by the needy. Given the situation, as a precautionary measure, for the first time in Chennai, we have installed Shycocan. The device continuously emits photons that form an electron cloud in an indoor space. The negatively charged electrons neutralise the positive charge of the S-Protein of Coronavirus, thereby disabling it from infecting a person.At the same time, we recommend following precautions as advised by WHO, elaborates Jignesh, who has plans of opening zero-waste stores in other parts of the city. Our priority is to offer safe food, ensure fair pricing for farmers and consumers, protect their livelihood and curb plastic use.

The hobby she started a few years ago has now become a zero-waste pet project she runs at home.Opening up about her creative journey, Geetha says, My two children have settled abroad. I used to get bored at home. Two years ago, one day I accidentally saw a DIY video on making decorative boxes out of discarded cardboard. This piqued my interest. Ever since I have been converting waste in my house into upcycled products, she says. She learns a few of the tricks from YouTube and adds some of her creativity now and then.Anyone entering Geethas house is welcomed by a doormat made using her thirty-year-old silk saree. The walls are adorned with painted hanging storage bags decorated with beads. Its almost hard to believe that these were made using an empty 5kg matta rice cover. The dining table is arranged with a flower vase made from folded newspaper, coloured and decorated using groundnut shells and empty medicine strips.Geetha is often teased by her husband, Bhuvanendran Nair, a retired sub engineer at KSEB, about how she never leaves waste at home. She makes artificial brinjal using eggshells, beauty boxes using folded newspapers, small hand-held baskets from paper cups and wool, dolls from socks and old uniforms. It depends on my mood. Sometimes, I take a day, sometimes it is a whole week, she says.Geetha adds that her focus is more on upcycling than on an items aesthetic value. There were bundles of used clothes that my children grew out of. Earlier people from orphanages used to come and collect them, but now due to Covid protocol, they stopped. So, I made doormats using old leggings, t-shirts and old sarees. My handicrafts are not for sale. I give it to my family and friends. When they come to know theyre upcycled, most of them are surprised. I inspire them to be sustainable too, she says.It amazes one to know that she has turned even the cloth cover that the government food kits come in, into decorative flowers. If you wash and dry them, they become bright and clean. I only buy glue, tape and decorating beads online, says Geetha.",Waste is just used less,RICE

This deep-fried snack migrated from Sri Lanka through the Ravuthar Muslim men who travelled there for business centuries ago, bringing back food stories that would eventually find their way into Ravuthar kitchens, says Hazeena Seyad, who has documented hundreds of such recipes in her book Ravuthar Recipes- with a pinch of love (Hitech Universal Printers and Publishers). Shaped like a spacecraft, this deep-fried vaadaa is crunchy outside and chewy inside.E very coastal village has its own variant, she explains.Sri Lankan watalappam: a cardamom-spiced coconut custard sweetened with jaggery, and thakkadi: rice flour dumplings in mutton curry are other celebrated iftar dishes in Tamil Muslim homes. The recipe of thakkadi is over two centuries old. The mutton curry is a hearty dish made with aromatic spices, coconut milk and poppy seeds to which the dumplings poached in mutton broth are added, adds Haseena.Vaadaa stuffed with prawns | Photo Credit: Special ArrangementThis month, Muslims world over observe a daily fast that begins with a pre-dawn breakfast or sehri, usually at 4 am, and ends with an evening meal or iftar around 7 pm or 7.30 pm.Shammi kebab | Photo Credit: MKM Faiyaz AhmedThe iftar meals give them a chance to reconnect with their heritage through food. Along with favourites like kanjis, haleems and kebabs, communities across the country bring to the table a diverse and exciting fare that celebrate their unique cultural influences.China grass halwa | Photo Credit: Ammeez KitchenFor the Konkani Muslim community in Goa and Maharashtra, an iftar meal is incomplete without sandan  fluffy, steamed rice flour cakes made with yeast-fermented batter of rice and coconut. We slice it and smear it with malai [cream] and dry fruits, or have it plain with chicken curry, says Shabana Salauddin, a home chef who doles out authentic Konkani-style Muslim fare through her venture, Ammeez Kitchen.The majority of Konkani Muslims trace their ancestry to Arab merchants who arrived in the region over a millennium ago, married local women and settled along the Konkan coast. Konkani cuisine is a blend of coastal Maharashtrian flavours and Middle Eastern influences. Our cuisine keeps changing from one village to another, unlike the Bohra Muslim cuisine which remains the same across the world, points out Shabana.This cuisine also includes badam ki kanji (crushed almonds boiled in milk with sugar and cardamom powder) that packs an instant punch and sabudani ki kheer (sago boiled with a few spoons of milk and sugar) to bring down the body temperature after an entire day of fasting.Arabian rice with chicken | Photo Credit: MKM Faiyaz AhmedThe cuisine of Kutchi Memons, an ethnic group that traces its roots to Kutch, Gujarat, has signature iftar specials that include bajre ka kebab made with millets, an one-pot dish called dhokray (steamed bajra dumplings in mutton gravy) and khichada with rice and dhal. You can find the recipes only at Kutchi Memon households. The recipes are considered sacred, and guarded zealously, says Anisa Arif, from Gujarat and is now settled in Chennai. She runs Zaiqa, the spice store.Mohabbat ka sharbat | Photo Credit: MKM Faiyaz AhmedThe drink of loveAt MKM Faiyaz Ahmeds home in Hyderabad, popular dishes are gulabi jalebi, Arabian rice and mohabbat ka sharbat. Yes, you heard it right. This drink is a a blend of milk, watermelon, cream and dry fruits. While Hyderabadi haleem forms an important part of iftar for Dakhni Muslims, other specialities include murgh malai tikka, boiled and mashed dal, mutton shammi kebab and fruit salads, a hangover of the Awadhi and Nawab cultures, says Faiyaz, who makes promotional videos for restaurants.Murgh malai tikka with malai in the kettle pot | Photo Credit: MKM Faiyaz AhmedBohra Muslims, who are said to have migrated originally from Yemen to Gujarat, draw from their Gujarati roots, balancing savoury with a little sweet. Bohras always eat in a communal setting, which is basically nine people around a big round thaali, called a thaal, says Sakina Sabunwala, based in California. Our popular dishes are kaari and chawal: a nuts and coconut-based mutton gravy with rice, and dal chawal palidu, a rice-based authentic Bohra dish. Gol paani or rosemilk is a common drink used to quench our thirst after breaking the fast.Haseen Yaseen with her iftar spread that includes Malabar dishes | Photo Credit: Special ArrangementIn one region, the cuisine is strikingly distinct. Moplahs, the Muslim community in Malabar, in the northern districts of Kerala, carry on the legacies of the merchant traders who visited the region centuries ago. Chennai-based Gazeena Sulu Kunhamed, who is from Malappuram, recalls how women would sit in a circle and roll innumerable ari pathiri, a thin chapati made out of rice flour, believed to be innovated by the women for their Arabian paramours, who were used to a bread-based diet.Our iftar table will be laid out with Malabar dishes like chatti pathiri, meen pathiri, chicken cake, Iranian pola, and kaipola... those were the days, recalls home baker Haseena Yaseen wistfully. Settled in Coimbatore, she adds that for sehri, her grandmother (ummacha) made a sweet dish for children with njaalipoovan, a variety of banana, milk and sugar. It was called madura paal. Other iftar staples at Moplah Muslim homes include Jeerkakanji made with coconut milk and shallots, and godambu kanji made with wheat, chicken, coconut milk and other ingredients.Says Gazeena, Our snack mutta mala (egg garland made with yolk) descended from the Portuguese who lived in huge numbers in parts of Kozhikode.

2021-05-05,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/finding-success-with-a-soil-less-medium-for-terrace-gardens/article34491302.ece,"Growbag with rice husk as major component helps plants growA combination of charred and uncharred rice husk in 1:1 proportion along with dried cow dung and coir pith compost has been successfully experimented as a soil-less medium for growing vegetables on terraces and in kitchen gardens, the interest in which appears to have boomed because of the restrictions imposed on peoples movement to contain the spread of COVID-19 pandemic.A.A. John Sherry, Assistant Director, Agriculture Department, said he had been experimenting with the soil-less medium for three seasons and that he had met with considerable success.According to his initial understanding, the chemical make-up of rice husk, which has ingredients like silica, ash, carbon, calcium and magnesium, is the key reason for the success. These contents in rice husk provide a certain sturdiness to plants. Besides, there is considerably more air circulation in a growbag with husk in place as a major component. This is a condition which helps root growth.It has also been observed that pest attack in plants grown in the medium is less. Another advantage is that growbags filled with the medium is significantly lower. Conventional growbags with soil as medium weigh around 10 kg to 12 kg whereas the weight of growbags filled with rice husk-dominated medium is around three kg. This is an advantage when growbags are on house terraces.Mr. Sherry said that the culture of growing vegetables in growbags had now spread to rural areas too though it was initially an innovation to help those in the urban areas to use any little space available to grow vegetables they wanted. One of the key disadvantages has been that it is difficult to get good quality top soil and the new medium could be an answer to the problem. While the use of soil can be avoided, rice husk that is dumped as waste by milling units can be utilised profitably, he added.",Finding success with a soil-less medium for terrace gardens,RICE

She decided to go on a solo drive to explore them. When the plan came to the execution level, her 10-year-old son Narayan hopped on too. The duo started its pan-India trip named, Oru Desi Drive on March 17, with a plan to cover the length and breadth of the country by road, in 100 days, covering more than 20,000 kilometres.They had crossed 27 states and six union territories in 50 days as of Wednesday. However, the second wave of the pandemic hampered their trip, forcing the duo to wind up their tour early. We had to make a sudden change of plans as I had to get back to the Government Ayurveda Hospital, Tripunithura, for Covid duty. But we managed to cover all the states. We hope to reach Kochi before the second week of May, says Mitra who spoke to us from Jammu and Kashmir, a dream destination of her son.Mithra updates the culture, food, art, architecture, lifestyle and titbits of every region that she visits through her Dekho Apna Desh hashtag on her social media page named Wind In My Hair. It was Narayans dream to see and feel the snow. I took him along on the trip to teach him the real world outside textbooks. My husband Satheesh and mother Radhamani encouraged me too, says Mitra who undertook a solo trip to Bhutan before embarking on Oru Desi Drive.The duo starts its journeys at 5am every day, halts at homestays or huts in villages for the night. I get in touch with the friends residing in the respective places or just randomly get in touch with villagers. We prefer to eat lunch and dinner from the houses we visit. Breakfast is usually dry fruits and cornflakes with milk that we carry with us, explains Mitra.Some of the unique instances that caught Mitras attention are the Salmora potters of Majuli village, century-old terracotta temples in Bishnupur in West Bengal and a sweet delicacy named Puthrekullu in Atreyapuram village in Andhra Pradesh.Mitra adds that a lot of research went into the journey. Even then, the globetrotter faced unexpected hurdles during her well-planned trip. Like her visit to the Mata Vaishno Devi Temple in Jammu. We had a chance to visit the temple and reached there on a chopper. But surprisingly there was no return chopper service. We embarked on a two-hour-long horse ride back to our halting station in Srinagar, but managed to get back safely. These plot twists make the trip fun, she quips.NORTH-EASTERN ADVENTUREOne of her favourite memories from the trip is from the north-eastern part of India. According to her, there are many communities in states like Assam, Meghalaya and Nagaland living far from the modern civilisation. They live in mud huts and make food from weeds. There are even people who eat out of plates made out of big leaves, like the Bodo community in Assam. There is a misconception that we will only get to eat non-veg dishes in northeastern states. I got to eat around 10 vegetarian dishes made using leaves and herbs. Also, when my son insisted on staying in one of their mud houses, the community let us, she says.#UnexploredBastharOn the outskirts of Chhattisgarh, there is Basthar district, an unexplored pocket of rural life. Many people warned me not to enter Basthar village which is prone to Naxal attacks. But there, I found many gentle people having unique culture and customs. We got to meet the Dhuruva tribal community in Jamawada village who spoke with me in Hindi. Their food habits are unique. They make gruel using ragi and rice and eat it with red ant chutney served in plates called Dhoni made from Sal tree leaves. One could even buy these red ants from the markets in the village, says Mitra.",Going on ‘oru desi drive’,RICE

It at least is not for these young entrepreneurs, who quit their high-paying jobs to start something on their own, something that keeps them awake at night and something that makes their heart beat.We speak to three such souls, whose lives are over and above the conventional paisa, bangla, gaadi, as they are driven by a passion for either food, music or making a difference. Their journeys have been tumultuous, there have also been some regrets. But ask them today and theyd say, Its all worth it. Here are their stories.Sandeep Gorre, Viva Italia (restaurant)With an education in culinary arts, Sandeep has worked in the top hotels of the country and abroad. Be it the Marriott or the Fairmont, hes been in the busiest of kitchens creating experiences for the whos who of the world. A well-traveled man, while he was with the Marriott in Palm Island, Dubai, he was offered a job in Australia. Quite tempting an offer, but he chose to return to Hyderabad and start something on his own, despite having a rich experience of 11 years as a Mediterranean and steaks chef.I was 27 years old then, which was the right time to gamble with my career. Not too young, not to old. Thats when I thought of introducing the common man of Hyderabad to the thin crust pizza. I opened Viva Italia in Banjara Hills with an open-air seating back in 2011, he says. At first things were smooth sailing, barring the few guests whod wonder why hes selling them papad with toppings? But four years later is when the road got rocky. Delivery portals entered the market and people started to order-in. But not many realise that thin crust pizzas need to be had pipping hot.The concept of thick crusts of pan pizzas came up to suit the takeaway model, as the crust is able to retain the temperature till the parcel is delivered. But if one has managed to survive three years, means they are doing something good, he says. While Sandeep admits that the pressure of running your own business is high, he seems content with the way things are. So far, so good!Jai Bharathi, MoWo Social Initiatives FoundationAn accomplished architect, who had an endless list of projects to boast about and was on a promising career path, 39-year-old Jai Bharathi gave it all up. Reason: she was hellbent on making a difference to the lives of the women in Telangana (she also wanted to trot around the globe). But her story goes back a few years. In 2013, my friends were busy buying apartments and settling down, while I started the Hyderabad chapter of Bikerni (an all-womens biking group).I just needed an excuse to travel and, being an architect, I love visiting historical places. In 2012, I took up the Go UNESCO Challenge wherein I had to visit all the UNESCO heritage sites in one calendar year. In short, I would do anything that allowed me to travel. And thats how started biking, she says. Enjoying the independence of being on the road and the empowerment that comes with being in control of a machine, Jai Bharathi wanted to share this with every other woman she knew.This made her collaborate with NGO Tharuni in 2017, which works to empower women, to hold weekend two-wheeler training sessions. My mission in life is to bring women into the mobility sector. I want to get rid of this stigma that only men can be drivers or delivery agents. Theres also this mindset that women cant ride bikes. Why not? If they can earn a living and support their family through these means, then why not? she asks. So, to chase her dream of making a difference, she took a break from architecture in 2018 and conceptualised Moving Women (MoWO), which was set up a year later.I have a long-term goal: I want to bring women into the mobility sector by 2030. Now with a pandemic raging across the world, Jai Bharathi does sometimes think if she made the right choice. Its a major shift from earning to paying a salary. Now, I have to think twice before buying a pair of jeans or taking a trip. But when I see these women ride and feel independent, I know in my heart that its all worth it. It is very satisfying, something that a desk job or a monthly pay cheque could never give me, says the social entrepreneur who is full of compassion.Arun Ruben, Fat Cat (restaurant)The man has dabbled in the corporate world, live music industry and has finally found his feet in the food industry. Ruben started off as a language trainer at BPO, after which a popular MNC absorbed him. He was earning well and had a settled life, like many would say. But music happened. I started doing gigs and it was so fulfilling. As a cover artitse, I loved giving my own twist to English classics. But I never wanted to venture into mainstream music, he says.But the pandemic struck the city and Ruben, a vocalist, was forced to break up with music on Valentines Day in 2020. Thats when, to make ends meet, I started Fat Cat in Sainikpuri. This venture is all about no nonsense soul food, food that you can curl up to. I serve basic stuff such as omelette pav, butter chicken with ghee rice and ham sandwich, to name a few, he says. Rubens idea was to bring conversation back to the table, and for that he takes his guests down memory lane.The softy ice-creams and chuskis will make you put down your cellphone or turn away from the TV. It will make you share a memory with the others at the table. I want my guests to go back 20 years in a 20-minute meal, the proud restauranter says.

2021-05-06,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/how-kerala-feasts-on-a-variety-of-pathiris-during-the-month-of-ramzan/article34498450.ece,"While even the traditional pathiris vary from one place to another, there are umpteen varieties that are eaten as snacksIt is the month of Ramzan and in Kerala, pathiris  gluten-free flatbread made with roasted rice flour  are everywhere, especially in the northern districts of Kozhikode, Kannur and Malappuram.Even traditional pathiris vary from place to place, within these regions. The finest version called neriya pathiri or nice pathiri in Kozhikode becomes a slightly thicker orotti or kai pathiri in Vadakara, Thalassery and Mahe. Tyre pathiri, the plumpest of the lot, resembling a bun, is popular in Wayanad. Ranging from the basic flatbread to layered and deep-fried varieties, one is spoilt for choice.Rice pathiri | Photo Credit: Nabila ShanavasRice pathiris are usually rolled out by hand or with the help of a mechanical press. Then there are the ones made of refined flour (maida) or wheat flour, that can be prepared in a variety of ways  fried, steamed or baked.Madakki pathiri or kannu vacha pathiri (square-shaped fried bread made with wheat flour), thenga (coconut) pathiri, silky pathiri, mixed rice pathiri, kinna pathiri, and arachu chutta pathiri are a few other variations. Ney pathiri or ney pathal is deep-fried variety with shallots, grated coconut and cumin in it.Chattipathiri has multiple layers of paper-thin chapathis or pancakes and has a sweet filling. It is baked or cooked in non-stick pan | Photo Credit: Nabila ShanavasAbida Rasheed, doyenne of Moplah cuisine, says: I make all the different kinds of pathiris during Ramzan at home since my mother and husband are from different parts of Kannur, and my father is from Kozhikode.Dough it rightThe three basic ingredients of rice pathiri are roasted raw rice flour, water and salt. The dough is made by cooking flour in boiling water. Kneading the dough itself is an art, and has to be done while the dough is still warm.The bread has to be dusted generously with rice flour (that is why they are called podi pathiris as well). If these conditions are not met, pathiris may not puff up when they are cooked. The flour should be of good quality. Besides this, the proportion of the flour to water will have to be correct to get the right consistency. It is not an easy process, but even now I make my own pathiris at home, adds Ummi Abdulla, an 86-year-old expert of Moplah cooking.Although pathiri or orotti flour is available in the market, many still use freshly milled flour. Rafiya CK, a home-chef from Kozhikode, says that at least five kilograms of rice flour, roasted and plain, are stocked in most households during the month of Ramzan to make pathiris alone. While I use a press, at my in-laws place they make heaps of it using a rolling pin. And all of them look identical, she says.Irachipathiri has meat filling | Photo Credit: Nabila ShanavasWhile the thin pathiris are rolled out using rolling pin or in pathiri press, the thick ones are hand-pressed by flipping the dough in the hands. Experienced cooks stretch and flatten the balls in no time with their hands. Pathiris taste better if you cook them on a banana leaf instead of directly placing them on the pan, says Abida.Tyre pathiri, a hand-pressed variety made of boiled rice, is placed between banana leaves and cooked in clay pots. Then it is held upright using two spatulas and wheeled around in the pot to cook its edges. It tastes best with coconut milk, explains Rafiya. The trickiest to make is the super-light nura (foam) pathiri. A batter of rice flour and eggs is beaten vigorously, and the foam that rises to the top is poured on a hot pan.Orotti | Photo Credit: Sreejith R KumarChattipathiri Ingredients: Eggs: 15, Refined flour (maida): 250 gm, Sugar: 300 gm, Couscous: 50 gm, Ghee: 100 gm, Cashew nuts: 50 gm, Cardamom powder: 1 1/2 tsp, Raisins: 50 gm, Milk: 1 glass, Refined oil: 2 tbsp, Water and salt: as neededEggs: 15, Refined flour (maida): 250 gm, Sugar: 300 gm, Couscous: 50 gm, Ghee: 100 gm, Cashew nuts: 50 gm, Cardamom powder: 1 1/2 tsp, Raisins: 50 gm, Milk: 1 glass, Refined oil: 2 tbsp, Water and salt: as needed Method: Knead the refined flour (maida) and make 12 balls. Roll them out as paper thin chappathis. Half-cook them on the pan and keep them aside. Whisk four eggs, one-third of the sugar and some cardamom powder and make a scrambled mix. Fry cashew nuts and raisins in two tablespoons of ghee. Fry the couscous without adding ghee. Mix the remaining eggs, sugar and cardamom powder and keep aside. Also, have the milk ready in a flat vessel. Place a non-stick pan on the stove and pour remaining ghee to it. Place a chappathi inside after it is dipped in the milk and then in the egg mix. Spread the scrambled egg, nuts, raisins and couscous on top of it. Continue the process with each chappathi. Pour two tbsp oil and the remaining egg mix on top. Close the pan and cook it on low flame for 30-40 minutes. When it is ready, cut it into desired shapes and serve.Knead the refined flour (maida) and make 12 balls.

Recipe by Rafiya CKAlthough coconut milk is considered the best accompaniment for pathiris, Abida says it can be combined with any curry, such as mutton stew or kurma, chicken curry with roasted coconut or fish curry. The katti pathiri-cumin chicken combination is a favourite at her home, says Rafiya. And among her favourites for Ummi is a dish made with maas or dried fish.And then there are the pathiris that are prepared as snacks for Iftar. Popular ones include meen pathiri (steamed rice pancake with fish masala), irachi pathiri (double-layered puri stuffed with meat) and niracha pathiri (with sweet filling). Chatti pathiri, athishaya pathiri and ithal pathiri are all layered ones. While the first two are prepared with maida and has sweet and savoury fillings respectively, ithal pathiri is made using rice flour. Ithal pathiri or ithal roti is so yummy. At the same time, it takes time to get the layers correctly, says Ummi.Thurkki pathiri or a spicy-sweet deep-fried dumpling is a traditional snack popular in parts of Kannur, she adds. Kunji pathiri (kakkarotti or kunji pathal) or steamed coin-shaped pathiris mixed in a meat gravy is also prepared in many households.Thurkki pathiri is fried dumpling with sweet and spicy fillings | Photo Credit: Special arrangementAll said and done, the fillings can vary from one kitchen to the other. It all depends on the preferences of the family members.However, in central and northern Kerala, while rice pathiri and orotti are a must, the accent is not much on the stuffed or layered pathiris, says chef Naushad, who hails from Thiruvalla in Kottayam district. I prefer orotti to pathiri. We also have neypathiri, in which we add sesame and, sometimes, turmeric, he says.Kunji pathiri, kunji pathil, kakkarotti or chakkoli is steamed coin-shaped pathiris in a meat gravy | Photo Credit: Nabila ShanavasThiruvananthapuram-based Nabila Shanavas, a home chef and restaurateur, prepares both the traditional and snack varieties, at home and to be sold as iftar snacks at her restaurant, Oroti. Thanks to my sister-in-law who is from Kozhikode, we have a scrumptious spread of pathiris at home. Some of the dishes  muttapathiri or ottada, for example  come from my mothers side who is from Thiruvamcode in Kanyakumari district. While we prepare it with rice flour and egg, in Malabar region they use maida. We have a special clay pot to cook this pathiri and it goes well with coconut milk or ghee, and sugar. Chakkoli is our version of kakkarotti. Then there is omana pathiri, which is basically maida dosa with a sweet filling, Nabeela says.The list just goes on, as experienced hands across the State experiment with taste, technique and ingredients in their kitchens in this holy month of fasting and feasting.","In Kerala, one can’t get enough of pathiris during the month of Ramzan",RICE

I loved its hot flavours and the plump egg in it. A couple of Sundays ago, I suddenly pictured that delicious golden rice with juicy pieces of meat in it and thought I needed to do something about this yearning.I had earlier ordered from a place called Biryani Badshah, which had Andhra food on the menu. This eatery has branches and I tried out the outlet in Laxmi Nagar, which delivers through Swiggy and Zomato. There was some consternation about the name, a debate that wed been having at home ever since I expressed a desire to order food from a Chinese restaurant called Shagun. But never judge an eatery by its name, I have always held.So, the order was placed: Hyderabadi dum biryani (329), extra salan (15), kaju ki sabzi (209), chicken 65 (249) and double ka meetha (99). I started my meal with the chicken 65, which has been an old favourite ever since I first had it when a breakaway faction from Andhra Bhavan cooked it for us at some get-together long years ago.Legend has it that chicken 65 was first started by Chennais Buhari Hotel in 1965, though some said it was so named because it was cooked with 65 spices.Badshahs fare did not disappoint me. The chicken, marinated in and cooked with yoghurt, was deliciously tender, and had taken in all the spices that it had been mixed with before being pan-fried. The chillies and curry leaves gave the dish a punch.What surprised me was the kaju sabzi. I have never had this, but I am quite a cashew nut fiend and thought the dish sounded promising. It had a creamy sauce of roasted ground cashew, flavoured with onions and tomato.I then went on to the biryani and salan. The salan  a mix of ground peanuts, sesame seeds and coconut  was nicely spicy, and went well with the biryani, which was hot, but had retained the flavours of the whole spices it had been cooked with. The rice was the way it should be in a good biryani  long and aromatic, and not sticking to one another like loyal members of a clan.I was a little suspicious of the double ka meetha, as it didnt look much like the famous Hyderabadi dessert and seemed a bit runny. But it turned out to be rather nice  there was the flavor of saffron in the sauce, and cardamom added to the taste of the bread that had been softened and soaked in thickened and sweetened milk. The sweet dish brought the curtain down on what was quite a nice meal.I took the last spoonful of the double ka meetha and sighed. Whats in a name, I said to no one in particular.The writer is a seasoned food critic",A lazy Sunday biryani,RICE

Patients without a PAN card or Aadhaar, as well as those who arrange to pay their treatment costs through cash loans of over 2 lakh from a single lender may also face challenges, said tax lawyers.Section 269ST of the Income Tax Act, introduced after demonetisation, entails a 100% penalty for receipt of all cash payments over 2 lakh, but was proving to be a hurdle for several patients families as many dont have access to cashless payment options.Following a petition filed in the Delhi High Court on Friday that sought a relaxation of the relevant Income Tax law provision amidst the pandemic, the government late on Friday notified changes to permit such cash payments for COVID-19 patients treatment till May 31, provided the healthcare provider obtains the PAN or Aadhaar of the patient and the payeeMaharashtraICICI Lombard extends pay to COVID-hit staffPrivate sector non-life insurer ICICI Lombard on Saturday said it will give up to two months gross salary in advance to all its COVID- positive employees.The individual can pay back the advance in 6 or 12 monthly instalments at a later date, the insurer said.The company will also reimburse medical infrastructure support expenses up to a maximum of 10,000 per family member, arising from home quarantine in case of infected employees.PuducherryLt.

Private multi-speciality hospitals are also another reason for the increased inflow to Hubballi. This seems to be the likely cause of shortage of medical oxygen in the coming days.Dharwad currently needs 45 tonnes of medical oxygen daily and is able to manage the active cases at present. However in the likelihood of more cases with oxygen requirement, it would be difficult to manage it, said another source.Makeshift hospitals coming up in the district and additional beds being provided in other government hospitals are likely to further increase the demand for more oxygen.New DelhiAnti-COVID-19 drug developed by DRDO gets emergency use nodThe Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) has granted permission for emergency use of an anti-COVID-19 therapeutic application of the drug 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG), developed by the Institute of Nuclear Medicine and Allied Sciences (INMAS), a lab of the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), in collaboration with Dr. Reddys Laboratories, Hyderabad.In a release issued on Saturday, the Ministry of Defence said that as per the order, emergency use of this drug as adjunct therapy in moderate to severe COVID-19 patients is permitted. It added that being a generic molecule and analogue of glucose, it can be easily produced and made available in plenty in the country.The drug comes in powder form in sachets and is taken orally by dissolving it in water. It accumulates in the virus infected cells and prevents their growth by stopping viral synthesis and energy production. Its selective accumulation in virally infected cells makes this drug unique.KarnatakaRecovery rate plummets to 70% in KarnatakaAlthough COVID-19 patients are discharged from hospitals on the fourth or fifth day if they develop clinical stability, the States recovery rate has reduced considerably in the last one month.From 98.1% on February 28, recovery rate reduced by over 1% to touch 97.8% on March 15. Subsequently, it further dipped to 96.3% by March 30 and 90.1% in mid-April. In the next 15 days, the recovery rate saw a drastic reduction to touch 73.9% on April 30. As of Saturday (May 8), the recovery rate has touched 69.9%.Among the districts, Gadag and Chitradurga have the highest recovery rate at 91.76% and 90.51% respectively.

His statement turned the tide, so to speak, as feeding animals became something that was no longer frowned upon. In fact, it generated quite a buzz.A year later, animal lovers are again hoping that the Chief Minister will speak up for the animals and their plight, for the situation seems to be much grimmer this time.People for Animals (PFA) secretary Latha Indira says they are not getting enough food this time around. Yesterday, I got fish waste, sorted it, and gave it to the stray dogs. But I dont know what I will do today.It was not easy finding slaughter or chicken waste last year, but the PFA animal feeders managed somehow. The waste was then cooked along with rice in a kitchen set up in Sasthamangalam, and delivered in the city and even places as far away as Kachani and Aruvikkara. On a day, the PFA and its feeders were dropping off food for 750 to 1,000 dogs.Now, as fewer customers flock to slaughterhouses, they have scaled down operations, even putting up the shutters for a day or two in a week. This has affected the PFA supplies.A bigger worry though is finances. The feeders pay out of pocket for the meat waste and the rice fed to the dogs. And the PFA has been feeding dogs continuously for the past one year, says Ms. Latha. We have not stopped since the first lockdown began, though it has been scaled down to 250-odd dogs. But we do not have the funds to buy meat waste and rice, employ a cook to prepare it, pay for fuel for the deliveries, and the driver. Neither do we get grants or many donations.Much as they want, it is difficult to feed the dogs on the scale PFA desires. Unlike the city, there are many places such as Vizhinjam and Poovar where they do not have feeders and nor are they able to reach there. Yet, they have not given up. They are still delivering food to a handful of feeders so that the animals can be provided food.A simple solution to the problem is for people in a locality to feed hungry dogs like they would people, says Ms. Latha. Residents associations can do a lot in this regard. All it requires is kindness. It is also good from the public health viewpoint as once the dogs are fed and become friendly, they can be vaccinated and sterilised. Friendly dogs are not aggressive either, and help keep strangers away at night, she points out.She welcomes the State Police Chiefs orders to police personnel not to block people feeding dogs. A word from the Chief Minister, she says, will be a shot in the arm for animal lovers as it will further increase acceptance of feeding stray animals. For now, it is a day-to-day struggle to fill their bellies.",A struggle to feed dogs during the lockdown in Kerala,RICE

Alexander on Sunday decided to hasten the procurement of harvested paddy in the district. The meeting was convened following a delay in the procurement process.Officials said that the entire harvested paddy kept in paddy polders would be procured in four days. Assistant directors of agriculture have been directed to initiate necessary steps to ensure rice mills procure paddy without delay.Farmers earlier alleged that mills were demanding more wastage citing high moisture content in the harvested paddy. This has resulted in friction between farmers and mills. The meeting entrusted assistant directors to hold discussions with those padashekara samithis who are at loggerheads with mills.Paddy farming has been undertaken in around 28,913.655 hectares in Alappuzha district in the 'puncha' crop season (first crop), a major portion of which is in Kuttanad.

We are probing the matter and are about to collect the statement of the hospital management. We have asked the sectoral magistrate and Tehsildar to look into the matter and a report will also be submitted to the district collector in his capacity as chairman of the District Disaster Management Authority,"" said P.S. Rajesh, Station House Officer, Aluva East.The police, however, have not invoked the Kerala Epidemic Disease Ordinance citing that it was silent on excess bills and mostly covered civic violations. Neither have they invoked the Disaster Management Act as it requires the approval of the authority concerned.The complainants alleged that the exorbitant bills were not commensurate with the facilities offered by the hospital. That there is no uniformity regarding the billing for Covid-19 treatment by private hospitals does not make enforcement easy either, police said.On its part, the hospital management alleged the issue was politically motivated and born out of an ongoing legal battle since 2018-end over the ownership of the hospital. The present management had taken the hospital for a 10-year lease in 2017 reportedly with a mutual understanding to buy it in two years. However, the 2018-deluge threw a spanner in the plans and the owner allegedly sought the hospital to be vacated abruptly thereafter leading to the legal battle.In the instant case two patients had complained about the bill  a woman about the food expenses and a male patient about the cost of 40 PPE kits included in his bill for his ten-day-long admission. The allegation by the former that we charged 1,300-odd for rice gruel served for dinner alone is misleading. It was the total expense for all her meals served as per demand over her 24-hour-long admission. The latter wanted us to show the cost of PPE kits of 40,000-odd as treatment expenses so that he gets it reimbursed under his medical insurance.

In Keralas street food hubs and cafes, age-old food pairings are being replaced with quirky combinations that demand a leap of faithPuttu with parippu (dal) and duck egg roast at Nairs Puttu Kada at North Paravur | Photo Credit: Balram MenonPuttu with parippuNairs Puttukada (puttu shop) has a very direct title. But if you go in expecting the usual, cylindrical rice cake puttu to be served along with a plate of kadala (black chick peas) curry, pappadom and a banana, as is the unquestionable tradition in Kerala, you would be surprised. At Nairs, the puttu is served along with dry parippu (lentil), a strange bedfellow. A spicy duck-egg roast is also part of the package. Mohanan P Nair, the owner of the 56-year-old tea shop in Chathanad, about eight kilometres from North Paravur in Ernakulam, says he thought up the combo and started serving it over 17 years ago. I wasnt sure. But it clicked, he says, over phone from his home. Now, he has people from faraway places seeking out the dish. The tea shop that usually opens at 4.30 pm is now closed owing to the COVID-19 situation.We are not entirely new to bizarre food pairings. 2020 saw a few of those go viral on social media. Blame it on COVID-19, for nothing else can logically explain chocolate Manchurian, Nutella biryani or chicken tikka chai. Dishes such as the one at Nairs, however, are unusual yet extremely palatable. It seems very peculiar at first. But the combination grows on you, says businessman and vlogger Balram Menon, who used to frequent Nairs shop. The dry lentil brings in the perfect balance between the spice in the duck egg roast and the puttu, he adds.Pazhampori and beef at Sree Muruga Cafe, Tripunithura | Photo Credit: Balram MenonBeef roast with banana frittersOne of the oldest among Keralas odd couplings is the pazhampori (banana fritters) and beef. Sree Muruga Cafe in Tripunithura, Kochi, popularised this rather wacky combination, which is a popular snack today. Started in 1943, the tea shop has always sold pazhampori and beef roast, but it became famous much later, says Sathyan K B, the owner of Sree Muruga. Around 1994, when Malayalam actor Jayasurya was shooting for a television show, he and the crew happened to see someone relishing pazhampori with beef. Word spread quickly and the media made the dish popular, he adds. The combo is one the best selling at Sree Muruga today.TV personality and chef Raj Kalesh says the pairing owes its origin to North Indian lorry drivers, who ordered the sweet pazhampori to balance the spice of the famed Kerala beef roast. Kerala was always known for its beef roast and it gradually became a thing to order pazhampori with it, he says. The fritters too are crispy, fried in rice batter instead of maida, adds Kalesh.Savalavada (onion pakora) with squid or chicken roastAny fried snack works well with any non-vegetarian gravy, says Ashvin George, a traveller and food enthusiast. Salwa, an eatery in Thoppumpady, Kochi, usually does brisk business around 5 am based on just this principle. Its best-selling dish is savalavada (onion pakora) served with squid roast. It is just savalavada usually, but once in a while, there is pazhampori as well. Every morning, they fry up these delicious snacks by 2 am or 3 am for the men who go out to sea. The savalavada is often had with chicken or beef roast as well, adds Ashvin.While the rest of us drool over porotta-beef fry, Ashvin also suggests you have the beef fry with neyyappam (a traditional sweet made of jaggery and rice flour). He tasted this combo at a small hotel in Wayanad, whose owner (whom he refers to as Majeedka), grinds the rice for the neyyappam in the afternoon and makes them in the evening. The beef, prepped as early as 10 am, is cooked slowly through the day, and makes for a soul satisfying match with neyyappam.These are not conventional combinations. It is up to each person, really. Whatever floats your boat, adds Ashvin, whose personal idea of an ultimate breakfast is poori with fried eggs.Aval isthiri at Satheeshan PVs tea stall in Kannur | Photo Credit: Special ArrangementAval isthiri (poha, sev and banana)Satheeshan PVs tea stall at Kannapuram in Kannur does not have a name. But everyone in the locality and across Kerala knows his shop for its aval isthiri (which loosely translates to ironed flattened rice). Satheeshan is not sure how the dish got its name, but he has been serving it since the 1970s. His father came up with the dish, which is something like a Malayali bhel puri  made of aval, sugar, Robusta banana and sev (omapodi).The magic is in the mixing of ingredients, says Satheeshan, whose has seen his father make it back in the day. It is a hot favourite here; simple, healthy and filling, he adds. People from across Kerala have travelled to Kannur to try the dish, says Satheeshan. If you examine it, it is rather simple. But I am not sure what inspired my father to come up with such an unusual dish, adds Satheeshan, who claims he has not made any change to the dish.It is going to be a while before we can eat out again, so but if you are bored of your rice with sambhar, feel free to reach for the cheese in the fridge.",Unusual food pairings that Malayalis love,RICE

In high-dependency wards in NABH hospitals, the rate is Rs 4,175 and Rs 3,795 in non-NABH hospitals.For ICU beds, the rates for NABH and non-NABH hospitals cannot exceed Rs 8,580 and Rs 7,800 respectively. For beds with ventilator support, the maximum rates are Rs 15,180 and Rs 13,800 for NABH and non-NABH hospitals respectively.These rates would be inclusive of registration, doctors charges, oxygen, anesthesia, blood tests, X-ray, nursing and boarding. However, high-end tests like CT chest and HRCT along with costs for medicines like remdesivir and tocilizumab are not included in the rates. Still, the hospitals cannot charge over and above the MRP of these medicines and the normal rates for the tests. The rate for RT-PCR tests will continue at Rs 500.If hospitals end up imposing charges above the government-prescribed rates, they would attract a penalty 10 times higher than the patients charge, the government order stated.The Kerala High Court Monday orally asked all private hospitals providing Covid-19 treatment to abide by the rates prescribed by the government or else face action. It slammed hospitals for indulging in profiteering during a pandemic.Citing a report of a private hospital purportedly having charged a patient Rs 1300 for a bowl of kanji, or rice gruel, Justice Devan Ramachandran said, Our humble kanji is being charged Rs 1,300. If kanji is charged Rs 1,300, we may find it difficult to swallow.The bench of Justices Ramachandran and Kausar Edappagath said it found bills of hospitals charging Rs 25 for a paracetamol and Rs 22,000 for PPE kits.

The States which have started distribution of the 5 kg of free rice and wheat include Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Tripura and Uttarakhand.The progress is on expected lines, given the eight-month experience of implementing the PMGKAY during the first wave of COVID-19 in 2020, said Food Ministry Joint Secretary S. Jagannathan. He added that 34 States had already begun lifting food grains from the Food Corporation of Indias stock, and 15.5 lakh tonnes had been lifted so far.Asked about the needs of migrant workers affected by the lockdown, as well as others without ration cards, Mr. Pandey said that this time, migrants are not facing that kind of crisis as there was during last years lockdown. There was also no national lockdown this year, but only State and local lockdowns, he said, noting that migrants who reached home would be able to avail ration in their villages, while those still in the cities would make use of the ration card portability scheme. The Centre was also selling its food grain stock at a discounted rate to NGOs and to State governments for those with State ration cards, he said.Plea by activistsHowever, Right to Food activists have filed an intervention application in the Supreme Courts suo motu case on migrant workers, saying that migrants are facing distress during the current local lockdowns as well, and seeking a resumption of last years scheme to give free food grains to those without ration cards as well. In an open letter to the Chief Justice on Monday seeking an urgent listing of their plea, petitioners Harsh Mander, Anjali Bhardwaj and Jagdeep Chhokar said payment of minimum wages as cash transfers and appropriate transport facilities for migrant workers were needed as well.With regard to edible oil prices, which had shot up over 50%, Mr. Pandey said the release of imported stock stuck at Kandla and Mundra ports due to COVID-19 related clearance issues would help to ease the situation.",One lakh tonnes of free food grain distributed so far under PMGKAY,RICE

Chandrasekhar Rao has convened a meeting of his Cabinet on Tuesday afternoon to discuss imposition of lockdown in the State in view of surge in COVID-19 cases.A release of CMO said the meeting was taking place in the background of diverse opinions emerging about lockdown yielding results to curb COVID. Reports suggested that the results were not satisfactory in some States where lockdown was clamped. At the same time, sections of people favoured lockdown as the only way to deal with the situation.In these circumstances, the Cabinet will discuss the merits and demerits of lockdown and its impact on the ongoing procurement of paddy in villages.Tuesdays meeting has assumed significance after the High Court on Wednesday last asked the State government to consider weekend lockdown or extending the night curfew hours which are presently 9 p.m. to 5 a.m. Chief Secretary Somesh Kumar had told media persons that the Cabinet will discuss the observation of the court and take an appropriate decision. Both, Mr. Rao and Mr. Somesh Kumar were of the firm opinion earlier that lockdown would not serve the purpose. Mr. Rao had also suggested that lockdown would bring life to a standstill and result in collapse of financial system.Added to this was the Chief Ministers assertion that imposition of the lockdown at this stage would cripple the normal life and economy of the State which is on a recovery mode. From a huge shortfall of revenue of close to 50,000 crore during previous financial year, the State is inching towards normalcy in revenue collection. Tax and non-tax revenue during April was more than  9,300 crore, including States own revenue of close to  6,750 crore, indicating that the State is on accelerated recovery financially.He based his observation on past experiences and COVID positive cases not coming down in States where lockdown was in force. There were 25 to 30 lakh workers from other States working here. The first wave of COVID showed how their lives were adversely impacted by lockdown.What will happen to the workers from other States who are working in rice mills in the midst of the ongoing paddy procurement season? The entire paddy purchase process will come to a standstill, Mr. Chandrasekhar Rao had said at an official meeting which was his first after going into home isolation for testing COVID positive.Senior officials are of the view that the present scenario is leading to a lockdown-like situation where there could be more restrictions, not a full-fledged closure of all the activities. The situation is trending towards lockdown. There is 60 % chance of imposition of lockdown at least partially, a senior official told The Hindu.Officials feel that there will be more restrictions on the movement of people and public gatherings rather than a total lockdown.",Telangana Cabinet meeting on Tuesday to decide on merits of lockdown,RICE

Rahuleyan, Cherthala taluk secretary of the Kerala State Retail Ration Dealers Association.The demand for priority vaccination has been raised with the State authorities, he said, as he pointed out that the government had not considered their plea so far.Johny Nelloor, president of the All Kerala Retail Ration Dealers Association, said ration dealers had knocked on all doors to get them enlisted as a priority case for vaccination. But there has been little response from the government, he alleged.Twenty ration dealers had died of COVID-19 and many are in hospitals, he said and called on the government to at least provide some compensation for the families of the deceased.One of the threats dealers face is that they use the biometric system and EPOS machines for payments. The procedures require close proximity between dealers and buyers, constantly exposing them to the risk of infection, said Mr. Nelloor.Mr. Rahuleyan said that on an average, dealers service 70 to 100 card holders, depending on the availability of supplies. There is no way to know who are infected or who come from COVID-19 containment zones, he said.One of the requests made by ration dealers is that if the government made supplies available in one go, it could end the need for multiple visits to ration outlets. At present, a card holder visits a ration outlet to take delivery of normal supplies, provisions through the Central scheme under PMGKAY as well as special rice supply. Most often, these entail three visits but if these supplies can be combined, the number of visits can be cut down, he added.Meanwhile, sources in the Civil Supplies Department said that the issue of priority vaccine for ration dealers had been taken up with the State government from the beginning and that the matter was being pursued.",Ration dealers demand priority in vaccination,RICE

2021-05-11,https://www.newindianexpress.com/opinions/editorials/2021/may/11/cause-for-concern-in-telangana-2300926.html,"The Telangana government believes there is no need for a total lockdown as the Covid-19 scourge is fully under its control. Interestingly, it is the only state in India where there is neither a total nor partial lockdown except for a night curfew. But the Telangana High Court is not so gung-ho about its newfound optimism that it can tame the demon. It suggested at least a weekend lockdown but the state is not in favour of that either. The government maintains there is no empirical evidence that a lockdown would curb virus spread. Instead, it argues a shutdown would cripple the states economy besides killing livelihoods.But the figures paint a different picture. Telangana stands at the 23rd position in terms of the percentage of the population vaccinated with at least one dose. Of the 3.76 crore people, only 11% have received at least one dose and only 2% both the doses. The positivity rate for the last one week was 8.5%, which is 3.5% more than the WHO threshold. The positivity rate should be less than 5% for two weeks in a row to arrive at the conclusion that the infection is plateauing. There is no disputing that 8.5% on May 9 is less given the high rates of positivity in states like Goa (47.9%), Uttarakhand (37.3%) and so on. But it is still a cause for concern.There is also an argument that the relatively small positivity rate is due to low testing. The number of those tested came down to as few as 55,358 on May 9 even when the High Court has been insisting on one lakh tests per day. The contention may be that the positivity rate will remain constant regardless of how many tests are done. But as we are dealing with an exponentially increasing Covid-19 infection, the argument might not hold water.On the flip side, the state has made some right moves. It has been stocking up enough oxygen in hospitals and is also providing the poor five kg of rice per head free of cost for two months. The chief ministers decision to appoint on ad hoc basis a large number of doctors from among 50,000 students who have completed their MBBS courses is another positive.

The decision to shut down till May 21 was taken in the cabinet meeting chaired by chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao.With this, Telangana has become the last state in the southern India to go for lockdown. Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Andhra Pradesh have already imposed full or partial lockdowns. The Telangana cabinet will again meet on May 20 to take a decision whether to continue lockdown.Under the new guidelines, only a handful of facilities have been told to shut completely. These include cinema halls, swimming pools, clubs, gyms, amusement parks, and sports stadia.An official statement said relaxation will be given daily between 6 am and 10 am allowing all shops to open. Public transport like the RTC buses and metro and also liquor shops will be open during these hours. Government offices will work with 33% staff. Banks and ATMs would function normally.E-commerce services like home delivery for essentials, food, medical equipment have been exempted from the curfew. IT and IT-enabled services, including telecom, postal services and internet too have been exempted.Earlier in the day, the Telangana high court had said that there was a talk of lockdown being imposed after Eid was celebrated on December 14. The judges had said that if the state was to shut to reduce the impact of the second wave of Covid-19, the decision should be taken immediately. By afternoon, the government had informed the court that the cabinet had decided on shutdown.Sources said that, so far, KCR was reluctant to impose a lockdown in the state and even went on record that it would impact the livelihood of crores of people, especially workers and labours, apart from hitting the state revenues. He was of the opinion that there was no improvement in the states which had gone for lockdown for the past few weeks.Keeping this in view, the cabinet decided to continue paddy procurement in the centres and exempted all fertilizer and seeds shops, all agriculture and allied sectors like rice mills, warehousing, cold storage, transportation of paddy.The state government also decided to give exemption to all emergency services such as medical shops, hospitals, panchayat raj and municipal services to take up sanitation drives, drinking water supply and power supply. The state government offices are also allowed to function with 33% of their strength.Apart from the lockdown, the cabinet asked chief secretary Somesh Kumar to ensure that all essential medicines required for treatment of Covid-19 patients, including remdesivir and oxygen supplies, are available for both government and private hospitals.

Home chef and author Indra, also an advocate for consuming locally grown foods, says, Pearl millets are especially power-packed with carbohydrates, essential amino acids, antioxidants, multiple vitamins like thiamine, riboflavin, folic acid, niacin, beta carotene and minerals like iron, phosphorus, magnesium and zinc.Benefits aplentyIt is good for a diabetic diet as the carbohydrates in this are digested slowly and help maintain a stable glucose level.It is beneficial for heart health. Kambu has cholesterollowering properties and is good for heart patients. As it also contains an adequate amount of good fat, it is good for patients with high cholesterol.It is the perfect grain for people with celiac disease and gluten intolerance.Therapeutic for people with frequent acidity and stomach ulcers.The high phosphorus content in kambu helps make the bones stronger, especially in growing children.It has a good amount of dietary fibre and hence helps in relieving constipation.It makes for nutritious baby food.Kambu is rich in antioxidants and helps fight ageing.Ideal food for weight management.A healthy choice for pregnant and nursing mothers.Make the switchYou can make the switch to millets by starting with little millet and then work your way up to other millets. Start with idlis as they are steamed and easy for the body to accept and nourish. Then, gradually, you can make dosas, upmas etc. You can even bake cakes and cookies with kambu.Word of cautionBefore moving from rice to millets, do thorough blood work to check all your parameters. Also, talk to your doctor about opting for millets. When you use millets, never mix different millets in your diet. Each millet has different digestive properties and it may not always suit your body. Soak the millets for five-six hours before cooking them because it can cause bloating otherwise. This is one of the reasons, it is suggested to start consuming millets by making them as idlis, because it goes through the soaking and fermentation process.Kambu IdliINGREDIENTSBajra flour: 3 cupsWhole urad dal: 1 cupFenugreek seeds: 1 tspPoha: 1/4 cupSalt to tasteMETHODSoak urad dal and fenugreek seeds in water for five hours.Soak bajra flour in water too. (Water upto the level of the flour only)Then, approximately 15 minutes before grinding, soak poha in water and grind everything together.Once grounded, mix the flour.Add salt and let the mixture ferment for eight hours. As an indicator, make sure that the batter rises and forms bubbles on top.After fermentation, grease idli plates and pour the batter on the moulds.Steam it for ten minutes. Let it cool down. Serve it with chutney, molaga podi or sambar.

She also claimed that performing havan using cowdung will keep a particular area sanitised for 12 hours.Mixing ghee made out of cow milk with rice on a cowdung cake to perform havan at sunset and sunrise will help keep the place sanitized, she said.Calling it science, she said that her suggestion might appear strange to people but it was not imaginary.On Tuesday, the minister however maintained that the government is putting its best effort to handle the third wave.",MP minister Usha Thakur does an encore: Perform yagya to ward off third wave of Covid-19,RICE

From school teachers to home-makers, all have taken up cultivating vegetables and fruits, rice, and fish over the past more than 12 months.One such group is a set of lawyers, under the aegis of All India Lawyers Union, Ernakulam district committee, who have come out with flying colours in an attempt to cultivate paddy in 5.5 acres in Kadungalloor panchayat in Ernakulam.P.R. Ragesh, member of the district committee of the union, said more than 50 members, enthusiastic about farming, contributed 2,000 each to see through the initial expenses of the cultivation.The plot was taken up with the help of the local paddy collective (Paadashekhara Samiti), which extended all help. Mr. Ragesh said there was no hesitancy on the part of the lawyers collective, who wanted to do something positive during the pandemic times. The experiment has been a great success, said M.P. Udayan of Mundakkali Paadashekharam (polder) at Kadungalloor, who looks after the day-to-day affairs of the paddy cultivation.He said the harvest fest was organised recently.Mr. Ragesh said the idea of rice cultivation initially came from members of the Lawyers Union taking up vegetable cultivation in their backyards or terraces of their homes after the lockdown was announced in March last year. Vegetable cultivation was a grand success.The Uma variety of seed was selected for the project, and Mr. Udayan feels that around six tonnes of paddy could be obtained from the fields, now waiting to be harvested. Efforts are on to extend paddy cultivation to the new season, he said. Kadungalloor has a large extent of paddy fields, and cultivation can easily be extended, he added.",When lawyers took up the plough,RICE

The number of vessels calling has also fallen in the last 10-15 days, as the owners are hesitant to load cargo from India.Indias agricultural exports grew 17.5 per cent to cross $41.8 billion in 2020-21. This came even as the countrys overall merchandise exports fell 7.2 per cent to $290.8 billion from $313.4 billion in 2019-20.The farm sectors standout export performance, the best since the $43.25 billion of 2013-14, was thanks to a good monsoon, agriculture production being relatively unaffected by the Covid-19-induced lockdown, and surging global commodity prices. It was also in line with GDP numbers: agricultural growth for 2020-21 is estimated to be 3 per cent, even as the economy as a whole contracted by 6.5 per cent.Whether the same story can be repeated this year, however, remains to be seen: The Met Department has forecast a normal southwest monsoon, and the UN Food and Agriculture Organisations (FAOs) world food price index hit an 83-month high in April. But the pandemics spread to the rural hinterland  unlike last year, when cases were predominantly reported from urban centres  could impact shipments from India, at least temporarily.Many ports are already reporting a substantial decline in daily labour attendance for loading/unloading activity.

Vizag port has restricted labour working time to 6 am to 11 am.Last years agri-export boom was led by non-basmati rice, with a record 13.09 million tonnes (mt) valued at $4.80 billion going out of the country. Together with 4.63 mt of basmati  again a record  worth $4.02 billion, it consolidated Indias position as the worlds biggest rice exporter.Explained Pandemic uncertainty Farm exports zoomed last year even as overall merchandise exports fell. This year, the monsoon is expected to be normal, and global food prices are high. But the pandemic has entered deep into the countryside, and could end up hitting shipments from India, at least temporarily.There could be some setback due to the current disruptions. But exports should do well this year as well, because of high international prices and our rice being the most competitive, said Nitin Gupta, Vice President at Olam Agro India Ltd.White rice with 25% broken grains is now being offered from India at about $360 per tonne, lower than the $470 from Vietnam and $490 from Thailand. Indian parboiled rice with 5% brokens, too, is quoting at $370 per tonne, compared to $440 from Pakistan.It isnt just rice.

Desperate pleas for oxygen, medicines and vaccination slots have become dominant everyday conversations. Amid this raging chaos, while the role of healthcare industry intensifies, it is the non-profit sector that has as always stepped up, providing relief material and ration for scores of families affected by COVID- 19.And one such NGO doing their part is Aranya Foundation that recently started a free service to deliver fresh meals at the doorstep of COVID-19 patients. When health is compromised, even the simpler things in life a good meal, for example is a stressful task, be it for a homemaker and their family or someone living alone. Shilpam Kapur Rathore, founder of Aranya Foundation, witnessed this firsthand when the virus kept her friend confined to the bed. She had to quarantine in a room in her house. Thats when I realised that many are affected by the lack of a homemakers presence in the kitchen.They end up ordering in food, which may not necessarily aid in recovery and healing. It is a fifteen- day struggle. Since the foundation has experience in providing nutritious, healthy, simple meals, we thought well start this for COVID-19 patients free of cost, shares Shilpam. With this intent, through her Foundation, Shilpam is providing 2,000 meals a day to the patients and their families in Kilpauk, Anna Nagar, Nungambakkam, Mylapore and Adyar.Patients can contact their helpline handled by four professionals one day in advance and place the order. Simple, healthy food like sambar and rice, variety rice with pickle, or tomato rice prepared by 18 people at the Radha Soami Satsang Beas, is packed in a disposable container and delivered to customers via Delhivery. The raw materials for the meals are funded by the donations received by the Foundation. On May 11, their first day of the initiative, the Foundation received requests for 1,500 meals.Besides following the hygiene protocols, offering fresh food is a non-negotiable for Shilpam. All the kitchen workers are equipped with hairnets, masks, and gloves, and have taken the RT-PCR test. This is the Foundations second initiative during the pandemic. Last year, at the time of the lockdown, they aided citybased class 11 student, Arnav Rathore, in providing a weeks worth of dry ration to the homes of 800 senior citizens free of cost. They also distributed over 20,000 meals to migrant workers in Chennai with the help of Radha Soami Satsang Beas.Their work has no borders. With Delhi gasping for breath owing to the dearth of oxygen cylinders, the Foundation organised a bus with 10 oxygen concentrators for the North Delhi Municipal Corporation. I feel all of us have the power to make a change. When I started out on my mission of Annandhanam in 2015, I just made one meal for one woman on the streets. Then she said there are so many like her. I made 20 and then realised there are 100. Its a moment that sparks a movement, says Shilpam. Amen to that!To order, call 42997501. RTPCR results must be provided.

Srinivasmurthy, a rice conservator and progressive farmer from T. Narsipur, said it was a common practice to hire workers from adjoining villages for farm work.But now workers are increasingly reluctant to move out of their villages in search of employment. What is equally true is that local residents in villages are objecting to presence of workers from other places due to the fear of the pandemic, he added.A vast swathe of land under paddy cultivated in early summer is ready for harvesting and many farmers are keen to hire paddy harvesting machines to tide over labour crisis arising out of the pandemic, said Mr. Srinivasmurthy.A section of the officials argued that there were similar fear even last year that agriculture would take a hit because of the COVID-19 outbreak but instead what was witnessed was record sowing and harvest.However, Mr. Shanthakumar pointed out that the first wave left the rural hinterland unscathed last year but the situation was different in the present times.People in villages are hiding illness to avoid testing and isolation and there are scores who have tested positive but are forced to remain in villages as there are no beds in hospital which is worsening the situation, said Mr. Shanthakumar.Though authorities have played down the negative fallout of the pandemic on agricultural activity, emerging trends indicate that the long-term impact of the pandemic will be felt in due course.In Mysuru district there were 16,026 active COVID-19 cases as on Thursday of which 10,104 are in the city. The rest are spread across the taluks.In Mandya district, which is predominantly agrarian in character, there are 8,240 active cases as on Thursday. This includes 1,159 in Malavalli tauk, 1245 in Maddur taluk, 718 in Pandavapura, 760 in Srirangapatna, 583 in K.R.Pet, and 835 in Nagamangala. Mandya taluk alone has 2,852 active cases underlining the seriousness of the crisis.

(File)The Punjab government, anticipating a shortage of migrant labour in the upcoming paddy transplantation season, has decided to bring one million hectares under the Direct Seeding of Rice (DSR) technique for the crop this year.Punjab farmers had planted paddy using the DSR technique, instead of traditional transplanting, in the kharif season last year too in around 5 lakh hectares of land.Direct seeding is a method under which pre-germinated seeds are directly drilled into the field by a tractor-powered machine.There is no nursery preparation or transplantation involved in this method. Farmers have to only level their land and give one pre-sowing irrigation.The government has also requested the Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) to make the arrangements in power supply schedule for consumers using agricultural pump sets during the forthcoming paddy season.In a letter dated May 13 and addressed to chairman-cum-managing director of PSPCL, the Additional Chief Secretary (Development) of Punjab, Anirudh Tewari, requested CMD PSPCL, A Venu Prasad, to make necessary arrangements to ensure eight hours of power supply from May 25 to June 2, four-hour power supply from June 3 to June 9 and again eight hour power supply from June 10 onwards for all agricultural consumers.The letter further says that the department is promoting DSR during kharif season this year to conserve 10 to 15 per cent irrigation water as compared to the puddle transplanted rice. The department, the letter added, targets to bring an area of one million hectares (10 Lakh hectares ) under DSR during the forthcoming season.The letter also says that Punjab Agriculture University (PAU), Ludhiana, has also recommended the DSR technique in the state, with effect from June 1 in tar wattar conditions  that is in fields that have high moisture content without any additional expenditure, which actually results in saving groundwater and therefore reduced power consumption.Dr Balwinder Singh Sidhu, Agriculture Commissioner of Punjab, said that committing one million hectares was a major policy decision and the promotion of DSR will lead to conservation of groundwater and save farmers from labour shortage. He further said that 1017 camps have been organised in a cluster of five villages each across the paddy transplanting districts of the state to train and educate the farmers in the DSR technique.He said that the official date of paddy transplanting is June 10 and it will be followed strictly.Farmers of the Punjab on the other hand, however, have demanded that the government not fix any date for paddy transplanting this year because of the ongoing Covid pandemic and shortage of labour. They say that around 2.7 to 2.8 million hectares is already dedicated to rice cultivation and this requires a large number of labourers.Jagmohan Singh, General Secretary Bharti Kisan Union (BKU), Daukunda, said that this time they would be mostly dependent on the local khet mazdoors for paddy transplanting and if the power supply to tube-wells is given before June 1, then farmers can even start transplantation at their own levelHe said that a fixed date to start the cultivation of paddy will lead to big gatherings in the fields which might lead to the spread of Covid among the farmers.Singh also said that the DSR method is not suitable on certain types of soil and in such fields only transplanting methods work.He said that if the government does not agree to their demands, then the farmers will be forced to start an agitation.",Punjab targets to bring one million hectare under DSR in this paddy season,RICE

(PTI)Scenes from the 2020 nationwide shutdown are replaying outside government schools across Delhi as daily wagers stand in line to pick up their meals. With the lockdown extended for the fourth time since April 19 amid the Covid surge in the capital, several workers say they are left with no job and no money.In an order dated April 20, the Delhi government said a committee of officers is to be constituted to ensure welfare of daily wagers and migrant workers. The committee is tasked with ensuring that food, water, shelter, clothing and medication are made available to workers.Also Read | Covid-19 second wave: Heres a list of states that have imposed full lockdownThose at construction sites are to be provided with food, shelter and other medications, too. For the purpose of providing food, the contractors providing mid-day meals to school children in government and MCD schools, should be utilised, stated the order.The Supreme Court too on Thursday ordered a series of steps for workers welfare  from transport to home districts and food to dry ration without insisting on identity cards.At Sarvodaya Bal Vidyalaya in Rajgarh Colony on Friday, 50 people lined up at 12.30 pm to pick up their lunch comprising rice and curry. Among them was Vijay Kumar (20), who reaches the school every day with two containers and collects a meal for one  even though there are three to feed at home.Kumar, who used to work at a cloth factory in Gandhinagar before the lockdown, said, My parents are dependent on me financially. I used to earn Rs 6,000 before the factory shut. We still have to pay Rs 4,000 for rent. Sometimes, school authorities give extra food and I take it. Otherwise, we manage somehow by borrowing from others.Two classroom desks had been set up inside the school, one for the rice and the other for curry. School staff served the food while guards ensured social distancing was maintained. Civil defence volunteers, who have been assigned vaccination duty, lent a hand as there was no vaccination on Friday. Staff said the food is the same as mid-day meals that used to be served to students, and that it comes from the district magistrates office.By the time Rajkumar (60) arrived, the rice was over and he only got curry. He used to drive an e-rickshaw in the area before the lockdown. I lost my wife many years ago I have three sons who live separately now. They have families to take care of so they do not help me financially. He visits the school twice a day for meals.Ranjeet Singh (56) used to work at a government office as a driver but lost his job in January, and the lockdown only exacerbated his problems. He said, It takes two-three months to find a new job. In the lockdown, it is even more difficult. His wife goes to Gurdwara Sis Ganj for sangat in the mornings and gets langar food from there, while he comes to the school to pick up meals.After serving food to around 300 people, school staffer Bijender broke for lunch. He said he would go to his home in Seelampur, eat, and come back for the evening session when dinner is served at 5.30 pm. There is no fixed timing but the school staff pack up after all the food is over. People do not need to show any ID proof to collect food.School staff said fewer schools are giving out food as most schools  186 at the moment  are functioning as vaccination centres.At Sarvodaya Bal Vidyalaya in East Delhis Gandhi Nagar, which is undergoing construction work, Kalawati and her husband said they get their meals every day from here. The couple and their four children stay in a temporary shed in the school. Unlike last year, when they had attempted to head to their hometown in Madhya Pradesh, they decided to stay in the construction site as they had all the amenities they needed.Kalawati said, As soon as the lockdown was announced last year, and we heard that work will stop, we left for home on foot. Police stopped us near Ghaziabad and took us to a shelter home in a school, where we were stuck for two months.This lockdown, however, construction work is permitted if workers are living on the site. The family gets both their meals from the school. Out of 30 workers at the site, around 25 went home this year. Workers get a daily wage of Rs 350 each.School staff said a truck carrying cooked food comes in from the Shahdara district office twice a day and is enough to feed 300 people.A district authority said, A few schools had been identified across the city. Since the crisis is not as severe as last year, the schools identified were in pockets where there are many migrant workers and a few in-situ construction sites. There would be approximately 170 such sites.","In food lines at Delhi government schools, a 2020 redux",RICE

And true to these words, every morning, her posts of kolam and the accompanying caption seem to bring brightness - especially in the current pall of gloom - in the lives of her followers.""We are surrounded by negativity and fear. The first thing I began to change is when I wake up, I thank god that I am safe and alive. With that positivity, you just have to think of some good ways of spreading good vibes,"" begins the Mumbai-based kolam artist, who seeks solace in patterned white lines.Making an expressionGrowing up in a south Indian household, Hema was introduced to the art of kolam at a young age. But it was only in 2014 that she picked up the practice, again. ""I had a fantastic guru in Rangam Balaji aunty, a family friend. She used to read my kolam. As much as I tried to explain, it was she who told me that I am telling stories through my designs. I then realised that my kolams are a mix of Amar Chitra Katha-kind of illustrations and 3D images. I often leave it to the viewer to interpret the story. When viewers also participate in the kolam-making process, it becomes fun for me,"" she expains.But it was the pandemic and consequent lockdowns in 2020 that made her kolams a source of peace for her followers. ""A lot of people say that it gives them energy in the morning when they see my kolam, so I began to tap into that. Being at home, people are feeling the stress of the lockdown and maybe claustrophobic even. How do you take that negative energy out? This was the best form to do so. I did some exercises where I told followers to twin kolams with me or play a game of kolam or kolam antakshari. Thats how I started connecting with people. Now, I also conduct online workshops,"" she details.Kolams have an innate quality to drift you from unpleasant thoughts and allow you to focus on just the act of drawing a kolam, she believes. ""In these difficult times, you may not be moving around much, but your mind is constantly moving. So this is an activity to bring your mind to focus on one point. It has made a difference in a lot of people. I talk to every one of my students, help them with their issues to get through their difficulties by bringing in that concentration,"" explains Hema.Life lessons in patterns""Doesnt it break your heart to erase the intricate kolam?"" she's often asked. Her response is filled with sage words. ""The art of letting go thats my biggest takeaway. I make these big kolams for three-four hours. It is a lot of activity, a lot of meditation,"" she says.""But in a couple of days, I have to erase it to make way for a new kolam. Isn't that what life is? Unless you destroy or remove something, how will you create something new? This is a cycle of recreation. It was easy for me to let go of these patterns. And now, when someone says rude or unpleasant things, I can easily let it go. When I cannot hold on to my art something I create why should I hold on to something that is created by somebody else?"" she offers.Besides instilling the virtue of patience in Hema, kolams have given her a reason to celebrate life. A spontaneous artist, Hema starts with a pattern and amplifies the design, going with the flow of how her inner voice guides her.She is often seen making traditional Tamil kolams like chikku kolam, padi kolam or dot line kolam that involve white lines. It is during special occasions that her kolam-making skills seem to bloom. Take her Navaratri series, for instance. Each day, her kolams celebrate the Goddess in different avatars.""Navaratri faces came very spontaneously and I never planned a single face for that particular day. That's some divine energy and I won't even take credit for those faces; She wanted to manifest that way and she did,"" shares Hema humbly.The deities she draws often do not have a face, as she believes ""each one of us have our own interpretation of how the divine is for us"". ""I'd like them to see what they want to see rather than ask them to see what I want them to see. So I leave a sense of mystery behind which the divine actually is,"" she believes.Kolams were encouraged by our grandparents, as it was said to be the food for insects and microorganisms on the ground since the patterns are made using rice flour. It was also seen as a religious expression. But Hema urges people to look at it as an art that can help one mentally, physically and emotionally.""The energy that comes from drawing these geometrical patterns cannot be measured. It is priceless. When one finishes a kolam, they should feel energised and not tired. Learning the techniques and postures will help with that. I want to make kolam contemporary for this generation so that they dont write it off as something conventional,"" she points out.Hema wishes to take her gift of kolam-making one step further by making it a weekly exercise in schools. ""Before the pandemic set in, I wanted to visit local schools and ask them to give me an opportunity to teach the art to students, which can also help them in their studies. But I have taken a step back owing to the pandemic. I am also trying to learn how it can help persons with disabilities and mental health issues.

2021-05-15,https://indianexpress.com/article/world/joe-biden-president-profile-7315910/,"The White House on Monday said it is ""closely monitoring"" the violence in Israel.Written by Michael D. Shear, Katie Rogers and Annie KarniThe commander-in-chief was taking his time, as usual.It was late March, and President Joe Biden was under increasing pressure to penalize President Vladimir Putin of Russia for election interference and the biggest cyberattack ever on US government and industry. I have to do it relatively soon, he said to Jake Sullivan, his national security adviser.Biden had already spent the first two months of his presidency debating how to respond to Putin, and despite his acknowledgment in March that he needed to act quickly, his deliberations were far from over. He convened another meeting in the Situation Room that stretched for 2 1/2 hours, and called yet another session there a week later.He has a kind of mantra: You can never give me too much detail, Sullivan said.Quick decision-making is not Bidens style. His reputation as a plain-speaking politician hides a more complicated truth. Before making up his mind, the president demands hours of detail-laden debate from scores of policy experts, taking everyone around him on what some in the West Wing refer to as his Socratic journey before arriving at a conclusion.Those trips are often difficult for his advisers, who are peppered with sometimes obscure questions. Avoiding Bidens ire during one of his decision-making seminars means not only going beyond the vague talking points that he will reject, but also steering clear of responses laced with acronyms or too much policy minutiae, which will prompt an outburst of frustration, often laced with profanity.Lets talk plain English here, he will often snap.Interviews with more than two dozen current and former Biden associates provide an early look into how Biden operates as president  how he deliberates, whom he consults for advice and what drives his decisions as he settles into the office he has chased for more than three decades.What emerges is a portrait of a president with a short fuse, who is obsessed with getting the details right  sometimes to a fault, including when he angered allies and adversaries alike by repeatedly delaying a decision on whether to allow more refugees into the United States.On policy issues, Biden, 78, takes days or weeks to make up his mind as he examines and second-guesses himself and others. It is a method of governing that can feel at odds with the urgency of a country still reeling from a pandemic and an economy struggling to recover. The president is also faced with a slim majority in Congress that could evaporate next year, giving him only months to enact a lasting legacy.Biden signs executive actions in the Oval Office on Jan. 28, 2021, as Vice President Kamala Harris looks on. (Doug Mills/The New York Times) Biden signs executive actions in the Oval Office on Jan. 28, 2021, as Vice President Kamala Harris looks on. (Doug Mills/The New York Times)Those closest to him say Biden is unwilling, or unable, to skip the routine. As a longtime adviser put it: He needs time to process the material so that he feels comfortable selling it to the public. But the approach has its risks, as President Barack Obama found out when his own, sometimes lengthy policy debates led to infighting and extended lobbying, and made his White House feel process driven.Biden could fall victim to the same fate, though he has far more experience governing than Obama did in 2009. So far, the Biden administration has moved quickly to confront the nations challenges even as Bidens own deliberations can linger, often prompting calls as late as 10:30 or 11 p.m. as he gets ready for the next morning.Quick temperThe president arrives in the Oval Office for a series of scheduled meetings around 9:30 a.m., after exercising and making the short stroll from the residence, often flanked by his German shepherds, Champ and Major.In March, as the decision loomed to impose sanctions on Russia for its election interference and its SolarWinds cyberattack, Biden was true to form, repeatedly insisting on hearing directly from his experts.At one point, Biden lectured a group of veteran Foreign Service officers and policy advisers on the nuances of Putins personality and tried to channel the Russian leaders thinking. His conclusion: Putin wants his rivals to be blunt with him.In the end, Biden called Putin directly and then delivered a public statement on Russia sanctions that lasted only five minutes and 49 seconds. For as much as Biden projects an aura of ease  with his frequent backslapping, references to Irish poetry and liberal use of the phrase cmon, man  his aides say it takes a lot of behind-the-scenes work to prepare him to project an assured demeanor.Biden is gripped by a sense of urgency that leaves him prone to flares of impatience, according to numerous people who regularly interact with him. The president has said he expects to run for a second term, but aides say he understands the effect on his ability to advance his agenda if Republicans regain power in Congress next year.He never erupts into fits of rage the way President Donald Trump did. And the current president rarely exhibits the smoldering anger or sense of deep disappointment that advisers to Obama became familiar with.But several people familiar with the presidents decision-making style said Biden was quick to cut off conversations. Three people who work closely with him said he even occasionally hangs up the phone on someone who he thinks is wasting his time. Most described Biden as having little patience for advisers who cannot field his many questions.You become so hyperprepared, said Dylan Loewe, a former speechwriter for Biden.

Kirkpatrick/The New York Times) Biden and Harris speak with reporters at the start of a meeting with a group of republican senators in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington on May 13, 2021. (T.J. Kirkpatrick/The New York Times)Earlier in March, the presidents top immigration advisers gathered to brief him on the growing problems at the southwestern border, where thousands of children from Central America were crossing without adults. After a drawn-out conversation, Biden asked members of the group whether any of them had been to the border in recent days.He was met with silence, which prompted the predictable reaction: frustration. Four days later, the advisers  including the secretary of homeland security, Alejandro N. Mayorkas, and Susan Rice, the director of Bidens Domestic Policy Council  arrived at the border to assess the situation.I want the detailsAs a senator for 36 years and as vice president for eight years, Biden has assembled a tight circle of friends, family and advisers from which he draws personal support and counsel.In addition to his wife, Jill Biden, their grandchildren  described as the center of the first couples world  are often at the White House, spending long weekends or parts of their week there. They have been known to show their grandfather apps like TikTok. One adviser said he had sent the grandchildren money using Venmo.For political advice and policy direction, he turns to the group one White House aide called the Biden historians  Ron Klain, the chief of staff and longtime aide; Bruce Reed, a top policy adviser who sometimes ran his vice presidents office; Mike Donilon, his political counselor and alter-ego; and Steve Ricchetti, his legislative guru and longtime friend.Outside of that core group, Biden draws on a sprawling constellation of the administrations in-house experts, including, among others, Rice and Brian Deese, the director of the National Economic Council.On a Zoom call on a Sunday in December, Biden, then president-elect, asked for a debate about the wisdom of deploying active-duty troops to battle the pandemic. He had long said his aides should consider themselves on a wartime footing against the virus. But exactly what did that mean?He grilled his newly appointed coronavirus task force adviser, Jeffrey Zients, with questions: How would Americans react to active-duty personnel being deployed onto the streets? Had anything like it been done before? How big was the scale of the effort, and how fast could it be scaled up?Biden did not want to be spared any incremental detail. After the president took office, his defense secretary deployed 1,100 troops in five teams of nurses, vaccinators and other medical staff. He eventually deployed 4,000 more.On Jan. 21, Bidens first full day in office, he met with his coronavirus team again, including Dr. Anthony Fauci and Dr. Rochelle Walensky, in the State Room, where the group presented him with what it called the comprehensive plan.After the meeting, he pulled Zients aside and gave him a set of instructions: Bring me the news, good, bad and ugly.

The distribution will start from Saturday as Friday was a holiday due to Eid.Food and civil supplies minister Imran Hussain, who reviewed the distribution of free ration under both programmes for May and June , said the Delhi cabinet had decided to provide free ration in larger public interest during the lockdown. Officials have been asked to ensure a smooth, convenient and transparent distribution and adoption of the Covid-appropriate behaviour at the shops.In Delhi, the PDS beneficiaries are provided with 5kg foodgrain every month under regular entitlement  4kg wheat and 1kg rice  while those under AAY category are given 25kg wheat, 10kg rice and 1kg sugar per household. Under normal circumstances, they are charged Rs 2 per kg for wheat, Rs 3 per kg for rice and Rs 13.50 per kg for sugar, but all items will be free for May and June.Hussain said fair price shops would be open on all seven days from 9am to 1pm and from 3pm to 7pm. In case beneficiaries face any problem in receiving the ration, they may complain on helpline 1967 and other grievance redressal portals, including PGMS, and contact food department officials. Local MLAs will also inspect fair price shops from time to time to motivate the staff and ensure smooth ration distribution.The distribution will be done manually except for in the Seemapuri circle where it will be made through e-PoS devices on biometric authentication. In an order issued by the food department, senior officials have been asked to carry out random inspections to ensure proper distribution of the specified foodgrains.Delhi Sarkari Ration Dealers Sanghs secretary, Saurabh Gupta, demanded that the distribution under both programmes should start at the same time to limit exposure and the dealers should be considered frontline workers. The beneficiaries will have to travel to the ration shops twice, which will expose them to Covid. Over 15 fair price shop dealers have died in Covid so far, said Shailendra Kumar, president of Public Distribution System Welfare Association.","Covid relief: Free ration for cardholders for May, June",RICE

Here is a whirlwind tour of three home kitchens in ChennaiGrateful for the timely help she received, Samika Javare is offering just that kind of help to others.Resident of a working womens hostel in Thoraipakkam, Samika Javare provides free breakfast to COVID-19 positive people, doing this charity along with her friend and hostel-mate Arpitha Sankar.When my parents (residents of Bengaluru) were down with COVID-19, I found someone who would supply them with food for 10 days. She refused to take any money for it. Inspired, I have started offering COVID-19 patients free breakfast. Arpitha and I do this service together, says 26-year-old Samika, employed at a manufacturing company on Old Mahabalipuram Road. We are not good at cooking, and so we constantly check out YouTube videos. We generally make idli, rice dosa, kambu dosa, pesarattu dosa and pudina parathas; and also, beetroot juice and spinach soup. We start cooking by 5 a.m. and ensure the food is delivered by 9 a.m, says 27-year-old Arpitha Sankar, a soft-skills trainer whose home town is in Coimbatore. Their initiative is financially supported by their relatives, friends and colleagues.In fact, I returned from Coimbatore this April to vacate the hostel, as I have found a new job in Bengaluru, though I will be working from my home in Coimbatore. As many of our well-wishers trusted us and have made donations towards this cause, I am staying back and continuing with this service for some more time. We are reaching out to COVID-19 positive people on OMR, with the first priority being senior citizens living alone and also the underprivileged. For these people, we do away with the delivery charges. We now cater to nearly 70 patients every day. says Arpitha. The duo can be reached via WhatsApp on 93454 01353.Blessing is the rewardFor a couple of weeks, Latha Dubey is sending food to a septuagenarian in Ambattur who has COVID-19. He had found Lathas phone number and called her.Latha recalls how anguished he was when he called her for the first time and requested for home food. Without a family member around to take care of him, he is on his own. Latha offers him the food free, doing away with the delivery charges as well.Latha, a homemaker, considers the generous blessing he receives from this senior as compensation.He considers me his daughter, she says.Latha cooks and sends vegetarian food  lunch and dinner  to around 70 seniors who are recovering from COVID-19.I mainly make rasam sadham, which is said to help when someone has cough and generates phlegm. I prepare different types of rasam: milagu rasam, jeeraga rasam, poondu rasam, kollu rasam and inji rasam. It is accompanied by an easy-to-digest vegetable poriyal. On certain days, instead of rasam, I provide sambar or keerai kootu. Dinner conists of phulkas and dal fry or adai and thuvaiyal, says Latha, who is 54-years-old.My posts about this initative on Facebook have drawn calls from various parts of the world, including United States, United Kingdom, Spain, Singapore and Malaysia, from children of elderly parents living alone in Chennai, she says.As a precautionary measure, she wears a mask while cooking. She also spares a thought for the delivery persons.I offer water or juice to the delivery boys when they come to collect the food packets. I caution them that the delivery is meant for a COVID-19 patient and hence they should maintain a no-contact delivery, says Latha.Inspired by her initiative, two of her friends have started the same service for COVID-19 patients.My friends Suresh P Jumani from Egmore and Anisha Chugh from Harrington Road are now cooking food and providing it for free to COVID-19 positive people, she says, adding that the group is much wider.

I was inspired by a person (in Instagram) who was providing food to COVID 19 patients. Hence this initiative. It is two weeks since we started this service, and the response is overwhelming. At present, we reach out to 25 COVID-19 patients in Thiruvanmiyur, Kottivakkam and Palavakkam, to whom we provide lunch and dinner.

The order issued by the Delhi government on 14th May on distribution of food under the National Food Security Act also makes no mention of non-ration card holders. Given that the majority of those who called us are temporary migrants, it is unlikely that they possess a Delhi government ration card. In the absence of government interventions to address rising distress amongst workers in the city, the civil society has had to step in. However, with limited resources and reach, this is a drop in the ocean.A senior official from the Delhi government, while explaining the delay of the distribution of ration, said, The grains came in from the Food Corporation of India now under the NFSA and the PMGKAY. The distribution has started today (Saturday).On May 7, the Delhi Rozi Roti Adhikar Abhiyan also wrote to Kejriwal over unavailability of ration for both card and non-card holders in Delhi. We have visited nearly 70 ration shops located across the capital and we are shocked to note that despite the first week of May coming to an end, ration distribution for the month has not started. This is alarming as Delhi is in the third week of lockdown. Those who have lost their livelihood are dependent on foodgrains provided under the PDS to feed themselves and their families. Owing to the delay, people are being forced to buy foodgrains from the open market at non-subsidized prices.It was only on Friday, May 14, that the Delhi government passed a directive for distribution of free ration under the NFSA and the PMGKAY for the month of May and June, even as Kejriwal had said on the eve of the announcement of the first lockdown in April that migrant workers need not head back home.The order read: The entitled foodgrains under NFSA for the month of May 2021 will be provided free of cost to all the entitled PDS beneficiaries @ 04 kgs of wheat and 01 kg of rice per beneficiary per month of PR and PRS card holders and 25 kg of wheat and 10 kg of rice and 01 sugar per households to AAY card holders. In addition to the above entitlement for the month of May 2020 under PMGKAY-III, 05 kg of additional foodgrains i.e. 04 kg of wheat and 01 kg of rice per beneficiary member will also be distributed free of cost to all PDS beneficiaries (PR, PRS and AAY).Anjali Bharadwaj, a social activist for the SNS and associated with the Right to Food campaign in Delhi, said, As per the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Ann Yojana, as well as Delhi governments promises, a ration card holder in Delhi is entitled to 10 kg of grain under PDS for May and June 2021, free of cost. For the 72 lakh ration card holders, this is a big lifeline. However, it was only on Friday, weeks into the lockdown, that the Delhi government gave orders for the distribution of it. This had not been happening at all. Today, we will monitor the ration shops to see if they are being distributed.On May 13, the Supreme Court of India directed the governments of Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana to file a reply to the application suggesting means and measures by which they shall ameliorate miseries of stranded migrant labourers, and to provide dry ration, adequate transport and set up community kitchens for them in National Capital Region.Bharadwaj said that those without any ration card must also be included. Migrant workers were covered last year through the e-coupon scheme. The High Court had ruled that no one should be left out and everyone must be given ration even if they do not have cards, Bharadwaj added.",NGOs in Delhi write to Arvind Kejriwal over unavailability of foodgrains at ration shops,RICE

It has also been a year of working from home, cooking from home and fewer trips to buy groceries and essentials. For Indians in the US, this often meant scarcity of ethnic food items, groceries and the comfort of home-cooked desi meals.But despite the challenges, a few Indian American entrepreneurs have been working tirelessly behind the scenes to keep the supplies of desi food items, groceries, condiments and spices going without any snags. And now, as India grapples with the crisis of the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, some of them are also stepping up to support their country of origin via their desi networks. Oakland-based Sana Javeri Kadri is an example.In 2017, after working in the food industry for a decade, Mumbai-born Kadri launchedwhen she realised there was an opportunity to introduce the ""incredible flavour and aroma"" of the Indian-grown turmeric she grew up with to America. Selling products mainly via the company website as well as through retail and restaurant locations, her venture is not only to showcase the quality and flavour of single-estate spices grown on family farms, but to create a more equitable spice trade by working directly with the farmers and paying them fairly.After launching the heirloomin 2017,currently works with 150 farm-partners and pays its farmers, on average, six times above the commodity price. ""People were definitely craving familiar flavours in the past year in America and there was a demand from Indian Americans for Indian spices ,"" Kadri said. ""But I also think that, in a broader sense, everyone in lockdown was forced to cook more at home. People were more willing to experiment with new flavours and spices that theyd never tried before.""Last year, the challenge was sourcing spices from India as the country was under a nationwide lockdown. ""We decided to pivot to a pre-sale model so that we could help our farm-partners in India stay in business. Once we put the call out to our community about pre-orders, it actually became a huge success, the entrepreneur recollects.raised $120,000 in a matter of days and made 100 per cent advances on all spice harvests by mid-April. Customers were willing to wait, sometimes for several months, for their spices. This year, the company has used the same pre-order model to raise $420,000 and pay it forward in advances to farm-partners in India.Kadri, who was on a three-month-long sourcing trip across India just before the second wave of the pandemic struck, has paid big harvest advances to over 30 of her farm partners. Now, as an anxious daughter, she speaks to her parents -- who are based in Mumbai -- twice a day, but as a business owner in the US, she has mobilised over $345000 from her community of customers for a Covid-19 relief fund in the subcontinent and is even offering a 20% discount on spices to anyone who donates directly to a relief fund of any kind.Brooklyn-based Chitra Agrawal, whose food journey started with documenting her family's recipes from North and South India on her blog, was trying to find her identity as an Indian American through food rooted in her Indian heritage. She later became an entrepreneur along with her husband to introduce her Indian recipes to a wider audience and launched, a brand which is available across the US at grocery stores as well as via the company's website.The first products were(Indian pickles), which originated from her own recipes and used produce from her farm share. ""I've lived in San Francisco , Los Angeles and now New York City and the food I experienced in these cities has also shaped my point of view in the kitchen,"" Agrawal said. ""For instance, I purposely developed myto have the intense flavours I grew up loving but with less sodium than traditional recipes so they could be used in a variety of ways and more often in my kitchen -- not just with rice and dal but on sandwiches, with eggs, on mac and cheese, etc.""More products have been added, which include curry ketchup, curry mustard, mango chutney, Guntur Sannam hot sauce and a line of simmer sauces. ""There was a significant rise in demand for our products during the pandemic because people were cooking at home more often and were also looking for new flavours to introduce into their meals. We are continuing to face supply issues and price increases due to the pandemic,"" she added. ""For instance, a glass shipment that was expected to arrive in March, is now not arriving until October. So we have had to scramble on many occasions to find alternative sources of materials in order to continue fulfilling orders.""Agrawal is donating 50% of online sales atto GiveIndia for the month of May. The donation specifically will go towards distributing meals to families struggling with hunger during the second wave of Covid-19 in India., an e-commerce grocery delivery service across America for South Asian food, is leveraging its network of the large Indian American community to run panel discussions and Q&A sessions with experts on the Covid-19 pandemic for desis in the US and their family members back in India. ""The current crisis has been devastating to watch as it has unfolded in India. I have lost members of my extended family and Subziwalla team members as well,"" said Sajal Rohatgi, one of the co-founders of the service. ""I grew up in Delhi and I still have a good network for friends and family back home. I am in touch with them and helping them get leads for hospital beds and oxygen cylinders.""Rohatgi has personally donated money to some organisations in India and launched a fundraiser with a $50,000 target to help members of the Subziwalla team and their families based in the subcontinent who are suffering from Covid-19. The e-commerce platform, which was launched in 2018, grew exponentially because of the pandemic-related restrictions in the US last year.""We have built a reputation of being a trusted source to access Indian groceries. During the pandemic, when other sites and stores were price gouging, we were concentrating on serving our customers and community. There was definitely an issue with the supplies coming from India, but we were transparent with our communication. We continue to see growth as the US moves towards opening the economy,"" he said. In 2020, at the height of the pandemic in the US, the company launched, a line of homestyle breads and meals, in response to the need for healthy heat-and-eat items, .Meanwhile, Anas Gandhi -- founder and president ofin Skokie, Illinois -- also saw a huge rise in demand in the April-June 2020 window for traditional food and spices from the Indian American community. The demand was fueled by the uncertainty and fear caused by the pandemic along with an awareness among the mainstream market about health benefits of various traditional Indian spices.""The current crisis in India has definitely had an impact on us. Members of extended family and our business suppliers have been affected by the virus and we are suffering from a sense of helplessness. Weve supported various charitable institutions to get oxygen cylinders and kept in contact with family and friends,"" Gandhi said. He has diversified his family business of electrical appliances to the e-commerce store for Indian spices and condiments with two brands --and, launched in 2008 by Mahalakshmi Srinivasan Iyer to sell south Indian batter in Chicago, today has a large factory and diversified products including south Indian and Gujarati snacks and sweets. There was a surge in demand for traditional products such as Murukku and Ribbon Pakoda during the pandemic last year. We saw a sudden surge in demand and it was hard to keep up to it. But with time, we did take necessary precautions and changed our work model to adjust to the new unexpected change,"" said Nithya Iyer, who is the niece of the founder and helps run the family business.While earlier, distribution was only through Indian grocery stores across the US,recently launched an e-commerce store to help customers buy products without having to step out of their homes.",Here's how these Indian American entrepreneurs brought desi spices to the table,RICE

Rajanarayanan -- popularly known as Ki Ra -- and a winner of Sahitya Akademi award, died in Puducherry on Monday night. He was 98.While modern Tamil literature has taken up various shapes and forms post independence, Ki Ra's entry into the literary ecosystem marked the germination of several Tamil writers from the Karisal Seemai - Land of the Black Soil- sprawling between Madurai, Tirunelveli, and Rameswaram. He did pioneering work in bringing Karisal literature to the mainstream.A popular saying goes, ""Throw a stone in Kovilpatti and it may land on the head of a writer."" This culture was one that was set forth in motion by Ki Ra.Speak to any Karisal writer alive and they fondly call him as Naina (a Telugu-Tamil word used to address father) or as Bheeshmar - a paternal and wise figure from Mahabharatham.Some writers mentored by him, including Poomani, Melanmai Ponnusamy and Cho Dharman, went on to win the Sahitya Akademi award themselves. Popular Tamil writer Konangi said that over two dozen writers were handheld into the Karisal Seemai's literary landscape by Ki Ra.""Ki Ra's house was my only library for a very long time,"" says Cho Dharman, speaking to Express. He said that every time his contemporaries or he visited Ki Ra, they would be sent back with a handful of books. ""We were about 15-20 educated but unemployed youngsters who had no mentors to tell us what to do next,"" said Dharman. Whenever, one of them published anything, a letter from Ki Ra would follow suit, he said, adding that even when they don't write for while they would get a letter saying, ""I haven't read any of your work in a while.

""One day we witnessed an accident on the road and the man at fault blamed the victim for the accident.Ki Ra, butted his way into the brawl and called his bluff,"" he said. Ki Ra was always getting youngsters aboard literary projects, Maries added. ""One day after college, when I went to see Ki Ra, he said that he was collecting words; words which were 'vattaravazhaku (dialectical style) in Karisal Tamil. He wanted us to help him index these words to publish a Karisal Dictionary - Karisal Kaatu Sollagarathi,"" he said.Ki.Ras first novel Gopallagramam is still revered as a great novel even though in the beginning it was not acknowledged by literary critics.

One of Ki Ra's last works to be published was ""Along with the Sun"" an English translation of an anthology of short stories hand-picked and edited by Ki Ra, published by the Corporation and HarperCollins.""When I handed him the copy of Along with the Sun, he told me he loved hardback books,"" said Saravanan adding in addition to his literary persona, Ki Ra was a man of many interests and passions: particularly food.

2021-05-21,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/can-the-economy-survive-the-second-covid-19-wave/article34608658.ece,"While there wont be economic contraction, growth this year will be on a slow burnerAs the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic and the State-level lockdowns batter the economy, Reserve Bank of India governor Shaktikanta Das this week noted that the impact of the second wave is likely to be less severe than the first one. He said that businesses and people have started to adapt to lockdowns and that the hit to demand would be much lower this time. In a conversation moderated by Prashanth Perumal J., Radhika Pandey and Vivek Kaul discuss the two COVID-19 waves and how they have impacted the economy. Edited excerpts:How do you see the RBI governors assessment of the current economic situation compared to last year?Radhika Pandey: The nationwide lockdown last year in response to the first wave of the pandemic resulted in a severe supply shock. What we are seeing now is not a severe supply shock but a demand shock. The second wave, because it is highly transmissible and ferocious as compared to the first wave, has created a lot of uncertainty, pessimism and loss of confidence among households and businesses. It will take time for people to start recovering because it has created a lot of uncertainty. So, thats the key difference between the first and second waves. The second wave also affects supply to some extent, but it is primarily a demand shock. Last year, what we saw was that during the first quarter, savings increased as people were not able to spend because of the lockdown. But in the second quarter, we saw that savings declined and consumption spending picked up. It is difficult to say whether that will repeat this time. So, we might not see a steep V-shaped recovery that we saw last time.Also Read Can the economy survive the second COVID-19 wave? | The Hindu Parley podcastHow do you see the impact of the second wave in terms of the magnitude of the economic slowdown?Radhika Pandey: Unlike last year, there wont be economic contraction this year. In fact, there will be positive growth, but most forecasters agencies are paring down their growth forecast because nobody anticipated the severity of the second wave. If we look at the GDP level, we wont be able to reach the pre-pandemic level this year, but as compared to last year, there will definitely be growth.Vivek Kaul: The key difference is that growth this year will essentially be on a slow burner. We will not see a contraction because last year was really bad, but growth will be extremely slow. And economists will have to keep revising their numbers. One key thing is the fact that almost all governments in India missed the second wave and they had to hurriedly put lockdowns in place. I dont see governments opening the economy up very quickly due to the fear of a third wave. Before the second wave, all economists were saying that FY 2021-22 GDP should cross the pre-pandemic 2019-20 GDP. I dont think that will happen now.Would you agree with the assessment that we are looking at a prolonged slowdown?Radhika Pandey: Yes, if you look at the U.S. and the U.K., they have already vaccinated a considerable chunk of their population, and now they are opening up. That is not happening here in India as only 3-4% of our population is fully vaccinated. Even under the most optimistic scenario, its not possible to reach the pre-pandemic GDP level this year. We may see progress on vaccination only in the initial months of 2022. Thats why the economic recovery will be a protracted affair. In terms of magnitude, the decline wont be too steep. But in terms of duration, it will take a lot of time because of all the uncertainty.Also Read RBI unveils measures for individuals, small businesses, MSMEs to deal with COVID-19 crisisVivek Kaul: A significant section of the population has spent a large amount of their savings to fight COVID-19. A lot of people have also ended up in debt. There is no agglomerated data on this, but there is enough evidence going around if you keep your eyes and ears open. These families will find it difficult to spend. Then there is this great fear of a third wave. Even if people have the money, whether they are in the psychological state to go out and spend is a question well worth asking.Does the Indian state possess the capacity to effectively deal with pandemics through vaccination, testing, etc.?Vivek Kaul: If you leave out the few southern States, much of India doesnt really have a health system. And the inequality across States is simply mind-boggling. One example that I often use is a comparison between Kerala and Jharkhand. And I do that because the population of Jharkhand is slightly more than that of Kerala. Kerala has close to 60,000-65,000 doctors while Jharkhand has around 5,000-6,000. If you go into other numbers such as the number of nurses and beds, you will realise that there is a great deal of inequality across the country. This is not something that can be set right overnight. Its not just about spending more money. There is a whole host of other supply-side issues and this obviously cannot be set right overnight.Also read | Prefer strict safety measures to partial lockdowns: India IncThere are two issues here. One is whether the Indian state has the capacity to fight the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. No, it doesnt and that has become very obvious by now. The second question is whether it has the capacity to give vaccines. The situation is not as bad on that front. The vaccination problem can be taken care of even in the short term, as long as the vaccine supply becomes available.How have the monetary and fiscal responses been this time as compared to last year?Radhika Pandey: I dont see any response, especially from the monetary side. They dont have much space given that we are seeing bouts of inflation as well as growth slowdown and we are out of the global business cycle. In advanced economies, growth is picking up and as a result, inflation is picking up as demand comes back on track. As a result, we are seeing global commodity prices surge and we are seeing the impact of that on Indias domestic inflation. Last time the RBI cut the repo rate by 115 basis points, but today it is hard for the RBI to cut interest rates because inflation is going to rise even though there is a demand slowdown. It will be mostly cost push inflation where inflation is driven by crude oil prices and input costs. What the RBI can do is incentivise banks to lend to sectors which have been hard hit. But again, it all depends on whether banks are willing to lend because if we see the credit growth over the last few months, it has not actually been picking up as banks have become risk averse. There is greater scope for fiscal policy. Apart from free foodgrains distribution as was the case last year, one can allocate more funds for MGNREGS [Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme] given that there has been an increase in the demand for work. But given that Indias debt-to-GDP ratio has risen to somewhere around 90% and there has been a collapse in revenues, the ability of the government to spend is limited.Also read | Boost testing, vaccinate those aged 18-45: FICCI urges governmentVivek Kaul: If you look at the monetary policy, it hasnt been able to do much over the last five to six years. They talk about cutting interest rates and people borrowing and all that. All that works in theory, but if you look at numbers, it doesnt work. One of the things that the RBI has been talking about is how lending to small and medium enterprises needs to go up. Now, if you look at the lending to micro and small enterprises, it has not moved and the overall lending has been the same for the last six years. This is despite offering all kinds of incentives, lower interest rates, so on and so forth. Secondly, it also tells you about the state of the small and medium enterprises in the country. They have been struggling over the years. They have faced everything from demonetisation to the Goods and Services Tax. And now the lockdown. Also, the main purpose of the bank is not to revive the Indian economy, which is why monetary policy has not worked for quite some time now.How do you see the migration of workers during the second wave when compared to the mass migration that happened during the first wave?Radhika Pandey: What we saw during the first wave was an abrupt lockdown. This time its not so. Workers this time are taking a conscious decision to go back [to their homes]; its not just an abrupt response. Thats a key difference. The other point is that as compared to the first wave, this time the rural sector has been affected much more severely. Thats visible in the employment numbers. What we see from CMIE data if we look at the April numbers is that total job loss was somewhere around 7.35 million and out of that, 2.35 million people lost jobs in the rural sector. Last time, rural employment was in a much better position as compared to urban unemployment.Also Read Demand takes big hit on second waveAlso, urban workers are moving back to their villages. That has caused the increase in unemployment and MGNREGA is not able to absorb workers, which has resulted in a huge mismatch between demand and supply. In some cases, we also find that, even though work is offered, people are not taking it up because of fear surrounding the virus.Vivek Kaul: Also, a lot of people who went back last year never really came back. That has probably also added to the unemployment pressure in the rural areas. Obviously there is no way to measure this. But I think that is another factor at play. And, as Radhika pointed that, the question is even if you increase the allocation to MGNREGA, and create more jobs, will people turn up because the chances of infection go up? This is a tricky situation. Last year we were able to spend our way out of trouble by spending to create economic activity. This time around it is a little difficult to implement.Editorial | Flashing lights: On sliding economy and cash transfersWhat should the government do to put a permanent end to the pandemic and help the economy recover fully?Radhika Pandey: There are some short-term measures to be taken and then there are some medium-term and long-term measures that are within current state capacity. One is to ramp up the supply of vaccines and ensure that more people get vaccinated. We should increase the daily pace of vaccination which has recently slowed down due to shortage. Unless that is done, the recovery will be protracted. The other thing is to seriously think about structural reforms, especially in healthcare. The pandemic has exposed the limitations of the healthcare system. There has to be some way of building medical infrastructure, which is not going to happen overnight. But there has to be careful and serious thinking.Also Read The economic fallout of COVID-19Vivek Kaul: I think the only way to prevent another lockdown is to concentrate on providing the number of vaccines that the nation needs. You have a lot of these influencers going around who have all kinds of opinions on the disease. It has to be ensured that this kind of rubbish doesnt go around. It is also important to ensure that the right messaging goes to the country. Another big fear is that even though there is huge demand for vaccines, this is largely from the cities. Once that demand is exhausted, one needs to ensure that vaccination continues. It might make sense to incentivise people who come and get vaccinated with rice and wheat or by depositing some money into their Jan Dhan account. These issues need to be thought about, and right now, nobody is thinking about them.Radhika Pandey is an economist and consultant at the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy; Vivek Kaul is a business journalist and author of Indias Big Government: The Intrusive State & How Its Hurting Us",Can the economy survive the second COVID-19 wave?,RICE

To be healthy, we need to follow basic nutrition principles because diseases have often been linked to poor diet.We need nutritious food for the bodys growth and repair work, our internal bodily functions, and to work, both physically and mentally. It also helps us build immunity  that much bandied about phrase in COVID-19 times.Eating healthy is not a weekend warrior activity, but a daily commitment that extends to a lifelong process, says Megha Jaina, clinical nutritionist at Delhis BLK-Max Super Speciality Hospital. What we eat directly impacts our quality of life, she says. We can meet the requirement of our energy levels through the day with our daily diet because the food we eat provides us with all the essential nutrientsLocal (within 100 kilometres of where you live), seasonal food eaten fresh and cooked at home, is always the best option. Jaina advocates for traditional foods that are often forgotten. Food we eat should be adaptable to our genes. What our forefathers ate should not be disturbed or replaced with alien fad diets, she says.She also adds that popping supplementary pills at will can even backfire, suppressing immunity. They should be taken only when you are immunity deficient and the dosage should be prescribed by a doctor, she says.The context of how you eat is also important. Eat mindfully, without distraction, and you will end up chewing food better, aiding in better digestion and absorption of nutrients, says Lovneet Batra, a nutritionist from Delhi. Create a meal plan that you enjoy and stick with it for the long-term while maintaining a schedule to regulate the digestive system, she says.Have: The three Gs of foodThe best way to eat is to have the Go (carbohydrates and fibres), Grow (proteins and fat) and Glow (vitamins and minerals) food groups in your meal, says Ludhiana-based dietician Garima Goyal. We are obsessed about our weight; the focus should be on being healthy and fit. From a medical condition to inactivity, everybody has a different reason for excess fat and the ailments that go with it, she says. Identifying an underlying cause of any ailment is important, to tailor the diet for balanced micro and macro nutrients.Avoid: The three Bs of foodAnything that is boxed, bottled or comes in bags is processed food, and will come with preservatives (sometimes just too much salt or sugar).The four whites to minimiseMaida (refined flour), sugar, salt, and milk products are not essential to your diet, though home-set curd is a good probiotic. If you can, cut out maida and sugar totally, and avoid milk especially if you are lactose intolerant or allergic. Eat no more than 4 grams of salt daily.What should your plate look likeA healthy plate should contain 35-45% carbohydrates, 30-40% proteins, 15% fat. Eat the rainbow, and watch out for portion control.Wholesome South Indian platter | Photo Credit: VIJAYA BHASKAR CHGrains (cereal foods): These are rich in fibre and carbohydrates that give the body its energy. Whole grains, belonging to the complex carbohydrates food group, are packed with nutrients and take longer to digest than simple grain (maida, for instance) and hence keep hunger at bay and weight under check. A diet rich in whole grains has been linked to lowering of risk factors for several diseases including hypertension, diabetes, obesity and some forms of cancer.Lean meats, poultry, eggs, legumes and pulses: These are vital sources of protein, one of the building blocks of your body, helping build and heal muscle tissue.Fruits and vegetables: They give you micronutrients (vitamins and minerals), water, even natural sugar. Thesehelpin keeping organs healthyand givingyou energy.Nuts, cooking seed oils, and ghee: Are storehouses of healthy fats. Do not overdose but include them in your daily eating as they support cell growth, protect the organs, help the body absorb nutrients and produce important hormones.The all-time comfort food, Khichdi, provides all the essential nutrientsWholesome food recommended by nutritionists include the North Indian khichdi (prepared with rice, lentils and vegetables) plus a bowl of curd; and rice or idli with vegetable-rich sambar and a glass of buttermilk.The proportionate intakeLovneet Batra says that lunch is the main meal where you can tap into all food groups. But begin your day with a higher intake of carbohydrates (30% to 35 %) as you need energy for all the work you have to do during the day. The last meal of the day should preferably be a minimum or no-carbs dinner. Make your bowl with about 25% to 30% proteins as the body goes into repair while you sleep. For lunch you may consume an almost equal amount of carbs and proteins (30% to 40% each) with lots of vegetables. For all the three meals, the fat intake can be within 5% to 8%.",How to eat healthy and prevent lifestyle diseases,RICE
2021-05-21,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/a-cooking-video-game-that-explores-south-indian-food/article34605370.ece,"Venba, a narrative cooking game with South Indian cuisine and immigrants at its centre, discusses love, loss and identityFluffy white paniyarams, steaming biryani, grated coconut and an incomplete recipe chart with instructions to grind rice, flit between the scenes to a foot-tapping folk rhythm. A woman is at the centre of it all, meticulously chopping, grinding and frying. The 40-second, animated short gives a glimpse into the day-to-day of a family of three  a couple and their child. Food is almost a character, here.The short, which has already grabbed eyeballs on social media, is the teaser of a narrative cooking game, Venba developed by Visai Studios, that has South Indian cuisine at its centre. Revolving around an Indian family based in Toronto, it weaves a tale of love, loss and identity. The two to three hours-long gameplay takes one through incomplete or damaged recipes that need to be solved like a puzzle, where the player is expected to guess the steps.Originally from Chennai, 27-year-old Abhi, the creator of Venba, moved to Toronto when he was 12. Despite migrating as a child, he never felt assimilated to the Canadian culture, and often feels his Chennai roots are stronger. I very much see myself more rooted in Chennai. I grew up strongly connected to that culture and would visit often. I can also speak in Tamil very easily, he says over a Zoom call. But having said that, he adds that Venba is not entirely autobiographical.The story we see here was more inspired by the families that I see around me, that came here [Toronto] much earlier, in the 1980s, says Abhi, adding, There is a lot of media about immigrants: the line most of them pursue is about kids and how hard it is for them to handle two cultures. But I always thought the more interesting story is that of parents. As they come to this country and grow, they grow farther apart from their kids. I have seen some parents who find it really difficult to interact with their own children due to the level of cultural differences. Which, sometimes, he states, even makes them regret their decision to move.Abhi wanted to focus on this aspect of immigration in Venba. This sentiment was also shared by Sam Elakana, his colleague from Indonesia. Together, they developed the concept in January 2020. While Abhi is the designer and programmer, Sam is responsible for the visual character of the game, as art director.In a game, you cant just tell a story, you need something to play with. The game has a series of days and each day happens at different points in their lifetime. So, I thought it would be interesting if we tell the story of what happened each day, through food. No matter what happens, whether there is a fight or not in the family, the kitchen is still on, adds Abhi.But focussing on food, especially South Indian cuisine, does come with its own set of challenges. For any given recipe, there are thousands of variations. So I need to do a lot of research, pre-production almost, before I finalise on a recipe, says Abhi. The recipes concentrate on making everything from scratch; for instance, the game talks about how rice flour is prepared for different dishes. When I communicate these dishes to people who are not of Indian origin  like Sam to draw it  a lot more references are needed, he adds.However, the biggest challenge is the realisation that people of Indian origin are likely to find the gameplay easy, because the ingredients and recipes are familiar.Venba is now at its polishing stage and is expected to reach the market by the winter of 2021 or early 2022. However, those who wish to pre-order the game can do so by wishlisting it on the gaming platform, Steam.It was supposed to be a hobby game. We did not expect the level of reception we are getting! says Abhi. After the trailer was released, patrons from across the world, especially North America, seem to have taken note. The duo wants to bring Venba to PC and all three major consoles. But bringing it to those platforms (Like PS5 or Nintendo Switch) requires deals and partnerships with those companies which we are in the midst of right now, Abhi says.A career in games has always been Abhis plan. After graduating from the University of Toronto, he started working in a mobile games studio as a programmer, in downtown Toronto. We make Venba on the weekend and the nights after my day job, he adds.For Sam and Abhi, Venba will always remain as something they created for themselves. But, we do hope that people would come for the cooking and stay for the story! concludes Abhi.For details, visit venbagame.com","Venba, a new narrative cooking game, has South Indian cuisine and immigrants at its centre",RICE

But rampant urbanisation in Hyderabad has put these beauties lives in jeopardy.Many have been abandoned from their natural environment and a few died as they had nowhere to go after their homes were razed to make way for concrete infrastructure.Rajendar Karpuram, an advocate and bird lover who lives in LB Nagar, noticed this when portions of his lush green surroundings were cleared. The peacocks, who lived there, started fighting for their lives. On a mission to help them, he and another activist discuss this serious issue and give some valuable suggestions on how to care for these delicate lives.Rajendar was for long accustomed to the pleasant environs surrounding his home, which included a large patch of lush greenery and a few peacocks. He started feeding the birds rice grains last year when he was at home all day due to the pandemic. In fact, he used to take the trouble to buy a separate bag of grains for them. But in no time, the green land was reduced to a bald patch of dust with all the trees axed and the peacocks rendered homeless, hungry and thirsty. The peacocks do not have a home. These 40-50 peacocks should be rehabilitated and relocated to a nearby wildlife sanctuary or national park, he says.Rajendar had raised this issue with the authorities, who responded positively. But he urges that measures be taken quickly, as frequent climate change is harmful for the birds. According to Pradeep Nair, founder of the Animal Warriors Conservation Society, the State government has taken significant steps to protect our national animal, the tiger, but what about the peacock? These are just as important to protect, he says.As trapping peacocks is illegal under the Wildlife Protection Act of 1972, it is better to notify the Forest Department. Peacocks are fearful creatures and a sudden change in their environment can be extremely harmful to them, sometimes it can even kill them. Construction contractors should check if there is any such life living on the site they intend to clear. They need to notify the government to ensure that these species are protected, and only then continue with their activities, he says.Pradeep further says citizens should be responsible to notify the Forest Department if any such species is in distress so that it can be reintroduced to its natural habitat. Highlighting the importance of peacocks in the environment, he says: These birds feed on harmful insects, which helps keep the pest population in check. They also raise the alarm if they notice any changes. Peacocks are one of the most precious birds and must be protected at any cost.Find these beauties atVivekananda Nagar Colony, Ramdev Hospital, Kukatpally, KBR Park and Osmania University, among other places in Hyderabad",Homeless at home: Urbanisation bane for peacocks in Hyderabad,RICE

Despite the economic relief package announced by the government, only a fraction of unorganised workers would benefit from it, the letter said. The amount is too little as many workers are already in debt. They are unable to buy food and ration, pay rent, electricity, water bills, purchase gas cylinders and medicines, it stated.SWAN has been receiving distress calls from across Karnataka, especially Bengaluru. The Karnataka High Court directed the government to provide 10 kg free ration to priority households (PHH), 10 kg at Rs 15 per kg for non-PHH, and supply dry ration kits sufficient for 21 days to the doorstep of identified individuals. Workers said they are able to access only 7 kg of rice per member, which after cleaning, dwindles to 5 kg. In the absence of regular income, this gets exhausted in three days. Further, 54 per cent did not possess ration cards, wrote Rajendran Narayanan, Anindita Adhikari, Seema Mundoli and Anushka Kale on behalf of SWAN.In some areas, Indira Canteens are far away from settlements. The staff at the canteens have to upload beneficiary name, mobile number and photograph with the distributed food packets on a BBMP app. This is leading to long queues and crowding around canteens causing health concerns. The ration card is needed for anyone needing more than three packets. This is exclusionary as many do not have ration cards.","Food hard to come by for poor, NGO tells BSY",RICE

In 1960, when he was 30 years old, China was in the midst of a famine unleashed by Mao Zedongs Great Leap Forward policy in 1958 that devastated the agriculture sector and led to mass starvation and the deaths of millions.""On a day in 1960, Yuan went outside of the school and came across two scrawny corpses lying on the side of the street, he once told State broadcaster CCTV. ""The frames were so thin that they looked like skin being wrapped on skeletons. The scene deeply stirred Yuan, who felt that he must do something.Mr. Yuan told the channel, ""Something as small as a grain can save a country, while it can also make a country fall.""His experiments with rice went against conventional wisdom, as the World Food Prize Foundation noted, at a time when ""classical genetics concluded that heterosis - a phenomenon in which the progeny of two distinctly different parents grow faster, yield more, and resist stress better than either parent  was not possible in self-pollinated crops such as rice. He believed it was possible with rice, and published his first findings in 1964. Nine years later, he developed ""the first hybrid rice combination called Nan-you No. 2 which, due to heterosis, boasted yields 20% higher than previous varieties, the foundation said.Chinas rice production ""rose by 47.5% by the 1990s, even as some five million hectares of erstwhile paddy land was shifted to cash crops such as vegetables, fruits, cotton, and rapeseed, said the Ramon Magsaysay Award Foundation, which honoured him with a prize in 2001, adding that ""as much as half of Chinas rice land is planted to Yuans hybrids.""By 1976, China began producing Nan-you No.2. The countrys total rice output surged from 5.69 billion tonnes in 1950 to 19.47 billion tonnes in 2000, for the first time transforming China into a grain surplus country.Mr. Yuan worked until his last.

My extra-long, waist-length hair and this product went together like a match made in heaven, a Virgo and a Capricorn.They met at work (my bathroom counter) and brought out the best in each other. The Virgo serum loved my hairs potential. My Capricorn hair loved the mysticism and fast-working ways of the serum. Although its usually a big step, I even had it meet my boyfriend (when I forced him to touch my hair he agreed that my ends felt very soft).Things just flowed, the Monoi Oil worked better on my hair than Argan Oil ever did. Turns out, apart from strengthening and repairing, the ingredient also lends an SPF value to the serum. If its one thing I have in common with your dermatologist, its that I will never (ever) stop reminding you about the importance of wearing sunscreen daily. Theres also no reason for it to stop at your hairline. Your scalp is at risk for UVA and UVB damage, and external environmental factors can lead to brittle, frayed ends. Thats a no thank you from me.Rice protein is also a key ingredient, a very poorly kept Korean beauty secret. If youre looking to go for a DIY route, which can be a fun weekend project  simply soak your rice in water and let it rest for a few hours.

On unwashed hair, it will only weigh down the strands, and leave them thinner and oilier. Surprisingly, another tip I picked up along the way to make my hair look good is a towel out of all things. I swapped towels for my hair with microfibre hair wraps, which has drastically reduced the frizz.T-shirts work just as well, but dont give me that Mario Testino towel shoot vibe which I have come to love.

Did the salaried class escape unscathed?The story so far: Hit by a relentless second wave of COVID-19 infections, India has seen localised lockdowns across several States. With activity restrained, job losses have climbed. This has dampened family incomes and consumer sentiment, setting the stage for lower-than-anticipated economic growth and belying the nations hopes of racing back to activity this year on a low base last year.How have lockdowns affected jobs?Among the first effects felt from a regions lockdown is the loss of jobs. According to the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE), the unemployment rate was 6.5% in March but rose to around 8% in April, the month when several States began to prepare for or had already imposed lockdowns. With 73.5 lakh job losses in April, the number of employees (both salaried and non-salaried) fell from 39.81 crore in March to 39.08 crore in April for the third straight month. In April 2020, which was the first full month of the national lockdown last year, the unemployment rate had zoomed to 23.5%.Also Read Job loss bodes ill for economy, spurring demand is key, says Mahesh VyasWhat do the data indicate about unemployment in rural and urban areas?At 7.13%, the rural unemployment rate for April 2021 is lower than the urban figure of 9.8%. The month of May has seen the rates rise further at the national level. As of May 21, the 30-day moving average for overall unemployment was 10.3%, with the relevant figures for urban and rural areas at 12.2% and 9.4%, respectively.The labour participation rate (LPR) for April 2021, at 40%, remained lower than the levels seen before last years lockdown. Labour participation helps measure the section of the population that is willing to take on jobs. Unemployment is a subset, which helps in giving a measure of those who are willing to take on jobs but are not employed.Women tend to face a double challenge, with lower labour participation and a higher unemployment rate for females compared with males (for ages above 15). For the January-April 2021 period, urban female LPR was 7.2% compared with the urban males 64.8%, while urban female unemployment was 18.4% against the urban male unemployment rate of 6.6%, CMIE data showed.Also Read Migrant workers vulnerable again, say activistsHow has the agriculture sector fared?Agriculture was the saving grace during the first wave, but it is not so during the second one. April 2020 saw this sector being the only one to add jobs  the count of those employed in the agriculture sector had gone up by 6 million or 5% compared with the average count in FY20, according to CMIE data.In April 2021, agriculture shed 6 million jobs compared to a month earlier. This figure ties in with reports of the hinterland being far more affected by the pandemic this year compared with last year.Also Read A bullet train to hungerDaily wage labourers and small traders saw a loss of employment in the order of 0.2 million in April. Some of these agricultural and daily wage labourers may have found work in the construction industry as the sector saw an increase of 2.7 million jobs during April. But, as the CMIE posits, most of the 6.2 million people released from agriculture and daily wages jobs could well have ended up remaining unemployed during the month. This is a clear indication that the jobs scenario is weakening even before recovering from last years onslaught.The Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act data showed that April saw an uptick in the demand for jobs  2.7 crore households signed up for work in April 2021, rising from 1.3 crore a year earlier  as reverse migration of labour picked up, resulting in availability of hands in the rural parts.Did the salaried class escape unscathed?No. The cumulative loss of salaried jobs since the pandemic began is pegged at 12.6 million, according to CMIE data, and the trend continues with April 2021 seeing this coveted category drop 3.4 million jobs from the level in March 2021.Which States have been hit the hardest?Haryana recorded the highest unemployment rate in April 2021 at 35%, as per CMIE data, followed by Rajasthan at 28%, Delhi at 27.3%, and Goa at 25.7%. Significantly, Gujarat, which, like the above States, also witnessed the ferocity of the pandemics second wave, saw unemployment at an appreciably lower level of 1.8%.Also Read Lessons from the first waveWhat are the economic consequences of rising unemployment?Obviously, job losses have a telling effect on incomes. CMIEs managing director and CEO, Mahesh Vyas, said that 90% of Indian families have seen their incomes shrink over the course of the past 13 months. Loss of income naturally dampens consumer sentiment and lowers economic demand.The RBIs monthly bulletin published earlier this month acknowledged that the biggest toll of the pandemics second wave was in terms of a demand shock  loss of mobility, discretionary spending and employment, besides inventory accumulation.In an article titled State of the Economy in the bulletin, RBI officials pointed out that aggregate demand conditions had been impacted, albeit not on the scale of the first wave. They highlighted the fact that e-way bills, an indicator of domestic trade, recorded double-digit contraction at 17.5% month-on-month in April 2021, with intrastate and inter-state e-way bills declining by 16.5% and 19%, respectively.This is an ominous sign for the Goods and Services Tax (GST) collections in the coming months. Collections in April 2021 were the highest-ever at 1.41 lakh crore since the new tax regime was introduced. The authors of the RBI bulletin article said the contraction in e-way bills could point to a moderation in GST collections in coming months. However, despite the decline over March 2021, total e-way bills remained above the pre-pandemic baseline of February 2020, indicating that domestic trade has remained resilient on the back of digitisation of sales platforms.The RBI officials asserted that the second wave has so far had only a limited impact on industrial activity, citing the 8.1% growth in electricity generation in April over the pre-pandemic base of April 2019.Would the situation improve if the current lockdowns were to end today?Food insecurity is a key welfare issue in the months following an economic shock. A report from Azim Premji Universitys Centre for Sustainable Employment, titled State of Working India 2021, One year of COVID-19, showed that on average, households lost about 22% of their cumulative income over eight months ended October 2020. Also, poorer households lost a larger proportion of their already low incomes. This not only led to increased poverty levels, the researchers said, but also that the ways in which households coped with this shock was by borrowing, largely from informal sources, selling assets, and cutting back on food consumption. This means that even after a lockdown is lifted and employment begins returning close to the earlier levels, consumer spending, the lifeblood of any economy, may remain muted.Also Read Localised lockdowns already hitting economic activities: ReportThe report cited a couple of surveys  the Universitys own COVID Livelihoods Phone Survey (CLIPS) and Hunger Watch  to highlight the problem of the low-income population cutting back on food intake. The Hunger Watch survey showed that 66% of surveyed households had less to eat even five months after last years lockdown.The researchers argued that incomes lost during the months when economic activity is more severely affected leave a long-term impact either as depleted savings or as incurred debt, which must be built back or paid back, by curtailing future consumption and investment. The CLIPS survey showed that the poorest households took the largest loans relative to their earnings.Also read | An issue of lives versus livelihoodsHow are governments addressing these issues?The Central government has announced that it will distribute 5 kg of rice and wheat for free to ration card holders across the country. Individual States have added to this. Bihar, for example, has announced that it would add an equal measure to the Centres distribution from the States resources for free distribution via the Public Distribution System. Tamil Nadu has announced a 4,000 handout per ration card and has begun distributing the first tranche of half that amount. Kerala has promised that no family would go hungry in the State.

New Friends Colony resident Manikiran Kaur is one such person who has decided to feed the cats of her locality by putting out water and dry food for them.We also keep out rice and bajra for birds outside our homes and we are doing our bit.Simranjeet Singh, an analyst by profession who resides in West Delhis Fateh Nagar has been regularly feeding animals for two years.During the lockdown he steps outside at around 8pm daily.I go out after finishing my office work and cover the area around my home. We make sure that the animals near my home do not sleep hungry. There are many in my nearby vicinity who also feed the dogs. We have divided areas among each other to feed the maximum number of dogs, said.He added that dogs have had their routines affected. Many restaurants are shut and often dogs would rely on those to feed themselves. So during the lockdown it becomes all the more necessary to feed them and provide them medicine. I have personally saved hundreds of animals by feeding them, giving them water or providing them first aid.Mayur Vihar resident Aura Bhandari steps out with her father, carrying buckets of feed which include rice and water. We have selected certain isolated areas where we place water and the buckets and the dogs and cows come there to be fed. We make sure that we also take care of injured animals.She said that because of the lockdown dogs sit in the middle of the road and when the vehicles do come, some get injured.Aura said that unlike last year, there are fewer feeders as many are reeling from the disease or are nursing their family members causing worry among animal lovers about the health of stray animals of the city.She stated that many animals are famished because their feeders are affected by Covid-19.Kanika Dewan, People for Animals stated that we are losing feeders to Covid-19 as they are sick. So along with sending food to them we are also providing monetary help and safety materials like PPE kits for them.She said that their organisation, The Good Deed is doing the good deed and also providing help to the families of the feeders. I am in touch with hospitals and we are locating and helping people with medicines, oxygen cylinders, concentrators and everything that is required.Geeta Seshamani of Friendicoes added that the number of feeders who are dedicated to their street dogs have been reduced due to Covid problems, either sick themselves or nursing sick family members. A few have not been earning and hence are running out of resources. But they are very committed and create a great network amongst themselves to ensure all their street dogs get fed or appeal to NGOs like Friendicoes.She stated that Friendicoes was feeding over 2500 street animals during the first wave. Gradually as dog feeders took over we reduced it to 800 animals but overnight we are back to double that and people are appealing to us they dont have an e-pass or any pass and hence are requesting us to feed their animals.

The problems of this sexual minority are unique, as has been documented, but the solutions need teamwork and support from the larger society.Right now, the transgender community is unable to work, with or without dignity. In Hyderabad alone there are more than 3,000 transgenders and another 2,000 elsewhere in the State. Many of them earn their livelihood by seeking alms during the day and some resort to flesh trade at night, but with lockdown in place members of the community are suffering. A large number of transgenders in the State is unable to fetch a single meal per day, while some who live in a small group are going to bed on empty stomachs.Realising their plight as they are not even able to seek alms in the four-hour lockdown relaxation, the transgenders or third-gender people are requesting the owners of grocery and vegetable shops to donate some grains and vegetables for their group. Both begging and prostitution are demeaning works. Because there is no other choice, we are forced to do it in order to survive, as there are no dignified or decent jobs for us in the society, transgender right activist Rachana Mudraboina said.According to Mx. Rachana, the first and second wave of COVID-19 and the lockdowns had hampered a lot of the community members, whose families have disowned them due to their gender identity. As our existence is not documented in government records, we are not entitled to any social schemes, including free rice from fair price shops, launched by both State and Central governments, she said.With no Aadhaar cards and other government IDs for their new identity in the society, they are not eligible for COVID-19 vaccine to protect themselves from the deadly virus.

Already, the lives of the children and elderly inmates of these homes have been severely impacted by the pandemic.Now, many donors who helped the centres earlier have stopped sending donations what with Covid affecting their finances. As a result, the entire functioning of the centres has changed and the activities for the elderly and children has come to a standstill. The state has over 2,000 registered orphanages, mostly run by non-government or charitable organisations.Though all orphanages and old-age homes are getting government funds, things are not as smooth as before. We run this centre with public support of people. Now that no visitor is allowed due to social distancing, the donations have also stopped. The funds available now are being used to fulfil basic requirements, mainly food, said Anoop Gangadharan, managing trustee of Arm of Joy, a Kozhikode-based NGO.The donations were effectively used for the well-being of children - providing them education, looking after their health and giving them a standard lifestyle - and to build sufficient infrastructure facilities for them. Now, everything has changed. All the organisations are struggling to make ends meet, he said.At present, the government is providing Rs 1,700 per child every month and 7 kg of rice and 3 kg of wheat for each child, he said.Earlier, when things were normal, we would get special food from outside almost daily which always came as a blessing for these kids and helped the institutions save money and use the governments grant for other needs of the kids and elderly, he said.Using the funds earlier, we were able to build a small playground for boys of Free Birds orphanage, which they used during the pandemic. However, there are several institutions across the state that are facing issues and are unable to offer any extracurricular activity or nutritious food to kids now, Anoop said.

Thousands of seaside villagers have started preparations to shift to safer places as the cyclone inches closer to the State coast.District emergency officer Sambeet Satpathy said the administration has made arrangements to evacuate people residing in seaside villages of Mahakalapada and Rajnagar blocks from vulnerable areas within a days time on May 25. High alert has been sounded in seaside panchayats of Satabhaya, Gupti, Talachua, Rangani, Pentha, Jamboo, Kharinashi , Kansarabadadandua and Suninti.Since Mahakalapada and Rajnagar could face the worst of tidal surge and heavy rains, the administration will evacuate residents to cyclone shelters and school and college buildings on May 25. We have deployed power boats for relief and evacuation works. We are using public address systems to warn people of the impending danger. The authorities have also stocked dry food and rice besides keeping medical teams and ambulances on standby. Many sick and pregnant women have been shifted to hospitals, Satapathy informed.He further said the authorities are working with local sarpanchs and other panchayat body members to help people prepare for the cyclone. The coastal areas of the district are frequently hit by cyclones and hence, everyone is taking the approaching Yaas seriously. The administration faces a dual challenge of preparing for the cyclone and preventing spread of Covid-19 as the pandemic situation has complicated housing arrangements of evacuees.Physical distancing is needed to prevent the transmission of the virus, the emergency officer said. To ensure social distancing, the number of cyclone shelters has been doubled by using school buildings. Masks have been made compulsory at the shelters. Separate isolation rooms have been readied for infected patients. Regular coordination meetings are being held between government officials and humanitarian agencies in areas which are most likely to be affected, Satapathy added.",Mass evacuation as ‘Yaas’ inches closer,RICE

This time last year, people were sharing pictures and videos on baking sourdough and doing home bar takeovers, even as they participated in viral challenges like Dalgona coffee. However, this year, battered by the emotional and physical impact of the pandemic, even if people cook and eat for comfort, many are choosing not to share it on Instagram.Lecturer Chandrasekhar Sarmah from Odisha points out: I dont want to be insensitive to peoples suffering. Last year I had close family members suffering from COVID-19, so I know the stress. I dont want the people looking for help on social media to be fed with unnecessary information about my Ramzan menu. Even before lockdown, I stopped posting tempting food shots of Ramzan specialities so that viewers arent tempted to venture out.Of late, food shots or videos being shared are mostly related to food for COVID-19 patients under quarantine; with the hashtag #CookForCOVID being particularly active. Mumbai-based networking consultant Nina Mishra says it is important to keep peoples social media feeds free of unnecessary information like lunch or dinner spreads.She says A lot of people, young and old alike, are looking for suggestions on nutritious dishes, lockdown food supplies as well as medical help and other needs. Nina came to know about home-cooked meals for her aged parents who were under home quarantine due to COVID-19.Cuisine of catharsisMangaluru-based freelance writer Subha J Rao shares, The rush for fancy recipes and Dalgona coffee passed me by during the first phase of COVID-19. I decided to begin cooking for convalescents and people under isolation because I felt theyd like homely food at a time when their stomachs are slightly delicate. When my husband was isolating at home in a different city, I was deeply appreciative of anyone who sent across a healthy meal to him.Subha continues, Ive done about 25 meals a day for about 20 days now, and dont charge for it, thanks to donations from some friends. I send across a curry, sambar and rasam or a kootu, plus rice for those who cant even cook rice for themselves. For some people, I sent breakfast and dinner too. There is no greater joy than having them call after recovery to tell you that when their sense of smell and taste got back, they really relished the food. Personally, cooking has been very therapeutic, because I box myself into a no-distraction zone and focus on just the task at hand.As India struggles with vaccine inadequacy and a rising number of deaths, cooking has become a stress-busting exercise. Homemaker Sarita Bhavani in Hyderabad is also on her apartment complex welfare society, coordinating water tanker visits, maintenance budgeting, and the inevitable inter-apartment politics during the pandemic.Sarita Bhavani, in Hyderabad, has prepared chicken biryani with an atta-sealed pot | Photo Credit: Divya Kala BhavaniPreparing large-scale dishes such as rohu pulusu, rasmalai and chicken biryani is really therapeutic, because it has many methodical stages and requires patience amid the noise around us, explains Sarita, Many loved ones have been going through COVID and this is my way of counting my blessings and keeping my family healthy. Plus I love sharing with some close friends in the building because food wastage has been a huge problem during the pandemic, she says.Many homemakers and cooks are also getting busy cooking meals for entire families under quarantine, or for convalescents.Mumbai-based Snigdha Dhar, a lawyer, volunteered to cook for her family members who tested positive. She says it is not easy to cook three meals a day for 12 to 15 people, especially with no domestic help coming to work under COVID-19 protocols. Thankfully, delivery aggregators worked to hand over the food to the affected families. Also, with the lockdown, I dont have to worry about work.Spreading comfortThere are others who indulged older couples with their food cravings. Software professional Sureka Simon in Hyderabad found herself making dahi vada for the first time as her neighbour expressed her desire for them as they chatted from across the corridor.Sureka says, It is all about doing what feels right to make people comfortable. My neighbour never forgets to send a portion of anything special that is made at her home. As her cook isnt coming to work regularly, I felt I should do this to make her happy. Sureka says some cooking and sharing in real life is much more satisfying than cooking to share on social media.Nina opines that the seriousness of the situation makes everyone want to help in some way or the other. Everyone is swinging into action in whatever way they can, especially with food which is a primary concern when under home quarantine.For Guwahati-based food consultant Sanjukta Das, cooking is not only a stress-buster, but also helps her cheer friends who are cooped up at home and are not excited at stepping into the kitchen.

Taking a page from the army's historical playbook, experts say the violence also appears aimed at keeping the death toll artificially low and concealing evidence.But unlike past violence, the attacks are being captured on smartphones and surveillance cameras in real-time and could one day be used against the regime before international criminal courts, as has happened elsewhere in the world.""It has always been the military's strategy to hide the mass crackdown there, the mass killing of the protesters,"" said Van Tran, a Cornell University researcher who studied the bloody 1988 and 2007 uprisings in Myanmar.""There are always large-scale operations in order to either cremate the bodies of people that were shot down or ...bulldoze and bury those bodies.So a lot of the time, families do not know where their children went."" Almost a quarter of the recent cases with known locations analyzed by the HRC Lab involved injured people or dead bodies snatched by security forces in the country's biggest city, Yangon, followed by Mandalay and Bago.The largest number of those incidents, documented through posts on social media, was reported on March 27.Celebrated annually as Armed Forces Day, it commemorates the start of the military's resistance to Japanese occupation during World War II after more than a century of British colonial rule.This year protesters dubbed it ""Anti-Fascist-Resistance Day,"" and came out in large numbers in a stand against the military takeover.It was on that day that motorbike rider Kyaw Min Latt was shot, though his family told AP the young carpenter had not been to a demonstration but was instead heading home from the job site to grab an early lunch with two friends.Using satellite visuals, reverse image searches, and a sun-shadow calculator, the HRC Lab was able to verify that the shooting took place at 10:38 a.m. in front of a high school on Azarni Road in the southern town of Dawei.In the footage, two shots are heard and Kyaw Min Latt, who was sitting between the driver and a fellow passenger, is seen grabbing his head and falling sideways.Officers chased after the two other riders with guns raised.Another bang is then heard.Sixteen minutes later, a passerby posted a picture on Facebook of blood-soaked concrete and flip flops near the white motorbike that security forces had carefully propped back up before taking Kyaw Min Latt's body.Within two hours, the CCTV footage was also being shared widely across social media platforms.That's how the teen's father received the news.He told AP he later learned his son had been taken to a military hospital.He rushed there to see him that afternoon and said the teen was still alive, but unconscious.""He was badly wounded,"" Soe Soe Latt said.""He opened his eyes when we were at the hospital, but could not say any words."" The boy died soon after, and his father said army doctors wanted to perform an autopsy.The family fought against it but said the hospital would only release the body if they signed a paper saying their son died of head injuries from falling off the motorbike.A photo published online before Kyaw Min Latt's funeral by Dawei Watch, a local news outlet, told a different story: There was a gaping wound in the teen's neck.",Myanmar military uses bodies as tools of terror in crackdown,RICE

Several villages in Ballari, Gadag, Haveri and surroundings are coming up with unique superstitious ideas in what they believe could ward off the virus.The act of villagers in Kolagallu of Ballari drew flak on social media after heaps of cooked rice was placed in tractor trolleys to be thrown on the village borders as per the belief. Villagers claimed that each house of the village had to cook rice and contribute to the ritual. As per the ritual blood of rooster or livestock is mixed with the rice and the same will be kept along the village borders to keep the evil spirits away.Two weeks ago, the Ballari police were surprised to see hundreds of villagers walking with sticks and drums post midnight as the parade was captured in CCTV. The incident had happened in the same village which prepared tonnes of rice for the ritual.After the video of rice trolleys went viral a section of youth in the same village approached the administration and gave a written complaint. In the complaint they have named five heads from the village who were responsible for the act. On Friday evening the village heads had an announcement that to ward off the virus every household should cook rice and contribute. Today our village has got a bad name thanks to such acts. We have given a written complaint to Ballari police, said a youth from D Kolagallu village.Villagers in Kunchur of Haveri did something different to get rid of the virus. About 80 households sacrificed roosters for the same reason. Villagers in Gadag district had made small statues of Corona Goddess and pleased her with several food items praying to her to get the virus out of their villages.Noted rationalist from Mangaluru Narendra Naik termed the act as criminal waste at the time of unemployment, growing hunger and pandemic. Just because some of the practices were carried out during olden times we need not follow them now. Be it any pandemic about 90% of the people get recovered. The villagers who sow such beliefs claim that it was because of their act.

Carrying a pungent fragrance and an earthy bitterness, the moringa is a no-frills backyard plant with soft, fern-like leaves, droopy branches and white blossoms.Its a tropical tree that requires little water to grow and can help restore degraded soil. Its good for the planet in plenty of ways. It purifies water, reverses deforestation, improves soil fertility, fights malnutrition, acts as an income for rural communities and improves their food security, says botanist and gardening enthusiast, Kasturi Venkat.The green powerWhile its beginning to gain popularity in many kitchens of the West, what is lesser-known is its health benefits for animals. Consuming moringa prevents cancer, treats digestive problems, reduces obesity, fights seizure, boosts immunity and overall health of animals, notes Kasturi. Native medicine practitioners have been using the leaves, flowers, seeds, and the roots of this plant for centuries to treat health ailments.While its the leaf that contains the maximum benefits, Kasturi breaks down the properties of the other parts, sharing why its referred to as The Tree of Life in many cultures. The white flowers contain vitamin E, calcium, anti-cancer, anti-diabetic, anti-inflammatory, anti-microbial and neuroprotective properties. The stem contains vitamin C, iron, calcium, antiobesity and cardioprotective properties. The root contains iron, zinc, anti-ageing, anti-microbial, anti-inflammatory and anti-viral properties. The seed contains vitamins C and E, anti-diabetic, anti-cholesterol and anti-microbial properties, she details.Gourmet makeoverFour years back, moringa gave kale a stiff competition as a must-have superfood, across the world. While it may not be a great palate-pleaser, players in the gourmet market have found quirky ways to incorporate a mild boost of its greenness into everyday meals. Deepika Ravi, founder of The Good Leaf, explains how. Moringa caught the attention of the millennials soon after it penetrated the gourmet market. The awareness has only spiralled over the years and during the lockdown.People prefer anything thats given to them in a palatable format. We offer valueadded products with moringa such as powder, tea, honey, pods powder, rice mix and chutney. A healthy mix and pickle are down the line, says Deepika. Besides this, their skincare range with moringa includes face and hair serum, hair oil, packs, soaps and scrubs. We will be introducing a moringa face cream with blue light protection, she adds. The Good Leafs moringa farm in Karur employs over 100 farmers through organic farming for the last six years.Weve been into farming and cultivating moringa for almost three generations. The leaves form a significant part of the plant. They are dried and ground into a fine, velvety powder. The laborious process involves harvesting, drying and milling. For the modern crowd, its available in capsules in a consumable quantity. So far, there arent many side effects unless theres no overconsumption. Weve been receiving only positive feedback on how it has solved many back-related problems for people working from home, shares Deepika.Nutritional life-saverWith its increasing popularity in the market, during the pandemic, SI Dhivyaa Svarna, nutritionist and dietician, Fortis Hospital, Vadapalani, decodes the nutrient-dense food. Its a versatile plant. Earlier, people used to boil the leaves and consume them as soup. You can make chutney, spinach and poriyal out of it. Moringa tea is said to alleviate stress and fatigue.

Saradamoni, one of the pioneers in Dalit and gender studies, passed away here on Wednesday. She was 93.Known for one of the earliest historical analyses of caste slavery in Kerala, she had worked as an economist at the Indian Statistical Institute in Delhi from 1961 to 1988.Right from her student days at the Government College for Women and University College in Thiruvananthapuram in the post-Independence period, Ms. Saradamoni displayed her adeptness at field studies and surveys.Later, during her stint in Paris, working on her PhD with French anthropologist Louis Dumont, she came across an old file in the archives on abolition of slavery in Kerala, which kindled in her the idea for her pioneering work Emergence of a slave caste: Pulayas of Kerala in 1980.It was the first of its kind study on caste slavery, which is still a reference material. It is most important for the wealth of source material, including rare colonial documents. That pathbreaking work gave a sense of history and agency for the Dalit community, placing it as part of our renaissance history. It remained somewhat ignored by mainstream historians until Dalit studies opened up in recent decades. In gender studies too, she made a breakthrough with her research on matrilineal system and womens land rights. Because she had an economics background, she was able to bring in a different dimension to her studies in gender and caste, says Meera Velayudhan, policy analyst and president, Indian Association for Womens Studies.In Matriliny Transformed: Family, Law and Ideology in Twentieth Century Travancore, she examined how matriliny offered identity and security to women and how the system changed in Travancore.In Finding the Household: Conceptual and Methodological Issues - Women & the Household in Asia, she explored the position of women and gender relations within the household, with ground studies from Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia, and other countries.Agrarian studies was also another strong point of interest for her as evident in works such as Filling the Rice Bowl: Women in Paddy Cultivation.In Divided Poor: Study of a Kerala Village, she studied caste and land ownership in a village. Ms. Saradamoni advocated for a relook into the system of administration which is compartmentalised.If our future policies in rural transformation as part of creation of a just and fair country has to succeed, the focus must shift to women, she had written. She was a mentor to many scholars of gender and Dalit studies across India.One of her recent books, The Scribe Remembered  N.Gopinathan Nair, was a personal one on her late husband N.Gopinathan Nair, founder-editor of Janayugam, the newspaper of the undivided Communist Party.

This will have severe implications for the livelihoods of those in the informal sector. There is adequate evidence that migrant workers and the rural poor have been facing great distress over the past one year and the crisis for food and work is only going to intensify further.Hunger and distressA few months ago, the Right to Food campaign and the Centre for Equity Studies published a Hunger Watch report which compared the pre-lockdown situation last year to the situation in October 2020 to assess the impact of the nationwide lockdown. The survey involving 4,000 respondents across 11 States exposed the life and livelihood uncertainties of people belonging to low-income categories in the informal sector. In October 2020, 27% of the respondents said that they had no income; 40% respondents said that the nutritional quality of food had become much worse; and 46% of the respondents said they had to skip one meal at least once in the day in October 2020.Also read | Rajasthan to restart MGNREGA works within COVID-19 restrictionsThe migrants have again become vulnerable due to the lockdown in different cities. While many have once again headed to their villages, a large population has got stranded in different parts of the country without work. The Stranded Workers Action Network, a group of individuals helping distressed migrant workers since last year, has been reaching out to workers for providing essential help. According to them, 81% of the people whom they reached out to said that work had mostly stopped since April 15, 2021 and 76% of the workers said they are short of food and cash and require immediate support.In this context, there is an urgent need to strengthen the public distribution system (PDS) and the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS). The government announced 5 kg free foodgrains for individuals enlisted under the National Food Security Act (NFSA), for May and June 2021. The government should expand PDS coverage immediately and include all eligible households under the schemes. According to an independent study, about 100 million people are excluded from the ration distribution system owing to a dated database based on the 2011 Census.The Centre should also extend the free foodgrains programme to a year instead of limiting it to two months. The economic crisis is likely to last for a long time. It is being reported that India procured record amounts of rice and wheat last year through mandis. The total procurement is way more than the current requirement for PDS. It is thus quite possible to expand the safety net of the NFSA.Also Read A bullet train to hungerInadequate provisionsThe Centre had allocated 73,000 crore for 2021-22 for MGNREGS and notified an annual increment of about 4% in wages. Both these provisions are inadequate to match the requirements on the ground. The central allocation for MGNREGS is about 38,500 crore less than last years revised estimate. Of the 7.56 crore households which worked in MGNREGS in 2020-21, even if 1 crore households opt out of the scheme this year, the Centre should still budget for 75-80 days of employment in the year for 6.5 crore families given the current scale of economic distress. By this rationale, at the current rate of 268/day/person, at least 1.3 lakh crore will have to be budgeted. The government should also re-consider its decision of a mere 4% increase in MGNREGS wages and hike it by at least 10%. This will mean another 10,000 crore. Therefore, at least 1.4 lakh crore will be required to ensure uninterrupted implementation during the year.Also read | Hunger continued even after lockdown, says reportA large population is facing hunger and a cash crunch.

Besides sleep and rest, eating healthy is an essential now to aid in healing.Good nutrition helps your battered body build up its energy levels as fast as possible, says Dr Kavitha Fenn Arunkumar, Madurai-based psychiatrist, referring not just to those who have suffered the sickness, but also those who have seen adversity through the pandemic. In fact, she recommends the intake of easy-to-digest food in frequent and small measures because the body and mind are both vulnerable and not in a condition to labour hard over three big elaborate meals.Dr Arunkumar receives three or four calls a day from those who have seen a COVID-19 death in their families and now during their own recuperation are finding it difficult to eat. The food we eat should be easy and comforting to chew and swallow, she says. She also cautions against emotional eating (feeding on convenience foods to satiate cravings). Its best to eat food that does not cause distress to the digestive system or any other part of the body, she says.Power up with nutrientsTo gain stamina and fight the weakness, Delhi-based nutritionist Shweta Gupta says it is important to power up with proteins as they help reverse tissue damage and stimulate the production of T-cells, the agents that promote healthy immune functioning. Proteins are the most important macro-nutrients that aid in rebuilding and recharging the body; vitamins improve immunity and probiotics improve the gut bacteria after the heavy antibiotic and steroid used in treatment, says Anjali Dange, nutritionist and founder of Starlite Nutrition and Wellness Centre, Visakhapatnam. For those who are lactose tolerant milk-based products have immunomodulatory, antimicrobial, and anti-hypertensive effects on the body.Buy fresh and seasonal fruits and vegetables for good healthThe carbohydrates in our breakfast and lunch can constitute up to 25%, says Gurugram nutritionist Asheesh Grewal. Our Indian kitchens are full of potent anti-inflammatory and anti-viral ingredients such as ginger, turmeric, garlic, cumin, coriander, mint, cinnamon, honey, all of which are usually and can be used in different combinations and different items for overall well being. One should nourish the body well for at least six months post-COVID treatment, he says.Comfort foodHome-maker Mili Ghosh from 24 South Paraganas, West Bengal, cooks and packs seven different types of khichdi for each day of the week and home delivers it fresh in her neighbourhood to those in home quarantine. After hearing a dietician on television, I began preparing khichdi using a different millet and combination of dals each day and powered it with lots of seasonal vegetables, says Mili, who has been doing this free of cost for six weeks now ever since her husband fell to COVID-19. Along with the nutritious and tasty khichdi, she also gives them a boiled egg five days a week and a flask of lassi daily. I am alone and this work keeps me going, she says.Suman Agarwal, from Mumbai, recommends the 4X model: four meals at agap of four hours each. Follow the 8 am- noon-4pm-8 pm or 9 am-1 pm-5 pm-9 pm schedule and control the portions, especially carbohydrates. Feed your hunger but never over-stuff, she says.Tips to follow at home: Avoid elaborate cooking and stick to simple recipes with more greens (Spinach, methi, sarson saag and other keerais) as they are known to lower anxiety levels.Make one or two vegetable chutneys and store, so that you can use them every day with rice or chapatis.Keep a jar of nuts and seeds by your side for easy snacking, They are potent sources of essential fatty acids such as Omega-3 and healthy fats that boost energy and promote healthy cholesterol levelsTaste and smell may take a while to return to normal making every bite of food utterly tasteless but it is important to keep up the appetite with small and frequent meals.The essential vitamins required during the period of healing are C and D. They help to prevent the body from oxidative damage and reduce inflammation. Stock yourself up with guavas, amla, kiwis, oranges and sweet lime for your lung healthSubhashree Ray, clinical and public health nutritionist in Mumbai, focusses on customised nutritional requirements of those with co-morbidities, particularly diabetes. Those with insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome need to be extra cautious of what is entering their body, she says and suggests complex carbohydrates such as whole grains and legumes for them. High fibre cereals and pulses like jawar, bajra, ragi, brown rice, oatmeal, millets, quinoa take longer to digest than simple carbs (refined grains like maida  often found in bread) and thereby keep the blood sugar from spiking, she adds. A staple cuisine of Bengal, the tetor dal (bitter lentil) made with the yellow split moong dal and karela (bitter gourd) is considered good.Nutrients-dense post-COVID recovery mealPasty khichdi with lots of vegetables; mashed dal or rasam with rice; curd rice; paneer or soya curry with two to three soft phulkas; green leafy and seasonal vegetables; steamed fish, egg and chicken (for non-vegetarians).Eat home-made balanced diet for the body to respond well and fast after infectionHealthy snacks:A bowl of salad or low-fat curd at room temperature, figs and dates, a spoonful of pumpkin, chia or flax seeds, boiled peanuts or chick peas, a fistful of nuts (including almonds, walnuts), sweet potato chaat or seasonal fruits.High hydration:Enough water, low salt lassi, coconut water, butter milk with a dash of cumin and mint, chaach, and fresh juice with seasonal fruits (without adding sugar), bael ka sharbat (it is high in fibre).Chicken or vegetable broth soupThe immunity boosters:You can make a variety of health drinks at home to improve your haemoglobin levels. Here are a few suggested by the nutritionists:Blend one small amla, half a carrot and apple each, one tomato, quarter of a boiled beetroot and half cup pomegranate; dilute it with little water to suit your taste.Kadha: To 300 ml boiling water add 10 basil (tulsi) leaves, four lightly crushed peppercorns, half inch grated ginger and one pinch cinnamon. Reduce the concoction to half and add one teaspoon honey.A simple concoction of coriander, cumin and fennel seeds (saunf) or lemon and barley water is good for general well-being.",Here’s what to include in your post-COVID-19 diet,RICE

Shunmugasundaram that the State government would consider a plea to distribute COVID-19 cash relief of 4,000 to the transgender community, sympathetically, without insisting on ration cards.Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy recorded the submission made during the hearing of a public interest litigation petition filed by transgender rights activist Grace Banu and adjourned the case to June 7 for the government to report the progress made in this regard.In an affidavit filed through her counsel C. Prabhu, the litigant said there were more than 50,000 transpersons in the State, though the available government data showed that there were only 11,449 transpersons, of whom 2,541 had been issued ration cards.Pointing out that the government had announced a COVID-19 cash relief of 4,000 to all rice ration cardholders, and had begun distributing the first instalment of 2,000 to each of them, the petitioner said the restriction that the relief would be given only to ration cardholders would lead to exclusion of many transpersons who did not possess ration cards due to various reasons, including a delay on the part of the Civil Supplies Department in issuing the cards.The petitioner recalled that during the first wave of COVID-19, the State had distributed cash relief of 1,000 to not just rice ration cardholders, but also transpersons without ration cards.The litigant added that hardly any transpersons had been issued identity cards, ever since the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act of 2019 and the statutory rules framed thereunder in 2020 had come into force.Even before the 2019 enactment and the statutory rules came into force, only 6,553 transpersons had been issued identity cards in the State, and the others could not be expected to obtain ration cards without producing identity cards, the petitioner said.It was also brought to the notice of the court that transpersons had several doubts over COVID-19 vaccination since they were either on hormone therapy or undergoing sex reassignment surgeries.Therefore, awareness programmes must be conducted to dispel doubts on vaccines, the litigant said.",Transpersons’ plea will be considered sympathetically: A-G,RICE

All these expenses are being borne by the bank, said the official.Apart from this, the financial institution also provides food kits comprising rice and vegetables to Covid-affected families. All these services are accessible to everyone irrespective of whether they are banks customers or not. So far, we have given away over 500 kits to families. The bank has also shifted over 100 patients to hospitals and sanitised more than 200 households, he said.Under the leadership of president N A Mani and director board members like KE Joseph, Mohammed Basheer, the bank has been coordinating the activities for few months now.

The sous chef from Palli  67 km from Jodhpur  was being tasked with an assignment by U. Tarun Kumar, a Chennai-based food catering services provider.In a telephonic conversation, Tikkam was presented with a hazy picture of what this assignment was all about. Tarun being more of a family friend than a business associate, Tikkam did not press hard for the details. He took a bus with six others to Jodhpur, and boarded the train to Chennai Central Station.The building housing their work station being a skip, hop and a jump away from the railway station, Tikkam did not have to wait long before the picture got clearer.Owned by Shri Rajendra Suri Jain Trust, the building had been allowed to function as a community kitchen during the lockdown. Straight away, Tikkam and his men learnt about the scale and significance of their work: Cooking food for a minimum of 2,500 persons every day, and these would be people who are homeless and hungry.Tarun has launched the initiative of providing free food to the poor during the lockdown, through New Indian Charitable Trust.

Of family members assembling at one place, women in the household cooking together and a large table filled with Indian Jewish delicacies. Food is also all those different flavours that used to come from the kitchen. We make a sweet puri where the dough is made with coconut milk and jaggery and it goes with a spicy curry. These combinations of flavours you will not understand if you havent tasted it, says Esther.While she offers such tidbits on Indian Jewish cuisine from Ahmedabad over a phone call, with her book Bene Apptit: The Cuisine of Indian Jews, she takes readers on a gastronomic journey of recipes from five Jewish communities across India Bene Israel Jews of western India, the Cochin Jews of Kerala, the Baghdadi Jews of Kolkata, the Bene Ephraim Jews of Andhra Pradesh and the Bnei Menashe Jews of Manipur and Mizoram. The book walks us through their dietary law, festivals, recipes, and how each of their cuisines is influenced by Indian cuisine.The journeyEsthers books The Book of Esther, Book of Rachel, Shalom India Housing Society, to name a few  have revolved around the Indian Jewish community. The juxtaposition of the plot and her recipes builds a rousing appetite for the story and the tummy. It was never conscious. In one story, I used a popular recipe by Indian Jews, a black pepper sauce to create a dark moment between the characters.Likewise, I use food to take the plot ahead, she offers. One question and several years of research led Esther to write this book. I attend a lot of literary conferences meant for Jewish writers. At one such conference, in France, I was asked Is there something called Indian Jewish cuisine? And this made me more curious, she says.So from 2017 to 2019, Esther travelled, meeting members of the different communities. Starting from Alibaug in Maharashtra where the community was said to be formed after a shipwreck 2,000 years ago Esther travelled to Machilipatnam in Andhra Pradesh, Kochi, Kolkata, Imphal and Aizawl, where she was treated to a variety of dishes.Cook, eat, repeatHer guide through all these years of research was Julie Joseph Pingle wife of the cantor of the Ahmedabad synagogue Joseph Samuel Pingle who Esther says, knows all the traditional dishes. After returning from her trips, Esther would recreate the dishes with her help. When I started writing I realised that one has to be so particular and really make it to know how a recipe tastes.Without knowing how it tastes, you cant write about it. My sources sent me photos of many recipes with details, or the person who gave me the information translated the recipes to English. Some recipes have a regional touch but always eaten following dietary laws. Some recipes have subtle influences of the country where Jews came to India from like Israel, Middle East, Far East and Spain, she shares.While the book reveals some closely-guarded recipes like chik-cha-halva, rose biscuits, jumping potatoes, Jewish biryani, pakoda curry and many more, it is hard not to notice that most of the recipes have an Indian influence too. And whats more, they have even adopted some famous Indian dishes like puran poli and meen pollichathu into their cuisine. We make dumplings.Some Jewish communities in India are not a fan of it as it is bland, but it is very popular in the west. So, we add Indian elements to it. The same goes for sweets too. The recipes may look similar to Indian dishes, but there are subtle differences. Youll find the use of coconut milk, tamarind, poppy seedswhich appear similar to Indian dishes but they are not, she says.Making memoriesIt is hard for Esther to pick out a favourite dish, but two recipes stay etched in her memory for different reasons. In the synagogue in Machilipatnam, where I was the host familys guest, they made fish eggs. This is a delicacy and it is only made for special guests, so I was deeply touched. I was reminded of my childhood when we ate fish eggs, but now they are rare.This dish is a form of respect given to a person. And the other favourite is the black rice pudding chak-hao. I was amazed. I am not very much into sweets but in this case I was carried away. The whole idea of black rice and coconut milk cooking for hours, and the play of colours as the black rice slowly turns deep purple the memory is very close to me, she details. When a community decreases in number, its traditional food becomes a memory, writes Esther in her book. But what she also heartily notes is that the elders and the youngsters of the Indian Jewish families she met are trying hard to preserve every last bit of their culture and cuisine.Laws of Indian Jewish cuisineThe vessels for milk dishes and meat dishes are different. You cant use one for the other for at least five hours after the first use.Since Indian Jews often have roti or paratha with their curries, they make sure to not add ghee on top of the breads as their dietary law does not permit the mixing of dairy and meat.In accordance with the dietary law, Indian Jews substitute milk with coconut milk while having a non-vegetarian meal.On the bookshelfBook: Bene Apptit: The Cuisine of Indian JewsPages: 199, Price: Rs 399Publisher: Harper Collins India",Inside the Indian Jewish kitchen,RICE

But every cyclone throws up new challenges to the Sunderbans and its inhabitants  something the people had not imagined, and policy makers are not prepared for.Over just the past three years, the Sunderbans, which is home to close to five million people, has been battered by four tropical cyclones  Fani (May 2019), Bulbul (November 2019), Amphan (May 2020) and Yaas (May 2021). On each occasion, the region has suffered damage because of gale winds and breached embankments, leading to ingress of sea water.In pictures | Cyclone Yaas uproots lifeThe intensity of the gale winds has ranged from 100 kmph to 150 kmph during each of the cyclones.Experts say the solution to the perennial problem lies in long-term planning, adopting strategies that will minimise the impact of climate change, and disaster management suited to the region.Unprecedented surgeWhen the State administration launched a massive evacuation drive earlier this week on May 24 and May 25, little did the residents know that though Cyclone Yaas made landfall about 200 km south of the Sunderbans in Odisha, it would inundate large areas of the estuary. The cumulative effect of the full moon tide on May 26 and the cyclone led to the overflowing and breach of embankments in large areas of the Sunderbans.Also read | Hungry tides of the Sunderbans: How the rising seas create environmental migrantsWhile the India Meteorological Department had predicted a storm surge of 2 m above the astronomical tide level, water in the river and bay swelled due to full moon tide. As a result, on May 26 morning as Cyclone Yaas made landfall, large areas were inundated.Under waterThree days after the cyclone, several areas of Sunderbans remain inundated, forcing people to huddle in cyclone shelters or spend days on embankments.The entire island with a population of 3,500 people is flooded. I have spent the past three days in the rescue centre near the panchayat office. Today, we got 1 kg of rice per person from the panchayat.

Ms. Sajera Bibi said the devastation caused by Yaas has been the most severe, something she has not seen in the past 40 years.Our relatives in Sagar are telling us to leave this place and move there. But how can we go when water is all around, she asked.Sagar Island, the biggest island of the Sundarbans chain and site of the famous Gangasagar Mela during Makar Sankranti, has also suffered damage.

We do not know whom and where to seek help and how to tell people of the situation in which we are living, she said.Another island in the western part of Sunderbans, the boat-shaped Mousuni, is also under water.Not only islands, but even coastal areas like Kakdwip, Namkhana and Frasergunj have been submerged.Not only the western part of Sunderbans that faces Bay of Bengal but large parts in Gosaba and Sandeshkhali block, in the eastern part of the delta remain under water three days after the cyclone and the high tide.At Kumirmari, located in a remote part of Gosaba, embankments have been breached in at least ten places and water from Raimangal river has overflowed. On Saturday morning at least 450 people were at the camp at Kumirmari Narendrapur flood centre as it is impossible for them to return to their villages, Pranabesh Maity said.Sanjay Mondal who operates a tourist boat Sundarban Safari often taking people to remote islands said there is a scarcity of drinking water because of inundation.Also read | Honey collectors of Sunderbans switch to apiculture to fend off tiger attacksAt Kumirmari and Choto Mollarkhali we are trying to send drinking water and operate a community kitchen. People of Sundarbans can fight fiercest of cyclones but when saline water enters their habitation, they are helpless, says Mr. Mondal.Once the sea water enters the islands, not only are dwelling units destroyed but the crops are inundated and land cannot be cultivated because of the salinity, even the fish in the ponds die. The Sunderbans also has a high density of population where people survive on frugal economic means.Engineering shortfallDuring the administrative review meetings carried out to assess the impact of the cyclone, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee stressed on a permanent solution for the Sunderbans and low-lying coastal areas. We repair the embankments every year and then a cyclone comes, and we have to repair it again. It is likely putting money in the water, she said.Also read | Sunderbans home to 428 species of birds, records ZSISunderbans has embankments of 3,250 km, and we have to look beyond engineering solutions, says Tuhin Ghosh, director of School of Oceanographic Studies, Jadavpur University.

Despite the announcement of creating a separate district for Sunderbans, the proposal is yet to be implemented, says Ajanta Dey of the Commission on Ecosystems Management (CEM)-International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN).

There has been no follow up on the matter, experts say, and lack of scientific information in dealing with a complex estuarine delta which has become a hot spot of climate change is emerging as a challenge for the policy makers. Life for those residing on the region has become a daily struggle.The cyclones and the tides also pose a challenge to conservation efforts of flagship species which are unique to the ecosystem.

Chandrasekhar Rao has said that the State government will ask the Centre to lift the entire food grain produced in Telangana like Punjab.He expressed unhappiness that the procurement of rice by the Food Corporation of India (FCI) was cent per cent in Punjab but not so in Telangana. He will write a letter against the bias shown by the Centre towards the State, Mr. Rao told an official meeting on Saturday to discuss the arrangements for the ensuing agricultural season.Mr. Rao asked agriculture officers to promote the technique of tossing paddy seed on fields for sowing purposes instead of raising nurseries and taking up transplantation. This will save an expenditure of over 10,000 crore on one crore acres that farmers will cultivate in two crops. This will also result in additional yield of one to two quintals of paddy for every acre. The agriculture department should take up an extensive campaign on the technique to sensitise farmers, he said.The system will help farmers cultivate paddy crop without even stepping into slush. It will reduce dependence on labour and water usage will also come down by 30 to 35%.The crop will mature for harvest 10-15 days earlier.In normal circumstances, he said that 25 kg seed was needed for every acre. But, this technique will require only eight kg. There was no time frame for supplying water after sowing of seed. It would be much better to wait for rains for natural wetting of the crop.Mr. Rao said that the technique would be of much use to farmers in all zones, including the ayacut of Kaleshwaram and other irrigation projects, lift irrigation schemes and borewells. He had studied the system from farmers in Khammam district and had himself reaped good harvest in his own fields. Machinery to spray the seed was also available in the market.Warning against the availability of spurious seed, he called up the Director General of Police over phone and asked him to track down such sellers. The Inspector General of Intelligence was also asked to keep an eye on such manufacturers.If agriculture officers were found to be in nexus with dealers of spurious seed, Mr. Rao said they should not only be dismissed from service but sent to jail for five years.

(Photo: The New York Times)The prison was already packed, its population more than double its 5,000-person capacity. Recent prisoners include two American journalists and an Australian economic adviser. Hundreds of pro-democracy protesters have also been crammed in, some with fresh gunshot wounds.For 134 years, Insein Prison has stood as a monument to brutality and authoritarian rule in Myanmar. Built by British colonizers to help subjugate the population, the pizza-shaped penitentiary became infamous for its harsh conditions and the torture of prisoners during a half-century of military dictatorship.Now, with the Myanmar military back in control after a Feb. 1 coup, the aging prison has become a central part of the continuing crackdown against the pro-democracy movement in the Southeast Asian nation. The junta has detained more than 4,300 people since February, according to a rights group. The primary destination has been Insein, the most prominent of 56 penitentiaries.Perhaps fittingly, its name is pronounced insane.In interviews with The New York Times, a retired Insein prison guard and 10 former prisoners painted a portrait of appalling conditions and human misery at the notorious institution. Many said they fear a new generation of political prisoners will be forced to endure the same horrific treatment if the military is allowed to remain in charge.A notorious colonial-era prison in Myanmar has, since the coup, been used to incarcerate journalists and dissidents. A notorious colonial-era prison in Myanmar has, since the coup, been used to incarcerate journalists and dissidents.There are more political prisoners now than decades ago, said Bo Kyi, who co-founded the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, an advocacy group, and who served two stints at Insein the 1990s. If we cannot remove the military and restore democracy, these political prisoners will suffer like I did.During the first period of military rule, from 1962 to 2011, the penal system often held thousands of political prisoners at a time. At Insein, they were usually kept in cells with primitive sewage disposal and only thin blankets and a hard surface to sleep on. They received meager, barely edible rations, with tendon and bone as a substitute for meat, and rice adulterated with sand and small stones.Former political prisoners from that era say they were frequently beaten and sometimes burned, given electric shocks, forced to crawl across jagged rocks and locked in kennels intended for dogs. Interrogators would put salt in a prisoners wound or hold a plastic bag over his head until he passed out.The powerful military intelligence branch once kept an interrogation center at Insein, summoning prisoners day or night for torture sessions. The prisoners would be placed in leg irons and beaten, sometimes to the point of unconsciousness, Amnesty International reported in 1995.Aung San Suu Kyi, Myanmars de facto civilian leader who was detained in the coup, spent time at Insein in 2003 and 2009. Win Tin, a journalist and the co-founder of Suu Kyis National League Democracy party, was there for 19 years before he was released in 2008. (He died in 2014.) Both were imprisoned for their opposition to military rule.But even during the five years when Suu Kyi headed Myanmars civilian government in a power-sharing agreement with the generals, hundreds of political prisoners were locked up at Insein for offending the military or the government. Two Reuters reporters who uncovered a massacre of Rohingya Muslims in Rakhine State were held there for more than 16 months.Today, more journalists are finding themselves behind those same prison walls.In March, the authorities arrested Nathan Maung, a U.S. citizen, and Hanthar Nyein, co-founders of the online news site Kamayut Media. Before arriving at Insein, they were held for weeks at a nearby interrogation center and severely beaten, burned and forced to kneel on ice with their hands cuffed behind them, The Committee to Protect Journalists said. They are accused of undermining the military.U Gambira in Australia.

(Photo: The New York Times)The abuse their families report in detention is unconscionable, said Shawn Crispin, the groups senior Southeast Asia representative.Another American journalist, Danny Fenster, managing editor of Frontier Myanmar, was arrested Monday at the Yangon airport as he prepared to leave the country and was taken to the prison, the publication said. His wife said Friday that she was awaiting permission to see him.On Friday, the State Department said it was deeply concerned by the detention of the two American journalists and called on the regime to free them. Consular officials have not been allowed to see Fenster.The detention of Daniel and Nathan, as well as arrest and use of violence by the Burmese military against other journalists, constitutes an unacceptable attack on freedom of expression in Burma, the State Department said, using Myanmars former name.Yuki Kitazumi, a Japanese journalist who was accused of spreading false news, was held there before being deported in May. Others now at the prison include Thura Aung Ko, the ousted minister of religious affairs and culture, and Sean Turnell, an Australian who was Suu Kyis economic adviser.When Suu Kyi headed the civilian government, conditions at the prison gradually improved. Inmates were allowed to watch television and have books. The International Committee of the Red Cross built a new family visit facility. But the situation has rapidly deteriorated.After the coup, prisoners were barred from going outdoors or watching television, except for channels controlled by the regime. Visits by family members have been cut back and communication with the outside world restricted. Often, family members searching for arrested relatives learn whether they are being held at the facility by taking food for them and seeing if the prison accepts it.Military courts are once again convening inside the prison and handing down harsh sentences.The conditions now are similar to the conditions before 2010, said Swe Win, co-founder and editor of the news outlet Myanmar NOW. Swe Win served seven years at Insein and other prisons for distributing pamphlets and participating in a protest as a student.For many recent prisoners, sometimes the first stop is the infirmary to be treated for wounds. Satirical slam poet Paing Ye Thu was sent to Insein in 2019 for mocking the generals. He was serving a six-year sentence when the military staged its February coup. Conditions worsened overnight, he said.High-profile detainees soon arrived, including ousted government officials. He saw about three dozen injured protesters, including some who had been shot, waiting for medical treatment.I was shocked, Paing Ye Thu, a leader of the Peacock Generation Thangyat troupe, said after his release under a general amnesty in April. I didnt expect that so many people with gunshot wounds would be arrested and sent directly to prison.The prison was built on the outskirts of Yangon, Myanmars largest city, and currently holds about 13,000 inmates, most of them convicted criminals. Female prisoners are held in a separate building.A former guard, Khin Maung Myint, who worked for 25 years at various prisons, including Insein in 1986 and 1987, said political prisoners were often tortured for minor infractions.If a piece of newspaper was found inside the cell, they tortured the prisoner, and they fired the prison staff, he recalled.One goal of the penal system is to break the spirit of the inmates, said Bo Kyi, the co-founder of the rights group for political prisoners. Some former prisoners have suffered lifelong trauma as a result, he said. Helping them is one aim of the organization, which has painstakingly tracked killings and arrests since the coup.When you are a political prisoner, you do not have basic human rights, even basic prison rights, he said.",They call it ‘insane’: where Myanmar sends political prisoners,RICE

It suggested that the Agriculture department promote red gram cultivation as the crop had high demand in market. Since the demand for boiled rice was declining in neighbouring States, it was assessed that cotton would fetch higher profits in future. At the same time, the Cabinet discussed the possibility of higher demand for fine varieties of rice.It was noted that the two crop seasons last year resulted in a production of three crore tonnes of foodgrains.A release said the meeting wanted steps to promote setting up of more rice mills in the State as paddy production went up considerably.The farmers committees appointed by the government under the Rytu Bandhu programme should be activated and continuous training programmes held for them.

The answer is lack of political will as well as no vision of the successive governments towards diversification of crops, farmer leaders say.Punjab used to cultivate almost 8 times more area under oilseeds than what is is cultivating now.Data sourced from the Punjab Agriculture University (PAU) Ludhiana, revealed that in 1967-68, Punjab had 3.99 lakh hectares area under oilseeds cultivation (which was maximum in its history since 1960-61).This area reduced to 48,900 hectares (provisional) in 2019-20 which is over 8 times less in area than what it was over five decades back. Also the total production then was 3.14 lakh tonnes, which came down to around 56,000 tonnes in 2018-19.Earlier, groundnut, sesamum, cotton (kharif crops) while sunflower, rapeseed and mustard (rabi crops) used to be grown in large areas.The area under groundnut cultivation was 2.22 lakh hectares in 1967-68 which has now come down to just 1,800 hectares. While the production has come down from 2.40 lakh tonnes to 3,600 tonnes but the yield has increased from 1,024 kg to 1,980 kg per hectare because of good quality of seeds.Similarly, area of rapeseed/mustard has come down to around 3,800 hectares from 1.80 lakh hectares five decades back and the production is now 57,000 tonnes against the then 1.40 lakh tonnes. The per hectare yield of this crop has doubled from 778 kg to 1,478 kg per hectare.Sunflower, which was introduced in Punjab in the early 1990s, had 1.03 lakh hectares in 1995-96 which has now reduced to 4,400 hectares and its production came down from 1.61 lakh tonnes to 8,300 tonnes. However, its yield has increased from 1,566 kg to 1,886 kg per hectare now.Seamum was cultivated in 25,600 hectares in 1974-75 which has come down to 41,000 hectares now while its yield too has decreased from 359 kg to 345 kg per hectares.Talking to The Indian Express, Dr Virender Sardana, Principal Agronomist (oilseeds) at PAU, said, Punjab is blessed to have agro-climatic conditions that are best suited for growing both kharif and rabi season oilseeds. We had been a big producer of these crops till the onset of the Green Revolution when farmers moved to wheat-paddy cycle. It is because of the assured market price that the farmers have got used to. Demand for oilseeds in India is huge. What it calls for is only a little impetus and focused approach of the state government. Paddy is a known water-guzzling crop, and we are not exporting rice but exporting our precious ground blue water.Fortunately, almost all the sarson (mustard) grown in Punjab is Canola sarson, which is the best among all varieties from a health point of view and Punjab can become the leading producer of this crop in the country too. As much Punjab moves to oilseeds, it dependence on the central government will reduce, which has of late, been putting difficult conditions on the state and its farmers just before the wheat and paddy procurment season, he said.Even if Punjab government buys Canola sarson directly from farmers and export it under its own established brands such as Sohna of Markfed, it will soon run out of stock as the well-developed western markets of Europe and North America only use Canola Sarson for human consumption and no other, he said, adding that Sohnas Sarson da Saag is already a big hit among NRIs settled in Europe, Australia and North America.Farmers would be far more than happy to cultivate Canola sarson instead of wheat as it consumes less water, less time and less input cost while its MSP is also quite good, he said.Currently, the total consumption of oil in the state is around 0.54 million tonnes to 0.60 million tonnes. According to the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare data, the per capita oil consumption of India is around 19.5 kg.Going by this calculation, Punjabs consumption will come around to 0.54 million tonnes as Punjab has 2.77 crore population. And this consumption is 2.07% of countrys total oil consumption.Punjabs gross cropped area in 2018-19 was estimated at 78.30 lakh hectares (lh). Out of that, 35.20 lh was under wheat cultivation and another 31.03 lh under paddy, adding up to 84.6% of the total area planted to all crops. That ratio was just over 32% in 1960-61 and 47.4% in 1970-71. This was the result of the Green Revolution.Punjab needs to divert at least 10-12 lakh hectares to other crops. The state can easily increase area under oilseeds by reviving areas under groundnut, sesame, cotton, mustard oil, sunflower and these crops can be easily grown on 10 to 15 hecatres during kharif and rabi seasons collectively. But the state government needs to support its farmers just like other state government do if the MSP of any crop goes down, said Jagmohan Singh, general secretary, BKU (Dakuanda), adding that farmers can grow anything provided he gets an assured market for his produce.Why is the government unable to keep a corpus of few 100 crores for crops other than wheat and paddy for support in case of need, asks a farmer.",Shift from paddy-wheat cycle to oilseeds isn’t as difficult as it appears for Punjab,RICE

Kaarla in Tulu means Karkala.Karkala MLA V. Sunil Kumar, who has taken the initiative, told The Hindu that the free seed distribution in his Assembly constituency covering Karkala and Hebri taluks began on June 1 and it will go on for a fortnight to cover 20,000 families.Though white okra is cultivated in other parts of the coastal belt, the type cultivated in Karkala and its surrounding areas grows one feet in length. Hence the campaign has been launched to make it a brand of Karkala.Its seeds have been procured from some local farmers and the Zonal Agricultural and Horticultural Research Station, Brahmavar, in Udupi district. The seeds are being distributed through the help of gram panchayat members to three category of growers. They are being given to those who will grow them within their compound walls in pots, growbags or in their kitchen garden; in about 10 to 15 cents of land; and to those who will take up its cultivation large scale on 25 cents of land and more.Stating that the bili bende began to yield in two months of planting, Mr. Kumar said that people will be urged to make any one dish out of it during functions and events in their houses to promote its vast use locally. Marketing link will be arranged to large growers to sell them in cities.A written material on how to cultivate the variety and its pest management is being circulated on social media to reach to people.Naveenchandra Jain, president of Parampara Multipurpose Cooperative Society, Karkala, which has also joined the campaign said that the white okra has high fibre content. A variety of dishes can be made from it.Earlier, in January, the MLA had launched an initiative to promote the cultivation and marketing of a local variety of boiled rice under the brand name Kaarla Kaje which is being marked by the same cooperative society.The MLA said that both the brand building activities have been taken up under vocal4local initiative.Mr. Kumar said that the cultivation of Kaarla Kaje will be promoted among 1,000 farmers in the current kharif season.",A campaign to brand white okra launched in Karkala,RICE

As many schools continue to remain shut, a majority of private school teachers in Kadapa district had not been paid their salaries for months, and thus have to borrow money from friends/relatives or institutions to make ends meet. Many of them had been teaching for years, and find it hard to take up any other profession to earn a livelihood. Even getting temporary jobs have become a tough task for them.Explaining their troubles, the private teachers have urged the state government to come to their rescue and issue them emergency ration and financial assistance, similar to a scheme in implementation in Telangana.Before Covid pandemic, private school teachers and lecturers led a respectable life despite getting paid much less than their government counterparts.Even without job security, they gave their all to their profession. But today, when they are experiencing many troubles as educational institutions are closed due to Covid, managements, which had made them work tirelessly, are not even consoling them let alone helping them with any financial assistance, said Naresh, district general secretary of a union of private teachers and lecturers.He noted that the Telangana government took a humanitarian approach and provided 25 kgs of rice and Rs 2,000 per month to private school teachers and other staff till the schools reopen. The decision has helped 1.5 lakh private school teachers and staff in our neighbouring state. It is high time that our Chief Minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy also take similar measures.Kadapa district is home to around 700 private schools that employ 10,000 teachers. A majority of the staff are graduates, post graduates or have qualified BEd and MEd courses. If the schools in the entire state are taken into account, then their numbers will run into several lakhs.Most of us do not know anything else than teaching. We are ready to do even menial jobs, but getting them have become a huge task due to curfew restrictions now.

He has never played as a midfielder in his senior Liverpool career, though, only in its youth team.Maguire missed the final five games of Manchester United's season because of an ankle ligament injury while Henderson, Liverpool's captain, hasn't played since February due to a groin problem.Southgate picked both of them, perhaps keen to have their leadership in a larger-than-usual squad allowed for Euro 2020, though they might be unavailable for the first Group D game against Croatia on June 13.The most complex part of this time has been those injuries and whether we should take the chance on people,"" Southgate said. With Jordan and Harry Maguire, we have a couple of players who are not where theyd be ideally in terms of their physical prep. But we think the experience they have, the fact that we think we can get them to a point where they can have an involvement in the tournament, its worth taking them, especially as weve got an extended squad of 26.Greenwood withdrew from contention early Tuesday in order to recover fully from an underlying injury, his club, Manchester United, said.Southgate had given himself an extra week to decide his final 26 players because 12 potential picks were playing in European club finals last week, with Manchester United, Manchester City and Chelsea.England will play a Euro 2020 warmup against Austria on Wednesday, and another against Romania on Sunday.After the Croatia game at Wembley Stadium, Southgates team plays Scotland and the Czech Republic at the same venue.

First, it was cyclone Amphan, then COVID and now, Yaas.Jana and Mondal are among thousands of people living in the Namkhana block  one of the worst-affected in the Sunderbans region in West Bengals South 24 Parganas district who have lost their homes and livelihoods due to the cyclone.Jana, who lives in the Narayanpur village, was planning to cast the roof of his house this summer with the grant provided by the government.I started working on the house last year, completed the structure and got the first tranche of Rs 60,000. A few weeks back, I bought the construction materials and hoped to cast the roof but then the cyclone hit. Everything got washed away, he said.Read | Mamata skips PM cyclone meeting as Adhikari attends; Centre recalls her top official to DelhiI planted brinjal and sponge gourd this season. Everything is destroyed. I dont know what will we do for the next one year, he said, trying hard to hold back his tears.The highway, which leads to Namkhana and ends at the beach in Bakkhali, was lined with trucks and pick-up vans that came from far and wide with relief materials  the efforts led mostly by community clubs.Tapas Banerjee was part of one such group that came with dry food and other relief materials all the way from Asansol, around 300 km away.We collected relief materials from the people of our area in Burnpur and came here. As part of Nababikash Club, we try to help people throughout the year. Besides, we have given Rs 1 lakh to the state government for the relief efforts, he said, managing a large queue of people that had gathered for packets of puffed rice, flattened rice and baby food, among others.At first, we went to Mousuni Island. What we saw there was horrific  nothing was left. The tourist camps have been swept away. Seawater entered the water bodies where prawns were cultivated, killing all the produce.Dont really know how these people will survive, Banerjee said, as someone nearby prompted, We bought 15 kg prawn on our way back at Rs 150 a kg. We couldnt resist, prawns of this size would usually cost Rs 600-650 per kg.Mousuni Island, which has become a popular camping destination over the years, is the most-affected of the seven panchayat areas in Namkhana, Block Development Officer Shantanu Singha Thakur told PTI.The population of the block is around 2 lakh as per the 2011 Census and almost 50 per cent of the population is affected. More than the cyclone, the astronomical tide caused by the full moon that day has impacted the area. It is now under control and we are working round the clock, he said.We shifted 62,000 people to rescue centres ahead of the cyclone following all COVID protocols. We are operating 162 community kitchens at present to provide cooked food twice a day, and also giving them snacks, Thakur said.Thakurs office, the field station for the rescue and relief efforts, was also under water till two days back. Most parts of the complex were still inundated with officers often stumbling upon fish such as koi and shoal.In the last one week, we barely had time to make out whether its day or night outide. We have been working, eating and napping here, said an officer, pointing to the makeshift bed in his cabin.We are trying to reach out to people with all the help as fast as possible. Hopefully, the situation will improve as Mora Kotal or low tidal variation has set in, he said, refusing to be named as he was not authorised to speak to the media.Overhearing the conversation, a man who worked at the BDO office said, You should have asked him why is there such a situation every time? Why couldnt the embankments be made of concrete?They will build mud embankments every year and those will be breached. What is the use? We will continue to live like this throughout our lives it seems, he said before rushing out to help an officer with some work.Outside the complex, a truck stood with a machine that was churning out drinking water pouches.If operated from 7 am to 11 pm, it can produce 80-90,000 pouches of 200 ml each. It has come all the way from Burdwan, said the supervisor as he kept a log and prodded the workers to ensure zero wastage.Besides, 2,000-litre tankers are being sent to the villages on motor-operated vans as a drinking water crisis has engulfed the area.Shibshankar Mondal, who drives one such van, said though the job was painstaking, it gave him some satisfaction that he was helping people who are facing such hardships.I live in Kakdwip block and my house is also under water. But, I could manage to save my van, said Mondal, who otherwise ferries people.These tanks are used during the Gangasagar Mela, and were lying in the store. Its good that someone thought about using it now, he said, adding that he was being paid Rs 1,500 per day along with sufficient petrol  a boon given that he earned Rs 700-800 a day earlier, but that stopped owing to the lockdown.Thakur said drinking water was being provided to 60-70 per cent of the area, as the tube wells were damaged due to the saline water.I wont say that allegations over the embankments are absolutely false. The work is done by the Irrigation Department. We have raised the issue with them. The fact is, a cyclone has hit the area every six months in the last three years; so we couldnt get the minimum time for implementing a long-term solution, he said.However, the department has been told that new embankments should sustain for long. Also, apart from the breaches, the tidal waves were so huge that water overflowed into the villages. The tidal waves were around 12-13 feet high, and to deal with that, we need to build embankments as high as the Great Wall of China, the BDO said.Towards the end of the highway at Bakkhali sea beach, around 25 km away, a few shops selling cold drinks and cigarettes had mounds of sand to fend with.The sea waves almost touched the shops one kilometre away. See the mounds of sand inside the fridge. I dont know how to clean this, and the machine has now stopped working.I invested Rs 20,000 for the fridge. If it becomes non-functional, what will I do? said one of the shopkeepers, as he got busy with a group from Bhangore that went to the beach to bath, after distributing relief materials.","Dead fish, flooded fields, submerged homes in cyclone-ravaged Sunderbans, fight for life and livelihood",RICE

We were not.A soldier unloading the supplies grabbed the man as he screamed, though his cries were inaudible over the blast of the rotors. The soldier wrestled with the man before the helicopter crew member sent them rolling out the door. The aircraft pulled off the ground in a rush of air and speed, skimming the roofs of nearby houses before catapulting upward. The whole thing took about 60 seconds.I first arrived here in Marja as a 22-year-old Marine corporal during one of the wars earlier chapters, when the U.S. military still thought it could beat the Taliban into submission enough for the Afghan security forces to take over the fight. There are no Americans at these bases anymore, and barely any in southern Afghanistan, as the U.S. military prepares to leave by September (though it could be earlier).A U.S. marine in Marja, in the Helmand Province of Afghanistan, Feb. 18, 2010. (The New York Times) A U.S. marine in Marja, in the Helmand Province of Afghanistan, Feb. 18, 2010. (The New York Times)Marja today is nothing like what U.S. military officials envisioned so many yearsago. It is a microcosm of failed counterinsurgency strategies, abandoned development projects and costly drug eradication campaigns, and the hundreds, if not thousands, of wounded and dead Afghans and Americans.The end result: two remaining government-controlled outposts surrounded by Taliban fighters.Exactly 11 years earlier, on May 14, 2010, I found myself at Forward Operating Base Marja, one of the two bases we flew to in May, for the memorial service of my friend, Sgt. Josh Desforges. He had been killed two days before in a vicious firefight in a sector simply called the Zulus.The whole platoon was there. Guys I had not seen for what seemed like eternity. We hugged and laughed, even though the next day we knew we would wear sunglasses so no one could see us crying.That was the third month of Operation Moshtarak, the big show of President Barack Obamas troop surge that was supposed to turn the tide of the war. We landed in February that year, securing Marja with the Afghan militarys earliest attempt at an army. A government was brought in and installed  a so-called government in a box, a select group of Afghan officials to replace the Talibans local leadership.The Marja mission  with around 15,000 troops  was supposed to showcase this new but ultimately ineffective strategy.Touching down again this month, there was little evidence that could explain why my friends, and so many Afghan civilians and soldiers, died here.We rode in an Afghan Black Hawk helicopter with the call sign Eagle 6-4. Lt. Jack McCain, son of the late Sen. John McCain, had in recent years helped train these Afghan pilots as a Navy adviser.Helicopter supply missions in Helmand are exceedingly dangerous, and most trips to the bases in Marja are to pick up the dead and wounded. The aircraft are frequently shot at, and among the pilots, the Marja missions are spoken of with fear and dread.It was the second day of a three-day cease-fire for the Eid-al-Fitr holiday, and the two helicopters were on a resupply mission, delivering live sheep, ammunition, potatoes, onions, milk and various other items to the men isolated on these bases with little more than rifles, machine guns and mortars. The sheep were bound and stuffed in grain bags, petrified, struggling to break free. The crew calmed the animals as best they could.The Black Hawks departed from the Afghan base wedged between Camp Leatherneck and Camp Bastion, vast hubs used by the Americans and the British at the height of the war. Now they are basically just pillaged ruins aside from the still functional airfield. In 2019, when the Taliban overtook part of the camp, U.S. jets had to bomb one of the warehouses where the insurgents had barricaded themselves.

(The New York Times)After the Kem bazaar run, we grabbed the next tranche of supplies and flew over the city, this time heading south to FOB Marja, now known as Camp Nowruz. Marja is often referred to as a city, but it is really just a bunch of villages within opium-poppy fields atop a U.S. agricultural project that looked like a well-defined grid from above.From the window I could see the Koru Chareh bazaar, a pork chop-shaped village that we had assaulted in the early hours of the operation on Feb. 13, 2010. I could see the roof where two members of my team were shot at the end of that day, the distinct plus-shaped part of the roof clearly visible even through the smudged glass.Cpl. Matt Tooker, my second in command, the teams anchor and my close friend, had walked to the edge before he was shot twice in the arm. We had dragged him to cover, working to put on a tourniquet as I tried to assure him everything was going to be OK. He died a little more than a year later in a motorcycle accident. The other Marine, who was shot in the chest, returned to Marja a few weeks later.And there was the field where I said goodbye to Josh. The mosque where we were ambushed. The house where I told the team that Josh was dead. The patrol base we built, COP Turbett, named after the engineer, Cpl. Jacob Turbett, who was killed at the beginning of the assault, was gone along with any evidence of its existence. The parking lot and tents were once again a field, just as we had found it more than a decade ago, as if we had never been there.Once more, I was wearing sunglasses so no one in the helicopter could see me crying.We began the descent into FOB Marja, its blueprint vaguely the way I remembered it. There was a new district center building, but the old skeleton of our base remained, the motor pool still distinguishable as was the spot of ground where we set chairs and a stage and the rifle tucked between boots for Joshs memorial service. The buildings around it seemed almost completely destroyed: Years of shelling and firefights between the Taliban and U.S. and then Afghan forces had taken its toll.We landed as we had before, violently. The sheep were thrown off along with the food and ammunition. This time five soldiers left with us, their stay at the surrounded outpost having expired. Clustered in the back of the helicopter they took selfies, smiles wide. The aircraft crew passed them their Gatorades. They were ecstatic to get out alive.One soldier, who declined to give his name, said little but only that this group had been at the base for the last two years.Its a dangerous place, and theres no food, he said later.As we banked up and into the air, Marja receding into the distance, I couldnt help but think of the opening line of my friends eulogy for Josh  spoken 11 years ago a few hundred yards from where the Afghan soldiers clambered aboard the helicopter. The platoon had assembled, uniforms dirty and well-worn, the day getting warmer and the deployment far from over.He began: So how about that ride in?","A siege, a supply run and a descent into a decade-old battle",RICE

Economies in Latin America and the Caribbean will not regain their previous per-capita income until 2024, the IMF projected.The IMF and the World Bank ""early on understood that the crisis and the economic recession... would be very broad and very deep,"" said Homi Kharas, an economist at the Brookings Institution They pushed the G20 and private creditors to suspend debt payments for dozens of low-income countries.""That was the first major step in ensuring that the pandemic didn't trigger a debt crisis that could have longer term consequences,"" Kharas said in an interview.The IMF itself extended direct debt relief to 29 of its ""poorest and most vulnerable members,"" doubled its emergency funding limits and tripled its concessional resources.""The IMF stepped up as never before, lending some $110 billion to 84 countries since the start of the pandemic,"" fund spokesman Gerry Rice told AFP.""Lending to sub-Saharan Africa in the first year of the pandemic was 13 times the annual average.""Meanwhile, the World Bank has committed over $108 billion during the pandemic in more than 100 countries to respond to ""the fastest and largest crisis"" in the institution's history, the bank's chief of operations Axel van Trotsenburg said.""We are using all the firepower we have,"" he said in an email.However, critics note that help for middle-income countries has lagged.""These countries, including many in Latin America, had really been almost left to themselves, to their own devices,"" since they are not eligible for the debt service suspension initiative nor the low-cost loans available to the poorest countries, Kharas said.Georgieva herself recently recognised the need to review lending criteria to reach these economies, but the priority now has moved to the effort to immunizs at least 40 per cent of the world's population by the end of the year and at least 60 per cent by the end of 2022.In the bid to ramp up vaccination programs, ""The World Bank has made $12 billion available... and expects to have projects for around $4 billion in 50 countries by mid-year,"" van Trotsenburg said.But observers are pressing the institutions to do more, faster.""The issue with the World Bank is their rate of execution,"" said Adnan Mazarei of the Peterson Institute for International Economic, who added the financing to date is ""still a small amount.""Since the start of the pandemic, the IMF ""did a very, very good job of quickly putting out some money"" with few conditions, he said. But now the fund needs ""greater strategic clarity"" on the vaccination goal.Still, the $50 billion plan is a good sign, and the IMF and other organizations should push to ""make sure it is on the table"" at the two-day G7 meeting concluding Saturday, Mazarei said.He notes US President Joe Biden's administration already has shown more support for the multilateral initiatives than his predecessor, including one to boost the IMF's allocation of its reserve currency -- Special Drawing Rights -- by $650 billion.That proposal is expected to be approved in coming weeks.","IMF, World Bank prioritise vaccine access to end pandemic",RICE

However, leather, tea, readymade garments, oil seeds, handicrafts and gems and jewellery, saw a significant dip over the same period.The Federation of Indian Exporters Organisations chief Sharad Kumar Saraf said that 19 out of 30 major product groups have recorded impressive growth over May 2020, and the gradual opening up of major global markets is bolstering orders.ICRA chief economist Aditi Nayar attributed the contraction in the trade deficit to $6.3 billion in May from $15.1 billion in April 2021 to the State wise restrictions that widened over May and curbed domestic demand for both gold and oil.A predominant 63% of the decline in the trade deficit in May 2021 relative to April 2021 was on account of the collapse in gold imports, with the balance led by a narrower oil deficit, led both by higher exports and lower imports, she said, adding that exports had displayed a mixed trend.There is a sharp sequential rise in oil exports, even as non-oil exports dipped for the second consecutive month to US$26.9 billion in May 2021 from US$ 31 billion in March 2021. Importantly, non-oil, non-gold imports remained largely steady over April and May. To an extent, rising global commodity prices would have masked a dip in domestic demand, she said.The need of the hour is to soon notify the RoDTEP (Remission of Duties and Taxes on Export Products) rates to remove uncertainty and help expedite new contracts with foreign buyers. The government must address some of the key issues including priority status to exports sector, release of the necessary funds for MEIS and clarity on SEIS benefits, among others, Mr Saraf said.Engineering Exports Promotion Council president Mahesh Desai said the release of assured duty refunds will provide a major push to the sector which recorded a 53% growth in May over last year and 16% over May 2019 levels.

Chidambaram for his criticism of the state of the economy, Minister of State for Finance Anurag Thakur said that it was resilient and would rebound in the times ahead. He cited international agencies projections of India as the only major economy expected to record a double digit growth in 2021-22.Is the Indian economy an island in isolation; have other major economies not faced a GDP contraction? Are you not aware that France, Germany, Italy and the U.K. contracted by 8.2%, 4.9%, 8.9% and 9.9% respectively. Canada, Russia, South Africa and the U.S. too have seen contraction in their GDP in the past year, he stated, referring to the 7.3% contraction in GDP in 2020-21.Also Read Idea of GST is dead, says ChidambaramConsistent reforms have ensured strong fundamentals through these difficult times [so] India had a swift rebound from a contraction of 24.4% in the 1st quarter of FY 2020-21 to a growth of 1.6% in the 4th quarter. India had been resilient despite the disruptions in the globalised world, he noted.I am not surprised that the Former Finance Minister chose to ignore hard data and instead went ahead with whataboutery - the Congress leadership has embodied this clueless approach over the years. Facts belied Mr. Chidambarams advice on initiating cash transfers to people to help cope with the second wave, he said.Mr. Thakur urged Mr. Chidambaram to shift gears from his gloom and doomsday prediction. It was evident that the lockdown saved lives and gradual unlocking allowed green shoots in the economy, as reflected in the record GST collections, growth in auto sales, steel, cement and international air cargo, he pointed out.The Index of Eight Core Industries grew 11.4% in March 2021 and a staggering 56.1% in April 2021 Steel and cement sectors grew 27.3% and 32.7%, respectively, in March 2021. Important to note, since this growth is over and above the pre-lockdown period of March 2020. The two sectors grew 400% & 549% in April 2021, he said.Mr. Thakur told Mr. Chidambaram, While you doubt the resilience of Indian entrepreneurs, small businesses, traders and MSMEs to revive themselves; various international agencies project India to grow by 12.5% in FY 2021-22 making us the only major economy to have a projected double digit growth.Cash Transfers already happeningOn Mr. Chidambarams advice to initiate cash transfers to help the poor cope with the second wave of the pandemic, he cited the higher procurement of wheat, pulses and rice during the NDA (National Democratic Alliance) tenure. He alleged that the Congress had misled farmers on agricultural laws. Today, farmers are happy and have differentiated the truth from the false narrative of Congress leaders, he observed.The 8th instalment of PMKisan via DBTs provided 19,000 crore directly to farmers. Does this not give the farmer cash in hand?, he said. He asked Mr. Chidambaram how many bank accounts were opened for the poor under the UPA (United Progressive Alliance) rule.DBTs [Direct Benefit Transfers] were given under the NSAP [National Social Assistance Programme] to widows, divyangs and senior citizens; under the BoCW (Building and Other Construction Workers) Act to building and construction workers; front-loaded PM-KISAN for farmers and 24% contribution made to EPFO [Employees Provident Fund Organisation] and Ujjwala. The total transfers exceed 68,000 crore. Is that not cash in hand he asked. MGNREGA (Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act) allocations and wages have also been raised to provide cash to workers.Mr. Thakur argued that the UPA government gave out bad loans during Mr. Chidambarams tenure in the Finance Ministry. The government had provided a 3 lakh crore emergency credit line guarantee scheme for industry to sustain.Over  2.65 lakh crore has been sanctioned by public and private sector banks and NBFCs [Non-Banking Financial Company] to over 92 lakh accounts. Does this not provide cash flow for businesses? he concluded.","Nix doomsday forecasts, Anurag Thakur tells Chidambaram",RICE

And since no ones around to judge us when were homebound, how can one not give in to unhealthy but tasty foods? The myth that healthy is not as delicious as the greasy and the fried is easily busted by the variety of millet recipes floating on social media.A versatile ingredient to incorporate into your routine is the kodo millet, which is commonly consumed in the form of idli, dosa, pongal and upma in south India. You could even try making idiyappam, payasam, adai, or soup to experiment with the millet. When we have recipe competitions, people even prepare tasty and nutritious cookies with the millet, says Dr P V Lakshmi, chief dietitian of Gleneagles Global Health City.Known to have originated in tropical Africa, kodo millet or Paspalum scrobiculatum is believed to have been cultivated in India for 3000 years. This fibre-rich crop is quite widespread in the country, adopting a gamut of names in various languages  Kodra (Hindi and Gujarati), Varagu (Tamil), Arikelu (Telugu), and Haraka (Kannada).A drought-resistant crop, kodo can be grown on gravelly, poor soil or loamy, rich soil, in Kharif or Rabi season. The flexibility in its farming process allows it to be grown by farmers in several areas of the nation. Currently, Kodo is cultivated in Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Chhattisgarh, and the Jhum fields of Arunachal Pradesh.The crop is generally grown in warm and dry conditions, where it can survive as little as 40-50 cm rainfall. As a short crop, the millet can be harvested within 100-120 days of planting. The crops are cut close to the ground and then bundled and stacked. After a week, they are threshed and the grains are cleaned by winnowing.While there are endless ways to use millets in your diet, the transition from rice and wheat is extremely sluggish due to some misconceptions. These millets are not boring. They adopt the flavour in which we cook it. Its more like rice. You can make any dish for which you typically use rice, with millets too. Be it carrot rice, tomato rice, sambar rice etc, explains Ashwanandhini Govindarajan, a food regulatory specialist and home chef. She also shares her favourite kodo recipe.The millet is the richest source of fibre in the cereals and millets family. This and other properties of the millet lend various nutritional benefits to its consumers, as further elaborated by Dr Lakshmi.For improved digestionHigh fibre content and low fat make it effective in maintaining a healthy digestive system and help with constipation.Keeps the heart in checkHypertension or high blood pressure is a growing issue in India. Kodo helps control blood pressure and is great for those with hypertension and other cardiac patients due to its high fibre and low fat.Good for weight watchersSince the millet is rich in fibre, kodo is filling even in small quantities. Hence, those who are looking to lose weight or reduce food consumption can opt for this millet.Healthy option for kidney patientsThe millet contains low amounts of phosphorus. This makes it a great food option for kidney patients. People who require peritoneal dialysis due to kidney failure would benefit from consuming kodo.Balances blood sugarA glycemic index indicates how fast a certain food can increase blood glucose levels. With a very low glycemic index, kodo keeps a check on blood sugar and is thus, a great food source for those suf fering from diabetes.Helps those with CholelithiasisCholelithiasis or gallstone formation refers to solid masses formed in the gallbladder or biliary tract, generally due to high cholesterol. Deficient in fat content and abundant in fibre, the millet is good for those suffering from Cholelithiasis.Kodo millet pongalby Ashwanandhini Govindarajan (@ashwanandhinigovindarajan)INGREDIENTSKodo millet:  cupMoong dal: 2.5 tbspWater: 1 cup, Milk: 1 cupGrated ginger:  to 1 tspWhole peppercorn: 1 tspCumin seeds: 1  tspGhee, oil, cashews, curry leaves and salt as requiredPreparation: Soak the millet for 10 minutes before cooking.METHODCook the dal and millet in a pressure cooker on medium flame for 2  whistles.

Are you not aware that France, Germany, Italy, the UK contracted by 8.2 per cent, 4.9 per cent, 8.9 per cent and 9.9 per cent, respectively,"" Thakur said.He also noted that Canada, Russia, South Africa, USA too have seen contraction in their GDP in the past year and that despite the disruptions in the globalised world, India has remained resilient.Further, the minister urged Chidambaram to shift gears from his gloom and doomsday prediction and stressed that lockdown saved lives while gradual unlocking allowed green shoots.On the issue of cash transfer to poor and farmers, Thakur said that during the NDA tenure (2014-19), the government disbursed Rs 8 lakh crore on procurement of wheat and rice as compared to Rs 3.74 lakh crore during the UPA tenure (2009-14).The government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi purchased 74 times more pulses at MSP (Minimum Support Price) than that procured during UPA tenure 2009-14, the minister said.He also noted that the NDA government procured 306.9 million tonnes of paddy and 162.7 million tonnes of wheat in the last five years as compared to 2009-13 during the UPA tenure wherein only 176.8 million tonnes of paddy and 139.5 million tonnes of wheat were procured.By opening 42 crore Jan Dhan accounts, Modi government has stopped leakages in the system ensuring every rupee reaches its intended beneficiary swiftly and even during the Covid pandemic, through Direct Bank Transfer (DBT), it provided financial support to millions, Thakur said.He reminded the former finance minister that DBT was also given under NSAP (National Social Assistance Programme) to widows, divyangs, senior citizens, to building and construction workers as well as to front load PM-KISAN for farmers and to make 24 per cent contribution to EPFO and Ujjwala.Noting that total transfers exceed Rs 68,000 crore, Thakur wondered whether these are not ""cash in hand"".While the UPA government during your (Chidambaram) tenure as the finance minister disbursed bad loans, Thakur said, Modi government provided Rs 3 lakh crore government guarantee through the ECLGS scheme to the industry to sustain and revive their businesses.Over Rs 2.65 lakh crore has been sanctioned by public and private sector banks, and NBFCs to over 92 lakh accounts as part of ""cash flow for businesses"" under the Emergency Credit Line Guarantee Scheme (ECLGS), he added.","Economy will rebound on reforms, says Thakur",RICE

Roughly 35,000 immigrant women in New York City had too little food to eat this past March. (Desiree Rios/The New York Times)In a tenement in the South Bronx, Isabel Galn plays with her toddler so he wont interfere as his two siblings begin their remote school days.Galns home is small, but happy. Christopher, 11, Mia, 7, and Ian, 1, get along. The older children help keep the space tidy. The youngest has kept them giggling during the long year they have spent together indoors.But behind these scenes of domestic joy are financial straits so dire that they can be hard to comprehend: In the year after the pandemic shut down the economy of one of the worlds richest and most expensive cities, Galn and her children have lived on $100 a week.$20, $50, said Galn, 31. I guard it as if it was gold.Before the pandemic, Galn worked at a dry cleaner in the Bronx, earning about $350 per week, which helped support her children and even her mother in Puebla, Mexico.But in March 2020, as Galn was preparing to return to work after maternity leave, the dry cleaner shuttered its doors as the city went quiet.The nearly half a million immigrants who live in New York City without legal status were devastated by the pandemic, stricken by the virus and the economic fallout it caused and ineligible for stimulus checks and the unemployment benefits that kept many New Yorkers afloat.Women like Galn were hit particularly hard, a recent estimate by the Fiscal Policy Institute found. Many had low-wage jobs in the service sector. Some were suddenly obligated to stay home with children when schools closed.Roughly 35,000 immigrant women in New York City had too little food to eat this past March.Among them is Galn, who has found herself both desperate for work and unable to afford child care, even if she finds a new job.She keeps her money in cash, after closing her bank account because she couldnt pay the service fees. She never touches the last $20 bill beneath her mattress, she said, saving it for an emergency taxi ride should something go wrong. So we can get to the ER, she said.Galn is the oldest of five sisters. Her formal education in Puebla ended after elementary school. Her father was an alcoholic, and her mother needed her to watch her sisters while she went to work, she said. My mother was the father, and I was the mother.Those skills have helped her run her own household, she said.But the arrival of the pandemic shook Galn and her family in unexpected ways. Unemployed and stuck indoors as the virus spread, she and her partner, Ians father, began to argue, she said. When the arguments escalated, she took her children to a shelter.There, Galn and her children lived for months in a cramped room. Galn found ways to make a few dollars. She decorated towers of diapers for fellow shelter residents to buy as baby shower gifts, and made piatas for the holidays.But she lived in constant fear of catching the virus from a shared bathroom. And the older children struggled to focus on their schoolwork as their baby brother cried.In January, after six months at the shelter, she and her children returned home to the old apartment. Galn was grateful: All over New York City, immigrants in the country illegally have struggled to endure the economic toll of the pandemic, losing not just jobs but housing.But with Ians father gone, Galn knew she would have to figure out a way to support her family on her own.Galns most immediate concern was how to feed her family. They had once qualified for food stamps, because the three children are American-born. But the benefits had lapsed: With no money for her prepaid cellphone, Galn had missed the calls notifying her.She began to rely on free meals handed out at public schools across the city. Every morning, she has picked up meals at a nearby school that contain items like fruit, yogurt, cereal and cartons of milk that she warmed for Ians bottle.The school meals  and a weekly hot meal from an organization  have helped her spend only about $40 a week on groceries, she said, which goes to items like eggs, vegetables, pasta, beans, rice and cooking oil. Another local organization has given her diapers and feminine hygiene products.Galn reserves most of what remains of her $100 weekly budget for the gas, electric, and internet and phone bills.Her childrens tablets, issued to them by their school, come equipped with internet, but it is spotty, she said, so she has had to pay a provider. When she has not been able to cover her phone bill, a sister has helped.That leaves just a little for household needs like laundry, toothpaste, toilet paper, hand sanitizer and soap. Sometimes I water down the soap so it will last longer, she said.Galn has not been able to pay her $1,750 monthly rent. And while she has been protected by a moratorium on evictions during the pandemic, she has accumulated several months of debt to her landlord.Without a steady job, Galn continues to find ways to make money. A friend got her a gig dipping strawberries in chocolate at a flower shop for $12 an hour around Valentines Day. She has also been making mementos for baptisms and first communions, slipping the bills she earns under the mattress.But its not enough, she said, and any unexpected expense can feel like a crisis.When Mias teacher said the girl needed a desk and a chair last year, while in the shelter, Galn could not afford them. I couldnt tell the teacher, she said. Its hard not being able to provide what they say the children need.When Ian got a respiratory infection last fall, she scraped together $25 for antibiotics. Then she learned both of her older children needed glasses with special lenses. Each pair cost $150.Before the pandemic, Galn and her family did not live lavishly, but once a week they indulged. They went to the movies or out to eat ice cream or pizza, she said. Now, they enjoy no such luxuries.The children no longer ask for things when they go out, said Galn. And yet she tries to make life feel as normal as possible, worrying in particular about Christopher, her older son, and how he has been affected by their financial stress.Recently, he cut a hole out of the side of a box, filled it with slips of paper made to look like money, and taped a sign to the side: ATM.He said, Mami, do you need money? I said yes, and he gave me $100, Galn said.But by spring, rays of hope began to appear. After more than a year at home with her children, Galn found a day care center for all three of them that was free of charge. Galn has spent her newly free days doing odd jobs and studying.All year long, she has attended remote English classes on her smartphone four days a week, for two hours each evening, hoping her growing fluency will help her get a steady job and pass an exam for a high school equivalency diploma.The kids are students in the day, and Im a student at night, she said.And after months of demonstrations by groups that advocate for immigrants, New York state lawmakers approved a budget that includes a $2.1 billion excluded workers fund for people who are ineligible for other pandemic aid because they are in the country without legal status. It is the largest package of its kind in the country.With the right paperwork, Galn and others like her who can show they lost work during the pandemic may qualify for a one-time payment of up to $15,600  the equivalent of $300 a week for a year.But the months of grinding poverty have taken their toll. Galn has kept a votive candle burning on her table, where it has flickered amid the familys meals. The candle is for her mother, Manuela, whose health issues have left her unable to work  or walk.Before the pandemic, Galn sent her mother a few hundred dollars every month for food or bus fare, she said. Now, all she can do is pray.It drives me crazy a little bit, not being able to help her, she said.She tries not to let the children see her crying.",‘It’s not enough’: Living through a pandemic on $100 a week,RICE

At a press conference on Thursday, Food Secretary Sudhanshu Pandey also said it was up to the States to take further action on providing rations to migrants and others without ration cards in compliance with a Supreme Court order, indicating that the Centre does not intend to revive last years scheme meant for these vulnerable populations.Out of the 79.25 crore beneficiaries under the National Food Security Act (NFSA), only 55 crore have so far received their 5 kg per person quota of free wheat or rice under the Pradhan Mantri Gareeb Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY), which was announced to mitigate the economic distress caused by the pandemic. Thus, more than 30% have still not got their benefit. However, almost 90% of beneficiaries have received their regular subsidised grain for the month, raising questions over why the free grain has reached fewer beneficiaries. Food Ministry data showed that Madhya Pradesh, Goa, Odisha and Rajasthan did not even begin distribution of the May quota under PMGKAY until June 1.Also read | Grains reached 2.03 crore of 80 crore beneficiaries in first 10 days of MayOn Wednesday, the Centre issued an advisory to all States asking them to launch a special drive to issue ration cards to the most vulnerable sections of society, including migrant workers and street dwellers, noting that some of the poor and needy people who do not have address proof may be finding it difficult to obtain a ration card.However, this must be done within the existing coverage allowed for each State under the NFSA. Mr. Pandey told presspersons that there was a nationwide coverage gap of 1.97 crore beneficiaries. However, he admitted that 14 States had already reached their quota limits and would not be able to enrol any new beneficiaries.An analysis of NFSA data shows that the only major States which have significant coverage gaps are Himachal Pradesh (23%), Madhya Pradesh (14%) and Gujarat (9%). Most other large States have less than a 5% gap, which can be used to issue new ration cards. In a May 24 order, the Supreme Court had directed stranded migrant workers and poor people without ration cards should be provided with dry ration under the Atma Nirbhar scheme  which was implemented last year  or any other scheme found suitable by the States and Centre.Also read | NHRC notice to Centre, States over denial of benefitsThe action largely lies on part of State governments. Making ration card is within the domain of the States. So we have already complied with what is required from the Central government. We are running PMGKAY, NFSA, we are also issuing subsidised food grains to NGOs, said Mr. Pandey. Asked about any possibility of revival of the Atmanirbhar scheme, he only said, Atmanirbhar scheme was last year, and today the schemes are different. I would still reiterate that the action now lies on the part of the State governments to issue ration cards.This comes at a time of record foodgrain procurement, with the Centre hiking its target for ongoing wheat procurement to 433 lakh metric tonnes in comparison to last years figure of almost 390 lakh tonnes. The record procurement has in fact led to the Food Corporation of India (FCI) being forced to temporarily store more than 28 lakh metric tonnes of grain in unscientific conditions, according to FCI Chairman and Managing Director Atish Chandra.With regard to cooking oils, whose prices have shot up 60% over the course of the last year, Mr. Pandey said the Centre was monitoring the market and taking steps to ease import supply chain disruptions. Asked if there was any move to reduce import duties on edible oils, he said that a declining trend in global rates and 15-20% reduction in domestic demand have led to a recent softening of prices.","Centre asks States to issue ration cards to most vulnerable, poor people",RICE

Muthammal had just bought half a litre of milk from her neighbour Ambigai, who stood by holding her aluminium milk can, measuring to refill the feeding bottle.She [Muthammal] bought this kid as a new-born from someone, who needed money. She will raise it, and then sell it to make some money, Ambigai explained the economics of goat-rearing. Sometimes it may go up to 10,000, if she is lucky. As Muthammal fed the motherless kid, one of her three adult goats, threw a tantrum by bumping her from behind. She would take them to graze around this M.Thanda village in the dry Eiryur block of Dharmapuri.As they wait, Muthammal informs Ambigai that she withdrew the last of the MGNREGS work payment of 1,200 this week. That was the six-day work wage credited for March that she saved up until now. There is no more work now, says Muthammal. It has come down to three weeks work a year now with more people and less work, never 100 days, says Ambigai.In the rural milieu, between the last of MGNREGS job work payment, the State governments COVID-19 cash relief of 4,000 for every ration card, with dry rations, the village economy is tottering on bare minimal existence without any sustenance during the ongoing pandemic-induced lockdown.Dairy troubleOn Wednesday, Ambigai, who supplies an average of 5 litres daily to the local milk cooperative society diverted some milk to Muthammals goat. Amibigai needed the money.While the Society procures at 22 per litre, she can sell it in the open at 40 per litre. But, the societys is a steady income. I know they will buy it. Here, no one can afford milk every day. They will buy one day and not for 10 days. I cant lose the Society. Though, the Society has not paid from March onwards, shes certain they will clear the dues. But on days like these, when someone asks, I sell it.But, Ambigai is unaware of a little detail since her payments are yet to come. The Societies have cut down the procurement price by 3 payable to the milk suppliers like her.In the neighbouring block of Palacodde in Dodaaradhanahalli village, Muniamma, in her 50s, is worried by this slash. Only this Pongal, Muniamma bought a cow. I borrowed 50,000 from my Sangam (SHGs), bought a cow for 40,000. The society paid 22 per litre, but now they only pay 19, saying milk prices have come down. She sells 10 litres/day to the society, which meant a loss of 900 per month.As part of its electoral promise, the DMK government slashed the price of Aavin milk by 3 procured by the State-run milk cooperative federation from the farmers. But, this concession is also subsidised by women like Ambigai and Muniamma.How will I pay back my loan? I have to pay 2,500 per month (SHG), and spend on fodder of  1,100 per bag (two bags a month), she says. If this troubles her waking hours, the exclusion of those above 50 years from MGNREGS works citing the pandemic is making her despondent. It is true, they wont give us work any more? Where are we to go?Across villages, as women go about their daily chores, the spectre of debt due to the SHGs make up the conversations. The women were also given loans knowing that they will find work and that the men were out there working vouching for the repayment, says Ambigai. But, now the men have returned from their jobs. Without men, we ate what was there, not needing to cook three times. Now, the rations and the gas always falls short, says Ambigai, whose husband employed in a snacks unit returned.The State governments cash relief of 4,000 for every ration card has cushioned the impact of joblessness briefly.In a predominantly rain-fed, drought prone landscape like Dharmapuri, the spurts of summer showers brought with it seasonal farm work for the majority landless on the marginal landholdings of the few in the village. This year that was not to be. Given the drying up of cash inflows in the village economy, those with meagre landholdings have fallen back on family labour, with the return of the men, and lack of cash inflow to pay wages.R. Prabhu was steadying up a big sack of groundnut between his legs on his moped outside his house in Chinnaperamanur village in Pennagaram taluk. He was doing masonry works earning 800 per day depending on the size of the buildings, until he returned to the village after the spike in cases and the resultant lockdown. Prabhus family owns 1 acre on which they raised paddy last year, ragi and groundnuts thereafter. What we grow we keep it for our own use, not needing to buy anything. Sometimes, we sell if there is excess, his mother pitches in. We cant pay wages now. Our family members are our farmhands.As one drives through the villages, stray construction works on houses with hollow blocks are being carried out by the family members.Loan waivers for someThey (farmers) will start coming for loans once this lockdown is over, predicts, K. Periasamy, the secretary of the Primary Agricultural cooperative society, Jarthalav, from across his table overlooking the campus of Paaparapatty Cooperative Sugar mill in Palacodde taluk. The Society lends crop loans to landholding farmers, apart from jewel loan and loans to womens SHGs.We will not lend a rupee if there are outstanding loans. Every year, there are outstanding loans because farmers say the cane is lost, crop is burnt. But, this year, the State government had waived Agricultural Cooperative Society farm loans and SHG loans ahead of the elections. Before they could issue the G.O for jewel loan waiver, elections came. So, the status of jewel loans is unclear, he says.For the majority of womens SHGs serviced by the regional rural banks and nationalised banks, this loan waiver to the Societies-lent SHGs has left them feeling deprived.Society lends only to those with land. Benefits are accrued to those with land and the rest of us dont get anything, surmised Vijayshanthi in Paruvadhanapalli village in Pennagaram block, who has 38,000 loaned by her Sangam (SHG) and a jewel loan from a bank.How does one register with a society to get the waiver? asks J. Kalpana, as she cut fodder in the 33 cent land her family owns. This fodder would not last three weeks for the two cattle we have, she added. Kalpana heads the SHG in M.Thanda village in Eriyur block. Her SHG borrowed 3 lakhs from a nationalised bank and shared it between its 20 members. Now for two months, the women had a tacit agreement not to ask each other for interest. Two months, no weekly savings or interest payment. But soon, the bank will ask Kalpana and she will have to ask her members.Shankar had been ducking from creditors as much as he could ever since he returned to the village from the stone crushing unit he went to in Kuppam in Andhra Pradesh. The agent took me before the lockdown, but no raw materials came and they brought us back after 20 days work and no pay. He was still reeling under the burden of repaying a rice chit (monthly/weekly informal chit scheme to buy good rice just in time for Pongal).

The study, prepared under International Plant Protection Convention (IPCC) and hosted by Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations , was released on Wednesday (Thursday morning in India).The scientific review looks at 15 plant pests that have spread or may spread due to climate change as the risks are increasing, warn the authors stating a single, unusually warm winter is capable of providing conditions suitable for insect infestations.The key findings of this review should alert all on how climate change may affect how infectious, distributed and severe pests can become around the world, stated Qu Dongyu, Director-General of the UN FAO, at the launch.""The review clearly shows that the impact of climate change is one of the greatest challenges the plant's health community is facing, he has added.The focus of this report is to outline the potential effects of climate change on plant pests, and hence on plant health. It is based on an analysis of scientific literature and studies that have investigated such aspects. Studies have evaluated the effects of several atmospheric and climatic factors, including increased temperature, carbon dioxide and ozone and changing water or humidity patterns, on the distribution, occurrence and abundance of pests and the severity of the pest risk they pose.Preventive, mitigation and adaptation measures to limit the international spread of pests through trade and travel is necessary. Short and mid-term mitigation and adaptation options include measures such as use of resistant varieties and the alteration of microclimate.The evidence reviewed in this report strongly indicates that in many cases climate change will result in increasing problems related to plant health in managed (agriculture, horticulture, forestry), semi-managed (national parks) and presumably also unmanaged ecosystems. Adjustments in plant-protection protocols are already necessary because of recent climatic changes, but further adjustments will become increasingly crucial in the future, assuming the projected climate-change scenarios come true. Preventive and curative plant protection is one of the key components needed to maintain and preserve current and future food security.The study also looks into risk of rice in India stating infection ability of leaf blight (caused by Magnaporthe oryzae) is projected to increase during the winter season (December to March), whereas during the monsoon season (July to October) it is projected to remain unchanged or to decrease slightly.Some 10 to 28 per cent of global crop production is currently lost to pests and plant diseases rob the global economy of more than $220 billion annually. Invasive pests cost countries at least $70 billion, and they are also one of the main drivers of biodiversity loss, the FAO said.Species such as fall armyworm, which feeds on crops that include maize, sorghum and millet, have already spread due to warmer climate. Others, such as desert locusts, which are the worlds most destructive migratory pests, are expected to change their migratory routes and geographical distribution.Movements like these threaten food security as a whole and small farmers as well as people in countries where food security is an issue, are among those especially at risk, the report stated.The report is among the key initiatives of the International year of plant health, which concludes this month.""Preserving plant health is fundamental to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, said Qu. Sustaining plant health is an integral part of our work towards more efficient, inclusive, resilient and sustainable agri-food systems, he states.The authors have outlined several recommendations to mitigate the impact of climate change, including stepping up international cooperation, as effective management of plant pests in one country affects success in others.The authors also stressed the need for more research, and more investments in strengthening national systems and structures related to plant health.",Climate change heightening threats to global food security and environment: study,RICE

He said he was upset, hurt and disappointed, but never left the right path. He also spoke about farmers agitation in Delhi and against the Centres farm bills.At one of the party workers meeting in Kamalapur in his constituency in 2019, Eatala said ministers post is not alms of anybody, taking an indirect dig at KCR.

There were reports that the CM did not take Eatala into confidence and invite him during meetings with ministers.

All petrol sold in the country is targeted to have 20% ethanol by 2025.India is the worlds third-biggest oil importer, relying on foreign suppliers to meet over 85% of its demand.Mr. Modi said the focus on ethanol is having a better impact on the environment as well as on the lives of farmers as it gives them another source of income.He said that a large part of this eight-fold increase in ethanol procurement has benefitted the sugarcane farmers of the country.Prior to his speech, the Prime Minister interacted with a few farmers from Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh and Gujarat to learn about their experience from ethanol plants aiding their income, using animal waste to generate biogas that could be used for cooking medium and running vehicles and use of organic fertilizers.Ethanol manufacturing units were previously limited to only 4-5 sugarcane producing states but now food grain-based distilleries are being established to expand this to the whole country, Mr. Modi said.The Prime Minister said that India is a strong proponent of climate justice and is moving ahead with ideas like the founding of the International Solar Alliance for realising the vision of One Sun, One World, One Grid and the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure initiative.He went on to list Indias efforts to protect climate change - raising renewable energy capacity 250% and India now being among the top five nations with the largest installed capacity, solar energy capacity rising by about 15 times in the last 6 years, giving 37 crore LED bulbs and more than 23 lakh energy efficient fans, providing free electricity and cooking gas connections to cut household pollution.Apart from reducing pollution, it has also helped a lot in improving the health and strengthening environmental protection, he said. India is setting an example to the world that it is not necessary to stop development for protecting the environment. He said along with strengthening the economy, forests cover has also increased by 15,000 square kilometers in the last few years, the tiger population doubled and the number of leopards increased by about 60 per cent.It is a myth that air pollution is caused only by industries. Transport vehicles, unclean fuels, diesel generators also contribute to air pollution, he said adding the use of LPG as cooking fuel and electricity for lighting purposes has checked pollution from using firewood and kerosene.Use of waterways, expansion of metro and suburban railways, electrification of railway lines and airports being powered by solar energy are other initiatives, he said.India, he said, is now a proponent of climate change resolution and is among the top 10 nations on Climate Change Performance Index.We are aware of the challenges that are being faced due to climate change and are working proactively to overcome, he said. India is setting an example to the world that it is not necessary to block developmental works in order to protect the environment. Economy and Ecology can go together. This is the path that India has chosen, he said.The Prime Minister spoke about a project to develop Gujarats Kevadiya, which houses the Statue of Unity, as an electric vehicle city.Necessary infrastructure is being made available so that only battery-based buses, two-wheeler, four-wheeler will run in Kevadiya in future.Mr Modi said the government has identified 11 sectors that can make good use of resources by recycling them through modern technology.He also launched a pilot project of E-100 (100 per cent ethanol) dispensing stations at 3 locations in Pune.This will provide the consumers with another choice of fuel along with a price advantage as the government has kept ethanol under the lower GST slab.In the current ethanol supply year, which started in October, India plans to have 10% ethanol-blending with gasoline. As much as 4 billion litres of ethanol will be needed for achieving a 10% mixing ratio.For 20% by 2023, 10 billion (1,000 crore) litres will be needed.The sugar industry will divert 6 million tonnes of surplus sugar to produce 7 billion litres of the ethanol needed while the remaining ethanol will be produced from excess grain.","India advances 20% ethanol-blending in petrol to 2025, says PM Modi",RICE

Annual visitorship of over 16 lakh dropped to zero last year when a national lockdown was declared, prompting Park authorities to pursue donation and adoption schemes aggressively. The nourishment of 2,300 animals of 103 species depended on it.Last year we had over 230 donors and clocked over `3 crore in donations. This year in April and May alone we got 85 donors and have collected over `20 lakh. We believe opening the one-day adoption scheme contributed to a spike in just two months. Donors have adopted 105 animals so far, said a Park official who declined to be named.Adoptive animal parents include people from Bengaluru, different districts of Karnataka like Chitradurga, Tumakuru, and even other states such as Himachal Pradesh and Telangana. Among the donors from Bengaluru are Shreyas PS and Karan Prasad, alumni of BMS College of Engineering, Bengaluru. They created a group of 45 alumni to raise funds for adoption. We raised over `80,000 in the past month to adopt three animals for six months.We have adopted the Royal Bengal tiger, Indian leopard and grey wolves. We believe it is the need of the hour to ensure animals are not left starving. The health of the animals is prime to the ecosystem, says Shreyas. Before the Covid-19 pandemic dealt a blow to physical visits, the Parks annual revenue averaged `30 crore in financial years 2018-19 and 2019-20.After the pandemic hit, we earned just one-fifth of last years total revenue. We had to open adoption drives to look after the management and animals, another official said.

(Express Photo By Pavan Khengre/Representational)Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwals office Saturday said Lt Governor Anil Baijal has rejected the proposal to launch the doorstep delivery of ration scheme citing a lack of clearance from the Union government and an ongoing litigation involving the scheme.In its response, the Union Food & Public Distribution Ministry said the Delhi government is free to procure additional foodgrains for the proposed scheme under notified rates and launch it, instead of disrupting the public distribution system under the National Food Security Act (NFSA) under which highly subsidised foodgrains are allotted to the states.In a statement, Kejriwals office claimed that his government was set to launch the scheme across Delhi within a day or two. A senior government official said that Baijal has returned the file to the CM for reconsideration as it would mandatorily require the prior approval of the Centre as per Section 12 (2) (h) of the NFSA, adding that a Delhi High Court hearing on a related case is listed for August 20.Also Read | Explained: What is Delhi governments doorstep ration scheme; why has it been halted?Delhi Food Minister Imran Hussain termed Baijals decision politically motivated.No approval for launching such a scheme is required as per existing law. Nevertheless, we have written six letters to the Centre since 2018 apprising them of this scheme at every stage. Moreover, based on the last communication received from the Centre on 19.02.2021, their concern regarding scheme name has also been accepted by the Delhi Cabinet. What further approval is required? Hussain said.The Centre had in March raised red flags over the name of the scheme and the proposal to use foodgrains allocated under the National Food Security Act (NFSA) in a local scheme. Later, the Kejriwal cabinet dropped the name Mukhya Mantri Ghar Ghar Ration Yojna and said it had addressed all concerns raised by the Centre  an assertion that the government reiterated on Saturday.However, apart from the name, the Centre has also made it clear that subsidised foodgrains allocated under the NFSA cannot be used for a policy drawn up at the local level.Also Read | Doorstep ration delivery scheme will have no name: Arvind KejriwalThe Government of India has not asked the Delhi government to not distribute ration the way they want. They can do so under any other scheme. The Centre will provide additional ration for the same as per notified rates. Where is the issue? Why insist on disrupting an existing pan-India scheme which is under the NFSA? said a spokesperson from the Union Food and Public Distribution Ministry.The Centre had also questioned one of the components of the proposed scheme which involves collection of the cost of subsidised foodgrains and a specified amount as milling/conversion charges from the beneficiaries. The Delhi government has not yet made public the proposed charges.According to the notification of the proposed scheme, its implementation would be overseen by the Delhi State Civil Supplies Corporation Ltd (DSCSC) and the Delhi Consumers Cooperative Wholesale Store Ltd (DCCWS).Millers and processing units empanelled with the DSCSC will be tasked with lifting foodgrains from Food Corporation of India godowns, grinding the wheat to make wheat flour, cleaning the rice of impurities, packing and sending the material to ration shops.The DCCWS shall engage agencies to carry out last-mile delivery of ration till the doorstep of beneficiaries, the notification says. The DHD agency shall notify the beneficiary in advance through SMS. The packed ration shall be handed over to the beneficiary only after his/her successful biometric authentication using the e-POS device, it adds.Distribution of ration in Delhi is currently managed by a network of as many as 2,005 fair price shops. Under the NFSA, approximately 17.77 lakh ration card holding families in Delhi are divided into three categories  15.12 lakh priority households (PR), 1.73 lakh priority state households (PRS), and 68,468 Antyodaya Anna Yojana (AAY) families.The beneficiaries coming under PR and PRS categories are entitled to 5 kg of foodgrains per month while AAY households receive 25 kg wheat, 10 kg rice and 1 kg sugar.",Delhi’s doorstep delivery of ration scheme runs into roadblock,RICE
2021-06-05,https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/delhi/delhi-ration-lockdown-mcd-7345675/,"When he was in Class VI, Bunty Rajput lost his father, forcing him to drop out of MCD Primary School in Idgah Road and earn for his family. On Saturday, Bunty, now 34, found himself in a queue outside the same school, waiting for ration being distributed by the state government.He cited two reasons for not being employed: The current lockdown and the fact that he had to leave school at a young age and cant read or write properly.Bunty was among roughly 60 people who had lined up on Saturday outside government schools with their Aadhaar card and panni (polythene bags) to collect ration. As many as 280 schools across the city had been identified for distribution of food to people who dont have a ration card.Over the years, Bunty has held odd jobs such as painting walls and driving trucks. He also worked at a stock-keeping unit at a mall, from where he was promoted to salesman. I have many skills. But somehow, ever since I lost my job at the mall during the lockdown last year, I have not managed to get a steady job, said Bunty, who has no means of income but has to sustain himself and his mother with their savings.My old teacher is now the principal. I am glad that I can at least get ration from here, he said outside the school. After registering, he collected dry ration for three members of his family  3 kg of rice and 12 kg of wheat. Each person is entitled to 1 kg of rice and 4 kg of wheat.The school had received 49 bags of wheat and 14 bags of rice, each weighing 50 kg. The administration said they will be able to provide ration to 200 families every day.Imran Hussain, Delhis Food and Civil Supplies Minister, said the AAP government has procured the best quality foodgrains from FCI. Ration will be distributed every day, barring Sundays, from 10 am to 4 pm.However, many migrant workers complained they could not register because the address on their Aadhaar card is of their hometown. Ram Vilas (40), who used to work as a rickshaw driver before the lockdown, was among them. His wife and children are in Uttar Pradesh while he works here and sends money home. I am stuck here just like the previous lockdown but this time, I am not even getting ration, he said.The school administration said they are unable to feed PIN codes from outside Delhi on the Janta Samvad portal and had to, therefore, turn a few people away. The rest managed to get registered using their Aadhaar card and phone number, or any other ID card which had address proof.Vimla (60), a resident of Sadar Bazaar, worried if there was a problem with her Aadhaar card. She said, The administration told me to wait until I get a message on my phone. I still havent so far I guess I will not get ration. She was using her sons phone and did not know how to read messages. After waiting for over five hours, she tried one last time. Officials checked her phone and realised the storage was full. They helped her delete a few messages, after which she finally got the message and heaved a sigh of relief.At MCD Primary School, Block 16 in Trilokpuri, Pooja (36) was the first to collect ration for her family of five at 1 pm. The school received 1,800 kg of wheat and 700 kg of rice. Pooja used to work as a domestic help before the lockdown. I often skip meals to feed the children. My husband andI are unemployed, so we cannot provide them with regular meals, she said. After she collected the ration in bags, she used a rope to tie it tightly so she could carry it home, which was half an hour away, on foot.Aashu (48), who collected ration for her family and her neighbours family, tied the bags containing 30 kg of foodgrain in a similar manner. She, too, would have to walk for 20 minutes to reach home. A rickshaw would cost Rs 30. Itne mein shaam ki sabzi ho jayegi (I can afford vegetables for the evening in that much), she said.Ever since the lockdown was implemented, several migrant workers as well as those who have lost jobs said they had been surviving on cooked food provided at some schools, cutting down on meals, or taking loans from people.At a few schools across the city, people were turned away since officials said ration has not reached or that they were not prepared. At some, beneficiaries were asked to undergo compulsory Covid-19 testing before they could collect ration.A woman from Chirag Delhi, who did not wish to be named, said, When I went to the SDMC school at Chirag Delhi, we were stopped and asked to get tested at a camp that had been set up. There were around 100 people. She and the others were asked to return with their test reports on Monday, only after which they would get ration.","‘I have many skills, but haven’t got a job since last lockdown’: At Delhi’s ration lines, the desperation is palpable",RICE

Ms. Muthammal had just bought half a litre of milk from her neighbour Ambigai, who stood by holding her aluminium milk can, measuring to refill the feeding bottle.She bought this kid as a new-born from someone, who needed money. She will raise it, and then sell it to make some money, Ms. Ambigai said, explaining the economics of goat rearing in M.Thanda village in the dry Eiryur block of Dharmapuri. Sometimes it may go up to 10,000, if she is lucky.As she waits, Ms. Muthammal tells Ms. Ambigai that she withdrew the last of the MGNREGS work payment of 1,200 this week. Those were the wages for the six days of work credited for March that she had saved up.There is no more work now, said Ms. Muthammal.Work under the scheme has come down to just three weeks a year now, with more people and less work, never 100 days, said Ms. Ambigai.With the pandemic induced lockdown and work under the MGNREGS drying up, the rural economy is tottering, barely sustained by the State governments COVID-19 cash relief of 4,000 for every ration card, with dry rations providing minimal sustenance.Ms. Ambigai, who supplies an average of 5 litres daily to the local milk cooperative society, diverted some milk to Ms. Muthammals goat because she needed the extra money.While the cooperative society procures milk at 22 per litre, she can sell it in the open for 40 per litre. But theres a catch.The societys offtake is a steady income. I know they will buy it. Here, no one can afford milk every day. They will buy on one day but then may not buy for another 10 days. I cant lose the society, says Ambigai. Though the society has not paid her since March, shes certain they will clear the dues. But on days like these, when someone asks, I sell it.And Ambigai is unaware of larger changes effected by government policies since her payments are yet to come. The cooperative societies have cut down the procurement price by 3 payable to the suppliers like her.In the neighbouring block of Palacodde in Dodaaradhanahalli village, Muniamma, in her 50s, is worried by this cut in prices. Just six months ago during Pongal, Muniamma bought a cow. I borrowed 50,000 from my sangam (SHGs), bought a cow for 40,000. The society used to pay 22 per litre, but now they only pay 19, saying milk prices have come down. Muniamma sells 10 litres a day to the society. The drop in procurement prices means she loses 900 per month.As part of its electoral promise, the DMK government slashed the price of Aavin milk by 3 procured by the State run milk cooperative federation from the farmers. But, this concession is also subsidised by women like Ambigai and Muniamma.How will I pay back my loan? I have to pay 2,500 per month to the sangam and spend on fodder worth 1,100 per bag (two bags a month), says a worried Ms Muniamma. To add to her troubles, those above 50 years are now debarred from MGNREGS works due to the pandemic. It is true, they wont give us work anymore? Where are we to go, she asks anxiously.Across villages, as women go about their daily chores, the spectre of debts owed to the SHGs are the staple of every conversation. The women were given loans on the understanding that they would find work and that their menfolk were also working, says Ms Ambigai. But, now the men have returned from their jobs and are unemployed. Without men, we ate what was there, not needing to cook three times. Now, the rations and the gas always falls short, she says as her husband who was employed in a snacks making unit has lost his source of livelihood.The State governments cash relief of 4,000 for every ration card has cushioned the impact of joblessness briefly.In a predominantly rain-fed, drought prone region like Dharmapuri, the summer showers brought seasonal farm work for the landless majority, on the marginal landholdings in the village. But not this year. With cash flows to the rural economy drying up, those with meagre landholdings have turned to family labour as the men working in small scale units and informal sector have returned due to the lockdown. Lack of remitances from them has also meant little money to pay the farm labour.R. Prabhu was holding a large sack of groundnuts between his legs on his two wheeler outside his house in Chinnaperamanur village in Pennagaram taluk.He had been working as a mason, earning upto 800 per day depending on the size of the buildings. But the spike in COVID cases and the lockdown forced him to return homw.Mr Prabhus family owns 1 acre of land on which they raised paddy last year followed by ragi and groundnuts.What we grow we keep it for our own use, not needing to buy anything. Sometimes, we sell if there is excess, his mother says. But we cannot pay wages now. Our family members are our farmhands.As one drives through the villages, stray construction works on houses with hollow blocks are being carried out by the family members.Loan waivers for someThey (farmers) will start coming for loans once this lockdown is over, predicts, K. Periasamy, secretary of the Primary Agricultural Cooperative Society at Jarthalav, from across his table overlooking the campus of Paaparapatty Cooperative Sugar mill in Palacodde taluk. The Society lends crop loans to landholding farmers, apart from jewel loan and loans to womens SHGs.We will not lend a rupee if there are outstanding loans. Every year, there are outstanding loans because farmers say the cane is lost, crop is burnt. But, this year, the State government had waived Agricultural Cooperative Society farm loans and SHG loans ahead of the elections. Before they could issue the G.O for jewel loan waiver, elections came. So, the status of jewel loans is unclear, he says.For the majority of womens SHGs serviced by the regional rural banks and nationalised banks, this loan waiver to the Societies-lent SHGs has left them feeling deprived.Society lends only to those with land. Benefits are accrued to those with land and the rest of us dont get anything, said Vijayshanthi in Paruvadhanapalli village in Pennagaram block, who has a loan of 38,000 from her sangam and a jewel loan from a bank.How does one register with a society to get the waiver? asks J. Kalpana, as she cut fodder in her families holding of about a third of an acre. This fodder wont last three weeks for the two head of cattle we have, she added.Ms. Kalpana heads the SHG in M.Thanda village in Eriyur block. Her SHG borrowed 3 lakh from a nationalized bank and shared it between its 20 members. Now for two months, the women had a tacit agreement not to ask each other for interest. Two months, no weekly savings or interest payment. But soon, the bank will ask Ms. Kalpana and she will have to ask her members.Shankar had been ducking creditors ever since he returned to the village from Kuppam in Andhra Pradesh where he worked at a stone crushing unit.The agent took me before the lockdown, but no raw materials came and they brought us back after 20 days work and no pay. He is still reeling under the burden of repaying as arisi (rice) chit (monthly/weekly informal chit scheme to buy good rice just in time for Pongal). I borrowed 8,000 and ended up repaying 30,000 for interest defaults, he says.You know it hurts, when the wife says, What man are you, if you cant buy a little something for the children to eat.

It then offers you one of five subscription verticals  Ketogenic, Low Carb, Balanced, Vegan, and Homestyle. Alternatively, you can forgo these and let the nutritionist pick a plan for you. After this, you decide how many meals per day (breakfast, lunch, snack and dinner) youd like and for how many days and voila, your personal subscription would be up and running.We assign you a personal nutritionist, who chalks out a plan for you and the food given to you is exactly as per the plan. That is why the results are extremely great. If you ask for 1,500 calories with say 30 per cent protein and 20 per cent fat, youll get your meal exactly like that. And the food you get will be very tasty; like you can have pizza and butter chicken and still achieve your fitness goals, he elaborates.And that is another reason why you might find Food Darzee to be quite an attractive option. While you have familiar comforts like butter chicken with kulcha (low carb), Hyderabadi biryani, shawarma bowl and BBQ chicken, you also have incredibly appealing options like quinoa beetroot upma, zucchini noodles in pesto, Caribbean brown rice salad and calzones!While a school of nutritionists believe that the best way to healthy eating and even weight loss/gain is through regional food that uses seasonal ingredients, Food Darzee believes in a much more cosmopolitan approach to addressing ones nutritional needs. Sticking to the rule of burning more calories than you consume would do plenty towards weight management, he says, adding that their clients see it that way too. The only thing that matters with regional food is probably there is a palette difference that happens. People in Chennai could prefer south Indian food more than people in Mumbai. But, we really havent witnessed such trends. All our meals are customisable, and anyway we have backup options, he points out.Hygiene in good handsWith the pandemic raging on, the average customers attention to hygiene has only increased. But, Food Darzee has this covered long before they had to worry about meeting Covid safety standards, says Anirudh. Their system already worked with fast freezing food to preserve its nutrients and leave no room for bacterial growth in the transition from the kitchen to the customers table. Hence, the food is cooked above 70 degree Celsius and they blast-chill it down to 5 degree Celsius within 19 minutes. That is the method weve always followed. Besides this, everyone wears a head cap, gloves and such. With the pandemic, everyone has to wear a mask. We always sanitise our vegetables; we have pest control in place. We didnt have to change much since the pandemic, he shares.If that checks all your boxes, Anirudh also points out that their nutritionists are just a call away to clear any doubts you may have. While that handles the grown up side of the arrangement, he appeals to your gourmet alter ego and adds that your subscription will have no food repeating over a course of four weeks  unless you want it repeating, of course. Well, what more can you ask for?Price of meal subscription plans start from Rs 4,350 (one meal a day for five days).For more details, visit: fooddarzee. com or follow Instagram page: @food.darzee",Fit for foodies,RICE
2021-06-05,https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/chandigarh/punjabs-diversification-paddy-agriculture-department-7345996/,"Has Punjab been able to reduce five lakh hectares (12.35 lakh acres) under water-guzzling paddy (non-basmati) and shift it to other crops in the last two years? Despite Punjab Agriculture Department repeatedly claiming to have done so and CMs office relying on the same figures in its statements, data from the office of the Director of Land Records, Punjab (Revenue Department), does not support this tall claim.While Agriculture Department has been claiming that area under paddy came down from 25.92 lakh hectares (LHS) in 2018-2019 to 20.86 LHS in 2020-21, the states Land Records Department claims that in 2020-21 area under paddy rice was 27.43 LHS, which is in fact highest ever in the history of paddy cultivation in the state.Punjab needs to reduce the area under paddy rice only, and not under basmati rice, which is one of the alternatives for paddy.The Punjab government has been making a lot of efforts to divert the area under paddy to other kharif crops like basmati, maize and cotton but it seems little has changed on the ground.Different depts, different claimsAccording to the records of the Punjab Agriculture Department there was 31.03 lakh hectares (LHS) area under paddy (non-basmati) and basmati crops in 2018-19. This included 25.92 LHS under paddy and 5.11 LHS under basmati.Next year in 2019-20, the Agriculture Department targeted to reduce 2 lakh hectares under paddy and at the end of sowing in first week of August, the departments record revealed on August 26, 2019 that total area under rice was recorded 29.20 LHS, including 22.90 LHS area under paddy (non basmati, parmal rice) and 6.29 LHS under basmati. This meant that total 1.83 LHS area was reduced under rice including 3 LHS under paddy (non-basmati) itself.Then in 2020-21, Agriculture department said that rice area had recorded another big reduction at 27.36 LHS against 29.20 LHS in the previous season. This was again a reduction of 1.84 LHS under rice in total. In this 27.36 LHS rice area, 6.50 LHS was shown under basmati and remaining 20.86 LHS under paddy. This meant another 2.05 LHS reduction under paddy itself.By these calculations from 2018 to 2020, the Agriculture Department had shown a reduction of 3.67 LHS under total rice cultivation, and 5.06 LHS under paddy.But the office of Director of Punjab Land Records, contradicts these claims.The starting point of these diversification claims was year 2018-19. For this year, figures of both departments for areas under paddy are the same (25.92 LHS). But going forward the figures vary.According to the Director Punjab Land Records, the area under rice in 2019-20 increased by 39,000 hectares making 31.42 LHS including paddy on 25.13LHS. In the next season, 2020-21, it touched 27.43 LHS  the highest in the history of paddy cultivation in the state.In fact for 2020-21, the area under rice (paddy and basmati) was 31.49 LHS, again the highest ever under rice in the state.So in the last two seasons, there has been an increase of 1.5 LHS in area under paddy from 25.92 LHS to 27.43 LHS, according to the Land Records Department.Further, the Agriculture Department had shown that the area under paddy was diverted to basmati, cotton and maize in these two years.According to Agriculture Department basmati, cotton and maize area has increased in these two years.Under basmati it increased from 5.11 LHS in 2018 to 6.29 LHS in 2019 and then to 6.50 LHS in 2020. In case of cotton, it increased from 2.67 LHS in 2018 to 3.91 LHS in 2019 and then 5.01 LHS in 2020.For maize, the Agriculture Department, said that the area rose from 1.09 LHS in 2018 to 1.60 LHS in 2019 and then to 2.42 LHS in 2020. So in two years the area under basmati increased by 1.39 LHS, area under cotton increased by 2.53 LHS and under maize it rose by 1.39 LHS, according to the state Agriculture Departments claims.But here again the Punjab Land Records office data reveals that the area under cotton remained 2.48 LHS in 2019 and then at 2.52 LHS in 2020, which means a decrease of just 15,000 hectares from 2018 figure.Even basmati area in 2020 was 4.06 LHS, according to the Land Records office, while Agriculture Department data showed that it was 6.50 LHS  an increase of 2.50 LHS.",Punjab’s diversification puzzle,RICE

The scheme was scheduled to be rolled out from this week but did not receive the go-ahead from the Centre.In a digital address, Mr. Kejriwal questioned Mr. Modi and the Central government on the reasons behind rejecting the scheme, which he said, was going to end the rule of ration mafia that had victimised the poor of the country.He said the Central government has said the scheme is being stopped due to a case involving ration shopkeepers in the High Court, but neither has the court stayed the scheme nor has the Centre put forward any objection in the court. Mr. Kejriwal said the Delhi government had taken the approval of the Centre five times and in spite of no such legal obligations of the government to do so to start the scheme.Adhered to all demandsWe adhered to all the demands of the Centre. You had objected that we cannot name this scheme after the Chief Minister, and we removed the name of the scheme. Our goal was not to make our name shine. We accepted all the objections you made. After all this, you say that we did not take your approval. How else to get approval, sir? Even after that, you rejected this scheme. Why sir?. Mr. Kejriwal asked Mr. Modi.If Pizza can be home-delivered, burgers can be home-delivered, smartphones and clothes can also be home-delivered, then why should ration not be delivered to the houses of the poor? The entire country wants to know why did you reject the scheme? Mr. Kejriwal asked the Prime Minister.He added that no government has dared to end the ration mafia and that the scheme would also help in the containment of the spread of COVID-19. For the first time, a government has come to Delhi which has shown this courage. If this house-to-house ration system was implemented, then the ration mafia would end. But look how powerful this ration mafia turned out to be. This plan was to be implemented in Delhi from next week and a week ago, they got it rejected, Mr. Kejriwal said.Calling it a matter of national interest, Mr. Kejriwal asked why the Central government was fighting with States as they needed to come together to fight COVID-19.The Central government is fighting with Mamata didi, Jharkhand government, Lakshadweep people, Maharashtra government, Delhi, and with the farmers. People have started saying that the Centre is fighting the most, Mr. Kejriwal said.Beneficiaries under the scheme would have received 4kg wheat flour (atta), 1kg rice and sugar per person at the convenience of their homes as against the current provision of 4 kg wheat, 1 kg rice and sugar from fair price shops.The new scheme would have enabled a person to get wheat flour instead of wheat. All the ration would have been delivered to the doorstep of the beneficiary in hygienically packaged form thereby cutting several trips for a common man to the ration shop and local miller, the government said.","If pizza can be home-delivered, why not ration, Kejriwal asks PM",RICE

There are about 2.1 crore rice-drawing cards and 3 lakh sugar cards, apart from about 50,000 non-commodity cards. By providing the cash support of 4,000 along with the pack of 14 essential commodities to every rice-drawing cardholder, the government will be spending more than  9,000 crore.Pointing out that the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has hit universally and perhaps, uniformly all sections of people, a senior citizen, who is living in Thiruvanmiyur and holding a sugar card, feels that the government should not discriminate between rice cardholders and sugar cardholders, while disbursing the benefits.

Sadagopan, a consumer activist, supports the demand and adds that the pandemic has rendered even fairly well off sections of society economically vulnerable.Officials in the government say that the distinction has been a part of the governments policy. There is nothing new in what is being done, as it had been the case in the past when the distribution of colour television sets was done or that of wet grinder-mixies and table fans. There is an implication that by opting for sugar, those card holders do not require the governments support, which is why they have been excluded.The authorities have been getting feedback that the governments benefits need to be targeted better than what is being done as many well-off sections of people are also drawing them. In the last couple of years, the government gave opportunities for sugar card holders to convert their cards into rice drawing cards, the officials say.","Tamil Nadu government urged to include sugar cardholders, while providing special benefits",RICE

The IMD has said that monsoon rains will likely be 101% of the Long Period Average (LPA) of 88 cm. In 2020, it was 109% of the LPA and in 2019, 110%. While the forecast 101% LPA is short of the rainfall received in these years and still within the range of what the IMD considers normal rainfall, it is positive news because the current forecast is above normal rainfall in the core agricultural zone. This zone includes States where agriculture is significantly rain-fed including Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, Odisha and West Bengal. The IMDs estimate of the distribution of this rainfall also suggests that except for the Northeast, where rainfall is expected to be below normal, other regions are expected to get above normal rainfall. A general pattern of the monsoon is that weakened rains over Northeastern India  which has a higher base rainfall than other parts of India  translate into stronger rainfall in Central India. Propitious rain this year is premised on forecasts from Indian and global climate models, veering towards no excess sea-surface temperatures at the Equatorial Pacific conditions. There are also negative IOD (Indian Ocean Dipole) conditions over the Indian Ocean during the monsoon season, meaning warmer water and greater precipitation in the eastern Indian Ocean. Put together, they mean that these larger climate factors are, as of now, unlikely to have a significant influence over the prevailing monsoon.A good monsoon could aid agriculture which has been among the few bright spots in the Indian economy. Two good years of rains have boosted storage in the key reservoirs. However, the flip side of a forecast for a bounteous monsoon is the possibility of flash floods, landslides and disease outbreaks. In the last year and before it, the IMD had not, in June, warned about the exceptionally high rains. While three consecutive years of above normal rain are exceedingly rare, the IMD itself assigns a 22% probability of it occurring, which is just below the 40% probability of normal rainfall. India is now moving to a system where medium range forecasts, or expected changes in monsoon or larger weather patterns over two weeks, are better captured by the monsoon models deployed. These inputs must be used by the Government to better prepare infrastructure in the eventuality that excessive rains can wipe out the potential gains for agriculture. It may also be worthwhile to encourage farmers to sow higher-value crops than only rice via the MSP route. The favourable tidings should not be an excuse to abandon caution.",Fair wind: On IMD's projection of good monsoon,RICE

This is not the first time that it has been embroiled in such a controversy. The report noted that the sodium and sugar content in most of the products were above the permissible limits recommended for daily consumption for adults. This revelation has once again brought the focus back on processed foods and the hidden salt, sugar and additives in them. They have been linked to obesity and lifestyle diseases for a long time. Recently, nutrition policy activists in India demanded that scientific cutoffs for salt, sugar and fats in processed foods should be made mandatory.Talking to Express, Dr B Sujeeth Kumar said: High consumption of processed foods can lead to obesity, diabetes, chronic inflammation and even cancer. White rice and white sugar are the most common processed food products most Indians consume every day. White rice is deficient in bran and germ layer, and hence does not have any nutrients and fibre. Its just empty carbohydrates. Studies have shown that if you have 10 percent processed food every day, there is 10 percent increase in cardiac events. Since these products are inexpensive, it is easy to become addicted to them. Oats, noodles, peanut butter - all are processed foods. People are eating them without sparing any thought because they are not aware of their harmful effects. An easy way to make rice more nutritious is to have it with lentils and green leafy vegetables. This combination brings down the glycemic index of rice, which means sugar is absorbed in the body over three-four hours without causing any sudden spike in blood sugar. This leads to less hunger pangs and prevents overeating, suggests the doctor.Processed food and immunityAt a time when boosting immunity is the catchphrase everywhere, dietician Dr Zeenath Fatima points out how processed foods can cause inflammation and make you more susceptible to infections.These products can cause an imbalance in the gut microbiome. It has been found that any change in gut flora can affect the immunity system. High intake of sugar can cause rise in inflammatory proteins. All processed foods have preservatives which can be salt, sugar, emulsifiers or other additives. Sometimes, sugar is listed on the labels of these items as other names such as dextrose, fructose etc. Salt, sugar and flour (maida) are called white poisons. In fact, our refined oils too are high in omega 6 fatty acids, which can harm our body. We need a balance of omega 6 and omega 3 fatty acids to control inflammation, she says.Beware of sugar, the white poisonThe World Health Organisation (WHO) says that consuming free sugars increases the risk of dental caries (tooth decay). Excess calories from foods and drinks high in free sugars also contribute to unhealthy weight gain, which can lead to overweight and obesity. Recent evidence also shows that free sugars influence blood pressure and serum lipids, and suggests that a reduction in free sugars intake reduces risk factors for cardiovascular diseases.What is processed food?Processed food is any kind of food that has been altered from its natural state to make it safe for consumption or last longer. The methods used for processing food can be dehydrating, canning, freezing or adding preservatives. The most common preservatives used are salt, sugar and other additives.EXAMPLES OF PROCESSED FOOD",Buying processed food? Know the risks,RICE

According to agriculture experts, the diesel component has nearly 13% to 14% share in determining the input cost of the crop. Even with direct seeding of rice (DSR) technique, diesel has almost a similar share in determining input cost. Any fluctuation in the price of diesel has a direct bearing on input cost.In the last one month, diesel price increased by over Rs 5 per litre while over the past year, from June 2020, it increased by Rs 22 to Rs 23 per litre. In June 2020, diesel price was between Rs 63 and Rs 66 while it stood at Rs 82.54 per litre on May 2 this year. On June 7 this year, it was Rs 88.01 per litre. Farmers and agri experts said increase of Rs 22 to Rs 23 per litre in one year would lead to an increase of over 10% in overall input cost.Besides tractors, which are used both in traditional and DSR technique, cost of operating other machinery, which also runs on diesel, will increase.Under traditional transplantation method, while puddling, it becomes mandatory to keep stagnating water in the field in ponding like situation for two weeks. If the power supply is cut for any reason, farmers have to use generator to maintain ponding, failing which cracks appear in the field, causing problems. This exercise increases input cost further, said an agriculture expert from Punjab Agriculture University (PAU).Farmer Gurpreet Singh from Mehraj village in district Bathinda said, I remember purchasing diesel at Rs 65 per litre in June 2020, which now costs Rs 88 per litre.

He was at the 2016 Olympics  from Sulthan Bathery (a town in Wayanad, Kerala), he had made it to Rio. He was sharing the grandest sporting stage with the best athletes in the world. It was a wild dream that came true.Gopi, who is sponsored by the sports brand Asics, is now cooped up in his room in Bengaluru, where he trains. He is uncertain about making it to the 2021 edition of the Summer Games. Events since last year have been postponed or cancelled. Gopis schedule is in disarray. A ticket to the upcoming Olympics, hence, is unlikely.If the participation in Rio was largely unexpected, Tokyo seemed within reach. Gopi, who is part of the Indian Army, clinched the gold medal at the Asian Marathon Championship in 2017. The following year, he topped the podium at the Tata Mumbai Marathon. In 2019, he entered the Seoul International Marathon without a coach or support staff and yet managed to clock a personal best time of two hours, 13 minutes and 39 seconds. The time was two minutes above the cut-off for the Olympics mens marathon qualification (2:11:30s). Gopi was cautiously confident. It will be hard, but I am going to train harder and do my very best, he had said.The pandemic has made things difficult for all. The schedules of many athletes around the world went for a toss. So, it is hard to see events getting postponed or cancelled. One has to deal with these situations, he says.From strength to strengthMental fortitude is necessary for a sport that requires non-stop running of 42 kilometres, mostly minus cheers. Even before marathons, Gopi was familiar with hardship. An only child, Gopi used to help his parents grow rice and ginger in the small patch of land they owned in Wayanad.Gopi was fond of sports. KP Vijayi, the physical education teacher at the Government High School Kakkavayal in Wayanad, spotted him when he was in Class VII. She was instrumental in Gopi taking up athletics seriously. She made him switch from 600m to 1,500m. Soon, he started winning medals in inter-school meets.There were not many who could beat Gopi in Wayanad. At the State-level, however, where he competed with better-trained athletes, he struggled. He needed to improve. After Class XII, he joined Mar Athanasius College at Kothamangalam. Good performances at the university level got him into the Army Sports Institute in Pune in 2009. It also meant he could visit home only once a year (even now, home visits are rare). But he maximised his access to coaches and superior training facilities.That was a turning point, he says about joining the Army, That is where I learnt most of what I know about long-distance running.In 2014, he won gold in the 10,000m run at the National Open Athletics Championships. Two years later at the Mumbai Marathon, Gopi, now predominantly a 10K runner, was sent as a pacemaker for his colleague Nitendra Rawat. He needed to be on the track only for the first 30 kilometres. He, however, found the distance comfortable and cleared it within the Olympic cut-off time.A race against timeThe ginger farmers son earned the chance to represent his country at the Olympics.Going itself was a victory, he says, It was the first time I was participating in such a big event. I could watch and meet the worlds top athletes from diverse events. I could observe how they train closer to the race, the warm-ups and workouts they do, their diets, and things like that. I also spoke to a few other long-distance athletes.All this knowledge helped him do well in the events over the last four years. Some of it is also helping him deal with the lockdown. Since outdoor training is not permitted, it is important to keep yourself fit with some at-home workouts, he says.He recommends a good diet, sleep and exercise for people dealing with lockdowns. Also, a sound mind is as important as a sound body. You should also have a sense of direction, a goal that you look forward to accomplishing.In Gopis case, that goal is the Olympics. Will he be distraught if he cant make it to Tokyo?Gopi is a pragmatic man. His WhatsApp status reads, Dream is important, but training is crucial to reach what you are destined to do! train for it.If not Tokyo, I will get ready for what comes next, he says.",Riding out the highs and lows: How marathoner Thonakal Gopi keeps going,RICE

The scheme, under which 5 kg of wheat or rice is distributed free of cost to around 80 crore beneficiaries under the National Food Security Act, was initially announced only for the months of May and June as economic activity had begun to be disrupted with state governments imposing localised lockdowns to deal with the surge in Covid cases. Though some states have recently begun to roll back some of the restrictions imposed on activities as infection rates have fallen, considering the economic toll of the second wave and the rise in unemployment, the extension of this scheme is a welcome decision. With foodgrains available in the central pool considerably higher than the buffer stock norms, fulfilling this additional allocation will not be a problem.The Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana was first introduced in April last year when the central government had announced the imposition of a national lockdown. As the pandemic dragged on, both the duration as well as scope of the scheme were expanded subsequently. Perhaps this time around, too, considering that many eligible people such as migrant labourers may not be able to access these benefits, more relaxed criteria may be adopted. According to somes estimates, the fiscal costs stemming from the extension of this scheme till November (along with the change in the vaccination policy) are likely to be around 0.4 per cent of GDP. This would imply that part of the fiscal space created by the Centre by advancing the payment of FCI dues to 2020-21, earlier budgeted for 2021-22, will now be offset by higher spending on account of the extension of this scheme.Considering the depth and breadth of this crisis, this measure should be seen as a first step towards a more comprehensive relief package that is needed at this juncture. To begin with, given the sharp rise in unemployment, the government should ramp up the allocation for MGNREGA this year. The approved labour budget is the same as in 2019-20 but the work demanded in both April and May under the programme, while lower than last year, is considerably higher than in 2019-20, signalling the extent of the distress.

2021-06-10,https://indianexpress.com/article/lifestyle/health/nutrition-care-elderly-dementia-chronic-disease-7334328/,"Dementia is a complex disease, chronic and progressive in nature, in which cognitive functions such as thinking, remembering, reasoning and behavioural abilities deteriorate. Due to this loss, a persons daily life and activities are affected, and this adversely impacts not only the person, but also the caregiver, said Neha Sinha, CEO and co-founder, Epoch Elder Care and dementia specialistEat well, eat right; we have all heard this so many times during our childhood, and irrespective of age, good nutrition is vital for ones overall health. However, as dementia progresses, feeding and maintaining nutritional status becomes challenging. Patients may forget to eat, get overwhelmed with too many things on the thali or may find difficulty in verbalising dental issues or mouth ulcers. In the later stages, when chewing and swallowing becomes difficult, caregivers struggle to maintain the balance between appetite and food texture, she added.Maintaining good physical health and weight is a huge aspect of good stage management in dementia. The presence of multiple comorbidities, especially diabetes, where restrictions on diet or medication intake would need constant reminders and explanations makes it even more tricky. It is important to provide a balanced diet, avoid high fat and cholesterol heavy diets, cut down on processed food as well as sugar intake. Adding green leafy vegetables and following the Mediterranean diet of fish, cereals, fruits and olive oil have also shown promising results in reducing further risk, she told indianexpress.com.Apart from managing nutrition, planning meals and mealtimes is also an important aspect of dementia care. Sinha said that if the elder starts resisting meals or eating poorly there may be more than one causes involved. Start with eliminating distractions around meal times  noisy backgrounds and loud conversations can add to their confusion. Lack of physical activity, poor dentures and side effects of medication can all be contributors to reduced appetite. They may also reach a stage where they may not be able to recognise food or poor colour coding of crockery (white rice on white plate) can further perplex them, she explained.ALSO READ | Simple ways to manage COVID anxiety in the elderlyIt is important to maintain independence in feeding for as long as possible. Though it may need a considerable amount of support and time to facilitate, it is essential for the elders dignity and respect. It is a good idea to pre-portion/pre-mix their meals, prepare shorter meals as per their likes and dislikes and garnish food to make it look attractive especially semi-solid food like khichdi. Always sample their food before you serve since they may not be able to give feedback on the taste. Also, opt for more sturdy cutlery and handles which they will find easier to hold. Always keep some food handy, in case they want to eat in the middle of the day (or night) rather than convincing them they have already eaten, she suggested.Elders with dementia are also at an increased risk of dehydration, which leads to co-morbidities like Urinary Tract Infection, or headaches and this may result in agitated behaviour. One needs to encourage fluid intake which could be sips of plain or flavoured water throughout the day; give fruits and vegetables with high water content or simply whip up fruit smoothies or juices.For a family member, managing meals at a dining table with a loved one who has dementia can be demanding. Have patience and do not hurry the elderly during meals  give them all the time they need. Since the person may lack judgement, ensure that the temperature of the food or liquids such as dal, soups is moderate, not boiling hot (or ice-cold). Eating together with them will also encourage feelings of togetherness and may even act as a good appetiser!Involving elders (with or without dementia) in preparing goodies for festivals together is always a great idea! Simply rolling laddoos or filling the gujiya maker, can not only help bring back fond memories but also act as great motor activity, she said.Last but not least in the current times of pandemic, work towards building elders immunity with herbs and condiments such as ginger, garlic, jeera, turmeric and tulsi. Offer such things as part of a routine diligently and they may do wonders, said Sinha.For more lifestyle news, follow us: Twitter: lifestyle_ie | Facebook: IE Lifestyle | Instagram: ie_lifestyle",Effective nutrition care tips for the elderly with dementia,RICE

Manu submitted that ration articles were being distributed to the islanders thorough 39 ration shops on the islands. Every island had ration shops every 1.5 km. In fact, free rice of 5 kg a person was being distributed under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY) through the public distribution system and 110 tonnes of rice was distributed a month under the scheme. Besides, 35 kg foodgrain at 3 a kg was also being distributed to the families under the Antyodaya Anna Yojana (AAY).He further submitted that there had been sufficient stock of food to last up to October on all the islands. Moreover, food meant for the mid-day meal scheme was being distributed to students directly though schools were remaining closed on account of the lockdown. Food was supplied free to the first-line COVID-19 treatment centres as well. Therefore, there was no question of any starvation being experienced by any islanders. The allegations in the petition were vague and did not highlight any specific incident of starvation. Nobody had approached the authorities with complaints of lack of food.Food kits to be ensuredThe Centre, meanwhile, undertook before the court that it would take necessary steps to ensure that there was no shortfall in the supply of food kits and other necessary provisions to the residents of the islands during the period of lockdown.The public interest litigation sought a directive to the Centre and the Lakshadweep administration to provide food kits to needy islanders and transfer cash into their accounts till the lockdown was lifted.According to petitioner Nasih K.K. of Amini island, some of the islanders could not afford to buy food due to joblessness and non-availability of food following the extension of curfew and lockdown. They were facing acute starvation. As there were travel restrictions, non-governmental organisations could not come and provide succour to the islanders, he pointed out.","No starvation in Lakshadweep, administration tells HC",RICE

As regards urad dal, the hike has not been that perceptible.Barring Puducherry, rice has remained stable in Tamil Nadu. The position of wheat is similar in the State and even in the Union Territory too. In fact, in Coimbatore, the price of wheat has seen a downward trend  a decline of 6 a kg.A veteran administrator said that the situation in the State is part of the all-India feature as the country has been meeting, through imports, a large chunk of requirements of edible oil and pulses. The price increase of edible oil is sharper than that of pulses due to two reasons  a jump in international prices and a higher import duty. The Centre is considering the question whether it can reduce the duty so that there will be a fall in the prices. However, there is another view that the reduction might lead to further increase in the prices internationally in view of the anticipated higher demand from India.K.R. Shanmugam, director of the Madras School of Economics, said that the prices of egg and non-vegetarian food too [both of which are not included in the list of commodities being monitored by the Central department] have witnessed a sharp rise over the past year.What the administrator and the economist agree on is that the conventional rules of supply and demand dynamics are not applicable at present on account of the lockdown. Despite the transportation of essential commodities being exempted from the lockdown, their movement and availability are not completely insulated from the restrictions. Consequently, this has a bearing on their prices.A senior official in the State government said that the government has got the Price Stabilisation Fund to manage any situation.Besides, through the special public distribution system, palm oil and tur dal are being provided at subsidised rates, he said.","Edible oil, tur dal becoming dearer",RICE

The 16-year-old has been here for one-and-a-half hours, having arrived at 7.30 am with her pink school backpack  this time to carry home rations promised by the Delhi government.Both my parents restarted work just a few days ago, so I am here. I came yesterday also but the rations finished after 15 people had received them. I reached early today, hoping to get a token. I called my class teacher too to ask if she knew when the supply would come, but she said she didnt know, Pooja said.Under the drive that started June 5, the Delhi government is giving 4 kg wheat and 1 kg rice to people not covered by the PDS as a one-time benefit, with schools set up as distribution centres. The government estimated two lakh people would avail of the scheme initially, with the numbers going up to 20 lakh as per demand and need assessment.However, a Food and Supplies Department official said, the numbers are much more than the government envisaged. The initial supply for 2 lakh beneficiaries got exhausted in two days. Following that, we placed an order for 8 lakh beneficiaries on June 7. As and when this is arriving, it is being distributed to schools, said the official.On Thursday, anger bubbled among those standing in queue, on one of the seasons hottest days, outside a government school in Sangam Vihar. A note stuck to its large metal gate read: Ration khatam ho gaya hai, jab aayega milega. Pataa nahin kab tak aayega (Ration is over, you will get it when it comes. Dont know when that will be).Having returned empty-handed earlier too, several argued with the school guards over the lack of supplies.Today is the fourth day Ive come to find there are no supplies. Every day we come in the morning and wait in the heat hoping that the van with the ration will come. I wait till 2 pm in a galli (lane) near the school, where there is some shade. After that, the school guards send us away, said Birna, 32.She worked as a domestic worker until two months ago, when the latest round of Covid restrictions began. Her daily wage labourer husband started getting work again just two days ago.Next to her, Anita, 35, muttered, Ration toh nahin milega, corona milega (We may not get ration, but we will definitely get Covid).The Indian Express visited four schools across the Capital to find the situation was the same. Some people decided it was pointless to wait and left after enquiring about the status of supplies.At 11 am, there are no people outside a school in Hauz Rani, with a note similar to the one at the Sangam Vihar school stuck at the gate: The previous ration is over. The fresh stock hasnt arrived.At a school in Chirag Delhi, Meena, 28, a domestic worker, said she had stopped by to see if the distribution had restarted. On the first day, I reached at 5 am, hoping to be among the first to receive the ration. When the gate finally opened at around 10, there was such a rush and so much pushing and shoving that I didnt get a token. Only a few people got supplies.She said she had returned the following days too, only to go back disappointed. Since I have just rejoined work, and only at one house, Ive decided not to waste my time here.Meena added that with both her and her husband, a driver, not getting enough work, they have not been able to pay house rent for five months.Among those standing at the Chirag Delhi school gate is Pradeep Mandal, 60. He came right after a 12-hour shift as a security guard, which ended at 8 am. He retained his job during the Covid restrictions, but his wife lost hers as a caretaker.I came yesterday as well after my shift and waited till 11 am, Mandal said.

2021-06-10,https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/centres-farm-laws-narendra-modi-government-minimum-support-price-paddy-crop-7353364/,"The political fallout of the movement against the Centres farm laws is showing. The Narendra Modi government has raised the minimum support price (MSP) of the 2021-22 paddy crop by Rs 72 per quintal, to Rs 1,940 for common and Rs 1,960 for Grade A varieties. This increase, of slightly over 4.8 per cent, might seem modest. It is also true that cultivation costs  particularly on account of diesel used for powering tractors, irrigation pumps and harvester combines  have gone up. But that does not justify an MSP increase now, when rice and wheat stocks in public godowns have, for the first time, crossed the 100 million tonnes (mt) mark. Government agencies have procured over 97 mt of these two cereals from the 2020-21 crop so far, breaking even the previous years record of 91 mt. When granaries are already overflowing  distribution of free grain under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana, over and above existing National Food Security Act entitlements, has made little difference  encouraging more paddy and wheat production makes no economic sense. Farmers should actually be discouraged to grow them, along with sugarcane, as they are water-guzzling to boot.But it isnt economics and agro-ecology alone. The government should be promoting crop and animal agriculture that also leads to consumption of foods rich in proteins, vitamins, minerals and dietary fibre  as against just calories and sugar  by the people. The right way to do it is by freezing the MSPs of paddy and wheat, besides capping their procurement at, say, 10-15 quintal per acre per farmer. This must be combined with higher MSPs for pulses, oilseeds and millets. The MSPs of tur and urad are up by Rs 300 per quintal for the coming season, while even more (Rs 452/quintal) in the case of sesamum. But the absence of assured procurement means farmers have no incentive to cultivate them. Instead, they are likely to further expand the area under paddy and wheat, perpetuating the most economically, environmentally and nutritionally perverse cropping pattern.The reasons for the Modi government taking the beaten track are obvious. Since the launch of the farmer agitation, it has been under pressure to demonstrate that its reform laws arent aimed at ending MSP-based procurement. Its not for nothing that government agencies have bought all time high quantities of paddy and wheat this time from Punjab, where the protests have also been the loudest. With the state headed for polls early next year, and the ruling party forced on to the defensive following the mishandling of the pandemics second wave and the electoral defeat in West Bengal, a renewal of the movement is seen as politically inopportune. Once again, it is politics that has taken the drivers seat.",The beaten track,RICE

Because there is a biggerand simplerway to fight the coronavirus than the vaccine, and Indians just arent using it well. Its the mask. Even before vaccines cameHealth costsNEW DELHI: In the shadows of the Taj Mahal, shoemaker Shyambabu Nigam worked for years to save enough money to buy his wife Anju a small house with a view of the iconic 17th century mausoleum. Yet in just a matter of months, they were forced to give it up.After Anju fell seriously ill with Covid-19 last year, the couple turned to a mix of subsidized government hospitals and more expensive private clinics to treat the illness and pay for two open-heart surgeries that followed. The total costs amounted to more than 600,000 rupees ($8,230)  roughly six times Nigams annual income.While the sale of his modest two-bedroom house covered most of that amount, he was also forced to borrow money from friends and sell one of his three leather sewing machines.First we fought to save her life and now we are fighting to survive with a huge financial burden, said Nigam, 42, from the room he now rents in a low-income village of Kachhpura near Agra in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh. Please give us any work. My two sons and I will work day and night to get out of this crisis.Nigam is among roughly two-thirds of Indians that dont have any health insurance, compounding the problems facing Indias economy as it tries to recover from the shock of a rare contraction last year. Overcrowded government hospitals with long lines and poor facilities prompt people to spend out of pocket for better treatment in the private sector.While the virus has affected the poor across the globe, the impact can be exponentially greater in countries like India where public spending on health care is among the lowest in the world. The signs of pain are everywhere: Loans against gold and debt defaults are rising while savings, vehicle sales, company profits and government revenues are falling.There has also been a clear shift in consumer spending from clothes, shoes and personal care goods toward pharmaceuticals, as medication shortages and panic prompted many Indians to sell motorcycles, gold and even their farm animals to pay for life-saving treatment on the black market. The soaring expenses included vials of the antiviral drug remdesivir as well as private ambulances that ferried desperate families scouring for hospital beds and oxygen cylinders.This time what we see is the double whammy of health expenses plus loss of livelihood and related food insecurity, said Dipa Sinha, a professor of economics at Ambedkar University in Delhi. If people are selling assets that give them livelihood then it impacts future incomes as well.Making matters worse, until recently government-approved treatment guidelines included some medicine not recommended by the World Health Organization. Until early June, India health ministrys approved treatment protocol listed remdesivir even though the global health body discouraged use of the drug for Covid-19 in late 2020 after a large international clinical trial showed that it offered negligible protection against death in hospitalized patients.The government had also recommended other untested therapies such as the anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine and Ivermectin, an anti-parasitic treatment. Convalescent plasma therapy remained on the list despite the Indian Council of Medical Researchs own studies finding little benefit.Officials from the National Health Authority, responsible for implementing countrys flagship public health insurance program, did not respond to multiple requests for comment, nor did a spokesperson for the federal Ministry of Health.In rural areas, people are either left to die or go bankrupt trying to find that life-saver drug or other solution, said Ajay Mahal, a professor in health economics and global health systems research and deputy director of the Nossal Institute for Global Health at the University of Melbourne.The state should begin by offering people an option  a strong and affordable primary care sector  instead of leaving them to their devices to unqualified providers and running around getting drugs from pharmacists, fake or genuine, he added.In 2018, Prime Minister Narendra Modi unveiled a flagship program dubbed the worlds largest health insurance plan offering financial risk protection against catastrophic health expenditure to roughly 107 million poor and vulnerable families  or close to 40% of the population. Yet the new policy hasnt effectively improved access to health care, according to a working paper by Duke University researchers.Even government-run hospitals can be costly for the poor: Nigam said he paid a subsidized rate of 200,000 rupees for one of his wifes bypass surgeries. I dont have government health insurance because I didnt know I was eligible, he said. Now I am trying, but there is a long backlog.The rising medical debt poses a risk for Modi ahead of key state elections next year, including one in Uttar Pradesh  the countrys most populous state  where Nigam lives. His governments approval ratings have fallen to 51% this year from 75% in 2019, according to a survey released May 29 by LocalCircles, an India-based polling company. Modis personal approval rating dipped to 66% on June 8, down from a high of 76% a year earlier, Morning Consults Global Leader Rating Tracker found.Even before the pandemic struck, Indias out-of-pocket expenses on health care were among the highest in the world, accounting for about 60% of total health expenditure. Public health spending  including both the federal and state governments  hovered well below 2% of gross domestic product, a number that rises to 3.5% when including the private sector. That compares with 5.4% of GDP in China and a global average of nearly 10%, according to World Bank data.While theres no data on how many Indians have been pushed to financial ruin by medical debt, researchers at Azim Premji University found that the virus erased decades of gains by pushing an additional 230 million  more than the entire population of Pakistan  into poverty last year. More than 90% of people borrowed a median amount of 15,000 rupees during the pandemic, they said, adding that the impact is expected to persist.Loans taken to meet out-of-pocket expenses on health can be more damaging than other household debt because the illness limits ones ability to work, leading to depletion of household savings and unanticipated economic shocks, said Sunil Kumar Sinha, an economist with India Ratings and Research.A study in April and May among a poor community in the eastern state of Jharkhand that found 58% had already borrowed money and 11% had sold assets during the pandemic, according to John Paul, director of the Centre for Rural Development at The/Nudge Foundation. With no fallback options like savings or insurance, even basic necessities like food have become a challenge to poor households, he said.Deep in Indias hinterland the crisis is even more dire, with villagers being forced to reduce their food intake in order to pay for treatment.In Jharkhand, 24-year-old Soni Devi borrowed 10,000 rupees and sold three of the familys six pigs to pay for Covid treatment for her mother and three children. Now shes struggling to feed her family.There is not much rice left at home, said Devi. We will die if we dont get work.",Indians already ravaged by virus now slammed with medical debt,RICE

However, pesticides used in fields pose a major threat to the birds by either killing them or affecting their calcium metabolism and making the shells of their eggs very fragile, according to researchers of the Salim Ali Centre for Ornithology and Natural History (SACON).The SACON recently carried out a study Assessment of status, distribution and threats to the population of threatened Sarus Crane Antigone in Gujarat . It was observed that chlorpyrifos (one of the most widely used active ingredients in agricultural insect control products) showed strong relation with eggshell thickness. However, due to lack of published information on the role of chlorpyrifos in eggshell thinning, we are unable to make any interpretation. Nevertheless, the presence of chlorpyrifos residue in the eggs is a matter of concern since its metabolite is a proven reproductive toxicant, the study stated.SMuralidharan, the incharge director of SACON, said, Use of certain pesticides results in reduced calcium metabolism. It interferes with supply of calcium that is essential for eggshell formation. If the eggshell is thin, it will be crushed as soon as the mother sits on it for hatching and will definitely reduce the population of sarus cranes.Muralidharan, who was also the principal investigator in the study, said that pesticides also result in the death of the birds. The study said that it could indirectly harm the already endangered bird by reducing its food base. It is a fact that birds have the tendency to skip breeding if they do not perceive food security to raise chicks,it said. Also, there is a huge possibility that it ingests pesticides while feeding on treated seeds.Of the 15 species of cranes found in the world, six are found in India. Only sarus crane (Grus Antigone) is a resident species. The highest numbers of observations of sarus crane were recorded in the districts of Ahmedabad (39%) followed by Anand (36%), and Kheda (11%). The study states that the calculated population was estimated to be around1,788.The study states that tissues of seven birds collected from three districts for toxicological investigations. The presence of chlorpyrifos, HCH, DDT, endosulfan and heptachlor were detected frequently. While endosulfan and heptachlor were the least-detected pesticides, chlorpyrifos was detected more frequently in the tissues. A total of 179 food samples of sarus crane comprising rice paddy, wheat, fish, and insects were collected and 42 pooled samples were analyzed for pesticide residue. Among the 67 pesticides analyzed, 12 pesticides were detected and of these chlorpyrifos was the most frequently detected pesticide followed by thiamethoxam.While 104 samples of soil were collected from nesting and congregation sites, 60 pooled samples were analyzed for residues of pesticides. Of the 67 pesticides for which analysis was done, 23 pesticides were found at varying levels.The study suggested, It is adequately clear that problems due to pesticides exist at varying magnitudes in the state. Advising complete halt on chemicals might be the easiest recommendation, but practice may not be possible at once.",Guj: Pesticides in fields turn killers for sarus cranes,RICE

The beneficiaries should be encouraged to wear masks and use hand sanitisers.All FPSs have been asked to distribute food grains and sugar on all seven days of the week between 9 am and 1 pm and from 3 pm to 7 pm in compliance of the directions of the Delhi high court to ensure uninterrupted supply of food grains to the PDS beneficiaries.At present, Delhi has around 1.78 million ration card holder households, which are divided into three categories -- priority households (PR), priority state households (PRS), and Antyodaya Anna Yojana (AAY) families.The beneficiaries under the PR and PRS categories are entitled to 5 kg of food grains per month, while AAY households receive 25 kg wheat, 10 kg rice and 1 kg sugar.The city government distributes rations through a network of around 2,000 fair price shops.

Of the 1,221 working state PSUs, 53 together earned a profit of Rs 574.49 crore while 58 PSUs together incurred a loss of Rs 1796.55 crore.The report pointed out that deficiencies in planning and implementation of Bus Terminals-cum Shopping Complexes (BTSCs) by KSRTC led to delay in completion and inadequate collection of interest-free security deposit for financing the construction. This resulted in loss of licence fee (Rs 25.59 lakh) in three BTSCs, refund of IFSD (Rs 50.95 lakh) in one BTSC, reduced realisation of IFSD (Rs 19.56 lakh) in one BTSC and extra expenditure (Rs 4.57 lakh) in one BTSC. Delay in conducting tender-cum-auction to rent out the vacant spaces in completed BTSCs resulted in under-utilisation of commercial areas.The audit report observed that non-adherence to state government guidelines for implementing e-governance initiatives affected timely implementation of ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) systems in seven PSUs. Five PSUs could not derive any benefit even after incurring Rs 1.15 crore due to non-completion of ERP systems. Similarly delay in energy audit, failure to achieve specific energy consumption norms and non-availing of open access facility led to extra expenditure. In another similar instance, non-procurement of adequate quantity of paddy by PSUs led to under-utilisation and idling of paddy processing capacity established by spending Rs 21.85 crore. Only a meagre quantity of the total rice produced was channelled through public distribution system, thus hindering the objective of ensuring fair price to farmers and rice at a reasonable rate to consumers.Delay in completing civil works, deficiency in tendering and denial of consultancy fee by State Poultry Development Corporation resulted in avoidable delay in completing Hi-tech Commercial Layer Farm project and idling of investment amounting to Rs 7.31 crore, said the report.Major profit-making PSUsKerala State Financial Enterprises LtdRs 144.41 crore in 2017-18Kerala Minerals andMetals LtdRs 104.46 cr in 2018-19Kerala State Beverages CorporationRS 85.93 crore in 2016-17Kerala State Cashew Development Corporation Rs 61.59 crore in 2013-14Major loss-making PSUsKerala State Road Transport CorporationRs 1,431.29 crore in 2014-15Kerala State Textiles CorporationRs 53.17 crore in 2014-15Kerala State Civil Supplies CorporationRs 25.91 crore in 2015-16Travancore Titanium Products LtdRs 23.63 crore in 2014-15","Kerala public sector units incurred loss of Rs 1,222 crore in 2018-19: CAG",RICE

(Twitter/England)England did enough to beat a disappointing Croatia team in their opening Euro 2020 game on Sunday with the biggest plus being the performance of central midfielder Kalvin Phillips.The three points put England in a strong position in Group D ahead of Fridays match against Scotland, also at Wembley Stadium, but the main questions over Gareth Southgates team remain unanswered.Croatia are a slower and less talented team than the one which beat England in the semi-finals of the World Cup in 2018 and without Ivan Rakitic in midfield and striker Mario Mandzukic, they depend too much on 35-year-old playmaker Luka Modric.That meant that Englands defence, including the inexperienced Tyrone Mings, did not face the kind of examination they will likely come up against in the knockout stages.There were two main positives that came out of the game  Raheem Sterling, low on confidence after a poor end to the season with Manchester City, was full of verve and will be boosted by getting the winning goal.Sterling was chosen ahead of Marcus Rashford on the left of the England attack and justified that decision, even if the erratic nature of his finishing was displayed on a couple of occasions.Yet it was Phillips display in the centre of midfield that really was the major plus point for Southgate.Great way to kick off the tournament  Some team!

He has had a fantastic start to his international career. I thought he was immense throughout the game, said Southgate.There were some concerns though. Captain Harry Kane looked tired and provided little threat and Phil Foden, who started so brightly, faded out of the game too quickly.Yet with Jordan Henderson not yet back to full fitness, the emergence of Phillips gives Southgate options for when the tougher tests come along.",Euro 2020: Kalvin Phillips the biggest plus in England’s first-ever opener win,RICE

But we have seen a growing trend of a large number of people, at times numbering more than 100, coming to the island with relief distribution teams and they are violating Covid protocols, which can actually do more harm to the villagers. We are not against the help but we have asked them to seek prior permission and limit the number of people accompanying them with the relief items, said Hasna Banu Bibi, the village Pradhan.During multiple visits to the island post Yaas , TOI has also found a large group of people heading to the villages with limited packs of relief items. There has also been a similar situation in Digha and Tajpur areas. While some groups head towards the sea to enjoy a beach walk amidst the safety restrictions, some others get busy doing videography and conducting social media lives in a bid to show off their act of philanthropy.Last week, there was a group of 60 people carrying only two sacks of rice and four crates of mineral water. They booked eight totos for a tour to the island while dropping the relief items before a group of villagers. People also come with used and torn clothes that are unwearable, said Sheikh Monirul, a Mousuni villager.Meanwhile, such relief tourism is causing a large scale river pollution with relief workers littering plastic bottles, thermocol plates and plastic bags in the water and it has become a matter of grave concern for the district administration in Sunderbans.Such has been the extent of pollution that we have started a project to collect discarded plastic bottles and other non-biodegradable waste from the entire coastal area. We have also deployed a special team at all the prominent ghats to instruct people not to litter plastic waste in the Sunderbans and limit the number of participants heading for distribution, said P Ulaganathan, the South 24 Parganass district magistrate.Last week, chief minister Mamata Banerjee had also urged the NGOs to work in coordination with the district administration while distributing relief items. Most NGOs approach us and we guide them to the right islands and villages. Only a few violate protocols that cause all the trouble, the DM said.Indrajit Basu, additional superintendent of Baruipur police division, said The way plastic bottles and thermocol plates are floating in Sunderbans rivers is extremely worrying.

While pushcart vendors were given the much-needed push, infection-weary customers relied heavily on e-commerce for fresh produce.What was once a touch-and-feel experience soon became a click and order affair. As we enter into another week of lockdown with a few many restrictions lifted the threat still looms large. Encouraging customers to exercise caution, Vaishali Vijaykumar brings you a round-up of eight city-based, farm-to-table stores that promise to deliver fresh produce at your doorstep.AngadiNarendira Bharathis vision for Angadi is pretty simple  freshly procured veggies at an affordable cost. Started in February 2021, the online platform caters to residents in T Nagar, Saidapet, Mambalam, Mylapore, Mandaveli, Thiruvanmiyur and Teynampet. From collaboration to delivery, I take care of everything single-handedly. Hence theres a restriction in the number of areas we deliver to. The idea is to cut down as much cost as possible, so I had to keep my business model simple. The vegetable list is updated every day and people can place their orders the previous day. I purchase only what is required to ensure theres no wastage or spill-over to the next day, explains Narendira. It was the long waiting period with bigger players in the e-grocery market that prompted him to start one of his own. I get about 15-20 orders. The profit is minimal but Im satisfied. The delivery is done early in the morning, he says, adding that there is a plan to expand the product list soon.For details, call: 9840178917 or visit Instagram page: angadi_f2hMadras FarmersMadras Farmers started in February 2021 by Mohammed Sayeed and Ayesha Nawab is all about uplifting struggling farmers and providing them with a sustainable livelihood. We wanted to help the farmers working at our strawberry farm in Ooty. They suffered a big loss because of the pandemic. We started on a small-scale with just strawberries, but now we offer a range of fruits like orange and berries and exotic vegetables such as brussel sprouts, herbs and broccoli. We cater to over 20-40 orders each day and patrons are intimated on Instagram when a fresh stock comes in, says the husband-wife duo, who operate out of a small warehouse near their home in Kilpauk. They hope to rope in more farmers and expand their product list. We believe in a healthy competition where we want to coexist with other players. If we dont have a particular item then we would direct them to a vendor who sells it. Its all about empowering each other in times of crisis, says Ayesha.They deliver across the city. Orders need to be placed a day in advance.

Right from spices to seasonings, their online platform has an exhaustive list of products sourced from local vendors. We have in-house delivery partners who follow safety protocols. We take the utmost care with packing. The delivery window is open all day so people will get their orders delivered the very next day or the same day. We ship to all parts of the city, says Muthiah. Besides regular orders, the platform provides timely groceries to caterers and hospital canteens that prepare food for COVID-19 patients. Well-wishers who want to support the underprivileged with dry ration reach out to us. So we prioritise distributing those orders as well. Weve tied up with gated communities and supply in case of bulk orders, adds Muthiah. They have special offers every month for their clients.The app is available for Android and iOS users. For details, visit: ekartgroceries.comT2zfruitzIt was the difficulty in scouting for seasonal and exotic fruits during the lockdown last year that prompted husband-wife duo Mohammed Tabrez and Tabina to explore this market. After gauging the requirements and tying up with local vendors, Mohammed started catering fruits to his immediate circle of 60-70 families. After a spike in demand, the Royapettah-based IT professional realised the scope for starting his full-time business. And thats how T2zfruitz came into being in December 2020. Oranges and berries were doing well in April. Since the summer season, mango has been the crowd-puller. Nuts have also been in demand due to immune-boosting properties. Every day, we update our item list on the mobile app depending on the availability of fresh produce, says Mohammed.They deliver across the city. Orders can be placed one day in advance. Minimum orders of `500 are accepted.

And it came true in March 2021 with the launch of their organic store Thottam Organic in Anna Nagar. The shop provides fresh vegetables and fruits brought from their farm in Tiruttani. The duo emphasises that new stock is bought every Wednesday and Friday. Its not an easy task to practise organic farming but we are particular about the quality. Weve also tied up with organically certified skincare, A2 milk, and snack brands. Some of our best-sellers have been 21 varieties of spinach, bananas, brinjals, berries, ghee and snacks. Its the flexible rapport with customers that has helped us build a loyal clientele in a short span. There are going to be new players now and then, but the demand for basics will never subside, says Abishek. The duo will be introducing more of their farm-grown products soon.Chennai GrocersA self-confessed foodie and passionate home chef, Nikkita Vibhu felt helpless when the restaurants closed down during the lockdown last summer. Her friends turned home chefs overnight to satiate their cravings. This propelled a sudden surge in the requirements of gourmet products. Tapping on this situation, Nikkita roped in popular brands and kicked off Chennai Grocers in May 2020. Located on Cathedral Road, the store has fruits, vegetables, dairy, snacks, munchies, vegan goodies, condiments and meat. There was persistent demand for exotic ingredients. We even included baking essentials because there were so many active home bakers undertaking party orders in the lockdown. Its evident that people dont mind splurging to please their taste buds, shares Nikkita.They deliver across the city. Orders need to be placed a day in advance on their website or through WhatsApp. For details, call: 9884443064 or visit www.chennaigrocers.comCholayil Farm to TableLaunched just before the pandemic in 2020, Cholayil Farm to Table is a cosy grocery store in Anna Nagar. Driven by a passion to promote local produce, the shop has an elaborate list of provisions, masalas and spices, pulses, dry fruits, natural sweeteners, oil and ghee, rice and grains, pickles and jams, flour, tea, coffee, dairy, snack, ready-to-cook, cold-pressed juice and almond milk. All of them are ethically sourced from small-scale vendors, emphasises Susmera Cholayil, the owner. We have a big farm from where we source the vegetables and fruits. We also procure avocados from Kodaikanal, grapes and passion fruit from Coonoor and food by home chefs. Our mangoes are doing extremely well in this season. Fresh harvest from the farm comes on Tuesdays and Fridays so patrons are intimated accordingly. They can either drop by or we deliver it at their doorstep, she says.Delivery is free within a radius of three km. Patrons can place their order on WhatsApp or through Instagram.For details, visit Instagram: Cholayil Farm to Table, or call: 7550155005Madras BasketThe pandemic-induced lockdown forced R Karthik, a travel consultant, to switch careers. After the tourism industry collapsed, he was looking for alternate avenues to explore. It was the surge in demand for essentials among people that seeded the idea of starting a supermarket in July 2020. Located in Virugambakkam, Madras Basket caters to over 40 orders a day from around the city. My wife Rajakumari and I tied up with a few vendors in Poonamallee and sourced fresh fruits and vegetables. Initially, we sold them on pushcarts and it was a hit. Upon studying the market, I realised that most people preferred their vegetables to be delivered by the first half of the morning and thats precisely what we did. We do take orders for monthly provisions if theres demand. But fruits and vegetables are doing well, says Karthik. Minimum orders of `399 are expected to be placed a day in advance. The store has an in-house delivery team and has tied up with partners to ship across the city. They will be launching an app and website shortly.For details, visit Instagram page: Madras Basket or call 9361925001",Here are 8 Chennai-based stores that will deliver fresh produce to your homes,RICE

Before we decipher the names of the dishes, she enthusiastically declares, Namma Tamizh influence dhan! Cocadas  Thengai barfi, arroz  paal payasam, jamoncillos  therattipal/pal kova.Two traditionally and historically very rich communities have strikingly similar foods and the Mexican cuisine has very strong Tamizh influences, she shares, drawing more parallels between the popular corn tortillas and sola roti, Mexican rice and thakkali soru, totopos and appalam. The ancient Tamils were international traders and wherever they went, they left an inimitable trace of their presence.Linguistic evidences claim how the Mayans were Tamils from Ceylon and there was a strong Tamil presence in Mesoamerica too. Thats why we find such influences and similarities in the cuisine, among other aspects, she explains, giving us a peek into the origins of another popular dish from the Mexican cuisine  Tamale. The dish is similar to our Ilai adai/kozhukattai.While Tamale is widely understood as a word for wrapped food, the etymology of the word Tamal, in ancient Tamil simply means husk or leaf. The leaves of the Tamalam tree are called Tamala Pathram in Tamil. There are mentions of the Tamale in ancient Tamil poems including one written by poet Kabilar in his Kurinji songs from the Tamil Sangam era, she details, diving into a maze of historical references.A reaching through recipesPriya, through her Instagram page, has been serving history of the Tamizh lands food culture to fellow enthusiasts and Tamilanders. Started in 2018 as a simple page to share her culinary prowess and ancient Tamil food recipes, the page took a turn when Priyas enthusiastic hunt on the Gram for a similar page led her to a dead end. I found pages that discussed the history of multiple other global cuisines but there were close to none for the Tamil cuisine.At least the ones that talked about its history. I was inspired by Karim Moyer-Nocchi, a professor, who runs a historical Italian food Instag ram pa g e and I decided to dive into creating one for Tamizh food, says the blogger, with a degree in mechanical engineering and industrial engineering. We are engrossed as we scroll down her page. The grids are dotted with the vernacular names of vegetables  Vidhaiavarai (beans), Pachai poo kosu (broccoli), Senkizhangu or Akkaraikizhangu (beetroot); with mouthwatering traditional recipes, and laced with pearls of Tamil wisdom.We are made aware that the widely commercialised Mulligatawny soup is nothing but milagu thanneer (Pepper water), an ancient name given to rasam, a dish infused with black pepper and tamarind extract. During ancient times, this was not served with rice. It was served in a mann paanai to drink at the end of the meal as it helped in digestion. The Britishers decided to thicken it with tomatoes, vegetables and sometimes even meat to make it consumable with a spoon.Now, our milagu thaneer is popular across the globe. Popular brands have processed it into ready-tomake soups too without crediting its origins. How many of us realise this? Kezhvaragus (finger millet) history in the Tamil context can be traced back to about 4,000 years, The name idli is derived from Ittu, Avi (Pour and steam), Thosai (Dosa) from Thoithu sei (Ferment and use), There are mentions about Thosai even in Sangam literature In our 30-odd-minute conversation, Priya peppers almost every minute with an interesting tidbit about the Tamizhland.Research, serve, repeatPriya spends at least five hours daily to read and collect information about different dishes that have now either been anglicised or are lost in time. There are books, scholarly researches and multiple channels that give insights into our food history. Researcher Orissa Balus talks have been a guide too. We just need to spend time to look, learn and share, offers Priya, whose page following is slowly inching towards the 3,000 mark.I receive a lot of support from Tamils from across the globe. It is interesting how those who are not living in their motherland now, are the most concerned and interested about their history. When something is so accessible to you, you dont value it and fail to preserve and appreciate it. A lot of support has come from second-generation Tamils from the Eelam too, beams Priya, who also conducts Instagram live cooking classes.The idea is to bring global attention to what we already have and hopefully revive what weve lost, she shares. Priya also conducts cooking classes on request. One of my longest cooking class was with an American on preparing a Banana Leaf virundhu. It went on for four hours, but we had the most fun! she laughs.Creative pursuitsWhile it takes a lot of effort to put together content that is authentic to Tamizh history, it is often met with cynicism from different pockets, informs Priya. But her husband has been a wall of support and a sounding board in her journey. I have a habit of connecting contemporary events with historical references. Not a lot of people have the patience to listen to them. But he does! He is perhaps the only one (besides my followers) who listens to all of it, shares the creative.Currently, she is working in collaboration with @WhatthePottu exploring and documenting the food and lives of early humans from the five Tamizh thinnais (Tamil poetical- geographical landscapes).

If it is not mentioned, the scheme cant incur expenditure directly from the government exchequer, informed a government official who didnt want to be named.In July last year, after giving cabinet approval for the scheme, Kejriwal had recollected his earlier days in politics and said how the NGO Parivartan, which was run by him and his deputy Manish Sisodia, fought for slum dwellers.We used to struggle for people to get their ration. There was a huge mafia and we were attacked several times for fighting for people, Kejriwal said at the time.Recently, Kejriwal wrote to Prime Minister Modi requesting him to approve the scheme for the sake of national interest.However, as per the findings of this newspaper, not even a single word about this scheme is mentioned in this years Deshbhakti budget presented in March.Similarly, the scheme which was in the works since 2018, does not find any mention in the previous fiscals budget as well.The Delhi Sarkari Ration Dealers Sangh, which has filed a writ petition in court, stated that the scheme is an attempt to formulate a parallel privately owned Targeted Public Distribution System (TPDS), which is completely against the National Food Security Act 2013 and the rules framed under the Public Distribution Control Order, 2001.The objective of Kejriwals scheme is to pack wheat flour, rice and sugar and deliver them to beneficiaries.For this, three separate tenders have been floated till now and 16 private agencies have been selected.Divided in to two separate stages, the scheme involves empanelment of private agencies to deliver the package at the doorstep of beneficiary with a conversion charge of Rs 2 per kg of wheat.Delhi government has given the job of implementation of the scheme to Delhi State Civil Supply Corporation, with an estimated cost of Rs 677 crore.According to the petitioners, the NFS Act and the PDCO rules do not permit any conversion of the food grains into any other item. In the instant case wheat cant be converted into atta (flour) and a third party cant be intervened in the PDS process.The scheme is detrimental to the PDS. The NFS Act allows reforms in the PDS but without violating the basic rules. The scheme has not been mentioned in the past two budgets.

I felt Marcus Rashford would give us that energy. At that point we had got to try and get the goal,"" Southgate said.""We have to make these decisions based on what we see. We're still working on those patterns.""We're playing a high level of games under the intensity and to find space tonight was difficult. Scotland played well and we weren't able to open them up.""- 'Make the right decisions' -Isolated by Scotland's clever game-plan, Kane received minimal support from Raheem Sterling, Phil Foden and Mason Mount.Jack Grealish's introduction off the bench gave England more energy and Kane would surely relish the chance to feed off the Aston Villa playmaker.""I think the whole team, we have got to look at the whole performance and our use of the ball and review where we can be better,"" Southgate said when asked about Kane.""That's right across the board, so it's not just about one person. Scotland, I thought, marked him extremely well.""Whether the England manager will opt to replace Kane with Rashford or Everton's Dominic Calvert-Lewin for the crucial Czech clash is another matter entirely.Dropping a player with 34 England goals would be a hugely brave call.Asked if he would make changes for the Czech game, Southgate said: ""We will see how everyone is, prepare for a different type of opponent and make the right decisions.""Kane had also been hauled off in the final minutes against Croatia after failing to trouble the visitors.The 27-year-old took his second successive substitution on the chin, saying: ""It's part of the game. The manager felt that was the right decision so you just have to take it. It is what it is.""It was a tough game. Scotland defended really well. We know no game is going to be easy it's a European Championship and Scotland are playing for their lives.""England midfielder Declan Rice offered a glimmer of hope as he insisted Kane will thrive once he gets better service.""Scotland nailed their game-plan and nullified Harry Kane.

Rakul Preet wrote: Many of us think that rice is fattening! No it isnt. On the contrary, its the easiest form of carbs to digest for the body. It heals the gut which in turn helps in better absorption of nutrients.Most importantly its basic food and easily available even during lockdown.

It is false that weight gain is proportional to the quantity of rice you eat, but there are many who fear this cereal.They go to the extent of saying that if they eat rice in the afternoon, they will gain weight by evening. But if we look at the major cereals, they release a similar amount of calories. Be it rice, wheat, ragi, millets or even legumes, 100 gm of each of these release calories between 320 to 375. What these cereals differ in is their nutrient profile. For example, wheat and ragi have more fibre than the others. Polishing rice takes away its nutrients, and thereby, hand-pounded rice or brown rice can be alternative options.But if you are taking white rice in limited portions, you can easily include it in your meals. Dr B Sujeeth Kumar, a consultant surgeon, said: White rice is deficient in bran and germ layer, and hence does not have any nutrients and fibre. An easy way to make rice more nutritious is to have it with lentils and green leafy vegetables. This combination brings down the glycemic index of rice, which means sugar is absorbed in the body over three-four hours without causing any sudden spike in blood sugar.This leads to less hunger pangs and prevents overeating. At the end of the day, it is not the fault of the rice that you are gaining weight. If you are eating rice with oily curries and fried sides, it increases the total calories of a meal. Also, lack of portion control too can provide you more calories than you can burn. The body stores the leftover calories as fat, and that is how people gain weight, adds Dr Janaki.A layered thingOuter layer of rice - B vitaminsInner layer - carbohydrates, amino acidsPolishing reduces B vitamins and fibre contentRice and feversRice kanji (gruel) is an excellent potion to have if one contracts the virus. It can bring down fever andalso relieve the body of aches. Another good side of this grain is that it is gluten-free. The starch and B vitamins in rice also makes it a calming agent which can reduce stress and anxiety.Recommended portionA tightly-packed cup (250 ml) of rice per meal is recommended for adults, even for those who are trying to lose weight.Okay for diabetics?Rice has a high glycaemic index (70), which makes diabetics jittery about having it. The index is ameasure of how quickly a food causes our blood sugar levels to rise. However, if we take rice with dal, vegetables, curd etc., the GI comes down to around 50. When the food becomes complex, the GI getsreduced.TRY THESE QUICK RECIPESVEGETABLE SAFFRON RICE PILAFINGREDIENTS:2 cups long grain rice (Basmati)2 tbsp unsalted butter2 tbsp olive oil1 large onion (chopped)2-4 cloves of garlic ( finely chopped)1/4 cup fresh or frozen peas*1 red or yellow bell pepper (chopped*)1 carrot (peeled and chopped*)1/2 tsp salt (or to taste)1/2 tsp white pepper1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley4 1/2 cups (about 1 litre) vegetable stock1/2 tsp saffron threadsMETHOD:Make vegetable stock using carrot,celery, leeks onion and bay leafAdd white wine and sautHeat olive oil in a pan, add onion and saut it until transparent.

This defeats the basic purpose of transparency in distribution of the subsidised foodgrains to the right beneficiary. They have not complied with several provisions of the Act since October 2013, said a source.This comes amid a row between the Centre and the Delhi government over PDS grain supply in the national capital. The Arvind Kejriwal government has blamed the Centre for blocking its ration at doorstep plan.In a communication to the food secretary-cum-commissioner of Delhi government, the food ministry wrote on Thursday that the Centre has been pursuing the distribution of foodgrains from all FPSs using e-PoS machines for the last three years. More than 12 letters/ DOs have been written to GNCTD from all levels in this department. However, the distribution of foodgrains in Delhi is still being done using old/ manual register-based mechanisms, it said.The Delhi government in April 2018 temporarily suspended distribution of ration through the e-PoS system. The Centre wants the Delhi government to implement e-PoS distribution of foodgrains from all ration shops for rightful targeting of the beneficiaries.The ministry said it is in violation of the NFSA. The letter said the use of e-PoS machines is necessary for implementation of One Nation-One Ration Card, which will benefit migrant beneficiaries. It has flagged that the city government has not put in place any machinery for social audits at the ration shop level and no vigilance committee has been set up for monitoring implementation of NFSA. The ministry said the Delhi government is also not maintaining data on NFSA beneficiaries under the SC and ST categories.",Comply with NFSA by June 30: Centre to Delhi govt,RICE

Since May, when Covid-19 cases had surged, the 39-year-old techie, along with others, has been feeding 200 to 250 animals daily.Kamala, a system administrator at IBM India, carries out initiatives through Service For Humans, an organisation he founded, and company task force groups. He is joined by colleague Sunil Yadav and Service for Humans volunteers Shyam Sundar and Kiran Kumar. Together, they cook 15kg of rice and chicken every day and drive around the city to feed strays. They have covered almost every locality in Bengaluru.The efforts, which cost nearly Rs 1,000 daily, are supported by donations from IBM employees and Kamalas group.During the lockdown, they also fed fruits to monkeys in Chikkaballapur. Monkeys are generally given food by tourists or devotees near temples. When everything was shut, I wanted to make sure they didnt go hungry, he said. The volunteers started this drive with 150kg of bananas and smaller quantities of mangoes, guavas, watermelons and apples. But I noticed that monkeys were more interested in mangoes, so we began taking 150kg of mangoes along with other fruits, he said. Each visit cost Rs 4,000.Kamalas efforts landed him the title of Covid Hero at his workplace. He has worked with a company task force to help people in need of medicines, beds and other assistance. He distributed more than 700 grocery kits to the poor. With the help of government officials and NGOs, he arranged a vaccination drive for frontline workers.Kamala has also supplied more than 400 grocery kits to orphanages and marginalised communities and over 1,000 home-cooked meals. He fed strays even during the first wave of Covid.He contracted the infection in April this year, but that only motivated him to do more. After recovering, he resumed social service.

In the 1980s, Hema's husbands business brought the family to Delhi. She packed a trove of Chettinad recipes and moved North with her husband and three young children.Her daughter, Anjali, recalls that growing up, her friends couldn't get enough of Hema's South Indian fare. ""The idlis and sambar served at home weren't the cookie-cutter stuff available at Delhi restaurants then. The flavours were intense. Eating our food was guaranteed to transport you all the way South,"" says Anjali.In 2016, she and her mother launched Hema's South Indian at Greater Kailash II in Delhi. Hema is the culinary creative brain, while Anjali is the taster and marketing maven, who also designs recipes and menus, and cooks with her mother.They conducted workshops in their kitchen, teaching clients the basics of Chettinad cooking. Enamoured by the exotic and unfamiliar tastes, Delhis ladies who lunched spread the word. Hema started retailing authentic batter, unlike the packaged variety on sale on supermarket shelves.Soon, the Gupta ladies expanded their scale of operations by selling the food they cooked, setting up stalls at popular weekly markets and fairs, and catering for small parties.Now Hemas South Indian is a byword for Chettinad food in Delhi. In 2020, the lockdown forced Hemas epicurean enterprise to shut shop, but the regulars didnt give up. Says Anjali, ""The pandemic was a game-changer. We sold everything from batter to customised food. Before we knew it, we were preparing weekly menus and doing zonal deliveries on specified days across Delhi-NCR.""A client even sends his driver once a week, all the way from Hisar in Haryana to the Gurgaon border, where a delivery guy waits for him with his orders. The Indian gastronomic trend of the noughties was modernising traditional recipes, which has not stopped avant-garde chefs from experimenting until now.Anjali's contributions were the Gunpowder Prawns, Chettinad Mutton Chops and Filter Coffee Pana Cotta prepared with the freshest ingredients. She added non-vegetarian and spicy variants of Hema's traditional dishes to the menu, since she had her finger on Delhi's belly.Despite being head-chef, Hema has never tasted meat. Yet, she intuitively knows what meat is best suited to which curry or powder mix. ""After the curry base is ready, I taste it and advise Anjali on what kind of meat will go best with it,"" shares Hema.Though their extensive menu changes on a weekly basis, the popular dishes remain the same - Mutton Pepper Masala, Crab Sukka, and Malabari Fish Curry are the non-vegetarian options. The high-selling vegetarian dishes include Tangy Pineapple Curry, Jackfruit Chettinad Gravy, soft fluffy idlis with home-made podi, appams, neer dosa, idiyappams, and Malabar parottas. For dessert it is Filter Coffee Panna Cotta or Black Rice Pudding.After the second wave of COVID-19, the team at Hema's South Indian noticed a demand for healthier food options. People were choosing nourishment over fulfilment. The menu was modified by adding new dishes that took the change into consideration.Most appreciated are the prawns cooked in coconut broth without chillies, and appams made with ragi millet. This recent surge in popularity has led mother and daughter to open their first professional kitchen in Shahpur Jat.

My family, including husband and three children, has been surviving mainly on the food kit and free rice being provided by the government to tribespeople, she adds.As the monsoon begins, labourers like Ms. Ammini usually find work on ginger, plantain and vegetable farms as well as coffee and tea plantations in the district. But the crisis that has affected the farming sector due to the COVID-related lockdown has rendered a majority of the workers jobless.Only a few men from our hamlet got some work in a ginger farm nearly 10 km away from our hamlet, but most of us remain jobless, says Ms. Ammini.Though her husband Gopi got two days of work under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme last week, the work temporarily stopped due to heavy rain, she adds.While tribespeople are being provided provisions like free rice and wheat from ration shops, the condition of workers in the general category and marginal farmers is quite pathetic since they have to survive solely with the free kit of the State government, says Rajan, a marginal farmer at Pinangode.The government has eased lockdown restrictions, but that alone will not make things better for the farming community, he adds.The closure of many shops during the lockdown and a sharp decline in the price of produce such as coffee, ginger, pepper, plantain, cardamom and tea leaves during the period have put the farming sector in a fix, says Mr. Rajan.

The decision comes after he realised that the term kaffir, has been used historically as a racial slur in South Africa.Before kaffir lime leaves, there were several other instances of brands dropping various racial terms from their packaging, so as to not further offend people. Last year, in the wake of the Black Lives Matter movement, Quaker Oats had announced it was dropping the 130-year-old brand name and image, which featured a Black woman named Aunt Jemima. Quaker, a subsidiary of PepsiCo, stated Aunt Jemimas origins are based on a racial stereotype.The image of the lady, originally dressed as a minstrel character, changed over the past few years and Quaker eventually removed the mammy kerchief, which allegedly perpetuated a racist stereotype dating back to the days of slavery.Since the tragic death of US citizen George Floyd last year, many brands around the world have had to rethink their marketing strategies and tailor them as per the growing social changes, which push for more inclusivity and less racism and colourism.Indianexpress.com had previously reported that in June 2020, besides Aunt Jemima, other brands like Uncle Ben, Eskimo Pie, and Cream of Wheat also said they would rebrand, after having been criticised for long for having racist undertones.Uncle Bens rice used to have an African American rice farmer from Texas as its logo. Mars, the brands owner, had said last year it had a responsibility to take a stand in helping to put an end to racial bias and injustices, adding that one way we can do this is by evolving Uncle Bens brand, including its visual brand identity.Uncle Bens rice and Mrs Butterworth are among the brands which have had a reckoning with racially charged logos.

The company had said it was starting a complete brand and packaging review while acknowledging that the bottle  meant to portray a loving grandmother  could be interpreted in a way that is wholly inconsistent with our values.Additionally, ice-cream brand Eskimo Pie was also forced to rethink its name and branding, for its packaging featured an Eskimo character  a racially derogatory term that refers to Inuit and Yupik people in Alaska.For more lifestyle news, follow us: Twitter: lifestyle_ie | Facebook: IE Lifestyle | Instagram: ie_lifestyle","Before ‘kaffir’, here are instances of some other brands tackling racism",RICE

Today, she is the owner of a small grocery shop near home in Upperkonki village of Ranchi district, earning enough to save some money on the side.The 45-year-old says her search for a respectable life is finally over.Devi is one of the 15,456 women identified by the Jharkhand government for its Phoolo-Jhano Ashirwad Abhiyan, which was launched last September to rehabilitate women selling unregulated liquor and counsel them to adopt an alternative business source, with the provision of interest-free loans up to Rs 10,000.These women were picked after a statewide survey by Jharkhand State Livelihood Promotion Society (JSLPS), which functions under the Rural Development Department. Officials say the JSLPS has so far helped 13,456 women with loans through self-help groups and counselling to adopt alternative micro-enterprises  from agro-based activities to animal husbandry, sale of forest produce, sericulture and poultry.Counselling is the key, informing women about the ill-effects of being involved in the sale of liquor, JSLPS CEO Nancy Sahay said.Officials say the women were initially resistant to change. In many places, they could not believe that the transition would be easy and that they would not be in debt. It took us a great deal of follow-ups to convince them, an official, who is involved with the initiative, said.One important step was to get those who had signed up to motivate others to follow. These motivators are called Navjiwan Sakhis. There are 138 such women in the programme already, who get a minimum of Rs 100 per day for their services, the official said.One of them is Sabita Kumari from Kori village in Chatra district. I joined as a Navjeevan Sakhi last October. I used to sell liquor earlier but now have started a business of rearing goats and pigs for meat. There were 21 women selling homemade liquor in the village. We convinced them to start other businesses with the Rs 10,000 loan. Many started eateries and grocery shops. Only three women still sell liquor, she said. Kumari, however, says she is yet to receive any money from the government for her efforts as a Navjeevan Sakhi.In Upperkonki village, meanwhile, Sushila Devi is so relieved. My husband tills a small piece of land that we inherited, but that was never sufficient. For the past few months, there has been a small, but stable, income coming from the shop. There is a turnover of more than Rs 3,000 per month and it has started giving some profit. At least, I dont have to sit in the market listening to all the nonsense after men get drunk.Devi said that she got the loan of Rs 10,000 to start her shop from a local self-help group. I will return it in time, she said.About 110 km away, 26-year-old Kalawati Kumari has started a pakora shop in Satanpur panchayat of Bokaro, after selling homemade liquor for over three years. Earlier, I used to sell liquor for around Rs 2,000 per month. It was a very difficult process mixing Mahua flowers, jaggery. Sometimes, it used to get sour, and the entire stock would go to waste. Then, there was the issue of dealing with men getting drunk. It was just trouble all the time, she said.According to Kumari, the pakora business earns her about Rs 6,000 per month. Initially, I was not convinced and it took me some time to get in. But now, I have realised that this is much better work.","Tips to start new business, loans: In Jharkhand, women selling liquor to feed family have way out",RICE
2021-06-23,https://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/chennai/2021/jun/23/the-boons-of-barnyard-2320006.html,"Sahana Iyer ByExpress News ServiceCHENNAI: The thought of replacing rice in a South Indian household is close to blasphemy. However, with a health-conscious wave looming, millets are finding their permanent residence in kitchens across Tamil Nadu. While some triumphed early on after trials, testing and tasting, others like the barnyard millet or kuthiraivali, scientifically Echinochloa Frumentacea, are now inching their way into peoples diets. .Nutritionally superior to all other millets and cereals, barnyard millet is the wealthiest reserve of fibre and minerals in the food group. Barnyard is the healthiest option of the millets. Low in calories and high in fibre, protein and minerals, replacing merely one meal of other cereals with it can be extremely beneficial. It is also a good choice for those beginning a millet-inclusive diet, says Dr PV Lakshmi, chief dietician at Gleneagles Global Health City.Popularly grown in the Himalayas, barnyard is an important crop to hills and tribal agriculture. It is also grown on a smaller scale in Tamil Nadu, Uttarakhand, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Maharashtra, and Madhya Pradesh. Globally, India is the largest producer of this millet. A fast-growing crop that isresistant to adverse weather conditions, barnyard is a great choice for sustenance farmers and as an alternate crop to replace failed monsoon harvests. The green stems and leaves grow up to 50-95 cm in height and are ready to harvest in merely 45 days.Once harvested, they are threshed by trampling, by bullocks, to produce the nutritional grains we receive. You can make kuthiraivali upma, pongal, dosa, kesari or even try some snacks like murukku and tikki, mentions Dr Lakshmi. Labelled the superior millet, one has to assume it has health benefits aplenty. Dr Lakshmi shares some prominent pros of consuming barnyard millet.Rich reserve of ironJust one meal of barnyard millet can satiate 50 per cent of your daily iron requirements. The low reserve of calcium prevents interference in the absorption of iron and thus, it is the ideal choice in the food group for iron requirements. Hot tip: garnish your food containing the millet with some lemon juice to give even better absorption.Perfect fit for anaemic needsAnaemia refers to a condition indicating a low count of red blood cells or haemoglobin in a patient. With its high dose of iron, barnyard millet is a preventer. It is often prescribed liberally to anaemic patients.An abundant supply of fibreThe ample fibre content in barnyard millet works to the benefit of the human body in several ways  it can prevent a few types of cancer, particularly colon; it relieves constipation; provides satiety or fullness of the stomach, aiding in weight reduction. Furthermore, the presence of amylase, a starch-digesting enzyme, improves digestion.Gluten-free nourishmentLike other millets, barnyard is also free of gluten and can be easily adopted by those who are gluten-intolerant or following gluten-restricted diets.Cuts down cholesterolThose who are looking to reduce their cholesterol can greatly benefit from adding a portion of barnyard to their diet. The low-fat content in the millet absorbs and reduces cholesterol and fat absorption.Prevents cardiovascular diseasesWhile the millet has low-fat content, the presence of fatty acids such as linoleic acid, palmitic acid, and oleic acids are good for the prevention of cardiovascular diseases.For a diabetic-friendly dietThe fatty acids in barnyard millet, coupled with a moderate glycemic index, also cater to the needs of those with diabetes.NUTRITIONAL BREAKDOWN(per 100 g)Energy: 307 kcalProtein: 8.2 g, Fat: 2.2 gCarbohydrates: 65.6 gFibre: 12.5 g, Minerals: 4.4 gCalcium: 23.2 mg, Phosphorus: 280 mgIron: 10-15 mg, Vitamin B1: 0.4 mgVitamin B2: 0.1 mgNiacin (Vitamin B3): 4.2 mgSource: Dr PV Lakshmi,Gleneagles Global Health CityBarnyard millet pudina rice(by cookbook author Krishnakumari Jayakumaar)INGREDIENTSBarnyard millet: 1 cupPudina (Mint):  bunchGreen chillies: 3-4 piecesRed chillies: 2 piecesLemon: 1 pieceMustard seeds: 1 tspUrad Dal: 1 tspChana Dal: 1 tspCurry leaves: 1-2Water: 3  cupsGinger, PeanutsSalt to tastePREPARATIONSoak the millets in one cup of water for five hours at least.Grind together pudina leaves, green chillies, a small piece of ginger, juice of half a lemon and salt to create a chutney.METHODCook the soaked millet in 2  cups of water.To a pan of hot oil, add and saute mustard seeds, urad dal, chana dal, a few peanuts, curry leaves, and red chillies.Pour in your pudina chutney to the same pan and reduce the chutney quantity till the water has evaporated.Once it is reduced, add the cooked millet and salt and mix gently on a slow flame.Take the pan off the heat after 3-4 minutes of cooking.Serve hot and enjoy!",The boons of barnyard,RICE

Also, it was found that substantial number of allotted tokens got lapsed,"" the report said. The period of procurement in Odisha was valid from November 1, 2020 to March 31, 2021.Similarly, the quality control process was almost non-existent and the inspector, appointed on contract, generally filled up the parameters as per whim and fancy without actual analysis. The entire procurement process was found to be miller-driven.Surprisingly, the State government has allowed millers to perform all mandi operations such as supply of used gunnies, transportation of paddy, loading and other labour works. This is against the guidelines of the Centre, the team observed. Distribution of paddy amongst millers was not found transparent as it was at the discretion of PACS secretary.Central team flags paddy purchase lapses, suggests detailed auditThis apart, electronic weighbridge of RMCs are not linked to the P-PAS and the system has no provision of storage of data, and date-wise and truck-wise issue of weighment slips. Lack of such facility raises suspicion on authenticity of weighment slip, the report stated.In the absence of such facility, suspicion has arisen whether the stocks have actually arrived in the mandi and dispatched, thereby somewhat substantiating the general complaint that the farmers are forced to deliver their produce at the millers point and backward records being prepared manually, the report said.""A complete audit of procurement process starting from registration of farmers to payment of MSP, physical verification of paddy allotted for milling and delivery of rice by millers in at least two revenue districts of the State may be got done,"" the team suggested.","Central team flags paddy purchase lapses in Odisha, suggests detailed audit",RICE

Sekar Babu has said in an interview. Edited excerpts:You announced that priests would be appointed to temples administered by the HR&CE Department. How would you facilitate this? Do you expect a good response from aspirants?Aspiring candidates will be trained and appointed as priests in temples in accordance with the rules. The government will definitely assist women who are interested in taking up the job of a temple priest. I am surprised at the questions being raised on the move to appoint women as priests. When women could be engaged in many other works in temples, why cant they be engaged as priests? When we are open to appointing people from any community as priests in temples, why prohibit women? We have also received representations from women seeking an opportunity to serve as priests. Engaging women as priests is not merely a religious activity, but is part of a larger social transformation initiative to ensure equal participation  a principle the DMK government is committed to.Also Read Training as per Agamas, a pre-requisite for appointing women as priests: MinisterAs regards taking up the job of a temple priest as a career, I am sure it is not just the money that matters to people. Doing the divine duty of serving God gives huge satisfaction. Having said that, I would also add that the remuneration of priests in smaller temples that dont generate much income is under consideration for revision.What plans do you have to promote temples? Many temple lands have been encroached upon and properties have been let out for lower rentals...Transparency will be the foremost pillar of temple administration. We have already published the title documents for more than 3.50 lakh acres of temple lands on our website. The process of retrieving the balance temple lands is under way. A massive drive has been launched to identify properties in urban areas, evict the encroachers and fence the premises.A detailed review has been undertaken to arrive at the demand collection and balance of each property, and the same will soon be published on the official website. The defaulters list will also be published soon. Necessary provisions have been created in the online software to upload the approved budget statements of each temple so that anyone could examine it. Special teams have been formed to revise the rent of shops on temple lands, collect dues and expedite the disposal of related cases pending in the courts.Also Read Temple land in TN will be protected: MinisterDo you have any plans to deploy IT applications to bring about efficiency in temple administration and asset management?We are going to conduct a drone and Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS) survey to digitise every inch of temple property and publish the same on the official website with 3D images. We have commenced the digitisation of permanent registers, files and connected records and, wherever possible, those records would be published online.

Do you have any plans to develop them and put them on the tourism map of Tamil Nadu?The HR&CE Department administers over 38,000 temples, of which more than 34,000 have an annual income of less than 10,000. And, 12,959 temples are covered under the Oru Kaala Poojai scheme, as part of which they get a quarterly receipt from fixed deposits. It is true that many temples dont have sufficient financial resources to undertake renovation work. The Chief Minister has promised to spend 1,000 crore to undertake Thiruppanigal (renovation work) in temples. We are in the process of preparing the estimates for it. I assure you that all temples that need resources to undertake renovation work will be given the required assistance.Besides, temple tanks will be renovated and temple cars repaired and rebuilt.

There are various types of employees in temples, like time scale, contract, daily wage, consolidated pay, service employees, etc. There is not much uniformity in the deployment of personnel in temples. The Chief Minister will be apprised of this challenge, and a feasible solution will be arrived at soon.How has the COVID-19 pandemic affected temple revenues in 2020-2021 when compared to the previous fiscal?The pandemic has affected temple revenues. To mitigate the woes of priests and other temple employees who dont have a fixed monthly income, they are being provided a one-time financial assistance of 4,000, 10 kg of rice and 15 types of groceries. Sufficient steps have been taken to vaccinate priests and other employees.

It is suggested to first start on a pilot basis.""Highlighting several challenges in the scheme, the ministry said there is no clarity on the contracting tenure of the delivery partner as it will have a direct impact on the cost and continuity of food security of beneficiaries.Pointing out the lack of clarity on rates at which ration will be home delivered to beneficiaries, the ministry said ""It is highlighted that, as per NFSA rules, wheat flour can only be distributed and at a higher issue price after taking proper consent from the NFSA beneficiaries"".It is not clear whether the consent of NFSA beneficiaries has been obtained by the state government on this aspect or not, it added.It is also not clear that the packaged wheat flour and rice that involves milling, processing and additional transportation and delivery cost -- will be home delivered to beneficiaries at the existing subsidised rates or at higher rates.There is no clarity whether the beneficiaries will be allowed to opt-out from the home delivery scheme anytime during the year if they no longer wish to stay dependent on the scheme and forced to incur the higher monthly cost and may want to shift to regular NFSA grains, it added.Further, the ministry said there is no clarity on how the state government will maintain the addresses of beneficiaries in the system to ensure uninterrupted home delivery of packaged items every month, even in case of a change of address of the beneficiaries.There is also no clarity on how the Delhi government will integrate the home delivery scheme with the Centre's ration card portability feature and supply rations to migrants most of them as tenants keep changing their temporary accommodation.It is not clear how the state government plans to ensure supply of monthly ration to numerous street dwellers, rag-pickers, migratory labourers, construction workers, rickshaw pullers, auto drivers -- who do not have a permanent address in Delhi, it said.Against this backdrop, the ministry asked again the Delhi government to take necessary steps to fulfil the pending obligation of the NFSA under which it is required to deliver foodgrains via electronic Point of Sale (ePoS) machines to the poor beneficiaries.The Delhi government planned to launch the scheme for the doorstep delivery of ration in June, but it did not get approval from the lieutenant governor.PTI LUX BAL 06232018 NNNN",Centre says Delhi's ration scheme lacks clarity; suggests implementation on pilot basis,RICE

The state agriculture department plans to bring around 1 million hectares under DSR this year  a huge target to achieve, and double the area that came under DSR last year.Though the chief agricultural officers of various districts of the state say that due to availability of migrant labourers for paddy transplanting this year, DSR is being used a little less as compared to last year. However, until June 14, 2.23 lakh hectares (around 5.51 lakh acres) area has already been covered under DSR in the state this year. Last year too, by this time, almost the same area had been brought under DSR, which had finally covered over 5 lakh hectares.Paddy (non-Basmati) sowing will continue till July first week as several short varieties with high yield potential are available to farmers now. Following this, Basmati sowing will start, which will continue till July-end. Several farmers adopt DSR technique for Basmati sowing too.Area covered under DSR is being recorded by the Punjab agriculture department through satellite, with the help of Punjab Remote Sensing Centre (PRSC), Ludhiana.The state also achieved the highest productivity of paddy last year in its history with 6631 kg per hectare. After getting huge area under DSR last year, if the states paddy productivity increased, that means that DSR, if adopted properly under the guidance of agriculture experts, it will not only provide at par or even more yield to farmers against the traditional method of paddy transplanting, but also save a huge amount of groundwater, said an agricultural expert.Last year, 31.49 lakh hectares were under rice cultivation, which included 4.06 lakh hectares Basmati and 27.43 lakh hectares under paddy (non-Basmati), out of which over 5 lakh (16 per cent) hectares was under DSR.Last year too, DSR area as recorded by PRSC was over 5 lakh hectares, not only an all-time high in the state but also much higher than the decades total area under DSR. From 2010 to 2019, only around 3,87,000 hectares (95,580 acres) area could be brought under DSR.Punjab Agriculture University (PAU) experts said that around 6,000 machines were available in Punjab and a couple of 100 each of Happy Seeder machines, which are mainly used to sow wheat, and PAU developed Lucky seeder machines, which are mainly used to sow wheat, are also used after modification.DSR is recommended in medium to heavy textured soil like sandy loam, clay loam, silt loam, and loam, and Punjab has 87 per cent soil of these types.Punjab Agriculture University (PAU), Ludhiana, had recommended the DSR technique in the state, with effect from June 1 in tar wattar conditions  that is in fields that have high moisture content without any additional expenditure, which results in saving groundwater and therefore reduced power consumption.Dr Balwinder Singh Sidhu, agriculture commissioner of Punjab, had said recently that this time, over 1,000 camps have been organised in a cluster of five villages each across the paddy transplanting districts of the state to train and educate farmers in the DSR technique.DSR was recommended in the state in 2010 but only a handful of progressive farmers had adopted this technique for the first four years. Then some more farmers came forward and showed interest, but again they lost interest in it because of lack of proper knowhow and problem of weeds. But now, a large number of camps are being organised at the village level to make farmers aware of how, when and in which soil it should be adopted and availability of effective weedicides in the market.In normal transplanting, farmers prepare nurseries which are then uprooted and replanted 25-35 days later in the main puddled field by 3-4 labourers. In the first 3-4 weeks after transplanting, the plants have to be irrigated almost daily (if there are no rains) to ensure water depth of 4-5 cm. Even for the next 4-5 weeks, when the crop is in the tillering (stem development) stage, farmers continue to irrigate every 2-3 days. Water prevents the growth of weeds by denying them oxygen in the submerged stage. Water, in other words, acts as an herbicide for paddy.In DSR, paddy seeds are directly drilled into the field by a tractor-powered DSR machine. Here water is replaced by real chemical herbicides and it does not need flood irrigation, and the first irrigation is done 21 days after sowing.","Punjab seeks to bring 10 lakh hectares under direct seeding, one quarter of target achieved",RICE

A regular, amateur student at Ocean Delight Surf School, she slowly became well-acquainted with the owners. Unfortunately, the practice came to a halt when the recent lockdown was exercised.It was only months later, after the conception of COVIDuthalai and several relief projects, that she learned the need for her services in the village. I noticed that three-four of my acquaintances from Kovalam would check COVIDuthalais Instagram stories. I reached out to them regarding continuing surfing. They asked me to bring my friends when the situation eases since they have been struggling during lockdown; the entire village has been. I realised I could do more to help with COVIDuthalai.After discussing with my team, we decided to distribute rice bags to affected families, explains Sai Sudha. Home to a little over 8,000 denizens (Census 2011-2021), Kovalam fishing village is one of the top surfing spots in India. Lack of education and under-representation has kept the fishing community in the shadows. Sai Sudha, herself, did not know about the village until last year. Despite being home to several medal-winning surfers, there is hardly any coverage of the place. People cannot empathise or help those they do not know exist, she adds.While the younger generations have tried to branch off into other lines of work, fishing remains the communitys primary occupation. Beaches and fishing practices being restricted during lockdown has cost the village their daily income. The fishermen catch fish and the women of the house sell it in markets. Thats a daily affair. They do not have deep freezers or cold storages to withstand the duration of the restrictions. Furthermore, customers at markets had become scarce.Their entire work cycle is at a standstill, she says. COVIDuthalai will be providing 2,000 kg of rice in bags weighing 7-10 kg to cater to 250-300 families of the community this Saturday. They will be distributed from the two ends of the village to avoid overlapping resources. There is panic in the village. Of 2,800-3,000 families, at least 30-40 per cent still belong to traditional fishing livelihood.They have been deeply impacted. I am working with twothree people to make sure it is distributed to any daily wage workers who are struggling to make ends meet , she elaborates.

It said since making flour involves milling, processing, packing and additional transportation there will be additional financial implications for the poor.Though under NFSA flour at higher price can be distributed, but that has to be notified and consent of beneficiaries is mandatory. The ministry said its not clear whether the government has taken consent from beneficiaries.It has also flagged how under the proposed scheme, at the beginning of the financial year, the beneficiaries will need to give the option for door step delivery or to get ration from ration shops. The ministry said its not clear whether they will be allowed to opt out in between.It has also claimed that there is no mechanism for maintaining or updating the address of the beneficiaries considering that the poor and tenants often keep shifting their addresses. The ministry has said unrestricted reach of foodgrain vehicles and delivery to beneficiaries living in multi-storey buildings is another concern. Moreover, coordination with daily wagers and labourers for timely delivery is another area of concern.The Union ministry has flagged how there is no information on how leakages, diversions and availability of the right quantity and quality of foodgrains will be ensured.",Food ministry nixes Delhi govt's doorstep ration plan,RICE

After making headlines for misappropriation of PDS commodities through ghost ration cards last year, the authorities of the Food Supplies and Consumer Welfare department in the district are now under scanner for alleged theft of rice during transportation and distribution.The allegations have come from Birmitrapur MLA Shankar Oram who said two trucks laden with PDS rice and wheat from Rourkela godown left for Jahiritoli and Purunapani panchayats of Nuagaon block on June 19. Suspecting pilferage of the commodities, Jahiritoli villagers stopped a truck that was carrying 238 bags of rice and 53 bags of wheat. The vehicle along with the foodgrains was handed over to Birmitrapur police. The other truck with 320 bags of rice did not reach Purunapani and is yet to be traced. The MLA claimed that the registration numbers of the trucks were found to be that of two-wheelers.If sources involved in PDS rice distribution are to be believed, massive irregularities are taking place across the district. Some Jogan Sahayaks recently complained that 50 kg bags of rice actually contain 48 kg due to which they have to face problems at distribution points. More than 2,900 quintal of rice is siphoned off per month due to under-weighing. Besides, in blatant violation of norms, custom rice from authorised mills gets diverted to distribution points instead of the rice receiving centres (RRCs) for quality and quantity check, they claimed.Interestingly, rice bags under the brand name of Shree Om from an anonymous manufacturer are now flooding some markets of the district. Priced at Rs 20 per kg, the rice matches that of the PDS grains. Sources in the Food Supplies department said around 73,000 quintals of rice is supplied to the district per month.

Then came the Covid-19 lockdown and the closing of educational institutes and Veni Aunty, as she is fondly called, was not only no longer able to cook at the canteen, but didnt have any other sources of income. To her gratitude, the army of students she fed werent willing to see her suffer. LSR students, current and past, have created an Instagram page for Veni Aunty home-delivery service.Das moved to Delhi from Mumbai many years ago and settled in south Delhis East of Kailash with her son. I started my life in the capital by stitching clothes at a small factory. But I got tired of it, so much so that I just didnt want to continue with that job, said the woman. I then began working as a masseuse, which was when I met Meenakshi Gopinath , who was then the principal of LSR. We bonded well because we were both south Indians in a north Indian city.It was during one of her meetings with Gopinath that Das was sounded out about starting a small south Indian food section in the college canteen. I was very happy with the idea, smiled the affable woman. I prepared a menu, and the college administration tasted my menu and visited my home to see whether I cooked in hygienic conditions. I was able to win their approval and have been serving idli sambhar, vada sambhar and lemon and tomato rice to the students.But the lockdown took a cruel toll on her finances. After so many years of regular income, I was suddenly left without a paisa in earnings. While in college, the LSR girls were always in touch with me and many would ask me if I needed help, assuring me that I neednt worry about anything, she said. But when the college closed down due to the lockdown, I didnt know who to contact for help.Recently a few students approached Das for an interview for their project. While talking to them, the topic of her lockdown problems cropped up. I told them about how I hadnt been able to earn anything and was relying on my son for money, said Das. You see, Ive always wanted to avoid asking my son for financial help. That is when the LSR girls suggested that I should start a food delivery service.The good-hearted girls helped her open an Instagram account under the tag of Veni Aunty. The account has her phone number and a small menu. It has been four days since she went online. Many students have been ordering food from me, beamed Das. Also, past students called me and said they wanted my food because they missed it from their time in college.One of the students assisting Das said when they learnt of her predicament, they decided to start a crowdfunding relief campaign for her. But others thought something that got her a regular income would be better than temporary monetary assistance.

The Centre can well suggest ways to improve the scheme. But a prolonged tussle on a scheme like this certainly doesn't help Delhi's citizenry.Read Also Doorstep delivery of ration in Delhi: Food ministry cites operational difficulties, transparency issues The food ministry has turned down the Delhi governments proposal for doorstep delivery of ration allocated under the National Food Security Act (NFSA) flagging shortcomings and concerns over likely operational difficulties, transparency and ensuring uninterrupted supply to poor who either shiftNEW DELHI: The row over the Delhi governments plan for doorstep delivery of ration escalated on Wednesday with the Aam Aadmi Party government saying the Centre has rejected Delhis ambitious scheme by posing senseless questions like how the ration will be delivered to beneficiaries living in multi-storey buildings in narrow bylanes. Delhi received a letter from the ministry of consumer affairs, food and public distribution on June 22 stating that the ration scheme cant be approved because it does not meet the statutory and functional requirements of National Food Security Act.Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal called the Centres letter painful, asserting that the scheme was in national interest. Targeting the central government on Twitter without naming it, Kejriwal said: Fighting everyone all the time is not good  Twitter, Mamata Banerjee Maharashtra , Jharkhand, Delhi government, farmers, traders and even the West Bengal chief secretary. Kejriwal asked how the country will progress amid so much fight and asked the Centre not to fight over Delhis ration scheme.Addressing a digital press conference, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia slammed the Centre over the objections raised by it. He said it had earlier suggested dropping the term, Mukhyamantri Ghar Ghar Ration Yojna, from the scheme which the Delhi government had accepted, but now it has rejected the scheme entirely. The central government has cited reasons like pricing, verification of addresses, mobility, narrow lanes, multi-storey buildings where the poor live and accommodating change of addresses in the rejection letter, said Sisodia.One of the issues raised in the letter is how will delivery of ration be ensured if the vehicle carrying the ration breaks down or gets stuck in traffic. These kinds of excuses are very unbecoming of a Prime Minister in the 21st century. If pizza, clothes and food can be delivered all around, why not ration for the poor? Sisodia asked, directly questioning Prime Minister Narendra Modi Taking a swipe at the Centre over the objection that free movement of ration delivery may not be successful in multi-storey buildings, Kejriwal indirectly hit out at Modi. 21st century India has reached the moon and you are stuck on the third floor, said the CM in a tweet.Conceived in early 2018, the doorstep delivery of ration scheme, a brainchild of Kejriwal, has got stuck because of a prolonged Centre-AAP government tussle on the issue. Recently, lieutenant governor Anil Baijal had raised objections. He had observed that the scheme required the Centres approval, pointed out that a writ petition on the issue has been filed in the high court and returned the file to the state government for reconsideration. The LGs observations put the scheme, ready for an immediate rollout, on hold. It triggered another major confrontation between the Centre and the AAP government.In a recent note, the CM rejected the observations of the LG, asserting that the scheme has already attained finality. It will, however, not be rolled out by the food department without the Centres nod.The PM has left aside all his work and resorted to just fighting with the state governments and obstructing their work. Why has PM Modi adopted such a quarrelsome stance? In 75 years, it is perhaps the first time that we have a PM who fights all the time. It seems like the PM wakes up every morning and makes a list of individuals to fight with, Sisodia stated, urging the PM to open his heart and let the Delhi government deliver ration at the doorstep of consumers.The ministry of consumer affairs, food and public distribution has raised multiple objections, pointing out that the proposed scheme involves distribution of packed food commodities instead of wheat and rice which are distributed under the NSF Act. It has also underlined that the scheme does not have clarity on how Delhi government will maintain/update the addresses of beneficiaries to ensure uninterrupted home delivery every month even in case of change of address because most poor beneficiaries keep on changing their accommodations.The ministrys letter also said it was not clear how the Delhi government will ensure coordination with beneficiaries for timely delivery at a fixed date/time because that may get hampered due to traffic congestion and breakdown of delivery vehicles. It added that there was no clarity on whether there will be one or multiple contractors.Observing that there were concerns regarding implementation of the One Nation One Ration Card plan (ONORC) for food security of migrant beneficiaries, the ministry has also asked how Delhi plans to integrate the home delivery scheme with ONORC to provide ration card portability to the beneficiaries.","Delhi ration scheme rejected, AAP govt scoffs at reasons",RICE

The civic body is planning to develop urban forests on vacant land space using Miyawaki technology.EDMC has identified a 2,200 sq metre land parcel at Gharoli village near Mayur Vihar Phase III, where 7,000 saplings were planted on Wednesday.The Miyawaki method, also called the potted seedling method, is an afforestation technique that uses native plant species along with components such as perforators, water retainers, organic manure and mulch. The method guarantees high survival and 20 times higher growth rate of trees.We have chosen 26 native species in the right mix to create a four-layered system of shrubs, sub-tree level, tree layer and canopy layer. After treating the soil, plants are packed closely so that vertical growth takes place rather than horizontal growth, eventually creating a mini self-sustaining ecosystem. There are three-four plants per square metre, said EDMC horticulture director Raghwendra Singh.Singh said that for its part, the NGO has dug the land around three feet in depth and placed nutritional elements such as coco peat, rice barn, compost, cow dung, nutritional soil before covering the ditch with soil. Regarding water supply, we have made arrangements from neighbouring parks and if required, the staff will supply water through tankers, he said.Some of the species of trees planted are lemon, pilkhan, mango, shisham, peepul, Ashok, neem, pomegranate, Indian gooseberry, jackfruit, etc.A similar project at Ghazipur landfill last year has seen success after ,000 saplings of 40 native Indian species were planted using the Miyawaki method over a 450 square metres by the corporations engineering department.The horticulture department is now planning to develop more urban forests on the other side of the Ghazipur landfill using the same technology and the exercise will start next week. Considering the monsoon will arrive anytime soon, this would be the appropriate time to carry out such drives, said an EDMC official.The same methodology was used earlier near Barapullah drain at Sarai Kale Khan to reclaim a swampy sewage area and turn it into a carbon sink.",Miyawaki tech to help develop urban forests in E Delhi,RICE

Traditionally held on Moolam Day in the Malayalam month of Midhunam, it falls on June 24 this year. However, the pandemic has put paid to the traditional colour and festivity.The 400-year-old event is held to acknowledge the help of a Christian family in the consecration of the Krishna idol at the Ambalappuzha temple.

This also signals preparations for the seasons other races of which the most famous is the Nehru Boat Race (on the second Sunday of August) and the latest, IPL-styled Champions Boat League, launched three years ago.This year, only customary rituals associated with the Moolam Boat Race at Champakkulam will be followed due to the ongoing pandemic, says K Naveen Babu, Tahsildar of Kuttanad.Enduring historyVJ Sreekumar, koymasthani (a designation that translates to officer at the temple) and member of the Valliyamadom family, keepers of the Sree Krishna idol of the Ambalappuzha temple and one of the five officials who made the ritualistic journey today said,This event took place in 1545 AD. Earlier it was an utsav (festival), not a boat race. It became a competition only in the last 100-odd years.He was accompanied by the rajah prathinidhi (representative of the royal family), Narayana Bhattathiri, two officials and the administrative officer of the Travancore Dewasom Board, along with a couple of temple staff and officials of the Government.

Our family members always arrive for the event and together with the temple officials we would be around 20 persons. A simple reception will be held and the karnavar or head of the Mappilassery family will receive a tamboolam or betel leaves and nuts, as a symbol of gratitude.Sebastian recalls family members travelling by boat to the temple to receive an award in the evening, but that ended at some point. He adds that the Moolam Boat Race (also known as the Champakkulam Boat Race) used to be the highlight and the grandest event before it was overshadowed by the Nehru Trophy Boat Race that began in 1952. There used to be hundreds of boats on the river. The race would start from our house, because there is a bend in the river.

The department analyses the market trends by collecting retail prices of 50 essential commodities from all districts. The daily reports during the lockdown period showed no major escalation for most of the commodities, especially rice varieties and pulses.A marginal increase was recorded in the first few weeks for certain vegetables like cucumber, beans and bitter gourd. It was attributed to the severe lockdown restrictions in Tamil Nadu. However, these prices too came down in the fifth week of the lockdown when restrictions were eased in that state. Over 20% rise in price was recorded in price of shallot and 27.66% for onion. Another commodity that showed an upward price trend was eggs. This is attributed to the price rise in the production hub of Namakkal in Tamil Nadu.Retail egg prices are based on the rates fixed by the National Egg Coordination Committee at the production hubs of Namakkal and Vijayawada. Sources in the Civil Supplies Department said rice and pulses did not witness a price rise due to massive food kit distribution by voluntary organisations. It also helped check sugar price. But the price may go up for vegetables in the coming weeks if fuel price continues to be up. Kerala will be badly affected by the hike in petroleum price, said an officer.Last year, a study by the Gulati Institute of Finance and Taxation had found that food prices in Kerala during the pandemic were lower than the rest of the country.

(Representational Image)THE FOOD Safety Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) has banned blending of mustard oil with any other oil. Blending of edible oils was first permitted by the Indian government in the 1990s. After the outbreak of dropsy (due to adulteration of mustard oil) in the late 1990s, the government pushed for blending mustard oil with other edible oils.Experts see the FSSAIs decision as a big opportunity for mustard growers in India and replacing traditional rapeseed-mustard oil varieties with Canola rapeseed-mustard to provide a healthy oil for human consumption and decrease Indias dependence on oil import.VIRENDER SARDANA, principal agronomist and in-charge, oilseeds section, department of plant breeding and genetics, Punjab Agriculture University (PAU), Ludhiana, speaks to ANJU AGNIHOTRI CHABA on what makes canola rapeseed-mustard oil the healthiest oil for human consumption.What are the benefits of vegetable oils?Daily intake of a certain minimum amount of fats is necessary for physical and mental well-being. The nutritional guidelines of Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO), World Health Organization (WHO) suggest consumption of 30g of visible (vegetable oil or animal fat) and invisible (obtained from cereals, millets, pulses, vegetables etc.) fat per person per day.One gram of vegetable oils provides 9 kcal (kilocalories) energy compared to 4 kcal energy obtained from one gram of cereals or legumes.These fats are also carriers of fat soluble vitamins such as A, D, E and K to various parts of the body. These vegetable oils are also primary sources of antioxidants (tocopherols) and phytosterol and suppliers of several minerals such as calcium, magnesium, potassium.Soybean, rapeseed-mustard, groundnut, sunflower, sesame/til, safflower and niger crops are the primary sources of edible oils. Oil extracted from rice bran, corn or maize, cottonseed and from several tree borne oilseed (TBO) crops such as coconut, palm and olive is also used for edible purposes, directly or after blending with traditional edible oils.What are the quality parameters of edible oils?Quality of any oil is determined by its fatty acid composition, which differs from oil to oil. There are three types of fatty acids in any oil including saturated fatty acids (SFAs), mono-unsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs).The PUFAs are also known as essential fatty acids. The proportion of SFAs in plant-derived oils is generally low, except in coconut oil and palm oil. Higher consumption of SFAs is known to increase low density lipoprotein (LDL), bad cholesterol, which is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular diseases.WHO recommends that the total consumption of saturated fats should be less than 10 per cent of total energy intake. The MUFA acts as a cholesterol scavenger and generates high density lipoprotein (HDL/good cholesterol). The PUFAs are known to reduce blood cholesterol, especially the harmful LDL and elevate HDL, which plays a role in transporting excess blood cholesterol back to the liver for degradation and excretion.Vegetable oils are the main source of PUFAs such as omega 6 and omega 3. However, an oil rich in PUFAs is unstable at very high temperature and gets converted into trans fats and therefore is not recommended for cooking or frying. The intake of trans-fats should not be more than 1 per cent of total energy intake. Generally speaking, however, good quality oil should be taken in moderation only.What is the ideal edible oil?An ideal cooking oil is one that contains healthy fats and nutrients, and does not break down on heating.Which oil meets this quality?Among various sources of vegetable oils, rapeseed-mustard oil is used mainly for cooking and frying as it meets most of the characteristics sought in dietary fats and oils. It has a high smoke point (240-250 degrees celcius), is low in saturated fatty acids (less than 10 per cent) and contains a relatively balanced proportion of essential fatty acids such as omega 6 and omega 3.This is in contrast to very high levels of saturated fatty acids in coconut (91 per cent), palm (51 per cent) oils, groundnut, soybean, corn and cottonseed oils (15 per cent). Rapeseed-mustard oil contains about 20-35 per cent PUFAs which are higher than those present in olive, coconut, palm or corn oils (usually 10 per cent or less). Sesame, niger, soybean, sunflower, safflower, corn and cottonseed oils contain 45-70 per cent PUFA. Rapeseed-mustard oil has a better ratio of Omega 3 to Omega 6 (1:2) as compared to soybean oil (1:8).A balanced proportion of omega 6 to Omega 3 is effective in reducing the risk of heart diseases. Rapeseed-mustard oil is also a rich source of plant sterols and vitamin E, which protects the body from cardiovascular diseases and contains higher levels of plant sterols and Vitamin E than soybean, and corn oil. It contains higher plant sterols than sunflowers, which are rich sources of Vitamin E.Meanwhile, rapeseed-mustard is a group of crops which includes Indian mustard/raya/laha, Indian rapeseed/toria, yellow sarson, brown sarson, oilseed rape/gobhi sarson and Ethiopian mustard/African sarson and taramira which are used as edible oil. Black mustard/Banarasi rai (mainly used as condiment in preparation of pickles etc.) and cauliflower/cabbage/broccoli are also members of the rapeseed-mustard family.Is rapeseed-mustard oil the best for consumption then?Not really, because rapeseed-mustard oil derived from conventional (traditional) varieties contains a high proportion (40-50 per cent) of erucic fatty acid (monounsaturated fatty acids) and low proportion of omega 9. Regular consumption of oil with more than 20 per cent erucic acid in the diet can cause thickening of arteries, which may lead to diseases like myocardial fibrosis in adults and lipidosis in children.Can erucic acid be reduced from rapeseed-mustard oil?Need to lower harmful erucic acid in oil has led to the development of low erucic acid varieties in rapeseed-mustard crops. Rapeseed-mustard varieties with low erucic (less than 2 per cent) or zero erucic have been termed as canola varieties.The term canola, which literally means Canadian oil, low acid was coined in Canada by the Western Canadian Oilseeds Crushers Association, where the first such variety was developed.Decrease in erucic acid in canola oil is also associated with corresponding increase in nutritionally desirable MUFA. Canola rapeseed-mustard oil contains higher levels (upto 67 per cent) of Omega 9 than conventional rapeseed-mustard.Other commonly used edible oils as olive oil contain (about 70-75 per cent) Omega 9, groundnut (50 per cent), rice bran, corn, cottonseed, palm, safflower, soybean, sesame and sunflower (less than 50 per cent), coconut oil (8 per cent). Canola oil makes it even better than olive oil which although contains highest proportion of omega 9 but also has higher amounts of SFAs (15 per cent) and much lower Omega-6 (8-10 per cent) and negligible amount of Omega -3 (1-3 per cent) as compared to canola oil which contains 7-8 per cent, 18-22, 8-12, respectively.Oils from groundnut, soybean, corn, sunflower, sesame, niger and safflower contain higher proportion (32-75 per cent) of omega 6, but higher proportion of PUFA makes the oil unstable at higher temperatures and potentially more prone to the production of trans-fats.Going by all these comparable qualities with other oils, Canola rapeseed-mustard oil is now a preferred cooking oil and is the most soughtafter across the world. Nutrition studies have shown that the unique fatty acid profile of canola helps mitigate factors associated with coronary heart disease including high blood cholesterol and thrombosis.In advanced countries including the USA, Canada, Europe, Japan, Australia, New Zealand etc., rapeseed-mustard conforming to canola norms can only be used as edible oil and oil from non-canola varieties is used for energy production (biofuel) or industrial purposes. They do not allow consumption of rapeseed-mustard oil with more than 2 per cent erucic acid.Canola quality rapeseed-mustard cultivars make the meal much safer for dairy animals and poultry where it is used as a preferred source of protein.What is the status of canola cultivation in India?Canola varieties are being grown in various parts of the country. In Punjab, farmers are by and large cultivating only canola quality rapeseed-mustard (mainly gobhi sarson). Canola varieties are also being grown in Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Rajasthan. But traditional varieties are also grown in large areas.PAU has developed and released three varieties  GSC 5 (2004), GSC 6 (2007) and GSC 7 (2014) and one hybrid PGSH 1707 (2020)  of canola quality (double low) gobhi sarson for commercial cultivation. PAU also released a canola variety RLC 3 (2015) and a hybrid RCH 1 (2019) of canola raya. Besides these, one hybrid of canola gobhi sarson developed by a private sector company has also been recommended for cultivation in the state.The ICAR  Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI), New Delhi, has also developed one canola quality variety PDZ 1 of raya (2015).In the past PAU and ICAR IARI have also developed a number of low erucic acid varieties of raya namely RLC 1 and RLC 2 (by PAU) and Pusa Krishma, Pusa Mustard 21, Pusa Mustard 22, Pusa Mustard 24, Pusa Mustard 28, Pusa Mustard 29, Pusa Mustard 30 and Pusa Mustard 32 (by ICAR IARI). Cultivation of these varieties is becoming popular in different mustard growing areas of the country.","‘Ban on blending of mustard oil will benefit farmers, lead to more production of healthier alternative’",RICE

Srinivas Reddy stated here on Tuesday that the increase in paddy procurement in the recent Rabi season was 594% compared to the quantity purchased during the 2014-15 Rabi season. Since formation of the State in 2014, the State government had procured 4.84 crore tonnes of paddy worth 84,000 crore from farmers.Since 2014-15 to 2019-20, 1,029 crore commission was paid to Indira Kranthi Patham (IKP), primary agriculture credit cooperative societies (PACS), district cooperative marketing societies (DCMS), Girijan Cooperative Corporation (GCC), Hyderabad Agricultural Cooperative Association (HACA) and other agencies for procurement of paddy from farmers on behalf of the Civil Supplies Corporation.Earlier, the production of food crops used to be higher in the Kharif season compared to the Rabi season but the situation has changed now. Rabi season is yielding more production and the paddy and other crops production during the recent season is an indication. In 2014-15, the paddy procurement during the Rabi seasdon was only 13.24 lakh tonnes and in 2020-21 Rabi season it is 92 lakh tonnes, Mr. Srinivas Reddy explained.The Rabi procurement commenced during the first week of April and the exercise continued for about two-and-a-half months by opening 6,968 purchase centres. All the purchase centre were closed since the procurement was completed, the TSCSC Chairman said.Procurement of paddy during the recent Rabi seaons was higher by 28 lakh tonnes compared to the previous Rabi season. The procurement target during the recent season was 80 lakh tonnes but the paddy purchases were 13% higher (12 lakh tonnes) by spending about 2,000 crore for gunny sacks, transportation and commission in addition to 17,300 crore for purchase of paddy.Mr. Srinivas Reddy explained that procurement during the recent season was higher by 100% to 225% compared to the targets in 23 districts. The procurement was 58.5% of the from 10 districts which contributed the most. The procurement was higher by 125% in Jogulamba-Gadwal district followed by Narayanpet (95%), Rangareddy (83%), Nirmal (44%), Warangal Rural (64%), Sangareddy (32%), Jayashankar-Bhupalapally (33%) and Vikarabad (44%) districts.During the combined Andhra Pradesh dispensation, the rice for States needs such as public distribution and others used to come from State like Punjab and others and on many occasions they were not consumable too. However, now the rice produced in the State was not only meeting the demands within but also supplying to other States too and 55% of the total procurement of rice by the Food Corporation of India last year was an ample indication.",TS procures 92 lakh tonnes paddy in recent Rabi season,RICE

After the success of global tax treaty, this matter will be automatically resolved and will pave way for fresh negotiation, a senior official from commerce ministry said.India imposed a 2% equalisation levy starting in April last year on earnings in the country by foreign technology and e-commerce companies like Amazon, Facebook and Google. It was opposed by the administration of former President Donald Trump, and he flagged the concerns many times, stopping trade negotiations. In 2018, Trump imposed 25% duties on steel and aluminium imports from India. In 2019, Trump withdrew the special treatment for some Indian exports, mostly low-tech items and handicrafts, under the General System of Preferences (GSP) that exempted them from import duties.Later, even Biden government reinvigorated tariff war against India with retaliation against digital tax.In June 2020, USTR initiated investigations into the digital services tax adopted or under consideration in ten jurisdictions: Austria, Brazil, the Czech Republic, European Union, India, Indonesia, Italy, Spain, Turkey, and the UK. The US Trade Representative had found Indias 2% equalisation levy unreasonably contravening international tax principles and specifically discriminating against US digital companies. On June 2 this year, US Trade Representative Katherine Tai announced the plan for the 25% increase in the tariffs on 26 items from India  from prawns and Basmati rice to furniture and jewellery  in retaliation to New Delhis Digital Services Tax (DST) imposition on tech giants. Estimates indicate that the value of DST payable by US-based company groups to India will be up to approx $55 million per year, Tai had said. But announcing it, Tai added that the hikes will be on hold till December.Explaining the reason for holding the increases in abeyance for the six countries, Tai said it was to help the international negotiations on taxation.Now that India has agreed to join the treaty, it has to let go the equalisation tax and instead it will be able to tax big multinationals doing business in the country, without a physical presence or permanent establishment, at 20 per cent of their profits. The framework got the approval of the G7 leaders last month and is expected to come up at the meeting of the finance ministers of the G20 group of major economies in Venice next week.",Agreement on global digital tax likely to boost India-US trade negotiations,RICE

Three of seven villagers who were hit on the ground died.The aircraft had 96 people on board, including three pilots and five crew while the rest were army personnel, the military said, adding only five soldiers remained unaccounted for late Sunday. The pilots survived but were seriously injured, officials said.The Lockheed C-130 Hercules was one of two ex-U.S. Air Force aircraft handed over to the Philippines as part of military assistance this year.Officials said the injured personnel were brought to a hospital in Sulu or flown to nearby Zamboanga city and troops were continuing to search for the missing. A number of soldiers were seen jumping out of the aircraft before it hit the ground, sparing them from the explosion caused by the crash, a military statement said, citing witnesses.Initial pictures released by the military showed the tail section of the cargo plane relatively intact. The other parts of the plane were burned or scattered in pieces in a clearing surrounded by coconut trees. Soldiers and other rescuers with stretchers were seen dashing to and from the smoke-shrouded crash site, where a dark gray smoke billowed shortly after impact.The plane was transporting troops, many of them new soldiers who had just undergone basic training, from the southern Cagayan de Oro city for deployment in Sulu, officials said.They were supposed to join us in our fight against terrorism, Sulu military commander Maj. Gen. William Gonzales said. Government forces have been battling Abu Sayyaf militants in the predominantly Muslim province of Sulu for decades.It was not immediately clear what caused the crash. Regional military commander Lt. Gen. Corleto Vinluan said it was unlikely that the aircraft took hostile fire, and cited witnesses as saying that it appeared to have overshot the runway then crashed on the periphery of the airport.Its very unfortunate, military chief of staff Gen. Cirilito Sobejana told reporters. The plane missed the runway and it was trying to regain power but failed and crashed.An air force official told The Associated Press that the Jolo runway is shorter than most others in the country, making it more difficult for pilots to adjust if an aircraft misses the landing spot. The official, who has flown military aircraft to and from Jolo several times, spoke on condition of anonymity because of a lack of authority to speak publicly.Initial pictures showed that the weather was apparently fine in Sulu, although other parts of the Philippines were experiencing rains due to an approaching tropical depression.

Three of seven villagers who were hit on the ground died.The aircraft had 96 people on board, including three pilots and five crew while the rest were army personnel, the military said, adding only five soldiers remained unaccounted for late Sunday. The pilots survived but were seriously injured, officials said.The Lockheed C-130 Hercules was one of two ex-U.S. Air Force aircraft handed over to the Philippines as part of military assistance this year.Officials said the injured personnel were brought to a hospital in Sulu or flown to nearby Zamboanga city and troops were continuing to search for the missing. A number of soldiers were seen jumping out of the aircraft before it hit the ground, sparing them from the explosion caused by the crash, a military statement said, citing witnesses.Initial pictures released by the military showed the tail section of the cargo plane relatively intact. The other parts of the plane were burned or scattered in pieces in a clearing surrounded by coconut trees. Soldiers and other rescuers with stretchers were seen dashing to and from the smoke-shrouded crash site, where a dark gray smoke billowed shortly after impact.The plane was transporting troops, many of them new soldiers who had just undergone basic training, from the southern Cagayan de Oro city for deployment in Sulu, officials said.They were supposed to join us in our fight against terrorism, Sulu military commander Maj. Gen. William Gonzales said. Government forces have been battling Abu Sayyaf militants in the predominantly Muslim province of Sulu for decades.It was not immediately clear what caused the crash. Regional military commander Lt. Gen. Corleto Vinluan said it was unlikely that the aircraft took hostile fire, and cited witnesses as saying that it appeared to have overshot the runway then crashed on the periphery of the airport.Its very unfortunate, military chief of staff Gen. Cirilito Sobejana told reporters. The plane missed the runway and it was trying to regain power but failed and crashed.An air force official told The Associated Press that the Jolo runway is shorter than most others in the country, making it more difficult for pilots to adjust if an aircraft misses the landing spot. The official, who has flown military aircraft to and from Jolo several times, spoke on condition of anonymity because of a lack of authority to speak publicly.Initial pictures showed that the weather was apparently fine in Sulu, although other parts of the Philippines were experiencing rains due to an approaching tropical depression.

2021-07-04,https://indianexpress.com/article/india/feed-developed-by-icar-also-increases-weight-milk-production-feed-supplement-reduces-methane-emissions-by-livestock-7389140/,"Harit Dhara acts by decreasing the population of protozoa microbes in the rumen, responsible for hydrogen production and making it available to the archaea for reduction of CO2 to methane. (Representational)Cattle, buffaloes, sheep and goats in India emit an estimated 9.25-14.2 million tonnes of methane annually  a sizable proportion of the around 90 mt methane emitted by livestock across the world. This is a cause for serious concern, given that methane is a very potent greenhouse gas.With this in mind, an Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) institute has developed an anti-methanogenic feed supplement, called Harit Dhara. When given to bovines and sheep, it not only cuts down their methane emissions by 17-20 per cent, but also results in higher milk production and bodyweight gain.An average lactating cow or buffalo in India emits around 200 litres of methane per day, while it is 85-95 litres for young growing heifers and 20-25 litres for adult sheep. Feeding Harit Dhara can reduce these by a fifth. For a cow producing 200 litres (143 g) of methane, it translates into 0.714 kg less of CO2 equivalent emissions daily or 261 kg per year (1 litre methane=0.714 g; 1 kg methane=25 kg CO2), Dr Raghavendra Bhatta, director of the ICARs National Institute of Animal Nutrition and Physiology (NIANP) at Bengaluru, told The Indian Express.Methane is produced by animals having rumen, in the first of their four stomachs, where the plant material they eat  cellulose, fibre, starch and sugars  gets fermented or broken down by microorganisms prior to further digestion and nutrient absorption. Carbohydrate fermentation leads to production of CO2 and hydrogen. These are used as substrate by archaea  microbes in the rumen with structure similar to bacteria  to produce methane, which the animals then expel through burping.Harit Dhara acts by decreasing the population of protozoa microbes in the rumen, responsible for hydrogen production and making it available to the archaea for reduction of CO2 to methane. Tropical plants containing tannins  bitter and astringent chemical compounds  are known to suppress or remove protozoa from the rumen.Our product has been prepared using condensed and hydrolysable tannin-rich plant-based sources abundantly available in the country. Harit Dhara roughly costs Rs 6/kg and it is to be fed only to animals aged above three months having fully functional rumen. Our recommended daily dosage is 500 g for adult cattle and buffaloes, 150 g for growing bovines and 50 g for adult sheep, said Bhatta.However, lowering of enteric methane emissions may not sufficient economic justification for farmers to feed Harit Dhara. What NIANPs anti-methanogenic feed supplement also does is change the composition of the volatile fatty acids that are the end-products of rumen fermentation (along with hydrogen and CO2).Fermentation continues as before, but there is more production of propionic acid now in proportion to acetic and butyric acid. Since propionic acid provides much of the energy for lactose (milk sugar) production and body weight gain, there is economic benefit too from feeding of Harit Dhara. The biological energy loss from methane emission can be rechanneled and utilised by the animal for milk production and growth, explained Bhatta.According to him, feeding 500 g Harit Dhara to lactating cattle and buffaloes would increase milk output by 300-400 ml/animal/day. The additional weight gain will, likewise, be 20-25 g/day from 150g for growing bovines and about 7 g/day from 50 g for adult sheep. At Rs 30/litre milk price, the benefit-cost ratio for the dairy farmer works out to 3:1.We have done field validation and filed a patent for Harit Dhara. Compound animal feed manufacturers can also incorporate it into their products by replacing wheat or de-oiled rice bran. Farmers wouldnt have to, then, separately feed Harit Dhara to their animals, added Bhatta.The 2019 Livestock Census showed Indias cattle population at 193.46 million, along with 109.85 million buffaloes, 148.88 million goats and 74.26 million sheep. Being largely fed on agricultural residues  wheat/paddy straw and maize, sorghum or bajra stover  ruminants in India tend to produce 50-100% higher methane than their industrialised country counterparts that are given more easily fermentable/digestible concentrates, silages and green fodder.",Feed supplement reduces methane emissions by livestock,RICE

Later in the day, the Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM)  which had issued a July 5 ultimatum to PSPCL to improve power supply to the agricultural sector or they would gherao Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singhs residence Moti Mahal in Patiala on July 6  released a statement: Due to improvement in power supply for AP consumers, we have postponed the program of gherao of Moti Mahal on July 6.PSPCL Chairman cum Managing Director A Venuprasad told The Indian Express: We have been supplying full power to AP for the past three days. We have purchased additional power. There is no cut in the domestic sector as well. However, power have been regulated to certain industries.PSPCL has divided Punjab into five zones, and each zone is further divided into three groups each. According to July data of PSPCL, in the border zone, which has Gurdaspur, Amritsar and Tarn Taran districts, average power supply to the AP sector in all three groups is 12.4 hours, while the central zone, which has Ludhiana East, Ludhiana West, Ludhiana Sub-urban and Khanna divisions, average supply to AP sector is 8 hours. In the north zone (Kapurthala, Jalandhar, Hoshiarpur and Nawanshahr districts), average power supply to the AP sector in all three groups is 10.3 hours, said CMD PSPCL. West zones average power supply to AP sector is for 8.9 hours. This zone has Bathinda, Faridkot, Muktsar and Ferozepur districts while average power supply to south zones (Patiala, Sangrur, Barnala, Ropar and Mohali) AP sector is for 9.6 hours.This supply is being given at the cost of curbs on Punjabs industry, ban on ACs and change in office hours at government offices.Meanwhile, after three days of compulsory offs in large scale industry, steel rolling mills and furnaces in central and north zone, this compulsory off will now be imposed on the industry in similar category in south and border zone from 8 am of July 4 to 8 am of July 7.Meanwhile, Ludhiana industry regulation is over and the continous process industry in the state, except those dealing in essential services, will be allowed to operate at 30 per cent capacity from Monday, A Venu Prasad said in a press statement Sunday.Units dealing in essential services including poultry, rice shellers, telecom and call centres have been exempted from these restrictions and are allowed to operate fully, he added.Power officers to visit villages dailyA circular taken out by PSPCL Director Distribution D P S Grewal stated that field officers such as sub-divisional officers (SDOs), senior executive engineers (Sr. XEN) and superintendent engineers (SEs) must visit villages on a daily basis from July 5 to July 19 in order to meet villagers, sarpanches and kisan unions to listen to their grievances. The circular further says that officers should note down all the major works required to be carried out in those villages. The issues which cannot be resolved at SDO/Sr. XEN level should be raised before SEs or chief engineers (CEs). Every SDO must visit five villages daily while a Sr. XEN must visit five villages in any one subdivision on a daily basis and SE should visit five villages daily in any one division.All major issues must be compiled by Sr. XENs on alternate days and should be submitted to their CE through SE.

I love discovering new cultures and interacting with different kinds of people and it also widens your perspective. These experiences and interactions have led me to write columns for different newspapers and my own blogs for over a decade,Could you share some interesting anecdotes about your travels across the world?The most abiding memory was from my maiden visit to Incheon, South Korea where I nearly starved.This was many years back, just before it became a destination for international conventions. Being a vegetarian, options are often quite limited in foreign shores, but in Incheon, it seemed as though the very concept of vegetarian food did not exist at that time. I survived on Korean rice and tomato puree for the entire duration of my stay. Another one is the chilling account of 9/11. I was there in New York on that ill-fated day and had watched in horror from my room as the planes flew into the twin towers. In fact, a day earlier, I had planned a visit to the North Tower in the morning with a few of my friends and UN officials, but postponed my plans when I got a call from the Indian Mission requesting I visit them. That was when I not only thanked God, but actually felt I had lived to tell the tale owing to divine intervention.As a globetrotter could you comment on the future of travel, given the pandemic?I travel a lot, almost on a weekly basis and I dont remember having stayed in one place for such a long period. Though the world is starting to get back on its feet and things are slowly returning to normal, it will never be the same. There is so much uncertainty and so many protocols to follow especially for International travel. The second wave has hit us badly, and we are recovering only now, whether it will stay this way or well experience another slump, no one knows. Travel restrictions will continue to shape in the months to come, airlines have gone into major losses, hotels cannot give you the same service anymore, but now that vaccination is out hopefully we will get there.Could you give some suggestions on preserving our culture and heritage?The younger generation must grasp the value and need for cultural and heritage preservation. While I always believe in the principle of being a global citizen, we also must learn Apni Bhasha Apne Log My various organisations carry out various cultural activities with the aim of promoting Indias heritage. We work with folk artists across India and take these events overseas to showcase the essence of India. We also started a project which aims to popularize heritage among children nationwide by weaving it into formal and informal education through student activity.Are you working on a new book?I have a new book I am working on at the moment which is on my enriching experience during my visit to Oslo, Norway.",‘I have always had a penchant for travelling’,RICE

The declaration came amidst a spate of intense agitations across the state, with the BJP in the lead, over alleged gross irregularities in mandis as rice farmers claimed they have been left high and dry with too much unsold paddy. Farmers are a very crucial constituent in the voters mix in Odisha and with panchayat polls due next year, no party wants to lose sight of them. The BJP knows that the BJDs Krushak Assistance for Livelihood and Income Augmentation (KALIA) scheme, unveiled before the 2019 polls, turned out to be a game-changer of sorts. Caught in the political crosshairs are farmers, but their problems seem to be far from over. When kharif procurement ended earlier this year, farmers were out dumping their produce onto the streets with the same complaintsa flawed system that keeps them at the mercy of primary cooperative societies. The government has time and again come up with the same answerprocurement target has been reached, which turns out to be more than the previous year. If everything is hunky-dory with the system, why are farmers up in arms every year? Paddy procurement in Odisha is a massive Rs 14,000 crore annual business. A large chunk of the farming community is stuck to it because it has an MSP attached, unlike the larger basket of commodities for which the Centre offers support price.At least four departmentsAgriculture, Cooperation, Civil Supplies and Revenuedeal with it at different stages, but farmers have none to vent their grievances to. District Collectors do not meet them; farmers cannot access the bureaucratic top brass; systems designed for them are too one-way in nature. What is more baffling is no attempt is being made to understand if their complaints are genuine or driven by vested interests. Those who feed millions deserve that much attention at least.",Odisha out of sync with its farmers?,RICE

Soon, one can get a taste of food that was popular three to four generations ago but faded out of the daily menu as industrialisation of agriculture took centrestage.City agricultural scientists are reviving the foods that provided nutritional support to our forefathers. Scientists at International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (Icrisat) at Patancheru have prepared a mega list of foodgrains, vegetables, fruits and oil seeds that were widely cultivated about 100 to 150 years ago.Some were popular as recent as four to five decades ago. The list also includes leafy vegetables, fruits and vegetables that are fast disappearing from the farmers priority crops.According to scientists, tuber crops like sweet potato and yam and pulses like red gram and masoor dal (lentils) are losing popularity and grains like sorghum has already made it to the forgotten foods list. It may sound strange but even popular potato, jackfruit, tamarind and custard apple are losing their sheen as preferred foodstuff.Some of the foods popular during great grandpas time were grain amaranth, buckwheat, chenopods, finger millet, foxtail millet, proso millet, kodo millet, barnyard millet, rice bean, moth bean, adzuki bean, faba bean, horse gram, taro, cassava, sweet potato, yams, Jewish plum, sea buckthorn, Jobs tears, paradise tree, spine gourd, sweet hibiscus, amaranth, grass pea, wood apple, star fruit, Indian jujube, rai, lafa, water lily, lotus and bamboo.The Icrisat team, among scientists from other research bodies, have prepared the list as part of a global manifesto for submission at UN Food Systems Summit later this year. These foods are not only nutritious but also solve food shortage. Last month, Icrisat scientists held an international seminar on grandpas foods in the run-up to the UN summit.Joanna Kane-Potaka, assistant director-general, Icrisat, said: Forgotten foods have the potential to fix several problems that our food systems face today and will face in the future as the worlds population grows, climate uncertainty becomes more common and diet-related diseases rise. It is time that we rid them of their forgotten tag and embrace them to realize the change we wish to see, with farmers at the centre of change for bringing back biodiversity.Dr Ravi Khetrapal, executive secretary, Asia Pacific Association of Agricultural Research Institutions, said the manifesto developed by collective action will soon lead to a global plan of action to mainstream these foods. The key now is to have a good communication strategy to ensure awareness of forgotten foods and to make policy interventions to transform agri-food research and innovation systems, he said.Historical data shows that people in the past had cultivated and consumed a wide variety of food crops, which had high nutrition value. However, because of modern, industrialized agriculture and consequent changes in policies and food habits, many have moved away from traditional foods. These have now almost become forgotten food.",Hyderabad experts reviving grandpa’s healthy food,RICE

The bank report to the CBI said the turnover growth of the company came to an abrupt halt in 2015 with the account turning into a Non-Performing Asset (NPA) and it was ultimately declared a fraud in 2019.The account turned an NPA on account of inventory losses owing to a steep fall in paddy prices, under-utilisation of capital expenditure in the rice and paddy segments and a delay in the tie-up funds to tide over losses, an investigation report by the bank on staff accountability had noted in 2017.A forensic audit done by the bankers pointed out that the company, in its account books of financial year 2015-16, showed that its inventory worth over Rs 3,000 crore got damaged due to pests and was sold at substantially low prices.This was contradictory to the stock and receivable audit report, which showed that the company had a stock of over Rs 3,500 crore in September 2015, its warehouses were fully stocked and none of the inventory was obsolete or slow moving, the bank had alleged in its complaint.",Bank fraud: ED arrests Shakti Bhog CMD in money laundering case,RICE

(Express photo by Abhinav Saha)Delia Didi Contractor was an artist, designer and a self-taught architect. For over three decades, she worked in Kangra valley, Himachal Pradesh, promoting the need to live and build sustainably. She died on July 5 due to age-related ailments at her home in Sidhbari. She was 91.With over 15 homes and numerous public projects, Didis name has been synonymous with designing low-waste buildings.The only child of a German father and American mother, who were engaged in the influential Bauhaus movement, Didi made India her home in 1951, when she married the late Narayan Ramji Contractor. Through her husbands friend, Maharana Bhagwant Singh Mewar, the Maharana of Udaipur, she had the opportunity to decorate the Lake Palace Hotel in 1961.Her interactions with social reformer and cultural aesthete Kamaladevi Chattopadhyay gave her impetus to pursue new learnings in traditional Indian crafts, which led to design textiles, furnishings and furniture. She was deeply influenced by philosopher Ananda Coomaraswamys ideas on art and swadeshi, and Gandhian ideas of appropriate technology. It gave her a vision of what India could be and what was fast disappearing.Didis predilection for rural life brought her to Andretta in Kangra in the 70s, where she observed and learnt the nuances of local construction with sun-dried mud bricks, bamboo and slate, and began designing solar cookers in mud and glass.In an interview to The Indian Express, Didi had said, One of the many things thats wrong today is that people are not ready to accommodate their lives to the rhythm of the universe. We dont see the wisdom of nature. Technology should also be consistent with a humanistic agenda of making people comfortable with themselves, with one another and nature.ALSO READ | Unto the Earth: Didi Contractors oeuvre is a story of rare beautyThrough her own life, Didi showed what it meant to live sustainably  in the way she recycled materials in her own home, the clothes she wore, the food she ate. In her first project in 1995, a community clinic for a friend in Kangra, she used local materials, adding her own ingredients to tradition techniques. She was already in her 60s by then. There was always room for experiments, from using rice husk and pine in the mud plaster for insulation to using waste car tyres to fill up berms. While concrete was a default choice for many in the hills, Contractor showed how mud could stand the test of time, be it absorbing radiation, as a good insulator, or even be earthquake resistant.Architect and urban designer KT Ravindran, who has known her for over 35 years, said, Didis designs dont come from a romantic notion of nature or vernacular buildings, but from a value base that knew what was good for the world. She explored the quintessential behaviour of mud, bamboo and slate and converted it into a new idiom in her buildings.Didi was awarded the Nari Shakti Puraskar in 2019 for her work in promoting local skills and innovating new techniques using traditional materials. Bengaluru-based architect Chitra Vishwanath, recalls, Didi championed the hands-on kind of architecture, where she privileged the handmade. She revolutionised the use of mud, taking care of every contemporary need, with more light and air.For more lifestyle news, follow us: Twitter: lifestyle_ie | Facebook: IE Lifestyle | Instagram: ie_lifestyle","Didi Contractor, champion of low-waste buildings, is no more",RICE

These meteorological hazards expose the vulnerable farmers and their crops to risks of failure.The study, which establishes that monsoon precipitation is sensitive to the choice of irrigation practices in South Asia, can help plan agricultural practices in this region.South Asia is one of the most heavily-irrigated regions of the world, largely using groundwater, and its major summer crop is paddy, cultivated in flooded fields. Hence it was pertinent to study how such practices can influence the monsoons that form the fulcrum of this agro-based economy.Subimal Ghosh, Professor in the Department of Civil Engineering and Convener at Interdisciplinary Programme in Climate Studies (IDPCS), a Centre of Excellence at IIT Bombay supported by the Department of Science and Technology and his climate group, investigated the impact of agricultural water use on the Indian Summer Monsoon using a climate model.ALSO READ | Is deforestation penalty irrational?The research published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters arrived at the above findings.In another study, Professor Subhankar Karmakar from IDPCS, IIT Bombay, and his research group identified for the first time that risks for rice and wheat have increased in the recent decade, with wheat facing it at a two-fold higher magnitude than rice.The study followed the Assessment Report 5 of IPCC definition to quantify 'Risk' and has been published in Environmental Research Letters.Increasing crop risk is predominantly driven by the decreasing number of farmers, and the wheat risk is also attributed to increasing minimum temperatures during the crop-growing season. This study provided compelling evidence indicating that the hydro-climatic hazards related to precipitation extremes and drought are specifically alarmingly increasing the crops' risk as compared to temperature extremes.Another finding obtained from this study was extreme rainfall in recent decades in Central India has been increasing, and this is also caused by an increase in irrigation and consequent increase in evapotranspiration (the sum of evaporation from the land surface plus transpiration from plants).",Excess irrigation over northern India risking agriculture in other regions,RICE
2021-07-05,https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/football/euro-2020-luke-shaw-emerges-from-hurt-humiliation-7390493/,"In Jose Mourinhos new backyard, Luke Shaw made the former Manchester United manager eat his words  through a couple of assists for Harry Maguire and Harry Kane and his overall display in Englands Euro 2020 quarterfinal rout of Ukraine. Shaws performance was so impressive that even Brazilian legend Roberto Carlos applauded it on social media. Shaws England team-mate Declan Rice was quick to pounce on the praise and coined a moniker, Shawberto, which has now become popular at St Georges Park.After being sacked by Tottenham Hotspur, Mourinho has moved to take charge of Roma, a side that finished seventh in Serie A last season. Befittingly, Shaw dished out his best performance in the Euros yet at the Stadio Olimpico, Romas home ground. Only a day previously, Mourinho had checked in at his new base in Rome.During his two-and-a-half-year spell at United, Mourinhos handling of Shaw bordered on the insensitive. Time and again, he derided the player in public.Exhibit 1: In 2017, after a draw against Swansea in which Shaw was substituted in the ninth minute, the then United manager aimed a thinly-veiled dig at the player. At the moment, we cannot walk from the bed to the toilet without breaking a leg. Mind, Shaw had just recovered from a double leg break.Exhibit 2: After a 1-1 draw with Everton earlier in the season, Mourinho had claimed that Shaw was playing with his body and his managers brain. He was in front of me and I was making every decision for him. He has to change his football brain.The grapevine has it that Shaw snubbed Mourinhos approach and joined United in 2014, when the latter was managing Chelsea and the Portuguese has been bearing a grudge ever since. The carry-over effect continued to the ongoing Euros, as Mourinho, working as a pundit on talkSPORT, singled out Shaws dramatically bad corner-taking against Czech Republic. He had earlier backed Chelseas Ben Chilwell to start over the United defender.Shaws response ahead of Englands Round-of-16 fixture against Germany was a cultured put-down. He just needs to move on. Hopefully he can find his peace with that and finally move on and stop worrying about me. Clearly Im in his head a lot and he clearly thinks about me a lot. After the Ukraine match, when Mourinho finally heaped praise on Shaw, the left-back reacted with indifference.Shaw now has the second-most assists, three, in Euro 2020, only one behind Switzerlands Steven Zuber. The Swiss has returned home, while the boy from Surrey is going to Wembley for the semifinal against Denmark on Wednesday. Shaw is also on par with David Beckham in terms of the number of assists for an England player in a European Championship. Beckham had three at Euro 2000.The resurgenceTo find out how Shaw turned the corner, one has to rewind to early 2020 and a press conference at Carrington, Uniteds training base. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was about 13 months into his job as United manager, the process of culture reset and cleaning up the mess had started, but Bruno Fernandes was yet to arrive at the club. In another injury-marred season, Shaw had started only 10 games and was in danger of conceding his place to an emerging Brandon Williams. Manchester Evening News gave the lowdown on what transpired at the presser.Solskjaer was asked about whether the back four of Aaron Wan-Bissaka, Victor Lindelof, Harry Maguire and Williams was the one to build for the future. Shaws name wasnt even mentioned. And potentially we have the best left-back in England. Luke has the potential to be the best one. And that is the great challenge for him now, said the United manager. After years of turbulence, Shaw finally had a manager who believed in him.Solskjaer wasnt just giving lip service. As a United season ticket holder said, the manager threw down the gauntlet and made Shaw believe that he has the ability to be the best left-back in the Premier League. A year-and-a-half down the line, Shaw won Uniteds Players Player of the Year award at the end of the 2020-21 season, got back into the England team and became Gareth Southgates first-choice left-back. I was losing my belief. I think that is what changed with Ole, Shaw had said in an interview with Sky Sports earlier this year.As per Premier League stats, Shaw was ninth in the list in the 2020-21 season in terms of delivering the number of crosses, 189. whoscored.com tallied his number of key passes in the league last season at 72.Mourinhos tough love, that didnt hesitate to throw his players under the bus, didnt work with Shaw. He has flourished under Solskjaers human touch. In the national team also, Southgate has given him the licence to express himself. Of course, I could go through a lot of people to thank but I think the most important one is obviously Gareth for trusting me and putting me in the squad and picking me and playing me, Shaw said after the Ukraine game.Never say dieBorn and bred in Kingston upon Thames, Shaw grew up as a Chelsea fan, idolising Gianfranco Zola. Chelseas development centre was his first port of call, but the club didnt offer him an academy place. Very early in life, Shaw suffered a setback. In 2002, Southampton came calling and the clubs top-class academy nurtured a top-class talent. A senior team contract ensued in 2011 and Shaw started to make steady progress. In 2013-14, his form was impressive enough to make the PFA Young Player of the Year award shortlist and the United recruitment team was watching. In 2014, he signed a 30 million contract with United, becoming the most expensive teenager in world football in the process.Shaws development continued under then United manager Louis van Gaal but the Hector Moreno tackle lay ahead. During a Champions League match against PSV Eindhoven in September 2015, the Mexico defender lunged into Shaw and the result was a double leg fracture on his right leg. The youngster has survived the career-threatening injury and Mourinho to return to his peak.Englands golden generation failed to win anything, for they hardly played as a team. Southgates golden team is inching closer to offset a 55-year hurt  1966 was the only time England won a major tournament  thriving on team spirit. And Shaw has become central to the Three Lions forward march.","Euro 2020: Luke Shaw emerges from hurt, humiliation",RICE

She says she is awaiting the day when she will be able to harvest again the five acres that she inherited as part of family property in Maruvakkad in Chellanam panchayat, where the paddy collective extends over a total of 420 acres with around 260 acres identified as cultivable.Pokkali cultivation has been disrupted in the paddy collective for more than a decade, but Ms. Kalathungals indomitable spirit was evident during a brief birthday celebration, in which only a few people participated, restricted by the COVID-19 protocol.Pokkali rice cultivation in the Maruvakkad paddy collective has caught attention with the Kerala High Court directing the district administration to make arrangements quickly to drain the fields to pave the way for rice cultivation. The directive came on a petition by farmer Manjadiparambil Chantu. After the court directive, revenue officials visited the paddy collective on Saturday to review the condition of the fields.Pokkali farmers have been appealing for intervention from the authorities to help maintain the traditional rice-and-fish cycle. However, they had alleged that the lucrative shrimp farming had resulted in the rice cycle being abandoned mid way or in pushing up the cost of cultivation. But farmers like Ms. Kalathungal is not put down easily. She is ready to take up cultivation if the fields can be readied for sowing.Pokkali rice is a saltwater-resistant variety that is grown along the coastal fields of Alappuzha, Ernakulam and Thrissur. The rice variety has won global attention with its resilience and has been granted the Geographical Indication tag.The traditional farming cycle comprises one-rice-one-fish season, each spread equally over a period of one year. Over the years, shortage of labour, rising costs, and heavy rains due to substantially changed climatic conditions have resulted in the rice cultivation taking a big beating.","On 97th birthday, this pokkali farmer from Kochi wishes for a rich harvest",RICE

The reason behind the crisis, farmers said, is resumption of works under Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) and the State governments Rs 1 per kg rice scheme.Sources said the farm workers are content with the earnings from the 100-day work under the rural job scheme rather than toil in the fields. The cheap rice scheme has also reduced the size of agriculture work force.Prakash Behera (60), a retired government employee of Srirampur village is the owner of five acre of land. Since the last one week, he has been running from pillar to post to get at least 10 workers to plant paddy saplings on his field but to no avail. These days, workers get rice at a cheap rate from the government while many earn money by doing little work under MGNREGS. This has led to acute shortage of farm hands in the region. I find myself in deep trouble as I am yet to start farming activities in absence of workers, he said.Echoing similar concerns, Ashok Rout of Gopinathpur village said nowadays, a farm worker demands Rs 400 as daily wage apart from food during the cultivation season.

For the last one and half years, these frontline workers have extended their immense contributions to battle against COVID-19. And now that we are entering the monsoon season, it is further going to increase their workload as the season comes with a host of infections, the major ones being flu and typhoid. It is now our responsibility as individuals to focus on our first and foremost line of defense system  immunity, in order to lessen the burden on our doctors.Typhoid is a bacterial infection caused by contaminated water, milk or food leading to high fever, diarrhea and vomiting. It can also lead to ulcer formation and intestine infection/damage. In typhoid, the gut plays an important role, which at times affects our food habits  either your appetite goes up or down. Headaches are also very common in typhoid because there is an undeniable connection between our mind and the gut.Here is what you can do:Energise yourself: It is important to improve energy levels to sustain the body during the period of infection. Simple carbohydrates  fruits, coconut water, healthy homemade porridges, rice conjee and vegetables  are a good source. Fruits and veggies are antioxidants that reduce oxidative stress as well as inflammation.Repair your body with protein: In typhoid, people tend to lose their muscle mass and tissue; even the Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) goes high to maintain your normal body temperature which contributes to weight loss. When it comes to healing and repairing the body, proteins play an important role. Add A2 milk curd, sattu or pulses or legumes, thoroughly cooked eggs or organic fish or chicken (in moderation) into your diet.Eat light: Try adding easy to digest foods in order to reduce intestinal inflammation as heavy foods may irritate the gut lining and increase inflammation.No to spices: Keep your food less spicy during recovery to avoid an inflamed stomach.Keep yourself hydrated: Drink plenty of water and fluids to hydrate the cells and detoxify the body. If your taste is affected, drink lemon, cucumber-mint or fennel-infused water.No creams: It is advised to avoid butter, margarine, refined vegetable oil, extra chilies or spices and fibre-heavy food.

The restaurant, serving fusion food in Fort Kochi, is not willing to let the pandemic beat its business.A week ago, it launched an in-car dining service, which has customers pulling up in front of the restaurant, ordering thookkuporotta and eating it without stepping out of their cars. Kaasa is just one of the restaurants in Kochi that has started in-car dining. Not just thookkuporotta, any dish that is served in the restaurant can now be had in the comfort of ones car.Kaasa has designed an entire ceremony around it  offering finger bowls and a temporary car fumigator that would prevent the smell of food lingering in the car. The food is served on specially-designed elongated trays that fit in the car in such a way that would allow passengers to roll up the windows and switch on the AC. They can vibe to the music of their choice as they dig into their favourite meal, says Sharon Gafoor, owner of Kaasa Kitchen.Classic drive-inWith restrictions on dining-in still in effect, Kerala has revived the age-old concept of the classic drive-in. With the Kerala Tourism Development Corporation (KTDC) launching in-car dining services in restaurants operating under it across the State on June 30, the trend has caught on.Meanwhile in other cities While most cities have started dining in, this could be a model to follow even in a post COVID scenario, says Gunasekharan M, senior manager of TTDC Hotel on Azhagar Kovil Road, Madurai. One of the first restaurants in Madurai to adapt to the COVID situation by offering in-car dining and al fresco, Gunasekharan says the idea it eliminates fear of the disease spreading in a closed, air-conditioned space. Even after COVID passes, people may prefer to be cautious, he adds.With dining in set to restart in Tamil Nadu, the restaurant would offer both regular dine-in along with in-car dining. Here, instead of one elongated tray, each passenger is given a tray that is fixed to the door. A large screen placed in the out-door dining area provides entertainment too.Radhika Jalan, owner of La Macario Cafein St. Mullik Bazaar, Kolkata, tried the in-car dining experiment after the second wave of COVID-19. Even as restrictions have been lifted, people see to be wary and prefer to eat in their cars. Since the cafe serves Mediterranean and Italian fare, Radhika says it is not difficult to eat in the car. She gives packaged food with free disposable cutlery.While KTDCs move is aimed at reviving the ailing tourism sector, it also offers respite to people who are looking for options to eat while travelling. Since some of the KTDC restaurants are in scenic locations like Alappuzha, Kuttippuram and Kannur, travellers can enjoy a good meal and the experience could feel like a micro-vacation, says an official in KTDC. Especially those travelling with elderly people and children feel safer not to step out, he adds. The service is currently operational in KTDCs restaurants at Kottarakkara, Kayamkulam, Alappuzha, Kuttippuram and Kannur. From breakfast to lunch, dinner, beverages and snacks, the food is served on long trays that can be fitted across the front and back seats of the car.While restaurateurs maintain that in-car dining has its challenges, it has been a great way to tide over the tough phase, keeping jobs and livelihoods. Zaatar in Kochi, which serves typically Arabian fare, tweaked its menu to suit the car-dining experience. We cut down a bit on our gravy-heavy Indian dishes and are focussing more on our traditional Arabic fare and Chinese, says Mohammed Moosa, one of the founding members of the restaurant. We cannot say that business is great, but it certainly has helped us stay afloat, he adds.Al fahm and Arabic rice are the most ordered dishes, Moosa adds. Business is from 12.30 pm to 9 pm on weekdays. Zamzam in Thiruvananthapuram and Kozhikode has also begun serving its biryani and chicken dishes in the car.For those serving continental food, however, the shift to in-car dining has been easiest. Cafe 17 on the canopied Old Thevara Road in Kochi serves burgers, steaks, sandwiches, pizzas and pastas.Parking facilityThe availability of parking space has been a huge factor in deciding the trend, say restaurateurs. Most of the places offering in-car dining has the provision to park at least 10 to 15 cars at a time.A customer being served a meal in his car at Kaasa Kitchen, Fort Kochi | Photo Credit: THULASI KAKKATThe experiment, says Gafoor, has worked well with cars queuing up, outside Kaasa Kitchen every evening. It helps that we have a view of the Santa Cruz grounds and the trees in the area that are over 300 years old, he adds, The idea is to give the customer the exact same experience of food as he or she would get inside the restaurant, without having to step out of the safety of their cars.",Kerala revives the classic drive-in restaurant concept,RICE

(Lars Baron/Pool Photo via AP)The last time England encountered Denmark at Wembley, in a Nations League match last October, Harry Maguire left the field seething in rage, just 31 minutes into the game after copping his second yellow card. Five minutes later, his defensive colleague Kyle Walker and goalkeeper Jordan Pickford were locked in a horrible tangle with a Denmark player inside the box that culminated in a penalty, which turned out to be the match-defining moment. At the final whistle, full-back Reece James barged into the referee and picked up a red card himself.Those were darker days in England football; Maguire was the tabloid villain after his storied and juicy escapades in Greece, right-back Kieran Trippier had to clear his name off betting charges; Tammy Abraham, Ben Chilwell and Jadon Sancho were busy churning out page-three-worthy stuff. The aforementioned match was seen not as prognosis, but proof of Englands indiscipline, especially of their defenders and goalkeeper. It was barely a month earlier that Pickford was slapped with the bone-collector moniker after taking down Liverpools Virgil van Dijk with a hideous challenge that kept the Dutchman out for the entire season.The media scrutiny, understandably, was stinging after Englands defeat, though it was an inconsequential game. Its a night locked up in my memory, Maguire once said. But its a night worth unlocking and reflecting, to ascertain the progress England, and specifically, the villains of that night, have since made.TurnaroundMaguire has not just put the past behind, but grown into an exemplary leader and unbudging rock at the back, his proneness to self-destruct a distant feature of his petulant youth. Walker has smoothened his rough edges, marrying play-making instincts with defensive steel. Trippier has become clever and craftier, sharpened his crossing and strengthened his knack to reclaim the ball. Pickford has learned to harness his aggression in more useful ways than flipping his adversaries. His reflexes were never disputed; now his temperament and ability to inspire are being lauded. His saves in the Round of 16 encounter against Germany went a long way in keeping England afloat in stages similar to where they had imploded in the past. No goalkeeper has ever kept clean sheets in five successive games at the Euros. Not Gigi Buffon, not Iker Casillas, not Olivier Kahn, not Edwin van der Saar.Two others who were wading through confidence crises the same time last year but have made incredible comebacks to the helm, Luke Shaw and John Stones, complete an unbreakable backline that has yet to concede a goal in the tournament. Stones embodies unhurried resoluteness, always at the right place at the right time; Shaw has improvised his game going forward while working on his aggression to reclaim the ball.Englands defence is fast becoming the real deal in the tournament. To not ship in a goal in 400 and sundry minutes is no mean feat  and arguably a more definitive reason behind their march to the semifinals. Whereas their frontmen have garnered attention and praise before and throughout the tournament, its Englands unflinching defensive stability that has spurred their journey into the last four and made them one of the tournament favourites.Apart from zero goals conceded, another stat illuminates their efficacy. They have made the fewest tackles in the championship, which denotes that they have not been frequently challenged into scenarios wherein they have no other option but to tackle  which is often a last-ditch effort  and characterised Englands defence in the past.A different challengeAgainst Germany, they were unflappable; against Ukraine, they were imposing. Denmark offer a different threat altogether. They are identical to the Germans, in both formation and function. Usually lining up in a 3-4-3 (they have surprised with 4-3-3 too), a lot of their creative duties are tasked on the wing-backs, the right-footed Joakim Maehle on the left, and either Daniel Wass or Jens Stryger Larsen on the right. Often, they run full pent and assume the inside forwards role while one of their centre-forwards drops deeper into the midfield, pulling one of the centre-backs into him, thus providing his team numerical superiority for a brief, but vital, moment.Mikkel Damsgaard, the replacement for Christian Eriken, has been exceptional in his ability to drag one of the defenders to follow him to the midfield. Equally important is tracking the run of midfielder Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg, a familiar face to Englands football followers. His role with the national team though is markedly different from the enforcer role he assumes for Tottenham Hotspur. Since Eriksens departure, he has taken a more attacking role, and forged a strong alliance with Thomas Delaney, with whom he interchanges roles and positions. Interchangeability of roles has been one of Denmarks strengths, which England need to keep a sharp eye on. Moreover, unlike Germany and Ukraine, goal-scoring threats lurk across the field for Denmark with specialised long-rangers ready for half a sniff to flash their boot.It could present Southgate with a formational dilemma, whether to stick with the fluid back-two plus two fullbacks or a more workmanlike back-three plus two full-backs, where England would match Denmark position for position. Englands defenders are adaptable to both, but a back-three means an attacker less, which invariably reduces their offensive threat, and if England end up losing, would risk both rebuke and ridicule. Besides, which of their attackers would they bench? Certainly not Harry Kane or Raheem Sterling. Taking out one of Jadon Sancho or Mason Mount would reduce both pace and creativity. Disrupting the central midfield pairing of Kalvin Phillips and Declan Rice would be delusional, and they could end up losing supremacy in the middle of the park.Weaving in all the factors, it would not be a stroll on the Wembley turf. But it could be the night of resurrection for Harry Maguire and friends, who were, a disorganised mess, when they encountered Denmark the last time there.",Euro 2020: England leading from the back,RICE

2021-07-08,https://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/chennai/2021/jul/08/painting-patterns-on-prized-possessions-2326940.html,"Roshne Balasubramanian ByExpress News ServiceCHENNAI: 31-year-old Deepika Velmurugans fondest childhood memory is of observing her mother and ammachi (grandmother) chalk the entrance of their home with rice flour kolams. Be it the wavy yet symmetrical sikku kolam, intricate pulli kolam, padi kolam, maa kolam or the idai pulli kolam, the duo would create tangible poetry with a combination of the arisi maavu, a matrix of dots and geometrical lines, and love, she recalls.These kolams were not only integral to auspicious ceremonies but everyday life as well. Drawing the kolams at the entrance was symbolic of inviting abundance and prosperity. My mother passed down the art of kolam-drawing to me and I picked it up. But at no point did I think it would become such a big part of my life, shares Deepika, who, in 2019, started a venture, Home2Cherish, through which she specialises in painting kolams on household decors and selling them.Finding new mediumsGrowing up, Deepika was always surrounded by antiques and brassware. Even today, every corner and shelf in my house is filled with brassware. I am a lover of all things antique, unique and traditional. In 2019, while I was cleaning my house, I found an old cradle separator (used to keep apart the ends of a cloth cradle). Being an art enthusiast, I decided to paint the separator. But I wanted to give it a different take. So, I drew a kolam on it! That was, perhaps, the moment I realised that this could be a business idea, shares the Srirangam resident, who is originally from Coimbatore.Deepika VelmuruganTwo years later, Deepikas hands are full. Orders, for these uniquely painted household dcor items, have been pouring in from different parts of the globe. Her product catalogue has grown from simple wall shelves to kolam padis (steps) of different sizes (used to hold the figurines of gods and lamps), palagais (stools), wooden plaques with motifs, wall hangings, name boards, pallanguzhi sets, and door panels. In the last two years, I have taken up and delivered over 600 orders to my clients across the globe. I have shipped my products to people in the US, the UK, Norway, France, Germany, Australia and Dubai too. In India, I have been receiving orders from every state.But a large chunk of orders have been from cities like Hyderabad and Bengaluru, she notes. Replacing the traditional rice flour with paint might have had its challenges or so one might think. But Deepika tells us that the transition was seamless. It could be because of the years of practice Ive had in drawing kolams. Over the years, I have learned over 1,000 different types of kolams. And here, I have only switched the mediums the hand movements, the measurements and the techniques remain the same. So does the requirement of being accurate, neat and focused.I havent faced any challenges in this process. I guess I love creating kolams wherever they are  the doorstep or the drawingroom! she gushes. However, she doesnt let her overfamiliarity with the kolams affect the process. She ensures to follow a well-laid plan to get the best results. I always measure the spacing of the pullis, I also sketch the kolam with a pencil first and then paint over it. One mistake can make the entire artwork look shabby and I take extra precautions to avoid it. Kolams are important to me, she says.Decor is in the detailsThe household dcor that Deepika has handpicked as her canvas are all made out of wood. The combination of kolams on wood gives it a very opulent feel. From mango, neem to teak, I work on different kinds of timber. Some people prefer teak wood, especially if its a dcor for their pujai room, so I customise it accordingly. I work in synchrony with a carpenter on the orders, she shares.Detailing and vibrancy play an important role in Deepikas artistic process. For instance, some of her dcor items are fitted with shiny brass bells and the traditional Marapachi dolls; her colour palette is often bright and arresting. I enjoy working with colours that arent dull. It breathes joy into me and since the dcor items will find new homes, I wanted to spread happiness by coating them with these lovely colours. The brass bells and Marapachi dolls too have become an interesting addition to what I offer. The idea is to take these traditional motifs into modern householdsthey can either be a reminder of our heritage and culture or even a conversation starter, she shares.While its hard to pick a favourite from Deepikas collection, ours is her version of door panels, which in many ways act as a storyboard. These are mostly three feet (in length) and two feet (in breadth) and encompass characters and stories from mythology. I have so far customised three such panels with different colours combinations and themes. The first order Id received was from a customer in Tiruchy for a panel with his favourite characters from the Tamil novel, Ponniyin Selvan. I have also traced the birth story of Lord Ganesha and the story of a royal woman from Mysuru. I have been receiving more requests, especially to paint the protagonists from Tamil epics.But its a time-consuming process. It takes anything from 10 to 15 days to make these door panels, she shares. Her Instagram page currently has over 11,600 followers. I try responding to at least 10 direct messages about orders and other enquiries every day. But when there is a paucity of time, I prioritise the orders in hand. Usually, it takes about 35 to 40 days to complete an order. All my clients have been very understanding of the time it takes to work on a product. Its heartwarming to see people not just being appreciative of the final product but also of the labour that goes into making it, she says.With multiple orders in the pipeline, Deepika also plans to introduce aruvamanais (vegetable cutter/coconut grater), traditional spoon stands and anjarai pettis (traditional masala box) to the collection. My house is located amid a farm. Our family continues to practise agriculture, raise and rear cattle and poultry, and harvest our vegetables.The kolams, brass wear and traditional household items are what Ive grown up with. Its wonderful to see the world taking notice and being interested in these elements even now, during a time where modernity has taken over. I hope to keep alive these aspects of tradition through my art, she says.The products are priced from Rs 800 onwards.

Soy and sunflower oil quotations also dropped.The cereal price index dropped 2.6% in June month-on-month, but was still up 33.8% year-on-year. Maize prices fell 5.0%, partly because of higher-than-expected yields in Argentina and improved crop conditions in the United States.International rice prices also fell in June, touching 15-month lows, as high freight costs and container shortages continued to limit export sales, FAO said.Dairy prices dipped 1.0% on a monthly basis, with all components of the index easing. Butter recorded the largest drop, hit by a rapid decline in global import demand and a slight increase in inventories, especially in Europe.The sugar index posted a 0.9% month-on-month gain, reaching its highest level since March 2017. FAO said uncertainties over the impact of unfavourable weather conditions on crop yields in Brazil, the world's largest sugar exporter, pushed prices up.The meat index rose 2.1% from May, with quotations for all meat types rising as increases in imports by some East Asian countries compensated for a slowdown in China's meat purchases.FAO said the slight fall in its estimate for world cereal production this year was principally triggered by a sharp cut to the Brazilian maize production forecast as prolonged periods of dry weather weighed on yield expectations.Global wheat production prospects also retreated this month, as dry weather in the Near East hurt yield prospects there. By contrast, the forecast for global rice output in 2021 edged up.The forecast for world cereal utilization in 2021/22 was cut by 15 million tons from the previous month to 2.810 billion tons, still 1.5% higher than in 2020/21.World cereal stocks by the close of seasons in 2021/22 are now expected to rise above their opening levels for the first time since 2017/18.

2021-07-08,https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/chandigarh/punjab-to-miss-crop-diversification-target-again-this-year-7395963/,"But even if this target is achieved, around 30-31 lakh hectares area is still expected to come under rice cultivation including 26-26.50 lakh hectares under paddy (non-Basmati). (Express Photo)DESPITE ATTEMPTS by the state government to encourage crop diversification from the water-guzzling paddy crop, it appears that this year too, Punjab will miss its target due to lack of policies and no assured price on alternative crops.Punjab has completed sowing of paddy and other Kharif crops including cotton on over 19 lakh hectares till date. The state had targeted 3.25 lakh hectares, 5.37 lakh hectares and 1.50 lakh hectares under cotton, basmati and maize crops, respectively, this year. But even if this target is achieved, around 30-31 lakh hectares area is still expected to come under rice cultivation including 26-26.50 lakh hectares under paddy (non-Basmati)  which is more than double of how much area should be under paddy  with the remaining coming under basmati, which consumes less water due to lower duration of cultivation.Cotton sowing is already over and the state could achieve 93 per cent of its fixed target as 3.04 lakh hectares was brought under cotton against against 3.25 lakh hectares  which is 21,000 hectares lesser than the target.Sowing of basmati and maize is underway. Department sources say they are not sure if these targets will also be achieved.Read | Day after Mission Punjab, SKM leaders say repeal of farm laws is their only goalIn Punjab, cotton is sown on 8 out of 23 districts. The states cotton belt comprises Fazilka, Bathinda, Muktsar, Mansa, Sangrur, Barnala, Faridkot and Moga districts.Sangrur Chief Agriculture Officer (CAO) Dr Surinder Singh, who is also in charge of Fazilaka district, said that this year, Fazilka has brought the largest area  95,913 hectares  under cotton among all 8 cotton-growing districts against 86,096 hectares (according to the Punjab revenue land record department) last year. He said that in Muktsar too, area under cotton has increased from 28,000 hectares to 40,000 hectares  an increase of 43 per cent compared to last year.Bathinda has brought 95,600 hectares against 81,000 hectares last year as per land record department where 1.52 lakh hectares would be brought under paddy and Basmati, out of which sowing on 78,000 hectares has been completed so far, said Bathinda CAO B S Sidhu.Mansa and Muktsar have sown 65,000 hectares and 40,000 hectares against 51,000 hectares and 28,000 hectares last year, respectively. Apart from this, Sangrur, and Moga districts have grown 2,652 and 650 hectares cotton against 2,300 and 309 hectares last year, respectively. Barnala and Faridkot could bring 4,185 hectares under the crop against around 4,000 hectares last year.Punjab used to have over 7.50 lakh hectares under cotton in the late 1980s and early 1990s, which reduced to between around 6 lakh hectares in the first decade of this century and then further 4-5 lakh hectares from 2011 to 2014-15. Then a white fly attack resulted in huge reduction in the area of cotton crop in the state, which led to increase area under paddy. For the past five years, post the white fly attack, area under cotton remained below 3 lakh hectares only, which is a big setback for attempts to diversify from paddy, said a senior officer in the Punjab agriculture department. Now the government has no concrete plans to give to the farmers for diversification and the area under cotton is also not getting increased at the desired pace, he added.Like paddy, which has a fixed MSP, we need to have at an par policy of assured marketing for alternative crops  basmati, cotton and maize  to divert area from paddy, said CAO, adding that over 5.50 lakh hectares in the state used to be under maize, which has now reduced by five times. Till we dont revive these area under alternative crops, diversification is not possible, he added.There are over 41 lakh hectares of cultivable area in the state, which includes around 3 lakh hectares under horticulture and remaining under agricultural crops (both Kharif and Rabi).Till the time the area under cotton, maize, basmati and other Kharif crops is not increased to 25-26 lakh hectares from its existing 11-12 lakh hectares, diversification is not possible, said a senior agriculture officer.Data sourced from the Punjab agriculture department till June 22 shows that Punjab has completed Kharif sowing on over 19 lakh hectares  which is nearly 50 per cent of the total sowing  so far. So, 15.74 lakh area has been brought under paddy, which is over 3 lakh hectares more than last year. It also implies that Punjab has already completed paddy sowing including Basmati on 51 per cent of the estimated area.Punjab agriculture department experts said that despite June 10 being the official date for paddy transplantation, several farmers had gone ahead with paddy transplantation much before it, because of which sowing could be completed in more area, otherwise the state could have far behind due to poor power supply to agricultural tubewells after June 10.",Punjab to miss crop diversification target again this year,RICE

On receiving information about barbarian atrocities on her, Childline director Benudhar Senapati and coordinator Rulina Patra visited the hospital and interacted with the victim, her mother and relatives on Wednesday.Childline officials said Bilal had married thrice and his second wife was the mother of the victim. After their divorce, the girls mother shifted to Pipili. Bilal, however, had taken custody of the child forcibly.The child was brutally assaulted everyday by the couple and chained to a verandah of their house.They even used to put her fingers in hot water and derived pleasure out of her pain. The girl was only served rice and salt and on many nights she was forced to sleep without food. We interacted with the girl and it was shocking to know the torture she had to endure for over a year while staying with her sadistic step-mother and father. The couple used to pin down the victim by standing on her abdomen and attacked her with different objects, said Senapati giving out details.Basing on a complaint filed by the girls mother, a case has been registered under sections 323, 324, 342 and 34 of IPC and section 75 of Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, said an officer of Balipatna police station.",Minor girl tortured by parents for over a year in Odisha; biological mother files complaint,RICE

""How he represents and communicates is outstanding. Congratulations Gareth, I think you are doing a great job in a difficult job.""Southgate has been the perfect leader for a squad with a social conscience, not content to let their football do the talking.Under his reign, England players have had to cope with racial abuse in Montenegro and Bulgaria.They began the tournament being booed by sections of their own fans for taking the knee as a protest against racial injustice.""The most important thing for our players is to know we are totally united on it, we are totally committed to supporting each other,"" Southgate said at the time, standing up to complaints from leading politicians about ""gesture politics"".- Tactical flexibility -Southgate's tactical nous has consistently been questioned, but he has shown a willingness to adapt to what is required to win.In Russia three years ago, the switch to a back five protected an inexperienced goalkeeper and defence.This time he has used a 4-3-3 to get an extra attacking player into the side, other than the last-16 tie against Germany, where a change of formation nullified the threat posed by wing-backs Joshua Kimmich and Robin Gosens.Saka justified his start against Denmark by setting up England's equaliser as Simon Kjaer turned the ball into his own net.But after Grealish was introduced, Sterling switched from the left wing to the right, where he won the decisive -- albeit contentious -- penalty to end England's long wait to reach a final.",How Gareth Southgate's courage and communication transformed England,RICE

His eventual appointment was greeted with little enthusiasm by the English press.The transformation has therefore been remarkable after Southgate guided England to the 2018 World Cup semi-finals and the Euro 2020 final, with Sundays showdown versus Italy the countrys most anticipated game since the 1966 World Cup final.Southgate has captured the nations hearts but also been his own man, sticking with sometimes unpopular tactics such as a double midfield pivot of Declan Rice and Kalvin Phillips, while being unmoved by public clamour to start Jack Grealish more.He has also proved adept at being a national figurehead and has encouraged his players to continue to take a stand against racial abuse while taking the knee before matches even after they were criticised by some members of the British government.I have never believed that we should just stick to football, Southgate told The Players Tribune, which provides a platform to connect directly with fans, before the tournament.Our players are role models. And, beyond the confines of the pitch, we must recognise the impact they can have on society. We must give them the confidence to stand up for their team mates and the things that matter to them as people.HUMBLE PLAYERSHis England side are not just the most successful since Alf Ramseys World Cup winners but are also a group of humble players. Many of them do not play for the countrys biggest clubs and supporters can identify with them.Southgate has managed to convey to his highly paid stars that they are not only playing football. He lets them take on social responsibility. That creates an identity, former Germany player Philipp Lahm wrote in The Guardian.Second, he has made his team believe in his plan, which is: nobody will score against us easily or quickly.Southgates style of play might not be the swashbuckling style some fans crave, but it has been highly effective.The only goal England have conceded in six games was Mikkel Damsgaards free kick in the semi-final win over Denmark and they have shut out top sides such as Germany and Croatia.The coach has also looked beyond football for inspiration.He has taken his players on a team-building exercise with the Royal Marines and incorporated contact sport Kabaddi into training sessions.Southgate and his coaching staff, meanwhile, have travelled to watch live NBA and NFL games, incorporating strategies to improve set-piece routines and game management.Explaining the interest in other sports, he said: We can try different things that work. If you keep always doing what youve always done, you get the same results.England rugby coach Eddie Jones has borrowed Southgates methods on player recovery, calling his counterpart a humble, curious, very well-educated coach. He also praised Southgates transformation from a figure of ridicule to unlikely leader.They keep showing that penalty choke of Gareth and now theyve got other shots of him, which is fantastic, he said.",How Gareth Southgate transformed England’s image and his own,RICE

On Sunday (July 11), her rocket-fuelled dreams will come true. Bandla (34) will be ""Astronaut 004"" on board Virgin Galactics space plane VSS Unity , flyingto the edge of space at about three and a half times the speed of sound along with Virgin founder Richard Branson (Astronaut 001) and four others in a fully crewed 90-minute sub-orbital flight.""I feel like I am taking a bit of India up there with me,"" she told TOI in an exclusive interaction from VG s Spaceport America in New Mexico on Friday.If all goes as planned, Bandla (34), a Trekkie, will be only the second India-born woman to go to space, after Nasa astronaut Kalpana Chawla who lost her life in the space shuttledisaster in 2003. The first Indian in space was the IAFs Rakesh Sharma, who retired as a wing commander.Bandlas flight role is ""researcher experience"". She is Virgin Galactics vice-president of government affairs and research operations. Bandlas mother is bringing one of her favourite dishes, mutton biryani, to New Mexico before her daughter takes off to over 3 lakh feet above Earth. Her all-time favourite is the Andhra yellow dal dish. When she returns, she plans to ask her mother to make it for her. ""Thats my comfort food, hot rice and yellow lentils with some ghee. I, embarrassingly so, still cant make it like her.""Born in Andhras Chirala, Bandlas parents left with her for the US when she was 4. ""The love (for space) actually started when I lived in Houston, surrounded by Nasa. I started looking at how people became astronauts and I tried to model my career after them,"" Bandla said.Wing Commander Rakesh Sharma (retd) was a big influence. ""sometimes you just need to share an identity with someone to kind of reduce mental barriers (I tell myself) thats something I could do because someone from my background and my culture has done it as well,"" Bandla, an MBA who studied aerospace, aeronautical and astronautical engineering in 2011 at Purdue University , said.""I decided I was going to space no matter what. I didnt know when it was going to happen, but I was pretty sure I would make it there some day. I credit that to my grandparents and my parents who have always encouraged me, pushed me to keep chasing my dream,"" Bandla, who dreams to make ""safely go where no tourist has gone before"" possible, said. ""I hope I go to space many times and many others go there too,"" the India-born astronaut said.Besides Branson and her, the others on the spaceflight will be chief astronaut Beth Moses (Astronaut 002) and lead operations engineer Colin Bennett (Astronaut 003). Branson, who turns 72 on July 18, will ""evaluate customer spaceflight experience"". SS Unity will be flown by pilots Dave Mackay and Michael Masucci.The mothership VSS Eve (named for Bransons mother), from which VSS Unity will drop when it reaches 50,000 feet, will be piloted by CJ Sturckow and Kelly Latimer. Unitys rocket engines will then ignite and carry Branson, Bandla and the four others higher than 50 miles (360,890 feet/110,000 metres) at about 4,300 kmph. At the top of the arc, they will experience weightlessness for about four minutes before Unity re-enters the atmosphere and begins to glide back to Earth.Sundays space mission appears to be the result of a race between two billionaires  Branson and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos  to get out there first. Both own companies that are pushing frontiers to offer space voyages to tourists. The Virgin Group founder will have made his flight nine days before Bezos when he lands on Sunday. Bezos is scheduled to lift off in his space travel company Blue Origins New Shepard on July 20, the 52nd anniversary of the first manned moon landing. Branson describes his own spaceflight as not a race but ""an incredible, wonderful coincidence that were going up in the same month"".Asked about Bezos July 20 flight, and then spaceflights by Musks SpaceX in coming months, Bandla said: ""I know this sounds fluffy but I think the more the merrier. Its actually absolutely incredible that so many companies are providing spaceflight Its not a (doing it) first thing for me. We're creating this industry. Its really going to change the way we look at not only the planet, but what we can achieve in our lifetimes.""At present, the about-90-minute commercial VG spaceflight, which will hopefully start next year, costs about $250,000.

Following training, each ration shop is expected to carry out 50 trial transactions using e-POS.However, at the Seemapuri circle, where ONORC was launched on a pilot basis in April, there have been very few transactions under the policy in the last two months. Records show there were 157 and 373 ONORC transactions in May and June, respectively. Ration distribution for July has not started yet.Using ONORC, migrants with ration cards registered in other states can collect food grains from any fair price shop in the capital. The Centre had last month questioned the approach of the Delhi government in implementing the policy, saying at least 10 lakh migrants are being deprived of the benefits of the ration card portability scheme.The disbursal of ration through e-POS devices took place across Delhi during a brief period in early 2018. On April 25, operations were suspended by the Delhi government citing irregularities such as misuse of OTPs. Since then, the Centre has been writing to the Delhi government to resume the system.There are approximately 17.77 lakh ration card holding families in Delhi. Public distribution system welfare association president Shailendra Kumar said instead of waiting till July 31, the government should roll out the policy at the earliest so that beneficiaries can avail the facility in July itself.","With SC deadline approaching, Delhi govt scrambles to implement ‘One Nation One Ration Card’",RICE

Now, it is something to be proud about  largely because of what effected the turnaround.In May, when the gated communitys management committee (MC) planned to launch a vaccination drive for the 18-to-45 age group, it took a count of the unvaccinated at the community, which brought a shocking piece of statistic to light.Arun Dhanaraj, secretary, Jains Inseli Park Owners Association reveals that it was discovered that hardly two percent of the support staff had taken the jab. As the community had 50-odd support staff, this shortfall was setting off alarm bells.The MC touched base with the local UPHC and sought a vaccination camp to be conducted at the community. All of this was happening when the second wave was at its height. With the medical apparatus being stretched to the limits, this effort did not bear fruit. Simultaneously, the MC was working on the support staff, impressing upon them the fact that total vaccination coverage is what would lead us out of the pandemic.The committee also made it clear to the staff that without vaccination, the professional association may have to be brought to an end.The MC team launched a sponsorship drive called #IPCares (Inseli Park Cares) to ensure vaccination with a private hospital.We collected 40,000 through sponsorship. Our property manager and the staff on our rolls were among those who loosened their purse strings, he says.Through the MyGate app, updates about who had signed up for the vaccination camp as well as who sponsored for it were broadcast.For the direct reports among the support staff, the Association sponsored the entire vaccination amount; for those on the payroll of a vendor, the Association met 50 p.c. of the vaccination amount, says Arun.Provision as incentiveFinally, on 12 June 2021, 161 people including residents took the vaccination at an on-site drive organised in association with a private hospital. As a goodwill gesture, the frontline staff who took the jab received a five kilo rice bag. As a majority of the MC members being employed with corporates, they successfully replicated methods followed by their organisations in planning and executing employee vaccination drives.While Kannan Hareendrakumar coordinated with the hospital authorities Swarnavalli held multiple sessions to build confidence among the staff on the importance of vaccination; and Balaji GR was incharge of the finance.The company sponsors the vaccination cost for the employee as well as their family members. Here, we get the residents to sponsor the vaccination, says Arun.The vaccination drive offered the participants a choice between Covishield and Covaxin; and the inoculation was carried out in shifts.It took the Association almost a month to have the on-site camp as Chennai was up against vaccine shortage. A minimum count of 100 people and pre-payment were prerequisites for the private hospital to carry out the vaccination at the society.Arun underlines how the vaccination drive served two purposes. One, 95 per cent of the support staff got vaccinated. From two precent to 95, the vaccination status had indeed looked up.Two, the drive also ensured a good number of residents were brought under the safety ring of vaccine-induced protection.",Padur residents take great pains to have support staff vaccinated,RICE

Last week, the environment and forest department officially declared it as the first smokeless village in Assam.According to the Union health ministry, 83% of women living in rural India die because of inhalation of smoke in the kitchen. The first smokeless village in Assam is a part of an initiative undertaken by a project called National Appropriate Mitigation Initiative (NAMA). The initiative is underway in different parts of the country to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.Bidhan Mohanta, local consultant of the Energy and Resources Institute (TERI) who is heading the smokeless movement in the village, said that they had to begin with an awareness campaign to make people understand the ill effects of smoke that is generated when they cook with firewood. Mohanta said that the project has been carried out jointly by Assam forest department, Assam Energy Development Agency (AEDA) and Assam branch of Indian Tea Association (ABITA) jointly under NAMA.According to the TERI consultant, a total 70 households in the entire village have built smokeless kitchens with this improved cooking stove. Our survey found that in traditional cooking process, a family of four persons with a cow requires 16 kg of firewood per day and 5.5 tons of firewood in a year. This improved stove leads to at least 40% less firewood consumption, said Mohanta.He informed that the chimney is provided free of cost by the forest department and the agency. The people of other villages also got excited with the new idea and requested the forest department to install it in their villages, he added.Maya Bauri, a village woman said, As a result of cooking in this oven, 8-9 kg of firewood is being consumed daily. At the same time, cooking is being done in lesser time. Once the stove becomes hot, it does not cool easily. So the foods can be kept warm for long hours.According to a senior Cachar forest official, there are plans to implement the project in 5,000 houses in 40 forest villages in the district.According to the 2011 census, 82% of Assams households or more than 48 lakh people are completely dependent on firewood.",Bishnupur is Assam’s first smokeless kitchen village,RICE

G9 is one of at least 30 gangs that authorities believe control nearly half of Port-au-Prince.""Their names range from ""5 Seconds"" -- for how long it allegedly takes them to commit a crime -- to ""400 Mawozo"" -- which roughly translated means 400 lame men.The epicenter of the recent gang violence is Martissant, a community in southern Port-au-Prince whose main road connects the capital to southern Haiti.Drivers' fear of caught in a crossfire or worse has almost paralysed commercial connections between the two regions, driving up prices, delaying the transportation of food and fuel and forcing international organisations to cancel programmes including the distribution of cash to more than 30,000 people, according to a July 1 report by the UN's Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.The agency said more than 1 million people need immediate humanitarian assistance and protection.""Newly displaced people seek refuge in shelters every day,"" it said, adding that hygiene there was ""appalling.""Authorities worry about a spike in COVID-19 cases in a country that has yet to give a single vaccine.""Escalating violence on an almost daily basis is expected to last for some time,"" the agency said in a report.The overall economy doesn't help.The UN said the cost of a basic food basket rose by 13 per cent in May compared with February, and that foreign direct investment fell by more than 70 per cent from 2018 to 2020, dropping from USD 105 million to USD 30 million.That translates into fewer jobs and increased poverty in a country where 60 per cent of the population makes less than USD 2 a day and 25 per cent less than USD 1 a day.Many also worry that the gangs could derail elections scheduled for September and November -- a contest crucial to restoring functional legislative and executive branches now largely moribund in the wake of Moise's slaying.But Haiti's elections minister, Mathias Pierre, said Saturday that those backing the gangs may want to disrupt the elections.Such periods commonly see an upsurge in violence as groups try to use fear to nullify rivals' advantages.He said that wouldn't work this time, noting that countries have held elections even during wars.""We need to organize elections....They need to back off.""Haiti's Office of the Protection of Citizens, a sort of ombudsman agency, has urged the international community to help Haiti's National Police, which it said was ""unable to respond effectively to the gangsterization of the country.""Pierre said that lack of resources and weakness of Haiti's police led the government to ask the United States and United Nations to send troops to help maintain order following Moise's killing: ""We have a responsibility to avoid chaos.""Officials say they have been trying to boost the budget and manpower of a police force that now has about 9,000 operational officers for a country of more than 11 million people.Experts say it needs at least 30,000 officers to maintain control.The government also is trying to figure out where to put those who have fled their homes due to violence, such as 43-year-old Marjorie Benoit, her husband and their three children.Benoit, who lost an arm in the earthquake, said they fled as gunfire crackled around their neighborhood.She now also has lost her home and all their belongings.""We have been uprooted,"" she said, ""and we don't know where to start.""",Gangs complicate Haiti effort to recover from President Jovenel Moïse's assassination,RICE

Frenzied from the pent up trauma of doomscrolling the fatal repercussions of the virus that had infected and confined her indoors, Rai came out of home isolation like a caged bird tasting freedom upon its release and rushed to her studio where she made art till the rice paper her canvas ran out. Within three weeks (clocking about nine hours per day), Rai created a record of 25 works that formed her first solo show titled Confluence at Gallery Espace.  Purvai Rai  These monochromatic gestures of ink and graphite on rice paper layered on archival paper experiments combine her singular involvement with abstraction and personal brush with Covid. Rai divided the new works into five stages she experienced in the pandemic; the chronology and emotions, similar but not quite, to the Five Stages of Grief  model (Denial, Anger, Bargaining, Depression and Acceptance) coined by Swiss-American psychiatrist Elisabeth Kbler-Ross.  Anatomise (initial analysis of an issue); Threshold (extent of tolerance); Reclamation (rising after the fall); Coalesce (acceptance to heal); and Final Disposition (final verdict). Rai is quick to add that the stages are interchangeable, because there is no linear trajectory to life. Just a lot of back and forth, twists and turns. For Rai, the visuals of Delhi crematoriums with Covid casualties lined in rows or stalled in serpentine queues were redolent to the funerary landscape of Varanasi ghats.  Outpouring these vivid memories as art again heightened her anxiety that caused mistakes. Grids chequered inaccurately indicate moments when the brush fell from her hand and inked a square meant to be white. Rice paper tattered in places came from excessively rubbing darkened areas to give the impression of smudged ash. But Rai learnt problem-solving during her bachelors degree from Srishti Institute for Art, Design and Technology, Bengaluru in 2017, and seamlessly incorporated these unintentional patterns into her aesthetic vocabulary.  The torn patches now point at the fragility of existence and the extra black squares, at the theme central to her art practice comprehending spatial dynamics. For instance, her experiments with textiles also look at how threads warp and weft to form fabric; leaving tiny gaps in-between; to symbolise revealing oneself, but not entirely. The previous series titled Claiming Spaces (2020) was her response to the anti- CAA movement and the first wave about citizens losing claim over public spaces and relocated to private spaces, for their safety or despite dissent.  The overlapping of these two socio-political events, of two ideas converging in one society, set the groundwork for her Confluence series. Rai also carefully leaves space for viewers interpretations. Depending on the subject lens one uses to view her work with (take, for instance, Citizenship Amendment Act, #Black- LivesMatter, pandemic or unrest in Israel) the geometric patterns and chiaroscuro, can mean a plot of land, blueprint, grave, Line of Control, partition, chess board, window, religious symbols, shadow box, photo frame, etc. Someone may see the dark spaces in my works as places where they are at and the whiter spaces as where they want to be...  What does space mean at such a time when you and everyone else around you are confined to your own spaces? Rai wonders. Works such as People in Prayer (1)  a cube between concentric circles of hatching technique that signifies circumambulating around the Kabba  require repetition, muscle memory and geometry, which demanded a space attuned to Rai whims. I need silence to create. But not pin drop silence in the closed indoor space of my studio as that is the silence of emptiness, and life is not empty.  So, I put on an OTT show I have previously watched as ambient noise to quell all the overthinking in my head. One space that has unfailingly offered security and belonging is the jute labada of her father, master lensman Raghu Rai. It would fall on Avani [her sister] and I like a tent, covering our hands and legs, and wed stick our heads out from the openings because the material would irritate our skin. Dad wears it even now in the winters, and I hug him, using the remaining end as a kambal (blanket).  ON: https://www.galleryespace. com/viewing-rooms/",Of diverse ideas and spatial dynamics,RICE

The green chilli and garlic chutney, popular among Dalit households of Maharashtra, is an integral food memory for the now 25-year-old Mumbai-based independent designer. It is the next dish that she will be illustrating in her digital series, Caste and Food.  So far, the series (available on her Instagram page, @thebigfatbao) comprises 10 artworks of traditional Dalit dishes demonstrating food as an identity and social status marker.  I didnt plan a series as such. But this idea had been mulling in my head for quite a bit, especially last year. When the pandemic began and the lockdown was enforced, I began seeing a lot of aesthetic food-related Instagram posts. It got me thinking, that none of these ever includes the food that my community and I grew up eating, says Manasi.  In describing foods such as lakuti (a curry based in rakti or coagulated blood, generally goats), bhoplyacha kees (a pumpkin preparation) and kakdiche gharge (cucumber pooris), she weaves together the personal and the political, based on both research and her own lived experiences.  Soaked poha (or flattened rice) mixed with molasses serves as a sumptuous meal  Roasted jackfruit seeds, had best during the monsoon season  I witnessed my mothers first hand experience of a battle at building a negotiated taste across two cultures in her inter-caste marriage, Manasi writes in a post dissecting the gender politics of food. She has now forgotten what her favourite crab curry tastes like.  You cant talk about Dalit food without talking about the economics of cooking, she points out. It is a calculated, optimal use of ingredients such as oil and sugar, which also depends on the kind of water we can get.  In a post about jawaari bhakris, she shares how many Dalit communities consume grains that arent water dependent. Millets, a staple in Dalit households, are now touted as superfoods, a healthier alternative to wheat.  Jawaari bhakris, an essential part of Maharashtrian food, last long and are oil-free  Whenever there wouldnt be vegetables in my house, we would just eat overcooked nachni with a bit of rice or ragi, salt and green chillies. It has a watery consistency so that the quantity is enough to feed a large number of mouths in the family, she recalls. Even now, whenever Im sick or have an upset stomach, I prefer to eat that.  Each dish she illustrates and writes about, is accompanied by a recipe she learnt from her mothers side of the family. Since the dishes have Maharashtrian names, the recipes prompt a lot of her audience to share cuisines made in similar ways in their regions.  The chaanya, or sun-dried meat, in particular, gets a lot of attention. Iterations of the long vertical ribbons of crunchy, chewy meat, which can also be had as a snack, exist as idiyirachi in Kerala and uppukandam in Tamil Nadu.  I am also trying to get in touch with my friends from other parts of the country and share their experiences and their cuisines as well, so I can document foods that my family doesnt make, she adds.  *Name changed on request, to protect privacy",Celebrating Dalit food through the prism of art,RICE
2021-07-12,https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/football/england-euro-2020-final-penalty-shootout-heartbreak-positives-7401355/,"It went Rome and somewhat expectedly, Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Bukayo Saka  23, 21 and 19 who missed penalties in the shootout  found themselves at the receiving end of racist abuse on social media. Outside Wembley, as England lost to Italy in the Euro 2020 final, some hooligans laid into Italian fans and damaged properties. But the decent fans, in the vast majority, stood up to applaud Gareth Southgates Lions.  As Harry Kane and Co did a lap of honour after the match, their appreciation for the fans was reciprocated. These players have challenged racism, fought against food poverty and made donations to the National Health Service (NHS). Unlike Memphis Depay (Netherlands forward), for example, who once turned up at a Manchester United training session in a Rolls-Royce and got ticked off by then club captain Wayne Rooney, the England lads arent bling-obsessed.  But more than the way they carry themselves off the pitch, the performance of the England players on it has made football lovers fall in love with the team. Yes, they suffered another penalty shootout heartbreak, a streak that dates back to Turin at Italia 90, but during their march to the Euros final, Southgates England broke the Germany hoodoo and won a semifinal at a major tournament after 55 years. In the final, they took the lead on two minutes and dominated the game until Italy manager Roberto Mancini made two attacking substitutions to take control of the midfield. Still, England evenly matched the best team of Euro 2020 until the final entered the lottery of a penalty shootout.  For the courage you showed.  For the way you played.  For the next generation youve inspired. Were so proud of you, lads. Keep your heads held high. pic.twitter.com/2ERlVShSCp  England (@England) July 12, 2021  Reactions  As Jose Mourinho pointed out on talkSPORT Breakfast on Monday, maybe Southgate erred in picking Rashford and Sancho for the shootout, for coming as late substitutes they had barely touched the ball, and Saka taking the fifth attempt, with the weight of an entire nation resting on his young shoulders. Then again, Mourinho also prompted the listeners to read between the lines. And because I feel Gareth is such an honest guy and is so protective of his players, I dont believe Gareth would ever say if Player A or Player B ran away or hid or said they were not ready to take one, said the two-time Champions League-winning manager. Rashford, Sancho and Saka fronted up and like former United and England centre-half Rio Ferdinand posted on Twitter, takes a form of bravery to step up in such pressurised situations.  Looking at the bigger picture, this is probably just the beginning for an England squad that was the second youngest at the Euros, with an average age of 25.27. These players are unburdened by the weight of history and after making it to the semifinals at the 2018 World Cup, have now progressed a step further. Former England centre-forward Gary Lineker said as much through a tweet after the final.  Three years ago in Moscow, England had surrendered the initiative to Croatia after being the better side in the first half. On Sunday at Wembley, they allowed Italy to dominate possession after the break. Little wonder then that Lineker has an advice for the team going forward.  I think going forward @England have to find a way of being more attack minded. Braver in possession and throwing more people forward. We have the forward talent to scare teams, at present we seem scared ourselves to release that talent, he posted.  I think going forward @England have to find a way of being more attack minded.

The orders for withdrawal of all power regulatory restrictions were issued by Chief Minister Amarinder Singh.  The power crisis was triggered by a delayed monsoon and an unprecedented surge in demand from both agricultural and domestic sectors.  Reviewing the power situation in the state after the resumption of generation at one of the three non-functional units at Talwandi Sabo Thermal plant, the CM directed the Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) to ease all power regulatory restrictions on industrial consumers across the state with immediate effect.  The chief minister was informed that the plant at Talwandi Sabo had resumed 660 MW production, improving the power situation in the state.  The installed capacity of TSPL was 1,980 MW.  The decision on the complete withdrawal of the restrictions was taken by the chief minister soon after PSPCL announced a similar but partial withdrawal in districts falling in central and border zones, said a spokesperson from the Chief Minister's Office.  The PSPCL had allowed all industries, except those using continuous power, to operate at full capacity from Monday.  However, after the chief minister's intervention, all industries across the state, including those using continuous power round the clock (textile, chemicals, and spinning mills, etc), can now operate to full capacity.  Due to an unprecedented rise in power demand, the PSPCL had, as a temporary measure, ordered restrictions on industrial consumers of the state.  It was aimed at providing continuous power supply to domestic consumers and eight hours power supply to the agriculture sector for paddy transplantation.  Continuous process industries were allowed to operate at 50 per cent of their load, the spokesperson said.  The PSPCL had not imposed any restrictions on small and medium supply industrial consumers, rice shellers, cattle feed units, call centres, mushroom farms, food processing units and other essential Industries/services from the beginning, the spokesperson further said.  Punjab has 99,834 small power industrial consumers besides 30,176 medium power consumers, upon whom no usage restriction has been levied at all despite rising demand for power across the domestic sector.  To meet the shortage, only large supply consumers (5,071 in number) which use 1000 KVA sanctioned load had been asked to use 100 KVA for 12 hours a day.  Several industrial associations of Punjab on Saturday had held a protest in Ludhiana against the power regulatory measures imposed on the industry amid power crisis in the state.  Punjab had been reeling under an unprecedented power shortage with urban and rural areas facing frequent power cuts and voltage fluctuations, amid scorching heat.  Meanwhile, Punjab's main opposition party AAP on Monday accused the Congress government of not scrapping power purchase agreements signed during the previous SAD-BJP regime, saying the present dispensation has accepted ""funds"" from three power plant companies.  Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) Punjab unit chief Bhagwant Mann alleged that the three private companies which had set up three thermal plants in the state had paid more than Rs 15 crore as ""funds"" to the Congress.  Mann in a statement here said that this was the reason why the Congress-led government was not scrapping the power purchase pacts.  The Congress government in Punjab has been under fire from the opposition for not being able to provide sufficient electricity to consumers, especially to paddy growers for sowing the crop.  Chief Minister Amarinder Singh had earlier said that his government would soon announce its legal strategy to counter ""ill-conceived"" power purchase agreements (PPAs) during the previous SAD-BJP regime.  He had also said that these PPAs, which were already under review, had put an ""atrociously unnecessary"" financial burden on the state.  The Congress before coming to power in 2017 had promised that it would renegotiate the existing PPAs to ensure low cost power.  Mann, who is a member of Parliament, also took a swipe at Congress MLA Navjot Singh Sidhu and asked him to tweet on the money allegedly accepted by the Congress from the power producing companies.  ""I appeal to Navjot Sidhu to tweet on this issue as well as he has been tweeting every day on PPAs,"" he said.  Sidhu, who has been raising issues related to electricity supply through social media, had demanded that a white paper on power purchase pacts signed during the previous SAD-BJP regime be released to make the Badals ""accountable"" to people for these ""corrupt agreements"".  Parkash Singh Badal of the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) was the chief minister then.  The cricketer-turned-politician, Sidhu, had said that the PPAs signed during the erstwhile SAD-BJP regime should be nullified through a law.  Meanwhile, the SAD urged the Punjab governor to get a corruption case involving alleged receipt of money from private plant managements by the Congress probed by the Central Bureau of Investigation.  SAD spokesman Daljit Singh Cheema alleged that it is a known fact that immediately after the PPAs were signed with the private thermal plants by the erstwhile SAD-led government, the Congress party had claimed they were wrong and even threatened to annul them.  ""But at the same time, the Congress took funds from the same private companies whom its Punjab leaders, including Sunil Jakhar and Amarinder Singh, were accusing of indulging in malpractices,"" said Cheema.",Punjab government withdraws power restrictions imposed on industry; AAP attacks Amarinder,RICE
2021-07-12,https://www.newindianexpress.com/world/2021/jul/11/gangs-complicate-haiti-effort-to-recover-from-president-jovenel--moises-assassination-2328693.html,"By Associated Press  HAITI: Gangs in Haiti have long been financed by powerful politicians and their allies -- and many feel they may be losing control of the increasingly powerful armed groups who have driven thousands of people from their homes as they battle over territory, kill civilians and raid warehouses of food.  The escalation in gang violence threatens to complicate -- and be aggravated by -- political efforts to recover from last week's brazen slaying of President Jovenel Mose.  Haiti's government is in disarray; no parliament, no president, a dispute over who is prime minister, a weak police force.  But the gangs seem more organized and powerful than ever.  While the violence has been centered in the capital of Port-au-Prince, it has affected life across Haiti, paralyzing the fragile economy, shuttering schools, overwhelming police and disrupting efforts to fight the COVID-19 pandemic.  ""The country is transformed into a vast desert where wild animals engulf us,"" said the Haitian Conference of the Religious in a recent statement decrying the spike in violent crime.  ""We are refugees and exiles in our own country.""  Gangs recently have stolen tens of thousands of bags of sugar, rice and flour as well as ransacking and burning homes homes in the capital.  That has driven thousands of people to seek shelter at churches, outdoor fields and a large gymnasium, where the government and international donors struggle to feed them and find long-term housing.  Those included dozens of disabled people who were forced to flee last month when gangs set fire to the encampment where they settled after being injured in the catastrophic 2010 earthquake.  ""I was running for my life in the camp on these crutches,"" said 44-year-old Obas Woylky, who lost a leg in the quake.  ""Bullets were flying from different directions....All I was able to see was fire in the homes.""  He was among more than 350 people crammed into a school converted into a makeshift shelter where hardly anyone wore face masks against disease.  A cigarette dangled from the mouth of an older woman who washed clothes in a large bowl while a group of children took turns flicking a single blue marble.  Nearby, a teenage girl crouched next to an elderly blind man sitting on the concrete floor and lifted a small bag of water to his mouth.  Experts say the violence is the worst they've seen since in roughly two decades -- since before the creation of a second UN peacekeeping mission in 2004.  Programme aimed at reducing gang activity and an influx of aid following the earthquake helped quell some of the problem, but once that money dried up and aid programme shut down, gangs turned to kidnappings and extortion from businesses and neighbourhoods they control.  Gangs are in part funded by powerful politicians, a practice recently denounced even by one of its reputed beneficiaries -- Jimmy Cherizier, a former police officer who heads a gang coalition known as G9 Family and Allies.  He complained that the country is being held ""hostage"" by people he did not identify: ""They reign supreme everywhere, distribute weapons to the populous quarters, playing the division card to establish their domination.""  Cherizier known as ""Barbecue,"" has been linked to several massacres and his coalition is believed to be allied with Mose's right-wing party.  He criticized those he called ""bourgeois"" and ""exploiters"", adding: ""We will use our weapons against them in favour of the Haitian people....We're ready for war! G9 is one of at least 30 gangs that authorities believe control nearly half of Port-au-Prince.""  Their names range from ""5 Seconds"" -- for how long it allegedly takes them to commit a crime -- to ""400 Mawozo"" -- which roughly translated means 400 lame men.  The epicenter of the recent gang violence is Martissant, a community in southern Port-au-Prince whose main road connects the capital to southern Haiti.  Drivers' fear of caught in a crossfire or worse has almost paralysed commercial connections between the two regions, driving up prices, delaying the transportation of food and fuel and forcing international organisations to cancel programmes including the distribution of cash to more than 30,000 people, according to a July 1 report by the UN's Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.  The agency said more than 1 million people need immediate humanitarian assistance and protection.  ""Newly displaced people seek refuge in shelters every day,"" it said, adding that hygiene there was ""appalling.""  Authorities worry about a spike in COVID-19 cases in a country that has yet to give a single vaccine.  ""Escalating violence on an almost daily basis is expected to last for some time,"" the agency said in a report.  The overall economy doesn't help.  The UN said the cost of a basic food basket rose by 13 per cent in May compared with February, and that foreign direct investment fell by more than 70 per cent from 2018 to 2020, dropping from USD 105 million to USD 30 million.  That translates into fewer jobs and increased poverty in a country where 60 per cent of the population makes less than USD 2 a day and 25 per cent less than USD 1 a day.  Many also worry that the gangs could derail elections scheduled for September and November -- a contest crucial to restoring functional legislative and executive branches now largely moribund in the wake of Moise's slaying.  But Haiti's elections minister, Mathias Pierre, said Saturday that those backing the gangs may want to disrupt the elections.  Such periods commonly see an upsurge in violence as groups try to use fear to nullify rivals' advantages.  He said that wouldn't work this time, noting that countries have held elections even during wars.  ""We need to organize elections....They need to back off.""  Haiti's Office of the Protection of Citizens, a sort of ombudsman agency, has urged the international community to help Haiti's National Police, which it said was ""unable to respond effectively to the gangsterization of the country.""  Pierre said that lack of resources and weakness of Haiti's police led the government to ask the United States and United Nations to send troops to help maintain order following Moise's killing: ""We have a responsibility to avoid chaos.""  Officials say they have been trying to boost the budget and manpower of a police force that now has about 9,000 operational officers for a country of more than 11 million people.  Experts say it needs at least 30,000 officers to maintain control.  The government also is trying to figure out where to put those who have fled their homes due to violence, such as 43-year-old Marjorie Benoit, her husband and their three children.  Benoit, who lost an arm in the earthquake, said they fled as gunfire crackled around their neighborhood.  She now also has lost her home and all their belongings.  ""We have been uprooted,"" she said, ""and we don't know where to start.""",Gangs complicate Haiti effort to recover from President Jovenel Moïse's assassination,RICE

A giant white paper was unrolled over the bench in front of them before green banana leaves arrived. A pinch of salt on the side was the first to land on the giant leaf before tasty dishes followed one after the other...  The scene was not a post-wedding feast at some Kerala town but a mock reception held in protest by the All Kerala Caterers Association (AKCA) on the premises of the Secretariat in Thiruvananthapuram earlier this month.  In another incident, a couple got married in front of a Beverage Corporation (Bevco) outlet in Kozhikode in support of the struggling caterers.  Kerala is gradually unlocking in steps but social events involving large crowds remain forbidden. The maximum participation in weddings remains capped at 20 while house warmings, baptisms and birthday parties face similar restrictions making life difficult for caterers. The fuel price hike is not helping either, they say.  Caterers' association president Varghese refuses to mince words while voicing his displeasure at the way Kerala's unlocking is moving. He questions how the government can let Bevco outlets function across the state with ill-disciplined long queues but deny permission to auditoriums and similar businesses.  ""The industry won't survive by serving 20 people a day. Many have entered this profession in the last couple of years taking bank loans on their properties, ornaments etc. A lot of middle east-returnees have also invested their life savings in catering. Most of them on the verge of complete collapse,"" Varghese said.  Short-term relief  Things were slowly picking up for the industry at the beginning of 2021. After the national lockdown and months of a blanket ban on social events, there were signs of normalcy returning as up to 100 people were allowed at weddings. Though it was still a far cry from pre-Covid days, five or six such contracts meant the caterers were able to make small profits after paying their chefs, drivers and other employees.  ALSO READ | Covid unlocking: Govt ignores expert panel, goes by officials wisdom  ""During marriage seasons, I used to get monthly contracts worth Rs 7 lakh on an average. Following national lockdown in March, we shut shop for many months and there was absolutely no income. By February 2021, we were gradually getting back and business worth Rs 3-4 lakhs was on the cards. People were scared and reluctant, but there were good signs,"" Kollam-based caterer Krishnakumar Kottathala said.  Parcel culture breaks down  Some like Krishnakumar also experimented with home delivery to stay afloat.  ""We used to pick a neighbourhood and travel with packed fried rice and biryani. It was a success as we used to sell about 200 packs per day. This helped me pay my migrant staff members on time and meet other small expenses,"" he said.  Just when Krishnakumar's tribe thought the worst was past them, the second wave arrives and things were back to square one. Fresh travel restrictions meant transport and sales weren't easy. A trend where families tried handing food packs to guests instead of hosting feasts also died down as the cases started to go up. Some caterers offered to deliver food to people at home but not many were receptive to the idea. In this, the willingness to go the extra mile couldn't help them, Varghese lamented.  There are over 2,000 registered caterers in the state and most of them are certain that they can't survive another year without work.  ""January 2021 was far better compared to August 2020 -- the month when we restarted after the first lockdown. Now, it has come down to a situation where we are ready to cook at whatever rate is offered. Negotiation is not an option anymore,"" said Thrissur-based Marvel caterers.  Solution?  According to the caterers' association, over two lakh people are dependent on this industry and many of them are forced to do menial jobs as there is hardly any work available. Then there are students and the youth who are hired on daily wages to serve at buffets. All big-scale caterers have regular employees -- mainly cooks and drivers -- who are paid by the assignment. More hands are hired if needed. However, the owners are now forced to shun the salary system and bring all their long-serving workers on a contract basis.  ""We are not in a position to give anyone salary. The workers are well aware of the situation. If we get an order or two, the entire return is divided among the workers as their situation is worse than ours. It is all about staying alive now,"" Varghese said.  ""We tried our best to continue the salary system initially. But it became impossible very soon and we were forced to switch to a pay-per-work model since May-end,"" said Paul of Marvel Caterers, who have employed six permanent staff including drivers and chefs.  AKCA feels that as long as the government insists that no more than 20 people can attend weddings and similar events, things are not going to improve for them. They have reached out with proposals to ensure work without putting Kerala in harm's way.  ""Let auditoriums open with 25% occupancy. The government can dictate the time frame, afternoon or evening, we don't mind. People are not going to hang around if asked - they can attend the feast in batches and leave and protocols won't be broken. After all, these are not Bevco outlets,"" Varghese said.  The association's state leadership decided to start agitating in front of the Secretariat and before Bevco outlets throughout the state after multiple efforts to convince the government failed. They even shot letters to all 140 MLAs of Kerala but no official response from the Cabinet has reached them yet.  Act before it's too late  AKCA leaders warn many families are on the verge of poverty and the government needs to act fast. ""This virus is here to stay. It is high time we accept it is not going anywhere and learn to exist. They need to consider us before the next relaxations are decided,"" Varghese concluded.",Cap on entry at weddings but not Bevco outlets: Struggling caterers vent ire over Kerala's unlock,RICE

Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh on Monday evening ordered immediate withdrawal of all power regulatory restrictions that were imposed on industries across the state to meet the power crisis. The crisis was triggered by a delayed rains and an unprecedented surge in demand from both agricultural and domestic sectors.  Reviewing the power situation in the state after the resumption of generation at one of the three non-functional units at Talwandi Sabo thermal plant, the CM directed the Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) to ease off all power regulatory restrictions on industrial consumers across the state with immediate effect. The CM was informed that the plant at Talwandi Sabo had resumed 660 MW production, improving the power situation in the state.  The decision on the complete withdrawal of the restrictions was taken by the Chief Minister soon after PSPCL announced a similar, but partial, withdrawal in districts falling in central and border zones. The PSPCL had allowed all industries, except those using continuous power, to operate at full capacity from Monday.  However, after the Chief Ministers intervention, all industries across the state, including those using continuous power round the clock (textile, chemicals, and spinning mills etc), can now operate to full capacity.  It may be recalled that owing to unprecedented rise in demand of power, the PSPCL had, as a temporary measure, ordered restrictions on industrial consumers of the state in order to provide continuous power supply to domestic consumers and 8 hours power supply to the agriculture sector for paddy operations.  Significantly, despite the high demand for consumption, the PSPCL had not imposed any restrictions on small and medium supply industrial consumers, rice shellers, cattle feed units, call centres, mushroom farms, food processing units and other essential industries/services from the beginning, the spokesperson said.  Punjab has 99,834 small power industrial consumers besides 30,176 medium power consumers upon whom no usage restriction has been levied at all despite rising demand for power across domestic sector. To meet up shortage, only large supply consumers (5,071 in number) which use 1000 KVA SCD (Sanctioned Contract Demand), had been asked to use 100 KVA for 12 hours a day.",Punjab CM lifts power curbs on industry,RICE

In the past six weeks other than distributing relief and compensating people the West Bengal government has been distributing salt tolerant varities of paddy to farmers.  We have distributed six such paddy varieties  1,200 metric tonnes  which are tolerant to high levels of salinity, said Sampad Ranjan Patra, Director of Agriculture.  The ingress of saline water not only kills standing crops but increases salinity of the soil and makes the cultivation of regular high-yielding varieties almost impossible for the next few years. This may result in food crisis in the region which suffers natural disasters at an increased frequency.  Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee in her various cyclone review meetings emphasised on the distribution of saline tolerant rice varieties.  Alternative varieties  The people of Sunderbans in certain patches however have been trying alternative varieties for quite some time. In Kultali, one of the backward regions there, farmers have been experimenting with several indigenous varieties and are growing Tangrashal and Dudhershor, at a considerable scale now.  Ashok Halder, farmer from Kultali, said the advent of the high-yielding varieties of paddy resulted in the loss of traditional knowledge of indigenous varieties that were more conducive to the region. Farmers like Mr. Halder said growing indigenous varieties with low input cost gives them the same margin as the high yielding varieties.  This transformation in certain communities has come about owing to the research intervention of TAPESTRY (Transformation as Praxis), a collective of social and environmental scientists, historians and NGOs that has been facilitating the farmers of the ecologically fragile region in trying alternative approaches to agriculture. Several universities in India, Britain, Norway and Japan are part of the consortium.  More resilient  So far most of the interventions in the Sunderbans were community based. It can only be transformative and yield results in future when we embrace interventions which are community led and distributed equitably, Upasona Ghosh, Lead Researcher, TAPESTRY Indian Sundarbans, said. She pointed out that because of the intervention of TAPESTRY, farmers who are facing the impact of increasing climate change events are better prepared and more resilient.  Shibaji Bose, research communication expert working with TAPESTRY, said similar efforts are being made in the Sunderbans falling under Bangladesh. The accumulation and sharing of co-produced trans-boundary local knowledge gained from long-forgotten indigenous practices will provide the much-needed fillip to transformative initiative against climate change impacts.",Sunderbans puts high hopes on salt tolerant varieties of paddy,RICE

First seen in Korea, these cakes have now made their way to India, during the pandemic. Celebrations are smaller due to restrictions. There is no use for a big cake, people are not celebrating in big gatherings. Usually, it is just the family and a couple of others, which makes lunch box cakes or Bento cakes ideal, says home baker Megha Shah over phone from Bengaluru.  Baker Bhavana Baby Maliakkal, of the Sugar Sifter in Kochi, had been wanting to bake these for a while now. She did not because she could not find boxes to package them. During lockdown, however, the surge of home deliveries made clam shell boxes (like those used for burgers) popular, and more easily available. These, coupled with her inability to ship regular-size cakes during lockdown, finally got her baking Bento cakes.  Bento [meaning lunch box] originated during the Kamukara period in 12th century Japan, when cooked and dried rice were carried together to work. Wooden, lacquered lunch boxes began to be made especially for this by the 16th Century. Eventually, schoolchildren used them too and in the early 20th Century there was a move to ban these in schools, as it was seen as a reflection of ones family wealth over others. The practice stopped when food began being provided in schools.  However, in the 1980s, it made a comeback in supermarkets. Bentos continue to be used in Japan; home-packed bento lunchboxes are only nutritionally rich but also aesthetic. From Japan, the concept spread to neighbouring countries such as Taiwan, China and South Korea.  Lunchbox cakes first made an appearance in South Korea, as cake on the go or no-share cake.  Bhavana disagrees with the no share part: I feel two people or more can eat one, though it is said that it is for one person. Depends on how much you love cake!  The rising popularity of K-Pop and K-Drama, especially during the pandemic, is also a factor behind this trend, says home baker Riya Aggarwal of Its Whipped (Bengaluru). Her clientele typically, is teens and twenty somethings. On average she gets around eight to 10 orders daily.  These cakes are pretty and colourful, usually pastels, with cute motifs, says Riya. They come in flavours such as vanilla, Biscoff, Nutella and plain chocolate. Some bakers add fillings such as salted caramel or hazelnut. Icing is either buttercream or whipped cream. Most bakers prefer buttercream because it does not have to be refrigerated as much as whipped cream icing.  The effort that goes into making them, baking time, icing, is the same as a regular-sized cake, adds Riya. For customers, however, these cakes open up more possibilities. Megha of The Sweet Escake, who has been getting steady orders for her egg-less cakes ever since she started these a month ago, explains: Rather than getting a conventional, single-flavour cake of 500 grams or a kilogram, these cakes give people the option of having two kinds, for instance. They also cost half the price, though some bentos weigh up to 450 grams and prices start at 450.  Their appeal doesnt just end there. As Bhavana puts it, The thing about bento cakes is that you can gift them for any occasion, without the formality of a larger cake. Say you want to congratulate someone, or wish someone luck, these are, literally, the right size. They are popular party favours too; I recently made these as favours for a baptism.",Don’t want to share cake? Get a Bento,RICE

A resolution passed in the meeting said most of the bamboo in the Sathyamangalam forest area had dried up and slanted.

Once it was on the ground, termites attacked the bamboo after which it served no purpose. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, tribal communities were facing a crisis and farming activities failed to help them. Also, they were unable to go for jobs to the plains. Since the forest area came under tiger reserve, the Forest Department was preventing them from collecting minor forest produce (MFP) also.  Bamboo was a grass and not a tree and was not consumed by wild animals. The Forest Right Act (FRA), 2006, allowed tribal communities to harvest green bamboo and utilise it. Hence, permission should be given to harvest the bamboo.  Mr. Mohan Kumar said as per the FRA, 2006, Community Forest Rights (CFR) was given to the tribal communities to collect MFP and Gram Sabha in the hamlets should pass a resolution of such rights and submit it to the sub-divisional level committee headed by Revenue Divisional Officer. The RDO would forward the application to the district-level committee headed by the District Collector.  Once the rights are approved, communities can collect MFP without any trouble, he added.

2021-07-17,https://indianexpress.com/article/india/raped-and-poisoned-as-grandson-watched-60-yr-old-stays-alone-far-away-from-home-7409955/,"Following the orders of the Calcutta High Court, members of the National Human Rights Commission visit areas in Birbhum district that were hit by post-poll violence. (PTI)  For more than a month now, the 60-year-old woman has been staying in one room on the first floor of a guest-house in Kolkata, stepping out only once to record her statement before a magistrate, and too scared to return home to a village in Purba Medinipur district, 130 km away.  On the night of May 4-5, two days after the West Bengal Assembly election results, according to her complaint to the police and in a petition to the apex court, alleged Trinamool men attacked her inside her home and one of them raped her, as her five-year-old grandson watched. Also forced to ingest some poison, she spent more than a month in hospital.  Back in Purba Medinipur, her family, who say they are BJP supporters, claim they are afraid to venture out, to farm their 1.5 bighas alleging calls from unknown people offering money to drop the rape case. They admit that three of the four accused are their relatives with whom they have a land dispute but also say they are supporters of the TMC.  This is one of the cases the BJP leadership has been raising as part of its allegations of widespread violence in the state following the Assembly results. An NHRC probe, ordered by the Calcutta High Court, accuses the Mamata Banerjee government of letting the violence continue unchecked. NHRC members had met the woman and her family during their tour.  Denying any link to the assault on her, the TMC has been calling the woman mentally challenged and says she is being kept hidden by the BJP to fabricate allegations against it.  The family says a medical test was done on the 60-year-old only 12 days after the incident, when she was admitted to a private hospital in Kolkata for treatment due to the poisoning. In the second week of June, with the help of the BJP, she moved the Supreme Court, seeking a probe by a Special Investigation Team.  As BJP MP Swapan Dasgupta and MLA Suvendu Adhikari raised the issue, police finally escorted her to a local court to record her statement under Section 164 of the CrPC on July 8, two months after the alleged incident. While Muhammed Usman and Subrata Kumar Das have been arrested, two others Gautam Das and Sukanta Das remain absconding.  The victims son-in-law says the day after the results, TMC men along with miscreants landed up at the homes of BJP supporters like them in their Purba Medinipur village and threatened them. They lobbed crude bombs. After this, my mother-in-laws son and his wife left the house. On May 4 midnight, the men allegedly returned, and four of them forced their way into the house. My mother-in-law was tied to a cot and then raped by Usman. They also poisoned her.  The five-year-old grandson hid under the bed to escape the men, he says, naming Gautam Das, Subrata Kumar Das and Sukanta Das as the other attackers. They are our relatives but supporters of the TMC. There is a long-standing dispute over land between them and my mother-in-law. The 60-year-old lost her husband in August 2016.  The woman was found unconscious by her neighbours who alerted the family, says her relative. Early on May 5 morning, she was taken to a primary health centre, and from there referred to a district hospital. With the help of the BJP, she was then taken to a private nursing home, followed by the hospital in Kolkata.  Says the son-in-law, Police were reluctant to lodge an FIR, registering one after a lot of persuasion. They did not even help in conducting the medical test. The report at the Kolkata hospital says the woman had injuries in her private parts and abrasion on a leg. In the alleged cause section, the report says, As alleged by patient and attendant, patient was sexually assaulted and orally given organophosphate poisoning.  Sitting at the Kolkata house, the 60-year-old says supporters of the ruling party (TMC) attacked her. I want to return home and see my son, daughters and son-in-law, especially my grandchild who always stayed with me. But who will save me if I face another attack?  The room, with an attached toilet, has one window, a bed, table, a small closet and a TV set, arranged by the BJP. The party also provides her food. It is so kind but how long can you stay like this, away from home and family? she says.  The family has seen attacks since the 2016 Assembly polls, she adds. My husband and I were beaten up by TMC workers then. He had to flee and stayed away for days They are very powerful. Even before the polls they used to terrorise people like us.  Purba Medinipur SP K Amarnath claims the delay was not on their part. The victim was admitted in hospital till June 12. After she was discharged, she didnt return to her original address. We looked for her and finally found her in Nandigram. A notice was served and her statement was recorded.  Amarnath also says that in the original FIR, the womans daughter-in-law named only one person. Later, in her statement before the magistrate, the woman took four names. Three of them are her relatives. Investigation is on.  The SP adds that they have collected medical samples from all the three hospitals where the 60-year-old was treated.  The arrested accused, Usman and Das, have been booked under Sections 448 (house trespass), 376 (rape) , 328 (causing hurt by means of poison) and 307 (attempt to murder).  The womans son-in-law, a daily wager, says, They have been threatening her son and daughter-in-law. Local TMC leaders have also told labourers and owners of tractors not to help them on their land. With the family confined to their homes, he occasionally goes over with rice and vegetables.  The son-in-law, who has also been travelling to Kolkata regularly for the court case and has run up a huge debt, says he too had received threatening calls from unknown numbers, in end May and recently, offering Rs 15 lakh and a job if they dropped the rape charge. I refused, he says.  He says they had verbally requested police for protection but it had not been provided. However, police are in regular touch with me.  Local TMC leader Partha Pratim Das admits the accused are our supporters, but alleges that the rape case is false and fabricated.  The person who has been arrested is not even a resident of the area, he lives 30 km away. Besides another accused is almost 70-year-old. Is it possible for a person like him to assault a woman? BJP is trying to malign us by such false complaints, he said.  The son-in-law claims that it was after the High Court set up the NHRC probe on June 18 that police showed urgency in the matter. They called me several times asking that my mother-in-law should record her statement. But we first wanted to record our statement before the NHRC. The team talked to my mother-in-law and also the five-year-old.  After repeated retellings of what happened that night, the boy is deadpan as he recounts how the men kept beating my grandmother and he hid underneath a bed afraid I would be hit too.  The 60-year-olds daughter asks how long things would go on like this just because they supported the BJP. We dont trust police. We want them to arrest the remaining accused. We want the safety to live without fear in our house, she says.","An Express Series: Raped and poisoned as grandson watched: 60-year-old stays alone, far away from home",RICE
2021-07-17,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/the-rasam-that-heals/article35357401.ece,"Mothers rasam had none of the usual ingredients and looked yellow. It tasted different too. The fever was soon gone but not the shock I felt on learning its secret ingredient  Memories of childhood are intrinsically linked with food for most of us. Just a whiff or a mere mention of a favourite dish can transport us to a bygone place and time. One such dish that holds sway over me is the humble yet potent rasam.  The soup-like broth with the tanginess of tamarind, tartness of tomato, sweetness of jaggery and wholesomeness of dal, along with the spice hit from homemade rasam powder, is always a winner. Though there are variations aplenty  with or without garlic, with lemon, and so on  my favourite has always been my mothers heady, red-hued broth. So, imagine my surprise when, one day, I was offered rasam like I had never known it before  without tomato, tamarind or even rasam powder, and it looked yellow.  I still remember that day vividly. I must have been around 10 years old, and was feeling a bit under the weather. My mother brought me the yellow concoction as a home remedy. I was flustered and took a tentative sip. While it tasted nothing like the usual rasam, I took an instant liking to it. I was, however, quite taken aback to learn that one of its ingredients was milk!  Family tradition  Mother explained that this rasam was called menasina saaru, and that it was something she had seen her mother and grandmother make several times. It was extolled for its medicinal benefits and was much sought after whenever family members suffered from a fever, cough or cold. Since it contains pepper, known for its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, menasina saaru calms the body, my mother said. And sure enough, my fever quickly subsided that day, I recall.  As life moved on and over-the-counter drugs took the place of everyday home cures, we forgot about menasina saaru. However, when my sister had her first child, it made an appearance again. It is excellent for postnatal mothers, said my mother, helping to keep the body warm. It was also a great way to increase immunity, she said, with the benefits being passed on from the breastfeeding mother to her newborn.  Photo: Getty Images/ iStock  Holistic wellness  But it was not until last year, when COVID-19 hit and we were all looking for traditional ways to build immunity, that I truly came to appreciate menasina saaru. While it has many ingredients that are great for holistic wellness, what drew me to the dish was its simplicity and lack of fuss  no fancy ingredients thatll make you run to your supermarket (or your smartphone). After all, now was the time to go back to the basics.  And so, I learnt the recipe from my mother and happily made it from scratch. The fact that it was well-received by all at home was an added bonus. The Indian kitchen has so many secrets waiting to be rediscovered that I feel like I have only begun scratching at the surface. More importantly, my experience reiterates that mother, and grandmother, are always right.  SUNDAY RECIPE  Menasina Saaru  Ingredients  1 tbsp black peppercorn  2 tbsp urad dal  2 tbsp rice  4 tbsp dried coconut (copra)  2-3 cups water  1 tsp turmeric powder  Salt, to taste  1/2 cup milk  1/2 tsp ghee  1 tsp mustard seed  1 tsp jeera/ cumin seeds  1/2 tsp asafoetida  1 sprig curry leaf  Method  1) On a medium flame, dry roast urad dal, black peppercorn, rice and copra separately until lightly browned. Cool and grind together coarsely.  2) Boil 2-3 cups of water (depending on how thick or thin you like your rasam) in a pot or saucepan. Add the ground mix, turmeric and salt and mix well. Once it boils, turn off the gas and add milk.  3) For the tempering, heat ghee, add mustard and cumin seeds, asafoetida and curry leaves. Let splutter and pour over the rasam. Serve as a drink or with rice.  The freelance writer and photographer from Bengaluru seeks offbeat experiences through travel.",The rasam that heals,RICE

2021-07-23,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/indian-fermented-rice-dishes-restaurants/article35405177.ece,"Masterchef Australia is late to the party. Indias fermented rice dishes, from Bengals panta bhat to Keralas pazhamkanji, have long been moving up the culinary ladder from farms to restaurants, as gourmets discover their many benefits  Panta bhat, trending after it was featured in Masterchef Australia by contestant Kishwar Chowdhury, is known by many names in India  poita bhat (Assamese), pakhala bhat (Odiya), pazhaya sadam (Tamil), geel bhat (Bihar), chaddannam (Telugu) and pazhamkanji (Malayalam). Call it what you will, but fermented rice is comfort food for many in India and in Southeast Asia. Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam have their own versions.  Author and academic Krishnendhu Ray, associate professor of Food Studies at New York University, says there are three reasons for the popularity of fermented food in general and rice in particular. One, the idea of a national cuisine is pass. We know that there are regional and sub-regional cuisines. Two, the 21st Century has seen the death of the taste for cold and sweet in the American century of taste. Realising the ill-effect of sodas and colas, people are going for tepid and sour foods. Three, studies have shown that gut health is closely related to the immune system, health, and mental health. Earlier, the ambition was to boil and cook everything to kill all microbes. But now, we know that certain microbes are necessary for our health. Fermented food is rich in microbes, yeast, and mould, all necessary for our health.  Pazhamkanji | Photo Credit: S Mahinsha  Krishnendu says that, like music and textiles, tastes in food can also travel from the subaltern to the mainstream and he attributes the popularity of fermented rice gruel to that movement.  Fermented rice gruel, he says, has existed for centuries in one form or the other in every place where rice is grown, especially in the era before refrigeration. But it was the food of the common man, not of royalty. That was one of the reasons why it was not served in restaurants. Now, fermented food has caught the attention of gourmets but we have to wait and see if it is a fad and how long it lasts, says Krishnendu.  Fermented for fine dining  As the locavore movement gains in strength, regional staples like fermented rice finds a place in the sun  and in upscale restaurants around India. Regi Mathew, chef and culinary director of Chennai-based Kappa Chakka Kandhari, has been serving pazhamkanji and cherupayar kanji in his restaurant since 2018. Diners were pleasantly surprised when they saw it on the menu for lunch. Unless we serve these ethnic foods, they will vanish from our plates. Nutritious and packed with probiotics, pazhamkanji used to be a staple in households in Kerala, says Regi. He speaks nostalgically of sharing the pazhamkanji that farm labourers working their land in Kottayam used to bring for lunch. Pazhamkanji reminds me of vacations, home and childhood, he adds.  Agreeing with his sentiments, chef Suresh Pillai, culinary director of Raviz Hotels, gushes about pazhamkanji. Although it is not on the formal menu of Raviz, he says there are many expatriates who ask for it. We prepare it for them. Cooked rice is soaked overnight in water with shallots and birds eye chilli. In the morning, it is served with chutney, pickle, fish curry or fish fry (sun-dried fish fry), curd, pappadam and, occasionally, kappa (tapioca), he says.  The sides served with the fermented rice vary from place to place. Even the number of hours it is soaked can vary. When it is soaked for more than 48 hours, the cooked rice releases a small amount of alcohol, which has a kick.  According to Regi, pazhamkanji has a cooling effect on the body and that is why farm labourers used to prefer it to cooked rice.  Pazhamkanji with fish fry and fish curry | Photo Credit: Sreejith R Kumar  Combined with a variety of sides, pazhamkanji is also now offered by small dedicated eateries, where it is often the only dish on the menu. Moopilans, perhaps the first in Thiruvananthapuram to serve only pazhamkanji, began five years ago. For three-four months, there were queues at our place. Seeing its popularity, other joints also began serving it, says Vijayakumari V, who has reopened her small eatery after the lockdown. Now, only parcels are being given.  In Orissa and West Bengal, it is usually served with potato and fried fish. Regi says that in Kerala, the fish curry served it with the pazhamkanji was also usually the previous days fish curry. Our older generation never wasted food. Pazhamkanji was a way of making the best of the what was in the house when there were no refrigerators. Soaking the rice overnight broke down the micro-nutrients in the rice, making it easily digestible, says Regi.  In Malayalam, kanji is often used as a derogatory term to refer to someone who is not quick-witted or in with the times. From the looks of it, this will soon have to be changed to keep with the times as kanji takes centre-stage in the culinary world.",‘Poita bhat’ or ‘pazhamkanji’: India’s fermented rice finds its place under the sun,RICE

2021-07-25,https://indianexpress.com/article/lifestyle/health/protein-week-food-source-healthy-lifestyle-quality-of-life-7421230/,"Ensure that all your meals have a source of good quality protein in reasonable quantities and combinations. (Source: pixabay)  By Neelanjana Singh  Protein Week 2021: Have you often wondered what factors impact our quality of life? The WHO (World Health Organization) definition of QoL encompasses four important and interconnected domains of healthphysical, psychological, environmental and social. It is fascinating to experience how the company of a loved one or a scenic location with clean air can uplift the mood and enhance well-being.  Quality of Life (QoL) can hardly be measured by a diagnostic test, like a blood test or a CT Scan. Although precise in their assessment of physical health, these tests do not provide a complete picture of our well-being.  Before the onset of the pandemic, health concerns like those of anxiety and depression were largely neglected. Since Covid, these issues have been seen in large segments of the population, therefore compelling our attention towards more than just the physical aspect of health. A person with a healthy BMI who is plagued with loneliness and low self-esteem is not a healthy person.  Also Read | Heres why tofu is emerging as a good protein alternative  Increased physical activity has been indicated as one of the ways to enhance QoL. Physical activity brings about changes in neurotransmitters in the brain that are associated with depression, anxiety and sleep disturbances, lowering the incidence of these concerns.  Staying physically active is something that most of us struggle with. However, it is important to remember that as long as we make a good start, the rigour and routine of physical activity is self-regenerative. Building strong skeletal muscle tissue contributes to physical strength and performance. A prerequisite for increased muscle tissue is to get an adequate supply of high-quality protein. A 2017 Indian survey found that nine out of 10 Indians consume a diet deficient in protein. It is not a surprising revelation given the fact that we are an established carb-loving country, with rice, roti and paratha dominating our plates and palates.  Protein plays several important roles to improve our QoL.  Boosts immunity: The amino acids in proteins are responsible for the bodys defense systems, antibodies, enzymes and hormones. The essential amino acids that play a key role in immunity are arginine, glutamine and branched chain amino acids (BCAA). Immune cells that are supported by protein include leucocytes, cytokines and phagocytes, all of which keep the body disease-free.  Preserves & builds muscle mass: Building muscle mass is a process that begins early in life. In adulthood, adequate and good quality protein intake maintains the muscle mass that we gradually begin to lose with age. Proteins preserve muscle mass during rest and increase muscle mass when we exercise.  Improves mood: Physical exercise is perhaps the most potent and underutilised antidepressant that is also free of cost. To exercise regularly, an adequate intake of protein to build and preserve muscle mass is a must.  Fights weakness and fatigue: Low protein diets are often the cause of easy fatigability and weak muscles leading to aches and pains, and slow recovery from injury.  Helps manage weight: Adequate protein intake gives you a sense of satiety, which prevents overeating and thus the risk of obesity. Excess weight is an impediment to exercise, and in order to lose weight, one must exercise. Moreover, coronavirus is particularly harsh to those carrying excess weight, especially in the younger age group, increasing the risk of developing complications and disability.  Eating adequate protein is a must on many counts. But, how much protein is enough for an adult?  Measure your weight in kgs and multiply by 0.8, if you are moderately active. For example, if you weigh 60 kgs, you need 60 x 0.8g (48g) of protein in a day. The requirement of protein changes with illness, during recovery from disease, intense workouts, pregnancy and breastfeeding.  Sources of protein  How does one get adequate proteins in the diet? Simply ensure that all your meals have a source of good quality protein in reasonable quantities and combinations.  Dairy and its products, soy, egg, chicken, fish, all dals, legumes, nuts and seeds are the dietary sources of protein. While you dont have to give up eating your favourite carbs, there is certainly a need to alter the portions and proportions that you may be used to. Instead of eating a big portion of rice with a small portion of dal, reverse the ratio by eating more dal and less rice.  Snacks also need our attention. It has been reported that there has been a 66% increase in snacking, with midnight snacking becoming more common with a higher consumption of processed, unhealthy foods. Boredom and stress have led to an increase in emotional eating, especially that of comfort foods that are rich in sugar and fat.  Protein-rich foods, such as sprouted legume chaat, chana cutlets, soy kabab, tofu or cottage cheese tikka, smoothies with nuts and seeds, and egg preparations, can also make for excellent snack options.

2021-07-26,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/lessons-from-indias-food-security-response/article35529291.ece,"Government measures to tackle the food crisis during the COVID-19 pandemic were effective  With a reduction in COVID-19 infections as the second wave weakens in India, it is important to focus on the pandemics disruptive impact on the food security and livelihoods of the poor and marginalised.  The deadly virus has been around for two years and it is not clear as to how and when it will end. However, we do have enough in terms of a hindsight analysis of policies and interventions that promise food and livelihood security, along with the strengthening of health support, for millions facing the wrath of the pandemic.  It is imperative to also note an alarming escalation in the global hunger that is unfolding right now. There was a dramatic worsening of world hunger in 2020, much of it likely related to the fallout of COVID-19. While the pandemics impact has yet to be fully mapped, a multi-agency report, The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World, estimates that around a tenth of the global population  up to 81.1 crore persons  were undernourished last year.  India has made enormous progress in food production over the years, with an inspiring journey towards self-sufficiency in food production marked by the Green Revolution. In 2020, India produced over 30 crore tonnes of cereals and had built up a food stock of 10 crore tonnes. The country has registered record harvests over the last few years. India exported a record 1.98 crore tonnes of rice and wheat in FY21.  Pivoting safety nets  Coming to the impact of COVID-19s fallout, vulnerable and marginalised families in India continued to be buffered against the food crisis by its robust Targeted Public Distribution System (TPDS).  Also Read Oxfam: 11 people die of hunger each minute around the globe  Key measures initiated by the Union government included allowing the States to lift their allocations for six months in one go, in anticipation of a surge in demand for foodgrains through the public distribution system. As data shows, there was an unprecedented spike in the uptake of subsidised and free foodgrains during the lockdown. The public distribution system became a lifeline for millions hit by the pandemic.  Increase entitlements  A dynamic analysis of the food security scenario and feedback from different stakeholders allowed the Government of India to increase entitlements given to National Food Safety Act (NFSA) beneficiaries in 2020. For instance, under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY), 81.3 crore NFSA beneficiaries received an additional 5 kg of foodgrains per person per month and 1 kg of pulses per family per month, free of cost, for eight months from April to November 2020. Under the Atmanirbhar Bharat package, 8 crore migrants were provided 5 kg of foodgrains per month, free of cost.  The government also allowed NGOs/civil society organisations to buy rice and wheat at subsidised prices directly from nearby Food Corporation of India (FCI) warehouses. Rice was sold at 22 per kg (market price is 35 per kg) and wheat at 21 per kg (market price is 27 per kg) last year.  Also Read A bullet train to hunger  The PMGKAY was introduced in 2020 for eight months to provide relief to 80 crore beneficiaries covered under NFSA from COVID-induced economic hardships. The scheme was reintroduced this year for the third phase implementation for two months till June, and later extended till November under the fourth phase.  During the third phase of PMGKAY, about 89% of the allocated foodgrains were distributed to beneficiaries. The distribution reached 94% in May. Implemented for eight months last year and for seven months this year, the PMGKAY outlay will add up to a total expenditure of 2,28,000 crore over 15 months.  Addressing challenges  The COVID-19 pandemic has once again drawn attention to addressing the aspects of access and portability of food entitlements. It is critical to leave no one behind in times such as these and crucial for states to find solutions so that no one goes hungry.  Also Read Tackling rural economic distress  Ensuring that food support focuses on at-risk groups, including persons with disabilities, the elderly, single women-led households, transgender persons, HIV-affected persons, displaced persons, refugees and orphan children, is at the heart of Leave No One Behind.  The scale of Indias public food distribution systems is immense and has gone through constant navigation and improvement, which is commendable. But more needs to still be done to improve access and inclusion among the missing vulnerable population.  Way ahead  First, the introduction of the One Nation One Ration Card (ONORC) scheme is an innovation that can be a game changer, allowing beneficiaries to access their food entitlements from anywhere in the country. This is especially important for a country like India with a massive mobile population and migration between States. The scheme takes the massive digitisation of the supply chain, distribution and access to the next step, ensuring anyone benefits from anywhere in India.  Second, climate change will continue to affect agriculture and food security, and the impact on the poor and vulnerable can be devastating. Massive efforts are needed towards programmes that focus on building resilient agriculture that is adaptive to changing weather and needs through the introduction of newer varieties of crops, efficient irrigation systems, and the promotion of crops as per the agro-climate zones.  Also read | More evidence of Indias food insecurity  Thirdly, a third of all food produced is wasted. There should be enhanced efforts to prevent losses. Lost or wasted energy used for food production accounts for about 10% of the worlds total energy consumption, and annual greenhouse gas emissions associated with food losses and food waste reaches to around 3.5 gigatonnes of the CO2 equivalent.  Finally, 2021 offers a unique opportunity for advancing food security and nutrition through transforming food systems with the upcoming UN Food Systems Summit, the Nutrition for Growth Summit and the COP26 on climate change. The outcomes of these events will certainly shape the actions of the second half of the UN Decade of Action on Nutrition.

(Express Archive)  PUNJAB HAS had light to moderate showers every alternate day for more than a week now, but 17 of its districts are still recording lesser rain than required. All these districts grow the water-guzzling rice crop on over 21 lakh hectares, which is around 67.7 per cent of the total area of the state under rice crop.  On Monday, 17 districts of the state (77 per cent) witnessed deficit rain and only five recorded surplus rain. Around 9 lakh hectares are under rice in these five districts.  In July, the state normally should have had 176 mm rain, and till July 26, it should have received at least 146 mm. But till Monday, it had recorded 142 mm.  The cumulative rain from June 1 to July 26 of this rainy season was recorded at 154.1 mm against the normal 196 mm  a 21 per cent deficit.

It indicated the need to have appropriate meals with millets for diabetic and pre-diabetics as well as for non-diabetics as a preventive approach to keep the disease at bay.  Based on research done in 11 countries, the study published in Frontiers in Nutrition shows that diabetics who consumed millets as part of their daily diet saw their blood glucose levels drop 12-15 per cent (fasting and post-meal), and blood glucose levels declined from diabetes to pre-diabetes levels. The HbA1c (blood glucose bound to hemoglobin) levels lowered on an average of 17 per cent in pre-diabetic individuals, and the levels went from pre-diabetic to normal status. The findings affirm that eating millets can lead to a better glycemic response, the release said.

This indicates potential of millet-based diets in managing #diabetes.https://t.co/9k2zT1xBi3#UNFSS2021 pic.twitter.com/BlAeddjKTk  ICRISAT (@ICRISAT) July 29, 2021  The study led by the Smart Food initiative of the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT), included the National Institute of Nutrition (NIN), Hyderabad; University of Reading in the UK; and other institutions, a press release from ICRISAT said on Thursday.  The authors reviewed 80 published studies of which 65 were eligible for a meta-analysis involving about 1,000 human subjects, making this analysis the largest systematic review on the topic till date, it said. No one knew there were so many scientific studies undertaken on millets effect on diabetes.  These benefits were often contested, and this systematic review of the studies published in scientific journals has proven that millets keep blood glucose levels in check, reducing the risk of diabetes, and has shown just how well these smart foods do it, said S Anitha, the lead author of the study and a senior nutrition scientist at ICRISAT.  Diabetes contributed to high disease burden from 1990-2016 in the country. Diabetes-related health expenditure was over USD 7 million. There is no easy solution, and it requires a change in lifestyle, and diet is an important part of this, the release quoted Hemalatha, Director, National Institute of Nutrition (NIN), as saying. This study provides one part of the solution useful for individuals and governments. How we use this and implement it into programs needs careful planning, she said.  According to the International Diabetes Association, diabetes is increasing in all regions of the world. India, China and the USA have the highest numbers of people with diabetes. It had been said that Africa would see a rise of 143 per cent from 2019 to 2045, Middle-East and North Africa 96 per cent and South-East Asia 74 per cent, according to the release.  The authors called for diversification of staple food with millets to keep diabetes in check, especially across Asia and Africa, it said.  Strengthening the case for returning millets as staple diet, the study found that millets have a low average glycemic index (GI) of 52.7, about 30 per cent lower glycemic index (GI) than milled rice and refined wheat, and about 14-37 GI points lower compared to maize, it said. All 11 types of millets studied were either low (<55) or medium GI (55-69), GI being an indicator of how much and how soon a food increases blood sugar-level.  Also read | Heres how you can bring millets closer to your comfort meals  The review concluded that even after boiling, baking and steaming (most common ways of cooking grains) millets had lower GI than rice, wheat and maize, the release said.  The global health crisis of undernutrition and over-nutrition co-existing is a sign that our food systems need fixing. Greater diversity both on-farm and on-plate is the key to transforming food systems, said Jacqueline Hughes, Director-General, ICRISAT. On-farm diversity is a risk mitigating strategy for farmers in the face of climate change while on-plate diversity helps counter lifestyle diseases such as diabetes. Millets are part of the solution to mitigate the challenges associated with malnutrition, human health, natural resource degradation, and climate change, the Director-General said.  Trans-disciplinary research involving multiple stakeholders is required to create resilient, sustainable and nutritious food systems, Hughes said.  The study is first in a series that has been worked on for the last four years as a part of the Smart Food initiative led by ICRISAT that would be progressively released in 2021. It includes systematic reviews with meta-analyses of the impacts of millets on diabetes, anaemia and iron requirements, cholesterol and cardiovascular diseases and calcium deficiencies as well as a review on zinc levels, said Joanna Kane-Potaka, a co-author from ICRISAT and Executive Director of the Smart Food initiative. As part of this, ICRISAT and the Institute for Food Nutrition and Health at the University of Reading have formed a strategic partnership to research and promote the Smart Food vision of making our diets healthier, more sustainable on the environment and good for those who produce it, she said.",Millets-based diet can help manage blood glucose levels: study,RICE

Really? she exclaimed, Ordinary poita bhat?  The Melbourne-born chef of Bangladeshi origin, Kishwar Chowdhury, may not have won the recently concluded MasterChef Australia contest, but by wowing the judges with her panta bhat, she has brought into the limelight a humble dish thats consumed in several parts of India and is called by as many names. For Bengalis, its panta bhat, for Odiyas, pakhala bhat, for Malayalis, vella choru or pazham kanji, for Tamils, pazhaya soru. Chowdhury gave her own twist to this dish, presenting it as Smoked Rice Water.  But in each of its versions, the essence of the dish remains the same: leftover rice, fermented overnight in water. Its versatility lies in the way it can take on a range of accompaniments or stand on its own.  Ideal for summer  My first introduction to this dish was at the age of 10 or 11 on a hot and humid summer day. As I waited for my parents to pick me up from school, my best friend invited me for a quick snack at her home, a stones throw away. No harm, I thought and followed her. We took off our shoes at the door and as she ran in to call her mom, I noticed her grandmother slurping what looked like watery gruel from a bowl. There it was, poita bhat.  Curious, I asked my friend if we could have some of that. And I can never forget that taste. With a dash of mustard oil and lime juice, it was one of the best summer meals I have ever had. We gorged on the accompaniments too  aloo pitika (mashed potato) and bengena bhoja (eggplant fritters), which are popular side dishes served with poita bhat in Assam  and slurped our way to the end.  The next time I relished it as much was years later, when I was on an assignment in Odisha. A field worker invited me to an impromptu lunch and as we sat down to feast on an array of dishes, he pulled out a bowl of what looked like poita bhat. Pakhala bhat, he said, In the hot summer months, this is my staple meal. Needless to say, he had to forego much of his pakhala bhat as I slurped it up with green chillies, onion and lime.  Health food  Light on the stomach, cooling and nutritious, poita bhats origins are as simple as the dish. In most States where rice is a staple, soaking the leftover portion in water overnight and consuming it the next morning made sense at a time when refrigerators were not common. This ensured there was no wastage. Left to ferment overnight, the gruelly rice has a high starch content, which sustained farmers and manual labourers for a long period of time after they ate it for breakfast. As we know today, its high Vitamin B12 and probiotic content makes it good for health. Poita bhat was also easy to prepare, standing ready even before the kitchen fire was started for the days meals.

She shared a picture of her Amsterdam-based friends lunch the other day. On the table was a plate of colourful veggies and fritters, nestling close to a bowl of pakhala bhat.  RECIPE  Poita bhat  Ingredients  1 cup of cooked rice soaked in  2 cups of water overnight   cup buttermilk or  cup curd  2 tbsp onion, chopped  2 green chillies, chopped  Salt to taste  Method  Let the cooked rice ferment in water overnight.  Next morning, pour the rice gruel in a bowl and add the buttermilk or curd. Mix well.  Add the chopped onion, chopped chillies and salt.  A dash of mustard oil and a wedge of lemon, and your poita bhat is ready to be served.

2021-08-01,https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/ludhiana/punjab-brings-5-62-lakh-hectares-under-dsr-its-highest-ever-7432636/,"Punjab has brought 5.62 lakh hectares area under direct seeding of rice (DSR) this year which is highest ever in the state till date and it is an increase of 62,000 hectares from last years DSR area. All districts have recorded between 10 per cent to 46 per cent DSR area of total rice cultivation, respectively, except Ludhiana district where only 7.4 per cent area could be brought under DSR.  The acreage estimates for DSR and puddled rice were collected by using satellite data that is collected by Punjab Remote Sensing Centre (PRSC), Ludhiana.  PRSC had started collecting data through satellite last year which is based on initial crop and water ponding signatures in agriculture fields.  While rice sowing, mainly Basmati, is still on in the state, but paddy (non-Basmati) sowing was almost over by the second week of the July. PRCS has taken July 11 as cut-off date for recording DSR area, said agri experts. This date was the same last year too.  Experts believe that while Punjab has failed to decrease area under paddy, DSR is still one option to help save ground water as it requires 15 to 25 per cent less irrigation.  DSR saves water as it requires first irrigation after 21 days of the sowing and also it does not need a puddled field, which is again a huge saving of water. In traditional method, the young seedlings are transplanted in water filed water and irrigation is required every third day. Director Punjab Agriculture Department Dr S S Sidhu said that there were some limitations due to cloud/intermittent rains over the state in optical and microwave satellite images. There may be little variation in area under DSR in some of the districts which will be modified/rectified with further monitoring and mapping of crops, he added.  Last year till July 11, DSR area was 5.01 lakh hectares (around 12.38 lakh acres), while this year till July 11, it touched 5.62 lakh hectares (13.88 lakh acres).  Till July 11, Punjab had sown rice (majority of non-basmati area) on 27.29 lakh hectares out of which 5.62 lakh hectares and 21.67 lakh hectares, respectively, was DSR and puddled rice which means DSR occupies only 20.5 per cent area.  Experts said that most of the DSR area should be the non-Basmati rice only because less number of farmers go for DSR in Basmati, which is sown in rainy season when the conducive DSR conditions may not be available to the farmers due to frequent rains.  The satellite data shows that Bathinda, which has brought the highest area under DSR at 47,290 hectares (1.16 lakh acres), is also the district that has brought around 36.5 per cent of the total rice area under DSR.  A total 1.29 lakh hectares area was brought under rice cultivation in the district till July 11 out of which 82,000 hectares was puddled rice area. Bathinda was at number two last year with 43,950 hectares DSR area.  Mukatsar, which was at number one last year with 46,830 hectares DSR area, is at the second number where 45,340 hecatres (1.12 lakh acres) has been brought under DSR of the total 1.25 lakh hectares rice area, which also comes to 36.3 per cent of the total rice area in the district this year.  In Fazilka, DSR area is calculated at 44,002 hectares (1.08 acres) of the total 95,492 hectares rice area which comes to 46 per cent of the total rice area of the district which is actually the highest area percentage wise in any district of the state.Fazilka has recorded an increase of 18,000 hectares under DSR this year against 26,300 hectares last year.  Patialas DSR area has been recorded at 34, 240 hectares which is at number four position. Percentage wise it comes to 15 per cent because in Patiala 2.25 lakh hectares area was under rice cultivation till July 11.Ferozepur has brought 34,110 hectares of the total 1.60 lakh hectares, which is 21.3 per cent of the total rice area. In Gurdaspur, 33,290 hectares (20.4 per cent) of the total 1.63 lakh hectares of rice was sown using DSR technique.  In Amritsar, 32,980 hectares is under DSR (18.7 per cent) of total 1,75,460 hectares rice area. Barnala has brought 30,660 hectares under DSR (29.7 per cent) of the total 1.03 lakh hectares, whereas Faridkot has 29790 hectares of DSR area (30.3 per cent) of the total 98,120 hectares.  Sangrur has brought 28,220 hectares (11.8 per cent) of the total 2.38 lakh hectares rice area. Moga has cultivated rice with DSR technique on 27,130 hectares (16 per cent) of the total 1.68 lakh hectares rice area, and Jalandhar has grown 26,120 hectares with DSR (21.4 per cent) out of a total l.48 lakh rice area.  In Kapurthala, 25,960 hectares (29.6 per cent) is under DSR out of the total 96,500 hectares rice area. Tarn Taran district has grown 24,810 hectares with DSR (14.6 per cent), Mansa district has 22,530 hectares (24.8 per cent), Hoshiarpur 21,570 hectares (29 per cent), and Ludhiana has brought 18,070 hectares (7.4 per cent) under DSR.  The figure for Nawanshahr is 10,190 hectares, 19 per cent of districts total rice area, whereas remaining four districts  Fatehgarh sahib, Rupnagar, Pathankot and Mohali  have brought 8,300 hectares, 7,820 hectares, 5,000 hectares and 4,670 hectares, respectively under DSR.  Punjab Agriculture Department had set a target of bringing one million hectares area under DSR this year but it could meet 56 per cent of the total target.  Still it is a huge area because this time migrant labourers were available to farmers in plenty with much less labour charges than the last year and despite that we could bring the highest ever area under DSR this year, said Director SS Sidhu.",Punjab brings 5.62 lakh hectares under DSR — its highest ever,RICE

This really provides the possibility of engineering plants to potentially improve the ecosystem as global warming proceeds.  This is a brand new type of approach, one that could be different from GMO and CRISPR gene editing; this technique allows us to flip a switch in the plants at an early point in development, which continues to affect the plants food production even after we remove the switch, he said. It seems that plants already have this layer of regulation, and all we did is tap into it. So the next step would be to discover how to do it using the plants existing genetics.

Lifestyle intervention can only do as much and patients always require effective medical therapies to optimise risk factor control in diabetes, said Dr Vishal Gupta, director of VG-Advantage diabetes thyroid and endocrine Centre, Mumbai, and consultant endocrinologist at Breach Candy Hospital and Research Centre, Mumbai.  Monitor daily calorie intake  For the normal weighted diabetic with BMI 18-23kg/m2, the aim is to maintain the body weight by consulting an average of 1,2001,500 kcal per day for women, and 1,5001,800 kcal for men. In order to lose weight, one must consume a 500750 kcal/day energy deficit dietary plan, said Dr Gupta, who is also the author of Beyond Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.  Monitor daily carbohydrate consumption  Focus on the intake of carbohydrates from vegetables, legumes, fruits, dairy products, and whole grains. Strongly discourage the diabetic patient or minimise the consumption of refined carbohydrates such as white flour, white rice, low-fat or non-fat food products with high amounts of refined grains, table sugar and sugar-sweetened beverages like soft drinks, he mentioned.  The WHO recommends that sugar intake be reduced to 5 per cent of the total calorie intake which is 25 grams of sugar per day for an average-sized person. It is seen that the average adult in India consumes approximately 58 grams of sugar daily.  Also Read | How many servings of fruits a day can lower risk of type 2 diabetes?

(Source:Pixabay)  Monitor the quality of carbohydrate consumed  Glycemic index (GI) refers to the quantitative assessment of the post-meal blood glucose response of certain foods, which is expressed as a percentage. So higher the glycemic index, greater is its ability to raise the patients blood glucose.  Foods with a GI score over 70 are referred to as high glycemic, which is fast release of carbohydrate and higher post-meal blood glucose response. Foods with a GI score of 55 or less are referred to as low glycemic which help in slow release of carbohydrate and lower post-meal blood response. For example, white rice has a GI close to 93 as do commonly consumed biscuits versus brown rice which has a GI of 50.

(source: Pixabay) Monitor the quality of carbohydrates consumed. (source: Pixabay)  Consume carbohydrate along with fibre and protein  Dietary fibers can be described as any non-digestible carbohydrates that cannot be broken down in the upper food tract, thus helping reduce the GI of foods.  For examples, soluble dietary fibre in fruits, berries, certain vegetables i.e., pectins from guava, carrots; beans, lentils; nuts; germ fraction from oat and barley products, and psyllium. Insoluble dietary fibre include whole grain and bran products; skins of fruit; cucumbers, tomatoes; hull of grains; brown rice; legumes; nuts, almonds. High dietary fibre intake has shown to result in a 2030 per cent decrease in future risk of type 2 diabetes and lower the post-meal glucose excursion, said Dr Gupta.  Protein ingestion has appeared to stimulate insulin secretion and cause a decrease in post-meal glycemic response. When dietary protein (e.g. leucine) is ingested along with glucose, it helps in reducing the post-meal glycemic response by 50 per cent.  Similarly, the co-ingestion of soya protein along with rice has shown to reduce the post-meal blood glucose response. With regards to protein intake in diabetic patients without diabetic kidney, the average daily protein intake can be up to 11.5 gm/kg bodyweight per day or 1520 per cent of the total calories. Whereas, for those with diabetic kidney disease, the aim should be to restrict the daily allowance of protein to 0.8 gm/kg bodyweight per day.  Also Read | Healthy lifestyle: Five yoga asanas that can help diabetes patients  Monitor the method of cooking  Dr Gupta explained that potatoes generally have one of the highest GI values of any food. Baking a potato may offer an advantage over boiling as it involves less cooking of its internal part, thereby helping to reduce the digestibility of potato.  The average GI of canned potatoes is almost 36 per cent less as the preservation method that involves placing foods in jars or similar containers and heating them to a temperature that destroys microorganisms which spoils the food. Canning of starch-rich foods such as potatoes could decrease the GI. Cooling can also lower the GI of the food as it helps reform the crystalline structure of the carbohydrate known as Retrogradation thereby reducing the GI, he said.  For example, pasta cooked hot and fresh has a high GI but upon refrigeration or cooling and consuming the next day, the GI reduces substantially. Cooking Indian basmati rice in a microwave oven compared to a rice cooker lowered the GI by 20.4 per cent, he mentioned.  However, the problem that remains despite all these different cooking methods is the absolute increased carbohydrate consumed by the average Indian diabetic.  Efforts must be taken to improve health-related outcomes, especially in India, and from the evidence it is clear, that by limiting both total carbohydrate intake and foods with high GI, not only weight but also all indices of metabolic health can be improved, he stressed.

TRSMA president, Kandala Papi Reddy, general secretary S.N. Reddy, treasurer K. Sreekanth Reddy and spokesperson Chinthala Ramchander felt that Teacher Bandhu on the lines of Rythu Bandhu and Dalit Bandhu should be launched to save about two lakh teachers in the private budget schools. Budget schools numbering about 8,000 in Telangana were saving the government from the burden of thousands of crores assuming that the government spends 50,000 on each student in government schools.  We provide quality education at an affordable price ranging from 500 to 2,000 per month in cities, small towns and rural areas, and our schools should be protected, Mr. Kandala Papi Reddy said. He said parents and people in society were unfortunately equating these budget schools with corporate schools and international schools that collect exorbitant fee.  Mr. Reddy said the budget schools played a crucial role in the Telangana agitation extending active support to Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao and the TRSMA expected the government to support them when corporate schools were expanding into rural areas, putting burden on parents through their marketing strategies.  He appreciated the government for supporting private teachers with 2,000 and 25 kg of rice in April, May and June this year but it had been stopped for July and August. We hope the government continues it till the offline classes are held and hold teachers in the profession for the students future, he said.  Stating that the demands of TRSMA budget schools were reasonable, Mr. S.N. Reddy wanted the government to provide health cards to all private teachers, reduction in property tax and shifting the power charges category from category 2 to 7 apart from abolishing property and water taxes completely for the Coronavirus period.

In a video interaction with Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY) beneficiaries from Madhya Pradesh, he also praised the state government under Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan, saying that the state has left behind its earlier image of a beemaru rajya (sick state).  Modi accused the previous government of keeping the poor and villagers away from basic amenities such as roads, electricity, housing, cooking fuel, banking etc. He said, They used to speak the word poor hundreds of times a day. They recited the word poor like a song, but did not adopt their welfare in practice. Such acts are called pakhand (hypocrisy). They did not give these facilities to the poor but used to express false sympathy.  Modi was presiding over the Anna Utsav organised by the MP government to distribute additional 5 kg free ration to 1.15 crore families as part of PMGKAY.  He spoke to four beneficiaries from the state: Rajendra Sharma, an autorickshaw driver from Burhanpur; Dilip Kori from Satna; Chandra Badan Vishwakarma from Niwari; and Maya Dhurve from Hoshangabad.  The four were among 1.15 crore families from across the state who were given 5 kg additional wheat and rice through 25,453 fair price shops in MP. People in the list of beneficiaries in flood-hit districts of Gwalior-Chambal region would be given an additional 50 kg ration per family, apart from 5 kg wheat and rice, Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan had announced on Friday.  Modi expressed grief over the loss of lives and livelihood of those affected by rain and flood in the Gwalior-Chambal region and assured them of all help by the Centre.  Speaking about development of the state under Chouhan, the Prime Minister said: I remember the condition of roads in MP  the state was infamous for its scams. But today, MPs cities are touching new heights of cleanliness and development. If government schemes today are being implemented on ground, it is due to the change in governance.  Pointing out that August 7 also marked the beginning of Swadeshi movement in 1905, Modi urged people to purchase handicraft from local shops and promote handloom, and warned them against letting down their guard against Covid-19.",PM: Previous govts spoke of poor but didn’t work for their welfare; MP has uplifted them,RICE
2021-08-07,https://indianexpress.com/article/india/uphill-climb-for-pahadi-restaurant-name-cooks-up-storm-7443714/,"A nondescript restaurant promising Indian, Chinese, Tandoori and Chaat food, with local recipes on its menu, and the photo of a cherubic child chuckling next to a tandoor steak on its board, is hardly the stuff of haute cuisine. However, in six days of operations, Dehradun to Delhi, Pyari Pahadan has cooked up a storm.  Owner Preeti Maindoliya, protesters argue, has insulted the hill people to matrashakti (woman power) with the name of the restaurant. One of the protesters, who allegedly assaulted Maindoliya, has been arrested.  A B.Tech, Maindoliya, 26, says running a restaurant was her first dream, and so she decided to pursue it after two years of working as an electronics engineer. She took up an 180 sq ft space in the Banjarawal area of Dehradun, and named her eatery Pyari Pahadan. The name had always appealed to her as Pahadan was what her classmates from the plains called her in college, she says. Her mother moved from Dhumakot, their village in Pauri Garhwal, hit by migration like many other villages in Uttarakhand, to help her run the restaurant.  But within an hour of the restaurant opening on August 1, a man later identified as Surendra Rawat did a Facebook Live from the site, objecting to the name. Later, he arrived with some women, who allegedly threatened Maindoliya, calling the name an insult to matrashakti and pahadis. I told them I was also a pahadi, and had been born and brought up in Pauri Garhwal district, says Maindoliya, the daughter of a government teacher.  Soon, she says, she also got calls on her phone threatening that unless she changed its name the restaurant would be vandalised.  On August 2, Rawat reportedly arrived with Bhawana Pandey and Pramila Rawat, and Maindoliya was assaulted, causing her to pass out. Her mother Neelima filed a complaint at the Patel Nagar Police Station and an FIR was lodged against the three under IPC Sections 354 (assault on a woman with intent to outrage her modesty), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt) and 506 (criminal intimidation). Surendra Rawat has been arrested and probe is on, Pradeep Rana, Station Officer, Patel Nagar, said.  While Maindoliya says she was told the three were associated with the Uttarakhand Kranti Dal (UKD), the political outfit issued a statement denying any links and condemning the attack on her. Bhawana Pandey is not associated with the UKD. Names of some other persons associated with the UKD have appeared in the matter and will be probed. The UKD fully supports the victim and will cooperate in getting the guilty punished, a release by UKD state president Kashi Singh Airy said.  Pandey on her part claims to have fought for Uttarakhands statehood, and says she is a social worker aspiring to contest the next Assembly elections. Denying raising hands against Maindoliya, she says, The word pahadan represents women of the hills and it is associated with their honour. The title pyari pahadan is objectionable. What do they want to serve there with this title? Would you like it if somebody calls your mother or sister a pyari pahadan?  Pandey also claims that Pramila Rawat is a leader of the UKD. Pramila was not available for comment.  Maindoliya says she is determined not to change the name, particularly due to the support she has received since sharing her ordeal on social media. Several people, including politicians, have come to her restaurant to eat as a gesture of support. Among the delicacies the restaurant offers is mandwe ki roti (made of iron, protein-rich ragi, grown in the hills); kheer of jhangora, a local rice variety; daal of local pulse tor; and Gahat ka fadu (gahat being a pulse given to patients of kidney and gall bladder stones).  AICC general secretary and former chief minister Harish Rawat called Maindoliya up as well as tweeted asking people to visit her restaurant for a pahadi meal. Former Congress state president Kishore Upadhyay dropped in with party leaders. A delegation of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), which is seeking to contest Uttarakhand elections, has also met Maindoliya. Calling the restaurant an evidence of her entrepreneurship and reflection of Uttarakhandi spirit, AAP leader Ravindra Jugran said, If a dhaba with the title Pyari Pahadan is not opened in Uttarakhand, where will it be opened? Those who created a controversy, they do not know the actual meaning of pyari pahadan.  Maindoliyas mother Neelima says she and her husband fully back their daughter. My husband helped her get a loan. She has not given up even after this controversy. I am also a pahadan and dont feel insulted by the title. Plus, Neelima adds, Preeti has given employment to four Pahadi youths who lost restaurant jobs during the Covid lockdown.","An uphill climb for a pahadi restaurant, name cooks up a storm",RICE

Still several countries are rejecting Indian basmati containers due to pesticide residue in the crop.  A big rice exporter from Punjab (requesting anonymity) informed that, Around 8-10 containers  each container carries 20 tonnes basmati rice  are being returned by several countries every month as recently 5-6 containers were returned by Egypt and even Lebanon Yemen and Jordan too have returned our containers on the pretext of high residue of pesticides against the required limit.  Earlier the restrictions were imposed by European Union (EU) only but now it is spreading across all the countries which import basmati from India, he added.  Rice Exporters with Agriculture Export Development Authority (APEDA) under the Ministry of Commerce have been conducting camps at village level where several basmati growers are invited to educate them about harmful impact of pesticides, which are banned in several countries, and even they register farmers so as to have a continuous link with them to make them aware about the update on the use of only recommended pesticides in case of any need and its dose. Even farmers are provided with information about the weather conditions to keep the crop healthy in adverse conditions too.  But still farmers have been using several non-recommended pesticides including Acephate, Carbendazim, Thiamethoxam, Triazofos, Tricyclazole, Buprofezin, Carbofuron, Propiconazole and Thiophanate Methyl etc. , said another exporter, adding that the farmers under the influence of pesticide companies, which have a vast network of dealers across the state, have been using these non- recommended pesticides.  They said that till the time Centre and state government will not take interest, this usage will not be stopped because pesticides companies are big giants and have a vast network in the state and they influence farmers easily on the name of poor crop if the pesticide is not used etc.  If the supply of such pesticides is stopped then these will not be available to the farmers. These pesticides are not at all required for the crop but under a force of habit farmers are using these even without their need, said Ashok Sethi, basmati exporter and director, Punjab Rice Millers and Exporters Association, Punjab, adding that we are educating farmers how to control the attack of main diseases.  He said every month their containers are rejected due to the presence of pesticide residue despite their large efforts of educating farmers against their usage.  Just finding some insects and fungus does not mean that farmers need to spray pesticides and fungicides as there is always Economic Thresh-hold Level (ETL) level of every pest and if it crosses that only then treatment is required not before that, but what is happening here is that farmers are using pesticides for these diseases even before their attack as precautionary measure which is not only increasing farmers input cost but also injecting pesticides in natural growing crop, said Sethi.  Also farmers are using double dose of several recommended pesticides which is also responsible for presence of residue in the crop, if a recommended pesticide is used at the time of its requirement in a required dose then its residue would not be beyond the permissible limits in the crop, said Agriculture Officer, Pathankot, Dr Amrik Singh.  A pesticide dealer said Tricyclazole (a fungicide) to control neck blast, which may appear in over 3 months old crop during grain filling stage, is always used more than double dose. Its residue remains in the crop because it is used just a month before harvesting. Similarly Propiconazole (a fungicide) is to be used in seed production, which is required for next sowing, but farmers are using it for shining purpose of the grain which is not required but we sell under pressure of big companies which ask us to do so because farmers in Punjab are highly in favour of usage of pesticides and fertilisers whether crops need it or not, he added.  Pesticides and Fertilisers Association (SPFA), Punjab, state president Mohinder Pal Singh Khalsa, stressed upon that not only the basmati growers but all farmers who grow different crops must go by the advice of Punjab Agriculture University (PAU), Ludhiana, authorities and avoid overdosing to save our food chain from chemicals.","In repeated rejection of exported crop, failure of efforts to grow pesticide-free basmati",RICE

This financial outlay for the National Mission on Edible Oil-Oil Palm (NMEO-OP) will be over a five-year period, Agriculture Ministry officials later confirmed.  The Prime Minister was speaking at a virtual event to release the ninth instalment of income support worth 19,500 crore to 9.75 crore farmers under the PM Kisan scheme.  Today, when India is being recognised as a major agricultural exporting country, then it is not appropriate for us to depend on imports for our edible oil needs, said Mr. Modi, noting that the share of imported palm oil is more than 55%. We have to change this situation. The thousands of crores that we have to give to others abroad to buy edible oil should be given to the farmers of the country only, he added, naming north-eastern India and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands as prime locations for oil palm cultivation.  Cutting import dependence  In response to a Rajya Sabha query in February 2020, Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal had said the NMEO proposal would aim to reduce import dependence from 60% to 45% by 2024-25, by increasing domestic edible oil production from 10.5 million tonnes to 18 million tonnes, a 70% growth target. It projected a 55% growth in oilseed production, to 47.8 million tonnes. It is not clear whether these targets have changed under the final version of the mission.  Rise in yields  The NMEO-OPs predecessor was the National Mission on Oil Seeds and Oil Palm, which was launched at the fag end of the UPA governments tenure and later merged with the National Food Security Mission. Laying out its achievements in May 2020, the Agriculture Ministry said oilseed production had grown 35% from 27.5 million tonnes in 2014-15 to 37.3 million tonnes by 2020-21. Although oilseed acreage rose only 8.6% over that six year period, yields rose more than 20%.  At the PM-Kisan event, Mr. Modi noted that although the countrys granaries are full of cereals such as rice and wheat, with the government making record purchases from farmers at MSP rates, self-sufficiency is yet to be attained in pulses and oil. Previous efforts to boost the production of pulses in the country had resulted in a 50% growth over the last six years, he said. The work we did in pulses, or in the past with wheat and paddy, now we have to take the same resolution for the production of edible oil also. For our country to be self-sufficient in this edible oil, we have to work fast, he added.  Noting that August 9 is the anniversary of the Quit India movement which fought for political independence, the Prime Minister said the NMEO-OP would resolve to allow India to be independent or self-reliant in edible oil production. Through this mission, more than 11,000 crore will be invested in the edible oil ecosystem. The government will ensure that farmers get all needed facilities, from quality seeds to technology. Along with promoting the cultivation of oil palm, this mission will also expand the cultivation of our other traditional oilseed crops, he said.","₹11,000 crore for new edible oil mission, says PM Modi",RICE

She planted saplings at the Alluri Memorial Park and said that it was her good fortune to have visited the region where Manyam Veerudu and revolutionary leader Alluri and his followers had fought against the British about a century ago.  Interacting with some children, who were present at the programme, Ms. Sitharaman asked: Do you know why I have come here? She told them: The Rampa rebellion, under the leadership of Alluri Sitarama Raju, was carried out against the British rulers 100 years ago from this place. The prominent places, which were associated with Indias freedom struggle all over the country, are being identified by the Centre to organise Azadi Ka Amrut Utsav, as part of 75 years of Independence.

The free rice should be given from April to November 2020 and from May 2021 to November 2021.  Later speaking to the beneficiaries in Telugu, she asked them whether they were getting the free rice. When they replied in the affirmative, she said: I have no objection, if vehicle comes to your doorstep to deliver rice but you (beneficiaries) should ensure that it should, at least, have a photo of the Prime Minister. She expressed happiness when a beneficiary replied: unnadandi (It is there).  Free rice scheme  Anakapalle MLA Gudivada Amarnath, who was beside her, said: Madam, due to COVID-19, we are delivering rice at the doorstep of beneficiaries. When she asked him about the free rice scheme, he said: Pradhan Mantri Grameen (instead of Garib) Kalyan Yojana and, perhaps, realising his mistake, quickly changed it to PMGKY. Ms. Nirmala Sitharaman wondered how the rural beneficiaries would understand it.  Mr. Amarnath said: If you want me to tell about our Anna (CM Jagan), I can tell.

Sprouted seeds are sown following the first rain in June after salt water is drained from the fields.  Father Prashant Palakkappally, a Catholic priest and former principal of Sacred Heart College, Thevara, who launched sowing in the fields of Chandu Manjadiparambil, a farmer from Maruvakkad, said farmers provided sustenance to society and were invaluable.  The normal pokkali cycle starts in the middle of April and lasts till November. However, the delay in draining the fields this year has resulted in farmers holding up sowing.  Francis Kalathungal, a veteran activist who works for the protection of pokkali rice tradition under the aegis of Pokkali Samrakshana Samiti, said the shrimp cultivation lobby had been attempting to sabotage rice cultivation, and that it was through court intervention that the ground was cleared for rice cultivation.  Pokkali rice plants take 120 days from sowing to be harvested. It takes around 90 days for flowering and another 30 days before the crop is ready to be harvested. Now, farmers are worried that the crop cycle could be upset by the withdrawal of the monsoon ahead of the flowering season, said Mr. Kalanthungal.  He added that the salinity level of water in the paddy fields was critical to the production of pokkali rice. Water quality with sustainable salinity of up to 8 to 12 parts per million (ppm) was tolerable, while the ideal condition is 6 ppm.  The total extent of pokkali fields available at Chellanam is around 1,300 hectares, but only 10 acres have been brought under cultivation, said Mr. Kalathungal.",Pokkali fields at Chellanam come alive again,RICE

But not many know about the practices, customs and lifestyles of the tribal communities of Gujarat . On this International Day of Worlds Indigenous People, TOI looks at some strange but interesting practices of the tribals.: Time moves forward and never backwards as the hands of our clocks show. But many tribals in Dahod, Panchmahal and Tapi have clocks where the hands move backward. Often known as adivasi ghadis, the hands of these clocks move anti-clockwise. Different people have different beliefs about this non-conventional clock. While some say that this clock symbolizes the law of nature as tribals worship it, some in Dahod say that earths destruction is guaranteed and as these hands of clock move backwards, that moment is also nearing. I have asked many people who have such clocks, but for them this is the correct way. They even move their stone grinder anti-clockwise since ages, said Dr Madan Meena, director of Adivasi Academy.: Cow is revered among the majority community, similarly the tribal too, respect the animal as they consume its milk. In fact, every year a fair is organized in Dahod for cows. The animal is decorated with peacock feathers and natural paints. At this fair, men and women make cows walk over them to pay back the debt to the animal which they believe to have incurred by consuming its milk.: In any year, if rains are delayed, yagnas or other religious ceremonies are performed by citizens groups in cities and towns to appease the rain Gods. But in Dahod district if the monsoon is delayed, many villages there witness symbolic robberies to appease the rain Gods. Under this practice, women dress up as men and conduct robberies in different houses in their villages. The subtle message to the rain Gods behind these robberies is that the people are forced to rob houses since the monsoon is delayed.: With changing trends and times, many splurge on lavish wedding invitation cards. In contrast to these big-budget weddings, tribals have a humble tradition of extending invitations to their friends and relatives for weddings. In many tribal regions, people give raw rice soaked in turmeric as an invite. As modernity has reached the semi-urban tribal areas, many have even started giving invitation cards, but they also make sure that turmericsoaked rice is also given with it.In any wedding, the groom and bride are the centre of attraction. But in a few villages of Chhota Udepur, it is the bride and the grooms sister who steal the show. Strange, it may sound, but the tradition of Surkheda, Sanada and Ambala villages of Chhota Udepur district dont allow grooms to be part of their own weddings. His sister is decked as a groom albeit with mehendi in her hands and silver ornaments all on her body exchanges vows with the bride. The regions folklore suggests that a local deity named Bharmadev was engaged in getting other gods get married and he remained unmarried, so in respect of Bharmadev, grooms get married do not attend the ceremonies.","Gujarat: Here, time moves backwards and women rob to please rain Gods!",RICE

Observing that the subsidy now represented more than 1% of the Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP), the document explained the reasons for the increase in power subsidy. According to the figures of revised estimates for 2020-21, the average rate of realisation by the Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation (Tangedco) was 6.7 per unit against the average cost of supply of 9.06 per unit, leaving a shortfall of  2.36.  As for the agriculture sector and domestic consumers, Tangedco was not getting the full subsidy payout for the energy sold to them. It had got a subsidy payout of 3.32 per unit for the farm sector and 1.09 per unit for the domestic category. While the recovery from the former was nil, it was 2.23 per unit from the latter. With 32,639 million units of electricity supplied to the domestic sector, the total loss on account of domestic supply was 18,735 crore during 2020-21.  Over the years, there had been a steady decline in Tangedcos share in supply to industries. It was mainly due to the availability of alternatives, such as captive power plants and open access to third party consumers through power exchanges, which were cheaper than the industrial tariff of the utility that had, in turn, made Tamil Nadu uncompetitive as an industrial destination.  At the same time, on the revenue side, there had been no revision of tariff for the past seven years, the document said, adding that as the focus was on short-term survival and cash management, huge liabilities had been created for the long term. A complete restructuring cannot be postponed much further.  As for the overall subsidies that included food and transport apart from power, the document said the subsidies which amounted to 4,841.80 crore in 2006-07 (12.65% of total revenue expenditure and 1.48% of the GSDP) had reached 62,338.84 crore in 2020-21 (27.06% of TRE and 3.21% of the GSDP). Even if 2020-21 was an outlier year because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the subsidies had reached 19.5% of total revenue expenditure and 2.36% of the GSDP in 2018-19 itself.  As for food subsidy, a significant portion of the subsidy on rice was actually met through the framework of the National Food Security Act, 2013. In the State, rice was being given free to all rice card-holders under the public distribution system. It was the State that was meeting the entire subsidy on edible oil and tur dal, which were being supplied at subsidised prices. Advocating urgent course correction measures for improved targeting and reorientation of subsidies to areas which enhance the public good and have positive externalities, the White Paper said the cost effectiveness of alternative means of delivering financial assistance to stakeholders could also be explored without compromising on the delivery of essential commodities and services to vulnerable segments.",The growth in power subsidy ‘particularly alarming’,RICE

Poor dam management of the previous LDF government had almost destroyed Kuttanad. Now it should do something to salvage what remains of the State's storied granary, he said.  Saltwater intrusion, silting of rivers, estuaries and spillways threatened the fragile bio-saline ecosystem. Potable water is in short supply. Thousands of acres of paddy, ""puncha and virippu"" in local parlance, are no longer arable due to silting. People have no access to health care or ambulance service.

Conserving Vembanad and desilting leading water channels, deepening the catchment area of dams would prevent recurrent flooding in Kuttanad,"" he said.

Successive governments have extended the benefits of subsidies to all, at least in such crucial sectors as electricity, water and public distribution system. But the main message from the White Paper is that the government is mulling over a targeted approach towards the subsidy regime.  As of now, there is no immediate change in the policy as Finance Minister Palanivel Thiaga Rajan himself made it clear on Monday. He added that reforms, including the idea of taxing the rich more and using the money for the welfare of the middle class and the poor, had to be discussed first with Chief Minister M.K. Stalin and his Cabinet colleagues.  Immediately after assuming charge, the DMK gave 4,000 each in cash assistance to all rice card-holders without making any distinction on the basis of the economic status. But what is significant now is that in a State where freebies and competitive populism are the norm, a government document emphasises the need for re-orientation or rationalisation of subsidies, and for urgent course correction measures.  In the area of electricity, the document brings out the governments discomfort. Though it does not hint at severing the free power supply to farmers, the White Paper reads NIL for the recovery from the farm sector for 18% of the energy supplied by the Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation. The document has highlighted the fact in bold letters that the Corporation does not get fully subsidised for the cost of supply to farmers, which works out to 8,225 crore a year. As for the domestic consumers who enjoy 100 units free bi-monthly, the White Paper not only puts the value of under-recovery at 18,735 crore during 2020-21 but also states bluntly that those who consume more electricity are receiving greater subsidies.  The White Paper calls the unmetered or flat water supply charge, being adopted in Chennai, an inherently unfair and regressive system, which favours those living in large houses and bungalows.  A veteran economist says the White Paper has brought to the fore all the major problems. However, there is nothing new about the solution suggested, as the key lies in implementation. For example, Chennai Metrowaters tariff for the domestic consumers has been designed to take care of metered supply too. But, owing to historical reasons, including the frequent droughts, the installation of meters has never been taken seriously.  Also, in respect of the public distribution system, the AIADMK government issued an order in July 2017, specifying guidelines for inclusion and exclusion of beneficiaries under the National Food Security Act, but it had no impact in view of the policy of universal PDS, the economist explains.",White Paper highlights a possible shift in TN government’s line on subsidies,RICE

Exacerbating the situation is the lockdown-induced closure of the anganwadis and schools that served noon meal to students from these families.  Before the elections, the district officials issued Aadhaar cards; but to just ten families. Even they have not received their ration cards. We rely on a few NGOs for essentials, said Lagma, a resident. Most of these families live by selling ornaments made of beads; this, however, earns them less than `100 a day.  Lack of ration cards also means they have to buy grain and groceries from local stores at MRP rates, a drain on their shoe-string budgets.  Sometimes, we eat only twice a day as we dont have enough food. Just drinking water and dry ration will go a long way in helping us meet our basic needs, says Kumari, a resident. As of now, the tribals subsist on rice and simple curries like rasam. On days the NGOs give them dal or wheat, they make chapathi.  Every rupee counts  In a report titled Public Distribution System in Tamil Nadu: Implications for Household Complications, published in LANSA, in 2018, it is stated that a family saves up to `417 a month if they avail 20 kg rice from ration shops. The report said the savings were used by the families to purchase pulses, oil, vegetables, and sugar, all of which are required for a healthy diet. The report highlighted that one kg of rice from a ration shop has 3,460 calories while one kg of wheat has 3,410 calories and cereals 3,435 calories. This means families without ration cards are losing up to 10,000 calories.  Social activist Vanessa Peter of Information and Resource Centre for Deprived Urban Communities said that lack of ration cards affects the nutrition of the children and pushes the families into debt trap. M Azhagesan of the State Tribals Association said that officials know where these tribals live as, in the past, they have come for land measuring and surveys. They even provided Aadhaar cards to a few. These issues must be addressed soon, he added.","Kancheepuram: Tribal kids malnourished in absence of schooling, ration cards",RICE

However, most people arent aware that if left untreated, it can lead to a lot of health problems. Nutritionist Rujuta Diwekar, who regularly shares important pieces of advice on health and nutrition, took to Instagram to share information about uric acid, how it can affect us, how to keep it in check and also busted several myths surrounding it.  All about uric acid  understanding uric acid, what to do to keep it in check, food, hydration and exercise. Reduce  smoking, alcohol, packaged food, long meal gaps and long sitting hours. Focus on  sleeping better, regular home-cooked food, hydration and exercise (sic), she captioned a video in which she is explaining the same. Take a look.  View this post on Instagram A post shared by Rujuta Diwekar (@rujuta.diwekar)  What is uric acid?  It is a natural waste product of the body that is generated daily. It comes from a chemical called purine which is created due to natural cell breakdown in our body. For females, the normal uric acid level is 2-6 and for males, it is about 3-7, the nutritionist said.  When does the production of uric acid rise?  Uric acid levels rise when your body is not able to effectively clear out the waste products. This happens when your body is not functioning the way it should, especially your kidneys. Mostly three activities lead to an increase in uric acid  smoking, alcohol and sitting. Therefore, we need to optimise the bodys functioning and support the clearance of waste by eliminating these three habits.  According to Diwekar, Rise in uric acid can lead to inflammation and reduced mobility in joints, and kidney stones.  What to consume?  *Water: Increase your water intake, especially during the daytime.  *Fruits: Eating fresh and seasonal fruits every day will keep you hydrated. Banana works really well if you already have inflammation.  *Milk, curd and buttermilk: Add these three things to your diet to reduce uric acid. Especially, eating curd with raisins once every day is highly recommended. Buttermilk helps you stay hydrated and is good for your muscles and joints.  *Nuts: Having a handful of nuts every day will keep your uric acid level down.  *Pulses and sprouts: First soak, sprout and then cook pulses and sprouts before eating them in the right proportion.  What not to eat?  *Ketchup  *Tetra pack juices  *Chocolates, chips and biscuits  Exercises  She added, Regular exercise plays a great role in keeping your uric acid levels down.  *For every 30 minutes of sitting down, stand for at least three minutes.  *Climb at least one floor every day to keep the body mobile.  *Do strength training at least two days a week.  *Include stretches and Yoga in your routine.  Have a glass of turmeric milk and stay away from gadgets before sleeping if you have trouble sleeping properly, she suggested.  Busting myths about uric acid  *Consuming spinach wont create a problem when eaten in proportion.  *Milk and milk products are safe to consume.  *You can eat eggs in proportion.  *Meat and fish wont increase your uric acid levels. Thus, they are safe to consume if you eat them as a small part of your meal, two to three times a week.  *Whey proteins can be eaten right after your exercise.  *Eat millets in accordance with the season. However, dont replace your rice and wheat with millets completely.",Uric acid: Nutritionist Rujuta Diwekar explains all about this metabolite,RICE

Usually, kharif activities commence by May end and continue till August end. States 90 pc of the farmers are into paddy cultivation. In the current kharif season, many farmers who started sowing paddy seeds or transplanting the saplings are now worried over the break spell of the southwest monsoon.  According to the Crop Weather Watch Group, States paddy programme area is 35 lakh hectares but the crop has been taken up in 24.68 lakh hectares till August 7. During the same period last year, paddy cultivation was over 29.66 lakh hectares which means there is a decline of about 5 lakh hectares so far.  Many farmers did not start cultivation waiting for the rain which is why paddy coverage has been less this time. The situation is such that even if the State receives rainfall in the coming days, it will not be of much help to the farmers, said Amaresh Khuntia, a faculty member of Odisha University of Agriculture and Technologys Agronomy department.  The State witnessed 78 pc scanty rainfall between August 1 and 9. Experts said that if the paddy cultivation target is not achieved in the kharif season, the price of rice in the open market will be hiked by traders. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) informed that southwest monsoon remained subdued/weak between August 1 and 10 due to weak monsoon flow over Odisha.  The State received 488.6 mm rainfall between June 1 and August 10, which is a 29 per cent deficit. Out of 30 districts, 22 are under the deficient rainfall category and eight districts are under the normal category. More than 40 per cent deficiency has been observed in four districts - Bhadrak, Jajpur, Gajapati and Balangir - between June and August 10.

2021-08-13,https://indianexpress.com/article/world/lebanon-dollars-shield-some-from-hyperinflation-crisis-7452671/,"Long queues outside gas stations, empty shelves in pharmacies and often more than 20 hours of power outages a day  the situation in Lebanon was grim even before the Central Bank decided to lift the subsidies for fuel imports this week.  Signs of the crisis are easy to spot everywhere in Lebanon: The elderly woman who asks for money in the evening  she doesnt seem like one who ever had to beg in her life. The cab driver who had to give up his cat because he could no longer afford to feed it. The woman who wanted to buy yogurt in the store and changed her mind after she heard the price.  The crisis doesnt affect everyone equally  Since the exchange rate of the Lebanese pound was pegged to the US dollar in 1997 (1 US dollar = 1,507 Lebanese pounds, also referred to as Lebanese lira), and, until 2019, Lebanons currency had been fairly stable.  But since the economic crisis hit in late 2019, the pound has lost about 90% of its value. Currently, $1 is sold for 23,000 Lebanese pounds on the black market. This means that nowadays having dinner in a good restaurant is the equivalent of just a few US dollars. A ride in a cab? Between 40 cents and $2.  However, the Lebanese hyperinflation does not affect everyone to the same extent; those who have access to US dollars even benefit.  Greenbacks highly desired  People who have access to US dollars, either from the outside or from the inside through the black market, are able to live a lifestyle beyond their original means, Bassel Salloukh, a political scientist at the Lebanese American University in Beirut, told DW.  However, few people have access to fresh cash, or money that hasnt been invested before, and in Lebanons particular case, it also means the transfer of US dollars from abroad. For example, those who rent apartments. The currency is in such high demand that most property owners demand rent in dollars  and thats forcing many tenants to move out.  Savings melt away  Yara is one of the few people with access to fresh dollars. The young woman, who, like other interviewees, requested anonymity, has a job with an NGO and receives her salary in cash and in US dollars. Although this allows her to afford much more than those who earn their salaries in Lebanese pounds, she doesnt feel particularly good about it. Even if I go to an expensive place, I make sure not to post it on social media.  Still, Yara has also suffered from the crisis. She lost a large part of her savings since it is impossible to withdraw dollars from banks. Every time, Yara withdraws dollars from her savings account, the sum is automatically converted into Lebanese pounds, at the fixed bank exchange rate of 3,900 pounds. This means that her savings are now worth only a fraction of what she deposited.  Development aid organizations are not excluded either. They have to exchange their aid payments at another unfavorable exchange rate set by the government  currently 15,000 pounds. According to a report by Reuters news agency, they have already lost $250 million that were supposed to be earmarked for refugee aid and poverty alleviation in Lebanon.  Black market trade flourishes  Political scientist Bassel Salloukh expects the crisis to drastically change Lebanese society. Many people have already moved from the cities back to the villages because they could no longer afford to live in Beirut. Unprecedented numbers of people are trying to leave the country altogether, especially well-educated people.  On the other hand, the informal economy is booming.  A lot of people who did not work or make much money before the crisis have invented new jobs for themselves, Salloukh told DW. They sell fuel in the black market or help you find medicine when you cannot find it  if you are willing to pay for it.  Those who manage to profit from the situation, however, are a small minority, he said, adding: The rest of the population is going through a horrible meltdown.  Vegetarian diet out of necessity  We are just surviving like this, says Marwa. She lives with her husband and 8-year-old daughter in an apartment in Dahieh, a southern suburb of Beirut. Im afraid to think about the future. We live from one day to the next. Maybe tomorrow I wont be able to go on, maybe the day after tomorrow.  A few days ago, Marwas daughter had a bad stomachache. But when Marwa took her to the pharmacy, the pharmacist claimed he had no suitable medicine. Marwa became angry, her daughter doubled over in pain. Finally, the pharmacist handed over medicine to the stunned mother.  Economists are not surprised. Gas stations and pharmaceutical suppliers are known to hoard gasoline and medicine. The reason is simple: They are waiting for prices to rise further so that they can then sell their goods at an even higher price.  Marwas husband works as a wedding planner, earning 1,100,000 Lebanese pounds a month. Two years ago, this was the equivalent of $730  today it is less than $60. The biggest share of this is needed for rent and the electricity generator, leaving hardly any money for food.  I used to buy a kilo of rice for 2,000 Lebanese pounds. Now the kilo costs at least 15,000 pounds, says Marwa. The last time they had cutlets or chicken for dinner was a long time ago. Now she mostly cooks rice and lentils from food packages provided by aid organizations.  A war-like devaluation  Since the fall of 2019, Lebanon has been sliding deeper and deeper into an economic crisis. The hyperinflation led to multiplied prices for food and products. Lebanons gross domestic product has plummeted from $55 billion in 2018 to $33 billion in 2020, according to a World Bank report.  Such a brutal and rapid contraction is usually associated with conflicts or wars, the report states.  So far, there is no conflict or war in Lebanon, and yet, the Lebanese government hasnt started to introduce sustainable steps or reforms to put a hold on the crisis.",Lebanon: Dollars shield some from hyperinflation crisis,RICE

Satheesan has urged the government to prosecute Supplyco officials in Kottarakara who allegedly tried to palm off spoiled rice crawling with worms to the public by rinsing the food grains with a lethal pesticide to remove the vermin.  He said local residents had apprehended Supplyco officials red-handed. The officials had attempted to cover up the loss they had caused to the public exchequer through poor warehousing by resorting to practices that endangered public health.  Mr. Satheesan highlighted the incident in a letter to Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan.  He urged Mr. Vijayan to order a police inquiry. Ideally, the government should book the errant officials for culpable homicide, not amounting to murder. The government should audit warehousing practices and ensure they confirm to global standards. He said the incident detected in Kottarakara was just the tip of the iceberg.  He said the toxic food grains reached people through the PDS. The warehouse officials routinely used aluminium phosphate to rid grain silos of pests.  Politically motivated  Food and Civil Supplies Minister G.R. Anil termed the controversy as politically motivated.  He told The Hindu that warehouse staff routinely used Aluminium Phosphide tablets for fumigation. He said the staff ensured the grain sacks were hermetically sealed. The Food Corporation of India (FCI) had approved the method. A group of people had created a ruckus when the process was on in the warehouse in Kottarakara.

No official found guilty of mismanagement would be spared, he said.  He added that the Director of Civil Supplies has also been instructed to conduct a thorough inspection of all such facilities across the State to ensure the stocked essentials were stored correctly.  The allegation that pesticide-laced rice was meant to be supplied through Onam kits and for school students is inhumane and baseless.

The invention, which was filed for patent in 2014, is of great help for farmers to check weedy rice (vari in local parlance) in paddy fields in the State. The technology was transferred to Raidco Kerala Ltd., a Government of Kerala enterprise, and the product is available in the market.  The novel wiper device was designed as part of the doctoral programme of Nimmy Jose, scientist at the Rice Research Station, Moncompu, of the KAU.  The research conducted by her under the guidance of C.T. Abraham, former Professor and Head, All India Coordinated Research Project on Weed Control, KAU, could also standardise an integrated strategy for the management of the highly persistent weedy rice in paddy fields.  The research programme was granted the best PhD thesis award for the year 2015 by the Indian Society of Weed Science.  Weedy rice is a product of natural hybridisation between cultivated rice and wild rice. Morphological and biochemical similarity of weedy rice to cultivated rice makes hand weeding and herbicidal control ineffective. As a result, weedy rice infestation has become a serious threat in the rice tracts of Kerala. Severe infestation and subsequent reduction in yield by 50-70% has forced many farmers to abandon rice cultivation.  Weedy rice generally grows taller by 15-30 cm than cultivated rice after 55-60 days of sowing.  The KAU Weed Wiper makes use of this height difference for the selective application of herbicides on weedy rice plants to destroy them.  The device is fast gaining popularity among farmers as it makes restricted application possible without contaminating soil or crops.",KAU Weed Wiper gets patent,RICE

Rahul Karmakar reports on the long history of a dispute that awaits a permanent solution  A month before the Assam-Mizoram border conflict on July 26 claimed the lives of six Assam police personnel, Lalchhandama was in Champhai town near the Myanmar border when his farm shed and areca nut plantation, 320-km north at Aitlang, were destroyed. Aitlang is within the Inner-Line Reserve Forest, which is a 509-sq km green belt that the British India administration had notified in 1875. They did this to separate the plains of the tea-rich Surma or Barak Valley from the hills inhabited by the Lushais, who would often raid the plains. The Lushais and other ethnically related communities came to be called the Mizos decades later.  The Inner Line Reserve Forest runs along the 146.6-km Assam-Mizoram border. Not clearly demarcated, it separates the Aizawl, Kolasib and Mamit districts of Mizoram from the Cachar, Hailakandi and Karimganj districts of Assam. About 300 Mizo families  all residents of Mizorams border town Vairengte  have broomstick or areca nut plantations in the hilly Aitlang, which Mizoram claims is in Kolasib district. Assam claims it is in Hailakandi district and has periodically been evicting Mizo encroachers.  The last time Lalchhandama and a few others lost their broomstick plantations to such an eviction drive was about 10 years ago. We would wait for things to cool down in a few days and reclaim our land, he said. But he had a bad feeling when fellow cultivator Darthanzaua narrated how the officials from Assam were more organised than ever before during the eviction drive on June 29. Apart from destroying the plantations of 18 families, the Assam police set up camps in the vicinity in no time. I switched to areca nut on my 1.5-hectare land two years ago. I am not sure if I will get back my land this time, let alone start cultivation again, he said.  Disrupting life  Aitlang is aerially about 5-km west of Auto Stand on National Highway 306, Mizorams lifeline, where the conflict took place in July. The Auto Stand, almost midway between Vairengte and Assams Lailapur town where three-wheelers from both the States terminate, is now a Mizoram police checkpoint. In the 4-km stretch of the highway between the Mizoram police checkpoint and the Assam police barricade at Lailapur are two barriers, about 100 metres apart, each manned by a unit of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF). The CRPF units have been stationed as a neutral force at violence-prone spots along the inter-State border after the July 26 incident. The CRPF replaced the Border Security Force and the Sashastra Seema Bal which were deployed after arson and violence on October 17, 2020, under the operational control of the Mizoram police and the Assam police, respectively.  About 10-km east of Lailapur, Riyazuddin Laskar is more worried than relieved by an instruction from local authorities in Assam to stop paying tax to his Mizo landowner. Laskar, a Bengali Muslim, has been residing for more than a decade on the farmland Laltimliana claims he owns in the disputed stretch of the volatile inter-State border.  Laltimlianas thatched house is the last civilian structure in the Assam-controlled territory at Dholakhal Kulicherra Forest Village, referred to as Saihapui V in Mizoram, near the line of control  the Kalakhal stream  flanked by temporary camps of the CRPF.  Laltimlianas house is about 500-metres north of his tenant Laskars, in the Mizoram-controlled part of Saihapui V, beyond three layers of security  two of CRPF on either side of the culvert and a unit of the Indian Reserve Battalion inside the Mizoram-controlled territory. The V stands for Vairengte.  Laskar, like most Assam-based contract farmers on Mizo-owned land along the inter-State border, had struck an annual deal with Laltimliana. This entailed handing over 80 maunds of rice as tax to Laltimliana in lieu of staying and farming on his land. A maund in the border areas equals 30 kg, almost eight kg less than the measure elsewhere in Assam. The contract farmers subsist by growing three crops a year, usually keeping the yield of two crops for their own consumption or for selling in the local markets. I have not paid tax to my landowner this year. But I am worried this could be the end of my farming in this area and of years of association with the Mizo landowners, Laskar said. Laltimliana is the second Mizo landowner Laskar has worked with.  Also Read A guide to resolving the Assam-Mizoram issue  Radheshyam Chauhan and Ramlal Chauhan of Frenchnagar, west of Dholakhal Kulicherra, face a similar dilemma. They have not been to work on the paddy fields, fish ponds, areca nut and broomstick plantations in the adjoining Mizo-controlled Paglachhara. The border here starts where a road ends about 100 ft from the elevated Frenchnagar Khasiapunji LP School, now a camp of the Assam police commandos.  The camp set up after the July 26 incident has forced Bijon Malakar and his family to spend their nights at home. Their house adjoins the school. We used to send our women, children and the elderly away to spend the nights at the house of relatives since the border violence started in October 2020. The fear of attacks increased after Intaz Ali, a firewood collector from Lailapur, was killed in Mizoram 10 months ago. Intaz invariably took the road beside this school, he said.  Blood notice  A series of wooded low hills with patches of plantations and small valleys characterise the inter-State boundary. The Kulicherra area has four forest villages  Phainum, Upper Phainum, Buarchep and Saihapui V  marked as Cachars Mizo section. The four villages have about 600 people listed as voters in both Assam and Mizoram. Locals said the road and the Bengali-medium Upper Phainuam LP School bombed in October 2020 were built by the Assam government while Mizoram provided electricity and water supply.  Editorial | Dangerous conflagration: On Assam-Mizoram border clash  Whatever is our status on paper, we are emotionally, ethnically and culturally with Mizoram. We hope the Assam government will give back the land our forefathers have been occupying since 1925. What will Assam gain by robbing us of our land and livelihood as well as depriving their contract farmers caught in no mans land, Samuel-a, the son of Laskars landlord Laltimliana asked.  It is not a question of taking or ceding land but of a violation of the Supreme Courts 1996 order banning the felling of trees and non-forestry activities in forests across the country, officials in Assam said. The law is absolutely clear. Irrespective of status and ownership, there cannot be any non-forestry activities in forest areas. And they (Mizoram) have over the years built permanent structures, thereby breaking up the land, Jatindra Sarma, Southern Assam Circles Chief Conservator of Forests, said.  Records of the Assam Forest Department show that the encroachment on the Inner-Line Reserve Forest started in 1985, two years before Mizoram was upgraded from a Union Territory to a State.  The incident of encroachment first recorded was during November 1985 when a portion of Kalaland and Shantipur area inside Singla Reserve Forest (part of the Assam-Mizoram border in Karimganj district) was occupied with the help of the armed forces of Mizoram. Gradually, they encroached a total of 75 ha clearing natural vegetation and practising jhum (slash-and-burn cultivation on hill slopes) and cash crop plantation, a report prepared by the Forest Department on July 5 said.  Editorial | Over the borderline: On Centres role in resolving Assam-Mizoram row  Officials said some farmers in Assam showed the Mizos the way to encroach the forest. These farmers came up with the idea of contract farming, replacing the trees with plantation crops that ensured them a steady income.  Unlike the border forests of Karimganj and Hailakandi districts, the Cachar Division was relatively free from encroachment until October 17, 2020, the Forest Department report said. That day, three temporary bamboo shops on NH-306 were burnt down by miscreants from Vairengte, leading to a law-and-order problem in the border areas. Mizoram police accompanied by IR Battalion of more than 30 armed personnel entered Inner Line Reserve Forest and constructed a temporary post at Kulicherra Forest Village, the report said.  Manoj Kumar Singha, the beat officer at the Lailapur Forest Beat House, the last Assam government structure on the edge of the de facto boundary, said the Mizoram authorities had used the COVID-19 situation to grab Assams land inch by inch. Almost every day, our men on patrol saw them advance the testing centre for incoming passengers towards Assam. Whenever we objected, they would say it was a temporary set-up to be removed, he said.  Before long, Mizoram set up a police outpost atop Rengtilila, a mound beside the Auto Stand that had been cleared of an illegal plantation a few days ago, Singha said.  Also Read Centre to use satellite mapping to resolve NE border disputes  A notice that was to have been served to the Mizoram authorities for removal of the outpost led to the July 26 incident. We had registered a case against several Mizoram officials under various sections of the Assam Forest Regulation such as trespassing and encroachment. Based on that, we went to serve them the notice to come to our office on a specified date and give a written explanation. They refused to accept the notice and then all hell broke loose, Sunnydeo Choudhury, the Divisional Forest Officer said. He was transferred out of Cachar Division after the incident.  Assam police officials said the attack on them appeared to have been planned. The Mizoram officials became aggressive and in no time, a large crowd gathered firing air gun pellets and throwing stones. We fired a few teargas shells to disperse the mob before the Mizoram police started firing from behind bunkers on higher ground, a senior Assam police officer who received an air gun injury said. He said the Assam police retaliated after 20 minutes of firing from the other side only to evacuate their dead and the injured. We never thought a normal notice to people occupying our own land could cause such bloodshed, he added.  According to the Mizoram government, the Assam polices version of the incident is a web of lies. Why would 200 officials and policemen come trooping here if not to create trouble? They started the firing that led to the unfortunate incident on our territory. We are pained by the loss of lives because of the provocation, the States Home Minister Lalchamliana said.

Bangladeshi bogey  Border conflicts became a fairly regular feature from the mid-1990s. Silchar-based historical researcher Sanjib Deb Laskar said the conflicts intensified after the BJP-helmed North-East Democratic Alliance stirred sub-nationalism across the Northeast. The incidents took a serious turn after the Centres push for settling Assams border disputes with Arunachal Pradesh, Meghalaya, Mizoram and Nagaland ahead of the celebration of Indias 75th year of Independence.

One was derived in 1875 from the Bengal Eastern Frontier Regulation Act, 1873, which prescribes a permit for Indians beyond Mizoram to enter the territory. Mizoram follows this while Assam swears by the constitutional boundary decided in 1972 (when the Lushai Hills district of Assam became the Union Territory of Mizoram), based on a 1933 notification. Mizo leaders say the 1933 notification is not acceptable as their ancestors had not been consulted. Assam leaders reject this argument since the scenario, they say, was similar during the 1875 notification.  When the Mizo Peace Accord (with the extremist Mizo National Front that became a political party now ruling Mizoram) was signed in 1986, the boundary of 1933 was agreed to be made Mizorams boundary, Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said.  Political experts in Mizoram said the Constitution of India does not explain the constitutional boundary. The Mizos have lived under a colonial wrong and our leaders have time and again said the only acceptable boundary is the 1875 notification since the voices of our leaders seeking re-organisation of the Mizo-inhabited areas were never heard, Aizawl-based college teacher and member of Mizorams boundary committee, Joseph Lalfakzuala, said.  Also read | Northeast border disputes killed 157 people since 1979  Mizoram Chief Minister Zoramthanga said Assam was trying to grab its land for settling Bangladeshi migrants in Barak Valley. This seemed to have gained traction in the Northeast, especially with the BJP seen as eyeing the land of neighbouring States to settle Hindu Bengalis under the Citizenship (Amendment) Act. The Congress was earlier accused of using Bengali Muslims as a buffer in the disputed belt.  Deb Laskar contested this theory. The Bengali Hindus and Muslims living in areas near Mizoram are agriculturists of Sylhet (in Bangladesh) origin settled since 1650. The contract farmers on land claimed by the Mizos are not locals, but are from other parts of Barak Valley. In contrast, many Mizos came from eastern Asia in the 1800s and tribesmen would often raid areas up to Silchar. One must remember these raiders were the reason why the British raised the Cachar Levy in 1835, which became the paramilitary Assam Rifles later on, he said.  The bogey of Bangladeshi comes up when all arguments fail in the Northeast. No one in Lailapur or adjoining areas has been left out of the National Register of Citizens. We have been demanding a similar exercise in Mizoram to find out how many are domicile Mizos and how many are migrants from Myanmar, Lailapur-based social worker Abul Hussain Barbhuiya said.  Also Read Economic blockade on Mizoram lifted  The indigeneity of the Mizos can never be in doubt, said Famkima, the chairman of the joint council of four villages that comprise Vairengte town. Mizos are not encroachers too because the land always belonged to us. In fact, the old maps show our territory is as far as Dhalai (between Vairengte and Silchar). If Assam wants to remove the encroachment, they should start with those occupying our land in the plains of Barak Valley that should have been ours. In football terms, Assam has scored an offside goal because of the adventurism of its Chief Minister and it is the duty of the Centre to don the role of a fair referee, he said. Dhalai is the constituency of Assam Forest Minister Parimal Suklabaidya, a BJP veteran and a key player in the Assam Forest Departments bid to reclaim encroached forests along the border.  Solving conflict  But he agreed Mizos and Bengalis and other communities in Assam cannot live in conflict forever. We have a history of interdependence, and the sooner the boundary issue is resolved, the better for us, he said.  The boundary issue should have been resolved in 1947 but we cannot keep on complaining. The give-and-take policy that Assam and Meghalaya are pursuing can be a way forward for the vague Assam-Mizoram border too. How long can two sister States keep on reopening old wounds? Our job is to recommend, and a solution requires political will from both sides, Lalfakzuala said.  He recalled how Assam rejected a Supreme Court-appointed commissions report that prescribed transferring 70% of the disputed land to Arunachal Pradesh while accepting another panels report that advised Meghalaya to hand over a disputed village to Assam. Similarly, both Assam and Nagaland rejected the recommendations of two panels to settle their border disputes that have killed 136 people since 1979.  Assams Urban Development Minister Ashok Singhal, who along with Border Affairs Minister Atul Bora had met their Mizoram counterparts for easing the boundary tension, said the boundary should be properly demarcated and the Mizoram government should propose a mechanism for that.  The Reserve Forest cannot be encroached by either side, and there should be a proper investigation of the July 26 incident. Those guilty must be punished for the boundary issue to be resolved since policemen have died and people in Assam are emotionally charged, Singhal, also Cachars guardian minister, said.  The angst is apparent at the 6th Assam Police Battalion at Jayfarpur near Silchar. Forty-nine-year-old Shyamsundar Dushad, one of the policemen killed, was a havildar attached to this battalion. We received 50 lakh from the government as compensation. But this is not the justice we seek. Whatever may be the trigger, they committed a crime and should be tried as criminals, said his widow, Lakshmi Dushad.  The dead policemen were not Bangladeshis, were they? In a region of diverse communities, we want peace for normal life and a non-militarised boundary. But I hope the killing is not forgotten like the excesses committed by extremist groups after they come to the mainstream, Barbhuiya said. His reference was to the Mizo National Front which has been ruling Mizoram since December 2018.",Assam-Mizoram conflict | Reopening old wounds along the border,RICE

2021-08-15,https://indianexpress.com/article/lifestyle/health/stress-fracture-cases-pandemic-causes-treatment-causes-7426727/,"While the pandemic has made people conscious about remaining active for health, fitness and immunity, doctors have noticed a significant rise in the number of people experiencing stress fracture. According to experts, since the phased unlocking last year, cases of stress fracture have increased by 100 per cent. They say that middle-aged people, who have not indulged in outdoor activities ever but started after lockdown was lifted, comprise 10 per cent of the patients in the past one year.  Before the pandemic, we used to get 15-18 cases of stress fracture in a year, mainly after events like a marathon in the city or after Amarnath Yatra as people who may not have conditioned their bodies for the rigours of these activities would get affected. However, cases this year have doubled  we have received more than 30 cases so far, which is a significant increase. Most of the patients belong to the age group of 30-40 years, followed by 40-50 years, said Dr Maninder Shah Singh, Sr. Consultant Orthopedics and Chief of Foot and Ankle Service, Indian Spinal Injuries Centre, New Delhi.  ALSO READ | Expert tips to prevent slips and injuries during monsoon  He added that most of these people have never done rigorous exercises such as running, skipping, sports or jumping. However, with the discussion around health, immunity and fitness raging amid the pandemic, they chose to become active, which was a shock for their body that is both unaccustomed and unconditioned for such activities. We have advised them RICE (Rest; Ice; Compression and Elevation) as first-aid and completely stopping any morning walk or running for 6 weeks; none of them required surgery, he told indianexpress.com.  What is stress fracture and what are its symptoms?  The term stress fracture refers to a very small crack in the bone that can happen from repetitive trauma and is commonly found in the shin bone, foot, heel, hip, and lower back. The common symptom is pain. It reduces during resting but occurs and intensifies during normal, daily activities; swelling on the top of the foot or on the outside of the ankle; tenderness to touch at the site of the fracture; and possible bruising. Jumping up and down repeatedly, running long distances, or wearing wrong or worn-out footwear can cause a stress fracture. If left unattended, such pain at the site of stress fracture and around it may increase and increase the risk of suffering a complete fracture in the affected bone, the expert shared.  He added that stress fractures are the most regular injury seen in athletes and military recruits. Such fractures occur more in the lower limbs than in the upper limbs. These injuries should be examined for those who present with pain after a latest increase in activity with limited rest. This injury begins with repetitive and excessive stress on the bone which can result into the acceleration of normal bone remodelling, the production of micro fractures (caused by insufficient time for the bone to repair), the creation of a bone stress injury (i.e., stress reaction), and, eventually, a stress fracture, he said.

In his eighth consecutive address to the nation from the ramparts of the Red Fort, Prime Minister Narendra Modi called for making the next 25 years (when India will hit a century of independence) a glorious one with new thresholds, aspirations and dreams , coining the phrase Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vishwas, Sabka Prayaas (With all, development for all, the trust of all, the striving of all). There comes a time in every nations life where it defines anew what development means for it, and resolves anew on how to reach its goals, that moment for our country is now, he said. He termed the next 25 years as Amrit Kaal for achieving of these goals.  The recent second wave of COVID-19 that hit India was also referred to by the Prime Minister who recalled those who passed away and lauded the untiring and committed work of doctors, nurses, paramedics, sanitation workers, scientists and entrepreneurs who helped fight the pandemic and assisted by the development of indigenous vaccines. He also mentioned that while celebrating independence, Indians had taken an emotional decision to mark August 14th as Partition Horrors Remembrance Day for all those who had lost their lives and loved ones in the Partition of 1947.  His speech, nearly 90 minutes in all, went over the efforts of his government to simplify laws, make government less intrusive, heavy investment in infrastructure, including the 100 lakh crore Gatishakti initiative the master plan for which would be unveiled soon. He pointed out to Indias commitment to the environment and its climate change goals by stating that the country was committed to circular economy, and the new vehicle scrappage policy was part of that as well as the setting up of the National Hydrogen Mission for encouragement of green fuels.  He said his government was committed to the goal of 100% coverage of all welfare schemes, including the Jal Jeevan mission of tapped drinking water connections in all homes, Ujjwala cooking gas scheme, Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana for housing, Jan Dhan bank accounts for everyone and other such schemes. He also announced the admission for girls in all Sainik Schools across the country and that the use of fortified rice across all government nutrition programmes would also be undertaken. He said his government had the political will to push through second generation reforms required to jump start the economy. Describing the New Education Policy as a means to fight poverty, he said it would focus on encouraging teaching in regional languages. No child will be prevented from accessing opportunities just because of medium of instruction, mother tongue will be encouraged, he said.  Also Read All Sainik Schools to admit girls: PM says in Independence Day speech  Farm laws and the small farmer  In a nod to the fact that his government has been dealing with long running protests by farmers groups and Opposition parties on the three contentious farm laws, he asserted that the majority of Indian farmers were small and marginal and his government had prioritised their interests.  Giving the slogan of Chhota kisan bane desh ki shaan (small farmers should become India's pride)', Mr. Modi said 80% of Indias farmers had less than two hectares of land.  Keeping small expenses in mind, the government is implementing the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) under which more than 1.5 lakh crore has been transferred into the bank accounts of over 10 crore farmers, he added.  Mr. Modi also said reservation was being ensured for Dalits, STs, backwards and general category poor, and emphasised that the hand-holding of deprived communities was necessary.  Fighting terrorism and expansionist tendencies  The nature of international relations, Mr. Modi said, changed after the Second World War and there was a possibility of a new world order in a post-coronavirus pandemic scenario. He said that India was fighting the challenges of terrorism and expansionism with great courage and astuteness. He asserted that India did not hesitate in taking tough decisions and had political will to do so. India has given a stern signal to its enemies by conducting surgical and air strikes. This tells us that India is changing and can take the most difficult decisions and isn't reluctant to implement them, he added.  Can-do generation  Stressing that he had full faith in the youth of the country, the Prime Minister said this was a can-do generation which could achieve every goal, and pointed to how tier two and three cities had shown an eruption in start-ups many of whom had become unicorns.

He made no mention of the fact that the same scheme has turned up in his last two Independence Day speeches as well.  In fact, several initiatives announced on Sunday seem to be a rehash of previously launched schemes, some as old as two years ago.  In the near future, we are going to launch the National Master Plan of Prime Minister Gati Shakti which will be a huge scheme and fulfill the dreams of crores of countrymen, Mr. Modi said on Sunday. This scheme of more than 100 lakh crores rupees will result in new employment opportunities for lakhs of youth. Gati Shakti will be a National Infrastructure Master Plan for our country which will lay the foundation of holistic Infrastructure and will lead to an integrated and holistic pathway to our economy.  Back in 2019, similar words issued from the ramparts of Red Fort: We have decided to invest 100 lakh crore rupees for modern infrastructure in this time period. This will generate employment; will develop new systems and various aspirations will be met.  In 2020, Mr. Modi had reiterated the same plan, offering more details: The National Infrastructure Pipeline Project will play an important role in this endeavour. 110 lakh crore will be spent on this project. For this, about seven thousand projects have been identified in different sectors. This will also give a new direction and a fresh momentum to the overall infrastructure development of the country.  It was a similar story with some other announcements on Sunday as well. The Prime Minister said he had good news to share today that the Sainik Schools, administered by the Defence Ministry, would admit girls. The decision to make all Sainik Schools co-educational by 2021-22 was announced by the Defence Ministry back in October 2019.  I am announcing the National Hydrogen Mission today with this tricolour as a witness, the Prime Minister said on Sunday. However, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had announced this mission during her Budget speech in February.  The plan to fortify rice with iron and vitamins before distributing it in ration shops and at schools for the mid-day meal scheme was also announced by then Food Minister Ram Vilas Paswan in 2019, and a pilot project has been in progress for over a year now.  Although the Vande Bharat trains are not new, the decision to start 75 such new trains within 75 weeks is a fresh goal. The resolution to make India energy independent before the 100th anniversary of Independence and move towards a gas based economy also puts a deadline on a long-time ambition.  Previous Independence Day speeches from Mr. Modi have included grander ambitions. The schemes to electrify all villages, end open defecation through Swachh Bharat, provide taps in all rural households through Jal Jeevan, put a human in space by 2022, double farmers income by 2022 and double the economy to $5 trillion over a five year period were all announced from Red Fort during previous August 15 speeches, apart from the 100 lakh crore infrastructure plan that has now turned up in three separate speeches.  It has been two years since August 15, 2019. At least, the 100 lakh crore figure could have been changed, said a tweet in Hindi from Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala, leading the Opposition critique of the speech.  He announces new schemes but these are never implemented or seen on the ground. He says a lot of things but never adheres to them.

Addressing the nation on Independence Day, Modi said, Malnutrition and lack of essential nutrients in poor women and poor children poses major obstacles in their development. In view of this, it has been decided that the government will fortify the rice given to the poor under its various schemes. Be it the rice available at ration shops or the rice provided to children in their mid-day meals, the rice available through every scheme will be fortified by year 2024.  The announcement is significant as the country has high levels of malnutrition among women and children. According to the Food Ministry, every second woman in the country is anaemic and every third child is stunted. India ranks 94 out of 107 countries and is in the serious hunger category on the Global Hunger Index (GHI).  The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI), that sets standards for food items in the country, defines fortification as deliberately increasing the content of essential micronutrients in a food so as to improve the nutritional quality of food and to provide public health benefit with minimal risk to health.  According to FSSAI norms, 1 kg fortified rice will contain iron (28 mg-42.5 mg), folic acid (75-125 microgram) and Vitamin B-12 (0.75-1.25 microgram). In addition, rice may also be fortified with micronutrients, singly or in combination, with zinc(10 mg-15 mg), Vitamin A (500-750 microgram RE), Vitamin B1 (1 mg-1.5 mg), Vitamin B2 (1.25 mg-1.75 mg), Vitamin B3 (12.5 mg-20 mg) and Vitamin B6 (1.5 mg-2.5 mg) per kg.

The goal included taking all Central schemes to saturation levels, like the piped water project, banking inclusion, LPG gas connection, Ayushman Bharat, fortified rice for nutrition and bridging the urban-rural divide. He underscored the political will to usher in reforms and hand-hold socially vulnerable sections and the startup eco-system, which he described as the new wealth creators. Modi also shared that the government had abolished 15,000 compliances during the Covid-19 pandemic itself for hassle-free services to the citizens.  Expanding his slogan of Sabka Sath, Sabka Vikas, to which he had earlier added Sabka Vishwas, Modi sought Sabka Prayas (everyones effort), as the nation enters its Amrit Kaal of 25 years leading to the 100th year of Independence celebrations.  Staying with the Atmanirbhar Bharat (self-reliance) theme, Modi said the government will unveil a PM Gati Shakti scheme for an integrated master plan for infrastructure projects and the National Hydrogen Mission to make India a global hub of clean hydrogen and self-reliant in energy needs. With the Gati Shakti scheme, the government aims to accelerate the already announced five-year infrastructure spending of over `1 lakh crore to scale up the economy.  Turning to education, he said Sainik schools will now enroll girl students after a successful pilot project in Mizoram. On the commemoration of the Independence Day celebrations for the next 75 weeks, Modi said 75 Vande Bharat trains will connect all parts of the country.  Without naming China and Pakistan, the prime minister reiterated that India is steadfastly dealing with the twin global challenges of expansionism and terrorism. There is a possibility of a new world order post-Corona. Today the world is looking at India from a new perspective, which has two important aspects, one is terrorism and the other is expansionism. India is confronting both and responding strongly in a restrained manner, he said. J&K got a passing mention, with Modi saying the delimitation exercise there is underway along with preparations for Assembly polls.","Modi sets 25-year goal for growth, minimising government intervention",RICE

Led by Chief Minister MK Stalin, the single motto of the government has been delivering services to the people at the earliest. In a nutshell, Stalin has proved his mettle.  Just two months after assuming power, while chairing the meeting of the Economic Advisory Council composed of world-renowned experts, Stalin made his ambitions very clear and indicated that he has the political will to take hard decisions to put the State economy back on track.  ""Employment opportunities should increase in Tamil Nadu. Per capita income should go up while the social status of the people should improve. The economic growth of the State should be inclusive. I know, these dreams cannot be realised through ordinary reforms.

Vowing to make Tamil Nadu the most investor-friendly State in entire South Asia, Stalin said the objective is to turn Tamil Nadu into an 'One Trillion Dollar Economy' by 2030. Despite the slowdown in global economy due to the pandemic, Stalins government has signed 35 new industrial agreements with an investment of Rs 17,141 crore.  He has also inaugurated five new ventures worth Rs 7,117 crore and laid the foundation stone for nine industries worth Rs 4,250 crore at the investors meet held in the city recently. These investments would create 83,000 new jobs. To support industrial growth, orders have been issued for the release of capital subsidies to self-financed projects in a single instalment instead of three.  The DMK government rolled out several initiatives to minimise the hardships faced by the people due to lockdown measures. Rice ration card holders were given 14 varieties of essential commodities and an estimated two crore cardholders got Rs 4,000 as relief fund.  Temple priests were given Rs 4,000 by way of monetary assistance besides free essential commodities. The price of Aavin milk was cut by Rs 3/litre while women passengers were allowed to travel free in city transport buses.  Those affected by COVID have been allowed treatment at private hospitals at government expense. Arrangements have been made for people to get the Corona vaccine through district health centres across the State.  Stalin had allocated Rs 25 crore to curb black fungus while Rs 100 crore has been allocated to prevent the third wave.

According to Food Departments records, 91 per cent beneficiaries have collected their share of wheat and rice meant for the month of July. The department has extended the July sales till August 20.  Usually, the ration distribution drive begins around the 10th of a month. In July, the delay was attributed to the preparations for the roll-out of the One Nation One Ration Card (ONORC) scheme.  A total of 12,238 transactions took place under ONORC, as per which PDS beneficiaries with ration cards registered in other states can collect their share from fair price shops in Delhi itself. Out of 12,238, people from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh accounted for 6,612 and 4,952 transactions respectively.  In August, the PDS transactions for those availing ONORC benefits were opened in Delhi and 2,584 transactions have already taken place. However, regular card holders are still waiting for a green signal to the ration dealers from the Food Department.  The stock for the month of August has not even reached many shops yet. Every month, the distribution drive is getting delayed. For people who depend on PDS, the delay causes many hardships, Public Distribution System Welfare Association president Shailendra Kumar said.

The families, belonging to the Dalit community, who once led a content life in their village, 20 km from here, were driven away from their houses for allegedly refusing to obey the diktats ordered by upper-caste villagers.  Their home, Brahmapur, a settlement on an island in Chilika, now seems like a distant dream. As per custom, members of the Dalit community were expected to carry the palanquin in wedding processions of upper-caste families and escort the groom or bride around the village, in return for a meal at the wedding. In 2013, young men from the community refused to carry the palanquin. What followed, eventually drove them out of their own homes.  Also Read | Opinion: Why Dalit is no longer an empowering word for some marginalised communities in UP  After we refused to carry the palanquin, our access to fish in Chilika was prohibited. For ages, our source of livelihood has been fishing and all of a sudden we were denied our rights of livelihood. This led to the first-ever migration from our community in our village. Young men just out of school started migrating to Chennai, Bengaluru to search for work. Others started working as farm labourers in nearby villages, said 33-year old Sangram Bhoi.  In February 2021, a major brawl between the communities ensued after a 25-year-old man from the Dalit community, in an inebriated state, reached the village to buy sweets from a hawker and was confronted by upper caste men for his drunken state. Following this, a new diktat was ordered and members of the Dalit community were prohibited from entering the village, from carrying out any procession or inviting their relatives to the village. The ration shops were permanently closed for them, access to the only potable well and the village pond for bathing and washing clothes was denied and they were not allowed to ferry in the boats, the only access to the mainland from the small island hamlet.  Their only condition was that we start carrying the palanquin again but with no remuneration. Our generation and the generation after is getting educated. We are trying to redefine ourselves and move ahead, be more aware and stand up for rights. How could we agree to a regressive practice again that would put us back in the position from where we wanted to rise? Sangram said.  Women from Brahmapur village take shelter under a temporary arrangement in Nathapur village where they have temporarily rehabilitated themselves. Women from Brahmapur village take shelter under a temporary arrangement in Nathapur village where they have temporarily rehabilitated themselves.  Janak Jena, an upper-caste member, reacting to the allegations said, The allegations are not true. They have raised objections to us entering their areas but expect us to be ok that they will fish from Chilka and rob us of our livelihoods. They own no land which is why they have been imposing themselves on us.  The community members claim that despite repeated pleas with the administration, there has been no solution in sight. When contacted Puri District Collector, Samarth Verma said that an enquiry into the matter has already been initiated. The issue is caste-based and also livelihood-based. We have held consultations with the villagers and are looking into the matter. We expect to resolve the matter soon.  Sangram with the support of other young Dalit activists from the entire district, is now putting up a fight to reclaim their right to live in their village. Like Sangram, in the recent past Puri has witnessed a lot of young members of the Dalit community, and other backward castes, associated with various organisations or working individually, but together creating a network, looking for such families driven out of their villages and trying to bring them back.  A lot of people fear that if they return to the village, they will again be subjected to violence, threats and social boycott. We wish to create a safe place for them within their village, which is rightfully theirs. A lot of families are more than willing to return to their village and lead a life of dignity. It will only be possible if we as a community stand together, said Dibakar Barik, 35, another youth activist. Dibakar and his family were themselves driven out of their village two decades ago after his father refused to follow norms established by the upper castes.

The bamboo houses under construction in Nathapur village where the Dalit families from Bhrampur have shifted on a temporary basis.  I am a graduate, my brother is also studying well, and my sister is a journalism graduate. My father knew that if he wanted his children to pursue and become what they wanted to, he had to give up obeying orders and leading the kind of life he led. Because we had to leave behind our village, a bag full of memories from the place we were born in, I understand the pain that these families go through, when driven out of their own villages for trying to lead a life of dignity, Dibakar said.  Amongst the families which Dibakar is helping to return to their village, is Maheshwar Bariks family who were driven out of their house in March 2019, their houses vandalised. Members of the barber (barik) and the washerman community (dhoba), who fall under the Other Backward Castes (OBCs), continue to face social ostracism for refusing to abide by the age-old bartan system or jajmani system, wherein the members of these communities were expected to be of service to the upper caste, either free of cost or in return of 12-15 kgs of rice a year.  After the Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act, 1976, enquiries were initiated after 2010 into these cases and after thorough enquiry nearly 2,200 people from Puri were awarded a release certificate from the bonded system. Over 2,500 others are still waiting for their release orders.  A woman roasting flattened rice for lunch in Nathapur. A woman roasting flattened rice for lunch in Nathapur.  In 2013, we received a release letter from the administration, we were no longer bound to work in return for paddy. But all these years, there was no peace. We had nowhere to go; so we stayed in the village, but time and again we faced social boycott. In March, our house was vandalised as we continued to refuse to work so we left our village, Maheswar said. Maheshwars family was one amongst three driven out of Manapur village. The familys bondage to the upper caste families involved washing their feet, cutting their nails, picking up leftovers, cleaning a place before and after an event, among other trivial tasks. Maheshwar along with nearly 20 other such families were staging a dharna outside the collectors office last Friday.  There are over 100 such families who wish to return to their respective villages. They can claim what is rightfully theirs only when they are well aware of their rights. Many of them out of fear do not even approach the officials. But we have been trying to apprise them about their rights, about the laws which can protect them, so they can fight for themselves. Education will always play an important role in uplifting them, Dibakar said. For most Dalit and OBC families, such forced migration over decades has rendered them landless, eliminating any prospects for entitlement under housing schemes or even cyclone relief assistance.  Responding to such instances, the Puri collector said no such incident has been brought to his notice. If anyone is being asked to leave their villages or is being discriminated against even after possessing the release certificate, they can approach us and necessary action will be taken. So far, no such information has come to me, Verma said.","Forced to flee their villages for revolt against a caste custom in Puri, Dalit families head back",RICE
2021-08-22,https://indianexpress.com/article/world/vietnam-war-victims-wanted-justice-they-were-given-30-bags-of-rice-7465212/,"Written by Choe Sang-Hun  The South Korean marine unit had a reputation for leaving nothing breathing behind when they passed through hostile territory, not even a pig suckling its litter.  After the unit swept through Phong Nhi and Phong Nhut, villages in central Vietnam, on Feb. 12, 1968, scores of bodies were found, all unarmed civilians, most of them children and women, shot or stabbed with bayonets.  This old man came out of a hiding hole, his hands held up, recalled Ryu Jin-seong, a former marine attached to the unit who was 22 at the time. He kept begging for life, apparently thinking he would be killed when he was taken away.  In a fit of rage, a sergeant swore and emptied his clip on the man, Ryu said.  The tragedy of the Vietnam War  echoing loudly this past week during the chaotic U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan  continues to haunt those victims who witnessed and survived the two decades of bloodshed.  Nearly a half-century after the war ended, victims of the massacre at Phong Nhi and Phong Nhut are seeking compensation from the Seoul government in the first lawsuit of its kind being tried in a South Korean court.  Stung by shocking testimony, South Korean lawmakers and civic groups are also pushing for a special law to investigate long-held allegations that South Korean troops killed thousands of civilians when they were the largest foreign contingent fighting alongside U.S. soldiers during the war.  I have never been free from the nightmare of the day when South Korean troops came to our village, said Nguyen Thi Thanh, 61, who lost five relatives, including her mother, sister and brother, and was herself wounded in Phong Nhi in 1968. But the South Korean government has never once visited our village and never once asked us what happened.  South Korea sent 320,000 troops, billing them as anti-Communist crusaders. In return for its contribution, it won U.S. aid that helped build the national economy. But rumors have long persisted that South Korean troops committed mass killings of Vietnamese civilians.  Discussions of the topic had been a taboo under the past military dictatorship. But as South Korea enjoyed a greater freedom of press in the late 1990s, more outlets began publishing stories about the alleged civilian massacres. The one in Phong Nhi and Phong Nhut was the most documented.  The U.S. military investigated what happened just days after the killings occurred, according to declassified U.S. documents.  According to the documents, U.S. Marines and South Vietnamese militiamen operating in Dien Ban, Quang Nam province, heard firing and saw huts burning after the South Korean marine unit moved into Phong Nhi and Phong Nhut. The Americans and South Vietnamese assisted villagers fleeing with wounds. They later visited Phong Nhi to find piles of bodies, including a child and pregnant woman shot in the head at close range and a young woman who was still alive and had her breast cut off, the documents said.  One of the U.S. Marines took pictures.  More than 70 villagers died in the attack, according to the U.S. documents and recent testimony from survivors.  The victims of this incident were defenseless civilians, the great majority of which were women and children, who were murdered as they plead for their lives, Major John M. Campanelli, a U.S. Marine investigator, wrote in the declassified documents Feb. 18, 1968. He added that in an attempt to placate the survivors and relatives of the dead and wounded, the executive officer of the South Korean Marine battalion offered his apologies and provided 30 bags of rice to the District Chief.  By April 1968, U.S. military investigators concluded that there was some probability that a war crime was committed and shared the information with the top South Korean officer in Vietnam, Lt. Gen. Chae Myung-shin. Chae responded by claiming that the massacre was an act conspired and mercilessly elected by the Communists.  South Korean veterans told a different story.  Ryu said there was a standing order that if marines received even small fire, they should trace its origin and destroy everything they found, even unarmed civilians, to instill fear among the enemy. The task of demonstrating cruelty often fell into units nicknamed killer companies, including Ryus, he said. The attack in Phong Nhi and Phong Nhut started after small fire from near the villages injured a South Korean marine, according to the U.S. documents.  The U.S. military reopened its case in late 1969 after the RAND Corporation, in one of its studies, uncovered allegations of brutality by South Korean troops against Vietnamese civilians. It was around this time that the South Korean intelligence agency began questioning members of the marine unit about the massacre, former officers told South Korean media in 2000. At least one of the officers gave an account similar to that of Ryu.  There is no evidence that Washington or Seoul pursued the matter further. Instead, the U.S. military was accused by refugees and student researchers in the United States of suppressing evidence of civilian atrocities carried out by South Korean forces.  After South Korea and Vietnam opened diplomatic ties in 1992, South Korean visitors encountered Vietnamese villagers who remembered the atrocities of South Korean troops. One study by a South Korean researcher, based on interviews with survivors and witnesses from the villages, reported that dozens of alleged mass killings carried out by South Korean troops left as many as 9,000 Vietnamese civilians dead.  In 2015, Nguyen and another woman became the first Vietnamese victims to visit South Korea to share their stories. In 2019, with the help of South Korean civic groups, she and 102 people from 17 Vietnamese villages petitioned President Moon Jae-in of South Korea for an investigation and apology. Last year, Nguyen filed a lawsuit against the Seoul government.  South Korea maintains that it has found no evidence of civilian killings in its wartime records. When lawyers demanded that the intelligence agency make public the results of its reported investigation of marines in 1969, it refused, saying that it could neither confirm nor deny whether an investigation took place.",Vietnam war victims wanted justice.

2021-08-23,https://indianexpress.com/article/india/kerala/in-kozhikodes-sm-street-traders-anger-against-covid-protocols-resonates-across-state-7466369/,"Theres a reason why press photographers in Keralas ancient beach town of Kozhikode rush to the fabled SM Street, locally known as Mittai Theruvu, to capture the holiday spirit during festivals like Onam, Bakrid and Vishu. The two-km-long cobbled street in the heart of the city with shops flanking either side, sells everything from clothes, footwear, clocks to coir products, handicrafts and the very popular halwa in all sorts of colours. As thousands cram onto the street, from solo shoppers to couples and large families, a photographer is guaranteed the perfect holiday picture. And they almost always appear on the front-pages of newspapers the next day.  The flip-side to that is during times of uncertainty and upheaval, SM street attracts attention and controversy first. Free publicity during good times comes at a cost, admitted Navas Koyissery, the local president of the Kerala Vyapari Vyavasayi Samithi, an influential traders body in the state.  During the complete lockdown imposed by the state government to combat the second wave and a slew of tight restrictions in June and July, when Covid-19 infections dipped a bit only to rise again, SM Street came under heavy scrutiny of the police and the district administration. For weeks, the CPM-led government tested out a policy, that several experts called scientifically flawed, of placing areas under lockdown according to the weekly test positivity rate of the local body they fell under. As a result, SM Street, which falls under the densely-populated Kozhikode Corporation, often did not satisfy the rules for opening up and shops there remained shuttered for days on end. For the citys residents, the sight of their beloved SM Street without its usual mix of traders, buyers and passersby was moving.  On July 12, the traders of SM Street exploded in protest and gathered in large numbers, shouting anti-government slogans. They questioned the duplicity of the restrictions  why shops selling essential items, bakeries and retail liquor outlets were allowed while rest of the establishments had to remain shut for most of the week. And how, when such establishments open once a week, theyre often overwhelmed by a barrage of customers leading to crowding and violation of protocols.  For a trader, a customer is king. And when they come, I cant ask them to stand for a bit outside while the others shop. If I am harsh with them, theyll never enter my shop again. Ill lose my business, pointed out Koyissery, who runs a shop selling womens clothes.  Thats why we asked the administration to allow us to open for longer hours five days a week. This way, the flow of customers can be regulated.  The market in the citys centre is home to nearly 1000 shops selling everything from clothes to footwear to sweets and jewellery.

(Express Photo by Vishnu Varma)  He said an earlier system, implemented during the first wave last year, of wards categorised as containment zones and micro-containment zones was perfect. Clamping down on such areas at the local level and barring the residents there to move about was successful to a large extent in checking disease transmission and deflecting any impact on retail business.  On the evening of August 4, under pressure from trade bodies, health experts and the political Opposition, the state government threw out the TPR-based lockdown mechanism, replacing it with a system based on weekly infection population ratio (WIPR). It is the number of cases reported in a week in a local body, adjusted to its population. If its higher than a certain threshold, the administration can place restrictions there. But the new order of the government came with a strange rider: those going to the shops must produce a vaccination certificate or an RT-PCR negative result not older than 72 hours.  A day later, the Opposition UDF was up in arms on the floor of the state Assembly. What a travesty! A person, in order to buy a kilogram of rice for Rs 60, has to get a Covid-10 test by paying Rs 600, mocked a Congress MLA. However, Health Minister Veena George refused to withdraw the rider, saying it was necessary to prevent crowds in shopping areas.  Its not practical at all, said Binoy Varghese, who runs a shop selling antique jewellery on SM Street. Politicians and bureaucrats frame such policies sitting in Thiruvananthapuram without taking traders like us into confidence.  Such ill-thought rules, he said, push shoppers further away from the retail trade in Kerala into the arms of the e-commerce giants who have enormously profited from the pandemic. Varghese would know. Shortly after the first wave last year, he had to shut down his shop, unable to bear the steep loss in business, sky-high rent and staff salaries.  For the citys residents, the sight of their beloved SM Street without its usual mix of traders, buyers and passersby was moving.

(Express Photo by Vishnu Varma)  As he did not know any other work, he returned to business, this time with a partner to split the investment with, in February this year. And then came the second wave and two months of complete lockdown. It was a very bad situation, he summed up.  As weddings and other social functions are either getting postponed indefinitely or pared down to tiny rituals, the demand for jewellery has gone down. While big jewellery chains have enough capital to survive, small-timers like Varghese are fast depleting their savings. His wife, earlier a homemaker, now helps out at the shop. His younger son, just out of high school, is preparing to sit out of college this year as he understands his father wont be able to pay a donation of Rs 2 lakh to the college he hoped to get admitted to.  Earlier, we would build houses and buy cars from the profits of our business. Today, we are selling our homes and cars to run our business, rued Varghese.

(Express Photo by Vishnu Varma)  Haleel, who runs a readymade textiles shop on SM Street in a partnership, said, Big e-commerce firms like Amazon are doing business worth crores. All of that money is going outside the country. What about us who contribute to this country by helping the money stay here? The government is not thinking right.  Haleel had taken a loan from a co-operative bank to invest in his shop and he hasnt been able to pay the EMIs for over six months. Theyre calling every month but I dont know what to tell them.  SM Street in Kozhikode, in many ways, is therefore a microcosm of the anger and desperation within the small and medium business sector in Kerala, rattled by the pandemic. If demonetisation and GST have weakened the sector considerably, the pandemic has been the severest blow of all. If other states have opened up fuelled by the gradual decrease in infections there, Kerala remains an outlier with the end of the pandemic nowhere in sight. That means, restrictions, in one way or the other, are here to stay, casting a gloomy shadow over the local economy.  Every time Kerala has faced a challenge, be it the Nipah outbreak, the floods and now the pandemic, lakhs of small and medium-scale traders have played a key role in the rebuilding process. Its the onus of the government therefore to protect us. They must not forget it, said Koyissery.

The scarce containers bore a printed message: Courtesy of Senator Franky Exius.  The 7.2-magnitude earthquake that rocked southern Haiti on Aug. 14, killing 2,200 people, struck a country already in crisis, with few legitimately elected officials and a paralyzed, unpopular and underfunded caretaker administration.  In the absence of a concerted state relief effort, prominent Haitian politicians have tried to fill the gap, flying out the injured on their private planes, delivering medical supplies and food and even handing out cash.  With general elections on the horizon, their personal initiatives have taken on political overtones, and the epicenter has in effect become a campaign launchpad for some of Haitis presidential and congressional hopefuls.  In the capital, Port-au-Prince, the politicians efforts have raised difficult questions about the fine line between offering urgently needed aid and cynically exploiting the suffering.  The disaster zone has become a terrain for political exercise, said Fritz Jean, a public policy expert in Port-au-Prince. If you look at the aid they are giving, its a repugnant political campaign.  Politicians here have a record of exploiting natural disasters for personal gain. After Hurricane Matthews landfall in Haiti coincided with the presidential campaign in 2016, candidates flooded the area with donated water bottles and boxes of matches plastered with their faces.  Jovenel Mose, who served as president until he was assassinated in his home last month, cemented his campaign lead by delivering a shipment of rice to hurricane survivors shortly before the vote. The bags of rice bore his party slogans, angering community leaders.  Moses death left without a president, a functioning Parliament or a Supreme Court. Although general elections are officially scheduled for Nov. 7, the caretaker prime minister, Ariel Henry, says the country first needs to tackle pervasive gang violence and appoint a new electoral board.  Since Moses killing, members of Haitis elite have been jockeying for power, visiting Washington and interviewing and hiring American lobbyists in moves widely seen as explorations of electoral bids.  The aid provided by former elected officials has contrasted with the largely ineffectual relief effort mounted thus far by the Haitian government.","In Haiti, need is overwhelming, but some politicians’ charity rings false",RICE

Vietnam implemented movement restrictions in Ho Chi Minh City in early July, but announced its harshest curbs last week as infections have continued to surge. Authorities have said enforcement of recent curbs has not been sufficiently strict.  After containing Covid-19 for much of last year, Vietnam has recorded 358,456 infections and at least 8,666 fatalities. Ho Chi Minh City has recorded over 180,000 infections  half the countrys total  and 7,010 deaths, making up about 80% of the nations fatalities, according to the health ministry.  Most of those cases have been recorded in Ho Chi Minh City and its surrounding industrial provinces, where the Delta variant of the virus has sent numbers soaring since late April.  The government said on Friday a tighter lockdown would begin on Monday, prohibiting people from leaving their homes, even for food, and said the military would step in to help.  The announcement, later amended so that people in some areas could still shop for food, was subsequently reverted to a total ban, triggering confusion and panic-buying at supermarkets in the city over the weekend.  Witnesses said soldiers were delivering food to residents of the city on Monday and images broadcast by state media showed armed soldiers manning checkpoints and checking documents.  Vietnam has over recent weeks sent 14,600 additional doctors and nurses to the city and its neighbouring provinces to support its overwhelmed medical system, the ministry said.  Patients with mild or no symptoms have been told to self isolate at home.  The government said on Friday it would send 130,000 tonnes of rice from state stockpiles to Ho Chi Minh City and 23 other cities and provinces. People in the citys Phu Nhuan and Go Vap districts told Reuters they had received packages of rice, meat, fish and vegetables from the military.  Vietnam received two shipments of 501,600 AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine doses from Poland and 200,000 Sinopharm doses donation from China on Monday, the government said.

Instead, hes at his in-laws home in Vythiri, Wayanad, restless and anxious about his future. All of July, he has worked only eight or nine days. The wages of Rs 500 per day are grossly insufficient to meet the expenses of his family.  Two months ago, his wifes mother took up the job of a home-nurse in Kozhikode city to do her bit. The family has to pay back a huge bank loan taken to build their house. His wife Athira, who has completed a course in accountancy, is preparing for the hard-to-crack Public Service Commission (PSC) exams that lakhs of people in Kerala sit for every year.  Obviously, Covid and the subsequent lockdowns have made life extremely difficult. Work is hard to come by these days and we have to save every penny, said Athira, 21, who belongs to the Scheduled Caste (SC) community. Often we buy certain things for the home on installments. And due to the present situation, we are unable to pay the installments. Its really painful to see the shopkeepers arrive at our home and take back those things we bought. They say hurtful things, she sighed.  Aneesh KB, his wife Athira and their daughter at his in-laws home in Kunhangode colony in Vythiri, Wayanad. (Express photo by Vishnu Varma) Aneesh KB, his wife Athira and their daughter at his in-laws home in Kunhangode colony in Vythiri, Wayanad. (Express photo by Vishnu Varma)  Since their home is located in the interiors of a hill, accessing an auto-rickshaw or a jeep for emergency purposes at night is another daunting task, she said. The drivers charge hefty rates to come here. We cannot afford it. It would have been great to have an ambulance.  A few hundred metres away, in the same Kunhangode colony, 35-year-old Girish KV, who belongs to the Paniya tribal community, rarely finds work these days. A daily-wage construction worker, he barely got 5-6 days of labour in July and doesnt have big hopes for August as well.  Its a terrifying situation, he said. If not for the 30 kg of rice we get from the ration shop a month and the governments Onam food kit, we would be starving.  The rise in prices of materials like cement, steel and crushed stone and low demand and prices for agricultural products have greatly affected the construction and farming sectors, which are two major employment sectors for daily-wagers like Girish in Wayanad district. Demand for manual labour on the tea and coffee estates, hit by over two months of lockdown and subsequent containment restrictions, has also dimmed considerably, he said.

(Express photo by Vishnu Varma) Girish KV in front of his govt-built home in Kunhangode colony. The pandemic has wiped away his work-days. His immediate concern is the leaking roof of his home. (Express photo by Vishnu Varma)  His immediate concern, said Girish, was the leaking roof of his humble government-built house. With minimal savings in hand, he cannot undertake any major repairs at the moment. Temporarily, he has put up a tarpaulin sheet over the roof to ward off the rain, but it doesnt offer much help. During heavy showers, water enters our bedroom, he said.  In Dalit and tribal settlements like this and across Kerala, the pandemic and its accompanying economic challenges threatens to bog down considerable progress achieved over the years. While the current Left governments welfare schemes, in the form of essential food kits and pensions, come in for high praise from the public, theres no denying that the slump in the unorganised sector and rising unemployment pose great risks for the states most marginalised sections.  In contrast to other states in India which have largely brought down the infection curve allowing them to open up their markets and economy, Kerala has been an outlier where cases have stubbornly refused to come down. A recent sero-prevalence survey showed that more than half of the states population are at risk of catching the virus. This means that the pandemic is set to move along a long plateau in the state, continuing the cycle of local lockdowns, quarantines and movement restrictions.  In fact, in villages with large tribal settlements, officials are taking no chance with the virus. In Poothadi, Mercy Sabu, the panchayat president, said as soon as a positive case is detected in a tribal colony, the patient is immediately shifted to a domiciliary care centre (DCC) set up at a local school where they can be quarantined properly. In tribal colonies, families are large and theres heavy social interaction. The disease can spread easily. We cant afford to put them in quarantine in their own houses so we move them to DCC and release them after 17 days, she said.  The bottleneck that the panchayat is facing, she stressed, with respect to the tribals was the delay in the MGNREGA payments. This could be hurting the families at a time of great financial upheaval. While the payments for the general category beneficiaries have been cleared, those for STs are still pending across the state. When we checked with higher-ups, they said it was a server issue and would be resolved soon, she said.  Prasad AM, an ST ward-member in Poothadi, disagreed with the view that the pandemic would bring long-term consequences for the community. For the tribals, income-generation is not aimed at tomorrow, its for today. Thats why a delay in MGNREGA payments is serious. On the government front too, schemes are mostly aimed at poverty alleviation, rather than social development on a bigger scale. Thats why I doubt if there will be long-term effects of Covid, he said.  G Pramod, the tribal development officer in Mananthavady, Wayanad, admitted that the pandemic has cut back jobs for the community, slashing household incomes. Were trying to do as much as we can through providing more work-days through MGNREGA and supplying food and vegetable kits to colonies in need. Additionally, as an Onam gift, the government has declared a one-time assistance of Rs 1000 to all tribals above the age of 60.

Delivering her customary address in Tamil to the territorial Assembly on the opening day of the budget session (2021-2022) in Puducherry, she said she was confident that Puducherry would certainly be free from the coronavirus pandemic soon with the cooperation of the government machinery and the people.  Soundararajan said she wanted to reiterate that the people of the union territory had voted for the government with high expectations and hoped that all the Members of the House under the able guidance of the Chief Minister would work hard to fulfil their expectations and Puducherry prosperous, free from poverty and unemployment in course of time.  Puducherry had also borne the brunt of the pandemic. But the government acted swiftly and made all possible efforts to contain the spread of the virus and it is heartening to see that the Covid-19 positive cases have come down drastically now, she said.  She expressed her gratitude and appreciation amidst thumping of desks by the members to all frontline workers including medical officers, revenue staff, municipal staff and other officials for their dedicated service.  The Lt Governor urged the people of Puducherry not to be complacent and appealed to them to continue to adopt the precautionary measures without any let-up.  Highlighting the implementation of schemes by various departments, she said that under the National Food Security Act 2013, the government of Puducherry had implemented Direct Benefit Transfer and assistance under the Universal Public Distribution System is given through the DBI in all the four regions of the union territory.  A motion of thanks to the Lt Governors address was tabled by AINRC legislator A K D Arumugam and seconded by K S P Ramesh (AINRC).

2021-08-26,https://indianexpress.com/article/world/chinese-citizen-who-documented-wuhan-outbreak-falls-ill-in-prison-hunger-strike-7471572/,"A Chinese citizen journalist who was imprisoned for exposing the failures of the governments initial response to the coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan is seriously ill from a hunger strike, according to messages from her family shared by her former lawyer and a friend.  The journalist, Zhang Zhan, 37, had traveled to Wuhan from her home in Shanghai and spent the early days of the outbreak documenting the citys strict lockdown and the severe impact it had on residents livelihoods and freedoms.  Zhangs reports challenged the governments efforts to portray its response as competent and caring. She was convicted last year of picking quarrels and provoking trouble, a vague charge often used to target dissent, and sentenced to four years in prison after a three-hour, closed-door trial.  Zhang began a hunger strike after her arrest in May of last year. Her lawyers previously said that authorities had used a feeding tube to feed her and restrained her hands. Her mother, Shao Wenxia, described it as a partial hunger strike, with Zhang eating fruit and cookies but not meat, rice or vegetables.  The journalist appeared at her trial in December in a wheelchair, and one of her lawyers said then that she had already lost significant weight and that her appearance had vastly changed from just a few weeks earlier.  Zhang, who is 5 feet 10 inches tall and weighed about 165 pounds before her arrest, now weighs less than 90 pounds, according to a message Shao sent to her former lawyer, Zhang Keke. He shared the message with The New York Times.  Zhangs mother has not been able to see her in person since her arrest because authorities have refused to let her visit, Zhang Keke said. Shao said in the message that her daughter was hospitalized on July 31, and that her family was permitted to speak with her by phone on Aug. 2. She returned to prison on Aug. 11.  She still insisted that she is not guilty, and will not eat regularly, Shao wrote. Zhang was suffering from a gastric ulcer and was so weak that she needed help getting up, her mother said in another message to Zhang Keke. Shao could not be reached for comment.  An official at the Shanghai Prison Administration Bureau, when reached by telephone on Tuesday, confirmed that Zhang had returned to Shanghai Womens Prison after receiving medical treatment, but declined to answer further questions about her condition.  Thus far, Zhang has not responded to pleas from her family to resume eating normally.  Our first hope is that she can stop her hunger strike, said Peng Yonghe, a Chinese lawyer and a friend of Zhangs. Second, we hope that she can come out as soon as possible.  Peng cautioned that it was unlikely that Zhangs condition would lead to early release. While the Chinese system does allow for medical parole, conditions brought about by a hunger strike would not qualify, he said.  Human rights activists have raised fears that if Zhangs health does not improve she could share the fate of other Chinese dissidents who have died in custody.  She might actually die in prison, said Wang Jianhong, who directs the U.S.-based rights group Humanitarian China. It is not groundless because weve seen so many previous examples.  Cao Shunli, who had demanded that an official human rights report that China submitted to the United Nations include citizen voices, died of a lung infection in 2014. Her family said she had been denied timely medical treatment. Liu Xiaobo, who won the Nobel Peace Prize while in prison, died of liver cancer while under guard in a hospital in 2017.  Zhang had declined to appeal her conviction, telling her lawyers that she refused to acknowledge the validity of the legal process used to imprison her.  She was the first citizen journalist tried for challenging the official narrative of Chinas pandemic response. Others including Chen Qiushi and Li Zehua were detained and reportedly later released, although Mr. Chen appears to be under surveillance. The whereabouts of another, Fang Bin, remains unclear.  News outlets in China are strictly controlled by the government, and social media platforms like Weibo censor sensitive subjects. But in the early days of the pandemic, when the authorities were distracted with controlling the outbreak, some citizen journalists, working independently, chipped away at the official narrative of a heroic response.  While in Wuhan, the city where the coronavirus first emerged, Zhang posted videos that showed how the outbreak had overwhelmed a hospital and a crematory. She showed how the citys severe lockdown had forced businesses to close and driven the prices of vegetables up.  After a city official said residents should be taught how to properly express their gratitude to the government, she interviewed people on the streets about whether they felt thankful.  Were adults, she said. We dont need to be taught.  In what turned out to be her last video before her detention, she criticized what she saw as unduly harsh means of enforcing the lockdown on Wuhan.  The governments way of managing this city has just been intimidation and threats, she said.

2021-08-27,https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/vegetable-oils-november-october-solvent-extractors-association-of-india-7474562/,"India produced 93.18 lakh tonnes (lt) of vegetable oils in 2020-21 (November-October), as against 85.38 lt and 76.87 lt in the previous two years. But despite this record output, as estimated by the Solvent Extractors Association of India, the country will end up importing some 133 lt, from the 155.49 lt of the 2018-19 oil year. Simply put, India imports anywhere from nearly 60 per cent to over two-thirds of its vegetable oil requirement, depending on how good the rains are, entailing an annual foreign exchange outgo of $10-11 billion. It is in this context that one must view the Narendra Modi governments new National Mission on Edible Oils-Oil Palm. The scheme aims at increasing the total area under oil palm from the current 3.5 lakh hectares (lh) to 10 lh by 2025-26. Growers would be entitled to a minimum viability price for their fresh fruit bunches (FFB) production, which is 14.3 per cent of the last five-year-average crude palm oil (CPO) price adjusted for wholesale inflation.  The focus on oil palm is not misplaced as it is a crop that can yield 20-25 tonnes of FFBs per hectare, translating into 4-5 tonnes of CPO. No other oilseed can give so much: Mustard and groundnut yields arent more than 2-3 tonne per hectare and the oil recovery from that only at 35-40 per cent. No realistic plan of reducing import dependence in edible oils  to, say, 30-40 per cent from the existing 60-70 per cent  is possible without recognising the role of oil palm. Out of Indias annual 130-150 lt vegetable oil imports, 80-90 mt is accounted for by palm oil alone.  That said, there are valid concerns over introducing oil palm in tropical rainforests or biodiversity-rich areas such as the Andaman & Nicobar Islands and the Northeast. The crop is probably better suited for states such as Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Odisha, where it can replace paddy and be grown using drip irrigation, mulching and other water-saving practices. India is anyway producing too much rice and any diversification must be welcomed. But the focus should, for now, be on states already cultivating oil palm. Farmers there have had a mixed experience with the crop that takes at least five years to grow and start yielding 20-25 tonnes of FFB/hectare. An assured viability price, protecting against fluctuations in global edible oil markets, should instil confidence among farmers in these states. Let them expand acreages first before others in more ecologically fragile regions.

While feeding is done leisurely during the off-days, on working days Mr. Poovappa completes it before leaving for duty around 9 a.m. We make it a point not to keep these animals starving. Care is also taken to ensure this food does not spoil their stomach, he said.  After dogs eat the food, Mr. Poovappa disposes of the newspapers in which the lunch is packed. Mr. Poovappa carries biscuit packets in his vehicle and feeds stray dogs at the Circuit House and the places he visits while on duty.  In addition to feeding, Mr. Poovappa takes care of stray dogs that are ill and provide them necessary medicine.  Asked about the money he spends every month on feeding and medical care, Mr. Poovappa said that he has not kept an account of it as these animals are part of my family. He adds that it roughly comes to around Rs. 14,000 per month.","Stray dogs, cats are close to them",RICE
2021-09-17,https://indianexpress.com/article/india/nirmala-sitharaman-restaurant-delivery-swiggy-zomato-7516636/,"Rate cuts for a number of cancer and Covid-related medicines and a shift in tax payment liability to restaurant delivery aggregators such as Swiggy, Zomato, and cloud kitchen operators instead of restaurants, were two of the key decisions taken by the Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council in its meeting in Lucknow on Friday.  The Council, which held an in-person meeting after 20 months, also decided to continue compensation cess levy only for repayment of borrowed amounts beyond June 2022.  A proposal to bring petroleum products under the indirect tax regime was discussed, but it was decided to keep the proposal out of its ambit for now.  Going ahead, the Council will look at rate rationalisation under the inverted duty structure, and compliance measures through e-way bill and composition schemes, for which two Groups of Ministers will be constituted.  Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said the rate-cut relief given in the previous Council meeting for Covid-related medicines such as Remdesivir, Tocilizumab, Amphotericin B, and anti-coagulants like Heparin will continue till December 31. However, the concessional tax for medical equipment will end on September 30.  The Council also decided to remove GST on the import of muscular atrophy drugs like Zolgensma and Viltepso, which cost crores of rupees, Sitharaman said. The GST rate for Keytruda, used for the treatment of cancer, has been cut to 5 per cent from 12 per cent.  Effective January 1 next year, the Council has decided to make e-commerce operators engaged in restaurant services liable for payment of tax. This will essentially shift the responsibility of paying the 5 per cent GST to the aggregators from the restaurants.  Food delivery operators like Swiggy who collect orders from restaurants and deliver (to customers); the place where the food is delivered will be the point on which tax will be collected by the gig groups Swiggy and others, Sitharaman said.  Explained | How the new GST structure impacts restaurants and food delivery apps  Revenue Secretary Tarun Bajaj said, There is no extra tax, there is no new tax. The tax was payable by restaurants, now instead of restaurants, the tax will be payable by aggregators which will alsoprevent revenue leakage.  The Council also decided to put an end date of June 2022 to the compensation mechanism, as mandated in law. The levy of compensation cess will continue from July 2022 onwards till March 2026 to service the borrowing, which had been resorted to in order to bridge the compensation gap in the years 2020-21 and 2021-22.  The debt for making compensation payments to states is estimated to be around Rs 2.7 lakh crore, a senior Finance Ministry official said.  Sitharaman said that at the previous GST Council meeting, it had been decided that beyond July 2022, the collection of cess would be for payment of loans taken.  That (compensation to states) ends with five years. The five-year (period) ends in July 2022. Beyond July 2022, the cess that we are collecting, as agreed in the 43rd Council meeting, was for the purpose of repaying the loan. That commences in July 2022, and goes on till March 2026  only and only for paying the loan given to states since last year, she said.  States were guaranteed compensation under GST for the revenue gap between actual collections and the protected amount based on 14 per cent compounded rate from base year 2015-16 for five years after the GST rollout, until June 2022. Last year, the government had decided to borrow to meet the compensation cess deficit through back-to-back loans to states.  For inclusion of fuel under GST, the Union Finance Minister said the Council discussed the issue only because the Kerala High Court had asked it, but felt it was not the right time to include petroleum products under GST.  It will be reported to the High Court of Kerala that it was discussed and the GST Council felt that it wasnt the time to bring the petroleum products into the GST, she said.  To correct the inverted duty structure, GST rate changes will be made for footwear and textiles sector, but the decision has been deferred for implementation till January 1 next year.  The Council also cut GST rates on fortified rice kernels to 5 per cent from 18 per cent, and on bio-diesel for blending in diesel to 5 per cent from 12 per cent. National permit fee for goods carriage has been exempted.  GST on ores and concentrates of metals such as iron, copper, aluminum, and zinc has been increased from 5 per cent to 18 per cent, and that on specified renewable energy devices and parts from 5 per cent to 12 per cent.  Cartons, boxes, bags, and packing containers of paper will now attract a uniform 18 per cent tax in place of the 12 per cent and 18 per cent rates. Waste and scrap of polyurethanes and other plastics will also see tax going up to 18 per cent from 5 per cent currently.  All kinds of pens will be charged an 18 per cent rate, while miscellaneous goods of paper like cards, catalogues, and printed material will see GST increasing to 18 per cent from 12 per cent. The rate for carbonated fruit beverages and carbonated beverages with fruit juice will attract a GST rate of 28 per cent, plus compensation cess of 12 per cent.  IGST of 12 per cent on import of medicines Zolgensma for spinal muscular atrophy and Viltepso for Duchenne muscular dystrophy, has been waived. These drugs cost up to Rs 16 crore.  IGST exemption has also been given on goods supplied at the Indo-Bangladesh border haats. Import of leased aircraft has also been exempted from payment of IGST.","Covid-19 medicines cheaper, food delivery firms liable for paying tax",RICE
2021-09-19,https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/sport-others/shraddha-talekar-gymnastics-world-championship-japan-7520528/,"Shraddha Talekar remembers long vacations in the city at her maternal uncles home in Thane. It was during one such trip that the uncle, Vishwas Gophan, packed her off to a gymnastics summer camp. Eighteen years on, the 27-year-old from rain-soaked Pedali village in Maharashtras coastal Raigad district, has made it to the India team for next months Artistic Gymnastics World Championship in Japan.  And, for her first chance to compete amongst the best, she thanks her supportive Mama (uncle)  and the special equipment he put together to pull her through the pandemic in remote Pedali.  During the lockdown, Talekar wondered if it was curtains on her career, after narrowly missing out on India selection six times by scores as low as 0.5 points in trials since 2013. Thats when Gophan, who is an environment activist and has been distributing cloth bags for free for years, fashioned a landing mat out of rags and castaway stage curtains and flags.  Shraddha Talekar trains on locally made gymnastic apparatus at her home at Pedali village Shraddha Talekar trains on locally made gymnastic apparatus at her home at Pedali village  The stadium where I train had hosted a Marathi Natya Sammelan some time back, so there were soft silk flags, stage curtains hanging unused. He collected all of them and stuffed them with several layers of rags and old cushions to stitch a makeshift landing mat to train, Talekar says.  In March 2020, when the lockdown was announced, Talekar feared that her dream to compete at the highest level might remain unfulfilled. Id missed out narrowly earlier, and was very disheartened. I was 26, and I could see my whole career ending as competitions got cancelled, but my family pushed me to stay on track, she says.  WATCH: Shraddha Talekar on her Uneven Bars routine  Having grown up in rural Raigad, gymnastics wouldnt have happened, if not for the summer camp. She was a late-starter at the age of nine, and though blessed with natural agility, medals in the junior category where most elite gymnasts firm up their career decisions were not on the horizon. My first competition in the sub-junior school nationals was on an open ground in Hubli, West Bengal. It was the best sight in my life, watching so many gymnasts compete even though I didnt win a medal, she says.  Facilities were primitive but for Talekar that was no less than a once-in-a-lifetime visit to Disneyland, she quips. Her first success came in 2011 with the state team gold at 12th National Games.  Trained at a state sports school, where movements on apparatus were broken down with weekly targets, Talekar won the Uneven Bars national gold in 2018. I had watched so many gymnasts leave the sport and get married or start office jobs. The anxiety of never making an international team used to affect my performance in competitions and a few times cost me selection. Id often go back home, half expecting to be told, now, enough. But my parents surprised me by telling me to first fulfill my dream of going to the World Championships, and not bother about marriage, she says.  Makeshift landing mat made out of rags and cast aside flags and curtains. Makeshift landing mat made out of rags and cast aside flags and curtains.  Talekar grew up in a joint family with her homemaker mother and father, who worked in a rice mill in the village. My mama (uncle) was a karate player, so he told my mother that my ambition had to be the World Championship or all these years were a waste. My brother is a trekker and free-spirited, so he was supportive. Plus, after Dipa Karmakar (Commonwealth medallist and first Indian female gymnast to compete in the Olympics), everything has changed in India and how we look at gymnastics, she says.  But to do a Karmakar, Talekar had to be in top shape. For a long time, she had ankle issues. Besides, the webbing of her big toe had a ping-pong sized gap, a result of repeated stress on the feet and dislocation. She used the lockdown to strengthen her legs and lug around home-made equipment  baby bars, improvised foam mat and a locally carved wooden balance beam-top for handstands.  Talekar training on baby bars and a wooden carved beam. Talekar training on baby bars and a wooden carved beam.  Meditation-backed visualisation and extensive strength work also helped in making the transition to real apparatus smooth once gymnasiums reopened. During the trials at Delhis Indira Gandhi Stadium, her double pike dismount on the bars felt seamless and that showed in the points  44.25 to go up to third in all-around standings.  Though the two Olympic gymnasts, Karmakar and Pranati Nayak, are out of action due to injuries and rehab, Talekar reckons she is at the peak of her own game. Its about staying motivated despite age and learning from younger gymnasts, too. I really look upto Uneven Bars Olympic champion Nina Derwael who won gold at Tokyo. Shes 21 and single-handedly pulled Belgium into the team finals, and her skills are stunning, she says.  Even as she nurses her disappointments at missing out all these years, Talekar finds calm in academics, and is on the verge of her fourth degree, including an MA in Economics besides pursuing a Masters in Physical Education. But its the World Championship where I want to give my everything. They say gymnastics is only for youngsters. But Ive never felt so ready to succeed, she says.","For India slot, gymnast Shraddha Talekar thanks her uncle and his homemade mat",RICE
2021-09-27,https://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-gets-first-herbicide-tolerant-launch-today-7538299/,"The Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI) has developed the countrys first-ever non-GM (genetically modified) herbicide-tolerant rice varieties that can be directly seeded and significantly save water and labour compared to conventional transplanting.  The varieties  Pusa Basmati 1979 and Pusa Basmati 1985  contain a mutated acetolactate synthase (ALS) gene making it possible for farmers to spray Imazethapyr, a broad-spectrum herbicide, to control weeds. This dispenses with the need to prepare nurseries where paddy seeds are first raised into young plants, before being uprooted and replanted 25-35 days later in the main field.  The two new varieties are scheduled to be officially released by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday.  Paddy transplantation is both labour- and water-intensive. The field where the seedlings are transplanted has to be puddled or tilled in standing water. For the first three weeks or so after transplanting, the plants are irrigated almost daily to maintain a water depth of 4-5 cm. Farmers continue giving water every two-three days even for the next four-five weeks when the crop is in tillering (stem development) stage.  Water is a natural herbicide that takes care of weeds in the paddy crops early-growth period. The new varieties simply replace water with Imazethapyr and theres no need for nursery, puddling, transplanting and flooding of fields. You can sow paddy directly, just like wheat, said A K Singh, director of IARI.  Imazethapyr, effective against a range of broadleaf, grassy and sedge weeds, cant be used on normal paddy, as the chemical does not distinguish between the crop and the invasive plants. The ALS gene in rice codes for an enzyme (protein) that synthesises amino acids for crop growth and development. The herbicide sprayed on normal rice plants binds itself to the ALS enzymes, inhibiting their production of amino acids.  The new basmati varieties contain an ALS gene whose DNA sequence has been altered using ethyl methanesulfonate, a chemical mutant. As a result, the ALS enzymes no longer have binding sites for Imazethapyr and amino acid synthesis isnt inhibited. The plants can also now tolerate application of the herbicide, and hence it kills only the weeds.  This is herbicide-tolerance through mutation breeding, not GM. There isnt any foreign gene here, Singh pointed out.  Both Pusa Basmati 1979 and 1985 have been bred by crossing existing popular varieties  Pusa 1121 and Pusa 1509, respectively  with Robin. The latter is a mutant line derived from Nagina 22, an upland drought-tolerant rice variety. The mutant was identified for Imazethapyr-tolerance by S Robin, a rice breeder from Tamil Nadu Agricultural University in Coimbatore.  Farmers in Punjab and Haryana are already adopting direct seeding of rice (DSR) in response to labour shortages and depleting water tables. This year alone, roughly 6 lakh of the total 44.3 lakh hectares area under paddy in the two states has come under DSR.  DSR cultivation is currently based on two herbicides, Pendimethalin (applied within 72 hours of sowing) and Bispyribac-sodium (after 18-20 days). As Singh pointed out, These are costlier than Imazethapyr (Rs 1,500 versus Rs 300/acre). Imazethapyr, moreover, has a wider weed-control range and is safer, as the ALS gene isnt present in humans and mammals. Even in the herbicide-tolerant rice, the chemical will target only the weeds.  Transplantation in paddy typically requires about 30 irrigations, each consuming some 5 hectare-cm of water (one hectare-cm equals 100,000 litres). Puddling alone takes up about 15 hectare-cm. In all, DSR is estimated to need 30 per cent less water, save Rs 3,000 per acre in transplantation labour charges, and also 10-15 days time due to no nursery preparation.  But DSRs success hinges on an effective herbicide solution  like breeding Imazethapyr-tolerant varieties.",India gets first herbicide-tolerant & non-GM rice varieties; launch today,RICE
2021-10-02,https://indianexpress.com/article/india/after-protests-in-haryana-and-punjab-centre-relents-paddy-procurement-to-begin-today-7548623/,"Two days after the Centre said it would put off paddy procurement in Punjab and Haryana to October 11, the government has decided to commence procurement for the kharif marketing season (KMS) 2021-22 from Sunday.  The Centres move comes amid the ongoing farmer agitation and fresh protests in both the states over the decision to delay procurement. It also comes a day after Punjab Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi met Prime Minister Narendra Modi and sought early procurement of paddy in the state.  Speaking to The Indian Express, Union Food Secretary Sudhanshu Pandey said, Paddy procurement will begin as per FAQ (Fair average quality) norms in mandis across Haryana and Punjab from tomorrow. The procurement will pick up in areas where farmers have harvested early maturing varieties of paddy and where the impact of rainfall is minimal. It will gradually pick up in other areas.  On Sunday, Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar, Deputy CM Dushyant Chautala and state Agriculture Minister J P Dalal met Minister of State for Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution Ashwani Choubey in New Delhi.  After the meeting, Choubey said, Haryanas chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar and a delegation of ministers came and met me. They said their preparations for paddys procurement were already in place and thus, we decided that the procurement shall begin from tomorrow so that farmers do not face any inconvenience.  On Thursday, the Union Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution had cited heavy rainfall to postpone paddy procurement in Punjab and Haryana to October 11.  The procurement and milling period for the kharif marketing season for Punjab was to begin from October 1, 2021, and for Haryana, from September 25, 2021.  In a statement issued on Thursday, the Ministry had said, It has been reported that due to recent heavy downpour in the States of Punjab &Haryana, the maturity of paddy has been delayed. Keeping in view the interest of farmers and to avoid any inconvenience to them, the Department of Food and Public Distribution under Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution has decided that the procurement of Paddy under MSP would commence from 11th October 2021 in states of Punjab & Haryana, the Food Ministry said in a statement.  The announcement led to farmers protesting in both the states.  In Haryana on Saturday, several protesters were detained and police resorted to lathi charge near Chandimandir toll plaza on Panchkula-Kalka-Shimla national highway as farmers in tractors tried to break through police barricades.  Farmers also hoisted the Kisan-ekta flag at the Karnal residence of Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar and camped outside the residence of Haryana Home Minister Anil Vij in Ambala.  In Punjab, hundreds of farmers laid siege to offices of Deputy Commissioners (DCs) across the state, and the residences of several legislators of the ruling party. In Jalandhar, they gheraoed the residence of newly appointed Punjab Cabinet Minister Pargat Singh.  Later, when the decision to begin procurement from Sunday was announced, Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM) leaders said farmers had succeeded in getting the Centre to listen to them.  Reacting to the Centres move to begin procurement on Sunday, the Office of Chief Minister of Punjab tweeted, On Chief Minister @CharanjitChannis request, Centre allows Punjab to start paddy procurement from October 3. Chief Minister thanks Prime Minister @NarendraModi for his personal indulgence to resolve this issue expeditiously.  After the meeting with the minister, Khattar said, Throughout the day, they [farmers] held protests at several places across Haryana. We are also concerned that the procurement of paddy should begin at the earliest. Thus, I, deputy CM Dushyant Chautala, agriculture minister JP Dalal, and various other MLAs had come to Delhi to meet Union Ministers. Now, since a decision has been made that the procurement shall begin from tomorrow [October 3], I hope they will withdraw their agitation.  Punjab and Haryana are crucial states for paddy procurement. Last kharif marketing season, 135.89 lakh metric tonnes (LMT) of rice  or 202 LMT paddy were procured from Punjab, while the figure stood at 37.89 LMT or 56 LMT paddy for Haryana.

The worsening humanitarian situation could turn into a crisis and it is coinciding with a global creeping apathy about the plight of North Koreas people, said Tomas Ojea Quintana, U.N. special rapporteur on human rights in the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea.  [oovvuu-embed id=0837deff-9153-4a08-b429-1e993065ee73]  Sanctions imposed by the UN Security Council should be reviewed and eased when necessary to both facilitate humanitarian and lifesaving assistance and to enable the promotion of the right to an adequate standard of living of ordinary citizens, he said in a final report to the U.N.

REUTERS/Kim Hong-Ji/File Photo  Leader Kim Jong Un in June said the food situation was tense because of natural disasters last year and acknowledged that citizens had faced sacrifices during the pandemic. In April, North Korean officials called a U.N. report on child malnutrition a sheer lie.  North Korea has not reported any COVID-19 cases and has imposed strict anti-virus measures, including border closures and domestic travel curbs.  But many North Koreans relying on commercial activities along the border with China have lost their incomes, and that has been compounded by the impact of sanctions, Ojea Quintana said.  Peoples access to food is a serious concern and the most vulnerable children and elderly are at risk of starvation, he said, adding that North Koreans should not have to choose between the fear of hunger and the fear of COVID-19.  Essential medicines and medical supplies are in short supply and prices have increased several fold as they stopped coming in from China, and humanitarian organisations have been unable to bring in medicines and other supplies.  Most diplomats and aid workers have left North Korea amid strict travel restrictions and a shortage of essential goods and health facilities, Ojea Quintana said.  Progress in vaccination, women and childrens health and water and sanitation was eroding, he said.  The current worsening humanitarian situation could turn into a crisis and must be averted, he said.  CREEPING APATHY  He also voiced concern that growing challenges to obtaining information were leading to a creeping apathy in global attention to the worsening human rights situation there.  Ojea Quintana called for easing military tension on the divided peninsula and urged the United States and South Korea to send clear signals to revive diplomacy aimed at securing the Norths denuclearisation.  In recent weeks, North Korea carried out a series of weapons tests including ballistic missiles and a cruise missile with potential nuclear capabilities.  Ojea Quintana welcomed a pledge by U.S. President Joe Biden and South Korean President Moon Jae-in last May to work to improve North Koreas rights situation.  In any possible upcoming peace negotiations, the Republic of Korea and the United States of America should secure commitments with measurable benchmarks  to a meaningful process of engagement on human rights, he said.  North Koreans are still detained in political prison camps, along with their families, while some have been released from labour training centres due to the unavailability of food and work, he said.

Theres just the lingering pain of loss, simmering anger  and, for Sanaki Punem, her nine-year-old grandson Mahesh.  At Edesmetta, nestled in forested hillocks on the border of Dantewada and Bijapur and still only accessible on foot, Punem never lets Mahesh out of sight. Even when the 59-year-old sits down under a neem tree near her hut to speak to The Indian Express, her eyes constantly follow him. I am scared to let him go too far, he is all I have, she said.  Punems son and Maheshs father, Sonu Punem, was among the eight branded as Maoists and gunned down in Edesmetta by security personnel on the night of May 16-17, 2013. Last month, a judicial probe report submitted to the Chhattisgarh government confirmed what the residents of this village had been saying all along: the encounter was a mistake and none of those killed were Maoists.  Now the government has to make amends. Those responsible should be punished, Punem said.  Its a refrain that echoes across Edesmetta. Residents say this was once a sprawling village that retreated into the forests after Salwa Judum, the vigilante force raised by the then government, marked its presence for the first time.  They burnt our houses, fields, even our shrines. So, we had to move towards the jungles. We saw real violence between 2007 and 2010. We had been living in relative peace till 2013, Mangu Karam, a small-time paddy farmer like most of the residents, said.  With the nearest motorable road 15 km away in Gangaloor, the judicial report has given strength to the demand for compensation of at least Rs 1 crore to the families of those killed in the encounter  and better living conditions.  To reach the nearest school in Gangaloor, children have to cross two hills and four streams. Sometimes, the security forces stop them, Punem said.  This village is spread over more than 8 km in six paras (localities), and we have seven hand pumps in all, out of which four have stopped working for more than a year. Many of us drink water from the nullahs (streams). We have informed officials and panchayat representatives in Burji (the gram panchayat base) but no one has come to even see what the problem is, Sannu Karam, another resident, said.  Residents say most of the 60 families in the village have ration cards, but getting basic necessities from the shop in Gangaloor is another challenge. We have to trek back with the rice and other items, making multiple trips over days. Some of us have relatives in the Gangaloor area who keep our ration in their houses for us to pick up later, Karam said.  But all is not lost for Edesmetta.  Described by officials as a hotspot for malaria, the village is currently witnessing the construction of its first government institution  a health sub-centre.  Work started on the building in May, and the base has been laid. The doctors who visit us say that by next year, the hospital will be ready. Currently, for everything from a fever to snakebite, we have to take the patients to Gangaloor across the hills, Babloo Karam, a resident, said. No Covid case has been reported so far.  According to District Collector Rajendra Kumar Katara, the biggest challenge in providing government infrastructure in far-flung villages like Edesmetta is the security threat of Maoists.  Our ground teams face tremendous challenges, threats and arbitrary stoppage of work whenever they try to visit these villages. There is also a lot of fear among the teams that have to carry out work in these regions. Unless the security forces reach and establish safe passage, our teams cant freely go out, he said.  However, a lot of work is under process, and the development of infrastructure in these regions is a priority, Katara said.  But in Edesmetta, the distrust runs deep. Here, the residents dont want security forces to be deployed, even for development work. In February 2020, they say, six women of the village were beaten up. Silca Tati and Sunita Karam say they were among them.  All we did was ask why they were chasing our husbands from their fields, and they turned on us, Tati said. If the security forces can come, why cant anganwadi workers, health workers and other government staff? They are building the hospital, no one has stopped the work so far, Karam said.  Back under the neem tree, Sanaki Punems worries are all about Mahesh.  Sonu was my youngest child, born after two daughters. My husband died within a year of Sonus death. He couldnt bear the pain of losing our son. In 2015, Sonus wife married another man and left the village leaving Mahesh with me, she said. My grandson has never been to school.","Chhattisgarh: Fake encounter report brings little relief; village wants school, ration shop — and a better life",RICE

Back then, the fact that a staple had been priced out of the reach of the masses led to the French Revolution and the dramatic, bloody collapse of the ancien rgime. The situation isnt quite so dire right now  the president of the French Confederation of Bakeries and Pastry Shops has said that unlike then, bread is still available, even if its more expensive.  Around the world, the unaffordability or non-availability of food has, from time to time, led to mass unrest, and even the collapse of governments. Bread riots had preceded the fall of the Bastille in 1789, which was stormed in part because the starving sans culottes were looking for grain. Similarly, in 1918 a precipitous rise in the price of rice caused riots in Japan, which led to the resignation of Prime Minister Terauchi Masatake and his cabinet. And consider how frequently that Indian pantry staple  the onion  has caused electoral convulsions: From fuelling public anger against Indira Gandhis government in the pre-Emergency months to powering her resurgence in the 1980 general elections. Onion price rise was also one of the factors in the ousting of the BJP in the 1998 Delhi Assembly elections.  Frances current surge in the price of the baguette is due to bad harvests in Russia, which have led to a global rise in the price of wheat. Greater energy prices have also made ovens more expensive to operate and the heat is being felt by the nations famous boulangeries, as well as the average consumer of the long, baton-shaped bread which is seen as an icon of French culinary heritage.

Our special items in sweets are orange rasgulla, jackfruit Mysorepak, guava Mysorepak, sevvazhai (red banana) Mysorepak, naatu sakkarai (country sugar) ragi badam ladoo, naatu sakkarai kambu (pearl millet) badam ladoo, and a halwa made with karupatti (palm jaggery) and coconut milk.

2021-10-29,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/how-a-packet-of-rock-sugar-in-my-kitchen-brought-back-memories-of-childhood-temple-visits/article37226466.ece,"Kalkandu is apparently a favourite of the gods too  Organising my kitchen cupboards is a mundane task, but sometimes it is surprisingly rewarding. Ingredients that I never find when I need them materialise like Banquos ghost in Macbeth, but with happier consequences. On one recent cleaning effort I chanced upon a packet of kalkandu or mishri, rock sugar. It transported me back to childhood when temple visits were often rewarded with crinkly yellow-cellophane wrapped treasures of khajoor (dry dates), mishri, raisins and cashew. They stayed fresh for a long time, though I did not usually put them to the test. The thought of rolling around an oversized chunk of rock sugar in my mouth till it dissolved brought so much joy.  Kalkandu is apparently a favourite of the gods too. In my 2019 travels across India exploring sacred food offerings, I learnt of a delicious sounding naivedyam using kalkandu in several ancient temples in Tamil Nadu. I particularly remember an early morning visit to Thillai Kali Amman Kovil, a Shakti Peetham located a short distance from the famous Chidambaram Nataraja temple. Legend speaks of the celestial dance competition between Shiva and Kali, where the goddess is defeated and banished from Thillai to where the Kali Amman temple is now located.  After my darshan of the goddess, the gurukkal (priest) gave me a donnai or leaf bowl filled with steaming hot kalkandu sakkarai pongal. This is a concoction of rice, passi paruppu (moong dal), rock sugar and ghee, garnished with plump fried raisins and fragrant with saffron, cardamom and pachchai karpooram (edible camphor). Kalkandu sakkarai pongal is better known as a signature item in the naivedyam of the Chidambaram temple.  Kongu cuisine  I first tasted this flavourful sweet while staying with my friend, Mangalam, during the Pongal/ Sankranti festival. Her home town, like mine, is Coimbatore, once part of the ancient Kongu Nadu region. Kalkandu pongal is a popular item in this regions cuisine. Mangalams mother prepared a different pongal for each day of the festival: the usual jaggery-based sakkarai pongal with rice and lentils, millet pongal with karuppatti (palm jaggery), savoury ven pongal, and my favourite, kalkandu sakkarai pongal, with brown rock sugar. I was happy that she did not add edible camphor: though reminiscent of temple prasadam, camphor, if not used judiciously, can overwhelm all other flavours and ruin the dish.  Several variations are possible in the preparation of kalkandu pongal. Kalkandu sadam, for instance, has rice (no lentils) cooked in milk. Powdered rock sugar is added, followed by saffron, cardamom and a garnish of ghee-fried raisins and cashew. Alternatively, rice may be cooked in water and milk added (or not) later. Kalkandu may be powdered, melted into a thin syrup, or used as is. While saffron and cardamom are standard ingredients, nutmeg may or may not be included.  Unique flavours  In the southern States, sakkarai pongal, with rice, moong dal, milk and jaggery, is a popular preparation for bhog/ naivedya in homes and temples. Rich with ghee and studded with fried cashew and raisins, it is an all-time favourite, and kalkandu sakkarai pongal is an interesting alternative, with rock sugar, saffron, cardamom and nutmeg each contributing their unique flavour.  The packet of rock sugar in my kitchen brought instant memories of this delectable dish and I put it to good use in a recipe broadly similar to the one used in the Chidambaram temple.  I use my grandmothers vengala paanai or bronze pot to make the pongal. It is heavy-bottomed and allows the dish to slow-cook on low heat. Alternatively, rice and dal may be pressure-cooked and other ingredients added (as in the recipe below). In this recipe, kalkandu may be powdered. However, when the crystal chunks are allowed to dissolve gradually in cooked rice it brings a special flavour. Stirring the saffron gently into the pongal helps it infuse the rice with its aroma and colour, giving the sakkarai pongal its classic pale yellow hue.  Chidambaram temple Kalkandu Sakkarai Pongal  Ingredients  Rice  cup  Passi paruppu/ split moong - 2 tablespoons  Kalkandu/mishri - 3/4 cup  Salt - 1 pinch  Saffron - 4-5 strands  Ghee - 1 teaspoon + 2 tablespoons  Cardamom - powdered 1 pinch  Nutmeg - powdered 1 pinch  Cashew, raisins - a few  Method  1. Soak rice and dal separately for 20 minutes. Drain.  2. Roast dal in 1 teaspoon of ghee. Add rice, roast for 2 minutes.  3. Cook rice and dal till soft. Mash well while hot.  4. Add kalkandu. Let it dissolve (about 10 minutes on low heat). Stir frequently.  5. Add salt, stir.  6. Add saffron, stir for 2 minutes.  7. Add cardamom, nutmeg. Stir.  8. Fry cashew and raisins in ghee. Add them (with ghee) to pongal.

2021-10-29,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/the-lesser-known-sourashtrian-food/article37225514.ece,"The small Sourashtrian community in Madurai has used the quiet of lockdown to revive heirloom recipes, many of which lay the foundations for Tamil Nadus most popular dishes  Streets and markets in the temple town of Madurai come alive in the evenings with pushcart vendors selling crisp vadais made with deep fried spinach or powdered mulmurungai leaves pounded with cumin. Also, there are sojji appams, sweet little maida pooris stuffed with rava kesari, and nutrient-rich paruthipaal made from extracted cotton seed milk blended with rice flour, cardamom, dry ginger and palm sugar. These dishes that are an integral part of the citys street food culture are staples in Sourashtrian households in South India. Yet there is much more to be discovered especially during the festival seasons and special ceremonies, when Sourashtrian families get together to prepare and share traditional recipes handed down generations.  Sensing an opportunity to revive heirloom recipes during the pandemic, members of the Sourashtra community planned food festivals to remind members about what defines their food, while simultaneously showcasing their food culture to the rest of the city. The first, a three-day food festival held recently in temple town Madurai revived some time-honoured recipes.  Sourashtrian delicacy Polte Chaino now commonly known as mutton kootu | Photo Credit: Special Arrangement  According to chef Aravinth G N, who curated the food festival, it is believed that the Sourashtrians brought the idli to South India. A blend of rice and urad dal, ground together and steamed to form cakes called iddada can be traced to Gujarat in the 10th to 12th Century. Rasam is also said to have originated in 16th Century Madurai, made by the Sourashtrians who called it pulichaar.  There are select dishes in traditional Sourashtrian menus for weddings and important ceremonies; we follow the ingredients and preparation style as taught by our ancestors, says Aravinth, whose family is known for its expertise in Sourashtrian cuisine and has been in private catering for the last six decades.  The taste, texture and ingredients of our cuisine has transformed under the influence of Tamil culture; even the names changed, says C R Venkatesh, president of Sourashtra Small Business Association. For instance tamarind rice, popular as puliodharai now, was called ambad bhaat; saman ambadi is kudal kuzambu, limbu pongal is commonly known aslemon rice, while the spicy alagar koil dosa evolved from halke dhowra thida. The original Sourashtrian tomato rice has a strong cinnamon flavour while their sakkarai pongal is prepared in paruthipaal (cotton seeds milk).  Sourashtrian delicacy The original Ambad Bhaath is what we now know as tamarind rice or puliyodharai | Photo Credit: Special Arrangement  Our ingredients and food are unique in taste, yet nowhere in the world there is a decent restaurant offering authentic Sourashtrian cuisine, rues Yogesh Thirukonda, who conceived the revival initiative.  It is estimated that there are around 6,00,000 Sourashtrians across Tamil Nadu, and Madurai is a major hub with 1,80,000 settled there. History records that the silk thread merchants from Gujarat were brought as royal weavers by the Nayak kings of the South in mid-17th Century.  Three major waves of migration happened, to Madurai, Thanjavur and Salem. When people move, they not only bring their food with them but the memories of home, says Venkatesh adding that heritage recipes and food available in the new place of work and living often amalgamate to shape the immigrant experience, while influencing their new home.  The community is now keen on compiling the traditional recipes to bring out a book on Sourashtrian cuisine because food is as much about memories as it is about festivity, culture, spices and names that ought to be documented, says Thirukonda.

The name is derived from the Tamil words kattu (kaddu meaning forest) and yanai (elephant). A resilient paddy grown in the delta of the Cauvery basin in Tamil Nadu, it is flood- and drought-resistant. Growing up to a height of seven feet, the sturdy paddy, a red rice, is mentioned in Tamil literature that is around 2,400 years old, making it one of the ancient rice varieties that is still cultivated and consumed in India. In the context of climate change, the cultivation of this stress-tolerant rice is of great help to farmers, since the straw can also be sold.  Kattuyanam will be displayed as part of an exhibition of paddy seeds and grains, including sale of select varieties, which is on till November 1 at the Thanal sales outlet in Jawahar Nagar, Thiruvananthapuram. It is organised by the NGO Thanal, which has been spearheading Save the Rice Campaign, in association with Organic Bazaar.  The exhibition showcases 120 kinds of seeds and 90 kinds of grains. Fifty kinds of grain will be for sale, says Manju, CEO-designate, Thanal.  Celebrating the rice diversity of India with paddy from rice cultivating states like Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Chhatisgarh, Jharkhand, West Bengal, Odisha and Madhya Pradesh featuring in the exhibition, the mela also highlights the nutrition benefits of native rice. A majority of the rice varieties is from Kerala, such as rakthashali, navara, valiya chennellu, mullankazhama, kuruva and thekkan chitteni.  Mullankayama, gandhakasala, jeerakasala, gobindobhog, basmati brown and basmati white are some of the aromatic grains that will be for sale.  Usha Shoolapani, director of Agroecology and Food Security at Thanal, says: Indigenous seeds have an innate strength to cope with our climate and geographic conditions. Many of these are still cultivated by small farmers in Wayanad. The effort is to revive these seeds and make the rice available for customers.  Since rice has been a staple for centuries in many regions in India, even the names of the paddy species have roots in the culture and beliefs of the people cultivating it. For instance, Laxmi bhog, Vishnu bhog and gobindobhog are aromatic, small white grains usually used for making food (bhog) for the gods Vishnu and Lakshmi.  Mappillai samba, cultivated in Tamil Nadu, is usually served to newly married bridegrooms. It has a low glycemic index and has been found to be rich in several essential nutrients, explains Jayakumar, executive director of Thanal.  Seeds of Bahurupi, which changes colour three times before it ripens | Photo Credit: Special arrangement  Bahurupi, an aromatic rice from West Bengal, changes colour three to four times till it ripens. When it sprouts it looks black. The exhibition invites viewers to get a feel of the paddy, its aroma and colour.  Indias rice diversity is amazing. Dr Debal Deb, a scientist in Odisha, has been growing 1,400 kinds of rice for the last 20 years and also researching on the nutrients in those species.

Merriam-Webster has added 455 new words to its venerable dictionary, including a number of abbreviations and slang terms that have become ubiquitous on social media.  Just as the language never stops evolving, the dictionary never stops expanding, the nearly 200-year-old Springfield, Massachusetts-based company said on its website. New terms and new uses for existing terms are the constant in a living language.  The dictionary company said the quick and informal nature of messaging, texting, and tweeting, which has only increased during the pandemic, has contributed to a vocabulary newly rich in efficient and abbreviated expression.  Among them: TBH, an abbreviation for to be honest and FTW, an abbreviation for for the win.  Merriam-Webster explains that FTW is used especially to express approval or support. In social media, FTW is often used to acknowledge a clever or funny response to a question or meme.  And it says amirite is a quick way to write am I right, as in, English spelling is consistently inconsistent, amirite?  The coronavirus pandemic also looms large in the collection of new entrants as super-spreader, long COVID and vaccine passport made the list.  Partisan politics contributed more slang to the lexicon, such as whataboutism, which Merriam-Webster defines as the act or practice of responding to an accusation of wrongdoing by claiming that an offense committed by another is similar or worse. For Britons, the dictionary notes that whataboutery is more commonly used.  The dreaded vote-a-ramas that have become a fixture in the U.S. Congress is explained this way: an unusually large number of debates and votes that happen in one day on a single piece of legislation to which an unlimited number of amendments can be introduced, debated, and voted on.

2021-10-31,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/the-need-to-move-away-from-clientelism/article37200567.ece,"Welfare initiatives embody civil rights, whereas freebies cultivate a patron-client syndrome  A neoliberal economy encourages private capital and the market, while forcing the state to withdraw from welfare. The state is limited in taking concrete and constructive efforts to fulfil the aspirations of the people. Even as the poor perceive the state as an arbitrator of their well-being and a facilitator for their mobility in all spheres of life, todays political parties resort to unsolicited freebies to attract them. The line between welfarism and populism has blurred.  Welfare initiatives include a targeted Public Distribution System, providing social security for labourers, quality education, fair employment, affordable healthcare, decent housing, and protection from exploitation and violence. Freebies, on the other hand, are provided to attract voters to cast their vote in a particular election. They create limited private benefit for the receiver and do not contribute towards strengthening public goods/facilities.  Also Read Freebie culture makes people of Tamil Nadu lazy, laments HC  A freebie culture  The culture of freebies in Tamil Nadu was started during the 1967 Assembly elections. The then Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) chief C.N. Annadurai offered three measures of rice for 1. The practice of providing freebies was followed by subsequent Chief Ministers of both the DMK and the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK), who promised free TV sets, free laptops to students, free rides for women in buses, free gas cylinders and stoves, a goat and a cow for poor farmers, and so on.  Initially, the government attempted to strengthen the redistribution of resources for all. After the 1990s, Dravidian parties moved towards clientelism, narrowly focussing on electoral gains. A study by Shroff, Kumar and Reich (2015) on the DMKs health insurance scheme demonstrated that the main beneficiaries were the partys core supporters and swing voters who could be influenced easily. Worse, after 2009, fewer people accessed public health care centres.  In 2021, however, there was a qualitative difference in the manifesto of the DMK, which avoided most of the freebies except tablet devices to students studying in higher secondary schools and colleges. The manifesto reflected more of a programmatic policy intervention towards better public services than narrow private benefits in the form of freebies. But both the DMK and the AIADMK were silent on land distribution and enhancing budgetary allocation for maintenance of public infrastructure like schools, colleges, hostels and hospitals. The GSDP share for health was better under AIADMK rule compared to DMK rule, but both were below 1.5%. Tamil Nadus 2021-22 Budget shows that it has allocated around 13.3% of its total expenditure for education, which is lower than average allocation for education by all States, which is 15.8%.  Depoliticising the poor  When Senior Counsel Arvind P. Datar submitted his arguments in S. Subramaniam Balaji v. Govt. of Tamil Nadu (2013), which challenged the freebies of both the DMK government in 2006 and AIADMK government in 2011, he emphasised that freebies violate the constitutional mandate of extending benefits for public purpose and instead create private benefits. He asserted that the literacy rate in Tamil Nadu was around 73% and there were 234 habitations across the State with no school access whatsoever, and distribution of free consumer goods to the people having ration cards cannot be justified as public purpose. Further, distributing laptops does not serve the purpose of increasing the quality of education. According to a report by Anaivarukkum Kalvi Iyakkam (Sarva Siksha Abhiyan) in 2019, there were 3,003 government schools attended by less than 15 students. Due to lack of proper infrastructure facilities and specialised teachers, parents prefer to move their students to private schools. According to a report in this newspaper in 2019, more than 1,500 hostels for Scheduled Castes (SCs) and Scheduled Tribes (STs) were in a dilapidated condition. Hence, freebies will not only depoliticise the poor and marginalised communities but also indirectly deny them their due share of state resources. Freebies drastically widen the gap between the rich and the poor. Populism encourages mediocre political critics and erases critical and rational thinking, which are important to raise pertinent questions to people in power.  Also Read What distinguishes welfare measures from freebies?  Compared to other States, Tamil Nadu has made impressive strides in many development indicators such as education, healthcare (mortality rate and life expectancy) and infrastructure facilities. However, it lags behind in other aspects. According to the Tamil Nadu State Agricultural Departments publication, Salient Statistics on Agriculture, 2019, SCs, who constitute nearly 20% of Tamil Nadus population, accounted for 10% of agricultural landowners and possessed 7.8% of the farmland in the State. Even though the literacy rate is high in Tamil Nadu, according to the National Family Health Survey (NFHS)-4 (2015-16), only 32% of women aged 15-49 had completed 12 or more years of schooling, compared with 38% of men. The NFHS-4 showed sharp differences between SCs and Other Backward Classes in Tamil Nadu. The neonatal mortality was 12.3 for OBCs, but 17.4 for SCs. Infant mortality was 18.4 for OBCs but 23.6 for SCs. And under-five mortality was 24.8 for OBCs and 31 for SCs. The data reflect inequal access to public health infrastructure.  According to a paper by the Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations, Explaining the contractualisation of Indias workforce (2019), the share of contract workers in Tamil Nadu increased sharply from 8.3% in 2000-01 to 20.17% in 2013-14, which shows the withdrawal of the state in providing social security, and leaving the workforce at the mercy of neoliberal market forces.  A dichotomy  Theoretically, there is a qualitative distinction between being subjects in an authoritarian regime and being citizens in a democratic polity. Unsolicited freebies cultivate a patron-client syndrome and encourage personality cults in a democratic polity. Besides, they affect the critical faculties of citizens, particularly the poor and the marginalised. Providing freebies is to treat people like subjects, whereas citizens are entitled to constitutional guarantees. Welfare initiatives are an embodiment of civil rights, whereas unsolicited freebies show benevolence at best and apathy at worst towards the poor by the ruling parties.  Also read | Have freebies and bribes depoliticised voters?  There was a positive indication that the DMK is reconsidering unsolicited freebies/populism when it tabled a White Paper on the States Finances in the Assembly recently. Thereafter, there has been a lot of public discussion on this issue, which may lead to a reorientation of public policy in a healthy direction. Political parties and civil society should consider quality aspects in education, healthcare and employment and ensure fair distribution and redistribution of resources for the marginalised communities. We draw the publics attention and debate to the dichotomy between welfare and unsolicited freebies or populism, so that the constitutional ideal of a secular, egalitarian and democratic India can be realised.

Ben Johnson scored early for the visitors only to see Ollie Watkins equalise but the Hammers reclaimed the lead before half-time through Declan Rice.  Villa's task was made all the harder early in the second half when defender Ezri Konsa was dismissed for denying a goalscoring opportunity.  Late goals from Pablo Fornals and Jarrod Bowen sealed the three points for David Moyes' side and condemned Villa to a fourth straight Premier League defeat.  The victory lifts David Moyes' Hammers to 20 points after 10 games -- level on points with third-placed Manchester City.  West Ham drew first blood in the seventh minute when Rice sprayed a pass out to the right flank for Johnson, who cut inside onto his left foot and curled a low shot into the far corner of the net.  Watkins levelled things up in the 34th minute, steering home Emiliano Buendia's low cross from close range.  But Villa's delight was shortlived as Rice restored the visitors' lead with a long-range shot that bobbled its way into the back of the net via a touch off the post just four minutes later.  Villa were reduced to 10 men in the 50th minute when a VAR review ruled that Konsa had denied Bowen a clear goalscoring opportunity by tripping him on the edge of the penalty area. The Villa defender initially only received a yellow card for the foul.  Despite being a man down, the home side came agonisingly close to an equaliser when Lukasz Fabianski got his fingertips to a thumping Watkins header to push it against the bar.

The department suspects that paddy might have been imported from other states and sold in these markets.  Deputy commissioner (DC) Kapurthala, Deepti Uppal, has formed 10 teams to verify the arrival of paddy in these 10 mandis  Khalu, Baler Khanpur, Bharolanga, Kamalpur, Bharoana, Paramjit Pur, Marripur, Dhaliwal Bate, Bhandal Bate, and Ramidi. The estimate of paddy arrival in any mandi is calculated as per the area under paddy crop around the mandi and its potential arrival.  Teams comprising the officials from the agriculture department, revenue department, and Punjab Mandi Board will verify the arrival, read the letter issued by the deputy commissioner.  The sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) Kapurthala and Sultanpur Lodhi are also asked to include Guardians of Governance (GoGs) to check these mandis and if required, they can also form more checking teams at their level.  Agriculture officials said that the entire paddy harvested cannot be sold by farmers in the mandis as they have to keep some amount for self-consumption as well as seed purposes.  Illegal paddy transporting from other states has been going on despite the food departments effort to stop it.  A rice sheller owner said, several rice shellers are involved in bringing paddy from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar at a cheap rate like Rs 1,200-1,300 per quintal to sell the same here at Punjab mandis at the rate of MSP which is Rs 1,960 per quintal.  This time the central government has already told the state that it will procure only 170 lakh tonnes of paddy from Punjab. If the states quota set by the Centre is completed before harvesting is completed in the state, the farmers may lose out. The state government has, however, asked the centre that it may receive 190 lakh tonnes of paddy in its mandis. Last year, 203 lakh tonnes of paddy was procured from Punjab but this year with more than one lakh hectare area less under paddy crop, the procurement will also be less.  Recently, more than 5,000 quintals of rice worth over Rs 1 crore has been recovered after a two-day raid at the premises of a Kapurthala-based Gopal Rice Mill.

The android of Star Trek was self-aware, sapient, sentient, and had striven for his own humanity. Today, Data is already Big and ever-expanding and has the potential to influence every bit of human lifestyle. However, There is terror in numbers, as Darrell Huff wrote in How to Lie with Statistics. The task of statisticians is to churn the data and obtain summary measures, diagrams and figures, rankings and indices, and make conclusions. Is this the much-desired human chip to make Data human?  Proper understanding of statistics  In reality, statisticians are often like the blind men of the parable, standing in front of an elephant. And inadequate or partial analysis of data may lead to an incorrect portrayal of the elephant. As H.G. Wells is known to have said: Statistical thinking will one day be as necessary for efficient citizenship as the ability to read and write. Yes, understanding the meaning of statistical and probabilistic conclusions is very important. This was exemplified by the case of Stephen Jay Gould who explained how the statistic that peritoneal mesothelioma, the form of cancer with which he was diagnosed, has a median survival time of eight months is misleading given the distribution of that data, and relevant data regarding his individual prognosis. Gould showed a positive outlook to beat the odds. Some of the fighting spirit, he proposed, was the result of his proper understanding of statistics. For once, he argued, statistics manifested itself as a source of optimism, rather than the sterile methodology that most people associate with the term.  Misleading statistics maybe produced due to limitations of the concerned statisticians, or it may even be deliberate, or both. Misinforming people by the use of statistical material might be called statistical manipulation, Huff wrote. Huff pointed out seven common tactics to knead statistical data into dough, which include polling a non-representative group, small sample sizes, and averaging values across non-uniform populations. Huff illustrated how statistical graphs could be used to distort reality. If the bottom of a line or bar chart is truncated, differences look larger than they are. Also, the proportion between the ordinate and the abscissa is sometimes changed for this purpose. With the help of several real examples, Huff also discussed the post-hoc fallacy, which incorrectly asserts a direct correlation between two findings. In his 2001 book, Damned Lies & Statistics, Joel Best also used fascinating examples from leading newspapers and television programmes to unravel the use, misuse, and abuse of statistical information.  The goal of statistics is to search for truth amid the randomness of nature. Uncertain knowledge + Knowledge of the amount of uncertainty in it = Usable knowledge, wrote C.R. Rao in his book Statistics and Truth: Putting Chance to Work. Prof. Rao discussed how statistics can be used to judge whether a newly discovered poem is composed by Shakespeare or to mix blood samples from different persons together to test for certain rare diseases to reduce the number of tests.  Need for innovation  Churning for truth from the ocean of data sometimes demands finer statistical expertise. It also needs innovation. During the communal riots in Delhi after Independence, many people from a minority community took refuge in Red Fort, and some in Humanyun Tomb. The government had no exact count of the refugees, and contractors responsible to feed them charged high amounts. A team from the Indian Statistical Institute was asked to estimate the number. They estimated the number of persons inside a given area without having an opportunity to look at the concentrations of persons inside the area and without using any known sampling techniques for estimation or census methods. In fact, based on an idea suggested by J.M. Sengupta, they divided the quantities of rice, pulses, and salt used per day to feed all the refugees, as quoted by the contractors, by the respective per capita requirements of rice, pulses, and salt known from consumption surveys, and got three widely different estimates of the number of refugees. The estimate obtained by salt was the smallest and the estimate from the rice was the largest. As rice was the most expensive, its quantity was probably exaggerated. They proposed the quantity obtained from salt as an estimate of the number of refugees. The method was verified to provide a good approximation in the Humayun tomb.  The lesson is clear. In order to extract truths by using statistics, one needs expertise and innovation from the concerned statisticians. Ideal statistical thinking and proper understanding of statistics of the common people, of course, is no less important. A pinch of salt is needed, indeed.

And of course, years of her parents gardening experience. This knowledge came in handy when her own garden  consisting of two pots  took root over a decade later. Over the years, the two pots have expanded to an elaborate terrace vegetation system with okra, chillies, tomatoes, pomegranates, drumsticks, radishes and more; thanks to her homemade fertilisers, pesticides and bio enzymes, several of which she shares in her new book A Beginners Guide to Home Gardening: The Natural Way.  The book, modelled after a cookbook, shares recipes  using mostly kitchen waste (illustrated by Anchal Sandeep Bansal)  that empower you to manage your plants with self-sufficiency. The book contains a little bit of everything. How to make your own fertilisers, pesticides and also how to use the ones that are purchased off the shelf. Its for beginners or those who are already into gardening. I wanted people to have one place to go for all the recipes and since they are used to reading recipe books. I wanted to give them an easy format like that, says Anju.  Era of experimentation  From fish amino punch and coconut buttermilk colada to blooms booster and turmeric blast, the names of the recipes inspire the same gluttony a cookbook does (till you read the purpose). Unfortunately, these are not magical concoctions but plant solutions well-known to organic gardeners that she has learned from her parents and the Internet. So, what is the novelty of this book amid the information overload of the World Wide Web?  Not everything on the Internet is perfect. One has to learn and know which one is the best solution to use. When I came to Chennai, we had no garden and I was clueless about a terrace garden. So, it (my knowledge) has been a step by step experiment process. I would maintain a diary of what worked for me and what didnt. A lot of trial and error has gone into it, she explains, adding that her mother motivated her when she was hesitant to write this book.  Her experience also extends to several gardening events that she has hosted as a member of the Green Goddesses, a platform advocating a self-sustainable and natural lifestyle. Through the events I realised that many people did not know about something as simple as the 3G spray (ginger, garlic, green chillies). When I told them about it and they saw positive results, I thought maybe there is a need for a book that people can resonate with and understand, she narrates. Along with tried and tested universal recipes, the book also offers substitutes for ingredients and other tips for the garden.  Need for natural  Growing up in a gardening household has helped Anju cultivate a special relationship with plants and home cooked meals through the years. When she was not helping her parents with the vegetables, you could have found her at relatives houses helping and advising the gardeners as an 11-12-year-old (an earlier, verbal rendition of the book, perhaps?) at their request. They would also invite people over  and keep them coming  with their delicious homegrown yield. I remember my uncle from Peddar Road would come home every Sunday evening only to have lemon juice made of the lemons grown on the property. I didnt get a chance to graft it so Im still searching for that taste. You know, there is a subtle difference in the taste between the market bought and homemade. My daughter was ill a few years ago and I made her spinach soup from the ones at home. The next day, she wanted it again and this time, I used market spinach and she did not enjoy it as much as the first one. Theres not a huge difference but there is one, she shares.  A green thumb for decades also affects your life, makes you consider a more sustainable lifestyle. For several years now, Anju has practised this, even creating her own products  floor cleaner, addition to deepam oil, utensil cleaners and more  with yield from her garden and its waste. With a bucket for composting and even reusing her rice and dal water for the plants, her recipes all use her kitchen waste. This also helps you reduce waste since it uses the scraps from your kitchen, she says. Its quite assuring to know that the author you might refer to practices what they preach.",Natural recipes for the green-thumbed,RICE

The plant can grow up to seven feet tall, and even an elephant can hide in the crops.  It is rich in antioxidants, controls blood sugar, is good for skin and normalises bowel movement.

Now, there are just four. And Kummari Veedhi, which used to be filled with energy and smell of clay this time of the year is dull as the artisan families opted not to make diyas for this Diwali.No one wants simple diyas anymore. Now, people want intricately designed or colourful diyas, said S Satyavathi (40), a resident of the streeet.  This year, she said, all potters left in the locality have brought diyas of various designs from Rajasthan and painted them. These hand painted diyas are sold at higher prices compared to simple ones, she added.  Rajasthani diyas of different sizes are sold at prices ranging from Rs 70 to Rs 300 per dozen. While some families are selling painted diyas, others are vending them as they were. Another reason for dwindling demand for clay diyas is Chinese rice lights, which are flooded the market.S Srinivas Rao, a potter who has taken up a clerical job to support his family, explained that the price of clay has increased drastically.  A truck load of clay costs as much as Rs 20,000. We put in so much time, effort and money into making traditional diyas, but very few want them. Hence, we have decided not to make them and instead brought north Indian diyas, which are in demand nowadays, he added.  This is the first time that we havent churned out clay diyas for Diwali. The potter wheel has been left untouched by many of us, said Satyavathi. The potter family used to make as many as 10,000 clay diyas for Diwali. Gauri, a potter, explained that last year almost half of the clay diyas were left unsold causing a huge loss to them. We have picked out the good diyas and kept them for sale but not many buyers as usual, Gauri rued.  Many people dont pay much. We sell them at Rs 10-50 depending on the size. And after the usual bargains, were hardly left with any margin, she added. The potters of Kummari Veedhi also receive orders a few weeks prior to Diwali from corporate offices and more. Since the pandemic, the number of orders has considerably decreased. Most of the orders they received also for designer diyas. No one wants these round simple diyas anymore, the potters told.  Additionally, potters of Kummari Veedhi also make flower pots (locally known as Chichubudlu) on getting prior orders. They are priced at Rs 4 each. Buyers fill the shells with chemical mixture and sell them in the market. M Veeraju (65) recalled a time when Kummari Veedhi was bustling with the crowd during Diwali.

2021-11-03,https://indianexpress.com/article/world/explained-chinas-latest-covid-19-outbreak-7605860/,"China has been seeing a spike in Covid-19 cases in multiple provinces, despite implementing strict restrictions on travel within the country. On Wednesday, the countrys National Health Commission reported that 93 locally transmitted Covid-19 cases and 16 new imported cases were found on Tuesday. This marks the highest single-day spike in recent weeks.  Zero Covid  Countries like China, New Zealand, Australia and Singapore had pursued a zero Covid approach since the beginning of the pandemic. Unlike some Western nations, they steadily stuck to closed borders and strict restrictions despite protests, which has led to an extended lockdown-like situation and disruptions to economic and social activity. However, New Zealand, Australia and Singapore have, one by one, swapped that policy to focus on vaccinating the population to reduce the most serious risks and opening up commerce and travel in a phased manner.  Despite the restrictions, local Covid-19 infections have been found in 19 of 31 provinces in China, according to a Bloomberg report. The countrys National Health Commission said that of the 96 new cases that were registered on Tuesday, 35 were reported in the province of Heilongjiang bordering Russia, 14 in Hebei, another 14 in Gansu, nine in Beijing, six in Inner Mongolia, four each in Chongqing and Qinghai, two each in Jiangxi, Yunnan and Ningxia, and one in Sichuan, reported Reuters news agency.  According to the World Health Organisation, 68.97% of Chinas population is fully vaccinated.  Beijings nine new infections is the most number of cases it has registered since early January. The city now has at least 38 active cases officially, which is the highest it has seen since before the outbreak of the highly-infectious delta variant in early January and February.  While the number of cases may seem low overall, they gain significance when seen in the light of the strict locdown and border closing methods China has employed since the beginning of the outbreak in early 2020 as a part of its zero Covid policy.  For instance, a primary school in China held back dozens of kids aged 7 to 12 for hours after a single staff member tested Covid-19 positive, according to a BBC report. The report said that parents were told the students would have to wait in the school overnight until the results of the test were available. At least 35 students were eventually taken away into quarantine, and the school has been temporarily shut.  Stock up order  Chinas Ministry of Commerce, in an order issued on Tuesday, asked citizens to stock up on daily necessities and household emergency supplies for the upcoming winter and spring. The recommended list of household emergency supplies in the country include instant noodles, bottled water, compressed biscuits and luncheon meat.

The notice sparked speculations of a harsher lockdown in the wake of the surge in cases.  The notice sparked panic among citizens, and compressed biscuits and luncheon meat became some of the top most searched items on the internet, said the GT report.  Despite criticism, Chinas infectious disease expert Dr. Zhong Nanshan defended the zero Covid policy, stating that it is preferable to have continuous restrictions in place than to intermittently impose them as is being done in most countries.  Some countries have decided to open up entirely despite still having a few infections, Reuters reported Dr. Zhong as saying. That led to a large number of infections in the past two months and they decided to re-impose restrictions. This flip-flopping approach is actually more costly. The psychological impact on citizens and society is greater, he said.","China sees spike in Covid-19 cases, asks citizens to stock up on daily necessities",RICE
2021-11-03,https://indianexpress.com/article/world/china-makes-it-a-crime-to-mock-heroes-7605479/,"Written by Steven Lee Myers  The young woman in Beijing began her post complaining about mobs gathering online, where recluses vent misogynistic insecurities from the safety of desk chairs. As provocative as it was, it might have passed unnoticed except that she added another beat.  She mocked the toxic masculinity of users imagining themselves as Dong Cunrui, a textbook war hero who, according to Chinese Communist Party lore, died valiantly during the civil war that brought the party to power in 1949.  For that passing reference, the woman, 27 and identified in court only by her last name, Xu, was sentenced last month to seven months in prison.  Her crime: violating a newly amended criminal code that punishes the slander of Chinas martyrs and heroes. Since it went into effect in March, the statute has been enforced with a revolutionary zeal, part of an intensified campaign under Chinas leader, Xi Jinping, to sanctify the Communist Partys version of history  and his vision for the countrys future.  The Cyberspace Administration of China, which polices the countrys internet, has created telephone and online hotlines to encourage citizens to report violations. It has even published a list of 10 rumors that are forbidden to discuss.  Was Mao Zedongs Long March really not so long? Did the Red Army skirt heavy fighting against the Japanese during World War II to save its strength for the civil war against the Nationalist forces of Chiang Kai-shek? Was Maos son, Mao Anying, killed by a U.S. airstrike during the Korean War because he lit a stove to make fried rice?  Chinese President Xi Jinping, center, waves above a large portrait of the late leader Mao Zedong during a ceremony to mark the 100th anniversary of the founding of the ruling Chinese Communist Party at Tiananmen Gate in Beijing July 1, 2021. (AP) Chinese President Xi Jinping, center, waves above a large portrait of the late leader Mao Zedong during a ceremony to mark the 100th anniversary of the founding of the ruling Chinese Communist Party at Tiananmen Gate in Beijing July 1, 2021. (AP)  Asking those very questions risks arrest and, now, prosecution. It is a sign of the establishment of an absolute political totalitarianism, said Wu Qiang, an outspoken political analyst in Beijing.  Chinas Communist Party has long policed dissent, severely restricting public discussion of topics it deems to be politically incorrect, from Tibet to the Tiananmen Square protests. The new law goes further. It has criminalized as slander topics that were once subjects of historical debate and research, including Maos rule itself up to a point. Since March, the law has been used at least 15 times to punish slights to party history.  The campaign reflects an ambition by Xi to solidify a moral foundation for the Communist Partys supremacy, a theme the Chinese leader often evokes in speeches and articles.  The party once could rely on the financial inducements of a booming economy and coercive control of the security state to cement its rule, but now appears to be using political and historical orthodoxy as a foundation, said Adam Ni, a director of the China Policy Center in Australia and editor of China Story.  Chinese President Xi Jinping (AP/File) Chinese President Xi Jinping (AP/File)  There are limits to these tools, he said of the economy and security state. They need the moral  the moral legitimacy to maintain their rule.  A version of the slander law was first adopted in 2018, but an amendment to the countrys criminal code that took effect March 1 allowed prosecutors to seek criminal punishment, including prison sentences of up to three years.  In April, a 19-year-old man in Nanjing was charged for disparaging the victims of the Japanese massacre there in 1937. A 63-year-old man in Beijing was charged for mocking a Navy fighter pilot, Lt. Cmdr. Wang Wei, who crashed in the South China Sea after colliding with a U.S. surveillance aircraft in 2001.  At least three people were detained in May for derisive comments after the death of Yuan Longping, a scientist who developed high-yield hybrid strains of rice.  Last month, authorities arrested a man in Nanchang after he posted an irreverent comment about the legend surrounding the death of Maos son in 1950. That fried rice was the best thing to come out of the whole Korean War, he wrote.  Officials have defended the law as a necessary tool to fight what one director with the Cyberspace Administration of China, Wen Youhua, called historical nihilism, which officials often use to describe deviant views.  These people may be trying to gain clicks or eyeballs, but these behaviors obviously touch moral and legal bottom lines, Li Liang, a law professor in Beijing, told The Peoples Daily in April.  Xi, preparing for what is likely to be a third term as Communist Party leader beginning next year, will use a gathering of the party elite in Beijing next week to adopt a new resolution on the partys history  an official summation of the past and its lessons. Among Chinese leaders, only Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping have enacted such decisions, underscoring the ambition of Xis campaign.  We need to educate and guide the whole party to vigorously carry forward the red tradition, Xi said this year.  The tougher slander law took effect shortly after the disclosure by the government in February that four Chinese soldiers had died during a clash with Indian troops along the disputed border in June 2020. Within days, at least seven people were charged for questioning the official version of the death toll, which was reportedly much higher.  They included Qiu Ziming, a prominent blogger with 2.5 million followers on Weibo, the countrys Twitter-like social media platform.  Although he and the others were arrested under a long-standing article in the criminal code called picking quarrels and provoking troubles, Qiu, 38, was prosecuted under the new law, even though the changes went into effect 10 days after he made his comments.  In May, after being shown confessing on state television, he was sentenced to eight months in prison.  The campaign has inspired vigilantism, with internet users calling out potential violations.  The Jiangsu branch of China Unicom, a state-owned telecommunications company, came under investigation after a public uproar started when its Weibo account posted a recipe for fried rice on what was Mao Anyings birthday. It is not clear whether the company faces criminal charges, but its account was suspended.  Some of the cases involved historical events that historians in China have previously debated and studied, at least until now.  Last month, a former journalist, Luo Changping, was detained in Hainan after he wrote a blog questioning the rationale for Chinas intervention in the Korean War  and the catastrophic cost for those volunteers sent to fight and die in it.  He was responding to a new movie blockbuster that depicts a major Chinese attack known as The Battle at Lake Changjin.  The movie, which runs 2 hours and 56 minutes, brims with maudlin patriotism for the selfless sacrifice of soldiers who defeated the U.S.-led forces.  Half a century later, few Chinese people have reflected on the justifiability of the war, Luo wrote on Weibo, before referring specifically to a doomed Chinese military unit that did not doubt the wise decision of the top.  Made with government backing and heavily promoted in state media, it has become the second-highest grossing film in the countrys history, earning the equivalent of $855 million in the month it has been showing, according to Maoyan, the ticketing service.  When the film opened, Ni, the researcher, noted on Twitter that the battle it depicts had not previously been a focus of the Communist Partys propaganda before because it had been seen as a costly strategic blunder, not the resounding victory portrayed on the screen. Now it has become part of a new and unassailable version of history.  John Delury, a professor of Chinese studies at Yonsei University in Seoul and author of a forthcoming book about the war, said that even within the limits of political censorship, Chinese scholars have done a lot of great work on the war and other historical events since the founding of the Peoples Republic of China.  With the shifting political climate, that may no longer be safe.  With this, obviously, everyone is going to have to stop what theyre doing, he said.","Shutting down historical debate, China makes it a crime to mock heroes",RICE

The Collector was responding to the media reports and comments made by the High Court recently on a petition filed by farmer on the comments made by him that he would not care even orders of High Court or Supreme Court if a shop was closed for selling paddy seeds.  The sale of spurious seeds has been a serious problem plaguing the farmers in the district and strict measures were warranted to curb the same. In this regard, certain shops were sealed and a few cases were registered. The sale of spurious seeds would destroy the lands of the farmers and would cause irreparable loss to the farmers and in that context, the dealers of such spurious seeds were informed not to deal or sell spurious seeds and that strict action will be taken against them. In such context, it was noticed that the dealers are filing cases against cancellation of licences by suppressing facts before the Courts.  The Rabi paddy will have high broken percentage on milling and not suitable for delivery of raw rice. Telangana region is a high temperature region and particularly in some parts of Siddipet district the issue of broken rice and the instructions of the FCI in relation to the stoppage of Parboiled rice from the State of Telangana needed to be addressed. The position of production of paddy for the next season was also discussed. The pros and cons of the same have also been deliberated. However, it was noticed that some dealers who were dealing in spurious seeds were also present in the said meeting. Having noticed their presence, I have stated that even if such dealers are suppressing the facts and obtaining orders, I will apprise the courts about the correct position and even if orders are granted, we will get the same vacated by stating our stand before the courts. This was the purported intention of my statements; however, it has been reported in the media, that I have made certain statements against the Courts. The sequence of the words spoken by me are projected to appear as though I have stated the same in the context of cultivation of paddy for the next season and the supply of paddy seeds by the dealers, said the Collector in the statement.  I am aware of the implications of any statement made against the Judiciary and have always bowed down to the majesty of the courts and never meant any disrespect to any court during my career and have acted only in the general interests of the public within the parameters of the law.

Even the packing containers price has gone up from  1,400 to  3,800, he informs.

However, the whole of last week till October 31, Sri Ramana Vidhyalaya Matriculation High School in West Tambaram was kept open for a different use. The premises of the school was used to dry rice and pulses and prepare sweets.  Six friends gathered at the school to prepare Deepavali sweets. They are all members of a group called Nam Parambariyam meaning our tradition.  The school has a kitchen but they preferred an open corridor as the cooking entailed deep frying in oil. The week-long preparation got over by 8 p.m. on October 31 and Chandra Selvamani who runs the school and is a member of the group, stayed back to tidy up the corridor to welcome students the next day.  The friends group were against buying ready-made sweets and savouries, as also the ready-to-cook flour to prepare them. They would not buy basic ingredient like flours of rice and pulses from the retailers either. Other things struck off the list: refined sugar, refined oil, maida and polished white rice available in markets. Instead, they took the extra effort to source heirloom rice varieties, millets, cold-pressed oil and other essential ingredients directly from farmers who are said to be practising organic farming and ghee and butter from dairies that are said to have native cow breeds.  We made Murukku and Thattai from an heirloom rice called Thooyamali. Instead of the polished rice, we used Thinai, a millet to make Adhirasam. Unprocessed sugars  Kandhasari, Karuppatti, Panakalkandu, Vellam and Nattu Sarkarai were used as sweetening agents as a healthy alternative to refined white sugar. Halwa was made from Kambu, another millet, replacing wheat. We avoided wheat because it is said to contain gluten which poses health risks, says J. Mohaneshawari, another member of the group. This is the first Deepavali the group has come together to prepare sweets.  Group cooking has helped us to make a wide range of sweets and savouries. We have made Kaju Katli, Coconut Burfi, Adhirasam, Murukku, Laddu, Halwa, and Ribbon Pakoda. Each of us has got close to six kilograms of all these snacks. We are yet to arrive at the cost for each person. However, approximately, it should be .1,500. Had we bought from a shop, the same six kg consisting of all these items would easily touch .4,000, says J. Mohaneshwari.  Nam Parambariyam group was formed in 2018 to revive indigenous rice varieties and millets and to evolve recipes that promote both health and taste. Earlier, we tried recipes to make Idlis with Poongar rice, Puttu with rice varieties Kavuni and Kullakar and Mappilai Chamba rice to prepare Idiyappam. In all these recipes, our aim was to do away with the polished white rice which is considered unhealthy, says Chandra Selvamani.

Despite a spike in instances of farm fires from Punjab and Haryana this week, they arent a contributor to the quality, according to meteorological analysts.  There were close to 2,700 instances of stubble burning on Wednesday and on Tuesday, 3000 instances recorded from Punjab, 203 from Haryana and 87 from Uttar Pradesh. The contribution of biomass burning in PM2.5 concentration is likely to be less than 5% as winds are not favourable for transportation of pollutants, according to an analysis from the Air Quality Early Warning System of the Ministry of Earth Sciences.  The air quality over Delhi is likely to remain poor, at least until November 6 and then improve from an anticipated rise in windspeeds. Moisture and the lack of adequate winds also lower the mixing height that then retards the natural dispersion of pollutants. A mixing height less than 6,000 m with average wind speed less than 10 kmph is unfavourable for dispersion of pollutants. Currently the mixing depths are around 1,700 m and windspeeds less than 10 kmph.  A note on Wednesday from the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) said instances of stubble burning and farm fires from Punjab and Haryana were down by 50% from last year.  The active paddy residue burning events in Punjab, Haryana, NCR districts of Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan and the National Capital Territory of Delhi have come down from 43,918 in 2020 to 21,364 in 2021 during September 15-November 2, thus registering an overall reduction in the fire counts by 22,554.  The hotspots of paddy residue burning in Punjab are Tarn Taran, Amritsar, Firozpur, Patiala, Ludhiana and Kapurthala. Similarly, the hotspots in Haryana are Kaithal, Karnal, Kurukshetra, Fatehabad, Ambala and Jind.  So far, 8,575 fields where stubble burning was reported have been inspected by the enforcement agencies and officials of the respective States and Environmental Compensation (EC) of about 58,05,000 has been imposed, according to the CAQM.  This year instances of stubble burning, according to CAQM in a communique last month, were expected to be low as the acreage under non-basmati rice crop was lower than in previous years. Steps have also been taken to disincentivise farmers from burning.  Monsoon rainfall in September was unusually high this year and extended into the northern States much beyond their normal tenure leading to delayed harvesting.",Air quality in Delhi drops to seasonal low despite 50% cut in stubble burning,RICE

Substantial areas of banana and tapioca plantations have been lost either to heavy winds or flooding.  Agriculture Department sources said that banana plants easily succumb to winds while tapioca is vulnerable to flooding of fields. Both these natural phenomena have been continuously witnessed in taluks like Muvattupuzha and Kothamangalam.  While preparations for rice cultivation in the ensuing season have been disrupted seriously because of heavy rain, there has also been loss of vegetable crops due to heavy downpour throughout the district. Sources pointed out that the winter season paddy cultivation is more extensive in Ernakulam district than the first season paddy cultivation. Heavy rain has been a stumbling block to field preparations for the new season.  It is now estimated that the crop losses due to bad weather conditions up to the middle of October could be around 12 crore. Areas where farming activities are robust like Angamaly, Malayattoor, Kalady, Muvattupuzha, Koothattukulam, Perumbavoor and Kothamangalam have seen heavy crop losses.  Meanwhile, Agriculture Minister P. Prasad has said that a corpus would be constituted, in consultation with the Finance Department, to help farmers who suffer crop losses because of the current climatic conditions. A communication from the Ministers office said that the total loss, between October 12 and October 28, amounted to 451 crore across the State.

Mr. Anil said the department had set its sights on launching smart ration cards with embedded integrated circuit (IC) early next year. In addition to the features of the new card, the smart card would enable cash transactions similar to those with ATM cards through ration outlets. Talks were under way with various companies to realise the project.  The Government had initiated steps to establish own godowns in each taluk to phase out the use of the existing rented facilities.

But many considering to make the switch worry about perhaps the only con of a vegan lifestyle, which is the reduced intake of protein. The lack of adequate protein can take a toll on the body as protein is essential for cellular function and is the building block of muscles. Also, the missing umami, which is essentially the taste and texture of meat, may be off-putting to many.  But, the Council Of Scientific And Industrial Research-Centre For Cellular And Molecular Biology (CSIR-CCMB), Hyderabad, is finding ways to bring about mass slaughter-free meat culture by retaining different tastes and textures of various muscle cells and edible organs, apart from working on making nature-identical proteins in their lab.  According to Dr N Madhusudhan Rao, CEO of Atal Incubation Centre - CCMB, the con that complex protein can only come from a slaughtered animal is a myth that CCMB is trying to bust. Avoiding cattle slaughter and doing away with the use of dairy products could reduce an individuals carbon footprint from food by up to 70 per cent. Cultured meat is the need of the hour because we have to feed 10 billion people globally by 2050 by creating a platform for tasty, affordable protein, he says.  Relying on steroids and synthetic growth hormones for cattle fattening is not sustainable as it has harmful effects on the human body. Besides, the cattle industry uses a lot of antibiotics to keep livestock disease-free in congested spaces -- making the animal unhealthy for us, he adds. According to him, cultured meat can be a healthier alternative as no steroids, growth hormones or antibiotics are used. It is nature-identical and non-synthetic because the scientists rely on tissue culture -- which involves taking a single cell or a tissue from a healthy animal and growing it in the lab. Many companies have come up across the world, which are selling cultured meat, but, the texture remains flat. We are trying to culture meat by keeping its form, texture and taste in tact.  We are not compromising on complex proteins, the scientist says. Soon, they will also be focusing on making meat-like texture and form using plant extracts for vegetarians. Dairy-free dairy products to meat-free chicken, all these innovative foods are making it easy for people to treat their taste buds without harming animals, says People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) India Vegan Foods and nutrition specialist, Dr Kiran Ahuja. We have companies in India making vegetarian shell-less eggs from peas, sorghum and other plants. Soya, almond, coconut, cashew and rice milks are already there. There is also plant-based ghee, buttermilk and cheese, says Dr Kiran.  Experts have also hinted that in addition to sparing animals lives, turning vegan reduces the risk of chronic diseases and helps fight climate change. For instance, its known that Covid-19 came from a live-animal meat market, while SARS, swine flu and bird flu are also linked with confining and killing animals for food. The world is seeing a slow vegetarian revolution because meat is not as safe as it was thought to be and it is not sustainable in the long run, says Dr Madhusudhan.  While the world just celebrated World Vegan Day, many people planning to make the switch worry that they would be depriving their bodies of essential protein. But scientists at CCMB, who are working on making nature-identical proteins in their lab, say that it is possible to satisfy the craving for umami in a sustainable way",Innovating with protein to promote veganism,RICE

These fearsome fish, which can grow up to 5 feet in length and weigh 80 pounds, have around 500 needlelike teeth sticking out of jaws that are strong enough to crush crustaceans.  Having so many sharp chompers allows these ambush predators to subdue everything from slippery squid to heavily armored crabs. How lingcod maintain the sharpness of their terrifying teeth has long been a mystery. But a study, published in October in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B, claims that Pacific lingcod keep their teeth sharp and shiny by replacing about 3% of them every day. For a lingcod, thats a whopping 20 teeth replaced daily. If you replaced your teeth at the same rate, you might lose and gain a new tooth every day  ouch!  Calling all #TeamFish! @Karly_Cohen, @Fishguy_FHL, and Is new paper shows the crazy tooth replacement rate in the Pacific lingcod: 20 new teeth per day! The moment of tooth: rate, fate and pattern of Pacific lingcod dentition revealed by pulse-chasehttps://t.co/9L3EbP6f8N  Emily Carr (@EmilyCarr42) October 25, 2021  Much of what scientists know about tooth replacement in fishes comes from sharks, which have multiple rows of teeth inside their jaws that are constantly being replenished, and other fish with unusual teeth. But shark teeth differ in significant ways from those found in the majority of fishes, which is why the lingcod findings could help scientists better understand the phenomenon of tooth replacement in fishes.  Around 20% of Pacific lingcod have fluorescent green or blue meat, and scientists arent sure why this happens. The fish are considered a smart seafood choice, and delicious when battered and fried. But otherwise, they are fairly average. Their teeth are similar to many other fishes, which is one of the reasons they serve as a really nice model for studying teeth in fish, says Karly Cohen, a doctoral candidate at the University of Washington and a co-author of the new study.  In order to determine the frequency at which lingcod replace their teeth, Cohen and her colleagues kept 20 lingcod at the University of Washingtons Friday Harbor Laboratories and tracked how many teeth they lost and regrew over several days.  The fish were placed in a tank of seawater infused with a red dye that stained their teeth, then returned to their regular tank for 10 days. When the 10 days were up, the fish were placed in a tank containing a green dye, then euthanised and examined. The teeth that were present since the start of the experiment were both red and green, whereas the new teeth were only green.  After collecting and examining a total of 10,000 teeth, the scientists were able to determine how quickly lingcod lost and regrew their teeth and which teeth were replaced most often.  Its absolutely crazy how many teeth they replace, said Emily Carr, an undergraduate researcher at the University of South Florida and the lead author of the study. Carr, who counted all 10,000 teeth by herself, noticed tooth replacement did not occur at the same frequency across the lingcods jaws.  Also read | How a threatened fish species highlights climate racism against indigenous peoples in the US  Lingcod, like most fish, have two sets of jaws: oral jaws and pharyngeal jaws. Their oral jaws are used to capture and crush prey while their pharyngeal jaws, which are positioned in their throats, are used to chew their food and move it from their mouths to the stomach. Carr and colleagues found that teeth are replaced more frequently in the back of the mouth, where most of the chomping and crushing take place.  The way lingcod replace their teeth is likely crucial to their hunting strategy, says Kory Evans, a fish ecologist at Rice University in Houston. The duller a lingcods teeth are, the harder it is going to be for it to hold on to its prey. So having the ability to shed teeth and replace them is pretty important. In order to make it as a lingcod, Evans said, you need sharp pointy teeth and all your teeth need to be on point.  The researchers also found that, much like in humans, tooth replacement in lingcod is predetermined, which means teeth are replaced by teeth of the same type and teeth dont grow bigger over time.  Cohen and her colleagues hope that their study will help scientists demystify the world of fish dentition and inspire others to study more fish species. Evans said he hopes some enterprising researchers will take a closer look in the mouth of the sheepshead fish.  They have these weird, gross, humanlike teeth and Ive got to know whats going on there, he said. The people deserve to know.

Tourists  even the few who do visit the state  rarely come here, preferring instead the regions mighty waterfalls, the deep quiet of its emerald forests, and the colour and pageantry of its tribal culture. The chefs and I, however, are on a voyage of another kind  to discover the regions ingredients and cuisine, on a state-sponsored visit that eventually aims to promote gastronomic tourism in the region.  By the time we drive in at noon, Vishrampur (literally a place of rest) is belying its name; it is caught up in the bustle of its weekly haat (market). Villagers from the interiors are here with whatever they have grown, caught or made, seeking to make some Diwali profit. There are beautifully glazed clay diyas (earthen lamps), 12 for 200, which may command 10 times the price in the metros, thick metal work anklets, dhokra art and colourful cloth bags and sheets. And then there are the giant pumpkins.  Chefs Prateek Sadhu, Manish Mehrotra with Anoothi Vishal | Photo Credit: Special Arrangement  A solitary reaper sits beside two to three of these, each seemingly weighing 30-40 kg. Next to her is a tribeswoman selling tumba or the equally gigantic bottle gourd, still green. Here is the raw material for the tumba art (where the dried vegetable is used to make lamps, sculptures and bric--brac) that shows up in arty living rooms in Delhi and Mumbai. But I want to know more about the vegetables. What are these? I ask Mukesh, the affable security officer who has been accompanying us. Containers for water, he says simply. The gourds and pumpkins, allowed to stay on the vine for months to grow to this size, are harvested, scooped hollow, dried and used as containers to store water (or salfi, the local fruit beer). Kamandal, or the ancient water pot of wandering holy men in Indian myth, was apparently a hollowed out pumpkin too, I later hear.  Sometimes, these are also used to make musical instruments, much like the four-stringed tanpura from Miraj in southern Maharashtra, a town revered for its now disappearing art of making stringed musical instruments. This plant art must have possibly originated here, in the depths of the jungle, where ancient sounds and customs persist.  Flavours from the haat  The chefs, meanwhile, are besotted with another tradition: bhajiyas (fritters)! Fresh from a wok, these are irresistible anywhere in the markets of India. Here in Vishrampur, Mehrotra and Sadhu are studying the technique of crispiness and quizzing local makers about batters. But the proof of the pakora is in the eating. So, I am called to pass the verdict. I bite into a crisp green chilli fritter that could give any tempura in a good Japanese restaurant a run for its money.  When it comes to fried snacks, gulgul bhajiya is Chhattisgarhs most interesting offering. It is usually sweet, and made with gram dal. It reminds you of the gulgule of Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and Bihar, which are sweet round fritters made from refined wheat flour batter.  Fresh fritters at the haat | Photo Credit: Special Arrangement  Because so many dishes from the state are similar to others from around the country, chef Mehrotra wonders what can distinguish Chhattisgarh food from other cuisines. He also has in mind the meal from the night before  where we were served the local version of bari (fermented dal dumplings), which is more spongy than its counterpart in Punjab or Bengal, yams, greens such as bohar bhaji thats grown uniquely in Chhattisgarh, and urad dal (black lentils). He advocates an approach where just 10-20 dishes unique to Chhattisgarh are catalogued to showcase to tourists.  When borders blur  But I am leaning towards a deeper approach: one where, if uniqueness must be studied, so should similarities and parallels, since this region of central India has a continuity of culture with parts of Maharashtra, Orissa and Madhya Pradesh, from which it was carved out.  My most interesting discovery happens while we taste a simple dish of black lentils for dinner. A distinct goda masala flavour from Pune is at once apparent. But why would black lentils in Chhattisgarh taste of this spice mix?  The next day, I quiz the cook, who brings me the packaged spice blend she uses. Made in Jagdalpur (Bastars capital), it has writing in Oriya (the region has many cultural similarities with tribes of Orissa), but the ingredients fortunately are listed in English. Among these, I find a rather colourfully-dubbed chabila spice, roughly translated as somebody who is pretty and cultivates their appearance.  Chabila turns out to be none other than that most powerful and unique of Deccani spices, the dagadh ka phool, or lichen that grows on rocks. Alternatively called kalpasi, it gives the distinctive deep favour to Maharashtrian, Hyderabadi and Chettinad spicing. It later occurs to me that this region saw Maratha rule in the 18th century. Culinary history often follows political conquest, we must remember too.  Scenes from the market | Photo Credit: Special Arrangement  Building on the local  There are other cultural similarities. That we are in the rice bowl of India is evident in dishes such as farre, or pasta-like dumplings sprinkled with sesame, a breakfast item. Farre is now disappearing from eastern Uttar Pradesh and Bundelkhand (where maida casings are filled with ground gram dal). I am yet to establish a connection. Meanwhile, the chefs are unanimous that farre can be gentrified in their restaurants with bits of bacon and whatnot.  Then, there is the culinary congruence with village practices from Orissa, where paddy fields give a valuable source of protein to the poor  fish. My Oriya friend, Sujata Dehury, says that smoking small freshwater fish (jhuri) was a practice in her home, when paddy fields were drained. The fish was caught, sorted according to size, and the smallest was smoked on tin sheets on open charcoal fires, to be preserved for later use. This seems to be the practice here, too. The women at the haat say they fry the smoked fish in oil and add it to any bhaji or green they are cooking that day.  Dried fish on sale | Photo Credit: Special Arrangement  Where is the fabled red ant chutney, though? We have been ruing its elusiveness and the fact that it is only available immediately after the monsoon (as also some varieties of mushroom that chef Sadhu is interested in). We should come back for longer, spend at least 10-15 days here looking at ingredients like bamboo and berries, says chef Sadhu, for whom Vishrampur is foraging heaven. He has been plucking bits of lavender-like grass to determine if it could be made into a chutney.  Back in Raipur, Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel invites us to his home for tea. He has gone out of his way to procure all his favourite local sweets and snacks. There is khurmi, made with rice and wheat flours, and deep fried, khoya jalebi made with milk solids, mahua, dried ginger laddoos and more. As we sip a mahua sherbet, cooling and fragrant, it is clear that this is not the stereotypical alcohol liqueur we all associate with the flower. Ingredients can have diverse uses, and there is potential for Chhattisgarhi dishes to be widely popular. We just need to come back and delve deeper into the states bounty.",For a taste of Chhattisgarh,RICE
2021-11-06,https://indianexpress.com/article/india/sunday-story-lakhimpur-to-gorakhpur-7610646/,"As you enter Lakhimpur by road, Priyanka Gandhi seems larger on the Congress hoardings. There she is, smiling widely, alongside a local leader, while Rahul Gandhi has now joined their mother Sonia and former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in the ceremonial line-up of smaller picture boxes at the top. You cant miss, either, the wall writings and posters felicitating Union Minister of State for Home Ajay Mishra Teni and his son, Ashish Mishra or Monu Bhaiyya, who belong to Nighasan which falls in this district.  Ashish Mishra  currently in jail for the incident at Lakhimpur on October 3, in which four farmers were mowed down by a car owned by the minister, and four more were killed in the retaliatory violence  is on the BJP poster not because he is a party leader or office-bearer. He isnt. But as they tell you here matter-of-factly, he is mantri putra (ministers son). Ahead of the 2022 polls, he was/is also prabal daawedar (strong contender) for the BJP ticket. Nighasan janata ki pukaar, Monu bhaiyya ab ki baar.  Also Read | Lakhimpur Kheri: Meet the Mishras  Both the Congress and BJP hoardings can give a misleading first impression to the reporter who has arrived here to set off on a longer journey  from the scene of crime in Lakhimpur to Gorakhpur, the chief ministers constituency.  If the Congress hoardings exaggerate the presence of Priyanka and the party in UP, the BJP posters do not tell that the apparently fond nicknames Teni Maharaj and Monu Bhaiyya mask something akin to awe and fear with which local residents regard the father-son duo  the minister, seen as a bahubali or strongman, is no stranger to the criminal case or controversy.  A month on, and ahead of Assembly elections early next year, what happened at Lakhimpur Kheri is not an event that is shaping a new politics. It has subsided into an inset in a larger political drama, in which both Priyanka Gandhi and the father-son of Nighasan are bit players.  Priyanka Gandhi was earlier stopped from visiting Lakhimpur Kheri. (PTI) Priyanka Gandhi was earlier stopped from visiting Lakhimpur Kheri. (PTI)  ****  At the site of the October 3 incident in Tikonia, a yellow tape flutters alongside a plastic rope that cordons off the low-lying areas on both sides of a narrow road. On the yellow tape, written in black, is the stentorian injunction: Police Crime Scene Do Not Disturb. No one takes note, as traffic kicks up dust as usual on the road and, on both sides, paddy fields stretch into the distance.  What happened in Tikonia has travelled farther afield, through viral videos and TV, and it has also been carried by politics.  The spread is not even, of course. On the route to Gorakhpur, via Bahraich and Gonda, there are pockets and swathes where Lakhimpur still means a place, not an event. In this belt, streaked with several rivers and dense with jungle areas running along the Nepal border, large numbers still live in dread of frequent floods and the animals who venture out from the forests.  While the pandemic is seen as a receding crisis, the urgent refrain is about mehengai or rising prices, especially of petrol and diesel, and about rice selling below MSP and the sugarcane dues still unpaid. There is talk of berozgaari or unemployment and chhutta janwar. The last refers to the pervasive problem in UP of abandoned cattle wreaking havoc on crops ever since the Yogi government cracked down on cow slaughter.  In a people beset with these and other problems in common, Lakhimpur, the event, where it has reached, touches the divides, some active, some latent.  To begin with, a distinction is made among farmers, between Sikh migrants and those who are the original inhabitants of the Terai, called sardar and desi respectively. This, then, connects to other cleavages and divides  between majority and minority, Hindu and Muslim, BJP and non-BJP.  More broadly, Lakhimpur Kheri appears subsumed in a dominant narrative that has been driving another wedge  which may also be blunting at least some of the caste divisions on the ground. In UP today, in this belt at least, you are either with those who consider suraksha (safety) to be the overriding issue, or against them.  The former, loud and vehement, hold that a conspiracy is afoot against the nation, by internal and external enemies, which includes the protesters or aandolankari.  A conversation on Lakhimpur begins on the same standard note: Durbhagyapurna tha, dukhad tha, nahi hona chahiye tha (it was unfortunate, should not have happened). And then it forks into different versions.  The provocation was the ministers speech, in which he threatened the farmers earlier, says Aftab Alam, berozgar (unemployed) in Nighasan. It was planned killing, no accident, says Hoshiar Singh, a farmer from Ramnagar village. The killing of BJP workers was a reaction, they say, to the first crime.  The videos dont show it, but there were actually four events that day, says Monu Dikshit, a farmer in Nighasan. First, the targeting of BJP hoardings and cars. Then, sticks were wielded by the sardars, the cars window panes were broken. It was after this that the car went out of control. Lastly, BJP workers were beaten to death.  Agar dekha jaaye, shuruaat upadraviyon ne ki thi (rowdy elements started it). If you want to protest, there is a system for that. You cant break the system, says former pradhan Raja Ram Maurya in Babar Pur village, about 4 km from the scene of the crime.  Munna Lal Vishwakarma, in the same village, sums up the aftermath of Lakhimpur: Kabhi kabhar aankhon dekha, kaanon ka suna bhi jhootha ho jaata hai (sometimes you cannot believe what you see and hear).  If many separate sardar from kisan, others blur the line between farmer and upadravi (riotous or unruly). This is prodded and aided by the framing of Lakhimpur by the dominant party in UP.  Suraksha mukhya mudda hai (security is the main issue), says district BJP chief Sunil Singh at the party office in Lakhimpur. He speaks grimly about videshi taakatein or foreign forces.  At the sprawling, heavily policed Gorakhnath math-mandir complex, home of Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath in Gorakhpur  where an exhortation to distrust, Kisi aparichit par vishwas na karein, is pasted on walls and boards  Dwarka Tiwari, secretary in-charge of the math, evades a direct question on Lakhimpur. And speaks of asuraksha ka mahaul (climate of insecurity) in desh-pradesh (state and nation) against which Yogi ji-Modi ji stand as a bulwark.  ****  Daljeet Singh Virk was one of the four farmers killed in Lakhimpur Kheri on October 3. At his home in village Banjaran Tanda, district Bahraich, silences are long and heavy, as family members struggle for words. We still think, gaya hai, aa jaayega (he will be back), says his elder brother Jagjit Singh.  In a framed photo, taken on the day he died, is a trim man, wearing a black-blue turban and an orange T-shirt, a yellow scarf folded loosely around his neck. He is carrying a flag across his shoulder as he looks straight into the camera.  He liked to wear branded clothes, was very polite, never got into a fight, his relatives say. On days that his wife, who works at the local aanganwadi, brought home a friend, he would insist on dropping her back home. His 16-year-old-son Rajdeep Singh was with him on that fateful day. Parneet Kaur, 20, his daughter who studies nursing in Lucknow, says, He would participate in the farmers programmes. He wanted me to study and for my brother to join the Army.  There cannot be a fair investigation till he (MoS Mishra) is removed (from office), says Daljeets wife, Paramjit Kaur.  Daljeets family lives in a jhala, or a homestead in the fields, on the edge of the village. In Bahraich, as in Lakhimpur and Pilibhit, the Sikhs who came to UP after Partition and in the years after that, were often given uninhabited and inhospitable jungle lands. They tamed and cultivated these, and built their homes in the fields in which they worked, outside the village.  Jungle tha, hamne basa diya (we made it productive), says Daljeets uncle Charanjit Singh.  A similar pride is visible in sections of the Sikh community that live in the UP town, in settlements like Punjabi Colony in Lakhimpur. We came here in 1947, and by 1958, we had set up our social works, says Sewak Singh Ajmani, a businessman who also runs community schools.  Today, the farmers movement against the Centres three farm laws finds vocal support in Sikh families like Daljeets, who live in the geographically scattered jhalas. But the scatter of the homesteads-in-fields may also be circumscribing the movements coherence and spread.  Agitation against the farm laws does not seem to have caught on in the smaller farmers among the desis, who are far more poorly off than their counterparts in Punjab. Our children cannot go abroad, to America or Canada, says Sameer Khan, a farmer, in Nighasan. We go out to work as labour in the factories in Himachal or Uttarakhand, and that too after borrowing money for the bus fare.  Apart from inconvenient geography and a greater burden of poverty, a largely leaderless agitation is up against a party that prides itself on its machine  the coming election will see one BJP worker for every 60 voters, per booth 20 youth, they say at the BJPs office in Lakhimpur.  BJP MLA from Bahraich, Anupama Jaiswal, who was minister in the Yogi government till a year ago, has not visited Daljeet Singhs bereaved family in the same district. It is not necessary that everyone should go I am satisfied with the way my government is proceeding on the issue, she says.  ****  Not everyone speaks about Lakhimpur, but as the Assembly election draws nearer, almost everyone talks of the impending polarisation.  Some talk of the coming divisiveness with a sense of helplessness  as if the people will have no role to play, as if they will be swept up by forces larger than them, that are outside them and inside them too.  In the Nishad belt that stretches from Gorakhpurs Mahewa Mandi to its rural fringe  jostling for this backward caste vote has already begun, with Priyanka Gandhi making specific promises to fishermen at her Pratigya rally held here on October 31  Param Nishad, a property dealer, says that the government is trying to suppress the truth in Lakhimpur, and that it is not listening to farmers opposing the farm laws. He talks of police utpeedan (harassment), recalls the case of the businessman killed during a police raid at a Gorakhpur hotel. Two issues are important, he says: Price rise and tanashahi (authoritarianism).  But he is scared, says Nishad. Andar ka dar hai, aisa kuch na ho jaye ki main badal jaaoon (I fear that something might happen that will change me). Last time, there was Pulwama.  At his home in the citys Maitripuram colony, S K Tiwari, who taught psychology at St Andrews PG College, also shares a sense of foreboding. Aane wale dinon mein aapas mein baithna mushkil ho jaayega (in days to come, it may become difficult for people to sit together).  Prof Tiwari tells a story close to home. Just outside this colony, a mazaar (Muslim shrine) is coming in the way of the construction of a drain, work has stopped for about two months. But when a group of residents wanted to submit an application to the CMs portal on the issue, one of them, a Yadav, held back. The administration will be less responsive if they see a Yadav name, he said.  The professor himself feels torn. Upar ka avaran budhijeevi ka hai, par andar kya pal raha hai  Hindu ki tarah soch rahe hain (the facade is that of an intellectual, but I sense a Hindu inside me). I am 60 plus, at this age I am changing. Kuch ghul mil gaya hai, aab-o-hawa mein (something has infiltrated the very air).  At the Muslim mohalla in village Noorpur in Bahraich, they tell the story of the moorti (idol of a deity) that appeared in the burial ground some years ago. This Navratri, again, the moorti was taken in a procession of vehicles over the ground where our ancestors are laid to rest. In the name of keeping the peace, the police placed us under house arrest, says Mijjan Khan.  And in Gonda, Dhananjay Mani Tripathi, zilla maha mantri, Hindu Yuva Vahini, a saffron outfit founded by Yogi Adityanath in Gorakhpur in 2002, talks of its social work and prashasan ka sahyog (coordination with the administration). He describes the Vahinis campaign against Hindu-Muslim marriages.  Two months ago, when the Vahini heard of a case of a Hindu woman marrying a Muslim man in Colonelganj thana area, it rushed in. Due to its efforts, says Tripathi, there was ladki ki baramadgi 24 ghante mein (recovery of the woman within 24 hours).  He swats away the question of consent: Hamaari behnein udaar hain, unki udaarta ka faayda leke (Hindu girls are naive, they are being exploited).  ****  Priyanka Gandhis rally filled the Champa Devi Park in Gorakhpur, and many say it was the Congresss most successful programme here in three decades. The Congress has embarked on political activity in UP, especially after Lakhimpur, with Priyanka leading the charge. And yet, even Congress supporters talk of a possible revival in the state only by the election after this one.  The BSPs airtight top-down command structure seems strikingly out of step with the political agility demanded in times of the BJP. At his home-office in Gonda town, Haji Mohammad Zaki, who fought the nagarpalika chairman election from the BSP earlier, and is a ticket aspirant in the coming poll, says Party ka nirdesh-aadesh hoga toh iske ailawa hum nahi kar sakte (we can only do something when the party tells us to).  The Samajwadi Party is the BJPs intimate enemy in UP. Many who profess support to the BJP government still do so while pointing a finger at earlier SP regimes  for their perceived failure to uphold the law, especially in cases of crime or hooliganism involving members of the minority community; for their alleged favouritism to Muslims and Yadavs; for the inability to rise above family. Akhilesh Yadav is trying to change the SP, many say, but he is still being pulled in different directions within the family and party.  Yogi Adityanath is widely credited with improving law and order in the state, even though often, the commendation seems to be approval for cracking down on high-profile criminals belonging to specific communities.  But on Lakhimpur, and other issues, it is not easy to be in the Oppositions shoes in Yogis UP.  In Bahraich, district SP president Ram Harsh Yadav and senior vice president Zafarullah Khan, a founder member of the SP, say that they were placed under house arrest after Lakhimpur, and on several occasions before that. If CM Yogi comes to Bahraich, a day before his programme, we are likely to be put under house arrest. This curbing of the Opposition party did not happen in any previous regime, says Yadav.  Local journalists in Bahraich count the instances in recent months when SP leaders were reportedly placed under house arrest: after Lakhimpur; when the CM came to Bahraich to unveil a statue of Maharana Pratap close to a college in the city; ahead of his visit to inaugurate the expansion of the memorial to Maharaja Suheldev, who has now become a prominent cultural figurehead in the political courting of the Rajbhar community; ahead of the CMs trip to oversee flood relief operations in Bahraich.  We dont even come to know when Section 144 is imposed, says SP spokesperson Zafar Amin Dakku in Gorakhpur. And Anil Dubey, a young Congress leader in Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Gorakhpur University, who was active in the ABVP during the SP regime, says: The difference is this: In this government, the police rush to the spot more quickly if an effigy is being burnt by a political group than if there is a chain snatching.  BJP MLA Anupama Jaiswal denies that her partys government is curbing the Oppositions political activity: I have not heard of SP leaders being put under house arrest in Bahraich. And in Lakhimpur, district BJP chief Sunil Singh says: There is nothing extraordinary about imposing Section 144 It is the people who are supreme in a democracy. What does one say about an Opposition that doesnt even have the numbers to be recognised as such? These are not parties, but properties of families.  ****  In the classroom in Bahraichs Kisan PG College, a group of about 45 young women students argue about Lakhimpur and other things.  They are divided on the big questions  roughly half of the group thinks MoS Mishra must step down because of the case against his son. The father must not be blamed for his sons deeds. And protesters must only protest on designated spots, says Shivani Singh. But if you only protest at designated spots, how will you draw attention, make an impact? says Seema Tiwari.  A majority in the classroom say the Internet should not have been shut down after Lakhimpur. I had to fill a scholarship form, and couldnt. The government should have managed things differently, says Chandni Chauhan.  The classroom is divided, again, on the arrest of students in UP, under sedition charges, for raising pro-Pakistan slogans after its cricket victory over India.  Let the students raise slogans, it is only a game. This should not become a big issue, says Aarti Verma. And Ruchi Pandey says: Some slogans can be unwise, but the government could have counselled the students. It is wrong to put them in jail.  Aarti and Ruchi may be staking out a possible middle ground that seems increasingly shaky outside their classroom, from Lakhimpur to Gorakhpur, in UP.","Lakhimpur to Gorakhpur, familiar fault lines are widening ahead of Assembly polls",RICE
2021-11-06,https://indianexpress.com/article/world/near-daily-covid-19-tests-sleeping-in-classrooms-life-in-covid-zero-china-7609863/,"Written by Vivian Wang and Joy Dong  The southwestern Chinese city of Ruili is small, remote and largely unknown internationally. It is also, when it comes to the coronavirus, perhaps the most tightly regulated place on earth.  In the past year, it has been locked down four times, one lasting 26 days. Homes in an entire district have been evacuated indefinitely to create a buffer zone against imported cases. Schools have been closed for months, except for a few grades  but only if those students and their teachers do not leave campus.  Many residents, including 59-year-old Liu Bin, have gone months without income, in a city that relies heavily upon tourism and trade with neighboring Myanmar. Liu, who ran a customs brokerage before cross-border movement essentially stopped, estimated he had lost more than $150,000. He is tested on a near-daily basis. He borrows cigarette money from his son-in-law.  Why do I have to be oppressed like this? My life is important too, he said. Ive actively followed epidemic control measures. What else do we normal people have to do to meet the standards?  As the rest of the world shifts to a strategy of living with the coronavirus, China has remained the last country chasing full elimination, for the most part with success. It has recorded fewer than 5,000 virus-related deaths, and in parts of the country without confirmed cases, the outbreak can feel like a hazy memory.  But the residents of Ruili  a lush, subtropical city of about 270,000 people before the pandemic  are facing the extreme and harsh reality of living under a Zero COVID policy when even a single case is found.  Residents line up for Covid-19 tests near a banner with the words Epidemic is the Order in Wuhan in central Chinas Hubei province Tuesday, Aug. 3, 2021. (Chinatopix Via AP) Residents line up for Covid-19 tests near a banner with the words Epidemic is the Order in Wuhan in central Chinas Hubei province Tuesday, Aug. 3, 2021. (Chinatopix Via AP)  While other Chinese cities have been locked down to control flare-ups, those restrictions have often been limited to certain neighborhoods or been eased after a few weeks. But in Ruili, the past year has consisted of extended paralysis, with people confined to residential complexes for weeks at a time. Even during the gaps between official lockdowns, residents have not been allowed to dine in at restaurants. Many businesses remained closed.  Only high school sophomores and juniors, as well as third-year middle school students, have been allowed to resume face-to-face classes  if they live on campus. Classrooms have been converted to dorms. Since students are always around, they also have classes on weekends.  One driver for a ride-sharing app told state media he had taken 90 COVID-19 tests over the last seven months. Another parent said that his 1-year-old son had been tested 74 times.  Tens of thousands of residents have fled the city for elsewhere in China in the breaks between lockdowns; officials recently acknowledged that the population had dropped to about 200,000. To control the outflow, the authorities now require people to pay for up to 21 days of pre-departure quarantine.  In a sign of the desperation many residents are feeling, a former deputy mayor of Ruili last month wrote a blog post called Ruili Needs the Motherlands Care  a stunning move in a country where officials almost never deviate from the government line.  Every time the city is locked down is another instance of serious emotional and material loss, wrote the official, Dai Rongli. Each experience battling the virus is a new accumulation of grievances.  Ruili has reported just five symptomatic locally transmitted cases in the past month. More than 96% of residents in the city and its surrounding area have been vaccinated, according to state media. No cases have been traced to people leaving Ruili for elsewhere in China.  Even so, officials insist that there is little room for adjustment.  If Ruilis epidemic does not reach zero, there will be risk of outward transmission, Ruilis deputy mayor, Yang Mou, said at a news conference Oct. 29.  Jin Dongyan, a virologist at the University of Hong Kong, said Ruili epitomized the Chinese governments stubborn approach to the pandemic. Since the outbreak began, he said, it has deployed the same playbook of lockdowns and mass testing, without considering potentially less costly tactics.  They believe thats the only way that they can be successful, but that is actually not the case, he said. The situation is rapidly evolving. Now it is actually very different from 2020.  A man wearing a face mask to prevent the spread of COVID-19 walks down a staircase at a shopping mall in Beijing. (AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein) A man wearing a face mask to prevent the spread of COVID-19 walks down a staircase at a shopping mall in Beijing. (AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein)  In recent weeks, other regions have reimposed restrictions as a new outbreak tied to domestic tourism infected more than 700 people. Roughly 10,000 tourists were stranded in Inner Mongolia after cases were found there. About 30,000 visitors to Shanghais Disneyland spent hours waiting to be tested Sunday night before they could leave the park. Parts of Beijing are locked down, and many incoming trains and flights have been canceled.  One county in eastern Jiangxi province announced that all traffic lights would be turned red, to prevent unnecessary travel. (It later backtracked.)  Ruili is uniquely vulnerable to both the virus and the burdens of lockdown.  Nestled in the corner of Yunnan province, it shares more than 100 miles of borders with Myanmar, attracting tourists and traders. In 2019, people passed through its border checkpoint nearly 17 million times, according to official statistics.  When China sealed up the country, trade and tourism all but collapsed. Yet Ruilis borders remained porous, raising fears of imported cases. And the military coup in Myanmar this year has led some to seek refuge in Ruili, legally or illegally. Some residents have had to dodge stray bullets from the conflict across the border, according to Chinese media reports.  The citys remote location and small size also meant that many Chinese people did not know about residents extended plight.  Then, on Oct. 28, Dai, the former deputy mayor, published his blog post.  The pandemic has ruthlessly plundered this city again and again, sucking out its last trace of life, wrote Dai, who now lives in Beijing. The long-term lockdown has brought this citys development to a dead end. Restarting production and necessary business operations appears extremely urgent.  The post went viral. Two hashtags about Dais letter have been viewed 300 million times on Weibo. Dai declined to comment further.  The lockdown has had other, more unexpected effects. The government banned residents from livestreaming about the local jade industry to limit gem orders and the movement of delivery people.  Amid the onslaught of national attention, Ruili officials dismissed the concerns as exaggerated. Mao Xiao, Ruilis Communist Party secretary, told state media that at the moment, we do not need additional help. The day before, he had warned against criminals who he said would use public opinion and false information to disrupt social order.  Still, officials promised to improve quarantine conditions and to bolster financial support for poor residents, through subsidies, gifts of rice and other staples, as well as rent breaks for some companies. They also pledged to increase the number of hotel rooms available for quarantine for those seeking to leave Ruili.","Near-daily Covid-19 tests, sleeping in classrooms: Life in Covid-zero China",RICE

Niranjan Reddy (Agriculture) and Gangula Kamalakar (Civil Supplies) have appealed to the farming community in Telangana not to cultivate paddy, particularly the common variety, in the Yasangi (rabi) season as the Centre has informed the State Government in writing that it was not going to procure boiled rice henceforth.  Assuring the farmers that they would not have any problem in disposing the paddy produced in the kharif (Vanakalam) season as the State Government was ready to procure both the common and fine varieties of paddy at the minimum support price of 1,940 and 1,960 per quintal, respectively, with the fair average quality specifications.  They stated that the government had plans to open 6,570 paddy procurement centres based on the progress of harvesting in districts. Of them, 2,142 purchase centres had already been opened so far and a quantity 2.36 lakh quintals was purchased from 3,565 farmers.  Stating that flow of paddy was slow to the purchase centre, irrespective of the allegations being made by the opposition parties that farmers were resorting to distress sale due to non-opening of purchase centres, the Ministers cited the example of Suryapet and Nalgonda districts where 86 purchase centres were opened so far but not even a kg of grain was brought to them by the farmers.  The Ministers said a section of farmers were selling fine (Grade-A) varieties of paddy directly to millers either due to their understanding with the millers or because of getting better than the support price. It was such farmers who had placed copies of their pattadar passboks in queue for getting tokens issued by millers, they pointed out.  Mr. Niranjan Reddy appealed to the farming community again not to cultivate paddy this rabi season unless they have tie-up the seed companies or millers since the FCI had made it clear already that it would not procure boiled rice from the rabi season. As the weather conditions in Telangana would not allow production of quality rice in rabi, the grain grown in the season had to be converted into boiled rice to keep the broken rice percentage low, he explained.  He also suggested them to advance paddy, if taken up, by a month to lessen the impact on its quality. He told farmers not to raise paddy in rabi with the hope that government would purchase it and instead go for alternative crops such as blackgram as the government was ready to procure it at MSP of 6,300 per quintal and crops such as groundnut and safflower too command good price in the open market.  Stating that farmers did not cultivate cotton as expected by the government in kharif, he said paddy was taken up in 62.08 lakh acres and cotton in less 46.5 lakh acres out of 1.41 crore acres cultivated. However, farmers were getting at least 3,000 more per quintal compared to the MSP of 6,025 and it would have demand even if grown in 1 crore acres, Mr. Reddy said.","‘2,142 paddy purchase centres opened’",RICE

Chandrasekhar Rao has ruled out reduction of Value Added Tax (VAT) on petrol and diesel to offset spiralling fuel prices as the TRS government had not increased even a rupee on the State tax since the formation of Telangana seven years ago.  Addressing a press conference on Sunday, Mr. Rao demanded that the Centre withdraw cess on petrol and fuel, which will automatically bring down their prices. He blamed the Centre for not increasing tax on fuel and instead imposing cess, so that it can be absolved of the responsibility of sharing revenue from tax with State governments. However, he was not in favour of reversing the step at this stage as he wanted all duties on fuel to be brought down.  Mr. Rao said the Centre had spread falsehood that the hike in fuel prices was on account of increase in crude oil. But, the fact was that the crude oil cost US $ 105.52 a barrel in 2014, and now, it was US $ 83. The price had even crashed to US $ 30 at times. On refusal of Food Corporation of India (FCI) to lift paddy stocks from Telangana, he threatened that his entire Cabinet, including himself, would stage a dharna in New Delhi if the FCI stuck to its guns. If the FCI could procure entire quantity of foodgrains from Punjab, why not Telangana?.  The State government will wait for a response from the Centre for a week and then step up its agitation. He was, however, convinced that the Centre will not yield to pressure. Nevertheless, the farmers could still wait for a positive response because the Rabi sowings were possible till December-end.  Mr. Rao accused the Centre of going back on its promise to lift paddy from the State in the Rabi last year and giving no commitment at all for the season this year. An understanding was reached for offtake of 50 lakh tonnes of boiled rice last year but the FCI procured only 24 lakh tonnes.  This being the scenario, he said the Centre set up further obstacles even in kharif this year by rubbishing the claims of the State that its acreage was 62 lakh acres. The Centre said satellite mapping of area did not show that much of coverage. On this ground, the Centre had not sent any communication on how much it was prepared to procure kharif yield.",Telangana not to reduce VAT on petrol and diesel,RICE

With the weatherman anticipating cyclonic weather in the next few days, the intensity of hardship would accentuate and the government should therefore distribute Rs 5,000 as flood relief to each family so that their sufferings could be eased to some extent, the former CM said.  He also said that while welcoming the announcement of the Chief Minister that each family covered under the public distribution system would be provided free rice and sugar as Diwali gift, the Lt Governor should clarify whether she had the nod of the Centre to supply rice instead of cash equivalent to the families.  ""When the Congress under my leadership was in power there was circular from the Centre to the territorial government that only cash under DBT system should be paid to the ration card holders and that rice should not be distributed,"" he said.  This stand of the Centre was in keeping with the stand taken by the then Lt Governor Kiran Bedi that only cash should be remitted to bank account of the beneficiaries instead of supply of rice, he said.  Kiran Bedi took the stand of cash payment just to defeat the decision of the then elected government to supply rice through ration shops and to bring bad name to the then Congress government, he alleged.  ""The present Lt Governor should however clarify whether she had the nod of the Centre to supply rice instead of remitting cash which was insisted by the Centre in the past,"" he said, adding that the Lt Governor has no power to deviate from the stand of the Centre taken in the past in Puducherry.  Narayanasamy said that he welcomed the reduction of VAT on petrol and diesel by Rs 7 per litre announced recently by the AINRC-BJP coalition ministry.  ""At the same time, I want to know how Chief Minister Rangasamy would bear the loss arising out of the reduction in VAT on petrol and diesel as VAT is among the few major sources of revenue to the territorial government.""

Speaking to reporters here on Monday, Congress Legislature Party (CLP) leader M.

While the Centre (FCI) had written to the State Government (Civil Supplies Corporation) earlier this year making it clear that it would not procure boiled rice in Telangana henceforth, the State government had been asking farmers not to go for paddy cultivation, particularly in Rabi (Yasangi) season as there would be no procurement of boiled rice, which is produced in the season, and that it would not procure paddy produced this Rabi.  On the other hand, the State BJP leadership had been asking farmers to cultivate paddy and that it would fight with the State government and make it purchase every grain produced in the State. Instead of making plans to purchase paddy produced in the State, the State government was washing its hands off from the responsibility by blaming it completely on the Centre.  He suggested the State government take up an awareness campaign on crop (paddy) change and going for other suitable alternative crops for couple of seasons before asking them to stop cultivating the cereal crop for the reasons being cited by the Centre. Asking them to go for other crops all of a sudden would push the farming community into utter confusion.  On the issue of river water disputes, the Congress leader said Chief Minister K.

This is the second time the TRS will be taking to streets as a ruling party after coming to power in 2014. The last time the party organised such protests was in the initial days of State formation when seven mandals of Khammam, including the lower Sileru project, were merged with Andhra Pradesh.  Addressing a press conference on Monday, Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao warned that the TRS will continue to mount pressure on Centre till it concedes the demand to buy paddy in the State. As a party wedded to the well-being of people anywhere in the country, it will carry on struggle demanding abolition of cess on fuel, he said.  Reiterating his appeal to farmers to restrain from sowing paddy in the ensuing rabi till December-end, which is the flexibility period for taking up sowings, he said the government will not impose any restrictions on those who wanted to grow paddy seed if they had tie ups with seed companies, those who had buyback arrangement with rice millers and those who wanted rice for self consumption.  The farmers could take up sowings as was their wont if the Centre agreed to lift stocks but he was not confident.  Mr. Rao was livid with BJP State president Bandi Sanjay Kumar for calling him anti-national because he raised the issue of China making inroads into Arunachal Pradesh, and asked if the same can be applied to Meghalaya Governor Satyapal Malik and Mr. Varun Gandhi, both of whom were BJP leaders but supported the agitation of farmers against farm laws enacted by the Centre.  He blamed the BJP for shying away from the demand to buy paddy by denying Telangana governments claims that the cultivated area was 62 lakh acres. It was the inefficiency of the Centre not to buy three crore tonnes of paddy produced annually in the State. On the other hand, the BJP indulged in political harakiri by stoking communal passions and tensions across international borders, he said.  Mr. Rao appealed to farmers to go for cotton which is fetching them  8,400 a quintal and other commercial crops like blackgram, greengram, sesamum and mustard, instead of paddy, in view of the Centres adamant stand.  He expected labour charges on cotton cultivation to come down in coming years as cotton picking machines that could do the job on a single occasion will flood the market.",TRS to stage dharnas against Centre’s policies on November 12,RICE

Chandrasekhar Rao of making anti-national statements supporting China on the border fracas, thereby insulting and demoralising the Indian Army.  ""Mr. Rao should be within his limits, resign forthwith and apologise for making such statements for uttering lies and falsehoods on Centre on the issue of paddy procurement, farm laws and taxes on fuel,"" he said at a press conference on Monday.  The BJP president demanded the Chief Minister to clarify whether it was the Centre or the State which has been procuring paddy in the last seven years. This was in response to the Chief Minister's tirade against the Centre on Sunday's press meet.  Clarification sought  ""Mr. Rao claimed the Centre had no role in paddy procurement and that Telangana had spent 1.5 lakh crore. Did he not announce that every single grain will be purchased by his government? Therefore, we need clarification on this aspect,"" he said.  Mr. Sanjay Kumar claimed that the Food Corporation of India (FCI) had communicated to Telangana about its willingness to purchase paddy till January 2022 on August 31 itself.  ""Centre purchases raw rice even from Punjab by giving the assured minimum support price. This boiled rice issue is a big scam of the TRS government in cahoots with a few rice millers for recycling ration rice,"" he charged.  The BJP had doubts about the extent of paddy cultivation and called for a drone survey to ascertain facts. ""Mr. Rao is known for shifting stance and confusing farmers on raising fine rice varieties, maize, cotton, chillies and so on,"" the BJP leader claimed.  The Centre's proposed farm laws have no mention of removing procurement centres and agriculture market committees as was claimed by Mr. Rao.  ""What is he going to protest in Delhi when the Supreme Court has stayed the farm laws? He threatened to do the same few months ago but returned empty handed,"" he ridiculed.  The Telangana government raised VAT by 4% for petrol and 5% diesel for 2015 so it has to reduce like 22 other States and cannot lie about not increasing the tax.  ""Centre gets 27 and gives 12 to Telangana, whereas the latter gets 28 from VAT. Why cannot Mr. Rao reduce the same? Why did he not support the inclusion of fuel prices in GST?,"" asked Mr. Sanjay Kumar.  The BJP leader charged Mr. Rao of ""mortgaging"" the interests of Telangana by keeping ""silent"" on projects across rivers Krishna and Godavari in Andhra Pradesh; dragging the issue of withdrawing pending case in apex court preventing the formation of a tribunal and accepting 299 TMC when rightful share was 570 TMC.  Having ushered in the abusive language template against the Opposition leaders, Mr. Rao cannot complain now.

In T Nagar, the Chennai corporation had spent over Rs 110 crore to construct stormwater drains during 2019-2021 and under area-based development of the Smart Cities Mission, nearly Rs 80 crore was spent to restore the Mambalam canal to help divert rainwater in the area to mitigate floods.  However, these expensive projects turned out to be in vain as the Corporation staff are now forced to remove the bunds which were constructed as part of the Mambalam restoration project to enable draining of water. Officials said it was a temporary measure and the bunds will be reconstructed after the rains.  For the second consecutive day, the GN Chetty Road , an arterial road, which is also covered under the area-based development of the Smart Cities Mission, was waterlogged.

The boats will be available at least until November 13. To avoid residents going out unnecessarily during the rains and prevent untoward incidents, the commissioner asked residents to stock up on essentials like bread, vegetables and rice needed for the family.  It was also brought to my notice that 1913 helpline was busy yesterday when residents tried to contact us.

When the State government is trying to give clarity by explaining the farmers about the refusal of Food Corporation of India (FCI) to procure boiled rice from this Rabi season, the BJP leaders have been hiding facts about the boiled rice procurement and asking farmers to go for paddy stating that they would make the State government procure it, ministers S. Niranjan Reddy and G. Kamalakar have said.  Addressing a press conference here on Tuesday, they sought to know whether they were not aware of the fact that the FCI had taken in writing from the State government (Civil Supplies Corporation), on the directions from the Ministry of Food and Public Distribution, in the middle of the procurement of rice produced in the last Rabi season that State would not be given boiled rice quota henceforth.  They also reminded the State BJP leaders of what a few other Union ministers spoke about the boiled rice stocks in the country  that the country already has over 280 lakh tonnes of boiled rice stocks and procuring more such rice would be useless as boiled rice could be used only for two years after milling.  Further, they pointed out that State BJP president Bandi Sanjay spoke of only procurement of rice produced this Kharif season without mentioning the fact that the FCI had not specified the quantity it would lift, so far. He also did not speak about the procurement of rice produced in the Rabi season.  The ministers suggested that the BJP leaders could pursue with the Centre for bringing down the out-turn, processed paddy (rice), fixed at 68 kg for every 100 kg of paddy to 50-55 kg in the Rabi season so that the State could supply raw rice in Rabi too. The out-turn would come down due to the weather conditions in the State, due to which the broken rice percentage would be much higher than 40%.

Mr. Rao had levelled serious charges against the Centre and had even threatened to incite violence, but we are not going to be scared by his empty rhetoric. This is an attempt to divert attention from the resounding defeat giving by people of Huzurabad despite spending huge sums of money and frustration over being unable to make his son the Chief Minister, he said, at a press conference in New Delhi.  Trying to put things in perspective, the Minister explained that paddy procurement for Telangana was highest in the country after Punjab at 94 lakh metric tonnes purchased at 26,440 crore last year when the corresponding figures were 43 lakh MTs in 2014 at 3,404 crore.  The Centre pays for gunny bags, transport, workers, milling charges and so on while not a single rupee is paid by TS. Farmers grow raw rice and not boiled rice.

However, the TS Government has no clue on extent of paddy being grown as varied figures are being given - 40 lakh MTs at the civil supplies ministers meeting in August and in October the figure has risen to 108 lakh MTs whereas the CMs letter says 90 lakh MTs.

Speaking to reporters after visiting rain-affected and inundated areas in the city for the third consecutive day, Mr. Stalin said: In the name of implementing the Smart City project, several crores of rupees was received from the Union Government. We do not know what they did with it [the funds for implementing the scheme]. A Commission of Inquiry will be constituted after this [rain] is over.

To a query on how the situation was in the city, the Chief Minister said: Work is under way in rain-affected and inundated areas by the [DMK] party and the government.

The Department of Food and Public Distribution (DFPD) of the Central government had a month ago communicated to the State government that it will not purchase paddy from Telangana any more owing to surplus parboiled rice in the country and limited consumption. The department advised the State government to encourage farmers for crop diversification by incentivising sowing of other crops.  To repeated requests by Telangana to buy the paddy produced in rabi of 2020-21, the Centre had given one time approval for delivery of 20 lakh tonnes of parboiled rice to Food Corporation of India in addition to already approved 24.75 lakh tonnes in the season.  Paddy production in rabi ran the risk of yielding broken rice because of high temperatures, especially after February 20. This problem was eliminated in kharif due to low temperatures. So, the millers boiled the rice of rabi to recover expected turnover for despatches to States like Tamil Nadu and Kerala, where its consumption was high.  As the other States had also become self-sufficient in parboiled rice, the FCI said it did not have clientele for the stocks. Moreover, it had reserves in its godowns to last for four years. Unlike in Andhra Pradesh, which had export potential of rabi rice due to easy access to shipping yards, export of rice from Telangana was not viable at minimum support price owing to transportation costs involved.  In these circumstances, the State entered into an MoU with DFPD to deliver 80% boiled rice and 20% raw rice produced in rabi of 2020-21 subject to the condition that there will not be procurement of paddy of rabi from Telangana in future. As a result, about 50 lakh tonnes was to be delivered to FCI but the Central agency so far committed to lift 44.75 lakh tonnes. The balance 5.25 lakh tonnes was still pending, sources said.  As the stand-off continued, the Centre had not even indicated how much it would buy from the State in the just-concluded kharif when the production was estimated at 1.70 crore tonnes over 62 lakh acres. The government has made plans to open 6,400 procurement centres.",Focus shifts to Centre’s rigid stand in lifting stocks,RICE

Both the central and state governments are partly right in their respective stands. But there are solutions and the two governments should look into it keeping in view the welfare of the farmers,"" said Devender Reddy.In addition to allowing the millers to export the rice, the state government can look into the possibility of allowing the millers to directly procure the paddy from the farmers.This will result in saving transportation costs incurred on bringing the paddy from the agriculture field to procurement centres, and transporting it again to rice mills. Also, the farmers have to pay hamali charges and commission at procurement centres. Millers can offer better prices to farmers for their paddy If the government can guarantee that it will procure entire rice (milled out of paddy procured from farmers) from the millers. Both the farmers and the government will benefit, said N Satyanarayana, federations Suryapet district secretary.The rice millers made it clear that there are certain categories of lands in which paddy is more suitable for cultivation.

2021-11-10,https://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2021/nov/10/cabinet-approves-ethanol-price-hike-by-up-to-rs-147-litre-for-blending-in-petrol-2381923.html,"By PTI  NEW DELHI: The government on Wednesday hiked the price of ethanol extracted from sugarcane for blending in petrol by up to Rs 1.47 per litre for 2021-22 marketing year starting December, as part of its target to achieve 20 per cent doping by 2025.  A higher blending of ethanol in petrol will help cut India its oil import bill and also benefit sugar cane farmers as well as sugar mills.  The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA), headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, gave its approval for fixing a higher price for ethanol derived from different sugarcane-based raw materials under the Ethanol Blended Petrol (EBP) Programme for Ethanol Supply Year (ESY) 2021-22 starting next month.  Giving details, Information and Broadcasting Minister Anurag Thakur said the price of ethanol extracted from sugarcane juice has been increased to Rs 63.45 per litre from the current Rs 62.65 per litre for the supply year beginning December 2021.  The rate for ethanol from C-heavy molasses is increased to Rs 46.66 per litre from Rs 45.69 per litre currently and that of ethanol from B-heavy to Rs 59.08 per litre from Rs 57.61 per litre.  Oil marketing companies Indian Oil Corp (IOC), Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL), which procure ethanol from sugar mills and distilleries, will also bear the GST and transportation costs on the ethanol procured for doping in petrol.  Thakur said the ethanol blending with petrol has touched 8 per cent in the 2020-21 marketing year (December-November) and is expected to reach 10 per cent next year.  India has plans to increase the blending to 20 per cent by 2025.  The CCEA approval will not only facilitate the continued policy of the government in providing price stability and remunerative prices for ethanol suppliers but will also help in reducing the pending arrears of cane farmers and dependency on crude oil imports, an official release said.  It will also help in savings in foreign exchange and bring benefits to the environment.  The government has also decided that oil PSEs (public sector enterprises) should be given the freedom to decide the pricing for 2G (Second Generation) ethanol, as this would help in setting up advanced biofuel refineries in the country.  Already, oil marketing companies (OMCs) are deciding the grain-based ethanol prices.  ""The decision to allow Oil PSEs to decide the price of 2G ethanol would facilitate setting up advanced biofuel refineries in the country.  ""All distilleries will be able to take benefit of the scheme, and a large number of them are expected to supply ethanol for the EBP Programme,"" the release said.  The government has been implementing Ethanol Blended Petrol (EBP) Programme, wherein OMCs sell petrol blended with ethanol up to 10 per cent.  The programme has been extended to the whole of India except the Union Territories of Andaman Nicobar and Lakshadweep islands with effect from April 1, 2019, to promote the use of alternative and environment-friendly fuels.  The Centre had notified administered price of ethanol since 2014.  For the first time during 2018, the differential price of ethanol-based on raw material utilised for ethanol production was announced by the government.  Ethanol procurement by state-owned OMCs has increased from 38 crore litre in Ethanol Supply Year (ESY) 2013-14 to contracted over 350 crore litre in ongoing ESY 2020-21.  The government said a consistent surplus of sugar production is depressing sugar prices.  Consequently, sugarcane farmers' dues have increased due to the lower capability of the sugar industry to pay the farmers.  To limit sugar production and increase domestic production of ethanol, the government has taken multiple steps, including allowing diversion of B heavy molasses, sugarcane juice, sugar and sugar syrup for ethanol production.  ""Now, as the Fair and Remunerative Price (FRP) of sugarcane and ex-mill price of sugar have undergone changes, there is a need to revise the ex-mill price of ethanol derived from different sugarcane-based raw materials,"" the release said while explaining the rationale for the CCEA's decision.  Further, to kick-start the second generation (2G) ethanol programme (which can be produced from agricultural and forestry residues, like, rice and wheat straw/corn cobs and Stover/bagasse, woody biomass), a few projects are being set up by oil PSEs taking financial assistance from 'Pradhan Mantri JI-VAN Yojana'.  These projects are likely to start commissioning from ensuing ESY 2021-22, thus a decision on 2G ethanol pricing is desired, the release said.",Cabinet approves ethanol price hike by up to Rs 1.47/litre for blending in petrol,RICE
2021-11-11,https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/science/japanese-korean-turkish-language-group-farmers-ancient-china-7618372/,"A study combining linguistic, genetic and archaeological evidence has traced the origins of the family of languages including modern Japanese, Korean, Turkish and Mongolian and the people who speak them to millet farmers who inhabited a region in northeastern China about 9,000 years ago.  The findings detailed on Wednesday document a shared genetic ancestry for the hundreds of millions of people who speak what the researchers call Transeurasian languages across an area stretching more than 8,000 km.  The findings illustrate how humankinds embrace of agriculture following the Ice Age powered the dispersal of some of the worlds major language families. Millet was an important early crop as hunter-gatherers transitioned to an agricultural lifestyle.  Also read | Why Sanskrit has strong links to European languages and what it learnt in India  There are 98 Transeurasian languages. Among these are Korean and Japanese as well as: various Turkic languages including Turkish in parts of Europe, Anatolia, Central Asia and Siberia; various Mongolic languages including Mongolian in Central and Northeast Asia; and various Tungusic languages in Manchuria and Siberia.  A new study in the journal @Nature traces the common ancestry and primary dispersals of Transeurasian languages back to the first farmers moving across Northeast Asia in the Early Neolithic https://t.co/pni7M0MkP6 pic.twitter.com/Kk1P0ww6uD  MPI-SHH Jena (@MPI_SHH) November 10, 2021  This language familys beginnings were traced to Neolithic millet farmers in the Liao River valley, an area encompassing parts of the Chinese provinces of Liaoning and Jilin and the region of Inner Mongolia. As these farmers moved across northeastern Asia, the descendant languages spread north and west into Siberia and the steppes and east into the Korean peninsula and over the sea to the Japanese archipelago over thousands of years. The research underscored the complex beginnings for modern populations and cultures.  Accepting that the roots of ones language, culture or people lie beyond the present national boundaries is a kind of surrender of identity, which some people are not yet prepared to make, said comparative linguist Martine Robbeets, leader of the Archaeolinguistic Research Group at the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History in Germany and lead author of the study published in the journal Nature.  Read more | New book tells story of India through its languages  Powerful nations such as Japan, Korea and China are often pictured as representing one language, one culture and one genetic profile. But a truth that makes people with nationalist agendas uncomfortable is that all languages, cultures and humans, including those in Asia, are mixed, Robbeets added.  The researchers devised a dataset of vocabulary concepts for the 98 languages, identified a core of inherited words related to agriculture and fashioned a language family tree. Archaeologist and study co-author Mark Hudson of the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History said the researchers examined data from 255 archaeological sites in China, Japan, the Korean peninsula and the Russia Far East, assessing similarities in artifacts including pottery, stone tools and plant and animal remains. They also factored in the dates of 269 ancient crop remains from various sites.  The researchers determined that farmers in northeastern China eventually supplemented millet with rice and wheat, an agricultural package that was transmitted when these populations spread to the Korean peninsula by about 1300 BC and from there to Japan after about 1000 BC.  The researchers performed genomic analyses on ancient remains of 23 people and examined existing data on others who lived in North and East Asia as long as 9,500 years ago. For example, a womans remains found in Yokchido in South Korea had 95% ancestry from Japans ancient Jomon people, indicating her recent ancestors had migrated over the sea.  It is surprising to see that ancient Koreans reflect Jomon ancestry, which so far had only been detected in Japan, Robbeets said. The origins of modern Chinese languages arose independently, though in a similar fashion with millet also involved. While the progenitors of the Transeurasian languages grew broomcorn millet in the Liao River valley, the originators of the Sino-Tibetan language family farmed foxtail millet at roughly the same time in Chinas Yellow River region, paving the way for a separate language dispersal, Robbeets said.",Japanese-Korean-Turkish language group traced to farmers in ancient China,RICE

2021-11-11,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/explained-is-pmgkay-still-needed/article37431517.ece,"Right to Food activists insist that vulnerable communities still need the support from Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana, Centres foodgrain programme.  The story so far: A scheme to provide free food grain to ration card holders as part of COVID-19 relief comes to an end this month. While the Food Ministry says the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana is no longer needed as the economy is reviving, Right to Food activists insist that vulnerable communities still need the support, arguing that the government has sufficient grain stocks to extend the scheme.  Also read: Inefficient PDS deprived poor since Independence: PM Modi  What is PMGKAY?  The Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana scheme was part of the Centres initial COVID-19 relief package, back in March 2020 when the first lockdown was announced. It provides for 5 kg of rice or wheat per person per month to be distributed free of cost to the 80 crore beneficiaries of the National Food Security Act. This is over and above the 5 kg already provided to ration card holders at a subsidised rate, thus ensuring a doubling of foodgrain availability to poor people at a time when the pandemic and lockdown was decimating livelihoods.  The scheme was initially meant to run from April to June 2020, but was then extended for another five months from July to November. In these first two phases, 320 lakh tonnes of grain were allotted and about 95% distributed to beneficiaries. Initially, one kg of pulses was also provided under the scheme, which was later restricted to chana dal only, and then discontinued in later phases. After the onset of the second wave of the pandemic, PMGKAY was rolled out for two months again, in May-June 2021, and was then further extended for another five months, from July to November. Another 278 lakh tonnes of grain were allotted for these two phases, and distribution is still ongoing.  Also read: Duty cuts, stock limits helped curtail edible oil prices: Govt.  Were all poor people covered under the scheme?  The scheme only provided grain for those families who held ration cards. During the first lockdown, the plight of migrant workers who held cards registered in their home villages but were stranded without food or employment in the cities where they worked, came to the limelight. A number of other poor families did not possess ration cards at all for a variety of reasons, including the state quotas on the number of ration cards. In May and June 2020, the Centre allocated 8 lakh tonnes of foodgrain to be distributed by States under the Atma Nirbhar Bharat scheme for stranded migrants and others without ration cards, although only 40% had been distributed even by August. The scheme was not revived during the second lockdown.  The 80 crore cap on NFSA beneficiaries and state ration card quotas are based on 2011 census data. Given the projected increase in population since then, economists have estimated that 10 crore eligible people are being excluded from the NFSAs safety net. In its June 2021 judgement in a suo moto case on the plight of migrant workers, the Supreme Court directed that the Centre and State should continue providing foodgrains to migrants whether or not they had ration cards.  What are the arguments for and against extension of PMGKAY?  Last week, Food Secretary Sudhanshu Pandey told journalists that there were no plans to extend the scheme beyond November 30. As the economy is also reviving and the OMSS [or open market sale scheme] is also exceptionally good, there is no proposal from the department for extension, he said. He has previously noted that States are free to buy rice and wheat under OMSS, and distribute it to migrants and other vulnerable communities.  The Right to Food Campaign wrote to Food Minister Piyush Goyal on Monday, pointing to the SC judgement and noting that the pandemic still exists, unemployment remains at record levels and there is widespread hunger among vulnerable communities. They argued that the government should not only extend PMGKAY for another six months, but also universalise the public distribution system itself, so that anyone in need would receive food support regardless of whether they possessed a ration card or not. They also suggested that pulses and cooking oils be added to the monthly entitlements, given the recent rise in prices of these commodities.  What is the countrys food stock situation?  In the last few years, food grains have been produced at record levels. Government procurement from farmers at minimum support prices has also been on the rise, especially in the aftermath of the farm protests against three agricultural reform laws, as the Centre has been keen to prove that the laws would not affect procurement. In 2020-21, almost 890 lakh tonnes of paddy was procured in comparison to 764 lakh tonnes the previous year. Wheat procurement for 2021-22 was more than 433 lakh tonnes, also overtaking the previous record.  This means that food stocks with the Food Corporation of India are at an all time high. In June and July 2021, stocks of rice and wheat stood above 900 lakh tonnes. By October, stocks stood at 724 lakh tonnes, almost 100 lakh tonnes higher than in the previous year. That is well above the buffer requirement, with stocking norms for the central pool for October standing at only 307 lakh tonnes, including a strategic reserve of 50 lakh tonnes.  The Right to Food Campaign claimed that the amount of grain in FCI godowns would be sufficient to universalise PDS and extend PMGKAY for another six months as well.",Explained | Is PMGKAY still needed?,RICE

Addressing a press conference here on Thursday, Rythu Bandhu Samithi (RBS) Chairman Palla Rajeshwar Reddy, Civil Supplies Corporation (CSC) Chairman Mareddy Srinivas Reddy and others  alleged that the Centre was discriminating against the State in the matter of paddy/rice procurement stating that when it was lifting over 2 crore tonnes of rice every year from Punjab, only half of it was being taken from Telangana for two years. Production of paddy in Telangana was over 3 crore tonnes during 2020-21 agriculture year, they noted.  On the procurement of paddy produced in the Kharif, Mr. Rajeshwar Reddy said about 5,11,334 tonnes worth over 1,000 crore was already purchased with minimum support price (MSP) at 3,550 out of 6,663 paddy procurement centre opened so far. Terming the BJPs protest on Kharif procurement as a political drama, the TRS leaders suggested them to get the Centres nod on procurement of rice produced in the Rabi season.  They also suggested that the BJP leaders get the FCI letter on not procuring boiled rice produced in Rabi withdrawn. On BJP leaders doubts over paddy extent in the Kharif season, Mr. Reddy reminded them of the fact that Union Ministry of Agriculture would keep a tab on cultivation and production of all crops in every State by collecting information on weekly and monthly basis and said the extent was about 62 lakh acres this year.  Asked why the State could not produce more raw rice, Mr. Reddy said producing it in the Rabi season was difficult in Telangana due to the extreme temperate conditions.

On top of this, he faults the Centre for saying that it would not take rabi paddy in future on the grounds that it yields parboiled rice, which has no demand. But Tourism Minister G Kishan Reddy, who represents Telangana in the Union Cabinet, denies that the Centre had said it would not buy all the kharif paddy and asserts that it would procure all the raw rice for which it signs an MoU every year.  For the 2021-22 kharif, the state had signed an MoU for 40 lakh tonnes in August but in October, the state had inflated the figure to 108 lakh tonnes, which he says is very unrealistic. The state now has the unenviable task of asking farmers to switch to other crops in the rabi season beginning in December, which is sure to result in a political backlash. If it does not, it would lead to a bigger problem as the farmers would be saddled with rabi rice, which would have no takers. Either way, the TRS government would be in the soup. That is probably why KCR is deftly turning the anger of farmers towards the Centre as he knows paddy is a powder keg that can go off at any time.  There is no gain from pointing fingers. It is time now for both the Centre and the state to come together and find a solution to the problem in the changed demand-supply scenario. As the Centre has advised, the state could help rice millers modernise their equipment to convert rabi paddy into raw rice or ask the farmers to go in for alternative crops in rabi or do both. In their anxiety to escape the wrath of the farmers, both the TRS and the BJP seem more interested in blaming each other, conveniently overlooking their immediate responsibility of saving the cultivators from the impending calamity.",Paddy in Telangana and a problem of plenty,RICE

Kishan Reddy strongly rebuffed the allegations made against the Centre by Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao and other Ministers on procurement of paddy from farmers stating that there was no truth in it. He said the Chief Minister and his Ministers were on a vicious campaign against Centre and creating wrong impression among farmers for reasons best know to them.  We have never said that we will not procure rice from the state. We have already entered into an agreement with the State government to procure about 40 lakh matric tonnes of rice. Again the State government said about 90 lakh matric tonnes of paddy was being grown in the State and hence there was a need to increase it. Later they said that with eye survey it seems the cultivation has increased to 108 lakh matric tonnes. In 2014-15, the Centre has procured  3,404 crore worth of rice from Telangana whereas it was increased to 26,641 crore in 2020-21. How can the Ministers allege that the Centre is against farmers in the state? questioned Mr. Kishan Reddy while speaking to reporters here on Saturday. He said there was no clarity for the State government on in the area of paddy and it had unnecessarily roping in farmers in the issue.  Farmers will grow only paddy and it was the responsibility of the State government to procure, mill and hand it over to the centre. I want to clarify that farmers will grow only paddy and are milling it as parboiled or raw rice will be with millers. The State Government should speak with millers and settle the issue. For the past three years we have been repeatedly saying that there was a large stock of boiled rice and we could procure no more. We will decide what to do with the stock piled up, said Mr. Kishan Reddy adding that the entire expenditure to procure paddy would be borne by the Centre and even 8.5 per cent interest would also be paid to State.  The Union Minister also wondered why the issue was raked up only after the results of Huzurabad by-election results and what was the issue when the Centre was ready to buy raw rice as agreed upon.",‘We are ready to buy raw rice as agreed upon’,RICE

A few schools are approaching donors to get rice and other items, while some have asked children to bring lunch from home.  The State Government opened schools after relaxing COVID-19 restrictions in a phased manner. The Education Department instructed the schools to start midday schools on October 25. With the available foodgrains, schools started to cook. However, the stock has not yet reached most of the schools.  Venkatesh Hegde, chairman of the SDMC at Megaravalli in Thirthahalli, told The Hindu that a donor contributed 50 kg of rice recently. Every day we need 17.5 kgs of rice for 170 students. If we do not get the stock in the next three-four days, we will face problems again, he said. However, this is not the problem faced by one school, but many others too.  A teacher in Shivamogga, who wished not to be named, said with no rice and dal to cook, the staff had told the students to bring lunch from home. Schools in towns and cities could ask children to bring food from home. Most of our students come from distant places. They cannot carry lunch as they leave home early to reach school. We have to provide them food, said Mr. Hegde.  The officers of the Education Department, well aware of this problem, have told the staff members to purchase the essential items by spending the amount meant for the purchase of vegetables, cooking oil, salt and other food items. The government provides  2 per child per day to procure these times. We are making use of the amount to purchase rice, which was earlier supplied by the government. The schools with high students strength may have sufficient amount to manage, but not small schools with meagre strength, said a teacher in Hassan, who wished not to be named.  The officers point out that the technical problems with the supply of food grains would be sorted out within a couple of days. The schools would also get the funds they required.  Deputy Director of Public Instructions in Shivamogga N.M. Ramesh told The Hindu, There was no shortage in supply of foodgrains. We have instructed the staff to make use of the funds available. They are all managing with the money they have.  Sources in Education Department in Raichur too said that supplies for the scheme are yet be streamlined. Schools in the district have not received dal, an essential component of the midday meal.  We have received all the major items required for midday meal preparation except for pulses without which midday meal preparation is not possible. We have, however, asked the school authorities to procure the required items from local fair price shops and return equal quantity of the items after they get their supplies, an officer said, adding it might take a week to streamline the process.

2021-11-14,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/myanmar-political-standoff-leaves-economy-in-tatters/articleshow/87694216.cms,"BANGKOK: The military takeover in Myanmar has set its economy back years, if not decades, as political unrest and violence disrupt banking, trade and livelihoods and millions slide deeper into poverty.The Southeast Asian country was already in recession when the pandemic took hold in 2020, paralyzing its lucrative tourism sector.Political upheavals after the army ousted its civilian government on February 1 have heaped further misery on its 62 million people, who are paying sharply higher prices for food and other necessities as the value of the kyat, the national currency, plummets.With no end to the political impasse in sight, the outlook for the economy is murky. UN humanitarian chief Martin Griffiths appealed last week to Myanmar's military leaders to allow unimpeded access to more than 3 million people needing life-saving aid because of growing conflict and insecurity, COVID-19 and a failing economy. Griffiths said he was increasingly concerned about reports of rising levels of food insecurity in and around the cities.Hundreds of thousands of people in the country have lost their jobs and poverty has deepened as Myanmar's inflation has skyrocketed.Imported foods and medicines cost double what they used to . . . so people buy only what they need to buy. And when traders sell an item for 1,000 kyats one day and 1,200 the next, it means that the seller is losing while selling, said Ma San San, a trader in Mawlamyine township who sells Thai goods.Myanmar's economy is forecast to shrink by 18.4 per cent in 2021, according to the Asian Development Bank, one of the deepest recent contractions anywhere.The civilian government ousted in February had been making slow but steady progress toward weaving impoverished Myanmar into the global economy after decades of quasi-isolation under past military regimes.Exports surged over the last decade, after the generals relaxed their decades-long hold on power.Eager to tap a young and low-cost workforce, foreign investors set up factories making garments and other light manufactured goods.Yangon, the former capital and largest city, was transformed as moldering buildings dating back to British colonial days were spruced up or demolished, making way for new roads, industrial zones, shopping malls and modern apartments.Private businesses popped up, creating jobs and meeting long-deprived demand for products like cellphones and new cars.But the military still controlled key government ministries and many industries, and corruption and cronyism thrived.Months into Myanmar's political crisis, the country has returned to the days of black market trading and dollar hoarding.Now most people are losing faith in the Myanmar currency and buying dollars, so prices are soaring, said Soe Tun, chairman of the Myanmar Automobile Manufacturers and Distributors Association and an official of the Myanmar Rice Association.Trade has been hindered both by the global shortage, and surging costs, of shipping containers and by China's closure of its border to exports from Myanmar to help control coronavirus outbreaks.Myanmar's total trade fell 22 per cent from a year earlier in the 10 months from October 2020 to July 2021, Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, who led the army's takeover, recently told his military-installed cabinet. He said the country logged a trade deficit of USD 368 million.The less Myanmar exports, the less it earns in foreign currency  mainly dollars  making the greenback all the more scarce and valuable versus the kyat.In January, the dollar bought 1,300-1,400 kyats. In late September, it hit a record high 3,000 kyats among money changers on downtown Yangon's Shwebontha Street, informally known as Broker Street.That has driven up prices in kyats for necessities such as cooking oil, cosmetics, food, electronics, fuel and other increasingly costly supplies that have to be imported using dollars.The authorities suspended vehicle imports from October 1 to conserve foreign exchange. To stanch the kyat's plunge, the Central Bank of Myanmar has intervened in the market 36 times since February.But such operations have had scant impact, traders say, since most dollars sold by the central bank go to pro-military businesses.Some say the dollars issued by the central bank do not meet domestic demand, and we accept that is true, Maj. Gen. Zaw Min Tun, the military administration's chief spokesperson, told reporters.As a government, we have to take responsibility for what happened in our time rather than blaming the past, he said.I want to say that our government is working hard to find the best solution. Some people have set up money changing groups to swap kyats for dollars online despite the risks, and the central bank recently issued a notice banning such non-official dealings.Online is easier these days. You can easily find people who want to buy or sell. But you need to build trust between sellers and buyers. There are also scammers online, said Ko Thurein, who often posts dollar sales in the Myanmar Money Changer Group.Fuel scarcity has become a major problem. Partly thanks to rising global oil prices, the cost of gasoline, which is imported since Myanmar has scant refining capacity, has more than doubled to a record of about 1,500 kyats per liter from about 700 kyats in January.Zaw Min Tun, the military's spokesperson, said Myanmar was working on long-term hydropower and wind power projects while trying to conserve energy and cut imports since it could not cover the demand for fuel.Top leader Min Aung Hlaing has exhorted the public to help reduce energy use.It's difficult to buy dollars, and oil companies are no longer selling us on credit, said an official from Max Energy, a major conglomerate operating dozens of filling stations.You cannot buy everything you want and we have a hard time building trust with them. So we are just trying not to lose too much at the moment.He blamed the political crisis.""Even in our country, people do not trust each other, and there is no doubt that foreigners do not trust us. It is also because the banking system is in turmoil, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity given the sensitivity of the topic.Gasoline prices have skyrocketed, so we have to raise fares. But passengers don't want to pay. I know everyone is impoverished right now, so people are using buses instead of taxis,"" said Moe Myint Tun, a taxi driver in Yangon. When we have high fuel prices, we lose a lot of passengers.Like many other modern amenities, bank services have been periodically disrupted by protests and strikes, forcing people wanting to access their cash to use mobile banking apps and pay 5 per cent-7 per cent fees at so-called Pay Money shops providing financial services.Because of inflation, the money in our hands automatically decreases in value. Once the money in the bank can't be withdrawn, we have to pay a commission at the Pay Money shops. Finally, we have nothing left,"" said Su Yee Win Aung , a sales clerk at a telecommunications company in Yangon.It can be said that it is the most difficult time for us, she said.",Myanmar political standoff leaves economy in tatters,RICE

The Centre has called an urgent meeting of the chief secretaries of Punjab, Haryana, UP and Delhi to discuss emergency measures to be taken in the next few days, Mehta said.A bench of Chief Justice N V Ramana and justices D Y Chandrachud and Surya Kant said all it wanted was to ensure cleaner air for the citizens. You must tell us on Monday what steps were taken and the result thereof, the court told the Centre and the states concerned.The bench said Delhi government appeared to be doing little to address the alarming air crisis in the capital. The CJI asked Delhi government, We heard you had installed some smog towers. Are those towers working? Justice Chandrachud added, Delhi government has opened the schools and is exposing little children to this severe weather. Are the schools still open?Appearing for Delhi government, senior advocate Rahul Mehra pointed out that the AQI in the city was in the good category till September 30 but deteriorated alarmingly since then to dangerous levels. Stubble burning is the main reason for this, he said, discounting the benchs apprehension that stubble burning coupled with pollution from other sources had weaved a toxic cocktail of atmosphere over NCR.Justice Surya Kant, who said that he and the CJI were farmers, objected to Delhi government blaming the farmers for the mess. Be it petitioner or Delhi government, it has become a fashion today to indulge in farmer bashing. Has Delhi government imposed any ban on factories and construction activities in the past seven days? What is Delhi Police doing? he asked.The CJI said, Without indulging in blame games or politics, the Centre and state government must work in tandem to provide relief to the citizens. We all must be able to breathe. Addressing Delhi government, the bench asked, Why dont you think of banning plying of vehicles except emergency vehicles? You find a way and talk to the central government for implementing this across NCR.The Centre responded through Mehta, The colour of the political party does not matter. It is a joint responsibility. Implementation has to be at the state level. We are coordinating and every state is cooperating. We are focussing on emergency response with the chief secretaries of the states.Detailing the multi-mode action plan to curb stubble burning, the solicitor general said Uttar Pradesh planned to use the IARI, Pusa, bio-decomposer over 10 lakh acres of rice fields, Haryana in around a lakh acres, Punjab in 7,413 acres and in Delhi, 4,000 acres. The application has been used so far in around 6.6 lakh acres in UP, including 91,500 acres in NCR districts, 1,357 acres in Delhi and 34,000 acres in Haryana, Mehta informed. Besides, Nurture Farms, a subsidiary of United Phosphorus Ltd, as CSR initiative, has sprayed the bio-decomposer in 1,71,449 acres in Punjab and 2,36,109 in Haryana.The solicitor general added that under the In-situ Crop Residue Management Scheme, 2,00,000 baling machines were available. Statutory directions for utilisation of paddy straw pellets/briquettes for co-firing in thermal power plants have been issued to all 11 thermal power plants within 300 km of Delhi, he said.The SC agreed the policy decisions were fine but the problem lay in implementation. Who will collect the stubble? What is the mechanism to put the stubble together and transport it for use as fuel in power stations and other industries? What is the economic arrangement? it asked. Whatever mechanism you create for collecting and transporting stubble, it must reach the farmers within a short window of 20 days. The policy is there. The problem is how you are implementing it. You appear to be still in the process of inviting tenders and other things.Justices Chandrachud and Kant said, So far as farmers are concerned, the problem is not enforcement, but incentivising. If they are adequately incentivised, why would farmers not switch to stubble disposal? You cannot enforce these things. They added, Landholdings in Punjab and Haryana are less than three acres and you cannot force farmers to purchase machinery. Why cant the Centre and states provide stubble management machines?","Stop farm fires, declare lockdown for a few days: SC",RICE

The state government is expected to send the report to the Centre shortly.  The Aghanashini river originates as Bakurhole at Manjuguni near Sirsi in the Western Ghats of Uttara Kannada district. The river meets the tide at Uppinpatana in Kumta taluk, 24 km upstream in the river.

2021-11-16,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/ponnani-food-trail-snacks-and-sweets/article37520565.ece,"Allahu A'alam means Allah/ God knows best. But the Ponnani region of Kerala has a snack named thus. The story goes that after preparing several snacks, someone made a new dish with leftover fillings. When asked to name it, he/she said, Allahu A'alam and the listener assumed that it was the name!  The square-shaped multi-layered snack has refined flour (maida), eggs and different fillings  scrambled or boiled eggs, mashed banana, nuts, raisins... It is a must on the festival menu and during important occasions in Muslim families in the region.  North Kerala, read Malabar, is known for its distinct cuisine, especially those prepared in Muslim households. If you think that Kozhikode and Kannur have the monopoly, people of Ponnani in the neighbouring Malappuram district will agree to differ.  Foodies and cultural activists from this scenic coastal town are promoting Ponnanis indigenous dishes in a big way. Last year, before the pandemic, Purogamana Kala Sahitya Sangham (PuKaSa), an organisation of artists, writers and cultural enthusiasts, had organised Appangal embaadum in Ponnani as part of its state meet. We showcased the culinary diversity of Ponnani by bringing together home cooks who are experts in making traditional snacks and eats, says PK Khaleemudheen, lawyer and a member of PuKaSa.  Culinary melting pot  Once a major port, Ponnani has had domestic and international trade relations and have borne the brunt of invasions and battles too. Arabs, Portuguese, Dutch and Yemenese folk have touched down on its soil at various points of history. These foreign influences reflected in our food as well, be it in preparation or the names they have. What eventually made the cuisine so diverse is the joint family system with several families staying under one roof, says Faseela Tharakath, a Malayalam lecturer, who has done research on the food of Ponnani as part of her PhD thesis.  Vijayan Kothambath, author and lawyer, recently brought out a pictorial childrens book, Appaanyathinupoya Palaharakkothiyanmar, which tells the story of two ants, Chonan and Maniyan, who are off to Ponnani angadi (market) from Valiyangadi in Kozhikode to see Appaanyam or the sale of appams. Appam is the general term we use for all items in our cuisine  snacks, cakes, pathiris, et al. Appaanyam, a shortened version of Appangalude vanibham (market of appams), used to be held in Kozhikode several decades ago. I have used it in the Ponnani context for the book. Hospitality is in the blood of our people. We love to entertain guests with good food, that too with a generous spread, says Vijayan.  The PuKaSa event was our first step towards guiding these home cooks to become entrepreneurs. But the pandemic delayed our plans. However, the good thing is that after the event a few outlets have opened in Ponnani to sell food sourced directly from these women, says Khaleemudheen. The cooks have also formed a WhatsApp group, adds Faseela.  Food just overflows during festivals and weddings. In north Kerala, Muslim families hold Puyyappla salkkaram, a custom where the brides family treats the bridegroom with a lavish spread for breakfast, lunch and dinner. This goes for a week or even more! It is quite deplorable that the women toil hard in the kitchen while the men do nothing. However, most of the snacks that we have today might have been invented by our mothers or grandmothers because of this custom, Khaleemudheen says.  They often say, Ponnani menu has ada (steamed rice pancakes) to aleesa (a wheat-based porridge with chicken/mutton and spices, inspired by Arab cuisine. One is spoilt for choice when it comes to snacks made in this region. The fried snacks have a shelf life of few weeks to months and they are purchased in bulk by those who travel abroad. Kozhi ada, a crispy snack with meat filling, can be kept for three months, says Asmabi.  And then there is mutta pathiri, fondly called Ponnanis national food. The batter with raw rice, urad dal and raw pappadams (pappadams are soaked in water to make a fine paste) is fried in oil. We have it with morning tea or as breakfast, says Asmabi V, who runs a bakery in Ponnani.  Some like it sweet  For those with a sweet tooth, Ani J, a homemaker-cum-entrepreneur, mentions vazhakkapaal, a version of unnakkaya or stuffed banana fritters. A filling of scrambled egg, nuts and raisins goes into boiled and mashed bananas shaped like spindles. They are not fried. It is had with a pudding made of coconut milk, rice flour and shallots cooked in ghee, she says.  Vindi halwa is another native Ponnani sweet. Rice, fried in oil, jaggery syrup, coconut and cardamom, are the ingredients. We get special jaggery from Lakshadweep to prepare it at our bakery, Asmabi says.  Poovappam is flower-shaped, whereas manda is a samosa with a sweet filling of semolina, sugar and cardamom. Ambattil/Ambayathil ada, a fried snack, looks like a cone. The dough is passed through idiyappam moulds before they are shaped like cones.  Among other popular snacks are ball-shaped kimmaath eaten with sugar syrup, kuriyappam (steamed small rice balls) and paliyathappam/palaikkappam, mini spindle-shaped rice dumplings cooked in coconut milk.  Chirattamala, a must for Puyyapla salkkaram, looks like jalebi. The maida-based batter is deep-fried by passing it through one eye of a coconut shell. Other regulars for the feast include erachi pidi (rice dumplings in beef boti), muttamala and muttasurkka (made from egg yolks and egg whites respectively) and pathiris.  Both sweets as well as savouries come in interesting shapes and with drool-worthy fillings. For example, kidutha, a sweet snack with coconut filling, areerappams that look like mini donuts, biscuitappam, shaped like the number eight, and chukkappam, resembling cute little buttons. Chukkappam has rice flour, eggs, shallots and black cumin seeds and is salty. It is best had with beef fry or prawns roast, says Asmabi. Karakkappam is a variation of chukkappam.  As for the pathiris, one can go on about the varieties  velichenna pathiri, nei pathiri, nice pathiri, kai pathiri, kattipathiri, irachi pathiri, poricha pathiri, chatti pathiri are only a few. Just as numerous are the kinds of cakes mutta cake, rava cake, maida cake, thari cake, kuzhi cake, pazham cake, as Vijayan mentions in his book.  Ponnani made history last year when it started first-of-its-kind common kitchen for multiple families. We are holding a workshop on the topic, Adukkala Rashtreeyam Charcha Cheyyappedumbol, on November 17 [at ICSR Academy, Eswaramangalam, Ponnani] where we will also look at what can be done to promote entrepreneurship among the home-cooks. Some of them are so passionate about cooking that they dont charge anything from the customers, concludes Khaleemudheen.","On a food trail through Kerala’s Ponnani that has a culinary tradition marked by umpteen snacks, sweets and delicacies",RICE
2021-11-16,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/kilinochchi-farmers-dread-first-harvest-after-sri-lankas-fertilizer-ban/article37526908.ece,"Govt.s organic only policy since May has drawn flak from farmers and experts  For Muthu Sivamohan, a farmer leader in Sri Lankas northern Kilinochchi district, the uncertainty looming over his paddy yield, after the government banned chemical fertilizers, is only comparable to two other periods of crisis.  The first was when Prime Minister Sirimavo [Bandaranaike] introduced import substitution in the 1970s, said the 63-year-old farmer. He vividly recalled the severe food shortage during the period, with long queues outside shops as people waited for hours to buy a loaf of bread. There was hunger all around. We survived on king coconut and manioc mostly.  Also read | Amid fertilizer row, China blacklists Sri Lankan bank  All the same, offering some respite then was her governments boost to local production, especially benefiting small farmers growing vegetables and cash crops. Senior farmer representative Subramaniam Kanapathipillai recalled northern farmers garlanding Ms. Bandaranaike with chillies, in appreciation of her governments support to them. That is why farmers here [north] of a certain generation have a soft spot for the [Bandaranaikes] Sri Lanka Freedom Party, he said.  Difficult times  The civil war began a decade later and lasted about 30 years as the armed forces fought the LTTE. The Tamil-majority north and east were stifled with violence, an economic blockade, and no access to national markets. Those were extremely difficult times, but we did not go hungry. We grew our own food and had enough to eat, Mr. Sivamohan said, contrasting the years of strife with the current situation.  The governments overnight policy shift to organic agriculture in May this year, farmers like him fear, might slash their yield so drastically that a food scarcity may not be far.  Similar fears surfaced in August, when President Gotabaya Rajapaksa declared an Emergency to ensure distribution of essential food items, seeking to prevent market iregularities and hoarding.  Meanwhile, the governments ban on chemical fertilizer has heightened farmers apprehensions, especially after sowing season began some weeks ago. Now, they are dreading the harvest early next year.  Ketheeswaran, 37, has sowed paddy in 20 acres. Ideally, I should have sprayed the [chemical] fertilizer now, about 30-35 days after sowing. I havent been able to do that. The crop will certainly suffer, he said anxiously. I doubt if I will get even half the yield I got last time. The drop production that the districts farmers anticipate could impact rice consumption in the entire Northern Province, as Kilinochchi is the largest producer of paddy among the five northern districts, growing about 1.5 lakh tonnes in 2020.  The problem, though, is not peculiar to Kilinochchi. Farmers across the country growing paddy  Sri Lankas main food crop  and tea are raising alarm. Engaging over a quarter of the countrys labour force, Sri Lankas agriculture sector contributes about 8% of the GDP. Significantly, farmers in the countrys Sinhala-majority south who voted for the Rajapaksas are protesting day after day, burning effigies of the Agriculture Minister, and raising angry slogans against what is arguably the most unpopular policy decision of the Rajapaksa administration in its two years in power.  President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, however, is determined to keep his poll promise. In his election manifesto that is now his governments policy framework, Mr. Rajapaksa promised a revolution in the use of fertilizer, with a decisive shift to organic farming and focus on home gardening. The initiative, in addition to saving dollars spent on importing chemical fertilizers, was pitched as a response to the prevalence of a rare kidney ailment.  However, his government did not consult farmers or experts. Challenging the governments claim that chemical fertilizers caused farmers kidney ailments, scientists have dubbed the current crisis the most turbulent period in Sri Lankas agricultural history. The governments outright switch to organic fertilizer is a catastrophe in the making, senior soil scientists Prof. W.A.U. Vitharana and Dr. W.S. Dandeniya warned in a column for the local Sunday Times, arguing that the damage to the country caused by such short-sighted decisions will be irreversible.  Amid mounting resistance, President Rajapaksa appointed a panel on green agriculture last month. Except, it did not include a single representative from farmers organisations. There are so many farmers societies across the country, and they could not consult even one of us while taking such a consequential policy decision? asked Subramanian Yatheeswaran, secretary of a farmers federation in Kilinochchi, baffled by the exclusion. Moreover, the governments supply of organic fertilizer since the ban has been erratic and unreliable, paddy farmers noted.  Gradual transition  The transition from chemical to organic fertilizers, farmers and experts emphasised, ought to be gradual. We are not opposed to organic farming, but it [the shift] cannot be overnight like this, said Mr. Sivamohan, recalling that it was during Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksas time as President that the government heavily subsidised agrochemicals. It was in that decade that farmers became more reliant on chemical fertilizers.  Even the harvest early next year  one of Sri Lankas two main harvest seasons tied to the monsoon  may not accurately reflect the impact of the policy shift, said R. Ravindrakumar from a federation of paddy farmers. Some farmers used chemical fertilizer leftover from last year. You see, we are used to war-time scarcity and intuitively stock up a little. We heard of some others purchasing it in the black market, he said. It is the next harvest that will deliver a deadly blow to us.  With no solution apparent, farmers are worried  about their next yield, as well as its impact on the countrys food security. If our people go hungry next year, the government should not hold farmers responsible. If citizens starve, it will be a shame for the country, Mr. Sivamohan said.",Kilinochchi farmers dread first harvest after Sri Lanka’s fertilizer ban,RICE

So, when she heard about Diwali Detox diets , she decided to give it a try.My nieces first birthday and Diwali came close together so we all ended up feasting and celebrating, says Gayathri, a mother of two. I realised I had put on weight in just a week and wanted to shed the extra pounds. I am a week into it and I already feel better.Though days have gone by since people celebrated the festival of lights, reminders of the festivities show  in the tighter fit of clothes, the slightly more prosperous belly, and, for some, in the higher blood sugar levels. Thats why, after the feasting, people are turning to online fitness gurus and nutritionists for help. Many services have also come up, offering Diwali Detox diets that range from threeday packages to ones that last a fortnight.Nutritionist Maria Priyanka, who runs the Instagram handle @healthychef.chennai, came out with a two-week Diwali Detox shred programme this year.I run a cloud kitchen and offer keto and low carb diets though I strongly believe that people also need to make lifestyle changes to remain fit, says Maria, who came up with a diet plan for Gayathri.This year, since there were several requests, I started the Diwali detox programme, where I offer both veg and non-veg packages and a diet plan.Maria recommends clients start with a morning detox  crushed fresh turmeric with crushed ginger and lemon mixed with warm water.Breakfast, to be had before 10am could be multigrain brown bread with peanut butter along with a medium-sized bowl of cut fruit or two egg whites with one yolk, with sauteed mushroom, spinach, and zucchini, or a bowl of oatmeal made with water and topped with dry fruits, berries or cut fruit.For lunch we provide a portion of whole grain, millet, quinoa, or black rice with protein and fibre in the form of good serving of grilled, baked, or sauted veggies. Dinner is a meal of protein and fibre, such as beet hummus with paneer, or grilled meat and veggies.If you are healthy, your kidneys, liver and gastrointestinal tract will naturally detox the body if you go back to clean eating. If unhealthy, natural detox wont happen, says Meenakshi Bajaj, dietician, Tamil Nadu Government Multi Super Specialty Hospital.Her advice to clients is control, alt, delete -- control mindless eating, alter your food choices (begin eating more local, traditional, seasonal and homemade food) and delete all processed food.You also need to follow the three Fs  fluids to keep you hydrated, fibre to cleanse the system of toxins and extra fat, and consume foods that have high ORAC (oxygen radical absorbing capacity) value, such as turmeric, ginger, or walnuts, says Meenakshi. You also need to consume lean protein and prebiotics such as oats, onion, garlic, and apples that will synthesise probiotic-gut healthy bacteria.Three-day cleanses wont really help detox your system, says Meenakshi. You can gradually start with a so-called detox diet and make it a lifestyle.Have a homemade green smoothie for one meal, or whole fruit and buttermilk or milk. For lunch, have dal rice (khichdi) with gourds or curd rice and veg kootu , and for dinner, a light meal of idli, idiyappam, dal or fruit salad and veg soup, she says.Hydrate well with water and unsweetened beverages. Replace visible sugar with natural sugars from fruits. Gradually move to a balanced diet which becomes a sustainable solution to a healthy body.","After a season of feasting, it’s time for a detox",RICE

Chandrasekhar Rao of trying to divert the attention of the farmers and not taking any interest in ensuring paddy coming to the procurement centres is purchased.  Farmers are in distress as they are worried about their crop lying in the open, but the procurement is yet to begin. The Chief Minister instead of trying to find a solution has only succeeded in creating fear and confusion among them with his irresponsible statements, he told the media at different places following his interactions with farmers in Nalgonda district on Monday.  Mr. Sanjay Kumar began a two-day tour to meet farmers and visit the paddy procurement centres to understand their difficulties and assure them of support.  Convoy attacked  Even as farmers complained of either non-procurement or partisan approach of the officials in purchasing paddy, the TRS supporters and partymen tried to obstruct the programme with black flags and slogan-shouting against the BJP and Centre.  At one stage at Arjalabhavi, the BJP leaders convoy was greeted with eggs and stones as the police personnel had a tough time to separate both the groups.  The BJP workers blocked the Narketpally highway in protest accusing the police of playing a spectators role and raised slogans against the Chief Minister and the TRS government.  Meanwhile, the BJP president focussed on attacking the government and specifically, the Chief Minister.  Mr. Rao, despite holding a responsible position, caused the present crises with his shifting stance of advising farmers to grow paddy once, fine rice on the other. Cotton was propagated once and farmers were also warned against cultivating maize.  Does he have any idea on how to deal with the situation like this? Did he not announce on the floor of the Assembly that the government will buy every single grain? Can he clarify on this, he demanded.  The government had assured to purchase paddy straight from the fields with payments in 48 hours but the farmers would be happy if the produce coming to the procurement centres is purchased immediately, he added.",Violence mars Bandi Sanjay’s interaction with farmers,RICE

Chandrasekhar Rao has accused the Centre of adopting double standards on the issue of rice procurement without giving clarity even on lifting the paddy/rice produced in the Khairf (Vanakalam) this year.  He stated that he would write to the Prime Minister as also Union Minister of Food and Public Distribution on Wednesday on behalf of the Telangana Rashtra Samithi Legislature Party, seeking Centres clarity on procuring rice produced this Kharif season, on the rice to be produced in Rabi (Yasangi) season as the Centre lifts entire paddy/rice produced in Punjab.  The Legislature Party meeting of TRS held here on Tuesday also decided to hold a maha-dharna at the Dharna Chowk near Indira Park on November 18, seeking Centres clarity and State BJPd stand on the issue. All MLAs, MLCs, MPs, Zilla Parishad Chairpersons, Cooperative Bank chairpersons, nominated post holders (chairpersons of various corporations) would participate in the protest from 11 am to 2 pm and submit a memorandum to the Governor.  In case there was no response from the Centre in two days after the protest, the State Government would give clarity to the farming community whether to raise paddy in Rabi or not as farmers would start raising nurseries immediately after anuradha karthi later this month. He stated that farmers would suffer loss by raising paddy if the Centre refused to procure rice produced in Rabi.  While educating the farmers to go for alternative crops, the TRS would also wage a struggle against the Centre and State BJP at every appropriate forum, questioning Centres discrimination against States in the matter of rice procurement. He pointed out that the Centre had forced the State Government to give an undertaking on not supplying boiled rice in Rabi from this year as a pre-condition to lift the rice produced in the last Rabi season.  Visit questioned  Questioning the rationale behind State BJP president Bandi Sanjays visit to paddy procurement centres, the Chief Minister sought to know for what purpose he had undertaken the visit when the procurement of paddy produced in Kharif had already commenced.  He stated that harvesting was done only in 10% of the extent so far out of 62 lakh acres in which paddy was raised in Kharif.  About 4,500 procurement centres were already opened out of over 6,600 proposed in spite of lack of clarity on the quantity of rice to be lifted by the Centre (FCI). They had agreed to lift rice produced in Kharif but had not specified the quantity so far, in spite of repeated requests, the Chief Minister said.  Criticising the Bharatiya Janata Party for allegedly instigating attacks by its activists and goons on farmers at the procurements centres, Mr. Chandrasekhar Rao said it would backfire seriously on the party in the days to come.  On the presence of TRS workers there, he sought know whether TRS workers wont have lands, cant produce paddy and bring it to procurement centres for its disposal when the party had about 60 lakh membership.  They will definitely question Bharatiya Janata Party leaders, asking whether they stand by the call given to farmers to go for paddy cultivation itself in Rabi and whether they will convince the Centre to lift rice (boiled) produced in Rabi, Mr. Chandrasekhar Rao said.",Centre adopting double standards: KCR,RICE

But the smoke from stubble burning, which travels to Delhi from the neighbouring states of Punjab and Haryana is an important contributor to pollution levels. In the period from October 20 this year, the contribution of stubble burning to Delhis PM2.5 concentration has ranged between 2% on October 24 to as much as 48% on November 7, according to the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (SAFAR). Why have governments failed to stop farm fires and their polluting effects? An HT analysis of Punjabs agricultural statistics show that this will not happen without a holistic re-evaluation of agricultural practices in the state. Heres why.  Why, Punjab?  The simplest answer to this question is that Punjab is responsible for the largest number of farm fires in the northern region. Data from the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (Suomi-NPP) shows that number of farm-fires in Punjab until November 14 this year is over six times the number of fires in the states of Haryana and Uttar Pradesh.  There is no doubt that stubble burning in Punjab and Haryana produces smoke. How much does that smoke contribute to pollution in Delhi? The contribution can vary depending on the amount of stubble burnt and the proportion of that smoke that enters Delhi and stays close to the ground. The latter two are dependent on temperature and the speed and direction of wind. Because the weather conditions helpful for accumulation of pollutants close to the ground in Delhi  low-speed wind blowing from north-west to east and low temperatures  coincide with the stubble burning period, PM2.5 concentration in Delhi has a high correlation with fires in Punjab and Haryana in October and November.  Why stubble burning?  It is a race against time for farmers. There is a very small window between the harvesting of the kharif (monsoon) seasons paddy crop and sowing of the rabi (winter) crop in this region. This is partly a result of government regulations that mandate delayed sowing of the kharif crop (because there is a shortage of water, itself brought about by the fascination with paddy in this part of the country). Then there is the question of money. Setting fire to fields to prepare them for farming is among the oldest methods in agriculture. This is how early humans learnt agriculture, except what they would set fire to what were forest lands. The reason this technique has resurfaced in regions such as Punjab is, ironical as it may sound, not a lack of technique  our ancestors did not have the farm equipment we have today  but the economics of farming. Paddy, when harvested by human labour does not leave behind much in terms of stubble. This is not the case when it comes to harvesting with machines such as combine harvesters.  There are two factors that encourage the use of mechanised harvesting in Punjab compared to other states: larger farm sizes, which facilitates theuse of such machines and higher cost of labour compared to other states. Data from the latest Land and Livestock Holdings of Households and Situation Assessment of Agricultural Households (SAS) by the National Sample Survey Office (NSSO) puts this in perspective.  The average size of land under paddy cultivation is 1.97 hectares in Punjab and 1.88 hectares in Haryana, among the highest under paddy cultivation in major states. This is in complete contrast with the situation outside Punjab. The average size of land under paddy cultivation in the third-ranked state (Madhya Pradesh) is almost half of that in Punjab (1.01 hectares). In most big states, the average size of land under paddy cultivation is under one hectare.  This, when read with the fact that average agricultural wages in Punjab are higher than the national average, and even more so than the agricultural labour exporting states such as Bihar, Jharkhand and parts of Uttar Pradesh, explains why it makes sense for farmers in Punjab to first use mechanised harvesting and then resort to stubble-burning.  The dominance of big farmers in paddy cultivation in Punjab (and its neighbouring Haryana) is a reflection of the fact that paddy is more a commercial than subsistence crop in these states. This is borne out by the fact that paddys share of themarketed surplus is significantly higher in Punjab than in eastern states such as Bihar and West Bengal.  Agricultural policy has played a role too. 71% of the total rice procurement in the 2021-22 Kharif Marketing Season (figures up to November 11, 2021) in India was in the state of Punjab. Any sudden withdrawal of this support will inflict a huge economic shock to the farmers in the state, as receipts from paddy accounted for more than half of cultivation receipts in Punjab in the latest SAS. As is obvious this will also have a huge political backlash. To hope that the states farmers will stop cultivating paddy (and burning its stubble) without a holistic overhaul of agricultural policy is an exercise in collective delusion.","Punjab cannot handle its paddy, but it can’t change without help",RICE

The mission falls within the ambit of the National Action Plan on Climate Change, a programme that aims to make Indian farms more resilient to changing climate and is being monitored at the highest levels, the official said.  Globally, agriculture is responsible for a third of all greenhouse gas emissions, three-quarters of them coming from livestock farming alone.  For all its ambitious climate commitments  from Copenhagen to Paris and now, Glasgows COP26 - India needs a comprehensive policy on cutting farming emissions, the third-largest source of carbon after energy and manufacturing sectors, some experts say.  That will require a balance between competing choices such as farmers livelihoods as well as food security and drawing down on carbon-heavy agricultural practices.  The central role played by agriculture and food systems tend to be overlooked The food system receives much less attention, even though it generates 26-37 per cent of GHG [greenhouse gas] emissions, said Compassion in World Farming charity in its report to the COP26, a UNs climate change conference.  The official cited above said the country had made steady progress on sustainable agriculture parameters such as on-farm water management and soil health cards.  Soil testing of over 100 million samples have promoted less-carbon-intensive agriculture by rebalancing the use of crop nutrients, such as nitrogenous fertilisers, the official said.  Some studies show soil-health cards need to be redesigned. In a study by the Cereal Systems Initiative for South Asia, many farmers were found to be not familiar with all nutrients and micronutrients listed on the cards, the International Food Policy Research Institute said in a report.  The largest emissions from within agriculture come from livestock farming and continuously irrigated and deep-water paddy cultivation in the states of West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Odisha and Bihar, according to a study by economist Ashok Gulati.  Methane released from agricultural activities and food systems is the main source of greenhouse gases. Limiting Earths temperature rise to 1.5C would require drastic cuts to meat and dairy output. Deforestation and release of carbon dioxide have to do with growing large amounts of crops to feed livestock for meat and dairy.  Indias farm sector accounts for 14% of the countrys total greenhouse gas emissions, preceded by electricity (44%) and manufacturing industries and construction sectors combined (18%).  India has the worlds largest cattle population at 535.78 million livestock, according to the 20th Livestock Census, 2019. Livestock makes up 78% of the 24 million tonnes of Indias total methane emissions, according to official data.  Methane emission due to enteric fermentation by the livestock (54.6%), and anaerobic conditions during rice cultivation (17.5%) and nitrous oxide emissions from application of nitrogenous fertilizers in agricultural soils (19.0%), together account for 91 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions (in India), wrote economist Ashok Gulati in an October 2021 bulletin of the New Delhi think-tank ICRIER.  According to the environment ministrys data, greenhouse gas emissions from rice cultivation during 2016 accounted for 71.322 million tonnes CO2 equivalent, which analysts say might have gone up to 72.329 million tonnes CO2 equivalent during 2018-19.  Cutting farming emissions can be done with steps such as direct seeding of rice, a method that decreases water use, in the top 5% of the rice districts, Gulati said.  Gulatis paper states that India could bring down farming emissions of 178 million tonnes of carbon equivalent with other measures, such as improved water management in 20 million hectares of irrigated rice fields, better livestock feed and manure management for 25% cattle population, stopping rice-crop residue burning with the target year of 2030 and reduction in farm energy and replacement with green energy.","India aims for better practices to cut agri emissions, experts call for clear goals",RICE

According to the statements in charge sheet against Srikrishna, his associates Suneesh Hegde, Prasidh Shetty and Robin Khandelwal have claimed that the former used to make them pay for his lavish lifestyle, promising them Bitcoins. When he didnt keep his promise, they even tried to abduct him.  In other instances, too Srikrishna had made his associates pay for his luxurious life promising them Bitcoins.  He claimed to have hacked and stolen several bitcoins and promised to give them to me. So, I looked after all expenses of SriKi. Till now, I have spent over 2 crore on him, read Suneeshs statement.  Details of this conflict within the gang were shared by Khandelwal who was helping Srikrishna convert his Bitcoins to cash. Khandelwal, a B.Com graduate from Kolkata had started his career running his fathers rice mill. Later he learnt about Bitcoins and started operating a cryptocurrency exchange.  According to the chargesheet, Robin first came in touch with Sriki in 2017, when the hacker contacted him to convert Bitcoins. Initially, Srikrishna introduced himself under a Dariel Herman and asked Khandelwal to sell 900 bitcoins.  After this first transaction, Srikrishna remained in constant touch with Khandelwal and in 2018, the two met for the first time in Bengaluru. During this meeting Srikrishna revealed his real identity. He told Khandelwal that he was a hacker and he could provide many Bitcoins for conversion.  Srikrishna would transfer Bitcoins he acquired after hacking to Robin who would then convert the Bitcoins into cash, keep his commission and then transfer the money to various accounts. According to the charge sheet, Khandelwal said that Sriki sent him 130 Bitcoins from 2017 till December 20, 2020. Robin sold them and, after taking his commission, transferred Rs. 3.48 crores to multiple accounts Sriki had given him.  It was during this trip to Bengaluru that Khandelwal was introduced to the other accused in the case, namely Suneesh Hedge, Prasidh Shetty and Sujay Raj by Srikrishna.  These three men were Srikrishnas associates in the hacking into poker websites. Explaining their modus operandi, the chargesheet reads that Poker sites were hacked by Srikrishna when his friends played the poker games online. After hacking into the website, Srikrishna would give them details of the opponents cards and they would win the game and the cash prize that came with it.  For these hacking sessions, Srikrishna insisted on staying in five-star hotels in Goa, which later became the root of conflict within the gang. Srikrishna made Suneesh foot the bill for these expensive stays and according to the charge sheet they stayed in Goa for 10 days.  When Srikrishna began ignoring their calls the trio hatched a plot against the hacker. Robin in his statement claimed that he put a fake bandage on his leg to scare Srikrishna that he was beaten up by the gang, forcing him to flee the hotel he was staying in.  Later they asked Khandelwal to bring Srikrishna to a safe house in Bidadi, in the outskirts of Bengaluru, on the pretext that he was taking him to a safe house. Here the gang locked up and threatened the hacker to pay their share of bitcoins.  Khandelwal in his statement claimed that while locked up in the apartment, Srikrishna convinced him that they should escape from the balcony and they should keep the Bitcoins for themselves. Convinced by his plan, Srikrishna escaped from the apartment with the help of Khandelwal, reads his statement.

They are major contributors in the economy, but it seems that the administration, instead of assessing the damage on the ground, decided the compensation within four walls of their offices, Mehbooba said.  The administration, it may be stated here, has declared heavy spell of rain and snow on October 23 and 24 as state-specific natural disaster under state disaster response fund (SDRF) norms for the purpose of providing relief to the affected farmers.  Jammu, Udhampur, Kishtwar, Reasi, Samba and Kathua in Jammu division and Anantnag, Kulgam and Shopian in south Kashmir were the districts covered under the declaration.  I am told that the government assured peanuts to the farmers of RS Pura, Bishnah, Samba and other plains of Jammu as compensation, where farmers have suffered extensive damage to their standing crops, said the former CM.  Sudden change in weather has damaged the crop of farmers and brought them to the verge of starvation but government, I am told, has fixed 600 compensation per kanal, which is a humiliation to the farmers, she added.  She said the BJP government has adopted a hostile attitude towards the farmers across the country and it seems Jammu and Kashmir is no different.

Though the government resumed midday meals from November 2, it just supplied rice and wheat while putting the onus of purchasing tur dal, edible oil and vegetables on the respective school heads.  As per the June 23, 2020 directive of the government, each student of Classes 1 to 5 is supposed to get 20 gram of tur dal and 50 gm of vegetables in midday meals, whereas each student of Classes 5 to 10 is supposed to get 30 gm of tur dal and 75 gm of vegetables. The government has fixed a paltry Rs 4.97 for each student of Classes 1 to 5, and just Rs 7.45 for each student of Classes 5 to 10.  On the other hand, the prices of edible oil is hovering around Rs 150 a litre while tur dal is selling at Rs 100 per kg in the market. Similar is the situation with vegetables across the state, say wholesale merchants. This seems to have put schools heads and midday meal scheme workers in a tight spot, said the Koppal district scheme workers union president Laxmi Sonar.  However, Mysuru region has managed to overcome this as most schools have been given full independence to purchase food grains. As per the orders, we have instructed the school authorities to purchase from the funds meant for other food grains, and the price of rice has not been affected much. There is nearly 86-89 per cent successful implementation of the scheme in the district, said midday meal executive officer C Lingarajaiah.  This is also the situation at 146 schools where food is provided by the Akshay Patra Foundation of ISKCON, he said. The commodity price rise has not had an immediate effect on the midday meal scheme, but will have an impact in the near future, opined Johnson K A, principal of St Michaels School in Madikeri. The commodities for the scheme have already been supplied by the government and there is no problem as of now. But it may become challenging to manage the quality of food in the near future. The repercussions of the price rise are likely to affect schools with less student strength as it will be tough for them to buy commodities with the sanctioned minimum funds, he explained.  The hike in prices of vegetables and groceries will not impact students of the midday meal scheme in the Dharwad district. The meals here are being distributed by the Adamya Chetana and Akshay Patra. As NGOs are distributing the meals, there are no difficulties, Deputy Director of Public Instructions Mohankumar Hanchate said. Usha M, executive officer, Akshara Dasoha, Dakshina Kannad, told TNIE that pulses and cooking oil were being supplied by State Government and schools purchase only sambar powder, salt and vegetables.  The price rise might have affected the midday meal scheme and schools are sending proposals to increase the government funds. We have written to the government to revise the rates due to the high costs. This year, since there were no midday meals due to closure of schools, the rates have not been revised. The rates will be hopefully revised the next academic year. The schools with more student strength do not face any issues. Only those schools with less strength are facing problems, she said.  Koppal Deputy Director of Public Instruction Doddabasappa Neeralakeri told TNIE on Tuesday that edible oil and tur dal will be supplied by next week.  An official of the midday meal scheme in Shivamogga said schools have been temporarily asked to purchase oil, pulses and vegetables locally. But the prices vary from town to town and village to village. While the government allows the purchase of refined sunflower oil at up to Rs 140 per litre, headmasters purchase it at a higher price in the local market.  Tur dal price also varies from Rs 100 to Rs 120 per kg. The schools purchase it at a higher price without compromising on quantity. We credit the money to the bank accounts of cooks or headmasters, said G Lohith, Assistant Director of the midday meal scheme. Kalaburagi district mid-day meals scheme officer Ramalingappa said attendance of students, which was 50-60 per cent till November 13, has increased to 75 per cent from November 16. As such, the district has not faced problems in providing midday meals so far.  The delay in supply of rations is because of delay in tenders, and not short supply, said officials from the Education Department. Tur dal is yet to be supplied in schools in Benglauru Rural district. It will be supplied in two days, said the Bengaluru Rural DDPI, blaming the delay in the tender process. He said schools were so far supplying ration kits to children and midday meals started only recently. Meanwhile, an indent for additional students admitted to schools will be placed soon, he added.  The Bengaluru Urban DDPI pointed out that midday meals are supplied to schools by ISKCON. In Hassan, the school managements have to compromise on quality by using vegetables available at lower cost in the market. The headmaster of a government higher primary school said the amount released to buy vegetables is not sufficient as the prices have increased drastically. We have to search for low-cost vegetables and have no option but to compromise on quality, he added.  The State Government will soon direct the Karnataka Food and Civil Supplies Corporation to provide pulses, oil and salt and the Food Corporation of India will supply rice as per the requirements of the districts. Schools with a strength of less than 100 children are facing problems in purchasing vegetables, spices and chili powder, sources in the Public Instructions Separtment said.

2021-11-17,https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/chandigarh/to-push-diversification-price-deficiency-payment-scheme-needed-for-all-crops-7626623/,"To push diversification, price deficiency payment scheme needed for all crops  With its economy largely dependent on agriculture, Punjab faces daunting challenges in the sector from farm debt, stubble burning to urgent need for diversification. As Assembly elections draw near, states new agriculture minister, Randeep Singh Nabha, has no option but to meet the challenges head on. ANJU AGNIHOTRI CHABA spoke to him about his plans to redress the problems plaguing agriculture in Punjab.  How do you rate your governments performance on the agricultural front?  The Punjab government has been performing well on the agriculture front. CM Charanjit Singh Channi stood by farmers in time of distress. Be it a protest against the three farm laws or farmers suicides.  Ex-gratia of Rs 5 lakh, a government job to the kin of the deceased farmers, who died during protests, has been provided by our government and till date, over 150 such jobs have been given. The state government with its limited resources has provided a big relief by waiving off the debt Rs 4,610 crore of 5.63 lakh small and marginal farmers.  The state has achieved record production for paddy of 208.82 LMT during 2020-21 and 182.57 LMT wheat during 2018-19. State received the Krishi Karman award for highest paddy production during 2017-18. In our governments tenure, a subsidy to purchase 76,626 crop residue management machines has been given to manage stubble burning. Now, the state is proactively pursuing the central government for supply of DAP, so that wheat sowing does not get affected.  When there is record production of paddy and wheat, how do you foresee Punjabs ground water situation?  Punjab is a leading agrarian state of India with more than 85 per cent area under cultivation. The agricultural development in the state has reached a plateau. Out of total water demand for agriculture  about 60 Billion Cubic Metres (BCM), the irrigation demand of paddy is 70 per cent and that of wheat is about 20 per cent. Availability of water (surface & ground) is about 36.18 BCM (annual replenishable groundwater: 21.58 BCM + surface water: 14.6 BCM) and as such, there is a crippling deficit of 24 BCM. About 10 BCM of the deficit is being met through rainfall and the balance, 14 BCM comes from over-exploitation of groundwater. As per the Dynamic Groundwater Assessment report (2017-18), 109 blocks are over-exploited, 2 are critical, 5 are semi-critical and 22 safe. The average groundwater level fall in central Punjab is about 0.50 m/year, whereas in the rest of Punjab the rate of fall is about 0.40 m/year. Groundwater has become a critical resource in Punjab as aquifers are reaching unsustainable levels of exploitation. If current trends continue, it will have serious implications for the sustainability of agriculture, long-term food security, livelihoods, and economic growth.  The Department of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare (DoA&FW), Punjab, is well aware about the deficit and has initiated various measures for judicious and efficient use of irrigation water.  What are the measures being taken to save water?  Several interventions are being propagated for conservation of water including alteration of crop calendar for paddy by delaying paddy transplantation close to beginning of rainy season, medium/short duration rice cultivars taking less water are promoted and now large area is under these varieties. Laser land levelling, zero tilling, etc. are being propagated to save water. Dry Seeding of Rice (DSR), in medium to fine-textured soils, have a potential to save 10 per cent irrigation by avoiding puddling and flooding and over 5.50 lakh hectares was under DSR this time. Precision irrigation projects are being implemented. This will help in elimination of overuse of irrigation water. Last but not the least, Agriculture Department has signed MoU with Center for International Projects Trust (CIPT) with an objective to promote intelligent water saving technologies for sustainable groundwater resources in Punjab. Digital soil moisture sensors among 20,000 tubewells across 28 electricity feeders spread across 10 districts in Punjab would be installed.  Why is the state not aggressively diversifying area under paddy and wheat?  My department is sensitising the farmers to opt for pulses and oilseeds. State needs to pursue a concentrated effort involving the Department of Industries, Commerce and Export promotion for a marked increase in the acreage of pulses and oilseeds in the state. In addition to their nutritional advantage, pulses and oilseeds have low carbon and water footprints which make them an integral part of the sustainable farming system.  The current MSP policy is hugely discriminatory against rainfed farmers, who grow pulses, oilseeds, fruits and vegetables, and who constitute more than 70 per cent of the 12 crore farm families in India. The biased policy is also contributing to huge import of edible oils each year.  Even as your government has provided a subsidy to purchase 76,626 crop residue management machineries, stubble burning could not be controlled. There are a dozen districts where more than 85 per cent stubble burning takes place. Dont you think that the state must focus on these first?  As per the burning incidence report from PRSC of November 5, out of total burnt area of 6,86,000 hectares, the area in high burning districts is 4,80,000 hectares. Area under moderate and low burning districts is around 1,20,000 and 86,000 hectares, respectively, which means 70 per cent burning took place in high burning districts only.  We are focusing on these but being a strong hold of farm unions, its not happening. Farmer unions have been seeking funds at Rs100 per quintal for paddy stubble management compensation, but the Centre has refused to provide it. State has to take a call and may come up with a plan. Custom Hiring Centers for stubble management machines are set up across each village and are making an all-out effort to curb this menace.  Despite loan waiver by your government, farmer suicides are a big issue. How can these be prevented?  Yes, farm suicides can be stopped. We have formulated a policy tackling this threat and to steer the state on a path for sustainable development.  Can Sir Chhotu Ram formula (on farm debt repayment) be implemented here?  Yes, the formula can be implemented in Punjab too.  In 1936, Sir Chotu Ram evolved a formula to help farmers reeling under heavy debts following which an Indebtedness Act was promulgated, it extended to the whole of the Union Territory of Delhi and Part II to such areas as the Chief Commissioner may from time to time, by notification, direct. The Act envisaged the loan taken by farmers who have paid as much interest as the principal amount borrowed to be waived completely. Also, debt conciliation boards were to be set up in each district and Centre to share the financial burden with the state.  However, political willingness and consensus needs to be evolved for its implementation in the state.  How do you rate the agri extension services in the state? Farmers are not getting the benefits of these the way they should.  Despite having an inadequate number of working field staff and delay in release of funds for effective implementation of schemes, the state agriculture department and PAU scientists have been providing latest technological knowledge pertaining to agricultural activities to farmers.  For instance, after white fly attack on cotton, which resulted in historic decline in cotton productivity, the state department of agriculture along with PAU researchers and farmers attained the highest productivity of 827 kg/ha for cotton during 2019-20.  Why Punjab does not have its agriculture policy till date?  My Department is ready with its agricultural policy that will steer the state and its farmers in coming times to a sustainable future. Formal deliberations are pending within the council of ministers to formally adopt this for the state.  Do you think there is a possible solution to end agrarian distress?  Few things need to be done for this. A Price Deficiency Payment Scheme must be rolled out, as it is easy to execute and can cover all crops and thus could help farmers opt for crops other than paddy and wheat.  There is a need for introducing insurance schemes to safeguard farmers against low prices. Although crop insurance schemes like Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) are in operation, it covers only production risk with complete neglect of price risk.  Farmers must be provided with high yield potential seeds of pulses and oilseeds along with seeds of other crops. For this, PAU Ludhiana must be strengthened in terms of research capabilities. Seed sale and distribution among the farmers needs to be strictly regulated. For this, traceability of seeds must be made mandatory.  For assuring supply of quality farm inputs, Department of Agriculture, Punjab, must be strengthened in terms of field staff and timely release of funds for effective implementation of various farmers welfare schemes.  Farmers must be sensitised to use the credit taken from the banks or from other sources in a more genuine and proper manner. The government can take care of only crop loans of farmers, not the loans taken for personal purposes.  What is your vision for the future?  My vision is to divide the whole state into zones according to the soil fertility and the respective produce. We are looking forward to Agrotech Summit in December where we are looking for business tie-ups with multi-nationals to set up plants where employment is generated and the produce of the farmer is marketed and the farmer feels secure.","‘To push diversification, price deficiency payment scheme needed for all crops’",RICE

Speaking to mediapersons here on Wednesday, spokespersons of the samiti, K. Kesava Marar and E.P.

But another rice variety, Athira, which was cultivated only 30 cm away from the paddy field, was not attacked by the blast disease, they said.  They had procured 4,700 kg of Manuvarna variety of paddy by paying 42 a kg. They had spent 1.25 crore for the cultivation, including rent of the land.  Faulty studies  The reason for the spread of the disease was faulty researches conducted at the Rice Research Stations (RRS) at Mankombu, Vyttila, and Pattambi under the Kerala Agricultural University, they alleged.  The farmers should be provided a compensation of 60,000 an acre for their loss and the amount should be collected from the scientists of the research stations, Mr. Philipkutty said.

2021-11-17,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/confirm-procurement-kcr-urges-modi/article37548726.ece,"FCI following policies that crated confusion  A day ahead of the grand dharna by ruling TRS in the ongoing tussle between State and Centre over paddy procurement, Chief Minister K. Chandasekhar Rao has written a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi urging the Centre to confirm the target of procurement of rice from the State during ensuing rabi.  Mr. Rao also urged the Centre to direct the Food Corporation of India (FCI) to complete the procurement of a balance five lakh tonnes of rice produced in rabi last year and enhance target beyond 40 lakh tonnes for procurement of rice during the ongoing kharif to 90 per cent of the production as done in Punjab.  He blamed the FCI for following policies which created confusion for the State governments and farmers. The confusion was created because the target of procurement was not fixed for entire year in one go and procurement not keeping pace even though the production was increasing year by year.  Therefore, it was becoming difficult for the States to plan an appropriate cropping pattern and explain the same to the farmers. For instance, even though the production of rice in Telangana during 2020-21 was 55.75 lakh tonnes, the procurement was only 32.66 lakh tonnes which was 59 per cent of production. This was less than the 78 per cent procured in kharif of 2019-20. Such wide variations in procurement levels did not allow the State to implement a rational cropping pattern.  To clear these confusions and fix the appropriate target for procurement, Mr. Rao recalled that he had personally met Union Minister for Food and Public Distribution Piyush Goyal on September 25 and 26 and requested that the annual target for procurement be fixed immediately. It was 50 days since the meeting took place but no policy decision was taken and communicated to the State government.  Mr. Rao also highlighted that there was drought and hunger everywhere before the formation of Telangana. Due to enormous increase in irrigation facilities now, the State was not only able to meet its foodgrains requirement but became a huge grain surplus State. The farmers of Telangana were now able to produce for the rest of the country.",KCR writes to Modi to confirm procurement,RICE

She said the state would pay Rs 10,000 per month per fair-price shop  to an estimated 21,000 dealers to employ two persons each  for this project, which would generate around 42,000 jobs.The move comes amid the Centres opposition to the Arvind Kejriwal governments near-similar attempt to bring the public distribution system to citizens doorsteps. The Centre has moved Delhi High Court and Supreme Court against the Delhi government on this, arguing the attempt ran contrary to provisions of the National Food Security Act.The Bengal governments move is different because it aims to bring the states own scheme, launched in 2016 using the existing fair-price shops network, to bring subsidised rice and wheat closer to citizens. The Calcutta High Court had earlier cleared legal challenges to the Duare Ration scheme.Dubbing this the Bengal Model, Banerjee said this was a first-of-its-kind effort in the country. Duare Ration was part of the Trinamool Congress manifesto in the 2021 assembly polls, and the state has run several pilot projects before the launch.The dealers had to do everything. They could employ no one, but this is now possible, Banerjee said. Now, in one ration shop, two assistants can be appointed at a salary of Rs 10,000 per month, and the government would pay half the salary of the assistants. In order to facilitate the dealers to provide Duare Ration, the government will provide a subsidy of Rs 1 lakh for buying vehicles to supply the goods. Extra commission would be paid to the dealers for the Duare Ration scheme, the CM added.Banerjee said that recipients would be informed through SMS about when and where they need to collect their subsidised rations. However, if someone fails to collect the ration, I would ask dealers to allow them to pick it up from wherever it is convenient for them, so that no one faces any problem, she said.The CM said ration dealership fees should be reduced to Rs 50,000, so poor people could also apply, and added that women should be given priority. She said that due to death or some irregularities, around 1,150 ration shops had been closed, but were now operational. Dealers would be given Rs 2.50 for linking each Aadhaar card with a ration card, and payments would be made within a fortnight of billing, she promised.Banerjee said that the state would re-start the Duare Sarkar scheme from December 16, so that those who had not yet enrolled for the social welfare scheme would get a chance.",Vehicles to deliver ration at your doorstep in WB,RICE

The diets that many prescribe today lack good probiotics, and thats unfortunate, Sairam shares.  His dinner is small yet rich in nutrients. It consists mostly of fresh fruits and vegetables. Healthy and tasty salads are something that I look forward to having for dinner. During the day, he reaches for some salted dry fruits to satiate those hunger pangs: I dont take them roasted. I carry salted almonds, cashews and walnuts whenever I head out.  We ask Sairam if he is tempted to succumb to cheat days, and he laughs in affirmation.

I get to choose from the very many yummy salads from UrbanKisaan, I dont really have to look beyond that, he says. His guilty pleasure is trying different kinds of fried rice!  There are always times when a big man like him is invited to a social gathering that may not always serve the kind of healthy food hed like. During times like these, I stick to having steamed foods such as rice, and non-fried foods and salads.  Foods cooked in refined oils are something Sairam stays away from. Virgin oils retain the essential fats that our body need, refined oils give us the bad fat. Carbonated water and anything thats enhanced using sugars, he avoids. Coffee is his favourite beverage and he has it every day. I drink green tea, but I like to give my tongue the freedom to good taste through coffee. He loves his filter coffee over instant ones.  Sairam is someone who believes that just a good diet cant assure good health: Exercise and good physical activity are important too. While I dont lift weights or perform strenuous exercises, good breathing exercises keep me fit.  Sairam ends his day with another session of meditation and a short prayer about not his needs, but those of others. I do something called cleansing the mind. It eases the tension I might have been carrying all day.  Sairam loves to cook and can prepare a variety of South Indian curries for his family.

He has also stated that the Centre had already committed to buying 40 lakh metric tonnes of rice from Telangana this Kharif season and that the Centre was considering the request of the state government for procuring more rice if needed.

The monsoon retreats, dries the air and the wind drops. The pollution from construction, industry, road transport, hitherto being masked through the year, becomes more visible. However, the period also coincides with a unique practice in northern India where farmers in Punjab, Haryana and eastern Uttar Pradesh, in a bid to hurriedly clear their fields of rice straw to make space for wheat, set fire to the chaff. This long-standing practice is now facing criticism because of its emerging link to Delhis noxious air quality. The stubble smoke carries over into Delhi through long-range wind transport. Finally, the third element during the season is Deepavali and the bursting of crackers. The season is also marked by more social gatherings such as weddings or related celebrations that again see a demand for crackers. While there is an official ban on crackers, except so-called green crackers that are not widely available, the additional smoke from all of these add to the bad air, spiking air quality meters into the very poor and severe categories. This provokes a public outcry and concerns from the Supreme Court of India and a harried response from the Government that pushes for restrictions on free movement and construction. Invariably, the weather improves and all is forgiven.  The recurrent tragedy of addressing the problem of air pollution in Delhi is that it invariably descends into a blame game. The Centre blames the Delhi government, because it belongs to a different political dispensation, which in turn quite conveniently blames farmers in Punjab. What is never addressed head-on is that the air pollution crisis is not a problem that can be solved overnight. The lockdown last year provided compelling evidence that taking vehicles off the road and a cessation in industrial and construction activity led to clearer skies. Source apportionment studies by various institutions have shown that the contribution of stubble burning varies significantly, from as low as 4% on some days in October-November to as much as 40%. But the running of power plants and construction are also necessary activities that cannot be shut at a moments notice. The move to ban the entry of trucks too is not any more effective than waiting for the wind to blow over, and has consequences for the economy. The way forward is to view winter air pollution as a natural disaster and target root causes. Road dust is the dominant source of particulate matter and the most significant impediment to clean air, and unfortunately the least amenable to an easy fix. The emphasis must be on concerted and consistent efforts, and not annual blame games.",End the blame game: On Delhi’s pollution crisis,RICE

Govt. needs to set aside its electoral interest to create a self-governed path for tribal development  The Tamil movie Jai Bhim portrayed the discrimination experienced by the Irula community, the second largest of the 36 tribal communities in Tamil Nadu. They are traditional healers, snake and rat catchers, but now primarily migrate to different places to work in brick kilns, rice mills, etc. Like many Adivasi groups in India, the Irulas also continue to suffer the stigma of criminality due to the Habitual Offenders Act, 1952, which replaced the colonial Criminal Tribes Act, 1871. This law is a crude colonial construct, which should be repealed at the earliest. The movie exposed the police atrocities, the insensitivity of Government officials and the struggles faced by the community.  The film generated a lot of discussion on the violence and negligence that the Irulas face, but not on the structural issues with governance and the negation of tribal communities concerns. For instance, a study by Jocelyn I. Lee and Steven A. Wolf in 2018 on the rate of the formal distribution of rights claims under the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006, commonly known as the Forest Rights Act, found that no title rights were issued in Tamil Nadu because of a ban on the issuance of titles by the High Court till early 2016. The ban was stayed only after the intervention of the Supreme Court.  Also Read CM gives away welfare aid to members of Irula, Narikurava communities  The development-induced displacement trajectory adopted by the country has often been at the expense of the Scheduled Tribes (STs), either by way of exclusion or forced inclusion in a mainstream that is completely alien to their world view through what the Xaxa Committee in 2014 had called the ashramisation of the tribal. Displacement due to the encroachment and appropriation of land inhabited by STs, which are generally rich in forest and mineral resources, has been further intensified in the post-liberalisation period due to corporate interests.  Hence, the makers of the Constitution, even while underlining the importance of sharing the values of modernity with the STs, who have a great deal of heterogeneity among themselves, had been careful enough to provide a certain degree of autonomy to them to have a say in their development pursuit. Nation states have realised that certain elements in the tribal world view, with respect to ecology, language, democracy, equality, property rights, etc., hold important lessons for human progress and sustainable development. Accordingly, the Fifth and Sixth Schedules, which are governed by Articles 244 (1) and (2) of the Constitution, provides certain rights to tribes in the northeast and across India.  Creation of Scheduled Areas  The Fifth Schedule had been also termed by the Mungekar Committee in 2009 for tribal development as a Constitution within Constitution. It allows for the creation of Scheduled Areas by the President of India. Though there are no criteria mentioned regarding the creation of Scheduled Areas, it has become the norm to use four factors, following the Dhebar Commission (1960-61), for the creation of these areas: preponderance of the tribes in the population; compact and reasonable size; underdeveloped nature of the area; and marked disparity in the economic standards of the people.  Also Read Legwork by leader brings basic amenities to an Irula hamlet  According to the 2011 Census, with a 1.1% ST population in Tamil Nadu, Community Development (CD) blocks like Kalrayan hills in Viluppuram district, Kolli Hills in Namakkal district, Yercaud in Salem district and Jawadhu Hills in Tiruvannamalai district have a ST population of 80%, 96%, 67% and 91%, respectively.  The literacy rate in the four CD blocks range between 44% and 62%, whereas the overall literacy rate in Tamil Nadu as per the Census was around 80%. The proportion of non-agricultural main workers, an important marker of urbanisation, is less than 10% in three out of the four CD blocks, whereas it is 60% in Tamil Nadu overall.  The comparative economic backwardness of the STs living in Tamil Nadu is evident from the fact that as per the National Family Health Survey (NFHS) in 2015-16, only 55%, 65% and 37% of ST households compared to 75%, 78% and 61% of all the households in Tamil Nadu had access to clean fuel, concrete houses and sanitation facilities, respectively. The primary survey conducted by the Madras Institute of Development Studies in 2014-15 also revealed that the average size of agricultural land among all landowning sample tribal households in Tamil Nadu was a mere 1.42 acres with a landlessness of 52%. The landlessness among the Irula and Paniyan communities was 89% and 68%, respectively.  Also Read A slogan no longer sectarian  These four blocks should be declared Scheduled Areas. Till now, areas with more than 50% ST population had been declared Integrated Tribal Development Project (ITDP) areas in Tamil Nadu. With the enforcement of the Fifth Schedule, not only are Panchayati Raj Institutions reserved for STs under the Panchayat (Extension to the Scheduled Areas) Act, 1996, but three kinds of autonomy are made available to the STs through the gram sabhas: developmental autonomy pertaining to land alienation, land acquisition, tribal sub-plan, social sector institutions, etc; autonomy over the resolution of disputes as per tribal laws and customs; and autonomy over the ownership and management of natural resources.  Need to be reconfigured  Additionally, compact tribal areas of reasonable size, constituting villages with no less than 50% tribal population, can be identified in CD blocks with a significant tribal population to demarcate new administrative areas, which can then be brought under the purview of the Fifth Schedule by declaring them Scheduled Areas. This would be only fulfilling a commitment made in 1976 by the Government of India and reiterated by the Mungekar Committee.  Apart from the Scheduled Areas, villages where STs are in minority but still in sizeable numbers should be brought under already existing ITDP areas, which are being governed in Tamil Nadu with the advice of the Tribes Advisory Council (TAC). The TAC is an advisory body and thee-fourth of its members must be from ST communities.  The Tamil Nadu Government needs to show political will and set aside its electoral interest to create a self-governed path for tribal development. Of course, these measures alone are not the panacea to all tribal problems. It should be complemented with clear policies and a plan for tribal development reflected in the yearly Tribal Sub-Plan (TSP). The formulation of this plan must include representatives of different tribes in Tamil Nadu. In this context, the promulgation of the Tamil Nadu State Commission for the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes Act, 2021, is a step in the right direction.  C.

The U.N. Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) has praised nutrition-sensitive farming system adopted in the region for its impact on soil health, agricultural output and environment protection.  The initiative launched in the tribal-dominated Pratapgarh, Dungarpur and Banswara districts has led to the revival of a large number of traditional farming practices. The sustainable approach adopted with a participatory learning action has improved the quality of farm produce and broadened the tribal communitys vision for indigenous food and agricultural management.  The FAO has appreciated the initiative and included it in one of its recent publications under the theme, Soil biodiversity in action. While the tribal farmers are upbeat about the outcome of their enterprise, a voluntary group from Banswara district participated virtually in a global symposium on soil biodiversity, organised by the FAOs Global Soil Partnership and the U.N. Convention on Biological Diversity, to showcase the initiatives results.  The nutrition-sensitive farming involves mixed cropping with legumes as natural fertilisers, crop rotation, agro-forestery, mulching, plantation in homestead and growing hedgerows and grassy strips around agricultural fields. The cultivators in the region have found these practices useful in their farmland, most of which is rough, uneven and sloping on the foothills.  Man Singh Ninama, a farmer in Anandpuri blocks Sundrao village, told The Hindu that the mixed cropping adopted in his 12-bigha land had increased the production and rendered a better quality of crops. After the harvesting of maize, sesame and pulses, I have sown grams and peas with the main crop of wheat in this rabi season. The density of crops with the rows of different varieties will also reduce soil erosion and soil flow in the sloping field, Mr. Ninama said.  No chemicals  Another tribal farmer, Kal Singh Damor, in Kushalgarh blocks Amli Para village, said he had stopped using chemical fertilisers in his field and was producing organic vermicompost which had improved soil health.

The food and civil supplies department has withdrawn the price hike of around 12 essential items in the face of growing protests.  At the same time, local traders pointed out that tomato was being sold at Rs 120 per kg in the retail market, and drumstick at around Rs 200 per kg. The damage caused to standing crops by heavy rain in November has been cited as a major reason for the sky-high prices. Food and Civil Supplies Minister G R Anil told reporters the state government would make the necessary market intervention.  The prices of 12 non-subsidised essential items rose when Supplyco revised the monthly rates based on the wholesale price charged during the time of purchase. The government has scrapped the revised rates that came into effect the other day, considering the misery of the people, Anil said.  The prices of items like green gram, black gram, Bengal gram, red gram, coconut oil, fenugreek, green peas, chickpea, sortex raw rice, matta rice, biryani rice and masoor dal have not been changed.

2021-12-16,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/the-price-of-food-must-figure-in-the-policy/article37963394.ece,"An agricultural policy must ensure that farming is profitable but not at the cost of a high price of food  The showdown between the farmers and the Modi government may have ended, but the essential challenge of public policy for agriculture remains. This is the high price of food. For decades now, the price of food has not figured much in agricultural policy, when, actually, it should be the central focus in the presence of poor households. Successive governments have instead showcased the minimum support price (MSP) they have offered to the farmers and the subsidy they have incurred in making a limited complement of food available to the consumer though the public distribution system (PDS). The now-repealed farm laws themselves were projected as a means of raising farm revenues via higher prices. But what was left unsaid was that a higher price of food increases poverty, especially as the rice and wheat supplied through the PDS constitute only a part of the total expenditure on food of the average Indian household.  The rising price of food in India  That a high price of food can trigger economic insecurity for the individual is widely understood but what is not immediately apparent is its economy-wide ramification. For the household, a high price of food crowds out expenditure on other items ranging from health and education to non-agricultural goods. This prevents the market for non-agricultural goods from expanding. The expansion of this market is necessary for the non-agricultural economy to grow.  This was one of the first discoveries in economics, made by the English economist David Ricardo about two centuries ago. Ricardo had prophesied that due to the scarcity of good quality land, the cost of production of corn, that is wheat, in England was set to rise, leading in turn to its rising price. The consequence of this was to be not only a certain worsening living standard for the working class but also a thwarted industrialisation, as the market for industrial goods could not grow. What he failed to predict was the tremendous increase in agricultural yield that was to come about in the country with the Industrial Revolution. The rising yield ensured that the price of food was kept in check and the demand for industrial goods was not cramped. In fact, the price of food in England was not merely kept in check, its price relative to that of other goods actually declined. This pattern of a declining trend in the relative price of food has been the experience of all economies that have grown richer.  An indication of the elevation of the price of food in an economy is the share of food in a households budget. In a global comparison we would find that this share is very large for India. Data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (2016) show that this share ranges from over 30% for India to less than 10% for the U.S. and the U.K. The figure for China is around 20%. More interestingly, we find that countries with higher per capita income have a lower share of food in consumption expenditure. This is in line with Ricardos understanding of how economies progress i.e., as food gets cheaper, growth in the non-agricultural economy is stimulated. The fact that the richest countries of the world have been able to produce food cheaper over time suggest that such a mechanism has been at work. It is something that we have paid scant regard to in India. Indeed, agricultural policy in India has remained quite unaccountable in the face of a rising relative price of food. For instance, the relative price of food has risen over 50% since 1991. The experience of food becoming more expensive over time is out of line with the global experience of development. When the success of the 1991 economic reforms is recounted, this contrasting experience in India never makes the news. Sections of the media too appear to prefer sensationalising a small rise in the administered price of cooking gas while remaining silent on the rising price of food. Arguably, the high price of food has been a factor in the disappointing lack of expansion of the manufacturing sector in India despite repeated efforts to bring it about.  Both from the point of view of food security for low-income households and the dynamism of the non-agricultural sector, agricultural policy cannot ignore the price at which food is produced. This is not to ignore the role of factors across the supply chain beyond production. We know of the wastage due to the lack of proper transportation and cold storage facilities, both of which lower the effective supply and keep prices high. But the fact of low agricultural yield in India by comparison with the rest of the world has been known for long, and little is done about it. India has had an effective MSP policy for the major crops for over 50 years; how giving it a statutory status now can change this feature is not obvious. A superior management of soil nutrients and moisture, assured water supply and knowledge inputs made available via an extension service would be crucial.  As agriculture is, unlike industrial production, an activity that is affected by fluctuation in the weather, it is risky. Given the importance of food for our survival, this justifies public intervention in agriculture. The issue is the design and scale of this intervention. In the mid-sixties, when India was facing food shortage that could not be solved through trade, a concerted effort was made to raise domestic agricultural production. The intervention succeeded in raising food production but it came with collateral damage. It introduced the strategy of ensuring farm profitability though favourable prices assured by the state. Further, it entrenched the belief that it is the farmers right to have the state purchase as much grain as the farmer wishes to sell to the state agency. This has resulted in grain stockpiles far greater than the officially announced buffer-stocking norm. Rising public stocks suggests that the intervention has succeeded in raising the price beyond what would have been generated by the market. These stocks have often rotted, resulting in deadweight loss, paid for by the public though taxes or public borrowing. Finally, with all costs of production reimbursable and all of output finding an assured outlet, supply has outstripped demand. This has led to an unimaginable pressure on the natural environment, especially water supply. There has been a prediction from credible sources that Punjab faces the prospect of desertification fairly soon.  Protect the interests of the poor  India needs an agricultural policy that ensures that farming is profitable but this cannot be at the cost of a high price of food. The food problem should no longer be seen only in terms of the availability of food from domestic sources. Too high a price of food, reflected in a high share of food in household expenditure, is another dimension of the problem. This has not received the attention that it deserves, with governments pointing to the existence of a PDS. But a PDS is a roundabout and costly way of delivering food security. Raising yields will ensure profitability without raising producer prices, which will inflate the food subsidy bill.

V.J. Mathew, Chairman of the Kerala Maritime Board, said on Thursday that the present service linking Kochi and Beypore had completed 35 voyages. Discussions to finalise the new service would be held in Kochi on December 21. The present coastal voyages carry an average of 50 containers each and the vessel, now linking the ports on the coastal route, has 100 TEU capacity.  Munshid Ali, honorary secretary of the Kerala Exporters Forum, said the coastal movement had livened up the cargo transport scene. Around 400 containers are moved via the coastal route to Beypore and Azheekkal from Kochi on a monthly basis. The exporters forum has now taken an initiative to arrange a meeting with Ports Minister Ahammad Devarkovil in Kozhikode on Saturday. The meeting will be attended by stakeholders in the sector, including vessel operators, port management representatives, industrialists, traders and those others in the export-import business, he said.  One of the encouraging development for those calling for developing the coastal movement of cargo was the recent export of 28 containers of plywood from Kannur to Malayasia from Azheekkal via Kochi. The increasing volumes on the coastal route have resulted in more enquiries and transport of consignments such as rice from Andhra Pradesh and cement is now under consideration by stakeholders.  There are two voyages a week and though each voyage takes about a day to reach Beypore, the lack of sufficient draft is a problem that forces the vessels to wait for high tide before entering the port area. Dredging of the port to achieve the required draft is one of the key issues that will be discussed at Saturday's meeting.  In a memorandum submitted to the Ports Minister earlier this year, the exporters forum had appealed to the government to take steps to increase the draft at the port. One of the problems associated with dredging in Beypore is related to deposing of the dredged material. However, a solution has been found to address the problem, Mr. Ali said.",Coastal cargo service from Jan.,RICE
2021-12-17,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/the-wtos-challenge-to-msp-is-another-frontier-to-cross/article37972234.ece,"The need is to convince farmers of other effective policy interventions that are World Trade Organization compatible  The demand of farmers to provide a legal guarantee for the minimum support price (MSP) for their produce has triggered a nationwide debate. Some believe it would be fiscally ruinous to procure all the 23 crops for which MSP is announced annually. Others contend that procuring these crops would be a logistical nightmare. There is yet another dimension of this debate that has largely gone unnoticed. Can India provide a legal guarantee for MSP without violating its international law obligations enshrined in the Agreement on Agriculture (AoA) of the World Trade Organization (WTO)?  As a trade-distorting subsidy  One of the central objectives of the AoA is to cut trade-distorting domestic support that WTO member countries provide to agriculture. In this regard, the domestic subsidies are divided into three categories: green box, blue box and amber box measures. Subsidies that fall under the green box (like income support to farmers de-coupled from production) and blue box (like direct payments under production limiting programmes subject to certain conditions) are considered non-trade distorting. Countries can provide unlimited subsidies under these two categories. However, price support provided in the form of procurement of crops at MSP is classified as a trade-distorting subsidy and falls under the amber box measures, which are subject to certain limits.  Also read | U.S. and Canada raise WTO counter notification on Indias MSP  To measure amber box support, WTO member countries are required to compute Aggregate Measurement of Support (AMS). AMS is the total of product-specific support (price support to a particular crop) and non-product-specific support (fertilizer subsidy). Under Article 6.4(b) of the AoA, developing countries such as India are allowed to provide a de minimis level of product and non-product domestic subsidy. This de minimis limit is capped at 10% of the total value of production of the product, in case of a product-specific subsidy; and at 10% of the total value of a countrys agricultural production, in case of non-product subsidy. Subsidies breaching the de minimis cap are trade-distorting. Consequently, they have to be accounted for in the AMS.  The procurement at MSP, after comparing it with the fixed external reference price (ERP)  an average price based on the base years 1986-88  has to be included in AMS. Since the fixed ERP has not been revised in the last several decades at the WTO, the difference between the MSP and fixed ERP has widened enormously due to inflation.  For instance, according to the Centre for WTO Studies, Indias ERP for rice, in 1986-88, was $262.51/tonne and the MSP was less than this. However, Indias applied administered price for rice in 2015-16 stood at $323.06/tonne, much more than the 1986-88 ERP. When this difference is accounted for in the AMS, the possibility of overshooting the de minimis limit becomes real. Procuring all the 23 crops at MSP, as against the current practice of procuring largely rice and wheat, will result in India breaching the de minimis limit making it vulnerable to a legal challenge at the WTO.  Alsio read | SKM seeks clarifications on Home Ministry proposal  Even if the Government does not procure directly but mandates private parties to acquire at a price determined by the Government, as it happens in the case of sugarcane, the de minimis limit of 10% applies. Very recently, a WTO panel in the case, India  Measures Concerning Sugar and Sugarcane, concluded that India breached the de minimis limit in the case of sugarcane by offering guaranteed prices paid by sugar mills to sugarcane farmers.  Peace clause  The AoA needs to be amended so that it provides adequate policy space to run an MSP-backed food security programme. Although a permanent solution is nowhere in sight, the countries have agreed to a peace clause. The peace clause forbids bringing legal challenges against price support-based procurement for food security purposes even if it breaches the limit on domestic support. However, the peace clause is subject to several conditions. For example, it can be availed by developing countries for the support provided to traditional staple food crops to pursue public stockholding programmes for food security (procuring food to provide free ration through the Public Distribution System).  Furthermore, the peace clause is applicable only for programmes that were existing as of the date of the decision and are consistent with other requirements. Countries are also under an obligation to notify the WTO if their subsidies exceed the permissible level. For instance, earlier this year, India reported to the WTO that it gave subsidies worth $6.31 billion for rice in 2019-20 while the value of rice production was $46.07 billion. In other words, the subsidies were 13.6% of the total value of production as against the de minimis level of 10%.  Also Read Trade multilateralism at risk  Indias procurement for rice and wheat, even if it violates the de minimis limit, will enjoy legal immunity. However, India will not be able to employ the peace clause to defend procuring those crops that are not part of the food security programme (such as cotton, groundnut, sunflower seed).  Even if the AoA is amended to exclude MSP-backed procurement for food security purposes from the AMS, procurement for other crops at prices higher than the fixed ERP would be considered trade-distorting and thus subject to the de minimis limit. Therefore, India needs to recalibrate its agricultural support programmes to make use of the flexibilities available in the AoA.  Some alternatives  Arguably, India can move away from price-based support in the form of MSP to income-based support, which will not be trade-distorting under the AoA provided the income support is not linked to production.  Also Read Getting it wrong on Indias level of agricultural support  Alternatively, one can supplement price-based support (keeping the de minimis limit in mind) with an income-based support policy. However, it will be arduous especially given the climate of high misgiving prevailing between the farmers and the political establishment.  The recent fiasco with the three repealed farm laws demonstrates that reforms in agriculture, no matter how sagacious, cannot be shoved down the throats of the farmers. The Government needs to engage with the farmers and create an affable environment to convince them of other effective policy interventions, beyond MSP, that are fiscally prudent and WTO compatible.

2021-12-18,https://indianexpress.com/article/lifestyle/health/52-diet-popular-way-of-intermittent-fasting-lose-weight-healthy-eating-7677441/,"Intermittent fasting (IF) is the latest diet trend being followed by millions of people around the world. Fitness enthusiasts, people trying to lose weight, and those with prediabetes are fond of IF. In my opinion, the craze for this diet may be due to its non-conventional nature.  Instead of asking you what you should eat, this way of eating guides you to focus on when you should eat your food. 5:2 diet is a type of IF that involves eating normally for five days a week without thinking about calories and consuming no more than 500 to 600 calories on the remaining two days. This is a more lifestyle-oriented pattern of IF that is less restrictive and easier to follow. There has been considerable research demonstrating the potential benefits of the 5:2 diet when it comes to weight loss and optimum metabolic health.  In spite of this, not everyone can follow this diet, and those who adopt this way of eating must understand that nutritious, whole-food eating is essential, even if intermittent fasting doesnt ask for it.  Weight loss, metabolic syndromes and 5:2 diet  A scientific 5:2 IF is effective in ensuring sustainable weight loss. In a 2021 randomised control trial conducted in London, 18 per cent of participants lost weight on the 5:2 diet, compared with 15 per cent in a conventional weight control regimen. In addition, when asked to rate each of the interventions, participants in the 5:2 diet group were more likely to recommend the intervention to others or be willing to continue the diet.  The 5:2 diet is as effective as conventional calorie restriction that is defined by consuming 20 per cent fewer calories than you burn every day, according to a study published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition.  The 5:2 diet could offer women greater flexibility and choice when it comes to weight loss or managing gestational diabetes, as recently reported by researchers at the University of South Australia.  The University of Illinois at Chicago study found that dieters who followed the 4:3 protocol (similar to 5:2 diet) lost an average of 5 kg without losing muscle mass, compared to a control group who didnt diet. In addition, they reduced their triglyceride level by 20 per cent, their leptin level by 40 per cent, and their CRP level, a key inflammation indicator.  What to eat on a 5:2 diet?    On days when you consume 500 to 600 calories, you should plan your diet accordingly. Make sure you choose low-calorie foods that are filling. Among the best choices are cauliflower rice, plain yogurt or curd, green leafy vegetables, low-sugar fruits, legumes, lean meat, poultry, eggs, and dairy-based protein like paneer, soy-based protein like tofu. Low starchy veggies like cucumber, mushrooms, bottle gourd, pumpkin, and green beans are great staples during the fast days. Include healthy fats such as nuts, seeds and fatty fish in your diet for steady energy flow. You can incorporate a variety of foods at once without putting much effort into cooking with soups and salads. Avoid refined carbohydrates, sugar, and sugary drinks, which will spike your blood sugar levels and leave you hungry very quickly. Being hungry could affect your mood.  You can eat when you like. Some people prefer eating several smaller meals throughout the day, while others prefer to eat one large meal.  What to drink on a 5:2 diet?    You are not required to follow any specific guidelines for drinking during the five days. You should, however, be mindful of drinking non-sugary fluids on fasting days. To not exceed 500 calories, drink plain water, cucumber or fruit-infused water, coconut water, black coffee or green tea.  Fitting this eating pattern into your lifestyle increases the likelihood of you sticking with it.  Sample meal plans for Indians on 5:2 protocol fasting days    You can break your 500 calories into three meals throughout the day.  Day 1:    Breakfast: 25 g Greek yogurt topped with 4 almonds. Calories: 68.  Lunch: Broccoli-carrot or lauki-tomato soup with 0.5 teaspoon of butter. Calories: 122  Dinner: Chicken (100 g) and rice (30 g cooked) makes this lemon and chicken stir fry rice that is super filling. Vegetarians and vegans can add beans, tofu or paneer. Calories: 310  Total = 500 calories  Day 2:    Breakfast: One boiled egg, one banana, one cup green tea. Calories  178  Lunch: 1 bowl cauliflower rice (100 g) with 150 g fish or paneer curry. Calories  210  Dinner: Vegetable soup with 1 teaspoon ghee/butter. Calories  110  Total = 498 calories  Its important to eat protein, fiber, and healthy fats throughout your fasting days to ensure optimum nutrition.  In a nutshell  If done correctly, the 5:2 eating pattern is convenient, flexible, and brings multiple health benefits. There are drawbacks to the diet, too, such as  you may eat more than 500 calories if you do not calculate properly, you may feel hungry if you consume too few calories or refined carb-based foods during the fasting days.  Its important to consult a nutrition professional to plan your meal. Although timing is the key component to determine success in this diet, what you eat is important, too. Remember, you can never outrun bad nutrition.

A tiny sip here of the cola-seeming port wine when no one was looking or a dribble there of the beer-lemonade shandy from an unattended mug were not really my initiators into the world of alcohol.  That honour I reserve for the very unique fruit-punch-meets-hot-toddy drink called khimad. This clove-cinnamon-cardamom enhanced, orange-hued alcoholic drink made from country liquor occupies prime position in almost every East Indian celebration. And while I am not an East Indian, I am surrounded by enough of them here in my home in Mumbai to make me an honorary one.  The East Indians have nothing to do with East India, geographically speaking. They are the original, Marathi-speaking Christian inhabitants of Mumbai. Many of their ancestors worked for the erstwhile East India Company, and hence the name, reinforced also to distinguish them from Goan Catholics, who were Portuguese subjects at the time.  Known for their food- and drink-heavy celebrations, I used to make it a point to get invited to every such party. If not to gorge myself silly on yummy dishes like duck moile, mutton kuddi curry or lonvas, then to relish the spicy hit of khimad. But over the years, higher studies and job stints took me away from my home city and also from the wonders of this festive drink.  It would be years later, in a land far away, that Id sip on a drink so similar to khimad that all the childhood nostalgia of stealing those forbidden sips would come rushing back.  SUNDAY RECIPE  Khimad  (Makes 20 chauvnees of 45ml each)  Ingredients  500 ml water  4 green cardamom pods (crushed)  10 cloves  2 sticks cinnamon  50 gm dried orange peel  1 tsp loose leaf black tea  4 tbsp sugar  300 ml country liquor (substitute with brandy, gin or vodka)  150 ml freshly squeezed orange juice  Method  1. Bring water to a boil in a pan, adding the spices and dried orange peel. Allow to simmer for 5-10 minutes.  2. Add in the tea, sugar and orange juice and mix well.  3. Add in the alcohol and let it heat, making sure to not let the mixture boil.  4. After straining, and while still warm, serve in the traditional East Indian chauvnee shot glasses.  As easy as it is to make  with just a handful of everyday ingredients  khimad goes down the hatch equally smoothly. Bolstered by all that spice, sugar and orange juice, the generous splash of alcohol is almost undetectable in this otherwise orange soda doppelganger, taste-wise. Almost being the operative word.  Many an accident, unknowingly or otherwise, has been known to happen when a little too much innocuous-looking khimad has been imbibed. Khimad benders at East Indian festivities, mainly during a pre-wedding water-pouring ritual called umbracha paani, are not uncommon. The offenders mainly being portly, middle-aged uncles showing us an updated version of the naagin dance!  Generally a winter drink, khimad is always served warm, out of traditional 45ml shot glasses called chauvnees. This is followed by the raising of a toast with a raucous sukhala (to your happiness in Marathi), while snacking on a plethora of traditional East Indian savouries and munchies like chitaps and rice wafers called papri.  But like most community-based foods and drinks in India, no two khimad recipes are alike. Our East Indian neighbours, the Gomes family, always add orange juice and peel to their khimad, while avoiding the astringent tea leaves. Other families do the very opposite. Eschewing the country liquor base  that can be made from a variety of things from tadgola (palm fruit) and black jamun (Malabar plum) to sugarcane stalks and good old coconut  many now prefer the more neutral and, ironically, easier-to-procure brandy, gin or vodka.  Celtic rituals  Khimad does have its origins in a similar sounding and tasting drink made far, far away. Youd be forgiven for assuming, like most people do, the place to be Portugal. For like Goa, Mumbai and its East Indian community-saturated suburbs too were once a part of the mighty Portuguese dominion. But strangely, khimad actually has a lot in common with the queimada from Spains autonomous Galician community found in the countrys north-western region. Interestingly, a place that sits just above Spains border with northern Portugal.  A boozy punch (literally meaning que mada or what mead?) made from orujo  a grape-based spirit distilled from the residue collected after clarifying wine  this Galician iteration of the drink is flavoured with coffee beans, lemon peel and cinnamon. This is then served out of a hollowed pumpkin  a portent of its real ceremonial purpose.  Originally an ancient Celtic ritual, queimada is served with a splash of brandy added right at the end of the punchs preparation. This is then set on fire, the alcohol in the brandy conjuring up a brilliant blue flame. This is an annual occurrence on June 23, St. Johns Night, also called Witchs Night in that part of the world.  The starring role that queimada plays in this rather eerie spookfest of a ritual is that of an antidote potion. One thats believed will keep away the curses and spells of witches accumulated through the year. An antidote thats especially strong when a counter-spell called the conxuro da queimada is incanted over the flaming pumpkin.  Yes, I do know how the many-worded spell is invoked. But no, I wont be revealing it here!  The Mumbai-based writer and restaurant reviewer is passionate about food, travel and luxury, not necessarily in that order.","Khimad, that spicy winter punch that heralds Christmas for Mumbai’s East Indian community",RICE

If youre familiar with stress, here comes another additive: oxidative stress (OS). Described as an imbalance between the production of reactive oxygen species (free radicals) and antioxidant defence, this exudes king-sized damage in our bodies. Many factors can bring on its impact: environmental pollution, poor diet, smoking, excessive alcohol etc. Align yourself with the how-to of OS to retune your operating system.  Kochi-based Dr Kumara Panicker Gopakumar, scientist at TheLifekart.in, delineates the delicate difference effectively. Oxidative stress is caused by a chemical reaction. Free radicals are responsible for its formation. Uncharged molecules spontaneously dimerise because they have an unpaired valency electron. The chemical reactions involving free radicals can result in the production of chemicals inside our bodies that are toxic to us, he says.  To counter the effect, our body produces antioxidants, also called free radical scavengers, like Vitamin D and squalene. But these are often overpowered, resulting in oxidative stress: that is conclusively a disturbance in the balance between the formation of reactive oxygen species (free radicals) and antioxidant defence. Certain additional factors like exposure to ozone, or to pesticides and insecticides can compound the occurrence of oxidative stress in our bodies. When there is this kind of stress, it causes a breakdown in the cell not just of the skin but also on the internal organs, putting the body into a state of stress.  The effect of oxidative stress registers in the form of dry skin, hyperpigmentation, blotchy skin, premature ageing. The skin being the first immune barrier in a body when put under stress, will immediately index early inflammation. Oxidative stress can be contacted by oral antioxidants with lycopene, curcumin, alpha-lipoic acid, ubiquinone, Vitamin C, Vitamin E, explains cosmetic dermatologist Dr Chytra V Anand, founder, Kosmoderma Clinics and Skin Q, Bengaluru. Topical applications like Vitamin C and federal lick acid serums protect the skin from stress stemming from UV radiation. Other tell-tale signs include fatigue, memory loss, brain fog, muscular or joint discomfort, and wrinkles.  Looking at cultivating a fresher profile? Cut out sugar, processed foods and those foods with saturated fats. Fat oxidation produces free radicals, which produce over 200 volatile carbonyl chemicals that are hazardous to our health, cautions Gopakumar, adding, Eat green vegetables, carrots, tomatoes, walnuts, and peaches as they aid in antioxidant production. Increase the intake of squalene, a free radical scavenger. Up to one percent of it is found in olive oil. It is found in abundance in deep-sea shark liver oil, and in modest levels in rice bran and vegetable oils.  DO IT RIGHT   Make time for physical and mental relaxation. Regular walks, time spent in nature, and meditation help.   Get adequate sleep to boost antioxidant levels. Skip night-time binge-watching.   Overeating increases free radical production. Have moderate meals spaced out throughout the day.   Shun frozen and processed foods. Opt for organic food.",The Stressor Setback: Everything you need to know about oxidative stress,RICE

Even if the person behind the original recipe may have passed away, they remain immortal through it for generations to come.  Here's one such story that revolves around a young girl's search for the recipe of a type of rasam that was lost with the demise of her grandmother. Paati's Rasam, concocted by mother-daughter duo Janaki and Dhwani Sabesh, has heartwarming ingredients of love, loss and other powerful emotions that food can hold.  Of food and family  Rasam is little Malli's comfort food too. Weekends at her paati's house involved head massages, engrossing stories, endless banter and a meal comprising piping hot gottu rasam, prepared in an eeyachombu.  Paati would gently ladle some hot rasam over the mountain of rice on her plate and top it off with a generous dollop of ghee. After a mouthful, Malli would compliment her paati saying, 'You are the best rasam-maker. Can I have it every day and will you teach me to make it?' But the reply would always be, 'Someday Malli, someday'.  Little did Malli know that shed never see that day because paati was soon a memory. Dhwani, the co-author, recounts her childhood days and paatis influence on her. ""Yes, I'm that Malli from the book. It talks about my Sarasa paati who passed away in 2011. I have grown up with my grandparents since I was five and Ive been fortunate to enjoy all of paatis cooking. After her passing, I stopped liking rasam until I started making it by myself.""  Little Mallis hunt for the recipe begins when shes asked to write down an essay on the one thing she loved the most. While there were plenty of objects of her paati's memory like her yellow silk sari, the books they read together, and the sudoku puzzles they solved, it was rasam that topped her list. Malli's mother calls her siblings and experiments with different combinations of spices, but there's no luck.  Janaki Sabesh shares how writing about rasam transported the duo back in time to paatis house. ""One of my friends would call the gottu rasam a no-kachada-rasam as it had minimal ingredients. More than me, my sister and daughter have inherited the art of cooking from amma. The one habit Dhwani and I have picked up is to add a spoon of sugar to anything we eat and rasam was not spared either,"" she laughs.  A taste of home  After multiple failed attempts, Malli and her mom head to paatis cupboard and rummage the shelves. They stumble upon her medical report and on the envelope, in neat handwriting, is the recipe. Malli gets to have paati's rasam now and forever. For what looks like a sweet and simple ending, Dhwani and Janaki had over 25 versions of how the story could end,  ""Since its a picture book, we had to be conscious with minimal text. How much can we say without saying it and let the pictures do the talking? Our shortest draft was 550 words and we also dabbled with many characters from childhood,"" notes Dhwani.  Besides the empathetic plot, what brings joy to the reading experience is the vibrant watercolour illustrations by Pallavi Jain and the captivating storyboard by Vaijayanthi. Right from the individual elements that go into the making of rasam to a messy kitchen where it simmers to life, the artists offer you a realistic peek into Malli's home and heart. And, hoping that you fall in love with the versatile staple, the duo has also shared their family recipe of gottu rasam at the end of the book.

Apart from explaining the Union Minister about non-lifting of rice pertaining to the last (2020-21) Rabi season by the FCI  although the custom milled rice was ready with the millers  they also brought to his notice the misinformation being spread by State BJP leaders including Union Minister for Culture and Tourism G. Kishan Reddy.  The delegation has explained to Mr. Goyal about the letters written by the Civil Supplies Commissioner of Telangana and District Collectors to the FCI on lifting the Rabi rice to ease storage space with millers for Kharif procurement. It was again reiterated that there would be no parboiled rice procurement from this Rabi season.  Speaking to mediapersons after their meeting with Mr. Goyal, Minister for Agriculture S. Niranjan Reddy along with others said they had requested the Centre to give clarity whether it would procure paddy beyond 60 lakh tonnes already agreed upon, since more than half of the grain produced was yet to reach the procurement centres. They also wanted to know whether the State had to continue procurement centres or not.  On the FCI delay in lifting the rice pertaining to the last Rabi, Mr. Niranjan Reddy said it was the responsibility of the FCI to lift the milled rice from millers. He stated that Mr. Goyal had spoken to FCI authorities over the issue and was informed that there was shortage of railway rakes due to the brisk movement of fertilizers.

In this beauty pageant, all models and show stoppers were diabetics. In its fourth year, the main aim of the pageant was to uplift the morale of diabetics and make them feel that they dont have a disease but more of a lifestyle disorder.  This years theme was a tribute to Covid warriors and survivors. Professionals were called in to groom the contestants so they can live a glamourous life for a day. Make-up and hair was taken care of by the hospital. The top ten contestants had a question and answer session after which the winners were decided.  Doctor and model Dr Aditi Govitrikar graced the occasion. Dr Reema Kashiv, Diabetologist at Noble hospital, said, This contest aims to boost confidence in diabetic people. Participants are also encouraged to remain fit thanks to the fitness round, where they have to showcase their stamina and balance. Thanks to the focus on fitness, many participants have experienced weight loss which helped in the reduction of HbA1c.  Post snakebite, early intervention saved childs limb  A 12-year-old boy was referred to Dr Sagar Lad Consultant Paediatrician at Jehangir Hospital, following a snakebite. The boy was in a state of shock. He was initially admitted to a city nursing home, however, due to the severity of his illness, he was referred to Jehangir hospital.  Clinically, it seemed to be Russells viper (Russells viper bite is an occupational hazard of rice farmers throughout its geographical range) on the right hand. This led to massive swelling of the arm, which causes decreased blood supply and compression of nerves, resulting in decreased sensation. This complication is called compartment syndrome. If such a condition is not treated urgently, it can lead to amputation. The local effects of snakebite include tissue necrosis, oedema, and compartment syndrome. Patients may also be left with permanent physical deformities due to residual sequelae of the snakebite.  Compartment syndrome after a snakebite is an uncommon occurrence and it occurs because of the toxins liberated by a poisonous snake, Dr Sagar Lad, a senior paediatric intensivist at Jehangir hospital, said.  Considering the severity of illness, the child was referred to the senior hand and wrist surgeon at Jehangir Hospital, Dr Vijay Malshikare. The child also had abnormal blood parameters, a clotting system and low platelet count. An emergency surgical decompression of the whole limb (fasciotomy) was done to relieve the pressure of the hand. This timely surgical intervention saved the boys limb from amputation, said Dr Vijay Malshikare. It was a high-risk case due to the abnormal blood parameters and shock state, so giving the anaesthesia was challenging, said Dr Sandhya Sathe, senior Anaesthetic at Jehangir hospital.  The surgery was done in September and after 3 months, the child has recovered fully with good movement of the hand. It was a team effort and timely intervention, the doctors said, adding that such complication is not so common after a poisonous snakebite but awareness in the community is important.  India has seen an estimated 1.2 million (12 lakh) snakebite deaths from 2000 to 2019  an average of 58,000 per year. The inappropriate perception and inadequate awareness and knowledge about snakes and snakebites is a matter of concern.",Pune Health Matters: A beauty pageant for diabetics and a timely surgery to save limb after snakebite,RICE

Speaking to reporters in New Delhi on Wednesday along with Nalgonda MP N. Uttam Kumar Reddy, Bhongir MP Komatireddy Venkat Reddy and TPCC Campaign Committee chairman Madhu Yashki Goud, he said that this drama was being enacted on the advice of a political strategist called Sunil, who is closely associated with both Union Home Minister Amit Shah and Telangana Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao.  I will expose the nexus between TRS and BJP soon to explain how Telangana farmers are falling prey to the monstrous plans of BJP-TRS governments for the last two months, he said.  He claimed that the meeting of TRS MPs with Union Agriculture Minister Piyush Goyal and the meeting of Telangana BJP leaders with Amit Shah on the same day in New Delhi were pre-decided and the outcomes were made public in a manner that they left farmers in a state of confusion.  Mr. Reddy also said that it was ridiculous for Mr. Shah to suggest his partymen a campaign in Telangana on the plank of corruption of KCR when he had all the evidence and power to order an investigation by the ED and the CBI. Union Minister Kishan Reddy and State BJP president Bandi Sanjay only make allegations and do nothing. Which invisible power is stopping the BJP government from taking action against KCR?, he asked.  TRS MPs meeting with Mr. Goyal was just an eyewash as the Minister already made a statement on the floor of Parliament that the Centre will purchase 60 lakh MTs of paddy from Telangana. Their protest in Parliament was aimed at shielding the Modi government from the wrath of the entire Opposition, he claimed.  Mr. Uttam Reddy said that the KCR government did not even make adequate arrangements for gunny bags, transportation or IKP centres leading to damage of paddy produce due to unseasonal rains. He said it was ridiculous on the part of the TRS government to ask farmers to completely drop paddy cultivation in the next season. The entire rice produced in Telangana could be exported if the State government gives an incentive of 3,000 crore.  Mr. Venkat Reddy reminded that it was the Congress that started IKP centres to procure farmers produce and the previous Congress-led UPA government enhanced MSP for paddy from 400 to 1,000 in a single shot. It also waived off crop loans of nearly 60,000 crore in a single take to relieve farmers from their debts.  Mr. Goud alleged a scam of 18,000 crore in paddy procurement in Telangana. He said that rice millers purchased paddy from farmers by paying just 1,300 to 1,400 while the KCR government procured 53 lakh metric tonnes of paddy from rice millers by paying MSP of 1,940. If the BJP was sincere, it should order a probe into paddy procurement, he said.","TRS, BJP scripted blame game over paddy on pollster’s advice: Cong.",RICE

Author Sugata Srinivasaraju has penned down more such lesser known facts in his latest book Furrows in a Field: Furrows in a Field: The Unexplored Life of HD Deve Gowda (Penguin Random House, `799) which is a biography of the former prime minister.  The book saw a grand launch by MN Venkatachaliah, former chief justice of India on December 20 at Taj West End, Bengaluru, in the presence of JD(S) supremo himself. The other guests included SS Meenakshisundaram, former secretary to government of India, Chiranjeevi Singh, former ambassador of India to UNESCO and BL Shankar, former chairman, Karnataka Legislative Council.  Srinivasaraju said that it was nothing less of a task for him to condense down Gowdas vast political career into the book. He has read the book and critically communicated to me that I have been fair to him, his work and his politics, says Srinivasaraju, adding that Gowda was the one who never traded his self esteem for power.  Speaking about what makes Gowda different from other prime ministers, the author says Gowda was someone who was always ranked as an outsider. The other prime ministers before him either had socio-capital, cultural capital or were from the Hindi belt. Deve Gowda was the only one who did not have any of this infrastructure, says Srinivasaraju, pointing out unlike Narendra Modi, Gowda was not propelled by any organisations.  The book has explained in detail Gowdas contribution to irrigation and water sharing mechanisms. I have been looking at World Bank documents on how he rehabilitated people for the Krishna basin project. Till date, World Bank quotes this as the finest packages that have ever been given, says Srinivasaraju, who has been a journalist for the past 25 years. While writing about the Farakka treaty, which he looked at very closely for which he spoke to the people of Bangladesh, he says the calculations done have not created any problem in the last 25 years.  Thats the accuracy with which he did it and there is a story behind it. Jyoti Basu, then CM of West Bengal, was very afraid to go ahead with it because that was something that would affect the state. People in Bihar supporting his government did not want it because a huge flood relief fund will be cancelled. There were lots of vested interests, he explains. He continues, One day, in a meeting, Deve Gowda says to Basu I will handle Sheikh Hasina and we will do it.  Gowdas dedication to work and politics is completely unmissable. I have seen many Chief Ministers and Prime Ministers but he was that one person who used to wake up at 4-4.30 am, reads the file and makes notes, says Meenakshisundaram, adding that a part of credit for Bengalurus IT park and international airport should also go to him. Praising the works of Srinivasaraju, Singh says, in the book, the author has brought out the not a politician but the man HD Devegowda.  This is a biography in which he looks at the beauty of Kashmir and thinks I should have brought along my wife.

It continues to be the staple food among Indians, notably South Indians.  Today, modern milling technology has replaced traditional hand-pounded rice with polished white rice almost in every Indian household. Cooking quality, the appearance of the grains (colour, texture), taste and convenience are important factors that are considered while purchasing rice.  Just that, one has to adopt the correct cooking method. To minimise the loss of water-soluble vitamins, do not wash rice repeatedly before cooking and also use just enough water, so that the grains absorb the water fully and there is no excess leftover after cooking. The preferred ways to make rice are pressure/steam cooking.  Common types of rice consumed in India  Brown rice: Is the clear choice for the health-conscious. Brown rice is a perfect example of wholegrain. Paddy husk is removed and the grain is not polished. Wholegrains contain additional beneficial nutrients, including more fiber, micro-nutrients (vitamins and minerals), and phyto-nutrients. The chief advantage of brown rice is that it contains two-three times the fiber of white rice, providing slower and more sustained blood sugar levels. It takes longer to cook, but the nutty flavour and harder texture makes it enjoyable. It is more susceptible to infestation during storage, hence, always buy in small quantities.  Milled/polished rice: Rice that has been milled in order to remove husk, bran and germ, leaves it starch-rich and strips it of many nutrients. Rice is polished to improve its acceptability, but during polishing, the B vitamins are lost.  Parboiled rice: This has better nutritive value than white, milled polished rice. Parboiling involves soaking paddy in water for a short time followed by heating once or twice in steam and drying before milling. This has several advantages  the starch is gelatinised and nutrients are conserved as they are transported from bran to endosperm. It is often yellowish in colour. Eating large amounts of white polished rice, that has a high glycemic index (GI) contributes to a higher glycemic load (GL). It has been found to be positively associated with type 2 diabetes risk.  Glycemic index (GI): This shows the effect different foods have on blood sugar levels. It is the ranking of foods from zero-100 based on their immediate effect on blood glucose levels. The foods are compared with a reference food such as glucose and are tested in equivalent carbohydrate amounts.  Glycemic load (GL): This is the glycemic response to an ingested food, which depends not only on the GI, but also on the total amount of carbohydrates consumed in a meal.  Dietary advice for diabetics  Reduce the quantity of rice in each meal as per the recommended dietary allowance  Choose the right quality. The order of preference would be first parboiled brown rice, followed by brown, Basmati, semi-polished and lastly white-polished rice  To prevent chronic diseases, half of your grain intake must be from wholegrains. Substitute brown/semi-polished rice for white rice for one meal a day  Consider factors that lower GI. Eat rice with low GI foods (such as vegetables, pulses/ legumes, viscous fiber foods and dairy products).  This will reduce the overall meals GI. For example, khichidi, sambar rice, idli with thick dal, vegetable pulao, vegetable upma, curd rice, bissi bella bhat, dosa, pesarattu, adai, vegetable paratha etc.    (K Sunitha Premalatha, chief dietitian, Yashoda Hospital)",Can a diabetic eat rice?

Reports of farmers spending sleepless nights trying to sell paddy have been coming from across the western pockets of the state. Allegations of inadequate mandis, a short window for sale and rampaging middlemen have forced the hands of rice growers, who are resorting to distress sales.  In a state where the government swears by farmers and their welfare, the agriculturists are the worst hit. The kharif paddy procurement started from November 1 and will continue till March 30. For procurement, there is a state-level panel and collectors chair the district committees. The issue of tokens and creation of mandis are prerequisites for the smooth beginning of the procurement process. But season after season, farmers have been made to go through the same ordeal despite a decentralised system in place.  There are a number of actors in the procurement process but all the good intent is lost in the procedural maze and vested interests that hold the farmers to ransom. It is not just this kharif seasons problem. The rabi procurement earlier this year too was embroiled in similar issues as thousands of farmers were left with unsold paddy.  This year, the farming community had to bear the brunt of nature as well. After drought-like conditions, unseasonal rains played havoc. Though cyclonic storm Jawad spared the state, the showers in its wake impacted crops across more than 5.78 lakh hectares in 12 districts. Farmers had to harvest early and the procurement delay has not helped. The entire process is a massive Rs 12,000 crore business and so much money is bound to breed corruption.  Farmers allege the hand of rice millers is behind the crisis. Middlemen from Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh too are exploiting the situation. Much of the blame must go to the district administrations that are entrusted with the smooth running of the process. The government has directed the engagement of women self-help groups to further decentralise procurement, but without adequate infrastructure and internal understanding of the mechanism at the grassroots, it might prove to be too little, too late.",Odisha’s paddy procurement woes,RICE

Shringla, who was on a working visit to Myanmar the last two days, met leaders of Suu Kyis party. It was Indias first high-level official outreach to Myanmars military regime since the coup in February this year.  Earlier this month, Suu Kyi was sentenced to a four-year jail term by a Myanmar court which held her guilty of inciting dissent in the first of a series of verdicts. Her sentence was later reduced to two years in jail. India had reacted sharply, underlining that the rule of law and the democratic process must be upheld, and any development there that undermines these processes and accentuates differences is a matter of deep concern.  Shringla, who returned to New Delhi Thursday, met Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, head of the military regime and chairman of the State Administrative Council, and key junta members dealing with foreign relations. He also met the military-backed Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP) and some civil society members. These apart, he met ambassadors, including those of the US, Australia and Japan, and UN representatives.  During his meetings, Shringla emphasized Indias interest in seeing Myanmars return to democracy at the earliest; release of detainees and prisoners; resolution of issues through dialogue; and complete cessation of all violence, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said.  He reaffirmed Indias strong and consistent support to the ASEAN initiative and expressed the hope that progress would be made in a pragmatic and constructive manner, based on the five-point consensus, the MEA said in a statement.

2021-12-23,https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/lucknow/yogi-adityanath-kisan-samman-diwas-farmers/,"Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Thursday claimed that before the BJP came to power in the Centre in 2014 farmers across India killed themselves because the previous governments did not implement pro-farmer policies. He made the remark at a Kisan Samman Diwas event organised here on the 119th birth anniversary of former prime minister Chaudhary Charan Singh.  Farms can be a symbol of happiness and prosperity only when farmers are aware. I am happy that Chaudhary Charan Singhs dreams for farmers are being fulfilled by the Central and state governments. At the Centre, the BJP government under Modi ji has been working with a vision for farmers since 2014. It is worth praising. We all know that before 2014, farmers were forced to die by suicide in the country. Lakhs of farmers killed themselves. But, after 2014, pro-farmer policies were implemented and the result is for everyone to see, Adityanath said.  He added, Even though the MSP [Minimum Support Price] announcement was done in 1968, its implementation and ensuring that farmers get the benefit of this has been done by PM Narendra Modi. In 2018, the MSP was made 1.5 times the cost of agricultural produce. When the Centre and state government work together, then the results are there to see. In 2017, when we formed the government in UP, we had challenges in front of us. Farmers in Uttar Pradesh were forced to commit suicide.  Because of the previous governments anti-scientific policies, farmers were either moving out of farming or those who were forced to do farming were under heavy debt, leaving them with no choice but to kill themselves. After we came to power, we took the job of waiving loans of 86 lakh farmers. It was the first government in UP to waive loans worth Rs 36,000 crore.  The chief minister claimed that schemes and projects for irrigation that had been pending for years were being completed to help farmers. We have given irrigation facilities on land measuring more than 22 lakh hectares in the last four-and-a-half years, he added.  Adityanath alleged that before 2017 the state had no policy for crop procurement. It was done through people. After our government came, we said we would purchase directly from farmers. In the last four years, crop procurement by the government has increased. Under the last government [Akhilesh Yadav administration], procurement of rice was 123.61 lakh metric tonnes. In the last four-and-a-half years, the government has procured 203.26 lakh metric tonnes of rice and transferred the price directly under MSP to the bank accounts of farmers. Similarly, there was a huge difference in wheat procurement too, he added.  The chief minister claimed that his government had worked to improve the lives of farmers. The last government was not helping farmers, but was working to exploit them, he alleged.  Adityanath also claimed that sugarcane dues pending since 2010 were cleared by his government. The chief minister encouraged farmers to practise organic farming to improve the quality of their produce. The use of fertilisers and pesticides is giving birth to new diseases. The solution for this has been given by PM Modi today. It is organic farming. Cow-based farming will ensure cow protection, and will also increase agricultural produce and promote organic farming. This way, we will ensure our faith is respected, and also increase farm produce. And cows have all the products to replace chemicals used in farming, Adityanath claimed.","Kisan Samman Diwas: Anti-scientific policies of past govts led to farmer suicides, says CM Yogi Adityanath",RICE

The petition urged Mr. Vijayan to ditch mega projects such as SilverLine in favour of pragmatic, people-friendly development models. The latter were in fact what Kerala, which has been at the receiving end of two major floods, other natural calamities, and the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, sorely needed, it said.  Well-known personalities, including veteran journalist B.R.P. Bhaskar, activist Civic Chandran, environmental scientist Radha Gopalan, academic and author J. Devika, and representatives of organisations including the Wayanad Prakrithi Samrakshana Samiti, Paristhithi Aikya Vedi, Kerala Jaivakarshaka Samiti, and Save Our Rice Network have affixed their names to the petition.  They reminded the government that Sugathakumari, who died on December 23 last year, had dedicated her life to struggles aimed at the protection of the environment.  The petitioners pointed out that the demand that the government immediately drop this venture, which would split the State into two and push it into a debt trap in addition to inviting an ecological disaster, was resonating throughout Kerala.  Can we ignore the videos of local people resisting officials who arrived to lay the stone for the SilverLine project in places such as Alappuzha, Nooranad, Padanilam, Karingali, and Puncha? Will the single-line reply This project is essential for Kerala suffice to answer all the questions and doubts raised by the peoples resistance to this project? Sir, we too wish to join the protesters to say openly that what Kerala needs is not SilverLine,'' the petitioners noted.  The group also observed that noted scientists, engineers, environmental and social scientists, journalists, and political, social, and environmental activists have, on the basis of scientific information, have issued the verdict that the SilverLine project was technically impractical and financially unviable.",CM urged to drop SilverLine project,RICE

So, Im curious to know how Diageo interprets them. Theyve just launched their second edition Epitome Reserve, this one a peated single malt, with just 3,600 numbered bottles (signed by master blender Mahesh Patil). It comes quick on the heels of their first edition, a single grain rice whisky launched six months ago.  Im in conversation with Vikram Damodaran, the Chief Innovation Officer of Diageo, who, along with Patil, is responsible for both the products. To him, the emerging Indian consumer is looking for product authenticity (in craft), and a narrative with roots that run deep  quite like the banyan embossed on the Epitome bottle.  When whisky met wine  The single malt is distilled at their facility in Ponda, Goa, by the Mandovi river. Select Indian six-row barley, from the Himalayan foothills over 2,000 kilometers away, goes into its making and the whisky  matured in ex-bourbon casks  is finished in casks that previously held Cabernet Sauvignon wine. Keshav Prakash, the founder of The Vault, an importer of boutique spirits, had occasion to taste it recently, and told me that the maturation had been managed brilliantly, with the whisky balanced yet interesting, making it a great dram to pair with tandoor or BBQ. Overall, an impressive world whisky, he said.  Although Damodaran does not want to mention the length of maturation, it would be safe to say (given that the angels share, or the whisky that evaporates during maturation, in India is 2 to 2.5 times that in Scotland, due to our higher temperatures) that the limited edition would be the equivalent of an 18-year-old from the Scottish isles.  Vikram Damodaran, Chief Innovation Officer of Diageo | Photo Credit: Special arrangement  Epitome 2.0, like its predecessor, is also non-chill filtered, which to whisky purists helps retain some of the original integrity of the liquid. What they do, however  and this is where Damodaran goes into geek mode  is use a specific filtration process at the end that brings a touch of effervescence that lends it a colour unlike the normal chill filtered liquid. The geek then turns poet: Its a very evocative look, the golden yellow of the whisky infused with the wine red. Peated whiskies are normally more challenging for a consumers palate, and he feels that the winey finish helps add a rounded touch, making it more accessible.  Given the strides that Indian single malt brands have made over the last 10 years, I ask how Diageo would compare the taste profile from India with their Scottish contemporaries. Damodaran feels ours is quite distinctive, woody, malty and heavy bodied, because of the ingredients used, especially the six-row barley.  Dram for the curious  Though Epitome is a luxury spirit, the overarching definition is experience. And thats how it will be presented to the customer  starting with curated tasting sessions in markets where it is available (like Goa and Bengaluru) and, in the fullness of time, distillery tours and more.  Ive seen, as Indian craft brands come to the fore, that heritage is no longer a primary driving factor for the emerging consumer. But they do love a good narrative (such as the finishing in the cabernet sauvignon wine casks here). Another highlight: their connoisseurship and curiosity to try new expressions. It is this curiosity that Diageo is bargaining on as they set out on their craft journey in India.  8,000 in Goa and 12,500 in Bengaluru.

While the run - Juggernaut For A Cause - started at Mangalajodi on December 19, the informal group which has named itself Mera Terah Run (MTR) ran along with the Indian Navy personnel on the INS Chilka campus on Tuesday.  Aimed at creating funds for social causes, the collective has this year decided to explore Chilika to raise funds for Iksha Foundation through a website Wildlife for Cancer. Wildlife for Cancer was started by Ramki Srinivasan, an avid wildlife photographer, to raise funds for underprivileged children suffering from cancer by selling his stunning pictures of Indias wildlife. The proceeds go to Iksha Foundation, said Rajesh Vorkady, a 49-year-old member of the group.  But the week-long run is unlike the regular commercial marathons. The members are running in phases (13 km in each phase) while exploring Chilika. After their first and second runs at Mangalajodi, the members met a group of villagers and biologist Tiasa Adhya working towards conservation of fishing cats besides, the traditional boat-makers of the wetland. Their second stop was Barkul on Tuesday where they visited the Wetland Research Centre to learn about Chilikas ecology, conservation and biodiversity.  MTR since its inception, Rajesh said, has been picking up socially relevant causes and combines awareness building and fundraising to support them by running a half-marathon in the catchment areas of relevance to the selected cause. Since this year, we have tied up with Ramki who himself is a cancer survivor, we decided to explore wildlife. Chilika was suggested to us by one of our members, a colonel in the Army who is posted in Odisha, he said, adding that the journey has been an eye-opener for all the members and donations have already started coming in. We came to know about the fishing cat conservation, life of fishermen in Chilika, organic rice being grown in the wetland and a lot of other exciting things.  The collective was launched in 2014 by Jagdish Damania, a software engineer and also the eldest in the group. The motto was Run. Rail. Road. Raise. Since we are an informal collective, all the funds that we raise go directly to the beneficiaries.

During the 2022-23 fiscal, the thrust will be on increasing productivity and farmer incomes through the adoption of technology and developing robust marketing networks, while staying true to the concept of farming in harmony with nature, according to the draft annual plan for 2022-23 drawn up by the department.  The number of schemes will be pared down to 12 to improve efficiency in implementation. Most of the projects are expected to be implemented in convergence with those of the Local Self-Government department (LSGD) on a 50% fund-sharing basis.  Major spending proposals include 324.28 crore for area expansion of all major crops, 127 crore for rice development, 53 crore for vegetable production, 14.5 crore for fruits and 48.9 crore for the coconut sector.  Cafeteria model  Projects will be implemented on a flexible cafeteria model allowing for interchangeability of sub-components within the schemes with respect to Agricultural Ecological Unit (AEU)-based requirements. Greater emphasis will be placed on integrated farming methods, value addition and marketing. Schemes based on agro-ecological zones (AEZ) are planned to avoid adverse effects on the agricultural sector, according to the department.  The devastating impact of the natural calamities and the pandemic on the farm sector and food security underscore the importance of food self-sufficiency and farming in harmony with nature, the draft noted. Keeping this in mind, the 2022-23 plan is aimed at solving problems in the agricultural sector by incorporating the ideas of real farmers.  The States per-hectare productivity of paddy, coconut, vegetables, fruits and nutricereals is lower than that of the southern states and the national average, the draft said, citing 2017-18 figures.  Low productivity, coupled with price fluctuations, has resulted in a progressive reduction of farmers income, it noted.  Among other things, the department also hopes to eliminate duplication of vegetable area expansion schemes carried out by various agencies under it and the LSGD.",Kerala Agriculture department seeks to overhaul implementation of projects in farm sector,RICE
2021-12-24,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/this-clean-cooking-fuel-plan-needs-more-firing-up/article38023687.ece,"Sustaining LPG adoption in rural India is a challenge but the goal must be a more sustainable energy basket per family  In the middle of November 2021, I met Leenu Biswal, who is in her early twenties, in Dandasingha gram panchayat of Deogarh district in Odisha. She lives with her in-laws and is pregnant with her second child. Her husband works in another district and visits home once in a few months. They have an Ujjwala connection but it has not been refilled for a long time. The Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY) is a flagship scheme of 2016, with an objective to make clean cooking fuel such as LPG available to the rural and deprived households which were otherwise using traditional cooking fuels such as firewood, coal, cow-dung cakes.  Health and clean energy  When I ask her whether she likes cooking with gas, she nods with an emphatic yes. She also says that she wants a refill. I ask her if she has the sum of about 950 to pay for the refill of the large cylinder. Its a yes, again. We go through her LPG customer book and call the LPG distributor to make a refill booking. The cylinder is delivered to her in two days.  Also Read Modi launches phase-II of Ujjwala gas connection scheme for the poor  There is a lesson in this. Kirk Smith, the eminent professor from Berkeley who passed away in 2020, was an expert who worked on indoor air pollution in India for over three decades, who talked about the high returns in terms of health gains by targeting pregnant women to have LPG access.  There is also Dr. Gargi who runs a rural health clinic in Udaipur with a non-governmental organisation, who recommends cooking with gas to tuberculosis patients who consult her. According to the recently released National Family Health Survey (NFHS)-5, there was a higher prevalence of TB in households that were using solid fuels when compared to those using clean cooking fuels in most States.  With the number of LPG distributors going up in the five years of Ujjwala, from 17,916 to 25,116, the number of administrative blocks which do not have an LPG distributor has come down drastically. There are hundreds if not thousands of villages where there was not a single LPG connection before the days of Ujjwala; hence the delivery of cylinders at the village level was unheard of.  Also Read Finding a healthy way to cook  Use of fuel stacking  In villages, I often see kitchens using multiple types of cooking stoves  LPG, fuelwood, induction or electric heater and even kerosene. An open firewood chulha is often used for bath water, cooking large quantities of parboiled rice and cattle feed. Some of these may not shift to LPG anytime soon.  This fuel stacking is similar to the practice of the poor  of having a basket of livelihood options instead of being reliant on a single source of income. This takes into account factors such as uneven cash flow, seasonal availability of biomass, and ambient heating requirement during winters.  Also Read Cooking with gas, not wood  During extreme weather events, LPG cylinders come to the rescue.  Data on LPG use  Over the five years, the average per capita consumption among Ujjwala customers has hovered around three cylinders per year (of 14.2 kg), rising to 4.2 (2020-21) when the full impact of free refills under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana was seen.  A paper in Nature (Kar et al.) showed that only 45% of non-Ujjwala rural consumers use five or more cylinders per year, while data from oil marketing companies show that from October 2020 to September 2021, 32% of Ujjwala households were using five cylinders or more in a year. Therefore, relatively poorer Ujjwala consumers are reaching the LPG consumption levels of relatively well-off non-Ujjwala rural consumers. LPG has earned its place in the cooking energy basket of the poor. It is also not a greenhouse gas (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change), assigned with a global warming potential (GWP) factor of zero. Solar, electric heater, improved biomass chulha and biogas also qualify to be a part of this energy basket.  Also Read High LPG prices are scorching the air pollution fight  Factors that helped  After completing the target of enlisting eight crore Ujjwala customers in late 2019, the three oil marketing companies which handle the distribution of LPG through their network of distributors have shifted their focus to reach out to low refill consumers.  A quick recap of what has made it possible for someone like Leenu to have an option to use LPG, is in order. It was the successful implementation of the Direct Benefit Transfer of LPG (DBTL) or PAHAL (Pratyaksh Hanstantrit Labh) scheme of 2014 which freed up the financial resources needed to dream of a large-scale programme for deposit-free LPG connections. Once Ujjwala was conceptualised and launched, enhanced availability of LPG was ensured. The next was to enhance various capacities such as of the ports for handling imports, of tanks for storage of LPG, of pipelines and trucks for transportation of gas, and of bottling plants for filling in more cylinders. Production of cylinders, pressure regulators, hose and affordable LPG stoves was also enhanced. New distributors/dealers were appointed to reach remote pockets.  Comment | Health first, fiscal prudence later  In addition, then Petroleum Minister Dharmendra Pradhan also sustained enthusiasm for Ujjwala, creating avenues for local MPs and other elected representatives to support Ujjwala and its implementation.  A challenging phase  The novel coronavirus pandemic has resulted in LPG prices having gone up and governmental support focusing on other challenges. This development could derail the gains made by Ujjwala customers in terms of LPG adoption. It is time to get creative about how to sustain LPG adoption in these challenging times. Ujjwala also has the potential to deliver benefits on many fronts.  Also read | CAG sees diversion of LPG cylinders for commercial use  Overall, the push has to be such that every household moves toward adopting a more sustainable cooking energy basket. Improvements in regular and on-demand supplies of LPG, options for refill financing, alternative remunerative uses for cow dung and bio mass  possibly on the pattern of procurement of cow dung as is being done in Chhattisgarh  and a massive boost to womens incomes through the National Rural Livelihoods Mission all have great potential to nudge women to choosing a more sustainable cooking mix.

These farmer bodies were a part of the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) that spearheaded a year-long successful protest against the BJP-led Centres three farm laws on Delhis borders that recently ended after these laws were repealed.  Rajewal emerged as one of the most prominent farmer leaders during the SKMs agitation. And, he is now expected to play a significant role in the Punjab polls slated for early next year.  Also Read | 22 farm unions float a political front in Punjab, to contest all seats  Rajewals outfit BKU (Rajewal) grew rapidly in popularity during the farm agitation, with videos of his speeches circulated widely. An accomplished orator with a sharp political sense, Rajewal has been a farm union leader in Punjab since the 1970s.  A big farmer, who owns 60 acres of land and two rice mills in and around his native village Rajewal in Ludhiana district, Rajewal joined farmer agitational campaigns after getting associated with the Punjab Kheti-Badi Union in the early 1970s. He was with the BKU Lakhowal from 1974 to 1988 and then shifted to the BKU (Mann). Subsequently, in 2001, he floated his own outfit.  Rajewal also runs a school, a college and an honesty stationery shop for students, called Sach Di Dukan, in his village. It is not managed by any shopkeeper: it has a box for customers to take away stationery items and deposit the money as they wish.  A former employee of the Punjab telephone department, Rajewal had also been once in the business of Arhtiya (commission agent) in Khanna Mandi in Ludhiana, but withdrew himself from it several years ago to be in sync with farmer union members.  In 1974, a big farmer movement was launched when restrictions were put on farmers for selling their wheat outside the state and then farmers launched an agitation defying the zonal restrictions on movement of wheat. Rajewal was also a part of that and even went to jail, said Onkar Singh Augar, general secretary, BKU (Rajewal), who has been with him for the past three decades.  Also Read | Mixed views among Punjab farmer unions on taking political plunge  Active mainly in Patiala, Sangrur, Mohali, Ropar, Ludhiana, Kapurthala, Hoshiarpur, Ferozepur, Nawanshahr, Jalandhar and several districts of the Malwa region, the BKU (Rajewal) was not much organised earlier but during the farm stir against the agri laws in the course of last one year, it rapidly evolved and grew to become one of the leading farmer organisations of Punjab.  The BKU (Rajewal)s activists were at the forefront of anti-farm laws protests, getting together to gherao political leaders, especially from the BJP and the SAD, whenever they used to come for attending any political functions or events in various districts across the state.  This resulted in the remarkable rise of Rajewal, who was earlier considered to be more a businessman, as a key farmer leader of Punjab.  Onkar also pointed out that Rajewals entire family has been active in the farmer agitations for decades and his father, brother and even sister-in-law have even been sent to jails in this regard.  A pragmatic leader, Rajewal has also shown flexibility in his political leanings. Over the past decades, he has remained close to different political parties ranging from the Congress to the Shiromani Akali Dal, to the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP).  Also Read | How farmers movement embodies a politics of hope  Onkar explained that Rajewal supported the Congress government in 2002 on some farmer issues but when it did not agree to release Rs 110 crore as compensation for farmers paddy damages, he launched an agitation.  He said that seven years ago, when then Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal sought to appoint him as his partys Halka Incharge (constituency incharge) from the Samrala Assembly segment, Rajewal did not accept the offer as he was then not interested in contesting the polls.  Ahead of the 2017 Punjab Assembly polls, Rajewal, however, started backing the AAP. Later, he became close to Congress CM Captain Amarinder Singh, who has now quit the Congress after being ousted as the CM.  In the run-up to the upcoming Punjab polls, the AAP had reportedly offered to make him its CM candidate but under the pressure of farmer unions, he did not accept it. It is another matter that their newly-floated SSM might negotiate with the AAP to forge an alliance for the current polls.  Once in favour of recommendations of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) and GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade), Rajewal later changed his stand, and joined other farmer unions in opposing them.  A few months ago, he had opposed Haryana farmer leader Gurnam Singh Chaduni over his political ambitions. Chaduni recently floated his own political outfit, announcing that it will contest the Punjab polls. Taking a political plunge, Rajewal is also all set to join the electoral battlefield as the SKM leader now.","From being a farm stir face, Rajewal set to play a key role in Punjab polls",RICE

For instance, the TRS has declared a war of sorts on the BJP for not directing the Food Corporation of India to lift its entire Kharif rice stock and for being brutally frank that it would not procure parboiled rice from the upcoming Rabi season saying there is no demand.  As the party continues to create a ruckus, the BJP now has declared a counter-offensive against the pink brigade. Union Home Minister Amit Shah has asked his party MPs and leaders in Telangana to take on the TRS, expose Chief Minister K Chandrashekar Raos alleged corruption and the harassment of BJP workers by the ruling party in the state whenever they try to stage demonstrations. Yet, there seems to be some kind of an understanding between the two parties.  The TRS has always helped the BJP whenever the Centre piloted controversial bills in Parliament in the past. It could need the help of the TRS again in the near future, perhaps at the time of the presidential and vice-presidential elections next year if it falls short of numbers. For, the outcome of the UP elections is unpredictable.  Remember both the TRS and the BJP came to power in the state and the Centre simultaneously and have been in the saddle for the last seven years. If BJP leaders have information on alleged corruption in the TRS regime, why havent the central enforcement agencies launched a crackdown so far? CBI and Enforcement Directorate actions have a history of bending to suit political conveniences.  The charade of the two parties lends credence to the Congress argument that both want to eliminate the latter from the political space as it is their common enemy. The BJP, an underdog in Telangana, wants to be seen as the principle opponent of the TRS, brushing the Congress aside, which suits KCR as he does not want the grand old party to acquire a new lease of life again.","Curious TRS, BJP play in Telangana",RICE

Revanth Reddy asserted that it was the responsibility of the State Government to purchase crops including paddy enlisted in the Minimum Support Price Act produced by farmers till the last bag.  He asserted that the government should procure entire paddy paying the MSP irrespective of how the purchase would be utilised later. How the procured grain will be utilised later is not the problem of farmers. The government can export rice, use it for supply to schools or use it in any other way it likes, but it is its the responsibility to purchase paddy from farmers, he said.  He expressed concern that farmers were undergoing severe hardship on account of the policies of the State and Central Governments that were unwilling to positively resolve the issues raised by them. The TRS president had colluded with millers and corporate houses to deny farmers their due in spite of his repeated claims on empowering farmers.  Farmers should grill the TRS leaders, including MLAs and MPs, whenever the latter approach them to educate them against paddy cultivation, he said. He ridiculed the governments assertion asking farmers not to go for paddy cultivation claiming that it was drama played by Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao to avoid losses that would be incurred on account of purchase of paddy.  Paddy when milled as raw rice entailed 15 per cent of brokenrice which would not be procured by the Central Government. Yield of rice in respect of parboiled variety was however 65 per cent and the government was therefore harping on procurement of parboiled rice by the Centre. The government should instead introduce viability gap funding for purchasing the entire commodity from farmers and could apply for permission from the Centre for exporting rice after milling.  Farmers are totally protected under the MSP Act and the government has to purchase all the 23 crops listed under the MSP Act. Failure of purchasing the grain amounts to violation of the Act, he said.  Displaying photographs of what he claimed paddy crop in the fields owned by the Chief Minister and his family at Yerravelli, Mr. Revanth Reddy wanted to know how Mr. Chandrasekhar Rao was cultivating paddy when he wanted over 90 per cent of farmers to refrain from doing so.  KTR, Harish invited  Mr Revanth Reddy asserted that the Congress was committed to protecting the interests of farmers as could be seen from the steps its government had initiated in Chhattisgarh.  The Congress government in Chhattisgarh was paying 2,540 a quintal for paddy that was close to 600 over and above the MSP. Advocating crop diversification, the neighbouring State Government was paying 9,000 an acre for those opting for diversification from paddy besides assuring total procurement of the alternative crop.  He invited Ministers K.T. Rama Rao and T. Harish Rao to Chhattisgarh to study the model adopted there so that it could be adopted in Telangana. I am assuring that they will be treated as State guests by the Congress government there, he said.",‘It’s the responsibility of govt. to purchase crops listed under MSP Act’,RICE

Claiming that general elections would be advanced to February and March in 2023 by the TRS and the agreement between the two parties is to create a fake fight in the next one year to reduce the impact of Congress in the state, he said the very idea of not buying the rice in the next season is part of that strategy.  Mr. Reddy said people of Telangana are not so naive and they are watching this drama and will teach a lesson to both TRS and BJP at the right time. Farmers are feeling cheated by both Modi and KCR and Congress will work to support the farmers. Women and youngsters should also realise the dangerous game being played by both the parties, he said.

This is also a change from the usual practice of temples letting out their lands on lease.  The temple has, however, leased out other lands to private parties, after retaining a 40-acre portion for its own use. Agricultural activities are taken up only once a year on most lands in the district. The presence of three open wells, three bore wells and a large irrigation tank on their land has encouraged the temple staff to look at this option. Over the last 10-15 years, various executive officers/joint commissioners encouraged us and what began with just 2-3 acres has now touched 32 acres of paddy cultivation. Our former superintendent Badrachalam guided us. Most of us are from agricultural background and manage the farm. We employ labourers for various operations like planting, weeding and harvesting, said a staff, who has been with the temple for over 32 years. This year, despite the heavy rain, the crops on this land and another 400 acres of private lands were saved by strengthening the bund of the tank using donor funds. Several years ago, the temple used to sell the paddy it cultivated to the Civil Supplies Corporation and buy rice from the proceeds of that sale. However, that practice was changed a few years ago and the staff now grow white Ponni and CO 51 varieties of paddy. The temple requires rice for annadhanam (free food for devotees), to make offerings to the deities (neivedhyam or amudhu padaithal), to make prasadams and also for annadhanam in Aadhi Arunachaleswarar and Balasubramaniaswamy temples.  In the last two Fasli years, the temple used 14,450 kg of rice for neivedhyam, 21,146 kg for use in making prasadam, 24,089 kg in annadhanam. It used to buy all this rice at 50- 55/kg.  Apart from these, the cattle in the goshala are given rice bran and broken rice as part of their feed. Since there is an abundance of straw, the temple also makes a saving on this count. The cow dung is used in the field as manure, which helps them reduce the amount spent on farming.  Minister for Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments P.K. Sekarbabu, who visited the lands recently, said he was delighted to witness such an effort. The staff do it as a labour of love. If needed, we can dig more open wells and sink borewells on agricultural lands belonging to the temple, he said.",Arunachaleswarar temple staff’s labour of love wins Minister’s appreciation,RICE
2021-12-26,https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/brunch/rude-food-by-vir-sanghvi-authenticity-is-overrated-101640494657524.html,"Given the current obsession with authenticity in food, I often wonder if we realise how much of the food we eat is newly invented and part of no authentic tradition. Many of the ingredients that we regard as integral to Indian food came from South America and only reached us when Europeans brought them here: tomatoes, potatoes, corn, chillis etc.  And so many of the dishes that we regard as being part of the ancient Indian tradition are restaurant creations from the 20th century. Butter Chicken, Masala Dosa, Chicken 65, Vada Pav, Chicken Tikka, and so many others.  This should not surprise us. It is true of all cuisines everywhere in the world. Spaghetti Bolognese was not created in Bologna but in England. Chicken Kiev was not invented in Kiev or anywhere in Ukraine. It was invented in New York. Pepperoni is not a traditional Italian topping for pizza. It is an American creation.  This is as true of the food of Asia. Along with sushi and sashimi, the one Japanese dish that has found popularity all over the world is Ramen. The sight of a Ramen house with diners loudly slurping their Ramen and soup strikes us as being quintessentially Japanese. And so it may bebut only now. Till the 1950s, hardly anybody in Japan ate Ramen.  Till then, the Japanese called Ramen Shina Soba or Chinese soba because the dish was regarded as being part of Chinese cuisine. All that changed after Japans defeat in the Second World War. The victorious American occupiers tried to feed the defeated Japanese masses, only to find that the country recorded its worst rice harvest in 42 years in 1945. The Japanese were then (and still are, in many ways) a predominantly rice-eating population, so there was a terrible food shortage and people went hungry.  The Americans responded by flooding the country with US wheat, hoping that the Japanese would eat bread. They didbread consumption in Japan more than doubled between 1948 to 1951. But much of the American wheat went into making Chinese-style wheat noodles, which eventually became an urban staple under the name of Ramen.  So, Ramen is hardly a traditional food in Japan. It is a Chinese dish that has become popular because of American occupation.  Noodle dishes boomed all over Asia after the Second World War. Take Pad Thai, perhaps the most popular Thai dish in the world. One story suggests that it was only invented in the 1930s by the Thai government to foster nation-building, and called Pad Thai to give it a patriotic character. (Pad means stir-fry, so Thai Stir-fry or something like that.)  The dish only took off in the 1950s and that is attributed to rice shortages during the Second World War. The Thais discovered that you could make two kilograms of rice noodles from a kilo of rice (no, I am not sure how this works either) so, they used their precious rice supplies for noodle-making. The Pad Thai recipe was already around so, the noodles went into Pad Thai, which became a way of feeding the nation. By the 1950s it had become a staple.  You can argue about the historicity of the stories but what is clear is that both Pad Thai and Ramen only took off after the Second World War and are relatively recent dishes, which are far from traditional in their own cuisines.  We went through a similar transformation in India. Till the 1950s, Indians did not really drink tea. It had been planted by the British using saplings brought from China, but the production was meant mainly for export. Tea drinking only took off in India in the fifties after a campaign by the Tea Board to get Indians to drink tea.  Because the taste of fine tea was alien to our palates, the Tea Board promoted inexpensive teas (made by a process called CTC) which could be cooked with milk and sugar to create the tea we now associate with every chai shop. You can judge the success of the Tea Boards campaign in India by looking at Sri Lanka where CTC consumption is low (they drink the real thingor orthodox, to use the technical term) and our kind of cooked tea is not the norm.  We recognise now that tandoori chicken and chicken tikka were popularised only in the 1950s by a restaurant called Moti Mahal in Delhi. But we also need to acknowledge that the tomato and butter-rich black dal that is served in all Indian restaurants around the world with such names as Dal Bukhara and Dal Makhni was also created at the same time. There were no tomatoes in Punjabi black dal when it was a home-made dish.  The original Moti Mahal in Daryaganj is no longer run by the families of the founders and there are at least three sets of people who use variations of the Moti Mahal trademark. So far, they have been content to serve Butter Chicken, saying that the dish was invented in Moti Mahal (which it was).  But now, there is a new battle between the descendants of Kundan Lal Gujral, who was the face of the original Moti Mahal, and the descendants of Kundan Lal Jaggi, who was one of the partners. Jaggis descendants say that Gujral looked after the front of the house but Jaggi was in the kitchen creating such dishes as Butter Chicken. Their own restaurant chain, Daryaganj, says it is run by the inventors of Butter Chicken, which makes Gujrals descendants see red because they dispute Jaggis role.  In the case of Butter Chicken, we know where it was invented and when. All that is in dispute is the identity of the man who thought it up.  But other dishes present their own mysteries. Take Chicken 65. We still dont know how it got its name. According to the Buhari restaurant in Chennai, which claims to have invented it, the dish went on the menu in 1965 and was called Chicken 65 after the year of its introduction. Well, may be. But Bangalore claims to have invented it, too. And there are other theories about its name: the chicken had to be 65 days old, it used 65 different spices, it was dish number 65 on the menu and so on.  Though there are no clear answers, we can be sure that the dish is a relatively recent invention (mid-1960s) and that it is not part of any culinary tradition: somebody just made it up.  Another southern favourite is Gobi Manchurian (though the name varies slightly depending on which state you are in). The dish is a variation on Chicken Manchurian, which was invented in Mumbai in the mid-seventies in response to customers who asked for spicy Chinese dishes. The invention is usually credited to restaurateur Nelson Wang, especially after he claimed the dish as his own in a show I did nearly two decades ago. But there are others who say that they, not Nelson, created it. And even Nelson did not, even in his worst nightmares, conceive of Gobi Manchurian.  So, lets give this authenticity thing a rest. Cuisines evolve. Dishes are created. Some are good. Some are terrible. But each dish finds its own market. And as time goes on, it begins to be regarded as authentic.

2021-12-26,https://www.newindianexpress.com/states/tamil-nadu/2021/dec/26/nature-an-experimentaltheatre-2399794.html,"Sreemathi M By  Express News Service  TIRUNELVELI: At Pappakudi, nearly 30km off Tirunelveli, you cant miss a lush green farm replete with man-made ponds and rain harvesting techniques, lying in close proximity to the Western Ghats. The part-owners of the 37-acre organic farm, a young husband-wife duo has toiled on the farm for five years, and transformed a completely barren land into a verdant valley.  For S Geetha Priyadharshini, a former IT geek in Bengaluru, the idea struck during her second pregnancy. It was because of the health problems I faced during my pregnancy, says the 38-year-old.  A native of Kovilpatti, Geetha gave birth to a stillborn baby before 2012, and subsequently, during her second pregnancy, her doctors had blamed consumption of contaminated rice for her health issues. Apparently, a long-term exposure to organophosphate insecticides leads to a higher risk of developing diabetes. It was during this hard time of recovery that Geetha along with her husband P Rajendran, who continues to work in an IT company in Bengaluru, decided to farm.  I resigned my job in Bengaluru when we decided to do organic farming. As I am a follower of Agasthiyar, a sage, we looked for land in the Western Ghats and bought this barren land. Other than seemai karuvelam and a few other random trees, the land had only three wells, dried and filled with garbage, Geetha smiles.  In 2016, the couple bought the land along with Geethas mother, sister, and a friend. But it was Geetha and Rajendran who spent an entire month removing the karuvelam before cleaning and desilting the wells, and reconstructing one small wall for a room for them to stay in when they visit.  After the clearance works, we wanted to conserve the water as the land was dry and we did not want to install a borewell initially. During the first rain spell, we observed the slope region where the water stagnates, and later, we dug a small farm pond to store it. We also dug something similar to a moat around our land to let the rainwater run past and recharge the groundwater, Geetha says.  Geetha Priyadharshini with family | special arrangement  While the process took time, the rainwater over two months that they saved up visibly nourished the land. The silt in the moat was also used for farming purposes, and native trees planted around the fence for the water to seep  beginning their journey into organic farming.With their continuous efforts, they expanded the pond and dug another two next to it. The soils colour began to change soon after due to water absorption. They further widened their farm by rearing fishes and feeding them farm livestock waste.What started as an experiment five years ago has borne fruits now.  For setting up the first pond, we spent one lakh rupees. The water in the pond recharged the three wells in the land, and over 17 acres, we planted tree saplings and paddy. After water conservation, we implemented integrated farming and mulched the land. Abutilon indicum, Leucas aspera, and crown flower are weeds that are grown and we ploughed these to increase the organic carbon content in the soil. At present, sun hemp, dhaincha, Giricidia sepium, Sesbania grandiflora, moringa for soil enrichment, friendly crop coconut with banana, amla with moringa and banana, Pongamia pinnata, bamboo, and subabul for biomass are raised on the farm in addition to the paddy cultivation, she says.  It was nothing short of an experimental laboratory for them.  We request young farmers to have patience and also persistence as farming is a responsibility. Each family should have a farmer so that the next generation would learn farming amid climate change and other environmental issues. Our daughter grew up on the farm with us since she was three years old.  The couple, residing in Hosur, manages the land all by themselves. Geetha works on the field often and travels to Pappakudi.  Tirunelveli Agriculture and Farmers Welfare Department Joint Director R Kajendrapandian said for water conservation, the department offers installation of farm ponds, check dams, and recharge shafts.  The department is also willing to help farmers by providing them with barren land. The department also provides for cleaning the fallow land, debris removal, and levelling the land to encourage farmers, he adds.  For the duo, whose grandparents are farmers, it is truly a journey back to the roots.","Nature, an experimental theatre",RICE

Senior leader of the Congress T. Jeevan Reddy has also questioned the Chief Minister on cultivating paddy in Rabi.

He thought she might want water, so he dug a pipeline into where she lay. He didnt want her to be wet, so as neighbours and relatives watched aghast, he held up white rice bags over the grave when it rained. It didnt matter that his 65-year-old mother died in February. To anyone that asked, or tried to stop him, he had one unbreakable, unchangeable justification. She was his mother.  There were times in these 10 months that he tried bringing her back from under the earth and began digging her grave. Each time, locals stepped in, preventing him from doing so. Until early on December 24, when he did.  Later that morning, people walking in the street in Kunnam village in Tamil Nadus Perambalur district found a strong, foul smell coming out of the 38-year-olds one-bedroom home. They made a call to the Tamil Nadu Police Control room to complain. By the time we reached the spot, the neighbours had gotten him out of the house but no one knew why there was a smell, said the investigating officer, who didnt wish to be named.  When the team entered the house, they found that he had locked his mothers body inside the one room, covered her using old sarees, and old banners. They removed the clothes gingerly, to find a pile of bones, the skin on them rotting away, almost non-existent. Even then, he protested. He didnt let us take her away and he kept wailing that she was his mother. We consoled him and only after his relatives brought him out of the house, could take her body out, the officer said.  Investigations since have revealed that the 65-year-old woman died in February this year of age-related complications -- 16 years after the death of her husband. For all that time, his mother was his only caretaker, and for the past decade, the 38-year-old was on medication for mental illness.  The man has never been employed, and since his mothers death, his sisters and their daughters, who live close by, have been giving him three meals a day, police officials said. Before her death, the mother worked as a farm labourer to provide for the two.  After recovering the body from the house, police officials on Sunday cremated her in a different cemetery in Perambalur after a post-mortem examination.  We didnt want to take her to the same place to burn her because he would continue going back. Even when we brought him to the station for an enquiry, he asked us where his mother is because he saw us taking her away, the officer said.  Ramesh Karuppaiya, a social activist in Perambalur, said that reports of the incident were being widely circulated on social media and might add to the stigma that the man is facing. The only bond that this man had was with his mother and he completely lacked any social support. There isnt a great deal of awareness of mental health problems, and no avenues for help. I fear he will be further stigmatised. The police should ensure that he gets continuous counselling and neuropsychiatric doctors are involved so that he is not marginalised further, Karuppaiya said.  A case under Section 174 (police to enquire and report on suicide) of the Code of Criminal Procedure has been filed, officials said. They, however, insisted that they would find mental health support for him. We are planning to file a petition in court to allow us to send him to Chennais Institute of Mental Health, a senior police official in the district said on condition of anonymity.

The menu brings me back to Basque Country, says Cerveceria La Tropical chef Cindy Hutson. The croquetas are amazingly creamy and crisp outside. The beet tartare is very balanced with acidity and flavor; I am not a vegan, but I order it every time we go. Alongside Mikel Goikoleas starters are a selection of entrees such as bacalao, or confit cod, and 50-day, dry-aged, bone-in rib-eye. The cocktails are inspired, with an emphasis on macerated gins in such flavors as basil and strawberry, with a choice of tonics.

Taking a dig at the ruling BJD, BJP MP Basant Panda said the State has been utterly neglected under the regional party's rule of over 22 years. For BJD, party interest has always remained above the state's interest, he added.  As if 22 years is not enough, the Chief Minister needs more time to build a new Odisha. This is an admission in itself by him of his failure to bring desired progress and development to the State, he said.  Reacting to the Chief Minister's commitment to the farmers, Panda said farmers are the most neglected by the BJD government. The government is yet to put up a flawless system to ensure minimum support price for paddy and the farming community is yet to get respite from exploitation of rice millers.  On the law and order situation in the state, the BJP leader said crimes against women have been steadily increasing as is evident from the recent murder case of school teacher Mamita Meher in Kalahandi district.  Instead of providing justice to Mamitas family, the Chief Minister prefers to protect to Minister of State for Home Dibya Shankar Mishra who had close links with the prime accused in the case, Gobinda Sahu, the MP said.",BJP MP Basant Panda slams CM Naveen Patnaik's 'new Odisha' call,RICE
2021-12-27,https://www.newindianexpress.com/states/odisha/2021/dec/27/paddy-purchase-slow-farmers-distraught-2400157.html,"By Express News Service  BHAWANIPATNA: A month after it started, kharif paddy procurement in Kalahandi district is moving at a snails pace due to a plethora of problems, leaving the farmers deeply worried. Delay in issue of tokens, artificial shortage of gunny bags and concern of millers over delivery of fortified rice kernels (FRK) are some of the reasons attributed to the tardy pace of procurement.  The administration started procurement in Kalahandi on November 25 through 207 purchasing centres of 74 PACS and 33 women SHGs. For the first phase, the Odisha State Civil Supplies Corporation Ltd (OSCSC) has set a target to lift 40.25 lakh quintal paddy in the district in the current kharif season. However, just over 12.70 lakh quintal of paddy has been procured so far. In the last kharif season, 68.40 lakh quintal paddy was procured in the district.  Sources said a large number of farmers are yet to get tokens and some have received partial ones. Farmer Rabi Mishra of Gumabahal village under Kalampur block said he harvested paddy a fortnight back. Of his 108 quintal paddy, he has received token to sell 70 quintal on February 22 in the first phase. There is uncertainty over sale of the balance quantity.  Similarly, Bibhuti Majhi of the same village is waiting for token to sell his surplus paddy of 260 quintal. Sources said the situation is similar across the district. Adding to the token misery is artificial shortage of gunny bags which has resulted in slow lifting of paddy from purchasing centres.  Reportedly, some millers are delaying lifting of paddy on the pretext of short production of gunny bags last year. As supply in the market is less, they are getting used gunny bags from Raipur in Chhattisgarh. However, sources in OSCSC said so far, the Corporation has supplied four lakh bales of gunny bags to millers and there should not be shortage of bags.  Another reason for slow procurement pace is the apprehension of millers that FCI may not purchase adequate quantity of rice. President of Kalahandi Rice Millers Association Nalini Patjoshi said FCI is asking for vitamin fortified boiled rice in which one per cent FRK supplied by the State government is mixed. However, FCI is rejecting a huge quantity of the rice on the ground of poor quality of FRK.  Patjoshi further said, in the current season, FCI has not yet taken delivery of rice. Since there is uncertainty of delivery of custom milled rice at FCI points, it is feared that the rice will deteriorate due to long duration of storage.  The association has already apprised the district administration about its concerns, he added. In such a situation, farmers who have received tokens are spending sleepless nights waiting for their turn at mandis. Those who are waiting for tokens have stacked their harvested paddy under the open sky in fields and guarding it by braving the severe cold conditions.

2021-12-27,https://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/chennai/2021/dec/27/104-not-out-2399977.html,"Kannalmozhi Kabilan By  Express News Service  CHENNAI: Nimal Raghavan is a busy man today. He has projects running in Thanjavur and Pudukottai. Along the Thamirabarani, he is managing works in Thoothukudi, Virudhunagar and Tirunelveli. In this part of the state, it is work thats being directly commissioned by the respective district collectors.  The Indian Army has sought his inputs for a project in Prayagraj; theres one coming up in Varanasi soon. For when you are in the business of restoring lakes, theres always another waiting to be brought back to life. In a few days, hell be conferred with the Best River Rejuvenator Award at the International River Congress 2021 in Kolkata. Life has come a long way since his trip back home from the world of software engineering was deeply shaken up by the Gaja cyclone and its painful aftermath.  None of this was something I planned to do or get into. After the Gaja cyclone, there was a need for relief work. Thats what I started with. Even then, I was thinking Id do this for a while and leave (return to Dubai where he had been working). But seeing the impact from this work was very encouraging. Each day was a lesson  and there the work was always interesting, challenging and it kept me very busy, he recounts.  Building a name  One of the first works he undertook post-cyclone was finding a solution for the lakhs of uprooted coconut trees and the many coconuts they had left behind. With timely help from a few individuals (particularly music director G V Prakash Kumar), Nimal and the farmers in the Delta region managed to sell the produce at a decent price and put the proceeds towards the recovery journey. It was this work that opened him up to the fact that farmers in these regions were turning away from rice and sugarcane cultivation more and more, primarily because they were heavily water-fed crops and the Cauvery had been too fickle in the years past.  Working with farmers associations there, he decided to go the lake restoration way towards water management. The way it was then, if Tank (eri) A filled up, B, C and D would follow suit and it would reach all the way till Z and then the water would reach the sea. Now, the water that comes from Grand Anicut (Kallanai) is reaching the sea directly because it has no connection to any of our water tanks. We have to send water to the sea but not at this volume. For example, four years ago, we had wasted nearly 200 TMC water to the sea. To put it in perspective, the annual water consumption in cities like Chennai and Bengaluru is 4-7 TMC; imagine the loss. This is what led me to the work of waterbody restoration, he shares.  Since then, his work has been robust. With timely support from private companies (Milky Mist and Exnora International provided them with an excavator  among other things  that reduced operational costs from Rs 2,000 a day to just Rs 500) and non-governmental organisations (like BiotaSoil Foundation and Kadaimadai Area Integrated Farmers Association), restoration progressed at a brisk pace. Soon enough, having heard of his success stories, people were reaching out to him instead of the other way around. By now, its down to a formula.  Normal lake restoration process requires us to desilt, build boundaries and re-establish the source channel. If theres seawater intrusion in a lake close to the shore, we need to put in a recharge bit after desiltation. The more water we put down in the ground (with the help of borewells), the more it will repel the sea water. Beyond this, we use native species like vettiver and thetran kottai to aid the effort. The latter is quite rare; of 100 hundred seeds planted, only one might come to life. With this method, we were able to remove salinity in a lake in Tirunelveli by 70 per cent, he explains.  Scandal and support  Now, 104 projects later, it is still the first undertaking  Peravurani Lake  that has helped him steer his work, stay true to the purpose. Peravurani got its name after the 564-acre lake. When we started the project, none of us had any experience with lakes. I had only worked on small lakes with others till then. But we decided to work on this and got all the required permits. We were told it would cost Rs 5-10 crores. This was when I had spent all my savings on Gaja relief work and was left with just Rs 20,000. After day one, we had one individual after another volunteer to donate for the cause; it spread like a forest fire. And it was not without controversies  some thought we were getting foreign funding, there was caste politics in it, it was election propaganda and more.  After 70 days of work, the then chief minister Edappadi released water (from Cauvery). On the seventh day or eighth, I get a call from the AE (PWD) that the lake will get water later that day. Seeing that water breakthrough the canal and enter the lake, was a moment of reckoning. Everything we had faced till then  I had left my job for this too  was inconsequential against this, he narrates.  All this would not have been possible without the local knowledge that was made available to him. The PWD has a major role in this. But we also consult the beneficiaries in each district and all of them turn out to be legends. Be it people in their 30s, 50s or those well over 70 and 80. How much ever we know about modern technology, each eri has its own behaviour and they would know better than what we can find from months of research and documentation. Like, we would think its enough to dig just three feet while desilting but they would know that only when you go for seven, the water wont break the bund and overflow. Such local knowledge has been vital, he observes.  Thooraangudi lake  These processes have also made him rethink their afforestation efforts. Random drives have invariably ended in the loss of plants, where eight out of ten fail to thrive; they either succumb to cattle or have no one left to maintain them. With the restoration projects, he started placing trees in the middle of the waterbody, with the sand that was dug being put back in to support the saplings. With a steady supply of water for six to eight months, and away from the mouths of hungry animals, these thrived. So far, the saplings planted are at 8.9 lakh; hes also managed to sow 2.8 lakh palm seeds in the process. Some trees grow as tall as 15-20 feet in just a year. The trees aid in rainwater harvesting within the lake. Besides, it brings in a number of birds. Enga ooruku flamingo ellam vanthuthu; half the birds that go to Udayamarthandapuram Bird Sanctuary began to stop by (Peravurani, Thanjavur). Bees, butterflies and sparrows too increased, he points out.  Motives and motivation  Its with all these success stories that he has managed to take the work to more and more districts. Only when they have seen proof of restoration elsewhere are they willing to risk their loss and try it. Then, no one stops with just one lake in their vicinity, he says. Besides, a bigger motivation for sustained maintenance has been the usual suspect  money. All the lectures you give or the before-after picture evidence does not matter. Only when you point out that they would have to spend on further restoration if they fail to keep this up, do they buck up and pay heed to what you have to say, he admits.  The gratitude that comes his way has been overwhelming too. He recalls the gesture from a 75-year-old farmer in Pudukkottai where he and his team brought water to a tank after 50 years of dryness. When I visited the place after seven months for an after picture, a thatha came to me with a manja pai. From inside it, he pulled out a plate and emptied all the wheat from a bag onto it. He told me that he, who hails from a huge agriculture family, had not been able to practice farming for 50 years. Not wanting to lose sight of the work, he had leased out a land 100 km away. He was hoping to return to his village for agriculture before his death. It was made possible by our work. The wheat he gave me would have given as an offering to god, he recollects.  With just six months of work, they have been able to restore groundwater level from over 500 feet to less than 100, changing the status quo of 40-50 years. What more encouragement do you need, he asks. Perhaps an excavator or two? Have a tank you need restored? Want to aid the effort? You can reach Nimal at +91 99622 00666.  Responsible to the surroundings  Random drives have invariably ended in the loss of plants, where eight of ten fail to thrive; they either succumb to cattle or have no one left to maintain them. With the restoration projects, Nimal started placing trees in the middle of the waterbody, with the sand that was dug being put back in to support the saplings. So far, the saplings planted are at 8.9L; hes also managed to sow 2.8L palm seeds in the process.","Restoring lakes: 104, not out",RICE

Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Sunday held talks with Sri Lankan Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa and discussed a host of issues, including promoting tourism, investments, and fight against the COVID-19 pandemic as the two countries marked the 65th anniversary of diplomatic ties.  Mr. Wang, who is also the State Councillor, arrived in Colombo on Saturday from the Maldives on a two-day visit during which he is scheduled to meet the countrys top leadership.  Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa took to Twitter to announce that he had a very pleasant meeting with Mr. Wang.  Had a very pleasant meeting with the Foreign Min of #China. Discussions centered around the logistics of facilitating the return of the many #lka med students to China. Also discussed were a host of issues inc Tourism, investments, #COVID19SL relief & post Covid preparedness, he said on Twitter.  Mahinda Rajapaksa also thanked the Chinese government for its continued support to Sri Lanka.  I thanked #China and her people for the continued support to #lka. As both our nations celebrate 65 years of bilateral relations, I am hopeful that this relationship we share will only grow & be strengthened in the years to come, he said in another tweet.  According to Foreign Secretary Jayanath Colombage, Foreign Minister Wang Yi will also meet President Gotabaya Rajapaksa and Foreign Minister G L Peiris during the visit.  His visit marks the 65th anniversary of diplomatic ties between the two nations and the 70th anniversary of the Lanka-China Rubber Rice Pact.  Signed in 1952, the Rubber-Rice Pact was a trade agreement between Lanka and China under which Colombo supplied rubber to Beijing in exchange for rice, leading to the establishment of diplomatic relations and expansion of trade between the two nations.  The events marking the occasions will be held at the Chinese-built port city in central Colombo, one of the many mega infrastructure development projects supported by China since 2010.  Foreign Secretary Colombage said that new Chinese investment opportunities might be sealed by Sri Lanka during the foreign ministers visit.  The relationship between the two countries has been under stress in the recent months.  China protested against Sri Lankas rejection of an organic fertiliser shipment which the local farmers and some experts claimed was contaminated.  The Sri Lankan commercial high court here blocked payment for it despite top level interventions by China. The Chinese black listed the Sri Lankan state bank for not honouring the payment.  Sri Lankan scientists had questioned the quality of the Chinese fertiliser consignment, saying that instead of helping, it could prove harmful to the crops.  However, on Friday, on the eve of Mr. Wangs visit, the Sri Lankas Peoples Bank released $6.9 million U.S. to the Chinese company.  Chinas blacklisting of the Sri Lankan bank and the public clash between officials on both sides had come amid growing concerns over an acute agriculture crisis in Sri Lanka, following President Gotabayas decision in May last year to abruptly switch from chemical to organic fertilisers.  The decision triggered protests from farmers who said the fertiliser ban would result in reduction in harvest, leading to a food crisis this year.  China in December suspended a project to install hybrid energy plants in three islands of Sri Lanka, citing security concern from a third party, amid reports of India raising concern over its location.  In early 2021, India lodged a strong protest with Lanka on the award of the tender to the Chinese company for the construction of renewable energy power plants in Delft, Nagadeepa and Analthivu.  Mr. Wangs visit is taking place at a time when Sri Lanka is facing its all-time worst foreign exchange crisis.  By December, the reserves position had plummeted to just one months imports or a little over $1 billion.  However, by the end of the year, the Central Bank announced that the reserves position had improved and the cash realisation was believed to have come from a previously agreed currency swap with China.","Chinese FM Wang Yi meets Sri Lanka PM Rajapaksa; discusses promoting investments, tourism",RICE
2022-01-11,https://indianexpress.com/article/world/famine-afghanistan-west-economy-7717413/,"Afghan farmer Abdul Qaher cannot remember a worse drought. Unable to feed his four children after losing his harvest, he took the drastic decision to sell his possessions and move to the western city of Herat to look for work.  Days later, on Aug 15, the Taliban seized power, triggering an economic meltdown that has tipped millions into poverty and made Afghanistan one of the worlds worst humanitarian crises.  Also Read | Iran offers to assist India in transporting aid to Afghanistan  As the harsh winter sets in, Qahers family are among nearly 9 million Afghans perilously close to famine. The children dont have warm clothes and its becoming very cold. Were afraid theyll get sick, he said.  The Talibans lightning takeover saw billions of dollars in Afghan assets frozen overseas. International funding, which had supported 75% of government spending, also dried up overnight. Banks ran short of cash, millions lost work or went unpaid, the local currency nosedived, while prices rocketed.  Hunger and destitution seem poised to kill more Afghans than all the bombs and bullets of the past two decades, the International Crisis Group (ICG) think-tank said, calling donors suspension of all but emergency aid the biggest culprit.  But finding a way to avert catastrophe is complicated by a slew of long-standing UN, US and other sanctions on the Islamist group, which remains a designated terrorist organisation.  In late December, the UN Security Council and the United States gave aid agencies a green light to scale up life-saving assistance without fear of breaking sanctions. But analysts said humanitarian aid was only a sticking plaster  liquidity must be injected into the economy to revive business, trade and livelihoods, and frozen money released to pay for crucial services.  This money is Afghans money, and these sanctions are hurting vulnerable people, Qaher told the Thomson Reuters Foundation on a video call from Herat.  Skipping Meals  Qaher is among 3.5 million Afghans displaced by drought and insecurity. His family share one room in a camp on the outskirts of Herat. There is no water or electricity and the temperature falls below freezing at night. The 45-year-old farmer regularly treks into Herat to find rubbish to burn so the family can cook rice and potatoes. He and his wife skip meals so their children can eat.  With a record 23 million people  more than half the population  struggling to eat, the UN World Food Programme (WFP) country representative Mary-Ellen McGroarty said Afghanistan faced a tsunami of hunger.  Farmers often move to look for jobs in lean times, but the economic crisis has scuppered other labour options. Its created a complete catastrophe. Its taken away Plan B, McGroarty said from the capital, Kabul.  Ive had women drop at my feet screaming for assistance. Ive met many men who are scavenging in bins for dry bread to feed their kids. When she travelled to the northern province of Badakhshan, elderly farmers who had lived through 19 governments told her they had never seen it so bad.  They told me they nearly preferred the war to the torture and torment of the hunger they were facing, she said. Malek, a 25-year-old farmer from western Afghanistan, used to supplement his income from growing chickpeas, wheat and cumin with casual labour  but nobody is hiring. He has started selling the few sheep he bought for breeding. Other Afghans are selling everything from motorbikes to jewelry and land. Some are marrying off young daughters for income.  Winter will be very, very difficult, said Malek, who only uses one name. Many people will have to sell assets to buy food. Many men in his region have gone to Iran. Malek was considering joining them, but recently received wheat seeds from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) which he hopes will help him stay put.  FAO country representative Richard Trenchard said he had never seen a crisis worsen so quickly and dramatically, adding that keeping farmers on their land was critical to stave off famine.  To put it bluntly, farmers dont die in their fields, they dont die with their herds. People die on the roads and in camps when theyve been forced to leave.  Dilemma  Ironically, aid workers access to vulnerable communities has rarely been better. With the end of fighting, the FAO can reach all 34 provinces, up from 25 in mid-2021.But aid agencies need money and resources. The WFP alone requires $2.6 billion for the coming year.  The FAO and WFP said the Taliban understood the massive need for aid and were allowing female staff to work, despite imposing restrictions on other women.  The Talibans victory marks the first time a sanctioned group has taken over a country, presenting the international community with a dilemma.  Also Read | Taliban arrest popular Afghan professor critical of govt  The United Nations, World Bank and donors are looking for ways to inject money into the economy without going through Taliban authorities. In December, the World Bank released some of the $1.5 billion sitting in the frozen Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund  the previous governments largest source of funding  to the WFP and UN childrens agency UNICEF.  The United Nations has also paid thousands of health worker salaries, bypassing the health ministry, and set up a trust fund to provide grants to small businesses and work for the unemployed on infrastructure projects.  But analysts say piecemeal fixes will not be enough to avert the countrys collapse. The ICG think-tank urged the international community to unfreeze assets, ease sanctions and engage with the Taliban to restore basic services including central banking.  Were preparing for the worlds biggest aid operation, but maintaining economic restrictions that are increasing the need for aid by the day. Its self-defeating, said ICG consultant Graeme Smith.","As famine stalks Afghanistan, West urged to rescue stricken economy",RICE

Its partly why she started her ready-to-eat packaged meals company, Triguni Eze Eats, at 69. Its why, at 80, she remains its managing director.  For over a decade, Daga has arrived at her Chennai factory at 10.30 am for inspection rounds, overseeing operations and occasionally conducting taste checks. She may have got into the game late, but this is the future of food, she says. For most of her life, Daga ran a garments factory focused on exports. Then, in 2009, she went to the US on holiday and saw a packet of dehydrated ready-to-eat pasta. She was excited to try it. I never did, she says. But the idea of just adding warm water and getting a piping hot meal stayed with her. The following year, she decided to use a spare room at her garments factory for some food experiments. She hired a chef who helped her create her first dehydrated meal: Cup-o-Idli. We tried different variations, but it was just never soft and fluffy enough to my taste, so I almost gave up, she says. As a last-ditch effort, they tried lemon rice, and this time it worked. The rice retained its texture; the flavour was authentic. They went on to try the same process with vegetable biryani and upma, which are now among their top-selling products.  As people get busier and travel more, they also end up missing home-cooked meals a little more. Thats where we come in, says Radha Daga, 80, managing director of Triguni Eze Eats.

The operation has expanded from a seven-person team in 2010 to about 100 employees today. The garment export was shut down and the factory space turned into a certified food plant by 2011.  In addition to retailing online, Eze Eats supplies in-flight meal kits to airlines IndiGo and AirAsia India and to certain Indian Railways services via the Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation (IRCTC). Eze Eats meal prep is now supervised by a team of head chefs and cooks (including the chef behind the original food experiments). They follow traditional recipes to ensure that the end product tastes like home. Each batch has to pass a taste test, Daga says. This is followed by a dehydration process and then the food is ready to package. The whole cycle takes 36 to 40 hours. An Eze Eats meal costs between 80 and 120 and has a shelf life of about six months. The bisibele bhath and moong dal khichdi are hot-selling items on our in-flight menus. Even as the pandemic set in we reached out to Eze Eats for crew meals because of the range of dishes and easy-to-eat and serve packaging, says Parnitha S, an in-flight catering management executive with AirAsia India. While its corporate clients make up its largest revenue stream, the companys newest customers, according to Dagas market research, tend to be college students and travellers who miss the taste of home. As people get busier and travel more, they also end up missing home-cooked meals a little more. Thats where we come in, she says.

Weve figured out ways to keep milk fresh for months, cook rice faster, and dehydrated mummys pav bhaji so itll last through lonely semesters abroad. Here are some of the processes behind the most common preserved foods.  Dehydration: Every culture in history has figured out that leaching moisture from a food item can make it last longer. This began as a way to preserve certain foods through ingredient-scarce winters or during long journeys. Sundried tomatoes, air-dried fruit and cured fish and meats all started out this way. Electric and microwave dryers use the same principle to create soup mixes, noodle garnishes, long-life spice and trail mixes. Some dehydrated foods, raisins for instance, can last years if properly dehydrated.  Spray-drying: Used most commonly for milk and coconut milk powder, it exposes the liquid to a blast of hot gas to quickly let the moisture (but not the fat) evaporate, leaving a fine-particle powder behind. Dried eggs, instant coffee, fruit juice and honey powders and flavourings are made in much the same way, and shelf lives range from weeks to years.  Freeze-drying: High-tech, but really simple. Food is frozen to a low temperature to turn its moisture into ice. The water is then sublimated, turning the ice directly into vapour that is sucked away. Whats left is room-temperature food that retains most of its nutrients, with taste, colour and shape intact too. Most freeze-dried foods can last years. This method is most commonly used for fresh fruit and vegetables, and pet food.  Flash-freezing: As the name suggests, fresh food, fish or meat is put into an air- or brine-based freezer. Commercial versions do the freezing in as little as two minutes. Speed is essential; it prevents the food from forming ice crystals that might break down its cellular structure, compromising on flavour and texture, and drying it out. Most flash-freezing is done immediately after harvest, yielding foods that are fresher than the ones sitting on supermarket shelves.  Reconstituted food: These are the dried foods that you just add water to to revive. Think of preserved mushrooms, instant oats, noodles. Potato reconstitutes well too  its what makes mashed-potato mixes and instant-aloo-sabzi kits so popular in fast-food kitchens. Most packages last 18 months.  Irradiation: This no-heat process can kill bacteria, mold and pests that would have made fresh meats and farm produce rot faster. The World Health Organization and Food and Agriculture Organization have declared it to be safe. But there arent enough studies on the long-term effect of this ionising method on humans, so several countries, particularly those in the European Union, prohibit its use.  Retort: The tech was developed in the US to feed astronauts during long spells in space. Theres no heat, no chemicals, no exposure to gas, just filtered water and extreme pressure. Cooked food is sealed in flexible, multilayer pouches and sterilised under pressure (in a process called Pascalization) to destroy microorganisms but retain nutrients. Food in these pouches can last more than a year at room temperature. It started out being better suited for Western food  oils and spices dont take well to the process. But recipes for biryani and curries have since been developed, allowing for more diversity.  Modified atmosphere: Another way to preserve food is to replace or deplete the oxygen around it. Oxygen helps microbes grow; in preservation, the less of it there is, the better. This is why salad greens are often packed with dry ice at the bottom, slowly increasing carbon dioxide levels in the container. Its why food is vacuum-packed. And why potato-chip packets are inflated with nitrogen.  Ultra-Pasteurisation: Sure, boiling milk makes it last longer. But new dairy processes take it a step further. They boil milk to 137 Celsius for just a few seconds and then rapidly cool it, which kills more bacteria. This, along with sterile packaging, creates long-life milk, which can last six months outside a refrigerator, unopened.",That’s a mouthful!: A look at the science behind quick meals,RICE
2022-01-15,https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/art-culture/quite-a-stir-a-look-at-the-2-minute-revolution-as-maggi-turns-40-in-india-101642249764010.html,"Who knew it would take just two minutes to start a revolution? The Maggi brand of quick-cooking noodles was test-launched in India in January 1982, in what many would call a simpler time. Namak Halal and Disco Dancer were filling up single-screen cinemas. Cassette-tapes played Bappi Lahiri and ghazals. There was only one kind of car. TVs, for those who could afford them, beamed Doordarshan in black and white. The economy was still closed. The first McDonalds wouldnt open for another 14 years. The company itself was called Food Specialties Limited; it wouldnt be renamed Nestl India until 1989.  The 2-Minute Noodles were launched in Delhi in January, and in Calcutta, Bombay and Madras over the following months. India took to the idea quickly -- and never let go. Data from the World Instant Noodles Association, a 25-year-old organisation that supports the industry, indicates that India ranks fourth in global demand for instant noodles. We polished off 6.73 billion servings in 2020, putting us just behind China, Indonesia and Vietnam. Not bad for a nation with no tradition of noodle-making. Instant noodles have fuelled kiddie parties, late-night study sessions, hiking groups and first-time cooks. The Maggi 2-Minute Noodles legacy, however, is far greater. Its the idea that you only have to put something in hot water, and it will be ready to eat; that a single package can have everything you need, says food writer and researcher Shirin Mehrotra. That option had existed before; packaged meal kits by Gits were a two whole decades older. But perhaps ahead of their time. By the 1980s, Gits idli and rasgulla mixes were being sold mainly to NRIs. (Read the interview alongside to see how this has changed.)  Early on, Maggi decided to target post-school snack time for children. It did this through ads and initiatives such as Maggi Club rewards, which invited children to send in empty wrappers in exchange for free gifts.  Maggis marketing blitzkrieg and its well-customised spicy-tangy flavour made noodles seem like the quick, nutritious choice of a good homemaker. By 1987 the brand was raking in 11 crore a year from this one product alone.  What followed was instant everything: masala oats and poha, dosa batter, frozen butter-chicken paste, heat-and-eat dal makhani, eight-minute prawn biryani, quick-cooking kheer. A 2020 study by the management consulting firm RedSeer indicates that the ready-to-cook (RTC) market in India, which stood at 2,100 crore in 2019, will grow to 4,800 crore by 2024. Maggi gave Indians a taste not just for noodles, but for convenience itself. THE TASTEMAKER Sangeeta Talwar joined the company as a trainee in 1979 and was working on Maggis flavour cubes when the company decided to launch quick-cooking noodles in India in 1982. Why noodles? It was a typical multinational company taking a broad strategic view, she recalls. Nestl wanted to sell more than coffee and infant formula. Malaysia had responded well to packaged noodles. They wanted to give it a shot. Talwars team had to get rice- and roti-eating middle-class Indians to warm up to an east-Asian staple theyd never considered before. Researchers went into homes and kitchens across the country, sharing meals with families, to find just the right slot in this market. Breakfast was rushed, the research team found. Meals were about traditional food. But snack-time was fun. There was no quick-cooking option for when kids returned from school, Talwar says. Mothers easily responded to the idea of whipping up a snack for a hungry child. Kids were more open to trying something new. And the grownups would ultimately try it too. At just over 2 for a 100gm packet, it was decided that the noodles would be aimed at children. The product wouldnt be called instant noodles as in the East. The term 2-Minute Noodles underlined just how easy they would be to make. Across TV spots, print ads and radio jingles, in Hindi, Bengali and Tamil, Mom remained central to the advertising, smiling as she added veggies and indulged her child. Talwar worked at Nestl India until 2000, serving as marketing director and executive vice-president. Among the brands early challenges, she says, was that it was the first to be sold in a flexible plastic packet; most food products then came a tin or jar. How to avoid rats and make it visible in kirana stores was the question, she says. Their answer: Hanging baskets in which the packets were stocked with the red Maggi logo facing outward for instant visibility. Talwar recalls climbing rickety stools, showing vendors how to get the now-familiar display right. Maggi also reached out to school kids with school quizzes. A loyalty club rewarded children with puzzle-filled booklets in exchange for empty wrappers.  Fazlani Foods, launched in 2015, is aimed at time-strapped young people open to new recipes.  All of it catapulted Maggi to what it eventually became, says Talwar, who has written about her experiences in The Two-Minute Revolution (2018; Penguin). Its popularity even helped the brand withstand a six-month ban in 2015, after allegations that it contained excess amounts of lead and monosodium glutamate. By 2019, it was making more money than before the ban.  RECIPE CONTEST For newer entrants, this remains a complicated market, and now an increasingly crowded one too. Indians are familiar with the convenience concept, but they overwhelmingly prefer Indian food. Several brands offer the same range of products: biryani, chole, dal makhani (hard to make from scratch at home), and Indian sweets (even harder). Old recipes for success are being adapted, or at least set on a slow boil. Fazlani Foods, launched in 2015, offers heat-and-eat Indian curries, rice dishes, tray meals, pastes and accompaniments. The brand was also among the first to offer a range of hummus with a shelf life of 12 months. The market is yet to adapt widely to completely cooked packaged food, because we still appreciate home cooking, says managing director Iqbal Fazlani. Shoppers abroad are far more likely to stock packaged meals and foods at home. Here it is not yet part of the regular grocery-buying cycle. So Fazlanis domestic sales are typically for semi-cooked simmer sauces, cooking pastes and condiments. The heat-and-eat products work well in foreign markets. In bigger Indian cities, where time is at even more of a premium, theres competition from food-delivery services too. Why heat up a curry paste, or microwave a pouch of biryani, when you can order a freshly made meal instead? Our focus is to be easy and interesting, Fazlani says. We are focusing on Gen Z and millennials who are tech- savvy and open to experimenting with new foods, fusion etc. The holy grail for most brands hoping to make it big? A flavour profile that appeals across Indias diverse markets. Could there be a dal that all of India calls its own? Can a vacuum-packed Andhra curry find mass appeal? Can all of India be unified by a single dish the way it has been with Maggi? Shirin Mehrotra believes the enduring appeal of Maggi noodles lies in their simplicity: The snack has become an ingredient in itself. Hip restaurant chains like Farzi Caf served it with truffle oil and foie gras in 2014. Ahmedabads street vendors deep-fry the cooked noodles with veggies to create pakoras. Every so often, a street stall will douse Maggi noodles with Fanta (Ghaziabad) or Rooh Afza (Delhi) for a burst of viral fame. Perhaps the next revolution may take longer than two minutes. We Indians are conventional, says Fazlani. We have a knack for borrowing the cuisine of another region and blending it with ours to create a unique style of food. We have seen this happen to Chinese and Italian food. Who knows whats next in line?

2022-01-16,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/an-indians-tale-of-xians-lockdown-makes-headlines-in-china/article38274916.ece,"Restaurateur and martial artiste Dev Raturis upbeat videos of life in lockdown have been very popular  Dev Raturi has not stepped out of his apartment for eight days. He could not do so even if he wished to  a white tape has been stuck outside his door to seal him inside, along with his wife and two young children. As of Saturday evening, he hasnt been told when he can leave.  Mr. Raturi is one of millions of residents who have been confined to their homes in Xian, the provincial capital of northwestern Shaanxi and the city famed for the terracotta warriors.  Xians residents were initially confined to their apartment blocks in a lockdown starting December 23, allowed only to pick up deliveries and groceries without leaving their compounds. But with COVID-19 cases crossing 2,000 in a month  the highest of anywhere in China since the start of the pandemic in Wuhan  many of the citys 13 million residents have been made to stay at home.  On Saturday, Xian reported only four cases, suggesting the lockdown is working. However, the stringent measures, the first for any city in China since the initial Wuhan lockdown for 76 days in early 2020, have invoked comparisons of the darkest chapter in the early days of Wuhan.  When a Xian hospital recently turned away a pregnant woman who then suffered a miscarriage, a national outcry prompted an unusual apology from Chinas Vice-Premier Sun Chunlan who said she was ashamed. Hospital officials were sacked.  Other residents, in the first days of the lockdown, complained of food shortages.  Of course, it has been difficult, Mr. Raturi tells The Hindu in a video interview, showing his apartments sealed door. But I know it also hasnt been easy for the volunteers here who bring us vegetables, rice, food, oil, every day, who are doing what they can.  Dev Raturi with Chinese stars Zhang Xinyu and Hu Yitian on the set of the television drama Checkmate. Photo: Special Arrangement  Mr. Raturis family is in one of Xians worst-hit districts. Born in Uttarakhand, he moved to China 17 years ago and started working as a waiter. Inspired by martial artist Bruce Lee, Mr. Raturi trained in New Delhi but was unable to break into the film industry in Mumbai. When he was given the chance to go to China to work in a restaurant, he thought it was destiny. Thats how Bruce Lee started  in a restaurant, he said. So he packed his bags.  Today, he owns five restaurants in Xian and also works in film, and has gained fame for his roles in a number of Chinese television dramas and movies, having acted in more than 20. Most were bit-part roles, but the success in 2020 of the serial My Roommate is a Detective brought him wider recognition.  Over the past month, his video interviews from his home have been watched by millions of viewers in China, partly because hes not only a foreigner but one known to many, and partly because of his upbeat spirit as he provided an on-the-ground picture of the current COVID-19 ground zero.  In the first few days after the December 23 lockdown, Mr. Raturi said, there were reports of some apartment blocks struggling to get access to food.  They were not prepared for such a situation, he said, but added that once users began complaining on social media, authorities sprung into action. They made mistakes, but they learnt from them, he said, pointing out that the day after social media posts complained of shortages, every family in his block was delivered a box of free vegetables, rice and oil.  But for many in China, the reports of hardships in Xian and the stringency of the measures triggered a debate on the countrys zero-COVID strategy, that calls for mass testing and lockdowns until cases are brought to zero.  The dysfunction in Xian, columnist Wang Xiangwei wrote in the South China Morning Post on Saturday, exposed the dark side of Chinas top-down governing approach. The Communist Partys leadership now demands absolute loyalty from its over 90 million party members, and they are required to carry out instructions to the letter. This has led to lethargy at all levels of the Chinese bureaucracy, in which lower-ranking officials will only do what their superiors ask for, leaving very little room for different opinions and flexibility.  Responding to that criticism is also why the official media has given Mr. Raturis videos such currency, part of a recent trend of using foreigners to rebut criticism. Chinese state media recently promoted videos of foreigners travelling in Xinjiang to respond to criticism over its internment camps there. Most were Western expats in China, but among the videos shared by Chinese social media was one by a Mandarin-speaking Indian YouTuber in New Delhi who was praised for going to an outlet of retailer H&M in the Indian capital and criticising it for not using Xinjiang cotton.  Mr. Raturi said he was aware of this trend but said his aim was simple  to speak straightforward whatever I see, good or bad. In interviews with Chinese media, he called for a more balanced approach and said lockdowns could not be permanent.  With Xian in the news, Mr. Raturi said he received worried phone calls from relatives in India, as he did two years ago when Wuhan locked down.  I never regretted not leaving in 2020 when every one told me to leave China, he said, noting that for the past 18 months, his children were able to go to school and they had largely lived in normalcy.  More than that, he added, my work here is not finished.  I want fill the cultural gap because there are misunderstandings on both sides, he said, referring to friends in India who were sending him crazy articles saying millions were starving to death in Xian and those in China who would send him only bad news about India.  His next mission is to open this year Chinas first Indian-themed boutique hotel in Xian. He is also opening a yoga space and plans to reopen his restaurants in half a dozen cities outside Xian that had been temporarily shuttered because his employees all left for India when the pandemic hit and have been unable to return because of Chinas continuing travel bans.  Permanent lockdowns are not the solution, Mr. Raturi said. My hope is they find a better balance.  Until then, his apartment doors, not to mention Chinas doors to the world, will remain firmly shut.",An Indian’s tale of Xian’s lockdown makes headlines in China,RICE

Local people have been demanding distribution of boiled rice under the PDS for long.  Mr. Poojary who held a video conference with the senior officials of the State Department of Food and Civil Supplies in Udupi on Friday, said that a majority of local farmers have now sold the local varieties of paddy to private parties. Hence there is a need to purchase such varieties from other districts in the State.The Social Welfare Minister said that the same varieties can be procured from Shivamogga, Mandya, and Mysuru districts with the permission from the Union government.  Mr. Poojary said that all arrangements should be made to procure the local paddy varieties from local farmers, stock them and process them as boiled rice in the coming days. The officials should also have proper data relating to supply and demand.  If the local paddy varieties are purchased for distribution under the PDS more farmers who have left their land fallow can come forward to resume paddy cultivation on such lands, he said.",‘Seek Centre’s nod to procure local paddy from districts’,RICE

Soon after, just like in several other jallikattu events, the famed bull Agni Karuppu would approach the vadivasal  the entry point from where the raging beasts enter the ground where participants, hearts pounding, wait to subdue them in an ostentatious display of might and bravery.  Sindhamani herself is no ordinary bull owner at the much-anticipated event. Having braved a great deal of taunts and snide comments before she was able to make a name for herself in the sport, the 30-year-old transwomans voice brims with pride when she says the Alanganallur jallikattu is a world-famous bull-taming competition where, this year, she will let her bulls  9-year-old Agni Karuppu and 4-year-old Pandi Muni  out in the arena on Monday.  Of the three Jallikattu events, the one at Alanganallur is the most well-known and boasts of participation by celebrated tamers and bulls belonging to VIPs (Courtesy: Karthik Selvam) Of the three Jallikattu events, the one at Alanganallur is the most well-known and boasts of participation by celebrated tamers and bulls belonging to VIPs (Courtesy: Karthik Selvam)  Spread over three days, the pageantry is currently taking place in the states cultural capital of Madurai as part of celebrations revolving around the harvest festival Mattu Pongal. While the jallikattu in Avaniyapuram and Palamedu took place on January 14 and 15, respectively, the one at Alanganallur, originally scheduled for January 16, was postponed by a day due to the total lockdown imposed in the state in the wake of the surge in Covid cases.  Of the three events, the one at Alanganallur is the most well-known and boasts of participation by celebrated tamers and bulls belonging to VIPs. Testifying to its popularity, there is also a foreigners gallery exclusively reserved for international visitors who arrive in the hopes of partaking in the adrenaline rush of it all.  Over the last seven years, I have received most of the honours that a jallikattu bull owner can hope to win. My bulls Agni Karuppu, Ramu and Pandi Muni have accorded me the respect I deserve in this society. Im not saying that the journey from being a homeless person to what I am today was easy. I was harassed and humiliated at the Palamedu jallikattu seven years ago when I entered the vadivasal with my bull for the first time. I was on the edge. People never know of the hurdles we face to earn a decent life and respect. But all my worries were washed away when my bull remained untamed in that jallikattu. Its not all about the prize money or the gifts they provide. Its all about respect, Sindhamani asserts over the phone call.  Participants at the Alanganallur Jallikatu entering the area. (Courtesy: Karthik Selvam) Participants at the Alanganallur Jallikatu entering the area. (Courtesy: Karthik Selvam)  Madurai resident Karthik says every family in Alanganallur village is into the sport. Each house in the village has one or two jallikattu bulls. At the Avaniyapuram and Palamedu events, the bulls are directly let out from the vadivasal to the ground. The game is very quick in terms of duration. At Alangallur, the bulls have to walk through a small corridor by themselves to enter the vadivasal. It gives more time to the bulls and tamers. The bulls stay on the ground and make the play longer. The prize amount is also high because bulls belonging to VIPs, including ministers, top politicians and officers, participate in the Alanganallur jallikattu, he describes with enthusiasm.  The newfound respect she has earned has hardly made Sindhamani forget her past. When I was forced to leave my house in Kallanai, I had no idea about my future or where I was going to live. I met other transwomen in Madurai and started to beg for a living. People often yelled at me, asking, You are not handicapped, why are you begging for alms?. I felt terrible and resolved to raise jallikattu bulls as I had grown up watching the immense social pride that a jallikattu bull can bring to its owner. I stopped begging, worked as a construction labourer for three years and saved enough money to buy my first calf. This is how my journey to empowerment began, says the youth, an unmistakable tenacity in her voice.  Speaking to The Indian Express, she laments how the pandemic has changed the competition, cutting down on much of the excitement. The loud whistles, zesty applause and deafening cheers from the spectators have been absent in the jallikattu events in 2021 and 2022. This applause is the acceptance we seek It takes four persons to let out each bull into the vadivasal. But now, guidelines mandate that only two can be present there, which makes it an onerous task to manage the huge creature while letting it out, she elaborates.  Preparing the bulls for the traditional sporting event is an arduous mission which begins months in advance. Starting with walking practice, the beasts undergo rigorous training, including earth goring and swimming in the wee hours of dawn. Much like that of professional athletes, their diet is also monitored strictly. Three months ahead of the competition, the bull raisers feed the animals a generous mix of cottonseed, raw rice and coconut for an extra boost of nourishment along with meals of broken black gram, wheat and toor dal bran for added stamina.  As if training the bulls wasnt enough of a challenge, Sindhamani also had to ward off distasteful remarks and queries from anyone she crossed paths with. Why are trans people here? What are you going to do in the vadivasal? You are not capable of such competitions, and several more filthy comments were directed at me at my first competition. Before me, many transwomen have raised bulls in regions across Tamil Nadu, but they were not ready to release the bulls at the vadivasal out of fear and wary of such comments. But things are changing. Today, at the Alanganallur jallikattu, a total of six transwomen will let the bulls out into the arena. In Madurai alone, 10 more transwomen have quit begging and have started to raise jallikattu bulls, she said, adding in hope: We need to change from within ourselves. Im hoping my story will help bring about a paradigm shift in how common people view transgenders.",‘It’s all about respect’: A transwoman’s journey to empowerment through Jallikattu,RICE
2022-01-17,https://www.newindianexpress.com/states/andhra-pradesh/2022/jan/17/now-age-test-to-ensure-rice-quality-2407657.html,"Sistla Dakshina Murthy By  Express News Service  VIJAYAWADA: The Civil Supplies Department has come up with an initiative of conducting an age test on the grain to check the malpractice of mixing old rice with fresh stock. The process was implemented on a pilot basis by the department in the last two seasons.  Recently, the Union Ministry of Food, Public Distribution and Consumer Affairs approved the adoption of the policy across the country. Orders were also issued to conduct age tests on the grain before transporting it to the godowns in other parts of the country.  Civil Supplies Corporation Director G Veerapandian said at several places, the middle men were shifting the subsidised rice to the black market and making money out of it. Some rice millers are also purchasing subsidised rice and sending it to the civil supplies and FCI godowns after polishing it. As the rice is stored for a long time, the adulterated rice is getting spoiled very fast. Taking a serious note of the matter, the state government introduced an age test on the grain last season.  Veerapandian said after procuring grains from the farmers, rice will be made at the mills and later the grains will be stored in the godowns. Before that, the department is conducting quality tests at the godowns. As many as 580 bags (29 tonnes) will be considered as a lot and samples are collected in the presence of millers. If the grains turned green or light green during the testing, they are considered fresh. The load will be sent back to the millers if the grains fail the age test.  Veerapandian said methyl red, brothymol blue and ethyl alcohol are mixed with water for preparing a special solvent used for testing. Then 10 ml of the special solvent is mixed with the sample rice in a test tube. After a minute, if the grains turned into green it is considered fresh. If it turns light green, the grains are milled one to two months ago, if it turns yellow colour, the grains age is three months and if it turns orange, the grains age is four to five months.  After milling the grains, artificial intelligence will be used to determine colour and moisture content. The value of this machine is around `13 lakh.

On some days, it is all her family, and the others who have joined the queue, will eat for the day.  ""If I don't bring bread from here, we will go to bed hungry,"" mother of two Muhajira Amanallah told AFP on Tuesday.  ""I even thought of selling my daughters, but I backed down and relied on God alone.""  Afghanistan is in the grip of a humanitarian disaster, worsened by the Taliban takeover in August -- when Western countries froze international aid and access to assets held abroad.  Jobs have dried up and many government workers have not been paid for months in the country, which was almost entirely dependent on foreign donations under the previous US-backed government.  The United Nations has warned that half the country is threatened with food shortages.  The bread distribution launched on Saturday is part of the Save Afghans From Hunger campaign organised by a Kabul university professor.  At least 75 families in seven districts of the capital, currently blanketed in snow, will receive daily naan rations for a month.  In the queue, Nouriya stands alongside five other women, all in the blue burqa that the Taliban encourages women in the country to wear.  After the death of her husband she got handouts from friends, but that has ended.  ""We eat rice or soup made with carrots and turnips... and we put pieces of bread in it instead of meat,"" said Nouriya, a mother of five.  While men and women wait for their share of bread, children play, some wearing tattered shoes too big for them.  As the last person left the bakery, owner Makram El-Din said: ""People have lost their jobs, and they no longer have any income. We used to use four sacks of flour a day, now we only use one and a half.""",Desperate Afghans queue for free bread as poverty crisis deepens,RICE

Experiences like these and more await tourists planning to visit Kerala. Taking a cue from its successful Agri Tourism Networking project, the State Responsible Tourism (RT) Mission is planning to tap Keralas local tourism potential to woo visitors in the post-Covid scenario. The RT Mission has chalked out a detailed plan to attract tourists to the state to heal the pandemic-ravaged sector.  Our packages give thrust on identifying and experiencing the exclusivity of Kerala. We also need to exploit the possibilities of the new normal that has developed in the tourism sector post Covid outbreak, said RT Mission state coordinator Roopesh Kumar K.  The mission aims to highlight products, agriculture practices, rituals, cuisines and other aspects unique to each locality. For instance, tourists will be taken to villages to see how Marayoor jaggery is made in a cauldron, or to fields to learn about a unique rice variety or agricultural practice and interact with farmers. If it is an artform, the artist or guide will explain its unique characteristics and tourists can watch it live too. Tourists would also get a chance to try their hand at making the products.  Besides offering tourism packages that weave together Keralas unique identities from Kasaragod to Thiruvananthapuram, we are also creating a network of all such products and practices. The packages are designed to protect artists, farmers and places too. We will formally announce the packages by February 20, said Roopesh.  RT Mission authorities said the response from artists, farmers and others in the initial stage of the project announcement has been tremendous. As many as 160 persons, including artists, farmers and others have already registered for it. Some families, groups, institutions, temples where unique rituals like theyyam and sarpam thullal are practised regularly have also come forward, said an official.  Many are unaware that Kerala has 400 types of theyyams. The new generation is not even familiar with rituals such as sarpam thullal and kalamezhuthum pattum. Besides promoting tourism, we also aim to conserve our traditions, said the official.  Roopesh said they know that restoring normalcy in tourism sector would take a long time. We need to shift from conventional practices and focus on village tourism. We cant move ahead without product and market diversification, he said.  The new initiative is part of the Tourism departments plans to focus on micro-level tourism. Those willing to join the initiative can register until January 30 by emailing to rt@keralatourism.org or calling 04712334749.","Dwarf cow milk to temple artforms, Kerala treat awaits global visitors",RICE

These are the varieties largely consumed in Bengals towns and cities. Traders say the price could rise further due to high demand for the long-grain Bengal variety in Bangladesh and other countries in the region.State government agri-adviser Pradeep Mazumdar , though, allayed such fears, saying the prices could actually stabilise and even go down once the Boro crop is harvested. All these long-grain rice varieties are products of Boro season. The seeds have just been sown and we are expecting a good crop. The prices should come down, he claimed.But rice traders said while both the Centre and state have procured record quantities of rice at higher MSP in 2020-21, sowing was just 40% compared to 2019-20, leaving a deficit in production.",WB: Rice rates soar in local markets on high exports,RICE

The students have not received the ration money in their bank accounts for the two summer vacation months in 2021.Nearly one crore students from Std I to VIII in the state get a free freshly cooked meal for lunch every school day as part of the national scheme now called Pradhan Mantri Poshan Shakti Nirman. In the state, the meal includes khichdi made from rice and dal. But when the pandemic shut down schools, the state government decided to offer them take-home ration of grain and pulses.Before the start of this academic year, the state government floated a tendering process to choose suppliers for distributing dry ration in rural areas. Self-help groups operating central kitchens were to be given the order to distribute dry ration in urban areas.School education minister Varsha Gaikwad , accepting that there has been an inordinate delay in giving out dry ration to the students, said the orders for more than 20 districts are almost final and the grain and pulses will be distributed within 10 days. The minister said court cases had disrupted the distribution process.Gaikwad said, ""The tender for the academic year 2021-22 was floated last March. However, some vendors from five districts challenged us in the Nagpur bench of the Bombay high court and the court ordered a stay on the entire process. It was lifted only on September 25 last year, after which we resumed the tendering. We received 180 applications which have been scrutinized and samples have been sent to the government laboratories. All this has taken some time and the Covid-19 situation further increased the delay.""A senior government official said the work order for 22 districts has been finalized and distribution will start within the next 8-10 days.The remaining eight districts will get it by next month, but the five districts will face more delay as the case is sub judice.Mahesh Palkar, in-charge of the primary education directorate, said, ""We had told all students to open a bank account and link it to their Aadhaar, but not all have done so. We have forwarded the money to the blocks and it will be transferred to the students' accounts.""The association of primary teachers said distribution of dry ration has been shoddy since the last academic year and students did not receive any for almost the whole year.Vijay Kombe, general secretary of Maharashtra State Primary Teachers Association from Wardha, said, ""Teachers were told to distribute the entire year's ration in March-April. The same situation is unfolding now. Rice and pulses, if given on time, will give some nutrition to the child in rural areas even if schools are closed.""A senior government official dealing with the scheme said, ""For the summer vacation of 47 days in April-May-June, funds have been allocated and soon rural students will get it in their accounts. This process has not been possible in urban areas. Court cases against the process led to the delay which is expected to be addressed by next month.""The official added that for 42 working days in June and July, rural students were given dry ration.In the urban areas, there has been no such distribution in this academic year, so far.Mahendra Ganpule, spokesperson for Maharashtra Schools Headmasters' Forum said the midday meal was a huge draw for rural students. ""School hours have been reduced in the pandemic, and cooking and eating in a group is best avoided.Hence, the scheme has been revised to a take-home ration.

2022-01-19,https://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/kochi/2022/jan/19/bleak-future-ahead-for-kochi-thanks-to-global-warming-2408430.html,"James Jacob By  Express News Service  KOCHI:  Will Kochi be the same in another hundred years? The short answer is no.  Thanks to climate change, the Kochi-Vembanadu belt may become less hospitable in another hundred years. Rising sea levels, extreme rainfall events and intense tidal flooding can have undesirable consequences for this economically and strategically important and ecologically sensitive region.  As a consequence of the accelerated warming of oceans and thawing of arctic glaciers, sea level has been rising at an increasing rate worldwide. The reports by Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change [IPCC] indicate that the port city of Kochi will see a significant rise in sea level in the coming decades, submerging large swathes of low lying areas. IPCC predicts that tidal flooding will become particularly severe in the tropics. Such a phenomenon may be already unfolding in the Kochi-Vembanadu region, aggravated by changes in the rainfall pattern.  Tidal flooding in Kochi  The highest tide occurring in this region, known as Vrischika Veliyettam, sets in during the first half of December every year. During December, the tidal flooding was extensive and prolonged in the region and climate change appears to have had a subtle but decisive role in this.  Recent years have seen an increasing share of the annual rainfall, with heavy rain arriving towards the fag end of the monsoon season. Thus, recent major floods/landslides happened during August-October, which historically used to be a lean rainy season in Kerala. Central Kerala received heavy rains in November and early December. For instance, Kottayam, situated on the eastern edge of Vembanadu, received 4,044 mm rainfall last year. Of which 555 mm or 13.7% in November and December. Normally, these two months get only 217 mm or 7.8% of the total annual rainfall. Compared to the long-term average, Kottayam received 44% more rainfall last year and November and December saw a whopping 156% increase compared to the long-term average for the two months.  Since the lake had abundant water following the heavy rain, the Vrichika Veliyettam was particularly bad in the belt last year. Rising sea levels also could have contributed to this. Seawater even reached into the low lying interiors flooding homes and streets. It took several days for the tidal water to recede.  Vembanadu Wetland Ecosystem  Six major rivers originating from the Western Ghats empty into this Ramsar site. It plays a crucial role in regulating water flow from the hills and plains into the Arabian sea and helps control floods in the region. The rising sea level in Kochi can slow water discharge into the lake, thereby aggravating the flooding of the rivers. Due to incessant rains and landslides in Koottikkal, in October, there were unprecedented floods in towns like Mundakkayam and Kanjirappally.  Closing the shutters of Thanneermukkam bund in summer (to save rice fields of Kuttanadu from seawater inundation) and opening them in the rainy season (to avoid floods in Kuttanadu) have the unintended consequence of intensifying tidal flooding in the Kochi-Vembandau belt. Taking cognisance of the recent weather-related disasters and predictions of IPCC, it is likely that the worst is yet to come. The unique physiography and demography of the region will make things even more difficult.  The complex nexus between increasing frequency of rainfall, fluvial floods, rising sea levels, and likely reduction in the effective volume of Vembanadu lake and how this will influence tidal flooding in Kochi in future are poorly understood. This knowledge is needed to evolve sustainable mitigation strategies that go beyond opening relief camps and distributing free provisions when disasters strike.  The rivers are now drying up fast. Water levels in wells and ponds are declining as day temperatures are shooting up, promising Keralites another severe summer ahead. It is ironic that as a result of the pernicious effects of climate change, people of Gods own country have to live in perpetual fear, come rain or shine.

Extracted from the outer layer or chaff of the rR crop, rice bran oil is a product of many benefits.  This slight yellowish oil, dark oil is commonly used, and even often recommended by nutritionists (in moderation), owing to its rich source of antioxidants, vitamins, anti-inflammatory properties.  ""The oil has been provided the status of Heart oil in Japan and a Healthy food in the West. A lot of research has gone into determining this, it is not just a name. You could say this is a heart-healthy food,"" shares Meenakshi Bajaj, registered dietician, adding to the many other benefits that this oil has to offer  Great shelf life  This oil stays on shelves for a long time, thanks to the high quantities of y-oryzanol that helps to improve the oxidative stability that it possesses.  Super antioxidants  Rice bran oil can help improve inflammation and metabolic variables specifically fasting blood glucose, blood pressure and cholesterol thereby improving metabolic syndrome.  Balancing act  The fatty acid composition of this oil, which consists saturated fatty acids, monounsaturated fatty acids and polyunsaturated fatty acids, is well balanced. In fact, it is even recommended by the WHO and the American Heart Association to lower blood cholesterol due to this reason, says Meenakshi. That being said, the oil is to be consumed only in moderation.  Versatile station  The high smoking point of this oil (2450 C) allows it to be used as healthy cooking oil for sauting, grilling, marinades, salad dressing, stir-frying, and even deep-frying. In comparison, its counterparts may have low smoking points, the flavour and nutrient are lost and it gets converted to transfat when used for frying purpose. Furthermore, the amount of oil absorbed in the fried snack is about 15 per cent less.  Skin benefits  Rice bran oil is a powerhouse of vitamin E, more specifically, tocopherol and tocotrienol. This gives it its anti-inflammatory properties that help with the effects of post-menopause, particularly hot flashes. It is also a source of bioactive phytonutrients like phytosterol, gamma oryzanol, and squalane.  The squalane plays an important role to keep the skin soft, smooth and supple. It is easily absorbed by the skin on consumption. The presence of these phytonutrients also helps one boost their immune system.  Ageing gracefully  The combination of bioactive components possessed by rice bran oil also helps the body prevent the process of premature ageing and age-related neurodegenerative diseases. Furthermore, it also improves cognitive function and interestingly, it has less allergenic in nature.  Healthy baking  This oil can be used as a shortening while baking. Rice bran can replace edible hydrogenated fat for up to 50 per cent. ""This is great, considering that baked goods are often full of trans fat. So, if you can replace it even that much, it is fairly good,"" explains Meenakshi.",Product of many benefits: The nice in rice bran oil,RICE

No, she tells them. She is Taiwanese.  To her, the distinction is important. China may be the land of her ancestors, but Taiwan is where she was born and raised, a home she defines as much by its verdant mountains and bustling night markets as by its robust democracy. In high school, she had planted a little blue flag on her desk to show support for her preferred political candidate; since then, she has voted in every presidential election.  Li Yuan-hsin, right, with her husband and daughter at a day care center in Chiayi, Taipei, Dec. 10, 2021. (Lam Yik Fei/The New York Times) Li Yuan-hsin, right, with her husband and daughter at a day care center in Chiayi, Taipei, Dec. 10, 2021. (Lam Yik Fei/The New York Times)  I love this island, Li said. I love the freedom here.  Well over 90% of Taiwans people trace their roots to mainland China, but more than ever, they are embracing an identity that is distinct from that of their communist-ruled neighbor. Beijings strident authoritarianism  and its claim over Taiwan  has only solidified the islands identity, now central to a dispute that has turned the Taiwan Strait into one of Asias biggest potential flashpoints.  To Beijing, Taiwans push to distinguish itself from the mainland poses a dangerous obstacle to the Chinese governments efforts to cajole, or coerce, Taiwan into its political orbit. Chinas leader, Xi Jinping, warned in October against the trend he sees as secession: Those who forget their heritage, betray their motherland and seek to split the country will come to no good end.  Most of Taiwans residents are not interested in becoming absorbed by a communist-ruled China. But they are not pushing for formal independence for the island, either, preferring to avoid the risk of war.  The rainbow village in Taichung, Taiwan, Oct. 18, 2021. (Lam Yik Fei/The New York Times) The rainbow village in Taichung, Taiwan, Oct. 18, 2021. (Lam Yik Fei/The New York Times)  It leaves both sides at a dangerous impasse. The more entrenched Taiwans identity becomes, the more Beijing may feel compelled to intensify its military and diplomatic campaign to pressure the island into respecting its claim of sovereignty.  Li is among more than 60% of the islands 24 million people who identify as solely Taiwanese, three times the proportion in 1992, according to surveys by the Election Study Center at National Chengchi University in Taipei. Only 2% identified as Chinese, down from 25% three decades ago.  Part of the shift is generational  her 82-year-old grandmother, Wang Yu-lan, for instance, is among that shrinking minority.  To Wang, who fled the mainland decades ago, being Chinese is about celebrating her cultural and familial roots. She paints classical Chinese ink landscapes and displays them on the walls of her home. She spends hours practicing the erhu, a two-stringed traditional Chinese instrument. She recounts stories of a land so beloved that her grandparents brought a handful of soil with them when they left. She still wonders what happened to the gold and silver bars they had buried beneath a heated brick bed in Beijing.  Old photos of Wang Yu-lan, including one from her wedding, at her home in Taiwan, Oct. 17, 2021. (Lam Yik Fei/The New York Times) Old photos of Wang Yu-lan, including one from her wedding, at her home in Taiwan, Oct. 17, 2021. (Lam Yik Fei/The New York Times)  Wang was 9 when she landed in Taiwan in 1948, part of the 1 million or so Chinese who retreated with the nationalists during Chinas Civil War with the communists. The island is about 100 miles off Chinas southeastern coast, but to many of the new arrivals, it felt like another world. The Chinese settlers who had been there for centuries  and made up the majority  spoke a different dialect. The islands first residents had arrived thousands of years ago and were more closely related to the peoples of Southeast Asia and the Pacific than to the Chinese. Europeans had set up trading posts on the island. The Japanese had ruled over it for 50 years.  Wang and the other exiles lived in villages designated for mainlander military officers and their families, where the aroma of peppercorn-infused Sichuan cooking mingled with the pickled scents of delicacies from southern Guizhou province. Each day, she and other women in the village would gather to shout slogans like Recapture the mainland from the communist bandits!  Over time, that dream faded. In 1971, the United Nations severed diplomatic ties with Taipei and formally recognized the communist government in Beijing. The United States and other countries would later follow suit, dealing a blow to mainlanders like Wang. How could she still claim to be Chinese, she wondered, if the world did not even recognize her as such?  There is no more hope, Wang recalled thinking at the time.  Liberty Square, a vast plaza where people often gather to play music, dance, exercise and protest, in Taipei, Taiwan, Oct. 10, 2021. (Lam Yik Fei/The New York Times) Liberty Square, a vast plaza where people often gather to play music, dance, exercise and protest, in Taipei, Taiwan, Oct. 10, 2021. (Lam Yik Fei/The New York Times)  Wang and other mainlanders who yearned to return to China had always been a minority in Taiwan. But a few generations later, among their children and grandchildren, that longing has morphed into a fear of Beijings expansive ambitions. Under Xi, Beijing has signaled its impatience with Taiwan in increasingly menacing ways, sending military jets to buzz Taiwanese airspace on a near-daily basis.  When nearby Hong Kong erupted in anti-government protests in 2019, Li, the schoolteacher, followed the news every day. She saw Beijings crackdown there and its destruction of civil liberties as evidence that the party could not be trusted to keep its promise to preserve Taiwans autonomy if the sides unified.  Lis wariness has only grown with the pandemic. Beijing continues to block Taiwan from international groups, such as the World Health Organization, a clear sign to her that the Communist Party values politics above people. Taiwans success in combating the coronavirus, despite these challenges, had filled her with pride.  Watching the Tokyo Olympics last year, Li felt indignant that athletes from Taiwan had to compete under a flag that was not their own. When they won, the song that played in venues was not their anthem. Rather than Taiwan or Republic of China, their team carried the name Chinese Taipei.  Taken together, these frustrations have only steeled the Taiwanese resolve against the Chinese Communist Party. The global criticism of China for its handling of COVID-19 and its repression at home rekindled a long-standing debate in Taiwan about dropping China from the islands official name. No action was taken, though; such a move by Taiwan would have been seen by Beijing as formalizing its de facto independence.  Antigovernment protesters in Hong Kong, Oct. 1, 2019. (Lam Yik Fei/The New York Times) Antigovernment protesters in Hong Kong, Oct. 1, 2019. (Lam Yik Fei/The New York Times)  To young people like Li, it was also unnecessary. Independence to them is not an aspiration; it is reality.  We are Taiwanese in our thinking, she said. We do not need to declare independence because we already are essentially independent.  That emerging confidence has now come to define Taiwans contemporary individuality, along with the islands firm embrace of democracy. To many young people in Taiwan, to call yourself Taiwanese is increasingly to take a stand for democratic values  to not, in other words, be a part of communist-ruled China.  Under its current president, Tsai Ing-wen, the Taiwan government has positioned the island as a Chinese society that is democratic and tolerant, unlike the colossus across the strait. As Beijing has ramped up its oppression of ethnic minorities in the name of national unity, the Taiwan government has sought to embrace the islands Indigenous groups and other minorities.  Taiwan represents at once an affront to the narrative and an impediment to the regional ambitions of the Chinese Communist Party, Tsai said last year.  Students visiting the Armed Forces Museum in Taipei, Taiwan, Oct. 5, 2021. (Lam Yik Fei/The New York Times) Students visiting the Armed Forces Museum in Taipei, Taiwan, Oct. 5, 2021. (Lam Yik Fei/The New York Times)  Many Taiwanese identify with this posture and have rallied around the countries willing to support Taipei. When Beijing imposed an unofficial trade blockade to punish Lithuania for strengthening ties with Taiwan, people in Taiwan rushed to buy Lithuanian specialty products like crackers and chocolate.  Democracy isnt just an expression of Taiwans identity  it is at its core. After the nationalists ended nearly four decades of martial law in 1987, topics previously deemed taboo, including questions of identity and calls for independence, could be discussed. Many pushed to reclaim the local Taiwanese language and culture that was lost when the nationalists imposed a mainland Chinese identity on the island.  Growing up in the 1980s, Li was faintly aware of the divide between the Taiwanese and mainlanders. She knew that going to her mainlander grandparents house after school meant getting to eat pork buns and chive dumplings  heavier, saltier food than the Taiwanese palate of her maternal grandparents, who fed her fried rice noodles and sauted bitter melon.  Such distinctions became less evident over time. Many of Taiwans residents are now proud of their islands culinary offerings, whether it is the classic beef noodle soup  a mix of mainland influences unique to Taiwan  or bubble milk tea, a modern invention.  In Taiwans effort to carve out a distinct identity, officials also revised textbooks to focus more on the history and geography of the island rather than on the mainland. In school, Li learned that Japanese colonizers  whom her grandmother, Wang, so often denounced for their wartime atrocities  had been crucial in modernizing the islands economy. She and her classmates learned about figures like Tan Teng-pho, a local artist who was one of 28,000 people killed by nationalist government troops in 1947, a massacre known as the 2/28 Incident.  Now, as China under Xi has become more authoritarian, the political gulf that separates it from Taiwan has only seemed increasingly insurmountable.  After Xi Jinping took office, he oversaw the regression of democracy, Li said. She cited Xis move in 2018 to abolish term limits on the presidency, paving the way for him to rule indefinitely. I felt then that unification would be impossible.  Li points to Beijing controls on speech and dissent as antithetical to Taiwan.  She compares Tiananmen Square in Beijing, which she visited in 2005 as a university student, with public spaces in Taipei. In the Chinese capital, surveillance cameras loomed in every direction while armed police watched the crowds. Her government-approved guide made no mention of the Communist Partys brutal crackdown in 1989 on pro-democracy protesters that she had learned about as a middle school student in Taiwan.  She thought of Liberty Square in Taipei, by comparison, a vast plaza where people often gather to play music, dance, exercise and protest.  After that trip, I cherished Taiwan so much more, Li said.

After enduring years of emotional turmoil and economic hardships, Shaina had found her life's purpose in March 2021 with her entrepreneurial venture - Transgender Tasty Hut. Just when she was getting a taste of independence, the persistent stigma and a second lockdown robbed her of the provisional peace she'd made with destiny.

The business was doing fine in the beginning, just before the second lockdown. College students and faculty members enjoyed my bread omelette, momos, and pani puri. But that significantly dropped during the second wave. I hardly earned Rs 150 a day as compared to my earlier income of Rs 500 to Rs 600.

The ministry has taken several steps during the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic to push the exports.  These measures include an extension of validity of various certifications/ accreditations beyond their dates of expiry; setting up of control rooms to resolve problems; issuance of online certificates for exports; and facilitating opening up of more testing laboratories.  Due to these initiatives, it said, India was able to meet the global demand, which has provided momentum to agriculture exports.  ""With the present level of growth, India's agriculture exports are likely to cross USD 50 billion for the first time, which is the highest ever in history,"" it said. The ministry said that rice exports are likely to touch 21-22 million tonnes this year. Exports of non-basmati rice, wheat, sugar, and other cereals too have recorded healthy growth so far.  An increase in exports of these products has benefitted farmers in states like Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, and Maharashtra, it added. Further, it said that exports of marine products are likely to cross USD 8 billion this fiscal for the ""first time"".  ""Spice exports are also likely to touch record levels of around USD 4.8 billion. Despite facing tremendous supply-side issues, coffee exports have registered a healthy growth of around 35 per cent, which has improved realisations for coffee growers in Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu,"" it added.  Measures taken by the ministry have helped in pushing exports from unexplored areas, it said, adding exports have taken place from clusters like Varanasi (fresh vegetables, mangoes), Ananthpur (banana), and Solapur (pomegranate).","Agricultural exports likely to create history crossing USD 50 billion, says Ministry of Commerce",RICE
2022-01-21,https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/roll-back-hrdf-cess-hike-surjewala-101642706012076.html,"Terming the Haryana governments decision to increase the Haryana Rural Development Fund (HRDF) cess on paddy anti-farmer, Congress national general secretary Randeep Singh Surjewala on Thursday demanded an immediate roll back of the hike.  In a statement, Surjewala condemned the decision of the Khattar-Chautala government to increase the cess by three-times from 0.5% to 2% on all varieties of paddy including 1509, Muchhal and Sarbati, terming it a short-sighted decision which will harm the cause of farmers.  Now, the farmers of Haryana will be compelled to either sell off their crop in the neighbouring states agricultural mandis or sell paddy to traders at a price cheaper by at least 100-120 per quintal. Six months back, the BJP-JJP government had increased market fee from 0.5% to 2% on all varieties of paddy, he said.  Last year, 42.5 lakh metric tonne basmati and 1509 paddy, and 56 lakh metric tonne Parmal rice was procured in Haryana. The increase in HRDF cess will cause additional economic burden not only on the farmers but also on the arhtiyas and labourers working at grain markets, Surjewala said.  He said if farmers go to mandis of other states to sell their crops, they will suffer financial losses, but at the same time, the state government will also generate less revenue. With paddy grown in our state reaching the neighbouring states, the state government will not get the tax, he added.  In the event of farmers selling paddy in Haryana, traders will recover the increased market and HRDF fee from them as against the prices prevailing in open market in India or abroad, which comes to about 100 to 150 per quintal, he said.  As a consequence to this, there will be an extra economic burden of about 500 crore on farmers of Haryana, he added.",Roll back HRDF cess hike: Surjewala,RICE
2022-01-21,https://indianexpress.com/article/world/us-wto-litigation-india-wheat-subsidy-7734478/,"Top American lawmakers have urged the Joe Biden administration to initiate a litigation process at the World Trade Organisation against India subsidising its farmers over half of the value of production for wheat.  US Wheat Associates, which has been aggressively pushing for such a move by the administration, has welcomed the letters by members of the Congress and Senate.  A group of 28 members of the US Congress, in a letter, said, American commodity producers are operating at a clear disadvantage to their competitors, primarily from India, where the government is subsidising more than half of the value of production for rice and wheat, instead of the 10 per cent allowable under World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules.  We ask that you swiftly take action to reverse the trend of non-compliance by India with WTO domestic support requirements by initiating a dispute settlement case, stated the letter to US Trade Representatives Katherine Tai and Agricultural Secretary Tom Vilsack.  The Congress members wrote the US has continually pressed India at the WTO to reform its price support programme but to no avail.  Considering Indias activity, we encourage you to initiate the WTO litigation process through a request for consultations, they said.  The letter by the members of the Congressmen on January 13 comes nearly a month after 18 Senators sent a similar letter to Vilsack and Tai requesting the Biden administration pursue WTO case against Indias domestic support for rice and wheat production.  The US has previously highlighted Indias non-compliance through counter-notifications at the WTO Committee on Agriculture.  Reacting to the move by the lawmakers, US Wheat Associates, in a statement, said it was pleased that several members of Congress have asked Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack and US Trade Representative Katherine Tai to pursue a WTO case against Indias trade-distorting domestic wheat and rice support.  National Association of Wheat Growers CEO Chandler Goule said it is important that as a WTO member, India must adhere to international commitments and not continue to create unfair advantages for its domestic production and distort world trade.  We appreciate these Senators bringing the issue to the attention of the administration and will continue to work with the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and United States Trade Representative (USTR) in enhancing the competitiveness of US wheat in the world, he said.  USDA estimates Indian wheat exports for the marketing year ending June 30, 2022, will be 5 million metric tons (MMT).  This leaves almost 28 MMT of wheat stocks remaining. The distortion of international wheat and rice trade from these policies is severe, costing US wheat farmers more than $500 million per year in lost income according to a 2020 Texas A&M University study commissioned by USW and USA Rice, according to a media release.",US lawmakers seek litigation at WTO against India on wheat subsidy,RICE
