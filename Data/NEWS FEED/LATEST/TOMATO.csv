2021-01-02,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/taking-note-of-farmer-welfare-the-kerala-way/article33475184.ece,"The political allegations levelled against the State in the context of the farmers protest are far removed from the factsFor more than a month now, farmers are writing a new history, camping at the borders of Delhi. The concrete barricades, thorny iron fences and powerful water cannons have not been able to prevent their tractor trollies from reaching the vicinity of the national capital. They have been so determined and prepared that the Delhi winter has failed before them. Assembled in their thousands, they have established a new way of life at Singhu, Tikri, Ghazipur, Noida and Shahjahanpur. In some manner, the upsurge by these farmers resembles the Occupy Wallstreet Movement in the United States, in 2011, whose slogan reverberates even today across the world: We are the 99 percent.Unflinching willpowerThe government might have thought that the farmers would retreat to their villages after a couple of days or a week at the most, but this is not the mood at all among the farmers. As a frequent visitor to one or the other centres of struggle, this writer would definitely say that this farmers struggle is unique in the history of free India. A self-contained lifestyle with all necessary arrangements for food, shelter, clothing, and sanitation are in place. Scores of them, young and old, with whom this writer could interact with, represent the unflinching will of a people who consider agriculture as their culture. Their utmost proximity to soil and nature has tempered them as steel, while helping them remain calm and cool at the same time.Farmers protest | Farmers to escalate protest if deadlock continues on January 4The firefighters in the government who talk in different terms (may be purposefully), might have prepared their own strategy to face this struggle of the annadatas. Some of them say that the doors of dialogue are always kept open. There are certain others who are stubborn in saying that there can be no compromise on the implementation of the three Farm Bills. There are also those who still promise to take a relook if necessary, but only after two years. There is no need to ponder on this as most of these officials have been trained in a certain ideological school. As part of their campaign of malignment, the propaganda managers have labelled the farmers Khalistanis and urban naxalites.But these sons and daughters of the soil, who sow the seeds of hope to feed their fellow beings, have maintained inimitable self-restraint. Their struggle, their unity, their patience, and the massive nature of their battle are having an impact on the cohesive nature of the ruling alliance, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA). Following in the footsteps of NDA ally, the Shiromani Akali Dal that walked out of the NDA in support of the farmers, the Rashtriya Loktantrik Party has also snapped its ties with the alliance. Another important party that shares power with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Haryana continues to remain unhappy with the central governments approach to the farmers issues.The Narendra Modi government expected the farmers to tire out and slowly retreat from the battlefront. But it is mistaken. The determination by the farmers to go on with the struggle is only strengthening by the day. The Prime Minister himself has come forward to lead a frontal attack on the annadatas. Recently, he minced no words in expressing his disappointment while accusing the struggle of being a politically motivated one. The thrust of his attack was evident when he criticised the Opposition as misleading the farmers and shooting from their shoulders to target the government. In this tirade, the Prime Minister pointed a finger against the Left-led government in Kerala.Farmers protests | Ready to celebrate Lohri at the borders, but theres no going back now, say farmersThe situation in KeralaAll the allegations that he has levelled against the Kerala government are unfounded, and far from truth. In his exhortation that there are no Agricultural Produce Market Committees (APMCs) and mandis in Kerala, he presumed that the concept of the Minimum Support Price is not prevalent in the State. He has shut his eyes to the basic truth about the agricultural scenario in Kerala.It is true that mandis regulated by an APMC are not in existence in Kerala. But it does not mean that the interests of farmers are not taken care of in the State. In fact, Kerala is the State where farmers rights are being protected by the government itself, and much more effectively than any other Indian State.Also read | Do new agri Bills impact Kerala?While the government of India has fixed the procurement rate for rice at 18 a kg, the Left Democratic Front government in Kerala is procuring rice from cultivators at 27.48 a kg. In the same manner copra (dried coconut) is also procured at a much higher rate in Kerala than the price announced by the central government. Kerala is the State where increased basic price is ensured not only for paddy but also vegetables and fruits. Sixteen such items are enlisted by the government where the basic prices (per kg) are guaranteed. To cite some of them, tapioca (12), banana (30), garlic (139), pineapple (15), tomato (8), string beans (34), ladies fingers (20), cabbage (11) and potato (20).Apart from crop insurance, paddy cultivators will get the royalty in Kerala at the rate of 2,000 per hectare. They have a pension too, which is something unique in India. In 2006, when farmers suicides became the order of the day across the country, the Left Front government introduced a debt relief commission that extended a helping hand to the farmers, thereby saving them.Also read | Kerala Assembly passes resolution urging Centre to scrap farm lawsThere is basis for a counterNo BJP-led government in the country can even imagine the measures that the Left government in Kerala has initiated for the welfare of farmers. Instead of understanding those measures, the Prime Minister has chosen to train his political guns on the Kerala government and the farmers. The influence of corporates on his allegations is clear. The Left has the moral and political authority to engage in any polemics with the BJP-led central government in this regard.It is intriguing why the Prime Minister has never said a word about the experience of Bihar where mandis were abolished in 2006 and the plight of farmers that only worsened after this measure was initiated. After the three farm ordinances of June 2020, 40% of mandis in Madhya Pradesh have registered only zero transactions.Also read | Mandis not an option for Kerala: Agriculture MinisterThe corporate stampThis is the reality of the farm Bills. Though they claim to enable the protection and the empowerment of farmers, the truth is just the opposite. The purpose of these laws is the enabling of the corporatisation of Indian agriculture and the introduction of contract farming. When Ministers continue to assure the continuance of mandis they are practically pushed out of the scene, as it happened in Madhya Pradesh and elsewhere. The annadatas have been able to foresee the evil in the three farm laws that would eventually find them at the mercy of corporate profit mongers. They know that these laws would ruin the backbone of the agricultural economy and badly affect the food security of India.Also read | You are being misled, Narendra Modi tells farmersThe farmers are in the struggle in order to prevent such a calamity from happening. It is high time that the Prime Minister and his government understand the patriotic and selfless role being played by the food providers of the country and the genuine nature and cause of their struggle.Binoy Viswam is Secretary, CPI National Council, and leader of the party in Parliament.

The scrub is good for removing dead skin.Mira also shared her go-to DIY facial routine  first, she applies lemon juice on her face. After removing it, she applies a mask made with besan (gram flour) and curd. To this mixture, you can also add other ingredients; Mira, for instance, adds orange peel powder, moringa powder, neem powder, and so on. Once the mask is semi-dry, rub your skin gradually to remove it.Following the mask, she puts tomato juice on her face. Cut a tomato and apply it straight on your face. Leave it for another 10-12 minutes and then remove.The facial routine is completed with aloe vera, which has many benefits for the skin.

While most farmers then decided to remain put at the borders  saying authorities wanted to push them into a corner  about 400 eventually moved to the Burari ground.Pointing to a volleyball net tied between a branch and a tent, Jagdeep Singh (24) from Punjabs Faridkot said on Tuesday, A sewadar from Delhi donated this net to us 10 days ago. Since then, some of us gather to play in the evenings. Farmers cannot sit idle, it is in our blood to do something productive. For the same reason, a number of older farmers decided to make use of the land and grow a few vegetables.Rows of 12-day-old onion plants are being cultivated not far from the 40 tractors at the site. Said Gurudev Singh Manga (42): They will take around 60 days to start yielding onions. It is symbolic of the fact that we will not move from here anytime soon.Gurudev and others from Ropar district in Punjab reached the site in the last week of November: We keep visiting Singhu and Tikri, but we will not go anywhere as it is easier to march to Delhi from here.At another corner of the site, Jaskaran Singh Kahan (58) and his family from Firozpur tend to the rows of corn, spinach, tomato and onion: There are 15 corn trees and two rows each of other vegetables. Once it becomes a bit warmer, we will grow rice and a few more vegetables. That way, we do not have to depend on resources from outside.He added that some were grown from leftover vegetables, while some seeds and plants were purchased from a nursery nearby. He said that they will be grown organically as the quality of the mud is good.While sporadic rains have been a boon for these crops, they have posed a new set of challenges. Many farmers dug trenches around their tents and tractors when they were expecting rain so water wouldnt accumulate where they sleep.For others, who have set up bigger tents with cloth on the ground, this was not an option. Pinderjeet Kaur (32), who joined her father-in-law at the protest, came to Delhi in a private vehicle along with her husband and two children. She said, Ten of us, including the children, sleep on three mattresses, which are now wet because of the rain the roof of the tents keep flying at night as well. She said nobody has given them a fresh set of mattresses and that they would have to wait for them to dry.Meanwhile, groups of farmers worked through the day to set up sheds for the two langars at the site. Jaspaal Singh (58) from Faridkot said a number of items come in from Singhu and Tikri borders. When we need something, we tap our networks there. Apart from that, people from Delhi come to our aid. The day it rained, a few sewadaars came and gave us material to set up tents, including asbestos, logs of wood, nails and hammers.As the evening set in, both langars had been sheltered from the drizzle, and farmers said they no longer had to worry about cooking in the rain.","Corn to onions — Burari ground, once feared as a ‘jail’, now a field for farmers",TOMATO

2021-01-08,https://www.newindianexpress.com/states/odisha/2021/jan/08/poison-on-the-plate-markets-see-rise-in-fake-food-products-2247212.html,"Asish Mehta ByExpress News ServiceBHUBANESWAR: You eat with your eyes first, goes an adage. But going just by the looks of it may prove fatal considering the extent of spurious food that have made their way into the open markets, particularly from Cuttack. The recent raids by the Commissionerate Police are a pointer to the volume of fake and sub-standard food items laced with chemicals flooding the markets.What are you consuming?From ghee, honey, turmeric and chilli powders to tomato sauce and soya chunks, the food adulteration network runs deep. The products are prepared using harmful chemicals, colours and sold to unsuspecting consumers at cheaper rates. A report suggests that spurious ghee is a heady mix of palm oil, vanaspati and yellow chemical colour; honey is prepared using water, sugar and chemical colour. For turmeric powder, the adulterators use waste rice powder and non-edible synthetic yellow colour.The list does not end here. Soya chunks are prepared using flour and ammonium bicarbonate (a levelling agent) that makes the dough light and airy besides, chilli powder is laced with non-edible aniline dyes. The innocuous ketchups that go into your noodles, rolls and fast food are prepared using cheap red, orange and green colours along with a mixture of pumpkin, potato and tomato paste. These sauces are easily available in the market and commonly used by street food vendors.Capital Hospitals Department of Forensic Medicine and Toxicology (FMT) consultant Dr LK Behera says adulterated food can cause serious health hazards and lead to diseases like cancer. Turmeric is often adulterated by mixing wood powder and can cause obstruction in the intestine while chemicals in food products can cause cancer, gastroenteritis, liver and skin diseases, and others, he says.Profits First, Health SecondThe trade of spurious food is booming and food adulterators make a profit of 200 per cent (pc) through the illegal trade as cost of production is cheap.For example, production cost of a kg of refined honey is Rs 200 but that of adulterated honey is only Rs 40 which though sells for Rs 140 per kg in the market, says a report by Commissionerate Police. Whereas pure honey costs Rs 300 a kg and has a profit margin of 15 pc, sale of spurious honey brings 100 pc profit.Similarly, production of branded and popular tomato or chilli sauce would cost Rs 120 per kg but the spurious and low-quality costs only Rs 30. The genuine sauce costs Rs 160 per kg having a profit margin of 20 pc but the fake one is sold at Rs 70 per kg with an 80 pc profit margin.The production cost of pure turmeric and chilli powders is Rs 150 per kg and adulterated is Rs 70 per kg. Unadulterated turmeric and chilli powders are available for Rs 260 per kg with a profit margin of 20 pc and the spurious powders are sold for Rs 120 per kg having a profit margin of about 60 pc.Similarly, adulteration of clarified butter or ghee is equally profitable with the unscrupulous elements earning 40 pc profit from the business. Production of ghee costs Rs 300 per kg and a kg of the spurious stock can be prepared with just Rs 80. Pure ghee is available in the market between Rs 350 and Rs 500, the spurious counterpart is available at Rs 150 a kg.When it comes to soybeans, production cost is Rs 60 per kg as compared to Rs 30 per kg for the unadulterated item. Soybeans are sold for Rs 80 per kg in the market with 15 pc profit margin as compared to Rs 50 for the adulterated product having 40 pc profit margin. Its the high profit margin which drives these spurious food manufactures to sustain, says Cuttack DCP Prateek Singh who has gone after the adulterators in his area of operation.The Market & ConsumersThe recent raids show food adulteration mafia operates mostly out of Cuttack city and Jagatpur which are hubs of manufacturing consumer goods besides outskirts of the Millennium City where they can remain low-profile. The businesses have been flourishing as surveillance by Cuttack district administration as well as the municipal corporation is next to nothing.The consumer base, though, is spread across the region and food class. Much of the low-standard food is consumed by caterers which use the cost advantage to save on spending. Fast food makers are a big consumer base too as they pay little attention to health and hygiene; nor do their buyers.These manufacturers also focus on suburban and rural landscape of neighbouring districts where quality of packaged food is never under scrutiny due to poor surveillance of Food Supplies and Consumer Welfare Department, says an officer.Last year, Commissionerate Police alone registered 21 cases against production of adulterated food items and arrested 25 persons arrested while seizing goods worth over Rs 7.36 crore. This means the overall business of such spurious food manufacturers run into tens of crores rupees across the State, just going by the volume exposed by Twin City Police.Intensifying SurveillanceThe raids have led to alarm but also brought relief from people in general that adulterated food is being obliterated from the markets. Locals have urged police to continue raids at food manufacturing units to arrest the menace. Surveillance is the need of the hour, they said. Apparently, such illegal units continue to thrive due to complacence of the municipal corporations and district administrations. Consider this: Odisha scored only 53.15 pc in Food Safety and Standards Authority of Indias second State Food Safety Index in 2019-20.This index is based on performance of the State on five significant parameters - human resources and institutional data, compliance, food testing (infrastructure and surveillance), training and capacity building, and consumer empowerment. The Index is a dynamic quantitative and qualitative benchmarking model that provides an objective framework for evaluating food safety across all States/UTs. FSSAI states that states scoring below 60 pc score need a push.Keep an Eye on PricesCuttack-Bhubaneswar Police Commissioner Sudhanshu Sarangi has urged citizens to not compromise with price while buying food items as adulterated products cost less in open markets. People must inform police if they find the price of a food product to be surprisingly low.Our raids will continue so that health is not a casualty. We have also requested Odisha Industrial Infrastructure Development Corporation to review the land allotment of the units found to be involved in manufacturing adulterated food items and take necessary action against them, said Sarangi.Food adulteration is conducted to alter the taste and quantity and can have serious impacts on an individuals health. People must be alert, Dr Behera cautions.",Poison on the plate: Markets see rise in fake food products,TOMATO

We follow an age-old technique of dehydration of preserving the food by removing moisture.He cites an example of grandmothers using the process of dehydration by drying chips and papad under the sunlight to remove moisture content.Once dried it can stay up to 1-2 years without attracting fungus and bacteria. Our process is based on the similar concept of drying the fruit and vegetable under hot air to remove moisture content and then making the powder, he adds.He tried making the first product in the kitchen using a microwave oven. I failed multiple times, burnt a lot of onions and garlic to arrive at my desired product. I tried using dehydrated onion and garlic in my curries to understand the difference (good or bad) it brought to my recipes. I was excited to find out that my curries even tasted better and just a spoonful of these powders was enough to bring that natural flavour. Not only did I not have to chop onions and garlic, he says.The powders did not require any roasting as well since they were dehydrated and hence, in concentrated form. This reduced my cooking time almost to half! This is how to we provide RTC products to our customer without compromising on health, he shares. The products that his startup offers are red onion powder, tomato powder, green chilli powder, garlic powder among other items.We also have five blends in our product catalogue and we are consistently working towards launching many more.Kolkata Jhal Muri (Murmura/Puffed Rice) Masala can be used in puffed rice with chopped onions, green chillies, coriander leaves, coconut, peanuts mixed in a small quantity of mustard oil and blended with the goodness of spices which makes it a very tasty and healthy snack. We have come up with this authentic blend straight from our kitchen for this snack, he informs.They have six fruit roll-ups and fried onion flakes as well.","Dried, powdered and bottled for the kitchen",TOMATO

(Representational)The Trump administration announced an import ban on all cotton and tomato products from western Chinas Xinjiang region on Wednesday over allegations that they are made with forced labor from detained Uighur Muslims.U.S. Customs and Border Protection said the order applies to raw fibers, apparel and textiles made from Xinjiang-grown cotton, as well as canned tomatoes, sauces, seeds and other tomato products from the region, even if processed or manufactured in third countries.Read | How China won Trumps trade war and got americans to foot the billThe agency, which is part of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), estimates that about $9 billion of cotton products and $10 million worth of tomato products were imported from China into the United States in the past year.DHS acting deputy secretary Kenneth Cuccinelli told a news briefing the order sends a message to importers that DHS will not tolerate forced labor of any kind and companies should eradicate Xinjiang products from their supply chains.The move is the latest by the Trump administration in its final days to harden the U.S. position against Beijing, erecting economic penalties that would make it more difficult for President-elect Joe Biden to ease U.S.-China tensions after he takes office on Jan. 20.In December, Congress passed the bipartisan Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, which assumes that all goods manufactured in Xinjiang are made with forced labor and therefore banned, unless CBP certifies otherwise.Read | Uighur exploitation in China slammed as modern day slaverySecretary of State Mike Pompeo, in his final days in office, has been weighing a determination as to whether forced labor in Xinjiang constitutes an atrocity or labeling it genocide, which analysts say would have significant implications for relations with China.The region wide import ban follows a move to block cotton imports from Chinas largest producer, the military-linked Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps (XPCC).Both will have a big impact on cotton production in Xinjiang, which produces as much as 20% of the worlds supply of the commodity.Cotton futures prices fell slightly on Wednesday, but traders attributed the drop to profit-taking after prices hit a two year high on a U.S. production outlook cut.CBP officials said some 43 shipments of cotton-based products have been detained at U.S. entry ports since the XPCC ban was announced.The U.S. apparel industry had previously criticized a broad ban as impossible to enforce. On Tuesday, a coalition of apparel and retail groups said in a joint statement that members were working to push forced labor from their supply chains but hoped to work with CBP to make sure that enforcement is smart, transparent, targeted and effective.The United Nations cites what it says are credible reports that 1 million Muslims held in camps have been put to work in Xinjiang and faith leaders, activist groups and others have said crimes against humanity, including genocide, are taking place.China denies mistreating Uighurs and says the camps are vocational training centers needed to fight extremism.The Chinese embassy in Washington said in a statement the forced labor issue was a political lie and vowed to take actions to safeguard the rights of its companies.The U.S. side resorts to pressure, sanctions and other means to suppress Xinjiang enterprises and undercut Xinjiangs stability, development and prosperity, the statement said.","US bans imports of all cotton, tomato products from China’s Xinjiang region",TOMATO

Cauliflower, for instance, is selling at Rs 3.50 per kg at the weekly markets and mandis and tomato for as low as Rs 10 per kg.This is because many Haryana farmers are selling their produce directly in the Gurgaon mandis instead of the main market at Delhis Ghazipur. Since several roads are blocked in the national capital, it has been difficult for them to reach Ghazipur, from where their produce is routed to states like UP, Punjab, Himachal and Rajasthan. But with truck movement severely disrupted because of the blockades  the UP Gate protest site is, in fact, right next to the Ghazipur mandi  farmers are opting to sell their produce in Gurgaon and cut their losses.In fact, prices of almost all vegetables have come down by 50 to 75% in the past 20 days. Apart from the local vegetable markets, veggies on aggregator apps and in stores inside condominiums have also been selling at a low price.According to farmers, apart from the blocked roads, the absence of a cold storage facility in Gurgaon is forcing them to sell their produce at a lower rate as they are unable to preserve the veggies. Usually farmers from Pataudi, Farrukhnagar, Nuh, Jhajjar and other nearby districts of Haryana sell their produce at the Ghazipur mandi. However the blockade of arterial roads has meant that sales of fruits and vegetables have shrunk close to 50% at the capitals wholesale market for over a month now.Sellers from Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan are unable to visit the Ghazipur mandi, which has started to hurt their business. Vegetable sales are 50% less than a month ago, said Anil Yadav, a member of the Azadpur mandi, and wholesaler at the Khandsa mandi in Gurgaon. The detour has increased the transport freight and shortage of trucks has also affected our business. Transportation of onions, bottle gourd, bitter gourd, ginger, garlic to north Indian states has come down substantially due to the unavailability of trucks.Rajinder Kumar, a wholesaler, said vegetables are being literally dumped at the Gurgaon mandi. Earlier, vegetables from the neighbouring districts were transported to Delhi. But nowadays, instead of selling their crop in the mandis there, farmers are dumping the same in the wholesale market in Gurgaon. The current climatic conditions are favourable for vegetables and thus a large number of farmers in the adjoining district have been bringing huge quantities of vegetables to the local markets.The rates of onions and potatoes have also seen a dip, being sold at Rs 25 per kg and Rs 15 per kg, respectively, on Wednesday. The price of radish and carrot is Rs 10 per kg, while peas and pumpkin are being sold for Rs 25.Hemant Kumar, another wholesaler, said he has witnessed this sharp slump in vegetable prices for the first time. Be it radish, carrot, onion or potato, prices of all vegetables have crashed. The oversupply in the market is only leading to drop in prices as buyers are less, he said.At present, only 6,000 trucks are moving in and out of Delhi. Earlier this number used to be around a lakh. Not only vegetables, but prices of all essential goods have been impacted, said Rajinder Kapoor, president of Delhi Goods Transport Association.Meanwhile, consumers are a delighted lot. This is the first time that I got five different veggies for less than Rs 40 a kg. I am surprised that I am able to purchase vegetables for such a low price in an expensive city like Gurgaon, said Megha Chawla, a Sector 56 resident.","As blockades force farmers to go local, veggies dirt cheap at mandis",TOMATO

The venue and dates of the fest will be declared soon. District magistrate Kaushal Raj Sharma has held meetings for assigning roles of agriculture, horticulture, culture, tourism departments, Indian Institute of Vegetable Research, Varanasi Municipal Corporation and Varanasi Development Authority. We will rope in hotels, restaurants, chefs and housewives.District horticulture officer Sandeep Kumar Gupta said, Tomato and onion are two vegetable that witness massive price fluctuation. When the prices start rising, there is massive hue and cry. But, mostly the price of tomato doesnt rise and farmers are compelled to sell it for Rs 3-Rs 10 per kg. Risk for tomato growers is also high as it is perishable and cant be stored for long.As per rough estimates, tomato is cultivated in over 5,000 hectare in Mirzapur, Sonbhadra, Naugarh belt of Chandauli, Ghazipur and Varanasi, and on an average 350 quintal of hybrid tomato is produced per hectare, said Gupta.It is a good move of the government and will help increase local and industrial consumption of tomato which will ensure good price round the year, he added.The fest will help farmers understand the requirements of hospitality and industrial sectors and the varieties of tomatoes best suited for them.Gaurav Garg, the chief executive officer of the event management company assigned this fest, said, It will be a good event. Housewives and master chefs will be participating and cooking their own dishes, while hotels, restaurants and vendors will also showcase their tomato-based food, drink and dessert items. The event will focus on attracting agro industries.

If all goes well, I hope to have a satiating Vishu feast in a couple of months at my Malayali friends place. Since sadhya is usually vegetarian, I thought I should, meanwhile, make the most of some fluffy appam and chicken stew. I went to the net and found that there were two new Kerala restaurants in my neighbourhood. I decided that Id try both out.The first was Kannur (Ph: 8750483283), and the second Mariyan (Ph: 8447127533), both in Mayur Vihar Phase III. From Kannur, I ordered some parottas (10 each), chicken curry (120), buffalo meat fry (120), tomato fry (50) and (by mistake) kadhai paneer (140). With taxes and delivery charges, the bill came to about 660.From Mariyan, a few days later, we asked for the Mariyan Special Chettinad chicken curry (180)  though this is not from Kerala  buff meat dry fry (160) and appam (12 each).On the two menus are also dishes such as vegetable korma, kadala curry, egg roast, biryani and various kinds of fish preparations.I love both parottas and appams. Kannurs parottas were flaky and crisp. I had one with the chicken curry gravy, which was nicely spicy, and the tomato fry, which was rather interesting  tart, but not overly so. Even though the paneer was not on my list, it turned out to be pretty good: the pieces were soft, and the gravy was thick and creamy.I was looking forward to the buffalo meat fry, but that sorely disappointed me. I tried out a piece when it arrived, and found it much too hard. So I pressure cooked it a bit, but even then it was too chewy. I had thought Id have one parotta with the meat fry, but after bravely struggling with the meat, I gave up.Appam | Photo Credit: iStockphotoMariyans buffalo meat fry, however, was delicious. It was a bit different from the ones that Ive had over the years. For one, it didnt have the little coconut bits that the Kannur buff had (I really enjoy the fried coconut in this dish). Second, the meat had been cut into strips, like small fish fingers. And the pieces had been dredged with corn flour and masalas, and then fried. It had a heady flavour of garlic, and the cornflour gave it an enjoyable crunch.The Chettinad chicken curry was delicious, too. The gravy was thick and had a coconutty taste, while the meat was so tender that it fell off the bone. I had the curry with two appams (which, despite the 6-odd-kilometre journey, were fluffy and soft when I had them for dinner). I missed not having parottas with the buffalo meat.Well, that can soon be remedied; all that I need to do is make a call. I am glad I have these small Kerala eateries in my neighbourhood. There was a time, not so long ago, when I used to comb the areas around hospitals in search of good Kerala food. Hospitals meant staffers from Kerala, which, in turn, translated into good regional food. Now, these eateries can be found in all parts of Delhi.

While a kilogram of drumstick at Koyambedu Wholesale Market Complex (KWMC) costs Rs 120, curry leaves was sold at Rs 60 a kg. Traders attributed the unprecedented increase to a drop in arrivals to the market.V R Soundararajan, a former member of the market management committee of KWMC and a wholesale trader, said unseasonal rain damaged crops, resulting in short supply and price rise. Harvest and ,in turn, arrivals to Chennai, have reduced. I havent seen such high prices sustain in the wholesale market in the past. Wholesale cost of curry leaves has never exceeded Rs 30 per kilogram, he said.Curry leaves, which cost Rs 80/kg last week, will be sold for Rs 60 this week. The Rs 20 drop was due to a dip in sales, Soundararajan said. Koyambedu market sources curry leaves from Mettupalayam in Coimbatore district and parts of Andhra Pradesh.Cost of drumstick too has reduced by Rs 20 and will cost Rs 120 a kg this week. The market currently gets only 100 tonnes of drumstick a day, 50% of the daily average of 200 tonnes of drumstick supplied usually. The highest the vegetable cost all of last year was Rs 60/kg and at times, dropped to Rs 15/kg.

Chandrasekhar Rao announced that the government would not buy the crop from the next season. Is it due to the new farm laws, he asked the CM to clarify. He said his meeting with farmers throughout the State was to understand their fears and raise it in the Assembly seeking answers from the government.Mr. Vikramarka alleged that both the Central and State governments were terrorising the farmers foisting false cases but the Congress party would support the farmers when they need political support the most.Explaining how lack of government support will hurt the farmers, he said tomato farmers in Narayankhed recently had to throw away their produce due to lack of support price. Neither the traders were willing to buy nor the government was helping and they just threw away the produce on the roads.He said both Narendra Modi and KCR were together in cheating the farmers to ensure their crony capitalists benefited. He said BJP was a party of businessmen and Prime Minister Modi was working for Ambani and Adani and such groups at the cost of common man.

And the passion surely transcends into the delicious food that they make. Specialising in Marwari cuisine, giving healthy twists to regular food is what sets them apart.For instance, the Rajkachori that I had was made in fresh, crisp poori stuffed with dhokla made with spinach and topped with sev, coriander and tamarind chutney and curd. The green dhokla gave the chaat a splash of colour and a unique twist to this street-food.

The paneer badami was not spicy, was a little sweet in light tomato gravy topped with slivers of almonds. It paired well with hara bhara parathas made of wheat. The nutritious rotis were soft and thankfully, not oily.

We moved on to making homemade dry snacks like bhel, jhaal muri, mathris, and flavoured bhujiyas. Abhipsa credits her mother Nirmala for these recipes.Always open to adaptation, she adds, We customise our starters; whip up new dishes and tweak the old ones of my mothers recipes.

In the coming days, the farmers are anticipating that the price may go down further spelling further misery, said secretary of district unit of All India Krusaka Sabha, Padmalav Das.The dip in price has affected farmers of Derabisi, Mahakalapada, Garadapur, Pattamundai, Aul, Rajkanika and Rajnagar blocks. Absence of cold storage adds to the problem of farmers. This apart, absence of market linkage and availability of better quality tomatoes sources from Andhra Pradesh have only added to the farmers problems.Secretary of district unit of Krusaka Sabha, Umesh Chandra Singh said officials of Agriculture and Horticulture departments along with elected representatives must visit the villages to witness the predicament of farmers. The authorities should fix a support price for tomatoes so that the farmers can recover their losses, he said, adding if no steps are taken soon, the farmers will take to the streets as a mark of protest.",Tomato price dip worry for Kendrapara farmers,TOMATO

While they continue to juggle to do their best in the personal and professional front, one thing that often gets ignored is their health. Women tend to miss out on some of the most beneficial supplements in the daily grind, also, due to lack of awareness about their benefits. Take, Vitamin C, for instance, the immunity boosting, and often misunderstood vitamin. It is water soluble, hence, your body cannot store it. This is precisely why you need to consume it every day through food and other supplements, for it to have the required effect in the body. Dietary recommendations for Vitamin C are often not met because of poor lifestyle, various diseases, smoking, alcohol, or drug abuse.Now, while most properties of Vitamin C help both genders the same, especially in boosting immunity, there are some that work particularly well for women. As women multi-task around the clock, lead hectic lifestyles and often fall prey to many lifestyle diseases, supplements like Vitamin C balance what their diets could be missing, lets take a closer look at the advantages of Vitamin C for women.This water-soluble nutrient acts a powerful antioxidant is needed for the development and maintenance of arterioles, scar tissues and cartilage. Collagen is a substance that is naturally produced by the body. However, the production of this substance diminishes as people grow older. Vitamin C plays an integral part in the production of collagen which therefore decreases wrinkles and the symptoms and signs of aging.Due to the needs of the developing foetus and the growing infant, vitamin C requirements are enhanced for pregnant and lactating women. The Vitamin C status of pregnant women is often lower than non-pregnant women, presumably due to active transfer of Vitamin C to the foetus. Women with complications of pregnancy can have much lower vitamin C status l. Supplementation of pregnant women with Vitamin C can potentially decrease the risk of pregnancy-related complications.Stress can affect various processes in the body like hormone production, the menstrual cycle, and fertility in women and men as well as digestion and immune function. When your body is exposed to stressful stimuli, the body makes the body makes it the priority over many other important processes. Vitamin C helps in dealing with typical indicators of physical and emotional stress. It also decreases the level of stress hormones. Hypertension is an important risk factor for cardiovascular disease in women but is often underestimated and undiagnosed. Incidences of abnormally high blood pressure can be lowered by the regular intake of Vitamin C.Vitamin C supplements can help improve the absorption of iron from the diet. Vitamin C assists in converting iron that is poorly absorbed, such as plant-based sources of iron, into a form that is easier to absorb. As a result, it may help reduce the risk of anaemia among people prone to iron deficiency.Vitamin C supplements have been linked to a reduced risk of heart disease. These supplements may reduce the impact of known risk factors for heart disease such as high blood levels of LDL (bad) cholesterol and triglycerides.Vitamin C can elevate your estrogen levels and lower progesterone levels. This causes the uterus to contract and the lining of the uterus to break down, leading to the onset of menstruation.The daily intake of Vitamin C depends on the country you are residing in. In India, you need 65-115 mg of Vitamin C depending on your age.66 mg/day68 mg/day65 mg/day80 mg/day115 mg/dayCitrus fruits, tomatoes and tomato juice, and potatoes are major contributors of Vitamin C. Other good food sources include red and green peppers, kiwifruit, broccoli, strawberries, brussels sprouts, and cantaloupe. Not all fruits and vegetables have equal levels of Vitamin C. For instance, bananas and apples are quite low in Vitamin C whereas oranges, strawberries, tomato, kiwi have a higher content. Vitamin C supplements are available as tablets, capsules, chewable tablets, gummies, and effervescent tablets. Not all Vitamin C supplements are created equal. To better ensure quality and safety, choose supplements that have been tested and certified by an authorised certifying body, such as the FSSAI (The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India).Vitamin C is a water-soluble vitamin that must be obtained from the diet or supplements. Vitamin C plays an important role in strengthening your immune system thus enabling you to lead a healthy life.",Importance of Vitamin C for women,TOMATO

He also accused the minister of not fulfilling any of the promises made in their manifesto during last Assembly polls.Minister Anbalagan had failed to bring Aliyalam-Thoolchetti project, Ennaikolpudur-Thumbalahalli project, Jarthalav- Pulikarai in Dharmapuri for revival of cultivation lands.

2021-03-25,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/covid-pandemic-a-chef-who-lost-her-sense-of-smell-30-years-ago/article34152228.ece,"As this writer recovers from COVID-19, she speaks to a chef who lost her sense of smell 30 years agoFor 10 days, all I could taste were oranges. Those citrusy bites were my only gustatory awakenings in the sleepy blandness that COVID-19 brought into my life. But, I could not smell them.Close your eyes and picture your favourite food. It is likely that the first thing you thought of was how it smells. The parts of your brain that process your emotions and memories use olfactory data, linking them closely. Our sense of smell richens our sense of taste.So when you wake up one morning and lose both, the world around you shifts slightly. You dont realise it but you miss the stimuli that were anchoring you: the smell of your skin, your bedsheets, wet soil in the garden, the shampoo in your hair, breakfast cooking in the kitchen.It happened to me in February, after I caught COVID-19. But to Chindi Varadarajulu, it happened 30 years ago  a severe flu during her second winter in Vancouver, Canada, left the would-be chefs nose incapable of sniffing out flavours.I am still upset that I have never smelt real lilacs, says Chindi. After appointments with specialists in Singapore and Canada, she had a name for the condition: anosmia.Chef Chindi Varadarajulu, founder of Pumpkin TalesIn the past year, anosmia has become a significant marker of Covid. Or in my case  parosmia, where instead of an olfactory vacuum, familiar smells seem distorted. For a few days, I wondered if anyone had spilled anything rancid in the vicinity. Did our dog kill a rat we did not know about? Because it seemed as though a stench would follow me around, stuck inside my nose.Around the world, as there is greater research on long covid, there may be relief for people whose symptoms have still not abated, even after testing negative.Thirty years on, Chindis sense of smell still has not returned. Still, it did not pull her back from a career in the culinary arts. Could her journey provide some answers for those who still show symptoms of anosmia?For a year after I stopped being able to smell, I tried nasal sprays of all sorts. Sometimes I would convince myself that I smelled something familiar  but it was just like a phantom itch, says Chindi.At her first restaurant in Vancouver, set up in 2003, she remembers accidentally burning a batch of dal, failing to notice and put it out until someone drew her attention to it. Today, she creates new recipes out of memories of old flavours, and has her team at Pumpkin Tales in Chennai test it out.She can do this because all these years, she has been making up for her lack of smell through an accentuated sense of taste.I may not be able to identify flavour profiles [a combination of taste and smell] but my taste is enhanced in many ways. For instance, tamarind, tomato, lemon  these are all sour tastes, but to different degrees: some sharp, some more rounded, some leave a bitter aftertaste, some sweet. I can appreciate all of that because of my years of training in it, says Chindi.I could see how visually appealing the meal was: a dollop of ghee melting over the tomato dal, seasoned with herbs and greens. But inside my mouth, it was a hot lump of nothingnessThe passion with which she speaks of taste reminds me of the two weeks I spent bereft of it. At lunchtime, I could see how visually appealing the meal was: a dollop of ghee melting over the tomato dal, seasoned with herbs and greens. But inside my mouth, it was a hot lump of nothingness. Fluffy rotis were like wet paper; evening snacks nothing better than an exercise in chewing.So of course, after getting my taste back, the first swirl of peanut butter chocolate ice cream made me feel complete in a way nothing else has.Chindi encourages me to pay more attention to the food I eat, and I readily agree. Take in the texture. Look at what you are eating and associate it with what youre feeling in your mouth, focus on the balance of tastes, she recommends.Train yourselfPay attention because if it slips away, you might not notice all at once. For, while there are eye charts and hearing tests, there are not many quantitative ways we can measure our power of smell and taste. Which is why, many people who have been infected with Covid once find it difficult to say for sure whether their senses have returned completely.Smell kits help. Comprising essential flavour profiles, they help associate odours with the correct source, almost willing your brain into recognising and remembering them.Back in February, I would do an informal training every day, as I picked up an apple or my favourite bar of soap, sniffing it, trying to remember what it smelt like.After I was reacquainted with a familiar smell  a cloud of freshly sprayed disinfectant, I rushed to the kitchen, sniffing spice after spice like some strange dog-woman. Most I could recognise again, but some are muffled till date.You should come over to the restaurant once, offers Chindi, We can do a smell-test and see how many you get right. I look forward to it.",The chef who lost her sense of smell 30 years before the COVID-19 pandemic,TOMATO

This is the second such announcement he has made after he promised to create another district with Arani (Tiruvannamalai) as its headquarters, last Sunday.Giving a fillip to micro-level administration, and to ensure that the people have easy access to government schemes, Palaniswami in the past four years carved out six new districts Kallakurichi, Tenkasi, Chengalpattu, Tirupattur, Ranipet and Mayiladuthurai. As of now, Tamil Nadu has 38 districts.Earlier in the day, while campaigning in Karur, Palaniswami recalled his connection with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. It was Modi who guided me when I took over as the CM. He shared his experiences as the CM of Gujarat, and it was he who gave the good advice that has helped in the development of our State. He further stated, Union Home Minister Amit Shah has helped us whenever we asked for it.The Centre has provided `1 lakh crore to Tamil Nadu for the construction of National Highways only because we have a very close alliance with them. In another development, veteran leader and DMKs agriculture wing State secretary, M Chinnasamy, joined the AIADMK in the presence of Palaniswami. Rajini Makkal Mandarams district chief Bagavan Paramasivam also joined the party.Chief Minister Edappadi K Palaniswami greets supporters during an electioncampaign in Dindigul district on WednesdayPlans on to build dam across Amaravati, says EPSSpeaking about other developmental works in the region, Chief Minister Edappadi K Palaniswami said, Water will be available in abundance after the Cauvery Godavari Linking Project. We are building a barrage at Nanjai Pugazhur at Rs 406 crore. Three-quarters of 1 TMC water will be stored so that farmers can get water for both, irrigation and drinking purposes. The AIADMK government has also carried out Cauvery drinking water project in 50 panchayats in Aravakurichi and Paramathi at Rs 462 crore. He added, Through the Tamil Nadu Slum Clearance Board, as many as 32 flats worth Rs 3 crore are being built in Karur. A betel leaf processing centre worth Rs 2.50 crore is also to be set up at Velayuthampalayam.Steps have been taken to bring surplus water from the LPP canal to cultivate reed grass. Through this, about 10,000 acres of farmlands will be irrigated. There are also plans to build a dam across the Amaravati River in Chinnadharapuram. Necessary steps will be taken to clean and desilt Thathampalayam lake too. Lands in Aravakurichi will be irrigated through a pumping station, and once this project is completed, the arid region will become a prosperous area. Palaniswami also lashed out at DMK chief MK Stalin for fielding Senthil Balaji to fight the elections.Stalin, who calls the AIADMK corrupted, has Senthil Balaji with him, who was fired by former Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa, for corruption in Karur. Stalin calls him the best candidate. Senthil Balaji is someone who gives fake assurances. He had said in the last election that they would give 3 cents of land to everyone in Aravakurichi. But did that happen? We worked hard for him when he was in the AIADMK. But today, he wants to overthrow us. While canvassing votes at Vedasandur later in the day, Palaniswami accused Stalin of insulting farmers.He referred to Stalins fake farmer and rowdy jibes against him and said, Stalin is insulting farmers in his attempt to insult me. Elaborating on various welfare schemes implemented by the AIADMK government in Vedasandur, the Chief Minister said that steps have been taken to carry out projects like establishing a Taluk office in Guziliyamparai and a food park and processing units for tomato and drumstick farmers. Madurai Kamaraj Universitys constituent college in Vedasandur would be converted into a Government Arts and Science College, he promised.Later, in Palani, Palaniswami also made a slew of other promises including the implementation of road and underground drainage projects, establishing cold storage facility for guava farmers, direct procurement centres for coconut and Kodaikanal hill garlic, among others. He also assured that a tourist bus stand would be built in Palani for devotees. Vaiyapuri lake would also be cleaned and a park would be constructed, Palaniswami said. The CM also addressed rallies in Dindigul and Oddanchatram constituencies, and promised to provide 1,000 units of free power supply to power loom weavers. If given a chance, the AIADMK would make Oddanchatram as a model constituency, he said.","Will create Palani district, promises EPS",TOMATO

The 68-year-old veteran faced multiple defeats in the Krishnagiri region over that period, and is set to contest from Veppanahalli in the same area, yet again this time. In 2016 Assembly elections, he came a distant third in Pennagaram. In 2019 Lok Sabha elections, he lost to the Congress candidate A Chellakumar in Krishnagiri. Now, he is locking horns with sitting DMK MLA P Murugan.The last two Assembly elections witnessed a bitter fight for Veppanahalli. On both occasions, DMK emerged victorious. Munusamy, a three-time MLA, is now a Rajya Sabha MP. Murugan, on the other hand, is contesting for the same seat for a second time. Last elections, Murugan won the seat by a margin of over 5,000 votes. Veppanahalli shares borders with both Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. Interestingly, its the only constituency with 100 per cent rural demography.Largely an agrarian society, tomato, mint, coriander, cabbage, and beans are widely cultivated here. People here are also dependant on the daily wages brought back by labourers working in Hosur, Bengaluru, Mallur, KGF, and other nearby industrial areas. Veppanahalli is rich in minerals and has over 150 granite polishing units.But, labourers here are mostly migrant workers. The segment, being a border area, has considerable number of linguistic minorities, who speak Telugu, Urdu, and Kannada. The constituency is dominated by Vanniyars, followed by Naidu, Adi Dravidar, and Gowdas communities.Whats the issue here?For tomato cultivators M Velayutham and L Vijay, their main demand is a cold storage unit. The State government should ensure that the tomatoes can be turned into a value-added product, by giving us equipment to make a sauce, juices, pickles, or other by-products. Government should set up a method where farmers could sell their produce directly to the government agency, they urged.The man-animal conflict was also a major concern for the people in this constituency. A forest official suggested, Because of the National Highway connecting Chennai - Bengaluru passing through the forest area, a few elephants inadvertently wander into the highway where they meet with accidents.To solve this fences must be built for a stretch of one km near Sanamavu. An Eco-Bridge can be constructed to allow the elephants to cross the road. The residents also demand to upgrade the PHCs.Poll promisesAIADMK candidate KP Munusamy assured to carry out all government schemes and ensure implementation of all AIADMK promises in the manifesto such as six gas cylinders per household, three-phase current system for farmers, and loan waiver for Self Help Group.DMK candidate P Murugan promised to set up a Government Polytechnic college in Veppanahalli. He also promised to reroute the Aliyalam- Thoolchetti channel via Nagamangalam and Rayakottai, which will revive over 5,000 acres of cultivation land and replenish over 20 lakes and groundwater table in Veppanahalli constituency.",Will third time be charm for AIADMK's Munusamy?,TOMATO

The growing rift comes as the United States and other Western governments increase pressure on China over suspected human rights abuses in the western region.Chinese social media users last week began circulating a 2020 statement by H&M announcing it would no longer source cotton from Xinjiang.H&M said at the time the decision was due to difficulties conducting credible due diligence in the region and after media and human rights' groups reported the use of forced labour in Xinjiang - a charge that Beijing has repeatedly denied.Xu Guixiang, a spokesman for the regional government of Xinjiang, told reporters that a company should not politicise its economic behaviour and said H&M won't be able to make money anymore in the Chinese market because of its statement.Elijan Anayat, another Xinjiang government spokesman, said during the briefing that Chinese people do not want the products of companies such as H&M and Nike that have boycotted Xinjiang's cotton. He invited companies to take trips to the region's cotton fields to see for themselves what is happening.WESTERN SANCTIONSWashington on Friday condemned what it called a ""state-led"" social media campaign in China against US and other international companies for committing not to use cotton from Xinjiang.The wave of consumer boycotts in China has coincided with a coordinated set of sanctions imposed by Britain, Canada, the European Union and the United States last week over what they say are human rights abuses taking place in Xinjiang. The US government has publicly accused Beijing of genocide against the Uighur Muslim ethnic minorities in the region.Xu repeatedly rejected accusations of genocide and human rights abuses in the region and accused the Western powers of engaging in political manipulation to destabilise China with the sanctions.The United States in January announced an import ban on all cotton and tomato products from the area due to allegations of forced labour from detained Uighur Muslims .Western governments and rights groups have previously accused authorities in the far-western region of detaining and torturing Uighurs in camps, where some former inmates have said they were subject to ideological indoctrination.China has repeatedly denied all such charges and say the camps are for vocational training and combating religious extremism.",China warns companies against politicising actions over Xinjiang,TOMATO

That explains, to an extent, why Mexican food appeals to me. It is, after all, a glorious mix of fluid and tonal flavours.It is also the cuisine that a talented young chef called Noah Barnes has been focusing on. Id had some delicious Mexican food at his restaurant Arriba some years ago, and still remember the taste of the habanero-smoked pork skewers, flavoured with honey and served with a hot chilli sauce.The chef now runs a new restaurant called Miss Margarita (Ph no 8920331591; M block market, GK 2), which specialises in Mexican food. Chef Barnes, who learnt the nuances of Mexican cooking from the former ambassador of Mexico in India, and a visiting master chef at the embassy, prepares various kinds of tortillas, quesadillas, tacos and more.Mexican food has a spicy edge that appeals to the Indian palate. Some of the flavours  such as cilantro  are used in both cuisines. We love our tomatoes and onions; so do they. A lot of what we eat  think corn on the cob or peanuts  came to our shores from distant Mexico.I love all their open and closed wraps. The tacos that he prepares, with different toppings are superb. His Street-styled grilled chicken and chilli bean taco (475) consisted of grilled chicken strips, a sweet paprika drizzle, refried beans, rocket, and smoked tomato salsa, topped with fresh tomato and onions.The dish I really loved was the diablo prawn (725). With a pressed tomato and coriander drizzle, it had a tamarind and habanero glaze and came with burnt garlic and lime. The prawns were first grilled and then tossed in the sauce. The tart flavours of the tamarind went well with the sharpness of the chillies. The prawn  soft inside and crunchy outside  had soaked in the flavours.The cheesy jalapeno chicken chipotle quesadilla (625) was just that  hot with a sharp taste of cheese, while the charred sweet potato and crispy cauliflower taco (395) was a spinach tortilla, also topped with a hot sauce. The problem with the latter was that I didnt really get the taste of cauliflower or the sweet potato, as it had been overwhelmed by the sauce.The pork carnitas tacos, however, were superb. Soft pork belly had been topped with a potato, pineapple and jalapeno salsa, smoked tomato salsa and refried beans (575). The chicken enchilada, the chef said, was a dish of chargrilled chicken, mixed with peppers and cheese, rolled in tortilla bread and topped with home-made fermented hot sauces, baked with cheese.Churros with chocolate and chilli chocolate sauce at Miss Margarita in Delhi | Photo Credit: Special arrangementChef Barnes takes pride in his Fresh Guacamole Bar, where guacamole is prepared at the table with avocado, tomatoes, jalapeno, onion, coriander and lime, and served with chips. There is a smoked chicken guacamole, too.There is a lot else on the menu: blackened Cajun fish taco (475), gondhoraj flavoured lime shrimp fajita (975) and a chicken casserole consisting of crispy, skinned chicken and spiced pilaf (775).I ended the meal with my favourite churros, eaten with chocolate and chilli chocolate sauce (425). It is a simple dish  fried dough dusted with sugar and cinnamon, but it is the sauce that gives it its singular taste. I dipped the churros in the chilli chocolate sauce and thought that was a blend worth a salsa.The writer is a seasoned food critic",Do a salsa and more at Miss Margarita in South Delhi,TOMATO

With a farm-based economy, the process-side lags and the lack of affiliated agro-based industries are the main concerns for the cultivators here. A cold storage facility for tomatoes remains to see fruition here.The constituency is also drought prone. Poor rainfall and the resultant drought axed cane production that Palacodde Sugar Cooperative Mill did not take up crushing this year for want of cane.Palacodde has long demanded irrigation schemes linking from Ennekolputhur (Krishnagiri) to Thumballahalli dam; Aliyaalam dam to Tulchetti lake; and Jathalavau channel extension to Pullikarai  to tackle the drought. Ennekolputur project was hastily hatched up in an election year and notification was issued only recently.Minister for Higher Education K.P. Anbalagan has had winning streak, holding the constituency for four straight terms since 2001. If anti-incumbency is a challenge, his run is equally dogged by the drought of Palacodde and the inability to deliver the promised irrigation schemes.The drought is seen as a result of the AIADMK governments failure to implement the irrigation schemes and the Minister is seen as the face of that failure, since the irrigation schemes were part of his poll promise in 2016. Kongu Vellalar community that is second only to the Vanniyars in population in the constituency has been hit hard by the drought as land holders.In addition, there is resentment of under-representation amid Kongu Vellalars for not receiving candidature even in the neighbouring constituency of Paapireddypatti, where they are a sizeable population. The blame for it has been laid on Mr. Anbalagan, who is said to have pushed for Vanniyar candidate in all, but one reserved constituency.The vote bank is led by Vanniyars by over a lakh population (48.30%), followed by Kongu Vellalars (15.50%), Adidravidars (13.80%), Muslims (4.80%), Chettiars (5.20%) and others.The AIADMK has relied on the Vanniyar votes of the AIADMK and the PMK. But, the communitys votes are split with the DMK too. In addition, there is also degree of distrust amid the PMK supporters over the defeat of their leader Anbumani Ramadoss in the Lok Sabha elections, allegedly caused by the lackadaisical participation of the AIADMK.The DMK has fielded P.K. Murugan, an office-bearer in its lawyers wing for the second time after his loss in 2016. A Vellalar Gownder, Mr. Murugan is riding high on sympathy wave that he is well expected to garner the community votes in full. He is also expecting to garner the votes of the Muslims and the Adi Dravidars, with neither community expected to go with the AIADMK.

2021-04-07,https://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/chennai/2021/apr/07/swayed-by-sweet-potato-2286703.html,"Kannalmozhi Kabilan ByExpress News ServiceCHENNAI: The humble sweet potato, in all its weird and wobbly innocuousness, often gets a poor rep. Especially when pitted against, rather unfairly, the universally loved potato. While madhura kizhangu puzhukku and sweet potato fries have persuaded many to switch camps, it doesnt exactly top the list of favourite vegetables for too many.But, maybe it should, given that theres plenty more to this unassuming tuberous root, says Yamini, clinical dietician, Kauvery Hospital. Theres a misconception that roots and tubers are not to be consumed in large quantities because of their starch content. But, when it comes to the nutritional value, the other components like micro-nutrients also have to be kept in mind.For this, sweet potato can be consumed, explains Yamini. There are two types of the sweet potato. The one which is available in India is the orange-pinkish one; the other one is purple and not commonly available here. But, both of them have the same properties and are very good for your health. It is antiinflammatory, reduces free radicals and boosts your immune, she details.Addresses anaemiaIt is very rich in ascorbic acid, fulfilling the vitamin C part. Its also a good source of iron. If cooked with jaggery, the nutritional anaemia can be treated.Potassium powerSweet potato is a rich source of potassium. This can help manage high blood pressure, its water retention properties can regulate muscle contractions and prevent kidney stones too.Starchy but goodEven though it is a starchy vegetable with a minimal amount of carbohydrates, it minimises the absorption of sugar in the body; thanks to its good fibre content both soluble and insoluble. So, even diabeticpatients can consume it once or twice a week if their sugar level is under control.Metabolism mattersThe high fibre content also helps in maintaining gut health. It enhances the growth of beneficial bacteria in your stomach; this way, it can help treat infective diarrhoea, irritable bowel syndrome and other digestive disorders. It helps in weight gain but portion size is the key and it has to be taken appropriately.Brain foodIt is a very good source of choline an essential nutrient that enhances the brain function.Vitamin storehouseSweet potato is also very rich in beta carotene, which is the precursor for vitamin A. This vitaminis very essential in all stages of life, playing a vital role in eye health.Rich in antioxidantsIt is filled with anthocyanins with antioxidant properties. Hence, it has to be included in everyday diet.ConsumptionA 100 grams of baked sweet potato offers 51 grams of carbohydrates, 4 grams of protein, 6 to 7 grams of fibre and very minimal fat. Otherwise, it is also rich in vitamin C and B6, magnesium, etc. The best way to consume sweet potato is to steam/bake it and have it with jaggery or slight seasoning. It can also be made as a regular south Indian curry or poriyal, with tomato and onions and spices.Sweet potato is not given much importance on the plate. But, you should try to include it regularly in your diet. In layman terms, it just looks like the pancreas the shape of the tuber. And Mother Nature has given it all these properties too. That depicts that it is very good for your vital organ, pancreas, she concludes.",Swayed by sweet potato,TOMATO
2021-04-08,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/mocktail-india-trends-2021-premiumisation-innovation-better-ingredients/article34271677.ece,"Bartenders across India chat about how the re-emerging bar culture sees bigger demand for more innovative, premium mocktailsEager to just step out, people find that the significance of a bar has evolved for them over the past year. For a growing number of Indians; it is not so much about swigging a few beers or throwing back a few shots, but more about enjoying the change of scenery and revelling in a non-alcoholic drink.Unfortunately, the virgin tag in the drinks space has so far come with a green light for compromise. Most virgin mojitos just have dollops of sugar syrup, while some virgin cucumber gimlets comprise lime juice with chunks of cucumber at best.Thankfully, consumers are now empowered more than ever to ask for a premiumisation of mocktails: that is to say, ones without sugar rush-inducing ingredients and stacks of ice. In response, bartenders rise to this challenge and admit that non-alcoholic beverages have shot into prominence.Sidecar founder and mixologist Yangdup Lama | Photo Credit: special arrangementThough Yangdup Lama first opened his famous Delhi bar Sidecar in August 2018, they did not have a liquor license until December of that year. So the place kicked off with a mocktail menu, which seemed risky. However, looking back at those first few months, he says innovating on mocktails was liberating rather than restricting, and he and his team of trusted bartenders loved the process so much that they retained that mocktails menu to this day.Read More | All about Sidecar, the only Indian bar in 2020 Asias Best 50 list, and its creatorWe get people coming in during the day for those mocktails, he explains. One of our popular ones is made of bel or wood apple  such a fantastic fruit in so much abundance  and we opened up that conversation around the bels versatility. This is mind, the demand for mocktails is also based on the typical growth mindset in that people always want something more. Other much-loved mocktails at Sidecar include a velvet spice (a concoction of black grapes, redberry puree and lime, with a dash of chilli) and walk on the street (grapefruit, turmeric shrub with orange and mint soda).A long-time inequality, resolvedFlair bartender Ami Shroff crafting a drink using chillies | Photo Credit: Ami Shroff / InstagramMumbai-based flair bartender and TEDx speaker Ami Shroff points out that for people who drink alcohol, there are many choices in terms of the base, a whiskey, a cognac or even a beer  and then for each base, there are countless possibilities. However, in the mocktail space, options are limited to mainly juices and aerated waters. This inequality has been long predominant at bars and restaurants across the country, and she is glad it is changing. Cocktails obviously have a bigger price bracket and get more attention, so that explains the heavier focus on them at some places, she states.Interestingly, Ami points out that many of Indias bartenders receive training from liquor brand ambassadors, so their repertoire primarily comes with boozy elements. There is not much focus on how flavours would work without alcohol. The same goes for a lot of bartending schools. Automatically, the bartenders are just attuned to fixing cocktails, she reflects. The good thing is, as the experience across customers is evolving, so will that of the bartenders.Ami predicts that bars will have more training sessions, specifically around flavour combinations in the non-alcoholic space. When a drink does not have such a component, the profile changes significantly. So bartenders will have to look into the good and bad of flavour compensation a lot more. As an example, she says Bloody Mary can easily be made non-alcoholic by enhancing the tomato flavours without offering the customer too much acidity.The growing mocktail mania has seen Yangdup working with different companies such as Jimmys Cocktails, making ready-to-make mixes in a mocktail format. In the next few months, people can look forward to more such companies releasing these non-alcoholic packages, he puts forth. These companies would also be making sure that one can add alcohol if they like to the same mix, to help people be more experimental at home which has been much of the new normal, post-pandemic.Going mainstream Big conglomerates have launched mocktail lines too. In 2019, Coca Cola foresaw the trend and launched their Bar None range, featuring sangria, bellini spritz, dry aged cider and ginger mule flavoured mocktails.More recently, in February, Pepsi launched Neon Zebra canned mocktails in margarita, strawberry daiquiri, mojito and whiskey sour variants.These companies, including &Stirred, Tea Trunk and Mixtale, appeal not just to big metro cities, but also to smaller towns where there are few opportunities to try a good mocktail or a cocktail.Of flavour and soulA juggler and flair bartender, Ami is no stranger to the theatre of the bar, but insists that the success of a drink comes down to its flavour and soul.Will this shift in consciousness affect how a restaurant or bars supply chain operates? Ideally, it should not. There is a misconception that making a mocktail is a no-brainer. But clearly, that is not the case, considering how so many mocktails have been a let-down for such a long time. Both Ami and Yangdup say the same knowledge of techniques, flavour combinations and presentation to make a cocktail should be used to craft a mocktail.Owing to premiumisation, Indias drinking crowd is more ingredient-conscious now; going far beyond ordering a drink just by the name but understanding and often predicting how a combination of elements would taste together in a single sip. People are asking bartenders when a juice within a drink was made, if it is freshly-squeezed or packaged. The communication between the customer and bartender has changed, specifies Yangdup.It is one thing to hear how mocktails are successful for bartenders reaching a new demographic, but we want to know what mocktails they actually drink. Yangdup favours any drink combination of kaffir limes, and mangoes makes him happy. Meanwhile, Ami chuckles and says she loves a good virgin Bloody Mary.",Hold the alcohol! 2021 will be the year of mocktails,TOMATO

They had got some soft, sesame seed topped buns, and ordered pork patties from Meatigo.I began dreaming about this: creamy mayo slathered over a piece of bun, onion rings, perhaps a slice of tomato over it. A juicy patty on that, a crisp lettuce leaf and another soft bun on top. The problem was that we didnt have any buns, and it was too late to have them delivered.But burgers had been promised to two young people at home  one visiting Delhi for the first time. So, I turned to my good friend, the internet, and chanced upon a place called Boss Burger. I liked the different kinds of burgers it offered, and was further encouraged by the fact that it has branches across the city. With the help of Swiggy, we placed our order.The youngsters like chicken, so for them we asked for two OG Chicken Burgers (518 for two). They are also fond of hot food, so we added a Crispy Peri Peri Chicken Burger (299). A Crispy Fish Fillet Burger (349) and what seemed rather interesting  a Mutton Ghee Roast Burger (369).The burgers arrived just when the mice in the stomach had started kicking up a real shindy. The boxes were encouraging  strong, well packed cartons, which contained the burger, as well as sauces and napkins. Without much ado, we got down to business.The young ones were happy with their burgers  brioche wrapped around melted cheese and chicken topped with a hot sauce. The hot peri peri chicken was even better. The chicken and cheese patty had been doused with garlic aioli and a spicy sauce. The fish fillet burger, which came with tartar sauce, was disappointing. The patty was crisp from the outside, but sadly soggy within.My mutton ghee roast burger, however, was delicious, with its fusion flavours. The patty had been prepared in the Mangalorean style  slow cooked and then garnished with curry leaf flavoured mayo. It had a taste of soft onions that I really liked, and, overall, the patty cooked with Indian spices went rather well with the soft, bland buns.My last happy burger meal was when I had ordered in from Akus, which has some outstanding burgers with blue cheese, wild mushrooms, jalapenos, caramelized onions and more.Boss Burgers menu is comprehensive, too. For vegetarians, it offers Aloo Rataloo (sweet potato patty with mozzarella cheese, garlic aioli and chutney), Spicy BBQ Paneer, Quinoa & Veggie (quinoa-crusted roasted root vegetable patty, topped with sriracha mayo and saunth chutney) and Holy Guacamole!

Prakash Kammaradi.It is the first time in the history of the country that fertilizer prices have seen a hike of nearly 58%, accounting for an increase of 1,400 a quintal.Dr. Kammaradi, who had commissioned studies related to cost of production for various crops in Karnataka in his capacity as KAPC chairman, said increase in fertilizers cost would almost neutralise the cushion being provided by minimum support prices with respect to a few crops, including paddy.Citing an example, he said the paid out costs, which include not just cost of production but also rental value of land and family labour, is already much higher than the revenues earned by farmers with respect to several crops, including paddy.According to him, the cost of production of paddy on one acre is 37,578 of which the fertilizers alone cost 7,314 as there is a requirement of about 400 kg. Of this, the DAP and NPK, which have seen hike in prices, account for 50% of quantity. This would mean there would be a jump of about 2,800 to 3,000 per acre of paddy. Pointing out that farmers get 27 to 28 quintals of paddy per acre on an average, he says, production cost would go up by a minimum of 100 per quintal of paddy.With actual paid out cost of paddy already high at 52,453 per acre, the present fertilizer price hike would only increase the financial burden and make cultivation of various crops almost financially unviable despite MSPs, he argued.Similarly, the growers of elakki variety of banana spend about 16,429 per acre of plantation on fertilizers alone. Now, these expenses would increase, he pointed out. Same was the case of cotton where 333 kg of fertilisers is used per one acre. Even vegetable and fruits growers have been hit hard. According to an estimate, 290 kg of fertilizers is required for growing tomato on one acre of land while 505 kg of fertilizers is needed for growing dry chillies on one acre.Even dairy farmers, who are struggling since milk procurement prices were reduced on account of COVID-19, are expected to be hit hard as a majority are dependent on fertilizers for cultivation of fodder. Dr. Kammaradi argued for restoring full quantum of subsidy that was being given for fertilisers to bail them out.",‘Hike in fertilizer prices will neutralise cushion of MSPs’,TOMATO

For instance, Roojam said, against a normal purchase of 15 kg of flour in foreign countries, people would start storing 50 kg flour, and similarly other products.This created a lot of demand, especially when the eateries were closed during the lockdown and people started buying ready to eat products in large quantity, Roojam said, adding that there were initial hiccups when the transportation took a hit due to lockdown last year, but once the restrictions were eased, the export of Markfed products registered a sharp increase.There was a lot of demand from countries like US, UK and Australia, said Roojam.The jump in exports.

Another reason for dry skin is diabetic neuropathy i.e. damage to the never endings, especially of legs and feet. Dry skin tends to become itchy and when we itch, it leads to cracks, providing an easy opening for infectious elements to enter the skin leading to inflammations, redness, and irritation on the skin.*People with diabetes are more prone to fungal infections. Red, itchy rash accompanied with blisters and scales appears on the folds and warm areas of the body such as in between toes, in the fold of elbows or the armpits, corners of mouth etc. The common fungal infections in diabetic people are candida albicans, ringworm, athletes foot, jock itch, and recurring vaginal yeast infection.*People with diabetes suffer from more bacterial infections than people without the condition. Boils, folliculitis, styes on eyelids, carbuncles, and infections around the nails are common in diabetics.*Necrobiosis Lipoidica are small solid bumps that appear on the skin. They look similar to pimples but if ignored they turn into patches of swollen and hard skin with a yellow or reddish-brown colour. Other indications are shiny skin surrounding the bumps, painful itchy skin, and visible blood vessels.*Acanthosis nigricans is a pre-diabetes condition in which the skin of the armpits, groin, or neck turns very dark, thick, and velvety.

I follow social media very actively and almost everyone was posting things related to COVID and every minute, my mobiles notification was related to it only by which I started getting depressed and I started overthinking on everything which actually took me to the stage of mental breakdown and I had no one to share these feelings with as I had to take care of my family as well.I developed severe chest pain and headache, which I thought was not related to COVID and I took it very lightly. It continued till 2-3 days and I still ignored it. Surprisingly, I got a fever the next morning and lost the sense of smell and taste. My headache was so dangerous that I had tears in my eyes all the while and turned me into an insomniac. The throat pain felt as if someone was holding my neck hard and not letting me breathe. I had a scratchy throat, and a fever, with this sweeping kind of fatigue. The new mutation of the second wave is more dangerous and deadly. Also, I lost almost 5-6 kgs in a week, so weight loss is also a symptom that I witnessed. I immediately consulted my doctor who advised certain medications, given to all COVID patients. I had a lot of pain in my chest due to cough so I took steam thrice a day which gave me some relief. I have done meditation almost daily to stay positive, mental health is really important for us. I believe 40 % of the people are losing their minds by watching negativity going around in the world and I am one of them.I didnt realise how the quarantine period passed as in this state, I was cooking food for my family and other household work as we had sent back our servants so that they can stay safe. I used to wake up around 8 a.m in the morning and till 10pm at night I had to take care of myself and my family single handedly. Somehow I managed to do meditation daily just to calm myself and ignore the negative thoughts running in my head all the time. I used to watch a lot of videos related to COVID before sleeping on how to get the sense of smell and taste back. I truly believe that God has been with me in this and gave me a lot of will power to fight against COVID alone and also take care of my family...Dietary precautionsI consulted a nutritionist so that I can take a balanced diet. Early in the morning I used to take lukewarm lemon water with 1/4 tablespoon of giloy stave from Baidyanath with 5 almonds and 2 dates and one tablespoon chyawanprash. In breakfast I used to eat besan halwa and after an hour 2-3 kiwis. In lunch I used to eat khichdi/ biryani, either of them and after an hour one cup of green tea with 2 pieces of dates. In the evening, tomato soup and papaya were the best combination for energy. Then for dinner, I just had haldi milk. This diet can help everyone to stay fit while they recover from COVID.While I am on my road to recovery, I want to tell all COVID+ patients to not give up on hope. Yes, the situation is bad, but nothing can be stronger than your willpower. That's the biggest weapon in hand to fight coronavirus. Talking to yourself, positive thoughts will help you recover. Don't let the negative thoughts rent space in your head. As I would say, start masking your ears too and protect yourself from all kinds of negative energies.","COVID: ""I had terrible throat pain and insomnia""",TOMATO

This season is also known for its bountiful supply of tropical fruits. When we talk about fruits during summer, we think of mango, pineapple, watermelon or litchi. These fruits, when carefully paired with compatible spirits, make for a great refreshing and cooling drink on a warm summer day. Summer cocktails usually bring to mind the picture of a serene sea, salt air and swaying coconut trees.When it comes to popular drinks during these times, the pina colada is the most common. This drink expresses the beautiful flavours of pineapple and coconuts paired with rum.Another option is an iced drink like a frozen daiquiri, paired with summer fruits like mangoes, watermelon, strawberries or even passion fruit. Theres also a nice pitcher of sangria, which can be consumed with a choice of fruit chunks in them to nibble on at the end of a glass.Some of us love summer just because its the season for mangoes, the king of fruits. Adding some chunks of mangoes in your drink or pairing it with certain herbs to elevate the freshness of the drink is also a refreshing option. Some fruits also have added benefits in the guise of healthy minerals and vitamins.Watermelon, for instance, is a great source of vitamin A and C, and one can pair it with rum, vodka or gin to make an invigorating cocktail that could prevent skin damage due to the summer sun, which could really ruin a holiday! Another beautiful summer fruit to use in cocktails is the humble guava.This is my favourite. Replacing guava juice for tomato juice in a traditional Bloody Mary gives it that unusual tang and is my perfect trick to beat the summer heat. Cheers!

Aside from all the tweaks thatll go on over the vaulting table, Pranatis palate will now be conditioned to trade the machher jhol (fish curry) for the sashimi twice a week.Our athletes always run into this problem: they struggle for food abroad and then mentally they keep thinking theyve not eaten properly and are not prepared for competition. Pranati will need to get used to having Japanese meals, so 2 or 3 days in a week, well start her off on the food she might end up eating in Tokyo, coach Lakhan Sharma says, of Indias latest and only qualifier in gymnastics at the Olympics, picked for the four apparatus of All Around competition.Thats an astonishing amount of detailing worked out quickly, considering what has been a surprise qualification for the Tokyo Games.With a bunch of tournaments cancelled  including the Asian meet at Hangzhou, China for this week  qualification came down to Pranatis results at the last World Championship.READ | Pranati Nayak follows in Dipa Karmakars footstepsSneaking in as the second reserve from Asia, the 26-year-old from Midnapore in West Bengal who won bronze in the vault at the Asian Championships in March 2019, has a coach who makes it a point to keep himself updated with international trends.Theres just two months left so well only polish the old routines on Floor exercise, Balance beam and Uneven Bars. But shell go there with all the upgrades, says the geeky mentor, hailing from Ujjain, posted at Kolkata as coach.An order was placed for a tome on techniques, titled Championship Gymnastics penned by Gerald George and illustrated by James Stephenson, costing Rs 30,000 as soon as it became clear to Sharma that Pranati had a chance to get to Tokyo.Natural flairShes a strong gymnast whos very hardworking. But shes also a natural, shell go further than people expect her to, Sharma says with a coachs conviction, hoping to use the definitive text to polish a couple of her elements at the Olympics.To that effect, hes weaning her away from her mobile phone  only Saturday/Sunday, shell be allowed  he says.While a physio, masseur and nutritionist will assemble to fine-tune Pranatis preparation as the SAI arena opens its facility only for her, the chef is choosing his best knives for the usu-zukuri, the fine cuts.Kolkatas SAI facility had proven a charm for Pranati nearly 20 years ago, though the earliest Samaritan in her career wasnt the chef, googling how to make Sushi in SAIs cavernous kitchens.Dileep uncle still narrates the story with my father filling in the details, Pranati starts. They rejected me saying I was too thin and said Ill trip on the apparatus. So they told my father to take me back, saying iska nahi hoga (she cant be admitted), she laughs.Pranati Nayak with her father Sumanta Nayak Pranati Nayak with her father Sumanta NayakSumanta Nayak had wept when the coach at Kolkatas training centre told him that his 8-year-old gymnast daughter would not make it in the sport and had no place in the hostel. They said, wo gir jaaegi (she will fall). They had not seen her jump and spin and cartwheel around the house. My girl was strong and always landed on her feet. Usme bahut hunar tha. (She was very talented.) When they said that she wouldnt be taken into the hostel, I couldnt control my tears, he recalls.Thats when Dileep, a helper assigned to clean the apparatus and fetch tea, had seen the bawling father break down on the road, and guided him to Ms Sushmita, the leading official at the centre. Sushmita would put in a word with the nurturing coach, Minara Begum, who would take on Pranatis responsibility completely.She never complained, but while her parents would travel 100km to bring her to training while she waited for a hostel, I knew that she was also doing a lot of housework where she stayed. I decided to take charge of her career, the now-retired coach recalls.Besides the leotards with frills that she fixed for Pranati and taking care of her education and meals (since she was extremely thin, though not frail), Minara would also equip her with skills, sponged up by the eager learner.From the springboard, theres a forward salto on the beam. I taught her that very early on  because she was sincere and would learn meticulously, the coach recalls of the tiniest of headstarts for her ward. Others in India are doing it only now.Its on the vault though that Pranati will look to carry forward the baton from Rio 4th-placer Dipa Karmakar. It was Indias second World Cup medallist, Aruna B Reddy, also a vaulter, in fact who alerted Pranati to the chance of making it to Tokyo last week. Pranatis Handspring forward 540 (difficulty 5.8) and Tsukahara back 720 (D: 5.6) have been her reliable routines that she hopes to land perfectly  banking on the staple if not the spectacular  a la Karmakar. On the Floor, Pranati  a hobby dancer  has a trippy sequence where her acrobatic lines blend into some bop to the Dom and Tak beats of Maashallah from the hit film Ek Tha Tiger.Its on the beam and vault though that Pranati truly finds her rhythm.Sumanta Nayak and wife Pratima knew their second daughter had a future in gymnastics when she repurposed all surfaces in their house to spin and whirl right since they dropped her off at a gymnastics club, one amongst hundreds that dot Bengal  even the rural non-descript towns.READ | Pranati Nayak vaults to a bronze at Asian meet: For my father, a bus driverOlder sister Jayati and younger Tapti got busy with books, but Pranati couldnt stop cartwheeling around. Her father, who moved from Jharkhand to Bengal and drove a bus to make ends meet, was supremely confident that his second daughter had what it took.Ill be honest. After three daughters, I felt a little bad about not having a son. But Pranati showed so much talent that I knew she is going to go further than any male child I mightve had. I was convinced she was special. Thats why it was important that the Kolkata centre accepted her. She needed a good diet I could see, but only a sports hostel couldve provided for her. Part reason I cried (when she was turned down) was I couldnt do much for her if she didnt get into the training centre, the father remembers.Prodigious talentCoach Minara Begum was impressed with the bridges and forward and back somersaults of the 9-year-old. She would shepherd her career with her own diligence from 2003, and while India was just acquainting itself with Dipas scary vault, Minara would keep Pranati on the conventional path  nothing eye-popping, just gymnastics basics, executed to the best of her ability.Pranati Nayak with former coach Minara Begum Pranati Nayak with former coach Minara BegumPranati wouldnt forget about the family that had revolved its routine around ferrying her to and fro from practice  at times 4-hour rickety bus rides to Kolkata. So the Rs 12 lakh she earned from the Nationals two years ago saw her build a slightly bigger house in Midnapore and take entire responsibility for her older sisters wedding couple of years ago.Her first medal had come at Childrens Asiad in Russia, while she would make the All Around finals (4th on Beam & 5th on vault) of the 2014 Asian Games alongside Dipa.Pranati Nayak bronze medal winning Vault from 8th Senior Artistic Gymnastics Asian Championship, Ulaanbaatar Mongolia.

I was disappointed at the World meet, so I spent all of the lockdown keeping in shape and not going out of training for a single day, she says.It meant her father would fix a bamboo horizontally across two trees  for her to do the simple swings that were part of her weakest apparatus  the uneven bars. Olympics wasnt on my training plan then  this was unexpected. I wanted to do well at the CWG in Birmingham, Pranati says. Somewhere, I think, that hard work paid off. Even now with everything closed, Lakhan sir ensures I get training, Pranati says.Sharma had been lining up practice at different clubs  in Bally, Patuli and Dum Dum, with Pranati travelling for up to an hour and 40 minutes to clock one session of practice wherever possible.Pranati Nayak with with coach Lakhan Sharma Pranati Nayak with with coach Lakhan SharmaLakhan Sharma would message his trainees  and the club owners would open up their facilities for the international gymnast, twice a week, to enable her to practise when SAI was closed. You have to understand what gymnastics means to Bengal. Even the smallest towns have gymnastics clubs with basic infrastructure, nothing fancy. Its in the culture, even rurally, thats why its not a surprise Pranatis father saw a future for her in this sport. A lot of girls from Bengal as well as the Northeast are suited for this sport. They arent very tall, so lower centre of gravity, he says. But moreover, people here are extremely creative and artistic. Its great to work with gymnasts who understand the art in this sport, he says.Sharma says little girls training hard at clubs dotting Bengals remote geography were bound to throw up a winner, though the pandemic serendipitously picked Pranati.Fine angles define perfection in gymnastics.

Desperate pleas for oxygen, medicines and vaccination slots have become dominant everyday conversations. Amid this raging chaos, while the role of healthcare industry intensifies, it is the non-profit sector that has as always stepped up, providing relief material and ration for scores of families affected by COVID- 19.And one such NGO doing their part is Aranya Foundation that recently started a free service to deliver fresh meals at the doorstep of COVID-19 patients. When health is compromised, even the simpler things in life a good meal, for example is a stressful task, be it for a homemaker and their family or someone living alone. Shilpam Kapur Rathore, founder of Aranya Foundation, witnessed this firsthand when the virus kept her friend confined to the bed. She had to quarantine in a room in her house. Thats when I realised that many are affected by the lack of a homemakers presence in the kitchen.They end up ordering in food, which may not necessarily aid in recovery and healing. It is a fifteen- day struggle. Since the foundation has experience in providing nutritious, healthy, simple meals, we thought well start this for COVID-19 patients free of cost, shares Shilpam. With this intent, through her Foundation, Shilpam is providing 2,000 meals a day to the patients and their families in Kilpauk, Anna Nagar, Nungambakkam, Mylapore and Adyar.Patients can contact their helpline handled by four professionals one day in advance and place the order. Simple, healthy food like sambar and rice, variety rice with pickle, or tomato rice prepared by 18 people at the Radha Soami Satsang Beas, is packed in a disposable container and delivered to customers via Delhivery. The raw materials for the meals are funded by the donations received by the Foundation. On May 11, their first day of the initiative, the Foundation received requests for 1,500 meals.Besides following the hygiene protocols, offering fresh food is a non-negotiable for Shilpam. All the kitchen workers are equipped with hairnets, masks, and gloves, and have taken the RT-PCR test. This is the Foundations second initiative during the pandemic. Last year, at the time of the lockdown, they aided citybased class 11 student, Arnav Rathore, in providing a weeks worth of dry ration to the homes of 800 senior citizens free of cost. They also distributed over 20,000 meals to migrant workers in Chennai with the help of Radha Soami Satsang Beas.Their work has no borders. With Delhi gasping for breath owing to the dearth of oxygen cylinders, the Foundation organised a bus with 10 oxygen concentrators for the North Delhi Municipal Corporation. I feel all of us have the power to make a change. When I started out on my mission of Annandhanam in 2015, I just made one meal for one woman on the streets. Then she said there are so many like her. I made 20 and then realised there are 100. Its a moment that sparks a movement, says Shilpam. Amen to that!To order, call 42997501. RTPCR results must be provided.

This Saturday, about 5,000 tonnes of vegetables arrived at the market, but 50% remained sold.S Chandran, secretary of Federation of Wholesale Vegetable Market Associations, said that about 20% of unsold vegetables including brinjal (eggplant), ladies finger (okra) and tomato may go waste. Last Saturday (May 8), nearly 99% of the vegetables that arrived were sold out, while it was 80% during the previous Saturday. But, the sudden announcement over slashing the working hours for retail stores led to traders decreasing their purchase on Saturday, he said.

(Representational image)The lack of predictability in the functioning of wholesale vegetable markets in the country, on account of variabilities in the lockdowns in different states and the closing of retail outlets, hotels, hostels and marriage halls, has resulted in large quantities of tomatoes going unsold in the Kolar APMC market, which is the second largest tomato market in Asia.Crates of tomatoes were dumped by the roadside in the Kolar region this week after they went unsold in the APMC market which supplies tomatoes at this time of the year to markets all over India. A video of the dumping of tomatoes was circulated on social media.We checked on the dumping of tomatoes on the sides of the road and found that they were tomatoes that had remained unsold at the APMC market on account their quality, Kolar district Deputy Commissioner Dr R Selvamani said.We asked our officials to find out and we learnt that out of the 1,200 tonnes of tomato which arrived at the Kolar APMC on Wednesday, as much as 70 tonnes were unsold because they were considered to be of low quality, the Kolar DC added.The APMC tomato market in Kolar is the main supplier of tomatoes to states like West Bengal, UP, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and also for exports to countries such as Bangladesh, Pakistan, Afghanistan and China.Also Read | Chamarajanagar oxygen tragedy: Karnataka govt announces Rs 2 lakh compensation for victims familiesDuring the current season when farmers have cultivated large tracts of land with tomato in anticipation of good prices, the uncertainties in markets around the country created by the lockdowns has resulted in miscalculations in the timing of the harvesting of crops and a glut in the market, resulting in tomatoes losing quality and saleability, APMC traders said.Tomato is cultivated in as much as 10,000 acres of land in the Kolar district and tomato produce from as many as five districts in south Karnataka is received at the Kolar APMC tomato market. In recent days, during the ongoing lockdown to prevent the spread of Covid-19, the quantity of tomatoes arriving at the market has been between 1,200 to 1,700 tonnes.On the day when the videos of dumping of tomatoes on the side of the road emerged this week, as much as 1,600 tonnes of tomato had been received at the market. On Saturday, over 3,500 tonnes of tomato arrived at three APMC markets in the Kolar district, according to data for the crop provided by the online data system of the APMCs.The tomato produce has been nearly four times more than previous seasons because farmers were expecting good prices and sales. The disruption of the market by the lockdown has meant that some of the produce goes unsold for a few days and then their quality deteriorates and they end up commanding no prices at all, said C R Srinath, a tomato trader at the Kolar APMC market for tomatoes. Good tomatoes were going at about Rs 200 for a 15 kg box but fourth and fifth quality tomatoes fetch only a few rupees for a 15 kg box, he said.The key to getting good prices is in the timing of the harvest. The crops need to be harvested two days before they are taken to markets in states like West Bengal and UP. What is happening now due to the lockdowns is that farmers are not getting clear information on the days when markets in other states will be open. This has resulted in produce coming to the market long before they can be transported and losing quality, Srinath added.Another reason for the wastage of tomato crops this season is the fact that retail sales is restricted due to the lockdown and the hotels, hostels and marriage halls are all shut. There is excess crop and less demand, the trader said.Incidences of wastage of the tomato crop are frequently reported from the Kolar APMC due to the vagaries of the market. The lockdown in 2020 also created similar problems.","Karnataka: With lockdowns in many states, large quantities of tomatoes go unsold in Kolar market",TOMATO

Growers, who normally sell their market ready vegetable at around Rs 10-15 per kg are now forced to sell it at an average price of Rs 2-4 per kg.Ajit Korade, a sugarcane and vegetable grower from the village of Nirewadi in Phaltan taluka of Satara district had taken the crop over three of his total 70 acres of holding. The average price he received from Vashis wholesale market in Navi Mumbai was just Rs 4 per kg. This is a complete wash out for us as the cost of production of top quality crop is Rs 10 per kg, he said. To top this, Korade had to throw away 40 tonnes of the vegetable, the first pick from his crop early in April, as an unknown virus had led to fruit damage. The per acre yield of summer tomato is around 20-35 tonnes.Vegetable growers in Maharashtra normally take two crops of tomato from farmers of Niphad taluka in Nashk, growing mainly the kharif crop. Farmers, from Pune and Satara, take the crop during the summer season on assured irrigation. The summer crop fetches a better premium than the kharif crop but the cost of production of the summer crop is higher.The harvest season of the summer crop this time has coincided with covid-19 related lockdowns, thereby crashing crop prices across markets.Farmers like Korade, who deal directly with the Vashis wholesale market said they at least had market access while others were forced to give up their plot for good. Traders in Vashi market cited the closure of retail markets and prices dropped drastically, he said. Superior quality produces which other wise would have commanded Rs 15 per kg is now being sold at Rs 4 per kg.This price slide, Korade said, came at a time when farmers in Pune and Satara had increased their tomato acreage in anticipation of good prices in the summer season.Last year, farmers had suffered from the attack of a virus on the crop as well as lack of market while this year the markets have collapsed. Korade also highlighted out how retail prices in urban centres like Pune and Mumbai have not seen much reduction even though wholesale prices have collapsed.Farmers like Korade said alternate market chains like direct to customers is not feasible for them. On an average our daily yield is around 3 tonnes so there is no question for us to sell it directly to consumers, he said. This low prices, Korade said would led him to default on his bank loans and he would be forced to turn to private money lenders to raise finances this kharif. Stay updated with the latest Pune news.

A chilled watermelon feta salad with mint garnish for lunch on a hot summer day or a Subway chicken teriyaki salad bowl is all you need for a hearty meal.Salads are refreshing, easy to make and nutritious. In summers, nutrient-rich yet tasty food is a good way to keep your health in check, especially when a lot of people are working from home. Quinoa, for example, is a rich source of protein, essential minerals, and amino-acids which regulate your body function.

These are very light and prevent you from dozing off in your chair. Summer salads, paired with a good workout plan, will help you shed those pandemic pounds easily. Otherwise, include a salad as a side dish to your meal or snack time and you will be able to inculcate the necessary veggies and hearty greens into your diet effortlessly.Mansi Patel, a nutritionist based in Hyderabad, says, Salads are a good source of fibre, which helps relieve constipation. Salad bowls usually contain a rich source of protein, a healthy amount of fat and veggies that contain vitamins and minerals. For people who are watching their weight during the lockdown or those who want to improve their strength, salads are the easiest and most beneficial.Everyone loves a salad at a restaurant but a lot of us will not touch lettuce unless it is in a delicious burger. The creamy and savoury dressings make all the difference to a salad bowl. Be it any sauce -- a tangy BBQ or a refreshing mint mayonnaise or a basic mixture of mustard, honey, and vinegar -- salad dressings add flavour and zing to your greens. Some of the sauces that are available on e-commerce platforms are mint mayonnaise, BBQ, chipotle southwest dressing, sriracha sauce and honey mustard, among others.Instead of boring yourself with a standard salad dressing, which will eventually make you give in to cravings, mix and match various dressings and sauces.

As a result, while transport costs skyrocketed, prices crashed so severely that he decided not to harvest the crop at all.The price offered was not even the quarter of what he would need to meet the costs. If I sell at these rates, I will incur heavy losses considering what it costs to harvest and transport. So I am feeding the ladies finger to my cattle. As for the onions, I have asked the labourers to harvest and take home as much as they want for free, Mr. Rama told The Hindu.Produce dumpedThis is the story of many farmers across Karnataka. A video clip of a watermelon grower in Sagar, Shivamogga, destroying his crop in frustration was widely shared. There was another of a jasmine grower dumping his harvest on the streets in the district, cursing the administration for the lockdown. Many tomato growers in Kolar and Chickballapur recently protested by throwing their produce on the street.A kilo of tomato was selling at less than 2, which wouldnt have even recovered my transport cost, leave alone my investment. So I abandoned the crop at the market and returned, said Adi Reddy, a tomato farmer from Kolar.The fall in demand for vegetables, fruits and flowers, the disruption of transport networks, and high transport costs following the Statewide lockdown imposed for the past three weeks have hit these farmers hard.Despite the lockdown guidelines clearly allowing free movement of all cargo, transport networks have been disrupted, especially inter-district and inter-State ones.For two weeks, vegetables were not being sent out of the State. This has now been resolved. The price of tomatoes improved to 7 to 9 a kg only after the supply to other States, including West Bengal and Bangladesh, resumed, said G. Srinivasan, a farmer from Nandi and a member of HOPCOMS. He also said transport operators were charging several times more than usual, citing the lockdown, police harassment, and skyrocketing diesel prices.

This was a rather egregious example, Leonard said.Both the State Department and Labor Department have also documented abusive conditions in the Chinese fishing industry, where mostly foreign crews often work 18 to 22 hours per day under abysmal conditions.US authorities have used the Tariff Act of 1930 to halt imports from specific companies, individual fishing vessels and all cotton and tomato products from the Xinjiang region of China, where the Chinese government is waging a brutal assimilation campaign against Uyghurs and other predominantly Muslim ethnic groups.The announcement Friday marks the first time that the US has sought to block imports from a companys entire fishing fleet, a sign that the CBPs investigation found evidence of widespread abuse on Dalian vessels around the world.Indonesias government in May 2020 accused the company of inhuman treatment of fishermen from that country, with dozens of men forced to work 18 hours a day for no pay or less than agreed upon.It said the conditions led to illnesses that killed at least three fishermen, whose bodies were cast overboard into the Pacific Ocean.Dalian did not immediately respond to a request for comment made through its website.The company has had recent financial troubles, but Leonard said it appears to be reorganizing and planning to resume operations. We need to be vigilant, he said.",US blocks seafood from Chinese fleet over alleged crew mistreatment,TOMATO
2021-05-29,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/unsold-and-underpriced/article34678076.ece,"All sections of farmers, be it paddy, chilli or vegetable growers, are forced to resort to distress sale owing to COVID-19-induced conditions, and subject themselves to exploitation of middlemen who deny them MSPBumper yields have failed to bring cheer to the farmers in the State as lack of marketing and transportation dashed their hopes of getting a good return on their investment. Restrictions in place on movement within and outside the State to contain the spread of COVID-19 pandemic have adversely impacted farmers, with vegetable growers taking a big hit.According to information, the minimum support price (MSP) or remunerative price has remained elusive for paddy, tomato, banana and other crops, with even recovery of investment remaining doubtful in some cases.Paddy is cultivated in 8.81 lakh hectares in the State during rabi with an estimated production of around 61.89 lakh metric tonnes (MT). The government has opened 1,441 paddy purchase centres across the State but the procurement remained at 32.10 lakh MT as on May 27.In the first place, there are no proper transportation facilities. Secondly, payments are delayed by the government. As a result, farmers are forced to sell their produce below the MSP, says K.V.V. Prasad, State general secretary, AP Ryotu Sangham. Farmers are selling away the produce at 1,200 to 1,400 per quintal against the MSP of 1,888 for A grade variety and 1,868 for a common variety, he adds.Procurement not hitAccording to the Andhra Pradesh Civil Supplies Corporation officials, however, it is too early to say that the COVID-19 restrictions have impacted the procurement process. The procurement will increase but the numbers cant be specified as of now, says a senior official.AP Rythu Sangham State president Y. Kesava Rao says the much-touted Rythu Bharosa Kendras (RBKs) have also failed to help farmers. Taking advantage of the situation, middlemen are paying 10% less than the fixed price besides demanding 10 kg more per bag of paddy, he adds.The situation is no better for jowar. The government has not been procuring white jowar on the ground that it was not meant for human consumption causing farmers 700-800 loss per quintal.Efforts to reach Markfed officials in this regard have not been successful.Routine holidaysSimilar is the fate of chilli farmers. The farmers are losing 3,000 to 4,000 per quintal due to the closure of the chilli marketyard at Guntur, says D. Sesha Rao, a farmer.Mirchi marketyard secretary I. Venkateswara Reddy, however, says it is a usual practice to declare holidays for the yard from May 10 but it has been advanced to May 3 due to the COVID-19 pandemic this year. Still, farmers are allowed to sell their produce outside the market through e-nam platform, he remarks.The plight of farmers who cultivated vegetables is worse. With no takers, farmers are leaving tomato and brinjal unharvested, says Chalamaiah, a farmer leader. The price has fallen to 6 a kg from 10 and above.Pulp units being encouragedMarketing officials say that pulp manufacturing units are being encouraged to buy tomato from farmers and as much as 1,625 MT has been made into puree. The department has also been buying from farmers at a minimum price of 5-6 per kg and sending it to Rythu Bazaars, says a senior official.The price of bananas, a major horticulture crop, is also on the decline.D. Janardhan, a groundnut farmer in Chittoor district, says the prices of groundnut, sugarcane and other crops are also crashing due to lack of marketing facilities. There is no check though traders have been demanding 5-6 kg extra per bag towards so-called losses, he says.Even coconut business, especially of the tender one, that sees a huge demand during the summer, has suffered due to the COVID-19 curbs. Coconut is usually exported to Odisha, West Bengal, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh. However, due to lockdown and other restrictions in many States, local traders have reduced procurement citing difficulties in transportation.Farmers associations say that the COVID-19 pandemic has aggravated the problems caused due to system failure.",Unsold and underpriced,TOMATO
2021-06-02,https://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/chennai/2021/jun/02/keeping-up-with-kodo-2310489.html,"Sahana Iyer ByExpress News ServiceCHENNAI: Keeping our health in check is a priority nowadays, but its hard to resist the snacks we have readily available in our kitchens. And since no ones around to judge us when were homebound, how can one not give in to unhealthy but tasty foods? The myth that healthy is not as delicious as the greasy and the fried is easily busted by the variety of millet recipes floating on social media.A versatile ingredient to incorporate into your routine is the kodo millet, which is commonly consumed in the form of idli, dosa, pongal and upma in south India. You could even try making idiyappam, payasam, adai, or soup to experiment with the millet. When we have recipe competitions, people even prepare tasty and nutritious cookies with the millet, says Dr P V Lakshmi, chief dietitian of Gleneagles Global Health City.Known to have originated in tropical Africa, kodo millet or Paspalum scrobiculatum is believed to have been cultivated in India for 3000 years. This fibre-rich crop is quite widespread in the country, adopting a gamut of names in various languages  Kodra (Hindi and Gujarati), Varagu (Tamil), Arikelu (Telugu), and Haraka (Kannada).A drought-resistant crop, kodo can be grown on gravelly, poor soil or loamy, rich soil, in Kharif or Rabi season. The flexibility in its farming process allows it to be grown by farmers in several areas of the nation. Currently, Kodo is cultivated in Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Chhattisgarh, and the Jhum fields of Arunachal Pradesh.The crop is generally grown in warm and dry conditions, where it can survive as little as 40-50 cm rainfall. As a short crop, the millet can be harvested within 100-120 days of planting. The crops are cut close to the ground and then bundled and stacked. After a week, they are threshed and the grains are cleaned by winnowing.While there are endless ways to use millets in your diet, the transition from rice and wheat is extremely sluggish due to some misconceptions. These millets are not boring. They adopt the flavour in which we cook it. Its more like rice. You can make any dish for which you typically use rice, with millets too. Be it carrot rice, tomato rice, sambar rice etc, explains Ashwanandhini Govindarajan, a food regulatory specialist and home chef. She also shares her favourite kodo recipe.The millet is the richest source of fibre in the cereals and millets family. This and other properties of the millet lend various nutritional benefits to its consumers, as further elaborated by Dr Lakshmi.For improved digestionHigh fibre content and low fat make it effective in maintaining a healthy digestive system and help with constipation.Keeps the heart in checkHypertension or high blood pressure is a growing issue in India. Kodo helps control blood pressure and is great for those with hypertension and other cardiac patients due to its high fibre and low fat.Good for weight watchersSince the millet is rich in fibre, kodo is filling even in small quantities. Hence, those who are looking to lose weight or reduce food consumption can opt for this millet.Healthy option for kidney patientsThe millet contains low amounts of phosphorus. This makes it a great food option for kidney patients. People who require peritoneal dialysis due to kidney failure would benefit from consuming kodo.Balances blood sugarA glycemic index indicates how fast a certain food can increase blood glucose levels. With a very low glycemic index, kodo keeps a check on blood sugar and is thus, a great food source for those suf fering from diabetes.Helps those with CholelithiasisCholelithiasis or gallstone formation refers to solid masses formed in the gallbladder or biliary tract, generally due to high cholesterol. Deficient in fat content and abundant in fibre, the millet is good for those suffering from Cholelithiasis.Kodo millet pongalby Ashwanandhini Govindarajan (@ashwanandhinigovindarajan)INGREDIENTSKodo millet:  cupMoong dal: 2.5 tbspWater: 1 cup, Milk: 1 cupGrated ginger:  to 1 tspWhole peppercorn: 1 tspCumin seeds: 1  tspGhee, oil, cashews, curry leaves and salt as requiredPreparation: Soak the millet for 10 minutes before cooking.METHODCook the dal and millet in a pressure cooker on medium flame for 2  whistles.

(Bryan Denton/The New York Times)At Chongming Island just outside Shanghai, Chinas most populous city, workers collect and pack tomatoes and cucumbers at a glass greenhouse operated by Dutch company FoodVentures, which harvested their first batch of produce at the site in May.The facility is one of dozens sprouting up on the outskirts of Chinas megacities that utilise high-end technology to manage irrigation, temperature and lighting systems to grow vegetables within easy reach of a large and affluent consumer base.There is a trend towards more sustainable and professional supply, said FoodVentures director Dirk Aleven.Weve seen a huge acceleration since (the) coronavirus, it is even more important now that fresh produce is produced at the spot where its consumed. Before that, they were transported for thousands of kilometers, even within the borders of China.By far the worlds largest vegetable producer, China has used greenhouses for decades, but food supply disruptions sparked by coronavirus lockdowns in 2020 have accelerated the development of high-tech glass greenhouse facilities.To avoid future disruptions, municipal governments have said they aim to build up reserves of critical staples, and develop distribution and logistics facilities. A growing affluent middle class, willing to pay more for higher quality food produced with less pesticides, is also fueling the trend, said greenhouse developers.The area used for glass greenhouses grew 28% in 2020, well above the 5.9% rise seen in 2019, and faster than the 6% growth seen last year in areas housing cheaper plastic greenhouses, according to consultancy Richland Sources. Plastic greenhouses help shield crops, but are considered less efficient than glass greenhouses. The latter can churn out high quality produce that is sold directly to retailers, reducing reliance on traditional supply chains.We see an irreversible trend since the pandemic in consumers buying more of their groceries online, and spending more on healthier choices and agricultural brands they trust, said Lim Xin Yi, executive director of sustainability at Pinduoduo, Chinas largest e-commerce platform by users.BYPASSING THE MIDDLE MANHistorically, Chinas vegetable production was concentrated in certain areas and required complex cold chain logistics networks for food to reach major cities wholesale markets. The vulnerability of that hub-centric system became apparent in 2020. COVID-19 outbreaks at a seafood market in Wuhan  ground zero for Chinas coronavirus pandemic  and at a major fresh market in Beijing caused a breakdown in the flow of goods to consumers, leading to food shortage and crop spoilage.The pandemic has pushed the fresh food industry to reduce the number of intermediaries in its supply chain network, said Gayathree Ganesan, an analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit.Built within city limits to reduce distance to buyers, the greenhouses are usually collaborative ventures between Chinese property firms and greenhouse companies from the Netherlands, a key player in agriculture technology.FoodVentures greenhouse outside Shanghai is a typical example. Over three football fields long and two storeys high, one of the facilitys units nurtures uniform rows of cherry tomato plants that snake up towards the ceiling. It is capable of producing up to 120 tonnes a month of cherry tomatoes.Being healthy is already a first protection against any virus, so people care even more about what they eat, said Aleven. Secondly,  we want to get rid of the long logistics because we are not sure if it always works and thats what weve seen during this pandemic. Localising it as much as possible is the only answer, he added. Greenshouse-grown produce is usually sold directly to e-commerce platforms and supermarkets, bypassing the many middlemen and wholesale markets that are a traditional feature of Chinas vegetable supply chain.Carrefour China, which is 80% owned by Chinese retail giant Suning, said its cooperation with greenhouses around cities has grown steadily in the past two years to meet consumer demand.SUSTAINED EXPANSIONFurther growth in key cities is likely, with a recent government document showing Beijing aims to more than double its high-efficiency facility agriculture land to over 300 hectares by 2025.That growth could further cement Chinas status as top vegetable producer.The country already accounts for 75% or more of global output of cucumbers, green beans, spinach and asparagus. Xu Dan, CEO of greenhouse operator Beijing HortiPolaris, said his business benefited last year when a second coronavirus wave hit Beijing in June, shutting down a major wholesale market and driving his daily orders up 300%.(At that time) supermarkets were looking for growers with the ability to deliver within 24 hours and they had no time to search for new suppliers, he said.But Xu said China could face some obstacles as it leaps into modern farming.The biggest challenges are people, people who have the knowledge to manage greenhouses to produce quality vegetables, he said.Most farmers are getting old and their way of production also out of date, replacing such (a) big amount of farmers is really a big challenge.",Modern farming: Coronavirus outbreak spurs high-tech greenhouse boom in China,TOMATO

Then came the Covid-19 lockdown and the closing of educational institutes and Veni Aunty, as she is fondly called, was not only no longer able to cook at the canteen, but didnt have any other sources of income. To her gratitude, the army of students she fed werent willing to see her suffer. LSR students, current and past, have created an Instagram page for Veni Aunty home-delivery service.Das moved to Delhi from Mumbai many years ago and settled in south Delhis East of Kailash with her son. I started my life in the capital by stitching clothes at a small factory. But I got tired of it, so much so that I just didnt want to continue with that job, said the woman. I then began working as a masseuse, which was when I met Meenakshi Gopinath , who was then the principal of LSR. We bonded well because we were both south Indians in a north Indian city.It was during one of her meetings with Gopinath that Das was sounded out about starting a small south Indian food section in the college canteen. I was very happy with the idea, smiled the affable woman. I prepared a menu, and the college administration tasted my menu and visited my home to see whether I cooked in hygienic conditions. I was able to win their approval and have been serving idli sambhar, vada sambhar and lemon and tomato rice to the students.But the lockdown took a cruel toll on her finances. After so many years of regular income, I was suddenly left without a paisa in earnings. While in college, the LSR girls were always in touch with me and many would ask me if I needed help, assuring me that I neednt worry about anything, she said. But when the college closed down due to the lockdown, I didnt know who to contact for help.Recently a few students approached Das for an interview for their project. While talking to them, the topic of her lockdown problems cropped up. I told them about how I hadnt been able to earn anything and was relying on my son for money, said Das. You see, Ive always wanted to avoid asking my son for financial help. That is when the LSR girls suggested that I should start a food delivery service.The good-hearted girls helped her open an Instagram account under the tag of Veni Aunty. The account has her phone number and a small menu. It has been four days since she went online. Many students have been ordering food from me, beamed Das. Also, past students called me and said they wanted my food because they missed it from their time in college.One of the students assisting Das said when they learnt of her predicament, they decided to start a crowdfunding relief campaign for her. But others thought something that got her a regular income would be better than temporary monetary assistance. Thus began the food delivery venture  and a new lease of life.",LSR College students dish up new venture for ‘LSR aunty’,TOMATO

Kota mandal from Saturday midnight till early hours of Sunday.According to information, the herd came to a freshly-planted banana plantation at Nagireddipalle last night, and reportedly devoured over one thousand plants. Later, the herd made its way to the neighbouring village, where a vast stretch of tomato crops was destroyed. As the herd consisted of baby elephants, farmers did not venture to drive them away. A few minutes before dawn, the herd retreated into a nearby stockade of trees.A farmer, who owned one of the fields, deplored that the loss could be in several lakhs of rupees. Several farmers observed that with the fresh spell of rains since June, they hoped for good times and took to fresh plantation of banana and tomatoes. They said their entire investment was rendered waste in the jumbo raids.Meagre compensationFor a loss of over 5 lakh, the forest department would pay a meagre compensation of 5,000. In spite of our repeated requests to initiate steps for protection of croplands from such raids, or erect fences at the forest-fringes, nothing has been done, a farmer said.Divisional Forest Officer (Chittoor West) S. Ravi Shankar confirmed that a large number of wild elephants split into several herds was on the move at the tri-State junction between Kuppam and Palamaner ranges. We are trying our best to address the elephant-farmer conflict in the region, but the problem continues to persist, he said.The official denied the observations of the farmers regarding payment of compensation to the crop losses. Officials of the horticulture and agriculture departments enumerate the crop losses in the fields after the raids. We only process the compensation as per their reports and the relevant rules and regulations, Mr. Ravi Shankar said.","Elephant herd goes on a rampage, destroys crops in Chittoor",TOMATO

In the lab-scale experiments, the reduced quantity of nano-DAP fertilizer input than c-DAP promoted the early seedlings growth and development in both crops. It also led to enhanced phosphate uptake efficiency in these seedlings.Based on these promising results in the lab-scale experiments, the research team is now planning to test the efficacy of nano-DAP on tomato plants under field conditions.n-DAP in reduced doses while meeting the plants optimum P nutrient requirement would also be preferred for better soil health and agricultural sustainability, said the research team consisting of Naorem Ronald Reagan Singh, Harita Pant, research scholars at UoH; Srikanth Venkata Satya Siva Vadali and Rahul Kumar, faculty at UoH, and Sreedhara Sudhakara Sarma and Tata Narasinga Rao from ARCI, Hyderabad.While several hurdles remain to be overcome before the real potential of nano-DAP can be realised under field conditions, the researchers think its application in reduced quantity may significantly cut down on the overall input of conventional phosphorous-fertilizers currently applied in agriculture.Their work titled Cryo-milled nano-DAP for enhanced growth of monocot and dicot plants was recently published in Nanoscale Advances, a reputed scientific journal published by the Royal Society of Chemistry, UK.Chemical fertilizers application is critical to boosting crop productivity. In fact, besides improved varieties and better irrigation methods, one of the factors that contributed to the enhanced crop productivity during the green revolution and afterwards is the application of chemical nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) fertilizers. However, excessive use of these chemicals over decades has affected the soil quality.Moreover, global phosphorus reserves are finite and likely to be irreversibly exhausted in the next 100-200 years. India lacks big natural P-reserves and meets its P-fertilizers demand by importing. In this context, the research findings assume importance.","UoH, ARCI researchers develop chemically stable fertilizer",TOMATO

Among several titles, his first book in English, The Safari, centres around wildlife preservation and tiger protection in India, while his first book in Hindi is a travelogue titled Aap Biti Jag Biti.Through the Prabha Khaitan Foundation, he helps carry out various cultural activities with the aim of preserving and promoting Indias rich cultural heritage. Additionally, he is a social activist working in the field of welfare, international cultural cooperation, and the promotion and preservation of Indian arts. Excerpts from an interview:What initially drew you towards exploring diverse cultures?I have always had a penchant for travelling since my childhood and exploring new diverse cultures often provide the most worthwhile travel. I love discovering new cultures and interacting with different kinds of people and it also widens your perspective. These experiences and interactions have led me to write columns for different newspapers and my own blogs for over a decade,Could you share some interesting anecdotes about your travels across the world?The most abiding memory was from my maiden visit to Incheon, South Korea where I nearly starved.This was many years back, just before it became a destination for international conventions. Being a vegetarian, options are often quite limited in foreign shores, but in Incheon, it seemed as though the very concept of vegetarian food did not exist at that time. I survived on Korean rice and tomato puree for the entire duration of my stay. Another one is the chilling account of 9/11. I was there in New York on that ill-fated day and had watched in horror from my room as the planes flew into the twin towers. In fact, a day earlier, I had planned a visit to the North Tower in the morning with a few of my friends and UN officials, but postponed my plans when I got a call from the Indian Mission requesting I visit them. That was when I not only thanked God, but actually felt I had lived to tell the tale owing to divine intervention.As a globetrotter could you comment on the future of travel, given the pandemic?I travel a lot, almost on a weekly basis and I dont remember having stayed in one place for such a long period. Though the world is starting to get back on its feet and things are slowly returning to normal, it will never be the same. There is so much uncertainty and so many protocols to follow especially for International travel. The second wave has hit us badly, and we are recovering only now, whether it will stay this way or well experience another slump, no one knows. Travel restrictions will continue to shape in the months to come, airlines have gone into major losses, hotels cannot give you the same service anymore, but now that vaccination is out hopefully we will get there.Could you give some suggestions on preserving our culture and heritage?The younger generation must grasp the value and need for cultural and heritage preservation. While I always believe in the principle of being a global citizen, we also must learn Apni Bhasha Apne Log My various organisations carry out various cultural activities with the aim of promoting Indias heritage. We work with folk artists across India and take these events overseas to showcase the essence of India. We also started a project which aims to popularize heritage among children nationwide by weaving it into formal and informal education through student activity.Are you working on a new book?I have a new book I am working on at the moment which is on my enriching experience during my visit to Oslo, Norway.",‘I have always had a penchant for travelling’,TOMATO

Healthy eating does not mean consuming boring food; it can also be flavourful.Satisfying hungerSatisfying hunger is an important part of life, but then listening to what your mind tells you to eat, can be the key to switching to clean consumption of food. For instance, having a pizza is a good example of what one could consider as not being healthy. Opting for a healthy pizza, however, is also possible.The pizza base itself can be a bread made of whole wheat in place of refined flour, to make it a healthier option. You can lift the value and taste of the tomato sauce, cheese, herbs, olives, etc., that are a part of the toppings. Similarly, if noodles are your calling, carrots, zucchini or even radish make for tasty noodle options that are balanced and leave no scope of worry for health.Try making a healthier pizza at home.

To put it simply, it is a way of eating that provides and helps fulfill all your nutritional requirements in balance and based on what suits your body type and goal. It is about how well are you able to maintain healthy eating, while also allowing some room for treats and foods you truly enjoy; even better if made the healthy way with healthier alternatives.ALSO READ | Indians prioritise eating healthy in 2021 but wont compromise on tasteAdding valueFrench fries? How about swapping them with baked sweet potato fries or dehydrated kale chips? Even if you wish to go for fries, at least make sure the right quality of the oil is used for frying. Small shifts like these can go a long way in maintaining your health.In the past, getting over the feeling of having something sweet was tough. But now, one easy way to enjoy the sweet without compromising on health is to stick to natural sugars. Fruits, raw honey, dates, dried figs, jaggery, coconut sugar, dried raisins, etc. make for alternative options.All along, natural food products have been associated with improvements in food quality and health due to reduced pesticide residue and heavy metals compared to conventional food. This clean culture has grown on account of both the availability of 100 per cent natural food products and the time to prepare meals oneself. Both are seen as being particularly important to achieving healthier food consumption.Having said that, what we eat is just half of the story. How and how much of it, our emotional state, our relationship with food, etc. also impact how we digest, absorb, and assimilate a meal. So, its necessary to focus on each of these aspects to extract the maximum worth from a nutritional meal that has ingredients that appeal to the taste buds.The saying you are what you eat might not always strictly translate into execution, but a meal that is both healthy and delicious will always be an ideal food choice for anyone who wants to live a long, happy life.(The author is lifestyle coach, and co-founder, YouCare Lifestyle)For more lifestyle news, follow us: Twitter: lifestyle_ie | Facebook: IE Lifestyle | Instagram: ie_lifestyle","Expert tips to start eating clean for weight loss, immunity, and health",TOMATO

The imbalanced sugar levels in the blood can adversely affect many organs of the body, including the skin. Most people with diabetes or pre-diabetic condition notice some recurring skin issues or have skin disorders at some point in their life. In some cases, the changes on the skin can be an indication of the onset of diabetes or if you already have diabetes, it means that your dosage needs to be adjusted, mentioned Dr Rinky Kapoor, consultant dermatologist, cosmetic dermatologist and dermato-surgeon, The Esthetic Clinics.What causes skin problems in diabetics?Over 75 per cent of people around the world suffer from type 2 diabetes-related skin problems. Diabetes can cause new skin problems and worsen old ones, said Dr Kapoor.*High blood glucose because of diabetes leads to poor blood circulation in the body, thus the blood vessels and nerves do not get enough blood and nutrients and as a result, the white blood cells lose their ability to fight infections.*Decreased blood circulation reduces the skins ability to heal and damages skin collagen thus robbing skin of its ability to bounce back.*Damaged skin cells lose the ability to function well and the skin experiences increased sensitivity to temperature and pressure.Know the changes in your skinThe positive news is that with little awareness you can contain the skin issues in the early stages while also protecting your body from further damage because of the condition. Some common skin conditions in people with diabetes are:Dry, irritated, red, and itchy skinSkin issues in diabetes are quite common. Heres what you need to know. (Source: Getty Images/Thinkstock) Skin issues in diabetes are quite common. Heres what you need to know. (Source: Getty Images/Thinkstock)Increased blood sugar leads to the body draining fluid from skin cells in order to produce urine, which in turn makes the skin dry and cracked. Another reason for dry skin is diabetic neuropathy i.e. damage to the never endings, especially of legs and feet. Dry skin tends to become itchy and when we itch, it leads to cracks on the skin, providing an easy opening for infectious elements to enter the skin leading to inflammations, redness, and irritation on the skin.Fungal infectionsFungal infections can happen to anybody but people with diabetes are more prone to it. Red, itchy rash accompanied with blisters and scales appears on the folds and warm areas of the body such as in between toes, in the fold of elbows or the armpits, corners of mouth etc. The common fungal infections in diabetic people are candida albicans, ringworm, athletes foot, jock itch, and recurring vaginal yeast infection.Bacterial infectionsPeople with diabetes suffer from more bacterial infections than normal people. Boils, folliculitis, styes on eyelids, carbuncles, and infections around the nails are common in diabetic people.Necrobiosis LipoidicaSmall sold bumps appear on the skin which look similar to pimples but if ignored, they turn into patches of swollen and hard skin with yellow or reddish brown colour. Other indications are shiny skin surrounding the bumps, painful itchy skin, and visible blood vessels.Acanthosis nigricansThis is actually a pre-diabetes condition in which the skin of armpits, groin, or neck turns very dark, thick, and velvety. This condition can also affect elbows, hands, and knees.Digital sclerosisIt has nothing to do with excessive use of digital devices but it can make it difficult for you to use them. Symptoms include tight waxy skin around on hands and stiff fingers. The hard thickening skin makes it difficult to move the fingers and the disease can spread to toes, upper arms, knees, ankles, and even elbows.ALSO READ | Tips for diabetes patients to manage their blood sugarDiabetic blistersDiabetic neuropathy causes sudden blisters to appear on the skin around the elbows, feet, or legs. They are not painful and heal on their own.Diabetic ulcersHigh blood glucose levels causes damage to the nerves and make it harder for the body to recognise and heal wounds. Open sores and wounds especially those on feet take a long time to heal and often go unnoticed.Diabetic dermopathy or shin spotsPainless brown spots that look like sunspots appear near front of the legs. Some people also notice scales and depression in the skin. This condition happens because of changes in blood vessels.Yellow patches around the eyelidsThese are an indication of poorly managed diabetes.

The true-blue Bengalurean admits that she missed the bus to pursue her dreams during her younger days. But not stopping herself now, Raju has a finger in every pie- education, entrepreneurship, and social service.I was a Kuchipudi dancer. But I come from a very conservative family and had little scope to express my talent on stage. When I was growing up, a woman performing on stage was not accepted. Even today I miss being a dancer, says Raju, who is in her 50s. But life had different plans for her. Before donning the hats of an educationist and a business person, in the early 2000s, she was part of Innerwheel, an international organisation linked to the Rotary Club, which was improving the infrastructure in Hebbal. From setting up water facilities to lighting the streets, I was part of the communi ty development project, says Raju, who later assumed the role of managing director at the family-run Vyasa International School in 2008.From being a homemaker to taking on an administrative role has been a challenge.It was difficult to shift gears. However, my father guided me and I learnt all the tricks of the trade. Getting into the education sector was a different ball game, but I enjoyed every bit, says Raju, who took over as board member of Atria Education Trust and Atria Hotel in 2015.Not having been able to pursue her dreams at a young age, she is ensuring that other women have an opportunity to take their passions forward. At FICCI FLO, we have lined up a series of startup incubation programmes, mentoring sessions to reach out to women entrepreneurs who are struggling during the pandemic, says Raju who has been part of the Bengaluru chapter for six years now. In the coming days, Raju plans to airdrop over 5 lakh seedballs (a blend of manure, seeds and red soil) prepared by kids.This, to reduce the carbon footprint. In addition, she will be taking over a project that FICCI FLO took on last year. Theyhad adopted a village in Mandya to introduce skill-based development programmes to rural women and children. We are introducing an organic farming model. This year we are also starting English and computer classes for women and children. Moreover, the village grows a lot of tomatoes and as a result we are looking to collaborate with a local NGO to set up a tomato processing unit.

These include chocolates, breads, processed foods and fast-food items, fat-rich products, including high-fat milk, and liquor. Garlic and onion (their allium content gets converted to sulphur inside our body), hot peppers and spicy foods are high in capsaicin, that cause your brain to think that you are feeling hot, resulting in the sweat glands working overtime. Caffeine too adds to the feeling of hotness as the intake increases heart rate and blood pressure and the body reacts by activating sweat glands. If you have a high sodium diet, the body expels this salt in the form of excess sweat and urine.Carb-rich food is tough to break down by the digestive system and, hence, it produces a significant thermic effect. Sugar-laced foods can spike your insulin, resulting in profuse sweating. Excess of protein powered thermogenic foods on consumption lead to more urea production inside your body, which is expelled as sweat. Smoking contributes to excessive sweating, Kapoor explains adding, When you smoke, the nicotine releases acetylcholine. This increases the bodys temperature, causing more sweating. Likewise, when you take a sip of your favourite beer or wine, the blood vessels dilate, raising the bodys temperature, causing perspiration.Tackle toneWork at reducing the workload on your digestive system by eating the correct foods. Dr Divya Malik, Senior Nutritionist at Apollo Spectra Hospitals, Delhi, suggests using olive oil while cooking food as it prevents the body temperature from rising, curbing sweat production. Green tea is popular for its calming effects. Even a glass of homemade, fresh tomato juice keeps perspiration at bay. Stay hydrated with fluids such as coconut water, lemonade, buttermilk, watermelon juice or fresh fruit juice, if you experience severe sweating.Cut out extra salt consumption by giving up salad dressings, instant soups, potato chips, roasted nuts, and canned foods. Instead, increase your intake of vegetables high in water content like spinach, bottle gourd, cucumber, broccoli, sweet potato, lettuce, cauliflower, bell pepper, cantaloupe, eggplant, and red cabbage. Fruits such as grapes, oranges, lemon, pineapple and watermelon help you stay fresh. Have bananas four times a week, and combine milk with morning cereal. Oats are a good option as they are low-fat and high in fibre. Have soaked almonds and walnuts, suggests Malik. Maintenance routines such as showering frequently, towelling the underarm areas dry and using medicated antibacterial soap are useful. Go sleeveless with a vengeance!Home remedies to fob off the underarm stench A tea tree and water spray helps keep the underarms dry and sweat-free Raw grated potato and cucumber with lemon juice work like a natural bleach Aloe vera carries healing, anti-bacterial properties A turmeric and lemon juice paste application on underarms helps immensely",Don’t sweat the small stuff,TOMATO

2021-08-06,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/apples-ripen-kanthallur-waits-for-visitors/article35771580.ece,"Farmers worried that season may be a washout like last year with pandemic yet to be contained  As another apple season arrives in Kanthallur and nearby Marayur, fruit farmers are a worried lot with the pandemic yet to be contained.  They have gained additional income over the years with farm visits on the itinerary of most tourists. The pandemic had hit their hopes last year as tourists did not turn up following the lockdown.  Among the beneficiaries of farm tourism are those who grow a few apple trees to those with orchards. The apple flowering season is from January to February with harvesting from mid-July to August end.  Usually, farmers retain fruits on trees till the end of Onam season to draw in visitors to the farms. They get better income as tourists are allowed to pluck apples from the tree.  As the apple saplings experimentally cultivated by a few farmers were found to be a success, other farmers also followed suit converting sabarjilli farms into apple farms.  Apple cultivation gained strength after the State government in association with the Kanthallur grama panchayat promoted every home with a fruit tree scheme. Slowly Kanthallur became a favourite destination for farm tourism.  Though other fruits are also grown in Kanthallur, it was apple cultivation that gave the grama panchayat a firm footing in farm tourism. The proximity to Munnar also worked in its favour.  Apple varieties such as Royal Delicious, Gyanismith and Gyaniland brought from Kodaikanal and Himachal Pradesh are mainly cultivated, though Kashmiri varieties are also cultivated. Farmers say they get an annual yield of over 40 kg from a tree.  Tourists reach the farms throughout the year as one or the other fruit, including orange, sweet lemon, strawberry, tree tomato and blue passion fruit are there for the taking.  Chandran Valiyaveettil, a fruit farmer, says no tourists have turned up so far. He says apple is ripe and selling it to local vendors will not provide a remunerative income. Those arriving with family pay us a far better price if it is apple, orange or any other fruit, he says.  As commercial sale of apple is not done, fruit farmers like him are worried they will lose this season also.","As apples ripen, Kanthallur waits for visitors",TOMATO
2021-08-06,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/prateek-sadhu-of-masque-distilling-india-on-a-plate/article35766620.ece,"The countrys most experimental chef is hitting the road, to celebrate Mumbais Masque turning five and to share his ingredients-first approach with pop-ups in five cities  It is a dark and stormy night. Traffic on Delhis pot-holed roads has been crawling for hours. In the quiet, tree-lined neighbourhood of Friends Colony, however, 35-odd diners at boutique hotel The Manor are getting ready for a treat: a 10-course menu featuring some of the bravest, most avant garde Indian cooking yet.  Inside, chef Prateek Sadhu, 34, is readying to roll it all out. This is the first day of a three-day pop-up of Masque, his Mumbai restaurant. Tickets sold out within 48 hours of announcement. Pop-ups in four other cities are to follow  Bengaluru, Chennai, Kolkata and Leh, where Sadhu will keep adding elements to the dishes, building newer ones as he finds inspiration in local cuisines and ingredients.  Also read | Indias new spice merchants  Unique and universal  Before the pandemic hit, Sadhu had been doing precisely this at Masque  a restaurant sans a menu, where guests are encouraged to sit inside a lab and experience how he puts together thoughts and flavours after trips to different regions and farms across the country. The restaurant, which turns five this September, recently made it to number 32 on Asias 50 Best Restaurants list of 2021  the only Indian entry apart from Indian Accent in New Delhi (at number 18).  The Masque team touches down in Delhi | Photo Credit: @masquerestaurant  But this is the first time that many gourmands in other Indian cities are getting to experience Sadhus distinctive cooking because even within our competitive, growing restaurantscape, Masque is more niche than popular, more experimental than mass. Which is a shame because it is perhaps the only one in the country that prizes pure experimentation over commerce. If Masque was cinema, it would have been Satyajit Rays.  Like art house cinema, there is both the unique and the universal in Sadhus oeuvre. Take, for example, some of his dishes from the Delhi pop-up: course one was Carrot kanji, bhekti  brined and cured fish, pickled Kashmiri cherry, pickled lime, gongura greens, aam papad, and carrot kanji. Sour is perhaps the least accepted of tastes with the Indian palate. But Sadhu pushes that boundary with this study in sour. Fermented traditions from across India have been layered  northern Indian kanji, eastern aam papad, southern gongura, the pickled lime of the numerous pan-Indian achars, and the elusive Kashmiri cherry.  In course two, Sadhu puts out Corn pani puri, kalari kulcha, ghevar and chok charwan with tomato rasam. What could be the thread of thought running through his mind while putting together such disparate regional influences? A study in textures: of crusts and breads from several Indian regions. The Marwari pure veg ghevar serves as a base for Kashmiri lamb liver, startling purists, but look closely and youll find a redefining of the idea of Indian bread.  Part of the menu at the Delhi pop-up | Photo Credit: Special arrangement  Food that doesnt pander  Sadhu seems to use his individual experiences  his Kashmiri roots, travels, and the innate internationalism that comes from his stints at top global restaurants such as Alinea, Le Bernardin and Noma  as the lens to look at more universal Indian culinary traditions. Kashmiri lamb neck yakhni meets morels miso in what turns out to be his most popular dish that evening; rogan josh sausage and katlam, the Jammu bread, masquerade with NYC casual-chic; and Pondicherry chocolate gets combined with indigenous central Indian flower liqueur mahua that not many urban Indians have tasted before.  Also read | Sadhu and Krugs onion chronicles  In a way what he does is the opposite of what I do because I do not mix different regional cuisines, chef Manish Mehrotra, one of Sadhus guests that evening, who came with his teenage daughter Adah, tells The Hindu Weekend. Mehrotra, widely regarded as the father of modern Indian cuisine, whose signature Indian Accent dishes continue to be copied and regurgitated by chefs in even small towns, finds Sadhus voice to be among the most unique in Indian kitchens. He mixes cuisines and is not afraid to experiment even if diners here do not accept certain tastes or the importance of things like acidity, something that all Michelin-level dining pays attention to internationally, he points out.  The five-year plan Influenced by zero wastage, techniques like fermentation, and local ingredients sourced directly from farms, the philosophy behind Masque has remained the same since it launched. Even as Sadhu sharpened his focus to researching diverse subregional cuisines. So what is his ambition in the next five years? It is always to survive, he says candidly, about the difficulty of balancing commercial success with cutting-edge experimentation. The pandemic has made this tougher. The next few years will definitely have to be about healing from our current difficult scenario. But, personally, my ambition is to dig deeper into Indian cuisines. I feel I have only scratched the surface. I want to look at home recipes, bring them into the restaurant after R&D, understand different regions and subregions, castes and sub-castes, and how food has changed so many things in the country, he says.  Sadhus signature style is neither purist nor populist, and it is definitely not derivative. In fact, his individualistic experimentation is one of the ways forward for modern Indian food. ITCs Manisha Bhasin concurs. There are two schools of thought when it comes to Indian food, one is purist and other is inventive. But what I like about Prateeks food is that it is not about presentations; the food talks to me, there is a purity in that, says Bhasin. ITC hotels will be the venues for Sadhus pop-ups in Chennai, Kolkata and Bengaluru.  Younger chefs like Dhruv Oberoi of Olive, who was also a guest at the pop-up, add that this is perhaps the boldest experimentation in Indian gastronomy yet  with a sense of internationalism in the dishes. While a few of the courses like the lamb yakhni were comfort, there were bold combinations like chocolate and mahua that I had never experienced before, says Oberoi.  Chefs Dhruv Oberoi, Manisha Bhasin and Manish Mehrotra  What is authentic?  I remember the first meal I had at Masque, in the first week of its opening in Mumbai in 2016 in a mill compound that had fallen into disuse. There was Himalayan rye bread and sea buckthorn berries from Leh, there were textures of potato using techniques like dehydration, cooking in an earthen pit, and sous vide, there was olive oil specially pressed from Rajasthan. The whole approach was described as botanical bistronomy  what appeared to be a mix of international styles of cooking using carefully-sourced (and often unheard of) regional ingredients. Over the last five years, that focus has sharpened.  Koji-cured barramundi, carrot & passion fruit kanji  Sadhu now uses Indian ingredients as well as cooking styles and techniques and refashions them. But the sense of internationalism still binds all these. Does he see his food as Indian? Indian food as we know it today is a result of constant evolution. What is authentic? Is my mothers rogan josh more authentic than what my aunt cooks? Authentic is subjective; food is the result of migration and is constantly evolving. So while tradition is important, innovation is critical, he says. His Indian food, he points out, is not about returning to regional recipes and simply plating them with new tweaks. It demands revisiting ingredients in altogether new ways that can build cross-cultural bridges, he adds.  As you eat a bhetki with clam rogan with a puri flavoured with Goan sausage, thinking cross-cultural bridges is inevitable. The pop-up menu will continue to evolve over all its stops  much like the journey of food itself.  The upcoming pop-ups will be priced 5,500 plus taxes. Bengaluru on August 20-21 and Chennai on August 27-28.  Chef Sadhu and his team  Hat tip  Sadhus innovative cooking and internationalism (that comes from study at the Culinary Institute of America plus work at top global restaurants) have been winning him recognition ever since Masque launched. In its first year, it was ranked among the top 10 on Food Tanks 2016 list of restaurant innovators in the world. In 2020, the restaurant received the Miele One To Watch award in Asias 50 Best Restaurants list before debuting this year on the main list. Sadhu has been the first Indian chef to be a brand ambassador for Champagne brand Krug and, more recently, he contributed a simple but inventive beets with peach chunda recipe for the #Amexforfoodies cookbook featuring recipes by top global chefs. Before the pandemic, Masque had also been collaborating with leading chefs across the world to host pop-ups, including with Matt Orlando who helms Copenhagens Amass, in 2017.",Prateek Sadhu of Masque: distilling India on a plate,TOMATO

Soyabean growers, especially in Marathwada, are concerned about mosaic virus, as well as infestation of pink and American bollworm. The Agriculture department has issued advisories for preventive measures to be taken to tackle the pest problem.  Soyabean growers from Amravati, Latur and Osmanabad districts have reported the attack of mosaic virus. A secondary infection caused by aphids, this virus causes curling of leaves, stunted growth and dip in productivity in the oilseed crop. While the attack has been limited to a few pockets, the Agriculture department has advised preventive measures, including spraying of insecticides such as Imidacloprid The advisory, issued last week, has pointed out that usage of infected seed may be a probable cause of spread of the virus.  On Tuesday, the state Agriculture Commissioner chaired a high-level meeting of various experts on the issue of virus attacks on tomato crop as growers in Maharashtra have reported major crop loss due to the attack of mosaic virus in the last two years. Nurseries which sell tomato sapling were instructed to ensure they take proper measures to control the spread of the virus. A detailed report about the matter is expected to be submitted soon.  Last year, the Agriculture department had made efforts to promote re-usage of seeds by farmers and this year, it has asked farmers to be careful about choosing seeds from non-infected parts of the field. Maharashtra has reported sowing of the oilseed over 45 lakh hectares, an all-time high.  Pink and American bollworm infestation in cotton fields is also a major problem for farmers. While some cotton fields in Marathwada and Vidarbha have reported infestation of this pest, the number of such cases has been low. Only in a few cases has the infestation caused such extensive damage that the farmer concerned has reported significant loss of crop.

For fragrance, add 5-6 drops of rosemary. Apply it on the scalp and hair and leave it for 30 minutes  *To reduce frizz, use a homemade hair mask by mixing honey, banana, aloe vera and avocado and a few drops of oil. Apply the mask on the hair and scalp for 30 minutes. Wash to see best results  *To reduce hair fall, soak fenugreek seeds overnight. Grind it the next morning and mix well with coconut milk and an egg white. Apply it on the scalp and leave it for 30mins  *Dandruff is caused by a fungal infection and not a dry scalp. Therefore, avoid oiling your hair in the monsoon. Instead, to reduce dandruff, mix yoghurt with apple cider vinegar and keep it for 20 minutes  Although these recipes involve natural ingredients, its necessary to check if you are allergic to any, said Dr Goel. Hence, do a patch test on your hand or thighs before trying these remedies.  Its a myth that one should avoid using a hairdryer.

Also, there are sojji appams, sweet little maida pooris stuffed with rava kesari, and nutrient-rich paruthipaal made from extracted cotton seed milk blended with rice flour, cardamom, dry ginger and palm sugar. These dishes that are an integral part of the citys street food culture are staples in Sourashtrian households in South India. Yet there is much more to be discovered especially during the festival seasons and special ceremonies, when Sourashtrian families get together to prepare and share traditional recipes handed down generations.  Sensing an opportunity to revive heirloom recipes during the pandemic, members of the Sourashtra community planned food festivals to remind members about what defines their food, while simultaneously showcasing their food culture to the rest of the city. The first, a three-day food festival held recently in temple town Madurai revived some time-honoured recipes.  Sourashtrian delicacy Polte Chaino now commonly known as mutton kootu | Photo Credit: Special Arrangement  According to chef Aravinth G N, who curated the food festival, it is believed that the Sourashtrians brought the idli to South India. A blend of rice and urad dal, ground together and steamed to form cakes called iddada can be traced to Gujarat in the 10th to 12th Century. Rasam is also said to have originated in 16th Century Madurai, made by the Sourashtrians who called it pulichaar.  There are select dishes in traditional Sourashtrian menus for weddings and important ceremonies; we follow the ingredients and preparation style as taught by our ancestors, says Aravinth, whose family is known for its expertise in Sourashtrian cuisine and has been in private catering for the last six decades.  The taste, texture and ingredients of our cuisine has transformed under the influence of Tamil culture; even the names changed, says C R Venkatesh, president of Sourashtra Small Business Association. For instance tamarind rice, popular as puliodharai now, was called ambad bhaat; saman ambadi is kudal kuzambu, limbu pongal is commonly known aslemon rice, while the spicy alagar koil dosa evolved from halke dhowra thida. The original Sourashtrian tomato rice has a strong cinnamon flavour while their sakkarai pongal is prepared in paruthipaal (cotton seeds milk).  Sourashtrian delicacy The original Ambad Bhaath is what we now know as tamarind rice or puliyodharai | Photo Credit: Special Arrangement  Our ingredients and food are unique in taste, yet nowhere in the world there is a decent restaurant offering authentic Sourashtrian cuisine, rues Yogesh Thirukonda, who conceived the revival initiative.  It is estimated that there are around 6,00,000 Sourashtrians across Tamil Nadu, and Madurai is a major hub with 1,80,000 settled there. History records that the silk thread merchants from Gujarat were brought as royal weavers by the Nayak kings of the South in mid-17th Century.  Three major waves of migration happened, to Madurai, Thanjavur and Salem. When people move, they not only bring their food with them but the memories of home, says Venkatesh adding that heritage recipes and food available in the new place of work and living often amalgamate to shape the immigrant experience, while influencing their new home.  The community is now keen on compiling the traditional recipes to bring out a book on Sourashtrian cuisine because food is as much about memories as it is about festivity, culture, spices and names that ought to be documented, says Thirukonda.

While some experience sudden acne, for others, the lack of good sleep, etc., can give rise to puffiness of the face. So, how to get rid of it?  Dr Madhu Chopra, a cosmetologist and the managing director at Studio Aesthetique, says a puffy face happens when:  1. There is dehydration due to excessive alcohol or a bad diet.

While occasional cheat-meals are okay, one must also learn to consciously stay away from foods that can harm their health and lead to lifelong issues.  As we await Diwali, Minal Shah, senior nutrition therapist, Fortis Hospital, Mulund shares some pointers on how one can enjoy the festival of lights, keep their taste buds happy and also not compromise on health.  ALSO READ | This festive season, balance your cravings with these simple tips  Here are a few pointers for enjoying guilt-free desserts:  1. Choose a milk-based dessert like shrikhand, sandesh, mishit doi, kheer, etc. Milk is a good source of first-class protein, and these desserts can easily be made at home with any modifications that we desire.  2. Sugar can be replaced with natural flavoring agents like cinnamon, nutmeg, dry fruits like dates, raisins, and fresh fruits. To an extent, jaggery and honey can also be opted over refined sugar, but with quantity restriction.  3. Make a healthier choice among existing desserts.   Choose badam katli (omega-3 fatty acids) over kaju katli.   Choose besan ladoo (protein) or peanut ladoo (MUFA) over rava ladoo, Mysore pak (protein) over coconut ladoo.   Choose carrot halwa or dudhi halwa (antioxidants/vitamins) or moong dal sheera (protein) over rava sheera.   Choose payasam over a regular rice kheer.  4. Try something new and unconventional with a functional food added to it. Like dates sesame ladoo, oats dates nut ladoo, walnut ladoo, methi kheer, dudhi kheer, apple sheera, fruit kheer, papaya halwa, beetroot halwa, carrot kalakand, oats pancakes with cranberry syrup or blueberry syrup or chocolate syrup, homemade protein bars, apple pie, pumpkin pie, fruit yogurt, seeds chikki (pumpkin/sunflower/flaxseed).  5. Consider the portion size. There may be desserts which are high in fats like jalebi, malpua, gulab jamun, gulpapdi, sheera etc. If its your favourite, reduce the portion size. Cut smaller pieces to reduce the calorie intake.  6. Also, remember the basics  add a good bowl of salad with different coloured vegetables and fruits to ensure healthy fibre in every meal.  7. Add fillers for yourself and your guests, which are low in calories and tasty as well like ginger lemonade, virgin pina colada, kiwi margarita, masala milk, thandai, milkshake with fennel seeds, falooda, cucumber mint cooler, tomato mocktail, etc.   For more lifestyle news, follow us on Instagram | Twitter | Facebook and dont miss out on the latest updates!","This Diwali season, incorporate these healthy eating habits",TOMATO
2021-11-03,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/eating-out-in-delhi/article37299507.ece,"Despite the challenges of the ongoing pandemic, a surge of feisty restaurants have launched, drawing on memories of the past and summer holidays to create alluring dining spaces  The Tangra Project  Chef Vikramjit Roys face beams like the Qutab Minar on a moonlit night, or, in his case, the Victoria Memorial. He has just launched The Tangra Project, his first own restaurant, after two decades in the industry, along with business partners Vir Kotak and Anurodh Samal. The three had started Context.Eat, the parent company, earlier last year.  Located in Delhis DLF Avenue, this barely two-month-old restaurant is an ode to Kolkata, the city where Vikramjit was born and spent his formative years. Right from the second hand book shops on College Street to the river Hooghly, everything finds a representation in the restaurant, either is the form of decor or dish. This includes marble pillars that resemble stacks of books, a giant mural of a vibrant fish that finds itself sprawled across three walls, and lights on the ceiling which are reminiscent of the toony bulbs that are strung during pujas and festivals.  Working on this project brought to life a gamut of memories for Vikramjit. As we bite into a deliciously creamy haleem on toast, he recalls how he used to catch the 1 pm show with his friends at the erstwhile Chaplin Theatre, and then wait outside for a specific vendor who sold haleem. That is what he recreated.  The kosha mangsho and kochuri are what his Sundays were made up of; he would go to the butcher with his father and get the best pieces to make this household favourite. At this restaurant, Vikram has obediently followed his mothers recipe for the kosha mangsho. She came here and taught us how to prepare it and then followed it up with a video, he laughs.  The menu is a rolodex of Kolkatas iconic dishes: Chinese, Anglo Indian, Mughlai and of course Bengali. Here youll find bhetki fish wrapped with the sharp flavours of kasundi, kanch kola kofta (dumplings made of raw plantain), cholar dal, Tangra style chilli chicken and chicken cutlets so crisp that when you bite in, you hear a satisfying crunch (#ASMR). The breadcrumbs  in which the cutlets are coated  are sourced from Kolkata, as are the other raw ingredients.  Then there are the recipes that took shape in Vikrams head before finding themselves plated on elegant crockery. These include parwal guacamole: pointed gourd being cooked for 18 hours and then made into a fine paste, featuring bits of tomato and pomegranate, shining like bright jewels on a bed of green. Or spinach, roasted poppy seed in sesame sauce, a simple yet delightful combination. If you are in the mood to experiment, the menu also offers a mustard and tender coconut mousse.  The menu, Vikram says, will keep changing according to each season. Hardly a challenge, given they had to bring down the number of entries from 500 to 200.

With its sunshine yellow facade  dappled with pink bougainvillea  French style doors and courtyard bordered with white pillars, this chocolate factory and cafe mirrors the laidback charm of the former French colony. Colocal is a passion project of Sheetal Saxena and her husband Nishant Sinha. For Sheetal, a chocolate aficionado, the idea to start a bean to bar brand came to her while she was watching videos of cacao being roasted. Curiosity led her to research more on the subject and thus Colocal was born.  They are currently doing dark chocolate: 55, 66, 72 and 85%. The eventual goal is to reach 95%, says Nishant who also owns the Roastery Coffee House in Hyderabad and Kolkata. There are bonbons and truffles, and the chocolates are also blended with sea salt, nuts, caramel among others.  Also Read | Roastery Coffee House, Hyderabad review  Colocals cacao beans are sourced from Idukki in Kerala. We roast our cacao in a proper coffee roaster and that gives our chocolate a different taste, explains Nishant. He says that often there are many myths associated with chocolate.

They can see the process right from roasting, conching to melanging, he adds.

Apparently, that is the best way to enjoy the innovative bite-sized small plates that this trendy bistro by day and gastro by night is known for.  The bistro offers sushi, galouti kebab, golgappa with pomello, dimsums (in stunning red and purple hues, using natural colour from beetroot and purple cabbage) and more. The idea here is to try an array of cuisines rather than commit to one large main course for the entire evening.  There are large plates too. The massaman curry, for instance, where the meat is cooked for 24 hours in a sous vide machine. The food represents the chefs culinary journey across London, Dubai, Maldives and Phuket, among others. The menu also lists favourites from closer home, like appams, chicken Chettinad and cone dosa.  Owned by Gurmehar, Navdeep Singh Sethi and Alekh Vardhan, Klap was born in April, but had to temporarily shut down due to the second wave of the pandemic, before reopening in June. Spread over two floors, it has a terrace offering open air dining. The terrace also has the Chefs garden that grows basil, birds eye chilli, ajwain (carom), coriander, ginger flower, lemongrass, and microgreens such as amaranth, says Gurmehar, adding that he believes in sustainability.  To that end, cucumber and tomato peels are dehydrated and served with a dash of pink salt and paprika, as nibbles at the bar. Stems of broccoli and leftovers of onion are frozen in blocks of ice, which double up as slabs on which sushi, sashimi, and nigiri are served.

She promptly went to the market, with her son on video call to pick out guajillo chillies and a list of other ingredients he needed for dinner, including a fiery block of Achiote paste and bags of fragrant masa flour. Then came the tough part of the assignment: She had to figure out how to send it from her home in Puebla, Mexico, to Chennai.  At newly opened Tinga, the citys first taqueria, Chef Joacim chuckles about his endless hunt for authentic Mexican ingredients. Determined to keep prices affordable, in the tradition of old school Mexican taquerias, he and his partners are balancing a tightrope between economics and ambition.  Annie Gali was captivated by Mexico, after holidaying there. Gero Francis runs the Aqualum resort in Tulum, a Mexican town on the Caribbean coastline of the Yucatn Peninsula, known for its beaches and dramatic ruins of an ancient Mayan port city. We loved the experience of sitting in these tiny places and eating tacos, with sauce dripping down to elbows, chuckles Annie, nimbly squeezing past the counter with practised ease to serve customers in the cheery, compact space. She adds, Hence our tag line  messy if done right!  Chef Joachil, Annie and Gero.  Explaining that they were determined not to compromise on flavours, Giro says they spent four months working on the recipes with Chef Joacim, figuring out what local ingredients could be used, making a note of what needed to be imported, and cutting open a lot of avocados. Chef Joacim shakes his head: Indian avocados  they are just not the same as the ones in Mexico. Nevertheless, they soldiered on. We paid for extra baggage, and Chef Joacim brought the first lot of ingredients with him from Puebla, says Giro, adding And then his mom sent him the second lot.  Now that supply chains are up and running again, after the challenges of the pandemic, they are importing a regular supply of masa for their tortillas, as well as chillies and spices. Along with Chef Saravanan, who was formerly with The Park hotel, the team first set up a central kitchen in Porur, making Tingas signature fresh sauces from scratch, planning to focus on takeaway across the city. Then, a few days ago, they launched their outlet on TTK Road, and though it is small  to a sorry-I-put-my-elbow-in-your-empanada degree  it has been packed with enthusiastic customers ever since.  It is quickly evident why: Chef Joacim launches the meal with fried plantain balls in a rich tomato sauce, which are a satisfying balance of sweet and savoury notes. Then come steamy cassava balls stuffed with cheese, and hibiscus-stuffed empanadas. (The sun dried petals add a delicate floral note.) The juicy minced chicken empanadas that follow have enticingly crisp edges, and are served with dollops of chipotle mayonnaise and a chiffonade of pickled onions.  Discussing what drew him to India, Chef Joacim, who was working with Gero at Aqua Lim, says he was intrigued by the idea of starting Chennais first taqueria. Mexican food has so much flavour, and I want Indians to taste it the way it is made at home, he states, sliding chicken tinga tacos across the table. Originating in his home town of Puebla, the saucy tinga, rich with smoky chipotle, oregano, thyme and other spices, is bright with flavour and cradled by light, fluffy tacos.  The team brings out an army of sauces that include black mayonnaise dark with roasted peppers, a zingy green jalapeno dressing and the addictive salsa macha, with garlic and guajillo chillies.  There is careful attention to detail: Takeaway boxes come with detailed instructions on how to eat each item as well as a QR code that takes you to the Chefs playlist so you can groove to a nachos-appropriate background score. It is a lot of packaging though, and they should find ways to cut frills and plastic to be more eco friendly.  Tingas food focusses on fresh sauces.  Eat at Tinga if you can: nothing beats tacos straight out of the kitchen. Especially after so many months of lockdown and takeaway. Sure its a bit of a squeeze, but on the bright side, you can end your meal with churros hot from the pan: Sweet, airy and sticky with warm chocolate.

Several vegetable markets saw no takers for tomatoes.  According to information, the tomato market at Madanapalle, the largest in Asia, received 419 tonnes of tomato on Monday. While the first grade was sold at 58 a kg, the second variety was priced at 29.6 a kg in the wholesale. The market officials said that with the start of winter months, arrivals generally remain low. However, the climatic conditions in Madanapalle division led to crop damage in some stretches, leading to a slump in the arrivals.  Vegetable merchants in Chittoor said that last year, the tomato prices slipped to below 10 a kg in November, with the business suffering under the impact of COVID first wave. While bulk stocks of the first variety were transported to Bengaluru, Chennai, Hyderabad and other cities in the neighbouring States, the domestic markets in Chittoor, Nellore and Madanapalle were receiving the second and third grade varieties, which get damaged quickly.  The skyrocketing of petrol prices had its impact on the tomato trade this year, right from the June itself. The third grade tomato prices between June and October stood between 20 and 40 a kg in the retail market, but the tag was doubled from November 1 onwards.

While farmers are delighted, consumers are worried as prices soared to Rs 48 a kilo on Monday. Farmers said the inclement weather reduced the shelf life of tomatoes resulting in price rise.  Tomato is one of the key crops in the district, cultivated on 5700 hectares producing an average production of 75,000 tonnes per year. This year, because of the incessant rainfall over the past few days, the self-life of tomatoes has drastically reduced leading to a reduction in supply.

Only in April, a kilo was sold at Rs 5 per kg and six months later it increased 10 fold to Rs 24 - Rs 26 (in October). Now the prices are estimated at Rs 48-50 in Ulavar Santhai, in retail the prices have further increased. This is a seasonal fluctuation, when the monsoon passes the prices will fall drastically again.""  Selvaraj, a farmer, said, ""Cultivating tomatoes between October and December is risky as it is profitable. During the normal seasons' tomatoes will have a shelf life of between 7 to 10 days, but during monsoon, the shelf life reduces drastically and we would have to sell the produce within two days or they will rot."" He added that, even with low production, farmers are making good profits this season.  Consumers however are facing the heat of soaring prices.

Only a few months ago we were purchasing the same for only Rs 5 and Rs 8 per kg.""  Officials in the Agriculture Marketing department said, ""Many farmers stopped cultivation of tomatoes because of the severe decline in prices a few months ago. Those who cultivated tomatoes reported low yield and this resulted in supply constraints. Arrivals to the Ulavar Sandhai has are down. On average, we get 11-12 tonnes of Tomato from farmers. But on Monday we received only 6tonnes.""

If rains continue, traders said the prices may skyrocket further.  While business is dull in Koyambedu Wholesale Market, the prices of vegetables keep soaring. President of Koyambedu Vegetable Wholesale Merchants Association S Chandran told TNIE the prices of vegetables have shot up as there have been fewer arrivals. Usually, 80 trucks of tomatoes reach the city every day but on Monday, only 40 trucks reached the market, he said.  Retail shops in and around Koyambedu are selling tomatoes at Rs 100. A box of 12 kg tomatoes costs above Rs 1,000 today. So we are selling it above Rs 100, says a retail trader. President of Koyambedu Vegetable, Fruit and Flower Sellers Welfare Association M Thiagarajan told TNIE the price of tomato is expected to go up due to its unavailability.  On Sunday, tomatoes were selling at Rs 60 to Rs 65 per kg and on Monday, it touched Rs 70. On Tuesday, the price could go up by another Rs 5, he said. Until fresh crops arrive from north India, the price of tomatoes will continue to rise drastically as the traders here are competing with each other to get the vegetable, added Thiagarajan.  A woman, who was bargaining with a shopkeeper, says if the prices go up then she has to think twice about using tomatoes in curry or rasam. The prices have gone up drastically. I am finding it difficult to afford. My house owner gave me a Rs 50 note to buy a kg of tomato. How can I buy a kilo of tomato at Rs 50? she asked.  Apart from tomatoes, the price of other vegetables has also gone up by Rs 5 to Rs 10, says Chandran. Till the rains last, the vegetables will be costlier, he observed. President of Kovai Thyagi Kumaran Anaithu Kaikari Viyabarigal Sangam M Rajendran said the supply of vegetables to the market was not a problem. However, sales dropped drastically. He attributed the sales drop to the festival holidays followed by rain in the region. The wholesale price of onion per kg has gone up to Rs 40 from Rs 30 four days ago, he added.","Tomatoes turn dearer, courtesy rains",TOMATO

Less arrivals of the crop in other markets due to monsoon have increased the demand and price of tomatoes from Madanapalle.  Incessant rains in Telangana, Tamil Nadu and some other major growing regions have resulted in a shortfall of supply of the crop in markets there. As a result, tomato traders are now looking at the Madanapalle market, the largest in the State.  Normally, traders from Tamil Nadu and Karnataka visit wholesale markets in Palamaner, Madanapalle and Punganur to purchase tomatoes during the season. Tomatoes have been exported to Telangana, Maharashtra, Chattisgarh, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, West Bengal, Odisha, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka from Madanapalle market.The prices of high quality tomatoes, which were sold at Rs 6 to Rs 14 per kilo at the wholesale market in September-end, shot up to Rs 50-70 in the last one week.  We have suffered severe losses this year. Now, the increased prices give us some respite. Less arrival of the crop in other States due to heavy rainfall has increased the demand for tomato in Madanapalle market. The price has touched Rs 74 per one kilo in the last week. Tomato traders from Tamil Nadu, Telangana and other states have been giving orders to local traders, said K Sukumar Reddy, a farmer from Madanapalle.  Madanapalle market is getting enough stock from the western parts of the mandals  Thamballapalle, Punganur areas and border villages of Karnataka like Lakshmipuram, Rayalpadu, Gownepalli and Srinivasapuram.

On Tuesday, the first grade tomatoes were sold for Rs 68 a kg and the arrival stood at 323 metric tonnes a day. This is the off-season. Usually, the season of huge arrivals is between March and August. The market has received a record arrival of 1,850 metric tonnes in a single day during the season. Now, the arrivals have not crossed 350-400 metric tonnes which resulted in demand for the produce, said N Prakash, a trader from Madanapalle market.  Majority of the produce from Madanapalle market is being exported to Tamil Nadu, coastal Andhra Pradesh and border areas of Odisha.Sources in the agriculture marketing department say that the prices have increased with the less arrivals to the market.

In the last three weeks, the prices of vegetables including tomato, beans and drumstick have seen a three-fold surge. Wholesale dealers said that even before the beginning of Deepavali, there was a shortage of supply from Tamil Nadu, from where over 60 per cent of supplies are coming to Kerala.  This has resulted in a sudden surge in prices of vegetables. Schools reopened in the state last week and there was an increase in demand for vegetables. This was also another reason for the price hike.  ""There is a 30 per cent dip in overall quantity of loads arriving from Tamil Nadu every week.  The suppliers have informed us that the cultivation in low-lying areas was severely affected due to floods. The volume of cultivation was also low during the last few months resulting in a dip in supply,"" said Ernakulam Market Stall Owners Association president K K Ashraf. He said that other than Chinese potato (Koorkka,) the prices of all other vegetables have witnessed a surge in the last couple of weeks.  Among vegetables, tomato price in the retail market touched Rs 80 on Wednesday. Ashraf said that in the wholesale market, tomato is priced at Rs 55 and the retailers will add their margin to the actual price, which has resulted in the surge. There are also complaints from consumers that there is no uniformity in price and it varies from shop to shop. ""The vegetable vendors/retailers are charging as per their will for vegetables. If we get a kilogram of tomato for Rs 80 from one shop, another shop nearby will charge Rs 75 or Rs 85, as per their will.

The data, relating to the past five years, reveals a jump of more than 100% in domestic vegetable production and the acreage under cultivation. While the state requires around 5,479 tonnes of vegetables per day, domestic production accounts for 4,301.4 tonnes, the agriculture department statistics say.  However, experts are not fully convinced about the states expanding self-sufficiency in vegetable production as urban markets continue to be ruled by vegetables from neighbouring states.  Pradeepkumar T, head of the vegetable science department in the Kerala Agriculture University, said: The data may be true in terms of acreage under cultivation, production and consumption. But based on that data, we cannot conclude that Kerala has almost reached self-sufficiency in vegetable production.  While there has been a significant rise in the production of vegetables like snake gourd, bitter gourd, cucumber, ash gourd, pumpkin, cowpea, ladies finger and spinach in the past couple of years, the state still has to source other staple vegetables from outside, he pointed out. In fact, a glut of cucumber and other horticultural produce like snake gourd, had forced farmers to abandon their produce in some places. However, Kerala still has to depend on the neighbouring states to meet its daily requirement of onion, potato, tomato or winter vegetables like beans, carrot, cabbage and cauliflower, as their production is significantly low in the state, he said.  The course ahead for the state should be to identify the areas or the crops that need to be improved, and explore ways to meet its requirement in other produce as well. The state should also find markets outside for the crops which have an excess harvest. The Vegetable and Fruit Promotion Council Keralam exported a shipload of quality produce to West Asia and London during Onam as there is a high demand for ethnic vegetables in overseas markets, Pradeepkumar said.  While refusing comment on the latest agriculture production statistics, P Indira Devi  former director of research at KAU  said there has been a new momentum in farming in Kerala in recent years, which is yielding results not only with vegetables but with fruits too.

Theres no other way to explain the perennial popularity of this cocktail that once went by the decidedly grimmer name of Bucket of Blood (or so goes one story).

But, like the variations on this drink  with or without tabasco, bits of bacon and shrimp, celery salt, olive juice  stories about its origins are numerous.  Indeed, the lore that surrounds the Bloody Mary would seem quite out of proportion with the modesty of its ingredients and its appearance which, even when jazzed up with a salted rim or a celery stick, is not greatly appetising. Also consider the fact that, save for vodka, all the ingredients that go into its making are also used to make soup or sauce, and the Bloody Marys legions of fans make even less sense.  But, have a sip. First, the combination of vodka with tomato juice packs a punch, especially with the added heat of tabasco and black pepper. This has made the drink a popular hair-of-the-dog remedy. Combined with its heartiness, this makes the Bloody Mary a great option for a guilt-free brunch or lunch drink. Best of all, the Bloody Mary is an incredibly forgiving, fuss-free drink.

Along with eggs, these were the only two items that recorded a fall. However, not all vegetables followed this trend. Tomatoes were an outlier with a staggering 31% rise in costs. Their bloated costs were induced by a drastic fall in supply. Also, when demand surged, traders and retailers increased their mark-ups, inflating prices further.  Highs and lows  India's retail inflation rate, measured by the Consumer Price Index, stood at 4.91% in November. The price of oils and fats, fuel and light, and transport and communications increased the most in November. On the other hand, vegetable prices contracted by 13.62%.  Chart appears incomplete?

Two of the three staple vegetables which carry much weight in the calculation  onion and potato  recorded a 30% and 45% drop in prices respectively compared to a year ago. However, the vegetable which carried the third most weight, tomato, recorded a 31% rise in prices compared to last year. No other vegetable recorded an increase of more than 20% in prices.

Across centres  The price of tomato was costlier across centres in November and December. In Amritsar it crossed 83/kilo in December and in Guwahati it touched 76/kilo on an average. In Bhubaneswar a kilo was bought for 70 on an average in December whereas in Bengaluru and Lucknow it crossed the 60 mark  Arrivals and mark-ups  The surge in tomato's November prices was preceded by a steep fall in their arrivals at the markets. The coloured lines in Charts 4A, 4B and 4C depict tomato arrivals in select cities in the last few November months. The coloured lines in the charts depict the average prices in November. Across all cities, a clear pattern emerges from the charts  if arrivals dip, prices surge. However, how is this price rise being managed, and who benefits from this? Charts 5A, 5B and 5C depict the difference between the wholesale price and retail price in all the months between Jan. 2017 and Nov. 2021. As can be observed, the price difference is peaking again in November 2021. This indicates that as the demand surged and supplies dropped, retailers increased their mark-up and sold at a much higher multiple than what they purchased. The graphs show that this is a routine practice almost every year-end when supplies drop and demand peaks.  Targeted mark-up  The graph shows the % of mark-up set by traders and retailers for food products in Indian cities. The data is based on a 2019 survey done by RBI. For instance, in the case of tomatoes, traders increased the price by around 20% and the retailers increased it by 40%.  Farmers don't benefit  However these markups don't translate to higher profits for farmers, especially in the case of vegetables. Results from RBI survey:  A routine event  Vegetable prices are highly volatile and increases at the year-end due to reduced supply.

Sri Sasthalaya Catering, who have been running sabha canteens for seven years, will be serving an elaborate lunch at the venue for the first time.  We have been granted permission to serve ela sappad (a traditional lunch on a banana leaf), says Ramesh Krishnan, the proprietor. He adds, We usually serve mini lunch on plates, but this year we are looking forward to serving a freshly made, authentic kalyana sappad (wedding style lunch). The menu will be diverse, with different types of rasam, sambar, vetha kulambu and moru kulambu. There will be a variety of thogayal (lentil based chutnies) and payasams everyday.  He promises that the menus will be non-repetitive, with mavadu (tender mango pickle) and veppalakatti (a traditional dry pickle made with lime leaves) readied exclusively for the meals.  Starting from 6am, the canteen will serve piping hot Chettinad specials such as vella appam, kuzhi paniyaram, appam and idiyappam. They are also launching pizza idlis: idlis steamed in circular plates, topped with mixed vegetables and loaded with cheese. Still in a Mc Sabha frame of mind? Try their cheese idlis as well.  Of course all idlis, even the ones with American accents, must come with chutney and coffee. We are serving ginger chutney, tomato kara chutney, Kumbakonam kadappa (a regional speciality made with moong dal, coconut, spices and mixed vegetables) and Chettinad masala kulambu (an aromatic gravy with vegetables, made with freshly ground coconut and spices), says Ramesh.  As for dessert, as always he says their khoa jangri is what steals the show year after year. Pricing is deliberately competitive. Sabha canteens are an opportunity for caterers like us to find new customers that may bring in business for the rest of the year, says Ramesh. Therefore my focus is to impress the customers with our food, and definitely not profit.  Dont forget to try the coffee, the kiosk is always a major crowd puller here.We source high quality coffee beans from a single estate in Coorg and cows milk from local suppliers, says Ramesh. We start serving coffee as early as 5am.  Although this has been a year of takeaway, Ramesh is determined to keep the experience personal, and packaging free: We want rasikas to come to the venue, enjoy the fresh, hot meal served on the banana leaf and experience authentic Chennai hospitality.

Sastha Catering Services, Mylapore Fine Arts Club  Last year, RK Venkatesan ran the sabha canteen despite the pandemic, even though there were no music events or concerts. And though people were nervous about crowds, it was comforting to experience at least one familiar note in a tensely unpredictable year.  This year they have started a week ahead of the season due to an overwhelming demand from customers. People are now confident of leaving their homes and heading to the canteen, says RK Venkatesan adding, On day one (December 10) we served 300 lunches, which was rather overwhelming.  Sastha serves a typical South Indian wedding feast on a banana leaf (400 per head). In a wedding feast we normally serve a set menu such as potato roast, aviyal and usili. But I am trying to bring in more variety, says Venkatesan. For example, he says, they serve poosanikka pulippu kootu, chow chow rasavangi (a thick gravy made with coconut, spices, with brinjal or chowchow) and other traditional home style dishes. The focus is on using less oil and spices, he adds.  This is the fifth year that the caterer is running a sabha canteen during the music season.  For breakfast, while there are the traditional ghee dosas, to keep things interesting, Sastha also serves pineapple dosa, beetroot dosa and spinach dosa. If you drop by in the evening, look out for their popular crisp vethala (betel leaf) bajji, Manglore bondas and paani puri.  For the New Year, we will be serving a special lunch (500) where one can taste special items from Andhra, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Karnataka, says Venkatesh.  Kumbakonam degree coffee is available through the day and is served in a brass davara set. Another novelty this year is a counter selling sweets and savouries.

Then, last year the pandemic halted most of the citys Margazhi traditions, including their canteen.  Srinivasan has decided to try a new format this year by organising a Margazhi Food Festival at the Hemamalini Kalyana Mandapam. We are running the canteen as a separate entity at the wedding hall this year, he says, adding This probably is the first time that a canteen is functioning without any concert or under the aegis of any sabha. I am organising such a canteen only for sake of my loyal customers, as they look forward to our elaborate meals every year during the December Season.  His team specialises in traditional vegetarian meals, as well as snacks and tiffin. I try to bring into the menu, what we normally may not find in the restaurant. For example, paal kozhukattai, vella paniyaram and badam halwa, which is my fathers secret recipe, says Srinivasan. The kalyana virundhu we serve has no onion, no garlic (525 per person) and we generally avoid root vegetables during the weekends, he says, adding that Most of us did not get to attend many weddings during the pandemic, so it is a chance to celebrate familiar flavours.

Noting that although every licensed wholesale shop in the Koyambedu market was allotted parking space for two heavy vehicles, members said it was not adequate.  In their representation to the Koyambedu MMC and Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority, the federation said the authorities concerned must not allow unloading of goods or carry out business on vacant space as it violated market regulation rules.  Court directive  This comes in the backdrop of Madras High Court directive allowing interim arrangement for Thanthai Periyar Tomato Traders Association to unload tomatoes on one acre space to control soaring prices till Pongal festival.  M. Thyagarajan, president, Koyambedu Wholesale Tomato Traders Association, said allowing unloading of goods would hit the business of licensed wholesale merchants, who paid taxes to do business in the market. Moreover, the association had not been able to sell tomato at a competitive price as promised to the court, he added.  Members said other merchants might resort to such trade in open spaces. Federation president G.D. Rajasekaran said: We have made a representation to turn the vacant site into parking spaces or construct more shops. Of the 1,500 licensed vegetable shops in the market, nearly 200 were wholesale shops and the rest belonged to semi-wholesalers.  Drop in prices  Meanwhile, the price of tomato has dropped to 40-50 a kg in the wholesale market on Wednesday as the arrivals had increased to 50-60 lorries. Wholesale traders said there might be a dip in the tomato cost by January following fresh harvest.  Similarly, the price of some of the other vegetables such as beans and brinjals had dropped to 40-50 kg now. They were sold for nearly 90-100 a kg until recently in the wholesale market. Beans are being procured from other parts such as Ranchi.  At present, the market receives 300 truckloads of vegetables daily. When the number of arrivals touches 350 truckloads, the cost of most vegetables may stabilise around 50 a kg, the traders added.",Traders want vacant areas in Koyambedu market to be converted into parking space,TOMATO
2021-12-22,https://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/bengaluru/2021/dec/22/an-ode-to-tomatoes-2398217.html,"Hriday Ranjan By  Express News Service  BENGALURU: The last month brought in sorrow, with the news of a few vegetables prices soaring above the 100 rupees per kilo mark. Caused by heavy rains, the price-rise brought much discomfort to both farmers and consumers. Some of those vegetables were the usual suspects  capsicum, brinjal  those two overrated brother-vegetables that enjoy a niche audience and high prices. Onions were there on the list too, but our nation is no stranger to the antics of onions.  Onion prices have toppled governments in the past and shaken up hastily made coalitions of the previous decade. Our nation has its own methods of dealing with sky-rocketing onion prices. Sometimes, we are told that there is great virtue in eating satwik food, without onion and garlic. In fact, the humble garlic is not given credit. It is an indispensable part of our diet; adds taste and flavour  but never throws tantrums of price-rise and stock-shortage.  But to see tomato in the list of vegetables was a little surprising to me. India has a rich, enviable food culture dating back to thousands of years. In this long history, tomato has made a fairly recent entry. The first tomato was brought by the Portuguese in the 16th century, and its successors quickly made themselves an important part of our diet. Travel to any part of the country, and you will find the humble tomato having assimilated with the local culture. From the Punjabis, who add copious amounts of tomatoes in their Paneer Butter Masala. To down south, where we literally bathe the dish with tomato, resulting in tomato bath.  The tomatoes were such a part of our culture, that they entered our cinema too. Imaginative directors of the 80s used tomatoes (along with lemons, mangoes and other vegetables) to show budding love in the era of kiss-less cinema. Even modern filmmakers were not immune  remember the film Zindagi Milegi Na Dobara? Where the leads broke their shackles from middle-class problems by hurling tomatoes at each other in the La Tomatina?  While the prices have thankfully stabilised since, there were reports that this could have caused a shortage in the market. I cannot claim to know much about the commodities market, but it made me appreciate the many ways tomatoes found its way to my stomach everyday. I had begun to dread a time when ketchup sachets are not handed out wherever I go. Will the gold-coated samosa in a theatre taste the same without a packet of ketchup? In fact, one dares say  will our lives even be the same without the humble sachet of ketchup being silently peddled to us? From movie halls, to restaurants, to roadside Chinese stalls, to airplanes. Imagine being given the ghastly mayonnaise with samosas. Or having a plate of sinfully delicious chow-mein desecrated by pudina chutney!  Philosophers often ask us to appreciate what we have today, instead of lamenting about the past, and worrying miserably about the future. Last months spike of inflation made me appreciate the value of the tomato in my life. There are several vegetables that are native to India. Brinjal, bitter-gourd, and drumsticks. While they are all cool in their own ways, tomato is a red vegetable that makes all the others green with envy.  Pumpkin may be the National Vegetable of India. The tomato was not born in this land. In fact, in many languages, the tomato is literally called vilayati  meaning foreigner. And yet, the tomato has found its way into our lives, our cuisines, and our systems.

2021-12-24,https://indianexpress.com/article/world/biden-signs-bills-on-forced-labor-in-china-als-research-7687911/,"President Joe Biden signed a bill into law Thursday to block imports from Chinas Xinjiang region unless businesses can prove the items were made without forced labor, the latest in a series of intensifying U.S. penalties against the Asian power for alleged abuses.  The measure had to overcome some initial hesitation from the White House, as well as corporate opposition, to win final passage last week in the Senate, following earlier House passage. Biden also signed a separate bill Thursday funding research into a cure for Lou Gehrigs disease.  Today, I signed the bipartisan Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, Biden said on Twitter, along with a photo of him as he signed the legislative text at his desk in the Oval Office. The United States will continue to use every tool at our disposal to ensure supply chains are free from the use of forced labor _ including from Xinjiang and other parts of China.  The new law is the latest in a series of attempts by the U.S to get tough with China over its alleged systemic and widespread abuse of ethnic and religious minorities in its western region, especially Xinjiangs predominantly Muslim Uyghurs.  It requires U.S. government agencies to expand their monitoring of the use of forced labor by Chinas ethnic minorities. Crucially, it creates a presumption that goods coming from Xinjiang are made with forced labor. Businesses will have to prove that forced labor, including by workers transferred from Xinjiang, was not used in manufacturing the product before it will be allowed into the U.S.  The House and Senate each passed the measure with overwhelming support from Democrats and Republicans.  It wasnt until shortly before the Senate voted last week that the White House said Biden supported the measure. The announcement followed months in which the White House declined, despite repeated questioning, to take a public stand on an earlier version of the measure.  The United States says China is committing genocide in its treatment of the Uyghurs. That includes widespread reports by rights groups and journalists of forced sterilization and large detention camps where many Uyghurs allegedly are forced to work in factories.  China denies any abuses and says the steps it has taken are necessary to combat terrorism and a separatist movement.  The U.S. cites raw cotton, gloves, tomato products, silicon and viscose, fishing gear and components in solar energy as among goods alleged to have been produced using forced labor in Xinjiang, a resource-rich mining region that is important for agricultural production. The region also is home a booming industrial sector.  Detainees also are moved outside Xinjiang and put to work in factories, including in the apparel and textiles, electronics, solar energy and automotive sectors, the U.S. says.  Some big corporations lobbied against the measure. Apple, like Nike and other companies with production done in China, said it had found no sign of forced labor from Xinjiang in its manufacturing or supply chain.  Uyghur rights advocates and others had also feared private opposition from within the Biden administration as the U.S. sought cooperation from the Chinese on climate change and other issues.  In a statement last week, White House press secretary Jen Psaki noted export controls and import restrictions, sanctions, diplomatic initiatives and other measures the administration had already taken targeting forced labor from Xinjiang.  The White House also recently announced that it would stage a diplomatic boycott of the coming Winter Olympics in Beijing, citing Chinas egregious human rights abuses and atrocities in Xinjiang. U.S. athletes will be allowed to compete under a diplomatic boycott, but the president and other U.S. dignitaries will not travel to the games, which open in February.  While Biden signed the Uyhgur bill in private, the White House arranged a public signing ceremony _ with guests participating remotely _ for  the Accelerating Access to Critical Therapies for ALS Act.  The law will funnel $100 million annually between 2022 and 2026 into research into Lou Gehrigs disease, an incurable neurodegenerative disorder also known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and similar diseases. It will also create grant programs and provide early access to promising treatments for patients who arent accepted into clinical trials.  For too long there have been no survivors of ALS, but this bill can get us closer to changing that, Biden said.  ALS is named for the New York Yankees baseball player who retired 1939 because of the disease. Gehrig died in 1941.","Biden signs bills on forced labor in China, ALS research",TOMATO

U.S. President Joe Biden on December 23 signed into law legislation that bans imports from China's Xinjiang region over concerns about forced labor, theWhite House said, provoking an angry Chinese condemnation.

Also Read Intel facing China backlash after Xinjiang statement  The bill passed Congress this month after lawmakers reacheda compromise between House and Senate versions.  Key to the legislation is a ""rebuttable presumption"" that assumes all goods from Xinjiang, where Beijing has established detention camps for Uighurs and other Muslim groups, are made with forced labor. It bars imports unless it can be proven otherwise.  Some goods  such as cotton, tomatoes, and polysilicon usedin solar-panel manufacturing  are designated ""high priority"" for enforcement action.  China denies abuses in Xinjiang, a major cotton producer that also supplies much of the world's materials for solarpanels.  Its Washington embassy said the act ""ignores the truth and maliciously slanders the human rights situation in Xinjiang.""

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Mr. Biden's approval of the law underscored the ""United States' commitment to combatting forced labor, including in the context of the ongoing genocide in Xinjiang.""  ""The State Department is committed to working with Congress and our interagency partners to continue addressing forced labor in Xinjiang and to strengthen international action against this egregious violation of human rights,"" he said in astatement.

""Now ... we can finally ensure that American consumers and businesses can buy goods without inadvertent complicity in China's horrific human rights abuses,"" he said in a statement.  In its final days in January, the Trump administration announced a ban on all Xinjiang cotton and tomato products.

Many of the ingredients that we regard as integral to Indian food came from South America and only reached us when Europeans brought them here: tomatoes, potatoes, corn, chillis etc.  And so many of the dishes that we regard as being part of the ancient Indian tradition are restaurant creations from the 20th century. Butter Chicken, Masala Dosa, Chicken 65, Vada Pav, Chicken Tikka, and so many others.  This should not surprise us. It is true of all cuisines everywhere in the world. Spaghetti Bolognese was not created in Bologna but in England. Chicken Kiev was not invented in Kiev or anywhere in Ukraine. It was invented in New York. Pepperoni is not a traditional Italian topping for pizza. It is an American creation.  This is as true of the food of Asia. Along with sushi and sashimi, the one Japanese dish that has found popularity all over the world is Ramen. The sight of a Ramen house with diners loudly slurping their Ramen and soup strikes us as being quintessentially Japanese. And so it may bebut only now. Till the 1950s, hardly anybody in Japan ate Ramen.  Till then, the Japanese called Ramen Shina Soba or Chinese soba because the dish was regarded as being part of Chinese cuisine. All that changed after Japans defeat in the Second World War. The victorious American occupiers tried to feed the defeated Japanese masses, only to find that the country recorded its worst rice harvest in 42 years in 1945. The Japanese were then (and still are, in many ways) a predominantly rice-eating population, so there was a terrible food shortage and people went hungry.  The Americans responded by flooding the country with US wheat, hoping that the Japanese would eat bread. They didbread consumption in Japan more than doubled between 1948 to 1951. But much of the American wheat went into making Chinese-style wheat noodles, which eventually became an urban staple under the name of Ramen.  So, Ramen is hardly a traditional food in Japan. It is a Chinese dish that has become popular because of American occupation.  Noodle dishes boomed all over Asia after the Second World War. Take Pad Thai, perhaps the most popular Thai dish in the world. One story suggests that it was only invented in the 1930s by the Thai government to foster nation-building, and called Pad Thai to give it a patriotic character. (Pad means stir-fry, so Thai Stir-fry or something like that.)  The dish only took off in the 1950s and that is attributed to rice shortages during the Second World War. The Thais discovered that you could make two kilograms of rice noodles from a kilo of rice (no, I am not sure how this works either) so, they used their precious rice supplies for noodle-making. The Pad Thai recipe was already around so, the noodles went into Pad Thai, which became a way of feeding the nation. By the 1950s it had become a staple.  You can argue about the historicity of the stories but what is clear is that both Pad Thai and Ramen only took off after the Second World War and are relatively recent dishes, which are far from traditional in their own cuisines.  We went through a similar transformation in India. Till the 1950s, Indians did not really drink tea. It had been planted by the British using saplings brought from China, but the production was meant mainly for export. Tea drinking only took off in India in the fifties after a campaign by the Tea Board to get Indians to drink tea.  Because the taste of fine tea was alien to our palates, the Tea Board promoted inexpensive teas (made by a process called CTC) which could be cooked with milk and sugar to create the tea we now associate with every chai shop. You can judge the success of the Tea Boards campaign in India by looking at Sri Lanka where CTC consumption is low (they drink the real thingor orthodox, to use the technical term) and our kind of cooked tea is not the norm.  We recognise now that tandoori chicken and chicken tikka were popularised only in the 1950s by a restaurant called Moti Mahal in Delhi. But we also need to acknowledge that the tomato and butter-rich black dal that is served in all Indian restaurants around the world with such names as Dal Bukhara and Dal Makhni was also created at the same time. There were no tomatoes in Punjabi black dal when it was a home-made dish.  The original Moti Mahal in Daryaganj is no longer run by the families of the founders and there are at least three sets of people who use variations of the Moti Mahal trademark. So far, they have been content to serve Butter Chicken, saying that the dish was invented in Moti Mahal (which it was).  But now, there is a new battle between the descendants of Kundan Lal Gujral, who was the face of the original Moti Mahal, and the descendants of Kundan Lal Jaggi, who was one of the partners. Jaggis descendants say that Gujral looked after the front of the house but Jaggi was in the kitchen creating such dishes as Butter Chicken. Their own restaurant chain, Daryaganj, says it is run by the inventors of Butter Chicken, which makes Gujrals descendants see red because they dispute Jaggis role.  In the case of Butter Chicken, we know where it was invented and when. All that is in dispute is the identity of the man who thought it up.  But other dishes present their own mysteries. Take Chicken 65. We still dont know how it got its name. According to the Buhari restaurant in Chennai, which claims to have invented it, the dish went on the menu in 1965 and was called Chicken 65 after the year of its introduction. Well, may be. But Bangalore claims to have invented it, too. And there are other theories about its name: the chicken had to be 65 days old, it used 65 different spices, it was dish number 65 on the menu and so on.  Though there are no clear answers, we can be sure that the dish is a relatively recent invention (mid-1960s) and that it is not part of any culinary tradition: somebody just made it up.  Another southern favourite is Gobi Manchurian (though the name varies slightly depending on which state you are in). The dish is a variation on Chicken Manchurian, which was invented in Mumbai in the mid-seventies in response to customers who asked for spicy Chinese dishes. The invention is usually credited to restaurateur Nelson Wang, especially after he claimed the dish as his own in a show I did nearly two decades ago. But there are others who say that they, not Nelson, created it. And even Nelson did not, even in his worst nightmares, conceive of Gobi Manchurian.  So, lets give this authenticity thing a rest. Cuisines evolve. Dishes are created. Some are good. Some are terrible. But each dish finds its own market. And as time goes on, it begins to be regarded as authentic.

The cook works a slicer through peeled raw bananas at top speed. Thin discs of fruit fall in rapid succession into a container below. Then, they are dropped with a flourish into a giant wok of boiling coconut oil. As the golden-yellow chips crisp up, they are scooped out with a large perforated ladle, and tossed in the air for a microsecond before being laid out on a tray. One cannot help but marvel at the chip-makers skill.  For anyone who has grown up in Kerala, this is a familiar sight. The Malayalis relationship with banana chips is unquestionable, not even potato in its fancy versions has been able to replace it. However, to appeal to a wider, and younger audience, the classic banana chips are now being reinterpreted.  A spicy twist  Alappuzha-based startup Beyond Snacks has come out with banana chip flavours such as peri-peri, salt and black pepper, and sour cream, onion and parsley. The idea was to give the time-tested snack a global makeover, says Manas Madhu, director of Beyond Snacks. Attempting to contemporise banana chips did seem daunting initially, but we wanted to show that it could be a lot more than just banana chips, he adds.  The team tried out a variety of flavours before narrowing it down to a few. The spiciness of peri peri worked really well, sour cream too complemented the original flavour; but tomato fell flat, Manas adds.  As an experiment, the team set up a stall at a popular consumer fair in the State and their chips were an instant hit. We had to keep getting more stock as the demand was huge. This is when we were sure that there is scope for innovation, Manas says.  The company, which launched its banana chips in 2020, now has a manufacturing unit in Kalamassery, Kochi, and is a prominent presence on e-retail platforms delivering across the country. More flavours will be rolled out soon, such as barbecue, North Indian and sweet and sour. It retains the original style classic salted version, too.  Malabar Masala flavour brought out by A1 Chips, Coimbatore | Photo Credit: Special Arrangement  In Bengaluru, PR Heaven Chips has launched five new flavours developed in-house: biryani, noodles, cheese, black pepper and tomato. While biryani is aimed at an older demographic, the noodles and cheese versions appeal to younger people and children, says Anish Swaminath, general manager of PR Heaven Chips. Unlike potato, banana has a very distinct flavour. So the new flavour should complement it, he adds.  Anish continues, Though banana chips are a Malayali staple, we seem to consume potato and tapioca chips more than banana, perhaps because we have always shied away from contemporising it. Launched in November 2021, PR Heaven Chips has its manufacturing unit in Thrissur and will soon be sold through distributors in the State and supermarkets.  Delhi-based Motherland Aromatic South has tied up with the 55-year-old, Coimbatore-based traditional chips maker A1 Chips to bring in a twist to tradition. Banana chips with the flavour of curry leaves, thin chips with rock salt and sweet ripe ones are the versions sold online. We wanted to give a gourmet aesthetic to banana chips and tap into another socio-economic bracket, says Devika Mohan, brand manager. It has been available online across the country for the past two years and the response has been great, she adds.  The nendran variety of bananas works the best for chips, say the brands, as cavendish varieties may be lacking in flavour. Most companies now have automated machinery that makes the chips. Even the frying time is controlled.  Traditional players  Now, even traditional players are welcoming change. A1 Chips has over 11 flavours, including chilli masala, Malabar masala, salsa masala, sweet chilli, pepper, aloo tandoori and honey for a sweet touch. It is all about adapting to newer tastes. Banana chips are our signature product, and anything we add to it only improves its value, says Sudeesh Dhamodaran, joint managing director of A1 Chips. The brand has 53 outlets in various parts of South India, all of which have these varieties. Sudeesh, however, loves to eat original Kerala banana chips dipped in lime pickle. It is the best, he says.  Abhirami N, managing partner of N Vasudevan Banana Chips and Halwa in Kozhikode, says the business gives ample scope for experimentation, but demand is still more for the conventional salted banana chips. However, there are two variations  pepper and chilli  that are available. When she took over the 45-year-old family business started by her father, Abhirami realised that a lot of factors go into the perfection of the final product. We still use coconut husk in the traditional stove where the chips are made; I believe all this adds to the taste of the product, she says.",Banana chips get a global makeover,TOMATO
