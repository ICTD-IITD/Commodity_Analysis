(Express photo/Jasbir Malhi) Rescue work in progress at the collapse site on Saturday. (Express photo/Jasbir Malhi)  A JCB operator was killed after a three-storey showroom of a construction company at Kharar collapsed when one of its walls caved on Saturday afternoon. Three persons who were trapped in the building were saved and the rescue operation was going on at the time of filing this report.  The office of Ambika Builders, which was being operated from the companys showroom collapsed, on the busy Kharar-Landran road at around 12.30 pm.  Deputy Commissioner (DC) Girish Dayalan said the teams of Fire Brigade, National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) and the local administration were carrying out rescue work.  Police said the structure collapsed while a plot behind the building, where the company was constructing a hotel, was being dug up.  The basement for the construction of a hotel was dug up behind the building. At the time of the incident, some of the employees were in the office. The entire building collapsed after the wall which was towards the dug up plot had caved in. A JCB was also buried under the debris, Kharar DSP Pal Singh said.  The deceased, Harwinder Singh, was a resident of Morinda in Ropar district. Harwinder was working in had come to India around two months ago. The officials said that he had called his family while being trapped in the collapsed building.  Kharar (city) SHO Inspector Bhagwant Singh said that they could confirm if any other person was trapped under the debris only after the rescue operations are over.  Punjab Chief Minister Captain Amrinder Singh asked the DC to conduct an inquiry and file a detailed report to him. The DC also marked a magisterial inquiry into the incident and asked Kharar Sub-Divisional Magistrate (SDM) Himanshu Jain to submit the report to him.  Anguished to learn of the collapse of a three-storeyed building in Kharar today with 2 people trapped. @NDRF, Fire Brigade & Mohali Admin are on the spot for immediate rescue and relief. Have asked DC Mohali @Girish Dayalan to send a detailed report on what caused this collapse, Amarinder tweeted.  According to the officials, the rescued persons  Harjeet Singh, Armaan and Prem Bahadur  were admitted to hospital. Harjeet Singh, was taken out from under the debris at around 8:30 pm by the NDRF team. He was admitted to Kharar Civil Hospital where his condition was said to be stable.  Harjeet is a resident of Ghruan village and was working at Ambika Builders as an accountant. He had contacted his colleagues and the NDRF team when he was trapped inside the building. He was located at around 6 pm. First he was given the water, he was saved as he was trapped in a room, the lentil was broken and he was rescued, a police official who was part of the rescue operation said.  Armaan sustained minor injuries and was discharged, while Prem Bahadur, who was working as a peon at Ambika Builders office had a fracture. He was admitted to Kharar civil hospital.  The building owner, Parveen Kumar Soni, could not be reached for comments.  Whether people working on the site had taken adequate permission or if safeguards were adopted are a subject matter of probe, Dayalan said.  When asked that whether the building was legal, the DC said that he will check that whether the building was legal and necessary permissions were obtained by the builder. If any violation was done by the builder, necessary action will be initiated against him, the DC added. Kharar Estate Officer Sangeet Ahluwalia said that the builder had the permission to dig up the basement and the building was legal. Inspector Bhagwant Singh said they were yet to register the case.  The DC, when asked about the rescue operations, said that the NDRF team with specialised equipment was called from Panchkula. He said a team of 25 NDRF personnel was carrying out the rescue work. He added that a back-up team from Ludhiana was also called. The Western Command of Army was contacted and are on standby, the DC added.  The local residents had started the rescue work , while the NDRF team reached at around 2.30 pm. Eight JCBs were pressed into service to clear the debris and to remove the heavy mobile towers which fell with the building.  Jaspreet Singh who was working as accountants at the office, said he was outside the building. We suspect that the JCB operator might have broken one of the pillars which lead to the collapse of the building, Jaspreet Singh said. Raj Kumar, who work at the building said the company was planning to shift the office to another place in the coming few days as the construction was going on.",MASUR DAL

While Saketh Myneni and Niki Poonacha knocked out higher-ranker opponents, Sumit Nagal underlined his class with a comfortable win.  Poonacha created a huge stir, taking out favourite Lukas Rosol 6-4, 2-6, 6-3 in the second round. Rosol, who famously upset Rafael Nadal in the second round of Wimbledon 2012, struggled to get going against Poonacha.  For Poonacha, ranked 937 places below Rosol, this was the biggest victory of his career. I received a wild-card for this tournament, and I wanted to make the most of it. This win is a huge confidence boost, the 24-year-old Poonacha said.  As the crowd began to swell in the evening session, Nagal took centrestage. Armed with a crushing forehand, Nagal whipped Tunisias Malek Jaziri 6-0, 6-4. Jaziri made the mistake of dropping too many short balls, which Nagal had little trouble dispatching for winners.  Nagal ran around the ball to get his forehand into play  a ploy that worked well. My forehand is my strength. Im not going to defeat anyone with a serve-and-volley game, Nagal said.  The 22-year-old Nagal, however, must be worried about his weak serve, which conceded seven double-faults.  Jaziri, who reached a career-high world ranking of 42 only a year ago, made too many unforced errors. Jaziri was unhappy with a few line calls, but his protests had little impact on the outcome of the match.  Myneni, meanwhile, recorded a 6-3, 6-3 win over sixth-seeded Russian Evgeny Donskoy. Sasikumar Mukund was the rare Indian to disappoint, losing 5-7, 3-6 to Ilya Ivashka of Belarus.  The results: Second round: Saketh Myneni bt Evgeny Donskoy (Rus) 6-3, 6-3; Sumit Nagal bt Malek Jaziri (Tun) 6-0, 6-4; Yuichi Sugita (Jpn) bt Vaclav Safranek (Cze) 6-4, 6-3; Niki Poonacha bt Lucas Rosol (Cze) 6-4, 2-6, 6-3; Ilya Ivashka (Blr) bt Sasikumar Mukund 7-5, 6-3.

After five gruelling rounds, Mohamed Safwat became the first Egyptian to win an ATP Challenger title in 24 years. In fact, Safwat (World No 130) is the only Egyptian player in the top 350 and to qualify for a Grand Slam main draw (Australian Open).  The next best is Karim-Mohamed Maamoun (No 365). In the womens, Mayar Sherif is World No 189. I didnt know that I became the first Egyptian to win a title since 1996. Personally, it was a big step for me, said Safwat.  The problem is tennis isnt popular in Egypt so it was off the media since 1996 and we hardly had funds coming. We have no Challengers there either. But I think its slowly catching up. When I was playing the final in Australia, I found some Egyptians supporting me. We just need time to build this culture. With his Launceston title, it has now got the boost it needed.  Safwat will be the first Egyptian tennis player to compete at the Olympics. Its always an honour for any athlete to represent their country at the Olympics. It will inspire many kids, dream about it and work towards it because one from their country made it, said the 29-year-old. Thats why we have started receiving funds from the government. But its not enough as coaches, the players entourage and travelling  all of them are expensive. Although its not enough, we have to manage with that for now.  I hope with more achievements, businessmen and sponsors start to look into tennis. With a title in the bag and the Olympics around, Safwat wants to push for bigger challenges ahead. Bengaluru Open is his first step towards that goal.  On Wednesday, he staved off a challenge from Australian Matthew Ebden to win 7-6(5), 6-7(1), 7-5 in over three hours to reach the third round. My target is to get into the top 100 this year and I am pretty close to it. A couple of good results will put me closer to that goal. The next target is to prepare well for the Olympics, not just show up there. For that, I need to play in higher-level tournaments. With that, I want to share my knowledge with the kids so that they can get the help I didnt get. Thats my goal now, said Safwat.

But at Holiday Inns Romance, Roses and Revelry  a candlelight dinner at Cafe G  love was on the menu too. An explosion of cuisines, the array of delectable dishes on display started right where the elevator door swung open. A little cart doling out varieties of chaat stood at the door of the cafe, offering only a glimpse of what awaited you inside.  The real culinary and visual delight began when you entered the restaurant, with heart-shaped decorations and roses everywhere you turn. In the corner of your eyes, you could catch the bright red beet & goat cheese terrine, seated alongside a more pastel guava and mango jelly in a small heart-shaped dish. The cream cheese, surprisingly, did not overpower the earthiness of the beetroot and was a mouthful of flavours. However, the guava jelly, although visually-appealing, still retained hints of the taste of gelatin. The bland tulsi malai hari mirch ka paneer tikka and the dry podi-idli also fell short of the target. But the buttery and crumbly crust of the butter chicken tart and the chicken pate bruschetta are worthy mentions. Apart from these, the counter was chock-a-block with salads, cheeses, roulades, cold cuts, and unexpectedly, vegetarian carpaccios. And these were just the starters.  A lychee-flavoured mocktail, obviously very pink, was an absolute delight for an occasional sip, every time you got up to refill your plate. The main dishes at first glance seemed like organised chaos, but on conversing with Chef Kuldeep Singh, it all seemed to fall into place. My father was a chef too, and growing up, all I loved to do was cook with him. He was always experimenting with dishes, and a medley of recipes is what I associate with love, he said. With this spread, I wanted to innovate and pack a flavourful punch.  And a flavourful punch it was, with a diverse spread of Indian, Thai, Chinese, Continental and Italian dishes. There was something for everyone, starting from the roasted pumpkin and coconut soup to the wok fried mud crab in Singaporean chili sauce. The aromatic steamed jasmine rice paired with the Thai green vegetable curry was a classic, and the mixed lentil pie and the almond & parsley crusted tenderloin fillet from the continental spread was tender with mellow flavours.  True to its roots, the chicken pepper fry and the murgh Hyderabadi biryani were tasty bites, with a restrained hand on the spices. Our plate of kung pao chicken and flat rice noodles stir-fry could have used a little bit of something more to indeed hit it out of the park. Seated at a table right near the desserts, it was impossible not to sneak quick peeks at the pastry spread. Delicate French madaleines, English bread pudding and other European sweet treats shared the counter with a robust homemade Indian dessert spread. We could mention the delicious kaju katli and apple peda, but thats just quintessential scrumptiousness. But dont fret if youve missed it, Chef Singh is just getting started. This dinner menu was just a teaser of the plans I have for food festivals in the coming months. So keep an eye out, he said.",MASUR DAL

Tur procurement has started at Vikas Agros Takli centre. (Express photo by Partha Sarathi Biswas)  Why is the government still allowing imports? Why dont they come and see the crop here?, asks Kalyan Hake, pointing to the chana (chickpea) on his six acres, of which the grain on two acres has already been harvested.  As the 32-year-old farmer from Takali Bardpur in Latur taluka and district of Maharashtras Marathwada region prepares to harvest the remaining crop, Hake is visibly nervous about his prospective realisations. The governments minimum support price (MSP) for this years chana is Rs 4,875 per quintal, whereas it is already trading at Rs 4,200 now in Latur APMC (agricultural produce market committee) mandi. If rates are so low before even the marketing season has actually begun, imagine how much they will slide once the crop arrivals happen after Holi, exclaims Hake, who expects his average grain yield at 8 quintals/acre this time, as against 6 quintals for the 2018-19 crop.  ALSO READ | Being one of Indias top pulses exporter, Canada urges govt to pursue consistent farm policies  The Union Agriculture Ministry, on Tuesday, estimated Indias chana production for 2019-20 at 11.22 million tonnes (mt), up from last years 9.94 mt and marginally short of the record 11.38 mt of 2017-18. Farmers have, moreover, planted an all-time-high 107.21 lakh hectares (lh) area under this rabi (winter-spring) pulses crop, compared to 96.19 lh in 2018-19 and 107.08 lh in 2017-18. While the acreage in Madhya Pradesh has dropped from 34.32 lh to 27.38 lh  the abundant water in reservoirs and recharged aquifers from surplus rains have prompted farmers there to sow more wheat instead of chana  it has significantly gone up in states such as Maharashtra (from 13.14 lh to 21.79 lh), Rajasthan (15.03 lh to 21.38 lh), Chhattisgarh (3.71 lh to 4.11 lh) and Gujarat (1.74 lh to 3.78 lh).  At the MSP procurement centre in Takali Bardpur run by Vikas Agro Producer Company Ltd, a farmers cooperative, over 5,000 pulses growers have already registered their crop for sale. I dont know when they will start procurement and when the payment will be made into my bank account. But there is no other place I can sell today. The APMC prices are below MSP and traders say they will fall further if imports arent halted. Why cant the government just do that, rather than spending money for procurement and making us stand in lines? points out Hake.  Tur procurement has started at Vikas Agros Takli centre. (Express photo by Partha Sarathi Biswas) Tur procurement has started at Vikas Agros Takli centre. (Express photo by Partha Sarathi Biswas)  For farmers in the relatively dry Marathwada and Vidarbha region, chana is an ideal rabi crop to grow after their kharif soyabean, which is planted from mid-June (after the monsoon rains) and harvested by October. Cultivated mostly on the residual soil moisture, it requires hardly one round of irrigation, as opposed to three or more for wheat. This time, bountiful rains, especially during the second half of the monsoon (August-September) and extending till early November, has resulted in higher sowings and farmers like Hake even reporting a one-third jump in yields.  In Latur, a major chana-growing district of Maharashtra that also houses one of Indias biggest wholesale market for pulses, many farmers could not take their kharif crop due to poor rains in the first half of the monsoon (June-June). Hake is among those who was forced to skip his soyabean crop and, instead, went in for early sowing of chana towards the end of October. With harvesting going on at full swing, the not-so-great price outlook for the legume is a major worry.  At the Latur APMC, traders identify two main reasons for the current weak sentiment.  The first is imports. Since March 2018, the Narendra Modi government has clamped a 60% import duty on chana, while pegging it lower, at 40%, for the larger kabuli or garbanzo bean varieties. Earlier to that, it imposed a 50% customs duty on white/yellow peas (which are a cheap substitute for chana and even used for adulteration of besan flour made from the latter) in November 2017 and 30% on masur (lentil) in December 2017. Further, imports of tur/arhar (pigeon-pea), moong (green gram) and urad (black gram) were, in August 2017, moved from the free to the restricted list, subject to annual quantitative caps. These measures have helped stem the flow of imports from their 2016-17 and 2017-18 peaks. The current fiscal has, nevertheless, witnessed an increase, particularly of masur and chana imports (see accompanying table). Both happen to be rabi pulses crops. Masur and white/yellow peas are imported mainly from Canada, while chana is mostly supplied by Australia, tur/arhar by Myanmar, Mozambique and Tanzania, and moong and urad by Myanmar.  A second reason is the huge unsold stock of chana lying with the government from last years MSP-procured crop. The National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India (Nafed) was, as on February 17, holding 21.03 lakh tonnes (lt) of pulses in its godowns, of which chana alone comprised 15.83 lt. According to Nitin Kalantari, a leading Latur-based dal miller and pulses trader, Nafeds stocks alone are weighing down prices in the mandis. They should have offloaded this grain during the Dussehra and Diwali season, when demand for besan (used in many sweet preparations) is high. Nafed is now floating tenders to sell, right at the start of the new crops arrivals. How can prices, then, look up?, he notes.  At the Takali Bardpur procurement centre, Vilas Uphade, director of Vikas Agro, is having a tough time convincing all growers not to come with their crop now. The farmer producer company  part of the MAHA-FPC, a state-wide consortium of producer organisations/companies that is a sub-agent of Nafed for undertaking MSP procurement operations  began purchase of tur/arhar on February 18. Tur (which is harvested in December-January) is also selling at Rs 4,900 per quintal (below the MSP of Rs 5,800), but our real concern is chana. Not only is the crop much bigger this year, but many farmers have not done any kharif sowing and gone directly for chana. They need a good price for what is clearly a bumper crop, explains Uphade.  Severe water scarcity last year led Ali Mohammed Sheikh to skip his chana crop in 2018-19. The delayed onset of monsoon this time meant that he couldnt also plant the 2019 kharif soyabean. But the monsoons magic revival from August enabled this 10-acre farmer from Takali Bardpur to go for chana on eight out of his 10-acre holding. If the government procurement centres are not opened in time, I may have to settle for a price of Rs 3,500 or even lower, sighs Sheikh, who also grows sugarcane and wheat on one acre each of his balance land that has irrigation facility.",MASUR DAL

Or so I presume, after she asks me to do a recce around the National Museums Harappa gallery and see how many food-related artefacts I can count. Over 166 items later (not counting broken or chipped pieces, nor the cavalcade of cutlery and other metal utensils, or the funerary vessels scattered among the tranches of culinary as well as decorative bric-a-brac) and while Im still not finished, one begins to appreciate the amount of research it would have taken to curate the Historical Gastronomica, currently underway at the National Museum.  The festival is a look back at one of the keystone but little understood periods of Indian history: the Indus-Saraswati Civilisation, through that most basic of human needs: food. It comprises an exhibition, food tastings, curated walks through the museum, and a full sit down dinner featuring dishes in the manner they would have been prepared thousands of years in our past. It has been organised by One Station Million Stories (OSMS), a collective of conservation architects, researchers and designers, led by Chatterjee and Adarsha Kapoor, engaged in the business of storytelling through these multimedia sensoria. Resurrecting the food from our past is National Award-winning chef Sabyasachi Gorai, who will be curating two experiences over the course of the event: a Harappa food tasting taking place from 12:00pm-4:00pm, February 19-25th and a sit down full service dinner between 7:30-9:00pm, February 21-23rd.  Chatterjee did four years of soft research on the subject, before an additional year of more exhaustive research. We originally had around 750 sources before cutting that down to around 550 which actually spoke about the food of this region. As a lot of duplication happens, we finally ended up zeroing on the 150-odd sources, which weve listed here, she said, adding,  The thing is that nobody can definitively tell you this is what they ate. So we had to go back further and look at the evolving diets of early humans to those of more recent ancestors. Then there was the geography and climate that spanned the vast stretch that made up the civilisation at its peak, stretching from Balochistan to Haryana and even further, which greatly affected the culinary habits of the Indus people.  What we call the pestle stone was the grinding stone for them with which they crushed their grains and whole spices, and that was vital to them. It ground them to the places where they lived. Everything else was mobile, but that grinding stone, and the need to tend to fields of crops to provide produce for that grinding stone, thats what made them settle down. From roughly 12,000 years ago, once people began baking bread and roasting other foods, their diets naturally evolved, and thats what were looking at, said Chatterjee. So as to avoid any casus belli, the organisers have refrained from any hypotheticals or theorising about the exact origins or perceived beliefs of the people who lived in that time and space, and presented the facts exactly as they are, as evidenced from archaeological remains.  Back to the future  Where many chefs would find themselves out of their comfort zone when faced with the challenge of creating dishes out of an ancient, and very limited, list of ingredients and sans many (or any) cooking directions, Chef Sabyasachi Gorai is in his element. The son of an anthropologist and with a keen interest in ethno-historical regions and cuisines, Gorai is nigh ecstatic at the idea of curating a Harappa dining experience at the Historical Gastronomica.  To be able to cook at the National Museum is an incredible honour and to be able to do a historical recreation of food from so many thousands of years ago is both challenging and rewarding, says the chef, who sifted through the vast tracts of research done by the team at OSMS, in conjunction with other scholars, to figure out what could be served.Ive had to prepare the menu out of a very limited larder, restricted to the few winter vegetables that would have been available during the end of winter during that time. There are very few spices as well, including fresh and dried turmeric, coriander, cinnamon, cumin, and yellow and black mustard.  Thankfully there were also grains, pulses and legumes, and so we can do a fairly representative selection, says Gorai. Given this is the first time ever that the National Museum is having a dining experience (that too of this magnitude and scale) the pressure is enormous, as is the potential pay-off. If we can pull it off successfully, it would open the doors for other such immersive experiences, and just think of how fantastic that would be: eating food from these iconic periods in our modern setting. Its an incredible way to engage with the past, enthuses the chef.  Among the dishes were whole green peas simmered in a light broth (The Harappa people didnt waste any part of their produce, from husk to root, notes Gorai), a gentle lentil stew, crisp barley bread, and a fascinatingly sour medley of shelled peas, capers, and Indian gooseberry (amla). Our favourite part is the dessert: puffed rice and flaxseed tossed with honey, which is like a proto-chikki; if chikki were soft and fresh and crumbling instead of packed and hard. Dont take our word for it though, go taste for yourself.    AT: The National Museum, Janpath Road  TILL: February 25",MASUR DAL

(Representational Image) The aggregate picture that emerged was simple: Pulses consumption in India is showing signs of flattening. (Representational Image)  Is there stagnation in demand for pulses, milk and other protein-rich foods in India? The National Statistical Office (NSO) withheld its household consumption expenditure survey report for 2017-18 but alternative data sources do suggest a slowdown  at least in respect of the ubiquitous dal and doodh.  At a global Pulses Conclave held earlier this month in Pune, the overwhelming concern expressed by participants was: Why are we not eating enough pulses?  One of the presentations at the event was a detailed analysis of the estimated consumption of individual pulses  chana (chickpea), yellow peas, masur (red lentil), arhar (pigeon-pea), moong (green gram) and urad (black gram)  based on year-wise opening stocks plus domestic production and imports, and deducting exports, diversion towards seed and feed, and closing stocks.  The aggregate picture that emerged was simple: Pulses consumption in India is showing signs of flattening.  Between 2013-14 and 2017-18, it rose from 18.6 million tonnes (mt) to 22.5 mt, but fell to 22.1 mt in 2018-19 and is projected to further decline to 20.7 mt this year. Some of that may be attributable to prices. Thus, 2015-16 and 2016-17 recorded a consumption drop alongside double-digit dal inflation. The peak consumption in 2017-18 was when prices actually dipped 20.8 per cent year-on-year. The link between consumption and inflation, however, breaks down from 2018-19 (see table).  Saurabh Bhartia of the Indian Pulses and Grains Association (IPGA)  the apex organisation of dal millers, traders, exporters and importers that drew up the estimates  is convinced that the apparent demand slowdown is real.  We need a National Egg Coordination Committee-like body for pulses to push consumption. The campaign they launched in the 1980s helped in positioning egg as a wholesome nutrition food. The time has come for a similar sustained drive promoting pulses as an excellent source of protein, micronutrients and fibre that is also low-fat and cholesterol-free, he says.  Nitin Kalantri, a leading dal trader and processor from Latur in Maharashtra, traces the low growth in pulses consumption to 2015-16, when retail prices of arhar dal breached the Rs 200/kg level.  EXPLAINED Linked to income With rising income, the consumption of milk, pulses, eggs and meat had increased, especially among the poor. Flattening demand growth for protein-rich foods suggests incomes arent rising as before. But whether consumption is actually slowing will be known only from the next NSO household survey.  From then, somehow a perception gained ground that pulses are expensive. Around the same time, vegetables also turned relatively cheap and consumers started having more of them in place of dal. 2017-18 was a one-off year when consumption rose on the back of a price crash, but the memories of Rs 200/kg havent gone from peoples minds, he points out.  Agreeing with Bhartia, Kalantri says: Egg has benefitted from branding, which is lacking in pulses. Moreover, you can eat it by simply boiling, unlike dal that requires seasoning and making chhonk (tempering).  But it isnt pulses alone. Data from successive annual reports of the National Dairy Development Board shows that total liquid milk marketing by cooperatives  they account for the bulk of sales in this segment  has gone up from 201.03 lakh litres per day (LLPD) in 2008-09 to 294.44 LLPD in 2013-14. In 2018-19, this figure reached just 354.53 LLPD.  ALSO READ | Pulses farmers are set to harvest a record chana crop, but their party could be spoiled by imports  In other words, a compound annual growth rate (CAGR), amounting to 7.9 per cent during 2008-09 to 2013-14, has plunged to 3.8 per cent in the last five years.  What makes this trend particularly striking  even the absolute increase in milk sales from 2013-14 to 2018-19 (60.09 LLPD) was hardly two-thirds of the earlier five years (93.41 LLPD)  is that it has occurred despite lower inflation. Between 2008-09 and 2013-14, prices of full-cream milk (containing 6 per cent fat and 9 per cent solids-not-fat) in Delhi rose from about Rs 24 to Rs 46 per litre. In the subsequent five years till March 2019, the jump was only to Rs 52 per litre.  Equally interesting is that the deceleration in milk sales has taken place when Indias production went up from 137.7 mt in 2013-14 to 187.7 mt in 2018-19, according to Department of Animal Husbandry & Dairying (DAHD) statistics. That translated into a CAGR of 6.4 per cent, as against 4.2 per cent for the five years from 2008-09, when the estimated output was 112.2 mt.  Veteran agriculture economist Ashok Gulati feels the stagnant consumption trend in both milk and pulses is largely due to incomes, which arent rising as before. This is especially for the poorer sections, whose spending on protein-rich superior foods tends to increase even more with higher incomes.  The best indicator here is rural wages. The average annual growth of wages in rural India during 2014-15 to 2018-19 was only 5.3 per cent in nominal terms and 0.6 per cent after adjusting for consumer inflation of 4.7 per cent. In the preceding five-year period, nominal rural wage growth averaged 17.6 per cent and 6.8 per cent annually in real terms.  A better idea of whats happening to demand can, perhaps, be obtained only from the NSOs next household consumption expenditure survey from July 2020 to June 2021.  The last published report for 2011-12 had revealed daily per capita consumption of milk and dairy products to have risen since 2004-05 more sharply in rural (from 128.87 ml to 144.43 ml) than in urban India (170.23 ml to 180.73 ml).  Significantly, these survey-based consumption figures were way below the DAHDs per capita daily milk availability estimate of 290 gram (282 ml) for 2011-12, which went up to 394 gram (383 ml) in 2018-19. Whether the gap between the DAHDs production and NSOs consumption numbers has further widened will be known only after the latters next survey.  For now, whats clear is this: Food has become more affordable in the last five years, as the Finance Ministrys recent Economic Survey chapter on Thalinomics has shown. But whether Indians are consuming more, as a result, isnt clear.",MASUR DAL

Ask someone what they think comprises cuisine from Karnataka and these are the answers youre likely to hear. Its exactly this misconception that Karunadu Swada 2020 aims to dispel. Currently in its third edition, the MTR Karnataka Food Festival will feature over 100 authentic dishes from six regional cuisine trails from across the state.  According to Sunay Bhasin, any familiarisation, at max, would be with Udupi cusine, but theres much more to the states fare than that. When you break down Karnataka, you can find six unique cuisine clusters within the state and we wanted to bring out dishes that were unique to each of them, says the CMO of MTR Foods. Divided into Mysuru-Bengaluru, Kodagu, Bidar-Kalaburgi-Gadag, Udupi, Belagavi  Dharwad  Vijaypura and Mangalore, each of the clusters will also focus on one forgotten dish.  There are many dishes that our grandparents prepared but we urban dwellers have lost touch with. We want people to rediscover them, adds Bhasin, who says that while chefs from MTR will oversee operations, home cooks from each region will be the ones preparing the dishes. About 8-10 home cooks will come from each region, he says.  After an in-depth cuisine study, about 1,000 recipes were drawn up from the state, of which 200 have been explored in the last two years. There are big differences in dishes, flavours and ingredients used by the different regions. For example, North Karnataka uses a lot of groundnuts, whereas the kind of chillis used in South Karnataka is different, explains Bhasin. Recently, the company also launched a packaged Gojju Masala  a masala blend for the states popular dish. The readily available powder aims to ease the process of making the dish and was an idea that was built upon after the dishs popularity at the previous edition of the Karunadu Swada. This year too, we hope to get the inspiration for another new innovation, says Bhasin.  whats in store?

(File) The Agriculture Ministry has estimated a 9.5% jump in the total acreage under rabi field crops this time compared to in 2018-19. (File)  The global spread of the coronavirus outbreak couldnt have come at a worse time for Indian farmers  just when they are set to harvest a bumper rabi crop on the back of higher plantings enabled by the wettest monsoon in 25 years and extended heavy rains till early-November.  Rising COVID-19 infection cases, including in India, has acted as a sentiment dampener ahead of the marketing season for major rabi crops, whose mandi arrivals will pick up after Holi on March 10.  The Agriculture Ministry has estimated a 9.5% jump in the total acreage under rabi field crops  especially wheat, rapeseed-mustard, chana (chickpea), masur (red lentil), matar (field pea) and maize  this time compared to in 2018-19. March is also the harvesting/marketing period for the main rabi onion, potato and garlic crops, apart from red chilli and seed spices such as jeera (cumin seed), dhaniya (coriander) and saunf (fennel).  For farmers, the price outlook was generally bullish till around mid-January. Mustard in Rajasthans Alwar mandi was quoting at an average of Rs 4,150 per quintal, as against Rs 3,800 a year ago. But the oilseed is currently trading at Rs 3,600-3,700, way below the governments minimum support price (MSP) of Rs 4,425. Chana prices at Latur in Maharashtra have, likewise, plunged to Rs 3,650 per quintal, when its MSP is at Rs 4,875.  Note: Wheat, corn and soyabean prices refer to the most actively-traded futures contracts at the Chicago Board of Trade. Raw sugar, cocoa and coffee prices are for the most actively-traded futures at the Intercontinental Exchange. Skim Milk Powder price is the average for the fortnightly Global Dairy Trade auctions. Crude palm oil price is for the most actively-traded futures at the Bursa Malaysia exchange. Rice prices are export quotes for Thai white grain with 5% broken content. Rubber price is for RSS-4 grade at Bangkok. Cotton price is the average based on the Cotlook A index.

Rubber price is for RSS-4 grade at Bangkok. Cotton price is the average based on the Cotlook A index.  The link with the coronavirus is obvious in the case of mustard. Crude palm oil prices in Malaysia had started this calendar year at 3,130 ringgits ($ 765 per tonne), with global stocks that were projected to drop to their lowest since 2009-10. But as reports of the novel virus epidemic in China gathered momentum from mid-January, prices crashed to sub-2,500 ringgits ($ 600) by end-February. Lower palm prices have, in turn, pulled down the rates for soyabean and other oilseeds, including mustard.  But it isnt vegetable oil alone. As the accompanying table shows, international prices of almost every agri-commodity have registered declines after mid-January, with rice and coffee being notable exceptions. Significantly, the current levels are still higher than a year ago in most commodities, barring soyabean, cotton and rubber. It reflects fundamental global supply tightness, also manifested in the UN Food and Agricultural Organisations Food Price Index in January touching its highest since December 2014.  That situation has, of course, reversed subsequently. Commodity markets have been singed no less than equities by COVID-19s rapid worldwide spread and reduced Chinese buying of everything, from palm oil and cotton to milk powder and meat.  For farmers, this isnt good news. Red chilli prices at Andhra Pradeshs Guntur Mirchi Yard had ruled at Rs 13,000-19,000 per quintal before mid-January, even briefly scaling a record Rs 22,000 for the premium high-pungency Teja variety grades. Those have now eased to  Rs 10,000-15,000, with expectations of a further fall due to shipments to China coming to a standstill. A bumper crop, in combination with Chinese imports not taking place, has led to jeera prices at Gujarats Unjha market hovering around Rs 13,350 per quintal, down from Rs 15,750 last year at this time.  After a poor kharif crop  impacted both by the monsoons delayed onset and unseasonal rains during maturity stage  Indian farmers are well set to reap a bountiful harvest. And with both global and domestic prices recovering after a prolonged bear phase, rural incomes till recently seemed on the cusp of a turnaround. Sadly, it looks that the coronavirus has upended those hopes. Even if China were to resume buying  inevitable at some point  that may happen only after the farmer has sold.",MASUR DAL

A flagship scheme of the MVA government, the subsidised meal would now be provided at Rs 5 per, instead of Rs 10, to one lakh poor people between 11 am and 3 pm daily across Maharashtra, he said.  The Shiv Bhojan scheme was rolled out in January to provide food to 18,000 needy persons for just Rs 10. It was later extended to 36,000 people. The decision to expand the subsidised cooked meal scheme comes as the pandemic has dealt a severe blow to the livelihoods of several labourers, migrants and the poor, many of whom have set out on foot to reach their native villages or towns hundreds of kilometres away.

The directive issued by the department also categorically warns officials to not turn away any individual from a counter seeking a meal. They have been directed to create a network to ensure all vulnerable daily wage labourers without jobs and earnings are given priority. They also have been told to reach out and provide meals to the homeless, people living on footpaths, agriculture labourers, and small and marginal farmers reeling under financial hardships.  In a webcast earlier in the day, Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray also assured that his government will take care of all migrant labourers and provide them basic necessities like food and water. The state will protect them and provide food, but they should not leave their place. I understand they are anxious but they should not leave.

The state government has allocated Rs 160 crore for further subsidising the meal scheme that will continue till June. The government will provide a subsidy of Rs 45 per platter to urban centres and Rs 30 per platter to rural ones. The actual cost of each Shiv Bhojan platter in urban areas is Rs 50 and in rural parts is Rs 35. The full meal comprises bread (roti), lentil (dal), rice, two vegetables and curd.

But theres a new problem springing up  shortage of labour in mandis. This market has 6,000 hammal (loaders) and tolai (weighmen).

On March 27, the association decided to restart auctions at the market yard from April 1. However, Ursal is sceptical when that can happen  How will this market work without labourers?.  This isnt an isolated case.  The dal mill of Kalantry Food Products outside Latur city has not been open for at least a week. Most of our 200 workers are from Bihar and Chhattisgarh. They went on March 21, the day before the Janata Curfew. Getting them back is out of the question now, says Nitin Kalantri, CEO of the company, one of Indias biggest pulses miller and trader.

They managed to take the last trains home before the lockdown  unlike the lakhs of stranded migrant workers who had to trek long distances from Delhi and neighbouring industrial areas.  Kalantri claims that the images of what these workers have gone through and the fear of this lockdown not being the last have further fueled the insecurity among the few remaining labourers This, despite the Latur Municipal Corporation arranging food and temporary accommodation for them in schools.  At the Latur APMC  a major wholesale market for pulses and soyabean  the last auctions took place on March 20, which was a Friday. The majority of our 6,000-odd labourers are from Bihar and Chhattisgarh. They have all gone and cannot return even if they want to. How can we run this market with a skeletal staff? says an APMC official.  This situation  wherein trade and movement in food produce has been technically allowed but there is no labour available in mandis to unload, clean, weight and reload grain  isnt specific to Maharashtra. According to Pavan Toshniwal, a dal trader at Karnatakas Gulbarga mandi, 90 per cent of the APMCs roughly 2,000 labourers have gone. They are all again from Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and Chhattisgarh. The exodus actually began after March 13, when the first coronavirus-related death was reported from Gulbarga. The 300 or so dal mills in and around Gulbarga have also stopped running due to non-availability of labour.  Yogesh Agarwal, a dal miller and trader from Indore in Madhya Pradesh, says only 30 of the regions 230 mills are currently running. Even if farmers bring their chana or tur crop today, the APMC here will not be able to function as almost all the 1,000-plus labourers in the mandi have left for their home states of Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Bihar, he states.  If marketing of the new rabi crop is going to be an issue, no less a roadblock is transportation of the produce to consuming centres, particularly in distant areas. On paper, goods-carrying vehicles are allowed and it is possible that even the current hold-ups at state borders will go. But how many truck drivers would be willing to do long hauls when there are no roadside restaurants or dhabas? And what if their vehicle breaks down? notes Kalantri.  The roadblocks, millers and traders believe, may squeeze the supply chain for agri produce in the days to come.  Also, for the first time, the importance of a vital link in this chain  the migrant labourer  is beginning to be felt.",MASUR DAL

For instance, rice is being retailed at Rs 850 per 25kg pack now as against Rs 770 a week back.Similarly, wheat flour rate has increased to Rs 350 per 5 kg pack now from Rs 270, while masoor dal rate has gone up to Rs 80/kg from Rs 60/kg. There is Rs 1-6 per pack increase in biscuits in this locality.Sarai Kale Khan houses a large number of migrant workers who work in Ashram, Nizamuddin, Bhogal, Jangpura, Lajpat Nagar and Okhla Mandi . Many work as labourers in local kirana shops, which are exempted from the ongoing lockdown enforced to combat coronavirus.""Everything has become expensive in Sarai Kale Khan after the Nizamuddin incident. There is more police security now. With no job and less money, survival has become difficult. On top of it, kirana shops in the area are selling essentials at prices higher than MRP,"" Sabeen, a migrant worker from Bihar, told PTI.Amid tightened security, small kirana shops in the locality are not able to replenish their stock from nearly Bhogal market, one of the oldest wholesale markets in Delhi, and therefore selling whatever stock left at a higher rate, she added.Even hawkers are seeing the trend in the locality and selling vegetables at a much higher rate than other places.Sharing that life under the lockdown has become more stressful, Saleem, who is a private garbage collector in Jangpura but resides in Sarai Kale Khan, said: ""I don't have any more money to survive for next few weeks. I borrowed some from friends, but everything has become costlier.""Not only migrant workers, even kirana shop owners in Bhogal and Lajpat Nagar areas are facing labour shortage after their labourers were stopped from stepping out of the locality by the police.A wholesaler of rice, wheat flour and edible oils in the Bhogal market said on condition of anonymity, ""Four of our labourers who live in Sarai Kale Khan are not able to come for work after the Nizamuddin incident. They are locked up in the locality with others. There is huge demand for essentials from consumers but no labourers to handle.""Many of the kirana shops in Bhogal are delivering essential items directly to consumers living in nearby localities, but the shortage of labourers has added to their problem.The Delhi Police has tightened the security in Sarai Kale Khan as some of the labourers from here work in shops located around Tablighi Jamaat 's headquarters at Nizamuddin West from where over 2,000 were evacuated this week following a religious congregation that took place last month with thousands of attendees in the middle of a global pandemic.Many of the attendees have tested positive for coronavirus.The event became a key source for the spread of COVID-19 in India as many of the participants travelled to various parts of the country for missionary works.",MASUR DAL

(Express photo) Staffer Archana Bhoye at Kurze-Dhodipada anganwadi, which is yet to receive grocery packages. (Express photo)  A FLAGSHIP pan-India programme to provide supplementary nutrition to the most marginalised, poor children and mothers, is faltering in large pockets across Maharashtra just as beneficiary families run out of earnings and savings during the ongoing 21-day national lockdown.  Under the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) programme, anganwadi centres across India serve nutritious meals to children up to the age of 6 years and to expectant and nursing mothers. But anganwadis now closed, and the delivery of these meals has completely halted in some pockets, while elsewhere beneficiaries are beginning to receive grocery supplies instead of hot cooked meals (HCM). Among the latter, there are wide complaints of inadequate supplies. Meanwhile, an army of anganwadi workers, all women, grapples with long-pending payments while trying to keep the critical scheme afloat.  Read| Excess stocks of the Food Corporation of India must be released to the poor  About 87 lakh children aged up to 6 years are beneficiaries of the scheme, served by nearly 90,000 anganwadis. The ICDS programme is a Centrally supported clutch of schemes offering, among other things, supplementary nutrition to children up to six years, and expectant and nursing mothers. Of 553 ICDS projects in the state, 364 are in rural areas.  Even in scheduled areas of Palghar district where malnutrition is a recurring problem, anganwadis such as those in Karajgaon-Vasa, Kurze-Dhodipada and Kurze Kompada havent received the grocery material yet, 16 days into the national lockdown and more than 20 days since Maharashtras anganwadis were shuttered. Similarly, supplies have not arrived in large parts of Aurangabad, Parbhani, Akola and Sangli. In some districts, groceries have arrived at urban anganwadis only.  Where the material has arrived, packages containing 2 kg each of rice, wheat, dal and chana as well as cooking oil, salt and spices, there are multiple operational problems. In many villages its not possible to go door-to-door, houses are far apart and I wouldnt be able to carry more than one parcel at a time, said Swati Meshram, anganwadi sevika at the Talasari-2 unit. With the government not providing any additional funds for gloves and masks, she instructed beneficiaries to gather at the anganwadi where she distributed the parcels, insisting that everyone first wash their hands at the door.  Another dilemma is that the grocery packages will most certainly be consumed by the entire household. Women, including those who are pregnant or lactating, could benefit the least as theyre the last to eat. There is no work, nobody has earned any wages since March 15-16, so obviously whatever comes home is shared by everyone, said Jamni Rama Valvi, the 60-year-old helper at the Patilpada anganwadi, where supplies arrived three days back. Two kg packets wont last more than eight-10 days for average families, less for larger families, she said. Pramila Surti, nursing a 10-month-old baby, she said the packages were simply added to the fast-depleting household food stocks.  In tribal-dominated, remote villages where disparities in nutrition and health services are already wide, the missing meal for children and new mothers could have long-term impacts. Incidence of malnutrition is almost certain to rise in some areas, says Shubha Shamim of the Maharashtra State Anganwadi Workers Action Committee. Especially if the lockdown continues and these problems persist.  In Kurze-Dhodipada where the grocery supplies havent come and beneficiary families are waiting expectantly, anganwadi worker Archana Bhoyes bigger problem is how to keep the scheme functioning when she hasnt been paid for three months for childrens meals and for six months for the Amrut Aahar meal for pregnant and lactating women. Were asked to supply a full nutritious meal in Amrut Aahar for Rs 35, including two vegetables, rice, dal, roti and an egg or a laddoo. Its already impossible within that cost, and then the government does not clear our outstanding dues for months on end, she said. With 51 children and 3 women beneficiaries, her approximate expenses are Rs 3,000 per month for one category of beneficiaries. Others have larger groups, and larger pending payments. At Kurze-Kompada, anganwadi worker Sheela Dhodi is the sole earning member of her household of four. Times get tougher for anganwadi workers also, how long will we be able to wait? she said.  On March 31, in addition to the ICDS Commissionerates order at the start of the lockdown that the HCM be replaced by grocery packages, the Tribal Development Department directed that the HCM be home-delivered for pregnant and lactating women wherever possible in scheduled areas, and a weeks supply of eggs and bananas also be delivered for beneficiary children. On April 1, after a week of the scheme being stalled, when villages in tribal-dominated Jawhar taluka began to receive the HCM in packets, the van arrived as late as 4 pm at some households. Now it comes at 8 am, whether its lunch for the women or cooked eggs for kids, everything is received at 8 am, said Sundar Saapta, anganwadi sevika of Palaspada village. For children beneficiaries, villages here are not yet receiving either the HCM or grocery packages, said Vandana Lokhande of the anganwadi at Walvanda village.  In Vidarbhas remote areas such as Dharni in Amravati and parts of Gadchiroli, anganwadi workers are not sure how to distribute the foodgrain  when it arrives  without any transportation. Where hamlets are located a long way off , distribution is going to be a challenge, said Dileep Utane, president of the CPI-affiliated All India Trade Union Congresss union for anganwadi workers. He said supplies arrived in Gondia, Gadchiroli and Wardha, but not at all anganwadis. In Wardha, for example, the rations for children aged between 3 to 6 years has not arrived in many projects. These are children of very poor people, labourers, marginal farmers, etc. The meal is even more critical for them at this time.  Then there is the problem of inadequate supplies. While unions had sought all-inclusive packages, Utane said anganwadi workers in many parts of Vidarbha are having to divide or measure out the material. Unable to count everything when it arrives, anganwadi workers are finding items short while distributing, maybe a packet of oil or a packet of rice, and then there are complaints, Utane said. He cited one instance where an anganwadi worker was accused in the local press of selling some items.  Minister for Women and Child Development Yashomati Thakur admitted that the take home ration is delayed in some parts, either due to the supply chain problems amid the lockdown or availability of specific items, such as masoor dal. But we are very sensitive about the issue, and we are working to resolve problems wherever they exist. The hot cooked meal is an impossibility right now, but the supply of nutrients is important and will be continued, she told The Indian Express. Protective gear including masks and gloves for anganwadi workers is also being provided at various places by local government agencies, she said.

PATIALA: The self-styled Nihang, Balwinder Singh , who brutally attacked policemen at Patiala vegetable market on Sunday morning and severed the left hand of assistant sub-inspector Harjeet Singh, was dreaded in the 12 villages surrounding his dera, and had many criminal cases against him.  He not only grabbed two acres of land marked as a village pond in the revenue records to set up the Khichri Sahib gurdwara near Balbera village but also forced a local commission agent Bhupinder Singh to hand over his 1.5 acres of land adjacent to the complex. The latter withdrew his police complaint after Balwinder threatened to eliminate his family.  Attack on cop  Balwinder used legend to get gurdwara built  The head of Budha Dal sect of Nihangs, Baba Balbir Singh, has already declared that Balwinder had nothing to do with Nihangs. According to the villagers, he came to village about 20 years ago from Ahmedgarh in Sangrur district after reportedly committing a robbery at a cinema hall during the peak of terrorism.  He took shelter at the village gurdwara after telling the head granthi that he wanted to do sewa at the shrine. The kind-hearted head granthi allowed him to stay there, said Kirpal Singh, a local resident.  Balwinder then heard of the legend of how a village woman had offered the Sikhs ninth master Guru Teg Bahadur some Khichri (rice and lentil porridge), and concocted a story that he had identified the site where this was done and he was going to build a gurdwara there. The place that he projected was a driedup village pond of Balbera, he said.  He spent two years propounding this theory and soon people started thronging the place where Khichri was offered as prasad. Balwinder soon grabbed 1.5 acres of land belonging to a local commissioner agent Bhupinder Singh. In just a few years he saw a sudden rise in his riches.  Another resident Gian Singh said everyone in the nearby 12 villages feared Balwinder Singh as he was known to act in rage, grabbing land and misbehaving.  According to the villagers, Balwinder also grabbed some land on Indo-Nepal border and sent one of his close confidants to look after the place last year.  In 2005, he and his men forcibly picked up some sheep from Karhali village for slaughtering and misbehaved with the villagers who came to intercede in the matter. Later, in a meeting of 35 villages convened at Karhali gurdwara his social boycott was announced, said Sardara Singh of Karhali village.  After that, the footfall at his gurdwara came down drastically, but he still managed to prevail upon some villagers to visit. The sum of Rs 39 lakh recovered from his dera along with weapons and cannabis by the cops on Sunday, had been collected from devotees for buying some more land in his name.  Two days back, in violation of the curfew and the advisory on social distancing, he announced that he would organise a community kitchen on the Baisakhi. On coming to know this, police put up a check post near the vegetable market. When he and his men were stopped from going to the market as they did not have curfew passes, they attacked the cops.  Patiala SSP Mandeep Singh Sidhu said they were trying to verify all the information gathered so far on Balwinders past. The Patiala cops have also written to the Enforcement Directorate and income-tax department to investigate the source of Rs 39 lakh cash haul.  11-day remand for 10 accused  Of the 11 Nihangs, including a woman, arrested by the Patiala police on Sunday after the incident, 10 were produced before the court of chief judicial magistrate in Patiala district court complex on Monday and remanded to police custody till April 24. The Pasiana cops told the court that they had recovered huge quantities of cannabis and poppy husk along with 3,000 drug pills and they had sent 38 bottles containing some chemicals to the Kharar laboratory for examination. One of the injured accused, who is admitted at Government Rajindra Hospital is yet to be produced before the court.  Captain speaks to ASI  Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh on Monday spoke to ASI Harjeet Singh to enquire about his post-operative condition. Amarinder cited a similar experience of an associate who had also lost a hand and had to undergo a similar surgery and was now healthy. Meanwhile, DGP Dinkar Gupta said that PGI director Jagat Ram who had met the ASI this morning, cautioned against him getting too many visitors.",MASUR DAL

My in-laws are stuck here in Bengaluru with us. They came from Delhi and couldnt get back because the lockdown had started. So, cooking has become the main activity of the day. I think that the best way to spend this time is to cook something nice and share it with the family. That is the way I am looking at it.  Yesterday was a vegetable fajita day along with broccoli and almond soup. For lunch today, we had Indian food. There was pan-fried arbi, masoor dal, aloo gobi, rice and chutney. My wife has cooked dinner today: appam, vegetable stew and pomfret masala and we are having a glass of red wine. She and my son also made a French vanilla cake with sprinkles on top. I am pescatarian technically so its a feast for me today.  My wife is also trying her hand at Thai green curry with vegetables and Thai red curry with prawns. That is the combination she likes to follow. We had a very nice, spicy, tangy salad that day made with raw mango, cucumber, cabbage and carrot with a Thai-style dressing. These are the things we have been cooking at home. Its been a mix of various things: from Mexican and Thai to regular Indian khana.  Basically, everybody is contributing. Some things are being cooked by my mother-in-law, some by my wife and some by me. My 14-year-old daughter is also very fond of cooking and cooks often. She made a cinnamon roll the other day. My son, who is 12 years old, doesnt cook often. Once in a while, his mother will tell him to help her, or learn something, and then he will.

Add curry leaves followed by onions and stir-fry for a couple of minutes over medium heat. Add ginger and slit green chillies and stir-fry for a minute or so more before adding the vegetables and continuing the cooking process for a couple of minutes. Add water and coconut milk and bring to boil. Reduce heat to simmer and cook for 15minutes or so until the vegetables are tender. Server with appam or Kerala red rice.

I am also working on the new menus for the airport lounges in Bengaluru. The lounges are undergoing a complete makeover and will hopefully be opening soon, after the situation is over.  To do trials at home for some dishes may be possible, but it is difficult without all the different ingredients that you require. Some simpler dishes, we can do.  My advice is that [now] is a great opportunity for those who dont cook to learn how to cook and share their dishes with their family at home. Right now, you cant share it with friends (laughs) because of social distancing. We are following that. We are not going out at all except to buy essentials like medicines and vegetables.

The prices of popular dals such as moong (yellow petite lentils), chana ( chickpea ), masoor (red lentils) and tur ( pigeon pea ) in the wholesale market have surged in the range of 10-15%.  According to traders, the wholesale price of yellow moong dal has surged to Rs 114 from Rs 100 per kilogram, while green moong dal price has firmed up from around Rs 90 to Rs 105 per kg.  Availability of pulses in wholesale markets also an issue  The price of masoor has moved up from Rs 60 to Rs 70. Chana dal price has risen to Rs 60-61 from Rs 52-53 and that of tur have inched up to Rs 76-77 from Rs 72-72 per kg.  In retail market, prices of masoor and chana dals have crossed Rs 100 and currently being sold for Rs 100 to Rs 105 per kg. The prices of premium yellow moong dal has increased to Rs 150 from Rs 110 per kg, said Ketan Marwadi, a city-based retailer.  The main reasons for the spike in prices are supply chain disruption and increase in cost of transportation for procuring these pulses, Sureshbhai Korwani , committee member, Ahmedabad Grain Merchants Association , a body of local pulses and grains wholesalers in Ahmedabad.  Before lockdown, the cost of transporting pulses from Jalgaon in Maharashtra to Ahmedabad in Gujarat used to be Rs 120-130 per quintal. Recently, I had to cough up Rs 260 per quintal for the same, he added.  The availability of pulses in wholesale markets is also an issue. Even dal millers have raw material but they are complaining about the lack of manpower to process raw material to make dals, said another trader.  The prices will further increase as there is a supply shortage and even the wholesale dealers, mainly in Madhupura area of Ahmedabad, are not opening their shops, added Ketan Marwadi.  Even malls have run out branded packaged dals and they are selling loose dals.",MASUR DAL

Immediately, men, women and children queue up at the Shiv Bhojan Thali centre  some with masks and others using clothes to cover their nose and mouth.  The queue is disciplined, each comes up to the counter, collects a food packet, looks at a mobile-camera, shouts his or her name and moves ahead. Fifty-something Vedahi Shinde, who worked as a domestic help until the nationwide lockdown was announced, says: No wonder we are disciplined, we do this every day. This is how we get our days meal.  A flagship scheme of the Uddhav Thackeray government, the subsidised meal is provided at Rs 5 per, instead of Rs 10, to one lakh poor people between 11 am and 3 pm daily across 684 eateries in Maharashtra. On Monday, as per the data provided by the government, 1.8 lakh thalis were distributed.  The scheme is operational at 25 locations in Mumbai (Santacruz, Vile Parle, Andheri, Wadala and Kandivali-Goregaon areas). For many like Vedahi, the meals  comprising two chapatis, daal, rice and sabzi  is the only definite source of food in the day.  Every day since the shut down, workers, watchman and domestic helps, who now find themselves without work, line up waiting to be fed by the government shelters  or anyone else.  Conversation about relaxation of the lockdown and availability of food is constant outside all centres.  Kamlesh Yadav, who was standing in the queue with his wife and two children at the Shiv Bhojan centre on Film City road, asked, When will this lockdown end? I have no means to provide food for my family. I used to clean the premises in and around studios in Film City. For the last two days, I have been giving Rs 5 for each parcel of the food I will run out of money soon. Today, we were told that food is for free, lets see how long they give it for free.  Each centre on an average is preparing 1,000 rotis, 25 kg of rice, 40 to 45 kg of vegetables and 30 to 35 kg of lentil per day. Owners running the centres, who are distributing nearly 500 meals everyday since April 1, some for even free, said that overpriced ration and lack of transportation are the biggest hurdles. I am using my own car to transport vegetables and other raw materials. There is no transport chain available. Even the quality of ration is not good. I am paying double the normal price, said Nevil Kotak, who runs the centre on SV Road at Goregaon West.

(PTI)  A day after he inducted five ministers in his cabinet, Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan on Wednesday allocated portfolios with BJP legislators getting the key departments.  The important portfolios of health and home were allocated to senior BJP leader Narottam Mishra. Another important portfolio of agriculture and farmers welfare went to BJP MLA Kamal Patel. Madhya Pradesh is procuring wheat, chana, mustard and lentil from farmers in 49 out of 52 districts.  Jyotiraditya Scindia loyalists Tulsiram Silawat and Govind Rajput were given charge of water resources and cooperatives portfolios respectively. Silawat held the health portfolio in the Kamal Nath government while Rajput was revenue and transport minister. Both had resigned as MLAs and will have to win bye-elections to validate their stay in office.

The portfolios have been allocated keeping the coronavirus challenge in mind, Chouhan clarified, adding that once lockdown is lifted there will be further expansion of the cabinet. He indicated portfolios will then be reallocated.  After working alone for nearly a month since he took oath on March 23, Chouhan expanded his cabinet after facing criticism that the one-man cabinet was proving unequal to the task as the count of positive cases and death toll continued to climb.  The Cabinet expansion, it is learnt, was delayed because the BJP was finding it difficult to strike a balance between its senior leaders and Scindia loyalists. And this is learnt to have forced the ruling party to name a truncated Cabinet.  The expansion is learnt to have caused heartburn in some senior BJP leaders. Rajputs induction has reportedly upset former Leader of Opposition Gopal Bhargav and former Home Minister Bhupendra Singh because they both belong to Sagar region.

And this is because he has two homes.  Dilli and Majhiaon are both alike for me, explains Daya Shankar Singh. In his early 40s, Mr Singh is referring to the city where he came into his own and to the village in Bihar where he was born. And by Dilli, he doesnt mean Delhi but Gurugram, in the National Capital Region, where he has been working as a bookstore assistant since 2005.  At the moment, Mr Singh is in his village house, where his family lives. He boarded a train from New Delhi railway station just before the announcement of the nationwide lockdown caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Nobody has the virus in the village, he says, talking on WhatsApp video. The gentlemans voice is balmy and hearing him speak plunges one into soothing illusions, as if all wars had ended and the world was at peace. He shows his home through the phone screen that connects him to this reporter. There is his mother, Sukwaro Devi, wife, Lalita Devi, and five childrenAnju, Sanju, Raj, Kajal and Usha. Playful Usha is constantly crashing into the screen by rushing behind her fathers back. The walls are decked with posters of gods and goddesses.  How can Mr Singh spend most of his time so far from his small children, one might wonder.  There is the matter of earning money, of course. But I have a family in Dilli too. He is talking of four friends with whom he shares a one-room dwelling in Gurugrams Chakkarpur village. In fact, Mr Singh says that, to him, the whole of Gurugram looks like his village. In Gurgaon, I keep bumping into people from my Bihar village or from the neighbouring villages. Most of these acquaintances, he says, happen to work in the city as security guards, car park attendants and food delivery men. Two of Mr Singhs roomies also work as guards. He is the only bookstore assistant he knows. But I also started as a guard, he says.  Years ago, a bookstore owner asked a security guard at duty in the Galleria Market if he could help her find some educated person for her shop. That night, the guard thought for a long time about his own potential. Next morning he went to her shop, still holding on to his lathi (wooden baton), and offered the shop owner his own services. The woman might have been surprised  and unsure. The man was a school drop-out. She took out a book from a shelf and asked him to read the title written in English. It was Two Lives, by Vikram Seth... I read it immediately, recalls Mr Singh. He was hired.  Now, holed up in his village, Mr Singh feels contended with his life, despite early adversitiesFather died, I couldnt study beyond class 10th.  He was 26 when he decided to move to Delhi. His wife pleaded him not to leave the village and to stay with her. I said we have nothing... I have to go.  He took the bus to the nearest railway station in Ara and from there he boarded the Delhi-bound Jan Sadharan Express, a train that only has general compartment coaches, which are cheap and for which you dont need previous booking. It took him 16 hours to reach the Capital. On the way, the only thing he ate was the home-cooked litti that his wife had packed for him in a plastic bag.  Over the years, Mr Singh would regularly return home to visit the family but Delhi too became home.  These days, as the pandemic rages across the world, and as the bookstore in which he works stays closed, Mr Singh is busy growing channa and masoor dal on his little piece of land, which he would rent to other farmers while in Delhi. He has no plans to be a farmer though, he quickly clarifies. Im missing the bookshop, missing meeting the customers, talking to them, seeing new things...  He is hopeful that the lockdown will soon be history so that he can return to Delhi. Now he gathers his family to pose for a formal portrait, and he stands among them with the quiet confidence of a successful man.  SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON",MASUR DAL

The semi-solid rice and lentil stew is the only food she can swallow without having to chew, for the comfort of her dislocated jaw.  My jaw hurts due to which I cant eat food. Because of the pain, I only prefer something light like juice, said the 16-year-old who has been staying in a tent outside the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) here along with her father since the lockdown began.  The father-daughter duo came to the national capital from Nepals Parsa district in February for Kumaris jaw surgery at the premier medical institution.  There was a tumour in her jaw which doctors at the AIIMS surgically removed two years ago along with her jawbone, which they had replaced with metal plates.  In February 2018, we came to Delhi after the Cancer Hospital in Nepal referred my daughter to AIIMS. The doctors here took out the jawbone and placed a metal plate. They said that after one year, they will take a bone from her leg and place it in her jaw, said Nand Kishore, Kumaris father.  Kishore, 39, himself cannot walk without support from a stick due to a backbone injury for which he underwent surgery in Nepal around four years ago.  Kumaris surgery, initially scheduled for February 25, was postponed several times, finally being rescheduled for March 24.  But the Prime Minister imposed a lockdown in the country after the Janta Curfew on March 22. We spoke to the doctors and they said nothing can be done about my daughters condition till the lockdown is in place, Kishore said.  The metal plates in Kumaris jaw have now dislocated. In need of an urgent surgery, she is mostly under enormous pain.  I had Rs 15,000 when I left Nepal and thought it would be enough for us to sustain for around 15 days. But we are stuck here for so long and have run out of money. We cant even return to our country, said Kishore, who worked for an NGO in Nepal.  Unable to travel back to their country because of restrictions in peoples movement, they now live in a tent outside the hospital and depend on food distributed by the Delhi government, police and NGOs.  Kumari feels lucky on the days when khichdi is on the menu as otherwise she has to stay hungry. If I try to eat dal-rice, my jaw hurts because of the effort made to chew, she said.  Not having any idea about if and when his daughters surgery will take place, Kishore longs to return home. When the lockdown will be removed, I will ask someone in Nepal to put some money in my account so that we can go back, he said.",MASUR DAL

In a letter addressed to State Food Secretary Parwez Ahmed Siddiqui, S Jagannathan, Joint Secretary of Union Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution, alleged that distribution of food grains, under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Ann Yojana (PMGKAY), was nil in the state. He said that the state government, under the scheme, had already procured 73,000 metric tonnes of rice.  Denying the allegations, State Food Minister Jyotipriya Mallick said the Central government had provided only 607 metric tonnes of masoor daal (red lentil) against the states demand of 15,000 metric tonnes.  Under PMGKAY, each ration card holder is given five kg food grains and one kg pulses free for the next three months in view the coronavirus pandemic. This is in addition to the monthly quota of subsidised foodgrain of 5 kg per person under the National Food Security Act (NFSA).  Mallick said the state was already delivering food grains to fair price shops and would complete the exercise by May 1.  The prime minister announced this scheme on March 25. But the Central government gave us the confirmation of this scheme on April 16. After that, they started delivering the food grains (rice). We have already started distributing those food grains to ration dealers and we are expecting that, before May 1, we will complete our distribution.

At present, over 81 crore beneficiaries are registered for subsidised foodgrains sold through ration shops under the National Food Security Act (NFSA).  Under the Open Market Sale Scheme (OMSS), the Centre is offering rice at Rs 22 per kg and wheat at Rs 21 per kg at present.  ""I have written to all state chief ministers to lift foodgrains under the OMSS to meet the food requirement of non-NFSA families,"" Paswan said in a statement.  The food ministry has already allowed activists and organisations to provide food relief to lockdown-affected people to buy foodgrains under the OMSS. Even state governments can take foodgrains under the OMSS to meet the food demand of the poor, he said.  A nationwide lockdown has been in place since March 24 to contain the spread of COVID-19 disease.  Stating that the government has enough food supplies in its godowns to meet the demand of the poor, Paswan said the state-run Food Corporation of India (FCI) was having total 605.7 lakh tonne of foodgrains as on May 1, which include 275.7 lakh tonne of rice and 330 lakh tonne of wheat.  The monthly foodgrains requirement for PDS distribution under the NFSA and other welfare schemes is about 60 lakh tonne, he said.  Paswan said that the FCI has transported about 192 lakh tonne of foodgrains since lockdown imposed on March 24. Out of which, 126.12 lakh tonne was transported via road and sea route, the rest 65.4 lakh tonne via rail in 2334 rakes. About 5.63 lakh tonne was transported to the north eastern region in this period.  On free distribution of foodgrains and pulses under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Anna Yojana (PMGAY), Paswan said the requirement of foodgrains under this scheme is about 104.4 lakh tonne of rice and 15.6 lakh tonne of wheat.  Out of which, 56.7 lakh tonne of rice and 7.7 lakh tonne of wheat have been lifted by different states and union territories so far.  Six states such as Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Chandigarh, Delhi and Gujarat have distributed wheat, while other states have distributed rice under the PMGAY, he said. In case of pulses, about 5.82 lakh tonne is required for three months under the PMGAY, out of which 1.90 lakh tonnes have been dispatched so far. Of this, 1.15 lakh tonnes of pulses have reached states and 38,098 tonne have been distributed.  Under the PMGAY, the government is distributing 5 kg foodgrains per PDS beneficiary and one kg per household for three months to ensure no poor goes hungry during the lockdown.

But I wonder what the once incredibly busy neighbourhood looks like now. The shops are mostly shut, and the roads will be empty. But in the little lanes, some of the eateries delivering food should be open, even though the crowds that gather there every morning for breakfast will be missing.  The thought of having breakfast at Chandni Chowk had been haunting me for a while. When I am stopped from doing something, it troubles me no end. I dont recall when I last went to Old Delhi for my morning fare, but I had been dreaming of it ever since the lockdown. As someone wise once said though, if you cant go to the market, let the market come to you. It wasnt exactly the market, but one of my favourite shops  Kanwarjis  that came visiting one morning.  Nagori halwa  Kanwarji is at the mouth of Parathey Waley Galli in Chandni Chowk. The shop, which was set up in 1850, is famous for its dal beeji  a delicious mix of bhujiya, cantaloupe seeds, musk melon seeds and brown masoor dal. The shop split into two quite a while ago. And then, some years ago, it opened a branch in East Delhi (G-1, Sagar Chamber, Saini Enclave, 011-22374913). I found out that the dal beeji (250g for 160) was on the menu of the East Delhi branch, and what gladdened my heart further was the information that it sold bedmi aloo on Sundays  which would be delivered by Swiggy.  So, I was up with the lark on Sunday morning, and before anyone could say COVID-19, I had placed my order for four plates of bedmi aloo (60 for each plate), and two plates of nagori halwa (60 for a plate of five small flat puris). Each plate of bedmi came with two stuffed puris, a good helping of a spicy potato sabzi, and a finger-licking mixed pickle. Nagori halwa, for those who came in late, is a traditional breakfast dish of little discs (like flattened golgappa) served with halwa. You make a hole in the disc, fill it with halwa, and pop it into your mouth.  So I promptly popped one (and then two, and finally three) into my mouth. It marked the end of what was a delicious meal. The bedmis were thick with pithee (the lentil paste that the dough is stuffed with) and I loved the aloo which, while hot, wasnt as hot as I remember it used to be. The pickle complemented the curry, and I finished the meal with some halwa  cooked in desi ghee, but with a light hand, and with just the right amount of sugar in it.  Kanwarji is also famous for its aloo ka lachcha (600 a kilo). I have spent many a happy afternoon in the original Chandni Chowk branch, eating their aloo samosas. In winter, they sell some innovative chikkis (those wonderful jaggery and nutty bars) flavoured with rose petals or even pista bits.  It was a lovely Sunday, after a long, long time. I had bedmi for breakfast, and then bedmi again with my evening tea.  There was no bedmi left for dinner, alas, but I had the spicy aloo sabzi with roti. The night wasnt bathed in a silvery moon, but I somehow felt enveloped by the magic of the Old City.  The writer is a seasoned food critic",MASUR DAL

Only three states and UTs  Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Lakshadweep and Goa have distributed the pulses for all three months while Andhra Pradesh, Chandigarh and Dadra and Nagar Haveli have distributed them for two months. All others have either distributed pulses for one month or are yet to get full one months allocation.  So far the Centre has made allocation of pulses for one month (1.96 lakh tonnes) and states have got 93% of it (1.82 lakh tonnes), but the distribution so far is little over 27%. Till Thursday, only 54,000 tonnes was distributed to the identified beneficiary families.  ""Distribution of pulses is state governments' responsibility. It has not been easy for us to get the raw pulses milled and transported to states/ UTs in these difficult times. States should also put extra efforts to ensure at least whatever pulses have been sent to them are distributed via PDS,"" Union food and consumer affairs minister Ram Vilas Paswan told reporters on Friday.  Its for the first time when pulses have been transported by air to any state and all modes of transport have been used. ""We availed services of Indian Air Force to transport pulses to Arunachal Pradesh,"" said an official.  Citing the complexities of supply chain of pulses, consumer affairs ministry officials said different states have different preferences for pulses and the some cases the source of raw dal and location of mills to process them are outside the consuming states and the distance between these centres is huge.  For example, the source of raw pulses and location of mills are in two other states in the case of over half a dozen consuming states including UP, Bihar , Jharkhand , and North Eastern Region. There are only four states - Maharashtra, Karnataka , Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan - where the source of raw pulses and mills are within the same state.  TOI has learnt that the Nafed, which is the nodal agency for pulses supply, has completed listing the pulses chosen by states, finalized agencies for milling the raw pulses and lifting of raw pulses from gowdown is in the process. The already milled pulses are being transported to districts and then to fare price shops.  According to official data, while over a dozen states including Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Odisha, Tamil Nadu and Telangana have gone for arhar (tur) dal; Punjab , Jammu and Kashmir have sought urad (whole). Similarly, chana dal has been sought by states including Delhi, Haryana, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra.All seven Northeastern states and West Bengal have sought masur dal.",MASUR DAL

(Express file)  Distribution of free pulses under the PM Garib Kalyan Ann Yojana (PMGKAY) has picked pace after initial hiccups with 12 crore households getting the entitled amount till May 22, a top official in the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food Distribution and Public Distribution said on Saturday.  Consumer Affairs Secretary Leena Nandan told The Sunday Express: Against a three-month allocation of 5.87 lakh metric tons (1.95 LMT per month), a total quantity of 4.25 LMT has been dispatched to all States/UTs and about 3.19 LMT has been received by them 1.34 LMT has been distributed to over 12 crore households till May 22.  On March 26, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had announced free pulses  1 kg per family  for the next three months as part of the Covid relief package to all beneficiaries under the National Food Security Act. However, only around 10 per cent families got the entitled amount in the first month of April. That number has now gone up to 61 per cent  12 crore of the total 19.55 crore households.  Officials said some of the states distributed the entire amount in one go.  Citing reasons for the initial delay, Nandan said: The Department, for the first time ever, undertook such a humongous exercise to make available pulses of choice, free of cost for three months, to all the States/UTs for distribution to all the NFSA beneficiaries.  What made the whole exercise complex was that the different pulses had to be procured from different locations, milled before their supply to states as per the states choice, and these included seven types of pulses like tur dal, urad dal, moong whole, moong Dal, masoor dal, chana whole and chana dal, which are produced in different states.

Yet, having spawned an unprecedented crisis on March 24 by giving our population of 1.3 billion less than four hours notice to go into a 21-day natiownide lockdown, the Centre turned to this very sector for help  to put together, the most efficient response mechanism against the pandemic, as Amitabh Kant, CEO of the Government of Indias Niti Aayog initiative, stated in his March 30 letter to civil society organisations. Heres a glimpse of the work being done by some of the many organisations that have truly stepped up to the plate.LIFE Foundation, which has been working in the areas of healthcare and education with over 2,000 anganwadis (childcare centres) and some 160 schools, pivoted to Covid-19 relief almost as soon as the lockdown was announced. Says managing trustee Poonam Lalvani: In the first week of April, we organised rations and staples for adivasis in two villages in Alibaug. As she happened to be in the coastal town at the time, Lalvani reached out to others from Mumbai who were also in their holiday homes there. Those who came forward to donate towards the cause included businessperson Gayatri Ruia, Ambreen Memon (wife of sports writer Ayaz Memon), designer Shirin Neterwala, and architect Huzefa Saifee. Some, like Saifee, who had never engaged in hands-on non-profit work before, drove up to deliver the rations in person. I was stunned to see the bleak living conditions of the labourers who typically take up temporary jobs in the wadis in Alibaug. Their income had been completely cut off, says Saifee.Three weeks into her return to Mumbai, Lalvanis organisation had dipped into its existing corpus to get rations to 2,000 families in Chennai, 5,000 in Coimbatore, 1,000 in Meghalaya, and 1,635 families in Mumbai. We worked with our on-ground partners in these places and ensured that everyone followed the SOPs for due diligence, says Lalvani. In Meghalaya, for example, each family was given 25 kg of rice, three kilos of dal, a litre of oil, and a kilo each of sugar and salt, she says.The foundation has also provided the Mumbai police with masks, hand sanitisers and biscuits, and, as part of a group of some 40 NGOs that have come together under RISE PECONet, it has been getting food and water to migrants making their long trek home. Their work in Alibaug continues; Lalvani is now organising masks and sanitisers for Munawali village there.To help: https://www.lifetrustindia.org/contact-1Bilal Khan, Anil Hebbar andof Ghar Bachao Ghar Banao Andolan have lent their support to the residents of 20 slums in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region, Thane, Dahisar, Kalyan, Navi Mumbai and Kalwa. Besides advocating for the rights of the residents of these communities, which is their movements key purpose, Khan and his team have been helping these communities get around the many challenges posed by the lockdown.Government announcements made it sound like they would take care of the needs of slum-dwellers, but actually they only said they would provide free rations, which is a part of the existing government policy anyway, shares Khan. So while the authorities distributed wheat, rice and dal packages in these communities, his group sourced food items like masalas, salt, vegetables, oil and such, so that people could prepare basic meals. Also, while LPG is free under the Ujjwala Yojana scheme, Khans team found that most of the people in these communities werent registered under the scheme.On March 23, the team filed a PIL about this and then, recognising that the government was unlikely to respond, they started sourcing LPG cylinders themselves. One cylinder costs Rs 750 to Rs 1,100 on the black market. Our resources are limited, but we are doing the best we can to provide for as many families as possible, says Khan. The team has also been providing rations to migrant workers through five community kitchens set up in Malvani,, Wadala and Bhiwandi, and things like slippers, Electral water and dry fruits to those walking back to their villages. Since sanitary napkins were not listed as essential items, we have been distributing these as well.The group has received some support from Essar Foundation, the film fraternity, and from individuals through crowdfunding platform Ketto. Weve raised Rs 30 lakh, says Khan, adding that actor Vir Das has also launched a stand-up act to raise funds for them.To help: tinyurl.com/yaokylopAn initiative, launched by a group of friends in Hyderabad, has organised 55 lakh meals for margianlised communities across the country. Desperate for provisions, a man had reached out to us from Gurgaon, and though we responded urgently, we got there a day too late. By then, he and his family had committed suicide, says Shaaz Mehmood. Until he came up with the idea of this intitiative, Mehmood counted himself among those who just complained that the government had left thousands in the lurch. Then a friend suggested he stop ranting and do something to help, so the entrepreneur, with interests in the F&B, pharma and mining sectors, decided he would do just this. He co-founded Youth Feed India, with friends Deepti Kat from Bangalore and Tanya Reddy from Chennai.The group put together relief kits for small families and distributed them, in partnership with the NGO Safa. Their efforts were supported by tennis star Sania Mirza. The Mumbai team includes Nabeel Shah, Hriyanka Shah, Aamir Shah, Anish Gawande, Maansi Vohra, Latisha Shah, Shraddha Khanna, Mili Sanwalka and Aarya Shah. When the team reached out to friends on social media, youth all over the country started fundraising via online workshops on everything from fitness and baking to arts and crafts. The over Rs 3 crore they collected helped affected communities in Hyderabad, Bangalore, Chennai, Gulbarga in north Karnataka, Mumbai, Gurgaon, Delhi, Faridabad, Pondicherry, parts of UP and Goa, and even people in the remotest parts of the country, like the Chenchu tribe in the Nallamalla forest, which had sent out a distress call. The NGOs we collaborated with helped us to reach sex workers, daily wage earners, the homeless, widows and members of the LGBTQ community, says Mehmood, sharing that 100 per cent of the donations were used to create relief kits.To help: info@youthfeedindia.comRuchi Jain of Taru Naturals, chef Alex Sanchez and Mallyeka Watsa of Americano and chef Ranveer Brar have come together for the Farm to Table Relief Fund. It aims to help small-scale farmers struggling to market their produce, and reaches food to stranded migrant workers and underprivileged families in the city who are battling hunger. The initiative was born out of this idea of fighting for two causes with one action. We were concerned that the harvest would go waste while people all around us were going hungry, says Sanchez, 35.The trio launched a fundraising campaign to buy the produce from farmers in Mulshi, Shindewadi, Uruli Kanchan and Palghar. Five kilos of wheat, two kilos of rice, three kilos of dal, half a litre of oil and half a kilo of vegetables are packed into food kits (worth Rs 650 each) and these are delivered to labourers in Mumbai in areas such as Govandi, Mankhurd, Dharavi and now, Worli. The kits are designed to feed families of four for two weeks. We have already bought around 67 tonnes of produce from 300 farmer families, which have been distributed to 10,400 people with the help of International Association for Human Values (IAHV), says Jain, 33. We are trying to organise this in other parts of the country as well. While Brar is looking at PR and communications for the venture, Sanchez is focusing on scaling up the relief fund and Jain is overseeing the logistics.To help: Donate through Ketto or direct bank transferOperating through its network of 2,000 citizen volunteers, Shishir Joshis 18-month-old Project Mumbai  which he calls a public-private-people partnership  has been reaching out to people who are worst affected by the lockdown, like daily wage earners, senior citizens and people with disabilities. We started working a week before the lockdown, says Joshi. The group has, among other things, launched three mental health helplines, covering 120 million people (including a domestic abuse helpline); provided food to some 2,000 doctors; and donated over two lakh PPE kits to healthcare professionals and the Mumbai police. The group recently launched Mission Suraksha, for which it borrowed 16 vanity vans from film folk, and placed them around the city for use as resting places and mobile toilets by policewomen and men.Project Mumbai will also be working with a hospital in Kalina to provide food to 70 police-doctors. Joshi told Mirror that the group has also organised five free ambulance vans for the police. Every fourth day, we launch something based on the needs of people, says Joshi, CEO and founder of Project Mumbai. Theyve found support from companies like Parle (which donated biscuits) and Unilever, and some 70 mental health counsellors. Writer Siddharth Dhanvant Shanghvi, who has been flagging the groups good work on his network, says: The government has failed us on every level. There are two crises India is dealing with  Covid-19, and a humanitarian one, with thousands left without food and water in very vulnerable conditions. Shanghvi has reached out to his celebrity friends to get the word out about Khaana Chahiye, a citizen initiative co-founded by techie-activists Ruben Mascarenas and Swaraj Shetty, Neeti Goel and Pathik Muni, in partnership with Project Mumbai.. The duo worked with restaurateurs to create a network of kitchens across the city to prepare meals (the group pays Rs 25 per meal), which were distributed by PPEclad volunteers called food ninjas. The team has provided 22.5 lakh meals so far. The BMC got in touch with us to provide food and water to passengers on the Shramik Express trains, which are ferrying workers to their home states from CSMT, Bandra and Kurla stations, says Mascarenas. They also organised buses to ferry migrants to Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Kerala. Says Swaraj Shetty: The city has adopted the campaign.

""We had given up trying to attempt these many years ago because of the pollution. But now, because of clear skies and bright sunlight, we have been able to make these at home,"" he says.Like the vadam of the south, in northern and western India, this is the time to make sundried fermented lentil dumplings such as the spiced urad dal baris and plainer moong dal mangori. Till the 1990s, households even in urban areas of UP, Punjab and Rajasthan would set these out to dry in the sun on terraces, along with martabans of kaanji, a water based pickling of carrots, or mango, lime or jackfruit pickles in oil, all set to ferment and ripen. Many of these old techniques are back in fashion as evident from social media posts.Then, there are simpler everyday tasks like making rotis or phulkas, a staple that a majority of middle class Indians no longer make themselves, relying on domestic help and cooks. In the lockdown, there is not just a forced revival of these basics but at least a few of the millennials and Gen Y are learning these for the first time. Ankita Chavan, a young chef who works at The Bombay Canteen and has trained at Noma, is back home in Vadodara, and tells me that she is learning to make soft, round chapattis from her mother.In fact, bread-making extends to not just sourdoughs and slider buns, but to Indian breads such as paos and kulchas too. Bhatura , the fermented popular puffed up delight, seems to be much missed as a Sunday treat, and Delhi food groups are full of pictures of people cooking these at home.Nisha Madhulika, one of Indias most popular YouTube stars with an estimated 1.33 billion views (and an income far exceeding that of most top chefs), has a fan base that is growing even more. Her videos on how to make softer bhaturas, ring samosas, and how to bake in a pressure cooker, are a hit with a newer, younger audience too. Her tips to bake cakes in a pressure cooker are fantastic. I havent seen these anywhere else, says Prerna Jaiswal, who works for the Serendipity Arts Festival in Delhi, and has been baking furiously in her hometown of Palia Kalan, near the Dudwa National Park.Judging from food pictures being posted on Instagram, in food groups and on other social media, it may be a mistake to think that metropolitan Indians and those who had formed the bulk of the restaurant-going audience are making do with simple, subsistence-level fare at home. Quite a few, instead, are using the lockdown as an opportunity to delve deeper into regional cuisines. ""I am spending more effort on understanding soft fragrant spices such as dagadh ka phool and exploring a little more of Karnataka and Telangana cuisines,"" says a top fashion editor who does not wish to be named.Forgotten and painstaking recipes such as torai ke chilke ki subzi, made with finely slicing peels, and potli ki subzi, where lentils are steamed in a muslin cloth, cut into nuggets and put in gravy also seem to be making a comeback, as people gravitate to tastes of their childhood. Blogs such as Hebbars Kitchen (for south Indian recipes) and Shampas Kitchen (for Bengali) seem to be hot favourites, even as professional restaurant chefs struggle to build online followings.It is not just in the Indian metros that people are taking to learning traditional techniques of cooking complex regional dishes. Even in London, with a big Indian community, chef Rohit Ghais recipes that he posts online every day seem to be a hit. From DIY rasmalai to venison shami kebab and slow cooked rogan josh, many Indians are lapping it up and learning. ""I would rush over Indian food earlier but now am taking time to do things properly. It helps that chefs like Rohit Ghai are sharing some of their signature dishes' recipes. And Dhishoom shared its entire cook book. I followed their mattar paneer recipe to the T. It took me 90 minutes but was so worth it,"" says Shivani Sodhi Maitra, partner Deloitte London.In these difficult times, complex cooking processes are perhaps a stress-buster; the silver lining is that techniques that we had forgotten or outsourced may be revived.",MASUR DAL

According to the paper, the numbers belie government claims about the operations of agricultural markets during the lockdown.  Arrivals of major agricultural commodities in markets across the country during the lockdown period were as low as 50 to 75 per cent of arrivals during the corresponding period last year, indicating the difficulties faced by agriculturists on account of severe disruption of supply chains.  A paper to be published in the upcoming issue of Review of Agrarian Studies  a peer-reviewed journal of the Foundation for Agrarian Studies  shows that the arrivals were not even 50 per cent of the total arrivals for wheat, barley, gram, potato, onion, peas and mango in 2019. While they were between 50 and 75 per cent of the arrivals last year in the case of pigeon pea, lentil, cabbage, cauliflower, ladys finger and banana. The paper is authored by R Ramakumar, NABARD chair professor, School of Development Studies, Tata Institute of Social Sciences, Mumbai.  Using data from the commodities database of the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE), a compilation of data from 3,289 markets across the country, the paper analyses market arrivals of 16 commodities between March 15 and May 15, and compares these with market arrivals during the same two-month period in 2019. The 16 commodities represent all crop groups including cereals, pulses, fruits and vegetables.  CMIE, a leading business information company, produces economic and business databases and develops specialised analytical tools to deliver these to its customers for decision making and for research.  With the exception of maize, market arrivals for all commodities were lower in 2020 than in 2019. And only two commodities, paddy and maize, saw at least 75 per cent of market arrivals as compared to 2019. In the case of wheat, an important rabi crop, market arrivals were only 47 per cent as compared to 2019.  In the case of barley and gram, arrivals were 32.6 per cent and 43.5 per cent of the corresponding period in the previous year. Arrivals of pigeon pea (arhar) were 63.6 per cent while arrivals of lentil (masoor) were 56.7 per cent in comparison with 2019.  Arrivals of perishable commodities were significantly lower, too. As compared to 2019, tomato saw 74.5 per cent arrivals, potato saw 49 per cent, while onion and peas were 32.5 per cent and 39.1 per cent, respectively. In addition, wheat, barley, gram, lentil, peas and mango also witnessed a long stretch of days in March when arrivals were negligible.  According to the paper, the numbers belie government claims about the operations of agricultural markets during the lockdown. The sizeably lower arrivals point to difficulties faced by farmers due to breakdowns in government procurement systems, lower private trade in rural areas, difficulties in transporting goods to market yards, mandi-specific requirements such as an appointment slip, etc. Farmers who ran into these hurdles at markets were forced to take their produce back or sell to middlemen at lower prices.  While farmers did indeed sell produce outside this network of agricultural markets during the lockdown period, the probability that such sales were at prices lower than market rates is high, prof R Ramakumar told The Indian Express. Some of these sales outside the markets may have been distress sales, some perishables would have suffered spoilage or would have been dumped. A few states, such as Punjab, opened more numbers of procurement centers, ad hoc institutions to increase procurements, which would not reflect in this data of market arrivals. But these are unlikely to alter the numbers significantly, he said.  In the case of some commodities, price realisations also fell alongside the dip in market arrivals, indicating more distress for the producers of these items, such as poultry and milk, vegetables and some fruits. These areas would have suffered significant losses, though the extent of distress these farmers have faced cannot be gauged by the supply or demand shocks alone, more primary studies will be required to assess the level of distress, he said.  These disruptions offer a lesson on how supply chains must be structured and secured, Ramakumar added. I am not sure if the recent steps taken by the government, including the amendments to states APMC Acts, are actually going to resolve the problem. We must look at ways in which the APMC system can be reformed and strengthened, we must identify problems such as the predominance of commission agents in some markets. The extent of disruption caused by the closing down of some APMC markets such as Mumbai and Pune show that they have a significant role to play, so reform is actually required within the APMC regime, he said.",MASUR DAL

In the run-up to 2018 assembly elections, the Congress party had promised to waive loan of farmers up to Rs 2 lakh per head. The then Congress president Rahul Gandhi had backed that commitment by claiming that if Congress failed in keeping its promise within the first 10 days of coming to power, the chief minister would lose his post.  After coming to power, the Congress launched Jai kisan fasal rin maafi yojna to implement loan-waiver promise for about 5 million farmers to the tune of approximately Rs 55,000 crore. It added a rider that the loan waiver scheme will be implemented in phases with farmers having loans up to Rs 50,000 per head to be covered in the first phase and no waiver of loans for income tax payee farmers.  The then government claimed to have waived off loans of 2 million farmers, worth approximately Rs 7,000 crore, in the first phase until March, 2019. The then chief minister Kamal Nath announced that about 1.2 million farmers would benefit from loan waiver of Rs 11,675 crore in the second phase that began as late as in December 2019.  In an interview, Kamal Patel likened the Congress promises to that of a leader from his district, Harda, who used to contest assembly elections as an independent candidate with lofty promises to bring back Indias looted gold and silver from England, making temples of gold and peoples houses with silver and of making air travel so convenient that people could land helicopters in their fields to curb road accidents.  For Coronavirus Live Updates  Congress knew it was not going to win the elections. It had won 58 seats in 2013 assembly elections and feared that due to Prime Minister Narendra Modis welfare initiative, it might not win even 20 seats; hence they decided to tell lies only. The Congress Vachan patra (election manifesto) was full of promises to such an extent that even God would not have been able to fulfill it had he got down to Earth, said the minister.  Kamal Patel said, The Congress tried to lure every section of the society. Farmers were promised Rs 2 lakh per head loan waiver that meant the waiver amount will multiply several times depending upon loan takers in a family. They promised Rs 4,000 per month to unemployed youths, Rs 1,000 pension to the physically challenged, regularisation of services to daily wagers and guest faculty in degree colleges and many other promises. Was this not fraud and deceit? Thats why I asked farmers to go and lodge FIR against the Congress leaders for committing fraud on them with a criminal conspiracy.  The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19  The minister said the BJP government was working on making farmers self-reliant so that they wouldnt need loans.  In just two months, the BJP government headed by chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan had taken several decisions to increase income of farmers and make them self-reliant. The bar on the maximum amount of weighing of the agriculture produce at mandis had been done away with. This would save farmers diesel and time worth crores of rupees. Similarly, raising the limit of procurement for gram, lentil and mustard from 15 quintal to 20 quintal per hectare has resulted in additional income of Rs 762 crore to the farmers.  Hitting back, the then agriculture minister Sachin Yadav said Congress loan waiver scheme was a response to farmers suicide during BJPs 15-year rule in the state. He claimed the Congress government was going to launch the third phase of loan waivers from June 1 before it got toppled.  I challenge chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan and agriculture minister Kamal Patel to tour the state with me to know the reality. The fact is, during the BJPs regime of 15 years, Madhya Pradesh had earned a bad name as a state with highest number of farmers suicide cases due to wrong policies of the BJP. We waived loans worth Rs 11,500 crore of 2.66 million farmers in the first and the second phase and we were going to launch the third phase from June 1.  He added, People are highly upset with the BJP government and will give a befitting reply to it in the ensuing bypolls in the state.  The state Congress spokesperson Abhay Dubey echoed the sentiment.  We had handed over a list of 21 lakh farmers to Shivraj Singh Chouhan ji at his bungalow when he was in the Opposition. There was no statement from him on this. But no one can help if BJP has decided to only tell lies. Congress will be back in power after the bypolls for 24 assembly seats and will not only waive the remaining farmers loans but also transfer some monthly amount in the bank accounts of migrant labourers, he claimed.",MASUR DAL

But my brothers house across the road was still standing, said Moktar Ali, a fish vendor at Minakhan market in South 24 Parganas.

He said a man named Vineet called him to say that the islands in Patharpratima in South 24 Parganas had disappeared. No news channel could reach there, so no news is coming from there, Vineet told Islam over the phone. We dont know if Sagar Island exists any more.

There is no historical record of a cyclone with a wind speed as high as 185 km/hour making landfall on the coast of Bengal in recent times. It was not only the intensity of the storm that made the event significant but also its duration. The wall cloud stayed for almost five to six hours. The only comparison that the people of coastal Bengal and the authorities could make was with Cyclone Aila which struck in 2009, but with a speed of 120 km/hour. In anticipation of Amphan, 5 lakh people were evacuated to cyclone shelters. Of them, 3 lakh alone were from South 24 Parganas district.  But while destruction caused by the storm has been vast, the number of deaths in West Bengal has been relatively low. Banerjee said 98 people died in the cyclone, of which 19 lost their lives in Kolkata. And in some ecologically fragile places, casualties have been very low. Amphan ripped through Ghoramara, the smallest and most vulnerable island in the Sundarbans, with a population of 5,000 inhabitants, only claiming two goats. They died when a wall collapsed on them.  A few hours after the cyclone, Banerjee sat at the State Secretariat and summed up the scale and nature of the tempest via video conference. South and North 24 Parganas are finished and 99% of south Bengal are destroyed, she said, looking at updates on her mobile phone. We need to rebuild Bengal from scratch.  Acres and acres of agricultural land in the State were flooded. Tarak Ghosh, a small farmer, pulled out wet paddy from a field which, until a week ago, was glowing under the sun. It was just the beginning of the harvest of the Rabi crop. It is all gone now, he said. West Bengal, the leading State in paddy production, had suffered a great blow. By one estimate, about 1.5 million sharecroppers of south Bengal had lost their produce. Vegetables and cash crops like sesame, jute and fruits had simply disappeared. Farmers are coming to withdraw deposits, not to buy pesticides and fertilizers. This is a bad sign at the peak of the harvesting season, said Liaqat Ali Jangi, a middle-level farmer and manager of a farmers cooperative, Dhubulia Krishi Unnayan Samiti, which has about 1,000 members, in Nadia district.

Most people remained indoors and held on to the doors and windows of their homes to prevent water from entering inside. All they could hear was the wind and the torrential rain. There was little or no visibility. By evening, as the cyclone became more and more fierce, large parts of the city plunged into darkness. Two iconic structures in the city, Howrah Bridge and Victoria Memorial, were invisible.  After a long night of battling with the cyclone, millions in south Bengal, including Kolkata, woke up to destruction that was of a scale they had never imagined. The city was completely battered. Trees and poles lay uprooted in every lane in every neighbourhood.  Over the next few days, Kolkata had not only the monumental task of restoring essential infrastructure services, but also power and electric supply, disrupted by the storm and the fallen trees. There was an outpouring of anger on the streets. Protests broke out in several neighbourhoods, and the Army was called in.  Also read | Storm of rage in battered Kolkata  Six days after Amphan, at the Regional Meteorological Centre in Kolkata, Sanjib Bandyopadhyay, the Deputy Director General of Meteorology, was still trying to pull all stops to get the Internet at his office fixed. We should be your top priority, he told the staff member at the Internet service provider over phone. The Chief Minister is visiting districts and we cannot provide updates. The staff member retorted, Like you there are several top priorities for us. In fact, you are priority number 132.  Bandyopadhyay was the man of the hour. He had been issuing all the necessary alerts about the cyclone for several days before it made landfall. On May 20, at about 4 p.m., he told the press that the landfall process of the cyclone had commenced near Sagar Island at 2.30 p.m. and that the cyclone was moving towards the north and north-east.  Bandyopadhyay explained that it was the first time that the India Meteorological Department (IMD) had issued an advisory for people to stay inside their homes. This was not the COVID-19 advisory, he clarified. The administration also ensured that the people remained indoors. Weather officials said they gave regular advisories in their bulletin that the damage will be caused by three factors: gale winds, rainfall, and storm surge. The IMDs focus, they said, was on getting the prediction of intensity and track of the cyclone right. The officials said they got it right, just like they did with earlier cyclones such as Bulbul, Fani and Hudhud.  Close to Kolkata, destruction was visible in Howrah district. The 230-year-old Acharya Jagadish Chandra Bose Indian Botanic Garden, set up by the British to pioneer botanical research in India, had turned into a graveyard of trees. At least a thousand trees, including some notable and rare species, were destroyed, said Kanad Das, scientist, Botanical Survey of India, and in-charge of the Botanic Garden. A Dutch cemetery, around the same age as the garden, was destroyed in Hooghly-Chinsurah. The impact of the storm was felt as far as in the Bardhaman and Birbhum districts of south Bengal.

She swam for several hours in the deep waters surrounding the broken embankments with a fishing net, trying to catch fish spawns. Basanti and her husband Basudev used to have a pond with fish, and grew rice and vegetables. The sale of fish, rice and vegetables was enough to support them. But after the cyclone, the only way to survive was to catch prawn seeds in the water. For a thousand seeds, we get 200, Basanti said.  While gale winds ravaged Deulbari, there was more suffering to follow when the embankments broke and seawater flowed into the villages. The embankments of several villages in Hasnabad, Hingalganj and Minakhan in North 24 Parganas, and Patharpratima, Namkhana, Bansanti, and Gosaba in South 24 Parganas suffered extensive damage. These villages are now getting flooded everyday in the high tide.

On the road to the Achintyapur gram panchayat in Patharpratima block of South 24 Parganas, amidst broken houses and trees lie a pile of boxes and hundreds of bicycles and motorcycles. The boxes, some of them made of aluminium, contain television sets and refrigerators. This luggage belongs to the migrant workers, mostly from Haryana and Delhi, who have returned home for good. The migrants said it was becoming impossible for them to stay in Haryana and Delhi, so they packed their bags and came home  only to face the storm.  Dulal Sith, the panchayat pradhan, said about 3,000 migrants, or about 10% of the gram panchayat, have returned to the village. Along with other officials, he admitted that the cyclone evacuees and those who had been in quarantine had to be kept under one roof as there was no other option on May 20. In many coastal areas and remote islands, cyclone shelters were being used as quarantine shelters. When people had to be evacuated before the cyclone, the authorities brought both categories of people under one roof.  Also read | South Bengal ruinously impacted by COVID-19 and Amphan  In the adjoining gram panchayat of Lakhijanardanpur, the fate of the farmers has swung between two cyclones, Amphan and Bulbul. This area of the Sundarbans yields a good crop of yellow lentils (moong dal). Sowing was delayed when Cyclone Bulbul struck West Bengal on November 9, 2019. Before the harvest could be reaped, Amphan landed washing away thousands of acres of plantation. Roopkumar Sardar, a migrant labourer, had taken about two bighas of land on lease paying 45,000 for two seasons. A few days after the cyclone, he and his wife Sutapa and mother Phoolmani worked in the fields of Purbadarogapur village. The lentil pods I have been collecting from the submerged fields can only be fed to the cattle. I will have to go out of the village to work, maybe to Kolkata, maybe somewhere else outside, to repay the 45,000, Sardar said. In several parts of south Bengal, migrant workers who returned before the lockdown took land on lease, hoping to cultivate crops for a couple of seasons before the situation improved. Their hopes have been destroyed by the cyclone.  If yellow lentils have been destroyed at Lakhijanaradanpur gram panchayat, at Mousuni Island, Amphan has destroyed the alternative livelihood of tourism. Over the past few years, locals on the island have been investing in seaside homes which they called resorts. Of the 42 homes that came up, not even one stands now. Rebuilding them is going to take a long time. Keshav Maity, a villager of G Plot, said the roofs of houses, made of asbestos and tiles, flew like cardboard pieces when Amphan struck.  Mousuni and G Plot, the areas closer to the sea, also witnessed a unique phenomenon. Trees that did not get uprooted have dried. The leaves have turned yellow. The villagers said this could be because of the saline fog that formed when the cyclone made landfall.  A comprehensive mitigation plan  In almost every village of coastal Bengal, particularly in the Sundarbans, villagers kept making references to Cyclone Aila. The wind speed was stronger this time but during Aila, there were more embankment breaches, they said.

The need of the hour should be to formulate a comprehensive policy for mitigation through risk minimisation, resilience-building and preparedness to respond to such events, Professor Ghosh said. West Bengal should follow the example of Odisha, he said, where, after the super cyclone of 1999, the State has been on a learning curve.  Experts believe that historical weather events like Cyclones Aila and Amphan give us an opportunity to evaluate the States preparedness as well as the fragility of our urban infrastructure.

She is on television talking about big issues but we are dying due to issues like joblessness and crop failure, said Rahim Baksh Mollah of Charmahatpur. The district leaders of Trinamool did not deny that their MLAs and MPs were busy on social media during the lockdown. They have left the politics to Didi, said a Nadia district leader of the Trinamool, on condition of anonymity.

Most people remained indoors and held on to the doors and windows of their homes to prevent water from entering inside. All they could hear was the wind and the torrential rain. There was little or no visibility. By evening, as the cyclone became more and more fierce, large parts of the city plunged into darkness. Two iconic structures in the city, Howrah Bridge and Victoria Memorial, were invisible.  After a long night of battling with the cyclone, millions in south Bengal, including Kolkata, woke up to destruction that was of a scale they had never imagined. The city was completely battered. Trees and poles lay uprooted in every lane in every neighbourhood.  Over the next few days, Kolkata had not only the monumental task of restoring essential infrastructure services, but also power and electric supply, disrupted by the storm and the fallen trees. There was an outpouring of anger on the streets. Protests broke out in several neighbourhoods, and the Army was called in.

We should be your top priority, he told the staff member at the Internet service provider over phone. The Chief Minister is visiting districts and we cannot provide updates. The staff member retorted, Like you there are several top priorities for us. In fact, you are priority number 132.  Bandyopadhyay was the man of the hour. He had been issuing all the necessary alerts about the cyclone for several days before it made landfall. On May 20, at about 4 p.m., he told the press that the landfall process of the cyclone had commenced near Sagar Island at 2.30 p.m. and that the cyclone was moving towards the north and north-east.  Bandyopadhyay explained that it was the first time that the India Meteorological Department (IMD) had issued an advisory for people to stay inside their homes. This was not the COVID-19 advisory, he clarified. The administration also ensured that the people remained indoors. Weather officials said they gave regular advisories in their bulletin that the damage will be caused by three factors: gale winds, rainfall, and storm surge. The IMDs focus, they said, was on getting the prediction of intensity and track of the cyclone right. The officials said they got it right, just like they did with earlier cyclones such as Bulbul, Fani and Hudhud.  Close to Kolkata, destruction was visible in Howrah district. The 230-year-old Acharya Jagadish Chandra Bose Indian Botanic Garden, set up by the British to pioneer botanical research in India, had turned into a graveyard of trees. At least a thousand trees, including some notable and rare species, were destroyed, said Kanad Das, scientist, Botanical Survey of India, and in-charge of the Botanic Garden. A Dutch cemetery, around the same age as the garden, was destroyed in Hooghly-Chinsurah. The impact of the storm was felt as far as in the Bardhaman and Birbhum districts of south Bengal.

Hundreds of fish had died and innumerable houses had turned into heaps of rubble. I have nothing left except the gamcha I am wearing, said Jiarul Laskar, whose house had turned into dust.  Inundated moong dal elds in in Purbodarogapur village of West Bengals South 24 Parganas district. | Photo Credit: Rajeev Bhatt  In the afternoon, just after the high tide, Basanti Naskar risked the waters of the Matla. She swam for several hours in the deep waters surrounding the broken embankments with a fishing net, trying to catch fish spawns. Basanti and her husband Basudev used to have a pond with fish, and grew rice and vegetables. The sale of fish, rice and vegetables was enough to support them. But after the cyclone, the only way to survive was to catch prawn seeds in the water. For a thousand seeds, we get 200, Basanti said.  While gale winds ravaged Deulbari, there was more suffering to follow when the embankments broke and seawater flowed into the villages. The embankments of several villages in Hasnabad, Hingalganj and Minakhan in North 24 Parganas, and Patharpratima, Namkhana, Bansanti, and Gosaba in South 24 Parganas suffered extensive damage. These villages are now getting flooded everyday in the high tide.

On the road to the Achintyapur gram panchayat in Patharpratima block of South 24 Parganas, amidst broken houses and trees lie a pile of boxes and hundreds of bicycles and motorcycles. The boxes, some of them made of aluminium, contain television sets and refrigerators. This luggage belongs to the migrant workers, mostly from Haryana and Delhi, who have returned home for good. The migrants said it was becoming impossible for them to stay in Haryana and Delhi, so they packed their bags and came home  only to face the storm.  Dulal Sith, the panchayat pradhan, said about 3,000 migrants, or about 10% of the gram panchayat, have returned to the village. Along with other officials, he admitted that the cyclone evacuees and those who had been in quarantine had to be kept under one roof as there was no other option on May 20. In many coastal areas and remote islands, cyclone shelters were being used as quarantine shelters. When people had to be evacuated before the cyclone, the authorities brought both categories of people under one roof.  Also read | South Bengal ruinously impacted by COVID-19 and Amphan  In the adjoining gram panchayat of Lakhijanardanpur, the fate of the farmers has swung between two cyclones, Amphan and Bulbul. This area of the Sundarbans yields a good crop of yellow lentils (moong dal). Sowing was delayed when Cyclone Bulbul struck West Bengal on November 9, 2019. Before the harvest could be reaped, Amphan landed washing away thousands of acres of plantation. Roopkumar Sardar, a migrant labourer, had taken about two bighas of land on lease paying 45,000 for two seasons. A few days after the cyclone, he and his wife Sutapa and mother Phoolmani worked in the fields of Purbadarogapur village. The lentil pods I have been collecting from the submerged fields can only be fed to the cattle. I will have to go out of the village to work, maybe to Kolkata, maybe somewhere else outside, to repay the 45,000, Sardar said. In several parts of south Bengal, migrant workers who returned before the lockdown took land on lease, hoping to cultivate crops for a couple of seasons before the situation improved. Their hopes have been destroyed by the cyclone.  If yellow lentils have been destroyed at Lakhijanaradanpur gram panchayat, at Mousuni Island, Amphan has destroyed the alternative livelihood of tourism. Over the past few years, locals on the island have been investing in seaside homes which they called resorts. Of the 42 homes that came up, not even one stands now. Rebuilding them is going to take a long time. Keshav Maity, a villager of G Plot, said the roofs of houses, made of asbestos and tiles, flew like cardboard pieces when Amphan struck.  Mousuni and G Plot, the areas closer to the sea, also witnessed a unique phenomenon. Trees that did not get uprooted have dried. The leaves have turned yellow. The villagers said this could be because of the saline fog that formed when the cyclone made landfall.  A comprehensive mitigation plan  In almost every village of coastal Bengal, particularly in the Sundarbans, villagers kept making references to Cyclone Aila. The wind speed was stronger this time but during Aila, there were more embankment breaches, they said.

The need of the hour should be to formulate a comprehensive policy for mitigation through risk minimisation, resilience-building and preparedness to respond to such events, Professor Ghosh said. West Bengal should follow the example of Odisha, he said, where, after the super cyclone of 1999, the State has been on a learning curve.  Experts believe that historical weather events like Cyclones Aila and Amphan give us an opportunity to evaluate the States preparedness as well as the fragility of our urban infrastructure.

(Representational Image) Soil moisture apart, fertiliser purchases are also seen to be driven by liquidity with farmers on account of government grain procurement. (Representational Image)  Retail sales of fertiliser have surged almost 98 per cent year-on-year in May, marking the seventh consecutive month of double-digit growth, and also pointing to agriculture doing relatively well in an otherwise dismal economic landscape.  Data from the Department of Fertilisers shows all-India nutrient sales at 40.02 lakh tonnes (lt) in May 2020. Not only was this nearly twice the 20.24 lt sales for May 2019, but also more than the 22.61 lt in the same month of 2018.  Read| Agriculture an exception, fertiliser sales jump 45% in April despite lockdown  Further, every month since November has posted double-digit increases of sales over the previous year (see table), which is also consistent with the latest quarterly estimates of GDP for 2019-20 released on Friday.  According to the National Statistical Office, the farm sector grew 3.6% year-on-year in October-December 2019, and 5.9% in January-March 2020, compared to 3.5% and 3% for the overall economy in the same respective quarters. The gap between the two was even more in nominal terms after factoring in inflation: 13.9% in October-December 2019 and 13% in January-March 2020 for the former, and 7% and 6.8% in the corresponding quarters for the latter.  Farmers are buying and we can clearly see demand for fertilisers. Normally, about 70% of our sale to dealers (wholesalers) happens on credit. The credit period extends to 75-90 days for April sales, which falls to 45-60 days in May, 15-30 days in June, and 7-10 days in July as the Kharif cropping season progresses. But this time, only 30% sales have been on credit, with dealers taking material by paying 70% cash upfront. It indicates good offtake down the line from retailers (each dealer supplies to 30-40 of them) and farmers, the chief financial officer of a leading private sector fertiliser company said.  Fertiliser demand has been strong right from the rabi (winter-spring) season due to last years extended monsoon that helped recharge groundwater aquifers and fill reservoirs to full capacity. Farmers, hence, planted more area. They seem keen to utilise the vastly improved soil moisture, including from this years winter and pre-monsoon rain, for the coming kharif season as well, an executive from a fertiliser cooperative said.  The annual sales growth during April-May was 63.6% for urea (31.17 lt versus 19.05 lt in April-May 2019), 104.8% for di-ammonium phosphate (9.75 lt versus 4.76 lt), 123.7% for nitrogen-phosphorous-potash-sulphur complex fertilisers (11.43 lt versus 5.11 lt), 62.2% for muriate of potash (3.39 lt versus 2.09 lt), 42.5% for single super phosphate (4.59 lt versus 3.22 lt) and 36.8% for compost (0.26 lt versus 0.19 lt).  The spurt in April sales may have been partly panic-buying. Dealers wanted to stock up, as they feared production and supply disruptions due to the lockdown. Also, there were worries that the weakening of the rupee would lead to prices of imported fertilisers and inputs going up. But the fact that sales have been even better in May, and across all fertilisers, reflects genuine underlying demand. Whether it would sustain in the peak season (June-August) depends on how the monsoon pans out, another industry source said.  The southwest monsoon arrived on time in Kerala on Monday. The India Meteorological Department forecast rainfall for the country during the four-month (June-September) season to be 102% of the long period average, corresponding to a normal monsoon.  Soil moisture apart, fertiliser purchases are also seen to be driven by liquidity with farmers on account of government grain procurement. The Food Corporation of India and state agencies had, as on May 29, bought 354.08 lt of the 2019-20 wheat crop that was harvested after mid-April. Its value, at the minimum support price (MSP) of Rs 1,925 per quintal, would be close to Rs 68,200 crore. In addition, 9.55 lt of chana (chickpea), 6.82 lt of arhar/tur (pigeon-pea), and 6.48 lt of rapeseed-mustard, with a combined MSP value of roughly Rs 11,500 crore, have been procured until now.  If you include the Rs 2,000 first-installment direct cash transfer to about 8.89 crore farmers under the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi scheme post the March 24 lockdown, the total money pumped in comes to around Rs 97,500 crore. That liquidity is now getting re-invested in fertilisers and other farm inputs, the earlier quoted source said.  My entire 600 quintals of wheat from 36 acres was procured on May 20 and May 22. I havent sold my 70 quintals of masoor (red lentil) from 10 acres. Its current market price, at Rs 5,000 per quintal, is above the MSP of Rs 4,800. I intend sowing urad (black gram) in this kharif because it is trading at Rs 7,000/quintal, as against the MSP of Rs 6,000.

(Archive photo) Dehlvi was the editor of Science ki Duniya, an Urdu science magazine. (Archive photo)  Veteran Urdu poet Anand Mohan Zutshi Gulzar Dehlvi (93) spent May 28 afternoon writing a sher for his beloved granddaughter, and he spent the evening recording it in his voice, so that he could send it to her in the US via WhatsApp.  It was her wedding and this was the best way Dehlvi knew to bless his granddaughter. After sending the recording, he fell sick later at night.  The sickness would take the Noida resident to Kailash hospital, where he tested positive for Covid-19 two days later. After a few days in the Covid-19 ICU at Greater Noidas Sharda hospital, where he was later shifted to, the nonagenarian returned home after recovering from the virus Sunday. Gautam Budh Nagars District Magistrate Suhas L Y tweeted, he is an inspiration to many like me. Sir, you motivate us to work even harder.  On Monday, Dehlvis wife Kavita (84) told The Indian Express, On May 28 night, he had 103 degrees and was shivering. I gave him medicine, and he was better. The next day, however, he couldnt get out of bed, and my son rushed him to Kailash hospital. On May 31, he tested positive for Covid-19, and was shifted to Sharda hospital. Hes back home now, and under self-isolation for another seven days. He is weak, and unable to speak a lot right now. He is very happy, I can tell you that.   Dehlvi, a Kashmiri Pandit, was the editor of Science ki Duniya, the only science magazine published in Urdu by the government, which was launched in 1975. He is also credited with setting up Urdu schools across India. He was born to poet parents in Old Delhis Gali Kashmeerian, and Sitaram Market, in the area, is named after his ancestor. Dehlvi was also associated with the freedom movement since the 30s, when he was in school, and as he grew up to become a poet, he often attended rallies by Congress.  A Delhi government source said that till last year, Dehlvi would show up at mushairas in the city, and would get a rousing applause when he got on stage.  Dehlvi saab was admitted for at least 10 days and I was worried as I couldnt even go to the hospital. The doctors at Sharda hospital, however, ensured I saw his face every night before sleeping. I would video call his doctor who would hold the phone, and let me talk to Dehlvi saab for a few minutes. He would introduce me and our son Anuj to the doctor, tell us he is fine, and ask us to see him. I cant understand how he got it, we never stepped out of the house, and no outsiders have come in either. Even our grocery comes in a basket we have suspended from the balcony, said Kavita.  Dr Abhishek Deshwal, the ICU in-charge at Sharda Hospital, said that Dehlvis recovery has boosted the morale of the hospital staff. Before leaving, he blessed us all and invited us over for lunch one day when he recovers.  As of now, the poet is on strict bed rest, and on a doctor-prescribed diet of milk, juice, lentil soup, and khichdi.

The future was seemingly uncertain not only for those whose Rabi crop was standing ready in the fields for harvesting but also lakhs of cane-growers in western UP, prepared to plant the saplings. There farmers didn't venture out to their fields due to lockdown and additionally there was dearth of agricultural labourers.  However, the timely intervention by Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath brought a big respite to the community. Consequently, harvesting commenced in Uttar Pradesh on April 5 and is going on in full swing.  To bring respite to farmers, the CM contacted the authorities concerned at the Centre seeking permission for allowing farmers and agri-labourers to work in fields amid the lockdown.  Exemptions in use of combine harvester and other such equipments to harvest Rabi crops, farm workers and opening of fertilizers and seed shops during lockdown were the steps we took to help the farmers community, said state agriculture minister Surya Pratap Shahi.  The directives to keep seeds, fertilizer and pesticide shops open even during the lockdown helped those who were ready to start sowing of Zaid, said the minister.  Having over 2.50 crore farmers and over three crore farm labourers, Uttar Pradesh, predominantly an agriculture state, is the highest producer of foodgrains, milk and vegetables in the country.  The state government has ensured that no restriction is imposed on inter-district and intra-district movement of vehicles carrying harvesting machines, said the minister.  We, at the agriculture department, kept on sensitizing the scary farmers about working in fields by maintaining social distancing and also with covered faces to ward off the deadly virus. Gradually, they, too, realised it and are now busy in harvesting work, he added.  Moreover, the farmers are allowed to go to fields and respective district administrations have made it clear that no passes would be required by farmers and agriculture labourers.  The purchase of mustard, gram and lentils (masoor) has started from April 2. This will bring great relief to the farmers of Bundelkhand and Agra division.  The government has announced that it will buy 2.64 lakh metric tonnes of mustard, 2.01 lakh metric tonnes of gram and 1.21 lakh metric tonnes of lentil (masoor) from farmers at Minimum Support Price (MSP), respectively. These purchases will last for 90 days.  The state government has fixed the wheat procurement target of 5.5 million tonnes for 2020-21 and the MSP for wheat has been announced at Rs 1925 per quintal. This year the MSP has been hiked by Rs 85 per quintal. Last year it was Rs 1840 per quintal.",MASUR DAL

It is the simplest form of self-care, writes this columnist  As India begins the third week of quarantine, our dishwasher stops working. After doing the dishes for breakfast, I sit here writing this column, with a mask of honey, milk and saffron on my face. Admittedly, there are more important things to worry about than the quality of our skin. However, as we have been given a pause, and an opportunity for self-care, it might not be so terrible to pamper ourselves even in the smallest way possible.  Aerin Lauder once spoke about the instant gratification of lipstick. Id say this goes for any beauty ritual. Even when we had tightly-packed schedules, just the act of removing make-up at the end of the day made us focus, albeit for the briefest of moments, on ourselves. Personally, I feel self care and self-respect go hand in hand. The moment you choose to pull out those extra 10 minutes only for yourself, youre giving your subconscious the message that yes, I value myself.  These days, we have more than a moment or two. Whether youre working from home or are a full-time mum, you can work and yell at your kids with a mask and hair oil. Those who would earlier very rightly complain about not having enough time can now dry-body brush, oil their hair, apply castor oil on lashes and brows, because at the very least, we have an extra couple of hours that were spent battling traffic. And even though you cant order from your favourite beauty e-tailer yet, youll find that there are many things that can be done at home to look and feel great.  Obviously the honey-saffron-milk mask is amazing and can be used everyday. All you need is a teaspoon each of raw milk and honey and a few threads of saffron. You can replace the saffron with a pinch of turmeric. If youre vegan, then try fresh aloe vera gel, some red shakkar and a drop or two of any oil. Paayal Mahajan, founder of the homegrown luxury skincare brand Essential Body Couture, taught me how to make a gently exfoliating cleansing balm at home. Equal parts moringa powder with raw honey. The balm will dry into a thick paste that can be made spreadable with a little bit of water when you use it.  The other at-home mask that I swear by is red lentil (masoor dal without peel) soaked in milk overnight, then ground to a paste in the morning. Add a pinch of turmeric to the paste, apply all over the face and then rub off when semi dry. You can make a small batch of the paste and store in your refrigerator for a few days.  Writing on beauty for over 15 years, Ive realised that the worst product for the skin is commercial face wash. In fact, if you just remove this from your skincare routine, youll find massive improvement in pigmentation, redness and hydration. Use honey for your morning cleanse and any oil (coconut, olive, apricot) for your evening cleanse. Wipe off with a steaming hot, towel to really clean out your pores. Women with the best skin havent used soap on their faces for years.  Everyone is also worried about skin sagging without a dermatologists intervention. But you can keep your skin looking tight, sculpted and de-puffed with a daily massage. I have posted several massage videos on my blog, however there are so many videos to choose from  the Japanese Tanaka face massage to the Ayurvedic marma point massage and the French tightening massage. Thank god for connectivity. The aforementioned Paayal also does a fantastic face workout that you can follow every evening at 7.30 pm live on her Instagram handle (@paayalm). I swear my skin looks so much better and tighter with her technique.  We can also rediscover hair oil that many modern hairstylists shun because they believe it makes your scalp condition worse. But heres the thing. If you oil your hair on a dirty scalp, it will obviously increase the dirt. So dont wait for your hair to get dirty. Traditionally, we would apply oil on freshly washed hair. I see no reason why we shouldnt go back to those days now. After all, there are no parties or meetings to attend. These days, I oil my hair thrice a week and keep the oil on each time for 24 hours. My hair fall has become minimal and my hair has also become quite long.  Ultimately, we cannot control the virus, the economy, or any of the repercussions that will slowly reveal themselves. But we can definitely use this time to nourish and heal. Because one thing is for sure, this too shall pass, and while we have these extra moments, lets make the most of them.

(File Photo/Representational) The challenge is going to be with the crops marketing. (File Photo/Representational)  Even as the 21-day lockdown till April 14 appears set to be extended by two weeks, both the Centre and the states are agreed that the blanket restrictions on production and movement will not apply to farm-related work. Agriculture would, indeed, be the most significant, if not the only, economic activity the country might see at least till the end of this month. The governments focus, too, will now have to be as much on the rabi crops harvesting and marketing as on keeping the war against the novel coronavirus going. But harvesting per se is unlikely to be a problem. The bulk of the mustard, chana (chickpea), masur (red lentil), sugarcane, potato and rabi onions have already been harvested. Its only wheat and some seasonal vegetables (the likes of bottle gourd, okra, brinjal and cucumber) and fruit (mango and melons) that are still in the fields. Harvesting of rabi maize, summer moong (green gram) or even Dasheri, Chaunsa and Langra mangoes will only be after May.  Simply put, harvesting will happen. Farmers will somehow manage, whether by using combines (whose movement and deployment, both inter- and intra-state, has been exempted from the lockdown) or labour (including those forced to return to villages after being rendered jobless in factories and urban centres). The challenge is going to be with the crops marketing. There are two major issues here. The first is the mandis, which are normally a hive of activity at this time, when farmers in thousands bring their trolley-loads of produce to sell. Given the imperative of social distancing, that is ruled out today. Even if farmers were to come, there arent enough labourers in wholesale markets predominantly from states such as Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, who have fled back home  to unload, clean, bag and reload their crop. The second issue is the collapse of demand. With hotels, restaurants, caterers and most agro-processing units shut, the market cannot absorb a bumper crop  a situation similar to that during April-June 2017 post demonetisation. Then, it was lack of cash. Now, it is lack of institutional buyers.  What is the way out? If overcrowding at the mandis is not to be allowed, farmers have to be given some incentive for not bringing their entire harvested crop straight from the field. There is a strong case to give, say, a bonus of Rs 50 over the minimum support price of Rs 1,925 per quintal for wheat that is sold after April 30 and Rs 100 if after May 30. Not only will this enable staggered crop arrivals, there would also be interest savings for the Food Corporation of India through reduced drawdown of cash credit limits. This is also the time for the Narendra Modi government to enact an omnibus law to remove all restrictions on sale, stocking, movement and export of farm produce.

(Express photo) Harvesting in progress in Chandauli, UP. (Express photo)  In early November, the district administration of Chandauli in eastern Uttar Pradesh banned harvester combines, citing a state government order to prevent burning of parali (leftover straw) from the paddy cut by these machines. Panic-stricken farmers approached the district magistrate, who relented after obtaining an assurance that they would not burn any standing stubble after machine-harvesting. The permission came late: Paddy harvesting could start only by early-December, against the normal time from mid-November. And with heavy rains in December 11-13, the crop also suffered extensive damage and grain discolouration. COVID-19 LIVE updates  Now in April, as Chandaulis farmers harvest wheat amid the lockdown, parali and air pollution is hardly an administrative priority. Harvesting wont be a problem. My district alone has over 100 combines, with an equal number coming from outside. We have some 230,000 acres under wheat, nearly three-fourths of which is combine-harvested and the rest manually using sickles. Each machine can do 35-40 acres over 18 hours daily, says Ajay Kumar Singh. The 42-year-old farmer from Emiliya village in Chandauli district and tehsil has planted wheat on 40 acres and summer moong (green gram) on 12 acres, which will be harvested from May.  Dont miss from Expained: 3 hotspots, 3 control models  Singhs worry isnt over harvesting. The authorities have issued passes for the combines and their operators  typically one foreman, two drivers and two helpers. The grain will get cut, but we dont know how it would be marketed. Wheat procurement is usually from around April 10. This time, it may not be before May, he points out.  Echoing the same concern is Rao Gulab Singh Lodhi from Nanhegaon village in Gotegaon tehsil of Madhya Pradeshs Narsinghpur district. He began harvesting his 36 acres of wheat in Wednesday, after having finished with chana (chickpea) and masur (red lentil) on 8 acres each in early March.

While procurement in MP is slated to start from April 15  a delay of over 15 days  he isnt sure if that would help.  The government has declared that it will not purchase more than 13 quintals per acre of wheat from any farmer, with these at 5 quintals each for chana and masur. My own average per-acre yield is 20 quintals in wheat, 12 quintals in masur and 10 quintals in chana. What do I do with the remaining crop, for which there are no takers today? They wants us to increase productivity, but are unwilling to procure our extra grain, adds Lodhi.  Read | Slight but noticeable flattening of growth curve in India  The story isnt different in onions, where around 30 labourers are required to harvest one acre in a single day. For Santosh Gorade, a farmer from Takli Vinchur village in Niphad taluka of Maharashtras Nashik district, that isnt an issue: There are enough labourers in my village. Although the ones in nearby villages may not be able to come due to the lockdown, I can stagger my harvesting.  Gorade plans to harvest his rabi onion on two out of his total 6-acre holding after April 20. Eknath Sanap, from Naigaon village in Nashiks Sinnar taluka, harvested 200 quintals from 1.5 out of his 3 acres last week. He did not find it difficult to get labour, which is largely local.  Dont miss from Explained: How a dollar swap line with US Fed can help in uncertain times  For both farmers, the primary concern is marketing. Rabi onions are amenable to storage in kanda chawls. Farmers generally keep the crop harvested in March-April in these on-field raised platform structures (to prevent moisture ingress that cause the bulbs to sprout) and sell in tranches till September-October. Yes, I can take it to the market later. But what if after lockdown, everybody rushes to sell and the prices crash?, asks Sanap.  Currently, the APMC mandis of Lasalgaon and Pimpalgaon in Nashik are functioning with skeletal staff. Unlike in farms, the labourers at these two big wholesale onion markets  those who unload, clean, bag and reload produce  are mostly from UP and Bihar, who have gone back due to the lockdown.  Read | Provide counselling to migrants: Centre to states  Availability of labour for farm work doesnt seem a constraint even in sugarcane. According to Jitender Singh Hooda, an 8-acre farmer from Kheri Bairagi village of western UPs Shamli district and tehsil, a skilled labourer can harvest, bundle and load 12-14 quintals of cane daily, for which he charges Rs 45/quintal. Four of them can, thus, deliver a full tractor trolley-load of 55-56 quintals for just over Rs 2,500.  The same job  of only harvesting and bundling 12-14 quintals  can also be done by three unskilled labourers. At a daily wage rate of Rs 350, it works out to Rs 4,200 for 56 quintals, plus another Rs 800 for loading on to the farmers trolley. Theres no dearth of labour now, especially the people who have lost their jobs after lockdown. But they have little experience in cane cultivation, explains Hooda.  Read | Three weeks and counting: Stranded and hungry at shut gateway  Hoodas present workforce includes Rakesh, a ladies tailor; Vinod, an electrician; Manoj, a construction labourer; and Krishan Pal, a mender of old jute bags  all previously working in Shamli, Karnal and nearby towns. Technically more skilled than farm hands, they are now being engaged for sugarcane planting as well. Hooda estimates the cost of planting one acre using skilled workers at Rs 4,200. The same with the new less productive persons comes to Rs 6,000 or so, but at least my work gets done.  That harvesting labour isnt a major issue is also borne out by sugar mills in UP crushing 932.08 lakh tonnes (lt) of cane during the current 2019-20 season till Friday. Over 100 lt out of this has been after the lockdown from March 25. Nearly 85% of the seasons projected crushing of 1,100 lt is over. Mills will continue to crush beyond May-end, UPs cane commissioner Sanjay Bhoosreddy told The Indian Express.  Read | In March, people hoarded cash, withdrew four times more than monthly average  For cane growers, the main problem again is in getting money. They have so far supplied cane worth more than Rs 29,800 crore at the UP governments advised price, but received only Rs 15,581 crore. Mills are unable to pay, as there is little offtake of sugar by industrial buyers or of ethanol by oil companies for blending with petrol.",MASUR DAL

As you spend a lot of time at home in the lockdown, you can put natural ingredients to great use to achieve your skin goals. We ask beauty experts and bloggers to share which kitchen ingredient they swear by and why.  Curd or Dahi (Shutterstock)  Shilpa Arora, lifestyle blogger: Eat and apply curd to glow from inside out  Curd is beneficial not only for digestion or immunity but it can do wonders for your skin as well. If you want soft, nourished and supple skin then the solution is eating curd daily and also applying it on your face. Mix curd and honey to make a smooth paste and leave on the face for 15 min. Rinse off with cold water. With its anti-inflammatory properties, curd soothes your skin and is an effective remedy for sunburn too.  Haldi or turmeric (Shutterstock)  Divyun Nanda, lifestyle blogger: Haldi helps heal  Haldi or turmeric has always been my favourite beauty ingredient due to its amazing antimicrobial, and antioxidant properties. It helps deep clean the pores, calm the skin and heal acne. In the lockdown, I have been using this traditional ubtan with haldi. I take a little haldi (powdered), besan, masoor dal (the pink or malka variety), some olive oil or mustard oil and honey along with half lemon juice to make a paste and apply on the face and neck. I allow it to remain for 15 minutes, and then I wash it off with cold water. It removes dead cells and imparts a pink glow to my skin.  Kalongi oil (Shutterstock)  Tanisha Pant, beauty expert: Kalonji oil is packed with beauty benefits  Just like our inner skin, our skin and hair also need nutrient rich food. I use a mix of eggs, sugar and kalonji oil to make a rich paste. I apply it on my hair for 20 minutes and then wash off with a mild, sulfate free shampoo. A mix of buttermilk and kalonji oil is great to brighten up dull skin. Buttermilk has natural bleaching properties, and kalonji oil has antibacterial properties which prevent allergies.  Besan or Gramflour (Shutterstock)  Richa Aggarwal, makeup expert: Besan is an all-rounder  For me, its besan. It can be turned into a scrub for deep cleansing, a hydrating pack for dry skin, a brightening agent for dull, tanned skin, and an oil absorber for oily skin. It depends on what you mix it up with to make it perform a certain task. For a quick scrub, mix it with orange peel powder. To nourishing dry skin, mix besan with honey and malai, for oily skin, add haldi and chaach to it, for normal skin, mix with raw milk, while for brightening up your complexion, soak a few strands of saffron in water and add besan to make a pack.",MASUR DAL

Several immune functions in the body rely on the production of active protein compounds  any kind of protein deficiency impacts the immune system negatively.  Numerous surveys have pointed to a rampant protein deficiency prevalent in the India population. Some surveys indicate that a whopping nine out of 10 people consume a diet deficient in proteins. This is primarily because our meals are predominantly carbohydrate based.  Changing food preferences and habits is not easy. Trying to overhaul ones usual diet is therefore not a solution to this problem, especially during distressing times such as these. To begin with, greater awareness about protein deficiency in the diet can help. Following that, one can simply tweak the regular menu to ramp up the protein intake in the diet.  Identify the Good Sources  Most of us know that meats, fish, poultry and eggs are good sources of protein, but much confusion prevails about vegetarian sources. Broccoli and lettuce are commonly cited as good sources of protein, which they are not.Beans, legumes and pulses are the vegetarian sources of protein. Whole pulses such as chana, soybean, rajma, lobia, all dals (split and washed) including toor, chana, moong, masoor and urad, and legumes (peas and beans) qualify in this category.Nuts are also a good source. Even the lowly peanut is as good a source of protein as some of the more exotic nuts.Oil seeds, including sesame, sunflower, pumpkin, chia and flax, are just as good as nuts in terms of protein content.For those who consume dairy, milk, curd, cheese, lassi, raita etc., are good sources.  The Inclusion Rule  When planning meals, make sure to include at least one good source of protein. Popular breakfast items such as Upma, Poha and breads are predominately carbohydrates, which is why it is important to include a source of protein in this meal. Milk, curd, egg/tofu or dals/pulses can serve the purpose. Many of our popular snack items also happen to be bread-based or potato-based. If youre looking to enjoy a protein-rich snack, consider something like roasted gram, Besan Cheela, Paneer Tikka, or Peanut Chaat.  The Combination Ratio  Recipes that combine cereals with pulses can effectively ramp up the protein content of a diet. The traditional Khichdi that combines rice with dal is an excellent case in point. This type of combination ensures a complete supply of amino acids (the building blocks of protein) to the body. However, the ratio of cereal to pulse in such combinations is crucial. Adding a small amount of dal to a large bowl of rice while preparing khichdi defeats the purpose of this combination. Ensure that the cereal to pulse ratio is always 5:1. Combining cereals or starch-rich foods with curd/egg/tofu (sources of protein) also achieves the same purpose.  The Benefits of Sprouting  The technique of sprouting cereals, seeds and pulses is an easy way to enhance the protein content of the food. Sprouting also makes the food more digestible, enabling it to be better absorbed by the body. Yet another advantage of sprouting is that it enhances the content of Vitamin C, folate and other B-complex vitamins in the food.Ensuring an adequate intake of protein in the diet not only boosts immunity but also improves muscle mass. Indians have a lower muscle mass compared to other ethnic groups, which is quite a handicap. Improved muscle mass will reduce the negative impact that it has on our metabolism and enhance overall well-being.  Neelanjana Singh  Nutrition Therapist & Wellness Consultant",MASUR DAL

The count is 140 if deaths in which comorbidities have been a factor are included.  Home Secretary Alapan Bandyopadhyay said since Monday evening, 85 more positive cases were detected, pushing up the number to 1,344.  Bandyopadhyay said a total of 264 people had been discharged from hospitals till date after recovering from the infection  46 of them since Monday evening. The number of active cases at present was 940, he added.  The number of samples tested in the last 24 hours are 2,455, and the total number is 27,571, said Bandyopadhyay, adding that 4,712 people were still in government quarantine while 5,561 people were in home isolation.  The Home Secretary also hit out at the Centre, accusing it of not keeping its promises.  The Central government promised to give one kg of masoor dal per family under the PMGKY scheme. So, the state needs 14,530 metric ton of masoor dal per month. But the Central government sent only 6,550 MT of masoor dal. So, we failed to distribute the daal through ration among the needy families.  Bandyopadhya said the state had already distributed half of the ration within four days.  We have to give ration among the 9.95 crore ration cards. Out of which, 9.30 crore have digital ration cards and 65 lakhs were distributed coupons. Out of that, within four days, 4.75 crore people received supplies, which is 24.9 food grains.  The Home Secretary said some dealers had been booked in these past few days for alleged irregularities in supplies. In the last four days, the food department show-caused 21 dealers, he added.  Since April, 359 dealers have been show-caused. Of these dealers, 50 were arrested, 64 were suspended, 25 were fined, and 45 cases were filed by the Enforcement Branch.  We are happy that people at large are receiving their entitlements with maintaining social distancing norms, said the Home Secretary.  Meanwhile, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee wrote on her Facebook page about a massive door-to-door surveillance undertaken by her administration across the state over the past month to identify cases of Severe Acute Respiratory Illness (SARI) and Influenza-like Illness (ILI).  The Chief Minister said 60,000 specially trained ASHA and health-workers had undertaken this exercise over the past four weeks.  The surveillance gives us early warning signals and is an important proactive step in fighting COVID-19, she added.  The Chief Minister said between April 7 and May 3 more than 5.57 crores household visits were conducted by these frontline workers, and 872 SARI cases and 91,515 ILI cases had been identified.  Banerjee said 375 people had been admitted to different health facilities due to these efforts, and 62 of them have tested positive for COVID-19. She added: The surveillance efforts are ongoing and we will not stop till we together defeat corona in Bengal.

Apparently, Gowda (name changed) is not the only one being short-changed. Many BPL cardholders maintained that they have received a few kilograms less.  Under the Food Security Act, a person is entitled to 5 kg per month, and under the PM Garib Kalyan Ann Yojana, gets an additional 10 kg of foodgrains, wheat and pulses per month in Karnataka. FCI national chairman D V Prasad told TNIE, During the lockdown, we provided Karnataka 11.8 lakh tonnes of foodgrains, 3.81 lakh tonnes under the FSA and 6 lakh tonnes under the PMGKAY -- a total of 9.81 lakh tonnes -- and the remaining under different schemes to migrants and others. To this, Karnataka Food Minister K Gopalaiah said, We have given 10 kgs rice and 1 kg dal per person in May.  In April, we gave 10 kg rice and 4 kg wheat. From June onwards, we will give 10 kg rice, 2 kg dal and 2 kg wheat. But these figures do not reflect in the distribution of foodgrains in many places. Aadhaar cardholders have not got their due of 5 kg either. Kalai, a domestic help, said she got only 3 kg rice, half a kg masoor dal, quarter kg sugar and Rs-5 packets of chilli powder, dhania powder and turmeric powder. Ravikumars household of four got 40 kg of rice for two months, but no dal or wheat.  Shanthinagar MLA N A Haris, who visited ration depots, said, Many of my constituents are housemaids and daily wage labourers, who complained that they have not received their due of 10 kg rice (per person), 1 kg dal (per card) and 2 kg wheat (per card) per month. The number of cardholders could be over 40,000 in my constituency.

56,56.0,,,2020-06-17,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/heres-why-indigenous-produce-is-garnering-more-attention-during-the-pandemic/article31852216.ece,"The pandemic has resulted in a demand for indigenous produce, as international supply chain networks come under pressure due to the lockdown and exotic ingredients stay out of reach. Are these inventive, seasonal, locally-influenced menus here to stay?  Tendli, shevla, phodsi, kantola or potol  rarely do we see these desi vegetables on a restaurant menu. However, because of the current pandemic, locally grown vegetables are making a dashing debut. With international, and even national, supply chain networks collapsing under the lockdowns, procuring exotic ingredients has become increasingly difficult. As a result, chefs are exploring local markets to make the best of what is freshly available, thus learning more about indigenous produce, and finding inventive ways to showcase it.  According to Krishna Mckenzie, an Englishman who cultivates a farm settled in Auroville, near Puducherry, the lockdown not only spurred demand for local produce, but also gave him an opportunity to acquire a deeper understanding about vegetables and plants. All this while I used bananas and its leaves for cooking. But during this lockdown, I learnt how to use banana stems and flowers in my dishes, he says.  All the fresh produce that he needs in the kitchen comes from his six-acre farm where he grows over 150 varieties of vegetables, fruits and herbs. Every week, his farm sends out vegetable baskets to subscribers, who have steadily been increasing since lockdown began.  Farmers to the chefs Achintya Anand started Krishi Cress five years ago, to supply the freshest possible produce to chefs in Delhi-NCR, from his farms in Chhattarpur and Faridabad, be it different types of mustard, different colours in baby carrots, or microgreens. With the renewed interest in local farms, Achintya recently sold his entire 60-kilograms stock of Muzaffarpur shahi lychee despite lockdown. His most popular produce includes salad leaves from farmers in Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand, and watermelon.  With an aim to provide city dwellers with fresh crops within hours of harvest, Mumbai-based brothers Brian and Benjamin Zehr started Kisano in 2018. Located across 7,000 square feet in two locations near Mumbai, the farm uses hydroponic technology to grow over 50 crop varieties that include 15 types of lettuce and several herbs.  Bengaluru-based Living Food Company was started by Akash Sajith when he started questioning the nutrition value of the food we consume. The company specialises in growing microgreens like sunflower, red cabbage, pink radish. They also grow supergreens such as curly kale, deer tongue lettuce and green butterhead lettuce.  Eating local is healthy, both for the human body and the environment. When you order exotic food, it is packed, frozen, shipped and then delivered. Imagine the carbon footprint of that! he adds.  At the ITC Grand Chola Chennai, Ajit Bangera, senior executive chef, discusses how the chefs are constantly innovating with dishes. He adds, the present situation has made it all the more imperative to pivot and adapt. So depending on the fresh local produce, our menu changes every day. The chef and his team at Chennais ITC Grand Chola have been catering for the 50 long-stay guests as well as the hotels takeaway orders.  Before the pandemic, I used to craft a menu and after that I would go looking around for ingredients. But now I first visit the vegetable vendors, learn about the seasonal produce and then make a menu based on what is available, says Jayesh Karande, executive chef at Visakhapatnams WelcomHotel Grandbay.  Shevla | Photo Credit: Special arrangement  During the lockdown Jayesh accidentally discovered a Telugu variety of palm jaggery called tati bellam in one of the oldest markets in Visakhapatnam. The jaggery is largely grown in and around Kakinada in Andhra Pradesh. It stands out because it has a hint of coffee flavour. It has now become our obvious choice for most of the desserts. Currently, I am using it generously in our watalappams, a Sri Lankan dessert made with coconut milk, eggs and nutmeg. Had it not been for the lockdown, I would have probably just sourced jaggery from Bengaluru or Hyderabad and never discovered it, he adds.  When COVID-19 brought life to a standstill, Neelabh Sahay  executive chef of Novotel Kolkata  had no choice but to rely on locally available produce.  Herbs and flowers at Krishi Cress | Photo Credit: Special arranagement  We had to tweak ingredients in common exotic dishes, says Neelabh. So sushi rice was replaced with Bengals gobindo bhog rice, while black beans  which are used extensively in Mexican cuisine  were replaced by Indian kidney beans (rajma). Also, the peppery Le Puy, a classic French preparation, is now made with local masoor chilka dal, instead of the traditional green speckled lentil.  At Bengalurus Novotel and Ibis, locally sourced basil leaves has made an entry into the exotic butternut squash ravioli. Originally, this delicacy was served with fried sage. However due to lockdown, sage is unavailable. Apart from its aroma and flavour, basil also acts as an antioxidant to strengthen the immune system, says Avijit Deb Sharma, executive chef, Novotel & ibis, Bengaluru.  Thomas Zacharia, executive chef and partner at The Bombay Canteen, has been advocating the use of indigenous produce ever since the opening of his restaurant almost five years ago. The restaurant made a conscious choice to have a menu that is centred around locally grown fruits and vegetables. The aim  then and now  is to familiarise people with the taste of the land. As the availability of the vegetable changes due to seasons, so does our menu. We change our food every three months to serve the best of what is available in the local markets. We make dishes out of karela (bitter gourd) or lauki (bottle gourd) which are loved by our customers. Till date the restaurant has had 160 local vegetables on the menu, he adds.  Kokum fruit | Photo Credit: Special arrangement  Sticking to indigenous produce is economical too, says Hussain Shahzad, executive chef at O Pedro, The Bombay Canteens sister entity. When you buy seasonal produce, they are cheap as they are available in abundance, he says. Also, they are nutritious and fresh as they come from nearby farms.

Even though the Adria Tour faced significant flak, smaller level exhibition events continue to take place. In Germany for instance, a meet took place last weekend in Pinneberg, near Hamburg, where India No 1 Sumit Nagal emerged triumphant against Daniel Masur in the final.  Nagal, the only frontline player from the country who opted to stay put in Europe rather than returning, said he took part in the event ostensibly to keep paying his bills. In an interview with this daily, he also spoke about the measures at Pinneberg Tennis Club (some 20 kms north of Hamburg) during the event, how he has been managing his income and why he has no plans to come to India in the near future.  Excerpts:  How has it been like living in Peine (a small town near Hanover), have the effects of the pandemic been felt there?  It has been okay in Peine, its a small town of only 30,000. I get to stay in the academy (he lives and trains at the Nencel academy), which is one remote corner and nobody comes in except us. So its the perfect place to train and stay in a situation like this. Around Munich it was pretty bad but overall Germany is not doing too bad at the moment.  When did you come to know of this opportunity?  I have been training since mid April but not played competition tennis in three months. So when a friend told me about this, I signed up. It was a decent field too. It was just me saying, lets get out of Peine to play in a tournament, to have a feel of that competitive environment. Besides, the place is great... everything just clicked.  What were the measures in place to control the virus?  There were no ball boys, everyone who came was checked (for fever and so on) and everything inside the club was being sanitised regularly. It also helped that there was may be a maximum of 50-60 people inside the club in total so there was no problems in practising physical distancing.  Have you had to dip into your savings yet?  Yes (laughs) a big dip into my savings, let me tell you that. If it goes on like this for the next few months, there wont be any left. Its vital to play a few meets, and thats also why I played here... I have to pay my bills. Sure, I havent taken any flights but there are other expenses. When I was playing, I was making money. Now, I am going in minus every month.  Have you signed up for any more tournaments?  I havent signed up for anything yet. I am looking to play something in 2-3 weeks time, whatever is possible.  Any plans of coming back?  I will definitely not be coming to India any time soon. The cases are getting worse. Plus, if I come, I have to quarantine.

Now give a healthy spin and turn the comfort food into a wholesome meal. Packed with nutrition and fresh flavours, here are some smart tips and tweaks from chefs for you to prepare a healthy burger without the guilt.  Healthy burgers will taste like punishment and diet food if they do not first scream with yummy flavours for the palate. They have to seduce and please mind, body and soul, all equally, thus, it is important to bring textures, flavour, colours, aromas, all into the recipe, says chef Suvir Saran.  He recalls the days when Joyce Goldstein, a friend, an award-winning chef and author of more than 27 cookbooks introduced him to farro, a type of grain and how it has become a staple in his pantry ever since. He says, Farro is now always in my pantry. I love using it to make patties for a veggie burgers. In addition to protein and heart-healthy fibre, the texture it contributes is incredibly hearty. He also adds, If you cant find farro, you can make the burgers with quinoa or Freekeh or millet instead.  One can also add potatoes, mushrooms and parmesan cheese to add a depth flavour to the patty. Saran suggests, If you want to indulge in these on a more regular basis, replace the potatoes with sweet potatoes instead. For those that are watching their intake in regards to diabetes or metabolic syndrome, the use of panko in the recipe can be substituted with crushed peanuts or even ground lentil flour.  Moving on to a healthier bun to go with a wholesome patty, chef Vinay Trilokiya, Farzi Cafe, Aerocity says, It can be a pleasurable experience if different grains in its base are paired with the right ingredients along with appropriate cheese and a variety of vibrant vegetables. Trilokiya also feels that made just responsibly, these can be your go-to meals with the right balance between protein, carbohydrates, fibre and flavour.  He recommends, As a chef, I would suggest using multigrain flour, ragi flour, whole wheat flour for making burger buns. In order to break the myth and bring the healthier side, try adding grilled or boiled bodies to the burger, such as boiled or grilled chicken, fish, meat, or one can try making patties of the same, and then bake in oven, and there you get the healthy meal.  For those looking to skip mayonnaise and tomato ketchup for the burger sauce, replace it with home-made tzatziki, guacamole and hummus for added texture and flavours. For the toppings, either put fresh vegetables or grill them. One could also opt for a single bun instead of two buns to make an open burger and avoid the extra calories.  Healthy burgers will taste like punishment and diet food if they do not first scream with yummy flavours for the palate says chef Suvir Saran  Farro and mushroom burgers by chef Suvir Saran  Ingredients: 3/4 cup/125 gm farro, 500 gm red potatoes (about 3), 6 tablespoons/90 gm natural vegetable oil, 1 sprig fresh rosemary, 1 sprig fresh thyme, 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, 500 gm brown mushroom caps, finely chopped,1 and 1/4 teaspoons kosher salt, 5 to 8 tablespoons/75 to 120 ml extra-virgin olive oil, 3 finely chopped shallots,1 tablespoon/15 ml dry white wine, dry vermouth, or water, 1/2 cup/50 gm finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese and 1 cup/50 g panko breadcrumbs  Method: Bring 2 1/4 cups/540 ml of water to a boil in a medium saucepan. Add the farro, return to a boil, cover and reduce the heat to medium-low, cooking until the farro is tender, about 30 minutes. Turn off the heat, fluff the farro with a fork, cover and set aside. While the farro cooks, boil the potatoes. Bring a large saucepan of water to a boil, add the potatoes, return the water to a boil, and cook until a paring knife easily slips into the centre of the largest potato, about 20 minutes. Drain and set aside. Once the potatoes are cool, peel them and place them in a large bowl. Remove the needles and leaves from the rosemary and thyme branches and place them in a large skillet along with the butter and black pepper. Melt the butter over medium-high, stirring occasionally. Once the herbs start cracking, after about 1 1/2 minutes, add the mushrooms and salt. Cook the mushrooms until they release their liquid and the pan is dry again, 6 to 7 minutes, stirring often. Transfer the mushrooms to the bowl with the potatoes and set aside.  Heat 1 tablespoon/15 ml of olive oil over medium-high heat in the skillet. Add the shallots and cook until they are soft and just starting to brown, about 2 minutes. Add the wine (or Vermouth or water) and stir to work in any browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Turn off the heat and scrape the shallots into the bowl with the mushrooms and potatoes. Add the Parmesan along with the farro. Use a potato masher or fork to mash the ingredients together.  For the mixture into 10 patties. Place the panko in a shallow dish and press the top and bottom of each patty into the panko to evenly coat. Heat 1/4 cup/60 ml of olive oil in a clean large skillet over medium-high heat. Add 5 patties and cook on each side until nicely browned and crusty, 8 to 10 minutes total. Remove the patties from the skillet and place them on a plate. Repeat with the remaining patties, adding more oil between batches if necessary. Serve hot.

""Point to point rate of inflation based on the CPI-AL (Consumer Price Index-Agricultural Labourers and CPI-RL (Consumer Price Index for rural labourers) decreased to 7.16 per cent and 7.00 per cent in June 2020 from 8.40 per cent and 8.12 per cent, respectively in May 2020,"" the ministry said.  According to the statement, inflation based on food index of CPI-AL and CPI-RL stood at (+) 8.57 per cent and (+) 8.41 per cent, respectively, in June 2020.  The All-India CPI-AL and CPI-RL (Base: 1986-87=100) for June 2020 decreased by 1 point each to stand at 1,018 and 1,024 points, respectively, compared to 1,019 and 1,025 in May this year.  The major contribution towards the fall in general index of agricultural labourers and rural labourers came from food, with (-) 1.82 points and (-) 1.58 points, respectively, mainly due to fall in prices of rice, arhar dal, masur dal, ground nut oil, meat goat, poultry, vegetables and fruits, among others.  Labour Minister Santosh Gangwar said, ""The softening of inflation is mainly due to free supply of food grains under PM Garib Kalyan Ann Yojana (PMGKAY).  This has benefitted a large number of households under Targeted Public Distribution System (TPDS) including agricultural and rural labourers thereby putting less burden on their daily budgetary requirement"".  The CPI-AL and CPI-RL are brought out by Labour Bureau - a wing of labour ministry. Director General Labour Bureau D S Negi said easing of inflation reflects the efforts done by the central and state governments along with civil societies to ensure supplies of essentials during these testing times amid COVID-19 outbreak.  According to the data, the rise/fall in index varied from state to state. In case of agricultural labourers, it recorded an increase of 1 to 7 points in 9 states and a decrease of 1 to 19 points in 9 other states, while it remained stationary in 2 states - Manipur and Rajasthan.  Tamil Nadu with 1,214 points topped the index, whereas Himachal Pradesh with 784 points stood at the bottom.  In case of rural labourers, it recorded an increase of 1 to 8 points in 9 states and a decrease of 2 to 20 points in 10 states, while it remained stationary in Manipur. Tamil Nadu with 1,199 points topped the index, whereas Himachal Pradesh scored the lowest 832 points.  Amongst states, the maximum increase in the Consumer Price Index Numbers for agricultural labourers and rural labourers was experienced by Orissa (7 points and 8 points respectively) mainly due to rise in the prices of meat goat, fish fresh/dry, vegetables and fruits and saree cotton (mill) etc.  On the contrary, the maximum decrease in the Consumer Price Index Numbers for agricultural labourers and rural labourers was experienced by Jammu & Kashmir State (-19 points and -20 points respectively) mainly due to fall in the prices of fruits and vegetables, among others.",MASUR DAL

Food habits during coronavirus (COVID-19) may have shifted from diverse and nutritive diets to staple foods such as wheat and rice as the prices of vegetables, pulses and eggs rose sharply after the lockdown while those of cereals remained relatively stable, according to a new study by the Tata-Cornell Institute for Agriculture and Nutrition in New York.  How the coronavirus crisis is affecting food supply  The study, Pandemic Prices: COVID-19 price shocks and their implications for nutrition security in India, authored by Payal Seth, Prabhu Pingali and Bhaskar Mittra, was launched earlier this month.  It analyses prices of cereals (wheat and rice) and non-cereals (onion, tomatoes, potatoes, five pulses and eggs) in 11 tier-1 and tier-2 cities from March 1 to May 31 compared to the same period last year. It uses weekly-level retail data from the Department of Commerce Affairs of the Union government and wholesale prices from the National Egg Coordination Committee. The nationwide lockdown was imposed from March 25.  Reduce prices of grains for relief work, says Brinda  The study revealed that following the lockdown all food groups witnessed a rise in prices compared to 2019, but the rise in prices was higher for non-cereals compared to cereals. After the lockdown was lifted, prices of cereals, eggs, potatoes, onions and tomatoes stabilised quickly while those of protein-rich pulses continued to remain high.  Wheat price  Retail wheat and rice prices were either stable or cheaper than weeks preceding the lockdown as well as same time last year. Compared to last year, the potato price was as high as 30-90% in several cities but stabilised by the first week of May; the price of onions was as high as 200-250% immediately after the lockdown in some States and stabilised by April end, and higher in some cases; and tomatoes were higher compared to pre-COVID-19 period but began to show a downward trend. The wholesale prices of eggs show that they fell initially (authors argue it was because of fear of coronavirus through poultry), increased by March end and then stabilised two months later.  Preventing food shortages is a high priority for South Asia, says World Bank economist  Prices of pulses rose during the lockdown and continued to remain higher than the pre-COVID-19 levels  arhar (tur dal) was up by up to 45%, red lentil (masur dal) by 20-50%, moong dal by 20-80% gram dal ranged from 10 to 40% and urad dal by 0-80%.  Consumption decisions  The relative stability in cereal prices and enhanced prices of pulses will most likely distort spending and consumption decisions. This will perpetuate reliance on a staple-based, protein-deficient diet. The government can ensure the provision of supplementary protein that is expected to be lost due to the price rise by timely interventions to stabilise the increase in prices, the authors recommend. They criticise recent amendment to the Essential Commodities Act, which deregulated cereals, edible oils, oilseeds, pulses, onions, and potatoes and argue that policies that insulate non-staple supply chains from price shocks and fluctuations and repealing jaded restrictions to address farm sector bottlenecks were critical.  The report submits that the relatively higher prices of more nutritious food makes it difficult for the poor and marginal population to access such nutrient-rich food. As a result, proportion of such foods in the diets goes further down and is replaced by less nutritious and calorie-dense foods. This is likely to worsen the nutritional status of women and children across India, and more so in the impoverished regions of the country, co-author of the report, Bhaskar Mittra, told The Hindu in an email.",MASUR DAL

There was a wonderful Greek restaurant there (more than 15 years ago), and I still fondly remember its dolmas. Then that shut, but to my utter joy, a restaurant came up in its place which had a wide spectrum of food from the states, including from the northeast. But all good things come to an end, so that restaurant  called Mosaic  shut, too.  Did I say all good things come to an end? Not always. After many ups and downs, and several restaurants here and there, the deft hand behind Mosaic is now wielding the spatula again. My friend Sohail had alerted me to the fact that a new outfit called Culinary Connections by Utpala Mukherjee (Ph: 9811157989 and 9350155045) was delivering food. I had a look at the menu and found some of my old favourites there. So, I promptly called up and placed a modest order.  A very happy meal later, I had a chat with the chef. An Assamese, she grew up in Shillong, learnt how to cook from her mother and then started her culinary improvisations. She ran Mosaic, the YWCA Kitchen, and the restaurant in Assam Bhavan for a while. After the lockdown, she decided to start a delivery service.  The menu has a nice variety, with some choice dishes under Western, Bengali, and Northeastern Sections. Every week, it has something special to offer. This week it is daab chingri (prawns cooked in coconut milk, 700), pork sorpotel (375), and thor (a dish of tender banana stem, 300).  We asked for a full roast chicken with onion sauce, mashed potatoes, and glazed vegetables (half, Rs 325; full, Rs 450), shepherds pie (400), dhokar dalna (175), muttar puri with alur dum (150), and patishapta (150). We got a discount, and the bill (with delivery charges) came to 1,225.  I enjoyed the roast, which came with a delicious sauce. The chicken was neither too dry, nor underdone, and the dripping from the roast had been cooked with onions and some secret ingredients, Mukherjee says. It didnt come with mashed potatoes but whole, browned potatoes, which went superbly with the roast that was perfect.  The shepherds pie was excellent, too  though somewhat different from the way I cook it. It had bits of chopped carrots in it (the traditional recipe does have carrots) and the flavour of the Worcestershire sauce was strong.  Among Bengali dishes, dhokar dalna is one of my favourites. It is a dish of steamed lentil cakes in a tomato-onion gravy. I had some of that with the muttar puris (each plate had four puris) and the aloo  which was a delicious dish of potatoes, boiled and fried, and then cooked with ginger, garlic, onion, tomatoes, and spices.  The patishapta disappointed me. It was much too small, I thought, and could have done with a thicker filling of kheer.  I would have liked some pork, but Id OD-ed on the meat the week before, so stayed away from my favourite northeastern dish of pork cooked with black sesame paste (250) and roast pork with cream spinach and mashed potatoes (325).  The Western section also includes roast lamb with mint sauce (400), fish and chips (385), vegetable crepes in cheese sauce (250) and vegetable au gratin (250).

While the organisation is making Ganesha idols since last few years during the festival, this year, it has prepared idols with red sands and seeds that will not contaminate the water bodies.According to Kannan, a social worker associated with the NGO said: During Ganesh Chaturthi, people buy Ganesha idols coloured with Enamel paint. After worshipping them, people immerse these idols in water bodies, contaminating the water, due to which many fishes die.This year, we are coming up with 1,000 idols with 6 inches to 18 inches. The response is good. With the government banning immersion of idols in water bodies due to COVID-19 outbreak, people can buy these Ganesha idols stuffed with seeds and dissolve them in their gardens or nearby fields, he said.(This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text.

While the Opposition may have taken up the cudgels recently, the fact is that farmers have been protesting against the Bills ever since it was promulgated as ordinances in June. These are The Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill, 2020. The resignation of Food Processing Industries Minister (and Shiromani Akali Dal MP), Harsimrat Kaur Badal, from the Union Cabinet, and dissenting voices from various mass organisations affiliated to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh suggest that the opposition to the Bills may not be politically motivated; rather, it may be a reflection of the genuine concerns of farmers.In brief, the Bills aim to do away with government interference in agricultural trade by creating trading areas free of middlemen and government taxes outside the structure of Agricultural Produce Market Committees (APMCs) along with removing restrictions of private stockholding of agricultural produce. Attempts to reform the APMC are not new and have been part of the agenda of successive governments for the last two decades. Most farmer organisations also agree that there is excessive political interference and there is need for reform as far as functioning of mandis are concerned.Parliament proceedings | Rajya Sabha passes two farm Bills amid fierce protestsNo consultationSeveral reforms at the level of the central government as well as at the State level have been introduced and welcomed by farmers. However, in this particular case, the issue is not about the Bills; it is also about the process of their introduction. As was pointed out by Ms. Badal, the government has failed to have or hold any discussion with the various stakeholders including farmers and middlemen. This is also true when it comes to consultation with State governments even though the subject of trade and agriculture are part of subjects on the State list. The attempt to pass the Bills without proper consultation adds to the mistrust among various stakeholders including State governments. While the lack of consultation has certainly added to the element of mistrust between the government and farmers, some of the issues raised by farmer organisations are also genuine; recent trends in agricultural prices and incomes have only confirmed these fears.While farmer organisations see these Bills as part of the larger agenda of corporatisation of agriculture and a withdrawal of government support, the immediate concern has been the attempt to weaken the APMC mandis and eventual withdrawal of the Minimum Support Prices (MSP) guaranteed by the government. Although the government has clarified that these Bills do not imply withdrawal of procurement by the State at MSP, there is a genuine fear among farmers about the true intentions of the government. The mistrust is not unfounded given the track record of this government on many issues including demonetisation of 2016, the introduction of Goods and Services Tax and so on. There may not be direct evidence of crony capitalism, but the entry, in a big way, of two of the biggest corporate groups (Adani and Reliance) in food and agricultural retail and the timing of the Bills have not gone unnoticed.Also read | We will move the courts against anti-farmer bills: Amarinder SinghReflects poor understandingThe idea of allowing greater participation of traders and farmers outside the APMC has already been in place in different form. Even otherwise, APMCs account for less than a fourth of total agricultural trade. But APMCs do play an important role of price discovery essential for agricultural trade and production choices. The vilification of APMCs and the middlemen who facilitate trade in these mandis is a poor reflection of the understanding of functioning of agricultural markets. The middlemen are a part of the larger ecosystem of agricultural trade, with deep links between farmers and traders. Most farmers are familiar with the functioning of mandis and see it as an essential part of agricultural trade despite shortcomings. While the proposed Bills do not do away with the APMC mandis, the preference for corporate interests at the cost of farmers interests and a lack of regulation in these non-APMC mandis are cause for concern. The absence of any regulation in non-APMC mandis is being seen as a precursor to the withdrawal of the guarantee of MSP-based procurement.Also read | Highways blocked as farmers protests continue in Haryana, PunjabThe Bihar exampleThe dominant concern in this regard has been expressed by farmers in Punjab and Haryana. Farmers in these States have genuine concern about the continuance of the MSP-based public procurement given the large-scale procurement operations in these States. These fears gain strength with the experience of States such as Bihar which abolished APMCs in 2006. After the abolition of mandis, farmers in Bihar on average received lower prices compared to the MSP for most crops. For example, as against the MSP of 1,850 a quintal for maize, most farmers in Bihar reported selling their produce at less than 1,000 a quintal. Despite the shortcomings and regional variations, farmers still see the APMC mandis as essential to ensuring the survival of MSP regime.Comment | Hardly the 1991 moment for agricultureWhile retail prices have remained high, data from the Wholesale Price Index (WPI) suggest a deceleration in farm gate prices for most agricultural produce. This has happened despite increased procurement through the MSP-based regime for paddy and wheat. Decline in basmati rice prices by more than 30% and despite higher international prices suggests the limitation of market intervention in raising farm gate prices. For most crops where MSP-led procurement is non-existent, the decline has been sharper. Even cash crops such as cotton have seen a collapse in prices in the absence of government intervention. With rising input costs, farmers do not see the market providing them remunerative prices. At the same time, ad hoc interventions by government such as raising import duties on masur and a ban on onion exports also raise suspicion about the intent of the government to leave the price discovery mechanism on the market. The protests by farmers are essentially a reflection of the mistrust between farmers and the stated objective of these reforms.Himanshu is Associate Professor, Centre for Economic Studies and Planning, School of Social Sciences, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi",MASUR DAL

Congress leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury said the constitutional measure of bringing ordinance should be resorted to as an exception and not a rule. Criticising the bill, which replaces an ordinance, he said it is weakly constructed with minimum logic and a lot of grey area. It is nothing but is aimed to patronise their (government) preferred corporates, he alleged, adding the MSME sector will be its worst victim.

Besides, MSPs of lentil (masoor), gram, barley, safflower and mustard/rapeseed have been increased.The move came a day after Parliament approved two agriculture sector-reform bills which have been bitterly opposed by the opposition parties like Congress and TMC as well as from within ruling NDA alliance over apprehension that the new legislations might virtually end MSP-based procurement by the government.Farmer groups in Punjab, Haryana and some other states are also protesting the two bills  The Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020 and The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020  have been passed by Parliament.Tomar said the MSPs of six rabi crops were approved by the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday, a move aimed at encouraging farmers ahead of the sowing operations of winter crops.Announcing the increased MSPs for the six rabi crops for 2020-21 crop year (July-June) and 2021-22 marketing season, Tomar said MSP of gram has been increased by Rs 225 to Rs 5,100 per quintal.

Lentil MSP has been hiked by Rs 300 to Rs 5,100 per quintal.The MSP of mustard/ rapeseed have been raised by Rs 225 to Rs 4,650 per quintal, while that of saffflower has been hiked by Rs 112 to Rs 5,327 per quintal. Tomar said the government has been maintaining that the MSP mechanism will continue and the approval of new support price ahead of rabi season attests to this fact as against a false propaganda spread by Opposition parties.Some Congress MPs walked out of the House after Tomar made the announcement about the MSPs. Citing various data, Tomar said the procurement has been significantly higher under this government in the last six years compared to the UPA regime.Tomar said Rs 7 lakh crore has been paid to farmers as MSP in the last six years, which is nearly double than the UPA government. The minister said the MSP and APMC mechanisms as well as the governments purchase of crops at MSP rates would continue. He added that farmers would also be free to sell outside APMC mandis.Later in a series of tweets, Tomar said the MSP of wheat is 106 per cent more than the production cost. In case of gram and lentil, the MSP is 78 per cent higher than production cost. The support price of barley is 65 per cent above the production cost.Mustard MSPs is 93 per cent higher than production cost, while safflowers support price is 50 per cent higher than the cost of production. Meanwhile, the government on Monday set food grain production target at a record 301 million tonnes for the 2020-21 crop year, up nearly 1.5 per cent from the previous years output, on the back of good monsoon rains and higher acreage in the kharif season.The target of wheat output has been set at 108 million tonnes for 2020-21 as compared to 107.59 million tonnes in the previous year.

Agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar announced the hike in Lok Sabha.The new MSP rates, announced earlier than usual, come amid widespread protests by opposition parties and farmer groups in Punjab and Haryana, after Parliament passed two key farm bills on Sunday. Earlier in the day, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in a video address, said opponents of the farm-sector reforms were misleading farmers, saying the government would continue to buy farmers produce at MSP rates.MSPs are federally fixed prices for farm produce aimed at preventing distress sale. The government buys largely rice and wheat at these prices through its procurement system.For the upcoming winter-sown season, the highest increase in MSP was announced for lentil (a jump of Rs 300 a quintal) followed by gram and rapeseed and mustard (Rs 225 a quintal each) and safflower (Rs 112 a quintal). The Cabinet approved an increase of Rs 75 a quintal and Rs 50 a quintal for barley and wheat.At these new MSP rates for key winter crops, farmers would get 106% return over cost of cultivation for wheat, 65% return over costs for barley, and 78% returns over cultivation costs for lentil (masoor) and gram, and 98% return over costs for mustard.In absolute terms, wheat MSP for 2021-22 stands at Rs 1,975 a quintal, up from Rs 1,925 in the previous year. Similarly, the MSP for lentil stands at Rs 5,100, higher than Rs 4,800 during 2020-21. The MSP for mustard was hiked to Rs 4,650 from Rs 4,425 earlier.The differential remuneration (varying hikes in MSP) is aimed at encouraging crop diversification. This increase in MSP is in line with the recommendations of the Swaminathan Commission, a Cabinet note said.Earlier in the day, in a speech aimed at putting a lid on concerns of farmers groups, Modi said the existing agricultural state-regulated mandis (also known as agricultural produce market committees or APMCs) would continue to function. He also said the government would continue to buy farm produce at MSP rates.APMCs will not shut down. The new laws are not against mandis and I also want to assure the country that the government will continue to buy farm produce at minimum support prices in every (farm marketing) season, the PM had said.Parliament on Sunday passed The Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020, which aims to ease all restrictions on trade of agriculture produce. The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020, also passed on Sunday, lays down a new architecture for contract farming in the country so that agribusiness and farmers can engage with one another more confidently, enable modern supply chains and investments by agribusinesses in cultivation.Some farmer groups want the government to write MSP into the new act.Our demand is to make MSP a legal right.

76,76.0,,,2020-09-21,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/govt-hikes-msps-of-six-rabi-crops-pulses-and-oilseeds-get-preference-over-wheat/articleshow/78241882.cms,"NEW DELHI: A day after passage of two crucial farm Bills in the Parliament amid opposition pandemonium and allegations that farmer interests were being sacrificed, the Centre in Lok Sabha on Monday announced hikes in minimum support prices (MSPs) of six Rabi crops ranging from 2% to 6% with lentils (pulses) and mustard (oilseed) getting the highest increases.The announcement of new MSPs much ahead of beginning of the Rabi sowing season is seen as an attempt by the government to allay doubts from minds of farmers over the future of the support price in the wake of passing of the two farm Bills  one on Agri market and the other on contract farming. Some farm organisations and many opposition parties have taken up the issue, with BJP's long-time partner Akali Dal even quitting the cabinet over the issue.Records of the past 12 years show that the government had not made an announcement of MSPs for Rabi crops in September. The prices were either announced in October or later in November or even December. Once the MSP rates were announced as late as almost the end of the Rabi sowing season on January 29 in 2009 during UPA-I. The price signal for pulses and oilseeds is intended to reduce the traditional skew in favour of cereals which will still deliver highest returns overall.The timing of the announcement was clearly politically significant. The Opposition members are spreading misinformation about MSP. They have been saying that the new legislation will end the MSP system. I want to tell the farmers through these new MSPs that the system will stay, agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar told TOI after making announcement of new rates in Lok Sabha.He earlier told the House that the announcement is a proof of governments commitment towards continuation of the MSP-based procurement system and slammed the Opposition for spreading rumours. The reforms envisaged in the bills aim to provide farmers options other than APMC procurement and also facilitate leasing of land for contract farming. Government has said the Bills increase farmer choice and reduce the role of middlemen. But given the close linkages between middlemen -- who function as informal bankers -- and farmers in states like Punjab and Haryana, the Bills have given rise to apprehensions that the government is seeking to assuage.Analysis of the new MSPs shows the governments focus on pulses and oilseeds. The MSP for lentils (pulses) got the highest hike of 6.3% - from Rs 4,800 per quintal in 2019-20 to Rs 5,100 per quintal in 2020-21  followed by mustard (5.1%), Barley (4.9%), Gram (4.6%), wheat (2.6%) and safflower (2.1%). The procurement on the basis of these MSPs will be made in the marking season of 2021-22, beginning April 1.The MSP announcement gives a price signal to farmers ahead of the sowing season so that they can make the right choice of crop. The new MSPs were approved by the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA), chaired by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi. This increase in MSP is in line with the recommendations of Swaminathan Commission, claimed the agriculture ministry in a statement.In view of nutritional requirements and changing dietary pattern and to achieve self-sufficiency in pulses and oilseeds production, the government has fixed relatively higher MSP for these crops, said the ministry adding the differential remuneration is aimed at encouraging crop diversification.The increase in MSP for 2020-21 Rabi Crops for the marketing season of 2021-22 is in line with the principle of fixing the MSPs at a level of at least 1.5 times of the all-India weighted average cost of production as announced in Union Budget 2018-19.The expected returns to farmers over their cost of production are estimated to be highest in case of Wheat (106%) followed by rapeseed & mustard (93%), gram and lentil (78%). For barley, return to farmers over their cost of production is estimated at 65% and for safflower, it is 50%.The cost of production for arriving at new MSPs includes all paid out costs such as those incurred on account of hired human labour, bullock labour/machine labour, rent paid for leased in land, expenses incurred on use of material inputs like seeds, fertilizers, manures, irrigation charges, depreciation on implements and farm buildings, interest on working capital, diesel/electricity for operation of pump sets etc, miscellaneous expenses and imputed value of family labour.",MASUR DAL

They have made a mockery of the farmers' protests over the farm bills , which by all accounts will eventually pave the way for ending the MSP system and abolish the Food Corporation of India, said the CM in a statement here.The Centre on Monday hiked the MSP for buying six Rabi crops, including wheat, by up to six per cent. The MSP of wheat has been hiked by Rs 50 to Rs 1,975 per quintal. Besides, MSPs of lentil (masoor), gram, barley, safflower and mustard/rapeseed have been increased.Singh said if the BJP-led NDA government at the Centre thought it would appease the agitating farms with this trifling hike, they clearly did not understand the situation.You can't just throw crumbs at someone who may be on the verge of losing his livelihood as a result of your shameful actions, he told the Union government.The farmers have been asking for a written guarantee that MSP will not be tampered with, but instead, the Centre has made a a measly offering to them, said the CM.He said this once again showed how little the BJP and its allies, including the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD), knew about the farmers and their problems.At a time when the farmers were not even sure that the MSP regime will stay, and for how long, making these ""meagre"" hikes in the support price of a few crops amounted to playing with their emotions, said the CM.The verbal assurances and promises made by the government which has failed to implement even its written promises and commitments are totally meaningless, he said, urging the central government to take cognisance of farmers' concerns even now and address them with meaningful steps instead of such antics.Singh said the farmers are at present worried about their future, and that of their families, and want categorical and clear commitments only, in black and white, that their produce will continue to be procured in the APMC (Agricultural Produce Market Committee) markets at a minimum assured price.They want to be secure about their livelihood, which in any case has been progressively declining due to the Centre's anti-farmer policies over the past six years, he added.He also regretted that the centre had once again failed to announce a bonus of Rs 100 per quintal for paddy straw management to incentivise farmers not to burn it.",MASUR DAL

Last year, MSP for wheat had seen a 4.6% increase.Also read: Govt hikes MSP for wheat by 85, pulses by 325 per quintalThis comes in the midst of a vehement protest by farmers, who fear that new agricultural marketing reforms will result in the phasing out of MSP and public procurement.The MSP is the rate at which the government purchases crops from farmers, and is based on a calculation of at least one and a half times the cost of production incurred by farmers. The MSP for wheat will be increased by 2.6% or 50 per quintal to 1,975 per quintal for the upcoming rabi or winter crop season, according to the decision taken by the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs on Monday. MSP rates were also hiked for five other winter crops -- barley, gram, masur dal, safflower, and rapeseed and mustard.For more than a decade, MSPs for the rabi season have been announced in October or November, as winter planting begins. However, this years MSP announcement comes just a day after Parliament cleared two controversial Bills, which will facilitate contract farming and the sale of agricultural produce outside the notified Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) mandis where most procurement takes place.While the Congress is telling the entire country that the MSP and APMC will be removed after the passing of the agricultural reform Bills, this Cabinet decision is a proof from the government that they will remain, Mr. Tomar told Lok Sabha.Opposition parties and a range of farmers groups, including those affiliated to the RSS, have warned that the new legislation will result in a dilution of the MSP regime and government procurement. They are demanding that the government include a legal guarantee for MSP to ensure that neither public nor private buyers pay less than MSP rates, whether sales take place within or outside mandis.In actual fact, only a small percentage of farmers are able to sell to government at MSP rates, although Mr. Tomar claimed that procurement has shot up in both quantity and value terms under the BJP government. In 2019-20, 36% more wheat was procured by the government in comparison to 2013-14, with an 85% jump in value, according to data provided by the Agriculture Ministry. With regards to paddy procurement, there was a 114% hike in quantity over the same period, with a 192% increase in value.",MASUR DAL

(Photo: LSTV/PTI)IN THE face of intensifying protests against its contentious farm Bills ahead of the Bihar elections, the Government and the BJP have kickstarted a campaign to counter Opposition claims that the laws are anti-farmer.In the Lok Sabha Monday, Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar announced an increase in Minimum Support Price (MSP) for six rabi crops. He said the decision proves the Government is committed to retaining the MSP mechanism and clearing the lie spread by the Opposition.The decision was read out on the floor of the House and followed by a press conference by three Union Ministers, Ravi Shankar Prasad, Piyush Goyal and Pralhad Joshi. The MSP of wheat has been increased by Rs 50 per quintal, barley by Rs 75, gram (chana) by Rs 225, lentil (masur) by Rs 300, rapeseed & mustard by Rs 225, and safflower by Rs 112.I want to tell farmers that when the Bills for agrarian reforms came, Congressmen across the country said that after their passage, the MSP will be abolished and APMC will be abolished. I want to tell the country that the MSP will continue, the APMC will continue, Tomar told Lok Sabha.Tomars announcement came hours after Prime Minister Narendra Modi reiterated, during a virtual address at a foundation event for highway projects in Bihar, that the Farm laws were historic and necessary.Taking a swipe at the Congress, he said: After these historic changes in the agriculture sector, after such a big system change, some people saw that it is slipping out of their grip. So now, these people are trying to mislead farmers on MSP.This was the second time in three days that Modi has hailed the contentious Bills and criticised the Opposition while addressing events in poll-bound Bihar.On Monday, three Congress MPs  Gurjeet Singh Aujla, Jasbir Singh Gill and Ravneet Singh Bittu  rushed out of their seats as Tomar made the announcement and shouted slogans against the Government. Aujla tore papers and flung them in the air before walking out in protest.The BJP, meanwhile, has launched a massive drive to counter criticism that the two Bills  The Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill 2020 and the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill  are against the interests of farmers.Following widespread protests by farmers in Punjab and Haryana, and the resignation of SAD leader Harsimrat Kaur Badal from the Union Cabinet, the party has asked its MPs, leaders and functionaries to go on the offensive and explain the salient features of the Bills, sources said.Incidentally, during its first term too, the Government had to counter charges of being anti-farmer when it tried to push the Land Acquisition Bills during its first term  the Bills were dropped due to protests.After the SAD move, Tomar has met separate groups to explain the provisions of the Bills and highlight those that the government believes would benefit farmers. The Agriculture Minister also met BJP functionaries, including Ministers and leaders in and around Punjab, and urged them to go on the offensive against the Oppositions criticism.Tomar also held a virtual meeting with agriculture ministers of BJP-ruled states, spokespersons at the national and state levels, and officebearers of the Bharatiya Kisan Sangh and Swadeshi Jagaran Manch  two RSS affiliates that have protested against the Bill. Tomar held another meeting with MPs on the Bills provisions.BJP Parliamentary Secretary Balasubrahmanyam Kamarsu has distributed campaign material for the MPs on the Bills. Besides, all party leaders including ministers have been asked to use Twitter to push the Bills, sources said.After the MSP announcement, BJP chief J P Nadda tweeted: The central government has not only increased the MSP but also increased the purchase on the MSP to ensure the remuneration value of the farmers. The false face of people who mislead farmers on the basis of facts has been exposed today, they should now apologize to our Annadata brothers and sisters. The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

Before the debate heated up in India, it had found a connect in the US election.Democratic vice presidential candidate Senator Kamala Harris, during her maiden address to the Indian-American community in August, recalled how her Indian origin mother always wanted to instill in her a love of good idli.Growing up, my mother would take my sister Maya and me back to what was then called Madras because she wanted us to understand where she had come from and where we had ancestry. And of course, she always wanted to instill in us, a love of good idli, Harris said.(This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text.)Follow more stories on Facebook and Twitter",MASUR DAL

Instantly, the fare turned popular.Ever since, Jomon has been envisaging Kerala cuisine in a contemporary presentation, introducing healthy and wholesome meals to the world.Extensive research goes behind selecting each element indigenous to Kerala and plating them all together in a soulful and visually aesthetic manner. Mathanga erissery from our local cuisine was altered and reinvented to create Pumpkin steak. Roasted pumpkin was served on red lentil and coconut sauce, tempered with mustard seeds, curry leaves and served with roasted coconut. The final dish is included in the menu only if Im convinced of my creation. Almost every such revamped dish takes weeks to be formulated, says Jomon.While we are familiar with western dishes plated delicately, Indian food is mostly served in thalis. Elevating the same to a fine dining experience is challenging, stresses Jomon.Plating Indian food has many restrictions. The colour combinations, textures, taste palate and the main proteins flavour must be synchronous, he explains.The Mavelikkara native highlighted that there have been instances wherein he was influenced by the manner Keralites eat.We tend to add mashed banana, crushed pappadam and a hint of pickle to the payasam that we eat, thereby subconsciously changing the consistency of the same. I plated the dish in a contemporary manner using similar concepts with pal payasam, caramelised banana, pappadam strips and date pickle. Similarly, our famous fish moilee preparation was elevated to a fine dining experience using avoli fish instead of the pomfret which contains a lot of bones. Weve had many guests requesting the dish, beams Jomon.Ambassador of Kerala cuisineAdding another perspective, the chef also aims to inform people about the already existing local vegan fare in Kerala such as avial sans curd, erissery and sambar.Why not introduce them to the world in a modernised version?Ive noticed that people are acquainted with dishes such as dal makhani, butter chicken and palak gosht but most outside Kerala havent heard of our erissery or kalan. I intend to convince them that I have something better and healthier in my state. Regardless of the plating technique, the authentic flavour will not be compromised at any cost, adds Jomon.Coach Chef de Cuisine!Chef de Cuisine at The LaLiT London, Jomon had earlier appeared in BBC Celebrity Masterchef 2018 to train two British celebrities in Indian cooking techniques. His current responsibility entails creating exciting dishes to enhance his menu, a job Jomon takes to heart and soul. Transforming the humble and rich delectable Kerala cuisine to modern masterpieces in his luxury hotel is no mean feat.

The Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) on Friday issued an order allowing unhindered import of this key kitchen item from the tiny Himalayan nation without any licence till January 31, 2021.Potato prices have been hovering between Rs 40 and Rs 45 per kg across cities. The government move is aimed at addressing this concern quickly. Union food and consumer affairs minister Piyush Goyal told reporters that 30,000 tonnes of potatoes will arrive from Bhutan in the next few days.In another public notice, the DGFT also laid out the procedure for import of potatoes under the tariff rate quota scheme. According to the procedure, only one application against one import-export code will be considered and successful applicants will have to ensure that the import consignment reaches the Indian ports on or before January 31 next year. A total of 10 lakh tonnes is allowed for import.Earlier in the day, Goyal indicated that the government will continue import of onion and pulses (urad and arhar) as well to tide over the current problem of high prices. Private players have imported 7,000 tonnes of onion and another 27,000 tonnes will reach by Diwali , he said.The government is also likely to extend the memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Mozambique to import 2 lakh tonnes of arhar per annum for the next five years. Another fresh MoU is likely to be signed with Myanmar to import 2 lakh tonnes of urad per year for the next five years.The minister said there will be enough supply of onions in the market as the government cooperative Nafed will also invite bids from private parties to import the commodity. He said the government is following the twin track policy of increasing production as well as import to meet the shortage.Goyal said along with imports, arrival of new kharif onion crops in mandis from next month will improve supply which will reduce prices. The government has pegged kharif and later kharif onion output lower by 6 lakh tonnes to 37 lakh tonnes in the current year.The minister said retail prices of onion, potato and some of the pulses had increased, but for the last few days, prices have been stable after the government took proactive measures, including ban on export of onion and making the process for import easier for private players.He also added that to ensure smooth domestic supply of pulses, the government has extended the time-limit for import of 4 lakh tonnes of arhar dal till December and licences have been issued for import of 1.5 lakh tonnes of urad. The import duty of 10% on masoor will continue till December-end as well.",MASUR DAL

Kamala Harris, speaks at a campaign event in Las Vegas. (AP)Written by Jeffrey Gettleman and Suhasini RajMore than 8,000 miles from the White House, in an Indian village ringed by lush green rice paddies, several dozen people flocked into a Hindu temple, carrying roses and strings of sweet-smelling jasmine, uttering prayers for Sen. Kamala Harris.The village, Thulasendrapuram, has a special relationship to Harris, the Democratic vice presidential nominee. Its where her maternal grandfather was born more than 100 years ago.On Tuesday, Thulasendrapuram, which is about eight hours drive from the southern city of Chennai, pulled together in a special ceremony at the main temple to wish Harris good luck on Election Day.Men wearing white dhotis, a sarong-like wrap, and women in bright saris draped Hindu idols with flowers and chanted hymns. As the election began to unfold in the United States, everyone was bubbly with confidence that Joe Biden, the Democratic nominee for president, and Harris, would win.She is the daughter of the villages soil, said Lalitha, a housewife, who could barely contain her excitement. The position she has attained is unbelievable.Read | How Kamala Harris family in India helped shape her valuesAlthough Harris has been more understated about her Indian heritage than about her experience as a Black woman, her path to the U.S. vice presidential nomination has also been guided by the values of her Indian-born mother and her wider Indian family.In several speeches, Harris has gushed about her Indian grandfather, P.V. Gopalan, a civil servant who inspired her with his stories about fighting for the rights of Indians to win independence from Britain.Gopalan defied the conservative stereotypes of his era, according to neighbors and family friends, lending unswerving support to the women in his family, especially Harris mother, Shyamala Gopalan. She came to America in the late 1950s, young and alone, and made a career as a breast cancer researcher at the University of California, Berkeley, before dying of cancer in 2009.Villagers in Thulasendrapuram remember Shyamala visiting at least once and said that Harris had also stopped in when she was a girl. Her name is inscribed on a board at the main temple; apparently she donated some money, although no one remembered for sure.As soon as the good luck ceremony wrapped up Tuesday, villagers laid out a feast of idli and sambar, South Indian rice cakes with spicy lentil stew. Villagers were adamant that it was a favorite dish of Harris.While Thulasendrapuram clearly leans Democrat in this election, President Donald Trump has a lot of support in India. One man, who died recently, even built a backyard shrine to him.In February, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi hosted a huge welcome party for Trump during an official visit called Namaste, Trump (Hello, Trump).The Indian media has been focused on this election as a referendum on Trump. There have been few stories about Harris and her India connections. Many Indians did not know (nor did many Americans, for that matter) that Harris was of Indian descent until she was put on the ticket.But people in Thulasendrapuram knew.And although Harris family left long ago, with her grandfather eventually moving to Chennai, the village is already planning big things. One villager said the temple was sure to get more donations should Harris win. Another hoped the government would now build a college in this area, something residents have been wishing for for years.Its quite obvious that the village people are hoping that once she wins this election she will do us some favors, said R.R. Kalidas Vandayar, an elder. We are hoping the prayers work. The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

It requires a habit of giving importance to details. Mindful eating during festivals sounds like a task, but it can be practised with awareness towards what and how much we eat. As they say, its all in the mind  mindful eating is all about the choices we make.This year, as we have been struggling to overcome the global pandemic, many of us have been bingeing  it could be screen and gadgets or even food and drinking. This gluttony is the opposite of what we are meant to achieve as human beings. The festive season has already been ushered in with Eid and Navratri just getting over and Diwali around the corner. Food, caring and sharing is the idea of a festival. But all we need is to eat mindfully, cherish every bit of it and have gratitude. Soon we shall realise that less is more.Heres how:We have to achieve a healthy relationship with our food. It should not be your focus when you visit a friend. Savour the other aspects of a festival, like decor, fashion, games and relationships, equally. Pick some healthy substitutes for your sweet tooth. The market is full of a smorgasbord of sweets but the choice you make will determine your wellness. Home cooking over outside food is more wholesome. One could do a high-fat low-carb recipe replacing sugar with stevia, like a keto almond phirni or even coconut laddoos made in jaggery, dry fruits and nuts.These high energy balls or bars could replace high on sugar recipes, like rabdi. Air frying, roasting, grilling and barbecuing could add to the fun as the whole family gets involved in the process and frying could take a back seat. Missi rotis, buckwheat and ragi pancakes and lentil dosas could be substituted for pakoras, cutlets, puris and malpua.Many a times, we just load ourselves with food while hardly paying attention as we talk or play cards. We dont pay heed to how much our body requires. We must train our mind to eat less, taste every delicacy, and appreciate the effort of the host. Reduce your portions and avoid second helpings. You could eat everything if your portions are in control.Eat a small meal before you head out for a house party. It will save you from over-eating.Stay hydrated and drink a lot of infused water or lemon water throughout the day to avoid any dehydration, which results in low energy and headaches. Your brain could confuse this for hunger pangs.A sundowner is a better time to have your guests over. It avoids late night indulgences. Mindful eating can help your mind holds its reins over your senses. You can have a wholesome festive season with a bit of it all. Who knows, you might even find your plate full.(The author is a lifestyle blogger and social media influencer)",MASUR DAL

Make a paratha with it.Perhaps one of the best options left is to go for a leftover makeover. Leftovers are a reality in any kitchen and all of us would have tried to transform them with a few makeovers. Those looking for more options may find #loveyourleftover on Instagram a useful hashtag to follow. So widespread is the leftover makeover habit, that it finds place in some standup comedy acts too.Rice for instance, is very popular for its many makeover avatars; simple steamed rice is easily consumed in the form of pulihora, vegetarian or non-vegetarian fried rice, baath, appam, snacks, sweets and more. Leftover rice also finds a mention in Australian chef Kylie Kwongs recipes. During summer in some parts of India, leftover rice, is left to ferment overnight and consumed the next morning with a choice of sides.During the lockdown, when actor Sameera Reddy along with her mother-in-law Manjri Varde showed a quick recipe of rotla made with leftover rice, it garnered over five million views on Instagram. In her messy mama series, Sameera admitted that unlike others, she had nothing fancy to show for her cooking skills. She adds, But I have the rotla from leftover rice. The video was appreciated because of the simplicity of the dish and the fact that it required no extra ordinary culinary skills. All one has to do is soak leftover rice in some curd, add chopped chillies, onions, coriander leaves and chilli powder, then add some flour and make it into a soft dough, roll it into a shapeless roti, drizzle some oil, cook until crisp.Raipur-based food photographer and author of My Indian Kitchen Swayampurna Mishra however, likes to give her leftover rice a fancy twist. She loves making something like arancini. She says, Arancini is made with leftover risotto. However I do something similar with basmati rice instead of arborio, because, lets face it, no one makes risotto enough to have leftovers. I add some spices to the rice, which is slightly overcooked. Then add paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, oregano and salt and cracked black pepper. I also make a filling with sun-dried tomato pesto or roasted red bell pepper pure. To make them, wet your hands and spread a spoonful of the rice-spice mix, add a little cream cheese or mozzarella, add the filling (make it slightly spicy for a real flavour bomb), add a bit more rice on top and shape into balls. Once this is done, dip them in egg (beaten, of course), coat with fine breadcrumbs (I use only panko breadcrumbs, but grind it a bit for a finer texture). Add seasoning to the crumbs before rolling in the rice balls. Fry in oil, remove, drain on kitchen napkin and serve immediately with your choice of condiment.Deep Fried Mushroom Risotto Balls with Fresh Italian Parsley and Parmesan Cheese-Photographed on Hasselblad H1-22mb CameraHowever, Swayampurnas go-to leftover makeover recipe is the matar (peas) paratha. She says It is easy and my absolute favourite.Mumbai-based blogger Kalyan Karmakar, in one of his blogposts, mentions how he repurposed leftovers from the fridge into spectacular dishes during the lockdown. He also says #loveyourleftover has been his anthem during this time. I love using leftover kebabs to make kathi rolls for breakfast. I made a truly epiphanic lunch with orange emulsion that accompanied a dish  an almond and coriander-crusted John Dory  I had ordered from the Trident BKC. I had a feeling that it would go well with offal. I took out some chicken liver from the freezer, thawed it and tossed it in a pan with sliced onions, green capsicum salt and pepper in olive oil. I added a bit of the orange emulsion to the sauteed chicken liver at the end before turning off the flame. Any longer and it would get burnt and bitter. I drizzled in a bit more of the orange emulsion on the plate before serving it with grilled sourdough bread.He adds, Later a reader, Rahul Jha, DM-ed me on Instagram saying that Heston Blumenthal apparently has a dish called meat meets fruit, which also involves liver, orange and sourdough.The trick with dalDid you know that leftover dal can be used to knead flour and the resultant rotis or parathas turn out soft, fluffy and tasty? Hyderabad-based home baker Arundati Rao often mentions this during her cooking classes. She says plain leftover dal made with red lentil and tuvar is best to knead flour with. Alternatively, if there is too much left over, add chopped onions, chillies and spices to turn your dal into a dhaba-style dal tadka.Kalyan also alters gravy from chicken curry by adding boiled eggs and turning it into egg curry. A similar taste, but a whole new dish to tuck in to.",MASUR DAL

Overall acreage of all Rabi crops put together recorded an increase of nearly 10% as on Friday compared to the corresponding period last year.The new MSPs of pulses (lentil and gram) and oilseeds (rapeseed/mustard) had got higher hike (both in percentage and Rs per quintal terms) compared to the major Rabi crop wheat. So if we look at the current acreage, lentil and gram reported an increase of 30% each while mustard/rapeseed witnessed an increase of 9% -- much higher than wheat which recorded less than 1% of increase in its acreage.Sown area figures, released by the agriculture ministry on Friday, show that all Rabi crops have collectively been sown on 265 lakh hectares of area against 241 lakh hectares area during corresponding period in 2019  an increase of 24 lakh hectares (10%).Increase in acreage of Rabi crops shows that the farmers have been quite enthusiastic about the governments reform measures. Additional attention to the farm sector during the Covid-19 situation resulted in better harvest and procurement of last Rabi crops and subsequent record acreage of Kharif crops, said Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar.The acreage of wheat will certainly increase during remaining sowing period of the season, but the percentage increase at this juncture shows that the farmers have increasingly been opting for pulses (lentil and gram) and oilseeds (mustard and safflower ) which, by virtue of MSP hike, may give them better return.Data shows that the pulses (83 lakh hectares) scored over all other Rabi crops in terms of recording percentage increase in their acreage. Overall, acreage of pulses recorded an increase of 28% followed by coarse cereals and oilseeds.Higher area under pulses is reported from Madhya Pradesh (7.23 lakh ha), Maharashtra (4.61 lakh ha), Uttar Pradesh (2.29 lakh ha), Gujarat (2.27 lakh ha), Rajasthan (1.25 lakh ha), Karnataka (0.59 lakh ha), Chhattisgarh (0.58 lakh ha), Jharkhand (0.27 lakh ha), Assam (0.22 lakh ha), Telangana (0.22 lakh ha), West Bengal (0.14 lakh ha), Odisha (0.08 lakh ha) and Uttarakhand (0.02 lakh ha).Though wheat occupied the maximum acreage at 97 lakh hectares, its increase is marginal over corresponding sown area of last year if we look at all-India figures. Traditional wheat growing areas in Madhya Pradesh, Punjab and UP have, however, continued to move towards this major Rabi crop whose procurement had never been an issues in these states.Officials believe that the fast-paced ongoing procurement operations of Kharif crops has also given the farmers confidence. Announcement of new MSPs much ahead of the Rabi sowing season too seemed to have worked well. Higher hike in MSPs of pulses and oilseeds was aimed at diversification so that farmers may go for these crops in place of wheat, and get better return and help India reduce its import bills, said an official.As far as ongoing Kharif procurement is concerned, the government agencies continue to procure paddy in Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Telangana, Uttarakhand, Tamil Nadu, Chandigarh, Jammu & Kashmir, Kerala, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, Odisha and Maharashtra with purchase of over 292 lakh metric tonnes (LMT) of paddy up to Thursday against the last year corresponding purchase of 247 LMT showing an increase of nearly 18% over last year.Out of the total purchase of 292 LMT, Punjab alone has contributed 200 LMT which is 68% of total procurement.Similarly, based on proposal from the states, approval has already been given for procurement of 45.10 LMT of Pulse and Oilseeds of Kharif Marketing Season 2020 for Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Telangana, Gujarat, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Odisha, Rajasthan and Andhra Pradesh under Price Support Scheme (PSS).The government through its nodal agencies has procured 63625.68 MT of Moong, Urad, Groundnut Pods and Soyabean having MSP value of Rs 344.35 crores benefitting 36988 farmers in Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Haryana and Rajasthan as against the last year corresponding purchase of 48969.24 MT which is an increase of nearly 30% for pulses and oilseeds.These uninterrupted procurements of summer sown crops have also given confidence to farmers about future procurement mechanism. Besides, adequate water storage in reservoirs across the country due to good monsoon this year has also played its role in fast-paced Rabi sowing operations, said the official.",MASUR DAL

98,98.0,,,2020-12-06,https://www.hindustantimes.com/brunch/eat-up-for-good-health/story-RALdCqhg4rJnSTXn5k0dxO.html,"brunchUpdated: Dec 06, 2020, 07:14 ISTFood is one of the most useful tools to inhibit disease, and a strong body begins with a fit immune system. Which is why, given the unhealthy climate that exists because of the pandemic, we asked five top chefs to share their thoughts on immunity-boosting ingredients and the recipes that use them.Chef Joan-RocaChef-Owner of the three-Michelin star El Celler de Can Roca, Girona, SpainFavourite immunity-boosting recipe: Oyster Ying-YangWhy? In Mediterranean gastronomy, garlic is a good natural antibiotic. Catalan cuisines typical homemade aioli sauce is an emulsion made of raw garlic, salt and olive oil. We use it with fish, charcoaled meats and greens. From Andalusian culture, we have a wonderful cold soup named ajoblanco made of garlic, tender fresh almonds, vinegar, extra virgin olive oil and salt.At El Celler de Can Roca, garlic is present in one of our dishes, the Ying-Yang Oyster, based on two sauces, the cold ajoblanco, and a hot cream made of fermented black garlic.Nutritionists notes: Apart from immunity-boosting garlic, Oysters too are loaded with zinc, the gatekeeper of immunity. This recipe is a combination of powerful antioxidants and anti-inflammatory agents, including Omega-3, selenium and Vitamin E.Recipe: Oyster Ying-YangServes 4Ingredients and method:For oysters:4 oysters500g sea waterOpen oysters with a paring knife and remove them from their shells carefully. Cut the beard off with a paring knife and blanch oysters in boiling sea water for 15 seconds. Remove them from the water and place them on a baking sheet to blast chill. Reserve.For black garlic sauce (yields 550g):250g peeled almonds500g of water7.5g Sherry vinegar12.5g extra virgin olive oil3 black garlic cloves3.75g salt20g squid inkCrush the peeled almonds with water and leave to stand for 24 hours refrigerated. Run through a cloth filter, applying pressure to squeeze out as much water as possible. Mix it with the remaining ingredients, blend, and strain and keep the resulting sauce very cool until serving.For white garlic shots (yields 700g):250g almond paste250g water1/2 garlic clove166.5g water15g Sherry vinegar20g extra virgin olive oilSalt3 gelatine sheetsHydrate almond paste for 12 hours with 250g water. Cut the garlic clove in half and remove the germ if necessary. Mix all the ingredients except for the gelatine and blend in the Thermomix. Separate a third of the mixture, heat it while keeping it below 35C/95F and dilute gelatine sheets, previously hydrated. Add in the remaining mixture and transfer it into a squeeze bottle. Let drops of the mixture fall into a container with liquid nitrogen to make frozen spheres; remove with a strainer and reserve in a container in the freezer until serving.Oyster sauce (yields 550g):10 oysters50g shallot5g butter35g oyster water20g oyster sauce625g creamSaltOpen the oysters and reserve their water. Julienne the shallot finely and toss in butter with a pinch of salt over very low heat until it cooks well. Add the oysters and sear them on both sides to brown them lightly; use the oyster water to deglaze, add the oyster sauce, cook for one minute and add cream. Simmer the mixture on very low heat for five minutes, remove and place in Thermomix. Blend the mixture and run it through a fine chinoise. Reserve in a bain-marie at 65C/149F.Garnishing and plating: Cut in half the oysters and, using a paring knife, cut a small base at the tip of each oyster, so that they stand on the plate. On a small soup dish, set one spoonful of very cold black garlic sauce on one side and white garlic shots on top of it, as well as half a cold oyster. On the opposite side, with both sauces touching but not mixing, arrange the hot oyster sauce and the other half oyster, previously heated slightly. This way, a play with cold and hot temperatures is created with both the oysters and the sauces.Chef Srijit Girija GopinathChef at the two-Michelin star Campton Place, and chef owner of Ettan, San FranciscoFavourite immunity-boosting recipe: RasamFor chef Srijit Girija Gopinath, rasam works bestWhy? The key to consumption is to eat what is available locally and what is in season. There is a reason why nature delivers it at a certain time of the year. Indian cuisine is blessed with several immunity-promoting ingredients baked into our recipes already. There is curcumin in turmeric, gingerol and capsaicin in ginger, allicin (sulphur) in garlic, Vitamin C-rich citrus fruits like grapefruit, lemon, lime, tangerine and so on. When it comes to immunity-boosting dishes, though the idea of immunity boosting was never a question then, rasam was part of everyday life. Perhaps thats one of the reasons why we seldom fell sick those days. Today, I love making variations of rasams, with chicken, fish bones, lamb trotters and crab when in season. A good half a dozen ingredients in our humble rasam are today celebrated in the Western world for their immunity-boosting qualities.Nutritionists notes: The star ingredient for an immunity-boosting effect here is tomatoes, which are loaded with a strong antioxidant called lycopene that reduces oxidative stress and enhances immune response. Rasam brings added benefits with anti microbial spices such as cumin, turmeric and ginger.Recipe: Chicken rasamServes 3-4Ingredients:For chicken rasam base3 tbsp groundnut oil300g chicken thighs/ legs with bone (cut in to one-inch pieces)2 tomatoes (medium-size, diced)3 pods garlic (crushed with skin)6 cilantro stems (crushed)1/2 tsp chilli powder1/2 tsp turmeric powderSprig of curry leaves3 tbsp moong dal (soaked)2 tbsp tamarind pulp1 litre of water approx.SaltRasam spice blend1/2 tsp cumin seeds1/4 tsp fenugreek seeds1 tsp fennel seeds1 tsp pepper corn2-3 small red chillies (torn)2 garlic cloves1 tsp urad lentil6 curry leaves1 pinch asafoetidaFor tempering3tbsp sesame oil1 tsp mustard2 shallots, sliced thin1/2 tsp cumin seeds2 cardamoms, crushed3 cloves-inch piece of cinnamon1/2 tsp black pepper, crushed1 tbsp coriander leaves, choppedMethod:Wash the moong dal and add half the water and cook it until soft. Keep it aside. Heat groundnut oil in a pan and add garlic, curry leaves, turmeric and chilli powder, cook for three minutes and add tomatoes and cook until soft.Now add the chicken and sauce for five minutes on high heat. Add cilantro stems, tamarind nectar and moong bean along with water. Add more water if required. Pinch of salt. Let it simmer until chicken is 90 per cent cooked. Now, roast the rasam spice ingredients in a tsp of oil (add asafoetida after the whole spices are roasted). Blend it all together and add it to the simmering chicken rasam base. Continue cooking the chicken until fully cooked. Adjust the seasoning and turn the heat off after adding rasam spice blend simmer for not more than 12-15 minutes.For tempering, add sesame oil and bring it almost to smoke, add mustard and let it splutter. Add all the whole spices and cook it for two minutes and then shallots until light brown. Once again adjust the seasoning, add the coriander leaves and enjoy it out of the pot or strain it and have the broth alone. I prefer to have with chicken and other vegetablesChef Atul KochharChef, restaurateur & entrepreneurFavourite immunity- boosting recipe:Lasooni dalFor chef Atul, this easy recipe from Punjab is what works bestWhy? In Indian vegetarian families, lentil dishes are the main focus of the meal, replacing the meat. This is an easy recipe from Punjab, with a pronounced garlic flavour. Garlic has been part of Indian diet since times immemorial. It boosts immunity and is known to help kill cancer cells, especially colon cancer. Benefits come from raw and cooked garlic  not supplements. Its known to work as an anti-inflammatory, especially as a rub for inflamed joints and muscles. Garlic improves cardiovascular health, it gives better hair and skin and protects your food. When wild garlic is in season, chop the leaves and add at the end for an extra garlic hit, as well as for the colour.Nutritionists notes: Lentils are a good source of zinc and Vitamin B6 that help support our immune system. Allicin is the magic component that gives garlic its immunity-boosting properties. However, to unlock benefits of garlic, crush, mince or chop it and keep away from heat for about 10 minutes before cooking.Recipe: Lasooni dalServes 44 garlic cloves1 small thin green chilli200g split yellow moong dal2 teaspoons ground turmericSeveral sprigs of fresh corianderSea saltFor the tadka4 garlic cloves1 tomato onion2 tablespoons rapeseed or vegetable oil1 teaspoon cumin seeds2 teaspoons ground coriander teaspoon red chilli powder, or to taste teaspoon garam masalaMethod:Bring 750ml of water to the boil in a large covered saucepan and assemble all the ingredients and other equipment before you begin. You also need a sieve and a saut or frying pan. Peel and finely chop the garlic cloves. Remove the stalk from the green chilli, if necessary, and split the chilli lengthways, but leave it whole. Rinse the lentils in the sieve with cold water, then add them to the boiling water and stir in the garlic, green chilli and turmeric. Return the water to the boil, then boil the lentils, uncovered, for 15 minutes, or until they are tender. When the lentils are tender, stir in extra water if they are too dry for you. Meanwhile, to make the tarka, peel and finely chop the garlic cloves. Finely chop the tomato. Peel and finely chop the onion. Heat the rapeseed oil over a medium-high heat in the pan. Add the garlic and cumin seeds and stir until the seeds crackle. Add the onion with a pinch of salt and continue to stir until the onion is lightly browned. Add the ground coriander, chilli powder and garam masala, and stir for 30 seconds to cook the spices. Watch closely so they do not burn. Stir in the tomatoes, lower the heat and continue stirring until they soften and break down, pressing down with your spoon or spatula. Stir the tarka mixture into the lentils and bring to the boil.Just before serving, rinse and finely chop the coriander sprigs. Stir half the chopped coriander into the lentils, then adjust the seasoning with salt, if necessary. Sprinkle over the remaining chopped coriander.Chef Ranveer BrarChef & television hostFavourite immunity-boosting recipe:Ashwagandha-Amla- Hibiscus Iced TeaChef Ranveer Brar picks traditional ingredients as reliable immunity boostersWhy? I believe that our traditional ingredients and our traditional food medicine have enough power to heal and make us resilient. I have spent most of the lockdown trying to research five immunity building ingredients in our food: peepramul, ashwagandha, turmeric, amla and mulethi. Ashwagandha, also called the Indian ginseng, is an ancient medicinal herb. Its known to help reduce stress levels and keep depression at bay. Hibiscus has natural antioxidants and is good for the heart. And amla is packed with Vitamin C and is a natural diuretic.Nutritionists Notes:An all-rounder that can support various features of the immune response. Mulethi keeps the respiratory tract healthy; peepramul acts as a natural pain reliever; ashwagandha, a potent adaptogen, reduces stress and improves the bodys defence system through cell-mediated immunity; turmeric is popularly known for bringing inflammation down, and amla is an excellent storehouse of Vitamin C.Recipe: Hibiscus teaServes 2Ingredients:For immunity tea masala2 tbsp mulethi Powder1 tsp ashwagandha Powder tsp peepli Powder1 pinch turmeric1 tbsp amla JuiceFor Tea2 cup water2-4 large dry hibiscus petals2 tbsp. Honey tsp immunity tea masalaA few mint leaves1 tsp lime juiceMethodOn medium heat, place water in a saucepan and bring it to boil. Turn off the heat. Now add dried hibiscus petals, immunity tea masala, mint leaves and keep for five minutes or more. Pour hot hibiscus tea it in a glass, mix in honey, lime juice and enjoy. Alternatively, let the tea cool down to room temperature and serve.Chef Nelly RobinsonChef-Owner, Nel, Sydney, AustraliaFavourite immunity-boosting recipe:Green Pea Vellouti with Cured Ham and Fresh PeaChef Nelly Robinson believes in the immunity-boosting qualities of green peasWhy? At Nel, we use a lot of ingredients like citrus, ginger and garlic that are very good for your immune system, but one of my favourites is a green pea vellouti with cured ham and fresh pea. Green pea has Vitamin C, which is good for fighting viruses and good for the immune system.Nutritionists Notes: Green peas are packed with Vitamin C, antioxidants and flavonoids that help build strong immunity. As a good source of fibre, peas help support gut health, which is closely related to a well-built immune system.Recipe: Pea and Ham SoupServes 10Ingredients:For the pork hock terrine2 Raw ham hocks3 bunches coriander root4 garlic cloves4 shallots50g ginger3 carrots1 stick celery1 leekPeppercornsStar aniseJuniperFennel seed4 gold leaf gelatineMethod:Place in a pot the ham hocks, coriander, shallot, ginger, carrots, celery, leek, peppercorns, star anise, juniper, fennel seeds in a pot and fill with water, bring to boil and simmer for four to five hours until the meat falls off the bone, drain and strain the stock and reduce, while the stock is reducing pick the meat off the hock and place in a bowl. Soak the gelatine and melt in the stock, add to the meat a little at a time and mix, place in gastro trays and press overnight. Once set, dice into 2cm cubes and breadcrumb.Pea SoupIngredients:1kg frozen peas2 onions100g butter3 cloves garlic400ml chicken stock500g fresh peasPick pea shootsToasted buckwheat/sesame mixMethod:In a pot place the butter on a low heat, add the sliced onion, garlic and sweat for three-four minutes, add the stock.

(Representational Image)Citing the newly enacted farm laws, Khoja Traders, a trader firm in Dewas owned by brothers Pavan Khoja and Suresh Khoja, duped 22 farmers in Harda district of their 2,581 quintals of lentil and gram produce worth nearly Rs 2 crore.The 22 farmers first tried to locate the trader by knocking at Dewas mandi since the Khoja brothers had shown them the trading licence registered by the mandi. But they realised that the duo had cancelled the registration within three months of it being issued by the mandi last year.They went to the residence of the Khojas in Khategaon tehsil but could not find them. Finally, the farmers filed an FIR with the Khategaon police and also submitted a written complaint to the Sub-Divisional Magistrate of Khategaon.The incident assumes significance since it touches upon two critical aspects of The Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020  registration of traders in private markets and dispute resolution.Under Section 6 of the Act, the SDM is authorised to resolve any dispute arising between a farmer and a trader. This has run afoul with farmers who fear that without recourse to courts they would be left with no choice but to accept the settlement awarded by a Conciliation Board constituted by the SDM.Protesting farmers have also demanded that traders cannot be allowed to purchase produce merely on the basis of their PAN cards in private markets. They have demanded trader registration in private markets as well.In a written and signed complaint submitted to the SDM on December 26, the 22 farmers said, Pavan and Suresh Khoja came to us on different days and purchased our produce showing their registered license assuring us that money will be credited into our account. But when that didnt happened, we approached the Khategaon Mandi and realised they are no longer registered. We would request you to help get us the money of our produce.The farmers have addressed the application to the Chief Minister and the Agriculture Minister too.When contacted, Dewas District Collector Chandramauli Shukla told The Indian Express, The matter was brought to my notice today afternoon. We have formed special teams with help from the police to track the trader and get the farmers their dues. We hope to track him (Khoja) soon.Kanhaiya Patel, one of the farmers from Harda district who was also cheated told The Indian Express that at least 100-150 more farmers spread across four districts of Hoshangabad, Sehore, Harda and Dewas, have been duped.It is only after the cheque issued to the farmers by the trader bounced that they realised the fraud. Anand Jat, a farmer from Alanpur village in Harda district, said Pavan Khoja approached him with a proposal to purchase the produce and told him that after the enactment of the farm laws, the government had mandated traders to directly deal with the farmers.Khoja offered Rs 700 more than the running mandi rate, and gave him a cheque. He sold about 90 quintal of lentils worth nearly Rs 5.5 lakh, but the cheque bounced.The latest case in Harda  the constituency of Cabinet minister of Agriculture Kamal Patel  is the eight such reported in Madhya Pradesh since the farm laws came into force. The earlier cases include: 71 farmers cheated in Seoni, 61 in Hoshangabad, 24 in Gwalior, 13 in Guna, eight in Balaghat, and one each in Barwani and Jabalpur. Of these three have been resolved.Much like Anand Jat, another farmer Rahul Patel was also convinced by Suresh Khoja. Patel sold 276 quintals of lentils and gram worth Rs 20 lakh. The cheque issued to him also bounced. It wasnt so much the extra profit of Rs 100 but the cost of transport to take the produce to the mandi which prompted me to sell the produce to Khoja. But now I am stuck, he said.Kanhaiya Patel, who has been cheated of Rs 22.5 lakh, said he was assured an RTGS payment in two days but that did not happen. He said many farmers from Khategaon tehsil too have similar complaints against Khoja traders. We believe that there are at least 100-150 odd farmers, and the total amount involved is about Rs 5 crore, he said.Dewas District Collector Shukla said since the farmers were spread over many districts, he would coordinate with others in the probe.",MASUR DAL

The scrub is good for removing dead skin.Mira also shared her go-to DIY facial routine  first, she applies lemon juice on her face. After removing it, she applies a mask made with besan (gram flour) and curd. To this mixture, you can also add other ingredients; Mira, for instance, adds orange peel powder, moringa powder, neem powder, and so on. Once the mask is semi-dry, rub your skin gradually to remove it.Following the mask, she puts tomato juice on her face. Cut a tomato and apply it straight on your face. Leave it for another 10-12 minutes and then remove.The facial routine is completed with aloe vera, which has many benefits for the skin. I like to do this once in two weeks because it does take quite a bit of time.Raw milk face packI have seen my mom putting raw milk on her face ever since I can remember. It is her go-to remedyfor sunburn, uneven tan, your skin is feeling dry. Mira explained how her mother takes raw milk in a bowl and dabs it on her face with cotton, a method she follows as well.

The common ingredient in all of them? PepperThere is a drizzle outside when we sit for lunch.On the menu, is ammas milagu kuzhambu (pepper curry) and hot rice. I scoop a heapful of rice on my plate, add a dash of gingelly oil, and two spoonfuls of the curry. The drizzle becomes a steady downpour and by the time I wolf down the rice, there is thunder and a howling wind. But I am prepared to deal with the weather: the curry, a tangy concoction of pepper, pepper, and more pepper, leaves my palate with a mild burning sensation typical to the spice. It keeps me warm on the inside, at least for a while.Come winter and every part of India starts whipping up winter curries specific to the region. In Tamil Nadu, milagu kuzhambu is a seasonal special. During my childhood, my grandmother would serve this curry or pepper rasam with hot rice and appalam during winters, recalls 74-year-old YouTuber Gita Rajamani, who runs the popular channel Agrahara Recipes from her home in Kallidaikurichi, Tirunelveli district. Back then, in Sirkazhi where I grew up, it would sometimes rain for 15 days straight and this curry was a dinnertime staple to keep warm, she adds.During winters, when nights were dark and the stone mortar and pestle kept in the corner of the house was too cold to be held to make idli batter, milagu kuzhambu came to our rescue, says Gita. Made with plenty of tamarind, that Gita says is a natural preservative, the curry would be stored in a stone pot and was good to be had for 15 days. Pepper was the chief spice employed in Tamil cuisine, she points out. Green and red chillies were actually introduced to us by the Portuguese; but now though, we use more chillies.Pepper Rasam from South India which is very common and popular which can be served with steamed rice and ghee.Pepper was used extensively in winter, in curries and rasams. Betel leaves were used to keep lungs healthy during cold weather, points out Gita. I make a rasam with the leaves; once the regular tamarind rasam is done simmering, I place a betel leaf over it, switch off the stove, cover, and let the juice seep into the rasam, she explains adding that she removes the leaf a little later.In western Tamil Nadu, horsegram dal and rasam are winter delicacies and in places such as Coimbatore where the weather generally leans towards the colder side, the lentil is cooked through the year. In my household, we make kollu paruppu (dal) twice a week, especially during winter since the dish is considered heat-inducing, says Dharchana Muruganandam, who grew up in Pollachi. We make rasam with the water the dal has been cooked in; the dish has crushed shallots in it instead of garlic, she explains.Gita says that horsegram can also be incorporated in a thogayal (thick chutney) by grinding the boiled lentil with onions, tomatoes, pepper, and garlic. It goes well with rasam, she says adding that she spent several years in western Tamil Nadu before she got married. Gita recalls a Tamil saying with a laugh: Elachavanukku ellu, koluthavanukku kollu, which translates to: Sesame for the slim man, horsegram for the plump man, because horsegram helps break down fat in the body.Childhood stapleFood blogger Swayampurna Mishra has a treasure trove of lamb memories to fall back on every winter.She says, Im from Odisha, and my mother would make this amazing lamb curry when I was a child. I remember it being made every single Sunday through the winter: it was familiar and spicy and it would warm us right up.Lamb curry | Photo Credit: Swayampurna MishraShe adds that, admittedly, making a child feel warm was not that mean a feat in her childhood home. It doesnt get as cold in Odisha as it does in parts of the North, but I think every person from that part of the country remembers their childhood lamb curry as a winter ritual.Milagu kuzhambu (pepper curry) recipe:Ingredients2 tsp tamarind paste, turmeric to taste, one sprig curry leaves, 5 to 6 red chillies, a pinch of asafoetida, 1 1/2 tsp fenugreek seeds, 1 1/2 tsp cumin seeds, 1 tsp urad dal, 1 1/2 tsp toor dal, 2 tsp coriander seeds, 1 1/2 tsp pepper corns, 1/2 tsp mustard seeds, gingelly oil to saute, salt to taste, jaggery to tasteMethodRoast pepper and coriander seeds, toor and urad dal, and red chillies with two tsp oil. Introduce half a teaspoon fenugreek seeds, cumin, asafoetida, and curry leaves when the pepper corns start to sputter. Turn off the stove. Now, add salt to taste. Once the mixture cools, grind to a fine paste adding a little water. Heat four to five teaspoons of oil in a pan. Add mustard seeds and once they sputter, add half a teaspoon fenugreek seeds, half a teaspoon cumin seeds, a pinch of asafoetida, turmeric powder, the ground paste, tamarind paste, jaggery, and water to get the runny consistency of a curry.

And not just any kind of saag, but a dish of mustard leaves. Winter, as we know in the north, is the time for sarson ka saag  that creamy dish that so delightfully complements makkey ki roti  or rotis prepared with maize.I studied the menus of the little eateries in and around my neighbourhood to see if anyone was known for its saag and roti. Turned out there was one, Baa Bistro, which had the dish on the menu, along with a Rajasthani thhali. I am fond of Rajasthani food, and gattey ki sabzi  a spicy dish of lentil cakes in gravy  is a particular favourite. So I licked my chops and got ready to place my order.Life is full of little disappointments: It was a rainy night, the delivery agents had called it a day, and I was told that I was not going to get my saag and roti. But, quite like a good hound, once I am on the trail of something, I dont give up easily. I went back to my research, and zeroed in on an old favourite: a small restaurant called SinglaSweets which had fed me little hillocks of bedmi sabzi in kinder times. Singla had sarson ka saag and makkey ki roti, and was delivering (Ph: 9697828888, 011-22232323).The food arrived. And it was so good that I called the owner of the shop to find out about the fare. The trick in the greens was that it was simply cooked  it had neither onions, nor garlic or ginger. It merely had a tempering of ghee and whole red chillies. The roti, again, was surprisingly soft. It was not soaked in ghee, but was nicely moist.I dipped a piece into the saag and popped it into my mouth, and went back to my village, where this was a regular part of our winter fare. I grew up on various kinds of rotis, prepared with millet, maize and gram. There were all kinds of greens too: mustard, fenugreek, and bathua, to name just a few. In the village, of course, a dollop of white butter went on top of the rotis, while the saag was topped with large quantities of ghee. Bliss.Wed also ordered a plate of malai kofta, and that was a rich concoction of cashew, cream, and paneer. But the saag was what the doctor had ordered (without the ghee of course).It rained the next day again, and the heart called out for more saag and roti. I rang up Baa Bistro (9911214567, 9930983076), and found it open.I ordered the saag-roti combo, and the Rajasthani thhali for lunch. The saag was spicy but tasty, and the rotis were thick and firm, the way most makkey ki rotis are. I enjoyed the Rajasthani dishes  especially the hot gattey and the equally spicy mangori-papad ki sabzi. There was a gulab jamun, too, which we shared.On a cold winters day, saag and roti warm up the heart. And a hot and squishy gulab jamun is like the icing  or rather the warm syrup  on top.The writer is a seasoned food critic",MASUR DAL

In this age of instant gratification it can be either a frustrating or a humbling experience to know that your chances of seeing the tiger are pretty much random. Which way you take it depends on who you are as a person.At the invitation of Taj Safaris, we were investigating the reported return of the tiger to Panna National Park in Madhya Pradesh. Panna had lost all its tigers to poaching by 2009 and it is only in the last decade through a careful process of relocation from other tiger reserves and natural breeding that the tiger population has climbed back to about 50. Leopards that had taken over the role of apex predator following the disappearance of the tiger can still be found, though in diminished numbers.Travel Notes Taj Safaris Pashangarh (Madhya Pradesh) is a one hour drive from the nearest airport in Khajuraho. Besides spending a day visiting the world famous temples of Khajuraho, you can also take a two-hour drive to visit Kalinjar, which is a fortress-city containing several temples dating as far back as the Gupta dynasty of the 3rd-5th Centuries.Creatures of the wildThe Pashangarh (stone fortress) property is the smallest of the six luxury safari lodges that Taj runs in India and Nepal. My photographer friend and I were ushered into our rooms done up in muted browns and greys. The floor-to-ceiling windows looked right out at the thick forest beyond. Attached was a sit-out with a fireplace, presided by a bemused grey langur.The safari trail at Panna National Park | Photo Credit: Sundeep KumarAt night, we head out on a safari. As we bumped along the rough forest trail, the headlight beams of the jeep picked out a few stray deer, eyes smouldering like lumps of charcoal on an otherwise still forest. We stopped at a watering hole to admire the blanket of stars covering the open sky as a fiery orange moon climbed out of the trees. No tiger sighting, but we returned to a sumptuous dinner of lentil and coconut soup followed by grilled chicken in wine sauce served on a stone deck overlooking the forest.For the next few days we played Find-The-Tiger, entering through both the Madla and Hinouta gates, but the big cat remained elusive. The core area of Panna with 50 tigers covers a total area of 543 square kilometres but it is a common misconception that the chances of spotting the tiger are influenced by the tiger/land ratio. For one, only 20% of the core area is available for humans to explore through safaris. Secondly, tigers are intensely territorial and respect each others patch. What this means is that you are restricted to searching for only a handful of tigers from the large population in the park.We did see plenty of other wild creatures on our drives. Herds of large sambar deer with their rather drab brown coats were upstaged by their nattier cousins, the sleek nilgai and the delicate chital (spotted deer). Wild boar snuffled along on either side of the trail, eyes darting back and forth, snouts and tails twitching warily. The most entertaining were the grey langurs swinging impossibly from one flimsy branch to another. We came across a troop of them brawling with mock ferocity; the young ones hurled themselves at their older brothers, giving as good as they got.One morning, we went for a walk with the Pardhi, a nomadic tribe of hunter/poachers who are now working as guides for the Taj Safaris. They showed us how to use the bark of trees and the leaves of plants like the lantana, amla and tulsi for medicinal purposes and also pointed out the faint tracks of hyenas and leopards on the dusty trail. The Pardhi are adept at imitating the warning and mating calls of jungle creatures. Their authentic shrill cries caused a red pheasant to waddle up through the undergrowth to see what the fuss was all about, before, of course, beating a hasty retreat.Sense the beastThe closest we came to feeling the presence of 141, the tigress that ruled in this part of the park, was on our last drive. The nomenclature indicates that she is the first-born of the fourth litter of the first tigress to be introduced to Panna.In a stroke of absolute beginners luck, a couple spotted her down by the Karnali River within minutes of their first drive out. The rest of us were alerted quickly to the fact that she had bounded up into the jungle followed by her two cubs. Her overnight kill of a fresh sambar had been dragged into the Karnali by marauding crocodiles.Crocodile, the apex predator in the waters at Panna | Photo Credit: Sundeep KumarWe scrambled into a wooden boat and set off in search of the kill. Here, the Karnali was smooth as glass with no visible flow except where it dropped suddenly over hidden rocks and foam gushed forth like blood from an open wound. We soon caught sight of the carcass floating mid-stream and being fed upon by a bask of mugger crocodiles, all enjoying the lunch they had mugged from the tigress. Their beady eyes rose from the green waters. Lethal tails with scales packed like armour flicked lazily from side to side  the tigers might rule the land but in the water, the crocodiles were the true apex predators.For details, on stay and rates at Pashangarh visit www.tajsafaris.com.

(Representational)Ahead of elections in four states, prices of urad dal have posed a major concern with supplies being severely constrained at wholesale markets. Traders said the coup in Myanmar has stopped the supply line of imports reaching Indian markets, which would have cooled prices down. On Thursday, the central government announced a 4-lakh tonne import quota of the lentil for the next financial year.Mainly a kharif crop, Indian growers reported 33.38 lakh hectares for the 2020 kharif. Heavy rain towards the end of August, however, adversely affected the chances of a good harvest with Madhya Pradesh  the largest producer of the crop  reporting extensive damage.After a brief slump due to the Covid-19 lockdown led to a demand destruction, wholesale prices of urad crossed government-declared minimum support price (MSP) of Rs 6,000 per quintal across the country.

Farmers said this was a direct effort on part of the government to control pulse price inflation ahead of state elections at the expense of farmers incomes.Lalit Patil Bahal, executive president of Shetkari Sanghatana, claimed this promotion of imports would result in the ongoing farmers movement spreading to other parts of the country.On March 19, the central government had announced its intention of allowing imports of 4 lakh tonnes of tur and 1.5 lakh tonnes of moong for the next fiscal. This was in addition of 2 lakh tonnes of tur to be imported from Mozambique and 4 lakh tonnes of urad, which was announced earlier. India annually imports 10-15 lakh tonnes of pulses, which is a steep fall from the 30-40 lakh tonnes of import the country used to report around five years ago.Traders pointed out how in the previous years, the import quotas were announced towards end of April or early May, with daal millers and processors expected to complete the imports before the domestic arrivals start in the markets. This year, the import quotas have been preponed, which traders said was because of the pulse price inflation noticed in the country. Prices of almost all pulses in the country is now between Rs 100-120 per kg in retail markets.Arrival of urad and moong, both kharif crops, in wholesale mandis is negligible, but farmers continue to bring tur to the mandi. At Laturs wholesale mandi  the largest tur market in the country  around 2,500 quintals of the lentil arrive on a daily basis. As against the government-declared Minimum Support Price (MSP) of Rs 6,000 per quintal, the average trading price of tur at Laturs market is Rs 6,800.Nitin Kalantri, a Latur-based dal miller and trader, pointed out how mandi prices dropped to Rs 6,700 a day after the import quota was announced.

Referring to the ongoing farmers agitation against the three farm laws in the country, Patil Bahal said such trade decisions would result in the movement spreading to other parts of the country.Interestingly, Patil Bahals outfit had earlier supported the laws. Anil Ghanwat, another leader from Shetkari Sanghatana, which was founded by late Sharad Joshi, is part of the three-member body constituted by the Supreme Court to study the laws.Manikrao Kadam, another farmer leader from Maharashtra, pointed out how farmers had taken to growing pulses to make the country self-sufficient in protein.

Subscribe here.)Her initial idea was to bring out a booklet for the community, but the information proved too voluminous. The result of her research has now been published as Classic Cuisine and Celebrations of the Thanjavur Maharashtrians.Culture across the pagesChennai-based Jaishri took up this task after her elder son was employed overseas and younger one joined university. The Thanjavur Maharashtrian diaspora is spread across the globe, and assuming that both my sons would one day leave the country, I wished to preserve our communitys unique cooking traditions and cultural heritage for the next generation, says Jaishri.The book features over 150 recipes, many of which are offered as naivedya (prayer offerings) during festivals, besides everyday dishes and delicacies.As festivals and religious rituals are a quintessential part of Maharashtrian culture, the author has structured the book chronologically, starting with the festival of Gudi Padwa in the month of Chaithra (March/April) and ending with the festival of Shimga Puneva (Holi) that falls in the month of Phalgun (February/March).As the community follows all rituals and celebrates festivals with fervour, I decided to follow this structure, where I mention the festival, talk about the rituals involved, and the dishes associated with a particular celebration, says Jaishri.In the section on Gudi Padwa, she lists staple heritage dishes such as puran poli, chinch bhath (tamarind rice), limbacha bhath (lemon rice), vaangi bhath (brinjal rice), ambode (a deep-fried spicy snack made with dal), pitla (mixed veg and lentil curry cooked in tamarind water), kadi (buttermilk-based curry) and other recipes.Timely evolutionOver three centuries, the Thanjavur Maharashtrians have also created new dishes, influenced by the Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Karnataka cuisines. Pitla and daangar (urad dal flour blended with curd) are typical Thanjavur Maharashtrian dishes, evolved over a period of time.Early migrants also replaced certain ingredients with locally available ones. For example, copra (dried coconut) is widely used in many Maharashtrian dishes, but in our community freshly grated coconut is roasted and then used to get the copra taste, she says.Coriander seeds, cumin and coconut are the dominant spices used in this cuisine.  We use various spice powders toasted in a minimal amount of oil to flavour the dishes.The simplicity of preparation with a good balance of spices is the hallmark of Thanjavur Maharashtrian cuisine, says Jaishri.A classic combination is ambat bhaaji, daangar and kaatracha misiringa (mor molaga Thanjavur style). Ambat bhaaji is a signature dish of our community. This spinach sambar is prepared with a liberal amount of toor dal, spiced with green chillies and seasoned with mustard, dry chillies and fenugreek. In sweets, puran poli, doodh poli and besan ladoo top the list.Methkoot and daangar are typical examples of the protein-rich diet of this diaspora. Methkoot is a powder made using a mix of lentils such as toor, channa, moong and urad. Coriander, cumin and dry ginger are used to flavour this powder, which can be used in multiple ways as an accompaniment or even mixed with curd or tamarind water.The book has been well received by the diaspora, especially the younger generation, and it has also won the Best Vegetarian Cuisine Book in the World Award by Gourmand International for the year 2020, says Jaishri.The book and Kindle versions are available on Amazon.",MASUR DAL

This year, snuggle at home with one such universal favourite  dahi vada, with all its shapes, flavours and toppingsFood in India is decided by season, and the ingredients available in the region one lives in. The festival of colours, Holi is just round the corner and, as the temperature rises, celebrations are incomplete without food that not only tickles your taste-buds, but also cools you down.Rajani Jain, a home chef in Delhi says, What better way than cool dahi vada after spending hours outside playing Holi? The dahi (curd) cools you down and the common urad dal vadas, laced with masalas  cumin, coriander and chat masala powder  bring forth a burst of flavours. I prefer ginger juliennes on it, with anar dana (pomegranate seeds), she adds.A homemade dish of dahi vada | Photo Credit: Prabalika M BorahThere are many such preferences and not restricted to toppings alone. There are variations that give this dish an interesting spin, like vadas made with mixed lentil, moong dal, bread, oats or even with jeera butter cookies. An illustration to go with Tarla Dalals recipe, for instance, suggests vadas can be made with jeera butter cookies, slightly soaked in lukewarm water before dunking them in a pool of seasoned yoghurt. The mixed lentil variety, also called masala vada, consists of chana dal, urad dal and moong dal, all coarsely ground.The tough questionDahi vada is a simple dish, but it can get complicated if the vadas are not soft enough.According to chef Garima Poddar, dahi vadas are unique, because though they are deep fried, they melt in your mouth. She adds: A lot of people get stuck with hard vadas or bhallas. To avoid this, one can soak the fried vadas in water for a few seconds, then squeeze the water out gently by pressing them between ones palms and drop them them in dahi.Having said that, softness need not be an obsession, adds Garima, In Rajasthan, the vadas are made with a slightly coarse paste of lentils, so there is a bite to its texture.Chef Kunal Kapoor suggests that the urad batter be made with less or no water, to get soft vadas. Whisking the batter well, for quite some time, right before frying the vadas will also be helpful, he says.Experimental matchmakingA dahi vada alu dum stall in Cuttack, OdishaStreet food lovers in Cuttack, Odisha have created their own twist to the dahi vada, pairing it with alu dum in a treat exclusive to this city.The now-iconic street food dahi vada and alu dum is a fusion experiment that has clicked very well, says consultant chef Rachit Kirteeman.Homemade dahi vada, by Hina Gujral Ingredients: 1 cup dhuli urad dal (split black gram); 1 chopped green chilli;  inch peeled and grated ginger; A pinch of asafoetida; 4 tbsp water; Salt to taste; Oil for deep frying; Lukewarm water; 2 cups thick yoghurt (curd); 1 tsp chat masala; 1 tsp cumin powder (for curd); 1 tsp cumin powder (for topping);  tsp black salt; 2 tsp sugar; 2 tbsp sweet tamarind chutney; 2 tbsp coriander and mint chutney; 1/2 tsp red chilli powder; 1 tbsp chopped corianderMethod:To make the vada batter, wash and soak dal in water for six hours or overnight. Transfer soaked dal to the grinder with chopped green chillies and grated ginger. Grind dal without using water, stop mixer in between, stir with a spatula and grind again. Keep doing this at regular intervals. If it still does not turn into a smooth paste, add one or two tablespoons of water, then grind. The idea is to use minimum water. Transfer the paste to a large bowl. Add salt, asafoetida and whisk batter briskly for a couple of minutes or till it is light and fluffy.Deep fry the vadas over medium heat by shaping small portions of the batter into flat balls with your fingers (dampened with water), or dropping them into the oil with the help of spoons. Allow them to cook as they fry. They can be turned when they are pale golden from the base and sides. Fry until they become crisp.Soak the vadas in lukewarm water in a wide saucepan. Keep enough space for the vadas to breathe, as they expand in water. Let them soak for about 10 minutes or until soft and drain out excess water from each vada by gently pressing between your palms.To assemble, first take curd in a bowl. Add salt, cumin powder, sugar and chat masala and whisk till smooth. Dilute the curd and season it to taste.Arrange vadas in a serving bowl. Pour the flavoured curd over the vadas, so that it soaks them completely. Top with the green chutney and tamarind chutney. Sprinkle red chilli and cumin powder and chat masala to taste. Garnish dahi vada with chopped coriander leaves. Serve chilled.He elaborates, The Cuttack region of Odisha produces a lot of milk. So instead of letting it go waste, curd was made. Vada is a staple breakfast. Someone who had surplus of both curd and vada mixed it together and added the alu dum as an unusual accompaniment. Dahi vada in Odisha uses diluted curd, so when alu dum is added, it becomes a complete dish.Season to tasteAs for spicing the yoghurt, Garima says, There is no thumb rule to seasoning the dahi. The same applies to its consistency. Some like it thick and creamy, others like it slightly runny. Experiment with what works for your palate on a small quantity of dahi.One of Garimas favourite variations of dahi vada is the South Indian version, which uses a runny curd base.She says, I also enjoy the tempering on it. One can play it up with any seasoning. I have tasted it with a garnish of peri peri masala, and also read about dahi vada with Tabasco sauce.Kunal suggests creative toppings: It is a season of fruits, so there is no harm in adding chopped fruits such as apples, bananas, grapes or even melons to the whisked yoghurt.",MASUR DAL

The restaurant, which boasts a food menu conceived by Michelin-starred Chef Atul Kochhar of Benares, London fame, and executed by Chef Tanvi Goswami, has just introduced an Experience Menu, curated by Kochhar, Available only on Sundays, it is a reflection of SAGAs food philosophy, weaving together the myriad flavours of the country into a nine-course meal that celebrates Indias rich culinary legacies in clean contemporary settings. Speaking of settings, the restaurant itself is stunning, sprawling over three floors and an al fresco area, with the focal point being a bar that towers up through the entire restaurant, requiring mixologists to travel up and down using lifts and pulleys.All of that spectacle is reinforced by some truly stellar cocktails, but more on those later. Going back to the food, Kochhar says, Through this menu we would like to give an experience, which is culturally rich and speaks volume of our heritage and love for food. The menu is brought to life keeping in mind different palates, touching key dishes from our a la carte offerings and also giving unparalleled dining experience. The Chefs Experience menu includes some of the best-selling dishes from the a la carte menu such as Crispy Crab, Ghee Roast Prawn, Sali Murg, Bhuna Mangsho, Edamame and Quinoa, Khari Paneer Tikka along with special dishes created for it, all washed down by a chilled glass of crisp Prosecco and live music by a violinist who traipses through the various floors and mezzanines of the space.Going with the non-vegetarian menu, we are pleased to make the acquaintance of dishes like the aforementioned crab and prawn. The fo rme r comprises a crackling soft shell crab (we recommend downing it in one bite if you have a large enough mouth and or a disdain for decorum), with dollops of saffron-spiked cream and a mustardy catsup, while the latter comes taco style, the Mangalorean prawn dish, scented with fennel and curry leaves, resting on a tortilla shell as delicate as a ballerinas ankles and just as tenacious, gamely managing to contain the shellfish as one wolfs it down.Helping us wash down this surfeit of seafood is the delicious Indo-Negroni, which gives a distinctly desi twist to the classic cocktail with cumin and citrus flavours. Next, we dally with the Himalayan Flavours (a Nepalese-inspi red Roas t Chicken Salad fired up with timur pepper and tart tomatoes) and Lentil Love (comprising slow-cooked lentils fortified with onion and garlic and served in a tart shell which gives the otherwise simple legumes a more complex texture and crumble, making it all the more welcome). We also take a dip in the Lonar Lake, a signature cocktail of SAGA that is a medley of gin, Aperol (an Italian bitter), Orgeat syrup and sparkling wine, perfumed with kaffir lime leaves.Swimming may be out this year but this is definitely something we could dive into again and again. In the interest of brevity, we shall refrain from further details, but suffice it to say that the main courses, which included Sali Murg (Parsi Chicken), Bhuna Mangsho (Bengali style goat mutton) and the Family Affair (a multi-grain khichdi for the whole family to pass around), were each delicious and individual in their own way. For desserts, there is the Petha (an ambrosial cloud of rabadi festooned with orange jelly, winter melon candy and rose) and the Pilgrims Sweet (a platter packed with plum cake, Panchamarat ice-cream, date treacle and wheat halwa). With the menu expected to change seasonally, given Kochhars emphasis of taking cues from nature, diners can keep enjoying new tastes from the country we call home.DETAILSAT: Vatika Atrium, Golf Course Road, Sector 53, GurugramTIMING: Every Sunday, 12:00pm-4:00pm, 7:00pm-11:00pmCOST PER HEAD: Rs 2,995 ++",MASUR DAL

In Keralas street food hubs and cafes, age-old food pairings are being replaced with quirky combinations that demand a leap of faithPuttu with parippu (dal) and duck egg roast at Nairs Puttu Kada at North Paravur | Photo Credit: Balram MenonPuttu with parippuNairs Puttukada (puttu shop) has a very direct title. But if you go in expecting the usual, cylindrical rice cake puttu to be served along with a plate of kadala (black chick peas) curry, pappadom and a banana, as is the unquestionable tradition in Kerala, you would be surprised. At Nairs, the puttu is served along with dry parippu (lentil), a strange bedfellow. A spicy duck-egg roast is also part of the package. Mohanan P Nair, the owner of the 56-year-old tea shop in Chathanad, about eight kilometres from North Paravur in Ernakulam, says he thought up the combo and started serving it over 17 years ago. I wasnt sure. But it clicked, he says, over phone from his home. Now, he has people from faraway places seeking out the dish. The tea shop that usually opens at 4.30 pm is now closed owing to the COVID-19 situation.We are not entirely new to bizarre food pairings. 2020 saw a few of those go viral on social media. Blame it on COVID-19, for nothing else can logically explain chocolate Manchurian, Nutella biryani or chicken tikka chai. Dishes such as the one at Nairs, however, are unusual yet extremely palatable. It seems very peculiar at first. But the combination grows on you, says businessman and vlogger Balram Menon, who used to frequent Nairs shop. The dry lentil brings in the perfect balance between the spice in the duck egg roast and the puttu, he adds.Pazhampori and beef at Sree Muruga Cafe, Tripunithura | Photo Credit: Balram MenonBeef roast with banana frittersOne of the oldest among Keralas odd couplings is the pazhampori (banana fritters) and beef. Sree Muruga Cafe in Tripunithura, Kochi, popularised this rather wacky combination, which is a popular snack today. Started in 1943, the tea shop has always sold pazhampori and beef roast, but it became famous much later, says Sathyan K B, the owner of Sree Muruga. Around 1994, when Malayalam actor Jayasurya was shooting for a television show, he and the crew happened to see someone relishing pazhampori with beef. Word spread quickly and the media made the dish popular, he adds. The combo is one the best selling at Sree Muruga today.TV personality and chef Raj Kalesh says the pairing owes its origin to North Indian lorry drivers, who ordered the sweet pazhampori to balance the spice of the famed Kerala beef roast. Kerala was always known for its beef roast and it gradually became a thing to order pazhampori with it, he says. The fritters too are crispy, fried in rice batter instead of maida, adds Kalesh.Savalavada (onion pakora) with squid or chicken roastAny fried snack works well with any non-vegetarian gravy, says Ashvin George, a traveller and food enthusiast. Salwa, an eatery in Thoppumpady, Kochi, usually does brisk business around 5 am based on just this principle. Its best-selling dish is savalavada (onion pakora) served with squid roast. It is just savalavada usually, but once in a while, there is pazhampori as well. Every morning, they fry up these delicious snacks by 2 am or 3 am for the men who go out to sea. The savalavada is often had with chicken or beef roast as well, adds Ashvin.While the rest of us drool over porotta-beef fry, Ashvin also suggests you have the beef fry with neyyappam (a traditional sweet made of jaggery and rice flour). He tasted this combo at a small hotel in Wayanad, whose owner (whom he refers to as Majeedka), grinds the rice for the neyyappam in the afternoon and makes them in the evening. The beef, prepped as early as 10 am, is cooked slowly through the day, and makes for a soul satisfying match with neyyappam.These are not conventional combinations. It is up to each person, really. Whatever floats your boat, adds Ashvin, whose personal idea of an ultimate breakfast is poori with fried eggs.Aval isthiri at Satheeshan PVs tea stall in Kannur | Photo Credit: Special ArrangementAval isthiri (poha, sev and banana)Satheeshan PVs tea stall at Kannapuram in Kannur does not have a name. But everyone in the locality and across Kerala knows his shop for its aval isthiri (which loosely translates to ironed flattened rice). Satheeshan is not sure how the dish got its name, but he has been serving it since the 1970s. His father came up with the dish, which is something like a Malayali bhel puri  made of aval, sugar, Robusta banana and sev (omapodi).The magic is in the mixing of ingredients, says Satheeshan, whose has seen his father make it back in the day. It is a hot favourite here; simple, healthy and filling, he adds. People from across Kerala have travelled to Kannur to try the dish, says Satheeshan. If you examine it, it is rather simple. But I am not sure what inspired my father to come up with such an unusual dish, adds Satheeshan, who claims he has not made any change to the dish.It is going to be a while before we can eat out again, so but if you are bored of your rice with sambhar, feel free to reach for the cheese in the fridge.",MASUR DAL

In our ancient texts, a balance of six tastes - sweet, sour, salty, pungent, bitter and astringent - has been recommended in everyday eating for optimum health.While sugar and jaggery are the primary sweetening agents in our kitchens, we have also been blessed with an array of natural food souring agents which add that tangy zest to any dish. As summer makes its presence felt, tender tamarind leaves make their appearance which are used extensively in meat preparations in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. The same applies to Gongura leaves which are also enjoyed in the form of pickles and chutneys. Another green leafy vegetable that imparts tartness to pappus and chutneys is Green Sorrel.Commenting on the use of these leaves in Indian kitchens, Chef Sudhir Nair, who is the executive chef in The Westin Hyderabad Mindspace, says: The summer season is believed to be a good time to add these leaves to your food as they keep your body cool. It is also a season when appetite goes down and the tang of these leaves can help bring it back. Gongura, as we know, is used extensively in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. We must note that tamarind and Gongura leaves are used mainly in the preparation of meats that have a strong flavour like mutton. In case of chicken or seafood, the taste of the leaves might overpower the dish.Green Sorrel leaves: They are called Chukka Koora in Telugu and Khatta Palak in northern India. Their appearance is similar to spinach leaves but the leaves are darker and the stems thicker. Apart from being added to lentil recipes, they are also used in salads. Their tartness comes from oxalic acid, the quantity of which becomes higher as the leaves grow. They grow all year round but the peak season is summer.Tamarind leaves: Tamarind is one of the most common souring agents in Indian cuisine, and even its leaves are eaten in a few states. Chugur Dal and Chugur Gosht are relished during summer as this is the time when tender, crunchy tamarind leaves are available. These sour leaves are used in Ayurvedic medicines and Chef Sudhir tells us that they taste swell with potatoes too.Gongura leaves: Known as red sorrel leaves in English, these serrated leaves are extensively used in the two Telugu states, Maharashtra, the north-eastern states and other regions.

But as the countrys economic crisis worsened, she lost her job and watched her savings evaporate. Now she plans to sell her furniture to pay the rent and struggles to afford food, much less electricity or a dentist to fix her 10-year-old daughters broken molar.  For dinner on a recent night, lit by a single cellphone, the family shared thin potato sandwiches donated by a neighbor. The girl chewed gingerly on one side of her mouth to avoid her damaged tooth.  I have no idea how well continue, said Mustafa, 40, at home in Tripoli, Lebanons second-largest city after Beirut.  Lebanon, a small Mediterranean country still haunted by a 15-year civil war that ended in 1990, is in the throes of a financial collapse that the World Bank has said could rank among the worlds worst since the mid-1800s. It is closing like a vise on families whose money has plummeted in value while the cost of nearly everything has skyrocketed.  Since fall 2019, the Lebanese pound has lost 90% of its value, and annual inflation in 2020 was 84.9%. As of June, prices of consumer goods had nearly quadrupled in the previous two years, according to government statistics. The huge explosion one year ago in the port of Beirut, which killed more than 200 people and left a large swath of the capital in shambles, only added to the desperation.  On Wednesday, Lebanon observed a day of mourning to mark the anniversary of the blast, and government offices and most businesses were closed for the occasion. Large crowds gathered around Beirut to commemorate the day and denounce their government, which has failed to determine what caused the explosion and who was responsible, much less to hold anyone accountable.  After a moment of silence on the highway overlooking the port, thousands of protesters marched toward downtown, where some fired fireworks and threw stones near the Parliament at security forces, who responded with volleys of tear gas.  The blast exacerbated the countrys economic crisis, which was long in the making, and there is little relief in sight.  Mourners march in Beirut, Lebanon on Wednesday, Aug. 4, 2021, to commemorate the one-year anniversary of the catastrophic port explosion in Beirut that killed more than 200 people.(Diego Ibarra Sanchez/The New York Times) Mourners march in Beirut, Lebanon on Wednesday, Aug. 4, 2021, to commemorate the one-year anniversary of the catastrophic port explosion in Beirut that killed more than 200 people.(Diego Ibarra Sanchez/The New York Times)  Years of corruption and bad policies have left the state deeply in debt and the central bank unable to keep propping up the currency, as it had for decades, because of a drop in foreign cash flows into the country. Now the bottom has fallen out of the economy, leaving shortages of food, fuel and medicine.  All but the wealthiest Lebanese have cut meat from their diets and wait in long lines to fuel their cars, sweating through sweltering summer nights because of extended power cuts.  The country has long endured electricity shortages, a legacy of a state that has failed to ensure basic services. To cover the gaps left by the state power supply, residents rely on privately owned, diesel-powered generators.  But the currency collapse has undermined that patchwork system.  As imported fuel has gotten more expensive, power cuts from the grid have stretched from a few hours a day to as long as 23 hours. So demand for power from generators has risen, along with the cost of the fuel to run them.  The resulting price hike has turned a utility essential for business, health and comfort into a luxury that many families can afford only in limited quantities, if at all.  Mustafa Nabo, from Syria, used to work long days on his electric sewing machine, powered by the grid and supplemental power from a generator.  Now the price for generated power is nearly 10 times what it was before the crisis began, so he rushes to work as much as he can during the two hours he gets power from the grid. But less work means less money, and he has cut back on food.  It is better to bring food than to pay for electricity, Nabo said.  Across Lebanon, the fuel shortages have led to long lines at gas stations, where drivers wait for hours to buy only a few gallons or none at all if the station runs out.  The supply of medicines has also become unreliable. The state is supposed to subsidize imports, but the crisis has strained that system, too.  Mustafa Nabo, a tailor who fled the Syrian civil war, sits in a darkened apartment in Beirut, July 7, 2021. Nabo used to work long days on his electric sewing machine here, but now must rush to work as much as he can during the two hours he gets power from Lebanons electrical grid.

Nabo used to work long days on his electric sewing machine here, but now must rush to work as much as he can during the two hours he gets power from Lebanons electrical grid. (Bryan Denton/The New York Times)  At a pharmacy in Tripoli, a line stretched from the sidewalk to the cash register, where anxious shoppers sought medicines that are now scarce after long being easy to obtain, such as painkillers and blood pressure medications. Other products had disappeared altogether, such as drugs to treat depression.  One shopper, Wafa Khaled, cursed the government after failing to find insulin for her mother and paying five times as much as she would have two years ago for baby food and seven times as much for formula.  The best thing for us would be for some foreign country to come occupy us so we could have electricity, water and security, she said.  The crisis could do lasting damage to three sectors that have historically made Lebanon stand out in the Arab world.  In a country once billed as the Switzerland of the Middle East, the banks are largely insolvent. Education has suffered a blow as teachers and professors seek better opportunities abroad. And health care has deteriorated as reduced salaries have caused an exodus of doctors and nurses.  The emergency ward at the American University of Beirut Medical Center, among the countrys best, has gone to seven physicians, from 12, and lost more than half of its 65 nurses since July 2020, said Eveline Hitti, the head of the department.  They were driven out by waves of COVID-19, declining salaries and the explosion in the Beirut port last year, which flooded the ward with casualties.  You ask yourself, why should I survive this? said Rima Jabbour, the head nurse.  Now COVID cases are increasing, as are food poisonings caused by poor refrigeration and alcohol overdoses.  The countrys political leaders have failed to slow the economic meltdown.  Officials have hampered the investigation into the port explosion, and a billionaire telecoms tycoon, Najib Mikati, is currently the third politician to try to form a government since the last Cabinet resigned after the blast.

Amid a financial collapse that could rank among the worlds worst since the mid-1800s is closing like a vise on Lebanons middle class. (Bryan Denton/The New York Times)  Mustafa Allouch, the deputy head of the Future Movement, a prominent political party, said, like many other Lebanese, that he feared that the political system, intended to share power between a range of sects, was incapable of addressing the countrys problems.  I dont think it will work anymore, he said. We have to look for another system, but I dont know what it is.  His greatest fear was blind violence born out of desperation and rage.  Looting, shooting, assaults on homes and small shops, he said. Why it hasnt happened by now, I dont know.  The crisis has hit the poor hardest.  Five days a week, scores of people line up for free meals from a charity kitchen in Tripoli, some equipped with cut-off shampoo bottles to carry their food because they cannot afford regular containers.  Robert Ayoub, the projects head, said demand is going up, donations from inside Lebanon are going down and the newcomers represent a new kind of poor: soldiers, bank employees and civil servants whose salaries have lost the bulk of their value.  In line on a recent day were a laborer who had walked an hour from home because he could not afford transportation; a brick layer whose work had dried up; and Dunia Shehadeh, an unemployed housekeeper who picked up a tub of pasta and lentil soup for her husband and three children.  This will hardly be enough for them, she said.  The countrys downward spiral has set off a new wave of migration as Lebanese with foreign passports and marketable skills seek better fortune abroad.  I cant live in this place, and I dont want to live in this place, said Layal Azzam, 39, before catching a flight to Saudi Arabia from Beiruts international airport.  She and her husband had returned to Lebanon from abroad a few years ago and invested $50,000 in a business. But she said that it had failed and that she worried they would struggle to find care if their children got sick.  Theres no electricity. They could cut the water. Prices are high. Even if someone sends you money from abroad, it doesnt last, she said. There are too many crises.",MASUR DAL

Data from the Department of Fertilisers shows DAP stocks at 14.63 lakh tonnes (lt) as on October 31, compared to 44.95 lt and 64 lt for the same day in 2020 and 2019. MOP stock availability was, likewise, down to 7.82 lt, from the corresponding October-end levels of 21.70 lt in 2020 and 21.52 lt in 2019.  The situation isnt as bad in urea and complex fertilisers that contain different combinations of nitrogen (N), phosphorous (P), potash (K) and sulphur (S). October-closing stocks were lower for this year but not at near-crisis levels: 52.90 lt versus 79.76 lt (2020) and 78.95 lt (2019) in urea; and 30.98 lt versus 38.40 lt and 52.13 lt for NPKS complexes.  Farmers mainly plant mustard, potato, garlic, chana (chickpea), masoor (red lentil), matar (green peas), jeera (cumin) and dhaniya (coriander) during October. The peak rabi demand for fertilisers is during November-December, when sowing of wheat and onion happens. The current low stocks raise concerns on that front.  On Monday, however, Union Chemicals and Fertilisers Minister Mansukh Mandaviya termed reports of a shortage as rumours and denied them. Appealing to farmers not to hoard fertilisers, he claimed that 18 lt of DAP will be supplied in November, as against a projected demand of 17 lt. Supply of NPKS fertilisers, at 30 lt, will also surpass the demand of 15 lt for the month.  Interestingly, meanwhile, the official data also reveal higher overall sales of fertilisers in October. The month registered lower retail sales of DAP (13.9 lt against 15.37 lt in October 2020) and MOP (2.5 lt against 2.84 lt). But this was more than offset by increased sales of urea (20.66 lt versus 17.55 lt), NPKS (13.07 lt versus 8.7 lt) and single super phosphate (7.93 lt versus 4.69 lt).  Also Read | How some Punjab farmers are creating bio-enzymes from kinnow  The shortage of material has seemingly forced farmers to replace DAP and MOP, which contain 46% P and 60% K, with fertilisers having less of these nutrients. The latter includes single super phosphate (containing only 16% P and 11% S) and NPKS complexes such as 12:32:16:0, 10:26:26:0 and 20:20:0:13. To what extent the switch to low nutrient-content fertilisers would help meet demand in the coming weeks, however, remains to be seen.  Fertiliser firms have already hiked the retail prices of NPKS complexes like 10:26:26:0 and 12:32:16:0 from Rs 1,175-1,185 to Rs 1,450-1,500 per 50-kg bag.

To save his life, his wife collected all her gold ornaments and gold coins in a heap. She then sang songs and narrated stories to her husband so he doesnt fall asleep. When Yamaraj, the god of death, came in the form of a serpent to take the princes life, he was blinded by the shine of the gold and sat enchanted listening to the melodious music and stories.

It is believed that during this time, the sthir lagna prevails, which means the time is auspicious and the Goddess is likely to stay in your house, as per drikpanchang.com.  The puja preparations entail keeping a red cloth on the right hand side of a raised platform, and installing idols of Lakshmi and Ganesha on it. The idols must be decorated with fine clothes. Next, a white cloth should be placed on the left hand side of the platform for installing the Navgraha gods.  Cereals including wheat, urad dal, moong dal, gram, barley and masoor dal are used along with marigold flowers while performing puja. Small footprints using vermillion and rice flour are made on the entrances to show the joyous arrival of the long-awaited Lakshmi.  In addition, they draw intricate rangoli designs at the entrances of workplaces and houses to welcome the goddess.

The food and civil supplies department has withdrawn the price hike of around 12 essential items in the face of growing protests.  At the same time, local traders pointed out that tomato was being sold at Rs 120 per kg in the retail market, and drumstick at around Rs 200 per kg. The damage caused to standing crops by heavy rain in November has been cited as a major reason for the sky-high prices. Food and Civil Supplies Minister G R Anil told reporters the state government would make the necessary market intervention.  The prices of 12 non-subsidised essential items rose when Supplyco revised the monthly rates based on the wholesale price charged during the time of purchase. The government has scrapped the revised rates that came into effect the other day, considering the misery of the people, Anil said.  The prices of items like green gram, black gram, Bengal gram, red gram, coconut oil, fenugreek, green peas, chickpea, sortex raw rice, matta rice, biryani rice and masoor dal have not been changed. The Supplyco has been selling 13 essential items at subsidised rates through 1,506 retail outlets. No price rise has been effected on these items since April 2016, the minister said.  Further, as many as 35 items have been made available in the open market at a rate up to 50% lower than the market rate, he said. The provision of essential items at subsidised rates and purchasing items from neighbouring states without middlemen would be continued with. The government will not allow anyone to cause a price rise in the market. The online sale and home delivery of items launched by the Supplyco will be made available across the state, he said.  Though the state has been claiming that around 78.5% of the total vegetables required for daily consumption are now being produced domestically, and only 21.5% is sourced from neighbouring states, the prices of a majority of vegetables have witnessed a two to three-fold increase.",MASUR DAL
