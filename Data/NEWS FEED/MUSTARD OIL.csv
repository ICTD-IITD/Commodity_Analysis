My mother, grandmother and aunts would sit out in the afternoon, and hand-embroider home linen, rajai covers, and craft lace. They feel ashamed to gift them to me, but I tell them how I would buy them at an antique market if they did not pass them on. In fact, her latest Autumn-Winter 2020 collection  to be showcased at Lakme Fashion Weeks Sustainability Day On February 13  features hand-painted and embroidered floral and geometric motifs inspired by these heirloom designs.  Going international  Taking off from her show in Telangana last year, she says the new collection is a second run with the States handloom clusters. I have put an international perspective to the textiles and motifs since we will be selling them in Paris and New York, says the designer, who launched The Kurta Collection for Japanese retailer Uniqlos India launch last year.  Loosely-shaped diaphanous dresses, pleated skirts, boxy jackets and oversized pea coats in contemporary shades feature in the collection inspired by Little Womens Jo March. Im a huge fan of the series and Saoirse Ronan (who plays March in Greta Gerwigs film adaptation of the novel), says Singh, talking about how the outfits transform with Marchs character: from being tomboyish (voluminous pants with shorter jackets) to feminine (embroidered tear dresses, wool layering). She has given typical shades like bright fuchsia, blue, mustard etc., a miss, as they usually appeal [only] to the Indian diaspora. She explains how artisans tend to use these vibrant colours as it is what they see around them. To cater to the international market, I have worked with a palette of blues, washed-down browns and mints, translating the craft to make abstract and modern silhouettes that dont reflect traditional ikat patterns, says Singh, adding that Eka is Indias first design house to have worked with The Wool Lab and Italys Rami Riccardo Studio to put together the 2021 forecast book and seasonal sourcing guide.  Yarn it  As for fabrics, Singh has worked with the double and single ikat clusters of Kovalguddam, thigh-reeled Tussar silk from the Mahadevpur cluster, and cotton textiles from Narayanpet. Owing to Telanganas dry climate, she says silk cotton is the primary fabric they work with. The artisans use only spun silk which makes the fabric thick. This is not ideal for the international market, as for dresses and skirts, you need fabrics that drape well. Which is why she felt it was important to change the basic content and yarn. Singh went on to develop silk and cotton blends, changed the yarn construction to make it lighter, and also twisted the yarn before dyeing it.  Rooting for sustainable  In a market scattered with sustainable brands, and issues surrounding fast fashion and greenwashing, how does Singh foresee the future? Sustainability is not just for yesterday and today, it has to be forever. No matter which industry you belong to, you cannot shy away from issues and a hardcore dialogue is necessary. We need to understand there are limited resources and start living frugally. As for the fashion industry, clothes are one of the biggest polluters, so why get people to buy into your created trends that will be out the next season? Instead, we simply need to reinvent our outfits every season, says Singh. (22,000 onwards)  Others on the runway  Work in progress at Shades of India  50,000 crochet flowers @ Shades of India  The celebrated Noida-based textile design house brings a story of crochet in their spring-inspired collection, Crafted in Crochet. Design director and founder, Mandeep Nagi, explains how it took her around six months to conceptualise and create the line of angrakhas, A-line kurtas, pyjamas, dupattas, and delicate saris. Crafted in summer fabrics like silk cotton, soft organdy and tissue, it features over 5,000 metres of lace and 50,000 crochet flowers made by women in Uttar Pradeshs Saharanpur district, says Nagi, adding that the lace features on the collars, cuffs, necklines and borders. Lace crochet flowers and pom poms also make for charming additions. In many pieces, the lace has been embellished with zari and glistening mukaish, traditional silver work from Lucknow.  A creation by Ritu Kumar  Neo origami @ Ritu Kumar  This year, the ace designer has partnered with Austrian fiber brand, Lenzing Ecovero to create outfits in viscose fiber that depict tribal and contemporary Indian art forms. Titled Natures Origami, the AW20 collection is a culmination of four stories: Mrinalini Mukherjees exhibit at the MET, Neo Origami, Flora & Fauna, and Sundarvan. The capsule encompasses fabric manipulation and the revival of age-old textile techniques. At the crossroads where modern chevron meets classic florals, you see laces and layering surfaces in Neo Origami. Festive felicity meets pleats and burnout velvet, and the abundance of la dolce vita in the potpourri of Sundarvan, says Kumar, whose collection features vegetable dyes in shades of deep burgundy, faded ochre, violets and greens, lace work and layering surfaces. Speaking on her collaboration with Lenzing Ecovero, the designer says it is a good initiative to be able to source a fabric that gives a rich look that their viscose fabrics does; the top end fabrics almost look like silk. I think it is a necessity to have something which doesnt have to be polyester.  From Ashdeens collection  Nostalgia @ Ashdeen  Textile designer, author and curator Ashdeen Lilaowala has delved into his own past for inspiration in this new collection, Memories on Cloth. Looking at my childhood photographs, I had very fond memories of being dressed up in embroidered jhablas. Then there were the fancy dress parties to which my sister would be dressed as a Parsi man and my mum would dress me in a traditional sari, he chuckles. He has reimagined these outfits for grown ups, as kaftans and blouses, with embellishments like oversized bows. Were also combining different techniques and patterns: in some, there are polka dots, others use the crane, and few pieces have all the motifs. This has been done on silks, organza, chiffon... We are creating the look of lace using embroidery, adds Lilaowala. 28,000 for separates and 1 lakh for saris.  A House of Three creation  Kolams on jamdani @ House of Three  Continuing their format of integrating two states into each collection, the Bengaluru-based label picked Tamil Nadu and Bengal for this showcase  not least because designers Anu Shyamsundar and Sounak Sen are from these states. The Kumarikandam collection is inspired by the ancient city that was discovered under the Indian Ocean, and is considered the birthplace of human civilisation. This is where Tamil culture came from, explains Sen. They worked with master weaver Rajib Debnath to create muslin jamdani and Sathya and Santhanam from Kanchipuram and Kumbakonam respectively for Kanjivaram silk. Youll see typically jamdani patterns on Kanjivaram and kolam motifs on the muslins, says Sen. 6,000 to 25,000 for pret.

Congress spokesperson Manish Tewari said it was unfortunate that the prime minister made a reference to Pakistan seven times during his address and accused him of hyphenating India with Pakistan during the last five years.  Tewari was referring to Modi's reply to the Motion of Thanks to the President's address.  He also accused Modi of destroying the Indian economy and said the prime minister is covering this up by dividing society through polarisation.  While the country's economy is inflicted by ""coronavirus"", the NDA-BJP government is giving medicines for the common cold, the Congress leader said.  ""It is extremely unfortunate and deeply regrettable that the prime minister's comments oscillated between stand-up comedy, half-truths and rank communalism. It is regrettable that the Prime Minister of India should quote one of his illustrious predecessors Jawaharlal Nehru completely out of context,"" he said.  ""The prime minister should apologise to the country for quoting an agreement signed with another country completely out of context. The prime minister deliberately chose to mislead the House,"" Tewari said.  Tewari said BJP's Hindu-Muslim and India-Pakistan rhetoric is the only way for the ruling party to cover up for its failure in improving the economy of the country which is in a shambles right now due to its policies.  ""That is why I told the finance minister (Nirmala Sitharaman) that the Indian economy is afflicted with the coronavirus and you are trying to give it medicine for a common cold,"" he said.  Tewari alleged that Modi took the help of various communications and various agreements which former prime minister Nehru had entered into in order to support or buttress his claims with regard to the Citizenship (Amendment) Act.  ""Unfortunately, the prime minister was deliberately being selective, if not completely untruthful to this country,"" he said, quoting the agreement that the grant of citizenship should be ""irrespective of religion"".  Congress leader Rahul Gandhi hit out at Modi for not talking about the main issue of unemployment and ""distracting"" people by raising other things from Jawaharlal Nehru to Pakistan.  ""Talk about the main issue prime minister ji. Tell the youth what you are doing about jobs. His style is to distract the country. He had said two crore jobs will be given to youngsters, but five and a half years have passed. Last year 1 crore youth lost jobs, he is unable to say a word,"" Gandhi said.  Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said ""Modi ji our elder. The country and I expected him that he could behave in a neutral, serious manner as per his post. I feel he can not meet the expectations of all those believing in sincere political and public life.""  ALSO READ| Identity of Kashmir buried with exodus of Pandits in 1990: PM Modi in Lok Sabha  ""I may summarise his reply on President's address as - ""'Phate Dhol Aur Bhadde Bol'"", he said.  ""If he would go to buy pulses, tomatoes, onion, mustard oil, cooking gas cylinder he would understand what price hike is and also the pain of the housewives in the country,"" Surjewala said.  Tewari said the Parliament in 1955 chose to make the citizenship act religion-neutral.  ""Does the prime minister believe that the situation that prevailed in 1947 is the situation which prevails in 2020? Is India in the same position in 2020 as it was in 1947? If this was what the PM was trying to say? It seems that the clock of time has stopped in his mind,"" he said.  The Congress leader also said that it is also unfortunate that for 10 years the UPA government spent all its time and efforts in de-hyphenating India from Pakistan, but in the past five years, Modi has invested all his energy and all his time in hyphenating India and Pakistan again.  ""The prime minister refers to Pakistan seven times in his speech- if not more. Are we supposed to compare ourselves with what is literally a banana republic - a country which is owned by a military? Does not it demean our self-esteem and our pride as a nation to compare India to a country which is really an extension of their military? This is what the NDA-BJP government has brought India down to,"" he said.  ""This Hindu-Muslim, this India-Pakistan, the only swan song which the BJP-NDA government has had for the past five years, is being done with only one purpose - to cover up the complete destruction of the Indian economy in the past five years,"" Tewari said.  Today, he alleged, the economy stands pulverized as its fundamentals- savings; consumption, investment and employment - have been destroyed.  After six years of the stewardship of Modi, GDP growth is at five per cent, lowest in 11 years; private consumption is at 5.8 per cent, lowest in seven years; investment growth is at one per cent, lowest in 17 years; manufacturing growth is at two per cent, lowest in 15 years; and agricultural growth is at 2.8 per cent, lowest in four years, Tewari alleged.  Inflation is at 7.35 per cent, highest in five years, and unemployment is at 8.45 per cent, highest in 45 years, he claimed.  Tewari also said that exports-imports, electricity consumption, household savings - everything is down, but fiscal deficit is up.",MUSTARD OIL

It seems to be happening all the time. People, goaded by politicians and sectarian thought, have been turning one person against the other. Instead of celebrating our differences, we succumb to prejudice, and food seems an easy excuse.  I look around and I see the most vocal and growing alienation is between non-vegetarians and vegetarians. Generations of meat- and fish-eating folk face scorn and vilification in schools, workplaces and housing societies, leave alone those who savour bovine or other meats beyond fowl.  Not satisfied with segregating people over food groups, we have now started partitioning them over actual dishes. Like the simple, humble and ever-popular poha.  Late last month, a national general secretary of the ruling party said he suspected the labourers working on his house were not Indian but Bangladeshi, because they were consuming only poha. In light of that ludicrous diatribe, I thought we should talk about poha.  In legend and myth, poha holds great significance. The Bhagavata Purana narrates a story of true friendship between the Hindu deity Krishna and his classmate, Sudama, an impoverished Brahmin. Krishna and Sudama havent met in years and Sudama makes a trip to Dwarka, to meet his long-lost friend. He arrives in tattered clothes and empty-handed, while Krishnas court is full of all the worlds riches. All Sudama can gift Krishna is a handful of poha.  Krishna is overwhelmed and emotional. Sudama returns home without asking for anything, but finds his home and family transformed with riches. Such is the story of poha, too much of which this politician suggested was un-Indian.  I am an Indian. I love poha. And poha is a remarkably simple dish to make. Its rice that is first parboiled, then flattened and dried to make flat, light, flakes, which can be stored for use later. When soaked in water or milk, this flattened rice puffs up, and can be used to make fluffy savoury or sweet delicacies, as well as snacks like chivda.  The simplest way I know to make poha is the way we make it in Maharashtra, kande pohe. Onion and thin pieces of potato are sauted with a tempering of mustard seeds, turmeric, chilli and curry leaves. To this masala mixture, poha that has been soaked and softened is then added.  Vinay Health Home off Charni Road makes the finest kande pohe in Mumbai. They once told me that if the poha is soaked well and is of good quality, there is no need to cook it. One you mix it in with the onion and potato masala, you can just shut the vessel and let it cook in its own steam. When ready, garnish with fried peanuts, coriander and freshly grated coconut, squeeze some lime on top, and you have the finest Maharashtrian breakfast ever.  In fact, when a family visits a traditional Maharashtrian home to meet a prospective bride, her ability to make a good kande pohe is considered a benchmark and can be a big deciding factor.  There was a general outcry from civilised society and the media against this politician who decided to denounce poha, and among those voices was that of an old friend and journalist, Rohit Khanna. His outrage video listed popular dishes from all over the country that use poha, starting with Indori poha, a popular breakfast in Madhya Pradesh that is made the same way as above but garnished with sev and often served with a side of jalebi.  The Bengalis make chirer pulao, which is poha cooked with onions, nuts, raisins, black pepper, green chillies, salt and sugar. In Odisha, poha is mixed with milk, bananas, grated coconut and jaggery, and eaten as a traditional breakfast, called chuda kadali chakata. In Karnataka, bajil or avalakki oggarane is poha is cooked with onion, curry leaves, mustard seeds, gram, peanut and red chillies.  In Goa, poha is cooked in coconut oil with fresh coconut, green chillies, salt, sugar and an extra dose of hing, and called teek phovu or spicy poha. Goans also make dudhache phovu, a sweet dish of poha with milk, sugar and cardamom. Its a lot like Keralas aval vilayichathu, a traditional naivedyam or offering to Krishna. Its poha fried in ghee and mixed with jaggery, chana daal, cashews, peanuts, ground coconut, black sesame seeds and dry ginger powder.  In Maharashtra, just poha with milk is offered to Ganpati on Ganesh Chaturthi Day as prasaad. Is there any doubt that this versatile staple food is anything but Indian? I wonder which world this politician comes from?",MUSTARD OIL

(Gurmeet Singh) A team of officials and farmers during a locust control operation at 10S village along the India-Pak border at Rajasthans Sri Ganganagar. (Gurmeet Singh)  IT IS 5 am on a mild foggy morning, but Agriculture Supervisor Manoj Kumar is already up for the day, and so is Assistant Agriculture Officer Raj Kumar  both posted at Sri Ganganagar district of Rajasthan. Spraying has to start by 7 am and today we have to do it close to the border in 10S village of Karanpur constituency of Sri Ganganagar. The operation is to kill the tiddi dal (swarm of locust) which has come from Pakistan and hit Rajasthan. Last night, it was sitting on the trees of 10S village, says Manoj.  The team includes Gurvinder Singh, agriculture supervisor, M P Upadhayay, driver-cum-mechanic, with plant protection officers Vijaypal Singh, N K Mina at the spot to supervise the operation. Even Deputy Director, Agriculture, Dr G R Matoria has reached the site to ensure that everything goes according to plan.  You need to be on the field in order to check how the operation goes on.you need to listen to the farmers concerns. We have been on the job since the New Year day.In most villages fogging starts at 6 am, but as it is the last village close to the border, we are doing it an hour late due to security reasons. Moreover, teams reached close to the fields after crossing a km path which is muddy and kuccha and hence wanted to travel in daylight only, says Dr Matoria.  Rajasthans 12 districts have been hit by locust attack since May last year, but the worst attack started since mid-December. Over 400 employees have been pressed to work in Sri Ganganagar which is one of the worst-hit districts of Rajasthan. Just 20 feet away from the border fence, workers spray Kikar and Babool trees that stand next to fields where farmers have sown mustard, jowar, and wheat.  We do the spraying from 6 am till 11 am and remain in a particular area till around 2 pm. We have farmer friends in every village who are connected with us on WhatsApp groups and hence they along with our local area supervisor inform us as where the swarm has rested in the evening. By the time sun sets, the pest gets tired and rests on the trees. They fly only on a sunny day. Our teams get information by 6 pm about the next spot and hence we march ahead for evening spray session which continues till 10 pm, says Manoj Kumar, Agriculture Supervisor, who sits ready with a tractor fitted with a sprayer at its back.  Wherever the locust rests during the night decides our next days operation. We do not get permission for night sprays in areas close to the border, he adds.  For this days operation at 10 S village along the Indo-Pak border, farmers have come with four tractors. Tiddi Mandal staff came is in four jeeps loaded with insecticide bottles. Two fire brigade vehicles have also come along. It is 7 am and the staff has reported close to the Pak border.  Plant Protection Officer, Vijay Pal, who was left behind, has reached the spot tracking tyre impressions as phones of his colleagues were not reachable close to the border. Pal, who is posted in Amritsar, is on emergency duty for the past one month in Rajasthan.  I have no time even to manage my clothes..I am on duty all the time, he says.  Raj Kumar, who was in village 24 H a day before which is about 20 km away from this place, said, Every day the team members are not the same.. You never know where the locusts will reach, hence the local staff of the area joins and few employees are given duties in the evening only as where to report the next day.  The teams have been using chlorophripos, melathien for the sprays which kill the insect in three to four hours after the spray. As farmer Gurdev Singh, whose mustard fields are located nearby, asked for stronger medicine, Dr. Matoria, told him that we need to take care of the environment too.  The vehicles keep moving on the kucha path along fields and spraying trees spread over 2 km area till 9.30 am. We want to control locusts before the sun gets to the top, but still a few getaway. Also, there are more coming from the other side, says Manoj Kumar, adding that the team runs on two to three cups of tea during the operation and take a longer break only around lunchtime.  N K Mina, Plant Protection Officer, adds, Though we all wear masks, many have headaches. We have asked staff to drink more fluids, eat jaggery and chana every evening. These precautions need to be taken as we are under the influence of sprays all the time. Farmers in the area also chip in as they take medicine from the department and start the spray work on their own. It is not a one-man job. hence it is a combined exercise. Sometimes, even BSF supports us, says Dr. Matoria, adding that the first village that the team touched was 40 km from this spot.  There is another team at work at Dhanur village, about 5 km away from 10S. We have to stay here for some timeYou never know, where we have to go in the evening, Raj Kumar tells as he buys some biscuits and snacks from a small kirana shop. There is news of a swarm approaching 4V village, about 10 km from Dhanur.  In 10 S, evening spray is not possible as it the last village on the Indo-Pak border. Over 2000 acres are there in 4V village, operation begins at 6 pm and will continue till 8 pm, declares Raj Kumar about the plans for the team for the evening. Yesterday, they had used drones as well in few areas. It gives instant results, says Ranjit Singh, a farmer of 4V, who was worried about the locust swarm.  As the spraying continues into the night, team members use torches to light up the area and spot the flying insects. The day ends with a plan for follow up operation at 4V and 10 S yet again. A new Tiddi Dal has, meanwhile, reached 41H village as well from across the border. Yeh natak hai.. pata nahi kab khatam ho..

Standing potato crops on 35 to 40 acres are also facing sheath blight disease in nearby Mahipani and Dhatkidihi villages.  In Nuagaon block too, crops are affected by the disease while mustard plants have come under pest attack. Tomato crops are getting rotten as they leaned on the wet ground after rain.

Chefs across the country are using desi ghee, pomegranate and more to whip up sauces of their own, highlighting both local flavour profiles and overseas traditions  A Hollandaise to add richness to your eggs Benedict; a smooth, tangy lemon dill sauce to add zest to a grilled chicken; a luscious sauce to turn your bland heap of boiled noodles into a rich spaghetti Bolognese. Sauces can elevate a dish instantly, introducing complementary or contrasting flavours, enhancing visual flair, adding moisture or even improving texture.  In busy restaurant kitchens, however, convenience is key and time is premium. Despite that, chefs find cooking their own sauces a worthy investment, in their endeavours towards creating well-rounded flavours. Todays discerning consumers are concerned about ingredients  especially sugar, salt and artificial flavourings  that go into a sauce. So, although the variety of sauces available on shelves is mind-boggling, chefs are exercising restraint when it comes to readymade sauces.  Saurabh Udinia, corporate executive chef at Massive Restaurants (which runs restaurants like Masala Library, Pa Pa Ya, Farzi Caf and Made in Punjab), says, All the sauces we serve or use are made in our own kitchens. It is time-consuming, but it gives us the freedom to modify, use the right produce, know the source of each ingredient, keep our knowledge of exact allergens in mind and make sure that they are preservative and additive-free. Desi ghee hollandaise, bell pepper ketchup, mustard ketchup, and pomegranate are just a few of the many in-house sauces we make.  Fresh is flavourful  Game of flavour notes (Clockwise from left) Roasted pork with adobo; specialty dishes by Ground Up and Masala Library getty images/istock and special arrangement | Photo Credit: Juan Salvador Fernndez Tamayo  Chef Nagraj Bhat of London Taxi, Mumbai, opines, In-house sauces are always healthier, because we use fresh ingredients, dont add any additives or preservatives. Our sauces have lower sodium content than the store-bought ones and are made fresh daily. Most importantly, we can alter the taste of each sauce depending upon the dish and guests preference.  Nagrajs raspberry jalapeo and fennel sauce, he says, tastes like tamarind chutney. We serve the raspberry sauce along with our jalapeo cheddar chicken tikka.  While Nagraj prioritises the blending of flavour, for Rohan Hastak, founder of Ground Up, Pune, the context of the ingredients is vital. He likes them locally sourced, as far as possible. We believe that being able to influence every aspect of the condiment is not only fun and challenging for a chef, but also the best way to create food that really feels like our own. When a chef decides to make something from scratch, the process is much more rewarding. From a milk-and-egg mayonnaise to a tahini, and a Mexican mole sauce to various salsas, all sauces are freshly made at Ground Up.  Chef Nagraj adds, The flavour of the main ingredient should complement the sauce and the sauce should add depth, colour and enhance the overall taste of the dish. Sauces differ in each cuisine and even geographically, according to ingredients that are locally available and seasonal. Intriguingly, his barbecue sauce is made with Granny Smith, an apple cultivar that has its origins in Australia but has been gaining ground in India over the past few years. It is for our pork ribs, as apple-and-pork is a classic combination. The sharpness of the apples cuts through the richness of the pork without overpowering it, he says.  Evolutionary tale  Marie-Antonin Carme, one of the forefathers of classical French cuisine, identified the original mother sauces: Bchamel, Espagnole, Velout and Allemande. Chef Auguste Escoffier then replaced Allemande with Hollandaise in the 1900s. These sauces still hold an important place in many kitchens, but with the introduction of sauces from around the globe, the concept of sauces has changed and there are several modern variations.  Chefs unanimously agree that consumers are discovering cuisines, as they travel more, and are constantly seeking something new. Pasta sauce, BBQ sauce, salsa, are no longer exceptional, and newer gourmet sauces are beginning to make their presence felt.  Adobo, a cooking sauce from the Philippines which uses five ingredients  soy sauce, vinegar, garlic, peppercorns and bay leaf  is fast catching the fancy of chefs. So is the Korean ssamjang, a spicy, thick sauce made with gochujang, doenjang soy bean paste, sesame oil, garlic and sugar or honey for sweetness.  Concentrated and potent, a sticky ketchup-like sriracha has long been known to elevate Thai food and can be added to scrambled eggs on toast, as well. Yet, chefs are now opting for the closest relative of sriracha  sambal oelek, with a more vinegary tang and less garlicky sweetness, to add flavour to any dish that calls for a bite of heat. The punchy horseradish sauce is another one gaining popularity, and brings a sharp focus to the rich flavours of meat.  Says chef Nagraj, At London Taxi, our smoked apple BBQ sauce is paired with our slow braised pork ribs as apple and pork is a match made in heaven.

Winter meant stories of seasonal food, mostly of avarakkai (Hyacinth beans/ broad beans), not available in Hyderabad around the year.  The meals at home, in our nuclear family, were always simple, fuss-free, vegetarian fare. My mother focused on eating local and seasonal  a guiding principle at home. As I write this, I wonder how this is the exact food concept that has taken over the world right now  of eating seasonal foods from the region.  Family affair  Come winter, the seasonal avarakkai would make its much-awaited appearance. My mom would regale us with stories of how shelling the beans and then removing the outer skin was once a family affair. She also spoke of how the best beans were the ones that had the characteristic sogadu  aroma of the beans harvested at the right time  and how the bean made its way into almost everything from idli, dosa, upma, rice, rasam and sambhar.  One winter my father returned from Bangalore with a bag full of avarakkai. The distinctive smell of the beans in a cloth bag is something I can never forget. Excited, my parents, sister and I sat together to shell the beans; I kept looking at my fingers change colour from the oily texture of the bean pod. My mother explained that sogadu is also when the bean is at its best size and flavour and is usually harvested after a spell of rainfall. The next few days were all about avarakkai  from avarakkai saaru (rasam), a recipe that she learnt from her mother, to avarakkai uppitu (upma) and akki roti (rice rotis).  However, my favourite was the hittaku avarebele huli (sambhar made with peeled beans). When I first tasted it, I knew it was unlike the regular sambhar we had at home. This one was made using the beans cooked in ground masala and not the traditional dal.  Sweet and fried  Years later when we shifted to Bengaluru, winters meant easy access to the much-loved avarakkai as well as seeing it in many other forms including in a halwa and as a fried savoury snack. At my first newspaper job in Bengaluru, the office canteen served it with poori and it tasted exactly like what we used to eat at home.  Winter is also when the avarakkai mela takes place at Bengalurus Sajjan Rao Circle, an annual affair that sees crowds throng to sample myriad interpretations of the bean. After visiting several editions of the festival, I can say that there is something new to look forward to every year.  The bean can make its appearance even in your pani puri and gulab jamun. The versatility of this bean and the way it blends into so many dishes is really like no other. People also believe that the name of the city was inspired by the bean as it was called Bendakala Ooru (the city of baked beans) that eventually became Bengaluru. Avarakkai, for me, is a food memory that I cherish and hold close to my heart.  Photo: Bindu Gopal Rao  Hittaku Avarebele Huli  Ingredients  200 grams avarakkai without skin  2 medium onion  2 medium tomatoes  A few sprigs fresh coriander  100 grams dry coconut  4-5 dry red chillies  100 grams fresh coconut  2-3 green chillies  1 stick cinnamon  A few cloves garlic (optional)  1 tsp mustard seeds  1 tsp cumin seeds  A pinch asafoetida  1 tsp turmeric  2 sprigs curry leaves  1 tbsp oil or ghee  1 tbsp sambhar powder  1 tbsp rasam powder  50 ml tamarind juice  Salt to taste  Method  1. Fry onions, dry coconut, cinnamon, garlic and red chillies and set aside. Once cool, grind them with fresh coconut, green chillies, fresh coriander, garlic and tomato into a coarse paste.  2. Heat oil in a pan and add mustard seeds, cumin seeds, curry leaves and asafoetida. Once the mustard seeds sputter, add the ground masala and fry for a few minutes.  3. Add the washed avarakkai beans and fry for some time. Add a little water, salt, turmeric, sambhar and rasam powder. Keep adding water in small quantities as the dish starts to thicken. Cover and allow the avarakkai to cook in the ground masala.  4. Add tamarind juice and bring to a boil.  5. Serve hot.

(Photo: Pixabay) Garam masala is rich in phytonutrients. (Photo: Pixabay)  Kitchen spices, besides adding flavour to our food, are known for their ability to fight a host of health issues. From curing digestive problems to boosting immunity, the antioxidants in them are extremely helpful for the body. Garam masala, which is an aromatic combination of spices like coriander seeds, cumin, nutmeg, cardamom, cinnamon, mustard seeds, fennel, black pepper and clove among others, is a powerful spice that should be part of your regular cooking.  Dispelling the myth that garam masala is a heat-inducing ingredient that shouldnt be had, lifestyle coach Luke Coutinho took to Instagram to share a video where he can be seen listing down the benefits of the spice.  Ayurveda is a brilliant system of science that exists in our country. A lot of people say that one should avoid garam masala as its a heat-inducing ingredient. We need warm foods. Some people may not be able to have warm foods because of certain conditions. Rest of us can, he said.  Heres what garam masala does to your body.  Improves digestion  Garam masala stimulates appetite and improves digestion by promoting the release of gastric juices in the stomach. Cloves and cumin in it keep indigestion at bay, and cloves also help in preventing acidity. Many people think that if one is acidic, one should avoid warm foods. But you are highly mistaken. Garam masala is great for your digestive system as they help produce digestive enzymes that are key to breaking down food, explained Coutinho.  It also helps in fighting issues like bloating and flatulence because of its carminative properties. The spice-mix also keep the gastrointestinal tract in shape.  Helps improve metabolism  The ingredients in garam masala are rich in phytonutrients, which help in boosting metabolism. Warm food helps you boost your metabolism. Your metabolism has everything to do with your energy level, burning fat, losing weight and keeping you going throughout the day. When you have a low metabolism, you dont break down food efficiently. When you have a high metabolism, you can get away with eating certain foods and not be putting on weight at all, said Coutinho.  Rich in antioxidants  Garam masala is rich in antioxidants which helps in preventing skin problems. It also helps fight inflammation. We also need warmth in our body to detoxify it and remove the toxins from the colon, kidney and liver. Garam masala does just that, he said.  Fights bad breath  The presence of cloves and cardamom in garam masala makes it ideal for fighting bad breath.",MUSTARD OIL

Thats all well and good, but one would think theyd eventually run out of surprises to deliver. Thats what I thought at any rate. Nearly six years and 19 outlets later, Im tasting the newly introduced menu at the brands Connaught Place bistro, and am forced to admit I fell for the Farzi routine yet again.  Zorawar Kalra  Leaving ourselves in the seasoned hands of chef (and Massive Restaurants mainstay) Saurabh Udinia for the food, my dining companion and I turn our attention to the sluicing instead of the browsing. Farzis liquor list is long and lissome, with classic cocktails like the Whisky Sour that are textbook and the restaurants own renditions, like Gin in a Bottle, as potent as they are palatable.  Our first dish, the Raw Mango and Chicken Koshimber is a revelation; in fact, its nuts. Inspired by Thailands Som Tam (raw papaya) salad, the Farzi variant is served a la Gueridon with a chef preparing the dish tableside. Juliennes of raw mango and grilled chicken are muddled together with spiced nuts, herbs, and spices in a decorative mortar and pestle before being served to us. There is nothing decorous in the way we slurp it down, but then thats just how good it is.  Next up is the Beetroot & Cream Cheese Tikki with Fennel Chutney, which comes skewered before we can even condemn it for being vegetarian. Were glad we reserved judgment however because these multi-layered morsels, crisp outside yet soft inside, are heaven-sent, with a gentle but distinctive flavor profile, which the accompanying chutney only elevates.  The Shredded Chicken Dhokla is the desi Subway we never knew we wanted. And this is no way a slur, because Subway is our favourite Quick Service Restaurant, being fresh and tasty and whatnot. The chicken dhokla is all that, but better, with zesty flavours and tractable textures, coming together in a wide mouthful (extra tissues to mop up after recommended).  (Clockwise from top) The new menu at Farzi Cafe in Connaught Place features dishes like the Shredded Chicken Dhokla and Beetroot & Cheese Tikki  For us, the stand-out is the Pulled Mustard Fish on Raw Banana Fritters, a dish so clever in itself that we cant even come up with an appropriate quip. Raw banana is segmented, squashed, deep-fried, and then mashed again into fritters, which are fried yet again. Piled high with a fricassee of fried fish accented with chaat flavours and a sprinkling of sev, this is a dish we could tackle and bait on a daily basis.  The fish stuffing us to the brine, er, brim, we decide to go simple with our mains, sticking to Kerala Chicken Biryani with Black Channa Pachdi. Its just what we need, a gentle melange of fragrant rice, curry leaves, spices, and normative chicken, tender to a fault.  However, it is our dessert, Apple Mithai with Custard Cream, which ends up bamboozling us the most, and really brings back the whole Farzi factor to bear. Without spoiling the surprise, let us just confirm that it lives up to every word of its name: theres mithai, theres apple, theres custard, and theres a whole lot of Farzi.  Touche, Mr Kalra. We look forward to the next iteration.  Meal for Two: Rs 2500 (including taxes and alcohol), At: E-38/39, Connaught Place",MUSTARD OIL

But this was not so until 2012 when she quit her job as an assistant professor in computer science at DG Vaishnav College to start Sams Culinary Art of Cooking and Baking in April of that year. I was beginning to feel dissatisfied. I studied computers only because my father wanted me to. He often told me, You will have to man the kitchen once you get married, in any case. Why do you want to study culinary arts? I did not question him then. But I felt restricted in my job. I took six months of unpaid leave, she recalls.  Based in Kodambakkam, through her venture, Vahita has taught people from across 20 countries to cook. It all started with a person who came to her through a mutual friend. Through my contacts and by using my skill in social media marketing, I could reach out to people easily, says Vahita, who teaches north Indian and south Indian cuisine, and baking. Even as a little girl, Vahita had an intimate relationship with food. I have done some bizarre things. Once I bought a live chicken. Not knowing what to do with it, I made a mess of it. After that, my mother made a thokku of the chicken. I learned all my cooking by making a mess and having my mother help me out, shares Vahita. Her love for non-vegetarian food is quite evident from her daily menu which often features some meat-based dish. Eggs, too, are a favourite. My family loves the shark puttu, pasta beetroot pepper fry and mutton fry that I make, she says.  For a teacher, discipline is first nature. That is an unsaid rule in Vahitas kitchen, too. A stickler for time, she expects her students to be punctual for class. I do not like anyone to wait for me. It is disrespectful if I make them wait. In the same way, I also do not like to wait. I will wait only for God who is my creator. I will not wait for anybody else, says Vahita, who expects her students to clean up after the class.  Vahita cooks simple dishes at home, and usually with a lot of vegetables. She conducts classes daily and the number of hours she spends wielding the ladle depends on the dish she plans to teach her pupils. She takes a break for an hour or two in the afternoon.  With food being such an intrinsic part of her life, she gives back to society in simple ways. For instance, she conducts classes for transgenders too. But she doesnt charge them. She also believes that if you want to learn then you must approach your teacher and not vice versa. I get requests from celebrities and politicians to teach their children. They want me to go to their place and teach their children. I will not do that, asserts Vahita. Vahitas classes are incomplete without her nuggets of history on the dishes of the day and the ingredients that go in them. After all, arent these the small pleasures that make food interesting?

(Clockwise from left) In Mohali, the focus is on growing vegetables like pumpkin, bottle gourd, bitter gourd, ladyfinger etc in summer and cabbage, carrots, cauliflower etc in winter.  It was in 2018 that 44 families from Mohali and Chandigarh came together to do community farming on two acre land. The number has now gone up to 60 families and the land doubled to four acres on the Mohali-Siswan road. Every family that is part of the project pays Rs 24,000 per year each.  It all began in early 2018, when Dr Sachin Gupta, HoD, medical oncology department at Max hospital, Mohali, attended a workshop on organic farming organised by NGO Kheti Virasat Mission in Ludhiana. Dr Gupta said,I am a cancer specialist and I am aware that how pesticides are causing harm to human bodies, hence the idea clicked soon after attending the workshop. I made a WhatsApp group of my friends and shared the idea. Soon, a friend, Dr Sameer Goyal, came up with an idea to give his two acres agriculture land on lease to us. He was doing contract farming done on his four acres land. So we took the 2 acres land on contract in October 2018 at Rs 40,000 per acre. Initially, we were 44 families, including Dr Goyal. After hiring four workers, we started organic farming. He added: Our focus was to grow vegetables which can thus be distributed to all the families. We focused on vegetable farming and grew seasonal vegetables in January 2019 after making the land ready for organic farming. Intially we charged Rs 12,000 per annum per family and hence we started getting summer and winter vegetables such as pumpkin, bottle gourd, bitter gourd, ladyfinger etc in summer while cabbage, carrots, cauliflower, methi (fenugreek), palak (spinach), sarson (mustard) etc. in winters. Potatoes, onions, garlic is also part of our project as these items are used on a regular basis.  Dr Gupta says that farming made them realise that farmers are paid peanuts for their crops. One of our members also works as a manager to manage every thing and also to help in delivering the vegetables to all housesAround 200 fruit trees of jamun, mango, guava, peach, shehtoot etc are being added apart from increasing the area under vegetables as families have also increased. We have installed our own tubewell, he said, adding that per family charges have increased to Rs 24,000 per annum. This includes, lease money, salary of employees who have been increased to eight now and many other expenses as well. We have plans to create our own seed bank so as to reduce the cost of purchasing seeds, said Dr Gupta, revealing that for wheat and rice, they tie up with organic farmers and buy in bulk.  Fazilka  In the border district of Fazilka, two neighbours are working on a similar principle. Subodh Verma and his neighbour Dr Rajesh Sharma do organic farming on 1.5 acres of land. Subodh said,We have cultivated sarson, turmeric, chillies, barley, wheat in some part while seasonal vegetables, onion garlic, potato in another. We also have purchased our own machine through which we take out mustard oil out from mustard seeds which suffices our annual need for cooking oil. Turmeric and chillies processed using our own machines to make masalas throughout the year. We produce barley and wheat, while rice we get from farmers who grow it naturally. Now, we are looking for rearing desi cows as we want to have milk that is free from impurities. We dont know as what is being added in the milk being delivered to us by companies. He added that the per year yield is enough for both families. Both families spend around Rs 15,000 per month that includes salary of employee as well.  Ludhiana  In Ludhianas Issewal village, however, group farming is being done in one acre land by 20 families on land taken from a local industrialist Maneet Dewan. Amrita Mangat, a member of this group, said,Maneet gave us this land for free and we are spending Rs 2500 per month per family to meet expenses. We are focusing on growing vegetables only on this land. Fruits, cereals are coming from farmers who do natural farming and hence we pool in to purchase even those products as well. We are trying our best to east everything grown naturally.We are doing group farming for more than 5 years now.  On Hambaran road, on the outskirts of Ludhiana, Neerja Jain grows her own vegetables on a one acre plot of land that is owned by her cousin.  She said: It was a jungle when I visited that area in early 2018. We started cleaning the wild growth of grass, prepared the soil and slowly and in September, started sowing vegetables. Last winter, we tasted vegetables grown in our own farm. We spend Rs 40,000 to get the farm ready and now bear running expenses. The vegetables are shared among relatives and even some of our workers. Neerja, who runs a boutique in an upmarket Ludhiana locality, says that now 15 families have joined the chain.  Farmers like Chamkaur Singh, who does organic farming in Ludhiana, Anirudh Kumar, a farmer from Sunam, visited my farm and guided me a lot as how to go about it, she said, adding that community members pay as less as Rs 500 per month and take vegetables home as they mature.  Rakesh Kharbanda, a chemist who is part of the group, It is wonderful to do group farming and share vegetables as per your family size.",MUSTARD OIL

India-born, Vancouver-based Chef Vikram Vij on his journey in the culinary world  In Vancouver, Vikram Vij is a culinary rockstar. Diners line up outside his restaurants, even in biting cold, fortified by masala chai, for his signature cooking. His food has won multiple awards, drawing press and TV personalities from across the world, including the late Antony Bourdain and Giada De Laurentiis. He runs four restaurants, and a food truck, Vijs Railway Express. Hes also released cookbooks, and has a line of frozen, ready-to-eat food.  In Chennai, Vikram is anonymous. India after all, is more familiar with British, European, and American celebrity chefs, thanks to TV and Netflix. Nevertheless, Vikram is impossible to overlook, with his big personality, flamboyant energy and gender-fluid nose ring, accentuated by jingling bracelets.  Beyond labels  In life and cooking, Vikram resists labels. I am not an Indian chef, he says, settling down for a chat over dinner. I am a classically trained French chef. I put myself on a plate: I am India born, using Canadian ingredients and French techniques.  He pauses to spear a coconut prawn with his fork: dinner is at Zhouyu, the Chinese restaurant newly launched by Chindi Varadarajulu. Chindi grew up in Singapore and then moved to Vancouver to open a South Indian restaurant, called Chutney Villa, after which she began travelling to India with food tour groups. She ended up settling down in Chennai in 2012, opening Pumpkin Tales, and now Zhouyu.  Vikram also hosts culinary tours, and is now travelling through South India with a group of Canadians. At Zhouyu, his group chats animatedly about their day at a local market and the joys of eating freshly made porottas. Since it is a private dinner, Chindi has got her chefs to made crisp vadais. After all, with people who truly love food, cuisines do not need to be categorised. And rules are meant to be broken.  Which is why, as a 19-year-old who wanted to cook for a living, Vikram realised that he needed to leave the country to develop an independent culinary style. I could not do this being in India. I needed validation from outside to be taken seriously here, he says matter of factly, adding, I needed to learn European techniques. I needed to learn French. I had to become a certified sommelier.  In 1983, Vikram left home in Amritsar, to study Hotel Management in Salzburg, Austria. After working in Salzburg and Vienna, he moved to Canada in 1989 and opened his first restaurant, Vijs, in Vancouver, plating up a style of Indian food influenced by his roots but not dictated by them. I never followed family recipes, though they were embedded in my mind. I took those flavours and modernised them, he says. When I opened, I thought: I wont be like all the other Indian restaurants. I wont call this Taj Mahal. I wont even say authentic Indian. After all, who defines authenticity?  Vijs opened with 18 seats and a staff of one person: Vikram. When my parents came to visit from India, papa sold some property and brought me money in a brown paper bag! My mother wanted me to serve the best chicken curry possible, so she made it at home, and brought it to my restaurant on the bus balancing it on her knees all the way.  His menu, however, was modern Indian. I serve a rack of lamb marinated in mustard and white wine. Thats French. But the sauce is a fenugreek kurma sauce, he says, adding with a laugh, Of course, there was a push back from the Indian diners. They said it was not authentic. But I would be there, wearing a kurta-pyjama, and I would speak to them in fluent Hindi, Punjabi or Urdu, and they would agree to give it a chance.  Finding fame  When Mark Bittman from The New York Times visited anonymously, and wrote a review on Vijs calling it easily among the finest Indian restaurants in the world, diners began to queue up outside.  Today, Vikram and his ex-wife Meeru Dhalwala run Vijs, and the more casual Rangoli, which features a chic glocal-Indian plates like broccoli, bacon and black chickpea curry, or savoury crepes with grilled kale. He and Meeru still have a strong partnership: My ex-wife is the mother of my daughters. She is involved in the cooking, and runs the kitchens. I never want to take the credit away: she is an integral part of the restaurants, he says.  Vikram also has a solo restaurant, My Shanti, with a menu based on his travels across India, featuring Hyderabad-inspired duck biryani, as well as gunpowder prawns and wild boar kebabs.  His most charming legacy, however, is his Punjabi, all-woman workforce. It started when I needed a dishwasher, and my Punjabi head cook suggested someone from her village, he says, explaining how it has inadvertently grown into a support-group of sorts for first and second generation immigrants.  None of them are chefs. All of them have worked so hard to educate their children, sending them to great schools and now the kids have good jobs... The day-time ladies dont know the menu, they grind dal, prep vegetables and leave. Then the next batch comes and starts putting it together, says Vikram.  For them, work is not just about creating edgy modern Indian food. Its cooking the way their grandmothers did back in India: as a community.",MUSTARD OIL

After all, you do get sushi in a box, sashouka on-the-go and pasta at home. Yet, the very few recent restaurants notwithstanding, Chennai continues to reserve that label for French food. When The Lounge at Holiday Inn ordered a special French dinner  Saveurs de France  curated by chef Virginie Bompoil, it attracted quite a few enthusiasts from the city for a night of experimentation and self-administered food dares. And the three-course pre-plated spread was more than what the guests could have conceived.  In her genes  A home chef who picked up the highs and lows of culinary delights from her grandmother and father, Virginie served up simple, traditional cuisine thats more or less the staple in the households of France. While this meant that the menu had a few familiar entrants, even to us amateurs, it certainly was not without her signature style it seems. So I was not surprised when the meal began with the humble French onion soup  with a large piece of cheesy bread floating in it, too. That it was paired with a sweet merlot added just the right amount of excitement to the comfort carrier. A warm goat cheese salad  still paired with the merlot  cleaned up the soup act to perfection.  Table talk  As the guests sat waiting for the entre to arrive, small talk around the table over fruit and cheese played out like sneakpeek into disjointed short stories. A Romanian guest, speaking to an Indian man (coincidentally, one of the hotels directors), expressed her surprise over Indians  so used to the rich cuisine of their land  making peace with French food that has an ill repute for blandness (she herself prefers Indian food and suggested that he should consider opening a restaurant in her home town). There was some buzz over Vikas Khannas recent visit to the city, an elderly guests curiosity over the Romanian woman and her German friends mehendi-adorned hands brought on a discussion about DakshinaChithra and the work they do; I for one found a new food blogger to follow in the directors wife.  Despite all this distraction, the jars of Virginies home-made mustard sauce (with its manufacturing date handwritten on the simple white label) caught everyones attention. Made with the recipe handed down to her by her grandmother, one she has perfected over the years, it is one of those foods that you would either love or hate  theres no in-between. At this table, there was plenty of love for this coarse paste that hit the tongue with subtle sweetness but went down with a distinct mustardy punch. When the fish bread entre came with a dash of homemade mayonnaise, the guests were quick enough to spot the mustard sauce in the mix. (If this was tempting enough, the mustard is available at The Nilgiris, Besant Nagar; Tryst chain of stores and Amma Naana supermarket)  Drink, dine, dessert  For the main course, the sauvignon blanc on offer incited as much excitement as the crunchy salmon dish I picked over the classic coq au vin. The wine delivered ten-fold with its light and crisp sweetness.  A steadfast merlot woman, I found myself considering conversion. But the salmon did not work as well for me. While the huge piece of fish with its crispy coat of peanuts would have made anyone quite happy, my hatred for nuts (cue: gasp) kept me from being able to enjoy the dish. Despite the major hiccup, I had immense love for the bed of sauted french beans and a generous serving of cognac mushroom sauce the fish came with. The chicken fared better  all tender and rich with red wine  fared better, I heard. By the time traffic on the busy IT corridor that was visible from the floors huge glass windows had thinned to intermittent flashes of red and white lights, the desserts were brought in. The rich French apple pie  the caramelised slices of apple, apple pure and thin slivers of almonds offering a beautiful mixture of texture and decadent dark chocolate mousse were perfectly paired with a mild ros.  A dinner two weeks in the making took a little more than two hours to satiate a group of hungry enthusiasts. The highs and lows of the dinner did little to mar the delight of the experience or the brief friendships formed over a common table. When Virginie sent us home with a jar of that divine mustard sauce, it was a bonne nuit indeed.",MUSTARD OIL

Senior scientist and assistant director at CBRTI, Lakshmi Rao, conceptualised the idea of Indias first floral calendar, which was recently published.  The Pune-based Central Bee Research and Training Institute (CBRTI) has launched a floral calendar which provides area-wise and region-wise floral distribution, to help farmers and beekeepers across India to plan their beekeeping cycles at optimal locations.  Scientists said the move is expected to boost overall honey generation and boost the income of farmers and beekeepers.  Senior scientist and assistant director at CBRTI, Lakshmi Rao, conceptualised the idea of Indias first floral calendar, which was recently published and uploaded on the website of Khadi Village and Industries Commission (KVIC), and is available for free to all.  Leading the institutes apiary training for several years now, Rao said such a calendar was necessary, and that from here on out, it would come in handy for suggesting the best regions for beekeeping.  This will be like a natures guide for farmers, who can now place beehive boxes at favourable locations where there is the seasons best flowering and nectar for the honeybees, said Rao.  As part of her research, Rao said she had surveyed farms, fields, forests, plantations and estates across the country. By documenting local crops and their flowering patterns, she said she was able to come up with data-based suggestions for the calendar.  The calendar mentions multiple species of honeybees, their favourite flower or plant for both Kharif and rabi seasons for every state in India. Researchers said the massive quantities of data generated from each state made it a challenging task to collate and classify the information based on criteria such as region, season, pulses, vegetables and fruits grown in India.  The effort is to naturally route the honeybees to feed on their choicest flowers in the most favourable area, senior researchers said.  In addition to the vagaries of weather, the crops are also affected by diseases and excessive spraying of insecticides and pesticides, which is a growing cause for worry for the flowering and growth of many crops, CBRTI researchers said. During the last season, many beekeepers suffered a huge setback when the honey they manufactured were rejected by international markets, including the US. This was because the mustard crop, on which the bees fed, were found to be sprayed with heavy amounts of pesticide, which rendered the honey produced unfit for consumption.",MUSTARD OIL

(File) The Agriculture Ministry has estimated a 9.5% jump in the total acreage under rabi field crops this time compared to in 2018-19. (File)  The global spread of the coronavirus outbreak couldnt have come at a worse time for Indian farmers  just when they are set to harvest a bumper rabi crop on the back of higher plantings enabled by the wettest monsoon in 25 years and extended heavy rains till early-November.  Rising COVID-19 infection cases, including in India, has acted as a sentiment dampener ahead of the marketing season for major rabi crops, whose mandi arrivals will pick up after Holi on March 10.  The Agriculture Ministry has estimated a 9.5% jump in the total acreage under rabi field crops  especially wheat, rapeseed-mustard, chana (chickpea), masur (red lentil), matar (field pea) and maize  this time compared to in 2018-19. March is also the harvesting/marketing period for the main rabi onion, potato and garlic crops, apart from red chilli and seed spices such as jeera (cumin seed), dhaniya (coriander) and saunf (fennel).  For farmers, the price outlook was generally bullish till around mid-January. Mustard in Rajasthans Alwar mandi was quoting at an average of Rs 4,150 per quintal, as against Rs 3,800 a year ago. But the oilseed is currently trading at Rs 3,600-3,700, way below the governments minimum support price (MSP) of Rs 4,425. Chana prices at Latur in Maharashtra have, likewise, plunged to Rs 3,650 per quintal, when its MSP is at Rs 4,875.  Note: Wheat, corn and soyabean prices refer to the most actively-traded futures contracts at the Chicago Board of Trade. Raw sugar, cocoa and coffee prices are for the most actively-traded futures at the Intercontinental Exchange. Skim Milk Powder price is the average for the fortnightly Global Dairy Trade auctions. Crude palm oil price is for the most actively-traded futures at the Bursa Malaysia exchange. Rice prices are export quotes for Thai white grain with 5% broken content.

Rubber price is for RSS-4 grade at Bangkok. Cotton price is the average based on the Cotlook A index.  The link with the coronavirus is obvious in the case of mustard. Crude palm oil prices in Malaysia had started this calendar year at 3,130 ringgits ($ 765 per tonne), with global stocks that were projected to drop to their lowest since 2009-10. But as reports of the novel virus epidemic in China gathered momentum from mid-January, prices crashed to sub-2,500 ringgits ($ 600) by end-February. Lower palm prices have, in turn, pulled down the rates for soyabean and other oilseeds, including mustard.  But it isnt vegetable oil alone. As the accompanying table shows, international prices of almost every agri-commodity have registered declines after mid-January, with rice and coffee being notable exceptions. Significantly, the current levels are still higher than a year ago in most commodities, barring soyabean, cotton and rubber. It reflects fundamental global supply tightness, also manifested in the UN Food and Agricultural Organisations Food Price Index in January touching its highest since December 2014.  That situation has, of course, reversed subsequently. Commodity markets have been singed no less than equities by COVID-19s rapid worldwide spread and reduced Chinese buying of everything, from palm oil and cotton to milk powder and meat.  For farmers, this isnt good news. Red chilli prices at Andhra Pradeshs Guntur Mirchi Yard had ruled at Rs 13,000-19,000 per quintal before mid-January, even briefly scaling a record Rs 22,000 for the premium high-pungency Teja variety grades. Those have now eased to  Rs 10,000-15,000, with expectations of a further fall due to shipments to China coming to a standstill. A bumper crop, in combination with Chinese imports not taking place, has led to jeera prices at Gujarats Unjha market hovering around Rs 13,350 per quintal, down from Rs 15,750 last year at this time.  After a poor kharif crop  impacted both by the monsoons delayed onset and unseasonal rains during maturity stage  Indian farmers are well set to reap a bountiful harvest. And with both global and domestic prices recovering after a prolonged bear phase, rural incomes till recently seemed on the cusp of a turnaround. Sadly, it looks that the coronavirus has upended those hopes. Even if China were to resume buying  inevitable at some point  that may happen only after the farmer has sold.",MUSTARD OIL

Tomato-sized hailstones pattered down the state capital turning the streets into a sheet of white. Several two wheelers skidded on the streets and window panes also cracked due to the force of hail.  Lucknow recorded 14.6 mm of rainfall, accompanied by high speed winds. Several areas were waterlogged and a number of cars were stranded on the streets.  A large number of schoolchildren, travelling on rickshaws, were seen scurrying for cover in nearby shops and buildings.  Similar weather conditions have been reported in Jhansi, Meerut, Mirzapur, Orai and Hamirpur.  In Agra, extensive damage to standing mustard and potato crops has been reported from the rural hinterland of Agra region after hail, with spells of heavy showers, lashed western Uttar Pradesh.  Heavy showers in Mathura and Vrindavan have affected Holi festivities. ""The mood has been dampened not only by the showers but also by the coronavirus scare all around. The number of pilgrims has gone down,"" said Vrindavan activist Jagan Nath Poddar.

An analyst from Odisha, Abinas lives and works in Hyderabad, and had done his preparation well. He wanted to make a statement  not for himself or his cooking skills, but for Odishas cuisine which is rarely spoken of. Abinass love to create regional food and present it with an Instagram-worthy twist, has drawn a lot of followers. They know what to expect of him  so much so that when he repeatedly used his water straw morha to present his dishes, they wanted more.  Abinas went on to use his expertise to create dishes not commonly found on restaurant menus. I decided to make the Chicken Besara, a dish made with an Oriya signature mustard paste base. I used black and white mustard seeds to make a paste along with cumin, chilli, and garlic. I presented it with rice and the judges polished it off. After which I was simply told, You are selected. No questions asked, no interview. I was dumbfounded. Seeing other participants go through 30-minute interviews, I was quite nervous,says Abinas, speaking over phone from Mumbai, where he is with his family to celebrate his win.  Abinas is all for experimentation: he is not just about the Odia pakhla bhaat and ghugni; nor is he one to constantly debate on the GI tag for rasagulla. He has attempted a chocolate variant of the traditional rasagulla; has made chicken drumsticks and kebabs on betel leaves, among many others. A self-taught food stylist and techie, Abinas was also the recipient of the Lokicooks Fellowship 2019.  All worthwhile  Going back to his days at the Masterchef kitchen, Abinas recollects it to be humongous and gruelling. He admits that he found the experience overwhelming at times. But it was all worthwhile once the task was completed. We would spend over 10 hours in the kitchen preparing, brainstorming, discussing, and learning at the same time. The most daunting task on the show was the Republic Day episode. We were to make 15 thalis with 100 dishes from different regions of India, he recollects.  Abinas credits his interest in cooking to his grandmother Jashoda with whom he spent most of his middle school years in Aska near Behrampur. He is now busy attending events at catering and hotel management institutions to discuss food. He doesnt plan to start a restaurant yet, but is sure to do so in the future. For now, I plan to document lesser-known cuisines of India, he adds.  Abinas runs us through his winning dish: My contender was strong and highly talented. So, for the grand finale, I decided to use all what I learned from the chefs I met, and the judges. For the final cook-off, I went all regional with flavours. I made prawn ceviche with a tempering of the Oriya pago and ambula. I also made vermicelli-coated prawn fry. This was a starter. For the main course, I picked a lost Odia recipe, the Oda mangsho (ginger lamb). I presented desi flavoured lamb shanks in an international style with mulberry, ginger, lemon honey vinaigrette, and balsamic ginger reduction. Ginger was the show-stopper flavour.",MUSTARD OIL

Greeted at the door by a smiling Shanthi, youre instantly engulfed by the feeling of a home. Her yoga session is done, the lunch table is set and while she waits for her husband to arrive, we sit down for a quick conversation. Married at the age of 15, you could say that Shanthis tryst with cooking began quite early. Away from her friends and family, she turned to food under the strict eye and guidance of her mother-in-law.  Shanthi Sekar  Ashwin Prasath  She admits that it was quite a leap  a leap from not knowing the difference between moong and toor dal when she was at her mothers place, into the bottomless cauldron of punchy flavours and succulent meats that is authentic Mudaliar cuisine. A community of cooking that doesnt boast of the popularity of Chettinad flavours or the reviving trend of Kongu flavours, Mudaliar style of cooking is distinct in its rich repast of seafood and poultry. My father and my husband are both seafood aficionados and I grew up eating non-vegetarian food almost daily.  They used to head out to the fish markets near Marina Beach early every morning and bring kilos of fish and prawns back home. Fresh meat is the key that defines our cooking, asserts Shanthi. Sura puttu  a stir-fry of minced shark meat mixed with a medley of spices  prawns masala vadai kozhambu, prawns poriyal, kola urundai and appalam kootu  a Mudaliar favourite made out of old papads  are some of the traditional Mudaliar dishes that are now a part of Shanthis repertoire, passed on to her from her mother-in-law. But the nethili kozhambu is the absolute crowd-pleaser.  Experimental attitude  The cornucopia of other ingredients that makes the hidden cuisine sing? Garlic, ginger, curry leaves, pepper, a restrained splash of oil and a pinch of Shanthis homemade masala powder. Ive always ground my own masala powder that I use in most of my dishes. Now I even grind up curry leaves into a powder so that my daughter and grandson eat it without picking it out, says Shanthi. Her experimental attitude to cooking also resulted in a vegan twist to the much-beloved Mudaliar classic aatu kaal paaya (Sheep Trotters curry) with mushroom substituting the protein. Debuting the dish as the main course in her six-course dinner with Chefathon, it was an absolute winner, with requests to recreate it at other events as well.  Muscle memory  A culinary journey of over 30 years, Shanthi admits to never writing down recipes now that it has almost become muscle memory. Often sharing the kitchen space with her daughter, it has also become a bonding activity between mother and daughter. I began enjoying cooking only when I began catering to several people as part of my daughters birthday parties. The smiles on satisfied faces is why I enjoy cooking, reminisces Shanthi. The more, the merrier, she adds. Just as we wrap up, her husband, whom she calls her biggest critic, walks in for lunch.

Against the backdrop of the slowdown, the states estimated growth rate is higher than Indias, which is 5%. According to the report, the states growth rate in 2018-19 was 6%, 1.5 percentage points down from the previous Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) governments estimate of 7.5%.  The industries and services sectors have taken a hit as they are expected to grow by 3.3% and 7.6 % respectively, against last years (2018-19) growth of 5.5% and 8.1%. The agriculture sector, however, is expected to register growth of 3.1%, up from the negative of 2.2% registered the previous year owing to the 112% rainfall in the monsoon.  The fall in the estimated growth rate of the gross state domestic product (GSDP) has been attributed to the losses the industries and services sector are expected to suffer.  The GSDP for 2019-20 is expected to be 28,78,583 crore.  It was 26,32,792 crore in 2018-19 and 23,82,570 crore in 2017-18.  The average share of the state contribution to the countrys gross domestic product (GDP) is expected to be 14.3%, the survey has stated.  The per capita income in the state is estimated to be 2.08 lakh, up from 1.92 lakh in 2018-19 and 1.75 lakh in 2017-18.  Maharashtra is fifth in per capita income in the country, with Haryana, Karnataka, Telangana and Tamil Nadu ahead of them.  The states revenue deficit is expected to be 20,293 crore (0.7% of GSDP) and fiscal deficit 61,670 crore (2.1% of GSDP). The states debt is estimated to be 4,71,642 crore in 2019-20 and is expected to touch the 5-lakh crore mark in the 2020-21 budget to be presented on Friday by finance minister Ajit Pawar.  The industrial investment in the state was dismal as the state could only attract investment of 37 crore till August 2019, against the projected investment of 26,540 crore. There was actual investment of 1,976 crore in 2018, against the projected investment of 86,163 crore. The total employment in the state dropped from 73.50 lakh in 2018 to 72.03 lakh in 2019.  Although Maharashtra attracted highest (29%) of foreign direct investment (FDI) among states in two decades, the investment through industrial projects in Maharashtra was less than Gujarat and Karnataka. The FDI inflows in 2019-20 was 25,316 crore, against 80,013 core in 2018-19 and 86,244 crore in 2017-18. The FDI investment in the state between April 2000 and September 2019 was 7,39,306 crore, against 2.57 lakh crore in Karnataka, 1.83 lakh crore in Tamil Nadu, 1.41 lakh crore in Gujarat and 1.09 lakh crore in Andhra Pradesh.  Production of cereals and pulses is expected to increase by 43% and 23%, while the production of oilseeds and cotton is expected to rise by 1% and 24% respectively. The production has gone up substantially in kharif season, despite the drop in sowing  149.61 lakh hectares in 2019-20, against 153.44 lakh hectares last time. Rabi crops of cereals and pulses is expected to increase by a whopping 43% and 23%. Satisfactory rainfall in the 2019 monsoon (112.6% of the average in 2019 and against the 73.6% in 2018) has helped better production and productivity in kharif and rabi seasons due to better irrigation potential and soil moisture. The production would have been better had a few districts not witnessed floods in August last year, said an official from the agriculture department.  The kharif production of pulses, including moong, udad, are expected to register a drop by 30% and 17%, while the drop in production of groundnut and sesame is 12% and 68% respectively. Rabi production of oilseeds is expected to be a negative 24 %, with sunflower, rapeseed and mustard witnessing the highest reduction in production. The survey has remained silent once again on the percentage of gross irrigated area against gross cropped area. As per the percentage registered in 2000-01, the irrigation average of the state is 17.8%.  Compared to the earlier two years, the offences registered against women were 37,567 in 2019, against 35,497 in 2018 and 31,997 in 2017, the report stated.  Congress leader and public works department (PWD) minister Ashok Chavan has blamed the BJP for the drop in industrial investment in Maharashtra. The BJP governments in state and at the Centre gave favourable treatment to Gujarat over Maharashtra, be it industrial investment or air services. Centre is spending crores on bullet train, besides shifting the International Financial Centre to Gujarat, to safeguard the interest of the neighbouring state. BJP should be blamed for this, he said.  Meanwhile, former finance minister Sudhir Mungantiwar said, Instead of blaming us, the MVA government should take the blame for fall in growth rate. They have been in power for the past four months now. We did get only two months in office last year as the remainig period was under code of conduct for two elections. Rather than anything else, the drop in the growth rate is due to the negative sentiments among the people after the MVA government has taken over.  Ajit Pawar said, The findings in the economic survey reports are alarming and worrisome. Owing to the wrong policies of the previous government, almost all the sectors have witnessed the fall in growth. We will ensure that the state is back on track and regain its top position.  The growth rates of Maharashtra in the previous seven fiscals were 6.1% (2012-13): 6.9% (2013-14); 6.3% (2014-15); 7.2% (2015-16); 9.2% (2016-17); 6.5% (2017-18) and 6.0% (2018-19).",MUSTARD OIL

Non-vegetarian food is prohibited, the meal chart at ITBP reads.But what is burning a hole in the ITBPs pockets is the prohibitive cost of sanitisers, a 500ml bottle of which comes for Rs 550.An inmate under quarantine uses up to three bottles of sanitisers a day. We have to take every precaution as safety in quarantine is paramount. We are leaving nothing to chance, said Joshi.The ITBP also uses highgrade disposable polypropylene and polystyrene cutlery to feed each individual under quarantine. Officials said that 12 doctors are on stand-by at the facility.For each doctor, personal protective equipment (PPE) such as a suit, thermometer gun and pulse-oximeter is required. But the amount for this hasnt been ascertained as supplies come from various pharmacists, said an official.With the government likely to initiate evacuation measures in countries like Iran, and with India recording new cases every day, the facility is likely to remain functional for a while.",MUSTARD OIL

An analyst from Odisha, Abinas lives and works in Hyderabad, and had done his preparation well. He wanted to make a statement  not for himself or his cooking skills, but for Odishas cuisine which is rarely spoken of. Abinass love to create regional food and present it with an Instagram-worthy twist, has drawn a lot of followers. They know what to expect of him  so much so that when he repeatedly used his water straw morha to present his dishes, they wanted more.  Abinas went on to use his expertise to create dishes not commonly found on restaurant menus. I decided to make the Chicken Besara, a dish made with an Oriya signature mustard paste base. I used black and white mustard seeds to make a paste along with cumin, chilli, and garlic. I presented it with rice and the judges polished it off. After which I was simply told, You are selected. No questions asked, no interview. I was dumbfounded. Seeing other participants go through 30-minute interviews, I was quite nervous,says Abinas, speaking over phone from Mumbai, where he is with his family to celebrate his win.  Abinas is all for experimentation: he is not just about the Odia pakhla bhaat and ghugni; nor is he one to constantly debate on the GI tag for rasagulla. He has attempted a chocolate variant of the traditional rasagulla; has made chicken drumsticks and kebabs on betel leaves, among many others. A self-taught food stylist and techie, Abinas was also the recipient of the Lokicooks Fellowship 2019.  All worthwhile  Going back to his days at the Masterchef kitchen, Abinas recollects it to be humongous and gruelling. He admits that he found the experience overwhelming at times. But it was all worthwhile once the task was completed. We would spend over 10 hours in the kitchen preparing, brainstorming, discussing, and learning at the same time. The most daunting task on the show was the Republic Day episode. We were to make 15 thalis with 100 dishes from different regions of India, he recollects.  Abinas credits his interest in cooking to his grandmother Jashoda with whom he spent most of his middle school years in Aska near Behrampur. He is now busy attending events at catering and hotel management institutions to discuss food. He doesnt plan to start a restaurant yet, but is sure to do so in the future. For now, I plan to document lesser-known cuisines of India, he adds.  Abinas runs us through his winning dish: My contender was strong and highly talented. So, for the grand finale, I decided to use all what I learned from the chefs I met, and the judges. For the final cook-off, I went all regional with flavours. I made prawn ceviche with a tempering of the Oriya pago and ambula. I also made vermicelli-coated prawn fry. This was a starter. For the main course, I picked a lost Odia recipe, the Oda mangsho (ginger lamb). I presented desi flavoured lamb shanks in an international style with mulberry, ginger, lemon honey vinaigrette, and balsamic ginger reduction. Ginger was the show-stopper flavour.",MUSTARD OIL

NEW DELHI: Unseasonal rains and hailstorms on Friday damaged standing Rabi crops (mainly mustard and wheat) in many districts of Haryana, Punjab, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh .  Reports from the ground suggested that many farmers in these states suffered more than 50% damage to their standing crops as heavy rains and hailstorm covered vast stretch from Jodhpur to Jammu and from Sikar to Varanasi.  The rains specifically hailstorm caused extensive damage of wheat, mustard, gram, vegetable. The initial estimate of damage is 40% in wheat, 55% in mustard and 50% in vegetable. The worst affected districts are Rohtak, Sikar, Aligarh, Agra, Shamli and Lucknow, said Lucknow-based farm expert Sudhir Panwar .  He said, Like any other biological entity, agriculture crops are sensitively synchronised with weather conditions. Adverse conditions at maturity stage results into irreversible damage. This Rabi season is becoming harsher and uneconomic for farmers after four years.  Reports suggested heavy loss of mustard in Rewari district . Rains and hailstorm even flattened wheat crop, causing yield losses on account of winds across Haryana and Punjab.  A special girdawri (crop loss inspection) by the state government needs to be done at the earliest. Secondly, it needs to be ensured that the insurance companies cover each and every complaint of crop loss (localised) and that the inspections for hailstorm are also done at the earliest, said another farm expert Ramandeep Singh Mann .  It is learnt that the agriculture ministry would soon send a team of officials to affected areas to assess the extent of damage and crop loss.  Besides Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh, other states too may face similar situation as the India Meteorological Department (IMD) has predicted moderate scattered to fairly widespread rainfall over Odisha, West Bengal, Sikkim, Bihar, Jharkhand , Vidarbha, Chhattisgarh and northeastern states till Saturday.",MUSTARD OIL

This subtle change in the wind direction becomes an emotion for someone whose biological clock is set to seasons and the movements of the sun. Every year when westerlies start and there is a profusion of flowers all over  mango trees blossom and butterflies moult in abundance  I am reminded of the way Pachhua was celebrated back home in Banaras. There is another local name for westerlies  Fagunahta, meaning Faagun winds. Falgun or Fagun is the month of Holi by the Hindu calendar.  In fact spring is celebrated with a string of festivals in Banaras. It starts from Basant Panchami, then comes Shivratri when the Shiva devotees offer scented gulal to the Shivling as a ritual. Shivratri is the day when Shiva married Parvati and the city celebrates the communion of Shakti with Shiva. This is the time when the world famous Dhrupad mela is organised to celebrate the season of new colours and fragrances. Raag Khamaj reverberates in the air during this time as music lovers congregate from all over the world and listen to the ragas of the season. The playful Horis waft in the air if you walk along the Ganga ghats. It wont be a surprise if you hear some boatman singing Hori in the most rustic yet soulful way. Hori and Phagua are the names for the Holi songs sung in semi-classical traditions. You have to be in the old city of Banaras if you want to experience the festival of Holi with all your senses. In fact there is a name for the euphoria induced by the season, Faag, almost synonymous with a drunken state of mind. There is indeed a real hallucination of bhaang as well. The tradition of bhaang and thandai on Holi is because it was the favourite drink of lord Shiva and is considered prasad on the day. Bhaang ke pakode is a Holi specialty in Banaras.  Rang Bhari Ekadashi welcomes the festival in full force when lord Shiva brings his new bride home to Kashi and devotees welcome the happy couple with colours. Holi is a season in Banaras and between Rang Bhari Ekadashi and the day of Holika dahan, there are several celebrations indicating the welcome of spring and ritualistic burning of all the bodily sins. The full moon day after Holika dahan is the day when everyone wears new clothes and there are community feasts and colours.  The colours for Holi, back in the day, were prepared with real flowers and other aromatic substances. In fact people in Banaras offer gulal and ittar together to Shiva during the Shivratri rituals. The season of Holi concludes with a folk festival called Budhva Mangal, where some elderly music lovers congregate on large houseboats and music performances, poetry recitals and bhaang parties happen with gay abundance.  Bhaang ki Pakodi  Ingredients:  Bhaang: 100 gm  Green chillies (minced): 4-5  Besan: 200 gm  Rice flour: 50 gm  Salt:  tsp  Turmeric powder:  tsp  Mustard oil: 200 ml  Method: Rinse the bhaang leaves and chop them fine. Mix with all the other ingredients except the oil and pour 80-100 ml water slowly to make a batter. Heat the oil, drop spoonfuls of the pakodi mix in the hot oil and fry till they become golden brown and crisp. Serve with chaat masala sprinkled on the hot pakodisp.

And, why not? To curb the spread of coronavirus restaurants and pubs are shut in many cities, most of us have also voluntarily stopped ordering takeouts, and our office managements have asked us to work from home  what better time to don the apron and pick up the ladle?  While all this enthusiasm is a great way to cope with the obvious gloom that the spreading coronavirus has cast in all our lives, nutritionists believe that it is not enough to eat home-cooked meals to build up a good immune system to combat the deadly virus. The meals we eat go a long way in creating a line of defence against Covid-19. There is currently no vaccination for the virus and the degree to which it can affect an individual depends greatly on that person's immune system. That is why the population above the age of 40 is at a greater risk as immunity tends to deteriorate with age  .  What Not to Eat  A lot has been said about what one should eat to boost immunity against coronavirus, but it is equally important to know what foods to eliminate from our diet, said Mumbai-based Gut Nutritionist, Janvi Chitalia. ""Any processed and packaged food, sugar inducing desserts like pastries, cakes or chocolates, fried dishes, foods with preservatives, carbonated drinks, as well as alcohol are things that should be minimised, or cut off from our diet at this point,"" said Chitalia.  ""These foods instantly bring down our immunity. For instance, if you have sugar in the form of desserts or refined white sugar, our immunity drops by about 60 to 70 per cent in the next two to three hours. This type of sugar intake is just empty calories with no nutritional value,"" she added.  Chitalia claimed that it may be prudent to take off those dishes from the meals that one would generally go out to eat, or order as take-outs, because they will not help in immunity building at all. However, that doesn't mean one should stop making interesting dishes (and posting their photos on Instagram) but all they have to do is opt for healthy alternatives.  ""For instance, instead of a regular pizza, people can make cauliflower almond crust pizzas or even a simple homemade khakra pizza. They can also make oats kheer or a jaggery ladoo rather than baking cakes. They should look at healthier alternatives,"" suggested Chitalia.  The Poultry Problem  In India, due to widespread misinformation, many people have stopped eating chicken. The prices of chicken have dropped by 60 per cent in March, despite poultry being one of the primary sources of Vitamin B6, as well as protein, which are both required to boost immunity.  ""We have no research or evidence till date to corroborate that cooked meat will harm in any way, or transmit coronavirus,"" said Vandita Jain, Delhi-based Nutritionist and an Assistant Professor (Guest Faculty) at the Delhi University, where she teaches food technology and nutrition.  "" Also, the general principle, irrespective of whether or not there is a virus scare doing rounds is to not have raw meat or any raw animal product. This is more of a safety guideline to avoid cross-contamination because we are not aware of what levels of hygiene our food handlers are observing,"" said Jain.  ""Because many people have stopped eating chicken, it is important for them to know that if they were dependent on meat diets until now, they are definitely compromising on their protein intake and, in turn, hurting their immunity. If that is the case, they should take quick actions to supplement their protein intakes,"" she added.  Chitalia agreed with Jain and stated, ""If someone is constantly afraid of eating meat, then his/her body will not digest it properly anyway. It is important to eat in the right state of mind, so if it bothers them (although there is no reason to be bothered), they might look at the vegetarian options. Anything from pulses and legumes can work, and people who want to stick to vegan sources can have almond and coconut milk for protein. Nuts and seeds are also a great source of protein,"" she said.  Building Blocks of Immunity  Right now we need enhanced immunity, not just optimal, but a little over suboptimal immunity, and therefore eating right is absolutely crucial to building immunity, pointed out Chitalia.  ""Vitamin C, Vitamin B6 and Vitamin E are all essential immunity boosters, but Vitamin C is definitely the primary one,"" said Jain.  ""According to Indian food composition table by the National Institute of Nutrition, Vitamin C can be found in sweet lime (mosambi), orange pulp, lemon juice, ripe papaya, guava (both pink and white), as well as gooseberry (amla). The general notion that whatever is citrus would only have vitamin C is misguided because foods like strawberries, bell pepper, capsicum, bathua (Chenopodium), and mustard are also important sources of Vitamin C."" added Jain. Vitamin B6 is majorly found in poultry as well as whole grains, which are also potent immunity boosters.  ""Instead of rice, it is better to opt for whole grains like nachni and bajra to boost immunity,"" said Chitalia.""Rice breaks down simply to sugar because it is starch and therefore, it carries a lot more sugar, than fibre. Whole grains, on the other hand, are highly fortified in iron, calcium, minerals as well as selenium and zinc, which are important micronutrients that can boost immunity,"" she added.  Pumpkin seeds, nuts such as walnuts, almonds as well as green leafy vegetables are also good sources of zinc, while two brazil nuts alone can supplement the entire intake of selenium in our bodies, pointed out Chitalia.  ""If someone is particularly vulnerable, or has very low immunity, perhaps they should think about taking supplements. Things such as multivitamins are easily available and definitely helpful,"" said Jain. Other supplements that are good to have are Vitamin B12, as well as D3, pointed out Chitalia.  Importance of Gut Immunity  ""75 per cent of our immunity lies in our large intestines. So, anything from our moods to metabolisms, to emotions and hormones are controlled by the gut,"" said Chitalia, who is a gut nutritionist.  If our stomachs are not clear, that too lowers the immunity. A great way to address this problem is to use spices that are readily available at home. ""For instance, half a teaspoon of jeera (cumin), a pinch of ajwain (bishop's weed, or carom), and hing ( asafoetida ), along with half a teaspoon of sauf (fennel), in warm water is an effective way to keep the motions going, and ensuring gut immunity, said Chitalia.  ""Probiotics are also important for immunity. Since we generally tend to eat out nowadays, most of us have altered our microbiome, which means that the balance of good bacteria is lesser than the bad bacteria, and that's why our immunity grows low. So eating curd, yoghurt can help because they have probiotics."" she added.  People who cannot tolerate lactose, can eat fermented vegetables, or make fermented pickles at home. That's an easy way to have food with live bacteria (probiotics). If people want to make kimchi or cabbage kombucha at home, those are doable options as well.  Immunity for All?  While we can afford to spend on the right kind of food, not everyone around us has that kind of privilege. Despite our social distancing, people who are perhaps regularly frequenting you home are our cooks or house helps, and they are at a greater risk of contracting the virus because their immunity is generally low.  So, you can not only share certain foods that are immunity boosters to help them stay healthy, but also teach them to eat a few things that aren't particularly expensive, but great for building immunity.  ""Simple things that are available in every Indian kitchen can help in a big way in building immunity. Turmeric, black pepper, neem leaves, cinnamon can help in boosting immunity. Turmeric milk can also help in strength building. It is also good to have garlic because it has healthy anti-microbial properties."" said Jain.  ""Of course kitchen herbs are a good source of immunity and are also very affordable like ginger or tulsi leaves which many people have easy access to, because many households have tulsi plants,"" pointed out Jain.  Keep Calm and Gain Immunity  A big part of building immunity is to avoid stress at all cost. At a time when so many people are bring affected by the deadly virus, it is important to remember not to panic. ""If you want to know how to eat healthily and build immunity, instead of heeding to rumours, you should know the correct sources from which you can gather information,"" said Jain.  ""World Health Organisation (WHO), Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), the National Institute of Nutrition in Hyderabad and Nutrition Society of India are all trustworthy sources. If these institutions are quoted as sources, then chances of the information being true are obviously greater,"" she added.  ""Stress and lack of sleep are the most common factors for weak immunity. We need to tackle it carefully, without panicking about the current situation. Lack of sleep is obviously closely related to immunity because if you are not sleeping well, you are directly creating stress and tension and weaning off our immunity. So sleeping well is a must,"" said Jain.  Meditation is also a great way to build resilience, said Chitalia. ""Even five minutes of meditation can help in calming down the body. Diaphragmatic breathing can also be a useful tool to help people sleep better."" For stress release, one can also opt for exercises like yoga, and find creative outlets like journaling to cope with the situation better.  How Quickly Can You Acquire Immunity?  The most amazing thing about our bodies is that they are very adaptive. When you start eliminating bad food, it takes about two to four days for our gut microbiome to alter, said Chitalia.  ""The moment you start eating right you will start getting better than what you were when you were eating unhealthy food, or food that were not providing our bodies with the right nutrients. How long it will take to build up a solid immune system depends on various factors like age group, digestive conditions, a pre-existing illness like diabetes, etc. But, building up immunity is our only chance to have a clear line of defence ready so that in case you contract the virus, you can fight it better."" she added.",MUSTARD OIL

(Photo: Thinkstock Images) Our immunity is the special force that protects us from diseases and almost two-thirds of it resides in the gut. (Photo: Thinkstock Images)  Some simple common sense can help guard against coronavirus. While a healthy diet is important, addressing digestion and gut health  the ground zero of immune defence  is critical. Our immunity is the special force that protects us from diseases and almost two-thirds of it resides in the gut. To fight any virus, one needs to provide the macrophages (defence cells) of our body with energy through butyrate. Found in traditional fats such as butter and desi ghee, butyrate helps rebuild the inside lining of the gut.  To strength our bodys defence forces, we can also follow some other simple measures  1. Eat a wide variety of foods, including root vegetables. Certain fibres present in psyllium husk, sweet potato and other tubers act as prebiotics, promoting the growth of good bacteria in the gut. A diverse range of colourful fruits and vegetables provide disease-fighting phytonutrients to the body. Fermented foods such as kanji, kefir, kombucha, and chhach also provide a medium for growth of good bacteria in the gut.  2. Consume high-quality pro-biotics. Oil pulling, traditional practice with virgin coconut oil or cold-pressed mustard oil, helps improve gut flora naturally.  3. Focus on boosting your bodys Vitamin C, D, B-complex, and zinc levels. Some preliminary research indicates that Vitamin D may be more effective than flu vaccine in flu prevention. Use supplements only after consulting a qualified professional.  4. Stick to an alkaline diet. Coronavirus survives comfortably at a pH level of 6.0, which is slightly acidic. However, some research suggests that the virus cannot survive in an alkaline state, even as low as 8.0. (A pH of 7.0 is considered neutral). To make your diet alkaline include plenty of fresh fruits, coconut water and vegetables. Avoid excess dairy, meats and sugar.  5. Include fresh garlic, organic honey, black pepper, ginger, basil (tulsi), cinnamon, cloves, turmeric, gilloy, fenugreek seeds and amla in your diet.  6. Drink plenty of fluids, including water and warm soups, to prevent dehydration.  7.

(Express Photo by Abhinav Saha) Coronavirus outbreak: At vegetable, fruit market in Sahibabad, near Delhi. (Express Photo by Abhinav Saha)  AHEAD of Prime Minister Narendra Modi announcing a 21-day countrywide lockdown to contain the spread of COVID-19, long queues had formed on highways of trucks carrying essential goods and commodities, including medicines, milk, fruits and vegetables, by Tuesday, hours into several states sealing borders. While goods trains fall in the exempted category, freight services too were hit as states did not mention Railways as essential service in their respective orders.  With confusion at the lower levels about exemptions, transport even within states was hit. Big online grocers such as Grofers and Big Basket too were left scrambling to ensure sustenance of their supply chains.  Grofers CEO Albinder Dhindsa tweeted that their warehouse in Faridabad had been shut by officials, while Big Basket announced on its mobile app that they were not operational due to restrictions. A senior Big Basket official told The Indian Express police had stopped their logistics partners across the country. Amazon India said in a blog post that it was prioritising delivery of products to those needed most during the pandemic.  Online pharmacy 1mgs co-founder Prashant Tandon reported about 17-18 incidents of its delivery personnel being beaten up in Hyderabad, Delhi, Mumbai, Lucknow, and Bengaluru. Freshtohome also said its personnel were being assaulted. Flipkart Supermart delayed delivery slots due to an unforeseen increase in demand, while fruits and vegetable suppliers on Swiggy were found unserviceable on Tuesday.  Shops were seen closed in Mumbai. (Express Photo) Shops were seen closed in Mumbai. (Express Photo)  The Railways has informed the Cabinet Secretary about its staff, working to keep around 5,000 freight trains in operations, being stopped from reporting to duty, with all divisions affected to varying degrees. Law enforcement agencies are telling our workers, labourers and others engaged in freight activities that all trains are cancelled so there can be no exemption for any railway worker. Then there are places where they are saying that only movement of essential commodities will be allowed, though all goods trains stand exempted as per the Union governments instructions, a top government official told The Indian Express.  Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi admitted disruption in supply of essential items. We get rice from West Bengal, pulses from Katni and Satna in Madhya Pradesh, and mustard oil from Rajasthan. Trucks are being stopped at inter-state borders, he told The Indian Express.  Kultaran Singh Atwal, President, All India Motor Transport Congress, said most trucks were halted at borders of Bihar, West Bengal, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and some states in southern India. The government has locked everything down. Trucks are not being allowed to ply on roads If the transport chain breaks, it poses danger to the supply of essential commodities, he said, adding that drivers too were panicking, abandoning trucks at state borders to head to their native villages and towns. Once they go away, it is very difficult to get them back, he said.  The situation is further complicated because rail and air transport too is almost entirely shut down. While all-cargo flights are exempted from the government suspension of domestic flights effective Tuesday midnight, passenger aircraft account for 60% of cargo volumes handled by airlines. Without any passengers, the airlines dont make enough earnings to make up for the costs incurred to operate flights.  At ports, shipments from COVID-19-affected countries like China and Singapore are not being offloaded due to fear of the contagion. Several ports are facing shortage of trucks due to drivers not being available.  The Grofers CEO told The Indian Express they had a backlog of over 2.6 lakh orders. In a mail to customers, Grofers Head of Customer Experience Suneet Gupta wrote, Unfortunately, our delivery team has been held up at checkpoints and some of our warehouses have been locked by local authorities, as the situation due to Covid-19 remains very uncertain.  Apart from Faridabad, the company saw its warehouses being shut in Hyderabad, Pune, Mumbai, and Haryanas Sonepat. The Sonepat warehouse was shut Sunday and opened only Monday late night. The facility mostly caters to customers in North Delhi.  Dhindsa tweeted Tuesday, While we understand they (officials) are doing their duty, essential items will be denied to 20,000+ households in Faridabad and Delhi every day. We need help in sorting this out. Co-founder Saurabh Kumar also took to Twitter to talk about its trucks and delivery partners being stopped. Our delivery executives are selflessly putting their safety at risk to ensure people stay indoors and get all their essentials at home. Then they get stopped and harassed by police and local goons, he wrote.  Many who had ordered groceries and medicines on on Big Basket on Tuesday found no new delivery slots available until March 31.  Amazon India in its blog post said, To serve our customers most urgent needs while also ensuring safety of our employees, we are temporarily prioritizing our available fulfilment and logistics capacity to serve products that are currently critical for our customers such as Household Staples, Packaged Food, Health Care, Hygiene, Personal safety and other high priority products. This also means that we have to temporarily stop taking orders and disable shipments for lower-priority products.  Explained | Virus will stay; difficult to lock down for long  According to the feedback the Railways has got, each division is affected. Not just railway functionaries but labourers engaged in loading and unloading of freight and those operating clearance trucks are also being stopped. If in Sambhalpur division the situation is better, then in freight-heavy divisions like Waltair, its very bad. So, its everywhere, the railway official said.  The number of freight trains being run is already lower than usual in the current demand scenario.  Grofers asked RWAs and housing societies in NCR, Kolkata and Bengaluru to collaborate for zero touch deliveries by creating a drop zone in their colonies.  Shan Kadavil, CEO of Freshtohome, a meat and vegetable delivery start-up, said, We are facing huge issues. Modiji had called delivery people rajya rakshak, but unfortunately the information has not gone down to the police level. Our delivery people are getting harassed and beaten up We have taken all the necessary approvals, but it is a massive failure at the implementation level.

Why no curfew ?  Replying to media queries on why Haryana has only ordered a lockdown and not a curfew like in Punjab, Khattar said, Since Punjab has imposed a curfew, there might be such a situation in their state. But, if such a situation arises in Haryana too, we shall sit together and discuss the requirement. There is no such requirement of a curfew in Haryana, as of now.  He added, There is a difference between Janata Curfew and lockdown too. Without any administration/polices imposition, in whatever manner Janata Curfew was observed by people is commendableBut since social distancing is required, thus a statewide lockdown will be enforced Tuesday morning onwards. Khattar added, Banks and ATMs will remain open across the state. Essential services will continue.  On ration supplies  On the availability of ration supplies during the period of lockdown, Khattar said, Yesterday, I held a video conference with trader organisations across the state. Almost all of them have assured me that they have adequate ration supplies for the coming two months. If need be, government warehouses/stocks will also be utilised but government will not allow any shortage of ration supplies during the lockdown period.  On liquor vends  Liquor vends in Haryana continue to remain open despite a lockdown announced by the Chief Minister. Replying to medias queries on why liquor vends are open when crowds at these vends also pose risk of community transmission of the virus, Khattar said, These vends are open because closing them will lead to several other repercussions and problems. Thus, we have so far allowed the liquor vends to remain functional. But, yes the crowd formation at these vends should not be done. People do tend to throng these vends thinking that the government may shut these down tomorrow, but it is not the case as of now. The vends are open. People can make their purchases but should not be forming any crowd.  What all is shut ?  *No public transport services including taxis, auto-rickshaws. All interstate bus service also suspended.

(Source: File Photo) A balanced diet alone cannot be fruitful, unless food hygiene and healthy cooking practices are ensured. (Source: File Photo)  Undernutrition is the most widely prevalent risk factor for development of tuberculosis (TB) in India, as per Sandhya Pandey, chief clinical nutritionist, Fortis Memorial Research Institute, Gurugram. Not only this, it is the major driver of the TB epidemic in India contributing to around half of annual incidences. It impairs immunity and makes the patient vulnerable to multiple infections. Absence of nutrients in the diet can lead to drug-induced hepatotoxicity or drug-induced liver injury, death, relapse after the cure.  Measurements like Body Mass Index (BMI), dietary recall, weight loss history, pathology tests like haemoglobin are analysed to check the nutritional status of TB patients.  Significance of a balanced diet  Much like the importance of regular medication, TB patients and their caregivers need to understand the importance of nutritional requirements. Ones nutritional counselor should emphasise on consumption of a healthy balanced diet to attain the desired protein-intake for energy.  A balanced diet is one that contains an adequate quantity of the nutrients that we require in a day i.e. fats, proteins, carbohydrates, fibre, vitamins and minerals. Though there is no special diet or requirements for TB patients, a diet plan is created according to a persons BMI and physical activities, mentioned Pandey.  Energy requirements  TB patients have higher energy and protein requirements to refill the exhausted deposits from the body. As recovery occurs, it is very important that patients do not remain completely sedentary, and engage in some physical activity (such as house chores and walking) as tolerated; since it helps build muscle mass and excess fat deposition should be avoided in the regained weight.  The proportion of carbohydrates in the diet recommended is 55-75 per cent of total energy intake, and this is derived from intake of cereals, pulses, roots and tubers and vegetables.  In India, major sources of carbohydrates are cereals like wheat, and rice, and local millets such as jowar, bajra and ragi (high in calcium content, especially recommended for children and lactating women).  Protein requirements  Ensure at least one-fourth of your plate is protein. (Source: File Photo) Ensure at least one-fourth of your plate is protein. (Source: File Photo)  The requirements of protein would be 1.2-1.5 g/kg ideal body weight per day. Proteins or the building components can be of animal or plant origin. Proteins of animal origin includes milk, eggs, and meat, whereas a mixture of vegetable proteins from cereals and pulses are available for vegetarians.  Fat requirements  These can comprise 15-30 per cent daily energy intake. Fats are present in oils, nuts, milk and milk products and meat. Groundnuts act as a good source of calories as well as protein. Soyabean oil, mustard oil, butter and ghee can also be taken in moderate amount.  Micronutrients  Anaemia is one of the most prevalent nutrient deficiency disease in TB patients. Micronutrients such as iron and folate, vitamin A, zinc, vitamin D are important for immunity development and fighting mechanism of the busy. Leafy vegetables and fruits are vital sources of vitamins and minerals and these should be a part of the daily diet with five-six servings in each day.  What should be avoided?   Skip tobacco in all forms.   Dont drink alcohol  it can add to the risk of liver damage from some of the drugs used to treat your TB.   Limit coffee and other caffeinated/carbonated drinks.   Limit excess use of spices and salt or refined products, like sugar, white breads, and white rice.  Food hygiene and cooking practices  A balanced diet alone cannot be fruitful, unless food hygiene and healthy cooking practices are ensured. Simple steps can avoid several infections like diarrhoea.  *Washing hands before cooking, eating and after using toilet.  *Cleaning vegetables and fruits before consuming.  *Cooking vegetables with a lid to preserve the nutritive value  *Cooking at controlled temperature to prevent destruction of nutrients.",MUSTARD OIL

The immune system responds to stress in a negative way. It responds similarly to worry, loneliness and sadness. A time-tested stressbuster is physical exercise of moderate intensity that you can undertake from the comfort of your home. Cooking  or the art of preparing food  is another excellent stressbuster, and now is a better time than any to experiment with it.  Previously I have discussed the various foods that support the immune system and protect us from the onslaught of disease. This week, I put together those recommendations in a sample meal plan. I have intentionally kept the plan simple and practical, so that it is easy to follow. Rushing to the grocery store in search of exotic foods is not something I would encourage you to do at this point in time.  Early morning:   Tulsi tea with ginger and 2-3 black peppercorns freshly crushed.   Almonds / peanuts / walnuts / cashews (20-25 g).  Breakfast:   Colourful fruit bowl (orange / kinnow / strawberry / guava).   Porridge / upma / poha with veggies and seeds.   Bowl of curd or glass of lassi / smoothie / spiced buttermilk.  Lunch:   Colourful salad bowl (carrot / onion / tomato / broccoli / capsicum / beetroot).   Roti with bajra or ragi flour, or khichdi, or vegetable rice.   Green leaves cooked in dal or as saag (the more the variety of leaves, the better it is).   Curd / raita with veggies or fruits.   Chutney (coconut / amla / garlic / tomato/ curry leaves).  Evening tea:   Nimbu pani / lemon tea / matcha tea / green tea with lemon.   2-3 tbsp roasted seed mixture / chaat prepared with boiled channa or sweet potato / sprouts.  Dinner:   Soup / Rasam (veggies and dal with spices)   Egg / tofu/ soy nuggets / paneer salad with veggies   Idli / appam / cheela with garlic chutney   Cinnamon apple salad  Bedtime:    cup milk with  tsp turmeric powder and a large pinch of black pepper  This plan can have many variations depending upon locally available foods.  Diet-related general instructions:   Include a range of brightly coloured fruits and veggies in your daily diet.   Infuse your pitcher of water with lemon slices / basil / tulsi / mint / lemongrass for an immunity boost.   Spinach is the most popular leafy vegetable but we are fortunate to have many others that are just as good, if not better. The leaves of amaranth, fenugreek and moringa provide great value. Never discard the leaves of pumpkin, beetroot, radish, cauliflower and colocasia. They are edible and nutritious and can be used in a variety of ways that I have enumerated in my piece on anaemia.   Roasted seeds are a great snack. Seeds of sesame, flax, watermelon, sunflower and pumpkin can be kept handy as snack options.   Use generously while cooking spices like turmeric, black pepper, fenugreek (methi) seeds, black cumin (kalonji) seeds, mustard seeds, cinnamon and asafoetida (hing). Garlic and onions are also value additions.   Consume every day a probiotic food or drink that contains at least 5 billion microorganisms.   Use a cooking oil with Omega 3 fatty acids.  Other factors besides diet that play a role in prevention:   Wash your hands with soap and water thoroughly, several times a day, scrubbing for at least 20 seconds.   Soak in the sun for the much-needed Vitamin D. Expose the limbs to the early morning sun for 15-20 minutes everyday.   Breathing and physical indoor exercises for 30 minutes everyday.   Sleep 6-8 hours as per your routine. You could nap for 30 minutes during the day when homebound. However, don't oversleep, as this is counterproductive.   Write a gratitude journal.   Make use of technology to stay connected with friends and family.",MUSTARD OIL

(Representational Image) Farmer leader Karam Singh Mathana said the government should allow smooth return of crop harvester machines from Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh. (Representational Image)  The Haryana governments announcement to delay procurement of wheat and mustard has made the the agrarian community a worried lot, especially about two factors  storage of crop and arrangement of finances for their next crop.  Officials said procurement of mustard usually starts from March 15 while wheat is procured from April 1. In the given circumstances, its not even certain whether procurement will take place from April 15 and 20. The government should immediately provide bags and plastic covers to farmers so that they can properly store their mustard and wheat crop, said Gurnam Singh Chaduni, president of Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU), Haryana.  Sonu Kaliramana, a farmer from Kinala village of Hisar district, told The Indian Express that he has already harvested his mustard crop of three acres. I have stored it in my house but now I am worried about how I will store my wheat crop. Kaliramna further says, In the absence of government procurement, our crops are procured at much lower prices by private players. For example, if I sell my mustard crop to a private player, I would have to face a loss ranging from Rs 600 to Rs 800 per quintal.  Chaduni said the government should provide Rs 10,000 per acre to farmers as interim relief, which can be adjusted after procurement of their crops. With this money, the farmers will be able to pay labour during the procurement season apart from meeting other domestic expenses, he added.  He also said that the government should allow functioning of shops which sell pesticides and fertilisers to farmers. There is requirement of pesticides and fertilisers for vegetables, sugarcane and sunflower crops, said Chaduni.  Farmer leader Karam Singh Mathana said the government should allow smooth return of crop harvester machines from Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh. As wheat harvesting season takes place early in Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh, the harvester machines are taken to these states from Haryana and Punjab. Now, the government must ensure that these machines return to Haryana and Punjab so farmers dont face problems in harvesting their wheat crop here, he added.  Congress demands bonus for farmers  Former Haryana chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda demanded announcement of a bonus for farmers keeping in view the delay in the procurement of wheat and mustard in the state. In statement on Thursday, Hooda said the government should find out ways to ensure harvesting of crops and their procurement during the lockdown period. The wheat crop is ready for harvesting, so the farmers cant wait for its harvesting and procurement for next 21 days, said Hooda.  Haryana Congress president Kumari Selja on Thursday urged the government to issue detailed guidelines for farmers on what can they do and what they cant do during the lockdown period.",MUSTARD OIL

(Express photo/Representational)  WHILE CROPS across the state are now ready for harvest, Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Thursday announced that the procurement process will begin after April 14, the day the nationwide lockdown to control the spread of the coronavirus ends.  Hence, mustard procurement in the state will begin on April 15, and wheat procurement will start from April 20, if the situation permits.  The CM assured that farmers will not be stopped from going to their fields and tending to their crops. He added that farmers will initially have to store the produce in their homes. State Agriculture Minister J P Dalal said, Farmers vehicles used for harvesting crops shall not be stopped on roads by the police.  We know that farmers annual income depends upon this harvest. Farmers need not worry. Government is committed to buying each and every grain and shall do it. There might be some delay since it is not possible till April 14Till then, farmers need to store the harvested crop in their homes. In case they are not able to do that, we have issued instructions to the marketing board to assist the government for creation of such facilities.

Chief District Agriculture Officer (CDAO) Santosh Ray said fertilizer and pesticide shops, that were closed since Janata curfew on March 22 and the succeeding lockdown, were opened on Thursday.  The shops would be open for two-and-a-half hours daily from 9.30 am to 12 noon. They have been asked to ensure social distancing among customers and proper sanitation.  The farmers are also required to maintain social distancing among labourers working on their land.  As per reports, paddy has been cultivated over around 14,630 hectare land during the current rabi season in the district.  Similarly, pulses including mung, biri, kulthi, cowpea, fieldpea and gram besides other pulses have been grown over 15,300 hectare land.  Oilseeds including groundnut, sesame, mustard and sunflower have been cultivated over 11,421 hectare land.  This apart, vegetable including potato, sweet potato and onion have been cultivated over 18,155 hectare land.  Similarly, condiments including chilli, garlic and coriander have been grown over 7,740 hectare. A farmer, Umesh Mishra of Satupali village in Dhankauda block said the farmers across the district were in a dilemma over closure of the fertilizer and pesticide shops.  However, the State Government has taken the right decision by opening the outlets. At present, standing paddy crops require fertiliser, he said.  Ray said transplantation of paddy seedlings was completed in the district before the lockdown.  With the opening up of the fertiliser shops, the farmers can start using both urea and potash fertiliser on their paddy field.  The non-paddy crops are in harvesting stage and farmers can harvest their crop by maintaining social distancing. Till date, there has been no report of pest attack, he added.

The Ministry of Home Affairs has issued a second addendum to its earlier guidelines relating to the nationwide lockdown.  Activities related to agriculture and related products, services and such other activities have been brought under the exception categories from the 21-day lockdown, said Principal Secretary of Agriculture and Farmers Empowerment Saurabh Garg. This will allow unhindered harvesting of summer crops and taking care of the vegetable crops which have suffered loss due to lockdown, he added. Rabi crops like black gram, moong, groundnut, mustard and sesame are ready for harvest.  After the lockdown, we prefer to go to our crop fields in the wee hours to avoid the police attention.

The homebaker in Kondapur, Hyderabad, decides to bake foccacia. As she powers through the recipe, kneading the dough and chopping garlic, she realises she needs some basil. Rather than risking a grocery run, she simply reaches over to her kitchen garden and grabs a few tender leaves.  Many of us know full well that a final sprinkle of green garnishes can make a dish complete. Many people across the country find themselves hunting for such herbs during the ongoing Coronavirus lockdown. Caused by panic-buying and stockpiling, there is a scarcity in the greens which are so crucial to Indian cuisines, despite diligent efforts of supermarkets to keep their shelves stocked. Plus, e-commerce platforms such as BigBasket or Amazon Pantry are facing restrictions with their movements for deliveries.  Arundati Rao shares four types of basil she grows | Photo Credit: Instagram  That said, the kitchen garden has never been more valuable. Often separate from the ornamental garden, a kitchen garden comprises fruit, vegetables, greens and microgreens, and in India, we often see them on balconies, window sills, terraces or even inside a room. In the case of the lockdown, it boosts your households access to fresh food while keeping you at home. Before you run outside to procure seeds and gardening inventory, we share advice and important information from experts in the industry as well as people who have long nurtured their kitchen gardens.  Arundati is no stranger to kitchen gardens. Having had her kitchen garden off and on for about 10 years, she currently has two kinds of beans, sweet potato, lots of herbs, green onion, garlic shoots, three kinds of tomatoes, ridge gourd, bottle gourd, chillies and brinjal. She uses these in her day-to-day cooking and, during the lockdown, she finds herself able to plan her quotidian meals as before.  Ravi Krishnamacharys kitchen garden includes mosambi, pineapple and pomegranate | Photo Credit: Ravi Krishnamachary  In Sainikpuri, Hyderabad, Ravi Krishnamachary is two years into his kitchen garden. He was inspired by Hyderabads All India Horticulture expo advocating terrace gardens and, having retired recently, he was in search of a productive hobby. Now he grows colocasia, curry leaves and tomatoes among other things. We are too affected by the lockdown, food wise, because we eat what we grow. Our routine in that regard has not changed. It really does well for the long run to have a kitchen garden. You become prepared for anything.  Carrots from Sujatha Ravis terrace garden in Besant Nagar, Chennai  Sixty-year-old Sujatha Ravi in Besant Nagar, Chennai, says she is not rushing to the vegetable market for fresh produce; she just has to source it all from her terrace garden which is filled with various keerai, ladys fingers, pomegranates, papayas, strawberries and more. Ive had my kitchen garden for four and half years. After the lockdown is over, I want to start growing microgreens. I completely cook in one-pot-one-shot, a method which doesnt kill the vegetable. It retains the colour and nutrition, and motivates you to grow more. At the markets, they segregate it with their feet so you have to wash them well. So that is another reason to maintain your own kitchen garden.  Alladi Mahadevan, the founder of TheOrganicFarm.in, says one does not need to look beyond their home for a gardening kit. For 25 years, Alladi's organisation has advocated urban farming across Tamil Nadu and, he says he is available for remote assistance during lockdown. The average Indian household has about 83 food items and about 20 of those can be used to procure seeds. Make sure you can access good soil and patience. Plan your calendar and use as much as possible. Alladi recommends growing greens as a priority, as well as pulses and legumes, as they are packed with nutrients. Also, to speed up germination, one can soak methi seeds overnight and crush coriander seeds before sowing.  At the moment, Instagram, YouTube and Facebook are brimming with kitchen gardening tips and tricks. A set of them, posted to Instagram on March 26, comes from Hyderabad startup HomeCrop which helps people engineer their own kitchen gardens. Co-founder Manvitha Reddy agrees that this is the time for home farming to shine, adding, In the 1990s, when Cuba was in a lockdown, they had to resort to community farming. They eventually became quite self-sufficient. Similarly here, the skill for such farming methods must be appreciated, even if on a hobby level.  A case for microgreens  Of course, while the lockdown has restricted their services to some extent, Manvitha says they are offering virtual and remote assistance to customers. In the lockdown, I think we can focus on microgreens which boost immunity, have high nutritional value and are easy and quick to grow. Essentially seedlings of edible vegetables and herbs, microgreens are harvested just after the cotyledon leaves have developed. They are deemed as both a superfood and a functional food. Powerhouse microgreens include pea shoots, wheatgrass, radish sprouts and sunflower shoots.  Ravi Krishnamacharys batch of mint leaves | Photo Credit: Ravi Krishnamachary  Arundati adds that, if these are available at home, one should start with fresh well-aerated soil and then mix in coco peat and Vermicompost. Remember not to over water your pots. A lot of times we kill our plants by over-watering that leads to root rot. Ravi is also an advocate for coco peat for its water retention properties.  Both Manvitha and Arundati say that one need not even leave their home to get seeds. Seeds such as those of coriander, mustard and methi are already in your kitchen. You can also repurpose cartons from past deliveries or plastic water bottles in which to grow these, says Manvitha.  Arundati comments that the versatility and sustainability of these greens are impressive and worth the effort. Mustard greens can be cooked or eaten in salads, the flavour is similar to Arugula lettuce. Methi is so easy to grow and the small leaves can be harvested in about 7 to 10 days... Crush whole coriander before sowing for fresh coriander leaves from your window sill. Sprouted onions and garlic bulbs can be planted for fresh greens to be cooked or eaten raw or added to omelette or curries. Store-bought mint can be replanted as it loves the hot weather.  On a happy note  Arundati Rao also grows her own herbs for her culinary classes | Photo Credit: Instagram  There is a notable feel-good factor in this way of life, says Manvita. People tend to eat more happily when they know what goes into the process. Its also really therapeutic given these difficult times, it doesnt just distract but it adds productivity to your day when you tend to feel a little low, being at home.  Arundati affirms, Its therapeutic to snip lemon grass stalks for tea or just a few leaves of basil for your pasta instead of buying a whole packet and not knowing what to do and invariably wasting everything.  Sujatha says when she digs into the soil and sees the full ecosystem created, she sees plenty of hope for the planet. The idea of gardening is close to the idea of renewal, she concludes, and about leading out into the light of the new, adding Do not be intimidated by a kitchen garden, it is more rewarding and brings happiness to the home, especially in this difficult time.  Many people feel intimidated by the thought of starting a kitchen garden owing to the responsibility and patience required. But Ravi says the satisfaction of knowing the precious produce harvested trumps any hesitation. Arundati adds that it is not that hard, But there are no promises. It's trial and error and like everything else you learn and become better with practice. Manvitha concludes that once lockdown is lifted, people will be more proactive about kitchen gardens; in fact, shes gotten quite a few calls about it in the past couple of weeks.",MUSTARD OIL

Hotel, Restaurants and Cafeterias (HoReCa) segment accounts for 40 per cent of the country's total edible oil demand at 230 lakh tonnes annually.  Edible oil imports and processing activities have also slowed down, but there is sufficient stock in the country to meet domestic demand, Solvent Extractors' Association of India (SEA) Executive Director B V Mehta told PTI.  ""Our monthly consumption of edible oil is 18-19 lakh tonnes per month. The demand will certainly fall as hotels, restaurants and cafeterias have closed down,"" Mehta said.  He, however, said it would be difficult to estimate the extent of fall as household consumption might increase slightly during lockdown period.  Mehta said imports of vegetable oils (comprising edible and non edible oil) too have slowed down, but there is no concern about availability.  ""We have sufficient stock of imported oil. Local production of mustard oil is happening. Harvesting of mustard crop is going on in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, so all local processing mills are operating,"" Mehta said.  He said there is some labour shortage and logistics issues but those are getting sorted out. India's total demand for edible oil is around 230 lakh tonnes annually, which is largely being met through imports.  The country imports palm oil from Malaysia and Indonesia, while shipments of soyabean come from Argentina and Brazil.  India's vegetable oil imports increased by 3.5 per cent to 155.5 lakh tonnes in 2018-19 marketing year (November-October).  While shipments of edible oil increased to 149.13 lakh tonnes in the 2018-19 marketing year from 145.16 lakh tonnes in the previous year, the imports of non-edible oil grew to 6,36,159 tonnes from 5,09,748 tonnes during the period under review.  During the November 2019 to February 2020 period of the current oil year, imports have fallen by 6.1 per cent to 45,63,791 tonnes compared to 48,62,849 tonnes in the corresponding period of the previous year.",MUSTARD OIL

In India, it is the indigenous herb giloy (guduchi) that is much sought after in these times. In addition to that, there are many other herbs and spices that have immune-boosting properties and are being sold as supplements. The use of supplements in the time of a pandemic is very important, but it surely cannot substitute a good daily diet. Supplements of any kind play a role over and above the everyday diet to either fill in any gaps or to boost certain functions in the body. At the very least, the body needs energy and nourishment from food to perform its most basic functions. Supplements alone can never be good enough.  Our immune system has a rather complex structure, with two arms  innate immunity and adaptive immunity. The innate immune system comprises many different kinds of cells, each that perform a different role. These are macrophages, neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils, mast cells, natural killer cells and dendritic cells. The adaptive immune system has the B-cells and T-cells. For the coordinated functioning of so many different cells, a regular and balanced supply of nutrients is crucial. A wholesome and varied diet that includes all the food groups is what can enable a good immune function.  The bright colours of fruits and vegetables are phytochemicals that also play a part in the immunity-building story. Some of the players in this business are Vitamin C, Vitamin D and zinc (I had discussed some of their food sources in my piece last week). In addition to these nutrients, Omega 3 fats also play a vital role in building immunity. Dietary fats are typically associated with heart health and obesity, but its about time we explored their immunity-boosting function.  The good sources of Omega 3 fats are fatty fish that are easily found in India  hilsa, katla, surmai, black pomfret. Salmon, sardines and tuna are other worthy sources of the fatty acid. For the vegetarians, the good Omega 3 fat sources are pulses (dals). Rajma, cowpea (lobia), soybean and black gram (whole urad dal) are the richest sources among the dals. The seeds of flax, fenugreek (methi), mustard and sesame are also high on this fat. These seeds can be used in vegetable preparations either as whole seeds or in the powdered or paste form. Flaxseeds are best powdered and added to porridges, flour to make chapatis, or even desserts.  Among the cereals, its bajra, ragi, quinoa and wheat that contain this fat. All leafy vegetables are worthwhile additions to boost the Omega 3 content of the diet. Of all the leaves, the highest amounts are found in amaranth leaves of all three varieties (red, green and mixed), mustard leaves, radish leaves, spinach leaves, pumpkin leaves, colocasia leaves, drumstick leaves, cauliflower greens and beet greens.  Choose a cooking oil that contains the Omega 3 fatty acids. Good choices in this category are the oils of soy, mustard, sesame, rice bran and canola. Ensuring that the diet has enough Omega 3 sources from foods is an integral part of immunity-building.  Neelanjana Singh Nutrition Therapist & Wellness Consultant",MUSTARD OIL

The lockdown in Haryana may be extended beyond April 14, Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar hinted Tuesday while addressing people to apprise them about governments efforts to combat COVID-19. Haryana has already announced delaying the crop procurement, which will now be done in a staggered manner from April 15 till June 30.  This time, we have changed the crop procurement timetable  mustard procurement from April 15 and wheat procurement from April 20, which is a few days late as compared to previous years. Still, I request my farmer brothers not to show any haste in bringing their crop to mandis. They should try to store maximum of their harvested crop in their homes or use any other modes of storage available. Because, this difficulty, we hope will end on April 14. But due to some reasons, if it extends for a few more days, then your support is expected. While selling our crop is a necessity, yet our priority is to get rid of coronavirus pandemic. This is our bigger aim, Khattar said in the televised address, which is likely to be daily affair now.  While fighting this pandemic, I expect you all too bear it with us. During the lockdown, we have exempted movement of tractors and combine-harvestors, even workshops of these vehicles have been allowed to remain open, movement of farm labour has also been allowed so that all necessary services for the farmers remain functional, Khattar said, while appealing to all to maintain social distancing.  Owing to lockdown, Khattar said, state government has suffered a loss of Rs 3000 crore in March and is expected to lose another Rs 6000 crore in April.  Earlier in the day, Khattar also chaired a cabinet meeting and reviewed measures being taken to combat COVID-19.  Talking about exodus of migrant labourers, Khattar said, We have overcome that problem. All those people have agreed to our appeal and are now in safe homes/ relief camps. 467 relief camps have been set up in the state with a capacity of 70,000 people. At present, more than 10,000 people have taken shelter in these camps and they are being provided adequate food and other necessary facilities.  Speaking on the same issue, Deputy Chief Minister Dushyant Chautala said, Migrant workers are the backbone of any state. Deputy Commissioner of every district has been given Rs 1 crore specifically to provide food and shelter to migrant labourers/workers so that they do not face any difficulty during the lockdown period.  All the Pink, Yellow and Khaki ration card holders families in the state are being provided ration free of cost. This would benefit more than 27 lakh beneficiaries.

The Khakhi ration cardholders are being 10 kg wheat per member and 1 kg pulses, the CM added.

India and Bangladesh had exchanged 162 enclaves  patches of land of one country surrounded by the territory of the other  on August 1, 2015, to end one of the worlds most complex border disputes.  According to the land-swap agreement, 111 Indian enclaves measuring 17,160 acres became Bangladesh territory while 51 Bangladesh enclaves measuring 7,110 acres became part of Indias Cooch Behar district.

These exemptions are also crucial to maintain supply chain of fruits, vegetables and foodgrains in coming days.In addition to the home ministrys reminder to states, the agriculture ministry on Friday held video-conference with state representatives to review the payment of insurance claims and crop loss survey so that the farmers do not suffer due to delay during the lockdown period, specifically when they will also have to prepare their farms for next sowing operation in many parts of the country.Keeping in view the harvesting and sowing season, the home ministry had on March 27 put farmers, farm workers, custom hiring centres for farm machineries, procurement agencies, inter-state and intra-state movement of combine harvesters, and manufacturing units and packaging units of pesticides, fertilisers and seeds under the exempted categories. It was meant to allow farmers to continue with their agricultural operations during the lockdown period which coincides with the peak harvest season.However, farmers from many states continued to face problem on the ground.The home ministry too on Friday noted this problem. It in its note to chief secretaries of states, the ministry said though exceptions have been allowed for farming operations by farmers and farm workers, procurement of agricultural production, operation of mandis and movement of harvesting and sowing related machinery, these exceptions (exemptions) have not percolated down at the field level.Underlining these points, Union Home Secretary, Ajay Bhalla, in his note to states, said, With a view to ensure smooth harvesting and sowing operations, while maintaining social distancing, it is requested that the exceptions allowed for agriculture sector must be communicated to all field agencies.Besides, the home ministry on Friday issued addendum to its lockdown guidelines, making the list of exemptions bigger by exempting operations of shops of agricultural machinery, its spare parts (supply chain) and repair.Additionally, truck repair shops on highways and tea industry, including plantations with maximum 50 workers, are also kept under exempted categories during the lockdown period  it means these operations will be allowed with maintaining social distancing and taking other precautions to safeguard against the coronavirus infections.The home ministry had last week issued the list of exemptions in the wake of demands from farmers as they could not afford to leave their Rabi (winter sown) crops in the field during the lockdown period. The crops of wheat, gram, mustard and lentils are ready for harvest in Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and other parts in central India.The agriculture ministry, meanwhile on Friday, said Kisan Call Centres at all 21 locations were being operated during the lockdown period so that farmers could get all necessary advisories for their harvesting and sowing operations.Besides, phytosanitary certification for export consignments and import releases of plant and plant products are continuing, said the ministry. It said a total of 3776 certificates for export consignments and 1074 for import have been issued during the lockdown period ( till Thursday ).In addition to this, ministry claimed, the necessary coordination is being done with growers, aggregators, wholesalers, mandi associations, State Horticulture Missions , for smooth transport of the commodities and to sort out all difficulties for providing support to horticulture crops.",MUSTARD OIL

Dark green with lovely pink flowers, hog weed is a common creeper in many backyards in the State. Until her mother, Padma Menon, made it into a thoran, Anjali P had no clue that it was edible or that it was thazhuthama, a plant with medicinal properties.  The quarantine and lockdown in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic have unearthed many such nutrient-rich greens growing wild in many of our houses. Social media is flush with snaps of people coming up with jugaad recipes made of what is available around the house. The other day, I ate thoran made with sambar cheera (Ceylon spinach). Pulinkari with chembu thaal or the stem of colocasia, was another revelation ,  says Anjali, a college-goer in Thiruvananthapuram.  Those lucky to have some greenery around their house have turned to the bounty of leaves and vegetables that were either forgotten, ignored or rarely used in the menu. Spinach varieties, yams, tubers, papaya, plantain, seasonal fruits such as jackfruit and mangooptions are aplenty.  It has become an early morning routine for me to collect fresh vegetables and leaves from my compound. We have drumstick, jackfruit, mango, red amaranthus, bilimbi., says Nisha P, a voice-over artiste from Thrissur. Drumstick leaves are used to make thoran and drumsticks in the curry with raw mango and jackfruit seeds; amaranthus is for thoran or aviyal. Other than seasonal fruits, I never used to depend so much on home-grown produce My daughters, who enjoy experimenting with veggies, especially cauliflower, are now getting used to the new menu, adds Nisha. A food blogger as well, Nisha adds that she successfully made a curry with petals of hibiscus flowers in her garden!  Kozhuppa cheera | Photo Credit: Special arrangement  There is a huge variety of leafy greens that Kerala has that can be turned into flavourful thorans or mixed into your chappathi or dosa dough. Besides the common red and green amaranthus, there is sambar cheera, kozhuppa cheera (pigweed), Mysore cheera, madhura cheera (sweet leaf), valli cheera (Malabar spinach) and the like. I prepare thoran using tender leaves of colocasia as well, says Geetha Menon, a homemaker from Tripunithura.  The multi-purpose banana plant gives raw banana, banana stem (vazhappindi) and banana inflorescence (vazhakkoombu), which are used to prepare a multitude of dishes, all of which taste different . What is more, many of these dishes dont need onion for gravy or masala. Then there is raw papaya that can be steamed, stir fried or cooked with green gram to prepare erissery.  Jack of all fruits  It is the jackfruit season. While idi chakka or the small, tender jackfruit makes delicious thoran, raw fruit is cooked to make puzhukku, thoran or aviyal. The seeds can go with any thoran or added to different curries or sauted in oil for the mezhukkuvaratti. Jackfruit rags and rind are also edible.  Parts of jackfruit are used to make different dishes | Photo Credit: Getty Images/iStockphoto  In fact, ever since we went on self-quarantine from March 8 after our son arrived from Japan, we have been living on the produce of our kitchen garden and the profusion of jackfruit on two trees in our yard. My mother told me how they used to dry the seed in the sun and then get it ground and use the flour as a thickening agent or in dosa dough. I dried it in the sun and made it into small pieces that I use in curries. For more than a month, we have been living on the produce from our eight-cent plot, explains Bindu Thomas, a space scientist who took voluntary retirement from ISRO.  Usha Soolapani, a resident of the capital city, shares on her Facebook page a recipe that her friend from Thrissur had given her. They collect leaves of pumpkin and cook it in an interesting way. Traditionally pumpkin leaves were cooked in rice gruel. She tried a gruel made of jackfruit seed flour. It was mixed with a paste of coconut, green chillies and cumin seeds. Then she fried mustard and curry leaves and put it in the curry. She said that its taste was exquisite. Even if we are living in an urban area, a single plant of pumpkin produces enough leaves for a family, writes Usha.  Leaf revolution E Sajeev Kumar, consultant scientist at KR Narayanan Centre for Biotechnology, Kottayam and senior scientist at Ayur Yuva Institute of Innovation for Science and Heritage (AYIISH) in Palakkad, has been conducting research on medicinal properties of plants that are considered as weeds or inedible. Improving our health is possible by including food that develops immunity, he says. He has published a book of recipes for cooking with different kinds of leaves. There are recipes for leaves of hibiscus, bitter gourd, tender jackfruit leaves, tender banana leaves and so on.  Some parents point out that the change in the menu is the need of the hour. Actor-writer Aaryan Ramani Girijavallabhan says that chicken was a must on the menu for his children. Choices are aplenty for todays generation and what they want is just a phone call away. But now it is vazhappindi, jackfruit seed and chembu thaal! We have a dish with raw banana almost everyday and my children have started liking it! says Aaryan.  But this shouldnt be a temporary habit, points out Sridhar Radhakrishnan, programme director, Thanal. This phase will pass. What matters is how much you have transformed your family. This is the right time to make your children understand what we have in nature. This should become a culture. Take them along to show the plants and slowly they will also be able to appreciate what we have in plenty in our surroundings, says Sridhar.  Recipe for Thazhuthama thoran  Ingredients:  Thazhuthama leaves- washed and chopped fine; Coconut - 1 cup grated; Green chillies 5-6; Small onion chopped - 1/4 cup; Mustard seeds - 1/4 tsp; Turmeric - 1/2 tsp; Oil - 2 tablespoons; Curry leaves; Salt to taste  Method:  Heat oil in a pan and splutter mustard seeds.

(Source: File Photo) Around 10 to 50 minutes of daily sunlight exposure is needed to meet daily vitamin D requirement. (Source: File Photo)  Since India is under lockdown, many of us are not getting adequate sunlight exposure. It is important to note that sunlight, which comes through your window, can not help in producing vitamin D since ultraviolet B rays are filtered by glass. Also, in general, Indian people have less than average Vitamin D levels. Therefore, it is important that we try to compensate for the lack of the vitamin by other means, suggests Dr Ravi Shekhar Jha, senior consultant and Head of the Department, Pulmonology, Fortis Escorts Faridabad.  Our immunity plays a very important role in fighting viral diseases such as coronavirus, and vitamin D is one of the very important vitamin that helps in immunoregulation, adds Dr Jha.  How does one get vitamin D?  As a fat-soluble vitamin, it is produced internally when ultraviolet rays from the sunlight hit the skin and initiate the process of vitamin D synthesis. Since it is present in very few foods, people are mainly dependent on sunlight exposure to get adequate vitamin D. Dark-skinned people, including Indians, need longer time in sunlight to make the same amount of vitamin D than light-skinned people, mentions Dr Jha. For the Indian population, if we assume that around 25 percent of our body is exposed, then around 10 to 50 minutes of daily sunlight exposure is needed to meet daily vitamin D requirement.  How does Vitamin D help?  Vitamin D is essential for regulating calcium and phosphate in your body. Besides bone growth, vitamin D also regulates cell growth, immune function, neuromuscular function, and suppression of inflammation.  How can we get adequate levels of vitamin D in our body?  Since we are fighting a pandemic, a viral disease which has crippled the world, it is very important that besides practising social isolation, hand hygiene, hand sanitisation and cough etiquette, we must also maintain good health so that even if the virus hits us, our body is prepared to knock it down, says Dr Jha.  Try taking foods which are rich in vitamin D, like oily fish like salmon, and eggs and red meats. Also, it is good idea to go to your terrace or roof for few minutes with maximum part of your body exposed to direct sunlight. Under doctors supervision, you can also take vitamin D supplements, however, we must remember that vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin, and any excess stored in the body can be toxic. So, it should not be taken without prescription.  Try this delicious High Protein Salmon with Sweet Sauce by chef Kapil, The Den, Bengaluru.

The government has estimated wheat production of 120 lakh metric tonnes.  Amid the coronavirus lockdown, the Haryana government is hoping for a good production of wheat despite inclement weather conditions in the past couple of weeks.  The crop is good this year inspite of untimely rainfall and hailstorm, Haryana Additional Chief Secretary Sanjeev Kaushal told The Indian Express on Friday. According to Kaushal, the government has estimated wheat production of 120 lakh metric tonnes (MT). In the last three years, wheat production has been a little over 120 lakh MT, while it was 113.50 MT in 2016. This year, officials are expecting a per hectare yield of a little above that of 2016, but lesser than in the last three years.  The government had pegged wheat production target at 132.71 lakh MT for this year, which may not be achieved because of adverse weather conditions during the season. We always keep the target on the higher side like we expect marks from our children in their exams. The target is a rough estimate which is set expecting 10 per cent hike from previous years production, says Jagraj Dhandi, joint director, Haryana Agriculture and Farmers Welfare Department.  Punjab and Haryana are considered the food bowl of the country. They are the largest contributors of wheat, about 70 %, to the central pool that is used for public distribution and other welfare schemes of the government.  Apart from heavy rains and hailstorms, the strong waves coupled with storm had flattened the wheat crop in several parts of the state. Government officials did an assessment of crop loss. However, Dhandi says the wheat crop got considerable time to almost revive from the setbacks it suffered in the past couple of weeks. Thats why we are expecting a good crop this year too. After rains, the weather did not turn hot immediately. Because of cold weather for long, wheat crop fruits got enough time to mature. This helped recover the losses, said Dhandi.  However, the officer said the mustard crop may witness a loss of around 10 per cent this year. According to officials, as much as 90 per cent of the total mustard crop has been harvested in the state while wheat is ready to be harvested.  The government has delayed wheat and mustard procurement this year, keeping in view the countrywide lockdown aimed to halt the spread of coronavirus. Officials admit that the wheat procurement, which will take place from April 20, will be a tough task for the government machinery because of the huge quantity that will arrive in the state mandis.  The state had recorded the highest wheat procurement in 2018, when more than 87 lakh MT was bought into the state mandis. The bumper crop was the result of favourable climatic conditions that year.  To ensure smooth wheat procurement this year, the government has announced an incentive of Rs 125 per quintal to farmers who would bring their produce to the mandis in June. I have planned to keep my produce till June as I will be able to meet my labour expenditure with this incentive, said Suresh Kumar, a farmer from Gorakhpur village.",MUSTARD OIL

And thats having hilarious results.  Home grooming is particularly difficult for men; most are dependent on their barbers and salons to maintain hair and beards. So those who dont want to emerge from isolation looking radically different are doing what most starter cooks have been doing too  turning to YouTube videos for help.  Shoaib Hossain, 33, a lawyer, has watched several videos on how to cut ones own hair. I never thought it would come to this, but these videos are my saviours, he says. I tried out some of the tips they offer, on myself, and the results were abysmal. I couldnt get the different layers. But at least I can control the length now  its now just below my ears, the way I like, not growing and curling at the ends.  For practice, Hossain is hoping to try out his rough-hewn skills on family members, but is having trouble finding volunteers. Im hoping that even if the results are not that great, theyll appreciate the effort, he says, laughing. As for my beard, its now too thick for my razor, so maybe Ill oil it to soften it a bit and then try trimming.  Grooming expert Rashmi Shastri has a key tip for the salon-deprived  dont do any desperate cutting. No one will judge you for how you look during or just after a lockdown. Men can grow out their hair but keep it neat. Trim the beard and use warm mustard oil to keep it soft.  A dollop of honey  Homemaker Sonel Sinha, 35, has a different kind of problem. Shes so busy caring for the house and her three-year-old that she has no time for all the hair care she used to do  oiling, brushing, washing and conditioning. Plus, Im rationing on my shampoo and conditioner, she says.  To care for her long hair in the short term, shes making her own hair masks. I take two tablespoons of curd, half a teaspoon of honey and a drop of olive oil. Mix, apply and keep on for 45 minutes while doing my chores, then shampoo, she says.  Honey works really well for split ends, so does mayonnaise, says Shastri. Apply it on the length, rub repeatedly for seven minutes so the hair absorbs it and then let it sit for 20 minutes before washing it off.  You can also just do as your naani did and massage the roots with hot oil for 15 minutes, before a head bath to keep your hair healthy, Shastri says.  A retro fix  With fewer fruits and vegetables on your plate, you might see changes in your skin, says Samay Dutta, director of Delhis Noir salon. Drink lots of water to flush out toxins. Regular exercise will help too, as it relieves stress, boosts digestive health and circulation and helps keep your skin glowing and healthy.  Face masks are easy to make at home, says Dutta. Mix one teaspoon of turmeric powder, two of lemon juice and one of yoghurt. Apply on face, leave for 15 minutes. Massage into skin before rinsing with cool water.  The age-old besan-turmeric-milk mask works excellently too. It helps in exfoliation, clears up patchy spots. And cucumber really does help with dark circles, Shastri says.

The harvesters have not reached their fields either, crucial now because there simply arent enough farm hands available, thanks to the massive exodus of daily wagers after the Covid lockdown.Farmers in both west UP and Haryana have appealed to the governments to ensure combine harvesters that are stuck in various states reach their villages at the earliest. They have also sought adequate space in warehouses to store their produce till they get labourers to take it to the market.Harvester operators from north India usually go to central and western parts of the country in winter to help farmers cultivate wheat there. During this time, they return to states like Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh to help harvest the rabi crop. Farmers in Haryana said many mechanical harvesters are stuck in states such as Maharashtra, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan because of lockdown curbs.The Centre has, however, assured farmers that harvesters moving from one state to another wouldnt be stopped. In the past couple of days, many harvesters have left for their destinations, officials said. The government has also ordered shops that sell agriculture machinery and spare parts to open so that farmers who own harvesters can get the machines repaired.A late harvest means lower yield and reduced returns. If the government doesnt intervene at the earliest, the lower yield will have a cascading effect on the retail market. It will also impact the governments procurement process and we are the ones who will be affected the most, said Rajiv Godra of All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee (AIKSCC).Godra and other farmers like him said they needed to harvest wheat and mustard over the next 10 days. Else, a substantial portion of the crop would be damaged, he added. The rabi season hasnt been quite fruitful for farmers around the national capital region this time. Spells of rain in February and March have affected their yield. But even if farmers manage to harvest wheat using machines that are expected to reach soon, storing the produce will be a challenge.During the harvesting season in Punjab and Haryana, a substantial workforce comes from Bihar and Jharkhand to help farmers pack their produce in sacks and load them onto vehicles to be taken to wholesale markets, where it is procured by the government. Not only has this workforce not arrived this time, the farm labourers who help in the cultivation all the year round have also left for their homes in the wake of the lockdown.We are exposed to the vagaries of weather. Untimely rain has already damaged our crops to a certain extent. So, we had met a few ministers and officials of the agriculture department and asked them to assess the damage. Yet, when they enforced the lockdown, our concerns were bypassed, said Dharambir Singh, a member of the All India Kisan Sabha.Sources said Haryana alone needs around 10,000 mechanical harvesters during this time of the year. By a rough estimate, only 4,000 such machines are available with the farmers as of now.Officials in the Haryana agriculture department agreed that farmers concerns need to be addressed at the earliest. These are difficult times and most of our efforts have been directed at controlling the spread of coronavirus . Transportation of harvesters is being allowed now. An assessment of the damage to crops has also been done, an official said.Farmers in west UP, too, are waiting for combine harvesters from Punjab and Madhya Pradesh. They pointed out that the machines hadnt left the two states despite an assurance from the UP agricultural production commissioner to ensure inter-state movement of harvesters. There is already a shortage of daily wage labourers here. Harvesters can do their job, but where are the machines? They are still stuck in other states because of the lockdown, said Dharmendra Bhati, a farmer from Jewar.",MUSTARD OIL

Read More  CHANDIGARH: As Punjab gets ready for wheat procurement beginning April 15 amid the coronavirus pandemic, a major challenge for the state government will be providing adequate number of farm labourers and gunny bags for both farmers and arhtiyas (commission agents).  Farmers rely heavily on mechanised harvesting, but will need labourers for the post-harvest exercise. Besides, shortage of bardana (gunny bags) is something that farmers faced during the last wheat harvest as well. Even though Punjab had tried to make advance arrangements for gunny bags for state procurement agencies by getting in touch with jute mills in West Bengal in January, these units have been closed due to lockdown. Punjab needs over 5 lakh bales (1 bale=170kg) for the current harvest.  Besides, finding a way to avoid large gatherings in grain markets during the weighing and loading of wheat while ensuring social distancing to avoid the spread of coronavirus will be an uphill task.  Punjab food supplies minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu told TOI that since the state government had decided to go in for staggered procurement, finding adequate number of labourers should not be a problem. ""We also plan to bring in MGNREGA workers at the local level to fill in for labourers who may have moved out. To make up for any shortfall of jute bags, the state has already ordered polypropylene (PP) bags for wheat,"" he said.  Meanwhile, secretary (agriculture) K S Pannu said, ""While the industrial units have labour that is employed by them, farm labourers are pressed into action only during the time of harvest season. Adequate number of combines will be available.""  However, Harinder Singh Lakhowal, general secretary of Bhartiya Kisan Union (Lakhowal), suggested that instead of asking farmers to bring their produce to local grain markets, the state government should devise a system to collect the wheat produce from the doorstep of farmers by allowing them to store it.  ""The state government should allow coordination committees of panchayats and arhtiyas for the procurement process. If MGNREGA workers collect wheat from the doorstep of farmers, it will ensure that there are no crowds. Besides, this way local workers will also get employment,"" added Amarjit Singh, a farmer from Sangrur.  ""The Centre has already allowed movement of combine harvesters and their spare parts are also available. The state government has made adequate arrangements for PP bags and I'm sure the wheat harvest will be conducted smoothly,"" added Ashu. To rule out overcrowding, the state government plans to work out ways to procure wheat grain from villages that are located a couple of kilometers from grain markets in the state.",MUSTARD OIL

The state, he said will begin procurement of mustard from April 15 and of wheat from April 20. Traditionally, the procurement in Haryana begins from April 1. The staggered procurement operation will go on in phases till June 30.  Against 433 purchase centres and mandis last time, this season these have been increased to 2,000 to allow staggered procurement of wheat, which is likely to last over a month, Khattar said Tuesday evening.  He added, Arhtiyas will be involved in procurement process. The government will digitally transfer payments to them who in turn will pay it to the farmers for the crop procured. However, for mustard, government will directly pay the farmers. For mustard procurement, against 66 mandis earlier it will be 140 mandis this time.  The state government has announced that face-masks will be provided to the farmers when they come to mandis and procurement centres. Khattar said, There are also about 4,000 combine harvesters available in Haryana and free movement of Combines from outside the state is also being allowed. The workshops for farm-equipment are also functional so that farmers do not face any difficulty during the period of harvest.  On the availability of labour, the CM said: With many migrant workers from the state having left for their hometowns in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, directions have been given in districts to accommodate labourers under the MGNREGA in the fields. Today, there are 15,000 migrant labourers who are lodged in Shelter Homes across the state. Many of them have also expressed their willingness to work in fields.",MUSTARD OIL

The assurance came from Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar who said the procurement of wheat would begin during April 15-20 and states had already been advised to stagger procurement, increase number of procurement centres and issue tokens to farmers in order to prevent large congregation at mandis once procurement starts.  Addressing his first media briefing through video conference during the lockdown period, Tomar said procurement would be carried out in three phases and completed by June end.  Though he admitted that the farmers have been facing problems due to unavoidable lockdown, he said the government was taking all necessary steps to minimise this pain.  The ministry had earlier allowed public sector procurement agencies to procure pulses and oilseeds from 13 states. Accordingly, the NAFED has procured 1,07,814 metric tonnes of pulses and over 1,600 metric tonnes of oilseed on minimum support price (MSP) worth over Rs 526 crore.  This has benefitted 75,984 farmers, said the minister while sharing report of his ministry on measures being taken for harvesting and procurement of Rabi (winter sown) crops.  The report shows that though wheat is still to be harvested in most of the areas, mustard has already been harvested in 95%-97% area in Rajasthan , MP, Haryana and UP. Similarly, gram has been harvested in 95% area in MP, Rajasthan, Telangana , Maharashtra , UP ( Bundelkhand ) and Andhra Pradesh . The wheat producing states have, so far, reported only 26-33% of harvesting against the total sown area.  According the ministrys report, about 7.77 crore landholder farmers have received Rs 2,000 each under the Centres income support scheme - Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) - during the lockdown period. An amount of Rs 15,531 crore has been released so far under the scheme during the lockdown period, said Tomar.  The ministry on Thursday issued multiple orders, sensitising states on procurement of farm produce including perishable horticultural crops from across the country. So far, more than 1600 fruits/vegetables mandis have been opened in coordination with state governments and various Mandi Boards.

But, unlike most years, farmers arent celebrating. They can only stare in desolation at their crop withering away in the fields under the intense heat. For labourers are sparse. And the few available find it difficult to dodge the police to make it to the fields    In the north, Punjab is staring at a muted Baisakhi. While the state government has decided on staggered procurement of wheat and other rabi crops that were sown in winter, farmers are worried this would extend into sowing of kharif crop and lead to hit in produce  NEW DELHI: As Covid-19 rages, in farms across the country its a grim Baiskahi staring at farmers hit by a plethora of woes  from the labour force working on fields drying up due to fear and migration to crops drying up, lack of liquidity among farmers and even a severe shortage of gunny bags to pack produce. Even fear of catching the virus in big cities is keeping farmers and transporters away from transporting crop and vegetables.Most farmers in Punjab and Haryana grow wheat, the biggest rabi crop. It will be difficult to ask them to stagger their harvest as they are worried over clearing their fields to prepare for sowing of kharif (summer-sown) crops like paddy, cotton, maize, bajra and pulses.Also, most of the mandis employ a large number of labourers, mostly migrants, who are away due to the lockdown. So handling of produce, especially wheat, after procurement will be difficult due to manpower shortage. Also, an acute shortage of gunny bags with supply from Bengal yet to arrive  for packing wheat is likely to hit the two states.The farmers in these states will also be affected by funds liquidity as they would need money immediately to buy seeds for the next crop season.In Madhya Pradesh, farmers can hardly do much but watch their standing crops drying up as summer sets in. In the present situation, wheat procurement is likely to be affected at major centers including Bhopal, Indore and Ujjain districts battling with coronavirus.Summers getting harsh by the day and grains have started falling off. This may result in lower yield, said farmer leader Shivkumar Sharma. Shortage of gunny bags has hit MP farmers too. Farmers in MP depend mostly on rabi crops with a high sowing area of over 120 lakh hectare. More than half of this accounts for wheat. Besides, cash crops like gram, pulses and mustard too are grown in rabi season.Lockdown is necessary, but harvesting of crops is also important and time is running out, said Sharma.As labourers are not venturing out, farmers and their families are struggling to harvest their crops. In absence of labourers, my wife and family members have pitched in. It is a skilled job, and we are not used to doing it on our own, said Imrat Lal, a farmer living on the oustkirts of Bhopal.While Telangana is expecting a bumper paddy, crop harvesting has hit a roadblock as agriculture labourers refuse to enter fields owing to the virus scare. The lockdown has triggered further shortage of labour, impacting harvesting and marketing of paddy, maize, chilli and other crops. Migration of farm labour has made matters worse. More than two weeks into the harvest season, farmers are at their wits end on how to harvest their paddy.Even if we manage to organise labourers, police are restricting their movement because of the lockdown. Harvesting is totally disrupted, said a farmer in Nizamabad. Paddy was sown in record 40 lakh acres in Telangana.If there are fewer vegetables and fruits in Mumbai markets, it is because traders and farmers from Nashik and western Maharashtra are struggling to get labourers to do field work and transport farm produce to the state capital. Nashik has a lions share in the vegetable market of Mumbai and over 500 tonnes are sent daily through 150 vehicles. Since the lockdown, the supply has reduced substantially. The farmers are counting their losses. Usually, the three and half months from February is the peak period for vegetables farmers.At present, farmers have good acreage of vegetables ready to harvest, but the demand for the crop has reduced and there is lack of enough labourers.With inputs from Chandigarh, Hyderabad,",MUSTARD OIL

Also read: COVID-19 lockdown | Haryana to start staggered wheat procurement from April 20  Terming the decision of asking farmers to register themselves on the government web portal Meri Fasal Mera Byora to sell their produce as anti-farmer, State president Kumari Selja has accused the State government of harassing farmers.  Also read: Gehlot suggests food for work plan  First corona epidemic and then the wrong decisions of the government on purchase of crop during the lockdown have increased the problems of farmers. The delay and the conditions imposed for the purchase have put farmers in a severe crisis, she said.  The government had recently come out with a set of guidelines to reduce congestion and ensure social distancing in the mandis (yards) amid the rising cases of the COVID-19. It said only 100 farmers would be allowed to bring their produce to the mandis every day. The market committees will ensure that all the agricultural produce including wheat, mustard and black gram should be brought only after an online e-gate pass is issued to the farmers, who are registered and verified on the portal. Registration is open till April 19, according to the State Agricultural Marketing Board.  Ms. Selja said the farmers were already facing the problems of storing the produce and delayed payment due to the delay in procurement. Now decisions like the registration condition would only add to their misery. The Minimum Support Price (MSP) of mustard was 4,425 per quintal while farmers are being forced to sell between 3,500 and 3,700 because of urgent need of cash. Not only this, the wheat crop, which has an MSP of 1,925 per quintal, is being sold as advanced contracts at 1,800 per quintal, she alleged.  Former Chief Minister and Leader of the Opposition Bhupinder Singh Hooda has also expressed concern over the registration provision. Amid the ongoing lockdown, there would be many farmers who may not be able to register. In this time of crises, the government should ensure that produce from all farmers is purchased whether they are registered or not, said Mr. Hooda.  The procurement of mustard will start from April 15 and wheat from April 20. The procurement season 2020-21 will end on June 30.",MUSTARD OIL

(Photo by Partha Paul)  Eighty-seven years old widow Sabita Banerjee is bed-ridden and lives alone at her two-bedroom flat in Bansdroni area of south Kolkata. Her daughters, who live in Delhi, had hired two domestic helps for her for 12 hours each.  The widows one of the domestic helps, Rekha Nayek (48), could not return home in North 24 Parganas district as another help could not turn up on March 23 morning due to lockdown restrictions. Since then, Nayek has been attending Banerjee.  Other senior citizens, who are ailing and living alone in the city, are not as fortunate as Banerjee. Many societies have banned the entry of domestic helps for fear of coronavirus spread. At some places, helps cannot reach senior citizens houses because of lack of transportation.  These are not ordinary times. They demand self-less, if not extraordinary, measures to tide over the lockdown blues.  One such gesture is being shown by Dr Dhiresh Chowdhury, a doctor, and his team of 40 people at his geriatrics clinic Banchbo. They have been not only treating the elderly at their homes but also providing medicines, grocery items, nursing facilities and physiotherapy in south Kolkata.  When Chowdhury visited Banerjee, he was reassuring: Dont worry. Whenever you feel, call us. We will come here within half an hour. If necessary, you can call us even for grocery items. He was accompanied by nurses Khukumani Bhuniya (23), Kunami Hansda (20) and driver Gobinda Gharami (59).  His staff  comprising nurses, on-call doctors and drivers  attends four-five elderly people daily. Before the lockdown, the clinic provided home visits to only its members. But this changed after March 22  the day of Janata Curfew that was extended by Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee  and doctors are visiting non-members too.  What inspired Chowdhury was the large number of senior citizens living alone in the city. Money is not a constraint for many. They value medical help in critical times, said Chowdhury.  His area of operation is a five-km radius from his clinic in Garia in south Kolkata. We limited our area to five km because it is easier to give emergency help within the golden hour, the doctor said.  As his clinics number was shared by a patient on social media, Chowdhury and his team have been getting calls from senior citizens who are not members of the clinic. He said he receives 30 calls a day from elderly citizens.  At Chowdhurys home, his wife Kuhu, 41, is worried. We have two children and my mother-in-law is above 80 years. So, he has to follow proper social distancing and sanitisation norms every time he is entering our house. But I am worried about his health because he is diabetic.  The clinic is also helping senior citizens of 45 families from the underprivileged section of the society.  Chowdhury said, These families are from Patuli police station area.

The entire quantity of mustard was procured from around 4,500 farmers till Wednesday evening. However, at many places, farmers faced problems due to shortage of labour. Strike by arhtiyas (commission agents) also affected work.  Haryana government has set up 163 procurement centres for mustard in the state. Farmers were allowed to enter procurement centres in two time slots - 8am to 2pm and 2.30pm to 6pm. While 25 farmers were allowed to enter in the morning slot, the same number was allowed entry in the afternoon. Only those farmers who had registered themselves at government's ""Meri Fasal Mera Byora"" portal were allowed entry.  However, officials had made elaborate arrangements to ensure that farmers and labourers abide by the protocol put in place to check Covid-19 spread. While farmers' vehicles/equipment were sanitised at the time of entry in mandis, they were also given masks and asked to keep distance from others at the procurement centres.  While the government claimed that the first day of procurement was hassle-free for farmers, Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU) Haryana, highlighted some problems in ""Meri Fasal Mera Byora"" portal. BKU spokesperson Rakesh Bains said farmers were not allowed to take the specified quantity of mustard in mandis at several places because of calculations on the portal. ""Ram Kumar, a farmer from Yara village in Kurukshetra district had mustard crop in 30 kanal area and as per the specified limits, he was allowed to take 30 quintal mustard in mandi. But after applying on the portal, he was directed to take only 62kg mustard. Similar, problems are being faced by farmers but the biggest problem is that nobody is able to address such issues occurring on the portal,"" Bains added.  Ashok Kumar, a resident of Baland village, who had come to sell mustard in Rohtak mandi, said they had reached at 9am but there was no clarity regarding procurement till 11am. ""Only one commission agent was available in the mandi and procured the crop. Labour shortage was another huge problem. Though the government officers were very cooperative, lack of clarity on some issues regarding quantity of purchase created confusion for farmers,"" he added.  The area of mustard crop in Haryana is around 6 lakh hectares. During the previous rabi procurement season in 2019, the state had produced around 12.5 lakh metric tonne mustard. The procurement of wheat would begin from April 20 for which state has prepared around 2000 procurement centres.  Ram Mehar, a farmer from Anupgarh village of Jind, said, ""The government has capped 40 quintal purchasing in a day and it will be better if they purchase the entire produce at a one time. Most of the farmers don't have their own vehicle to bring crops in market and hire the same on rent.""  Fatehabad MLA Dura Ram, who inaugurated the mustard purchase centre at Bhattu grain market, said the procurement of wheat would be done from April 20 to June 30. Fatehabad DC Ravi Prakash Gupta appealed to the farmers not to bring wheat to the mandis before April 20 and all farmers should keep in mind the moisture laws and bring only dry wheat to the mandi.  In Ambala, mustard procurement started at Shahzadpur grain market in Ambala district. Afsar Singh, secretary of Shahzadpur grain market, said, ""As per the schedule provided by the senior officials, a total of 57 mustard farmers from different villages of Ambala district were called for selling their produce in Shahzadpur.

An order dated March 28 said all agricultural, horticultural activities and those relating to harvesting, transportation, procurement, mandis, farming operations and the like are exempted from the lockdown. The order was made so that harvesting would continue uninterrupted. The exempted categories included agencies engaged in procurement of agriculture products, including MSP operations; mandis; farmers and farm workers in the field; custom hiring centres related to farm machinery; manufacturing and packaging units of fertilizers, pesticides and seeds; and intra- and inter-state movement of harvesting and sowing-related machines.  The order went on to say that this decision has been taken with a view to facilitate unhindered activities related to agriculture and farming so as to ensure essential supplies and that farmers and common people do not face any difficulty.  Coronavirus lockdown guidelines | Industries operating in rural areas to reopen on April 20  In a press release on March 27, the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordinating Committee (AIKSCC), in a representation to the government, had asked the police not to stop peasants and said there should be no harassment and violence against peasants, farmers, vendors and transporters. The committee demanded that all harvested crops, milk, poultry, meat and eggs should be procured and that regulated markets should operate at requisite strength, failing which, the panel feared, village-level procurement and supply will rot and ruin the producer farmers.  Harvesting winter crops  Similarly, on April 1, the AIKSCC, in its letter to the Chief Minister of Punjab, warned that these are the peak days of harvesting winter crops, wheat, barley, pulses and seeds; but all the farmers/workers are shut behind the doors. Sir, who will harvest the crops? What will be the fate of vegetables/fruit growers particularly the high value perishable crops, these can hardly be stored. With no means to transport, god knows what will be their fate. Imagine the fate of milk producers and of poultry. The unfortunate peasants are forced to spill milk in the canals. The poultry farmers dont know what to do with their products. The landless labourers and their families have absolutely no work. Who will provide them food on their plate?  In Madhya Pradesh, the Narmada Bachao Andolan (NBA) wrote to the Chief Secretary that despite the lifting of the lockdown, all mandis at district level are closed, and complained that when farmers sent tarbooz (water melons), oranges and grapes to the mandis, the gates were closed and they had to return on foot. Hence, the traders were refusing to come to the fields to collect their produce. The NBA found it ironic that migrant labourers were facing starvation while agricultural and horticultural produce was rotting in the fields.  Interactive map of confirmed coronavirus cases in India | State-wise tracker for coronavirus cases, deaths and testing rates  The All India Kisan Mazdoor Sabha (AIKMS), in its letter dated April 4, to the Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister, complained that farmers have suffered losses in their mustard crop which could not be harvested in time and the local police have stopped the peasants from reaching their fields and harvesting and transporting the crop. It warned that we are looking at a very severe crisis in the coming days if this attitude continues. It will lead to a major crisis in food availability and may result in large numbers of hunger deaths. The panel pointed out that five lakh migrant labourers from Bihar, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh work in Punjab. However, many of them ran away due to the police.  In Odisha, the panel pointed out that MGNREGA has completely stopped, forcing lakhs of rural workers into distress. Everything can wait it warned, but not farming as a season lost means a year is lost.  Assaults on forest dwellers  Equally ominous are the assaults on tribals and non-tribal forest dwellers by the police and officials in all the tribal areas of the country. Forest produce is by nature inherently seasonal. Officials have interfered with the collection of non-timber forest produce, as allowed by the Forest Rights Act, causing hunger and distress to millions of tribals.  Overzealous policemen and officials have lathi-charged farm workers and interfered with the movement of agricultural produce to the mandis. If harvesting is interrupted, if transportation of produce is halted on account of vehicles with passes not being available, if farmers and farm workers are lathi-charged on their way to work and if the mandis do not operate at full strength, there could be an unprecedented food crisis.  Coronavirus lockdown | Police wont harm farmers, govt. tells Supreme Court  The judiciary must carefully review its approach of meekly following the executive while the latter makes blunder after blunder. The lockdown was introduced irrationally without ensuring the continuation of provisions statutorily mandated under the National Food Security Act, 2013. Consequently, the anganwadis were closed in panic and supplementary nutrition for children below 6 years and for pregnant women, lactating mothers and adolescent girls came to an immediate stop. Chaos continued until the government issued an order, dated March 30, acknowledging that in many States/UTs [Union Territories], the anganwadi centres are closed. Hurriedly, patchwork activities began, which resulted in provision of take-home rations, instead of hot, cooked meals.  Also read | Reducing farm distress during a pandemic  Tens of thousands of those below the poverty line suffered terribly. Similarly, the mid-day meal, which reaches millions of school-going students, was abruptly discontinued. The provision of 6,000 to every pregnant woman and lactating mother, mandated under the Maternity Benefit Act, also virtually came to an end. Imperial in its announcement and in its execution, the lockdown caused untold pain to the poor.  A hastily imposed lockdown  This is not to say that some form of a lockdown was unnecessary; however, the harshness and arbitrariness and lack of thought and preparation in its execution was certainly avoidable. It is typical of governments run dictatorially and with lack of transparency that when mistakes are made, they turn out to be gigantic and irreversible. Further, to stifle criticism, we are now told by no less than the Solicitor General that it is not in public interest to highlight the human suffering and that the governments point of view should be accepted without demur because the crisis demands that everyone falls in line. What the learned law officer fails to understand is that Indians may be poor, and sometimes gullible, but they are not sheep to always fall in line with a military-like command. They have reserves of democratic resistance that will in the coming months perhaps surprise this government.  Coronavirus | Opeds and editorials  Starvation deaths on account of hunger and merciless police beatings have been reported from across the country. The judiciary must now shift track. For some time, the courts have deferred to the government in view of the unprecedented crisis. But now, with the crisis spreading to agriculture, the judiciary must abandon this hands-off approach.

In addition, it sent an advisory to all states to utilise funds under the water resources ministry's Jal Jeevan Mission to mitigate drinking water requirements of residents in both rural and urban areas, including of those residing in shelter homes.  The exemptions in agriculture, fisheries and livestock sectors were devised keeping in view the feedback the agriculture ministry received from the ground. Since the lockdown period coincides with peak harvest season, the home ministry put all related activities as well as procurement operations under the exempted categories with conditions that these should be continued while adhering to social distancing and other hygiene practices .  The move on fisheries came in the backdrop of demands from the sector as lakhs of fishermen had been out of work ever since the lockdown was imposed last month. In fact, a number of marine fishermen were out in the sea for fishing when the lockdown order came. They all subsequently got stranded on arriving back at the coast because they did not have any logistics to sell their catch or even go to their villages .  As for procurement, Nafed has procured 1,24,125 metric tonnes of pulses and oilseeds on minimum support price, worth over Rs 606 crore, during the lockdown.

(Photo: Narendra Vaskar) The extraordinary arrangements were made as rabi procurement began in Haryana Wednesday. (Photo: Narendra Vaskar)  I HAVE been bringing my crop to grain markets for the past 20 years but I have never seen so much security, said Ishwar Bishnoi while waiting with his mustard crop at the Bhuna mandi (procurement centre) on Wednesday.  Police personnel have been deployed at the entry, exit points and various corners of the mandi, ensuring that only those farmers who have been called for procurement on the particular day, enter. Before entering, farmers are made to sanitise their hands and given masks. Their body temperature is checked.  The extraordinary arrangements were made as rabi procurement began in Haryana Wednesday. Procurement was being undertaken in two shifts  8 am to 2 pm and 2 pm to 6 pm. In each shift, only 25 farmers were called to the mandi on Wednesday. From Thursday onwards, 50 farmers will able to sell their produce in each shift.  Ishwar Bishnoi, 38, a resident of Khajuri village, Fatehabad district, arrived at the mandi at 8.30 am. He had received a text message and phone call from the officials on Tuesday regarding his turn to bring his produce to the procurement centre. However, at 3.30 pm, Bishnoi had to take his produce and return home as the officials did not procure his crop citing high moisture content.  An official said, We had specifically asked the farmers to bring the mustard only after drying the crop properly. We had to send back those farmers whose crop had higher moisture content than the specified limit.  But no availability of tea or food stalls near the mandi or surrounding areas was the real problem. Amarjeet, a farm labourer who had come with a tractor-trolley full of mustard crop, approached the policemen to check whether there was any community lunch available in Bhuna town. But they could not suggest any option.  The government should get registered all mandi labourers for life insurance, said Mangal Singh, president of the local Majdoor Union.  Bhuna Market Committee Secretary Ishwar Dhaka was satisfied with the procurement of about 450 quintals on the first day. 44 farmers turned up. We had called 50, Dhaka told The Indian Express.  However, All India Kisan Sabhas Haryana unit secretary Balbir Thakan said many parts of southern Haryana witnessed very slow procurement of mustard on Wednesday.  Haryana Additional Chief Secretary P K Das said the mustard will be purchased even after start of wheat procurement on April 20.  Kisan Sanghrash Samiti Secretary Mandeep Nathwan said the government should exempt farmers from getting registered on the governments web portal Meri Fasal Mera Byora, adding that the record of their crops is available with revenue officials. Farmers have been asked to get registered themselves on the portal till April 19. Online e-gate passes for entering the mandis are issued to only those farmers who are registered and verified on the web portal.  Haryana Additional Chief Secretary (agriculture and farmers welfare), Sanjeev Kaushal said about 10,000 metric tonnes of mustard was procured from around 4,500 farmers on the first day (Wednesday).

And for foodies out there,the ongoing quarantine period could be a bit of challenge. While eating out is not possible, and most of us are avoiding takeaway options of whatever is available due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, satisfying those cravings means eating whatever packaged junk is available at home or even trying to cook unhealthy options. We have been eating more than our regular appetite. Also being at home constantly due to the lockdown is resulting in eating out of boredom as well.  Nutritionist Nisha Bareja, says, Eating unhealthy food continuously is going to overtax your digestive system because whatever you put in body has to process it and foods that are high in salt and sugar will increase your urge to eat more. She adds, Eat your meals mindfully so that your leptin hormone can function well. Also chew your food well to minimise further cravings and have a glass of water before eating anything when you feel hungry.  Nutritionist Neeta Thapa Saikia gives some tips and recipes to douse those unhealthy cravings:  1. Replace some source of carbohydrates with protein in the form of egg, lean meat, beans peas curd and healthy fats like groundnut and other nuts.  2. Add besan (dry roasted gram flour) and oats to wheat and make dough for roti. This way, you can replace some amount of carbohydrates with protein and fibre.  3. Consume lots of liquid like water, soup, lemonade and coconut water at frequent intervals.  4. For healthy snacking  mix together a handful of roasted groundnut, 2 small cup of muri (puffed rice), a handful sprouted moong, 1 tablespoon grated raw papaya, chat masala, lemon juice and sprinkle some mustard oil to it.  Read: Lockdown woes: Cooking more, eating more, but weight? It can wait!  5. Roasted chana along with chopped onion, a dash of lemon juice and mustard oil is also a healthy snacking item.  6. For healthy but low calorie snacks, fruit and vegetable salad is a good option. Use chopped apple, sprouts, chopped cucumber, cabbage, thinly sliced ginger (it is known to reduce appetite and increase fullness), lemon juice, chopped green chili and some olive oil.

Have you started making the best use of raw mangoes this season?  In a number of households around the country, it is time for all other souring agents to take a backseat, as mango gets to rule not just the taste buds but also the day-to-day menu. Raw mangoes are in the market now, and the sight of them brings to mind thoughts of a multitude of dishes, from pickles to desserts.  Traditionally, there are many Indian recipes that do justice to the fruity sourness of raw mango. When one falls from a tree, the one who picks it up cannot decide whether to eat it raw with a sprinkle of salt and chilli or cook it in a dal. Says Madhu Reddy of Aiyor Bai farm, an organic mango farm in Telangana, Every year, I usually have an excess of raw mangoes from the farm. That is not even the time for it to be pickled. So every year, I take them to the organic Sunday market, where they literally vanish within hours. Raw mangoes are sold throughout the year these days, but a true-blue raw mango lover will only buy it during the season.  Sun dried shrimp and raw mango | Photo Credit: Special arrangement  So what is the best time to buy and indulge in raw mangoes? Madhu says that in South India, this fruit becomes the go-to menu decider only after March. Telugu people go all-out with their raw mango dishes post-Ugadi (Telugu New Year), adds Madhu.  As the heat kicks in, mango boiled raw with sugar and mixed with salt and spices like jeera  or aam panna as it is popularly called  becomes the favourite family drink. So does ice gola with syrup, or some instant mango pickles. Or how about a mimosa cocktail with raw mangoes?  The advent of summer and abundance of crop then is a major determinant of our food habits, points out Madhu. That could be the reason why eating raw mangoes is an emotion, and the mention of it brings rushes of childhood memories that include gorging on tangy-sour slices with salt and chilli, or stealing semi-sun-dried mango pieces meant for pickles. Raw mango is that one piece of the puzzle that can easily connect people through generations and states with their mango memoirs.  A lot of the credit for this goes to its clean sourness that comes with a slight prickle. It lacks the acrid bite that makes limes; this makes a raw mango much more bite-friendly, says Abhinav Gangumalla, an organic urban farmer in Hyderabad.  MasterChef India Season 6 winner Abinas Nayak says, More than a souring agent, I consider mango a flavour enhancer. Its acidity alerts the taste buds. I love it with fish or prawns, but my favourite is the amba-charu, an everyday treat in the South of Odisha. This is made from sun-dried mangoes. During the early season, when mangoes fall from the trees, they are collected and cured in salt and chilli powder in a pot. When the fermentation begins, the ingredients in the pot need a good shake everyday, so that all the mango pieces are well-coated in their own juices. It takes about 10-15 days for the mangoes to dry. To make the amba-charu, a few pieces of the dried mango need to be soaked in a desired quantity of water. Once it is soft and pulpy, it is cooked for a few minutes with tadka. It is an excellent sun-dried mango dish and goes well with rice.  Moving away from traditional dishes, Chef Thimma Reddy of The Park Hyderabad has tried experimenting with it for fritters. Is he satisfied with the outcome? I am. The only trick is to not select very sour mangoes to make fritters. And it needs a sweet-spicy chilli dip to round the flavours, suggests Thimma.  Those who are not up for fritters, can always make the all-time favourite, a good old raw mango dal that holds pride of place in all our childhood memories.  Here are recipes to try.  Raw mango & chilli sorbet  Ingredients  2 raw mangos  135 gms sugar  80 ml water  Optional: 1/2 tsp red chilli powder or 1 slit green chilli  Method  Boil the raw mango in a pot of water for 30-45 minutes or until soft. Meanwhile, melt sugar with the water in another saucepan until it reaches a thin syrup consistency. Keep aside. Once the mango is cooked, peel it, remove the seed and make puree of the cooked fruit. Heat the fruit puree along with the sugar syrup and add the chilli. Keep on a low heat for about 5 minutes until it is a cohesive mix. Strain into a flat dish but make sure you get all the fruit in. The green chilli can be taken out at this step. Chill in the freezer for 2-3 hours until frozen. Scrape with a fork and serve immediately.  Chef Payal Rajankar of Chennai-based The Gourmet gig.  Sun-dried shrimp with raw mango  Ingredients  250 gm sun-dried prawns  100 gm raw mango juliennes  50 gm onion juliennes  Salt to taste  10 gm turmeric powder  20 gm red chilli powder  10 gm coriander powder  10 gm mustard seeds  1 sprig of curry leaves  10 slit green chillies  Fresh coriander to garnish  Method  Heat oil, add mustard seeds, once they crackle, add onion, green chillies, curry leaves and saut till onion gets transparent. Then add the powder masalas, add a few tablespoons of water to keep the mix moist. The add the sun-dried shrimp and raw mango and mix well. Cook with lid for 10 min, put off flame, remove lid, sprinkle little lemon juice, add chopped coriander and serve with rice.  Recipe by Chef Thimma Reddy, The Park",MUSTARD OIL

And if these issues continue to persist despite trying out various remedies and treatments, it is advised you take a look at the root cause  which includes sleep patterns, intake of any external pills, and even diet. So are you doing it right?  Highlighting the same, dietitian Lavleen Kaur pointed out in a facebook video, First, we need to find out the reason for hairfall. Is it because of crash dieting where you are losing out on the good nutrients like vitamins, minerals and proteins? Or is it because of issues like use of birth control pills, hypertension and blood thinners? Even after paying attention to your diet, you may witness hair fall if you do not sleep properly, are under stress or your water intake is not adequate.  So once you have identified the issue, make sure to include these superfoods in your diet, she advised.  Sesame seeds  Both black and white sesame seeds are rich in calcium.

Pulses are a rich source of protein that is essential for hair growth.  A combination of all these can help in hair growth and prevent greying.  Along with food, it is also necessary to have an exercise routine. Sleep needs to be regulated as stress should be managed well.  She also suggested hair care remedies.

I only know of traditional pachadis. Do we even have salads? asks my mother-in-law when I take my query to her. To my surprise, I get the same response from Swaran Kumar when I ask her for a traditional Punjabi salad. But later she calls back to diffidently offer, theres kachumber. I dont know if that fits your requirements.  She also points out that this recipe has evolved. People now add bell peppers, raw mango, cabbage, carrots, all finely chopped or grated. As she talks, it occurs to me that nuts and seeds would also add some crunch and I make a mental note to try it out.  Punjabi Kachumber  Ingredients:  1 cucumber; 2 tomatoes ripe; 1 onion ; 1 tbsp coriander leaves; 1 green chilli; 1/2 black pepper powder; 1 tsp lemon juice; Salt to taste  Method: Chop all the veggies finely and mix. Add all the seasoning and toss to mix. Adjust salt according to taste and serve chilled.  My mother-in-law also tentatively suggests kosambari. While the traditional recipe uses only cucumber, a colleague uses cabbage and adds peanuts for what she calls the crunch factor. Other variations use sprouted green gram and veggies like carrots and peppers, and pomegranate seeds.

Leave it to dry for a few minutes and then place in a bowl. Peel and chop the cucumber into tiny pieces. Add to moong dal along with coconut, green chillis and coriander leaves. Mix well. In a small kadai, heat the oil and add mustard seeds. When it splutters, add asafoetida and curry leaves. Pour over moon dal mixture. Mix the lemon juice and salt when youre ready to serve.  In Saee Koranne-Khandekars Pangat: A Feast (Hachette), I light upon a few traditional Maharashtrian vegetable and fruit-based salads, though those that have yoghurt dressing fall into the raita category in my head. But it does have a tantalising kairichi dal (Raw mango and channa dal salad), which she kindly allowed me to use. Until a few years ago, she writes, this dish used to be a ubiquitous offering at haldi-kumkum parties that women hosted in the month of Chaitra (around March-April) when the raw mangoes come to the market.  Khairchi Dal  Ingredients:  1 1/2 cups channa dal soaked for 3-4 hours; 3/4 cup raw mangoes peeled and thinly grated; 1/2 fresh coconut scraped or grated; 1/4 fresh coriander finely chopped; 4tbsps oil; 1 green chilli; 6-8 saandgi mirchi; Salt to taste; 2tsp sugar (adjust according to mangos sourness)  Method: Drain the channa dal and place in blender along with the green chilli. Grind to a coarse paste without any extra water. Transfer into a mixing bowl. Add the grated raw mango, coconut, coriander, salt and sugar. Heat oil in a pan, add the saandgi mirchi and fry turning frequently to ensure even browning. Take off the heat and add the chillies and some of the oil to the salad. Crush the chillies lightly and mix gently. Serve cold.  Note: Saangdi mirchi is made by de-seeding and slitting the big green chilli, stuffing it with a paste of coriander, fenugreek and mustard seeds (all coarsely crushed) and mixed with sour yoghurt, and drying it in the sun.

One of the key elements of the state government's strategy has been ""innovative steps and out of the box thinking"".As soon as the first three-week lockdown was announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his address to the nation, the state government launched a digital platform to register the volunteers which has proved to be the backbone of the states fight against Covid-19.More than 63,000 volunteers registered with around 900 doctors and 800 nurses as well as around 2,100 paramedic staff. Their presence is across the state and it is aiding the government and health authorities efforts to fight corona virus and ensuring home deliveries of essentials to households wherever required.During the lockdown, the chief ministers office was directly monitoring the situation and ensuring people get help in exceptional circumstances.Every morning the CMo gets the rate list of essential items for all the necessary items and wherever the supply is short and prices are high , the supplies are moved to that district from where they are in abundance. This has kept the prices of essential commodities under control with sufficient availability.A control room for the state has been set up which receives call and addresses the concerns of the people across the state on real time basis. Senior-most officials of the state personally sit in this control room everyday and they themselves also take as many calls as they can.Haryana government was the first to set up shelters for migrant labourers and take care of them. The state police was given instructions that no migrant labour should be harassed in any manner. The state was well aware that the migrant labourers would be required during the harvesting season and also their movement could jeoparadise the health safeguards meant to be observed for protecting spread of coronavirus, so shelters for labour were set up where they were provided sufficient supplies. Most of them were set up in the state government schools. The state is also keeping a close watch on the situation ensuring that the industrial workers should get paid by the employers.In addition to volunteers registered with Haryana government for providing supplies and health services, the self help groups have also come forward.Today in Haryana about 10,000 metric tons of mustard was procured by the state govt from about 4500 farmers on the first day of the procurement season by calling 25 farmers each in the morning and 25 in the afternoon at all the 163 centres. After testing the new system of social distancing on first day from Tomorrow 50 farmers at a time will be called at all centres in the morning and afternoon.Manohar Lal Khattar reassured the farmers that they would not face any difficulty in the mandis and each and every grain of their produce will be procured.Keeping in view the threat of Covid-19 and to facilitate the farmers, arthiyas and labourers, the State Government had increased the number of mandis and had made arrangements for masks, sanitizers including cleanliness and all the basic facilities to keep them safe during the sale of their produce in this time of crisis.It has been decided that 50 farmers each will be called in the morning and evening at each procurement centre to sell mustard so that there is no overcrowding and those present can follow the directions given for prevention of corona by maintaining social distancing.Here is a note COPASS, transit pass management software for supply chain services:During first 15 days of lockdown the deputy commissioners implemented the instructions quite religiously. Nevertheless, there was huge pressure in offices to issue passes/curfew passes/transit passes. The capacity was limited. It impacted movement of goods and supplies. Sensing this problem, ministry of food and consumer affairs collaborated with e-government foundation to create an application - COPASS. This COPASS software is a trust-based application where in a designated authority of the company is allowed to generate bulk passes for company employees with out burdening the District administration who is already working under severe pressure.The application is handled by a nodal officer appointed by the state who will receive a online request from supply chain companies/ firms. These companies will register themselves on the app and designate an authorised signatory as representative of the company. Further, the state govt will also appoint approvers to process these requests. The application contains two dashboards. First, a requesters dashboard where the firm will upload the details of employees who are allowed to operate during lockdown period and an Approvers dashboard where the approvers appointed will accept the requests of firms. Most important feature of this application is that the approver will allocate a quota for each company based on the nature of operations. While truck operators like Rivigo are provided 100% quota, pharma & Research Organizations are allocated 35-40% quota of employees.In 36 hours more than 90 firms have leveraged this facility.

Money is being deducted in the name of moisture content from farmers who are arriving with their mustard crops in the market. They are being denied full crop rates. The buying process is so complex that it is beyond the comprehension of most farmers. Instead of buying crops in one lot, farmers are being called to the mandis repeatedly. This increases the transportation expense and also forces them to make unnecessary trips to the mandi, thereby breaking lockdown and social distancing rules, Hooda said.  He said the government has purchased about 5% mustard (of its estimated production) in the last three days. Based on the trends so far and the arrangements made, it seems difficult if the government will be able to buy the entire crop within the schedule. Farmers are given one-day notice to sell their crops and they get the message only a day before the date of purchase. Therefore, it becomes difficult for them to make arrangements and reach Mandi at such a short notice, Hooda said.  He said the government should coordinate with grain merchants and should make them the handling agents.  A spokesperson of the agriculture department said the procurement of mustard will continue till every grain is purchased. About 82,886 metric tonnes of mustard has been procured from 32,779 farmers in the first four days.

While addressing mediapersons, the minister said he came to know that at many areas some officials and commission agents are deducting the cost of mustard grain in the name of moisture content. He said strict action will be taken against such officials and commission agents if they reject mustard seeds of the farmers.  He said farmers must register themselves with the Meri Fasal portal.

The farmer has to stand for hours even to get the token. The farmers are given one days notice to sell their crops as they get a message only one day before the date of purchase.

The leader of opposition urged the government to put the system in order and said it was necessary that the government should coordinate with the grain merchants and they should be made handling agents. The government should buy the grain of the farmer as promised. For this, the date of purchase should be extended further. The government should stop harassing the farmer in the name of moisture content and instead of calling in the market over and over again, they should buy the entire crop in one go. The process of registration of farmers who could not register on the portal should also be completed on the spot, Hooda said and added that these suggestions should be adopted not only for Mustard but also for buying wheat.  The procurement of mustard is nearing the end and the purchase of wheat is about to begin but the disputes between the government and the grain merchants have still not been resolved. I have repeatedly demanded that the government proceed with the purchase process as per the agreement reached with the agents. In this time of difficulty, it is not right to put new processes in place. This will only increase the problems of all concerned and will directly harm the farmer.

State agriculture minister J P Dalal has, however, maintained that mustard procurement was going on smoothly across 163 centres set up for the purpose.  At a press conference through video link, Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala alleged that chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar and his deputy Dushyant Chautala have ""confined themselves in air-conditioned rooms"", whereas they should be visiting 'mandis' to see the problems being faced by farmers.  He claimed that Khattar has ""not visited a single mandi"" so far, while Chautala went to ""only a small mandi in Yamunanagar and the Uchana mandi in his constituency"".  ""Mustard procurement has completely failed, it is for the first time since Independence farmers are facing this problem,"" Surjewala said.  He said the BJP-JJP government had committed to procuring the entire crop, but farmers at several places in the state have complained that not all of their produce was bought.  The Congress spokesperson gave the example of a farmer with eight acres of land who, he claimed, had registered himself on the government portal for selling 80 quintal of mustard, but only 32 quintal was procured.  Mustard is grown mainly in south Haryana and ""if the government cannot smoothly procure the crop in five to six districts, imagine what will be the fate farmers may face when they will bring wheat for procurement in the entire state from April 20"", said Surjewala, who had been a minister in the state.  Haryana agriculture minister Dalal has said the state government remains committed to purchase entire produce of the farmers.  Alleging mismanagement in mustard procurement, Surjewala also alleged that when the process began on April 15, the commissioned agents, through whom the payment is routed to farmers, were asked at the eleventh hour to open accounts in seven private banks although they already had accounts in the nationalised banks.  ""Arhitiyas (commissioned agents) are like mobile banks for farmers and both sides mutually settle account when the growers get money after selling crops.  ""Now, one fails to understand the impractical move of asking Arhitiyas to open their accounts in private banks. Has the government become an agent of private banks that it wants to favour them in this time of crisis,"" he posed.  Surjewala said that keeping in view the present lockdown situation, he had earlier suggested to the state government to declare 10,000 registered 'arhitiyas' in Haryana as mobile purchase centres.  ""The arhitiyas enjoy a close association with farmers. They are locally connected and in this time of lockdown that would have been the best thing to do to help farmers.

Renu breaks down every time, says Yadav. (Express Photo by Santosh Singh)  Four days and nights he pedalled with his cart, hoping that if he tried hard enough, he could get from Old Delhi to Madhubani in Bihar. He made it as far as Gonda, half-way to home. A fortnight later, he is still there, afraid even his body wouldnt make it to his village if he gets COVID-19, as his family keeps urging him to return. The Indian Express reports on a familys despair and its growing worry, that no one might care enough for poor like them  Shaheed-e-Azam Sardar Bhagat Singh Inter College, Gonda, UP  A CARTON containing a television set, a stove, a red bag with four shirts, three trousers and a pair of jeans, a handful of steel utensils and two big plastic containers  just enough to fit into a handcart. It is all Sandeep Yadav owns. At 2 am on March 27 when he left Old Delhi in a hurry, Yadav put it all onto the cart, and rode. And rode. Two well-dressed men came and told us there were buses taking people home. Everyone started running. I decided to pedal my way back I couldnt leave anything as I didnt know when I would return I can take my cart anywhere in NCR  Shahdara, Gurgaon, Noida. So, I thought, if four of us take turns pulling it, we can reach home, says Yadav, looking older than his 37 years (he is not sure) in his lean frame, tired eyes and salt-and-pepper beard.  Home is Madhubani in Bihar, around 1,100 km from Nai Sadak in Old Delhis Chandni Chowk where he lived. He made it as far as April 1 and 670 km, when he was caught by police along with four others, including his brother Ramanji, and brought to a shelter in Gonda. There were others in the group who rode their rickshaws from Delhi with him, and managed to escape.  Follow Coronavirus LIVE Updates  Ramanji fled the shelter the next morning, hitch-hiking on trucks, reaching home in five days. But Yadav couldnt; he couldnt take his handcart.  At the shelter at Shaheed-e-Azam Sardar Bhagat Singh Inter College in the Gonda district headquarters, 14 days later, there are 63 of them  22 caught coming from Jaipur, seven belonging to Jaipur, two from Himachal Pradesh, two from Jalandhar, six from Indore, four from Meerut, six from Bihar and two from Nepal. The largest chunk are from different districts of UP itself.  Cots have been put up for them in the corridors, with mosquito nets draped on each.  Read | By revealing magnitude of migrant worker phenomenon, COVID-19 points to rural distress  Recalling those five days when home seemed just one more pull of the cart away, against the heat and throbbing body ache, Yadav says he and the others would start while it was still dark and keep going till 10 pm, with halts. We would start peddling at 3 am, cook a heavy meal on my stove and eat around 8 am, take two hours of rest and set off again. At 3 pm, we would take our lunch and go non-stop till 10 pm. Then, we would park somewhere  near a temple, a hotel  take a nap for three hours, and start all over again.  Yadav left Delhi with 2 kg of rice and arhar dal each, a litre of mustard oil, 2 litres of kerosene for the stove, and some borrowed money. The rations were not enough, but people helped us, Yadav says, opening shops to give them food items along the way.  Their bigger fear was police. However, Yadav says he was in for a surprise. Police are never kind to the poor. But it was a policeman who helped us cross the Delhi-Uttar Pradesh border at Bareilly. He was a bada sahib, I know because of the stars on his dress. We somehow reached Barabanki, but then, near the Ghagra river, we lost the others because my brother wanted to rest, says Yadav. When the day passed and we still could not catch up with them, five of us decided to halt near a petrol pump for the night. Then, police came.

What is difficult to bear are the hours that stretch on, with little to do, and worry for the family and the wheat crop ready for harvest back home.  Yadav has a basic Nokia phone, and a prepaid connection giving him unlimited calls for Rs 149 a month. A friend in Delhi charged it for him just that day, he says. After the recharge, I got a call saying I had won some prize. For a second, I thought it was true, but then I told the operator not to bother me, he says. His two teenage children tried their best, but he never could get the hang of a smartphone.  Yadav calls home at least four-five times a day to catch up with them and wife Renu Devi. I ask if they have food, other essentials. Not that I can do anything, but I can give them advice.  Sandeep Yadav with his possessions still in his cart, at a Gonda shelter for migrants. Yadav left Delhi in the middle of the night of March 26-27. (Express Photo by Vishal Srivastav) Sandeep Yadav with his possessions still in his cart, at a Gonda shelter for migrants. Yadav left Delhi in the middle of the night of March 26-27. (Express Photo by Vishal Srivastav)  Yadav tries to pass his time sweeping the school corridors and, often, when no one is looking, watering the plants around the college. I need something to do, otherwise I keep thinking of home, says Yadav, worried that somebody may object. I dont know if taking water from the toilet for the plants is allowed.  There are four toilets for the 63 of them, but one is out of use as the door is broken. They wash and bathe in the open, fetching water from the toilet.  Explained | Indian migrants, across India  Yadav has dressed carefully for the meeting, in a bright-blue shirt with dots, black trousers and a cap saying security, with a ballpen clasped onto his breast pocket. As he talks, his eyes keep dropping down to his feet, shod in dusty rubber sandals.  Smiling shyly, Yadav says he always hoped to become a security guard with the government  perhaps explaining the cap. He has been wearing it since he found it on the road near Bareilly.  I have led a hard life, pulling a cart, working as a labourer. A guards job is good, one only needs to be alert.  Born to a poor farmer family with seven children, Yadav never went to school. The maximum any one of the seven brothers studied was the eldest, Raj Kumar Yadav (60), who finished Class 12 around four decades ago. All of them work as daily wagers in Delhi, though three are currently back in the village. Their parents Ramdev (80) and Tetli Devi (75) live with either of their sons families.  Yadav has hopes of a better life for his children  Rahul, 17, and Priyanka, 19. No, there is no connection to the Gandhi family, he corrects.  Meghnad Desai writes | Need a plan to help migrants  Pulling the cart around NCR, mostly delivering stationery supplies, Yadav would earn about Rs 15,000 a month. Every two weeks, he sent Rs 2,000 home. He has been getting anxious calls from wife Renu. He says he initially told them he would stay at the shelter for 14 days and would be allowed to leave after the quarantine. Now, I am hearing I cannot go till May. About returning to Delhi, he doesnt expect it for another couple of months.  Yadav last went home in March 2019. He planned to visit this month, for the wheat harvest. The crop is ready and my wife and I are constantly fighting. Yesterday, she said I am enjoying my time here. However, I know she said it because she is worried. She is scared we will have to sell our buffalo. She cries every time we talk on the phone.  The buffalo and a calf that the family owns is their best investment, Yadav says. Their milk ensures a regular income. Now my wife is saying she might sell the buffalo because we need money to repair our house. We have a kuchcha house that needs to be rebuilt every year.  Read | Indias coronavirus lockdown will spotlight migrants role in cities  His heart breaks talking to his son, Yadav adds. I think he lies to me about whether he is getting enough food, I think he is worried about me. I have not sent money for more than 20 days If my family dies there or I die, who will be responsible?  Its 1 pm and the smell of the food being cooked in a temporary kitchen is wafting in. Semul Mandal, from Katihar district in Bihar, lying on the next cot (they are kept 2 ft apart), his eyes glued to his smartphone, quips, It seems there is something special on the menu today. Like Yadav, Mandal made a living pulling a handcart in Delhi, and was brought to the shelter the same day as him.  Yadav says he sees people glued to their mobiles watching videos, listening to songs, but it doesnt attract him. If I was educated, maybe I could have learnt using those phones but I dont feel it is necessary.  He doesnt think about the food much, he adds. Humein yahaan khoya bhi khila dein, toh woh mitti jaisa swad dega (Even if we are served the best of dishes here, they will taste like mud). Our heart is at home.  However, he confesses, he is always hungry. Manual labour means he is used to eating more and often.  Food is served four times a day at the shelter. Breakfast, around 9 am, is usually tea, biscuits and poha; for lunch and dinner, green vegetables with dal, rice and roti; while for evening snacks, it is bread with tea or bread pakodas.  The menu is decided by Amit Kumar Pandey, the in-charge of the shelter on behalf of the Red Cross, which is managing it with the local administration. Pandey says guidelines have been issued by the government regarding the food, while a counsellor comes and speaks to the residents at least twice a week.  According to Pandey, it is mosquitoes that are a major issue. After they made several complaints, mosquito nets and repellants were arranged by an NGO. We couldnt make sleeping arrangements inside the classrooms as the benches are screwed to the ground, he adds.  Among the officials posted at the shelter are two lekhpals, two police constables, five members of the Red Cross, and three locals hired as cooks for Rs 1,500 per day.  Suddenly, sounds of clapping can be heard from the other side of the building. Some bank personnel have come to distribute hand sanitisers and masks. Garlands are exchanged and congratulations expressed. One of the residents, passing by Yadavs cot, says, Roz kuchch na kuchch tamasha hona zaroori hai (There has to be a show every day).  Yadav hasnt had a bad experience with the officials, but one incident left him shaken. A few days ago, he says, They brought three new people and one of them refused to eat till he was given a blanket. A policeman made him stand with his hands on the wall and caned him. I asked the officials why they didnt just give him the blanket, as it comes with the bedding, in a packet. He was then given a blanket, but he cried all night.  According to him, he didnt see the three again. Someone said they escaped.  Gonda SDM (Sadar) Veer Bahadur Yadav, who has nine such shelters under him, denies this.  Gonda District Magistrate Nitin Bansal says, Some of the shelters are being funded by NGOs, while others are being run by funds from the district administration. The Sardar Bhagat Singh Inter College one is being managed by the Red Cross. The food and other facilities are looked after by the organisation.  Regarding testing of the labourers for coronavirus, Bansal says only those who showed symptoms were tested. None of the migrants has tested positive in the district. Gonda had only one case till Saturday, of someone who came from Delhi.  But the government is being careful since an 18-year-old migrant labourer from Bihar tested positive at a UP shelter on April 11.  While he can usually console himself that he just has to wait through this period, Yadav has questions. Why did the government bring in Indians from countries that had cases? Why were those people allowed to enter but we are being locked up? The government says we will be secure if we stay put, but how can we be secure if one half of a family is in Mumbai and the other half in Bihar or UP? Am I more secure with 60 others than my own home? Why cant we be sent to our villages, are there no policemen there, no doctors?  There is another gnawing question  that if he dies at the Gonda shelter of COVID-19, would even his body reach home? I have heard there are problems with cremation of the people who die of the disease. Who will transport my body from here to Madhubani? Yadav asks.  He concludes there is only one answer to all his questions. It is because I am poor I dont think the government has time for people like me.  On April 13, the Uttar Pradesh government announced that people from within the state can return home after they had completed 14 days in quarantine, but stay 14 days more in isolation once there. In Gondas nine shelters, only about 100 of the 300-odd are from within Uttar Pradesh.  Around 3 pm on April 15, SDM Veer Bahadur and a policeman arrive at the Gonda shelter, separate 20 of the migrant labourers, and ask them if they want to go home. They all nod repeatedly, smiling.  Passing by, helping carry foodgrain bags to the kitchen from a mini-truck, Yadav realises whats going on. He does not say anything, puts the bags down in the kitchen, goes to his bed and sinks into it.  He hasnt made many friends at the shelter, he says, his pain acute that no one from his district or village is here. I wake up and everyone I see is a stranger.  His head clutched in his hands, Yadav adds, Though I am happy they are going home, this will make the wait worse If officials allowed, I would leave I can only hope. Ummeed bahut zaroori hai (One cant lose hope).  In a few beds around, several men are packing their belongings already, starting with folding of the mosquito nets. Yadav glances at them, then fixes his eyes on the wall, refusing to look their way.  Birsai village, Madhubani, Bihar  A narrow, half-metalled road takes one to Nav Toli in Madhubani districts Birsai village  a cluster of 40-odd families with small agricultural plots and at least one member working outside the state. Sandeep Yadav left for Delhi to work over 20 years ago.  Wife Renu says they hardly spent any time together as a couple. They got married on March 8, 2000, when she was barely in her teens. For the first time last year, we were together on our wedding anniversary.  Every time he calls from the Gonda shelter, on son Rahuls smartphone, the family crowds around it, while wearing their masks, putting Yadav on speaker phone.  When he calls up on Thursday afternoon, Renus first question is what he had for lunch. Its rice, dal and a vegetable. Yadav tells them he feels like running away from the shelter, but that he is not sure if he can get past officials with his cart. Is there a pass for a thela, like for other vehicles? he wonders.  To lighten the mood, Renu queries him about their wedding date. As Yadav replies correctly, Rahul and daughter Priyanka smile.  Renu says she is somehow managing with the money they have. According to her, no government help has reached the family. Says Rahul, Our ration card is linked to Aadhaar, but we have not got the Rs 1,000 government relief. Or the free 5 kg rice and 1 kg pulses for a month.  Bihar Deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi earlier said, All 1.68 crore ration card holders in the state would get free rations by this month end.  Birsai has more than 400 migrant workers.  While Priyanka gave her Class 10 board exams recently, Rahul will appear next year. Priyanka wants to do some professional course after Class 12, while Rahul says their fathers struggles have left him wanting to become something in life.

However, Priyanka and Rahul did visit the Capital once, when they were very small. Priyanka says they always hoped to return.

You can still see them online, a list of food and drinks you might be able to order for delivery. (Do it; support your local restaurants.)  But some dishes belong firmly in a restaurant dining room; they arent designed to travel from chefs kitchen to your house. French fries invariably arrive soggy; cheeseburgers arent better for the trip. The No. 1 dish you shouldnt order for delivery is one with eggs, especially if theyre not scrambled and tucked into a bacon, egg, and cheese sandwich.  By extension that means that a hall-of-fame bistro dish, the runny egg and bacon-adorned frisee salad, should not be ordered for delivery. Its also a staple on steakhouse menus, and why not? Its hearty enough to be a meal, with thick pieces of crispy, fatty bacon and at least one oozy egg balanced on a bed of vinaigrette-soaked greens.  For everyone whos now craving that salad, Susan Spungen is here to help. Spungen was the founding food editor at Martha Stewart Living, creating the cult of casually perfect pies and mac and cheese. She also styled the dishes that co-starred in movies such as Eat, Pray, Love and Julie & Julia. She is, essentially, a professional home cook, with the ability to create idealized versions of go-to dishes.  In her new cookbook, Open Kitchen: Inspired Food for Casual Gatherings (Avery, $35), Spungen delivers an array of those recipes. The book highlights a smart, appealing entertaining styleone that can only be shared through a Zoom screen at the moment but will return. (Shes also become an expert at food that can be made ahead, a result of waiting on film sets for Meryl Streep and Julia Roberts to come out of hair and makeup.)  One of the appealing dishes in Spungens book is her take on that bistro salad. In her version, kale replaces the standard curly frisee lettuceits tossed with a mustardy dressing made with the bacon drippings. She also adds buttery toast sticks to the salad for dipping in the soft egg yolk. Its one of the most indulgent bistro dishes, she explains. Its got all the good things in it, but its very quick and simple to prepare.  One of the best things about the dish might be the way she hacks the tricky job of poaching eggs. She steams them, in their shell, for a precise amount of time (6 minutes). They emerge ready to be peeled with a photogenic soft, oozy center. Its a fantastic trick to keep in mind the next time you make eggs Benedict or especially when the day comes that youre making soft-yolked eggs for a crowd. Its the crown of a substantial salad that you dont want to have anywhere but home right now.  The following recipe is adapted from Open Kitchen. Make sure the pan you use to cook the eggs is big enough to hold the steamer basket or colander and that theres a lid.  Bacon, Egg, and Kale Salad  Serves 4  3 tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil2 thick slices sourdough or whole wheat bread, cut into 3-inch sticks lb. (about two -inch thick slices) slab bacon, cut into 1/2-inch-thick pieces1 small shallot or garlic clove, minced cup low-sodium chicken stock2 tbsp. red wine vinegar1 tbsp. grainy mustardSalt and freshly ground pepper bunch tender kale, such as red Russian, stems removed and leaves torn into bite-size pieces (5 cups, softly packed)4 large eggs, cold  In a medium skillet, heat 2 tbsp. of the oil. Add the bread and toast over moderate heat, tossing, until browned and crisp, about 10 minutes. Transfer to a plate. Add the bacon to the skillet and cook over moderately low heat until crisp but still soft, about 13 minutes. Drain on a paper towel.  Pour off all but 1 tbsp. fat from the skillet. Add the shallot and cook until softened, 5 minutes. Add the chicken stock and reduce by half, 5 minutes. Stir in the vinegar and mustard and bring to a boil. Stir in the remaining 1 tbsp. oil and season with salt and pepper; keep warm.  In a medium saucepan, add  inch of water and set a steamer basket or small colander inside. Cover and bring to a boil over moderate heat. Add the eggs to the basket, cover tightly, and steam for 6 minutes. Transfer to a bowl of ice water and let cool for 1 to 2 minutes, then peel and rinse the eggs. Toss the kale with enough dressing to coat the leaves, season with salt and pepper, add the croutons, and mix thoroughly. Top with the bacon. Cut each egg in half, set on the salad, and serve with any extra dressing.  (This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text.)

Sushen Dang and Keerti Narang.  Yeh shaadi bhagwan ke kripa se ho raha hai (This marriage is taking place thanks to the mercy of god), says Pandit PS Tripathi solemnly. Theek se sunai nahi de raha hai (I cant hear properly), a disembodied female voice suddenly pips up as the famed TV astrologer from Raipur began to chant mantras rapidly; somebody else shush-es the woman. Its hard to pinpoint who these voices belong to on the Zoom call attended by 100 people  relatives of Sushen Dang and Keerti Narang who tied the knot online last evening. As Tripathi extolled the grace of god frequently during the ceremony, it was another mighty power that made this union possible  the internet.  With the COVID-19 pandemic showing no significant signs of slowing down, some Indian couples are moving their wedding plans online, and big businesses such as Shaadi.com are leading the way. Not long into the national lockdown, the company introduced Weddings from Home, an initiative to help couples across communities, cultures and religions participate in wedding rituals that are conducted from the comfort of their homes over a video call. Their first wedding of the kind took place on April 14, between Gurgaon-based Avinash Singh Bagri, 31, and Kirti Agrawal, also 31, from Bareilly; their ceremony was presided online by a priest in Kanpur. For Dang and Narangs virtual nuptials, Shaadi.com went on Facebook Live  nearly 200 people logged on to watch the ceremony, many commenting with surprise and snark in equal measure, while others congratulated the couple.  At his parents home in Andheri (west), Dang was dressed in a mustard sherwani; hed borrowed a necklace from his mother along with one of her dupattas that was fashioned into a turban. The 26-year-old competitive intelligence analyst for an American startup moved to Toronto, Canada as recently as January and was in Mumbai for work in February when the pandemic began to spread outside China. Ours is an arranged marriage; our relatives suggested the match and we began talking online last summer. We got engaged in October and the wedding was supposed to take place on April 19 at Corbett National Park. When it looked like it wasnt going as planned, a friend told me about the online option. It works for us because we can go ahead with our plans while being safe. I think this will become a trend because even after the lockdown is lifted, things arent going to return to normal anytime soon, says Dang, who had no trouble convincing his parents and relatives to opt for an online wedding. After all, the court registration had been completed in February. His bride-to-be, a 25-year-old make-up artist from Bareilly, had to talk her family through the process but they came on board soon enough. I couldnt collect my outfit so Im wearing my mothers wedding lehenga. Thats really special for me. Sushen and I started our relationship online anyway, so this felt like the next logical step, says Narang.  On Sunday evening, her brother kept adjusting the volume on their screen so that her parents could follow Tripathis instructions correctly, who was speaking as loudly as possible, trying to complete all the required rituals within the shubh mahurat. Mem-bers of Narang and Dangs clan joined the Zoom call within minutes of going live: some were dressed for the occasion and watched from their living rooms, others stayed in bed and tuned in.",MUSTARD OIL

Ironically, they are now finding ways to minimise losses despite the Centre relaxing lockdown norms for agriculture and allied activities starting Monday.  Breather for Cities, Plunderer for Farms  Just as farmers were dealing with the perils of coronavirus lockdown at a time when harvesting of rabi crop is supposed to be at its peak, untimely rains late on Saturday across most parts of North India exponentially increased their fears of a crop failure.  Hailstorms hit fields in Punjab, Haryana and parts of Uttar Pradesh exactly when wheat and rabi crops were just starting to be harvested.  ""Any amount of rainfall on ready, standing crop during the harvest season is hugely damaging. Saturday's thunderstorm will be causing major losses to farmers,"" said Pushpender Singh, a farm leader in Uttar Pradesh.  Meanwhile, intermittent rains during the weekend in Amritsar have made farmers worried about their ready crops.  Several farmers informed that rain would increase the moisture content in grain and that they would face difficulty at markets as the procurement agencies would not buy grains with moisture more than the permissible limit.  They further explained that Rabi crops require less water, low temperature, less humidity and moderate sunshine. Untimely rains during the harvest season only spell havoc for the crop produce.  The India Meteorological Department (IMD) forecast had said that a western disturbance would affect the western Himalayan region, which could bring scattered rain and thunder showers over the northern plain region on April 17 and 18.  Sukhdev Singh, general secretary of Bharatiya Kisan Union said, ""Rains will damage standing wheat crop at several places. The government should compensate farmers for their crop loss.  He claimed that there were not enough tarpaulins to cover produce which was brought to mandis by wheat growers in rain-hit areas.  Chief Agriculture Officer of Punjab, Dr Harinderjit Singh said, The flattening of crop has been reported. The rainfall received in the district ranged from 4mm to 6mm. It is scanty but would delay the harvesting.  Punjab's Special Chief Secretary KBS Sidhu also tweeted, saying, Compensation, rather the relief, shall be distributed expeditiously out of this State Disaster Relief Fund (SDEF).  Normally, when untimely rains hit, farmers begin panic harvesting but that is not possible this year because the government has restricted assembly of people. Moreover, several farmers complained that machines used to harvest referred to as combiners, in local parlance, are yet to arrive, further delaying harvesting.  The problem was further intensified when migrant labourers, who usually double up as agricultural workers during the harvest season, left towns for their native places after the sudden imposition of lockdown.  No Harvesters, no Labourers  Immediately after the sudden announcement of lockdown, migrant labourers had set off for their homes. Some reached while others are still stuck at various camps setup for their stay. As a result, there is shortage of agricultural labour in villages, thus delaying the harvest at a time when the temperature has already started to soar.  According to the International Labour Organisations estimates, which is based on Census 2011 figures, around 24 lakh migrants work in fields across India.  Ministry Home Affairs on Sunday said that migrant labourer will be allowed to travel for work within the state with certain conditions but will not be able to cross borders. We have permission to harvest during the lockdown, but theres no labour available. My entire family has been manually harvesting the crop since last week,"" said Raju Singh, a wheat farmer in Madhya Pradesh.  Added to this is the delay in arrival of combine harvester machines that are responsible for more than 85 per cent of the harvesting activities in the country. On an average, farmers informed, harvesting takes three days using machines. The same activity is performed in seven days when agricultural labourers use bare hands. Now, in the absence of both, farmers estimate a delay of close to two weeks.  Lack of machinery and labour has also propped up the problem of storage. As a result, farmers have decided to delay harvesting as much as possible in the absence of any directions from the government on how to manage the produce after it is cultivated.  Several farmer organisations have requested respective state governments to ensure availability of combine harvesters that are stuck in various states. They have also sought adequate space in warehouses to store their produce till they get labourers to take it to the market.  Harvester operators from north India usually go to central and western parts of the country in winter to help farmers cultivate wheat there. During this time, they return to states like Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh to help harvest the rabi crop. Farmers in Haryana said many mechanical harvesters are stuck in states such as Maharashtra, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan because of lockdown curbs.  Low Demand Resulting in Excess Produce, Plummeting Prices  Those farmers who are somehow able to harvest their crops and transport them to markets are being greeted with lack of demand in mandis. With most industrial and restaurant activity coming to a standstill, demand has nosedived, resulting in unprecedented dip in prices, especially of perishable goods.  To understand the impact of the pandemic on markets, consider this: per quintal price of gram in Maharashtra's Latur has dipped to Rs 3,650 whereas the minimum support price (MSP) for the crop is Rs 4,875. Similarly in Rajasthan's Alwar, the market price of mustard currently stands at Rs 3,600 per quintal almost Rs 1,000 less than its MSP.  In Karnataka, tomato prices crashed by over 50 per cent, from Rs 1,290 a quintal last year to Rs 560 now.  Ladies finger rates are also down by nearly 40 per cent. In Punjab, green chillies, cucumber, capsicum and cabbage are lying dumped at mandis for lack of buyers.  Farmers across Maharashtra, Punjab and Haryana informed that there are hardly any buyers in mandis. ""I have hired carriers by spending double the amount to transport my crops to the mandis but to no use. Three days since I found a sizeable buyer,"" said Mahesh Kumar Singh, a farmer in Haryana.  Devappa Anna Shetti also known as Raju Shetti, former Member of Parliament from Maharashtra and a farmer leader explained the difficulties peasants in the state are facing.  ""Not just the harvest of rabi crops, farmers have not been able to transport their vegetables to the markets for sale. Those who have, are returning with almost their entire stock. Government buying has just started. These vegetables are transported to various states. Without that, mandis in the country will have serious shortage of supply. Farmers will get no money. The lockdown will impact the famers not just for this season but will financially dent their capacity to buy for the next year as well,"" he said.  Despite these serious concerns, India may not have to go hungry in the near future.  As per Second Advance Estimates for 2019-20 released last week, total food grains production in the country is estimated at record 291.95 million tones, which is higher by 6.74 million tonnes than the production of food grains of 285.21 million tonnes achieved during 2018-19.  The production during 2019-20 is higher by 26.20 million tonnes than the previous five years (2013-14 to 2017-18) average production of food grains.",MUSTARD OIL

A three-week nationwide lockdown was imposed in the country on March 25 to curb the spread of the deadly coronavirus diseases (Covid-19). The lockdown was subsequently extended till May 3, however, the Central government had suggested conditional relaxation in some lockdown norms from April 20. After a video conference with Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Sunday, which was attended by all district magistrates in the state, the Gautam Budh Nagar administration decided to continue with the lockdown as it is, in light of the rising cases in the district.  Given the high number of hot spots in the district and the rising number of Covid-19 positive patients, the district has to be careful and precautionary measures need to stay in place. In light of this, businesses or commercial services, private or public, will not start. All citizens, officials, and workers will have to continue to follow the lockdown rules as before, said Suhas LY, district magistrate in an order on Monday.  While daily wage workers suffer amid the lockdown with no source of income, the business class is also incurring sizeable losses and small and medium business owners being the worst hit.  For now everything is at a standstill. We continue to pay our employees who have been with us for years, while we are not generating any income. The gravity of the situation will hit us when the store will eventually be opened, said Anita Singh, owner of a stationery shop in Sector 18.   Many offices, that have been allowed to operate, keep contacting us for stationary, but we are unable to supply them with anything because of the lockdown, said Singh adding that despite students being in need of basic stationery items and notebooks for their online classes, many shopkeepers like her are unable to provide them.  The retail sector in the district has taken a huge hit, and many business owners believe that their problems will not end even when the lockdown will be lifted.   We are only spending money and not generating any income. Even if the lockdown is lifted next month, the consumers will not rush to shops to buy items. There will be no gatherings any time soon. People will prefer to purchase goods online. We will need a lot of outside economic help to restore the balance. At least, for the rest of this year, buying shoes and garments will not be a priority for anyone, said Sachin Paul, owner of a shoe shop.  There are about seven crore traders in the country out of which 15 million traders deal in essential commodities.Due to the lockdown, between March 25 and April 14, the retail trade has suffered losses to the tune of 3.15 lakh crore, said Sushil Kumar Jain, convener, Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT), Delhi-NCR.  Amid the lockdown, most shopkeepers and business owners who deal with non-essential services and items have not been able to check in on their stocks for more than three weeks.  Electronics, garments among other things require regular maintenance, but that is not an option during the lockdown. Even after the lockdown is lifted, the situation wont go back to normal for months, and some businesses may never be able to recover at all. The most affected are the small and medium business owners, said Jain who is also the president of Sector 18 market association.  For smaller businesses, the economic crisis has hit their means of survival. Neelam Devi, who ran a tea stall with her husband in B block, Sector 63, has been trying to make ends meet for her family for over a month now.  There were so many offices around that the tea stall always had people coming over. We had a steady income and would make around 1,200 on a good day. But now we have no idea when will we be able to get back on our feet and set up our stall again. We have four children and we dont know how will we continue to feed them. We are from Bihar, and we could neither return home nor do we have any means to earn now. It took us four days to get ration from the government, said Neelam. We have received a food packet from the government which has rice, wheat, pulses, mustard oil, and salt. It should last us for about 8 to 10 days.  Suman Rai, an electrician who lives in Shahdara village, Sector 141 was hopeful of starting his work again after he had heard that the lockdown might be relaxed from April 20. I stay with my nephew in Noida, and with no work, for almost a month all my savings have dried up. We got free ration once about two weeks ago, but it has also finished. With no money and no work, its becoming very difficult to survive. Although many of my clients are calling me for repairing jobs and other things, I cannot do anything because of the lockdown, said Rai, who is from Samastipur in Bihar.

After the meeting, the opposition party reiterated its demand for immediate direct cash transfer of Rs 7500 in all Jan Dhan, pension and the PM-Kisan scheme accounts to enable the poor and the needy sustain themselves during the lockdown period.  Giving details of the meeting, former union minister Jairam Ramesh said the Congress panel will prepare a detailed plan for revival of MSME together with steps to ensure smooth procurement of wheat, mustard and gram besides resolving the pressing issue of stranded migrant workers and submit it to the central government in a day or two.  Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Saturday formed the consultative committee under the chairmanship of the former Prime Minister to deliberate on current matters, including those related to the Covid-19 outbreak, and formulate the partys views on various issues.  The 11-member group also comprises former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi, partys chief spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala, general secretary in-charge organisation KC Venugopal and former union ministers P Chidambaram, Manish Tewari and Jairam Ramesh.  The other members of the group are technology and data cell chairman Praveen Chakravarty, spokespersons Gaurav Vallabh and Supriya Shrinate, and social media department head Rohan Gupta.  Ramesh said the panel will meet every other day to discuss the important issues faced by the country due to the pandemic.  We have worked out a very concrete MSME revival package which we will submit to the central government in a day or two, Ramesh said, addressing a news conference through video conferencing.  He said both the former Prime Minister and Rahul Gandhi insisted that absolute priority be given to the MSME sector, which has social and economic importance and is the second largest employer after agriculture.  Ramesh said the Congress will also make positive recommendations to the government to ensure smooth crop procurement and resolution of the problems of stranded migrant workers.  He said the party once again urged the government to transfer Rs 7500 to all Jan Dhan accounts, all pension accounts of the elderly, differently abled and widows, and also those under the PM-Kisan scheme.  I am sure a compassionate and a responsible government can find funds to provide for the vulnerable, he said when asked if the country has funds of this nature to spare.  It is the matter of priorities. It is absolutely essential for the survival of tens and thousands of people who need immediate assistance to tide over the crisis, added Ramesh.  He said the Congress will keep giving constructive suggestions to the government and hope it will take those positively. Rahul Gandhi too had also advocated constructive support to the government in his press conference last week.  We need to work with the government in these difficult times with a positive mindset. We are extending our hand for constructive cooperation and hope the government will come down from its pedestal and accept our positive suggestions. We are giving these suggestions on behalf of the people of India, Ramesh said.  The panel in its next meeting will discuss the lockdown exit strategy after May 3.  Ramesh also alleged that the Centre was busy destabilising the Madhya Pradesh government and was caught napping in preparation for managing the Covid-19 pandemic as a result of which the action got delayed.  The government did not act on time while dealing with the crisis and was busy in toppling the government in Madhya Pradesh. The government only woke up on March 23 but this is no time to play politics, he said.  Separately, a meeting of the Congress Working Committee (CWC) has been called on Thursday to discuss the Covid-19 pandemic and the lockdown situation.

The Congress group, of which former party chief Rahul Gandhi and former Finance Minister P. Chidambaram are members, will submit a detailed report to the government on the revival of the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) as well as streamlining the procurement process of crops such as wheat, mustard and gram.  Addressing the media through video conferencing, former Union Minister Jairam Ramesh said the group would meet every alternate day and also discuss a smooth transition out of the lockdown on May 4.  Right now, the most urgent thing in the country is cash transfer, as people have to survive. Peoples livelihoods have been destroyed, lakhs and lakhs of families need immediate assistance. We are not talking about assistance for the next three months, but today, tomorrow, the next few weeks, he said.  Also read: Lockdown only a pause button, testing is the only weapon, says Rahul Gandhi  I think a compassionate government, a sensitive government or a responsive government must and can find the resources for 7,500 direct transfer to the three accounts that I have just mentioned. Its not a question of whether we can find the funds, we must find the funds, Mr. Ramesh added.  Apart from the Jan Dhan accounts, he said that by directly transferring cash to beneficiaries of the Pradhan Mantri Krishi Samman Nidhi (PM Kisan) and old age, widow and handicapped persons pension schemes, all the needy rural households would be covered.  The Congress Working Committee (CWC) will be meeting on Thursday to discuss the pandemic and lockdown situation. This will be the second CWC through video conferencing.  MSME sector  The group said that priority must be given to the MSME sector because of its social and economic importance as well as it being the largest job provider in the country. Dr. Singh and Mr. Gandhi also stressed the need to extend constructive cooperation to the government for smooth crop procurement and resolution of migrants issues.  The idea of this group is to make specific recommendations to the government in a spirit of constructive cooperation as has been emphasised by the former Congress president [Rahul Gandhi] repeatedly and we will also be discussing how to make the transition out of the lockdown after 3rd May, 2020... what are the steps that have to be taken to smoothen the transition for different sections of the society, particularly the migrants, students and farmers, Mr. Ramesh said.  The Congress leader said that though the party had reservations about the governments initial response and handling of the COVID 19 crisis, it was focussed on giving a positive feedback for now.  Yes, we have criticised that the government should have taken steps while they had the time, but they were sleeping. Until March 23, they [the Centre] didnt take it as seriously as they should have or the fact they waited until the Congress government in Madhya Pradesh was toppled. These are the facts, but today we discussed giving positive suggestions, Mr. Ramesh said.  He said he hoped the government would come down from its pedestal and constructively accept the suggestions put forth by the Congress.  We are not making demands, we are giving suggestions to the government on behalf of the people of India.

Around 24,987.25 metric tonne of mustard has also been procured.  Sanjeev Kaushal, additional chief secretary, agriculture and farmers welfare department Haryana, said that on Monday, 8,693 farmers reported at 163 procurement centres for procurement of mustard and 9,729 wheat farmers reported at wheat procurement centres.  Kaushal said 161 mustard farmers contributed Rs 1,94,819 and 44 wheat farmers contributed Rs 1,97,151 to the Haryana Corona Relief Fund. At a few places, including Uchana in Jind district , a few farmers staged a dharna and raised slogans against the state government alleging discrepancies in procurement.  This year, the state government staggered procurement of the rabi crop in view of the prevailing conditions due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Procurement of mustard started on April 15 and procurement of wheat started on April 20. The state government has made it clear that procurement will continue till the entire crop is purchased.  In Karnal district , 100 farmers in the big grain market and 50 in small purchase centres were called in two-shift to avoid overcrowding.  Long queues of tractor trolleys remained stranded for hours outside the Gharaunda grain market as many of farmers came with the produce without any prior intimation. Soon after getting the information, police reached the spot and sent those farmers back home, who were not called by the authorities. In Assandh grain market, arhtiyas (commission agents) remained on strike and did not cooperate with the district administration in purchasing of the crop.  Haryana is one of the largest producers of mustard and wheat. In 2019, area under wheat crop was 25.53 lakh hectares and total production was 125.73 lakh metric tonnes. Area under mustard crop was 6.09 lakh hectares and its production was 12.54 lakh metric tonnes in 2019. The state procured 6.19 lakh metric tonnes of mustard and 93.60 lakh metric tonnes of wheat at minimum support price last year",MUSTARD OIL

Obviously the flight got cancelled. What could I do? Although I work, and am based, in Kerala, I am a British citizen. I have worked and lived here for more than a decade, so this is not a foreign country.  I am staying with Malayali friends at South Londons Croydon, which has a considerable population from Kerala. Essentials of Kerala cooking are available here; I have been busy cooking and posting food on my social media. In fact, each meal I cook, which is almost everyday, I upload.  My specialty is Kerala cuisine and I have stuck to it even for my videos. I try to post different meals  from breakfast to dinner. Of the recipes I posted, the most popular was a simple chammanthi (chutney) made of green chilli, tamarind, coconut oil and salt. We have it with so many things, for example with boiled kappa (tapioca) and kanji (rice porridge). Then there is my neymeen Nirvana: king fish poached in coconut milk with spices and cooked in banana leaves.  Most of what I cook are our staples  puttu-kadala (black chana) or payar (green gram) curry, fish curry, mussel stir fry, kalan, vazhapoov (banana flower) thoran, pachadi, upma, dosa  rather than fancy foods. I devoted a week to upmas and used, besides semolina, alternative such as quinoa, wheat, and barley.  Green mango yogurt pickle Ingredients: 3 finely chopped green mangoes, 6 chopped green chillies; 50 ml coconut oil; 10 gm ustard seeds; 2 dry whole red chilliies; a few curry leaves; 1 gm Kashmiri chilli powder; 5 gm turmeric powder; 10 gm roasted fenugreek powder; 5 gm hing/ asafoetida powder; 5gm cumin powder; salt to taste; 300 gm thick curd  Method: In a bowl mix the chopped mango, green chilli and spices together and keep aside. Heat oil in a pan, add mustard seeds, red chilli and curry leaves, add the mango mixture. Cook on a low flame, and saut for 3-4 minutes, add a little water and mix well. Take it off the flame and let it cool down. In a bowl add the cooked mango pickle and curd and mix well. Check the seasoning and serve cold.  Recipe by chef Suresh Pillai  I occasionally make salads too , nothing fancy, just simple ones with dressings that have salt, pepper, lemon and honey; also as a means to encourage healthy eating.  This is a good time, I feel, to eat and cook responsibly and sustainably. To make use of what is available in our backyards, like jackfruit, papaya, colcassia, plantain flower, yam, tapioca, and moringa. It is better than straining our already strained resources, and very nourishing too. Food shortage could be a real thing, as a result of the lockdown we need to re-examine the way we eat. We could think of incorporating wheat into our diet, and make one meal wheat-based since it is cheaper.  I have also been making use of this time to interact, via Instagram, with those who follow me. They have so many questions about food, cuisine, and cooking. I realised that there are some in the restaurant industry who dont know basics like the cuts of meats, that each is different. I am making use of the time to educate and create awareness.  This is the first time in my 25-year career that I have faced such a situation. Though I feel stuck occasionally, I get to use my time to indulge in my hobby  cooking  in ways that are helpful to others who call with questions related to food or a recipe I have shared.

Farmers, now harvesting wheat, mustard and pulses, are facing labour shortage and absence of transport facilities due to the nation-wide lockdown imposed to contain the Covid-19 outbreak.  My wheat harvest on two-acre land was drenched in the rain last night. This has delayed wheat husking (removing the wheat grain from the husk). The process requires wheat to be dry. If it rains in the next two days, I will be in big trouble, said Surat Ram Verma, a farmer in Malihabad, Lucknow.  Manoj Yadav, a farmer in Rae Bareli district fears the loss of his mustard harvest due to the rain. The mustard seeds fell from the pod and got mixed with soil. This has made it impossible to recover them. I have lost around half my produce, Yadav said.  According to experts, rain at this time of the year is not a new phenomenon and occurs almost every year but the delay in harvest caused by the lockdown has made the rain this year doubly painful for farmers. Farmers had to delay harvesting by an average of eight days due to the lockdown. This left them very little time to finish harvesting before the rain hit them, said Surendra Khetrapal, a Lucknow-based agriculture expert.",MUSTARD OIL

However, there are always doubts, which can hinder the cultivation of the habit. Contrary to popular belief, Smita Shirodkar, founder, Earthoholics, a city-based urban farming initiative, says gardening is one of the easiest hobbies to take up and one doesnt need to have a green thumb to make happen. Nature has proven to have a relaxing and therapeutic effect on the mind, therefore, having plants indoors or around our home helps us stay calm, she says.  So, how does one go about playing around with mud, plants and water? One of the most important aspects of gardening, Shaan Lalwani, city-based horticulturist and founder, Vriksha Nursery, says is figure out how much sun you get and figure out the plants you want to grow before you get your hands dirty. He adds that people can grow food from kitchen scraps such as chilli, pepper, tomato, carrots and potatoes, which also helps people get super tasty homegrown food. Smita, who also believes in using the kitchen to the fullest, says, Microgreens like fenugreek (methi), coriander and mustard are easy to grow as every home has it in their kitchen cabinets and they harvest in 15 days. Smita adds that herb plants like mint, basil, aloe vera are easy to plant too, simply using the leaves of existing plants can help you get started.  herb plants like mint, basil, aloe vera are easy to plant too, simply using the leaves of existing plants can help you get started  If beginners feel confident and want to take it a step further, they can grow them in terrariums (transparent containers for plants). During such times, a parcel container, shoebox or pet bottles can make for easy containers to keep plants indoors. If it is a big jar or glass tank, then one could choose medium-sized or proportionate indoor plants. Whereas, if you have a small container that you wish to use then go in for miniature varieties of indoor plants, informs Shirodkar. However, there are quite a few challenges to keep an eye out for like excess sunlight and root decay which could affect the plants, so keeping them moist or in places with indirect sunlight is important. While it may seem easy, watering can also be an issue - not knowing whats too much or too little can be a nightmare, so getting a moisture gauge stick can help people take their first step into gardening.

The important portfolios of health and home were allocated to senior BJP leader Narottam Mishra. Another important portfolio of agriculture and farmers welfare went to BJP MLA Kamal Patel.

He indicated portfolios will then be reallocated.  After working alone for nearly a month since he took oath on March 23, Chouhan expanded his cabinet after facing criticism that the one-man cabinet was proving unequal to the task as the count of positive cases and death toll continued to climb.  The Cabinet expansion, it is learnt, was delayed because the BJP was finding it difficult to strike a balance between its senior leaders and Scindia loyalists.

The main wheat producing areas of Punjab and Haryana had not yet begun harvesting during this period.  Mandi prices for these crops were about 29% higher than the previous year. Going forward, bumper crop output, lower industrial demand and limited exports [will] exert downward pressure on wheat prices, said the analysis.

The situation is slightly better with regard to winter paddy and coarse grains with a 68% drop in arrivals. However, prices are also down about 2%, due to a drop in demand for coarse grains from industries and animal and poultry feed manufacturers.  Jute and cotton arrivals have plummeted 99%, but prices have also dropped 31% due to lower demand.  Fruit prices have also dropped 9% at the mandi, though the quantity of arrivals is 85% lower than the previous year. The lockdown has prevented exports of seasonal fruits such as mangoes and grapes, and also limited domestic demand, said CRISIL.  Vegetable prices rose sharply during this period increasing 83% at the mandi, even as arrivals dropped 75% due to restricted market access by farmers. However, CRISIL said farmers were not likely to be receiving much benefit from the increased prices that consumers are paying, as middlemen are estimated to be procuring at much lower prices from farmers given their limited bargaining power due to the perishable nature of commodities.",MUSTARD OIL

Express photo  THE HARYANA government and Opposition have locked horns over the ongoing crop procurement process in the state. While the government maintains that it stands committed to buying each and every grain from its farmers, the Opposition on Wednesday slammed the government, alleging chaos and mismanagement at the grain markets (mandis).  Former chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda called Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar and raised concerns about the chaos and slow pace of crop procurement. During the long phone call, Hooda highlighted mismanagement in mandis too.  Drawing the chief ministers attention towards an emerging crisis, Hooda appealed that the government make the procurement process more smooth by coordinating with arhtiyas (commission agents) and farmers. Arhtiyas have gone on strike in several mandis of the state, accusing government of bypassing them in the process.  At the speed at which the government is procuring crop, the wheat produced by the state will take at least 3-4 months and the process will go on till August. The purchase of mustard is even slower. The farmer is worried about how they will sow the next crop as the already harvested crop will take months to be sold. It is important to increase the pace of purchasing the crop in the broader interest of the country and the state, Hooda said.  I told the chief minister that the Opposition does not want to play any politics during this period of pandemic and stands with the government in every possible way. But it would be a great injustice to remain silent after seeing the unbearable condition of farmers, who have got nothing to do with the politics. A farmer feeds the entire country. It is the responsibility of everyone, whether in government or Opposition, to raise the voice of the farmer and ensure they get justice, Hooda told The Indian Express.  Today, the merchants are agitating and the government is adamant. The farmer has to bear the consequences of their confrontation. First paddy, then mustard and now the wheat produced by the farmer is getting ruined due to the stubborn attitude of the government. Farmers are struggling to sell their crop. Even after several rounds of meetings, there was no agreement between the arhtiyas and the government. Farmer is reaching the mandis across the state with his crop but he has neither been able to sell mustard crop, nor is his wheat being sold, Hooda added.  The Congress leader also blamed the governments new experiments for the ongoing chaos at the mandis. This mismanagement in procurement is taking place because the government is busy trying new experiments in the buying process at a time when the world is facing a pandemic. The government should have made the procedure instead of introducing new concepts that nobody has the time or patience to understand at this hour. The governments of Punjab, Rajasthan and other states have also carried out purchase the old way and the process is running smoothly, Hooda said.  The chief minister has assured me that he will speak to both Arhtiyas and farmers and find an amicable solution to the problem, he added.  Procurement will be completed in time: Dushyant  Deputy Chief Minister Dushyant Chautala, however, said that the government stands by its commitment with the farmers and will ensure that procurement is completed within the stipulated time and both farmers and arhtiyas are paid their dues.  After procurement, while arhtiyas will get their payments within two days, the money will reach farmers accounts within three days. The procurement is unnecessarily being politicised. Since April 15 when the mustard procurement commenced, approximately 58,000 vehicles were issued gate passes in mandis and over 1.56 lakh metric tonnes of mustard has been procured.

The situation is dire for small, marginal and tenant farmers in containment and red zones like Mewat. While large-scale farmers are availing the benefit of contacting buyers and traders online, small-time farmers say they are left in the lurch due to their digital illiteracy, overseeing massive losses.  Add to this, the strike and opposition to cheque payment to the farmers by the Arhtiyas (commission agents) have decelerated the procurement process.  Many farmers claim they have been resorting to distress selling of their crops, registering Rs 800 to Rs 1,000 losses per quintal, which is much below the minimum selling price (MSP). In my village, not more than 10% have been registered due to the cumbersome registration process. Now, the unregistered farmers have been resorting to distress selling. Many have been selling it to traders for Rs 3,000-Rs 3,500 per quintal, while the MSP fixed by government is Rs 4,425 per quintal, said Rafiq Azad, a local farmer leader.  Besides this, farmers have complained that there have been cases where there was variation in weighing of their produce at their local stores and that at the mandis. Moreover, for the mustard crop, the government has fixed 7.5-8% moisture as the permissible limit for procurement. While poor farmers were sent back if the moisture was above the limit, there were cases where even after 11.5% of moisture the crop was procured. We opposed this and took the matters to the officials. After much protest ,they finally agreed to take crops with 9.5% to 10% moisture, said Mohammed Haji Ali of Kheda village.  Adding to the miseries of the farmers, the transportation challenges, limited gate passes, and strikes by the Arhtiyas have further made procurement process anything but smooth, contrary to the claims of the administrations of several districts. Even though Mewat has increased procurement centres from April 21, farmers are struggling with transportation and other logistic issues like passes. The tardy process may continue for several weeks and this will impact the sowing cycle of next crops, argued Dharambir Singh of All India Kisan Sabha.  Meanwhile, Mewat administration has claimed that from three anaj mandis and 10 procurement centres set up for wheat procurement in the district, about 28,040 quintals of wheat has been procured from 206 farmers. Similarly, about 3,867 metric tonnes of mustard have been procured.  Responding on the increasing complaints about the procurement and mismanagement at the centres, a district administration official told TOI, Senior officials have inspected the centres. Also, as per the recent orders from the government, a grievance redressal committee has been constituted in each mandi of the district. A member of the said committee will be present in the market during the daily purchase.",MUSTARD OIL

The method allows for the cultivation of veggies, greens and pulses without the use of soil or fertiliser. From sowing seeds to harvesting, the entire life cycle of a crop can be carried out from the comfort of ones home.  Sabu is cultivating green gram, pulses, ragi, fenugreek, asparagus, mustard and other regional crops which can be grown in trays or flat bowls by using coconut husk. Tissue paper or pieces of cloth can also be used for the same. This mode of cultivation can be done by everyone. Once the seed germinates, the saplings can be sowed in flat trays set with husk.  The leaves will start sprouting in a few days. One can start using the leaves to make salads or to cook from the very first week. The plants have to be removed in seven days as the nutrient content goes down with time. They should be exposed to sunlight and should be watered three or four times a day. One tray of husk can be used for about three cycles, said Sabu.  The project is a part of the assignment I have been giving to my SPC students with regard to Break Chain-Make Change campaign.

Interest in vegetable gardening seems to be on the rise during lockdown. Here are two random examples pointing in this direction  Raghu Kumar of Organic Garden Foundation reports that calculating the first thirty days of the lockdown, point to a spurt in membership that is three times the average monthly increase. Prakash Rajasekharan of Inspiring Organic Terrace Gardens talks of a gallop in the numbers.  It may have to do with the desire for self-sufficiency, fuelled by the ongoing hardship in purchasing vegetables; and two, availability of time due to the lockdown as a factor encouraging fledgling home gardeners to pick up new skill.  But now, resources for beginner and fledgling gardeners wont be readily available. Those with green thumbs, especially those engaged in regenerative farming, however say it is a problem that can be tackled, effortlessly and cost-effectively  well get to that in a bit.  Here are two stories, both rooted in the lockdown  one from a terrace in Jafferkhanpet and the other from a balcony in Nungambakkam  that prove home gardening is an environmental, social and civic intervention.  For Lakshmi Venky, a terrace gardener, her 1,500 sq.ft terrace at her house in Jafferkhanpet defines self-sufficiency during these times.  All the summer veggies are available at my terrace garden, and I step out only for very few vegetables, says Lakshmi. That can be a great blessing during the lockdown.  Lakshmi reveals she shares some of the produce with friends and neighbours, which strengthens social connections.  However, the most powerful and now-pertinent point of social caring she is driving home is how gardening can make things easy for conservancy workers.  Civic & social action  Every terrace or home gardener worth their salt compost at home. Wet waste makes up the biggest portion of household waste, and if families compost, that will be taken care of at the household level itself. Such a situation can be a great help to conservancy workers especially during the COVID-19 crisis when they are stretched to their limits, points out Lakshmi.  Besides, there is a lot of recycling that can happen on account of terrace gardening, adds Lakshmi. Old discarded mugs and pet bottles can be used as pots, thereby preventing them from polluting the environment.  From kitchen waste  Maya Ganesh, a regenerative agriculturist, had cleared the plants in her balcony garden in Nungambakkam, relocating them to another place, as she was going to be away from Chennai for a long time.  Her plans fell through unexpectedly due to the COVID-19 crisis, and then the lockdown happened.  That is when she raised a garden from the scratch, on the same balcony.  I just used the cuttings from what was meant for the kitchen  Pasalai Keerai / Malabar Spinach stalks, Mint stalks, Ceylon Pasalai Keerai stalks/ Ceylon Spinach, Karpooravalli/ Indian Borage cuttings. And then bulbs and root vegetables, says Maya, adding, small onions can be grown for onion chives (the leaves); garlic chives; beetroot tops for edible leaves; pineapple tops, sepankazhagu bulbs, shooting ginger roots can be grown. For seeds, you just have to look in the fruits basket: You have fresh papaya seeds, musk melon seeds, methi/ vendayam/ Fenugreek greens from seeds, and mustard seed microgreens.  For the pots, Maya used takeaway containers plus whatever empty pots that she already had. She explains, You need to make a hole at the bottom of the takeaway containers, plug the hole with a stone or any broken piece and fill it with whatever soil or compost you have.",MUSTARD OIL

Whats more alarming for him is that there is no person to transport it for procurement process amid the ongoing national lockdown.  The crop is ready and its procurement time has already begun, but all the labourers on my farm have returned to their villages and so have the transport people. If the crisis doesnt end soon, the crop will go waste, he said.  This is the story of many such farmers across the country. Despite a decent production of Rabi crops  almost same or a little more than the previous year  harvesting and procurement concerns haunt them.  For instance, last year, a total of 99.87 million tonnes of wheat was produced, while this year, the production went up to 102.19 million tonnes.  Another major Rabi crop  mustard and rapeseed  also saw an increase in production. While 84.3 million tonnes were produced last year, the production has increased to 93.3 million tonnes. Farmers, experts, associations for migrant workers and transport associations are worried alike for the harvest and procurement.  Experts said the government must plan the harvest and procurement of Rabi crops like they are planning in advance for the Kharif season.Anand, a senior official of the Institute of Rural Management, said it was already too late for the planning.  Plans should have been made for Rabi first and then for Kharif. Tonnes and tonnes of Rabi crops are awaiting harvest. If the situation does not improve, the government will not have any crops to procure, he said.  Migrant workers are also equally concerned. I have been working in the fields of Punjab for around seven years. This time, I was forced to leave Punjab and go to my hometown in Meerut. My employer will lose his crop and I will lose my earnings as I have been for the past two months. We need special buses or transport to ensure productivity resumes, a migrant worker staying at a shelter home in Anand Vihar said.  The Centre, in its fresh guidelines for the extended lockdown, while giving relief to the agriculture sector has refused to dilute transport restriction, thus, rendering thousands of migrant workers helpless and stranded.  A former agriculture secretary reminded how he had warned of the crisis. I had earlier said that Rabi planning was the need of the hour. Also, I had suggested that a special transport be arranged for migrant workers to undertake agriculture labour work. Both suggestions were not heeded to and the results are there in front of everyone, he said.",MUSTARD OIL

And it is perfectly alright if you dont have rolling fields of mustard to nurture your green thumb. Your terrace is fine too. Agricultural scientists Vishwanath Kudur and Rajendra Hegde say if you follow the science of growing plants, you will be a successful urban farmer.  Kudur and Hegde conduct workshops on terrace gardening. As these sessions have been suspended, due to COVID-19, Hegde answers questions on social media and conducts online sessions.  Hegde, born in Honnavara into a farming family, holds a doctorate in Agricultural Entomology from the University of Agricultural Sciences, Dharwad. He spent 15 years working with farmers to help them grow crops by adopting the right strategies to manage pests. As programme coordinator at the resource NGO, Agriculture Man Ecology Foundation (AMEF), he has trained dryland farmers in sustainable practices.  When I met Vishwanath in 2004, he was already propagating terrace gardening. We conducted national seminars to propagate sustainability by growing crops in containers, says Hegde, who also worked for the organic farming wing of Vittal Mallya Scientific Research Foundation. He co-founded the BRICS LLP in 2015 to re-think and build on pest management practices for urban foodscapes.  Vishwanath started Garden City Farmers to promote organic terrace gardening in 2011. Hegde is one of the founder trustees. In a place like Bengaluru if people can have healthy gardens, it is a boon. After a while people get disappointed as they dont know how to manage pests that attack their plants. One need not kill insects, they have to be managed. Just like human beings, plants too need good health to ward off insect attacks.  During the lock-down, Hegdes phone and mail are inundated with questions on how to start a healthy garden. These are the basics people need to know about the overall management of plant health.  Seeds  For healthy, well-yielding plants, seeds have to be big, pest free and viable, Hegde says. There is nothing called organic seeds. Seeds are seeds or planting material, and there is nothing organic or inorganic about it. The idea behind urban gardening is to promote native or local types that have evolved in the local environment. Crops grown like this are better than hybrids, which need different conditions to thrive. One needs to source seeds locally through gardeners or suppliers of native seeds only for the first time. Then one can learn to produce and collect viable seeds by leaving the first fruit to mature on the plant. Remove the seeds and dry them in the shade for about a week. Select big seeds and store them in a paper cover or bottle in a cool place and they will last for a year.  Seedlings and germination  Small, medium and big seeds have to be handled differently. Leafy greens, such as amaranthus, coriander, spinach, methi and mustard have small seeds and can be sown in rows with narrow spacing. Bushy vegetables such as tomato, brinjal, chilli, capsicum, cabbage, cauliflower, khol-khol have medium size seeds. They are raised in nurseries in trays, coffee cups or milk covers in a soft growing medium and transplanted. Bhindi, ridge gourd, bitter gourd, cucumber, beans have big seeds and should be planted singly (seed dibbling). They can be transplanted or directly raised.  Containers  Containers are not as important as what goes into them, says Hegde. You have to choose the size depending on what you are growing. Milk covers, broken buckets, wheat, rice, cement or jute bags can be made containers. Pots in mud, coconut coir and jute fibre can also be used. UV-stabilised grow bags are the latest additions in the market.  For bushy crops such as tomato, brinjal and chilli, a one cubic feet container will do.  For creepers/climbers/vines, such as ridge/bitter/snake/ash or bottle gourd, cucumber, chow chow, a 1.5x1.5x1.5 foot holder is fine. For perennial crops such as curry leaves, lime, sapota, guava, hibiscus or jasmine, a 2x2x2 foot container is a minimum requirement.  Growing medium  This would be made of three parts compost and one part soil. The compost should be a mix of 40 % manure (cow or horse dung, goat or sheep pellets) 40 % vermi compost or earth worms; five % plant cakes (neem, hongamia, mustard or groundnut); 10 % cocopeat/leaf powder; four percent rock phosphate (available in agri-input or garden shops or nurseries) and one percent bio-fertilisers/humic acid granules for organic supplements of primary and secondary nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorous potassium calcium, magnesium and sulphur. Manure can be replaced with homemade wet-waste compost.  Placing the pots  Direct sunlight is more important for nearly 50 kinds of food crops. Dispersed light from the sides is good enough for many crops such as leafy greens of any kind, including lettuce. When you distribute the pots prudently, it is another step in the right direction and requires perfect planning.  Soil-less medium  While soil-less mediums can be used, they do not supply all the required amino acids. This is the difference between safe food (surakshita aahara) and functional food (poushtika aahara).  A workshop on pest management on urban foodscapes will be on Facebook live on May 2 at 11 am and a workshop on sustainable agriculture on May 3.

In a statement, the ministry said PSS has been operationalised for procurement of pulses and oilseeds growing in the rabi season of 2019-20 crop year (July-June) in seven states -- Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana.  Among pulses, about 72,415 tonnes of gram (chana) have been procured from five states -- Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Rajasthan, Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh.  About 1.20 lakh tonnes of tur dal has been procured from seven states -- Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Gujarat and Odisha.  In case of oilseeds, the Centre has purchased 1.83 lakh tonnes of mustard seed from three states -- Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana, the ministry said.  As per the second estimate of the ministry, pulses and oilseeds output during 2019 rabi season has been pegged at 15.11 million tonnes and 10.75 million tonnes, respectively.  According to the ministry, standard operating protocol (SOP) related to crop harvesting and threshing is being adhered to by farmers and workers.  States have been asked to ensure compliance of SOP in order to protect the health of farmers and farm workers and contain the spread of coronavirus.  Meanwhile, wheat harvesting across the country is continuing at a brisk pace amidst the COVID-19 lockdown.  As reported by the states, nearly 99 per cent of wheat crop has been harvested in Madhya Pradesh, 92-95 per cent in Rajasthan, 85-88 per cent in Uttar Pradesh, 55-60 per cent in Haryana, 60-65 per cent in Punjab and 87-88 per cent in other states so far.

122,122.0,,,2020-04-28,https://www.news18.com/news/india/diminished-agricultural-selling-may-now-impact-indias-ability-to-feed-after-coronavirus-pandemic-2596237.html,"New Delhi: More than a week after the Centre relaxed norms on agriculture and allied activities, farmers have been unable to sell their produce. Lack of harvesters, labour shortage, lacklustre storage facilities, untimely rains and a dying demand are now starting to point towards a supply constraint that may eventually manifest itself much after India expectedly emerges out of the coronavirus pandemic.  With the non-availability of machines and agricultural labour, Ramesh Prasad and his son took half-a-month to harvest their wheat farm and another three days in storing and transporting it to the 'mandi'. They have hardly been able to sell anything for the past two days.  ""There is hardly any demand. There are no takers in mandis. Prices have come crashing down,"" said Prasad, a wheat farmer from Madhya Pradesh.  Similarly, in Uttar Pradesh's Khairpur village in West Greater Noida, farmers had to either return home with their produce or sell them at negligible costs.  Santu Singh, a local farmer in the area, was forced to strike a deal at a quarter of the usual costs.  I sold chilli at Rs 10 per kilo. Normally, the selling price ranges from Rs 40 to Rs 45 a kilo when you sell on a quintal basis, he said.  Singh was forced to sell his produce because the cost of transportation is too much to handle for small landholding farmers like him.  There have also been several reports of farmers either setting their crops on fire or using it as animal fodder. Government buying is also yet to gather steam. The lockdown has impacted the pace of procurement, driving prices below the MSP (minimum support price) across Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Maharashtra even as costs incurred due to transport and harvesting have increased.  The lack of procurement is worrisome because it determines what India eats in the year to come. Conceptually, grain stocks consist of three components: operational stocks, buffer stocks, and reserve stocks. Operational stocks are the stocks from current year production meant for the consumption in the year following the harvest. Buffer stocks are meant for price stabilisation, and reserve stocks are held for meeting shortage in supply over normal demand arising due to fall in production during an agriculturally bad year.  India is, however, well off in terms of the food grain it has for this year in case a severe shortage arises. Against the requirement of 214 lakh tonnes of wheat and rice at the beginning of the year on January 1, 2020, the Food Corporation of India (FCI) had 565.11 lakh tonnes, which means roughly two-and-a-half times more than the essential requirement for public distribution. With the new wheat arrivals expected from the first week of April, India has certainly nothing to worry about on the foodgrain front.  In addition, India already has a buffer stock of 30 lakh tonnes of sugar, which the government is planning to raise to 40 lakh tonnes this fiscal. In the case of pulses, the Ministry of Food and Consumer Affairs has been trying since December to offload 8.47 lakh tonnes from its buffer stock of pulses.  To understand the seriousness of the demand dearth, consider this: a farmer in Karnataka committed suicide last week after being unable to sell his harvest because of the lockdown. Rambhavan Shukla, another farmer from Jari village in UP, committed suicide by hanging himself from a tree over the non-availability of labour for harvesting his wheat crop.  Just as farmers were dealing with the perils of the coronavirus-induced lockdown at a time when harvesting of the Rabi crop is supposed to be at its peak, untimely rains last week across most parts of north India exponentially increased their fears of a crop failure.  Hailstorms hit fields in Punjab, Haryana and parts of UP exactly when wheat and Rabi crops were starting to be harvested.  Immediately after the sudden announcement of the lockdown, migrant labourers had set off for their homes. While some reached, others are still stuck at various camps set up for their stay. As a result, there is shortage of agricultural labour in villages, which has delayed the harvest at a time when the temperature has already started to soar.  According to the International Labour Organizations estimates, based on the Census 2011 figures, around 24 lakh migrants work in fields across India.  The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) on Sunday said migrant labourers will be allowed to travel for work within the state with certain conditions, but they will not be able to cross borders.  We have permission to harvest during the lockdown, but theres no labour available. My entire family has been manually harvesting the crop since last week,"" said Raju Singh, a wheat farmer in MP.  Added to this is the delay in arrival of combine harvester machines that are responsible for more than 85% of the harvesting activities in the country. On an average, farmers said harvesting takes three days using machines. The same activity is performed in a week when agricultural labourers use their bare hands. In the absence of both now, farmers estimate a delay of close to two weeks.  The lack of machinery and labour has also propped up the problem of storage. As a result, farmers have decided to delay harvesting as much as possible in the absence of any directions from the government on how to manage the produce after it is cultivated.  Several farmers' organisations have requested their respective state governments to ensure the availability of combine harvesters that are stuck in various states. They have also sought adequate space in warehouses to store their produce till they get labourers to take it to the market.  Harvester operators from north India usually go to central and western parts of the country during winter to help farmers cultivate wheat there. During this time, they return to states like Punjab, Haryana and UP to help harvest the rabi crop. Farmers in Haryana said many mechanical harvesters are stuck in Maharashtra, Gujarat, MP and Rajasthan due to the lockdown curbs.  Those farmers who are somehow able to harvest their crops and transport them to markets are being greeted with lack of demand in mandis. With most industrial and restaurant activity coming to a standstill, demand has nosedived, resulting in unprecedented dip in prices, especially of perishable goods.  To understand the impact of the pandemic on markets, consider this: the price per quintal of gram in Maharashtra's Latur has dipped to Rs 3,650 whereas the MSP for the crop is Rs 4,875. Similarly in Rajasthan's Alwar, the market price of mustard currently stands at Rs 3,600 per quintal, almost Rs 1,000 less than its MSP.  In Karnataka, tomato prices crashed by over 50%, from Rs 1,290 a quintal last year to Rs 560 now.  The price of ladies fingers are also down by nearly 40%. In Punjab, green chillies, cucumber, capsicum and cabbage are lying dumped at mandis for lack of buyers.  Farmers across Maharashtra, Punjab and Haryana said there are hardly any buyers in mandis.  ""I have hired carriers by spending double the amount to transport my crops to the mandis but to no use. It has been three days since I found a sizeable buyer,"" said Mahesh Kumar Singh, a farmer in Haryana.",MUSTARD OIL

A look at the monthly summary released by the Department of Consumer Affairs suggests that amid the lockdown, the prices of oil, pulses have gone up while vegetables cost more or less the same with a mild dip in prices.  Data from the ministry show that prices of rice, most varieties of pulses and oils have gone up across the nation.  At the beginning of the lockdown (March 24), pulses costed roughly around at Rs 72 per kilogram but the figures for April 28 show that the price went up to Rs 86, HTs Hindi language publication Live Hindustan reported citing government data.

Similarly, in the case of mustard oil, the price has increased by Rs 20 per kg in Gurugram, Haryana while in Kurnool, Andhra Pradesh it has reached Rs 170 per kg. Prices of vegetable oil have also gone up and so have the price for sugar which has increased by more than two rupees in Delhi.  Prices of vegetables, on the other hand, have fallen.

His trips were meant to be a secret: he would carry food packets and other essential items like soap and masks, and leave them outside the doors of the huts and shanties of poor residents.  These people are mainly wage labourers, who have lost their livelihoods. They still go out during the day with the hope of earning a living. But at night they return home. I dont want to earn fame and want to remain behind the wings. I just want to help these poor people. Third, not all of these people would stand in a queue as some feel ashamed to take help. They would rather go hungry, said Maji.  Maji has been running a coaching centre in Bolpur since 2006; each year, his institute receives almost 250 higher secondary and undergraduate students, who receive tuitions on everything from Bengali language to history and political science. It was this network that Maji turned to, in order to get both supplies and help in distributing them. By the middle of the month, Maji formed a team comprising 10 students, who would help distribute rations.  My students, who are scattered everywhere, helped identify the neediest persons in their respective areas. Help pours in from the students itself. Some are employed, and a few come from well-to-families. All of them donate generously. Many chip in with whatever they can, even packets of puffed rice, Maji said. Till date they have been able to distribute around 250 kilos of rice and 50 litres of cooking oil, he added.  Puffed rice is an important ingredient of a popular Bengali dish called, jhal muri, made with vegetables, spices and mustard oil.  Each packet that Maji and his students left at doorsteps contained two kilos of rice, potatoes, a few vegetables, cooking oil, salt, puffed rice and a soap.  Since the donations are made daily, the distribution team aims to reach at least 10 houses every day. As the police have stopped issuing travel passes, the team tries to arrange for as many two-wheelers as possible, as only one person can ride one vehicle. During the day, they plan out the areas they will cover at night.  Sometimes I see people clicking photos while providing relief to poor people.

(Express Photo) Farmers at the Kishanganj tehsildar office in Baran district after submitting a memorandum requesting an increase in the quantity of wheat and number of tokens issued. (Express Photo)  Three days after returning from the Krishi Upaj Mandi in Rajasthans Sriganganagar city, 48-year-old farmer Gurpreet Singh Sandhu still cant stop rueing his loss  he had to sell most of his mustard produce of 75 quintals at a price much lower than the minimum support price (MSP).  I sustained a loss of Rs 900 on each quintal after selling the mustard at just over Rs 3,500 a quintal at the mandi. Last year, by this time I had sold my produce to the government at MSP of Rs 4,200 a quintal, says Sandhu, a resident of 8NN village under Padampur tehsil of Srigangnagar.  For this years rabi season, the Centre has fixed Rs. 4,425 a quintal as MSP for rapeseed and mustard. However, with the delay in government procurement due to the lockdown, farmers in most areas of Rajasthan are unable to sell their produce at the MSP.  In Rajasthan, the Rajasthan State Co-operative Marketing Federation Ltd (RAJFED) is procuring mustard and gram at the MSP of Rs 4,425 and 4,875 per quintal, respectively, but procurement is now functional only in a few districts in Kota division, leaving farmers from other districts like Sriganganagar with no option but to wait or sell their produce at throwaway prices to private players at mandis.  Government data shows that as of Tuesday, the average price of mustard in four mandis of Sriganganagar-Jaitsar, Padampur, Sadulsahar and Sriganganagar was Rs 3,640, Rs 3,801, Rs 3,711 and Rs 3,765 respectively, much lower than the MSP of Rs 4,425.  Ranvir Singh Chahar, Sriganganagar regional officer, RAJFED, told The Indian Express that procurement of mustard in the district would start from May 1.  I couldnt wait till the government procurement starts. Sowing for the kharif season has already started and I needed money immediately to purchase seeds and pay the labour for sowing cotton in the kharif season. We have no way of recovering our losses, says Sandhu, who had sown mustard on 16 acres.  Sanjay Pathak, general manager, RAJFED, told The Indian Express that this year, in the procurement period of three months, the government has a target of procuring 10.46 lakh metric tonnes of mustard and 6.17 lakh metric tonnes of gram at the MSP. He added that there was a delay of around 15 days in starting the procurement process due to the lockdown.  Data from RAJFED shows that after procurement started in Kota region from April 16, till Tuesday morning, only 3,927.1 metric tonnes of mustard and 4,521.10 metric tonnes of gram have been procured by RAJFED, which is under the state Cooperative Department.  A total of 2,72,795 farmers are registered with RAJFED to sell their produce to the government at MSP. Online registration was stopped after the lockdown was announced. Among those registered, only 7,547 farmers have been allotted dates for purchase of produce.  Officials say that online registration will again begin from May 1. RAJFED has also increased the number of mustard and gram procurement centres from 279  which were sanctioned before the COVID-19 outbreak  to 781 for each of the commodities. The centres have been increased to ensure social distancing.  However, farmers say this delay in procurement has hit them hard, forcing many who are in need of cash to sell their produce at much lower rates.  At Sodhana village in Baran districts Kishanganj tehsil, 58-year-old Mukesh Paliwal is unsure whether he should wait till May 15, the date allotted by him for government procurement of wheat at MSP of Rs 1,925 per quintal by the Food Corporation of India (FCI). Paliwal says he is reluctant to sell 80 quintals of his wheat produce to private players at lower prices.  But Ajay Singh Choudhary, another farmer from Kishanganj tehsil, says that due to his urgent need for cash, he couldnt wait and had to sell his produce at a much lower rate.  I went to Baran to sell wheat to the government at MSP, but after standing in the queue for three days I couldnt get a token. I needed cash urgently for labourers and other expenses, so I had to sell 500 quintals at the Krishi Upaj Mandi Baran. The wheat was sold for Rs 1,743 and Rs 1,661 per quintal  lower than MSP, said Choudhary.  He added that he had to sell 90 quintals of mustard at the mandi for Rs 3,822 per quintal and gram for Rs. 3,780 per quintal, both lower than their MSPs.  FCI general manager (region) Sanjeev Bhasker told The Indian Express that the FCI has a target of procuring 17 lakh metric tonnes of wheat in Rajasthan till June 30. The procurement is not done online but through manual token system, with the process being overseen by each district administration, he said.  According to data from the Commissionerate of Agriculture, Rajasthan, the first advance estimates for the rabi season show that the wheat production in the state this year has been 1,21,85,150 tonnes.  Till Monday we have procured 74,720 metric tonnes of wheat. Of this, 69,658 metric tonnes is from Kota division as procurement started there on April 16 while purchasing in other districts commenced on April 25. We are taking measures to ensure social distancing. A daily quota on the procurement limit of each purchase centre has been fixed for this purpose, said Bhasker.  To maintain social distancing, wheat procurement centres have also been increased, with more than 400 of the now functional in the state, said officials.  The lockdown is also showing its effect in mandis, where the business is low because of less produce being brought.  Each farmer is generally allowed only 2-3 tractor-trolleys of produce as per orders of the district administration. Earlier, one farmer could bring 10 tractor-trolleys. As a result we are sustaining losses, said Deendayal Nagar, a trader at the Krishi Upaj Mandi, Baran.  Farmer leaders say the delay in government procurement has resulted in problems for agriculturists. For 60-70 per cent of farmers, the situation is hand-to-mouth. They wont get any money in hand if their produce remains unsold, so out of desperation they are selling produce at very low prices. If there is delay by the government, farmers have no choice but to sell to private players at low prices, said Ranjit Singh Raju, convener, Gramin Kisan Mazdoor Samiti (GKS), Sriganganagar.  Starting from May 1, procurement of mustard and gram will start in all districts of the state along with new registrations, said RAJFED managing director Sushma Arora.  During his recent video conferences with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot had said that under the Prime Minister Asha Scheme, 25 per cent of the total yields of crops are procured at the MSP, which is inadequate. Farmers should be provided relief in such a tough time by increasing the purchase limit on MSP to 50 per cent. Also, the FCI and NAFED etc. should urgently start the MSP procurement of crops in phased manner, Gehlot had said.",MUSTARD OIL

The procurement process is running smoothly in all the mandis, he added. He said that till yesterday evening, 31 lakh metric tonnes of wheat and 3 lakh metric tonnes of mustard have been procured.  He said that as compared to last year, we have purchased 4.5 lakh metric tonnes of wheat in one day this year. He said that farmers will not face any problem due to unseasonal rains or any other reason.

This comes even as Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar sidestepped questions about a farm sector relief package, saying existing government measures were sufficient.  Also read: Coronavirus lockdown | Allow farmers to harvest crops while maintaining safety: Rahul Gandhi  In a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday, BKU national spokesperson Chaudhary Rakesh Tikait said farmers with perishable produce have been hit especially hard by the lack of transport and labour due to the lockdown.  Coronavirus | Existing schemes providing support to farmers: Tomar  The countrywide lockdown caused lack of transportation that led farmers growing fruits and vegetable crops to let their crops rot in the field. At the same time, fair prices of produce were not available in the markets due to lack of demand. As a result, farmers had no choice but to throw away or destroy their crops, he wrote, noting that there are reports of farmers across India throwing away tomatoes, gourds, cucumber, grapes, oranges and litchis.  He estimated that fruit and vegetable farmers faced 80% crop loss, while many flower farmers lost their entire crop. Though milk is counted as a major essential goods and the government has been making efforts to restore and safeguard the dairy supply chain, dairy farmers have faced 50% losses, he said.  Such extensive losses mean that farmers do not have the funds needed to plant the next kharif or monsoon season crop, said the farmer leader. Farmers are in a dilemma as the government is not taking the necessary steps to solve their problems, he wrote, demanding the package to help compensate for the losses faced by horticulture, floriculture, bee keepers, poultry and dairy farmers and the fisheries sector.  For other crops such as wheat, gram, mustard and cotton, the government should ensure full procurement and provide a bonus of 200/quintal for wheat farmers facing extended bad weather, he said.  The Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi scheme needs to be ramped up to provide 24,000 per year to farm families, with the existing 6,000 sum given immediately as the first instalment, Mr. Tikait told the PM. He also asked for a loan waiver for horticulture and floriculture farmers and a one-year exemption on paying interest on crop loans for all farmers.  Even in the face of this crisis, farmers are working in the field, keeping their life in hands, said the letter.

They can become mushy and stink, prompting people to throw them away. The lockdown, however, seems to have left the world with far more overripe bananas than we bargained for, and the Internet is flooded with recipes for cakes and bread (a fancy name for loaf cake) featuring the fruit.  Google Trends recently listed banana bread as its most searched recipe during the lockdown. But Indian cuisine is replete with ideas that use the plantain from  leaf and flower to stem and fruit  in a variety of ways.  The best way to use overripe bananas is to sun-dry them, says chef Regi Mathew, co-owner and Culinary Director of Kappa Chakka Kandhari, a popular Kerala cuisine restaurant in Chennai and Bengaluru that started with friends, John Paul and Augustine Kurian. In traditional Kerala recipes, we cook the sun-dried bananas and have it with honey and grated coconut. We can also make halwa with dehydrated bananas, he says.  Here are some other ways to use this overripe bananas with elan:  Kolar bora: For this popular Bengali snack, mix the pulp of two overripe bananas with coconut, 250 grams of maida,  teaspoon of baking powder, fennel seeds, a pinch of salt, two tablespoons of powdered sugar and around  cup of water to form a thick batter. Deep fry small balls of the batter on a medium flame until golden brown.

Divide this dough into two equal portions. Heat the pan, tawa and apply some oil on it and spread one portion of the dough into a thick pancake. Cook on slow flame for five-six minutes till it turns brown. Once it is cooked, flip it over and cook the other side for another five-six minutes on a slow flame. You may wish to cover the pancake with a lid. Serve hot with a drizzle of honey.

(File) On the other hand, the Haryana government is in talks with the officers of Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand to send back the migrant workers. (File)  With officials now estimating that as many as 5,000 Haryana residents are stranded abroad, there are hopes that the first flight bringing them home will land at New Delhi airport within a week. Earlier, the number of stranded persons was estimated at 3,700.  A senior officer from the state government, who has spoken to the officials at Union Ministry of External Affairs (MEA), told The Indian Express that the MEA was in process of getting in touch with all the embassies to get more details about those who are stranded in the countries concerned. All flights with Haryana residents will land at the Indira Gandhi International (IGI) Airport, New Delhi. The first flight will probably land within a week. As of now, we dont have exact numbers of the persons stranded in each of the countries but we believe that many from Haryana who are keen to return to the country are currently residing in the USA, the UK and Canada, said the officer. They are stranded in these countries since March this year when India had halted flight operations to curb the coronavirus spread.  On the other hand, the Haryana government is in talks with the officers of Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand to send back the migrant workers. The government says that they will be sent to these states free of cost by special Shramik Trains. Initially, the trains will be sent to Bihar from five stations  Ambala, Hisar, Bhiwani, Rewari and Rohtak of Haryana. As migrant labourers from others states are small in number,their return will be ensured through special trains running from New Delhi.  However, Haryana Additional Chief Secretary (home) Vijai Vardhan has appealed the migrant labourers to stay where they are staying at present and follow social distancing norms. Elaborate arrangements are being made to send them to their home states, he said.  The appeal has been made to avoid chaos that was earlier witnessed at Delhis ISBT and Mumbais Bandra railway station. For this, the authorities will bring the migrant labourers, who have got registered themselves on the Haryana web portal, to the railway stations concerned few hours or a day in advance, said an officer associated with the preparations.  There wont be any online ticket booking for the migrant workers and the officials will send them as per their lists prepared mainly on the basis of registration on government portal. Each train will ferry only 1,200 passengers only. Those from neighbouring areas of other states may also be sent by buses. Inter-state passes can be given to those who can afford private taxies, say the officials.  Hundreds of migrant workers gather at Jind  After getting information that the migrant workers were being sent to their native places, hundreds of workers gathered at a government college in Jind Tuesday. However, most of them were sent back to their local places. Sources said that initially only those will be sent to their native places who were engaged in agriculture and grain market related activities. A large number of agriculture labourers come to Haryana from different states for harvesting of mustard and wheat. As the harvesting of both crops is already over, so these workers are desperate to return to their native places.",MUSTARD OIL

The survey was started around mid-April. Officials said all households in Gurugram district would be covered in the next 15 days. Nearly 1,000 teams comprising six to seven members each are undertaking the survey across villages and urban areas to gather data to ensure better targeting of the relief measures to people affected by the lockdown, imposed to curb the spread of the coronavirus (Covid-19) disease.  Teams have been tasked to list households in their jurisdictions; impoverished households and those in need of assistance are being identified. Besides, requirements of households, people with ration cards and those without them are also being identified. This information will help us to know who genuinely requires financial assistance, dry rations and other essential items, said Kulbir Singh Dhaka, chief executive officer, zila parishad, and the nodal officer for the survey.  This data is being compiled by government officials; officials of the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram and social workers have also been roped in to make this initiative successful. The data will be used to target relief towards those who are in need of assistance due to lockdown, said Dhaka.  Across the state, the Haryana government has been distributing rations free of cost for the month of April, May and June to the needy. Financial assistance is also being given to those who need it. A government spokesperson said that 27 lakh families were given wheat, mustard oil, sugar, salt and pulses worth Rs 154 crore in April and this process will continue in May and June. Below-poverty-line and Antyodaya Anna Yojana families have been given rations at a very cheap rate, he said.  To facilitate the efforts, the government had formed committees at various levels including sectoral, zonal and district committees. These committees have been tasked to ensure that impoverished and underprivileged households are identified and rations, financial assistance and other facilities made available to them.  Amit Khatri, deputy commissioner, Gurugram, said that relief in terms of cooked food, dry rations and other materials is being given to around 2 lakh people every day since the first week of the lockdown.  In Gurugram, the district administration is running 24 relief camps and it has sheltered around 29,000 people, around 60 lakh meals have been provided in collaboration with NGOs and dry ration has been given to people who have registered, a district administration spokesperson said.  Madhu Azad, city mayor, who is involved with the initiative, said that the survey also includes social workers who have been roped in make this a collaborative effort.

The minimum support price for the crop is Rs 4,425 per quintal.  A progressive farmer Arvind Setia, who has sown mustard over nine acres in Toota Wali village, says private players are offering them between Rs 3,300-3,500 per quintal.  This year his farm recorded a yield of around eight quintals an acre and Setia considers it to be a good harvest. However, he blames the state government for poor pricing of mustard.  Setia said while boosting crop diversification, the state government should ensure that farmers get a good deal.  In Rajasthan, mustard is being bought at MSP. However, in Punjab farmers are not being paid fixed rates. I have been growing mustard for the last 25 years but farmers are never offered fair prices. The state government failed to ensure the purchase of the crop by a government agency, said Setia.  In the Malwa belt, Fazilka is the key mustard-growing district.  TIE-UP WITH CENTRE NEEDED  Government officials say since no Central agency is operating in Punjab, farmers have to sell their crop to private players.  Chief agriculture officer Manjit Singh says Fazilka has around 6,000 acres land under cultivation. He said the semi-arid Khuian Sarwar block has the maximum concentration of mustard.  Singh said mustard is harvested by April-end and purchase was underway.  After processing, mustard seed is used to extract mustard oil while cakes are used as cattle feed.  Another farmer, Nikhil Kumar, said following the recommendation of the agriculture experts, he had sown mustard on eight-acres, an increase of five acres, at Patti Billa village near Abohar but ended up selling his produce to private players for Rs 3,400 per quintal.

Farmers are apprehensive the mandis will pass on the 2% cess to them. (Express file) At a mandi in Alwar district. Farmers are apprehensive the mandis will pass on the 2% cess to them. (Express file)  With the Rajasthan government levying a 2 per cent Krishak Kalyan fees on agricultural produce brought or bought or sold in mandis, people associated with agricultural mandis in the state and farmer groups have voiced their opposition to the new cess.  The government has said that the 2 per cent fees collected will be deposited in the Krishak Kalyan Kosh  dedicated to the welfare of farmers in the state. However, farmer outfits are apprehensive that people at agricultural mandis will pass on the burden of the increased cost to farmers, already reeling by the lockdown imposed due to the coronavirus, while traders at mandis have gone on strike.  In a memorandum to the government, the Rajasthan Khadya Vyapar Sangh has said that the Krishi Kalyan fee will result in farmers getting less prices for their agricultural produce, traders incurring losses because of people choosing to sell the produce to black marketers, and agriculture produce from Rajasthan being sold outside the state.  The tax is on raw materials. The prices we farmers are getting for our produce in mandis are already much lower than the minimum support price (MSP). If the traders have to pay the fees, then they will likewise realise the amount from us by reducing the price paid to us for our produce. At this crisis situation in lockdown, this will lead to farmers sustaining losses. In a bid to get more prices, farmers will have to go to neighbouring states such as Punjab to sell their produce now. This will result in losses for the state, said Ranjit Singh Raju, convener, Gramin Kisan Mazdoor Samiti (GKS), Sriganganagar district.  The issue was raised and brought to the notice of Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot by public representatives during a video conferencing session the CM had held with MLAs and MPs on Sunday.  Last year, Gehlot, in the modified state budget, had announced the creation of the Krishak Kalyan Kosh for the purpose of ensuring they get fair price for their produce and to strive towards ease of doing farming.  Accordingly, the government brought in The Rajasthan Agricultural Produce Markets (Amendment) Ordinance, 2020, which was promulgated by the Governor on May 1, amending Section 17 of the Rajasthan Agricultural Produce Market Act, 1961.  The newly-inserted section 17A stated that The market committee shall collect Krishak Kalyan fee from the licensees in the prescribed manner on the agricultural produce brought or bought or sold by them in the market area at such rate as may be specified by the state government, by notification in the official gazette. The fee collected shall be deposited in the Krishak Kalyan Kosh constituted under section 19-A.  Following this, in a gazette notification published on May 5, the state levied the rate of Krishi Kalyan Fees on agricultural produce brought, bought or sold in mandis as Rs 2 on every Rs 100.  According to Babulal Gupta, the chairman of the Rajasthan Khadya Padharth Vyapar Sangh, traders in at least 247 mandis in the state went on strike starting May 6  the day the fees began to be levied  demanding that the government withdraw the decision.  There is already mandi cess of 1.6 per cent on the produce. This 2 per cent fees will increase it to 3.6 per cent, which is much higher than other states. This increased cess will encourage black marketing as many would try to sell their produce outside the mandi mechanism. The government says that fees will not be paid by the farmer or the trader but the consumer. But in this way, if representatives of an oil mill come to procure mustard in open auction, then they will calculate beforehand that there is a 2 per cent fees to be paid and keeping in mind their profit margin, will bid lower accordingly, which will result in low prices, Gupta said.  Farmers have said that due to the strike in the mandis, they are incurring losses, voicing concern that the fee could lead to a decrease in the price they get from the mandis for their produce.  I dont know about farmers welfare in the long run, but once the mandis end the strike, this 2 per cent cess can result in the traders paying us less for our produce. Prices in the mandis are already lower than the MSP and even if we lose Rs 100 per quintal, our losses in one season can well go over Rs 1 lakh, Rajinder Singh, a farmer from Karanpur Tehsil of Sriganganagar district, said.  In response, Agriculture Department joint secretary S P Singh said that after the creation of the Krishi Kalyan Kosh was announced, there was no fixed flow of funds for it, and said the 2 per cent fees levied with serve as a regular source of revenue for it, enabling more spending by the government for farmer welfare.  Recently the government had to take a bank loan of Rs 2,000 crore on account of Krishi Kalyan Kosh, and from it Rs 1,500 crore was paid as state share of insurance premium under the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY), which resulted in farmers receiving insurance claims worth Rs 2,200 in the past 20-25 days even amidst the coronavirus crisis. We need a steady source of revenue for the Krishak Kalyan Kosh as the financial resources are limited and bank loans taken for this purpose also need to be repaid by the government, said Singh.  The government has also insisted that the money collected as Krishi Kalyan fees will be spent on the welfare of farmers.  The fee will be a burden neither on the people associated with the mandis nor the farmers. This charge is meant for the next point of sale, after farmers sell their produce. For the first time, a dedicated fund, the Krishi Kalyan Kosh has been created for the welfare of farmers and this money collected will actually benefit them as it will be spent for their welfare. The entire money will be used on ensuring that the farmers get adequate price and providing them other incentives, Naresh Pal Gangwar, Principal Secretary, Agriculture and Horticulture Department and the Agricultural Production Commissioner told The Indian Express.  Gangwar also pointed out that unlike other states, Rajasthan does not charge development charges on agricultural produce.",MUSTARD OIL

To ensure that the procurement goes on smoothly, officers of Additional Chief Secretary/Principal Secretary level have been appointed as nodal officers for on-the-spot grievance redressal, a statement quoted him as saying.  Besides, all Deputy Commissioners have deputed a procurement officer and an accounting clerk at every mandi and procurement centre for the convenience of the farmers, he added.  Chautala, who also holds the portfolio of Food, Civil Supplies and Consumer Affairs Department, said a cash credit of Rs 22,000 crore has already been arranged to ensure timely release of payment to farmers for wheat crop.  On opposition Congress alleging mismanagement in procurement process, he said that some leaders of the opposition parties are unable to digest the fact that the procurement process is going smoothly despite lockdown and are making statements in the media to mislead the farmers.  Chautala said that as per the information given on Meri Fasal  Mera Byora portal, a farmer can bring as much yield as he wants to sell in the mandis as there is no restriction.  The entire 1,600 quintals of wheat produce of a farmer was purchased in Panipat mandi recently, he said, citing an example, while hitting out at the opposition which has alleged that crop lifting is slow and not entire produce of farmers is being procured.  He said as soon as the wheat procured from the mandis is lifted and sent to the godowns, the payment of both the farmers and the Arthiyas or commision agents is made on the third day of lifting.  Chautala, whose party JJP is a coalition partner of the BJP in the state, said that in view of the COVID-19 pandemic, arrangements have been made for sanitizers, masks, and soaps, among others, in the mandis and social distancing norms are being followed by all.  He said GPS has been installed in all the vehicles engaged in the lifting process of foodgrains. The vehicles which enter the mandi and procurement centres are sanitized first.  He informed that the number of mandis for wheat, which was initially at 389, have been increased to 1,895 after addition of 1,507 new centres, while 112 new procurement centres have been added for mustard.  Similarly, 30 mandis or procurement centres have been established for gram.  He said that wheat is being procured at a minimum support price of Rs 1,925 per quintal, mustard at Rs 4,425 per quintal and gram at Rs 4,875 per quintal.  Additional Chief Secretary, Agriculture and Farmers Welfare Department, Sanjeev Kaushal said that 62.44 lakh metric tonnes (MT) of wheat has been procured from 3,99,432 farmers in the state in the last 19 days.

This is in sharp contrast to the situation in Punjab , where wheat procurement is almost double that of Haryana despite the hurdles being similar.Both Haryana and Punjab had been battling the same set of challenges in the procurement process  shortage of workers , restrictions on transportation and limited entry of farmers to mandis. Though the plan of response was similar, too, Punjab managed to iron out differences much faster than its neighbour.The difference in approach lay in the coordination with middlemen, management of workers and the resultant support from agents, said farmers unions. Its (Haryanas) a clear case of mismanagement and lack of planning. Tussle with commission agents, lifting issues, shortage of labourers and non-payment, among others, have been major failures this season. Also, many of the mandis are not functional, said Rajiv Godra of the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee.Despite a staggered start amid challenges brought in by the lockdown, Punjab was relatively quicker in addressing its issues. With social distancing and other safety protocols in place, Punjab increased the number of procurement centres  around 280 for mustard and close to 1,800 for wheat. This made it easier for farmers to visit the mandis and the footfall, too, was divided evenly. School grounds, stadiums, rice mills and other such public places were converted into procurement centres. Helplines were activated for updates on timing and the location of procurement and token system introduced for farmers.It is only now that the Haryana government has picked up pace in its procurement process. Wheat procurement has been happening under extremely challenging circumstances. We had been preparing for this. First, the meri fasal, mera bora scheme helped us in mapping the farmers in the state. After that, the number of procurement centres was increased four times. Through helpline numbers, our officials ensured the proper arrival of farmers, quick auctioning, lifting and payment to the arhtiyas. Yes, there were some initial challenges but we overcame all of that. Today, we are in a position where 6.6 million metric tonnes of wheat has been procured, Haryana additional chief secretary (agriculture and farmers welfare and cooperation) Sanjeev Kaushal said.Despite these efforts, the procurement exercise left many a farmers and arhtiyas disgruntled in the state. Differences in the approach of the Punjab and Haryana governments were evident from the beginning itself. While Punjab began procurement from April 15, Haryana started it five days later.Only a few days into the exercise, procurement came to a halt in Haryana. From shortage of labourers to repeated strikes by arhtiyas, and from tardy lifting of produce from the mandis to the failure of the government in keeping its promise of a 72-hour payment window, procurement hit several hurdles.The process hit the first roadblock when the government sought to bring in transparency in the minimum support price. The move was strongly opposed by the commission agents, who feared losing control over the farmers. In Punjab, however, the government used the network of the arhtiyas to fix issues of shortage of labourers and ensure farmers arrived at the mandis in a systematic manner.In Haryana, wheat purchase had to be stopped for several days until the government bowed down and went for a compromise with the middlemen. The state government wanted to tweak the system of paying the middlemen first and then the farmers. It, instead, wanted to pay the farmers directly and sought to settle the dues of the middlemen later. The decision triggered a three-day strike by the middlemen and the entire procurement had to be stopped.A sudden spell of rain coupled with staggered lifting of produce from the mandis also hit farmers hard. A portion of the wheat that got drenched in the rain affected the weighing process as moisture content in the grain had increased.Those who had good connections with officials didnt suffer, but marginal farmers had to let go 3-4kg from every 50kg sack. It was mismanagement on the part of the administration, but it is the farmers who had to pay the penalty, said Dharambir Singh of All India Kisan Sabha.Lifting of crop from the mandis is managed by Hafed and Haryana Warehousing Corporation (HWC). They, in turn, have over 450 contractors to take the produce to warehouses. This time, however, the contractors have pleaded helplessness in providing timely services due to the shortage of labourers.Moreover, despite the Haryana governments promise of paying arthiyas and farmers within 72 hours of procurment, only 29% of the payments have been processed so far. The 23,000 registered arhtiyas in the state have raised a demand of Rs 12, 372 crore, but only Rs 3, 709 crore has been made so far to over 12,500 middlemen.PK Das, additional chief secretary (food, civil supplies and consumer affairs), said, We wanted to bring transparency and give greater control to farmer over the price of their produce. Arhtiyas took it the other way round and feared disruption of their networking with farmers. We negotiated with them as transparency cannot be done away with. Also, lifting was an issue due to shortage of workers. But we have fixed that now. About 40-45 lakh tonnes of wheat had been lifted till Wednesday.Asked about the delay in payments, Das said, We have come up with hybrid system to make payments. All payments till April 25 have been cleared. Payments for the produce purchased between April 26 and May 5 is being facilitated and will be completed in couple of days.",MUSTARD OIL

They also demand that morning walks and RWA monitored services like RO, AC etc. be allowed.  As we enter the fourth stage of lockdown , I request the district administration to look into some urgent suggestions from the residents. Besides relaxing the sealing norms, residents should be allowed to go for morning walks in sector parks, wearing masks and maintaining social distancing protocols . Services like electrician, AC/cooler, plumber, RO system, TV, etc should be allowed. RWAs can supervise their entry, said RC Gupta, the RWA general secretary of Sector 19.  Gupta further stated that more focus should be on JJ colonies of sectors 5, 8, 9, 10, 12 etc. where more cases have been reported of late.

He also urged for restarting of construction activities in urban areas so as to help create jobs and curb migrant movement and removal of unnecessary restrictions on NCR borders. The concept of NCR should not be defeated with such restrictions, said Gupta.  Meanwhile, Sector 50 RWA distributed dry ration kits to about 300 poor at the sector's community centre.

In addition to that, we have provided relaxations to farmers for transporting equipment and as well as to irrigate their fields during the night.  Dispelling their concerns of finding markets for their produce, we reopened APMCs across the state in phased manner from April 15, ensuring adequate safety measures in-line with the MHA guidelines. So far, the farmers have sold more than 47 lakh quintals of produce in more than 120 APMCs. The state government has also begun the purchase of wheat, mustard and castor at MSP.  Gujarat has started sending migrants back to their home states. There has been no Covid-19 tests conducted on a mass scale in either the migrant colonies or shelter homes. What risk could this pose to the destination state?  The rescue work during the floods caused by the Machhu dam breach in Morbi in 1979 made me understand what a crisis means for the poor and deprived sections of the society. Today, while we are fighting Covid-19, the experience of 1979 has become a touchstone for me to act with utmost empathy.  This is the prime reason why my government is facilitating the return of lakhs of migrant workers from Gujarat. We strongly believe that they should be with their near and dear ones amid the crisis, which is why we decided to operate Shramik trains in close coordination with the Central Government.  Our district administration and health workers in co-operation with their counterparts in the respective states have been on toes to ensure that the migrants reach their home safely. They undergo health check-up before they leave Gujarat and also when they enter their home states. My government has helped them reach their homes with dignity. We have provided them buses to reach the railway station with all safety protocol as well as food and potable water during the journey.  I am happy to share that Gujarat has operated the maximum number of labour trains in India  476 labour trains for 6.72 lakh migrant workers.  The migrants are the backbone of the states industry. Could the state government not have engaged them in some Covid-19 related jobs, get paid, and stay back with dignity?  As I said, it is not about employment but about ensuring their safety amid crisis.  All tasks associated with Covid-19 require some form of specialisation. Moreover, Gujarat has enough medical staff at its disposal. We have roped in private practitioners too. And very recently, we have decided to reopen all the private hospitals in Ahmedabad.  However, we ensured their safety by putting up labour camps at a cost of Rs 40 crore. My government was successful in providing wages of more than Rs 1,000 crore to labourers during the lockdown.We initiated the Anna Brahma Yojana for providing free foodgrains to all migrant workers and non-ration card holders. We also distributed food packets to those without cooking facilities.  We decided to resume industries and business units from April 20, in accordance with adequate safety protocols. More than 7 lakh workers were employed in more than 45,000 industrial units. At the same time, more than 30,000 labourers are employed at around 700 private construction sites.  Is the state justified in making the migrants pay for their tickets to travel to their home state?  The Gujarat government is not charging for tickets or any other facility provided to the migrant workers during the journey. We do the registration of labourers, provide them buses to be transported to railway station and facilitate their boarding.  In spite of three strictly implemented lockdowns, cases in Gujarat have been seeing a steady rise. Why has Gujarat not been able to flatten the curve?  The battle against Covid-19 is a long drawn process. We must be patient and disciplined for the same. At the same time, we must follow all the necessary safety protocols and learn to live with Covid-19. The crisis is not limited to Gujarat. We must look at it through a holistic and comprehensive approach. The state government has done intensive testing across Gujarat. So far, we have tested more than 1.27 lakh people with a daily capacity of 3,000. I am happy to share that the recovery rate has increased in the past 10 days and reached 40.62% and more than 4,000 people were discharged during the same period. We will witness a flattening curve very soon, not just in Gujarat but in India.  To contain the virus spread in the walled city areas of Ahmedabad, the authorities ramped up testing and police and civic authorities were deployed seeking out Tablighis. Do you think, in the process, those, now called super spreaders, were ignored and the virus spread to other areas?  It is unfortunate that Tablighis not only hid their travel history but they also kept on meeting people in the old city area, which is densely populated, posing a challenge to the society at large. We responded by aggressive surveillance, testing and identification of the infected people, followed by their isolation and treatment. This helped in bringing the situation under control.  Later on, we started large-scale testing of vegetable vendors, and grocery shop owners in Ahmedabad, Surat and Vadodara. More than 18,000 super spreaders were tested in Ahmedabad alone. Around 9,000 more will be tested. This is going to be a continuous and an on-going exercise  Would you blame only the Tablighis for the spike in the cases in Gujarat?  There is no doubt that a large number of cases in Ahmedabad emerged due to Tablighi Jamaat. The data showed that a large of number cases registered in Ahmedabad were directly linked to the Tablighi Jamaat. Statistics show that 80% of the cases in Ahmedabad originated from 20% area of the city. However, another aspect of the rise in number of cases is our increase in the testing capacity. We are focusing on increasing our testing capacity as we aim to identify more and more affected people in a short span of time.  The coronavirus hit many other states in India before it came to Gujarat, giving the state enough time to prepare. Do you think Gujarat was late in reacting?  We took right steps at the right time. The Centre and my government worked in sync to devise ways based on our demography and socio-economic status.  If you look at the statistics of 50 days, you will find that the rate of spread of Covid-19 in India is quite low and the recovery rate is higher compared to other developed nations. I am happy with the pro-active measures adopted by the Central government and my government during the crisis, be it screening of passengers before the first Covid-19 case in Gujarat, setting up of dedicated hospitals within a week, provision of sufficient medicines and equipment like ventilators, masks, sanitisers or testing more people every day we have progressed with effective micro-planning and management at every stage. This is the prime reason why the discharge rate has risen to 40% compared to 18% 10 days ago. We are facing new challenges as time progresses and we are finding the best possible ways to overcome them.  There was a sense of confusion in Gujarat every time the Centre put out guidelines for easing the lockdown. Could the state have done better given the advantage it is the home state of the Prime Minister and Union Home Minister?  During the global pandemic, my administration was prepared well in advance to curtail the spread of infection. We had already announced a state wide lockdown prior to the March 24 nationwide lockdown. The state government ensured to implement the rules and regulations as issued by the MHA. Subsequent measures were adopted for Lockdown 2.0, 3.0 and 4.0 as well.  There is no discrepancy in implementing and enforcing the guidelines as issued by the Central Government. The prime aim of both the Centre and the state governments during the pandemic has been: saving lives and saving livelihoods.  The former was ensured with the implementation of successive lockdowns; the latter was an effort to restore normalcy and bring the economy back on track. We resumed APMCs, industrial units outside municipal limits, and export units within city limits, excepting containment zones, in April. To ensure employment for the poor, we started the third phase of Sujalam Sufalam Jal Abhiyan from April 20, and decided to undertake various works under its umbrella.  Amid all this, we ensured an uninterrupted supply of essential items like food items, milk, vegetables, fruits, masks, sanitisers and medicines for the common people. The model of cooperative federalism has strengthened under the leadership of Modiji. Being the home state of Honourable Prime Minister and Honourable Union Minister, Gujarat has benefitted immensely. Moreover, we keep seeking their guidance from time to time.  Where do you see the states economy by Diwali this year?  We are hopeful that the states entrepreneurial spirit that shaped a vibrant and resilient economy will help bounce back this time as well. I am happy to share that Gujarat is open to investments and trade in a post Covid-19 world. Around 33,000 hectares of land is available for industrial use in Khoraj, Sanand, Dahej SEZ Saykha, Dholera SEZ and other private SEZs. My government has decided to provide Plug and Produce facility through a GIS-based land bank system.  Besides, process approvals for new industries (be it foreign industries or industries from outside Gujarat or MSME units) that wish to establish themselves in Gujarat will be 100 per cent online. They will be allocated land within 7 days and all the necessary permissions shall be provided in 15 days of their application. Gujarats Department of Industries and Mines, in collaboration with the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DIPP), GOI, has envisioned to contact the embassies and industries of foreign nations to establish their units in Gujarat. We have also decided to consult JETRO, KOTRA, USISPF and USIBC to encourage their industries to establish their units in Gujarat.  The new industrial units will be provided with relief from all the related Industrial acts and norms for 1,200 days. However, they will be bound to follow Minimum Wages, Act, Industrial Safety Rules and The Employee Compensation Act.  The state government shall also facilitate in helping the foreign industries to find joint venture partners in the state.  What austerity measures the state government is considering in the wake of substantial cut in its tax-based income?  The Indian economy has been severely hit in the past 50 days of lockdown. Gujarat, being one of the top performing Indian states, has seen a dent in its tax-based income. Of course, these are difficult times.  However, we are doing our best to restore normalcy in the state. Our growth model, is a display of the spirit of austerity of the Gujarati people and it is truly reflected in our budget provisions too.  When the government decided to send back migrant workers from Surat to their homes in Amreli, Bhavnagar and Botad, did it not run a risk given that Amreli, then was Gujarats lone zero district?  We have made it clear that the government will not permit travel from one containment zone to another. Once the application of a worker is approved on the portal, they undergo health screening to determine if they are healthy to travel. There is a health check-up when they return to their native place and they are quarantined at home or institutionally for 14 days.  What is the one message you would give the people in this time of the pandemic?  I would like to thank 6.5 crore Gujaratis for their trust and co-operation during such a crisis. At the same time, I would like to thank all the selfless corona warriors  doctors, nurses, paramedical staff, police personnel, health and sanitation workers and all others who are engaged with the government in curbing the crisis.  We must tread cautiously It is a long drawn battle that demands patience, persistence and perseverance. We must learn to live with Covid-19. At the same time, we should inculcate the use of masks, sanitisers in our everyday life and follow social distancing religiously.",MUSTARD OIL

The 45-year-old artist who has done more than 50 miniature works till date completed his latest piece on the pandemic in just 20 days while in lockdown. The work, which portrays a running man in a mask equipped with a sanitiser and medicine box breaking the Covid-19 chain, has been crafted by Ganesh on the edge of the eye of a sewing needle. According to artist, the chain constructed out of minute gold particles is thinner than a strand of hair. Through the work, I wanted to convey that it is possible to escape from the virus by taking the necessary precautions, he said.  Unlike normal-sized sculptures which are visible to the naked eye, the nano sculptures of Ganesh need to be viewed through a 12x lens in order to gauge all details and appreciate them properly. A goldsmith by profession, Ganesh had ventured into the field of sculpting out of sheer curiosity and interest. The idea of sculpting minute things struck my mind when I saw a bigger object presented in a smaller size in a magazine. I also realised that big things can look more beautiful when they are made in minute proportions, he said.  Having had no previous training as a sculptor, Ganesh faced a lot of difficulties in putting his idea into practice. Even though I was aware of the possibility of making nano sculptures, it took me a lot of time and patience to perfect my art, he said. His first creation was that of a man and a boat which he had done in 2005. It took him almost six months to finish. The motivation and appreciation he received for his work which resembled the size of a mustard seed pushed him to create more such wonders.  Gold is the main medium Ganesh used in developing miniature models of the Taj Mahal and gods such as Lord Ganesha, Vishnu, Krishna and Jesus. His most challenging work so far has been a number lock he made a few years ago. The work also holds a world record for being the smallest functioning gold code lock ever made. It uses a three digit combination like normal locks. I was successful with the functionality only in my second attempt. Any slight variation in the alignment can cause the lock to not function properly, he said. Even if making nano sculptures are less expensive since they require only trace amount of gold, a lot of patience and time goes into making them. Working continuously also causes significant strain to the eyes. During such times, I take a break and practise yoga and meditation as a source of relaxation, Ganesh said.",MUSTARD OIL

The Solvent Extractors Association of India (SEA) also urged the government to ban the import of refined palm oils or palmolien in order to encourage domestic production.  These are some of the short-term measures the trade body has submitted to the government for making India self-sufficient in edible oils.""  ... No nation can afford to compromise its edible oil security to the extent of almost 70 per cent of its annual consumption. This situation calls for corrective actions to be taken up on priority,"" SEA President Atul Chaturvedi said in a statement.  Low import duties on edible oils over the years has practically made our farmers lose interest in oilseed cultivation.  No wonder India's oilseed production has remained stagnant but consumption of edible oils driven by improved affluence has skyrocketed and has been growing at the rate of 3 to 4 per cent per annum, he said, adding that however in the last few years, an attempt has been made to correct this anomaly.  However, the agreements which India had signed with Indonesia and Malaysia way back in 2010 is not allowing India to raise duties.  ""Good news is that the period of the agreements have now come to an end and India is free to raise duties,"" he said.  SEA has suggested the government to increase import duties on soya and sunflower oils to 45 per cent from the current 37.5 per cent, while crude palm oils to 50 per cent. Besides, import of refined palm oil or palmolien should be totally banned. Chaturvedi said, ""We feel the above measures would help raise local oilseed prices which in turn would enthuse our oilseed farmers besides increasing revenue for the government.""  Ban on refined palm oils would help the Indian refining industry in saving jobs in these difficult times.  Needless to say the capacity utilisation of the palm refining industry is currently around 30 per cent and fear of runaway inflation is totally unfounded, he said.  That apart, high oil import duties would also help in better exploitation of non-traditional sources of oils like rice bran, cottonseed and tree borne oilseeds, he added.  SEA also pitched for the launch of an oilseed mission without delay and entry of private companies in this sector.  Among long term measures, SEA has suggested the government to encourage Punjab and Haryana farmers to divert land to corn or sunflower in kharif season and mustard in rabi season.  ""We should target 25 per cent land diversion as it would go a long way in breaking the wheat-rice cycle in these states. Needless to say we keep producing wheat and rice much in excess of our requirement and importing edible oils. This diversion would also help in reducing the destruction of the water table in these states which is the need of the hour,"" the SEA president said.  Adequate arrangements will have to be made for incentivising the farmers and procuring their produce in initial years to give price protection.  Private sector support can be galvanised for this initiative, he said.  To encourage palm cultivation, SEA noted that it is rather unfortunate and beyond comprehension that palm is not treated as a plantation crop in India unlike other parts of the world.  ""Due to this anomalous situation of not treating oil palm as a plantation crop, the private sector cannot invest in palm plantation even though huge opportunity exists in India,"" it said.  As per the government study, India has a potential of 2 million hectares palm cultivation. Against this, the current area under oil palm is only 0.3 million hectares.  ""Huge opportunity exists. Needles to say palm oil yields at around 4 tonne per hectare is the highest among all oilseeds and would go a long way in reducing import dependence,"" SEA said.  The potential of palm oil production in India is almost 8 million tonnes against current production of about 0.25 million tonnes.  There is a need to fix a target of bringing the minimum 1 million hectare area under oil palm in the next four years, it added.  PTI LUX MKJ 05251316 NNNN",MUSTARD OIL

According to the daily flood report of the Assam State Disaster Management Authority (ASDMA), one person was killed at Rongjuli in Goalpara district.  At present, around 2.72 lakh persons are affected due to flood in Dhemaji, Lakhimpur, Nagaon, Hojai, Darrang, Barpeta, Nalbari, Goalpara, West Karbi Anglong, Dibrugarh and Tinsukia districts, it said.  Goalpara is the worst-hit district with 2.15 lakh people affected, followed by Nalbari with over 22,000 people hit and Nagaon with nearly 11,000 persons. Till Tuesday, around 1.95 lakh people were affected in seven districts.  The NDRF and SDRF have rescued nine people in the last 24 hours in Goalpara, while 172.53 quintals of rice, dal, salt and 804.42 litres of mustard oil have been distributed along with tarpaulin and other essential items.

After the lines were cleared, the movement started again at 11:30 am today,"" Northeast Frontier Railway Public Relations Officer Nripen Bhattacharyya said.  Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal on Wednesday directed officials to ensure that all COVID-19 protocols such as social distancing, hand washing and wearing of masks are maintained at the flood relief camps so that community spread of disease can be contained during the season.  The chief minister, reviewing the flood situation in the state with officials of the ASDMA and senior officers of other departments, directed the Deputy Commissioners of all districts to keep soap and water for hand washing, masks for inmates and properly sanitise the flood relief camps.  He also directed the district administrations to ensure that no irregularities take place while distributing relief materials and also release ex gratia payments within 48 hours to the next of kin of those who lose their life in the floods.  He also instructed the Deputy Commissioners to regularly review the relief distribution system so that accountability can be fixed, if any irregularity takes place, and keep an information board in all relief camps showing details of how much relief materials have been received by every individual inmate.  The Centre has released Rs 386 crore as the first installment this year to the State Disaster Relief Fund and the chief minister emphasised on its proper utilisation for providing succour to those affected by the floods.  Sonowal also directed the power department to cut off supply to the transformers submerged in floods so that no accidental electrocution takes place.

Meanwhile, Sonowal called on Governor Jagadish Mukhi and apprised him about the prevailing flood situation in the state.  The chief minister also apprised the governor of the steps taken by the government to deal with the COVID-19 situation, especially in view of the recent surge in the number of positive cases.  They also discussed ways to increase economic activities during the lockdown and strengthen the state's fiscal health.  Sonowal also drew the governor's attention to the torrential rains that have created a flood situation, submerging seven districts of the state, the official said.  He also apprised the governor of several welfare schemes and their implementation for the benefits of all sections of the society.",MUSTARD OIL

(Representational Photo) The farmers say maize seeds given to them under a similar scheme in 2019 had failed to yield any produce. (Representational Photo)  Following stiff opposition by farmers against Haryana governments restrictions on paddy cultivation in some blocks of the state, the authorities were forced to relax the conditions Tuesday. However, Haryana Agriculture and Farmers Welfare Minister JP Dalal believes they will able to convince the farmers to go for crop diversification to ensure water conservation. Dalal tells Sukhbir Siwach why the crop diversification scheme was launched and why the opposition is not happy with it.  Why has the government taken an U-turn on restrictions on paddy cultivation?  There is no U-turn. We had requested the farmers earlier too. An incentive of Rs 7,000 will be given to those farmers who will opt for alternative crops in place of paddy. The farmers are with us. They understand that the water needs to be saved for the future generations. Neither there was any ban (on paddy cultivation) earlier, nor it is now.  Whats the objective behind restrictions on paddy cultivation?  See, we have urged them to sow those crops which require less water. Thats why the scheme has been named as mera pani, meri virasat.  Then why are farmers opposing it?  The farmers are not opposing itthe political men (from opposition) have problems. Earlier, they had questioned wheat procurement, while stating that it wont be completed even in three months. But the procurement was very smooth, which has upset the Opposition. Now, they are trying to find a new issue.  The Opposition says its not the time for such experiments when the country is fighting the coronavirus pandemic?  The farmer himself wants to leave the paddy because of labour crunch as the migrant labourers have returned to their states. We have offered an alternative to the farmers.  The farmers say maize seeds given to them under a similar scheme in 2019 had failed to yield any produce. The farmers say they did not get any compensation too.  Because of model code of conduct, we could not publicise the scheme to the farmers last year. The seeds, which were distributed to the farmers, were not sown. And we could not achieve the target. We had given maize seeds to the farmers for only 2,000 hectare but this time instead of seeds we will given an incentive of Rs 7,000 per acre. The farmers can choose high quality seeds as per their wishes. They are free to choose any alternative crop like vegetables, pulses, cotton or horticulture. We will offer 85 per cent subsidy to them if they opt for drip irrigation. Other facilities will also be given if they opt for horticulture.  Do you believe that you will able to convince the farmers for crop diversification?  Surely. The opposition had launched a misinformation campaign even against the crop insurance scheme to incite the farmers. But now the farmers are happy with the insurance scheme. The opponents want to politicise this issue too while keeping the farmers on front. But the farmers are happy with the policies of the government. In just four days, farmers have registered themselves for the crop diversification scheme to shift to alternative crops from paddy in over 25,000 acres.  The late payment to farmers in lieu of procurement of wheat and mustard has also been a big issue this time. What do you say?  A delay of 4-5 days in the payment took place this time because the arhtiyas were not familiar with the new system of payment. We have already made a payment of Rs 2,000 crore in lieu of procurement of mustard and over Rs 9,000 crore for the wheat. The Chief Minister has announced Tuesday that all payments will be done by May 31. I bow down to the farmers who have filled the godowns with food grains this time despite the lockdown. The entire country is grateful to them.  How do you plan to check locust swarm invasion in Haryana?  No doubt, we are scared as the locust swarm has already entered areas in bordering state Rajasthan. But we are fully prepared. If locusts invade Haryana, we will make sure they dont remain alive. We have already arranged medicines to deal with the problem.  How can the destiny of farmer be changed?  I am from a farmer family. The farmers need loans on low rate interest. The farmers will be safe with the farm loans at the rate of 4 per cent. With the introduction of crop insurance scheme, we have freed them from the risks in agriculture sector. With the removal of mandi Act, the farmers can sell their crops to anyone, anywhere.",MUSTARD OIL

In the run-up to 2018 assembly elections, the Congress party had promised to waive loan of farmers up to Rs 2 lakh per head. The then Congress president Rahul Gandhi had backed that commitment by claiming that if Congress failed in keeping its promise within the first 10 days of coming to power, the chief minister would lose his post.  After coming to power, the Congress launched Jai kisan fasal rin maafi yojna to implement loan-waiver promise for about 5 million farmers to the tune of approximately Rs 55,000 crore. It added a rider that the loan waiver scheme will be implemented in phases with farmers having loans up to Rs 50,000 per head to be covered in the first phase and no waiver of loans for income tax payee farmers.  The then government claimed to have waived off loans of 2 million farmers, worth approximately Rs 7,000 crore, in the first phase until March, 2019. The then chief minister Kamal Nath announced that about 1.2 million farmers would benefit from loan waiver of Rs 11,675 crore in the second phase that began as late as in December 2019.  In an interview, Kamal Patel likened the Congress promises to that of a leader from his district, Harda, who used to contest assembly elections as an independent candidate with lofty promises to bring back Indias looted gold and silver from England, making temples of gold and peoples houses with silver and of making air travel so convenient that people could land helicopters in their fields to curb road accidents.  For Coronavirus Live Updates  Congress knew it was not going to win the elections. It had won 58 seats in 2013 assembly elections and feared that due to Prime Minister Narendra Modis welfare initiative, it might not win even 20 seats; hence they decided to tell lies only. The Congress Vachan patra (election manifesto) was full of promises to such an extent that even God would not have been able to fulfill it had he got down to Earth, said the minister.  Kamal Patel said, The Congress tried to lure every section of the society. Farmers were promised Rs 2 lakh per head loan waiver that meant the waiver amount will multiply several times depending upon loan takers in a family. They promised Rs 4,000 per month to unemployed youths, Rs 1,000 pension to the physically challenged, regularisation of services to daily wagers and guest faculty in degree colleges and many other promises. Was this not fraud and deceit? Thats why I asked farmers to go and lodge FIR against the Congress leaders for committing fraud on them with a criminal conspiracy.  The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19  The minister said the BJP government was working on making farmers self-reliant so that they wouldnt need loans.  In just two months, the BJP government headed by chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan had taken several decisions to increase income of farmers and make them self-reliant. The bar on the maximum amount of weighing of the agriculture produce at mandis had been done away with. This would save farmers diesel and time worth crores of rupees. Similarly, raising the limit of procurement for gram, lentil and mustard from 15 quintal to 20 quintal per hectare has resulted in additional income of Rs 762 crore to the farmers.  Hitting back, the then agriculture minister Sachin Yadav said Congress loan waiver scheme was a response to farmers suicide during BJPs 15-year rule in the state. He claimed the Congress government was going to launch the third phase of loan waivers from June 1 before it got toppled.  I challenge chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan and agriculture minister Kamal Patel to tour the state with me to know the reality. The fact is, during the BJPs regime of 15 years, Madhya Pradesh had earned a bad name as a state with highest number of farmers suicide cases due to wrong policies of the BJP. We waived loans worth Rs 11,500 crore of 2.66 million farmers in the first and the second phase and we were going to launch the third phase from June 1.  He added, People are highly upset with the BJP government and will give a befitting reply to it in the ensuing bypolls in the state.  The state Congress spokesperson Abhay Dubey echoed the sentiment.  We had handed over a list of 21 lakh farmers to Shivraj Singh Chouhan ji at his bungalow when he was in the Opposition. There was no statement from him on this. But no one can help if BJP has decided to only tell lies. Congress will be back in power after the bypolls for 24 assembly seats and will not only waive the remaining farmers loans but also transfer some monthly amount in the bank accounts of migrant labourers, he claimed.",MUSTARD OIL

An inquiry has been initiated into the matter and we have suspended four market committee officials, confirmed additional chief secretary, agriculture and farmers welfare department, Sanjeev Kaushal on Friday.  Mustard growers have, meanwhile, expressed their worries and said they havent been able to sell their produce for past more than a week.  Procurement at many centres was stopped after the government received complaints regarding illegal activities involving some commission agents, farmers and market committee officials.  They were allegedly selling the mustard bought from Rajasthan in the name of local farmers at the MSP of Rs 4,425 per quintal in state mandis. Additional chief secretary Kaushal said, Some commission agents purchased the mustard from Rajasthan at rates Rs 600-700 lower than prescribed and sold the same in Haryana mandis with the help of certain farmers and market committee officials.  We are registering FIRs against those involved in the scam. Most of the farmers have already sold their produce and the crop of remaining ones will be purchased after proper verification, Kaushal added.  WAITING FOR MY TURN FOR PAST 8 DAYS  The government has been procuring mustard (40 quintals from a farmer in one go) across 165 centres in the state.  Sumod Kumar, a farmer from Bhiwanis Surpura Khurd village, said the government had stopped purchasing their crop on May 20. Many farmers from my village have sold their crop and few of them even received payment. But, I have been waiting for my turn for the past eight days. When I contacted commission agents and market committee officials, they told me that they will resume the process after getting a green signal from the government, he said.  Mandi officials had issued tokens to farmers at Behal Mandi on May 20 and since then, many of them are waiting for resumption of procurement, he added.  However, since the procurement process was stopped across mandis, the private dealers have been reportedly buying mustard at  4,100 to 4,180 per quintal.  Raj Bala, a farmer from Dadris Atela village, said she was worried as the government has not been procuring their produce for the past five days.  The commission agent had told me last week that my turn to sell mustard will come up by May 25. When I called him again, he told me that the mandi officials were not issuing tokens and the procurement process was put on hold. He assured me that Id be informed if the government reopens mandis this week, the farmer added.  Dadri market committee secretary Suresh Khokar said the government had issued orders to stop the mustard purchase to ensure lifting of pending crop procured from commission agents and store the same at government godowns.",MUSTARD OIL

At present, over 3.72 lakh persons are suffering due to flood in Nalbari, Goalpara, Nagaon, Hojai, West Karbi Anglong and Tinsukia, it said.  Goalpara is the worst hit with 1.59 lakh people suffering, followed by Nagaon with over 1.07 lakh people and Hojai with nearly 94,500 people.

The Kopili river at Kampur and at Dharamtul is flowing above the danger mark.  Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal on Saturday visited Nalbari district and took stock of the erosion mitigation work being undertaken near an embankment along the Brahmaputra at Doulasal-Larkuchi in Borkhetri constituency.  He directed the Water Resources Department to complete the mitigation and repairing work on a war footing.  Talking to reporters, Sonowal said when the state is reeling under flood, construction of new embankment is not feasible and, therefore, the government has taken swift action to repair any breach on the embankments caused by the flood.  Sonowal further said that though floating of tenders, giving work orders and construction work began well ahead, the COVID-19 pandemic and its resultant lockdown caused the delay in completing the construction and repair work.  At present, 348 villages are under water and 26,977 hectares of crop areas have been damaged, ASDMA said.  It said authorities are running 195 relief camps and distribution centres in four districts, where 17,770 people are taking shelter currently.  Embankments, roads, bridges, culverts and many other infrastructures have been damaged at various places in Kamrup, Goalpara, Hojai, Nagaon, Barpeta, Sonitpur and Udalguri districts.  Massive erosions have been witnessed at various places of Biswanath, Sonitpur, Dibrugarh and Majuli districts, ASDMA said.

Having grown up on a healthy diet of Westerns, the name appealed to me, instantly conjuring up an image of a swinging door and the sound of distant neighing. I looked at the menu, and it sounded good too. So I put on my Stetson, and placed an order.  Wild Wild West, I learnt, has three branches in Delhi. Now, of course, the restaurants are shut, but its food is being delivered through Swiggy and Zomato. The delivery menu includes pizzas, pastas, calzones, salads, and sandwiches. The main courses have dishes such as grilled vegetables with basil pesto sauce and smoked chicken fillets.  Grilled chicken Photo: Special Arrangement  We asked for a Meaty Submarine (350), with iceberg, onions, black olives and sundried tomatoes, chicken sausages, pork pepperoni and bacon bits, served with chipotle and mustard sauce; Grilled Chicken Breast in Cosmic Mushroom Sauce, with Grilled Vegetables (440), chicken peri peri with sauted mushroom and herbed rice (400) and Spinach and Sundried Tomato Pasta (390).  My order was the submarine, for I have a long and happy relationship with this dish. I remember the juicy submarines I had at Cellars (which later turned into a place called The Parlour) in CP. This is essentially a bigger and thicker hotdog, with various kinds of fillings.  The chilli-lover at home enjoyed the peri peri chicken, which came submerged in a red sauce. I had a spoonful of the sauce, and found that while it was spicy, it was still not as hot as I would have liked it to be.  We had imagined something else when we ordered the grilled chicken, too. Id thought the sauce would be on the side, but it came dunked in the mushroom gravy, which was just a bit too rich and creamy.  My submarine was excellent, though. It was well packed, and stuffed with enough meat to be called a meaty submarine. I enjoyed the crunchy iceberg and the tart sundried tomatoes, flavours and textures that went well with the meats. I liked the pasta, too (even though it was a bit too cheesy) and savoured the pine nuts that it had been garnished with.  Wild Wild West doffs its hat to the Indian palate. So in the pizza segment, while it has something called an Expatriate Pizza (with marinara sauce, mozzarella, baby corn, black olives, sundried tomatoes and jalapenos) and Sausage Fest Pizza, it also has Paneer Makhni Pizza and Butter Chicken Pizza. The menu includes a Butter Chicken Calzone and a Paneer Tikkalicious Salad.  I didnt venture anywhere there, of course. We were in search of what is known (in some circles) as Conti food. Overall, I think we had quite a nice meal, which we ended with some desi home-made suji halwa (cooked in just a wee bit of oil and stevia).  And then, after my dinner, I pulled out an old, dog-eared Louise L'Amour. I fell asleep to the sound of distant gunshots and racing hooves.  The writer is a seasoned food critic",MUSTARD OIL

This summer, why dont you invite the hardy gooseberry to your table?  Shall I send you some nellikai? The question triggers memories of my paatis home in Mysuru. Hot June, vacation time, and as the rest of the house slumbers, my playmate Uma and I head to the gooseberry tree with low-hung branches where we pick the light green berries, pretend they are vegetables and cook with them using our Chennapatna toy kitchen set.  We giggle as we watch each others faces pucker at the tartness, but that does not deter us. Older cousins have taught us well and we quickly chase the gooseberry down with a tumbler of water. We marvel at the sweet taste in our mouth and go aaaaah.  For the sake of nostalgia alone, I buy the nellikai (called amla in the North). After deliberation with my mother (who suggests sweet morabba) we finally decide to make it into thokku  a healthier and the less ambitious choice. This, of course, is followed by nellikai talk with several friends on WhatsApp.  In the know  Latha Anantharaman harvests nellikai from her farm near Palakkad, and bottles them in brine. On hot days, she dashes into her garden, picks leaves from the ajwain plant, plucks Kandhari chillies and grinds them all with coconut and the homegrown gooseberry. She adds curd to it for a refreshing, healthy raita.  Murabba Ingredients  15 big gooseberries  2 cups sugar  2 cups water  A big pinch of salt  1 stick of cinnamon (broken into 2 or 3 pieces)  4 to 5 cloves  2 dry red chillies  2 tsp oil  Method  Wash and boil the berries in water for about five minutes and drain well. Either cut the berries into segments and discard the seeds, or just score each berry, leaving the seed in. This is to ensure the sugar is absorbed well. Heat oil, add the dried red chillies, cinnamon and cloves. Fry for a few seconds. Add sugar and water. Bring to boil on a slow flame. When the sugar has dissolved completely, add the gooseberry. Continue cooking on a slow flame for 20 minutes to half an hour, till the syrup thickens and is reduced to 2/3 of its original quantity. Add the salt. Remove from heat and cool. The syrup thickens further on cooling. Store in dry, clean bottles with tight lids.  Her family recipes of pickles and even supari made of gooseberry have sheltered them from the demonic summer loo winds of summer, Smita Shakargaye from Bhopal is convinced. Smita, who makes her own papads and pickles, says one of her favourites is wedges of berry spiced with black salt, cumin, pepper and sugar and sundried into a digestive supari. Bengaluru-based Usha Girish shares a morabba recipe (box).  Sreedevi Lakshmi Kutty in Coimbatore, sends me organic gooseberries sourced from her farmer friend Manju Ilango, who grows them in a 30-acre organic farm at Thalavadi in Erode district. I wish more people would consider making jams, pickles, juices and powders with them, she says, Our kids should be as familiar with nellikai as they are with oranges or apples.  The drought-resistant gooseberry is one produce that ticks all the boxes of being local, therefore sustainable, and of course great for boosting immunity, says Dr Abhilash Anand of Maitreyi Vedic Village at Aliyar on the Tamil Nadu-Kerala border. He is the managing director and chief Ayurveda physician there.  Thokku Ingredients  500 gm gooseberry  1 tsp fenugreek seeds  2 tsp mustard seeds (one tsp for tempering and the other for roasting and grinding)  1 tsp turmeric powder  1/2 tsp asafoetida  5 tbsp oil (sesame oil preferably)  Chilli powder to taste  Salt to taste  Method  Put amla in a vessel with no water. Place the vessel in the cooker. After two whistles, turn the cooker off and cool. De-seed the gooseberry and coarsely mash/pulse in the mixie. Make sure it is not too smooth and a few chunky pieces are desirable. Roast the fenugreek and mustard seeds, then cool and powder. Heat oil and temper with mustard, asafoetida, and curry leaves. Once the mustard splutters, add turmeric, chilli powder to taste and salt (add a little more than you usually would). Mix well and add the coarsely mashed gooseberry. Cook on a medium flame. Adjust salt and chilli powder if you wish. After about 10-15 minutes, the oil starts separating. Add the mustard methi powder and mix well. Cook for a further couple of minutes. Make sure the mixture does not burn. Switch off the gas and allow the mixture to cool. Put into a glass bottle with a tight lid and enjoy. PS: If the gooseberry is too sour, add some jaggery to it.  There are endless benefits, if used wisely. In Ayurveda it is used to restore balance in the body, boost metabolism and rejuvenate organs. It de-toxes. he says. The gooseberry can be a part of ones daily diet, but in moderation, he cautions. In rare cases, it may lead to acidity.  According to gerontologist Dr Rahul Padmanabhan, Vitamin C does complement the immunity mechanism in our bodies. It helps prevent and fight infections.  The season for gooseberry is from April to August and some of the best berries are harvested now, in May and June, says Manju. She is sad that she has not been able to visit her farm this year. Our manager there says the harvest is bountiful and the boughs of the trees are sagging with the weight of the fruits. In the good years we have harvested thousands of kilograms.  Ironically, says Manju, there are few takers for something that grows so profusely here. We should use the nellikai a lot more instead of chasing expensive supplements and unseasonal and exotic alternatives. We should be bottling it and pickling it. Whatever we do with our mangoes, can be done with gooseberry.",MUSTARD OIL

Meanwhile, Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar claimed that they have made most of the payment to the arhtiyas (commission agents) to transfer the same in the bank accounts of the farmers.  Chautala, the MLA from Ellenabad constituency of Sirsa district, alleged that till now the government has procured 75 lakh metric tonne wheat from the farmers. Out of the total payment of about Rs 16,000 crore against the procurement, the farmers have received only Rs 1,600 crore, claimed Chautala.  The wheat procurement in Haryana had begun on April 20 this year, though it started taking place effectively from April 23 as many of the arhtiyas had remained on strike for first three days. The government claims payment to the farmers within 72 hours but more that 60 per cent of the farmers have been forced to visit the offices of government procurement agencies or arhtiyas seeking release of their payments. Instead of any bonus to the farmers, the government is even delaying the payment of their crops, said the INLD leader.  On the other hand, Khattar said that if arhtiyas delay the payment, then they will have to give the amount to the farmers along with interest. Except for Rs 600 crore or Rs 700 crore, the entire payment has been made to the arhtiyas. Initially, the payment was released with a delay of 8-10 days because of new system of payment to the farmers, said Khattar.  The chief minister said that they were trying to introduce a system to make the payment directly into the accounts of farmers for the past three years but the arhtiyas urged every year to defer it. Finally, this time, a new system was introduced under which the payment to the farmers was made to their bank accounts through arhtiyas but under the monitoring of government. Some arhtiyas created hurdles, but most of them supported the new system, said Khattar.  The procurement of mustard had began little early than wheat in Haryana mandis. However, according to Chautala, the farmers are yet to receive payment of Rs 700 crore in lieu of the mustard procurement. The former Leader of Opposition announced a big dharna on June 9 if the government fails to make payment of farmers by then.",MUSTARD OIL

Speaking at a press conference organised by a local Congress leader Ashok Arora at a hotel here, Hooda said the opposition had extended full support to the government in the fight against Covid-19, but they were forced to raise their voice after it took a series of anti-farmer decisions.  Hooda said the government withdrew its decision of paddy ban after a sustained campaign by farmers and opposition parties. Though the government has been forced to let go the elephant, it is still holding on to its tail by restricting paddy cultivation on panchayati land.  The government should withdraw the ban on paddy cultivation on panchayati land in times of pandemic. Instead of imposing restrictions on farmers and panchayats, the government should resume a project like Dadupur-Nalvi to conserve groundwater, Hooda said.  On payments due to the farmers, he said the government should clear the pending payments of wheat and sugarcane immediately and compensation should also be paid for losses suffered due to hailstorms and unseasonal rains.  Talking about the alleged scams in liquor and the purchase of mustard and gram in the state, Hooda said, Far from an impartial probe in the liquor scam, the government has not yet been able to decide whether the investigation will be done by SIT or SET. The government itself does not listen to its minister Anil Vij. He (Vij) is our old friendbut I want to ask him why he speaks if his own government doesnt listen to him?  The government has increased the liquor rate by Rs 10 to Rs 50 per bottle, but the contractors are overcharging Rs 200-400 per bottle, the former CM said and added that liquor shops have not put up a rate list and there is no billing and no investigation.  Expressing concern over the increasing unemployment in the state, Hooda said the government is retrenching employees even during the pandemic when families are struggling to make both ends meet.  Indicating that unemployment in Haryana has consistently been over 10% higher than the national average, Hooda said, The youths are not getting jobs and waiting for recruitments. Efforts are being made to cancel 9 categories of recruitments including TGT English. PGT Sanskrit candidates are not being given a joining date. No relief has been given to small and medium-scale industries to ensure that they are able to provide some support to their employees. This is the reason that the unemployment rate in the state has reached 43% today.  Hooda alleged the government did take a firm stand in the court for the 1,983 PTI admitted during the Congress government, which is why the court has decided to remove them. The government should use its legislative powers to protect their employment. The job of government is to provide employment to the youth, not to take away their jobs.  He cited that during the Congress government, the court had ordered the removal of thousands of guest teachers from the job, but the government used its legislative powers to protect their employment. Similarly, 4,000 MITC employees fired during the INLD government were also reappointed, he said.  Hooda also expressed concern over the rising number of Covid-19 cases in the state. The government should pay attention to complaints of Covid-19 patients not being looked after properly at many places.",MUSTARD OIL

The farmers said despite listing the mandis, the officials have not started the procurement in concerned areas, which is a matter of concern.  BKU Haryana president Gurnam Singh Charuni said, ""The farmers cannot store wet sunflower for long, and due to uncertain weather, it cannot be stored in open. Due to delays, the farmers are storing crops at their own facilities. As of now, they are taking the crop to mandi to get it cleaned and dried and again bringing it back to their facilities. This is adding a cost of labour. The procurement should start at the earliest.""  ""Registration of around 1,000 farmers in Shahabad area is pending on MFMB portal, and so far, around 2,800 have registered. The portal was closed before time by the government, while there was a lot of crop sowing pending in the fields of farmers. A large number of farmers in the state sow sunflower after harvesting mustard. Thus, the farmers who cultivated mustard were not able to register for sunflower till their crop was not procured, and a lot of farmers missed from registering on the MFMB portal. Our union has already written to the government, but it has not opened the registration portal for the remaining farmers. We request the opening of MFMB portal for sunflower and maize farmers at the earliest, further said Charuni.

When a farmer from Khariya village suspected that the weighing machine is showing less weight than the actual, he raised the alarm and soon the farmers gathered. When the bags were weighed on another machine, it was found to be 55.6kg per bag instead of 50.6 kg (as shown on agents weighing machine). We want that the government should ensure proper procurement of gram, Singh added.  The Haryana government is procuring grams at 4,875 at minimum support price (MSP) per quintal.  Ram Kumar, a commission agent alleged that only two commission agents were allotted in Hisar mandi for gram procurement with an aim to dupe farmers.  Both the agents have been demanding 400 per quintal from farmers on the name of poor variety of yield while procuring their crop. Both of them had duped many farmers by manipulating an electronic weighing machine which was fixed to show less weight than the actual.

The commission agents, who were facing allegations of duping farmers refused to comment on the matter.  Market committee chairman Mahavir Jangra said that the farmers were cheated by the commission agents with the consent of HAFED officials.

Initially, the state had decided to procure the crop from May 20 to June 30. However, the state authorities decided against wheat procurement after June 6 after observing the poor response of farmers in mandis. The political leaders and ministers in the state had earlier announced that there will be no deadline for procurement this year and the process would continue till the last grain in the state is procured.  The state food, civil supplies and consumer affairs department has sent a communication to the chief administrator, Haryana State Agriculture Marketing Board (HSAMB), asking him to convey the message to all secretaries of market committees in Haryana regarding stopping of wheat procurement from June 6. According to the instructions, only those farmers who have registered on the government portal would get a chance to bring their crop in the mandis till June 6.  Government officials say the inflow of wheat in mandis has come down and only around 10-15 thousand metric tonne (MT) wheat every day is being received in mandis in the past one week. Earlier, more than one lakh metric tonne wheat used to be procured every day in the state.  Meanwhile, sources have confirmed that the state has procured around 75 lakh MT wheat till now as against the 93 lakh MT previous year. Similarly, around 8 lakh MT mustard has also been procured as against around 6.9 lakh MT in 2019. Haryana is one of the largest producers of mustard and wheat in the country.  On account of the lockdown due to Covid-19 pandemic, the state government had delayed/staggered the procurement of rabi crops this year. The procurement of mustard was started on April 15 and wheat from April 20.  When asked about the poor wheat procurement this season, one of the senior most bureaucrats of the state said that earlier farmers from neighbouring states used to come and sell their crops in Haryana but this time due to restrictions on account of lockdown, they could not enter the state.  Another reason of comparatively low procurement is that several large farmers or those who have storage capacity have stocked their crop, he added. Because of staggered procurement, the farmers had to take their crop to their residences for storage instead of taking it directly from fields to procurement centres.",MUSTARD OIL

Hooda said, Government had assured farmers that the purchase shall be carried out till June 30. Farmers of the state need to be given more time to sell their crops in line with the earlier schedule announced by the government.  I urge the government to show a sense of urgency in lifting crops from market yards and making payments to the farmers, instead of closing the purchase process three weeks ahead of schedule. As of now payments for 75,000 metric tonnes of mustard and Rs 2,200 crore for wheat have not been made. Besides, about 17 lakh metric tonnes of wheat has not been lifted from the markets, Hooda said.  Details of a scam in the purchase of mustard are now in public domain and it shows that a large amount of purchase has been made only on paper while the actual farmer is still waiting for his crop to be sold. The government should ensure that purchases are not made on paper and that every single grain of the farmer is purchased, Hooda said.  Farmers were forced to incur a loss of up to 5 kg per bag, based on reports from the Hisar market, which had meant a direct loss of Rs 250 per bag to the farmer. Farmer is already facing financial losses due to crop damage. The scam, combined with government apathy, has brought farmers to the brink of financial ruin. Government should take cognisance of the scam, take strict action against the accused and compensate the farmers for their losses, Hooda said.  Talking about the MSP declared by the Union government, the former CM said, Farmers were deeply disappointed as they were expecting a reasonable increase in the minimum support price of kharif crops. The government has increased the MSP of paddy by just 53 paise per kg which is an increase of only 2.9%. The increase in rates of manure, seeds, irrigation, fuel, labour, harvesting, transportation and inflation is many times more. At the rate fixed by the government, the farmer would not be able to recover basic costs. The responsibility now lies with the state government which should declare appropriate bonuses for the farmers.  Objecting to the governments decision of imposing paddy ban in the state, Hooda said, State government continues to be adamant on banning paddy cultivation in parts of the state despite protests from farmers and opposition parties.

174,174.0,,,2020-06-08,https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/faced-with-acute-labour-shortage-industry-owners-woo-migrants-with-better-wages-sops/story-Of80ZxC8lgbFgksIC5bjXJ.html,"Industries in Gurugram and Manesar, which are struggling due to a shortage of labourers, are trying hard to reach out to migrant workers to facilitate their early return. At least 60-70% of the workers have returned to their home towns due to the fear of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic.  Their absence is forcing some garment exporters to pay higher daily wages to skilled craftsmen, while some others are making calls to their contractors in the villages, promising them better wages and free travel, among other concessions. The real estate developers, who are stuck with ongoing projects, are even ready to pay money in advance, rail tickets, but are still finding it hard to reverse the flow. The market rate for agricultural wages has also gone up due to a shortage of workers, say landowners. The automobile sector, however, is in a comparatively better situation, say vendors. This is because the demand for production is less and the sector has seen relatively fewer migrants return to their home towns.  Around 6 to 7 lakh migrant workers in Gurugram, who worked in different sectors, have left the district since the start of the year when the coronavirus pandemic started to make an impact, say local trade union leaders. Due to the large scale migration, the factories in Udyog Vihar, which have resumed operations, are finding it difficult to resume full-scale production. They are being forced to hire labour locally at higher wages or contacting those who have gone home to return as early as possible.  The paucity of labour is such that in most of the 1,900 industrial units that have resumed operations are functioning at 40 to 50% of their full capacity, said the Gurugram district administration officials on Monday. The units which have more than 1,000 workers are mostly operational but the major impact is on export-oriented units where 100 to 200 workers are employed. As of now, only 50% of these units have become operational, said the labour department officials. As on Monday, only 1.10 lakh labourers have returned to work in the automobile, garment manufacturing and exports, and other industries across the state, they added.  Garment industry  Satyender Singh, general manager, East-West Exports, a garment export unit based in Udyog Vihar, says that the majority of units are working with 30% of the staff as workers are not available. Large companies, which have the financial muscle, are now hiring workers on a daily basis and paying them higher than the normal wages. In normal times, 360 to 400 was paid to a tailor. Now the market rate is 400 to 450 and money is being paid daily, he said, adding that in such a scenario, workers are leaving smaller firms and opting to work as daily wagers for larger firms as the money is paid daily in the evening.  As per the garment exporters, a large number of companies have either prior orders or have received new orders from Europe that have to be fulfilled on a priority basis. The season in Europe is around August and September and if we dont work now these orders will get wasted. We are, therefore, contacting our workers to return to work as early as possible. The industry owners are ready to pay for tickets, advance cash and provide for other facilities, said Manmohan Gaind, vice president, Manesar Industries Welfare Association.  Across the National Capital Region(NCR), the labour situation is precarious says Dr Manipadma Datta, vice-chancellor, TERI School of Advanced Studies and the head of the department of business sustainability. The NCR is staring at a major manpower crisis, which will impact the business in the long run. All stakeholders need to win back the confidence of workers, who need empathy, support and help. They will not return soon and it would be difficult to fill the shop floors, he said.  Real estate  The situation in the real estate sector, which is one of the largest employers and revenue generators in Gurugram, is equally dire as only 21,000 workers, out of an average of 2.5 to 3 lakh workers, are reported to have returned to work on 96 active construction sites, the district administration said.  Real estate developers say that at any given time 2.5 to 3 lakh workers are engaged in construction activities and migration has had a major dampening impact on the trade. We are trying to contact workers through labour contractors, calling them directly and have offered them various concessions. However, only a few of them have responded positively, said Praveen Jain, vice chairman, National Real Estate Development Council(Nardeco), Haryana, adding that extension of project deadlines by six months needs to be further pushed back by six months.  Another developer, who wished not to be named, said that they have approached labour contractors with offers of free rail tickets, air tickets and higher wages but the contractors say that the workers re reluctant to return. There is fear among the workers as the situation is still fluid and there is no clarity as to how long will the pandemic continue, he said.  Rajender Saroha, joint secretary, Bhawan Nirman Kamgaar Union, who has been actively engaged with workers, says that workforce in the construction sector is feeling abandoned as not many real estate developers took care of them during the lockdown. Workers are economically and emotionally hurt and will not return soon, he said.  Automobile  As compared to garment and realty sectors, the automobile sector is faring relatively better, says Ashok Kohli, president, Chamber of Industries, Udyog Vihar. The auto companies are larger in size and more organised so these were able to retain workers and the demand for labour in this sector is also less as production targets are lower, he said.  In the automobile segment, the labour department said that around 40% labour has returned to work and the situation is likely to improve in the coming days as demand for cars, motorcycles and other such products improves.  A vendor, who works for a carmaker, said that they expect the production process to be ramped up in the coming months and likewise the demand for workers will rise. Right now the auto vendors are comfortable with the present strength as a fewer number of cars and bikes are being produced, he said, preferring anonymity.  Agriculture  The migration of agricultural workers to their home states has made the work of paddy transplantation and sowing of vegetables difficult for the coming season. Deen Mohammed, district horticulture officer, Nuh (an area known for its vegetable production), said that cost of labour has doubled as workers have left. This will impact farm operations in a big way. Many farmers are leaving their fields fallow. Some are choosing to plant mustard instead of vegetables. This will reduce production and increase the price of vegetables in the coming months, he said.  Satish Yadav, a progressive farmer from village Mankdola, echoed his views and said that almost all farmworkers have left barring those who are permanently employed. The sowing of paddy crop is going to take a hit across the state and other farm operations will also get affected. The cost of labour has also risen and this will impact farming, he said.  The farmers are now waiting for the situation to return to normalcy as they neither have any agency nor the reach to call back the seasonal farm labourers. Some of the farmers have tried to reach out to the labourers but nothing concrete has come out of it, said Yadav.",MUSTARD OIL

The party was initially held at Shankar and Arundhati Nags farm at the outskirts of Bengaluru as the couple believed mango was a family fruit best enjoyed when eaten in company.  From the first mango party held at Ranga Shankara, apart from exchanging and eating mangoes, discussions of the varieties of mango, poems and stories on the fruit and competitions of dishes using mango are part of the festival.  Annual affair  We have had one every year, says Arundathi. It is gratifying that nearly 500 kilograms including Karnataka-specific varieties are savoured in a day. It is such an important part of our calendar that it refuses to disappear even during COVID-19. The mango party has a mind of its own and is going digital on June 14.  Director MS Sathyu always brought mango chitranna (mango rice) and mango gojju every year, says Arundathi. We will miss Sathyu and Sihi Kahi Chandrus mouth-watering preparations this time. Chandrus mango chaat corner always was a major draw.  Arundathis favourite dish is mango saasive. She makes it with baby (sakkare guthi) mangoes, coconut, red chillies, mustard seed paste, salt and jaggery. This time since it is a virtual party, my friend and theatre associate Gayathri Krishna (of performing arts platfrom Bhoomija) and I will only cook programmes.  As many as possible  Ranga Shankara buys as many varieties of mangoes as possible for the party. Those who are growing mangoes are asked to bring mangoes as well. Nearly 500 kilograms are brought in, says Gayathri. Some are made into dishes, and some put in large urlis for people to buy or taste. It was a time to eat, talk and breathe mangoes. Last year we procured mangoes from Ghani Khan, a farmer in Kiragooru near Srirangapattana. His orchard has 120 varieties, from trees planted under the patronage of Hyder Ali and Tipu Sultan. Local varieties of mangoes including Rehman, Khava Pasand, Maaka, Rehaan, Aabid, Meetemaayi Pasand, Chotu, Shaakri, Shireen, Tahara, Nargis, Laddu and Laal Badaam were served.  Telling tales  This year, there will be a storytelling competition on mango for children between the ages of five and six. Children should send their entries in video format. Ranga Shankara will pick the two and stream them at the mango party. There is a mango recipe competition that is open to all. Participants should mail their recipes to rsmangoparty@gmail.com. The best recipes will be selected and prepared by Anju Sudarshan at Ranga Shankara Caf and the videos will be streamed at the mango party.  There will be a four-round quiz with an hour between each round. Chandru, MD Pallavi, Vivek Madan and Arundhati will conduct a round each. Jayanth Kaikini, Dundiraaj, Apara and Jogi have written poems for the mango party, which will be recited at the party, says Gayathri.  The mango party by Ranga Shankara is on June 14 from 2 pm to 5.30 pm. Details and schedule is on Ranga Shankaras Facebook page.

Future Group and V-Mart have put in place systems to prevent panic buying at their neighbourhood grocery stores.  ""Availability was not the issue but supply chain was impacted (due to the lockdown). The government has got into the picture and they are enabling the supply chain to happen,"" Retailers Association of India CEO Kumar Rajagopalan told PTI.  He further said, ""The supplies are actually getting regularised with the government helping. If people do not do panic buying, there is enough stock and there is no problem."" When contacted, Spencer's Retail Managing Director Devendra Chawla said, ""We are well stocked for now on essentials.  However, we are in touch with brand manufacturers so that supply chain for next few weeks is in place.  It could mean smaller batch sizes or relaxing some manufacturing efficiencies for some time to tide over current supply constraints.  "" V-Mart, which operates mainly in tier-II and -III cities, said it has not faced supply issues but has put in place restrictions on how much can a consumer buy.  ""We are currently operating around 25 stores in the lockdown, which are mainly in states such as UP and Bihar.  Though we have supply, we have put restrictions over the quantity of purchase,"" V-Mart Retail Chairman and Managing Director Lalit Agarwal said.  The company has capped purchases on several items.  For instance, a customer can buy only 20 kg rice, 10 kg atta, 4 kg pulses, 12 packets of biscuits of a single type and noodles, and 5 Kg sugar.  Future Group too has put several restrictions at its neighborhood food and grocery store chain Easyday Club.  As per the restrictions, a person can not buy more than two packets of 10kg atta, five pieces of 100 gm butter, two packets of ghee (1 kg), 5 litres of mustard and soya oil, 10 kg of sugar and not more than 5 kg of rice and pulses.  However, the company has not put any such restrictions at its big format Big Bazaar stores, where it is dispensing only essential items following the government's decision to impose a lockdown to contain the Covid-19 pandemic.  FMCG players like HUL, ITC, Dabur India, Parle Products, GCPL and Jyothi Labs have flagged availability of workers at factories and trucks for transportation as the biggest challenges for their supply chain.  However, they have said there are adequate stocks for up to two to three weeks and the situation has improved following government intervention to allow plant operations and movement of trucks.  ""These are difficult times and from our perspective, we are doing everything to get our production and our distribution running to make sure that the consumer gets the products which are essential for their day to day life,"" HUL Chief Financial Officer Srinivas Phatak said.  He further said some of the operations of the company have been impacted by the lockdown but ""we are also hopeful that the various measures which the government is initiating and many of our products really being essential goods, we hope to see the situation improve as we go along.  "" Similarly, Dabur India Executive Director-Operations Shahrukh Khan said, ""The situation has eased a bit with approvals for plant operations and movement of trucks coming in.  These have eased some of the big bottlenecks that the industry was facing for movement of raw materials, packing materials and finished products.  It would certainly help in kickstarting the functioning of the supply chain.  "" ITC also said it has been working closely with state authorities and local administration to ensure that manufacturing and distribution activities continue uninterrupted with minimum people.  It would take a few more days for the entire ecosystem and processes to be streamlined for movement of essential goods, it added.  Likewise, Parle Products had also said that despite only 50 per cent of workers allowed, production has been managed through shift systems to ensure that its products remain available.  Jyothy Labs Ltd Joint Managing Director Ullas Kamath had said the company's inventory level was comfortable with 2-3 weeks of stock.  However, truckers body All India Motor Transport Congress (AIMTC) said only 5 per cent of the around 90 lakh trucks across India are plying on the roads at the moment due to shortage of drivers and labour at loading and unloading points due to the nationwide lockdown, thereby severely hampering transportation of goods.",MUSTARD OIL

An award-winning writer, his works have been translated to English, Hindi, Tamil and German. His latest short story collection titled A Fistful of Mustard Seeds translated by freelance journalist P N Venugopal is an anthology of 12 standalone stories published separately throughout the authors career. While each story delves into a different theme, an underlying motif of the banality of human existence and the mysteries of the mind run through all.  Let alone other people, do you know yourself? The story titled Hills, Stars pierces our mind by evoking perilousness of ego. The protagonist Monayi in the story Three Fingers lives through the stress and strain of every creative person. How we are constricted in figuring out the other is carved out beautifully through the metaphor of an egg in The Perch which tells the story of Padmini. The tale narrates how different perceptions are shaped by identities. Padminis dislike for the stench of eggs and her reluctance to cook them for her husband represents the subconscious empathy of a mother who nurtures the foetus to a child.  In Three Blind Men Describe an Elephant, the writer gives an account of how captive we are in our perception which is largely a product of our contexts. The alienation of the excluded is more touchingly carved out in the story My Father is a Thief. Mathukutty, the thief, is a victim to the vicious nature of the society. The story symbolically narrates the attempt of the boy to rescue his father. However, Mathukutty enters the property of Melmuri Pappachan, a feudal landlord and commits suicide.  Here, Melmuri Pappachan represents the treacherous face of society that traps the poor and unleashes violence on the marginalised.Juxtaposing individual and society and spotting nuances of human emotions, this anthology offers a wonderful reading experience.  Each story forces the readers to identify themselves as the protagonists. Read it only if you are ready to let your emotions tumble out, like a hand full of mustard seeds.

While the issue of mustard and wheat procurement dominated the discussion among the leaders, sources told The Indian Express that possible extension of lockdown also came up and the CM sought suggestions from all the party leaders.  With the COVID-19 cases continuously rising in Haryana, the possibility of extending the lockdown in the state is gaining more weight. Although the final decision is likely on April 11 after PM Narendra Modi speaks to CMs of all the states, sources said that the lockdown may be extended at least in some districts.  Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar today held an all-party meeting through video-conference, Wednesday. While the issue of mustard and wheat procurement dominated the discussion among the leaders, sources told The Indian Express that possible extension of lockdown also came up and the CM sought suggestions from all the party leaders.  There is a possibility that the lockdown will be extended in the state, but the final decision is likely after Prime Minister holds video conference with all the CMs on April 11. There is a feeling that although shopping malls, multiplexes, cinemas, schools and colleges are likely to remain shut, the manufacturing industry and other establishments may be given some relaxation in some areas, former CM Bhupinder Singh Hooda told The Indian Express.  A senior Haryana government official said: There are four districts, Nuh, Faridabad, Palwal and Gurgaon that have shown large number of positive cases, while in remaining districts the number is not that high even after all these days. The inter-district borders and inter-state borders may continue to remain closed, but relaxations in other districts may be given.  Hooda added, I told the CM that it is the time when everybody should rise above the political ideologies and support the nation. Crop procurement is one of the major issues. The CM has announced approximately 2,000 mandis, but locations are also to be identified. I suggested that schools can be a good choice. Even farmers can use the school premises for storing their harvested crop. I appealed to the CM to provide a significant insurance cover to our health sector employees, right from doctors to the sweepers.  Another senior officer of the state government said, To move the economy, certain bold steps are required. The industries will collapse, otherwise and since almost 90 per cent of the labour is in unorganised sector, it will be catastrophic if layoffs begin. The government is examining all the aspects.  INLD chief Abhay Chautala told The Indian Express, There was a discussion on extension of lockdown. There was almost a consensus that at least areas that are free of these coronavirus should be given relaxation. At least areas where there is no positive case, those areas should be given adequate relaxations. Home minister Anil Vij said that the government may open a few areas post April 14 and shall assess the impact. Then subsequent decisions will be taken.  He added: In fact, there was also a suggestion by JJPs Nishan Singh to reopen the liquor vends. However, nobody agreed to that.  Haryana Congress president Kumari Selja said that government should provide relief to the small scale industries of the staterelief should be declared both for these industries and for labourers too.  Khattar speaks to religious heads  Khattar on Wednesdy also spoke with heads of various religious sects through video conferencing for about two hours and asked them to appeal to their followers to maintain social distancing and also contribute to the Corona Relief fund.  Govt faces financial crunch  The government is also facing immense financial crunch and is exploring ways to overcome it. In the last few days, we have lost a revenue of Rs 2300 crore approximately. Another Rs 4000 crore shall be lost this month. We are even facing difficulties in taking care of routine government expenses. Yet, we are making all efforts to feed the poor and needy and ensuring they get at least two meals daily, Khattar said.  The numbers are increasing in a few districts. But there are 5-6 districts that are so far untouched by the virus. We need to bring down the number in the remaining districts as well, Khattar added.",MUSTARD OIL

Their food was on the verge of running out when help arrived from the Gurgaon Nagrik Ekta Manch, a citizens group that has been working towards providing food to labourers and migrant workers left stranded in the city since the beginning of the 21-day nationwide lockdown, imposed to curb the spread of the Sars-Cov-2.  The group is a collective of around 2,000 local residents who are using their resources to channelise food items and rations, reaching out to underprivileged families on a daily basis. For this, they have put in place a process to first scan appeals received personally or through social media to determine the urgency and choose recipients, pack rations, and then transport them to those in need.  We have a team of over 2,000, all regular residents of the city, each of whom contributed money for this initiative, said Rahul Roy, a member of the Manch overlooking the operations said.  Roy says the process of providing food usually begins some days before it reaches residents  the starting point is the appeals that come through Whatsapp groups, mass organisations, NGOs and individuals.  In the hours that follow, a team of 10 verifies basic details over the phone to determine if the area indeed has a demand and whether it is getting ration supply from another volunteer group. Subsequently, a site visit is conducted by a volunteer to gauge the needs of the area, ascertain a point of local contact, the number of households in need of rations, and their addresses, along with basic identification details.  Once this process is through, a procurement team works towards gathering the rations using contributions made by members of the Manch as well as residents of the city. These are then stored and packaged at a catering facility in Udyog Vihar which, prior to the lockdown, would sell food to offices and organisations.  Each package given to a family by the group has five kilogram (kg) of rice, five kg flour, one litre bottle of mustard oil, one kg salt, 500 grams turmeric, some coriander and red chilli powder, one soap bar and 1.5 kg of pulses.  We volunteered to help the Manch supply food to those in need ever since the lockdown began. I have a team of six who pack all these items and when the volunteers arrive, they load the rations in their cars, says Vipin Sharma, who runs the catering facility.  It is around noon that these vehicles  usually around 10-15 in number  arrive at the facility to pick up the rations and deliver them to local contacts across the city.  It is the local contacts who are further responsible for overseeing their distribution to individual families, said Roy, adding that the team of volunteers are divided a day in advance, as per the demand.  For example, if 100 packets of ration are required in Sirhaul village then three members are allotted the task of delivering the rations in their individual vehicles. If it is a smaller number, such as 10-15 packets that need to be dropped near the Hero Honda Chowk, for instance, then one volunteers vehicle would suffice.  On an average, members say ration is supplied to 250 to 300 families every day across areas that include Nathupur village, Khandsa road, Railway road, Sarhaul village, and Sikanderpur, which have a high concentration of migrant and daily wage workers who are out of work and hence have no money to purchase essential items for a living, and are on the brink of starvation.  Most of these slum dwellers work as daily wage earners, auto-rickshaw drivers, construction workers and domestic helps. The lockdown has left them in a lurch since they lead a hand-to-mouth existence. With no work, they do not have the money to procure food and feed their families, said Gulaab, a member of the Surat Nagar Mahila Samiti, which coordinated the ration supply that reached the areas residents last week.  Located close to the Daulatabad flyover, sandwiched between the Dwarka Expressway and the railway tracks, Surat Nagar in Sector 104 is an area of contrast  concrete houses with winding, narrow lanes are set off against small slum clusters that appear unexpectedly, scattered across the neighbourhood.  Hailing mostly from Bengal and Bihar, the migrant workers who reside in these slums say they have been struggling to find even one square meal a day ever since the 21-day lockdown was imposed, and were expecting to run out of rations by the second weekend of April.  Salim Alam, an auto-rickshaw driver, said, My earnings have come down to zero ever since the lockdown has been imposed. I cannot take my vehicle out on the roads, and there are no passengers even if I try. I have been feeding my family of five using whatever money remained, but I could not have continued in this way even until the end of this week. The rations we have received today have saved our lives.  For the volunteers engaged in distribution works, however, the task is not without its cons, with them risking themselves to infections as they visit highly congested areas to complete the job.  We take multiple precautions. The basics, of course, are that we all wear masks and gloves and carry hand sanitisers with us. In addition, the moment we enter our homes after completing the delivery, we go straight for a shower and put our clothes in the wash, to avoid any infection we may have caught from impacting our surroundings, said Shehnaz Hussain, a member of the group who lives in Sector 5.  In order to ensure that the process of delivery is smooth, the group members say they have given additional guidelines to their volunteers as well and cautioned them to ensure that they dont get mobbed. Furthermore, considering the short supply of rations, volunteers have been advised to abandon the task if, while delivering, they sense that ration has already reached the people through other sources.  The fight for the volunteers is, they say, not just a physical one against coronavirus as they expose themselves to risk of infection by roaming around the city and handling goods but also an emotional one, as they struggle to persuade their families on a daily basis to let them go out. Among them is Vipin, a caterer, who says leaving his house for the work is a daily struggle as he has to convince his family members that it is worth the risk.

The government has decided that every day, only 100 farmers will be allowed to bring their produce to the mandis. The market committees will ensure that all the agricultural produce including wheat, mustard and black gram should be brought into the yards only after an online e-gate pass is issued to the farmers, who are registered and verified on the governments Meri Fasal Mera Byora web portal. Farmers can register themselves till April 19 on the portal.  It has also been decided that the produce from other States will be not purchased till further instructions, according to the Haryana State Agricultural Marketing Board.  To reduce congestion, the procurement of mustard will start from April 15 and wheat from April 20. The procurement season 2020-21 will end on June 30. The number of purchase centres for wheat procurement have been increased to 2,000 from 477. For mustard, they have been increased from 67 to 140.  ..during the procurement only 50 farmers may be allowed in the mandi from 8.00 a.m. to 2.00 p.m. and another 50 from 2.30 p.m. to 6.00 p.m., said the guidelines.  Also for smooth procurement, the market committee in consultation with the concerned Mandi Associations will issue the schedule for the registered farmers on daily basis.  Chief Secretary Keshni Anand Arora on Thursday said instructions had been issued to Deputy Commissioners to keep a close watch on the entry and exit points of the yards. Entry passes to the staff, commission agents, labourers and farmers visiting these centres should be given in a systematic manner to avoid mass gathering, she said.  The government has also set up a dedicated 24x7 toll-free helpline number 1800-180-2060 which would be fully operationalised by April 13. An ideal layout plan for every mandi has been circulated to all districts to ensure that no farmer, labourer, commission agent or transporter gets infected even as every single grain of wheat, gram, mustard and sunflower of every farmer of Haryana is procured at the Minimum Support Price, said the Agricultural Marketing Board.",MUSTARD OIL

This year families cannot get together for Easter and celebrate. We wanted to spread some cheer. Our portion sizes take into consideration those stranded alone, says Radhica, who specialises in a variety of Coorg-style pork preparations.  The couple are not alone: from humble setups to leading hotels, many in a variety of cities are doing their limited bit to spread some Easter cheer to their guests under lockdown, away from their hometowns and loved ones. Taj Mahal hotel in Delhi, for instance, is at the other end of the spectrum, offering a package including treats like hot cross buns, Easter eggs, assorted cookies, chocolate muffins, cranberry sauce, a pack of pasta and more at 4,000 per hamper.  In the case of Uttham and Radhica,The method of cooking is extremely important, and when it comes to Coorg style, it is slow cooking which locks in the flavour and cooks out into a most delightful texture. Most importantly, no preservatives or additives are used, says Radhica.  For Easter, their menu has Oriental style sticky ribs, pork burger patty, traditional Coorg Pandi (pork) curry, pulled pork and chilli pork. Curly Sue has partnered with Dunzo and Swiggy and can deliver all over Bengaluru. We cook through the week and have a sufficient stock of products. During the lockdown, we prefer the fresh frozen format as people are ordering huge portions, and moreover it travels well and stores brilliantly, says Radhica.  Keeping it classic  In Hyderabad, Park Hyatt is keeping its offering minimal but traditional. The menu  for pickup as well as close-vicinity delivery  includes whole roast chickens made both in our classic way and in a mustard marination, stuffed with onion, bread, spinach and nutmeg, says Executive Chef Yogender Pal, adding, They are being offered with variations of sauce options and served with roasted potatoes, sauted mushrooms, and honey glazed carrot. The menu also includes traditional coconut carrot cake, another of our classics.  Prices begin at 2,000 for a full chicken along with sides. The menu is based on local produce that the kitchen already has access to, and of course, the limitations of a small team. Says the chef, We have most of the ingredients required for the limited menu that is being curated A small team of chefs and other members are in-house taking care of the home delivery menu and the special Easter menu.

Currently we are managing with our internal logistics, adhering to all norms and regulations, and ensuring our delivery protocols follow all regulations. The objective is to reach out to our regular guests and not go into bulk deliveries via third party aggregators.  He explains, We are currently not looking to call in more colleagues to travel and come in to the hotel and are encouraging most of them to stay home, stay safe and work from home when required. The hotel is still operational with limited in-house guests and we have our kitchens open to ensure they are comfortable. This allows us the opportunity to deliver some of our signature dishes and comfort food to those ordering food at home.  Chef Abhishek Basu of JW Marriott Juhu, Mumbai, had begun planning his Easter menu over a month ago, when this whole thing [COVID-19] had not happened in such a big scale, but then everyone had to eventually close operations around the city, he says. In the last few days, we had just begun our home delivery and thats when people began asking if we are doing anything for Easter.  Choices, choices  The menu comprises creamy tagliatelle mushroom and spinach, spinach and vegetable lasagna, grilled New Zealand lamb chops, smoked chicken pasta, roast chicken, and desserts like carrot cake, bunny Swiss roll (family size), Easter brownie bar and Easter apple strudel, delivered within a five kilometre radius.  The chef, used to a kitchen team of over 100 personnel, is now working with a handful of cooks. Its not like anyone is holding large celebrations this year. So naturally, the portions reflect this. The menu has been available since April 8, and will be till April 12.  The Park in Chennai, which usually offers an elaborate menu, has curated a small but functional menu suitable for the current situation, and is even providing door delivery. It includes roast chicken, lamb lasagna with mushrooms, spinach and ricotta cheese lasagna and Easter chocolate truffle cake (1,600 per kilo).  Orders above 5,000, are given by door delivery, and there is the option of self-pick up as well. Executive chef Ashutosh Nerlekar has taken into consideration the response over the past few years, identified the favourites of guests and ensured that only those popular dishes found their way to his Easter menu.",MUSTARD OIL

Also read: World faces worst economic fallout since Great Depression, says IMFs Kristalina Georgieva  The virus has now killed more than 87,000 people and infected over 1.5 million, according to an AFP tally on Thursday, sparing almost no country and tipping the world into a devastating economic crisis as global commerce shudders to a halt.  For the second straight day, the U.S. grieved nearly 2,000 deaths on Wednesday, as flags flew at half-mast in hardest-hit New York.  There was also a record death toll of 938 over 24 hours in Britain, where Prime Minister Boris Johnson spent a third night in intensive care, his condition said to be improving.  France saw its total number of dead climb over 10,000 as the country prepared to extend its strict lockdown measures. Spain and Italy are still seeing hundreds of deaths per day despite tentative signs the disease may have peaked.  Also read: Coronavirus India lockdown Day 16 live updates  And the pandemic is marching into areas previously only lightly affected: in Africa, Ethiopia declared a state of emergency and Liberia said it was locking down its capital Monrovia.  Its deadly tentacles also crept deep into the Amazon rainforest, with the first case detected among the Yanomami, an indigenous people isolated from the world until the mid-20th century and vulnerable to disease.  Nevertheless, some glimmers of hope shone in the darkness, with New York Governor Andrew Cuomo saying the epidemic curve seemed to be flattening.  We are hopefully heading towards a final stretch, the light at the end of the tunnel, said Trump.  - 'Playing with fire' -  All around the world, medical facilities are at bursting point as they struggle with a relentless procession of critically-ill patients.  In the badly affected city of Guayaquil in Ecuador, sick patients are passing out before arriving at emergency care and the elderly are slumped outside in wheelchairs at overwhelmed hospitals.  My grandmother died, my mother has all the symptoms, my 15-year-old sister too and the government is doing nothing, nothing! We need to be almost dying in order to receive assistance, said Xiomara Franco, a relative of a sick patient.  There is a lack of oxygen, a lack of medicine, a lack of nurses and doctors, a lack of stretchers, complained Henry Figueroa, another angry relative.  At the global level, the World Health Organization and Trump are embroiled in an ugly war of words, with Trump accusing the U.N. body of blowing it and being too close to China.  WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus urged unity at a time of global crisis, saying: If you don't want many more body bags, then you refrain from politicising it.  It's like playing with fire.  - 'Better to die' -  Governments are wrestling with the problem of when to exit lockdown procedures and reboot a global economy that is effectively in deep freeze.  The World Trade Organization warned the pandemic was likely to spark the deepest recession of our lifetimes, with global trade poised to plummet by one third.  The Bank of France estimated the country's economy shrank around six percent in the first quarter -- the worst performance since the end of World War II.  Europe powerhouse Germany is seen contracting an eye-watering 10 percent as the eurozone squabbled about pooling debt for coronabonds to help the worst-affected members such as Spain and Italy.  In Miami, hundreds lined up in cars to get unemployment forms after the website crashed due to a surge in demand.  Gus Rios, a 67-year-old former factory worker, said: People are looking for help, people (are) crazy right now, almost, to get something because we don't know the situation how long is going to be.  Recent US data indicate 10 million people have lost their jobs in the world's top economy that is closed for business.  In India, a virus-induced lockdown is hitting the millions of poor hardest as they wait for promised government food subsidies that cannot come quick enough for mother-of-three Rajni Devi, 30.  Last night we had roti (Indian flatbread) with salt mixed in mustard oil, she said.  It's better to die than starve like this.  - 'Doing something good' -  The pandemic has forced half of humanity inside, an unprecedented measure that has allowed wildlife to reclaim previously choked streets.  In India, hundreds of monkeys are running riot in the roads around the presidential palace while peacocks display their spectacular trains on top of parked cars in Mumbai.  In Vienna, animals are being conscripted into the fight against the virus, with horse-drawn carriages converted from a tourist attraction to a food delivery service.  Christian Gerzabek, who drives one of the famous city Fiaker, said business had crawled to a halt but the horses still have to be moved, they want to get out after the winter.

Sales of cooking oils too have fallen 25 per cent with closure of all hotels, restaurants and cafeterias because of the lockdown to control Covid-19, said Angshu Mallick, deputy CEO of Adani Wilmar.  In the packaged edible oil segment, Adani Wilmar is a market leader with over 20 per cent share. ""We used to process and produce around 8,000 tonnes of edible oil per day. The production level has come down by 40 per cent because of the labour shortage,"" Mallick told PTI.  He said a large number of migrant labourers have gone back to their hometowns, while locals are not willing to work because of fear of getting infected from this disease.  The company, which has around 25 processing plants across various states, is transporting cooking oils through trucks as more labourers are required to move goods through railways.  ""Demand has also come down by 25 per cent,"" Mallick said, adding the supply situation would remain tight as production has fallen more than the demand.  Asked about the price situation, he said the company has not increased the retail prices after lockdown, although the labour and freight costs have increased.  Malilick said the imports of edible oil are happening smoothly and the global commodity prices are stable.  He further said the harvesting of mustard crop will gain momentum from next week in states like Rajasthan, boosting domestic output.  On demand for other food items under the Fortune brand, Malick said sales of branded wheat flour, broken basmati, pulses, besan (gram flour) and soyabean chunks have risen sharply.  In view of the lockdown, Adani Wilmar has partnered with Swiggy for home deliveries of its food items.  The country's total edible oil demand is 230 lakh tonnes annually, which is largely met through imports. India's total vegetable oil (edible and non-edible) imports increased 3.5 per cent to 155.5 lakh tonnes in the 2018-19 marketing year (November-October).  While shipments of edible oil increased to 149.13 lakh tonnes in the 2018-19 marketing year from 145.16 lakh tonnes in the previous year, the imports of non-edible oil grew to 6,36,159 tonnes from 5,09,748 tonnes during the period under review.  During the November 2019 to February 2020 period of the current oil year, imports have fallen by 6.1 per cent to 45,63,791 tonnes, compared to 48,62,849 tonnes in the corresponding period of the previous year.",MUSTARD OIL

Playing their role in spreading awareness on coronavirus in the hinterland, the village heads or sarpanch are also ensuring that farmers follow social distancing norms during the harvest season.  ""Smoking hookah is part of our culture as villagers, especially the elderly gather at a common place in the village to socialise and share the hookah.  Initially, it was a bit difficult to make them understand, but we prevailed upon them and soon everyone realised that it can be dangerous in view of coronavirus and now no one can be found smoking hookah outside,"" said Hoshiar Chand, sarpanch of Nazelda Kalan in Sirsa.  Sarpanch of Pabra in Hisar district Rajesh Dhillon said that smoking hookah and playing cards is quite common in villages and too in big groups.  ""When we told villagers such things can be counter productive to the efforts of the government to check spread of coronavirus, they gave it up within some days,"" said Dhillon.  Haryana has so far reported 183 coronavirus cases.  Majority of the cases have been reported from four districts of Nuh, Palwal, Gurugram and Faridabad.  Sarpanch or village head of Handi Khera in Sirsa district, Atma Ram, said he makes it a point to go even door-to-door to ensure the directives of the government pertaining to COVID and lockdown are followed by all.  With harvesting season currently on, he has made one point clear to farmers-ensure social distancing while working in fields.  The government will start procurement of mustard from April 15 and wheat from April 20.  The procurement has been delayed this time in view of the COVID-19 outbreak and lockdown which has been enforced to check its spread.  ""The government keeps emphasising the importance of social distancing and everyone including farmers have been told this is the key if we have to keep everyone safe,"" Ram told PTI.  While Handi Khera Sarpanch Atma Ram said his village has a population of nearly 2,200, Nazadela Kalan and Pabra are big villages with population of over 9,000 and 10,000, respectively.  The sarpanches said that they regularly share the information, updates and government directives pertaining to coronavirus and lockdown with villagers.  Village heads said that as wearing turbans and sporting a cotton wrap around the neck was part of village culture, everyone already has got into the habit of covering their face by using them as masks.  In several villages, locals are enforcing ""Thikri Pehra"", under which a few villagers, especially youth form teams to guard village boundaries to make sure that no outsider except those providing essential services or government officials enter the village during the lockdown period, a measure taken in view of coronavirus spread.

The next day, he and his family prepared over 50 packets, each containing two kgs of rice, one kg potato, a small bottle of mustard oil, a packet of salt, onions and half-a-kg of pulses.  ""I spent about Rs 8,000-10,000 for purchasing and packing these items,"" Das said hesitatingly, as he did not seem keen to share the cost of his noble deed.  He said he used his uniform for the service of people.  ""I donned my uniform as the movement of civilians was barred due to the lockdown, used my 'gamocha' (a traditional Assamese scarf) as a mask and got a handcart to distribute the packets among the needy,"" Das said.  When reminded that he acted like a good samaritan, he said he only knows that ""efforts of any kind always count"".  ""My colleagues in my delta company unit in Shopian and in the entire force are spread out to help in the fight against coronavirus and the lockdown-affected people in whatever way they can.  I am just one among them,"" Das, who has a young son and a daughter, said.  His boss and Commandant of the 76th battalion of the Central Reserve Police Force (based in Jammu) Neeraj Pandey is all praise for his ""tough and dedicated"" colleague.  ""I am proud of what Das did to help people, despite being on official leave.  He has gone beyond his call of duty, but that is what our ethos and regimentation are all about,"" he said.  Unfazed by the continuing lockdown, Das plans to replenish the stocks for those who need his help.",MUSTARD OIL

As you spend a lot of time at home in the lockdown, you can put natural ingredients to great use to achieve your skin goals. We ask beauty experts and bloggers to share which kitchen ingredient they swear by and why.  Curd or Dahi (Shutterstock)  Shilpa Arora, lifestyle blogger: Eat and apply curd to glow from inside out  Curd is beneficial not only for digestion or immunity but it can do wonders for your skin as well. If you want soft, nourished and supple skin then the solution is eating curd daily and also applying it on your face. Mix curd and honey to make a smooth paste and leave on the face for 15 min. Rinse off with cold water. With its anti-inflammatory properties, curd soothes your skin and is an effective remedy for sunburn too.  Haldi or turmeric (Shutterstock)  Divyun Nanda, lifestyle blogger: Haldi helps heal  Haldi or turmeric has always been my favourite beauty ingredient due to its amazing antimicrobial, and antioxidant properties. It helps deep clean the pores, calm the skin and heal acne. In the lockdown, I have been using this traditional ubtan with haldi. I take a little haldi (powdered), besan, masoor dal (the pink or malka variety), some olive oil or mustard oil and honey along with half lemon juice to make a paste and apply on the face and neck. I allow it to remain for 15 minutes, and then I wash it off with cold water. It removes dead cells and imparts a pink glow to my skin.  Kalongi oil (Shutterstock)  Tanisha Pant, beauty expert: Kalonji oil is packed with beauty benefits  Just like our inner skin, our skin and hair also need nutrient rich food. I use a mix of eggs, sugar and kalonji oil to make a rich paste. I apply it on my hair for 20 minutes and then wash off with a mild, sulfate free shampoo. A mix of buttermilk and kalonji oil is great to brighten up dull skin. Buttermilk has natural bleaching properties, and kalonji oil has antibacterial properties which prevent allergies.  Besan or Gramflour (Shutterstock)  Richa Aggarwal, makeup expert: Besan is an all-rounder  For me, its besan. It can be turned into a scrub for deep cleansing, a hydrating pack for dry skin, a brightening agent for dull, tanned skin, and an oil absorber for oily skin. It depends on what you mix it up with to make it perform a certain task. For a quick scrub, mix it with orange peel powder. To nourishing dry skin, mix besan with honey and malai, for oily skin, add haldi and chaach to it, for normal skin, mix with raw milk, while for brightening up your complexion, soak a few strands of saffron in water and add besan to make a pack.",MUSTARD OIL

(File photo)  CHANDIGARH: Former chief minister and leader of opposition Bhupinder Singh Hooda on Friday questioned state governments announcement of appointing 17 thousand Kisan Mitras and said the government should first become a friend of the farmers.  ""What is the benefit of appointing a Kisan Mitra if the government itself has become anti-farmer? The government should reconsider its anti-farmer policies instead of coining new phrases. All the ministers, officers and government employees should first act like friends of farmers but the government seems to have failed to do so and this is the reason why the government is appointing Kisan Mitras. Looking at the intention and policy of the government, it seems that farmers will not get any benefit from this,"" Hooda remarked.  The leader of opposition said the farmers today need relief and encouragement from the government. ""If the government wants to be a friend of the farmers, then they should implement the Swaminathan Commission report , give a fair price for the crop, reduce the input cost of agriculture, remove taxes on farming equipment. The government should reduce the price of diesel which are increasing daily and above all, steps should be taken towards a loan waiver,"" Hooda said, highlighting the demands of the farmers.  Far from fulfilling the demand, the government is working to cover new scams in the purchase of paddy, gram, mustard besides the scam sugarcane oil scam, he added. ""Instead of giving relief and encouragement to the farmer, the government is constantly taking steps to make agricultural inputs expensive, stopping the purchase of crops and imposing restrictions on farmers,"" he said.  ""While they do nothing for the farmers, they are coining new words and phrases to show themselves as a supporters of farmers. Earlier, FPO (Farmer Producer Organization), master trainer and Moderator were appointed by the government but the farmers are getting no benefits from them. In the last term, the BJP had also appointed outsiders as Sushashan Sahyogis . not trusting the officials. But their Sahyog could not be seen anywhere in the whole system, nor was there good governance in the state,"" Hooda quipped.  The Leader of opposition said if the government wants to appoint Kisan Mitras despite all their failures, it should appoint unemployed youth studying agriculture from HAU and not appoint Volunteers.  This will also provide employment to the youth and they will also be able to contribute to the agriculture sector, based on their expertise.

(Express photo) Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar had introduced the Bhavantar Bharpai Yojana three years ago for promoting cultivation of vegetables, horticulture and other crops. (Express photo)  Terming the Haryana governments Bhavantar Bharpai scheme as a sham and of no help to the vegetable-growing farmers, former chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda Saturday demanded MSP for vegetables, maize and sunflower.  Instead of benefiting the farmers, this scheme is making them suffer losses. The government should come out with the statistics on how many farmers have been benefitted under this scheme. It should stop misleading farmers and rather decide the MSP of vegetables, which is necessary to save farmers from facing financial ruin, Hooda said in a statement.  Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar had introduced the Bhavantar Bharpai Yojana three years ago for promoting cultivation of vegetables, horticulture and other crops. In a televised address last month, he had claimed that under the project, 500 Farmer Producer Organisations (FPOs) have already been set up in Haryana and now the number would be increased to 1,500 so that farmers can easily sell their crops.  Hooda, however, claimed that vegetable farmers are not getting even Re 1 to 2 per kg of their produce while the consumer is paying the usual Rs 20-30 per kg for the same vegetables. Farmers from Yamunanagar to Dadri, Sonipat, Panipat, Karnal and Bhiwani are facing acute financial distress and are on the verge of bankruptcy, Hooda said.  Farmers in Dadri are sitting on a hunger strike after farmers in Tosham had launched a similar protest over the same issue. Every tomato-growing farmer is facing a loss of several lakh rupees and is forced to feed his produce to cattle. The government is indifferent to the condition of these farmers. The farmers demand that the government immediately compensate them for their loss by getting special survey done, the senior Congress leader said.  He said that even sunflower and maize farmers are victims of governmental neglect. On one hand, the government is asking farmers to grow maize instead of paddy, while on the other, they are not ready to procure the produce. The mandis of Pipli, Ladwa, Baban, Kurukshetra and Ismailabad are filled with unsold maize crops. Instead of MSP of Rs 1,760, farmers are forced to sell it at Rs 1200-1300 per quintal. The anger among the farmers is increasing.  Sunflower farmers are also facing difficulty in selling their produce as registrations on Meri Fasal, Meri Byora portal have been stopped. Most of the farmers who grow two crops in the same season are not able to make an entry on the portal. For example, farmers who grow maize after sunflower and potato after mustard often face problems in registration, Hooda said.  The government is avoiding making purchases from the farmers on the grounds that they have not registered on the portal. This is the reason why farmers producing vegetables, maize and sunflower of the state have reached the verge of financial ruin. The opposition requests government to shun its anti-farmer attitude and buy all the crops on MSP and compensate farmers for losses they have suffered in the last few months, he said.",MUSTARD OIL

When chefs travel, their souvenirs tend to be shared with the rest of us. Because the savour of a new dish tends to stimulate the chefs creative mind. Next thing you know, its on a menu somewhere.  Meet nine chefs whose wanderings around the world expanded their menus.  Man of the world  Joan Roca  Dish: Eat The World at El Cellar de Can Roca, Girona, Spain  When: Over the years  Inspired from: Japan (fermented soya takoyaki), Thailand (coconut tartlet with green curry chicken and cashew nuts), Korea (kimchi with pork jowl cooked with soya), Peru (causa limea with potato, rocoto, black olives, pepper and avocado), Turkey (lamb stew with sumac, cucumber, yoghurt and mint)  Travel memory: When I travel, I love visiting streets and markets to understand how people eat and submerge myself into the culture of each place. Local markets make me realise how little I know about the richness of ingredients all around the world. Listening to everything said by the locals and going outside my comfort zone of knowledge evolves to inspiration for me.  This particular dish has finger-food creations that allow us to share with our guests our last journeys. We invite customers to taste and guess each of the countries in the dish that represents a walk around the globe.  Going local  Chef Garima Arora arrived early in Manilla to explore the local cuisine; (Inset) She picked up the dish of kinilaw from Philipines  Garima Arora  Dish: Kinilaw with Koji Bread at Gaa, Bangkok  When: September, 2019  Inspired from: Manila, Philippines  Travel memory: I hadnt been to the Philippines in some time, so when we were invited to cook in Manila, we decided to arrive a few days ahead of our pop up to explore the markets and the local cuisine. Our morning started with a visit to the farmers market owned by chef Margaritas family. She showed us local ingredients like talangka (crab fat) and a variety of vinegars. She also introduced us to a dish called kinilaw, a Philippines ceviche. In the middle of the market, chef Margarita whipped up a salad of the freshest crab meat and coconut milk wed ever had, tossed with palm vinegar and fresh chillies. We loved it so much that for our pop up in Manila, we made a salad of talangka kinilaw and served it on khakra flat bread. Back home during the festive season at Gaa in December 2019, we featured the kinilaw on our special menu. This time we created a dish of our own: crab kinilaw paired with koji bread.  On a taste trek  Trekking Rwanda reminded chef Suvir Saran of Kerala and sowed the germ of the idea for a (inset) mutton ghee roast  Suvir Saran  Dish: Kerala Mutton Ghee Roast at The House of Celeste, Gurgaon  When: July, 2019  Inspired from: Rwanda, East Africa  Travel memory: I was trekking through the Volcanoes National Park in Rwanda. Something about the terrain, the richness of the colours and textures of Rwanda, the gently rolling land, the cleanliness and the ease with which the people spoke English, all reminded me of Kerala. While trekking, my mind took me through making that ghee roast with a topping of poached egg, perfectly runny inside, but gently fried with a Parmigiano-Panko crust. It went on the menu at The House of Celeste at 32nd Avenue in Gurgaon as Kerala Mutton Ghee Roast.  Lessons from the masters  Cooking with chefs in a resort in French Riviera inspired Kunal Kapur to introduce Kerala spiced duck tarts (inset)  Kunal Kapur  Dish: Kerala Duck Tarts, Raspberry Chutney, Coconut Snow  When: June, 2019  Inspired from: Nice, France  Travel memory: My trip was not only a gastronomical delight but a unique opportunity to cook with chefs Massimo Bottura, Tom Colicchio and Graham Elliot. We were to cook together for 100 people at a resort in the French Riviera. In one of our conversations, chef Bottura talked about aged meats. Eating dry, aged meats was not new to me but I had never used them in Indian food. I started with dry aged duck. After 10 days of dry aging the duck, I slow-cooked it in its own fat with some Tellicherry pepper from Kerala and gamthi variety of curry leaves. After cooking the duck, I pulled it and tossed it in Kerala masala, then paired it with fresh raspberry chutney placed in a tart with some homemade gunpowder.  Mouthful of Mexico  From his trip to Mexico City chef Manish Mehrotra picked up the himachi ceviche and recreated it as (inset) Tadka Himachi at Indian Accent  Manish Mehrotra  Dish: Tadka Hamachi, Avocado, Calcutta chutney at Indian Accent  When: November, 2019  Inspired from: Mexico City  Travel memory: On a trip to Mexico City, I realised I have only dented the surface of this multicultural citys implausible cuisine. I was invited to cook for a cinema-themed event called Millesime Mxico along with chefs from around the world. We bonded well and tried a lot of local food, running the gamut from tamales to various kinds of tacos, pulque (a fermented drink from the agave plant), churros, chocolates, horchata and a lot of sea food. The himachi ceviche caught my tastebuds  its Mexicos preferred fruit layered like rose petals, and topped with a drizzle of olive oil and a dusting of serrano chilli and a mist of lime. This speciality revels the sublimity of fresh, local ingredients prepared without extravagant intervention. Inspired, I created a Tadka Himachi to suit the Indian palate.  Desert king  Chef Akira Back ate Kabsa (inset) at an associates home in Riyadh and included it in his restaurant menu  Akira Back  Dish: Kabsa at AB Steak  When: January, 2020  Inspired from: Riyadh, Saudi Arabia  Travel memory: Saudi Arabia is rich with history, culture and cuisine. I was fortunate to eat at many different restaurants with different flavours and tastes from around the world. However, the meal that stood out was served at my associates home. The dish is called Kabsa, which is mixed rice and meat. The meat in our Kabsa that day was lamb, prepared in a style called mandi. This is an ancient technique where the meat is barbecued in a hole in the ground and covered as the meat cooks. The juices from the meat dripped over the rice, blending all the flavours together. I have created a similar item for my AB Steak restaurant menu.  Takaway from Down Under  Prateek Sadhus trip to Byron Bay, Australia, resulted in a taco-inspired (inset) rice pancake with a Kashmiri twist  Prateek Sadhu  Dish: Rice Pancake, Jackfruit  When: Mid-April, 2019  Inspired from: Byron Bay, Australia  Travel from: Palisa Andersons 107-acre Boon Luck farm in Byron Bay, Australia, is dedicated to growing delicious heirloom ranges of tropical fruits, Asian and local vegetables and herbs of all kinds. She made me try a Thai Taco that she had made for her kids. I came back inspired. We introduced a Kashmiri dish like a taco but make your own style. The taco was a rice pancake called tzir chot, a kind of cheela made with rice flour, cumin and a touch of green chillies. It gets its name from the hissing sound the batter makes when it hits the skillet. I borrowed my mothers recipe. The czot here is served with jackfruit cooked with fennel and Kashmiri chillies. It comes with three dips: walnut and yoghurt, with dehydrated mint powder; radish; and lastly, kidney beans with mustard oil.  From Israel, with love  A trip to Tel Aviv inspired chef Tanvir Kwatra to come up with different versions of (inset) hummus    Tanveer Kwatra  Dish: Dips at Andaz, Delhi  When: June, 2016  Inspired from: Tel Aviv, Israel  Travel memory: Israel is one of my favourite countries in terms of food. I remember walking through the lanes of Carmel Market and spotting Humus Hacarmel, a former synagogue turned restaurant. On the menu are three kinds of hummus: hummus, hummus fol and masabacha, all divine. Masabacha is a warm plate of hummus topped with a spoon of tahina, a spoonful of chickpeas, chopped onion, chopped pickle and a dollop of spicy relish with a sprinkle of paprika, cumin and a generous drizzle of olive oil. I interacted with the owner and spoke about hummus at length. The hummus here is prepared with a mix of chickpeas and fava beans. After this, I improvised and made a couple of versions.  A Malaysian makeover  From his frequent Malaysia trips chef Vinesh Johny came up with the recipe of (inset) Pandan & Coconut Ogura Tea Cake  Vinesh Johny  Dish: Pandan and Coconut Ogura Tea Cake at Lavonne Caf, Bengaluru  When: January, 2020  Inspired from: Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia  Travel memory: I travel frequently to Malaysia. The food scene here is absolutely phenomenal and constantly evolving. One of the ingredients there that intrigued me was pandan leaf. I remember watching my wife Joonies aunt tie the leaf into a knot and drop it into the rice cooker. The resulting rice was delicately-flavoured and with the mild, sweet and nutty aroma of the pandan. I was absolutely inspired. So the next day, with some help from Joonies Aunt Sayee, we decided to make a Pandan & Coconut Ogura Tea Cake. The air was filled with the aroma of gorgeous pandan, while the cake was absolutely light and fluffy. I havent yet introduced this cake at the Lavonne Caf, but it will go on the new menu soon.",MUSTARD OIL

But when I was asked to write it, focusing on the situation, something in me turned. The Hindu has readers who have access to food, but need ideas on how to cope with shortages. Shortages not of quantity, but of variety; in the worst-case scenario, maybe of traditional ingredients. And oftentimes of help.  A couple of weeks ago, an American magazine had a tongue-in-cheek article where the author, an accomplished baker, went to the local grocery, noted that yeast was clean off the shelves, and had a face-off with another customer over the last bag of flour on the top rack. He muttered  in his mind  about how the other chap had probably never baked bread before in his life, what a waste that bag would be, and how he knew the other would fail and get his comeuppance.  I am a grasshopper  It was slightly funny, in a superior, nudge-nudge, wink-wink sort of way. But deep down, it was a reminder of how privileged we are; we look for variety. When asked to give to those who have nothing, we hem and haw. Im trying not to sermonise, but lets count our blessings and do what we can to help others.  I cant help but think of the ant and grasshopper fable because when the lockdown was expected, all the ants I know drove around loading their cars, stockpiling victuals. Grasshoppers like me didnt, for vaguely moral reasons. And now were stuck with what we have in our cupboards. Which are, like Old Mother Hubbards, bare. Unfortunately, Im a relentless cleaner-of-shelves, so no serendipitous delights await me, however far back I reach into fridges or cupboards. I know exactly what I can expect to find  how many stumps of drying cheese and how many inches of peanut butter in the jar.  I see what people post on social media about what they cook, of how theyre coping with the lockdown. And Im amazed at the dishes home cooks are conjuring up. The Westerners all seem to have forgotten jars of sundried tomatoes in extra virgin olive oil so they can make flavourful pasta, and bags of buckwheat flour so they can make soba noodles, and bags of almond meal and boxes of cocoa powder so they can make gluten-free cake. This seems to be an opportunity to experiment. Some Indian cooks are making gatta curry, chana bhatura, gol gappa and ras malai.  Watching these posts gives me a complex, so I prefer to believe that they must be proficient cooks anyway. Maybe its to do with their now having more time to indulge a hobby, but I dont know how to make complicated dishes and Im dealing with a different challenge. Vegetables arent consistently available. Sometimes, if we have only handfuls of different vegetables in the house, I make combinations that may seem odd bedfellows, but Ive always been charmed by the Bengali panch mishali. So we collect a single radish, a carrot, a handful of beans, a layer or two of cabbage, a few leaves of spinach, a chunk of pumpkin, a potato, half a cauliflower.  Making do  The principle weve adopted is to make do and to juxtapose textures: firm and soft-and-squishable. The varieties may be more or less than panch or five, the spicing may be different, but the method is broadly to temper mustard oil with a single spice like kalonji, nigella, or a standard combination like panch phoran, a couple of green chillies, and then cook the vegetables, having cut them into cubes or fingers and timing their addition at the appropriate moment to make sure they cook.  A bit of ginger juice freshens the flavour and probably helps digestion. Finally, I add a smidgen of ghee and a pinch of sugar and it lets me pretend its authentic.  We are a meat-eating family and there is no meat, fish or chicken. Egg supply is erratic. This week, the local Safal is well stocked with lentils and pulses. Fortunately, I have a full chest of spices. The upshot of all this is that I can only perk up flavour with unexpected combinations and spices. Because Im one of the miraculously lucky lite whose only pressing concern is combating ennui.  A principle we learnt back in the days before liberalisation was to substitute, replace and adapt. I had a recipe for aubergine parmigiana that looked uncomplicated enough, but since it asked for Parmesan cheese and I had only stubs of Cheddar and Red Leicester, and because it asked for fresh basil and I had none, I did what I could. Because I had the main ingredients: aubergines and tomatoes. And the dish is elastic and accommodating.  Gone yeast  Meanwhile our local artisanal bakery has temporarily shut shop, so last week, the baker-in-residence said hed make bread. Unfortunately, the dough didnt rise. When I told a friend this, she suggested that the yeast could have expired, and sent me, in the hope of better times, the link to a video describing how to make near-perfect toddy at home, with a mere three ingredients: coconut water, sugar and yeast. Im saving it for when yeast is available.  Instead I made muffins. I wrote about them about 12 years ago, in one of my earliest columns here. Because they are so satisfying and so easy to make in these hard times, it seemed worth sharing again. As my mother, who taught me the recipe, said, theyre very forgiving  you can use any flour, any shortening, they take a few minutes, and if you want you can bung in whatever flavouring you have at hand, sweet or savoury.  SUNDAY RECIPE  Basic muffins  (makes 12)  Photo: Getty Images/ iStock  Ingredients  2 cups sifted flour   cup sugar  3 tsp baking soda   tsp salt  1 cup milk   cup vegetable oil  1 egg  Method  1. Preheat oven to 200 C (400 F). Grease bottoms only of 12 muffin-pan cups. Sift flour with baking soda and salt. Stir in sugar. In separate bowl, beat together egg, milk and oil.  2. Spread flour mixture in wide round bowl and make a well in the centre. Pour in egg-milk-oil mixture all at once. Stir with a fork just until combined. Spoon mixture into prepared muffin-pan cups.  3. Bake until golden, for about 25 minutes. Immediately remove from cups by inserting knife tip under each to loosen. Serve hot with butter.  When mixing batter, stir just until flour is moistened. Do not beat. Batter will be lumpy but makes for tender muffins.  Muffins can be frozen or kept for a few days. Wrap in foil and reheat in oven before serving.

""When liquor vends opened in other states like Delhi, UP, Chhattisgarh, there were long queues and vends at some places had to be closed.  ""But no such scene was witnessed in Haryana and the reason for this was that liquor smuggling was going on and liquor was being illegally sold during lockdown,"" he said.  The former chief minister said it was a ""serious issue"" and the government should thoroughly probe it.  During a video conference with reporters, Hooda, the leader of the opposition, was also asked about the huge stock of liquor missing from a godown in Sonipat and the SIT probe ordered by the state government.  Asked if a liquor scam has taken place under political patronage, he said, ""I cannot hold anyone guilty or innocent, this is for the SIT to probe.""  ""But if it is felt that the SIT cannot probe it, then this matter should be probed by a sitting judge of the high court,"" he added.  On the recently announced 'Mera Pani Meri Virasat' crop diversification scheme by Haryana government, Hooda said it was not a right move as it would deprive a large number of farmers from cultivating the paddy crop.  He said farmers are already facing a lot of hardship due to lockdown and it was not the right time to ""experiment"" with schemes.  He said the Congress party was not against water conservation efforts of the government, but they cannot impose a decision on farmers without viable alternative.  He also demanded a rollback of the hike in bus fare and increase of VAT on diesel and petrol prices.  Hooda said he has been saying that the opposition will extend full cooperation to the government in its fight against the coronavirus, but it cannot support them if they take ""anti-people decisions"".  ""I am of the belief that we can move ahead and resolve things with dialogue, the government must also not take any major decision without consultation,"" Hooda said.  He maintained that in a recent all-party meeting with the chief minister on the COVID situation he had said that the state can borrow to provide relief to the poor, farmers, daily wagers.  ""I said government can borrow but it should not burden common sections - If they have to impose tax they can impose on super rich, but they should not burden sections like daily wagers, common people, farmers,"" he said.  On ongoing wheat procurement, he said the lifting process was going on at a ""snail's pace"" and so far procurement of only 57 lakh metric tonne has been made, out of which only 29 LMT has been lifted from the mandis.  ""I had suggested to the government that as schools and colleges were unlikely to reopen before July-August, so their buildings should be made temporary storage places,"" he said.  Mustard procurement so far was also slow, he said, adding at some places farmers had to dispose of their crop by resorting to distress sale.  Asked to comment on Congress leader Rahul Gandhi demanding audit of the PM-CARES Fund, saying the account of money received and spent be made public, he said ""when we fight battle against COVID, these questions are bound to be raised"".  However, when asked whether he agrees with what Gandhi said, Hooda, who did not specifically comment on what his party leader has demanded, and speaking generally, said, ""I am not of this thought that any controversy should be raised today. But I do say that tomorrow they (government) will have to give account.""",MUSTARD OIL

Numbers for me have genders. Days of the week have a definite hierarchy, with Sundays leading the pack. And all my months are neatly divvied up to form a rainbow of colours.  Mays colour has always been somewhere on the spectrum between a buttery yellow and an earthy burnt Sienna. No big surprise there. Think bright summer suns, freshly baked lemon chiffon cakes and yes, the indescribable hue of a ripe Alphonso.  But there are two more shades in the family that truly define the month and, by default, summer for me.  One, the almost-neon tangerine shade of freshly pounded East Indian bottle masala, and two, the amber-coloured beer bottles that it is always stored in for longer shelf-life. Thus, the name  bottle masala.  While I am not an East Indian by birth, I have always been a big fan of their culture and, most pertinently, their cuisine. Ive lived most of my life here in Dadar West, Mumbai, surrounded by a close-knit, strongly matriarchal community of East Indian families led by genial aunties who made it their mission to indulge the budding foodie in me with their yummy curries and succulent roasts. Almost all jazzed up with the ubiquitous East Indian bottle masala. From the coconut milk-enhanced mutton lonvas to a spicy chicken moile, the bottle masala reigns supreme.  Just like the 36-ingredient Moroccan ras-el-hanout spice blend or the Ethiopian berbere mix, East Indian bottle masala is made up of a bewildering variety of spices, from the more obvious Kashmiri chillies to the Google-it-now nagkesar. The latter  I learnt just for the purposes of this piece  is also called Indian rose chestnut or cobra saffron, by the way! Besides this, the complex dry spice blend has several iterations, each with varying measurements and ratios of spices.  More the merrier  I would not be exaggerating if I said that every East Indian family uses a different recipe for bottle masala  some use 20 spices, some 30, while the most elaborate of the lot use up to 40. But try asking any self-respecting East Indian cook to part with the recipe and they will sooner part with their lives. Such is the almost militant level of secrecy that shrouds the hallowed recipe.  In fact, I remember an old neighbourhood aunty once telling me that East Indian mothers never teach their daughters how to make bottle masala for fear of them taking the prized recipe out of the family after getting married. They have no such compunctions, I was informed, for incoming daughters-in-law. I rest my case.  This leads me to a vital link, not just to the whole bottle masala supply chain, but also to my very synaesthetically-heightened month of May  the masalawaali maushis. It is the rhythmic thumping sound that these singing, itinerant spice-grinding ladies make while pounding the aromatic, roasted spices for bottle masala that I associate most with summer as well.  Illustration: Getty Images/ iStock  That May music has been missing this year. Thanks to the pandemic and the ensuing lockdown, my backyard will not be infiltrated this season by the pungent fumes and lilting melodies wafting from neighbourhood gardens. The maushis will not be coming this year.  Travelling troupes  Mainly drawn from the local Maharashtrian Agri community, these women are generally always much in demand and need to be booked months in advance. They are always armed with their wooden pounding vessel, the ukli, and its cohort, the mussal, a mace-like tool with a metal base to hit the ingredients. These groups of ladies travel from house to house from early March to the end of May to grind the annual supply of bottle masala according to each familys specifications, making sure to finish this important task before monsoon sets in.  Interestingly, though the maushis are experts in the sifting, roasting and final pounding of the spices, they will never fully know the final recipe. Not only will the house matriarch weigh each ingredient separately and hand it over to the maushis just before pounding, but as per tradition she will also withhold one vital ingredient that she will pound herself and add later to the final mix.  One of the most enduring and endearing traditions of the maushis is the singing of ovis (which literally means strung together) while they pound the spices. More specifically, they sing jatyavarchi ovi, specialised Marathi grinding songs that are used as poetic metre for rhythmic prose.  One such ovi by Bahinabai, an unlettered 19th century peasant-poet from the Khandesh region of Maharashtra, comes to mind and seems a perfect way to sum it up in times like these. It says:  Get up at midnight, neatly set  out the grain  Begin working the grinding  stone  Be patient, dont talk back, hold  your tongue  Let the memories of your old life  comfort you.  SUNDAY RECIPE  Bottle Masala  (Recipe courtesy Ann Dias)  Photo: Getty Images/ iStock  Ingredients  1 kg dried red Kashmiri chilies  250 gm dried red Madras chilies  25 gm whole wheat grain  80 gm powdered turmeric  5 gm dagdaphool, also called stone flower  200 gm cumin seeds  15 gm fenugreek seeds  500 gm coriander seeds  150 gm mustard seeds  250 gm poppy seeds  50 gm peppercorns  15 gm cloves  250 gm white sesame seeds  15 gm caraway seeds  14-15 green cardamoms  7-8 black cardamoms  10 gm cinnamon stick  10 gm asofoetida  25 gm bay leaves  1 nutmeg  5 gm tirphal, also called Japanese pepper  5 gm star anise  5 gm nagkesar, also called Indian rose chestnut  15 gm fennel seed  5 gm mace  50 gm whole Bengal gram  5 gm allspice  Method  1. Precisely measure and dry all the ingredients under the sun for two days, making sure no moisture remains in them.  2. Over low heat, dry roast the Kashmiri chillies and the Madras chillies for 8-10 mins in a wide-bottom pan, making sure to not to burn them.  3. Similarly roast the rest of the ingredients for 7-8 mins on low heat or until they are aromatic.  4. Dry grind the roasted ingredients in several batches until fine, either in a large ukli or in a spice blender. You could also take the mix to a local mill to get it pounded.  5. To stick with tradition, tightly pack the bottle masala into amber- or green-tinted, sterilised beer bottles, sealing the top off with butter paper and hot wax. Otherwise, one can also store it in an airtight container or any other lidded glass container.  (This makes for an approximately 2.5 kg yield of bottle masala, so adjust according to desired quantity.)

(Representational) Wheat procurement had started in Haryana on April 20, though it starting taking place effectively on April 23 because of three days strike by the arhtiyas. (Representational)  Payment of Rs 11,000 crore is yet to be made to farmers of Haryana in lieu of purchase of their wheat, even though food grains worth Rs 7,700 crore have reached government godowns.  According to official figures, as much as 64 lakh MT wheat was procured in the grain markets of the state till Tuesday at Rs 1,925 per quintal. The total comes to Rs 12,320 crore, but a senior functionary admitted payment of only Rs 3,957 crore has been made to the arhtiyas for farmers till Wednesday night. The farmers have got about Rs 1000 crore till now even as the payment of Rs 3,957 crore has been made to the arhtiyas, he added.  Wheat procurement had started in Haryana on April 20, though it starting taking place effectively on April 23 because of three days strike by the arhtiyas (commission) agents in the state.  The farmers are waiting for their payment, says Mandeep Nathwan, convener of Kisan Sanghrash Samiti. Congress MLA from Dabwali, Amit Sihag said, The government had promised the farmers that the payment will be made to them within three days of procurement of their produce.  From this crop season, the government had announced it would make direct payment to farmers to protect them from the exploitation by arhtiyas. However, arhtiyas, who procure crops from farmers for government agencies in lieu of commission from the government, opposed the move.  They said that if the payments were made directly to the farmers, they wont able to recover their advance from them.  Following the arhtiyas stir, the government agreed to make payments through arhtiyas, but the arhtiyas were asked to submit consent papers procured from farmers after transferring payment to them through RTGS.  But, officials believe, the arhtiyas take consultation from their charted accountants before submitting such documents to avoid any legal hassles regarding disclosure of loans to the farmers. As per provisions, we cant release another payment to the arhtiyas till they submit the consent papers of farmers regarding previous payment, said an official.  Arhtiyas say  Arhtiyas blame the complex system of payment through different channels for the delay. President of Haryana State Anaj Mandi Arhtiyas Association Ashok Gupta said, We are supposed to submit documents through a web portal which is full of deficiencies. The arhtiyas are also not internet savvy and no training was imparted to them before introducing the system.  According to Gupta, the government has made payment to the arhtiyas in lieu of wheat procurement of the first five days only. There are many arhtiyas who have not been made any payment to farmers till now. In our Ladwa Mandi, almost 90 per cent wheat of the total procurement has been lifted from the grain market. The government must release the payment as early as possible. If the payment system does not improve soon, the arhtiyas may resort to agitation, claimed Gupta.  Government says  Haryana Agriculture and Farmers Welfare Minister JP Dalal said the web portal issue has been resolved. The government has already approved payment of Rs 7,700 crore to be made to the farmer through arhtiyas. We release the payment as soon as we receive consent forms from the arhtiyas.  The minister said they count completion of procurement process only after lifting wheat from mandis to the godowns. The lifting process is slow and till now about 40 lakh MT wheat has been taken to the godowns because of labour crunch and adverse weather conditions, said the minister.  Being a new system, the arhtiyas delayed in submitting the formalities. We have introduced this system to protect farmers from any type of exploitation. Almost two-third of the total estimated procurement has already taken place in the mandis, he added.  Officials admitted that the government has been able to make less than 50 per cent payment to arhtiyas to further transfer it to the farmers in lieu of the mustard procurement too till now.",MUSTARD OIL

It gives me great joy, too, but for different reasons. I am reminded of some excellent food that I had in Thailand, prepared with the leaves of the plant, called the Morning Glory. I had never had it in India before that, but I later learnt that its Indian cousin is cooked in various ways across the country. Still, something about the leaves will always remind me of the delicious food of Thailand.  So, when I heard that one of the best Thai restaurants in town was now delivering food  and had a dish of steamed fish with crispy morning glory on the menu -- I was greatly tempted. The restaurant in the Sangam Courtyard complex is called Ziu, and I have had some great meals there. Now, in the period of the lockdown, it is delivering food across Delhi and Gurugram. Zius food was always special, for it served what can be described as nouvelle Thai. There was a tweak to the dishes that greatly enhanced the taste  and the way it looked.  Slow cooked chicken in home-made Thai green sauce Pic Credit: Special Arrangement  I called up one of the numbers that had been forwarded to me (9958677731 and 011-26180711) and asked for Roasted Chicken Nutmeg Curry Paste and Coriander, served on rice (455); Slow Cooked Chicken with Mustard Cress and Thai Basil in Home-made Thai Green Sauce (725); Stir-fried Lamb in a Red Birds Eye Chilli and Crispy Holy Basil Sauce (825); and Wok Tossed Silken Tofu and Seasonal Vegetables in Roasted Sticky Rice Powder and Chilli Lime Sauce (625). My bill came to a little less than 3,100. And Ziu added (gratis) a dish of Som Tam to my order -- crispy fried shredded green papaya served with freshly pounded roasted peanut, long green beans and spicy birds eye chilli with a lime dressing.  I had visited Ziu some years ago, and remember being completely floored by the food and the service. The young man behind the restaurant  Gurmehar Sethi  had earlier worked in places such as Nobu Dubai, Mayfair London and Banyan Tree in Thailand. I remember he had told me the word Ziu stood for cultivated. For the food, he explained, went beyond the usual.  I completely agree with him. Take his papaya salad. He has turned this dish around by crispy frying the shredded papaya. To this he adds roasted peanuts and a birds eye chilli-lime dressing. The dressing and the peanuts came in separate containers. We mixed it upand the result was something that I could have made a full meal of.  The appetiser that we had asked for Roasted Chicken Served on Crispy Rice Crackers  was superb. The rice, like murmura, had been turned into crunchy little bases, and the minced chicken was nice and spicy. I like green curries, so I enjoyed the chicken dish. The chicken had soaked in all the flavours of the Thai herbs in the curry, which was neither too runny, nor too thick. The lamb was out of this world. The meat was juicy, yet crispy, and the sauce was deliciously piquant. Though I am not much of a tofu fan (I thought we needed to order something non-meaty for a wholesome meal), I quite liked it, too. The tofu was soft and mild, and the sauces were strong. We didnt ask for the fish with crispy morning glory, for folks at home are these days not as fond of fish as they were. Another time, perhaps.  In these dark days, places such as Ziu offer us a warm little beam of light. Jiyo, Ziu.  The writer is seasoned food critic",MUSTARD OIL

We all grew up watching our mothers curdle that leftover milk to make cottage cheese or use the browning bananas to bake a loaf of delicious banana bread. Its time to turn back to those basic ideas of repurposing food for healthy and easy meals. Uchit Vohra, Executive Chef at ITC Gardenia, Bengaluru, shares how a spot of ingenuity takes you a long way with borderline vegetables, optimising their consumption. The most effective way is pickling to increase shelf life. This comes in handy when you have a spotting cauliflower, wrinkled carrots or a shrivelled aubergine. Fermenting increases their nutrient index, making the content more healthy for the gut owing to its probiotic properties, he says.  Alternatively, frying and freezing vegetables is an effective way of reusing them later. For potatoes on the withering spree, specifically, just slice and dehydrate in the sun to make potato chips. To make leafy vegetables like coriander and spinach last longer, blanch and make into a paste and freeze. For leaves and herbs, microwave on minimum power to dehydrate, then powder them and use as sprinklers, Vohra suggests.  Bananas are one of the most versatile things to transform. Throw them into cakes if you are a baking whiz or simply toss them into milkshakes and smoothies. You can also blitz it into a mixer with a few other ingredients and freeze before enjoying your homemade ice cream a couple of hours later. I use overripe bananas to make overnight oats with almond milk, or add flour to make an oats banana pancake for breakfast, says Chef Sanjana Patel of La Folie.  Similarly, aubergines can be redeemed by making them into a bharta or a baba ganoush spread. Leftover beans can be boiled and frozen to include in your next curry dish, pulav or a Russian salad, says Chef Rohan Dsouza. Border edibles are great to turn into spreads and chutneys. Mushy tomatoes work very well as tomato sambal, according to Dsouza. Optionally, chop the good parts of the over-ripe vegetables and boil them with salt and reduce to a thick slush. Then strain and store as cubes in an ice tray for later.

According to the daily flood report of the Assam State Disaster Management Authority (ASDMA), one person was killed at Rongjuli in Goalpara district.  At present, around 2.72 lakh persons are affected due to flood in Dhemaji, Lakhimpur, Nagaon, Hojai, Darrang, Barpeta, Nalbari, Goalpara, West Karbi Anglong, Dibrugarh and Tinsukia districts, it said.  Goalpara is the worst-hit district with 2.15 lakh people affected, followed by Nalbari with over 22,000 people hit and Nagaon with nearly 11,000 persons.  Till Tuesday, around 1.95 lakh people were affected in seven districts. The NDRF and SDRF have rescued nine people in the last 24 hours in Goalpara, while 172.53 quintals of rice, dal, salt and 804.  42 litres of mustard oil have been distributed along with tarpaulin and other essential items.  Currently, Brahmaputra is flowing above the danger mark at Nimatighat in Jorhat, while Jia Bharali at NH Road Crossing in Sonitpur and Puthimari at NH Road Crossing in Kamrup.  At present, 321 villages are under water and 2,678 hectares of crop areas have been damaged, the ASDMA said.  The authorities are running 57 relief camps and distribution centres in five districts where 16,720 people are taking shelter.  Embankments, roads, bridges, culverts and many other infrastructure have been damaged at various places in Golaghat, Barpeta, Nalbari, Dhemaji, Majuli, Hojai, Sonitpur, Chirang, Karimganj, Nagaon, Bongaigaon, Dima Hasao, Baksa and Lakhimpur.  Massive erosions have been witnessed at various places in Majuli, Sonitpur, Tinsukia, Chirang, Baksa, Biswanath and South Salmara districts, the ASDMA said.  While 70 people were affected by the erosion in Biswanath, the Mander Gaon ME School was washed away in South Salmara.  The report further said that at least 30 houses were damaged in landslides in four villages of Dima Hasao, affecting 72 persons.  Because of the landslide in the district, movement of three 'Shramik Special' trains were disrupted on Tuesday night until the tracks were repaired.  ""The three trains were bound for Agartala and Jiribam in Manipur. We stopped them at Guwahati and Lumding stations. After the lines were cleared, the movement started again at 11:30 am today,"" Northeast Frontier Railway Public Relations Officer Nripen Bhattacharyya said.  Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal Wednesday directed officials to ensure that all COVID-19 protocols such as social distancing, hand washing and wearing of masks are maintained at the flood relief camps so that community spread of disease can be contained during the season.  The chief minister, reviewing the flood situation in the state with officials of the ASDMA and senior officers of other departments, directed the Deputy Commissioners of all districts to keep soap and water for hand washing, masks for inmates and properly sanitise the flood relief camps.  He also directed the district administrations to ensure that no irregularities take place while distributing relief materials and also release ex gratia payments within 48 hours to the next of kin of those who lose their life in the floods.  He also instructed the Deputy Commissioners to regularly review the relief distribution system so that accountability can be fixed, if any irregularity takes place, and keep an information board in all relief camps showing details of how much relief materials have been received by every individual inmate.  The Centre has released Rs 386 crore as the first installment this year to the State Disaster Relief Fund and the chief minister emphasised on its proper utilisation for providing succour to those affected by the floods.  Sonowal also directed the power department to cut off supply to the transformers submerged in floods so that no accidental electrocution takes place.  The chief minister also directed the Public Works Department (PWD) to take steps for repairing 157 roads damaged by floods in eight districts.  He also directed the Inland Water Department to take precautionary measures to avoid boat mishaps during the rainy season and strictly enforce wearing of masks by crews and the passengers of ferries and the boats.  The Chief Minister instructed the veterinary department to provide cattle feed to the domestic animals in the flood-affected areas and also provide food to the wild animals in Kaziranga National Park and other such flood affected wildlife sanctuaries.  Meanwhile, Sonowal called on Governor Jagadish Mukhi and apprised him about the prevailing flood situation in the state.  The chief minister also apprised the governor of the steps taken by the government to deal with the COVID-19 situation, especially in view of the recent surge in the number of positive cases.  They also discussed ways to increase economic activities during the lockdown and strengthen the state's fiscal health.

Skin: A beautiful dark olive skin tone bordering on being dusky. Face: A mid-day stubble. Brows: Thick, natural and a bit bushy. Lips: Buffed and nourished using a lip balm. Accessories: Silver stud in the ear and an inverted sports cap.  Grooming  Skin  Neem and tulsi hydrating gel from Ohria Royal Ayurveda  Good skin is more important that pale skin. Work on enhancing your natural skin tone than trying to change it with skin lightening or fairness creams. Follow a regular grooming regime: face scrub, face masque and a water based moisturiser at night, just before bed.  To prevent the skin from looking oily or greasy, use a toner twice a week  ideally at the end of the day. Simply add a few drops on a cotton ball, then wipe the face - especially the T point (forehead and nose).  For sun burn and dry skin, use a hydrating gel or serum which has anti-inflammatory and cooling properties. Apply as and when necessary.  Eyes  Avoid wearing coloured lenses. However if you must, then the only colour you may use is hazel or brown, as it enhances dusky skin tones. You are however safest, keeping the eye colour looking as real and natural as possible.  Use a cooling and cleansing eye drop (only as advised by a specialist) to keep the base colour of your eyes looking as clear and white as possible. Ensure the eyes dont look red or tired at any point of time.  Lips  Real men dont pout and theres no reason for you to do so either! Ensure your lips dont look dry or chapped. Use a bees wax or butter based lip balm at night, just before you go to bed. The lip balm will keep your lips feeling and looking soft and supple.  Smoking can make the lips look darker, than they may actually be. If you have smokers lips then use a lip buffer once a week, or as necessary to make the lips look cleaner and fresher.  Body  Trim or remove the excessive hair on your body, including your chest and arms as this will make the skin look smooth and healthy.  Use a loofah scrub to clean the elbows, knees, ankles and knuckles. Doing so will make the areas look brighter and eliminate the outer layer of dark and dry skin. To add a gentle sheen to the skin, use a water based body lotion after a bath and before you get dressed.  Sun Protection  Ultra-light sun screen for the body by Kiehls  Just as men with pale skin are prone to freckles, men with dusky or olive tone skin are susceptible to get sun spots and pigmentation marks from over exposure to the sun.  I suggest using an effective sunscreen, evenly all over the exposed areas. A SPF of 50+ is recommended. Remember, sunscreen must be applied a minimum of 15 minutes before you step out into the direct sun.  Wardrobe  Colours to wear  If you have got an olive tone of skin that tends to tan rather than toast in the sun, then you have what is known as a warm complexion. Lucky you, as this shade of skin actually suits a much wider palette of colours than those who have fair skin or a pale complexion.  The first rule with dressing to follow is to avoid matching your skin colour to the clothes, however plain and minimal you may like to style your look. If you like warm colours, ensure both the top and lower that you are wearing is distinctly different from your actual skin tone. Picking clothes that are a few shades lighter or darker than your skin colour should do the trick.  Secondly, avoid looking washed out with the shades and colours you wear. Having said that, faded prints always look good on dusky skin tones. This could be the print on a t-shirt, a shirt or any traditional or ethnic wear as well.  Shades and tones  The safest colour to match with a darker skin tone is white. White is not only my personal favourite, but also looks extremely sensual and enhances most dusky skin tones.  Earthy colours like sand, beige and creams, as well as black and grey, look beautiful on medium brown skin.  As and when you want to make a bold style statement, wear a metallic tone of copper. Gold can also look good, though it tends to be a bit over the top.  While black and blue are two key colours in any mans work wardrobe (making up the majority of formal and corporate wear), its worth keeping these to a minimum to really make the most of your versatile skin tone, which allows you to carry a wide variety of colours.  Dull hues of olive, beige, brown and mustard are always safe options. You could occasionally wear dark tones of purple, blue (navy) or even burgundy (wine red) and also pastel tones of peach and yellow.  You can also embrace most shades of blue, except very light or pastel tones. Dark and Navy blue will both look good. In fact, a navy blue suit, sports cap or clean pair of jeans will all tremendously enhance and lift your natural skin tone.  White on white  You could be in a white vest, underwear, t-shirt, shirt, pyjamas, track pants or draw string trousers and rest assured you will look good. When you wear white, ensure all the garments have the same colour pigment and are an identical shade match. Nothing looks worse that combining two different shades of white together.  For a laid back, leisure or beach inspired summer look, wear white pyjamas with a soft semi open white shirt, vest or top. If your pyjamas or pants are made with a soft breathable fabric, then ensure to wear white underwear. Coloured underwear must never be worn with see through white lowers!  Jewel tones  Burgundy dinner jacket by Blackberrys  For formal wear, you can choose jewel tones of burgundy and blue. Pair these with anything black to create a sharp evening look.  A simple and ready in a minute look would be to wear a full sleeve black top or shirt and black lowers under a jewel tone jacket, waistcoat or bandhgala.  Remember most evening looks must be complimented by a pair of black formal closed shoes.  Black and white  If you like sticking to the basics like I do, then you can never go wrong with a stark combination of wearing black and white together. This could be either a casual look or a tuxedo for a very formal occasion.  Both colours have the inherent quality of looking good with dusky skin tones and when done right can make you look (and feel) both attractive and sexy.  Accessories  When it comes to accessories, I strongly recommend you opt for a white metal look or choose between silver or platinum accessories.  Keep in mind that gold accessories can look both loud and garish on dusky skin tones. This includes your jewellery, belt buckles, watches and sunglasses.  You can try out (manly) earrings for your ears. It gives a different dimension to your face and is sure to be something that catches the other persons eye. This could be a round or square ear stud in silver or black leather.  To draw more attention to your chest, you could wear a thick silver or platinum chain (plain or inter locked) under a semi open shirt or over a sports top. I would personally suggest keeping away from rings altogether, not because of your skin tone but because rings just dont make the cut for most men!

With monsoon having arrived, many of them have already ventured out with their trawlers, trying their best to lay hands on the prized 'silver crop' -- a nonpareil delicacy that can be savoured when fried or cooked in mustard sauce.  ""As there was near-zero commercial activity in the seas and the rivers, and no industrial effluents were released into the waters during this three-month hiatus, fish breeding, which is common during this season, is bound to pick up pace.  ""Since June 14, several fishermen have set sail. The catch is expected to be higher this time, compared to the past two years,"" said Sunderban Development Minister Manturam Pakhira.  The Ganga meets Bay of Bengal near Sunderbans in South 24 Parganas district, and the confluence happens to be the breeding ground for 'hilsa', which moves upstream from the seas to the river around this time of the year.  Most of the 12,000 big trawlers in Kakdwip belt of the district are expected to hit the seas over the next few days.  ""We can give you an approximate figure of the yield after 15 days. One thing is for sure, there was barely any vessel movement during the lockdown. It reduced water pollution, and aquatic life remained largely undisturbed. So we are expecting a bumper 'hilsa' yield,"" Pakhira said.  Bijan Maity, the general secretary of Kakdwip Fishermen Association, said anything between 32,000 and 35,000 metric tonne would be considered a good catch.  ""Last year, the yield did not cross 12,000 metric tonne due to factors such as pollution and late arrival of the monsoon. We are positive this year will be different. Amid the lockdown, work such as maintenance of trawlers and repair of fishing net was put on hold. Hence, some fishermen are taking time to venture out,"" Maity said.  Claiming that several ""unscrupulous"" fishermen flout April-May ban on trawling to rake in more moolah, Maity also said that this year, however, not many could do that, in the midst of the strict restrictions in place.  This year, the fish will be bigger in size and probably tastier, he said. ""Our catch is sold across Bengal, and in other parts of the country. We are hopeful of tickling the taste buds of Bengalis amid the COVID-19 gloom,"" Maity said.  Pakhira insisted all fishermen have been told to wear masks, use sanitisers, especially when they sell their catch.  Vice Chairman of Digha-Sankarpur Development Authority Akhil Giri said trawlers have also set sail from East Midnapore district. ""Fishermen had suffered losses last year.

The tally now stands 3.43 lakh, including 9,900 deaths and 1.8 lakh recoveries. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in his opening remarks at a meeting with chief ministers and Lt Governors of 21 states and union territories, said the countrys fight with the novel coronavirus will be remembered and served as an example of cooperative federalism.  On the other hand, in a major breakthrough in Covid-19 treatment, scientists in UK have claimed that the generic steroid drug dexamethasone reduced deaths by up to one third in severely ill hospitalised patients. The results are a part of UK-based RECOVERY trial, one of the worlds largest randomised trial of drugs to treat Covid-19 patients. In the trial, led by a team from Oxford University, 2,104 patients were given dexamethasone and were compared with 4,321 patients who did not receive the drug.

These centres could be used to admit those with low-grade fever, sore throat and other mild symptoms, DSGMC president Manjinder Singh Sirsa said. The offer was made in a letter sent to Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal to set up 850-bedded Covid care centres in premises of its gurudwaras, he said.

(Source: Getty Images/Thinkstock) The number of bee colonies and the health of bees has significantly improved which is crucial for ecology and food safety. (Source: Getty Images/Thinkstock)  As the world media is flooded with photos of wild animals becoming emboldened during lockdown to stroll at heavily populated areas, insects like bees too are having the time of their life. The experts believe the drastic decrease in the air and noise pollution and pesticide-free atmosphere have kept honeybees busier resulting in an increase in honey production.  As per the Khadi and Village Industries Commission (KVIC), which is under the Ministry of MSME, the number of bee colonies and the health of bees has significantly improved which is crucial for ecology and food safety. Vinai Kumar Saxena, Chairman, KVIC, said, During the lockdown period, the quality of air improved significantly. The abundance of flora in the surrounding and a peaceful environment kept the bees busier and filled up the hives with honey in a quick time. As compared to the usual 15 to 20 kg honey collected in each bee box, the quantity rose significantly to nearly 40 kg per box during the lockdown (March-May).  He further said this trend is seen in almost all honey-producing states like Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Punjab, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, and others. As there was little pollution and almost zero use of pesticides in the crops during this period, the quality of honey also improved as bees collected pesticide-free nectar and pollen from the flowers.  Despite a lean season for honey production (mid-March to May), beekeepers swear that they have extracted almost double the amount as compared to previous years. According to Vijay Kasana, a beekeeper who has farms in Himachal Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Kashmir and other northern states, there is 30-40 per cent increase in honey production. As honeybees got a peaceful atmosphere to work, the outcome is a sheer delight. In a bee box, where 7-8 kg is extracted in one go, this time we have taken honey twice, said he.

(Source: KVIC office) Despite a lean season for honey production (mid-March to May), beekeepers swear that they have extracted almost double the amount as compared to previous years. (Source: KVIC office)  Since India has different climatic zones, therefore there is a variety of honey cultivated in India. Indian honey ranks among the best in the world. Our mustard farm honey is exported in the European market while the saffron farm honey is among the most expensive in the world, said Kasana.  The production of honey in India stood at 1.05 lakh metric tonnes in 2017-18 (source: National Bee Board). This year, it is believed to scale up.

In the last two months, without the use of medicine or extra feeding, the number of bee colonies has gone up, he said.  Honey bee production has seen a significant rise. (Source: KVIC office in New Delhi) Honey bee production has seen a significant rise. (Source: KVIC office in New Delhi)  However, there are larger benefits of beekeeping than just the production of honey. Bees are crucial for our ecosystem and food safety. According to bee expert Dr Milind Wakode, a rise in population of honeybees means an increase in cross-pollination and the resultant higher farm yield. In India, bees are primarily used for the harvesting of honey, but we underplay their major role in the pollination of fruits and vegetables. Countries like Israel have used this method to increase crop production and the world knows about their superior agricultural techniques, he said. If we maintain a clean environment, it will not only yield in productivity of bees but better quality of crops, he added.",MUSTARD OIL

But a solution must be found. The entire effect of the disruption is often passed on to consumers and they need to be protected.  KOLKATA: The Covid-19 pandemic and the resultant lockdown, then Cyclone Amphan and now a hike in diesel price have come as successive blows for citizens, forcing them to cut more corners just to stay afloat. The spike in the price of diesel, which drives buses and trucks, has had a rippling effect on the cost of living of citizens at this difficult time. While bus operators are demanding higher fares, consecutive hikes in diesel price has also caused an upswing in the prices of essentials too.Since June 1, diesel price has risen to Rs 70.33 per litre  a substantial rise of Rs 5 per litre  and is likely to affect cost of living in every aspect. The cost of operation of a truck or a bus has risen by 30% due to this. Thus, almost every commodity will be costlier. The impact on essentials, however, is immediate as people consume them on a daily basis, said Tarun Biswas, a truck operator.It is a tight-rope walk with the steady rise of prices of essentials and salary cuts. We have cut corners to strike a balance. But even then, running a kitchen is getting costlier every day. Even a small rise in prices of essentials hits us hard, said Arup Ghosh, who works with a soft-drinks bottling plant. His salary was slashed by 30%.The spike has been seen across categories, but is the most significant in case of edible oil and spices. In the edible oil market, a spike in price of one oil affects the price of another. Because of border issues, import of crude rice-bran oil from Bangladesh was affected. This left most of the refineries idle. Now the shortage of edible oil has pushed up the prices of other oils, like mustard and soya, said Biswanath Agarwal , general secretary Posta Merchants Welfare Association.If the spike in diesel rate has led to rise in prices of essentials, rising labour cost has refused to flatten the price-curve of commodities that are now easily available. The higher labour cost for loading and unloading prevented retailers from reducing price of some commodities. The wholesale price of these commodities have dipped, but that has not been reflected in retail rates, said Gobindo Naskar, a trader at Kidderpore market.The hike in diesel price has its most immediate effect on vegetables. After Amphan, diesel price is the second successive blow to vegetable vendors. The cost of transportation has suddenly jumped. Though the production has stabilized, higher transportation cost inhibited many from taking vegetables to city markets. They are afraid vegetables will be unsold and they would have to distress sell the produce, said Kamal Dey, president West Bengal Vegetable Vendors Association.",MUSTARD OIL

(File Photo) With procurement expected to continue until month-end, these numbers may go up significantly. (File Photo)  Procurement of wheat during the current rabi marketing season (April-June) has crossed 382 lakh tonnes (lt), surpassing the earlier record of 381.5 lt achieved for the 2011-12 crop.  At the minimum support price (MSP) of 1,925 per quintal, the 382.05 lt of wheat bought by the Food Corporation of India (FCI) and state government agencies so far is worth about Rs 73,545 crore. With procurement expected to continue until month-end  the Centre has set a target of 407 lt for the whole season  these numbers may go up significantly.  The procurement has taken place entirely in the post-lockdown period. The MSP money (Rs 73,545 crore) has also been paid to farmers in the last two months, a source said.  The coronavirus-induced lockdown was imposed from March 25, while wheat procurement started in Punjab and Madhya Pradesh from April 15 and in Haryana from April 20. For the first time, MP has overtaken Punjab as the largest contributor to the central pool and also delivered the highest quantity (129.28 lt) for a single season by any state (see table).  Wheat procurement till now has exceeded the targets set for MP (129.28 lt versus the target of 100 lt) and Rajasthan (19.24 lt versus 17 lt), while falling short in the case of Punjab (127.12 lt versus 135 lt), Haryana (73.98 lt versus 95 lt), Uttar Pradesh (31.46 versus 55 lt), Bihar (0.05 lt versus 2 lt) and Uttarakhand (0.37 lt versus 2 lt).  But its not just wheat.  The National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India and other government agencies have also so far procured 17.57 lt of chana (chickpea), which is worth Rs 8,565 crore at an MSP of Rs 4,875 per quintal. Out of this quantity, 16.91 lt tonnes with MSP value of Rs 8,244 crore has been bought after March 25. Further, they have purchased 7.26 lt of tur/arhar (pigeon-pea), including 2.94 lt after March 25, with their corresponding values at the MSP of Rs 5,800 per quintal amounting to Rs 4,211 crore and Rs 1,705 crore, respectively.  The entire 7.54 lt of rapeseed-mustard procurement till date, worth Rs 3,336 crore at the MSP of Rs 4,425 per quintal, has been post-lockdown.  If you take the total MSP value of the wheat, chana, tur and mustard procured by government after lockdown, it comes to over Rs 86,800 crore, the source said. Adding Rs 16,500 crore-plus direct benefit transfers made under the PM-Kisan Samman Nidhi scheme (as first installment payment of Rs 2,000 to 8.25 crore farmers for April-July 2020) would take this to well above Rs 103,300 crore.  That is the liquidity pumped into the farm economy by the government alone.  Given the need to procure the maximum possible grain from farmers and simultaneously ensure physical distancing, a conscious decision was taken to increase the number of purchase centres. Last year, we had only 1,500 procurement centres for chana and mustard, and 650 in tur. This time, we increased these to 3,190 and 930, respectively.

And those are ghee and roast, put together. My favourite dish at Saravana Bhavan  those carefree days when one could sit there and have a happy meal  was a ghee roast dosa. It was crispy, and had a delicious fragrance of ghee. And it was the thought of this aroma that drew my eyes to a dish that had the words ghee roast chicken on the menu of Fresh to Home (Freshtohome.com), a food delivery platform.  We started ordering uncooked fish and shrimps from Fresh to Home a couple of years ago. Then, some weeks ago, I saw that they had added marinated, ready-to-cook items on their menu. And there was a dish there called Tangy Chicken Ghee Roast! I ordered it, and despite being not a great fan of chicken, I loved it.  It came wrapped in the flavours of ghee and all that we had to do was to put it in a kadhai, add a tiny bit of oil and let it simmer for 10 minutes or so in 100 ml of water. We stirred it now and then, sprinkling some water when needed. And out came a delicious dish -- tangy and fiery red (thanks to the Byadgi chillies that it had been marinated with). The dish, says the app, is popular in the Mangalore-Kundapur region of Karnataka. And its certainly popular in our house.  We tried out some of the other marinated dishes, and came to the conclusion that a prawn dish that we ordered -- Gambas Con Tomates Secos Y Aceituna  deserved the crown, though the runners-up were not bad either. This was a dish of fresh shrimps in a garlicky marinade, cooked in olive oil, with sundried tomatoes, garlic, parsley, chilli flakes, sliced pitted olives and salt. Following the instructions given on the site, we let this cook in 50 ml of water, until the shrimp was done. The dish was delightful, the sweetness of the shrimp complementing the tanginess of the sundried tomatoes.  Another dish that worked well was Mutton Mince Dry Fry. It had a tomato base and a mildly sweet taste (perhaps from the peas) that I quite enjoyed. I had the keema with home-cooked rotis, freshly sliced onions and tomatoes on the side.  We also asked for Amritsari ajwaini machi pakora  a 300-g pack of sliced boneless basa, in a batter of mildly spiced besan flour and ajwain (carom seeds). This was meant to have been deep fried, but we shallow fried it. I am not a great fan of basa, though Fresh to Home usually stocks the Indian river basa (and not the Mekong one). This one didnt appeal to me much. The besan coating was a bit too thick, and I think it also lost some of its taste because we didnt fry it the way it should be done.  The rates are reasonable, but a bit erratic. I paid 279 for the 500-g pack of the Tangy Chicken Ghee Roast, though the site says it costs 245. Likewise, the 400-g mutton keema pack is priced at 700, but my bill shows that I paid 444.  Also on the menu are Coconut Chicken Curry, Butter Chicken, Chicken Cafreal, Lahsuni Malai Prawns, Honey Mustard Chicken Wings, Tandoori Chicken Legs, and something called Grannys Masala Fried Chicken.  I am going to try out Grannys Masala Fried Chicken. The word granny somehow adds to the taste of food. Quite like ghee roast!  The writer is a seasoned food critic",MUSTARD OIL

At present, maize attracts 50 per cent import duty.  Amid sliding prices of maize in the wake of the Covid-19 lockdown, the Centre has notified norms for import of 5 lakh tonnes of maize under Tariff Rate Quota Scheme during the current financial year at a concessional customs duty of 15 per cent.  At present, maize attracts 50 per cent import duty.  The move may further dampen the hopes of maize farmers, who were expecting prices to rise with pickup in demand after un-lockdown.  Maize farmers in Bihar, who account for over 80 per cent of Indias 6-7 million tonnes (mt) of annual production of rabi maize, are facing difficulties in selling their produce as prices have gone down to Rs 1,100-1,250 per quintal, much lower than Rs 2,000-2,400 per quintal last year and the governments minimum support price (MSP) of Rs 1,760 per quintal for 2019-20. The state is headed for Assembly elections in October-November.  A notification issued by the Department of Revenue shows that the government has also notified norms for import of 10,000 tonnes of milk and cream in powder, granules for this year at a concessional duty of 15 per cent under Tariff Rate Quota scheme.  The move comes at a time when cooperative dairies are saddled with skimmed milk powder stocks of about 1.25 lakh tonnes. With the lean season for milk almost ending and monsoon rains setting in, it may worsen the glut situation. Milk procurement prices, too, have come down due to collapse of demand during lockdown.  The latest decision is a reversal of the budget decision. In the Union Budget 2020-21, the government had withdrawn the concessional duty of 15 per cent applicable on imports of up to 10,000 tonnes of skimmed milk powder during a fiscal under the Tariff Rate Quota Scheme.  Under the scheme, the government allows import of four productsmaize (corn), milk and cream in powder, granules, crude sunflower seed or safflower oil and fractions thereof; and refined rape, colza or mustard oil and fractions thereofat concessional rates of customs duty.  The Centre has also allowed import of 1.5 lakh tonne each of refined rape, colza or mustard oil and crude sunflower seed or safflower oil at 45 per cent and 50 per cent duty, respectively.",MUSTARD OIL

While in India we consume the buttermilk as a beverage, abroad it is treated more as a baking ingredient. So what is the difference between the two and how to make buttermilk from scratch? If you know the right buttermilk recipe, there is no better drink like a glassful of it in summers. Yes! Buttermilk is cool, refreshing, and healthy for the digestive system and is also loaded with calcium and minerals.Buttermilk or Chaas is made with curd, water and spices. But it is considered to be better than curd because with all the benefits that curd offers, it is without the fat content of the latter which makes it even a better drink for weight watchers, diabetics and heart patients. It is a good source of Vitamin B complex, potassium and protein and much easier to digest than regular curd. It is one of the bet sources of calcium for those who are lactose intolerant.There are several ways of making buttermilk. One, which is widely popular in the west and is hugely employed in baking is where vinegar or lemon juice is added to milk, which is allowed to rest till it curdles and this is used in baking as it makes the baked goods lighter, besides giving them a creaminess.In India the traditional recipe for making buttermilk is where the curd is churned till the butter separates and the remaining liquid sans the fat content is the buttermilk. This is how buttermilk is still prepared in villages. A tadka of spices is added to the buttermilk thus procured and the drink also called chaas or mattha is enjoyed with food.But the most common way of preparing buttermilk is by adding water to curd and blending the two to make a thin, homogeneous mixture. The spices are then added to it, to get the buttermilk that we normally consume. In Bihar , black salt and roasted cumin is added to this diluted curd which is called jirwani. Heres an easy buttermilk recipe that never fails:2 cups curd2 cups waterBlack salt to tasteRoasted cumin powder-2 tsp1 chopped green chili (optional)2 tsp finely chopped fresh coriander and mint leavesTake a deep pan vessel and add curd and water. Blend well with a hand blender so that curd and water make a homogeneous mixture. You can also use a manual wire whisker. But ensure that curd and water are well blended or the granules of curd will stand out, giving it an awful texture.Now add rest of the spices and mix well. You can slip adding green chillies if you are looking at a drink to soothe your stomach. You may also add red chilli powder and give a tadka of mustard seeds and curry leaves.",MUSTARD OIL

Like any Bengali-at-heart, food consultant Iti Misra cannot stop gushing at the mention of beguni.  Beguni Ingredients  1 large eggplant (preferably the purple variety)  4 tbsps besan (Bengal gram flour)  1 tbsp oil  1/2 teaspoon poppy seeds  Salt and chilli powder to taste  Oil for deep frying  Method  Slice the eggplant length wise into  thick slices and sprinkle a bit of salt. On the eggplant slices and set aside. In the meantime mix the gram flour, oil, salt, chilli powder and poppy seeds in a bowl. Add enough very cold water to make a batter of the consistency of thick cream. Heat about 3 of oil in a karhai. Pat the eggplant slices dry on a kitchen roll. Dip each slice in the batter and deep fry a few pieces at a time. The eggplant should be a golden brown in colour. This will take two to 2.5 minutes. Drain excess oil on paper towels. Sprinkle with black salt or chaat masala.  Recipe by food consultant Iti Misra  The batter-fried eggplant fritter is a regional favourite, and  as Iti points out  as popular in home kitchens as it is in streetside shacks. The eggplant preferred is the large, purple variety, but beyond that the requirements for this treat are few. It is one of the beloved trio that Bengalis call tele bhaja (literally meaning fried in oil), along with alu chop (potato cutlet) and piyaji (onion pakora). Just dont confuse it with begun bhaja, she warns.  The West coast has its own share of monsoon nibbles. Mumbai-based Chef Aditi Kamat waxes eloquent about kothimbir vadi (recipe at end of copy), that elaborately prepared Puneri treat of gram flower, coriander leaves and spices that some simply steam and others take a step further, into the frying pan.  She readily confirms that it is synonymous with the rains, and adds, In Maharashtrian households, like in Gujarati ones, there is always an element of farsan when preparing a traditional platter. We usually have kothimbir vadi, or turaichi vadi, or aru vadi. The easiest that can be made at home is the kothimbir vadi. Especially for upvas food, this is preferred as it can be pre-made and kept.  Radhica Muthappa, who runs Bengaluru-based Curly Sue Pork with her husband, Uttam, grew up in Munnar on a plantation and the rains meant one thing: it was time to whip out the sandwich maker. It was usually a scrambled egg and cheese sandwich. When pulled pork was made at home, we would add that into the sandwich. That was the treat, she laughs.  A dish she started making after marriage and moving to Bengaluru was basale soppu fritter. That is a traditional Kannadiga dish that fries out really crisp. Its fairly tricky to make because the soppu is leathery and it has a lot of moisture. So, you have to wash it and pat it really dry, dip it in the batter and fry it. You need to be a little careful when preparing it. Its not rocket science but it does have a procedure.  Basale soppu bhajji Ingredients  50 grams gram flour or besan  1/2 teaspoon ajwain seeds  1/2 teaspoon red chilli powder  A pinch of turmeric  1/2 teaspoon salt  Method  Wash and thoroughly dry basale leaves. This step is very important, as the leaves are thick and full of moisture and unless completely dried will result in oil splattering while deep-frying. Make a batter of the above ingredients with a little water, such that when you dip a leaf in it, it should coat it. Enjoy with some coconut chutney or tomato ketchup.  Recipe by Radhica Muthappa of Curly Sue Pork  For Chef Regi Mathew, culinary director and co-owner of Kappa Chakka Kandhari, the monsoon is synonymous with bananas. During the monsoon, a lot of bananas would ripen together and many would be getting wasted. So, our mothers would sun-dry these bananas and store it. And during the monsoon, there is nothing to do at home so in the evenings, we would take these bananas, cut them into small pieces, add some coconut and paani (fresh toddy boiled for several hours till it achieves a honey-like consistency). When we didnt have paani, we would add honey. Our mothers would bring it in a big vessel and serve it in small katoris to everybody.  Stating that the pazham nanachathu gives one that warm, cosy feeling, he adds, Every time it rains, I always think to myself that this is what is missing in the evenings.  Another dish he associates with tea time during the monsoon is unnakkai. Unnakkai is steamed banana that is stuffed with a coconut and jaggery mix, made into small pods and then deep-fried, he says.  Here are a few recipes to try out:  Kothimbir Vadi  Ingredients   cup peanuts, 1 teaspoon ginger, 1 teaspoon garlic, 2 green chillies or 2 teaspoons green chillies, 1 to 2 tbsps water for grinding, 2 cups finely chopped coriander leaves,  teaspoon turmeric powder,  teaspoon red chilli powder or cayenne pepper,  teaspoon coriander powder (ground coriander),  teaspoon cumin powder (ground cumin), 1 pinch asafoetida (hing)  optional, 1 tbsp white sesame seeds, 1 cup besan (gram flour or chickpea flour),  teaspoon sugar  optional, salt as required,  cup water for batter, 1 to 1.5 cups water for steaming, 3 tbsps oil for frying  Method  Heat a tawa or pan and keep the flame to a low or medium. Add  cup peanuts. Stir at intervals and roast till the peanuts become crunchy. The peanuts skin will also have some brown-black spots on them. Transfer them to a plate and let them cool. Rub the peanuts in your palms. This will remove the flaky skin. Now, put the peanuts in a small grinder jar. Grind to a coarse powder. Remove and keep aside. In the same small grinder, add 1 teaspoon ginger, 1 teaspoon garlic and 2 green chillies (or 2 teaspoons green chillies). Add 1 to 2 tbsps water and grind to a smooth paste. Keep aside. Alternatively, you can even crush the garlic, ginger and green chillies in a mortar-pestle. Rinse coriander leaves very well. Drain the extra water and finely chop them. For the batter, take the coriander leaves in a mixing bowl, add the ginger+garlic+green chilli paste. Now add  teaspoon turmeric powder,  teaspoon red chilli powder,  teaspoon coriander powder,  teaspoon cumin powder and 1 pinch of hing (optional). Next, add the coarsely ground peanut powder and 1 tablespoon white sesame seeds. Add 1 cup besan (gram flour). Now add  teaspoon sugar (optional) and salt as required. Mix everything well. Now add  cup water in parts and mix well to make a thick batter. To steam, grease a pan with some oil. Add the batter. Bring to boil 1 to 1.5 cups water in another pan. Lower the flame and holding the pan (in which the batter is there) with tongs, keep it inside the pan with water. Cover with a lid and steam on a low to medium flame. Once done, check with a toothpick: it should come out clean. When the kothimbir mixture is cooled, gently place the entire layer on a plate. With a butter knife, loosen the edges and invert the pan on the plate. Tap the pan and unmold the layer. Now cut in square or diamond-shaped slices.  To pan fry, heat three tablespoons oil in a tawa or pan. Place the steamed kothimbir vadi and pan fry on medium flame. When the base is golden, flip and fry the other side. Flip a couple of times more and fry till the sides are crisp and golden. Place the pan fried kothimbir vadi on kitchen paper towels for extra oil to be absorbed. Serve hot or warm with chutney or sauce of your choice.  Recipe by Chef Aditi Kamat  Unnakkai  Ingredients  2 Nendram bananas (medium ripe), 1 cup grated coconut, 1 tbsp ghee, 1/2 tsp cardamom powder, 12 split cashews, 12 raisins, 1 1/2 tbsp sugar, oil to fry  Method  Steam the banana, remove the skin, mash well and keep aside. Heat ghee in a frying pan and saut the cashewnuts and raisins along with the grated coconut. Add sugar and cardamom powder to the pan and mix well and remove from fire. Apply a touch of ghee on both palms. Divide the mashed bananas into about seven to eight even-sized balls. Press the centre of each ball a little with the help of your thumb and stuff the mixture carefully inside. Make it into a spindle shape. Heat the oil in a kadai and deep-fry the unnakkai to a golden yellow colour. Serve hot.  Recipe by Chef Regi Mathew, culinary director and co-owner of Kappa Chakka Kandhari",MUSTARD OIL

So is goldsmith and miniature artist Ganesh Subramaniam's world. Most of his artworks are difficult to see with the naked eye. And therein lies their charm. Carved with unsurpassed detailing, these mustard seed-sized sculptures can be viewed only with a 12x lens. Popularly known as the nano artist of Kerala, this 45-year-old has completed around 50 miniature works. His latest piece, Escape from Covid, focuses on social awareness.  Completed in 20 days, it portrays a man equipped with sanitisers, facemask and a medicine box breaking the chain of coronavirus presented in the background. The finished sculpture sits on top of a needle. According to the artist, the chainwhich is made of goldis thinner than a strand of hair.  ""I wanted to convey the message that it is possible to stay safe from the virus by taking necessary precautions,"" he says. Apart from creating nano figurines of Hindu gods and goddesses, he has also made minute sculptures of Kathakali performers and historical figures.  What started as a hobby in 2005 with a 30mg sculpture of a boatman with his boat, soon turned into a passion for this jeweller. Though he has sculpted replicas of historical monuments such as the Taj Mahal and figures of Hindu deities, the piece closest to his heart is the Anantha Vijayam, an engraved ring with a 3mm-tall figure of Lord Vishnu.  Made in 2009 for Uthradom Thirunal Marthanda Varma, the titular Maharaja of Travancore, it remains one of his most prized creations. ""As soon as one presses a button on the ring, a lens pops up through which the idol of Lord Vishnu can be viewed,"" adds Ganesh.  The news of the ring reached Malayalam actor Mohanlal who requested Ganesh to make a similar one for him in 2010. ""Mohanlal saw the ring and asked for a Lord Shiva on his,"" he says. Following Mohanlal, quite a few collectors have commissioned the ring. Presently different versions of the ring are owned by around 12 people worldwide.  While the Anantha Vijayam is his favourite and has achieved much acclaim, what really challenged him was designing a miniature version of a functional code lock. The work holds the world record for being the smallest functioning gold chain code lock. ""It has a three-digit combination like normal locks. I could finish it only on my second attempt as a slight variation in alignment could cause the lock to malfunction,"" he says.  Ganesh dreams of some day setting up a museum of the smallest sculptures in the world. He has been conferred a doctorate from the International Tamil University, US, and is now thinking of ways to pass on his knowledge to the next generation. Ganesh has held solo shows in cities such as Hyderabad, Delhi and Chennai, but wishes now to exhibit abroad too.  With international travel restrictions set to ease, he is hopeful that things will work out in his favour. ""Special arrangements are needed to transport my miniature sculptures. Unlike a normal art exhibition, each work additionally needs a lens placed beside it to enable people to figure its original size,"" he says.",MUSTARD OIL

Amid calls for boycott of Chinese food and restaurants in India, several people are calling out the authenticity of the desi-Chinese cuisine that we relish regularly at the nearest noodle shop or a pan-Asian outlet.  City-based hospitality professional Aslam Gafoor says the Chinese cuisine available here is more suited for the tastebuds of Indians. ""One can trace back their history when they started migrating to India and having their own settlements. The recipe might be the same but the ingredients they used were different. The chillis and other spices which they started using were grown in India and tasted different,"" says Gafoor, who jokes that if one tries to serve manchurian or fried rice to a person of Chinese origin even they would not be able to relate to the food.  However, getting rid of Gobi manchurian or Schezwan fried rice from the menu might not prove to be as easy as breaking a TV set made by a Chinese brand. ""After Indian food, its the most popular cuisine among people,"" adds Gafoor.  Busting various myths about Chinese food, Vivek Salunke, co-partner of Dofu in Indiranagar, says in its home country, the flavour varies according to regions and topography. ""We have a limited knowledge about the ingredients that go into making their dish. How many of us know that curry leaves are widely used in Chinese kitchen? They also use a mix of mustard oil, sesame oil and groundnut oil,"" says Salunke, adding that enjoying authentic Chinese flavours is an acquired taste. However, chefs are trying to educate themselves to make the dishes as authentic as possible.  He also explains that just like the Indianised version, the Chuka recipes (Japanese way of making Chinese food) are also gaining popularity in Bengaluru. Also, theres no one particular kind of Chinese food available in India, says Amit Ahuja, who owns restaurants like Misu and Lucky Chan in the city.  ""The dishes prepared here are heavy on the use of soya sauce and chilli sauce. They can be categorised into two kinds  the Indianised version and the international Chinese cuisine, which is also available in places like Dubai, Tokyo and New York,"" says Ahuja, pointing out that the one stark difference is in the usage of meat.

And most of the time, we end up making extra dal which sometimes turn out to be boring. You dont have to throw away the leftover dal, you can put it to good use with these mouth-watering recipe ideas.  How about making Dal Tikki from your leftover dal? Its a perfect evening snack that you can enjoy with tea and a perfect dish to be enjoyed during the rain. To make this dish, you would need leftover chana dal, boiled potatoes, poha, green chili chop, fresh coriander chop, chopped onion, red chilli powder, roasted chana powder, lemon juice and roasted cumin powder, oil and garam masala. When everything is in place, take leftover dal and make sure there is no water in it, take the dry part, add in a bowl. Add boiled aloo, poha, and other ingredients. Make nice soft dough while mixing all ingredients well. Then make small patties and cook them on a non stick tawa or pan. Put some oil in a pan or tawa and cook the patties till it becomes crisp from outside and soft inside. Serve hot with home style green chutney or ketchup.  Another very interesting dish you can make from leftover dal is litti, which is a very popular dish in east India. Serve it with honey chilli ghee and roasted tomato salsa to relish every morsel of it. For making this you will first have to make dal dry-fry. For this you need 2 tbsp desi ghee, 4 cup leftover dal (preferred yellow lentil), 2 tbsp fine chop onion, 1 tbsp fine chop garlic,  tbsp fine chop ginger,  tsp fine chop green chilly,  tsp crushed coriander seeds, pinch of hing or asafoetida. Now, in a hot pan add ghee with onion, garlic, ginger, green chili, coriander seeds and saut until light brown. Add the leftover dal and hing and continuous stir with a wooden spoon until get dry. Make sure the heat is in medium or slow pressure and the cooking has to happen in slow method. When all the moisture evaporated then tries to make the dal mix as dry as much possible. Check the seasoning and remove from the heat and keep it aside to cool it down.  The next step is to make the litti dough. Take two cups of whole wheat flour,  tsp salt, 2 tbsp ghee , 1/8 tsp cooking soda. Add whole wheat flour, salt, ghee and cooking soda in a bowl and mix well. Add water and knead to make medium soft dough. Cover the dough and keep aside for 30 minutes.  Ingredients for honey chilli ghee will need  cup desi ghee (Warm), 1 tbsp honey,  tsp light soy sauce,  tsp synthetic vinegar, 1 tsp chopped green chili and salt to taste. In a pan, warm the ghee then keep it in a bowl and pour all the ingredients then cover it for an hour and keep it aside. Now for roasted tomato salsa, you need 8 tomatoes, 14 cloves finely chopped garlic, 5 pinches salt, 7 to 8 red chilli, 4 tablespoon sunflower oil and a few mustard seeds. Now, Heat 2 tbsp oil in a pan over medium flame, add the garlic and red chilies. Saut for 3 to 4 minutes then remove and cool. To the same pan, add the tomatoes and saut for 2 minutes. Switch off the flame. Combine the tomatoes, garlic, red chilies and salt. Grind to a fine paste, adding some water if required, and transfer to a small bowl. Heat 1 tsp oil and fry the mustard seeds for 30 seconds. Pour this over the salsa.  The final step is to assemble the litti and for that take out a large lemon sized dough and make it into a ball. Roll the dough ball to make a 4-5 inch circle. Keep 2 tbsp of filling in the centre of the dough and bring the ends together. Nicely seal the ends. Make all the lit in the same manner. Keep the litti covered with a cloth. Best to cook a litti in a charcoal fire like Bihar tradition style or pre heat an oven to 180 degrees C or take a roti tawa on a gas flame with slow heat. Bake for 20-25 minutes until browned from the top in a oven or put the litti on roti tawa then cover it fully with a steel bowl or something similar and after each few minutes sprinkle some warm water inside the bowl and then again cover it well. Flip the litti upside down and bake for another 10-12 minutes in oven or 7-8 minutes in tawa. They should be evenly browned from all the sides.

Bahadurgarh district-based state president of Haryana depot holders union Rakesh Kumar also attended the meeting and told there are about 9,600 ration depot holders in Haryana state who have not received their commission since the month of February.  The depot holders told up to the March month, they were distributing ration and depositing the amount of ration in advance after deducting their commission to the Confed (Haryana State Federation of Consumers).  But from April onwards, due to the Covid-19 outbreak, the Government of India announced to distribute free ration to the beneficiaries. We received the free ration from the agencies and distributed the same from the month of April onwards. But we have not received the commission since the month of February. The officials concerned had promised to pay the commission in time but we are now struggling to survive during Covid-19 crisis, said the depot holders.  Rakesh Kumar said, The depot holders also have families and it is very difficult to survive in these times when we have to pay from our own pockets and the government is not supporting us at all. We have to bear the rental expense of the depots along with electricity bills, and labour employed to manage and distribute the ration. In the absence of commission, it is not possible to run the depots for long in these times, therefore, the government should support us.  Rakesh told their union has given a memorandum of demand to all the concerned officials and ministers of the Haryana government.  Notably, the depot holders distribute ration under the public distribution system (PDS) to the beneficiaries of ration card holders in categories including state/central below poverty line (S/CBPL), other priority households (OPH), and beneficiaries of Antodya Anna Yojana (AAY).  As per the commission rates, the depot holders receive Rs 1.5 per kg on fortified flour, Re 1 per liter on mustard oil and six paise per kg on sugar.

Period. But chasing deadlines, and completing targets, its one of the most missed meals, too. With busy lifestyles and most professionals working from home, breakfast becomes that one meal that you just cant afford to miss! So, having a good and filling breakfast is of paramount importance. We suggest you these five quick and easy breakfast options. Take your pick:  1. Avocado on toast  Theres nothing like a good ol avocado on crusty whole wheat toast, right? You can mash or slice it as per your taste. Scoop out the goodness of the pulp, and top it up with garlic, onion, tomato, add leafy herbs, drizzle balsamic vinegar. Or just go simple with red pepper flakes, lemon, salt and black pepper, and drizzle some extra-virgin olive oil on the top.  2. Vermicelli Upma  Wheat or semolina vermicelli is super quick to make. Theres no recipe simpler then making this one when trying your hands in the kitchen. Its also one breakfast option that has many variations. Boil it and toss it with chopped onions, ginger, and add lots of veggies like carrots, beans and peas and voil, its ready! Alternatively you could also heat oil, add urad dal, mustard and cumin seeds, chillies and curry leaves. Saut these with onions and tomato pure, veggies, a little bit of water and bring it to a boil. Add turmeric powder and salt. Allow all ingredients to cook for five to six minutes.Then add vermicelli and mix well.  Avocadoes on toast are quick to prepare and taste best in breakfast. (Photo: Shutterstock)  3. Masala Omelette  Most of us have a soft corner for eggs. So, masala omelette becomes one of the choicest dishes to prepare, and also the one that can be tried with all possible variations. You could add onions, tomatoes, green chillies, coriander, mushrooms, cheese or even chicken to make it more filling. Have fun with a variety of toppings such as capsicum and boiled potatoes. Make a smiling face with tomato ketchup, and serve!  4. Porridge  You cant go wrong with porridge! A quick instant brekkie option, all it needs is a little bit of focus. Mix oats, milk, and water in a bowl, and add a pinch of salt and microwave it for about five minutes. Top it up with fruits of your choice, and then you can completely skip adding sugar. Add honey only when the porridge turns lukewarm or after it cools down.  5. Chickpea Salad  This breakfast option will keep you kicked till evening! So on days when you have long conference meetings planned over phone or web, all you have to do is right in the morning, boil chickpeas and soak some soya granules. Later, add peanuts, onion, tomato, salt and pepper, and sprinkle some chaat masala and lime juice. Give it a good toss and its ready.

Also, it is beneficial for the overall body health. Nutritionists Tripti Tandon and Preety Tyagi tell how:  Good for the heart:Mustard oil is a healthy edible oil. It is low in saturated fatty acids, high in monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), especially alpha-linolenic acid, and hence, is ideal for optimum heart health. Its usage may lower triglycerides, blood pressure, inflammation and improve vascular function  Helps in controlling diabetes: The absence of trans fat in mustard oil helps maintain insulin levels, which in turn regulates blood sugar levels.  Improves blood circulation:Mustard oil is known to stimulate our sweat glands, and thereby improve blood circulation. It also helps lower the body temperature and remove toxins from the body.  Aids respiratory system: Inhaling mustard oil helps clear respiratory congestion. Also, a concoction made by heating mustard oil, few cloves of garlic and one teaspoon of carom seeds, when massaged on our feet and chest, provides relief from cold and cough. For babies and the elderly, you can apply it on the throat, nose and chest.  Pain relief: Regular massage with mustard oil helps in relieving ache in joints and muscles. Arthritis patients also experience comfort after a massage with mustard oil, as the presence of omega 3 fatty acids helps ease stiffness and pain.  Shiny hair: Mustard oil contains alpha fatty acids that keep our hair hydrated, lively and help them to grow faster. It is also a rich source of antioxidants, minerals such as iron, calcium and magnesium, and vitamins A, D, E and K, all of which are important for hair growth. Its antifungal properties help prevent fungal infections and dandruff on the scalp.  Glowing skin: Mustard oil is rich in vitamin B complex, vitamin A, vitamin E, calcium, protein and omega 3 fatty acids. It, therefore, helps reduce fine lines and wrinkles. It also helps remove tan from the skin    P Mark presents HT City Spotlight Webinar Session: How to boost health and fitness with nutritive cooking oil (In conversation: Dr KK Aggarwal, cardiologist, Kavita Devgan, nutritionist, and Vesna Jacob, fitness expert) Date and time: July 5, 8pm onwards Live on: https://www.facebook.com/hindustantimes/",MUSTARD OIL

Nothing can beat wandering off the beaten path and enjoying the many small things that make any journey memorable. Heres what six Btown actors have to say of their vacation wheels:  Scottish surprise  Manasi Joshi Roy  Scotland, 2011, 7 days  The sound of bagpipe amid scenic beauty of Scottish highlands was sheer bliss for the Roys  Rohit (Roy, husband and actor) and I have done many road trips, but the one from Edinburgh to Glasgow is etched in our memories. Every night wed stop at charming little bed and breakfasts and then drive through the day. As we drove, we saw the topography change. We drove up Ratagan Pass to see Five Sisters of Kintail mountain range and spotted a man dressed in the traditional Scots costume, playing the bagpipes. We had to stop!  Bad weather in the Scottish Highlands led us to discover the loveliest restaurant on the Loch Lochy  One day, when the weather was pretty bad (in the Highlands, it rains 250 days out of 365), we were driving to the Island of Skye and spotted a charming lodge. Rohit insisted we stop and we were so glad we did. It had the loveliest restaurant on the Loch Lochy, serving excellent Scottish cuisine. Aah, the joy of a good, hot meal on a rainy day, gazing at a lake and mountains!  Where next? We want to explore North-East India and the Pacific Coast Highway from San Francisco to LA. The latter will happen next year, when we drop Kiara off at college.  Babymoon in Europe  Ashish Chowdhry  Italy to Switzerland, 2008, 20 days  To relive his childhood memories of family road trips, Ashish takes trips with his wife Samita now  Sam (Samita Bangargi Chowdhry, wife) was five months pregnant; we were expecting Agastya. We were excited and I wanted to make her feel special. So, I planned a trip to Italy because she loves shopping, and Switzerland for the views and relaxation. We did Rome, Venice and so on like typical tourists and then moved to Weggis, a quaint, idyllic recreational spot on the shore of Lake Lucerne. Mark Twain called it the loveliest place he had ever visited and I second that.  With my wife, five months pregnant, we found ourselves at Weggis. We later learnt Mark Twain called it the loveliest place he had visited.  As a child, I travelled with my parents to Dalhousie, Dharamshala and Patnitop. I have fond memories of those road trips. Being able to do things at your own pace is what makes road trips most exciting.  Where next? Whenever we can go, itll definitely be Denmark. I have already discussed our plans with my friend Satyadev Burman who lives there. We will stay with him and both our families are already looking forward to bonding over exciting road trips. Another most desired road trip is Leh-Ladakh. I would love to ride there.  Northern delights  Divya Dutta  Chandigarh to Sanewal and Ludhiana, 2020, 3 days  Divya enjoyed the crisp, fresh air of the beautiful countryside of Punjab  Punjab instantly takes you from rice and yellow mustard fields at daytime to courtyards filled with charpoys at night. It is home to people with large hearts and it was a longing to enjoy this with my pet dog Sakhi that drove me right into the heart of the state.  Punjab instantly takes you from rice and yellow mustard fields at daytime to courtyards filled with charpoys at night  I explored and experienced the fields, the crisp, fresh air and the glorious countryside. Nature outspread its wonders with beautiful purple flowers and silence interrupted by birdsong. I enjoyed aloo parathas loaded with safed makhan. Absorbed entirely in rustic pleasures, we returned to Chandigarh after three days with the desire to do this again soon.  Where next? I am eager to explore the route from Goa to Karnataka via the twin falls and the coastal road. I have heard the journey is beautiful and gives you captivating views of the sea from Ankola.  American dream  Evelyn Sharma  San Francisco to LA, 2016, 7 days  Evelyn rented a red convertible Mustang for her road trip from San Francisco to LA  I drove from San Francisco to Los Angeles with my best friend, Julie. We rented a red Mustang convertible and drove the scenic coastline through small, charming towns like Carmel Bay, stopping at all kinds of diners and cafs! The roads pleasantly soar up and the drive is exhilarating. It was amazing!  Where next? Tushaan (Dr Bhindi, fiance) and I drive across Australia a lot. Considering that local tourism is picking up again, we have decided to visit the most beautiful spots across the country this year and skip overseas travel for as long as we can. Im super excited to see the Great Barrier Reef!  Christmas cheer  Waluscha De Sousa  Amsterdam, Netherlands, to Dusseldorf, Germany, 2018, 2 days  Waluscha drove around Europe to enjoy the Christmas vibe  In Europe, driving in winter, especially during the Christmas season is the most beautiful road trip you can do. Everything is beautiful, decorated, festive and lit up with Christmas trees. We decided to go to Germanys famous Christmas markets at various towns along the way. It was a drive of four- and-a-half hours, but far from taxing and totally worth it.  Driving through Europe in winter during Christmas season is the most beautiful road trip you can do  The German Christmas markets are famous for mulled wine, stollen, Christmas cake handicrafts, glass-blowers, blacksmiths and woodworkers practising their trades. Its filled with Christmas cheer, carol singers and huge, beautifully lit up Christmas trees: its like the setting of a fairy tale. It was freezing, and it was a great Christmas vibe.  Where next? We live in a beautiful country, but every time I travelled here, its always been on a shoot. One road trip I would like to do is in Ladakh, just north of Leh; its one of the most motorable roads in the world and is at an elevation of 5,359 metres. There is so much to see and learn from the country we live in.  Mountain magic  Deepti Bhatnagar  North-East India, 2019, 3 months (with stops)  Deepti explored the North-East for three months on road  On a work trip that we combined with pleasure, we drove through North-East India for three months. My favourite part of the trip was landing in Assam during the Bihu festival, dancing and eating with the locals. Thats the best part of a road trip: you can stop and soak in whatever you like without an agenda.  As a wild life enthusiast, I absolutely loved Kaziranga, and I equally loved Mawlynnong, supposedly Asias cleanest village.  Where next? I am in my Goa home currently so it would be perfect to travel within and around Goa. Goa has some incredible forests. I also want to explore the Cotigao Wildlife Sanctuary and the Dudhsagar Falls.  Culture vulture  Daisy Shah  Gujarat, Maharashtra and Rajasthan, 15 years ago, 7 days  Daisy has fond memories of road trips with her dad  I have had the best road trips with my dad, driving to places like Ahmedabad, Shrinathji (Rajasthan) and Shirdi. They were always exciting: planning the route, stopping at our own will, packing extra munchies and so on.  I have vivid memories of visiting a renovated heritage haveli in Ahmedabads old city area, meeting itinerant tribes, and treating my palate to the delightful flavours of local cuisine.  Where next? As soon as its safe to step out, I would love to go to Lonavala because its beautiful in the monsoon.

To try and widen my choices, I invited anyone who had a delivery service whose food they wanted me to try to DM me on Instagram. If it seemed interesting, I said, I would try it.  As it turned out, some of the food came from places I had never heard of before the lockdown. And some of it came from places I already knew. And some from completely new establishments that had just opened. Here in no particular order, is my list of the best.  Best Pad Thai: I am always skeptical about Thai food in India because Indian chefs cook it as though it is just another branch of Indian curry cooking  which it isnt  and there are very few good expatriate Thai chefs in India.  Imagine my surprise therefore when the best Pad Thai I have had in India came from a chef who did not  as far as I knew  cook Thai food.  Jitendra Kapoors  Vikramjeet Roy is a superstar chef, well known and celebrated for his Japanese food (he started out at Wasabi) and his modern takes on Korean and Chinese food. Roy has joined hands with Anurodh Samal, in my view, the best restaurant manager in India to open Hello Panda in Gurgaon. This is a deeply personal venture. Both men are much in demand but have decided to do it alone, sinking their own savings into this restaurant.  I know Vikrams food well so I was not surprised by his sushi rolls, his dim sum or his Chinese dishes. The surprise was the Thai food: a remarkably authentic green curry bursting with the umami flavour of Nam Pla and delicious Pad Thai rice noodles with a few tweaks to the original flavour.  I will order again (and again) but the Pad Thai will remain a must try.  Best Keema Samosa: I had been to the old Rustoms Parsi restaurant but ever since Kainaz Contractor moved her operation to a new location, I lost touch. When I heard they were doing delivery, I ordered a large meal on the very day I got the menu. Almost all of the food was sensational: Dhansak, Salli Boti, Vada Pav, Caramel Custard etc. The only duff dish was a Podi Idli. (I guess if you order Podi Idli from a restaurant that specialises in Mumbai food, you have only yourself to blame.)  Keema and elements of chaat come together in the  But the dish that was so outstanding that I wished I had ordered two portions rather than one was the keema samosa. It was not your average Punjabi samosa but had a thin, crisp pastry and a deliciously-spiced keema filling. I am ordering it again tomorrow!  Best Croissant: I have written at length about Sahil Mehta before so I wont repeat myself. His baking skills are outstanding and his croissants are so perfect, you could be eating in Paris.  Best Gluten-free Cake: Caara is a brand that specialises in catering and produces high quality artisanal sauces and bread. What I did not realise was how good their gluten-free cakes were. I had an orange and almond gluten-free cake that was simply amazing.  Best Gluten-free Bread: This one is a no-contest. It is hard to find a pastry chef with the skill and experience of the Hyatt Regencys Devendra Bungla. I had asked him to create a wheat and rice-free loaf and he came up with bread that was so wonderful that the Hyatt Regency now sells it as Bungla bread.  I would find it hard to survive without it.  Best Sandwich: It is tough to deliver a sandwich without it getting soggy so I was skeptical when Anand Kataria of Big Fat Sandwich contacted me on Instagram. But Kataria and his team have found a way around that. They deliver the components to you and let you make your own sandwich. They also delivered bagels and two kinds of sour dough, some pulled pork, oriental-style pork belly and a variety of dips/sauces. I loved the bacon jam and the kasundi mustard (all available from Bigfat.in) I made delicious sandwiches with their ingredients and thought that these guys had really cracked the sandwich delivery problem.  Big Fat Sandwich delivers the components to you and lets you make your own sandwich  Best Kebabs: Jitendra Kapoor who makes delicious shami kebabs (which you fry at home) has always refused to go commercial but all of his friends hit him for regular supplies.  At some stage I hope we will persuade him to sell them to the general public; they are that good.  Best Sausages: Artisan Meats contacted me a couple of years ago on Instagram and I wrote about their products. They have sustained me through the lockdown with bacon, pancetta, pork belly, pastrami and duck confit. My favourite of their products is the Spicy Italian Sausage. It is so tasty, that I have eaten it on its own, as part of a cassoulet (with their duck confit), roasted over vegetables, paired with lentils and as part of a home-made hot dog. Their other sausages are too smokey for me but this one is perfect.  Best Burger  1. Fast Food Burger: I dont think you can beat the Burger King Whopper, served with 9mm fries that taste of potato all the way through. The chain is super hygiene-conscious and delivery is efficient.  2. Casual Burger: Akriti Malhotra is a former Diva chef who now runs two burger outlets, including one near my home. She does many kinds of burgers but my favourite is the Meister Burger, which has a mutton patty, egg, cheese and sauces, and becomes a gorgeous squishing mess that smears your face with goodness when you try to eat it. It is the sort of burger that trendy food trucks would serve in the West.  3. Gourmet Burger: Every good steakhouse in America will serve a burger made from quality ground meat, an artisanal brioche and top-class fries. The closest we ever came to that in pre-2014 India was the burger at Qube at Delhis Leela Palace.  Rustoms home delivery includes its highly addictive keema samosas  But I think we have a new winner now: the tenderloin burger at Tres, the Delhi restaurant run by chefs Julia DeSa and Jatin Mallick. Chef Jatin cant use beef so he flavours and treats his buffalo meat so well that it makes a nearly perfect burger patty. The bun is baked in-house and Jatin double fries red potatoes for the hand-cut chips.  Julia is experimenting with a burger made with the same bun but with no patty. Instead she uses her own home made Goan Chorise. Its not on the delivery menu yet but I hope she starts delivering it soon.  Best Dabeli: Sumit Gulati is part of the famous tandoori family but he and his Gujarati wife Chiquita run the Spice Market restaurant in Saket along with a cloud kitchen and cook all kinds of cuisine.  They delivered a Western Indian meal to me packed with the authentic flavours of Gujarat and Maharashtra but the single best dish was one they invented themselves. All over Gujarat, Maharashtra, Kutch (and Indore, apparently) you get a vada-pav ancestor called the dabeli, which I dont like very much.  Sette by Fratelli is a Super-Tuscan style red wine made with grapes from Akluj in Maharashtra  But Chiquita Gulati created her own version using spiced keema and combining it with the chaat-like elements of the normal dabeli (peanuts, sev etc.) It shouldnt have worked but it did  a sort of cross between keema-pav and a vada-pav. Mouth watering.  Best Dim Sum: When Yauatcha first opened in London, I used to go there whenever I could to eat the venison puff. You cant serve venison in India but the Delhi Royal China does a light puff filled with roast pork that brings back memories of the original puff. Everything I have ordered from Royal China has been good but this is the dish I crave because of the excellence of the baking.  Best Patty: A patty and a puff are cousins so my other favourite is the chicken patty from Yummies, which I wrote about a couple of weeks ago. Yummies has a well-deserved reputation for desserts. But nothing comes close to the perfection of their chicken patties.  Best Indian Wine: Most food tastes better with wine and my choice for the duration of the lockdown has been Sette by Fratelli. It is a Super-Tuscan style red wine made with grapes from Akluj in Maharashtra. Fratelli makes a more expensive wine (JNoon) but Sette is the one thats kept me going in the last few months.

No one wanted to take any chance and tried to buy enough essentials to see them through a few days, even before they knew whether their residences were in containment zones.  After nearly three months, we found a queue in front of our shop. In just an hour, half of our stock was sold out. We sold nearly 5,000kg of rice in just two hours. People are scared. No logic or past experience  complete availability of essentials throughout the lockdown  seemed to deter customers, said Anil Patra, a rice trader in Behala.  I dont want to take any risk. If my neighbourhood is included in the list of containment zones, what will I do? We dont know if mobile vendors will be allowed in or if the markets would remain open, said Debabrata Ghosh, a resident of Prem Chand Boral Street who reached College Street market at 8am.  Some vendors who had not anticipated such a rush ran out of stock within a couple of hours. Those who normally purchase two varieties of vegetables went for four to five today. They also increased the quantity they purchased. I had sold out all vegetables by 9.30am, said Afzal Molla, vegetable vendor outside College Street market.  Market committees tried to calm the buyers nerves by saying the government wont shut down supply of essentials and markets would remain open.  We are expecting a similar situation on Thursday morning, too, because people are panicking. They want to stock up their pantry for any eventuality, said Arijit Gayen, a member of the Maniktala Traders Welfare Association.  With sudden surge in demand, some retailers have also jacked up prices of edibles.  The mustard oil, which I used to buy at Rs 120 per litre rose to Rs 135 on Wednesday. Even dal and spices appeared costlier. Since we do not track the prices of these items on a daily basis, it is always difficult to say whether there is spike in price, said Alok Moitra, a Parnashree resident.  We tried to keep track of the retail prices of essentials at markets. A section of traders, though minuscule in size, indulge in dishonest practices and take advantage of the situation.

238,238.0,,,2020-07-09,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/fermented-foods-of-northeast/article32030496.ece,"Axone on Netflix has brought the fermented ingredient into the spotlight. We take a look at some more such offerings from the Northeast  Axone, available on Netflix, has left most movie-watchers seeking the answer to one question  what was the storyline about? Storyline, script aside, it is the title has got everyone talking about axone (pronounced ak-hu-ne). Many want to know more, and the adventurous ones want a taste.  But while akhune is unique to Naga cooking, fermented bamboo shoot is widely used in the entire Northeast region. Local cuisines boast of unique ways in which fermented bamboo (baah gaaj in Assamese; bastanga in Naga and soidon, soibum in Manipuri ) and cane shoots are used. Characterised by its unique pungent aroma, fermentation alters the quality and feel of the shoots and lends it a totally different texture and appearance.  Says Guwahati-based home chef Sanjukta Dutta, After it is fully fermented and ready, the bamboo shoots become mushy and delectably tangy. It is such a versatile ingredient that the mention of khorisa tenga to the people of upper Assam will have them recollect the taste and flavours of dishes like khorisa tenga maas bhaja (fish fried with fermented bamboo shoot), khorisa kukura (chicken stew with bamboo stew) and khorisa tenga ulkosu pitika (tangy fermented bamboo with mashed yam) doing a time lapse in their imagination.  Sometimes, a portion of fermented shoots are sun-dried for storage. Does it alter taste? Slightly. Especially with the look and fragrance, says Sanjukta.  A significant fermented food enjoyed by the Assamese is kharoli. Kharoli is fermented mustard seeds. When fully fermented it gives a wasabi-like pungent kick and is best enjoyed as a side dish with poita bhaat (leftover rice fermented overnight), explains Guwahati-based Chef Atul Lahkar, who also worked with Chef Gordon Ramsay during the latters travel to the Northeast a couple of years ago.  So, what is akhune?  Executive chef-partner Thomas Zacharias of The Bombay Canteen says, Akhune or axone made from fermented soybeans is one of the key ingredients used in Naga cooking which gives the cuisine an unexplainable unique flavour and differentiates it from neighbouring cuisines. I was fortunate enough to sample different variations of akhune during my Chef on the Roadtrip in Nagaland two years ago.  Chef Thomas Zacharias samples Akhune or Axone in Nagaland | Photo Credit: Chef Thomas Zacharias  Akhune is an ingredient and not a name of a dish. Such is the intrigue over it now that Chef Zac even explained the process in a detailed Instagram post. He wrote, The boiled soybeans are drained in bamboo baskets and undergo a first stage of fermentation. Some gentle mashing before it is wrapped in banana leaves and allowed to ferment over the fireplace a second time. The resulting mash is intensely aromatic and super rich in umami: that delicious, toothsome flavour profile found naturally in ingredients like truffles and seaweed. The Nagas use akhune in a variety of chutneys, pickles and stews, and most notably, in the incredible smoked pork with akhune. At the Angami home in Khonoma, we witnessed it being added to the yam stem and wild basil curry, simple unassuming stew with the most complex of flavours thanks to that funky, flavour bomb.  Why ferment?  According to Chef Zac, The origins of fermentation in Nagaland could be attributed not just to a need for preservation but also perhaps to compensate for the unavailability of salt as an ingredient here. The enhanced funky taste as a result of the fermentation adds beautiful layers of flavour to the dish which mimics the effect of salt... The Nagas ferment close to 150 different types of products, each with their own flavours and nutritional benefits.  Chef Achung of Northeast Kitchen in Hyderabad says, Apart from akhune, Nagas also make anishi  fermented yam leaves. Once fermented, it is cooked with with pork and considered a delicacy. To make anishi, yam leaves are stacked and wrapped in banana leaves. The leaves are left to turn yellow. After the fermenting process is over, the leaves are ground into a paste with salt, chilli and ginger and made into cakes which are again dried over the fireplace or in the sun.  He adds, Fermentation is one of the oldest methods of preserving food and enhancing taste. The food science behind fermentation is that it promotes growth of beneficial bacteria known as probiotics and is believed to improve digestion and boost immunity.  It is not only the people of Nagaland who are into fermentation. Fermented food of the Meiteis, inhabiting the valley area of Manipur, consists of fermented bamboo shoots, fermented fish (ngari, hentak and utonga kupsu), fermented soybean known as hawaijar, and fermented mustard seed/rapeseed (consumed by the Chakpa clan) known as hanggam maru hawaichar.  Sun-dried bamboo shoot | Photo Credit: Prabalika M Borah  Pune-based Manipuri blogger and home chef Pushpita Aheimbam explains, The process of preparation is passed down from generation to generation. Hentak is fermented fish paste made with a mix of locally found river fish which are sun-dried and powdered with an equal quantity of sun-dried petioles of hongu/alocasia macrorrhiza/giant taro as well as at times a local variety of small onion (meitei tilhou). The mixture is kneaded into small balls and kept for fermentation in an earthen pot for 15 to 20 days. Traditionally, its consumed during the postpartum period (three months) as an alternative to ngari. Hentak is not produced in large quantities unlike ngari. There is also Utonga Kupsu that is somewhat similar to hentak. It is consumed by the Meitei community of Cachar district, Assam.  Other specials  Sinki, consumed in Sikkim, is made from fermented radish taproot which is found in abundance in winter. After fermentation, the food comes out as a mass which is cut into small pieces and sun-dried for three to five days. It can be stored for up to two years at room temperature giving it periodic exposure to sunlight.  Gundruk, popular with the Nepalis, is made with mustard leaves or lai pata and cauliflower. Tungrumbai is prepared by the Khasi people of Shillong and Jaintia hills. Like axone, tungrumbai too is prepared from soyabeans. It is one of the most common sources of protein in the diet of the Khasi people, consumed as a side dish with rice.  So, the next time you discuss food of the Northeast, you will have more to talk of than alu pitika, momo and chowmein.",MUSTARD OIL

Taken aback, I mumbled a feeble no  There is a scene in Nicholas Kharkhongars Axone where a landlady screams at her tenants from the Northeast for being audacious enough to cook their stinky food, something she had specifically told them not to do. The pungent smell of axone (pronounced akhuni)  fermented soya bean  that the girls were discreetly using to cook a traditional pork curry, had reached every nostril in the building and raised a storm. This scene took me straight back to my own Delhi days years ago.  It was 2006. I was straight out of college and had landed an internship at a media house. I decided to move out of the hostel and get a place of my own. I had my carefully rehearsed lines ready in mind to negotiate the rent. But bafflingly, the first question a house-owner asked me was, No stinky food, I hope? Taken aback, I mumbled a feeble no. The broker with me felt the need to be more vociferous on my behalf. Arre nahin, she is from Assam. They dont cook all that there. Does she look like them? The house-owner gave a half-convinced nod. I turned and left.  Three days and countless such visits later to matchbox buildings in Kingsway Camp, Mukherjee Nagar, Indra Vihar and other nagars in north Delhi  which, ironically, is full of students from the Northeast who come to study at Delhi University  I finally made peace with the comments and found a place. For the first couple of months, I adhered strictly to my own rule of minimum interaction with the landlord and his extended family, including the daadi who always lay sprawling on her khatiya at the entrance of the house, keeping an eagle eye on the tenants. Trouble began when I returned after a visit back home. Packed in my suitcase, wrapped in layers and layers of polythene bags, was a bottle of khorisa.  Versatile ingredient  For the uninitiated, khorisa is fermented, tender bamboo shoot, which is widely used in Assamese cuisine  as in other parts of the Northeast  for its distinct and tangy/ sour/ acidic taste and strong flavour. The shoots are first defoliated, then pounded in a dheki (a leg-operated pounder) or scraped and ground. It is then left to ferment for about two weeks until it turns sour. Once ready, it can be used in vegetable dishes, with fish, chicken, and pork, or just pickled with oil and chillies.  Like axone, khorisas nemesis too is its smell  unabashedly full-bodied and pungent. I was not brave enough to use it. Like a thief keeping stolen treasure close to his heart, I held the bottle gingerly in my hands and then pushed it into the darkest corner of the kitchen cupboard. But the heart won over the head and like Upasana (Sayani Gupta) and Chanbi (Lin Laishram) in the film, I decided to take the risk.  And so, one fine Sunday afternoon, I dived into the mission. Ideally, I would have loved khorisa maas  fresh river fish cooked with khorisa  but settled for chicken, which also tastes divine with this magic potion.  Daring escapades  I took the usual precautions to prevent the smell wafting down the staircase. Deodorant spray cans were emptied in the rooms and in the balcony for added effect, and after what seemed like an extraordinary feat, my sister and I finally savoured the taste of success. That evening, my heart skipped several beats when the landlord stopped me on my way down the stairs to ask, Did you have a party? Perfume ka smell yahan tak aa raha tha. (I could smell the perfume down here.) I smiled and almost ran out.  I did dare to use khorisa many times afterwards. Grind it a little in a mortar, add a spoonful in curries and dal, sometimes with a dash of mustard oil, a little onion and some chilli for a lethal chutney. That momentary authentic smell  before its drowned in perfume  felt like home.  For many of the thousands of Northeasterners in Delhi, it is still a struggle to accept it as home. In 2007, the Delhi Police issued a booklet titled Security Tips for Northeast Students/ Visitors in Delhi in the backdrop of a spate of violent incidents against the community. Under Food Habits, the booklet said Bamboo shoot, akhuni and other smelly dishes should be prepared without creating ruckus in the neighbourhood. Naturally, this invited a backlash.  But life is not all black and white and despite those crude, racist remarks passed casually, Delhi has given many of us at least a couple of well-meaning Hyper Shiv pals in our lives. I have a bunch of them and hold them closely, like my bottle of khorisa.  Sunday recipe  Khorisa maas (fish cooked in khorisa)  Ingredients  4 pieces rohu fish  3-4 tbsp khorisa  1 medium-sized onion, grated  1 tsp ginger-garlic paste  1 tsp turmeric  1 tsp white mustard seed  1 medium-sized tomato, finely chopped  2 green chillies  4 tbsp mustard oil  Salt to taste  Method  1. Wash the pieces of fish and rub salt and a half teaspoon of turmeric powder on them. Keep them aside.  2. In a pan, heat the mustard oil and lightly fry the fish pieces. Take them out and keep them aside.  3. In the same pan, heat the oil and add chillies and white mustard seeds until they crackle. Add onion and ginger-garlic paste and saut it for a minute.  4. Add the rest of the turmeric powder and salt. Keep stirring.  5. Add the tomato pieces and cover with a lid. As the tomato gets pulpy, add a cup of water and cover it again.  6. As the gravy mix blends, add the fish pieces and give it a careful stir.  7. After a few minutes, add the khorisa and stir it in the gravy. Let the gravy come to a boil without the lid on.  Your khorisa maas is now ready. Ideally to be enjoyed with plain rice.  The writer is a Gujarat-based freelance journalist.",MUSTARD OIL

The flesh of a juicy jamun or a fat litchi is enough to entice anyone into stealing a bunch from the neighbours verandah. Colours of deep purple contrasting with brilliantly with orange and scarlet are a treat to the eyes. Zesty flavours of lemon and lime dance playfully on the palate. Accompanied with the crunch of greens and the nuttiness of seeds, this seasonal produce makes for the perfect salads. They are not only easy to put together but also pack a healthy punch and provide essential minerals and nutrients to combat summer blues.  A wholesome salad is a perfect way to sneak in additional nutrients in your diet. It is full of antioxidants, which help keep a check on free radicals, keeping lifestyle disorders at bay. Salads also meet our bodys fibre requirement which is essential in promoting gut health, says nutritionist Kavita Devgan.  While the heat is enough to deplete the body of its nutrients, summer also brings with it a bounty of fruits and vegetables to keep the body hydrated. The salads should have a base (sprouts or greens), a dressing (lemon/vinegar/balsamic ) and a topping (crisp nuts, toasted bread). Fruits like woodapple, watermelon, and veggies like cucumber and drumsticks are an important summer ingredient. Adding millets is a wonderful idea for that extra protein. Serve it chilled to ensure freshness, says chef Nishant Choubey.  But for those trying to avoid cold food due to various reasons, chef Kunal Kapur has a solution. I would not recommend cold salads at this time, but if you must, then I advise going the kimchi way. The pickling makes it an immunity-booster and helps aid digestion, he says. Originally made with Cabbage and Korean radish, Kimchi can be made with celery, carrots , cucumber, bamboo shoots and beetroot using chopped ginger and garlic, soy sauce, vinegar, sugar and sesame oil.  Make Salads Fun Again  Devgan suggests playing up with ingredients and adding a new item as and when one likes. Add at least one source of protein  boiled egg, tofu, cheese, lean cuts of some meat. Alfalfa and wheatgrass sprouts add a brilliant green to the bowl. Play with leaves; baby spinach, dense arugula, watercress sprigs work best, she says.  Dress it up nicely  Add a dash of olive or sesame oil to the dressing as they help in the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins, i.e., vitamins A,D, E and K. Nuts and seeds are always a good idea as they not only add a bite, but also provide omega-3 and mono unsaturated fats. Honey mustard lemon, lemon olive oil vinaigrette, and tamarind soy are some healthy dressings. To ensure the dressings last long, use fresh oil and store in moisture-proof glass jars, advises Choubey.  Here are some easy-to-make recipes that are wholesome, delicious and high on nutritional value.  Jamun Chaat  Jamun Chaat by chef Nishant Choubey.  Deseed 300g jamun.

YAMUNANAGAR: Yamunanagar police on Monday claimed to have solved the blind murder case of a woman railway staffer , who was found dead under mysterious circumstances on June 23 in Jagadhri .  The accused has been arrested.  Yamunanagar SP Kamaldeep Goyal said the accused, Mukesh Kumar, a resident of local Railway Colony, had been convicted in another murder case and was out on bail when he killed the woman.  Saroj Bala (55) of Railway Colony, a northern railway staffer at a canteen in Jagadhri Workshop was found murdered under mysterious circumstances at her allotted quarter on June 23 night.  Following on the complaint of her niece Richa Devi of Sugar Mill Colony, Yamunanagar, a case of murder was registered at Farakpur police station on June 23.  The police told during the preliminary investigation accused Mukesh confessed committing murder in an inebriated condition.  In the primary interrogation, Mukesh disclosed that he drank with his brother-in-law on June 22 night. He told that in an inebriated condition, he went towards his home on his bicycle and was over-drunk. He said he knew that an elderly woman lives alone near his house, therefore, in a bid to rob her, he trespassed into her quarter after climbing the backside wall. Upon seeing him, the woman screamed and he said he attacked her with a concrete flower pot and she fell on the ground and he again attacked her with a piece of pot. He then pulled her towards the bedroom and searched her house and found Rs 300. Following in an attempt to murder, he again attacked the woman with an iron bucket in her head several times, said Yamunanagar police.  Mukesh said he was hungry and opened the refrigerator to find something to eat but could not find anything. He pulled the womans body into the refrigerator. Then he went to the kitchen and picked up a bottle of mustard oil which he attempted to put in the private parts of the deceased woman. He stayed overnight at the womans house and at 5am he fled from the back door, further said the police.  The police said, In 2011, Mukesh was earlier arrested in a murder case when along with his friend Sandeep alias Lukka had murdered one Amit Garhwali of Railway Colony, Jagadhri Workshop due to old rivalry. In 2013, both were convicted for murder and sentenced to life imprisonment. But in 2017, he came out of jail after securing bail from the Punjab and Haryana high court.",MUSTARD OIL

His family had only boiled rice to offer.  We got free rice and wheat from the local ration shop. Now we have no money to buy vegetables and mustard oil to cook food. I couldnt even afford a packet of salt, says an emaciated Sanjoy.  Three months ago, he couldnt imagine things would come to such a pass. It is a nightmare, mutters Sanjoy, as he vacuously looks at the wetland that brimmed with fish a year ago, providing jobs to daily wagers.  Sanjoy is one of 17 migrants who returned from Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra to Moulipota village, a remote pocket in North 24-Pargana districts Deganga block, during the lockdown. As the migrant families had no savings, they had to depend on rice distributed through PDS. They are now desperate to return to their workplace.  The average wages in Andhra Pradesh are better. I earned Rs 9,500 a month and sent Rs 5,000 for my family here. Since we returned home, I havent earned a single rupee. Our daily meal means a plate of boiled rice and salt. In the last one month, we havent tasted properly cooked food, said Bijay, the only earning member in his family of six people.  Moulipota village is surrounded by wetlands where fish are reared. These wetlands are lying abandoned this year.  The owners suffered huge losses following lockdown as they were unable to sell their produce in the absence of transport. They have no money to re-start the business, said Ratan Parui, a resident of the area.  Polio survivor Sukanta Parui returned home in May from Zaveri Bazar in Mumbai along with seven others.

Dharampal Nambardar, a farmer who grows wheat and mustard seed in Haryana state, is worried he might not make any profit this year.The main source of their anxiety is not Covid-19, however, but rather a surge in fuel prices . The central government has hiked import and excise taxes twice this year even as it imposed the worlds biggest coronavirus lockdown. Retail prices for diesel -- the lifeblood of Indias economy -- in the capital New Delhi have jumped 30% since the end of April, while gasoline has risen 16%.Diesel makes up almost 70% of our operating costs , said Lamba, whose company carries everything from cotton to cement to leather goods all over India. Higher diesel prices means higher freight charges. But customers arent ready for it and we cant absorb the costs.New Delhi raised levies on diesel and gasoline in March and then again in early May as the coronavirus battered the economy. Theres been a staggering fivefold increase in taxes on diesel since 2014 when Prime Minister Narendra Modi came to power, while those on gasoline have more than doubled.Taxes on the two fuels now account for almost two-thirds of what Indians pay at the pump, making retail prices among the highest in Asia and almost double that in neighboring Pakistan. The recovery in global crude prices, meanwhile, has boosted Indian fuel costs even further in the last few months.The high prices are adding another headwind to an economy facing the biggest contraction in four decades. Diesel powers Indias trucking fleet, which carries two-third of the countrys freight, and is also essential for construction and agriculture. Gasoline, meanwhile, fills the tanks of millions of motorbikes ridden by lower-income Indians.While pump prices across the world have mostly followed the drop in oil prices since last year, India is an exception, said Senthil Kumaran, a senior oil analyst at industry consultant FGE. Its unusual to see such a steep increase in the taxes on diesel, as the fuel is deemed to be a driver of economic growth, especially in rural areas.There appears to be little chance that Prime Minister Modi will take steps to curb the rising diesel and gasoline prices even as global crude prices recover. This years fuel levy increases are expected to generate about $30 billion a year in revenue for the government, according to Bloomberg Intelligence, at a time when coffers are being squeezed by less income and sales tax and higher spending on welfare programs.The tax hike in early May is turning into a wider cost-push supply shock, reinforced by a rebound in global crude oil prices, Abhishek Gupta, India economist at Bloomberg Economics, said in a note. Thats likely to push up inflation over the next few months, he said.With industrial production still fragile as Covid-19 continues to spread in India, Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhans prediction last month that fuel demand will be back to pre-virus levels by September is looking tough to achieve.Theres already evidence that the high prices are curbing demand. Provisional fuel sales in June show that while Indias overall consumption of petroleum products was 8% lower than a year earlier, diesel and gasoline consumption were down 15% and 14%, respectively.The cost of operations has increased exorbitantly and small truck operators are unable to pass it on to the consumers because demand is low, said Kultaran Singh Atwal, chairman of the All India Motor Transport Congress, the largest such grouping in the country. Almost half of Indias truck fleet is still idle, he said.",MUSTARD OIL

Heres how you can make bread fun:  Bruschetta: You dont need to make the cliche bruschetta with basil and tomatoes. Just take a slice of bread, spread Sriracha sauce or any other sauce that you like. Add leftover vegetables over it, top it with cheese and put it in the oven. Let it bake till the cheese melts and spreads all over the bread. Sprinkle oregano and enjoy the meal.  Bread mix: In a pan, add oil, mustard seeds, curry leaves, peanuts and let it crackle. Now add chopped onions, carrots, beans and any vegetables that you like. Let it cook, add salt, pepper and red chilli. Now add toasted bread cut into small squares. Mix it well and enjoy the meal for breakfast.  Bread katori sprouts: Line the bread in a muffin mould or katori, keep it in the oven for 15 minutes till the bread cooks - becomes stiff- and takes the shape of the mould. Now inside the bread katori, add sprout chat - sprouts mixed with onion, tomatoes, salt and pepper. Squeeze a lemon and mix well- and enjoy the meal as a quick snack.  Bread Pudding: Break bread into small pieces into a baking pan. Add melted butter, raisins and walnuts over it. In a medium mixing bowl, combine eggs, milk, sugar, cinnamon, and vanilla. Beat and drizzle over bread. Bake in the oven for 40 minutes, pour on top some maple syrup, add chopped fruits and serve.  SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON",MUSTARD OIL
245,245.0,,,2020-07-16,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/more-with-less-how-to-minimalise-waste-while-cooking/article32102799.ece,"As we focus on mindful living and eating during lockdown, its a good idea to pay attention to minimising waste too  Three months into lockdown, many of us have learnt a few valuable lessons. And the lessons learnt from our kitchen are here to stay.  With families huddled together, children attending online classes and parents working from home, there has been more cooking in many households. Naturally, the waste generated in those kitchens are also of higher volume. Minimal food wastage has to be our focal point, especially these days when the aim is to get by with a few essentials.  Chennai-based cookbook author Usha Prabhakar says that this is the right time for families to learn to lead a frugal life, and be aware and mindful of how to put kitchen waste to best use. In her book Ushas Pickle Digest, published in 1998, Usha had dedicated a section for pickling peels and leaves. We generally discard orange and lemon peels, unmindful of the fact that they are actually loaded with nutrients and various other vital minerals. The stem of the cauliflower is rich in sulforaphane, a plant compound with many beneficial effects, says Usha.  Lemon Peel Pickle Ingredients:  Lemon peel pieces 250 grams  Salt 100grams or to taste & make a solution with 3 cups (600 ml) water  Black salt: 5g  Cumin seeds: 10g dry roasted  Method:  Combine the lemon pieces with the salt solution. Stir in the black salt. Sun the mixture for 5 days. Stir in the roasted cumin and set aside for a day. The pickle is ready for use. It lasts for 1 month. Sun occasionally. Use regular coarse salt in the absence of black salt, though black salt gives the pickle its characteristic sulfurous smell. Recipe by Usha Prabhakaran  Jeyashri Suresh, a Hongkong-based food blogger, says that even though she does not use vegetable peels to make any dish, fearing pesticide deposits, she does pay attention to reducing waste. She collects the centre, hard portion of the cabbage and unused portions of various vegetables, boils them to make vegetable stock, and this broth is used to make lemon coriander (using only the stem portions) soup.  We can also make bread soup with the trims of bread slices. When I steam raw plantain to prepare a dish called vazhakkai podimas (a dry curry with raw banana), I use the peel to make a delicious chutney. Recently, I got to know of a thogayal recipe that uses snake gourd pith, Jeyashri says.  Septuagenarian Gita Rajamani says that food wastage is something every family needs to pay attention to, and cook lesser quantities than required. Avoid hoarding and stocking up. Best is monthly planning. If you end up buying more, preserve them by placing dried neem leaves wrapped in a clean cotton cloth while storing lentils and place Vasambu (Acorus Calamus) sticks in rice containers. During my childhood, when there were no refrigerators, we hardly wasted any food. If sambar, rasam and other preparations were left over, they were mixed together, heated on a fire woodstove and left there overnight and in the morning this Erichakulambu was mixed with rice and gingelly oil and served as breakfast, she reminisces.  Green platter  For food blogger Sharmila Ribero, collecting cauliflower stems, broccoli stems and all other stems and peels of vegetables and making a broth or stock is a routine these days. This broth is used as soup base. This is not only delicious but also nutritious. Similarly, we can use coriander stems and roots for chutney or gravies. I grind coriander and mint leaves into chutney and freeze and use.  Sharmila suggests that families grow greens and herbs. Basil, curry leaves, mint and coriander can be grown even in balconies. Growing microgreens using fenugreek and mustard seeds is even simpler. You can sow them in shallow trays in the kitchen and the harvest could be used in raithas and salads.  Blender composting  Organic waste generated in our kitchen can be put in a bin for composting, but this method takes many weeks and those who live in apartments may find the process difficult. Moreover, it is not easy to maintain it stench-free.  Which is why I recommend blender composting, a fantastic way to make use of kitchen waste to create your own nutrient-rich soil, says Usha.  Plantain peel thogayal Ingredients  1 raw plantain  3 tbsp curd  A small piece of tamarind  7 pods garlic  4 green chillies  A few sprigs of coriander leaves  1 tsp cumin seeds   tsp turmeric powder  Salt to taste  Method  Grind together all the ingredients raw. No need to roast any of them. Mix it with hot rice and a little ghee. Recipe by Jeyashri Suresh  It is a process of blending organic kitchen waste such as vegetable and fruit peel, egg shells and coffee grounds. But avoid dairy products (they will hinder the composting process) and meat as it might attract rodents, she cautions before moving on to further details: We blend the waste with water, in about one-fourth of the blender, to create a pourable liquid that can be fed to plants directly, she adds. This mixture can be poured directly around the roots of big trees or poured in a pot with mud and allowed to compost.  Blending significantly hastens the decomposition process: it takes less than 10 days to decompose, and there is absolutely no foul smell.  With gardening gaining popularity during lockdown, this is a fast and efficient way to enrich the soil.  Blender composting is convenient for apartment dwellers who want to make use of organic waste, but do not have the set-up to build a full-blown compost bin.  Yet, they can create their own homemade organic compost in days instead of weeks, adds Usha.",MUSTARD OIL

The 43-year-old is an ambulance driver with the Delhi governments Centralised Accident & Trauma Services (CATS). As the numbers surge and focus shifts to preventing deaths, ambulances are more crucial than ever in the coronavirus fight. In end June, at a meeting the Centre held with states, the time taken for patients to reach the hospital and the call refusal rate of ambulances were recognised as key aspects in keeping fatality rates low.  Noon: At their base, a footpath under a Metro Station in East Delhi, Bahadur, Roshni wait for their next call. Noon: At their base, a footpath under a Metro Station in East Delhi, Bahadur, Roshni wait for their next call.  With Delhi the worst-hit city in the country, and India at third highest in Covid-19 caseload in the world, the Central and state governments have been stressing on increasing ambulance strength. The Supreme Court, Delhi High Court and NHRC have all taken up the matter, responding to cases, reported from across the country, of patients collapsing while waiting for ambulances.  With 17,407 active cases, 3,729 of them in hospital, as of July 16, Delhi currently has approximately 602 ambulances. CATS has nine Advanced Life Support (ALS) ambulances, 142 Basic Support Ambulances (BLS) and 109 Patient Transport Ambulances (PTA). Besides, 154 ambulances have been converted to dedicated Covid-19 ambulances, while about 200 Ola and Uber cabs have been roped in to ferry non-critical patients. Private hospitals and institutes have their own ambulances.  The Centre has assured 650 more ambulances in Delhi, while the state government has declared plans to double the number.  Bahadur pilots a BLS, which is equipped with a stretcher, two five-litre oxygen cylinders, a first-aid kit, medicines for stabilising heart attack patients, and kits to carry out deliveries. While his is not a Covid ambulance, Bahadur says he has been attending only coronavirus calls for the past few months.  Bahadur is aware of the case of Ganesh, a 22-year-old ambulance technician who died in distant Tirupur, Tamil Nadu, on June 24, soon after he tested Covid-positive. He is also aware that, among all the frontline staff helping tackle coronavirus, the ambulance drivers are among the least celebrated; Ganeshs death lost almost as a footnote.  Bahadur has been tested seven times each time after his PPE kit tore or he came in direct contact with a suspected case. The tests are organised by his employer, GVK-EMRI, the private firm that holds the contract for CATS ambulances in Delhi. GVK-EMRI was also Ganeshs employer.  3 PM: At LBS Hospital. Roshni put on her PPE inside the ambulance; its tough for ladies, she admits. 3 PM: At LBS Hospital. Roshni put on her PPE inside the ambulance; its tough for ladies, she admits.  Fortunately I have tested negative, Bahadur says, adding, The Tirupur guy must have kept a poor diet, or been careless.  So, apart from PPE (he usually has four-eight sets in his ambulance at all times), Bahadur takes several precautions of own, like breathing in mustard oil fumes before leaving home, drinking giloy juice, having only boiled water, that he carries with him, and using lots and lots of sanitiser.  Roshni banks on kadha and lemon water for breakfast. She started working as a paramedic only a month ago and her duties include patient evaluation, emergency care, safe transportation, and paperwork.  While she admits she never expected to find herself in the middle of a pandemic, the 24-year-old adds, There are quite a few women paramedics on ambulance duty now.  However, she adds, I have never been tested.  ***  Around noon on a hot, muggy Wednesday, Bahadur and Roshni are sitting on a rug with two fellow pilots and paramedics at their base  a footpath, under the Vinod Nagar Metro Station in East Delhi.  Bahadur uses the break to place request for supplies at a CATS call centre over the tablet provided to him by CATS.  4 PM: Once Bahadur and she have got a Covid-19 patient to GTB Hospital, Roshni gets the paperwork done. 4 PM: Once Bahadur and she have got a Covid-19 patient to GTB Hospital, Roshni gets the paperwork done.  Earlier, they would take their breaks in a room at LBS Hospital. But we had to vacate it as we were accused of leaving behind PPE suits. Thats not true. Because of the heat, we take off the suit the moment we drop a patient. We dont wait to get to the base.  A driver with the East Delhi Deputy Commissioners Office earlier, Bahadur joined GVK EMRI last year. He is on call 12 hours a day, with working hours stretching beyond. In a month, there is a fortnight each of night and day shifts, and both Bahadur and Roshni get two days off a week.  With response time of ambulances under scrutiny, Bahadur says, It can take 10 minutes to an hour, depending on distance and traffic. After every assignment, they drive the ambulance back to the base for fumigation, which takes an hour. With seven-eight Covid cases coming his way in a day, this means he ends up driving at above 100 km/hr, with traffic rising post-lockdown.  Bahadur says he left his previous job to give his brother, a kidney patient, more time. Now I schedule his dialysis when I am off work.  7 AM: Apart from PPE, having kadha and lemon water for breakfast is among the many precautions that Roshni takes to keep herself safe 7 AM: Apart from PPE, having kadha and lemon water for breakfast is among the many precautions that Roshni takes to keep herself safe  To support his family of 10, including three children who go to private schools, Bahadur does other small jobs on his off days, like AC repair or bike and car servicing. My salary of Rs 17,000 per month is not enough.  Roshni worked as nursing staff at a private hospital earlier, but her family was uncomfortable with her late working hours. I always wanted to do something in the medical field. So I completed a six-month Emergency Medical Technician course last year and applied for job as a paramedic, she says.  With her father disabled, her salary of Rs 17,000 every month helps run the seven-member household.  ***  Its been a busy morning, with Bahadur and Roshni having transported first a 35-year-old Covid-19 male patient from Vinod Nagar to LBS Hospital and then a pregnant 19-year-old to Jeevan Jyoti Hospital in Dilshad Garden. The Covid case didnt need any medical aid, but they had to carry the 19-year-old on a stretcher.  Smiles Bahadur, We were lucky she lived on the ground floor. A few days ago, I had to carry a 90-kg man along with an oxygen cylinder to the ambulance down from the fourth floor. His wife made us park the ambulance far from the house because she didnt want the neighbours to know. It took nearly four hours to complete the job.  Despite her petite frame, Roshni often helps Bahadur carry patients.  There are other problems as well they are facing for the first time. Recently, a Covid-positive couple being taken to GTB fought that they didnt want to go to a government hospital, Roshni says.  Raju, 40, who works for a private ambulance service running out of Jamia Nagar, is apprehensive about the people, including dead, he has been transporting. I suspect many of them are coronavirus positive Raju, 40, who works for a private ambulance service running out of Jamia Nagar, is apprehensive about the people, including dead, he has been transporting. I suspect many of them are coronavirus positive  They attend to three kinds of calls  from government hospitals, from the District Surveillance Officer (DSO) assigned to monitor coronavirus cases, and from individuals. While patients may choose to go to private hospitals, often the DSO or a hospital tells them where to take the patient.  Bahadur talks of the initial months, April-May, and driving around with a 45-year-old Covid-19 patient between hospitals, which refused to take him. As coronavirus patients are on their own, without relatives, often he and Roshni have to intervene. The patients oxygen levels ran low, but losing his cool, he got off and started walking. I ran after him and called the DSO to find a bed for him, he says.  Another time, Bahadur says, a hospital demanded that a TB patient show a Covid-free certificate. Where would he get that from? he says. I took him back home.  Things are more settled in the Capital now, Bahadur adds. Earlier, we did not know what to do if a hospital refused admission. There were fights with security, nurses, hours spent in PPEs. So we collected the numbers of DSOs of our zones. We now call them up directly.  A source in CATS said while vehicle numbers are almost sufficient now, getting patients admitted remains a challenge. We have to often call up the CMO (Chief Medical Officer) or the CDMO (Chief District Medical Officer).  T V S K Reddy, Vice-President at GVK EMRI, said, We have brought in vehicles from Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Kerala. We now have over 240 ambulances on the road in Delhi on Covid duty. We have also hired more drivers, from 600 earlier to 780 now. Our average response time has reduced from 55 minutes to less than 30 minutes.  Bahadur sanitises shoes before entering his home, doesnt meet his family. Bahadur sanitises shoes before entering his home, doesnt meet his family.  A senior Delhi government official on Covid duty said they had set up a dedicated war room to ensure that every patient with escalating symptoms was able to reach hospital in time. In the first week of May, CATS ambulances catered to an average of 576 calls a day with patient handover time of 4 hours 28 minutes per Covid call. In the first week of July, the CATS service catered to an average of 890 calls per day with patient handover time of 2 hours 49 minute per Covid call, the official said.  What worries Bahadur more than anything is the stigma attached to coronavirus. When I was little, we were so poor, we would go days without meals. I need to earn a living, thats all I know I at least have a job in these times he says, and so back in his neighbourhood, a majority of the people believe he still does his old job. I chose the East Zone, so that they dont come to know.  While Bahadur rides his motorcycle to the government hospital where the ambulance is parked when not on call, Roshni now uses an autorickshaw to get there from her home in Mayur Vihar in East Delhi. One night, she says, as Bahadur was dropping her home after their shift, neighbours confronted her. They refused to let me get out, said bacteria fael jayega (You will spread the bacteria).  Her family is supportive and has been taking all precautions to avoid direct contact with her. We have a three-storey house. I stay in the single room on the ground floor and have hardly met anyone in a month. We use hot water to bathe and drink warm water.  ***  On the other end of the spectrum are private ambulance drivers such as Raju, 40, with little safety net. Till two years ago, he used to drive tourists to Kedarnath. He became an ambulance driver, he says, as it ensured a guaranteed salary and now works for a private ambulance service running out of Jamia Nagar for Rs 15,000 a month.  4.45 PM: Sweating, Bahadur, Roshni dispose of PPEs. They avoid drinking, eating from outside. 4.45 PM: Sweating, Bahadur, Roshni dispose of PPEs. They avoid drinking, eating from outside.  Thats barely enough to support his wife and four children, the youngest 10, Raju says. Now, he is apprehensive about the people, including dead, he has been transporting, often to other states. I suspect many of them are coronavirus positive  I wear mask, gloves, use sanitiser, what else can I do?  Recently, after he had ferried a family to Uttar Pradesh from Delhis Safdarjung Hospital, he found himself stuck at a quarantine centre near Gorakhpur for two weeks. Some security people told me a person I had dropped was Covid-positive.  Philosophical, Raju adds, When death has to come, it will. Near my home in Okhla, people turned their backs on a Covid-19 patient, but I went and offered him food. We cant be scared.  ***  Around 2.30 pm at the base, Bahadur receives a call to transfer a Covid-19 positive pregnant woman from LBS to GTB Hospital. Both Roshni and he avoid eating while on duty, mainly due to santisation concerns. They don gloves, figure out the case details and get on the ambulance.  At LBS Hospital, Bahadur steps out of the ambulance to don the PPE. Roshni changes inside the van. Ladies ke liye tough hai (its tough for women). I wear the suit over my clothes but it still feels like I am changing in public, she says.  As the Covid patient arrives, the two get her details from a nurse, reconfirming that the GTB Hospital will admit her. Otherwise, we will spend hours arguing, says Roshni.  As they set off, already sweating profusely after a few minutes in the July humidity, Bahadur notes, We have been getting a lot of pregnant patients. The traffic is light, and they cover the 10-km distance in 20 minutes.  Having ensured that the patient has collected everything she is carrying, Roshni escorts her to the Covid ward. She gets in touch with the nursing officer and completes the paperwork before handing over the patient.  Bahadur regrets having left his bottle of boiled water back at the base. I will drink water once I get back, he says, relieved to see Roshni returning soon. Paperwork jaldi ho gaya, she tells Bahadur, as the two rush to remove their PPE.  There are other assignments that day, one of them entailing a trip to a government hospital in Tughlakabad, 20 km away, which takes so long that the patient leaves for Lok Nayak Hospital on own. He hired a private service. Such patients complain later that the ambulance didnt arrive, Bahadur says.  Its around 10.30 pm that he gets home, finding his children already asleep. Ready to pass out, he says, Fortunately, I dont have to take my brother to hospital today.  Reaching home around the same time, Roshni says her biggest regret is not cuddling up to her niece. A quick meeting with her mother later, she will settle for the night. She never had time for habits such as watching movies, the 24-year-old says, and is grateful for this now. I just want to sleep.",MUSTARD OIL

All of these are known to be effective immunity boosters and are also anti-inflammatory, she says in a video.  Keep allergies at bay: Warm oil massages with sesame oil or mahanarayan oil before bath are helpful in avoiding allergies during this season, suggests Delhi-based Ayurveda consultant Dr Tarun Gupta. He recommends staying hydrated through the day by sipping boiled water with dried ginger, and adds, Nasal drops of mustard oil are also proven to counter all infections.  Binge on citrus fruits: Fruits are the gateway to better immunity as they are a powerhouse of fibre and nutrients such as vitamin C. Apples, guava, amla, orange, berries and pomegranates  add any or all to your diet for more energy and vitamins, adds Dr Gupta.  Homemade cough lozenges: To avoid having an itchy throat, make medicinal tablets at home. Some of the easiest recipes use powdered cloves, lime juice, ginger and amla. Boil these and honey or sugar after switching off the burner. Then pour drops of the liquid in a pan so as to make tablets.  A cuppa a day: To make your daily beverage an immunity booster, simply add a spoonful of turmeric to tea. This root spice has antioxidant properties while being antibacterial and antifungal in nature. Infusions made with tulsi, black pepper, ginger and amla are great for bolstering immunity, says Tanuja Sodhi, a Mumbai-based wellness expert.  Ghar ki Khichdi: During monsoon, prefer eating fresh home cooked food to avoid any infections. Consuming light and fresh foods prepared from barley, rice, or moong dal and having a small piece of ginger with rock salt before every meal are some quick and effective ways to boost your immunity naturally without much effort, says Akanksha Mishra, a Delhi-based food and nutritionist.  Two word mantra - sleep and exercise: You need to sleep for 7-8 hours a day because a good sleep is therapeutic and helps the body recover from the days exhaustion, adds Sodhi.

According to the daily flood report of the Assam State Disaster Management Authority (ASDMA), one person died at Sonapur near Guwahati in Kamrup Metropolitan district.  The total number of people losing their lives in this year's flood and landslide has gone up to 111 across the state, of whom 85 people were killed in flood-related incidents and 26 died due to landslides.  The ASDMA said over 24.3 lakh people are hit due to floods in Dhemaji, Lakhimpur, Biswanath, Darrang, Baksa, Nalbari, Barpeta, Chirang, Bongaigaon, Kokrajhar, Dhubri, South Salmara, Goalpara, Kamrup, Kamrup Metropolitan, Morigaon, Nagaon, Golaghat, Jorhat, Majuli, Sivasagar, Dibrugarh, Tinsukia and Cachar districts.  Goalpara is the worst hit with over 4.59 lakh people suffering, followed by Barpeta with more than 3.37 lakh people and Morigaon with around 3.35 lakh people.  The State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF), district administrations and local people have rescued 291 people during the last 24 hours by deploying 125 boats across the state, it said.  Till Sunday, more than 25.29 lakh people were affected due to the deluge in 24 districts.  The Regional Meteorological Centre has forecast rainfall at most places of Assam and Meghalaya on Tuesday with heavy to very heavy downpour along with extremely heavy rainfall at isolated places.  Meanwhile, Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal visited the Gohinpara area affected by flood of the Pahumara river in Barpeta district and took stock of the damages there along with flood ravaged Doul Gosain Than (place of worship) and Bamkhata-Kenduguri road.  He directed the Water Resources minister to find a permanent solution of the perennial flood and erosion in the area after carrying out a scientific study of the Pahumara river, an official release said.  ""He also asked the departments of agriculture, DRDA (District Rural Development Agency) and soil conservation to erect agricultural embankments after consultation with the Water Resource Department,"" it added.  Later talking to reporters, Sonowal said that flood and erosion have been causing devastations every year in the state as nearly 9,000 hectares of lands are claimed by erosion every year.  He told reporters that the central government will take up the flood issue with neighbouring Bhutan, from where floodwaters come down every year to cause havoc in the state.  The chief minister said that the deputy commissioners of all districts have been directed to ensure availability of relief material, medical facilities and cattle fodders for the flood affected people.  He denied the accusations made by opposition parties that flood affected people have not received any relief material as ""completely baseless"".  Later, Sonowal visited the flood relief camp set up at Dakshin Barpeta Bidya Mandir High School at Barpeta town and interacted with the inmates there about the facilities provided to them.  At present, 2,254 villages are under water and 1,09,600.53 hectares of crop areas have been damaged across Assam, the ASDMA said.

And to ensure it happens, you have to workout, whether you like it or not. That's the only effective way to burn more calories. However, if you lead a sedentary lifestyle, the process of weight loss becomes even more challenging.We know that being overweight can be a window to several kinds of health issues like cardiovascular problems, type 2 diabetes, so it is essential to maintain healthy body weight. To help you cope up with this issue, Dietitian and Clinical Nutritionist, Lavleen Kaur shares some tips to shed kilos in a sedentary lifestyle.Portion control plays a major role when it comes to shedding kilos. You have to eat a limited amount of calories in a day, to achieve your weight loss goals. When we overeat, all the extra calories are stored in our body as fat. Lavleen advises filling your plate with only 80 per cent of food. Furthermore, it is important to be mindful about the food you are consuming. Chew your food slowly and listen to your body.Dr Lavleen adds that people attempting to shed kilos should avoid all kinds of processed foods like refined oil, white sugar and salt. These should be replaced with more nutrient-rich food items. Replace sunflower oil and canola oil, with mustard oil, desi ghee, virgin olive oil and coconut oil. Jaggery and honey can be excellent alternatives for white sugar. Use rock salt in place of refined salt and instead of all-purpose flour (Maida), consume whole-grain food like Pearl Millet, Sorghum, Barley.We pay a lot of attention to our carb and protein intake, but often overlook the number of micronutrients in our food. Consuming enough micronutrients is very important to stay healthy. Micronutrients are vitamins and minerals, which enhance body's fat-burning capacity. If your goal is to shed some kilos then increase intake of Vitamin D, Vitamin B12 and Calcium.We all turn to a cup of coffee when dealing with the afternoon slump. But consuming too much coffee can sabotage your weight loss goal. Having more than two cups of coffee in a day can lead to dehydration. This, in turn, can cause constipation, migraine, acidity, making it difficult for your body to shed kilos. You cannot lose weight when your body is not fit from inside.No matter how busy your schedule is, try to move your body even for a few minutes. If you have a sitting job, then move for a few minutes after every hour. This will help you to torch some calories and shed some kilos.The nutritionist said that people must not forget that weight loss is a by-product of dietary modifications and a healthy lifestyle. And a healthy lifestyle includes your sleep schedule, stress level, water intake and screen timing. ""So, it is equally important to improve your lifestyle. Once you do it, your body starts repairing itself and will release good hormones. This will help you shed kilos,"" she added.",MUSTARD OIL

Choose from a variety of fruits and vegetables to get your daily dose of vitamin C. Plus, some interesting recipes to help you along!  Say Vitamin C and you almost immediately think of oranges and lemons. But did you know that a single red guava has over 200 mg of the nutrient in 100 grams, which is almost over thrice as that in an orange. You get just about 64 mg from 100 gm of orange and 48 mg from 100 ml of lime juice according to the Indian Food Composition Tables.  Vitamin C, also called ascorbic acid, is a water soluble vitamin that helps to improve immunity, aids in the synthesis of collagen (skin protein), and production of certain neurotransmitters (the bodys chemical messengers). It is not stored in the body and requires daily intake, says Bengaluru-based Dharshini Surendran, dietician.  Guava | Photo Credit: Sreejith R Kumar  While 100 gm of gooseberry provides 247 mg, others like bell peppers (yellow, red, green: 120 mg), bitter gourd (50 mg), and raw mango (50 mg), can also provide the vitamin. Though its not possible to eat 100 gm of chillies, its good to know that they contain 90 mg of the vitamin.  The daily Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) of Vitamin C for adults is 65 to 90 mg per day. We need Vitamin C to help in the absorption of iron from food, says Gayathri V, a dietician based in Kochi. A balanced diet, for example dosa or idli and sambar with seasonal vegetables for breakfast; a lunch platter of rice, green vegetables, and dal; a guava or papaya for dessert, ensures that you not only get Vitamin C, but also carbs, proteins, and fats.  Green pepper / capsicum | Photo Credit: Sreejith R Kumar  Avoid caffeine as it inhibits Vitamin C absorption, stay hydrated, and cut down on meat, especially after you consume Vitamin C rich foods, advises Pradeepa Saravanan, dietician based in Coimbatore.Include at least one serving of fresh fruits and vegetables per day in your diet. For example, a papaya salad with pomegranate, bell peppers, or banana. Vitamin C evaporates when exposed to heat, thats why I recommend consuming 500 mg every day, not just during the pandemic but for life, to make up for the nutrient loss while cooking.  One way of starting your day with a Vitamin C shot is to churn either three or four amla (gooseberries) or half a bitter gourd in the mixie with a handful of coconut bits and a jaggery to taste (nothing over a tablespoon). Mix with a little water, strain, and drink on an empty stomach.  Here are a few recipes, courtesy Dharshini Surendran, to help up Vitamin C levels:  Capsicum thokku  You can add diced capsicum to pasta or salad, or try this pickled version.  Green pepper / capsicum | Photo Credit: Sreejith R Kumar  Ingredients:  2 capsicum ( any colour diced into pieces)  1 tomato  1 onion  1 tsp tamarind pulp  1 tsp urad dal  1 tsp coriander seeds  1 tsp jeera  3 red chillies  Himalayan Pink Salt to taste  Method:  In a pan, dry roast the coriander seeds, urad dal, jeera and red chilli. Add the chopped onion, tomato and saute it well. Add the sauted onion, tomato, and dry roasted mix in a mixie jar and grind well. Add tamarind pulp.Finally add the salt as per taste and capsicum pieces and grind once again into a fine paste. This can be eaten along with rice, roti or dosa.  Sweet potato balls  Ingredients:  Sweet potatoes | Photo Credit: Sreejith R Kumar  2 sweet potatoes (boiled)  2 handful of green gram sprouts  1/2 handful of grated raw mango  1/2 handful of grated carrot  1 onion finely chopped  2 tsp pepper powder  Salt as per taste  Method:  Peel the skin of sweet potato and mash it well. Add the green gram sprouts, carrot, raw mango, onion and mix well. Finally add salt and pepper and make into balls. As the potatoes are already boiled, it can be had directly. No need to bake.  Orange Rasam  Store green chillies in a cool, dark area, because chillies lose their Vitamin C when exposed to heat, light, and air.  Oranges | Photo Credit: Sreejith R Kumar  Ingredients:  1 cup orange juice  1 tbsp moong dal (soaked and boiled)  Chopped coriander leaves (for garnish)  1 tsp lemon juice  1 orange rind (grated)  3 slit green chillies  A few curry leaves  1 tsp mustard seeds  1/2 tsp asafoetida  Himalayan pink salt as per taste  1 tsp of cold pressed sesame oil cold pressed  1tsp rasam powder (optional)  Method:  In a pan, add 1 tsp sesame oil and season it with mustard seeds, asafoetida, and curry leaves.

The sleeves have TikTok TikTok running along their length.  These are new clothes, I bought them just yesterday, he says, blushing. The only old thing hes wearing is his checked gamchha, that he has stylishly knotted about his pants like a loose belt.  Pappu is a daily-wage labourer and this morning he is walking through a central Delhi market, on his way to a building contractor who owes him 4,000.  And theres another person in Gurgaon who has to pay me 5,000 for the work I did some months ago. Ill have to go there later this week.  In the pre-corona days too, builders and contractors would occasionally delay paying their workforce, Pappu informs. But this tendency has recently started to become more common. He blames it on the extraordinary situation triggered by the coronavirus pandemic. There is less money in the market, haalaat (conditions) are not good, and contractors dont have much cash at hand.  Whatever, he is refusing to be patient any longerIll soon be leaving for home. Pappu reveals his plan with a big smile, referring to his native place in Madhya Pradesh. In his late 20s, he has been in Delhi for about a decade but its tough to find work these days... so Im going back to my village.  Pappus family includes his father, and his brother and sister-in-law. I got the new clothes because I want to look nice when I meet my people.  He shopped for them the day before in Sadar Bazaar. The pants came for 200 and the shirt was more expensive, at 250. The last time he had bought new pant-shirt was two months ago but they are in tattered condition... I was using them as my work clothes.  Pappu doesnt plan to spoil the new dress, and is putting it on just for today for masti (fun). He will wear them next only for his journey home though he isnt sure of the exact date of the return. It will be as soon as I get all my dues. He plans to stay in the village for the next few months, working in his familys agricultural field. We get enough produce from our land to feed ourselves well.  If so, why has he been living in smoggy Delhi, working as a labourer and sleeping on the pavement?  Pappus face becomes sombre, maybe he is gathering his thoughts. A family can live for generations in the same village, following the same line of work but if even just one family member goes to a city for work, then other younger people in the family get the opportunity to do something else.  But now Pappu really has to hurry to meet the contractor. He excuses himself and merges into the street crowd ahead, his dress keeping him identifiable for a long time.",MUSTARD OIL

Whats worse is that prices of basic ingredients for even a plain hilsa curry have shot up, with packaged mustard oil going for around Rs 130-Rs 140 a litre and green chilli breaching the Rs 250/kg barrier. Ginger, too, has touched Rs 180/kg mark.Back-to-back lockdowns, social distancing norms and prohibitive diesel price have caused the crisis. In the deep sea, fishermen have to practically chase schools of hilsa to catch them. But spiralling diesel prices prevented them from doing so this season, said Bijon Maity, secretary of West Bengal Fishermens Association.Transportation issues have also affected supply. If the catch is good, there is a point in transporting them to the city markets. If the catch is small, it is better to sell them off in the local markets. The cost of transportation is too high and the catch has been small this time, said Gaouranga Basak, a trader at Diamond Harbour Fisheries Port.Even in the midst of monsoon, hilsa is nowhere to be seen in the city markets. The smaller variety or khoka ilish  catching of which is banned  is selling at a premium.They are less than 400g in weight, yet are selling at Rs 1,000/kg, said Ambika Bandyopadhyay, who loves to have the fish on his platter.The price of mustard oil is also at an all-time high. Bengal is not a mustard producing state. It is generally brought from Haryana and Rajasthan. The lockdown and consecutive spikes in diesel price has made it costlier. The oil mills in Bengal are not getting rough raw materials and the prices are unlikely to dip before the next harvesting, said Biswanath Agarwal, general secretary of Posta Merchants Association.The price of green chilli has shot past Rs 250 and is moving towards the Rs 300/kg mark. This is an all-time high. The Beldanga variety, which is sought after because of its pungency, has become especially expensive. The Beldanga variety is set to touch the Rs 300/kg mark in retail markets, said Kamal Dey, president, West Bengal Vendors Association.Price of ginger, which was Rs 70-Rs 80/kg even a fortnight ago, is now set to cross Rs 200. It was being sold at Rs 180 per kg across the city markets on Tuesday. A delectable hilsa dish is very expensive, though its demand in hotels and restaurants is very low. This shows how deep the scarcity is, said Manjula Goswami, a culinary expert.",MUSTARD OIL

The force will procure 1,200 quintals of mustard oil from the Khadi and Village Industries Commission (KVIC) with a total financial implication of over Rs 1.73 crore, an ITBP spokesperson said.  A Memorandum of Understanding was signed between the two sides on Friday. The aim is to increasingly procure swadeshi or indigenously made products, he said. The MoU was signed by KVIC Chairman Vinai Kumar Saxena and officials of the ITBP procurement wing in Delhi. The ITBP, a mountain-warfare trained force for guarding the 3,488-km-longs Line of Actual Control (LAC) with China, is the first among the paramilitary or CAPFs to ink such a deal. The other Central Armed Police Forces are the CRPF, CISF, BSF and the SSB.  Home Minister Amit Shah had declared few months ago that the CAPF canteens will only sell swadeshi or indigenous products from June.  Apart from mustard oil, the ITBP is also procuring durries (mats), towels and blankets from the suppliers empanelled with the KVIC.  Approximately 2.5 lakh durries will be procured by ITBP at a cost of Rs 17 crore. The force is the nodal agency for procurement of durries for all CAPFs, the spokesperson said.  The ITBP has also suggested that yoga kits, hospital bed sheets, khadi uniform, pickels and some other items can be purchased for the CAPF jawans through KVIC, a senior official said.  These items will also be sold to the personnel and their families through the CAPF canteens.  These canteens, with a network of 1,700 stores, do an estimated business worth Rs 2,800 crore annually by selling their products to 50 lakh family members of about 10 lakh personnel of these forces tasked with a variety of internal security work apart from border guarding duties.  The KVIC, according to its profile statement, is charged with the planning, promotion, organisation and implementation of programmes for the development of khadi and other village industries in the rural areas in coordination with other agencies engaged in rural development wherever necessary.",MUSTARD OIL

For my sisters and me, it also meant having our father at home for the whole day; dedicated government servant that he was, we hardly saw him on other days of the week. As for Ma, it gave her a short respite from the kitchen. Before we woke up, Baba would have come back from the market with the mutton, and Ma would have started grumbling about its quality. It was very easy for vendors to dupe him; he would often be saddled with stale fish, rotting vegetables and undesirable cuts of meat.  Before leaving for the market, Baba would have soaked a few garlic cloves in water. After coming back, he would first grind a few pieces of turmeric and red chillies into a fine paste on the mortar stone. Then it would be the turn of cumin seeds, followed separately by onions, and then ginger-garlic; and finally, it would be coriander and poppy seeds. Each set of masalas would be ground one by one and kept aside singly as a ball on a thali.  While grinding the masala, the hard masculinity of his habitual presence would be gone; his wrists would have the grace of an Odissi dancer . He would again seem to me an affectionate man, who used to laugh like a baby when as a child I would stop pretending to sleep and jump on his back when he came to our bed to set the mosquito net late in the evening.  But while cooking, his face would be grim with concentration; most answers to questions would be in the form of grunts. After washing the potatoes, he would cut each one into evenly sized pieces with the skin on. Then in a wok, he would heat some mustard oil on a medium flame, add the potato pieces, sprinkle some salt and cook these till half-done.  Step by step  Baba would hedge his bets regarding the quality of the mutton he had bought by chopping the cuts into evenly sized chunks around three centimetres long. He would put these pieces in a big wok with a litre of hot water, salt, ground pepper and turmeric powder and stew for around 90 minutes on a slow flame with a lid covering the vessel.  When the mutton got tender, he would scoop the pieces out and keep the stock with the melted fat aside. We children would then be called to sample khaasi sijhaa  boiled mutton  in three separate small bowls. Each would contain three to four bits, with the younger ones getting the juicier, easy to chew portions.  Then Baba would heat mustard oil in a big wok. When the oil started smoking, he would throw in some sugar. It would soon caramelise, the oil turning the colour of molten sunsets. Into this river the colour of diluted blood, Baba would add a couple of bay leaves, followed by a pinch of cumin seeds. Then he would start adding and frying the wet masala in an order reminiscent of a military march-past. First, the onion paste would go in, followed by the ground turmeric and red chillies; then the ginger-garlic would be thrown in, followed by cumin paste, ground coriander and poppy seeds. He would saut each paste for 4-5 minutes, then add the next one in sequence; no shortcuts for him. By this time, he would be sweating profusely and the masala would be the colour of the Amazon in full spate, and smell like a tropical paradise.  Lunch at last  To this sautd masala, he would add the fried potatoes and cook on a low flame. By now we children would be hungry and pester him to finish soon. But he would braise the potatoes in the spices with intermittent stirring for about a quarter of an hour, sprinkling water every minute or so, to ensure that the masala did not burn or stick to the bottom of the wok.  When the potatoes were almost done, he would add the boiled mutton and continue to simmer while slowly smattering the wok with the mutton stock. With all the stock gone, he would add half a litre of hot water and boil the tarakari for a few minutes to get a very thin and watery gravy.  It would be well after 1 p.m. by the time he was done; the regional film might have started on Doordarshan by the time Baba finished concocting his mutton curry. When he finally joined us after his post-cooking bath, we children and Ma would be almost halfway through the lunch of usuna (parboiled) rice and khaasi maangsa tarakari, as we sat in a half circle in front of our black-and-white Konark TV, enjoying the finesse of Babas hands finally getting the better of the gaucherie of his eyes.

The spices with anti-inflammatory and anti-viral properties are being used like never before by the people who are doing everything possible to prevent the infection.  The sale of sonti (dry ginger), lavangalu (clove), miriyalu (black peeper), dalchina (cinnamon) and turmeric among others has seen an increase since the outbreak of the virus, the shopkeepers say.  Out of stock  The dry ginger has run out of stock at many shops. Dry ginger powder, which was available at 25 for 50 gm before the pandemic has now gone up to 45. There has not been any increase in the prices of the other spices, though the demand for them has gone up, says Giridhar, a grocery store owner at MVP Rythu Bazaar.  Many outlets dealing with wellness products are of the same view. We have run out of dry ginger stock. Though the overall business has suffered owing to the pandemic. Customers, however, are buying spices in more quantities. The sale of millets has dropped, but honey, which we procure from Sirohi district in Rajasthan, is in high demand, says Bandaru Naresh of Sumaja Eco-Wellness which has outlets at Seethammadhara and Pandurangapuram.  Some NGOs selling spices are taking alternative routes as their outlets remain closed. The high demand for scvpices has not yielded much as we cannot open our stall at the Araku Museum owing to lockdown. However, I have been supplying items to our acquaintances on demand, says Devullu Pachari, secretary of Sanjeevani, an NGO.  However, he says that the NGO has sold 80 kgs of dry ginger, 250 kgs of black peeper, 50 kgs of mustard seed and 400 kgs of turmeric powder since March. The parcel service launched by the APSRTC has come to our rescue. Dry ginger which was sold at 450 a kg earlier is now available at 650 a kg, he adds.  Apart from the spices, consuming kashayam, a concoction of various spices and herbs, is gaining ground. Kashayam is being increasingly used to boost immunity and prevent respiratory tract infections, says Sarat Pendekanti of Akshayadhatri Farms at Nandyal in Kurnool district.  How to make kashayam  Once can powder dry ginger, turmeric, black peeper and cinnamon stick should be powdered and boil the mixture with water. Care should be taken to avoid over boiling as it reduces the effect. The concoction should be consumed in an empty stomach early in the morning. One should not consume anything except for water for 30 minutes after drinking the concoction, he says.",MUSTARD OIL

The term chutney is derived from the Hindi word chatni, which means to lick.  The traditional Indian thali, be it Gujarati or South Indian, features chutney as an integral part of the fare. A freshly prepared chutney is a delicious blend of flavours that can instantly uplift a bland meal.  Take khichdi, for example, which was traditionally prepared as a remedial dish in case of sickness. A spoonful of fresh chutney swiftly transforms khichdi into a delectable dish. Back in the colonial era, gourmands and chefs were quick to realise the worthiness of chutneys and used it to their advantage extensively.  Come to think of it, its impossible to imagine eating a kebab, tikka or any tandoori item, without a chutney to go with it. Even the dosa and the samosa feel incomplete without their accompaniments.  It is sad to see that in the modern day, we have replaced the indigenous chutneys with their poorer cousins  the store-bought, mass-manufactured spreads, sauces and ketchups.  A reason for this change has been the misplaced notion that hot and spicy foods are detrimental to health. Chutneys also came to be looked upon as an indulgence of sorts, best when avoided.  This, I believe, is the cyclic pattern of popularity that rules the world of food, clothing and almost everything else that we deal with.  The diversity of India can be mapped through the kinds of chutney prepared across the country. In fact, this would make for a delightful school project to help children understand food diversity.  The varying ingredients used to prepare chutneys are usually based on their availability and seasonality. To add a tangy zest to the preparation, some parts of the country use tamarind (imli), while some others use lemon or amchur.  The raw mango takes centre stage in summer, although every household has its unique mango chutney recipe with varying ingredients added in different ratios. Also, many different chutneys around India that are prepared with a tomato base.  The tomato could be raw or cooked. A sweet-and-sour chutney or one that is akin to a salsa where the raw tomato is blended with chillies and onion.  The dose of lycopene that you get with these tomato chutneys is great for the health of your heart, prostate, eyes, skin and more. Coconut chutney is a favourite in the coastal regions, where coconut is found in plenty.  A popular version has a splattering of mustard seeds, green chillies and some dal blended in to provide the good fat, vitamins and minerals. A couple of months ago, I shared the recipe for a curry leaf chutney that I regularly prepare as an accompaniment to my meals.  I was happy to learn that many of you tried it out, enjoyed the taste, and benefited from its high content of Vitamin A & C. The pandemic has reintroduced many herbs and spices into our regular diet, and chutneys are a great way to include all these different foods, textures and flavours into the diet.  The variety is indeed unlimited  a friend of mine specialises in preparing chutneys from a delightful combination of unlikely ingredients such as raw papaya, ginger, dates, tomato and tamarind.  A great way to use the oft-discarded coriander stalks, which are so flavourful and loaded with vitamins, can easily be included in a chutney. The regular intake of well-prepared chutneys and fermented pickles can be a beneficial adjunct to a healthy diet.  NEELANJANA SINGH  Nutrition Therapist & Wellness Consultant",MUSTARD OIL

Vaishali Vijaykumar gathers seven lip-smacking recipes from homechefs  FRIED MODAK BY CHITRA GANAPATHY  Ingredients  Wheat flour: 1/2 cup, Salt: a pinch, Melted ghee: 1/2 tsp,  Rava/Sooji: 1 tsp (optional),  Water: as needed,  Cooking oil: to deep fry  For stuffing/pooran  Grated coconut: 1/2 cup  Powdered jaggery: 1/3 cup  Cardamom powder: 1/4 tsp  Dry roasted poppy seeds: 1 tbsp (optional)  Method  For stuffing  Take the grated coconut, powdered jaggery and dry roasted poppy seeds in a kadai.  The quantity of jaggery should be less than coconut. Do not add water. Mix well on medium flame.  Let the jaggery melt in the heat and mix well with coconut.  When the mixture starts to become thick without moisture and leaves the pan, switch off the flame and transfer the stuffing onto a plate.  Spread it well and let the stuffing cool down.  For dough  In a wide bowl, take the wheat flour, melted ghee, a pinch of salt and mix well. Add water little by little and make a stiff, thick dough.  The dough should not be too soft. Knead for some time and cover with a wet cloth. Let the dough rest for just five minutes.  Take a small ball of dough and dust in wheat flour. Make a thin circle of poori size.  Remember, the sides of the circle should be thinner than the centre. As this is made of wheat flour, it will become dense after deep-frying.  So make the poori thin. Cover the remaining dough with a wet cloth.  Now, with a lid, cut the dough into small uniform circles. Place one tablespoon of stuffing in the middle and make 5-7 pleats in the dough.  Refer picture and do the same way. Join all the pleats and make a coconut shape modak. Make sure the modak is sealed properly else the stuffing will ooze out in oil while frying.  Heat oil in a kadai. Gently drop a pinch of dough. If it rises to the top immediately, oil temperature is just right.  Now, drop 3-4 modaks and cook on medium flame. Cook till they turn golden brown. Flip it and cook till done. Remove and place them on a tissue. Fried modak is ready.  DRY FRUIT MODAK BY VIDYA SRINIVASAN  Ingredients  Raw rice: 100 gm, Dates: 140 gm (20 nos), Almond powder: 70 gm,  Cardamom powder: 1.5 gm, Ghee: 8 gm, Sesame oil /coconut oil: 10 ml,  Salt: a pinch, Water: as needed  Method  Wash and soak rice for at least two hours.  Grind the rice into a fine paste, adding a little water. Do not add excess water, as the rice will not be fine-ground with excess water.  After grinding the rice, add extra water to make it a watery batter (dosai batter consistency). We might need around 130 ml of water in total.  Chop the dates roughly and microwave the pieces for around 30 seconds to turn them soft. Let the dates cool.  Grind the dates with little water and transfer into a plate.  Add almond powder, cardamom powder and ghee to the dates paste; mix well and keep aside.  Add sesame oil to a pan, and when oil is hot, add the rice batter and salt; mix well.  Continuously mix with a ladle until it comes together as a non-sticky dough. Cover and reduce the stove to the lowest setting.  Cook for a minute and switch off.  Transfer the dough onto a plate and cover with a damp cloth.  When the dough is still warm, grease your hands with oil and knead the dough well.  If required, sprinkle some hot water to make a smooth dough.  Make small spheres. Since rice flour is gluten-free, it tends to be sticky; greasing palms with coconut/sesame oil helps to make modak.  Slowly press the sphere with your hand and make a circle big enough to keep the filling.  Place a small portion of the dates paste into the circle.  Fold the circle and bring the outer layer to the top, making a modak shape. Alternatively, a mould can also be used.  Similarly, fill all the modaks with the stuffing.  Steam for 10 minutes or until the modak looks shiny on the outside and does not stick.  Switch off. Do not remove as soon as the stove is switched off. Let the modak sit for five minutes before removing.  Enjoy it warm.  Notes  Instead of almond flour, 70 grams of mixed nuts or any nuts of choice can be used. Dry roast the nuts until golden, let it cool and transfer to a mixer jar. Grind it to a slightly coarse mixture. Dry fruit mixture should not be sticky. If you prepare the dough beforehand, make sure to keep it covered with a damp cloth/paper towel to avoid the dough from drying. Store-bought /homemade rice flour can be used instead of rice. Use 100 grams of flour. Boil water with salt and oil, after it comes to boil, add rice flour and mix well till it turns into a non-sticky dough. Coconut can be added for flavour. Excess dry fruits mixture can be served by moulding them in the shape of a modak, or rolling them into a laddu.  CAKE POP MODAK BY NISHA GALA  Ingredients  Cake sponge: 200 gm, Frosting/  ganache: 100 gm, Chocolate to dip  modak: 200 gm, Silicon modak  mould, Few lollipop sticks  Method  In a bowl, break the cake sponge into fine crumbs using your hand. Add your choice of frosting or ganache and mix well. It should combine well and form a cake batter.  Take a small amount of cake batter and put it in silicon modak mould.  Melt chocolate using the double boiling method. Dip one end of the stick into chocolate and pass it through the cake batter in the mould.  Place the mould in the freezer for 10-12 minutes or until the cake is firm.  Carefully demould the modaks and dip it in melted chocolate.  Let it set for 2-3 minutes.Cakepop modaks are ready.  SPICY PROTEIN MODAK BY RAMYA SIVAKUMAR  Ingredients  For spice powder Urad dal: 1 tsp,  Chana dal: 1 tsp, Dried red chillies: 2,  Cumin seeds: 1/2 tsp, Black  peppercorns: 1/4 tsp  For stuffing  Moong sprouts: 1/2 cup  Grated coconut: 1/4 cup  Oil: 1 tsp  Mustard seeds: 1/2 tsp  Urad dal: 1/2 tsp  Asafoetida/ hing: 1/4 tsp  Curry leaves: 1 sprig  Salt as needed  Water as needed  For dough  Rice flour: 1/2 cup  Water: 3/4 cup (adjust as needed)  Sesame oil/ gingelly oil: 1 tsp  Salt as needed  Method  Spice powder  Dry roast all the spice powder ingredients until golden brown on low flame.  Once cooled, grind into a smooth powder.  For filling  Pressure-cook moong sprouts with enough water for two whistles.  In a pan, heat oil and temper mustard seeds, urad dal. Once urad dal turns golden brown, add fresh curry leaves and asafoetida/hing. Next, add pressure-cooked moong sprouts, and salt as needed.  Cook for a minute and add 2-3 tsp of the spice powder. Cook for a couple of minutes and add fresh grated coconut.  Remove from heat and let it cool completely.  For dough  Bring 3/4 cup of water to boil along with 1/2 tsp of sesame/gingelly oil and salt as needed.  Once the water boils well, switch off the flame.  Add rice flour and quickly stir it. Make sure there are no lumps.  Add 1/2 tsp of sesame/ gingelly oil on top and leave it covered for 3-4 minutes. When it is warm enough to handle, knead it into a soft pliable dough.  For modak  Apply sesame/gingelly oil all over the modak mould. Take a small ball of dough and press along the edges of the mould such that there is a gap in the centre. Fill it with the spicy sprouts filling.  Cover the modak on top with some more dough. Gently open the mould and remove the modak. Repeat the same with rest of the dough. Keep applying oil on the mould for every modak.  To steam the modaks, grease a steamer plate with few drops of sesame/gingelly oil.  Place the prepared modaks on the steamer plate and steam for 7-8 minutes. Switch off the heat and let them cool for a couple of minutes before removing them from the vessel.  JACKFRUIT KOZHUKATTAI BY RAJESWARI VIJAYANAND  Ingredients  Jackfruit: 8 pala sulai,  Jaggery powder: 1/2 cup  heaped, Coconut: 1/2 cup  grated, Cardamom: 2, Ghee:  1 tsp, Rice flour/ idiyappam  flour: 1 cup, Sesame oil: 1 tsp, Salt: as needed  Method  First, prepare the jackfruit stuffing. Separate the seed and thin skin around it. Roughly tear, divide into two-three pieces.  Place it in a vessel and sprinkle a tablespoon of water. Pressure cook for three whistles on medium flame. Let it cool and then, grind to a paste.  Heat a pan with ground paste, jaggery, grated coconut, and cardamom.  Stir until it is thick. Add a teaspoon of ghee in the end. (I let the stuffing to be loose in texture.)  For dough  Boil water well. In a mixing bowl, take rice flour. Add sesame oil, required salt to it. Add boiling hot water to the flour and mix with a ladle.  Once warm enough to handle, grease your hands and knead to a smooth dough. Divide into equal lemon-sized balls.  Shape  To make elai kozhukattai, cut the banana leaf into small sheets. Refer notes for tips.  Grease with oil. Place rolled dough ball and flatten to a thin round. Place two teaspoons of prepared jackfruit stuffing.  Fold in such a way that the other part exactly covers the stuffing. Gently press the leaf towards the outer edge to seal.  Steaming  Place in idli pot plate/ steamer and steam for eight minutes.  Once done, you can take out the kozhukattai immediately. It comes off easily.  You can reuse the leaves to finish the dough.  Notes  Do not add more water while pressure-cooking jackfruit. Make sure to powder the jaggery well before measuring for a precise outcome. (I used jaggery powder.) More the jaggery, the sweeter it gets. (I used little more than 1/2 cup and felt it was too sweet, so reduced in my recipe.) To ensure that the banana leaf does not tear while folding, wilt the leaf slightly over direct flame. You can steam more than four modaks in an idli plate by placing it accordingly.  SWEET POTATO MODAK BY RAJESWARI VIJAYANAND  Ingredients  Sweet potato cooked & mashed: 1/2 cup, Kozhukattai flour or idiyappam  flour: 1/4 cup + 2 tbsp, Sesame oil: 1 tsp, Salt as needed  For stuffing  Coconut grated: 1cup  Jaggery powdered: 3/4 cup  Cardamom: 2  Salt: 1 pinch  Ghee: 1 tsp  Method  For stuffing  Heat powdered jaggery with very little water. Mix well to melt.  Filter to remove any impurities.  Heat coconut, jaggery syrup in a heavy-bottomed pan.  Cook until the syrup thickens and mixture gathers together.  Add cardamom, a pinch of salt, and ghee before switching off and mix well.  For dough  Peel, wash, and cut the sweet potato into cubes. Steam cook for 15 mins or until soft through inside.  Take the cooked sweet potato in a mixing bowl. Mash well.  Add kozhukattai flour (alternatively, use idiyappam flour or rice flour), salt, oil and mix well.  Add hot boiling water, just a little to make the dough. Knead smoothly.  Prepare both purple and yellow versions the same way. (I used a pinch of turmeric for the yellow one.)  Take a large lemon-sized ball of the dough and knead to smoothen it.  Flatten it to a thick, palm-sized disc. Place about 1 tbsp of the mixture in the centre.  Gather the sides to cover the stuffing carefully. Seal and roll into a smooth ball.  Place it in a mould. You can use any modak shape or even jelly moulds.  Steam for 5-7 minutes. (I used my idli pot and placed the modak in a bamboo steamer.)  You can use idli plates too. Just grease it and place the modaks. Repeat to finish.  POHA MANGO MODAK BY VIJAYA VENKATESH  Ingredients  Pearl millet flakes/aval / poha powder: 1 cup, Thick  mango puree: 1 cup, Thick  coconut milk or dairy milk: 1/2 cup, Country sugar/  jaggery/sugar, cup: 1/4 cup, Coconut oil: 2 tbsp,  Water: 2 tbsp,  Cardamom powder: 1/2 tsp, Salt: 1/8 tsp, Yellow  food colour (optional): 1/8 tsp  Method",MUSTARD OIL

There was a wonderful Greek restaurant there (more than 15 years ago), and I still fondly remember its dolmas. Then that shut, but to my utter joy, a restaurant came up in its place which had a wide spectrum of food from the states, including from the northeast. But all good things come to an end, so that restaurant  called Mosaic  shut, too.  Did I say all good things come to an end? Not always. After many ups and downs, and several restaurants here and there, the deft hand behind Mosaic is now wielding the spatula again. My friend Sohail had alerted me to the fact that a new outfit called Culinary Connections by Utpala Mukherjee (Ph: 9811157989 and 9350155045) was delivering food. I had a look at the menu and found some of my old favourites there. So, I promptly called up and placed a modest order.  A very happy meal later, I had a chat with the chef. An Assamese, she grew up in Shillong, learnt how to cook from her mother and then started her culinary improvisations. She ran Mosaic, the YWCA Kitchen, and the restaurant in Assam Bhavan for a while. After the lockdown, she decided to start a delivery service.  The menu has a nice variety, with some choice dishes under Western, Bengali, and Northeastern Sections. Every week, it has something special to offer. This week it is daab chingri (prawns cooked in coconut milk, 700), pork sorpotel (375), and thor (a dish of tender banana stem, 300).  We asked for a full roast chicken with onion sauce, mashed potatoes, and glazed vegetables (half, Rs 325; full, Rs 450), shepherds pie (400), dhokar dalna (175), muttar puri with alur dum (150), and patishapta (150). We got a discount, and the bill (with delivery charges) came to 1,225.  I enjoyed the roast, which came with a delicious sauce. The chicken was neither too dry, nor underdone, and the dripping from the roast had been cooked with onions and some secret ingredients, Mukherjee says. It didnt come with mashed potatoes but whole, browned potatoes, which went superbly with the roast that was perfect.  The shepherds pie was excellent, too  though somewhat different from the way I cook it. It had bits of chopped carrots in it (the traditional recipe does have carrots) and the flavour of the Worcestershire sauce was strong.  Among Bengali dishes, dhokar dalna is one of my favourites. It is a dish of steamed lentil cakes in a tomato-onion gravy. I had some of that with the muttar puris (each plate had four puris) and the aloo  which was a delicious dish of potatoes, boiled and fried, and then cooked with ginger, garlic, onion, tomatoes, and spices.  The patishapta disappointed me. It was much too small, I thought, and could have done with a thicker filling of kheer.  I would have liked some pork, but Id OD-ed on the meat the week before, so stayed away from my favourite northeastern dish of pork cooked with black sesame paste (250) and roast pork with cream spinach and mashed potatoes (325).  The Western section also includes roast lamb with mint sauce (400), fish and chips (385), vegetable crepes in cheese sauce (250) and vegetable au gratin (250). Also on the menu are machher paturi (grilled mustard fish: 300) and chicken rezala (235). Our friends, the Farooquis, ordered the rezala, and said it was umda (outstanding).  The food is umda, indeed.  The writer is a seasoned food critic",MUSTARD OIL

The prime minister paired the safa with a half-sleeve kurta and a fitted churidar. He also wore a white scarf with a saffron border that he used to cover his mouth and nose in view of the COVID-19 pandemic.  Last year, Modi sported a multi-coloured turban as he gave his sixth Independence Day speech from the ramparts of the Red Fort after returning to power for a second term with a thumping majority.  For his maiden Independence Day in 2014, he had opted for a bright red Jodhpuri bandhej turban with green at the tail.  In 2015, he chose a yellow turban covered with multi-coloured criss-cross lines, and a tie and dye turban in hues of pink and yellow in 2016.  The prime ministers turban for 2017 was a mix of bright red and yellow with criss-crossed golden lines all over. He donned a saffron turban for his appearance at the Red Fort in 2018.

He was the only accused against whom an RCN was issued in July 2018.  Agarwal has been detained in Abu Dhabi based on our RCN. We are in the process to compile all the documents which will be sent for his extradition, said Rajvardhan Sinha, EOW chief. Inspector Ramchandran Lotlikar , chief investigating officer, said that Agarwal had no commodity in his godowns and still sold on the NSEL platform. Bogus warehouse receipts, invoices etc were raised with the connivance of the NSEL officers and siphoned of the money. Agarwals three godowns were raided by the EOW. His registered office at the Industrial area near Janakpuri chowk in Ludhiana had no electricity nor it had any material / commodity, said an officer.  Earlier his father, Kailash Agarwal , was arrested by the EOW in 2014 and Enforcement Directorate (ED) in 2016 for his alleged role in the case. ED is probing a money laundering angle in the NSLE case. The father son duo had raised Rs 719 crore on the pretext of trading in commodities like wool, paddy, wheat, mustard oil and had projected that they are in physical possession of these commodities at their various warehouses based in Ludhiana.  With Rs 719 crore of payment default , ARK Imports is the second largest defaulter in the NSEL cheating case where over 13,000 investors were duped on the pretext of trading in commodities. The father-son duo are accused of investing the money in real estate and siphoning off the majority of the amount overseas. EOW had earlier attached 82 properties, estimated valued at Rs 102 crore, belonging to the Agarwals, in this case. The EOW has arrested 34 accused and filed four separate charge sheets in this case. It has attached properties approximately worth Rs 6,500 crore belonging to various accused and their firms.",MUSTARD OIL

Anyone who has watched the serial or spent a significant amount of time in the company of North Indian grandparents will know the phrase Birbal ki khichri. The khichri in the popular story is not an actual dish but a proverbial one, and the moral is that a ray of hope is all it takes to inspire a hardworking person to realise his dreams.Drawing from this story, Michelin-starred chef Suvir Saran has created a recipe by the same name. With this, I wanted to share that even humble beginnings can take one soaring with pride into the stratosphere. If a bimaaron ki khichri (khichri for patients) can be turned into a gourmet dining experience, humans too can reach for the stars with their own drive, vision and determination when there is a level playing field and societal support, says the sprightly chef who has returned to India after a successful stint in the US and launched The House of Celeste restaurant in Gurgaon.Why a khichri though? When I crave comfort food, it is most often dreams of khichri that captivate my imagination, he says.Back to rootsKhichri, perhaps one of Indias most-loved soul foods, is essentially a one-pot meal of lentils, rice and vegetables that is transported to another dimension via multiple layers of spices  every bite is a new discovery of tastes and textures. The Birbal ki khichri that the chef grew up eating at home includes panch phoran (a spice blend of whole cumin, fennel, fenugreek, nigella seeds and mustard seeds) that are fried in ghee or clarified butter with coriander and tomatoes, and then a second boost of spice from a ghee-bloomed blend of more cumin, some cayenne, and oniony asafoetida.It is such an incredible dish that there is even a legend behind it, says Saran. This khichri originated in mid-16th century India, when Birbal, an official at Emperor Akbars court, taught the emperor a lesson by claiming to have cooked the khichri.When I crave comfort food, it is most often dreams of khichri that captivate my imaginationAt our house, we like to say that if its good enough for Akbar and Birbal, its good enough for you, laughs the chef. This dish is so lovely that I often just serve it with nothing but some raita, achaar if youre craving spice, and perhaps crispy poppadum on the side. Follow the recipe a few times and then begin to play with the flavours and simplify it as you like, he adds.How did this dish make it to his home? I belong to the Kayasth community, who were the first Hindus to marry into the Muslim community. They were the epitome of the Ganga-Jamuna culture. Our foods, music, dance, dress, language and traditions take the best of the two communities and put them together into beautiful mosaics that make the individual elements shine and remain relevant, explains Saran. In Kayasth homes, khichri, tehri, Kabuli pulao and biryanis are common fare. The pairing of rice and lentils is a given exercise almost daily in some way, shape or form.Twist in the taleWhile the medicinal rice-and-lentil porridge or mareezon ki khichri is made when the stomach needs rest, a sabz-daar or vegetable-rich khichri is made when the mind needs a reflective moment to meditate on the senses of taste, touch, scent, and sight.Saran adds a tweak to the traditional home recipe. I fry the moong dal in a pan to make it darker in colour and for its natural oils to be released. This nutty flavour becomes the faint yet easily-savoured spine of the dish. My family and relatives make many versions of khichri with vegetables, but none has the sequential addition of flavours that my recipe has! he winks.Saran recalls how his dads uncle, a retired IAS officer, made this for his family when they briefly moved from Delhi to Nagpur where his father, a bureaucrat, was posted. Mausaji and mausiji were visiting us and he made this for us for dinner. A most beautiful gift. I am sure mausajis work with the Nizam of Hyderabad might have had some role in the roots of this dish. Perhaps this memory also gave me the confidence to cook without caring about the bullying I might face as a boy who cooked. We found the khada masalas (whole spices) and the use of vegetables a most incredible departure from the usual boring-yet-comforting khichri. Moms adoption of the recipe in our family culinary repertoire was quick, says Saran who has found this dish comforting since he was six years old.With his Birbal ki khichri recipe, Saran honours his mausajis legacy with a 21st century update. This is my homage to his skills, his nurturing nature, and his confidence in being a man who could cook with carefree abandon. Memories of food remain with us until our very end. This is one memory that will forever keep any other khichri from seducing me, he says.Recipe: Birbal ki Khichri (serves 10-12)Ingredients:For the topping6 to 8 cups/1.4 to 1.9 l peanut oil4 large red onions, halved and thinly-sliced1/4 cup/4 g finely-chopped fresh coriander2-inch/5 cm piece fresh gingerroot, peeled and thinly-sliced into very thin matchsticks1 -2 green chillies, finely minced (remove the seeds for less heat)1 tablespoon/15 ml lime juice1/2 teaspoon garam masala powderFor the khichri1 cup/190 g split and hulled mung dal2 tablespoons/30 g ghee or clarified butter10 green cardamon pods8 whole cloves3 bay leaves2-inch/5 cm cinnamon stick1 teaspoon panch phoran3/4 teaspoon turmeric1/8 teaspoon asafoetida1 cup/185 g basmati rice1/2 medium cauliflower, divided into very small florets1 medium red potato, cut into 1/2-inch pieces4 medium carrots, peeled and finely chopped10-ounce/285 g bag frozen green peasFor the first tempering2 tablespoons/30 g ghee or clarified butter1/2 teaspoon panch phoran1 large red onion, halved and thinly sliced1 tablespoons kosher salt or sea salt, or to taste2 teaspoons ground coriander seeds2 large tomatoes, finely diced1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepperSecond tempering oil2 tablespoons/30 g ghee or clarified butter1/2 teaspoon cumin seeds1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper1 pinch asafoetidaMethod:Heat the oil in a large Dutch oven (use enough oil to fill the saucepan to a 2-inch/5 cm depth) over medium-high heat until it reaches 350F/177C on an instant-read thermometer. Add the onions and fry until crisp and browned, about two minutes, turning the onions occasionally. Use a slotted spoon or frying spider to transfer the onions to a paper towel-lined plate and set aside.In a small bowl stir the coriander leaves, ginger, jalapeo, and lime juice together and set aside.Place the mung dal in a large skillet over medium heat and toast it until it is fragrant and lightly golden for three to five minutes. Transfer the dal to a large plate and set aside.Place the ghee, cardamom, cloves, bay leaves, cinnamon, panch phoran, turmeric, and hing into the pan and roast it over medium heat until the spices are fragrant, about two minutes.Add the rice, toasted dal, cauliflower, potatoes and carrots and cook until the rice becomes translucent and the cauliflower sweats, three to five minutes, stirring often. Pour in seven cups/1.65 l water, increase the heat to high and bring to a boil. Add the peas, bring back to a boil, reduce the heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer for 20 minutes.While the rice and dal mixture cooks, make the first tempering oil. Heat the ghee and panch phoran in a large skillet over medium heat until the cumin in the panch phoran begins to brown, for two to three minutes. Stir in the onions and the salt and cook until the onions are browned around the edges and soft, for about 10 minutes. If the onions begin to get too dark or stick to the pan bottom, splash the pan with a few tablespoons of water and scrape up the browned bits. Stir in the coriander and cook, stirring, for two minutes, and then stir in the tomatoes and the cayenne, cooking until the tomatoes are jammy, six to eight minutes, stirring occasionally. Turn off the heat and set aside.Once the rice and dal are cooked, remove the lid and use a potato masher to smash the mixture until only a few carrots and peas remain whole (remove the whole or large spices while mashing if you like). Stir in the first tempering along with the remaining three cups/720 ml of water. Return to boil and cook for two minutes. Turn off the heat.Make the second tempering oil. Wipe the pan from the first tempering oil and heat the ghee for the second tempering oil over medium heat along with the cumin, cayenne, and hing and cook, stirring often, until the cumin begins to brown, about two minutes. Immediately stir it into the rice and dal mixture.Divide the khichri between six bowls and top with some of the ginger mixture, a pinch of garam masala, and the fried onions and serve.Follow @lubnasalim1234 on TwitterFrom HT Brunch, August 23, 2020Follow us on twitter.com/HTBrunchConnect with us on facebook.com/hindustantimesbrunch",MUSTARD OIL

The mouth-watering smell that wafted from the kitchen pulled us towards it as we stared all starry-eyed at the pot and asked our mothers what is cooking! Lifestyle is much busier nowadays, and making elaborate curries that look, smell and taste wonderful has become a dream! However, this lal masala recipe changes things forever. If you dont have the time to spend hours making dishes that have various layers and elaborate flavours, you must have this versatile masala base in your kitchen.With this lal masala, you will be able to make dishes packed with flavours within a matter of minutes. The best part about this masala recipe is that it is made with ingredients that are already available in almost every kitchen. It is quick and easy to make, and you can whip up some fresh lal masala anytime you like. You need 11 cloves of garlic, 2 tbsp apple cider vinegar,  cup Kashmiri lal mirch powder and 2 tsp ground cumin. Put all ingredients in a food processor or grinder and grind until everything combines nicely. Scrape the walls of the blender and continue grinding until a grainy paste is achieved. Do not add more vinegar even if it takes some time to reach the desired consistency. You can store this masala for a month in an airtight container.Now that you have your freshly made lal masala, you only need a tablespoon to spruce up any dish that you might be making. If you are making gravies or stews, simply add 1 tbsp and it will enhance the flavours of your dish. For example, add the lal masala when the onion becomes transparent after sauteing with chopped garlic and green chillies. Just a quick stir will coat the onion in the spicy red masala and give a fantastic flavour.You can also use lal masala to marinate your meats and fishes. Feel free to combine this masala with other marinades to provide it with a different flavour that suits your palate. For example, if you are making a dish with chicken or meat, you can mix lal masala with mustard or barbeque sauce.Many varieties of ginger, garlic and combined pastes are available in the market that can be used as a base for your curries and gravies. However, these masalas are often mass-produced, and you can not be sure about the quality of the ingredients used. They are also packed with wide assortment of components that includes preservatives and a high amount of sodium that is enough to impact your health negatively. The poor combination of flavours might not work for your dishes as they lose their aroma fairly quickly. Hence, it might take a little effort making your own masala paste at home, but trust us, it is well worth the effort.",MUSTARD OIL

I remember the taste so vividly, she says. Jeslin grew up in Muvattupuzha, near Kochi, where unlike today, fresh fish was not accessible every day and so dried fish was used instead  fried or as chutney.Borne out of necessity, at a time when consumption depended on local catch, fish has traditionally been dried for no-fishing months. Easy access to fish has changed all that, dried fish has now become infra dig. When you can get fresh fish from across the country, why would you eat unnakkameen (Malayalam for dried fish)?, asks Chef Saji Alex, chef de cuisine at Kochi Marriotts Kerala specialty restaurant Cassava, which has chemmeen dried prawn chutney on its menu.With the pandemic making it more challenging to go to the market, people are once again turning to dried fish. The process of drying involves enzymatic or microbial activity in the presence of salt. When packed and stored properly, dry fish has a shelf life of more than two years, says Pradeep Kalidindi, who runs a seafood firm in Andhra Pradesh.Dried fish has a strong flavour and an overpowering smell, which makes it an acquired taste. While smaller fish such as prawn/shrimp and anchovy are sundried, the process is different for fleshier fish such as king fish. Traditionally, cleaned fish would be rubbed with salt, packed in palm leaf baskets and hung to dehydrate; now machines do this job.In Kerala and Tamil Nadu the preparations stick to template  curry, fry, and chutney. Bengals shutki maach is perhaps the most versatile take. The Bengalis believe that adding shutki elevates the taste of vegetables. For instance, shutki combined with brinjal or pumpkin is a popular version.At Anwesha Banerjees home in Kolkata, the war between football clubs East Bengal and Mohun Bagan began about five years ago when she married Amlan, a Ghoti (Bengalis of West Bengal). That battle  this time for the humble shukti maach  moved into the kitchen. Popular varieties consumed by Bengalis are Bombay duck, shrimp, ilish and shidol. The sun dried fish was traditionally consumed by Bengalis of East Bengal (now Bangladesh), where Kolkata resident Anwesha Banerjees ancestors hail from.I have so many childhood memories associated with it. My husband though cant stand its strong pungent smell, she laughs, adding, My favourite is shutki bata (mishmash or chutney). This is a fiery creation made with onion, garlic and chilli cooked in mustard oil. It tastes heavenly with steaming rice, says Anwesha.Monsoon delightBombay duck (bombil), christened thus by the British, is perhaps the most iconic dried fish. Dried bombil is commonly used to make pickles and added to curries in Maharashtrian households.Many households crumble the dried-and-salted fish and sprinkle it over their dal or rice to add a crunchy texture. While making bombil curries, we usually soak it for half an hour to rehydrate and soften the fish, says Asavari Koli, a banker who is also a food enthusiast.Bombil vadas at Bombay Canteen | Photo Credit: Special ArrangementSoaking not only softens the fish, but also washes off the salt reducing its concentration. Koli, Malvani, Konkani and Goan communities each boast their own distinct bombil preparation. The Mangaloreans use rava for coating while the Konkanis use rice flour. In Goa, the bombil is cooked using a mix of both rava and the rice flour. The Koli community use their signature Koli masala to cook bombil, says Asavari.Of all the recipes that she learnt from her mother, dried Bombay duck masala is her favourite. Served as a starter, dried Bombay duck masala is a quick recipe using chilli powder, lemon juice, curry leaves and turmeric, she adds. In Bengal, too, it is had as a starter: dried fish is roasted on charcoal, mixed with onion, green chilli, coriander and lemon juice.Versatility at its bestAndhra Pradesh is one of the biggest manufacturers of dried fish in the country along with Tamil Nadu and Gujarat. In Visakhapatnam alone, over 5,000 fisherfolk, mostly women, eke out their livelihood by drying ribbonfish, lizard fish, sliver bellies, anchovies, crocker ray finned fish, goatfish, sardines and other pelagic fish. Not only are these exported to Sri Lanka, Thailand, China and Bangladesh, they are also sent to other States such as Kerala.Everyday, three to four tonnes of dry fish is produced on average in the region, which is enough for local consumption. During the season, the production goes up to 10 tonnes per day. The process, after salting fresh fish, takes three to four days to dry.A taste of home Manik Deb, who lives in Nagpur, says the best shutki maach is the shidol type. A passionate cook who now takes care of an organic farm near Pench forest, Manik recalls cooking the shidol shutki brought all the way from Tripura by his friend. Shidol or puti mach (pool barb fish) is kept in an earthen vessel and sealed properly before it is buried. It is left there for months to provide anaerobic conditions for fermentation, says Manik. He prepares the shidol shutki jhaal cooked in mustard oil with onions and a generous dose of chilli, savoured with steamed rice. The pungent appetising aroma grows stronger when cooked. Just ensure that all the doors and windows are closed while cooking, chuckles Manik. (Nivedita Ganguly)Among the regional favourites is the endu chepala vankaya (dry fish brinjal curry)  seasoned with urad and chana dal, mustard and curry leaves, it is best had with steaming hot rice. Vineela Raju, a resident of Visakhapatnam, says, The dish is known for its robust flavour. It is prepared with a paste of tamarind, red chilli and asafoetida. I learnt this recipe from my grandmother who lived in the West Godavari district. It used to be prepared at a time when we did not get fresh fish in local markets. Now, it is a festive special in our household.Pride of placeIn Tamil Nadu, fish laid out to dry in front of homes, roofs, and terraces is a common sight in fishing villages. At the bigger fish markets such as Kasimedu Fishing Harbour in Chennai, there are designated areas for the preparation of dried fish.Raised concrete platforms arranged in rows by the quay, with ample space for people to walk in between them, and nearby, concrete tubs for soaking the fish with plenty of rock salt  this is what the dried fish area of Kasimedu looks like. Here, over 150 women are involved in the preparation, and all of them are members of the Karuvaadu Sangam (dried fish union).Fisherman R Vinod from Odai Kuppam, Besant Nagar, says that women in his locality prepare dried fish with unsold fish, and those that dont make the cut to the market. They rub rock salt on to the fish, and let this sit for a day. Then, the fish is dried till all the moisture runs out, he explains.Vinod says that women are involved in the laborious process through the year. Demand is high especially during the Tamil month of Aadi, since dried fish curry is part of the feast that follows a pooja that some people perform at home, he explains.For some varieties of dried fish, pricing can be the same as that of its fresh variant. A kilogram of seer fish today, costs between 900 and 1,200. For dried seer fish, the price is 1,000, says Vinod. The pricing also takes into account the fact that for one kilogram of fish, we get only half a kilogram of dried fish.Nevertheless, those involved in the preparation stand to gain since their products are good for up to six months. Kedacha varaikkum laabam (Its a profit, however much we make), he says, summing up the philosophy of dried fish from the fisherfolk perspective.(With inputs from Nivedita Ganguly, Aishwarya Upadhye and Akila Kannadasan)",MUSTARD OIL

Follow the CTM routine and then apply a primer to blur out the pores. Heres how you can make the makeup last longer under your mask.Next, apply a sheer foundation and blend it properly using a damp beauty blender. Dont forget to set your face with a loose setting powder as you do not want your makeup to budge under the mask.Bhumis main focus in on the eyes; so begin by priming your eyelids with an eye shadow primer or even a concealer. This helps keep discolouration (if you have any) at bay, and highlights the pigment of the eye shadow.As you may notice, Bhumi is wearing green coloured lenses. You too can opt for one. Begin with a light sweep of yellow or mustard colour on your eyelids. Blend it using a soft blending eyeshadow brush, and then focus on the crease to provide depth to your eyes by adding a slightly dark brown colour.Once your upper lid is done, go for a burnt orange or a terracotta-like shade and apply it on your lower lashline. Finish it with winged eyeliner and a few coats of mascara.Now using the same eyeliner, you can create 3 little stars just like the actor did or could go for little hearts too! Finish it off by adding a bronzer and a blush.Finally, apply a makeup setting spray so that your makeup lasts longer, and also a nude brown lip shade.

The show is enacted by actor Reshmi Boban and television anchor Bella George.Gireeshkumar says the short, three-minute format helps in telecasting repeats of the same episode for the day and serves as handy programme fillers. ""An episode's first slot is at 9 am and is shown randomly depending on the need for fillers. Also, since it is only about three minutes long, the content is kept to the point,"" he says.Actor Reshmi Boban (right) and television anchor Bella George in a still from the series | Photo Credit: Special ArrangementAjith Sukumaran, who composed the tunes to the lyrics expounding recipes, says he went for ""semi-fast, feel-good tones"" in order to bring out the feel of enjoying the process of cooking. ""For instance, when we speak about, say, spluttering mustard in oil or stirring thoroughly, the music had to enhance that sensuous element of cooking. That was the challenging part,"" he says. The tracks are sung by Sobha Sivani, Anagha DR and Vandana Nair, with Reshmi Boban herself crooning one.Lyrics were penned by Rajani V Menon, who runs a YouTube cookery channel, Rajani at Kitchen. ""The producers were keen that the lines had to be simple, lucid and musical to appeal to a general audience. We wanted to look at some uncommon recipes, both curries and payasams, showcasing variety but still easily doable at home during Onam. Also, the dishes had to be visually appealing,"" she points out.The 10 recipes covered for each day of the series are ari ada ellu payasam, kattar vazha (aloe vera) sambar, chendamuriyan (nenthra kaaya) payasam, vazhakoombu (banana flower) cutlet, thengin chotta payasam, cashew koottu curry, kurukku kaalan, vada koottu curry, thalagam and perakka (guava) pachadi. Rajani, who likes to experiment with traditional Kerala recipes, says she had tried out all the dishes cherry-picked for the series to ensure they are fit for the occasion.Singer Sobha Sivani, who crooned seven of the songs, says it was an interesting experience. ""If what I try to appeal to are emotions when singing film numbers, here I had to try and tickle the taste-buds through my voice. It was like singing as if I was experiencing the true taste of the dishes,"" she adds.",MUSTARD OIL

(Express Archives)Prime Minister Indira Gandhi said she received reports that there were foreign hands behind the recent riots at Moradabad and other places. Speaking at the meeting of Congress-I Working Committee, she said one might also view the Assam situation in the same context as there were similar allegations that there were foreign forces behind the movement there. The PM said that the flare-ups were all politically motivated. The incidents in Moradabad and other places should not be seen as isolated incidents. She said India has had extremely good relations with the Arab countries but there were forces trying to create misunderstanding between India and these nations.Prickly Poppy HavocA rare epidemic has hit some parts of rural Bengal owing to the consumption of a wild extract mixed with mustard oil. Physicians identified the adulterant as Argemone Mexicana, commonly called prickly poppy whose shrubs grow everywhere. Till now only one death has been reported but it is feared that the mortality could be higher because villagers are gullible to take any such illness as mysterious disease. C P Thakur, a Patna-based physician, said that such an epidemic is usually reported when prices of mustard oil become very high  its adulteration with prickly poppy oil becomes very common.Bonded By SufferingWhatever the state of relations between India and China, the two neighbours have been exchanging messages of sympathy over natural disasters in the two countries. Prime Minister Indira Gandhi received a letter from Chinese Premier Hua Guofeng expressing sympathy over the floods in Varanasi. Mrs Gandhi said she had thanked the Chinese premier saying his words have offered solace. Last month, she had sent a message expressing sympathy for the typhoon-hit people of Chinas Guangdong province. The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

But in a world struck by a pandemic, festivities, as in the case of most other occasions, are subdued.Onam is celebrated to commemorate King Mahabali, who is said to visit Kerala during this time. And every year, the Delhi Malayalee Association (DMA), a socio-cultural organisation that brings Keralites across Delhi-NCR together under one roof, has elaborate plans to ring in this harvest festival. Celebrations last for nearly three months, interspersed with cultural and religious activities. However, this time around, gatherings have been restricted to peoples homes, the stage to perform is now a webinar, and the applause that reverberates through an auditorium will now take a digital turn.READ: Happy Onam 2020: All you need to know about the 10 days of celebrationEvery year, on Onam, we conduct lavish celebrations on a large scale at an auditorium or stadium in the Capital. A week before Onam, we organise athapookalam (rangoli) competitions, in which several people across the National Capital Region participate with gusto. This year, we didnt feel it was right to hold such a large celebration, as the world is in a crisis. Having said that, we will hold a small programme online on August 30 evening, wherein short performances will take place, says C Chandran, general secretary, DMA, who affirms that although we are going through tough times, we cannot let it overcome festive spirit. This is being done more to boost the morale of people, rather than as a means of celebration, he adds.Onam celebrations were held at Delhis Siri Fort Auditorium last year.Every year, children who excel at academics are felicitated as part of celebrations. The association will continue with this tradition this year as well, only this time, it will be an online affair. We should not disappoint the kids, insists Chandran.The association is also getting together to help those in need, both financially and otherwise. We are all away from home (Kerala), but the reason we are continuing this is because we should not forget out culture. We need to teach our younger generations all about our culture and traditions, so we are seeing this (online celebration) as an opportunity to help our future generations stay rooted, he adds.And how can celebrations be complete without a quintessential feast or an Onam Sadhya, comprising a range of delectable dishes  both sweets and savories  that are a treat to the eyes and the palate. So, if you are also planning to celebrate at home, here are some lip-smacking recipes you could try out to revel in festivities.Puli InjiTo make this sweet and sour chutney-like culinary treat, you will need  cup ginger (finely chopped), 3tsp tamarind paste or 250g tamarind pulp, 100g green chilli (finely chopped),  tsp turmeric powder,  tsp red chilli powder,  tsp mustard seeds, 5 small onions (finely chopped; optional), 2-3 dry red chillies (broken),  cup jaggery, 2 sprigs curry leaves, 3tbsp coconut oil,1 cups water, salt to tasteMethod: Soak the tamarind in a cup of hot water for about 10-15 minutes. Then, squeeze the tamarind to extract the juice and filter it to get the extract. Else, dilute the tamarind paste in water. Set aside. Heat coconut oil in a kadai and fry the ginger until its brown. Remove the fried ginger, place it on a tissue paper and keep it aside to remove the oil from it. Grind the fried ginger to get it finely crushed.Next, take a kadai or an earthen pot (manchatti), pour the tamarind juice, add salt, chilli powder, turmeric powder and combine well. Bring it to a boil, reduce the flame to low and cook for 10 minutes, so that the gravy gets thick. Add one cup of hot water with jaggery and mix well, filter it and keep that aside.Heat oil in a pan, add mustard seeds. When they splutter, add chopped onions, dry red chilli, chopped green chilli and curry leaves and saute till its brown in colour. Pour this onto the cooked mixture. Add the crushed ginger and jaggery water, reduce the flame and allow the mixture to boil until it is thick, pulpy and reduced by half. Cool and transfer into a sterilised jar or bottle and leave it to settle for an hour or so. Your dish is ready!Beans ThoranA stir fry of sorts, this is an essential part of a sadhya. For this, you will need 1tbsp coconut oil,  tsp mustard seeds,  tsp cumin seeds, 6-7 pearls of sambar onions or shallots, 3-4 small or medium-sized garlic cloves (finely chopped), 1 green chilli (chopped), 10-11 curry leaves,  tsp turmeric powder, 250g french beans,  cup grated fresh coconut, 1/3 cup water or as requiredMethod: Rinse 250g of beans a couple of times and drain all the water. Discard the ends of the beans and finely chop. Next, heat coconut oil in a heavy pan or kadai. Add mustard seeds, and when it begins to crackle, add cumin seeds and let them crackle. Next, add in the sambar onions or shallots which have been chopped. You can even use finely chopped onions instead. Mix well and saut onions on a low flame, till they turn translucent. To this, add finely chopped garlic, green chilli, curry leaves, followed by turmeric powder and mix well.Now, add the finely chopped beans and stir. Add cup fresh grated coconut, season with salt as per taste and mix it well. Sprinkle about four tablespoons of water first and stir. Cover and cook the thoran on a low flame. Check after 3-4 minutes. If water has dried up, sprinkle some more water. Mix well and continue to cover and cook. Add water in parts, as and when required. Cook till the beans are completely cooked. If there is any water in the pan, cook without the lid till the water evaporates.Serve beans thoran with some steamed rice or a vegetable side dish. If you want, you can also garnish with some coriander leaves.Recipes by home chef Suja RajendranPayasamFor this traditional sweet dish, you will need  cup moong dal (soaked and drained), ghee, 1 cup water, 1 cup coconut milk,  cup jaggery, a pinch of salt, 1tsp cardamom powder,  cup cashew nutsMethod: Heat jaggery in a pan along with 2 tablespoons of water and let the jaggery melt.

It has been a hectic time.Funnily enough, some of the most interesting things I have tried reached my home, not because of any producer telling me about his or her products, but through word of mouth.My friend, the diplomat and global gourmet Vikram Doraiswami, enjoys cured meats as much as I do. He tipped me off about a small Delhi restaurant called HMan run by a guy called Harman (geddit?) that does barbecue. Vikrams son Arjun is a barbecue fan and he said that the food was as good as high-end barbecue in Canada. Harman has his own smoker, marinates, makes rubs and grills the meat on his own.The sandwiches at Plats are among the best in the capitalOwing to the lockdown, Vikram said HMan had started delivering its uncooked meats. Vikram had bought sausages, tossed them in butter till they started to brown and then cooked them covered for four minutes. They were, he said bluntly, much better than the usual sawdust sausages available online and in stores.So, I called up and ordered lots of things. The buffalo burger patties were excellent: nicely seasoned and moist. The sausages lived up to Vikrams praise. They had done their best with the buffalo steaks, which we cooked over an open fire (nice) and in a cast iron pan (not so good), but at the end of the day, there is only so much you can do with buffalo meat. I have still to try the bacon I ordered from HMan.I wrote some weeks ago about the excellent ice cream made by Cold Love, run by Aditya Tripathi (the man who made me do my first food show). That reference led to a lot of interest on social media and to a message from Ayesha Kapur, whom I know from her Diva days.Salted Caramel is among the popular ice cream flavours from Chubby CheeksAyesha has launched her own brand of artisanal ice cream called Chubby Cheeks and she sent me some. My wife Seema loved the Salted Caramel (one of Chubby Cheekss most popular flavours) while I stuck to the Coorg Vanilla, which had the distinctive flavour of real vanilla.There is so much talent and enterprise out there that one is constantly amazed by the range of the newly-emerging food and beverage sectorI tweeted about it and was startled when so many people tweeted back saying they loved Chubby Cheeks. Obviously Ayesha has a large fan following (including many well-known people) for her artisanal ice cream.The conversation about ice cream led Shivam Bhagat (who I know only from Twitter) to tweet to me that he liked vegan ice cream. I avoid lactose (but make an exception for ice cream, despite the abdominal discomfort this sometimes causes). Shivam, who is lactose intolerant and has avoided dairy for the last two years insisted that he had found a great almond milk-based brand. Not only were the ice creams vegan, they were also sugar-free.He sent me some and recommended the Dark Chocolate, which was, as he had said, excellent. Almond milk ice cream can be a little thin but the chocolate flavour was strong enough to make up for that. Only later did I realise that the ice cream (Minus 30) was made by the granddaughter of my old friends from Kolkata, Naresh and Sunita Kumar. Life can take you by surprise sometimes.Ayesha Kapur has launched an artisanal ice cream brandSticking with desserts, I have been dealing with Divya Sreeji for nearly two months now ever since she first DMed me. I finally ordered a gluten-free chocolate cake from her De Cakery. It was very good.Two of the best chefs I know are Kayasths and justly proud of their cuisine. (Manu Chandra and Suvir Saran.) But to the country at large, Kayasth food remains a mystery, mangled by hotels at useless pop-ups and rarely available to the general public. So, I was delighted when Vrinda Mathur, who offers Kayasth/Mathur food cooked by her mother, DMed me.I ordered three meat dishes: a dal meat, a biryani and mutton parsinde. All of it was outstanding. The dal meat was her nanas special recipe and the biryani was very Delhi: the family is from Old Delhi. Nothing was too heavy and it had the flavours of home cooking.Nitin from The Gravy Kitchen also got in touch with me on Instagram with his tale of woe. We are a start-up in Gurgaon doing North Indian food: delivery only. Started last year in November, we were badly hit by the pandemic and had to close shop in mid-March. We have restarted from July 7.The buffalo burger patties from HMan restaurant in Delhi are nicely seasoned and moistI ordered some gravy dishes and though all of them were good, the standout was the Chicken Rara Masala. Rara Gosht is a Punjabi dish much favoured by an older generation of chefs. It has suddenly come back into vogue.I had a wonderful version at Sukh Vilas three years ago when Simran Singh Thapar was the chef. And the Maurya, which has always had a tradition of very gifted Punjabi chefs (from Manisha Bhasin to Rajdeep Kapoor) does some terrific Punjabi dishes ( including Rara Meat), which remain under-recognised because of the fuss about ITCs Awadhi food. I had Rajdeeps Rara Meat and it was truly outstanding.So I was skeptical about how good Nitins Rara could be when it arrived days after Rajdeeps, but he blew me away with his terrific chicken version which I had never had before. If you live in Gurgaon, give The Gravy Kitchen a shot.Sticking with Indian food, I have been enjoying pickles, spices and masalas made by small artisanal operations. The most notable, of course, is run by Aditya Bal who found fame first as a top model before launching a second career as a TV chef. Aditya shifted to Kolkata but his products are available all over India and I recommend them highly.Aditya Bal is a top model-turned-TV chefSticking with Kolkata, I also recommend masalas by Nina Doshi, a Gujarati with a Kolkata connection (sounds familiar?). They have a wonderful home-made flavour about them and if you like Gujarati food, you should try them.Radhika Singh wrote to me on Instagram to say, My brother and I are farmers in Uttarakhand and have recently launched our range of handmade mustards under our brand Kuninda Mustards They are made using ingredients that we grow ourselves or source locally, excluding a couple of spices that come from Kerala.She sent me pictures of their range, which included fancy, gluten-free Bavarian mustard and something like a French country mustard.I am a Kasundi kind of guy when it comes to mustard, so I asked for something more desi. She came up with options and I bought her garlic mustard and the mirchi mustard, both of which were good.Artisanal pickles from chef Aditya Bal are highly recommendedI have known Jamsheed Bhote since he worked at Tres. In fact, it was Julia and Jatin, the chefs who run Tres, who recommended that I visit Plats, the restaurant that Jamsheed and his wife Haneesha have started in Lajpat Nagar.Then the lockdown intervened and I had to wait till Plats started delivery.Jamsheed and Hanishas forte is artisanry. Nearly everything, from the bread to the raw pasta, is made on the premises and their most popular dishes seem to be their pastas, for which the pasta is freshly handmade each day. But I ordered the sandwiches and they were sensational. I loved the Cubano and they do a wonderful hamburger  in fact, it might be one of the best hamburgers in Delhi except for Jatins classic version at Tres. I am going to try the pastas next.This is the sort of restaurant that Delhi needs, small, family-run, artisanal, everything house-made and lots of love and care in cooking the food.Hanisha Singh and her husband Jamsheed Bhotes forte is artisanryI wrote last week about an Indian gin. Well, Bengal Bay is an Indian tonic water. The company was founded in 2018 by Rishabh Gupta and his basic tonic has notes of sweet orange and cardamom and is sweetened with organic cane sugar. It adds a different dimension to your gin.As I said four weeks ago: there is just so much talent and enterprise out there that I am constantly amazed by the range of the newly-emerging food and beverage sector. And especially by the guys who dont usually get written about.From HT Brunch, August 30, 2020Follow us on twitter.com/HTBrunchConnect with us on facebook.com/hindustantimesbrunch",MUSTARD OIL

I am not able to sell five quintal of turmeric as no local trader is ready to give me above 40 per kg, said Kiabisi Majhi of Mundibali village under Tumudibandh block of Kandhamal.Like Mr. Majhi, a majority of the turmeric farmers have failed to sell their produce as its procurement price has nosedived in Kandhamal, a region where farmer suicides are hardly heard.In many interior villages, farmers have not even been approached by local traders. Those who were in urgent need of cash had no choice, but to sell turmeric at throwaway price of 30 to 35 per kg, said Raja Karna, a farmer of Bandhaguda village in Firingia block of the district.Unscrupulous tradersTaking advantage of the COVID-19 restrictions, unscrupulous traders have been quoting per kg turmeric price at below 40 whereas Kandhamal Apex Spices Association for Marketing (KASAM), the government-backed cooperative agency, offers 60 per kg.With more than 60% of the geographical area covered with hills and forest, Kandhamal offers suitable agroclimatic condition for cultivation of various spices mainly turmeric, ginger, mustard and tamarind.Kandhamal Haladi for which GI tag has been received is a pure organic product. Tribals grow the herbs without applying fertiliser or pesticide. The aromatic value and golden yellow colour of Kandhamal Haladi make it different from the rest.The cultivation begins in the summer months of April and May and the harvest is during December to February. The raw turmeric is then boiled and sun-dried.For 60,000 families, turmeric is the only cash crop with the collective production exceeding 26,000 tonnes annually in the district. Around March when farmers were getting ready to sell their produce, the nation went into lockdown in the wake of the pandemic.Of around 26,000 turmeric produced in Kandhamal, we procure only 5,000 tonnes which is roughly around 20% of production. Traders from other districts and States buy turmeric directly from farmers who are mostly tribals, said KASAM secretary Sanjit Patnaik.The restriction in vehicular movement and fear of contracting the infection prevented outside traders from visiting Kandhamal this year. According to Mr. Patnaik, KASAM which by now procures 600-1,000 tonnes of turmeric has purchased only 300-400 tonnes.Third party testsThe turmeric procurement was also hit as the third party tests which was required for certification of Kandhamal Haladi being organic product were not carried out due to lockdown. Although Kandhamal Haladi is exported to other States and countries, farmers will not get value of products due disruption in procurement.Despite turmeric of previous year remaining unsold, farmers have already advanced into another turmeric cultivation season.Turmeric, which needs low input cost for farming, is an important cash crop for farmers in Kandhamal. While paddy farming, collection of forest produces and millet cultivation take care of food requirement, farmers meet other expenses from the turmeric farming. COVID-19 has hit farmers badly this year, said Kailash Dandapat, a Daringbadi-based social activist.The State governments intervention was urgently required at a time when farmers were facing a scenario of distress sale, said Mr. Dandapat.",MUSTARD OIL

Balraj, a member of the Irula adivasi community in Aracode near Kil Kotagiri, is among 50 former daily wage workers in his village to take up farming once again. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, many adivasis, working as daily wage workers in tea estates, coffee plantations and farms, have found it difficult to find work. So many of us are now returning to farm our lands which were left fallow for the last few years, said Mr. Balraj.One of the beneficiaries of an initiative undertaken by the Keystone Foundation in Kotagiri, Mr. Balraj is among 1,335 farmers in the Nilgiris, who are being provided assistance to reclaim their traditional farmlands to cultivate millets.Robert Leo, adviser to the Keystone Foundation, said that the farmers possess knowledge of traditional, organic farming practices, and have been provided with a millet seed package, comprising seven kg of foxtail millet, little millet and finger millet. Alongside other crops, such as amaranthus, mustard and varieties of vegetables, the farmers are being encouraged to take up mixed farming that is ecologically friendly, added Mr. Leo.The millets fields are inter cropped in patches with maize, beans, chilli, tomatoes, pumpkins, pigeon peas and different kinds of green leafy vegetables and tubers, said S. Bhojan, a member of the Irula adivasi community living in a village in Bokkapuram in the Mudumalai Tiger Reserve. The village is among a number of Irula and Kurumba communities being supported by the Keystone Foundation in Kotagiri, Coonoor and the Sigur plateau.Many members of the community were dependent on the tourism industry to earn their living, said Mr. Bhojan. As the resorts have had to close down due to the COVID-19 pandemic, many were out of work, he added. According to him, more than a hundred people in the Sigur alone have started farming anywhere between half an acre and one acre of their existing lands. Most of these lands had been lying fallow, despite the fact that our communities had been given title deeds to them under the Forest Rights Act, said Mr. Bhojan.The community members said that they will use the millets to help feed their families and also trade with other communities for other goods.The incorporation of millets into the diet of adivasi communities will help keep them healthy, said Mr. Robert Leo. As most adivasis have come to rely on the Public Distribution System for their nutritional requirements, they have gradually moved away from consuming crops and foodstuffs that they would grow traditionally. By encouraging them to grow millets and other crops, we hope to also get them to eat a more balanced, nutritious diet, he added.",MUSTARD OIL

He also urged the state government department and the agencies concerned to take appropriate measures to prevent any unpleasant incidence due to consumption of adulterated mustard oil.A statement by the premier defence lab said that Argemone mexicana seeds contain 22-36% of pale yellow non-edible oil, called Argemone oil or katkar oil, which contains the toxic alkaloids sanguinarine and dihydrosanguinarine, making it unsafe for human consumption. It is therefore advised in the public interest that all the consumers must be aware of this danger while purchasing mustard oil from the market. The use of adulterated mustard oil is not recommended for consumption because it may result in serious health issues. All other related agencies may take appropriate measures to prevent any unpleasant incidence due to consumption of adulterated mustard oil, stated the advisory issued by scientist Ashok Naglot from DRL.Even as the analyzed samples were collected from Tezpur, one of the investigators said there was a high possibility of such stocks present in markets in the northeast as well as some other parts of the country. The northeastern states are highly dependent on factories from western India for procurement of mustard oil consignments to cater its needs.The seeds resemble the seeds of Brassica nigra (mustard). As a result, mustard can easily be adulterated by argemone seeds, rendering it poisonous. Several significant instances of katkar poisoning have been reported in India in the past. Even one percent adulteration of mustard oil by argemone oil has been shown to cause clinical disease,"" he said.According to the investigators, in India, Argemone oil is mixed with sunflower oil and sesame oil to increase the quantity. As this adulteration causes health disorders, many of the renowned brands display no argemone oil to show purity.",MUSTARD OIL

Although only three deaths have been reported, doctors fear the toll to be much higher because diagnosing the disease is difficult. There is no treatment for the disease so far. However, some patients have shown dramatic recovery when treated with heart disease medicine.UN On TradeA UN document has cautioned against the rise wave of protectionism in developing countries.

Since years mustard oil is known as a culinary favourite due to its distinctive taste and nutritional value. For Indian chefs it is an oil that they have loved and seen in their kitchen since childhood. Im from Bihar, so mustard oil dominated all our dishes and I love it for its distinctive taste and the flavour it adds to many dishes such as fish and chicken. A roasted chicken or salad can be made interesting by using mustard oil, says celebrity chef Amrita Raichand.On the other hand, as we were barricaged by the lockdown, many grasped the rudiments of cooking, and realised that the oil is a versatile one. It made its way to every kitchen. It works wonders with South-eastern dishes and Indonasian food as well. Thai curries can be made fun by using this oil, says chef Nishant Choubey. He also tells us that the oil is great for frying and very economical as well. Mustard oil doesnt break off easily - the contents dont split easily while cooking - so one can use it atleast 3 times after deep frying once, adds Choubey.A tip that chefs urge all to follow while cooking in mustard oil is to heat the oil to its smoking point - the point when it starts to emit whiffs of white smoke, which is a sign of purity and quality - as it is less carcinogenic that many other oils.",MUSTARD OIL

(Source: Getty Images)PCOS or Polycystic Ovary Syndrome is one of the most common hormonal disorders in women. In India, almost one out of every five women suffer from it. However, due to lack of awareness, a majority of women who endure this ailment remain unaware of it, said Aarti Gill, co-founder OZiva, adding that it is extremely important to draw sufficient attention towards PCOS and its effects.While there is no cure, the symptoms of PCOS can be managed by adopting a clean and holistic lifestyle. Obesity is a common finding in women with PCOS, and between 4080 per cent of women with this condition are reported to be overweight or obese according to an NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information) study, she added.Below, take a look at a comprehensive guide for you to mitigate PCOS.READ| Count on these handy tips to prevent and manage the polycystic ovarian syndromePCOS is also one of the major causes of infertility among women. (Source: Getty Images) PCOS is also one of the major causes of infertility among women. (Source: Getty Images)Make sure to eat a balanced dietEating a well-balanced diet is a must to manage PCOS. Not only that, but it is also important to ensure that you consume a protein-rich diet to control the bodys resistance towards insulin. Gill suggested choosing healthy sources of protein that do not increase cholesterol levels such as tofu, beans, lentils, seeds, nuts, etc. It is also important to steer clear of simple carbs and opt for complex carbs instead. Choose whole grains and low glycemic foods such as whole wheat, whole oats, brown rice or even quinoa, she said. They are enriched with fibre which helps manage insulin resistance, a major contributor to PCOS.Make sure you consume at least 1-2 servings of whole fruits and vegetables daily. Also, make sure to eat foods rich in omega-3 such as walnuts, flax seeds, chia seeds and healthy fats such as olive oil, mustard oil which help in reducing the inflammation caused by insulin resistance and obesity, suggested Gill.Ditch dairyAvoid consuming milk and milk products if you have PCOS as they tend to trigger insulin and testosterone levels in the body which can cause serious bouts of acne, said Gill. Not only that, but even coffee is also a big no-no for women with PCOS. Gill said: It is widely believed to worsen PCOS by catalyzing estrogen production during menstruation which leads to hormonal imbalance.Say yes to AyurvedaPlant-based foods are a great way to manage PCOS and also for overall health. Ashwagandha and tulsi both help in correcting irregular menstrual cycles, obesity, infertility, blood sugar, and weight gain by decreasing the cortisol levels in the body, she said.Another important component is green tea. This is highly beneficial because of its anti-inflammatory properties. Additionally, cinnamon and curcumin are both soothing and useful as cinnamon regulates the menstrual cycle and reduces insulin resistance while curcumin, an active pigment in turmeric, is highly anti-inflammatory and also improves insulin resistance, added Gill.READ| How Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is diet drivenWorking out is necessaryThis goes without saying. Make sure you work out for at least half an hour every day. Not only does it set your mood right but also helps in managing insulin resistance. Gill suggests that one can go for any form of cardio like skipping, brisk walking or even running. When you lose excess weight, your metabolism heightens and keeps the body healthy, says Gill.For more lifestyle news, follow us: Twitter: lifestyle_ie | Facebook: IE Lifestyle | Instagram: ie_lifestyle The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

On a mundane weekday, its food that has me excited. I eagerly track my order as it makes its way to me from the home chef who has become my favourite. Once here, the strong aroma of butter chicken  neatly packed in ecofriendly boxes  fills the room. As I unwrap the foil paper, I find the rotis greased with ghee. The mint chutney and pickled onions complete the meal.A personal note that reads Just the way you like it and pinned to the brown bag works just as well as any I love you! For thats what you are assured in this exchange with home chefs right? A slice of home and some personal kindness  even if its a standard text note. Amid the chaos of the pandemic, home chefs have managed to keep us fed and contribute to morale like never before.Even when the restaurant industry and successful businesses were forced to pause, it was home chefs  with no institutional degree or financial backing  who kept the show going, banking on just instincts and personal experience. Some for passion, and others for survival; from changing their priorities and addressing hygiene concerns to curating new menus and reinventing sales strategies, they have been doing it all. CE catches up with eight enterprising home chefs who have been whipping up regional cuisines in kitchens birthed by the pandemic.DILLI KANTEENMira Srinivasan had always envisioned starting a little kitchen project. It wasnt till two months into the lockdown, when the workfrom- home routine seemed to suck away all pleasure from life, that she got to put her foot down and embark on the passion plan. Dilli Kanteen became a reality in early August  born out of her love for north Indian cuisine. She rolls out the days menu on her Instagram page Mylapore Filter Coffee and it gets sold within hours. Rajma chawal, parathas, langar wali dal, bedmi poori with aloo  name it and she will get them delivered with mint chutney and pickled onions, just like in a dhaba. Growing up in Delhi and tasting all kinds of street food, I was confident about pulling o f f the local flavours. We had multiple dry-runs with friends and family. Now, theres been a good response from across age groups, especially from those whove been craving authentic Delhi food. While I do the cooking, my husband handles the packaging and coordinates with Dunzo, says the Thiruvanmiyur resident. She wears a mask and gloves, and cleans the kitchen twice.

What started with a small snacks menu developed into a full-fledged offering with starter, curry, main dish, and dessert options. The menu is made available on Instagram. The recipes are that of Nazeenas grandmother. Nobody goes to Ambur and returns without devouring a plateful of mutton biryani. We wanted our patrons to taste some of the close-guarded recipes. Looks like theres demand, say the Kilpauk residents. Their gulab jamun and kheer are big hits. Our flaky samosa with non-veg filling is a win.

Thanks to Naavaai Virundhu, all this is possible from the comfort of your home. Friends Gita Ganesh and Roselin Libiya have attempted to deliver Ramanathapuram cuisine. Their kitchen started accepting orders from last week. We have tried and tested four menus. Unlike Chettinadu or Kongu cuisine, Ramanathapuram food is not popular in the city. The flavours are distinct and the seafood is freshly procured for the day. For instance, the kuzhambu has less of coconut and is less sour compared to the conventional ones, reveals Gita, who handles the marketing while Roselin does the cooking in her house in Manapakkam. The kitchen offers a full meal, comprising traditional dishes of squid, prawn, fish, crab (predominantly seafood). The masalas are hand-pound and the oil, cold-pressed. With relaxations, we will be offering a new menu twice a week. People trust us because we cook the same food for our families. The ingredients and hygiene are looked after. Its a sizable menu at an affordable price, assures Gita. The kitchen has tied up with a third-party for delivery.

It was her flair for hosting memorable dinners for friends and family in Mumbai that got her into the world of catering. I had plenty of time in hand after moving to Chennai and so started catering to daily meal orders. Ive hosted pop-up tables at my house and in restaurants. Everything came to a standstill with the pandemic, narrates the Velachery resident. Yet, she could sit tight for only so long; Joydrita started Joys Weekend Indulgence soon after restaurants reopened for takeaways. Doi murgi, chingri bhapa, kosha mangsho and more became household names. There arent many Bengali joints in the city. People also have a common misconception that we use mustard in everything and only eat seafood. Ive included vegetarian options to bust the myth. Thankfully, I have my pantry stocked with ingredients sourced from Bengal. If we can all uphold the recipes of our mothers and grandparents and pass it on to the world, then nothing like it, says Joy, who uploads her menu on her Instagram page Tales of a Glutton, and on WhatsApp. She delivers to a limited number of 20 per menu, on a first-come-first served basis.

Mom does the cooking, dad helps with cleaning, peeling, and chopping, and I manage the social media marketing. Mom was, earlier, into small-scale catering for party orders but it turned into full-time business since the lockdown, says Najla. Mutton mandi, chicken majboos, tandoori chicken, shami and samosas have been going out in repeat orders. I grew up in Kuwait. Mom would go restauranthopping or try out the street food. She had the knack of replicating the same at home. She knows the middle-eastern cuisine inside out. Its encouraging to see many home chefs trying to generate income with what they know.

It helps the stomach release acids that aid digestion. It is also rich in antioxidants that enable proper absorption of minerals and vitamins from other foods and thus make the immune system healthy. Ghee is loaded with a fair amount of butyric acid, which is a beneficial fatty acid that has anti-viral qualities.ButterReally! As long as you are using natural, unprocessed or homemade butter. If you must buy, try to choose organic butter that comes from grass-fed and pasteurised cows. Butter is a fantastic source of healthy fats and contains a compound called Activator X, that not only enhances the absorption of nutrients but also protects against numerous diseases.Extra Virgin Olive OilLow on polyunsaturated fats and packed in monounsaturated fats, extra virgin olive oil can be an excellent pick for cold recipes and salad dressings. Be aware that olive oil, even when cold-pressed has a low smoke point. Therefore, ensure to cook your food at low temperature when using olive oil to prevent it from oxidising. Always choose extra virgin olive oils that come in dark packages as even light can oxidise them.Cold Pressed Mustard OilMustard oil is rich in essential fatty acids and natural antioxidants. They are both required to maintain a healthy heart. The oil is loaded with monounsaturated fatty acids and also reduces bad cholesterol while promoting good cholesterol. Mustard oil contains ample amount of omega 3 and other essential fatty acids that are required by the body for healthy functioning. It is also easily affordable and widely available.Cold Pressed Sesame OilSesame oils are made with sesame seeds and have a high smoke point, which makes them perfect for cooking. Apart from being a storehouse of health, they are also much more flavourful when compared to vegetable oil. However, some people refrain from using it in baking projects due to its strong flavour. Also, ensure that you are not allergic to sesame before replacing your vegetable oil with this one.Cold Pressed Groundnut OilGroundnut oil or peanut oil has a significant concentration of monounsaturated fats. It is also low in saturated fats. It imparts a light flavour and is suitable for cooking. It works incredibly well for Asian dishes that are made in a wok.

Excerpts:How is the Farmers Produce Trade & Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020, passed in the Lok Sabha, going to affect the functioning of mandis? What is the Rajasthan governments plan for utilisation of 2% farmers welfare cess, as the traders had recently observed a strike against its imposition?The Bill will restrict the application of the Rajasthan Agricultural Produce Markets Act, 1961, to the physical boundaries of mandis and sub-yards managed and run by the market committees formed under the law. The warehouses, silos, cold storages or other structures notified as deemed markets will also feel the impact in addition to the direct collection centres and farmer-consumer yards managed by persons holding licences. The market fee and cess will come down sharply in the coming years, adversely affecting mandis and various welfare measures for agriculturalists. The 2% cess was imposed to facilitate ease of doing farming and boost financial resources on a sustainable basis. It will be utilised for activities such as post-harvest management, market intervention and pledge loan scheme.How did the COVID-19 lockdown affect the agriculture sector in Rajasthan and what issues did the farmers face in the harvesting of crops and selling their agricultural produce in mandis?The lockdown made a negligible impact on the agriculture sector though there were difficulties in smooth movement of crop harvesting machinery during its initial stage. Agriculture input shops and machine part shops were allowed to remain open and mandis were also exempted from the lockdown. Farmers were able to sell their produce close to their fields with new mandis being opened and direct purchase licences being issued.Has the situation of farmers improved during the gradual opening of markets in various phases of unlock? What steps is the State government taking for strengthening the rural economy and protecting the livelihood of farmers?The gradual opening of lockdown has helped in getting agricultural labourers and reviving the market, especially for perishable farm commodities like fruits, vegetables and flowers. The State government has provided 8.1 lakh maize and 8.2 lakh pearl millet minikits to farmers free of cost during the kharif season. Through a tie-up with Tractors and Farm Equipment Limited, rent-free equipment was provided to small and marginal farmers. The time limit for repayment of short-term cooperative loans for both kharif and rabi crops has been extended.Was the procurement of wheat, gram and mustard up to the expected levels in the State this year and have the farmers received remunerative prices for their produce?A record procurement of wheat and black gram at minimum support prices has been achieved this year. Against the Central governments target of 21.24 lakh tonnes of wheat, 22.25 lakh tonnes were procured from 2.19 lakh farmers, who were paid 4,282 crore. Similarly, 6.16 lakh tonnes of gram was procured from 2.38 lakh farmers and 3,001 crore were paid to them. The procurement of rapeseed and mustard, at 3.47 lakh tonnes, was less because of the market price of the commodity being higher than the MSP. For 2020-21, the procurement agencies have registered the farmers and allotted the dates as per the Price Support Schemes guidelines.The locust attacks in May and June caused heavy losses to the farmers who were already suffering from the impact of the lockdown. How many districts were affected, which crops were destroyed and how did the State government support the farmers?We were prepared well in advance for the locust attack and each district had prepared its locust control and management plan, which included resource mapping for availability of tractors, tractor-mounted sprayers, jeeps, etc. More than 200 survey teams were put on job for surveying the locusts, while over 800 tractor-mounted sprayers, 40 to 50 fire tenders, 100 sprayers from Locust Warning Organisation and a helicopter and drones were pressed into service. There was a little damage to the cotton crop initially, but the locusts were fully controlled with intensive efforts. There are no locusts in Rajasthan for the last 15 days.Have the flagship schemes like the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana benefited the farmers and is the State government satisfied with the Centres help to address agricultural distress?More than 1 crore farmers in the State have benefited from the PMFBY since 2016, with claims worth 10,700 crore having been paid to them. In the revamped scheme, the Central government has capped its previous share of premium subsidy in the ratio of 50:50 to only 25% in irrigated areas and 30% in unirrigated areas. Because of this, the State government has to pay 138 crore more than the Centre for insurance of kharif crops in 2020.Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot has laid emphasis on connecting the farmers with the industry and increasing their income. How will you help the farmers in this respect and promote value addition in agriculture?The Rajasthan Agro-Processing, Agri-Business and Agri-Export Promotion Policy, 2019, has been formulated keeping in mind the development of supply and value chains with special emphasis on a cluster-based approach. Apart from individual farmers, farmer producer organisations will be formed to extend the benefit of collective bargaining in procuring inputs and selling the produce. The 50% subsidy provision for aggregation and collection centres, packhouse, warehouse, cold storage, reefer van, etc., will strengthen the supply chain. Similar facilities for processing units will enable them to harness the benefits of value addition in terms of higher prices of produce.What are the salient features of this policy and how does it propose to evolve a vibrant connection between the farmers and industry for improving their economic conditions?Since the inception of the policy, the proposals for 137 projects with an investment of about 250 crore have been received till the first week of September. Of them, 53 proposals with a subsidy of 18.12 crore have been sanctioned. The policy financially supports farmers and their organisations with the capital subsidy at 50%, subject to a maximum of 1 crore, and interest subsidy at 6% per annum on bank loans. Also, operational expenses and reimbursement of electricity tariff for five years are provided to the beneficiaries. This is a comprehensive policy formulated to harness the potential available for developing supply chains and value addition to various products of agriculture and allied sectors.",MUSTARD OIL

Agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar announced the hike in Lok Sabha.The new MSP rates, announced earlier than usual, come amid widespread protests by opposition parties and farmer groups in Punjab and Haryana, after Parliament passed two key farm bills on Sunday. Earlier in the day, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in a video address, said opponents of the farm-sector reforms were misleading farmers, saying the government would continue to buy farmers produce at MSP rates.MSPs are federally fixed prices for farm produce aimed at preventing distress sale. The government buys largely rice and wheat at these prices through its procurement system.For the upcoming winter-sown season, the highest increase in MSP was announced for lentil (a jump of Rs 300 a quintal) followed by gram and rapeseed and mustard (Rs 225 a quintal each) and safflower (Rs 112 a quintal). The Cabinet approved an increase of Rs 75 a quintal and Rs 50 a quintal for barley and wheat.At these new MSP rates for key winter crops, farmers would get 106% return over cost of cultivation for wheat, 65% return over costs for barley, and 78% returns over cultivation costs for lentil (masoor) and gram, and 98% return over costs for mustard.In absolute terms, wheat MSP for 2021-22 stands at Rs 1,975 a quintal, up from Rs 1,925 in the previous year. Similarly, the MSP for lentil stands at Rs 5,100, higher than Rs 4,800 during 2020-21. The MSP for mustard was hiked to Rs 4,650 from Rs 4,425 earlier.The differential remuneration (varying hikes in MSP) is aimed at encouraging crop diversification. This increase in MSP is in line with the recommendations of the Swaminathan Commission, a Cabinet note said.Earlier in the day, in a speech aimed at putting a lid on concerns of farmers groups, Modi said the existing agricultural state-regulated mandis (also known as agricultural produce market committees or APMCs) would continue to function. He also said the government would continue to buy farm produce at MSP rates.APMCs will not shut down. The new laws are not against mandis and I also want to assure the country that the government will continue to buy farm produce at minimum support prices in every (farm marketing) season, the PM had said.Parliament on Sunday passed The Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020, which aims to ease all restrictions on trade of agriculture produce. The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020, also passed on Sunday, lays down a new architecture for contract farming in the country so that agribusiness and farmers can engage with one another more confidently, enable modern supply chains and investments by agribusinesses in cultivation.Some farmer groups want the government to write MSP into the new act.Our demand is to make MSP a legal right.

302,302.0,,,2020-09-21,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/govt-hikes-msps-of-six-rabi-crops-pulses-and-oilseeds-get-preference-over-wheat/articleshow/78241882.cms,"NEW DELHI: A day after passage of two crucial farm Bills in the Parliament amid opposition pandemonium and allegations that farmer interests were being sacrificed, the Centre in Lok Sabha on Monday announced hikes in minimum support prices (MSPs) of six Rabi crops ranging from 2% to 6% with lentils (pulses) and mustard (oilseed) getting the highest increases.The announcement of new MSPs much ahead of beginning of the Rabi sowing season is seen as an attempt by the government to allay doubts from minds of farmers over the future of the support price in the wake of passing of the two farm Bills  one on Agri market and the other on contract farming. Some farm organisations and many opposition parties have taken up the issue, with BJP's long-time partner Akali Dal even quitting the cabinet over the issue.Records of the past 12 years show that the government had not made an announcement of MSPs for Rabi crops in September. The prices were either announced in October or later in November or even December. Once the MSP rates were announced as late as almost the end of the Rabi sowing season on January 29 in 2009 during UPA-I. The price signal for pulses and oilseeds is intended to reduce the traditional skew in favour of cereals which will still deliver highest returns overall.The timing of the announcement was clearly politically significant. The Opposition members are spreading misinformation about MSP. They have been saying that the new legislation will end the MSP system. I want to tell the farmers through these new MSPs that the system will stay, agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar told TOI after making announcement of new rates in Lok Sabha.He earlier told the House that the announcement is a proof of governments commitment towards continuation of the MSP-based procurement system and slammed the Opposition for spreading rumours. The reforms envisaged in the bills aim to provide farmers options other than APMC procurement and also facilitate leasing of land for contract farming. Government has said the Bills increase farmer choice and reduce the role of middlemen. But given the close linkages between middlemen -- who function as informal bankers -- and farmers in states like Punjab and Haryana, the Bills have given rise to apprehensions that the government is seeking to assuage.Analysis of the new MSPs shows the governments focus on pulses and oilseeds. The MSP for lentils (pulses) got the highest hike of 6.3% - from Rs 4,800 per quintal in 2019-20 to Rs 5,100 per quintal in 2020-21  followed by mustard (5.1%), Barley (4.9%), Gram (4.6%), wheat (2.6%) and safflower (2.1%). The procurement on the basis of these MSPs will be made in the marking season of 2021-22, beginning April 1.The MSP announcement gives a price signal to farmers ahead of the sowing season so that they can make the right choice of crop. The new MSPs were approved by the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA), chaired by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi. This increase in MSP is in line with the recommendations of Swaminathan Commission, claimed the agriculture ministry in a statement.In view of nutritional requirements and changing dietary pattern and to achieve self-sufficiency in pulses and oilseeds production, the government has fixed relatively higher MSP for these crops, said the ministry adding the differential remuneration is aimed at encouraging crop diversification.The increase in MSP for 2020-21 Rabi Crops for the marketing season of 2021-22 is in line with the principle of fixing the MSPs at a level of at least 1.5 times of the all-India weighted average cost of production as announced in Union Budget 2018-19.The expected returns to farmers over their cost of production are estimated to be highest in case of Wheat (106%) followed by rapeseed & mustard (93%), gram and lentil (78%). For barley, return to farmers over their cost of production is estimated at 65% and for safflower, it is 50%.The cost of production for arriving at new MSPs includes all paid out costs such as those incurred on account of hired human labour, bullock labour/machine labour, rent paid for leased in land, expenses incurred on use of material inputs like seeds, fertilizers, manures, irrigation charges, depreciation on implements and farm buildings, interest on working capital, diesel/electricity for operation of pump sets etc, miscellaneous expenses and imputed value of family labour.",MUSTARD OIL

(Photo: LSTV/PTI)IN THE face of intensifying protests against its contentious farm Bills ahead of the Bihar elections, the Government and the BJP have kickstarted a campaign to counter Opposition claims that the laws are anti-farmer.In the Lok Sabha Monday, Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar announced an increase in Minimum Support Price (MSP) for six rabi crops. He said the decision proves the Government is committed to retaining the MSP mechanism and clearing the lie spread by the Opposition.The decision was read out on the floor of the House and followed by a press conference by three Union Ministers, Ravi Shankar Prasad, Piyush Goyal and Pralhad Joshi. The MSP of wheat has been increased by Rs 50 per quintal, barley by Rs 75, gram (chana) by Rs 225, lentil (masur) by Rs 300, rapeseed & mustard by Rs 225, and safflower by Rs 112.I want to tell farmers that when the Bills for agrarian reforms came, Congressmen across the country said that after their passage, the MSP will be abolished and APMC will be abolished. I want to tell the country that the MSP will continue, the APMC will continue, Tomar told Lok Sabha.Tomars announcement came hours after Prime Minister Narendra Modi reiterated, during a virtual address at a foundation event for highway projects in Bihar, that the Farm laws were historic and necessary.Taking a swipe at the Congress, he said: After these historic changes in the agriculture sector, after such a big system change, some people saw that it is slipping out of their grip. So now, these people are trying to mislead farmers on MSP.This was the second time in three days that Modi has hailed the contentious Bills and criticised the Opposition while addressing events in poll-bound Bihar.On Monday, three Congress MPs  Gurjeet Singh Aujla, Jasbir Singh Gill and Ravneet Singh Bittu  rushed out of their seats as Tomar made the announcement and shouted slogans against the Government. Aujla tore papers and flung them in the air before walking out in protest.The BJP, meanwhile, has launched a massive drive to counter criticism that the two Bills  The Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill 2020 and the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill  are against the interests of farmers.Following widespread protests by farmers in Punjab and Haryana, and the resignation of SAD leader Harsimrat Kaur Badal from the Union Cabinet, the party has asked its MPs, leaders and functionaries to go on the offensive and explain the salient features of the Bills, sources said.Incidentally, during its first term too, the Government had to counter charges of being anti-farmer when it tried to push the Land Acquisition Bills during its first term  the Bills were dropped due to protests.After the SAD move, Tomar has met separate groups to explain the provisions of the Bills and highlight those that the government believes would benefit farmers. The Agriculture Minister also met BJP functionaries, including Ministers and leaders in and around Punjab, and urged them to go on the offensive against the Oppositions criticism.Tomar also held a virtual meeting with agriculture ministers of BJP-ruled states, spokespersons at the national and state levels, and officebearers of the Bharatiya Kisan Sangh and Swadeshi Jagaran Manch  two RSS affiliates that have protested against the Bill. Tomar held another meeting with MPs on the Bills provisions.BJP Parliamentary Secretary Balasubrahmanyam Kamarsu has distributed campaign material for the MPs on the Bills. Besides, all party leaders including ministers have been asked to use Twitter to push the Bills, sources said.After the MSP announcement, BJP chief J P Nadda tweeted: The central government has not only increased the MSP but also increased the purchase on the MSP to ensure the remuneration value of the farmers.

How long could this be allowed to go on? It was necessary to change this system and our government has shown these changes, he said, adding that recommendations of the Swaminathan Committee calling for liberalisation of trade in agricultural products had been shoved into the deep freezer because of the resistance of vested interests.The PM also rebutted the allegation that the reforms measures would spell the dismantling of the scheme to provide minimum support price for farmers and the existing mandis under Agricultural Produce Marketing Committees His hard-hitting remarks came during his speech at a web-based function to mark the laying of optical fibre network and launch of highway projects in poll-bound Bihar and just a few hours before the government announced an increase in MSP for Rabi crops: the near-overlap being seen as meant to be a refutation of the allegation of MSP's demise.Modi also said how during the coronavirus pandemic, record purchase of wheat was made from farmers and over Rs 1 lakh crore was given to farmers at MSP, which was more than 30% over last year.He said the old laws dealing with the system of production and sale of farm produce rendered farmers captive of mandis and stressed that they would now have the option to sell their produce to anyone at any rate and anywhere he wished to.Now, he has got many more options besides the mandi of his area. Now, if he gets more profit in the market, then he will go to the market and sell his crop. Apart from mandi, if you get a profit elsewhere, then you will go there and sell, it will be possible due to the freedom from all bonds, he said.The PM dismissed as lie that mandis would become extinct in the wake of the reforms. ""They will continue to operate as usual,"" he said as he emphasised the efforts under his government to improve the functioning of APMCs with computerisation.He said the soon-to-be-enacted laws started giving benefits since being promulgated as ordinances and gave the example of bulk buyers of potatoes sourcing their requirements directly from cold storages.He added that ground reports from Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan showed that oil mills there had purchased mustard by giving 20-30% more directly to farmers. Similarly, in Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and West Bengal, farmers had received 15-25% more price for pulses than last year directly, he said.",MUSTARD OIL

However, the results were downright embarrassing: unsold inventory, high trade spends, wasted advertising money and managers scuttling for cover. It was so bad that it caused the then-CEO to pose the imminent question: What was the consumer insight?Trupti Bhandari(top);Arvind BhandariThere is a market for premium cooking oil, if we look at the local products in the retail shelves Somebody attempted an unconvincing answer.What was the CONSUMER insight?That consumers are looking for first pressed kachi ghani mustard oil. Another futile explanation followed.Really, and what will they do with it? How much extra will they pay for it? What is the cost of a cooking dish with this oil versus normal oil  A volley of questions were fired, ending with, Did someone check with the consumer? This was followed by a resounding silence.Consumer insight can be the road to glory or perdition. Developing capabilities to build consumer insight, however tedious, is an absolute must for all marketers. It links the need to the benefit. In doing so, it delivers two things: it clarifies the need-gap to consumers and facilitates the correct situating of the product; and it sets up the right expectation so that benefits are in consonance with the delivery of the product.The inevitable result is consumer delight.Then, What was the consumer insight? neednt be a post-mortem question but a pre-birth inquiry.What does the consumer really want? If this question could be answered in its entirety, business would be an effortless win. Without it, business is a relentless misery. But stepping into the consumers shoes to understand her latent, patent, exploited or abandonable demand takes the mickey out of the most seasoned professionals. But before the fishing net is tossed to catch the fish, one has to know what to ask and how to elicit the answer. It doesnt help matters that the gamut of research methodologies is so wide and sometimes so ambiguous that even with good intentions, marketers could make errors in solving the riddle of what the consumer really wants.We pulled back to simplify what the research is triggered by so that marketers can ask the right question and seek the right answer, while avoiding expensive mistakes. Here is what it boils down to:What is the consumer doing?Why is she doing that  what is her motivation?What is her attitude towards a category/brand/issue?What will be her reaction to my products and concepts that she sees in the future?Lets understand the gamut of research methodologies to know what to ask and how, but after considering all the options. Often, research decisions are made not knowing the options available, leading to expensive mistakes down the line.Excerpted fromPragmarketism: Pragmatic Marketing Insights for Winning Indian Consumers by Trupti Bhandari and Arvind Bhandari, with permission from HarperCollins",MUSTARD OIL

Here is one you can tryPacked with nutrition, microgreens are fast gaining popularity. And a growing tribe of health conscious individuals are trying their hand at growing these superfoods in kitchen gardens during the pandemic.While being a plant parent can be challenging, microgreens need little space to grow. They are small plants in the next stage of sprouting, when the first leaves develop from the seed. If you have a windowsill or balcony that gets a few hours of sunshine every day, you are good to go, says Visakhapatnam-based S Ravi Kanth Reddy, founder of the NGO Mother Earth Environmental Consciousness Society (MEECONS), and who is an advocate of sustainable living.Wheatgrass | Photo Credit: Special arrangementRecently, Ravi Kanth and his wife Naga Vijaya, released a video on Vijayas Healthy Home on YouTube. The video showed how to grow microgreens through hydroponics, showing the time-lapse of the growth of such greens. These superfoods contain abundant Vitamin C, E and anti-oxidants, and are far more nutritious than the adult leafy versions. These are ideal to throw onto a salad or sandwich. You can also garnish a dish with a dash of microgreens, says Ravi Kanth.What to keep in mind When using cocopeat and soil, microgreens should be grown in flat surfaces, like a tray or cardboard box with drainage holes, that can hold up to two inches of soil.Spray water daily to keep it moist especially during the first two-three days of the germination stage.Microgreens taste best when fresh but can be refrigerated for a couple of days.The tender greens can be used as a nutritious side dish, added to smoothies or as colourful topping to salads.Use seeds that are untreated with any chemical.Good quality soil and cocopeat, which are chemical free, ensure that microgreens grow well.Be careful not to overwater them.Besides being healthy, they are also simple to grow. They dont need a lot of light and can be grown in four to six days. So, there is no fretting about fertilising, repoting, or pruning, he explains. And more importantly, these greens are completely organic as you would be growing them without pesticides or fertilisers. Seeds like those of fenugreek, wheat, green gram and mustard take just two to three days to germinate. Preparing the seed is the first step in growing microgreens. For the initial 24 hours, the seeds need to be placed in a darker place before shifting them to a bright spot, says Ravi Kanth.Process of choiceHe used the hydroponic method which he says can be an alternative to cocopeat and soil, as these may not be easily accessible everywhere during the pandemic. I used a stainless steel sieve, which is usually available at every household, to grow microgreens hydroponically. Wash the seeds well; spread them on the sieve and place it above a container with water; spray water twice a day and cover with a lid. Follow the process for two to three days till you see tiny leaves coming out, he says, adding, After this, shift the sieve along with container to a brighter spot. But do not cover it. In six days time, you are good to go and harvest it.",MUSTARD OIL

It provides you with the energy to strive through the day. Keeping in mind the busy and hectic lifestyle we lead; the significance of a healthy breakfast amplifies.However, most of us are always in rush and grab a bite or two of some snacks or eat a fruit for breakfast, which certainly isnt enough. Here are some healthy breakfast options that you can try.1. Dal ka parantha: If you have some leftover dal from last nights meal, your task of preparing breakfast becomes easier. Just mix the remaining dal with wheat flour. Add salt and pepper, chopped coriander leaves, 2 green chillies and 1 tsp of carom seeds. Knead this into soft dough and make paranthas from this mixture.2. Moong dal cheela: Moong dal is low on carbs and can be consumed daily in different meals of the day. If you wish to include it in your breakfast, that too in a tasty way, make moong dal cheela. Soak 1 cup of moong dal overnight. In the morning, rinse it and grind it into a smooth paste. Add salt and pepper to taste. You may also add chopped onions, coriander and chillies. Add water to reach the consistency of a batter. Make cheela from this mixture.3. Rawa upma: If you want some quick-to-make recipe for your breakfast, try rawa upma. Dry roast a cup of rawa until it turns aromatic. In another pan, add 2 tbsp oil. Crackle mustard seeds and add few curry leaves to it. Then add chopped vegetables to the pan and cook until they become soft. Add salt to taste. Then, add roasted rawa and one and a cup of water.

To this, add onion, tomatoes, and roasted peanuts and cook well. Add turmeric, salt and sugar to taste. Now, add soaked poha and mix well. That is it!5.

Even the easing out of the lockdown has not really changed things, and if anything it has increased the stress households feel with the constant checking in on whether we are wearing masks properly, whether there is enough sanitiser at home and at hand while out.It is no surprise that there is that much more irritation, frustration, annoyance and downright anger. We are getting on each others nerves and that energy is getting directed all over the place, like that much mustard spluttering when thrown into hot oil for a tadka. The irritability is at epic levels, and theres much snapping at each other and all the stress and tension we carry is just looking for an excuse to just come out and express itself. Families are talking about a lot more arguments and fights, and as things tend to happen, there is some kind of hierarchy that ends up becoming a reality in such fights.The old story goes that the ruler of a kingdom loses a battle, and shows that anger upon the palace staff, who then, powerless as they are to take it back where it is needed, take it out on a more vulnerable person in the house, a child maybe, who then, further takes it out on someone even more vulnerable and defenceless - the family dog, maybe. The term whipping dog comes from such a reality, where the family dog ends up being at the receiving end of much of the anger. It is not just an endless chain of violence - at other times, the affected party plots revenge and serves it cold to their grim satisfaction.The more intimate the connection, the worse it can get. There is likely to be more intense and painful cycles of hurt and revenge. It might be silly things like an under-seasoned lunch, or a toothbrush used to clean the windowsill and left back in the cup. Having experienced love and deciding to live together doesnt make them immune to these action-reaction cycles, nor does it make the injured party magically absorb and just swallow all of it.The question is: Are we destined to cycle around in these interminable cycles of violence and counter-violence? Will we keep passing on our hurt down, or get stuck plotting revenge? Or, can we really get anything close to a resolution?Revenge is a me-first space, where the intent is only to give oneself some solace, even at the cost of love. Resolution is more a We are OK, and if we cant be ok, I still want to be OK for myself,  space that seeks to defend dignity with grace.(The writer is a counsellor with Innersight)",MUSTARD OIL

Some like good food, some cook well, some are knowledgeable about everything culinary  but there is one thread that connects them. They keep me informed about food developments in the city and elsewhere.Thats how I got to know about BongTaste, a new food delivery outfit in town. My friend Pritha  who was a journalist when we first met, has turned into a gourmet cook over the years, and is now a walking encyclopedia on Bengali culinary customs. She asked one of the brains behind the service  Adusyanti Chatterjee  to get in touch with me. She did, I read the menu, ordered a few dishes, and the rest, as they say, is food history.BongTaste operates from south Delhi and delivers to most parts of Delhi-NCR, but only on weekends. They change the menu every week, and rerun old favourites. I saw there were various kinds of chicken dishes (chicken korma and doi chicken) on the menu that week, but I had already ordered a chicken roast from Utpala Mukherjees food service that week, and had cooked a Malaysian chicken for a few friends who were coming over. So we asked for a plate of kanchkolar kofta (green banana kofta), prawns (chingri bati chorchori) and mutton do piyaza, all amounting to 1,160, a reasonable price, you would agree. The helpings are good enough for two hungry people.I thought Id had enough of Bengali dishes, but clearly I was mistaken, for I relished all three. The kanchkolar kofta was a revelation. Raw banana is not something we often have at home, and the last time we did, wed followed a southern Indian recipe from YouTube. This recipe was completely different, and I enjoyed the dish thoroughly.For this, the bananas had been boiled, then mashed with spices, boiled potatoes, onion paste, ginger, and green chillies. The mash was shaped into balls, which went into a mildly sweet and gingery curry, flavoured with grated coconut and then topped with ghee. It was truly subtle, and I found myself going in for seconds.This dish was light, while the bati chorchori was deliciously spicy. Some fairly large prawns had been marinated with mustard oil and spices and then cooked in a bowl  called bati in Bengali  over a low flame. Chorchori, as most know, is a mix. This is called a bachelors dish, explains Subinoy Das, co-founder of BongTaste. I suppose the name comes from the fact that it translates into hassle-free cooking.Mutton do piyaza | Photo Credit: Special arrangementThe mutton do piyaza was all right, though I fear it had too much oil. Still, the gravy, however rich, was tasty, and went well with my home-cooked roti.This week they have something called a Sultanate edition: chicken dishes from Lucknow, Murshidabad, Hyderabad, and Bhopal. It has on offer Nizami murgh, Nawabi murgh, Sultani murgh and Darbari murgh (each 410).My only grouse with the service is that they dont factor in the delivery charges when they give us the bill (150). The amount is not much, but it is easier when the sum is added to the bill so that you have a cashless delivery.I look forward to more Bong dishes in the near future. Kanchkola, my near and dear ones tell me, is also the Bengali word for the Hindi thhainga, a rude upturned thumb gesture that stands for a phrase like too bad or ha ha! I think in this case the dish  along with BongTaste  deserves not a kanchkola, but a cheerful thumbs up.The writer is a seasoned food critic.",MUSTARD OIL

This young MA English graduate from Osmania University who is currently preparing for PhD entrance and is the co-author and co-editor of the book has been instrumental in bringing out a collection of short non-fiction stories. The stories are from 16 different contemporary voices. The stories deal with challenges faced by women  from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), domestic violence, rape, toxic relationships, challenges faced by women.Says his co-author and co-editor Kadali Satyanarayana, a young female Telugu writer from Hyderabad, The word feminist is almost added like a slur to a woman for the simple reason that she is fighting for the womens rights. But I am proud to say that Mustard is a collection of feminist writings.The idea to bring out a realistic story collection in Telugu came up when Anvesh was in conversation with Prof Sukumar from Delhi University. I believe that life is the best teacher and to be able to share the lessons and experiences of real-life is a great form of writing. There are stories of LGBTQ people, marginalised women, victims of casteism, of casting couch, bringing up a girl child, premarital sex etc. Barring Anvesh and Kadali most of them are first-time writers from Hyderabad, Telangana and one from Bengaluru. Through word of mouth, we reached out to social activists who have been exposed to situations. In course of their work, they also may have honed their communication skills and we chose such passionate and articulate individuals to lend their voices, the duo say.Why an English title for a Telugu book? My first book was also a Telugu book with an English title. The millennials will never pick up a book titled Darahaasam or Madhumasam. So it was a deliberate attempt  call it even a gimmick  just to attract the young generation to pick up the book. Also having an English title for a Telugu book, with story titles like Dignity with a hashtag #KapudukovadamEndukuNerparu, is to pique their interest. I have a big circle on social media. So Anvesh and I are the faces of the book, she says.Her story titled Red Flags with the hashtag #DooramAvvadamKoodaTelusundali, is about reading the warning signs in a relationship. She walks out of a toxic relationship.The work on the book started in July and between exams and bouts of illnesses, the duo managed to put it together by September. Currently, the book published by HSRA Publishers is in a physical format and they will soon be getting the digital version too. We are also considering a translation into other languages. These voices are powerful and they should be heard everywhere, says Anvesh. He wrote the story of a Dalit girl who is in love with a Reddy boy who is preparing for Group I officers exam. She lends her attention, time and opportunities to him but he ditches her soon after he lands the job. The story questions whether the SC-ST law has been impactful in helping such women seek justice and if some even have freedom in a relationship.

The solution turns the straw and stubble into manure and is seen by the government as a solution to avoid burning them.The Chief Minister made the announcement after visiting a facility in Kharkhari Nahar village, where the bio-decomposer capsule which was developed by Pusa Institute, is made into a solution through a week-long process.Creating a modelDevelopment Minister Gopal Rai, who was also present, said that though people say there is not much stubble burning in Delhi, the government is using this bio decomposer in Delhi and creating a model, so that other States cannot make any excuses for burning stubble. If Delhi can make a centralised system and do it, then other States can also do it. It depends on how serious they are. Delhi will get benefit only when Punjab and Haryana will use this, Mr. Rai said.The entire process of creating the solution to spraying it on the fields across the entire Delhi costs only around 20 lakh. I hope this will prove to be an effective alternative for the neighbouring States as well, the Chief Minister said.Meanwhile, farmers of two villages The Hindu met are wary since they can only sow wheat or mustard about 20-25 days after the government sprays the solution and said they doubt whether the time gap may affect their next crop.Sell strawAbout a dozen farmers from two villages and a farmers association told The Hindu said that they do not burn the stubble in Delhi and also the crop is cut by labourers not using machines.There are two kinds of waste after harvesting: one is the straw left behind after threshing and taking out the grain. And the second is the stubble which is left attached to the ground, along with the root system, after harvesting. The burning of both of them is broadly termed as stubble burning.In Punjab and Haryana, the crop is cut mostly by combine harvesters, which leaves a longer stubble attached to the ground. Farmers burn it as they cannot plough them back into the Earth very easily. In many cases, they also burn the straw as it is not sold or used as fodder for animals.Last year, we sold straw of one acre after harvesting for about 3,000. We even sell them to other villagers who use it as fodder for cows after mixing it with straw of jowar or bajra, said Surender Singh, 45, a farmer from Kharkhari Jatmal village. Singh said that he was ready to try the new solution on the stubble standing on the ground after selling the straw.Many other farmers had a similar opinion.But he was wary. Last year, I sowed wheat in December as the harvesting of paddy was late. Half of my seeds did not germinate and I ended up losing a lot of money. I hope the spraying wont delay my next sowing, the farmer said.A group of farmers gathered at the spot said the bio-decomposer will be more useful in Haryana and Punjab where the farm waste is burnt.Nithin Phalswal, 27, from Ghumman Hera village said that he would allow spraying only in half of his farm land close to a canal where sowing is done a little late. If I allow in the other half and I get delayed for sowing and the soil moisture decreases, then the seeds wont germinate, he said.Most farmers said that the government is yet to contact them for the procedure.",MUSTARD OIL

From being a quintessential element of Bengali cuisine to being a part of several rituals and traditions, it is impossible to imagine special occasions and festivals without a scrumptious fish delicacy prepared in the authentic style.Interestingly, the preparation of fish and the use of ingredients may vary from region to region, even in the Bengali cuisine the influence of age-old traditions may influence the preparation of fish. One such classic Bengali fish curry is Doi Maach, made with the freshness of curd, spices and herbs. This delicacy can be made in just a few minutes, just follow us through this easy recipe and nail it like a pro!To begin with this easy recipe, wash 6 pieces of Rohu fish under running water. Then drain the excess water and keep it aside. Next, marinate the fish with salt and turmeric.In the meantime, take a bowl add in 1 cup curd, 1 teaspoon chilli powder, salt as required, a dash of turmeric powder, whisk it all together and pour this over the marinated fish and keep it aside. Make sure you adjust the salt and prepare the fish accordingly.Take a pan over medium flame and pour in 2 tablespoons of mustard oil, once the oil is hot enough, add in the 2 green chilies, 2 teaspoons of ginger and garlic paste along with 1 minced onion and saute till this mixture turns slightly brownish. Then add in the 2 bay leaves, 2 green cardamom and 1 cinnamon stick. Toss it all nicely.Next, reduce the flame and add in the marinated fish, mix it all nicely. Cook for sometime and then cover the lid and allow the fish to cook in steam. Make sure you flip the fish occasionally. Once the fish appears cooked and the curd starts releasing oil and in a handful of fresh coriander leaves (chopped), cover the lid and cook it for 5 minutes, Turn off the flame and serve it with Basanti Pulao or steamed rice. Enjoy!If you dislike the idea of cooking raw fish in steam, then you can also pan fry the fish after marinating it with salt and turmeric and then prepare the Doi Maach.You can also add in some lemon juice to cut the smell of fish, but make sure you do it at the first step of marination else it can ruin the taste of this dish.",MUSTARD OIL

Its strength lies in traversing the times and evaluating what is lost and what has not changed much in some 100 years.A mosque and a gurdwara flourish in the village where Hindus and Muslims live in a workable arrangement and lamps are lit in every household, with people joining in Diwali as well as Eid festivities.In a village where all the major landholdings are with the Sikh and Muslim Jats, the businesses with Hindus and the majority of the workers and artisans are Muslims, the tallest haveli belongs to Zaildar Kehar Singh. The adjacent ones belong to the village moneylender Lala Beli Shah and the horse breeder Mian Ali Begh.Ranjit Powars debut novel. ( Sourced )The Zaildar has two daughters and the older one, Nimmo, the protagonist, cannot go to school because it is five miles away from the village. But she grows up happily learning Gurmukhi, numbers and Urdu at the primer level. Her skills are weaving, embroidery and cooking like the other girls of the village. The family prestige and the promise of a good dowry bring her the match of a handsome officer of the British Indian Army. She is 16 and on the eve of the marriage she feels excited, having relegated a shared crush for Akhtar, son of Mian Ali next doors to a childhood fancy.She wonders what her husband, Hukam Singh, will be like: Does he drink too much? Will he beat her if she makes a mistake? She prays that he should not be too foul tempered and is determined to do all that she can to please him.However, all her determination fails when confronted with the fair and handsome Lieutenant; from her dusky skin to her rusticity, her inability to speak English, dress in style and be an asset at the garden parties and lunches organised by the commanding officers wife, Mrs Gillespie.Nimmo is no memsahib and, worse, fails to conceive a child in two years. She is rejected in favour of the educated and beautiful Hansa. Left in the village home she falls prey to the sexual assaults of her husbands stepbrother. Ironically, Hansa nearly loses out to Nimmo when the latter conceives only to give birth to a daughter who is then abandoned by the husbands family as well as her own. The humane and heartwarming part of the story is the friendship that grows between the two wives. It is Hansa who tells Hukam Singh in the face that infertility is not her problem but his and takes the decision to adopt Nimmos abandoned daughter.And what becomes of Nimmo as she wanders in the dark wanting to take a last look at her parental home in Sahnewal  a place famed for being actor Dharmendras village, where he grew up as his father was the school headmaster, at a time when the riots preceding Partition and massive exodus from both sides had begun.In the story, Mian Alis family is escaping to Lahore in the dark of the night and Akhtar recognises Nimmos silhouette and asks her to accompany them. The healing touch comes when she shares everything and he takes her hand in his: Akhtar and Nimmo are married in a simple ceremony and the girl from Sahnewal, daughter of Zaildar Kehar Singh and wife of Major Hukam Singh of Raipur is reborn as Naaima Begum, her past belonging to another era and another country, torn asunder by ruthless destiny.The saga ends on a note of hope. Not only does Ranjit tell the tale well, she also sets the mood for a forgotten era in colonial Punjab. This I owe to my parents. My father, Lt Col Daljeet Singh, who recreated the ethos of the British Indian Army for me and my mother who belonged to Sahnewal in acquainting me with the rural culture along with its pride and prejudice and the lives of women.Ranjits paternal village is Mithapur and she lives in Chandigarh as she says with her dog Teddy. Travelling is her passion. She also runs a non-profit organisation for education and psychological counselling.Having finished this book in one reading through the night, one awaits Ranjits next novel.nirudutt@gmail.com",MUSTARD OIL

328,328.0,,,2020-10-25,https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/onion-fears-6883203/,"It is rabi, not kharif, thats going to increasingly impart stability to Indias agricultural output.Onions retailing at an all-India average of Rs 70 per kg  they ruled at Rs 50 levels last year too around this time and had crossed Rs 100 by mid-December  has one key takeaway for policymakers. That has to do with the unreliability of kharif crop production even in supposedly normal monsoon years. The southwest monsoon season (June-September) recorded significant surplus rainfall both in 2020 and 2019. Yet, they didnt yield the desired harvests. Last year, the rains werent good till the last week of July, but it poured thereafter and right through October. It led to the standing crop  including onions, pulses and soyabean  suffering heavy damage. Something similar has happened this time. Excess August rains took a toll of soyabean and urad (black gram) in Madhya Pradesh. In September, it was arhar (pigeon pea) and onion in Karnataka. The current month has been a washout for Maharashtras harvest-ready kharif onions and even the late-kharif bulbs that couldnt be transplanted due to the nurseries getting flooded.The extended monsoon rains, although not beneficial for kharif, should nevertheless help recharge groundwater aquifers and thereby, deliver a bounty during the rabi season. Farmers did harvest bumper winter-spring crops of wheat, chana (chickpea), mustard and even onion, tomato, gourds, beans and melons this April-June; one can hope for a repeat in the upcoming season as well. Rabi production is largely dependent on access to irrigation, which has improved over the years through provision of tubewell connections, building of farm ponds/water harvesting structures and adoption of drip/sprinkler technology. Absence of flooding, mild temperatures with clear skies, and low pest and disease incidence during this period allows farmers to obtain yields higher than from the regular post-monsoon kharif season  maize in Bihar is a clear example. It is rabi, not kharif, thats going to increasingly impart stability to Indias agricultural output.Linked to all this is also an effective price stabilisation strategy. The lack of it is apparent from the same onions, which were retailing at Rs 100/kg in December, being dumped barely four months later by Maharashtra farmers at Rs 7/kg. The Narendra Modi government learnt the right lessons from the 2015 Bihar Assembly elections debacle by focusing on procurement of pulses and building a buffer stock. Today, it isnt arhar, but POT (potato, onion, tomato) that is giving the ruling alliance the jitters. Production fluctuations are inevitable with climate change and irregular rainfall patterns. The way to manage them is not by banning exports and imposing stock holding limits in onions or forcing cold store owners to release potatoes deposited with them. The government should create a buffer stock of not just foodgrains, but even onion, potato, sugar, edible oil, milk powder and white butter, to enable non-distortive marketing intervention.

Im currently living with 8-9 saathi (colleagues), he explains. And this is our kitchen.He shows, on the footpath, the two burner cooking gas range, the red LPG cylinder, the half-filled bottle of mustard oil, the three metal pans, the red mug, the spatula, the plastic basket filled with ginger, garlic, onions and masala packets, and the half-empty packet of atta (flour).Mr Kumar is sitting on his haunches, in the middle of all this equipment, wearing a t-shirt and shorts. His face is half-covered with a red check gamchaperhaps a substitute for the mask. He is speaking in a muffled tone, and one has to strain ones ear to hear his words.Mr Kumar is part of a gang of workers, laying out underground cables for a telecom company in this part of south Delhi. Indeed, a great mass of cables is lying in loops next to a big truck, parked on the same pavement. The men have been staying here for a week. We set up our base in one spot for a few days, Mr Kumar explains, and sleep at night inside the truck, and when the work in one area is complete, we drive to the next spot.All the labourers, including Mr Kumar, are from Lucknow, in UP. But where are the rest of the folks this evening?They still have to return from work.Mr Kumar explains that he is the cook at the moment. Each worker in the group performs this duty in turn, and these days it is Mr Kumars task to feed his colleagues.He has already made a few rotis.At home my mother cooks, but I never thought of learning from her. After pausing for some moments, he solemnly says, I never thought that one day I would have to make dal chawal. He picked the skills in real time, though. Earlier, my rotis would never be gol (round)... but after some practice I got better.The menu usually consists of dal, rotis, rice and subzi. Tonight, however, Mr Kumar is skipping dal. Im making aloo gobhi with rassa (gravy) it will be nice with rice.He starts measuring the masalashis mates will be here anytime soon.An hour later, the footpath has grown dark but one sees a bunch of men huddled together, quietly having their meal.",MUSTARD OIL

Instantly, the fare turned popular.Ever since, Jomon has been envisaging Kerala cuisine in a contemporary presentation, introducing healthy and wholesome meals to the world.Extensive research goes behind selecting each element indigenous to Kerala and plating them all together in a soulful and visually aesthetic manner. Mathanga erissery from our local cuisine was altered and reinvented to create Pumpkin steak. Roasted pumpkin was served on red lentil and coconut sauce, tempered with mustard seeds, curry leaves and served with roasted coconut. The final dish is included in the menu only if Im convinced of my creation. Almost every such revamped dish takes weeks to be formulated, says Jomon.While we are familiar with western dishes plated delicately, Indian food is mostly served in thalis. Elevating the same to a fine dining experience is challenging, stresses Jomon.Plating Indian food has many restrictions. The colour combinations, textures, taste palate and the main proteins flavour must be synchronous, he explains.The Mavelikkara native highlighted that there have been instances wherein he was influenced by the manner Keralites eat.We tend to add mashed banana, crushed pappadam and a hint of pickle to the payasam that we eat, thereby subconsciously changing the consistency of the same. I plated the dish in a contemporary manner using similar concepts with pal payasam, caramelised banana, pappadam strips and date pickle. Similarly, our famous fish moilee preparation was elevated to a fine dining experience using avoli fish instead of the pomfret which contains a lot of bones. Weve had many guests requesting the dish, beams Jomon.Ambassador of Kerala cuisineAdding another perspective, the chef also aims to inform people about the already existing local vegan fare in Kerala such as avial sans curd, erissery and sambar.Why not introduce them to the world in a modernised version?Ive noticed that people are acquainted with dishes such as dal makhani, butter chicken and palak gosht but most outside Kerala havent heard of our erissery or kalan. I intend to convince them that I have something better and healthier in my state. Regardless of the plating technique, the authentic flavour will not be compromised at any cost, adds Jomon.Coach Chef de Cuisine!Chef de Cuisine at The LaLiT London, Jomon had earlier appeared in BBC Celebrity Masterchef 2018 to train two British celebrities in Indian cooking techniques. His current responsibility entails creating exciting dishes to enhance his menu, a job Jomon takes to heart and soul. Transforming the humble and rich delectable Kerala cuisine to modern masterpieces in his luxury hotel is no mean feat. Kerala porotta with grilled asparagus, orange segments and beef masala with red wine reduction, bite-sized sadyas comprising rice, thoran and chicken perattu served on poppadom and accompanied by shredded omelette and beans blossomJomons culinary concepts have placed Kerala fare on the global podium.",MUSTARD OIL

There are certain oils like vegetable oil, olive oil, peanut oil, coconut oil, mustard oil and ghee, which must always be stored at room temperature. These oils must always be stored in good quality containers in a cool and dry place. Warm temperatures and sunlight can break the oils down and make them go rancid faster.If you have a big bottle of oil, just take some of it out in a smaller bottle. Use oil from the smaller bottle for everyday cooking and just refill it when it runs out of oil.

It wont be like any previous year, but the women in the city are all geared up to make it #memorable nonetheless. Think smaller groups, sitting in separate balconies, matching masks and gloves with fancy attires, using sanitiser after every ritual, and the likes.Prayer and games while sitting in separate balconiesFor Delhi-based lecturer Anshu Popli, health and safety are priority. We have decided to carry out the puja and thali ritual in small groups of no more than four ladies, and mostly from the same building. Well be wearing masks and will thoroughly sanitize our hands before and after the ritual. To keep the sense of community intact, we have decided to sit in balconies during the puja, so that we can see each other, talk, pray and play games until we spot the moon in the evening.No outside food, only homemade prasadRisshma Aggarwal, a Gurugram-based academics officer, says, Every year I celebrate this day with my close friends and the lovely ladies in my residential society. We indulge in lots of preparations beforehand. But, this year its going to be different because of the pandemic. Ive decided that my joy, happiness and respect for this day will be more like any other year, but the number of people with whom I will celebrate will be less. Ive decided that this year Ill celebrate it with only few close friends whom I know are healthy and safe in the pandemic, so far.She adds, Keeping all safety measures in mind like sanitisation of place in the residential apartments, gloves and mask, continuous use of sanitiser, homemade prasad and social distancing during puja, we will celebrate this day with great enjoyment and devotion. We will also pray to Goddess Parvati to consecrate us with a healthy life and Mother Earth.Matching masks with attiresA teacher by profession, Nitima Arora, who used to go to Suncity Park for the puja, in presence of as least 20 women who used to sit in a circle, is planning it differently this year. She says, I would prefer a group of four to five women only. Ill hear the story narrating significance of Karwa Chauth in an audio inside the house, and when moving out for exchange of thalis, will of course wear mask and gloves. If matching ask is the need of the hour, then so be it. Life has to be beautiful, individuals will become appealing any way!Pooja with fewer people: Sanitised placeBhawna Shakadwipee, a home baker, says, This time due to Covid-19, I am planning to do the puja at my friends place only with my very close friends whom I know have been very cautious and careful in taking Covid-19 precautions throughout these last eight months. We will ensure safety by sanitising the place where everyone sits for the puja, and will use masks, gloves etc. Prasad and all offerings will be strictly home made this time. We will celebrate this pooja with fewer friends but loads of joy, and also a prayer that things get better soon.A safety bubble!Monalika Sabharwal, an entrepreneur, says: Few of my friends and me have decided to create a safety bubble  for the coming festivities and Karwa Chauth puja specially. Puja will be done with my closed group of friends experiencing safety bubble in a well sanitised place using masks, gloves but with same energy, joy and vigour.We have also decided to savour on home made snacks and sweets for the Pooja . We will pray together for the safety and well-being of our loved ones, she adds.Looking #festive ready this #KC this 2020The salons were abuzz with crowds this time around, with many offering a huge discounts.

City-based wedding planner Sidhi Mitra was excited about visiting the salons. She says, Im visiting Looks Salon for a complete transformation today. Pretty excited for this Karwa Chauth. I am having a Covid-19 era wedding on November 25, so video call is a part of all my rituals. Also I would be doing a ritual over with my mother-in-law as she is in Canada.While some like homemaker, Sonakshi Chopra will be doing the makeup and hair myself.

Considered the ideal way to have a meal, the Buddha bowl or hippie bowl as it is also called, can put you in foodie paradise.As Indian cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar discovered a few days ago. Sachins daughter prepared a Buddha bowl for the family and the cricket ace loved it. He took to Instagram to post a picture of the bowls and wrote, He captioned it, Sara made a Buddha bowl for us. It has a fillet of chilli & honey glazed salmon with shredded honey mustard carrots, pickled cucumbers and sliced avocado, on a bed of Thai vegetables. Garnished with mixed seeds, coriander, onion and lemon. Enjoyed having such a healthy and tasty meal. Above all it was filled with love. #foodiefridayThe term Buddha Bowl is said to have been coined by famous food author Martha Stewart and until then these were just referred to as Grain Bowls. But that does not take away from the origins of it. As per lore, Buddha bowls go back a long time to cultures where monks carried these through their roads and paths and people placed whatever food they could give inside them. In contemporary times, they have come to mean either a toss-up whats leftover in the fridge, a convenient meal carry to the office or an oriental blend of rice noodles, quinoa, grains and a sauce. The bowls are also in demand in city restaurant menus. Says Rahul Bajaj, director of a deli in Bandra, A Buddha bowl is also called a power bowl as it packs goodness and nutrition. The bowl we serve is loaded with greens, veggies, walnuts, quinoa topped with a hearty dressing and a fried egg. You get a colourful, nutrient-enriched meal thats aesthetically pleasing and notches things up on the health scale as well. Its also filling.Gurmeet Arora, founder of Mumbai-based healthy caf, says, The Indian Buddha bowl consists of healthful grains topped with multicoloured vegetables and protein  it has also been claiming lunch and dinner menus in our cafe and is being lapped up as a fabulous new way to eat. People are loving the Indian twist to it. If you happen to be on the lookout for a pick-me-up kind of meal then Buddha bowl is just what you need. It has clean flavours and plenty of greens, it can become a go-to meal in no time!Mumbai-based chef Keith Lawrence breaks down the assemblage of the Buddha Bowl. This is a quick and easy fix to get your daily dose of healthy, nourishing nutrients in one bowl. Constructing a Buddha bowl is like putting together four basic components which the body requires. First, you add the protein, then add some whole grain rice to it, followed by a selection of vegetables. Bring this all together with a delicious dressing.He gives a quick recipe to try: One quick Buddha bowl recipe which I swear by can be made by adding some grilled cottage cheese seasoned with salt and pepper, brown rice, assorted vegetables tossed with some fresh herbs and bringing it all together with a light coconut curry leaf sauce, he says.An example of clean eating The term Buddha Bowl was coined by food expert Martha Stewart in her book. It usually comprises a vegetarian meal with smaller portions of ingredients served cold, such as vegetables, healthy grains like quinoa and brown rice, proteins like chickpeas, tofu as well as greens.

The average prices of all edible oils - groundnut, mustard, vanaspati, soybean, sunflower and palm - have increased, with the spike in the case of palm, soybean and sunflower oils by up to 20-30% in the last one year.Sources said this was flagged at a presentation before a Group of Ministers headed by home minister Amit Shah early this week. They added while prices of onion have reduced due to import of nearly 30,000 tonnes and potato prices have stabilised, edible oil prices have been increasing constantly.Data accessed from the consumer affairs ministry's price monitoring cell show that the average price of mustard oil was 120 per litre on Thursday compared to 100 a year back. In the case of vanaspati, prices have increased to 102.5 per kg against 75.25 a year back. The modal price of soybean oil was selling at 110 per litre while average price on October 18 in 2019 was 90. Similar has been the trend in the case of sunflower and palm oil.Sources said the reduction in palm oil production in Malaysia in the past six months has been one of the reasons behind increase in prices of other edible oils. Nearly 70% of the palm oil in the country is used by the processed food industry, which is the biggest bulk consumer.

The cumulative effect of all these factors would ensure that Indian edible oil imports may remain restricted, it added.In the 2019-20 oil year, SEA said, crude edible oil comprised 97 per cent of the total imports, as domestic refining capacity utilisation improves significantly.As refined oils were kept under restricted import category, its shipments were restricted to only 4.21 lakh tonne in 2019-20 as compared to 27.31 lakh tonne in the previous year.",MUSTARD OIL

Indian cuisine serves up a wonderful spread of warm options for surviving the cold and wet monthsThis time of the year has become synonymous with torrential rainfall in much of southern India, with a greater frequency of cyclonic weather patterns, thanks to climate change. Feeling hungry while cooped up and trying to be part of an invisible army of work-from-home soldiers? Try these traditional recipes that are tasty and nutritious (when taken in moderation) and will keep you warm enough to face the wet months.The winter diet of our Bohra Muslim community includes dishes to keep everyone immune from colds and fevers, says Alifiya Husein, a former catering industry professional and avid home chef based in Chennai. We have bhajiya (fritters) using seasonal vegetables along with small malpua pancakes made with a semolina-flour batter. The cuisine of our migrant community has evolved to integrate local ingredients wherever possible.Husein says the hearty breakfast dish kheema lasanyo, that has layers of chopped sprouted garlic and minced mutton topped with fried egg, is typically prepared only during winter. Besides the rich stuff, there are some simpler preparations too, such as stew-type mutton white khurdi (see recipe), served with warm khichdi.Long before fruits and vegetables began to be available through the year rather than according to their natural farming cycle, the subcontinent already had a set of weather-specific dishes.Mutton White Khurdi IngredientsMutton pieces 1 kgGinger-garlic paste 1 tbspWater as neededGhee  2 tbspBlack peppercorns  4Cloves  3-4Cinnamon stick  1 smallBay Leaf  3Cumin seed  1 tspOnions  2 medium choppedWheat flour (Atta)  2 tbspMint leaves  1 bunchSalt to tasteJuice of half a limeGreen chillies  3-4, slit (or to taste)Milk   cupMethodWash mutton, and coat it with ginger-garlic paste. Add water (as per desired serving size), and cook it in a pressure cooker until done.In another heavy-bottomed pan, saut cumin seed, peppercorns, green chillies with sliced onions until lightly browned. Dissolve the wheat flour in a little bit of water, and add to the mix. Pour in the cooked mutton, milk and salt and bring to a boil, while stirring the soup constantly. To finish, add lime juice and mint leaves and simmer. Serve Mutton White Khurdi warm with Khichdi.In North India, for example, home cooks made big batches of gaajar (carrot) halwa to utilise the root vegetable that grew abundantly during winter. The rich dessert, made with grated carrot cooked down to a mushy paste with lashings of creamy milk, sugar and dried fruits, was stored in containers and naturally refrigerated by the cold air. When serving, portions of the halwa would be reheated, bringing alive the caramelised flavours on the palate.There are many recipes for sweets like gond ke laddoo made with edible acacia gum, and gur aate ka halwa, a delicious melding of whole wheat flour and jaggery, that are cooked specifically during winter, because the ingredients create warmth, and increase the bodys ability to bear the winters lower temperatures. Beetroot halwa, also cooked in generous amounts of clarified butter with sugar and nuts, is yet another winter-time treat.Nutritionists advise people to look out for seasonal produce that can enhance immunity and fight winter infections. Fruits like oranges, guavas, figs, pomegranate and grapes and vegetables like French beans, yam, beetroot and radish are beneficial during cold weather.In the South, soups and rasams that are spiced with ingredients like pepper and turmeric are popular during winter. Vegetarian options include poondu milagu rasam (made by cooking peeled garlic cloves in tamarind water spiced with pepper), and sundal, a snack made with pre-boiled chickpeas, or horse-gram tempered with mustard seeds, dried chilli and curry leaves in hot oil.For non-vegetarians, manjal thanni (literally turmeric water) is a mild and watery gravy made with chicken or mutton, to help banish the chills. Paaya soup, made with lamb trotters slow cooked with an infusion of spices, has travelled from the erstwhile Deccan kingdom of Hyderabad to all parts of the country, and remains a favourite for winter breakfasts and dinners.So, if the rainy weather is making you hungry for comfort food, keep an eye on the healthy and traditional dishes that you could be eating this season.",MUSTARD OIL

Shrikant moved to Calcutta in 1989 when the hotel opened, so even if I assume we only met a year or so later, we have been friends for 30 years now.These days, Shrikant is General Manager of the Grand Hyatt in Kochi, a lovely hotel that I stayed at when it first opened (but before Shrikant got there), and is clearly immersing himself in Kerala culture. Last week, he sent me a box of local Malayali pickles that totally blew my mind. The pickles had all been made in the kitchens of the Grand Hyatt. According to Shrikant, the Grand Hyatt has around 10 house-made pickles available at any time.Most of the pickles are made to traditional Kerala methods. The Grand Hyatts Chef De Cuisine Prasad Moorkath explained that they sun-dry all of the spices before powdering them in a stone grinder. And for non-vegetarian pickles, the meat or fish is marinated for 24 to 36 hours with sea salt or turmeric.At the Grand Hyatt in Kochi pickles like this prawn one are made to Kerala methodsAmong the pickles Shrikant sent was a (farmed) tuna pickle, one made from backwater prawns, and the best of the lot was a Syrian Christian pickle made with buffalo meat.It was these fish and meat pickles that got me thinking: how easy are they to get in Delhi and Mumbai? An obvious place to start was Mahabelly, easily Delhis best Malayali restaurant. The founders Thomas Fenn, Zachariah Jacob and the Executive Chef Jinson Varghese are Syrian Christians, so the bulk of the menu covers food from that community. (The other partner is Dr Prem Kiran.)Mahabelly is big on pickles. Not only can you eat them at the restaurant but they also sell them in 200 gram bottles. The bulk of the pickles on offer are vegetarian but they also make some of the pickles that Shrikant sent me: tuna, shrimp and buffalo meat.The recipe of the famous bombil pickle by Christina Kinny comes from the East Indian community of BasseinI was intrigued enough by these delicious Malayali pickles to wonder if meat pickles were a South Indian thing. Because so little has been written about Indias non-vegetarian pickle tradition, I crowd-sourced my info by asking for recommendations on Twitter.If you drive from Chandigarh to Shimla, you will see shops lining the road selling chicken and mutton pickles, which are very popularThe responses were overwhelming but it soon became clear that meat pickles can be found all over India, not just the South. There is a glorious North Eastern tradition that deserves a column by itself. Then, there is a Goan tradition, centred mainly around fish pickles. And there is a flourishing North Indian tradition that seems to be centred around the Himachal-Punjab border. If you drive from Chandigarh to Shimla, you will see shops lining the road selling chicken and mutton pickles. Quality can vary but these pickles are very popular.I spoke to Manan Chawla of Mystic Pickle (mysticfood.in) whose range of pickles is mind-numbing. He sells chicken and meat achaar, all made with mustard oil, without any preservatives, because as he says, my mom being a true Punjabi and from Shimla makes delicious handcrafted pickles. Chawlas products belong to the Punjab-Himachal tradition.At Mahabelly in Delhi, expect to find Malayali-style tuna, shrimp and buffalo meat picklesPreeti Chadha runs Pickles by PC (her Insta handle is @pickles_by_pc) and is married to a Punjabi but her non-veg pickles move away from the Shimla tradition. She surprised me with a duck pickle and an unusual keema-chilli pickle. There were no traditional recipes for these, she said, but ones she had developed herself.Rummys Kitchen (@rummyskitchen on Instagram) is a one-woman operation run by Inderpreet Nagpal, a Punjabi who now lives in Mumbai. Her vegetarian pickles are famous and made to traditional Punjabi recipes but she makes a variety of non-vegetarian pickles in the South Indian style. Her view is that meat pickles made in the North Indian way dont last as long as South Indian pickles (probably true), so she improvises her own meat and fish pickles in a broadly South Indian style.Then, of course, there is a completely distinct tradition from Nepal. Gaurav Pramanik (@gauravpramanik on both Instagram and Twitter) has a dedicated following for his pickles, many of which are made according to his Nepali mothers recipes. They use the Nepali counterpart of Sichuan pepper and can make your mouth tingle and pucker up. Some are what you would expect (buffalo meat and chicken) but there is a lot that you wont easily find elsewhere (soya bean and shrimp, for instance). I am dying to try them given how much praise he has received on social media.Nepalese-style crispy shredded chicken pickle is the specialty of Gaurav PramanikThe one non-vegetarian pickle most of us have usually come across is the Goan Prawn Balchao. It is one of those dishes that can either become a pickle or a slightly more substantial item to eat with rice or pav. Opinions on whether a balchao should be more like a pickle than a full-fledged dish vary but Crescentia Fernandes (@crescentiaskitchen on Instagram) who I get my chorizo and Goa masalas from reckons it should be a pickle. She makes it to order along with a bombil version.The prawn pickles made by Parsis rely on a special vinegar from NavsariLavina Solomon (Lavina.solomon@gmail.com), is another home cook who has recently taken to offering her balchaos for sale. She also makes both bombil and prawn balchao. She insists that, contrary to my fears, the bombil does not smell offensive. (I guess we will have to see!)The Goans are not the only community to make balchao. Lavina is from Mangalore but concedes that her balchao is Goan-influenced. On the other hand, Christina Kinny (9987869691 on WhatsApp) who is famous for her bombil pickle attributes her recipe to the East Indian community of Bassein. Christina makes a prawn pickle too but her specialty is a pickle made from Kolim, tiny baby shrimp, which is normally very hard to find.And then, of course, there are the Parsis. Shelley Subawalla (ssubawalla@hotmail.com) of Zarins Secrets is well-known for her Parsi masalas but she makes a Parsi-style prawn pickle, too. Most vegetarian Parsi pickles are not significantly different from Gujarati pickles (okay, I have now offended the entire Parsi community) but the prawn pickles are their own, relying on a special vinegar from Navsari.Manan Chawlas chicken achaar is made with mustard oil, without any preservativesAnd here I was thinking that meat and fish pickles were hard to get! In fact, they are easily available, thanks to the miracle of Internet ordering. We dont need to bother to look for them in shops. And the best part is they are nearly all made by small artisanal operations or by adventurous ladies in their own home kitchens!Say what you will about this new age where we find our food on our smartphones, but there can be no doubt that it has empowered thousands of home chefs. And in the process, it has revived regional Indian dishes that would otherwise have been drowned by the flood of bland packaged food from multinationals.The views expressed by the columnist are personalFrom HT Brunch, November 29, 2020Follow us on twitter.com/HTBrunchConnect with us on facebook.com/hindustantimesbrunch",MUSTARD OIL

Stage set for Centre's talks with farmersIn the tussle between the Delhi and central government, we  the small farmers of Delhi  are getting crushed. Government is not leaving us any option but to sell our lands as farming has become an almost impossible task for us now. The Delhi government has not procured crops on minimum support price (MSP) from farmers in the last six years. We are with protestors as their demands are legitimate, Dagar said.Paras Tyagi, who runs a non-profit for farmers, said farmers are facing huge problems since the Shiela Dikshit government removed the tag of agriculture state from Delhi.The current AAP regime should change this and give Delhi back the status of agricultural state. It will help the farmers a lot. As land is a subject under the control of the Centre, most of the blame must fall upon. However, the Delhi government can help a lot but is not doing so, said Tyagi.As per the 2019 Economic Survey of Delhi there is almost 34,000 hectares of land under cultivation in the capital.ALSO WATCH:There are major issues in the land revenue act which does not allow us to make own storage facilities. The Delhi government is also not taking any steps to make more godowns so that we can store grains if unable to sell at a price which we like for later. We are forced to sell at a low price to survive. Government should implement LDRP policy in the Green belt, Dagar said.Most farmers in Delhi are supporting those gathered at borders of the national capital to protest against the laws passed by the Centre.The land pooling policy is a faulty. It will leave farmers landless. Like me, many other farmers have told the government that we cannot afford the Development Charges for the villages under the 60:40 ratio as per the current requirement of the policy, said Devender Singh from Nangal Thakran village in North Delhi.Jitendar from Jhuljhuli village said that the current farm laws need to analysed more and that the Delhi government should create more storage facilities.",MUSTARD OIL

Officials say that Uttarakhand honey has demand in both national and international market as it is organic, therefore increasing productivity will help locals earn a living.HC Tiwari, joint-director for horticulture in Kumaon region in the state, who also looks after the beekeeping project, said that there are approximately 300 nyay panchayats in the state where madhugram or honey clusters are being set up by the department.Production of honey is a process which can give earnings to people throughout the year except during the monsoon. As Uttarakhands honey is famous for its organic properties, it is a good source of income and we are trying to promote the same among locals across the state, said Tiwari.As part of this initiative, the horticulture department has asked district-level officials to identify areas where beekeeping can be done successfully, like Terai regions, agricultural lands in the hilly districts. After the identification of locations, locals will be trained in beekeeping (as the process involves dealing with a live insect), and then they will be given boxes used as beehives.Also read: We brought our own food - Farmer leaders at Vigyan Bhawan meetOne box costs Rs 4000 of which Rs 3200 will be paid by the department and Rs 800 will be borne by the beekeeper.The official further said that the locals can earn an amount between Rs 70/kg to around Rs 300-400/kg for honey, depending on the demand and the type of honey being produced.The type of honey that will get produced after beekeeping depends on the flowers that the bees suck nectar from. During these winter months, mostly mustard honey is produced as that is the crop the bees feed on. In the months of March-April, it is flower-based honey, which has a higher price, thus the earnings vary accordingly, added Tiwari.He further said that during the months of lockdown, beekeepers earned around Rs 300/kg as the demand for honey increased, because people were more focused on building immunity to fight Covid-19 and preferred organic honey.",MUSTARD OIL

And they would not be far off the mark. More often than not, my over-smart attitudeas my father loved to call itwould get me into a serious spot of bother. But every now and then, it also took me down a serendipitous path of delicious discoveries.The summer of my 10th year spent vacationing around South East Asia was one such time. Insisting on ordering a sundae for myself at a Korean restaurant in Singapore and paying absolutely no heed to the flustered servers suggestion that I order something else, I gluttonously waited for my frozen treat to materialise onto the table. The now-sniggering server plonked down a plate upon which was placed a blistered, coiled link of a dark brown, almost blackish sausage that he proclaimed with a flourish as sundae!. That is how I was introduced to the wonders of the delicious Korean pigs blood grilled sausage also known as sundae.United by bloodOver the years, I would make it my mission to scope out dishes that pardon the morbidity  satiated my blood cravings. From imparting that unmistakable iron-y flavour to an Asian stir-fry to some much-needed heft to a thin gravy or simply bestowing that rich, heaemoglobic, scarlet depth of colour to a stew, animal blood holds sway the world over. The concept of animal blood as an ingredient and dare-I-say a delicacy is firmly etched into the culinary lexicon of most countries food cultures for centuries.On a safari to Kenya in the mid-2000s, I partook in the age-old Maasai tribal custom of knocking back a cocktail of bulls blood and milk. Freshly siphoned off the beasts jugular vein, the blood is quickly mixed with cows milk to avoid curdling and served warm from a hollowed bulls horn. While doing my post-graduation degree in the U.K., I fell in love with the crumbly, oaty taste of a generous slab of pigs blood sausage called black pudding served under fried eggs for breakfast in the cafeteria of my halls of residence.Boudin Noir. Getty Images/iStockphotoWeekend trips to next-door France introduced me to their iteration of the adored pigs blood sausage called boudin noir, that is best paired with sauted apples. On a two-week exchange trip to Guangzhou, I saw my Chinese host family speak reverentially of what they know as congealed pig or ducks blood tofu called xie dufun that is the main ingredient of the hallowed, fiery stew aptly called hot pot.Pork blood stew. Getty Images/iStockphotoMy blood quest would get further intensified in places like Laos and in northeast Thailand where a surprisingly fresh-tasting mountain salad called laap sees raw minced pork mixed with spices and copious amounts of pigs blood. On a recent, pre-pandemic work trip to Scandinavia, I gourmandised my way through the wonderfully flavoursome pigs blood pancake called blodplttar in Sweden and veriohukainen in Finland.India, tooAnd if you think these are foreign and exotic tastes, India too has a vast culinary repertoire of blood-enriched dishes in its desi kitchens. I will never forget the mixture of emotions I went through when I saw a freshly slaughtered pig for the first time in Goa. My aunts rushed to collect the blood spewing from the animals jugular into a hollowed coconut shell, stirring the red liquid to prevent it from coagulating. The blood would later be used in the Portuguese-influenced, festive pork dish called sorpotel. As if the Kashmiri chillis crimson hue isnt enough, pigs blood is added towards the end to impart a bright red blush to this thick stew made of tiny bits of fatty pork and pigs liver swimming in a vinegar-spiked gravy that is served with crusty brun pao.Though it uses chicken as the main protein, another blood-based, Portuguese-influenced Goan dish is cabidela de galinha. Made very differently from sorpotel, this dish is a sort of mild stew-meets-risotto that uses a generous amount of basmati rice in its preparation. As my travels and work stints took me south, to the Indian peninsula, I discovered that both the Madurai and Kongu Nadu regions of Tamil Nadu share another blood-centric dish  the aattu ratha poriyal. This stir-fry uses the congealed blood of a goat, which is steamed and cut into small bits that are added to spices like turmeric, ginger, garlic, chilli powder, mustard and stir-fried in oil with onions and fresh grated coconut with plenty of curry leaves thrown in.North by NortheastInterestingly, I learned that quite a few of the blood-enhanced dishes of Indias northeast are festive ones made with great pomp and ceremony. Take the sacred dish of amin, for instance, made by the Galo tribal people of Arunachal Pradesh from the blood of a sacrificial mithun (a semi-domesticated hybrid ox) on the fourth (and last) day of the Mopin Festival of Fertility, celebrated in April every year.Similarly, Indias indigenous Nepalese, who mainly live in Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Sikkim and Darjeeling, also have a ritualistic spicy goat blood dish called rakti that is had during the Hindu festival of Dashain (Dussehra) and cooked in mustard oil over a slow fire. Still in the northeast, the Khasis from the Cherrapunjee area of Meghalaya also known as Sohra, make a pork pulao called ja-doh that uses pig and sometimes chicken blood. The dish is typically eaten at breakfast during Christmas and Easter. Once again, serendipity comes to the fore when I discover, while researching this piece, of all things a dessert, made with blood. Apparently, in Italy, sanguinaccio dolce is a pudding made with pigs blood, chocolate, sugar, pine nuts, raisins and milk. I know where I am heading next when the pandemic departs!SUNDAY RECIPECabidela de GalinhaCabidela de galinha.

Which is why, given the unhealthy climate that exists because of the pandemic, we asked five top chefs to share their thoughts on immunity-boosting ingredients and the recipes that use them.Chef Joan-RocaChef-Owner of the three-Michelin star El Celler de Can Roca, Girona, SpainFavourite immunity-boosting recipe: Oyster Ying-YangWhy? In Mediterranean gastronomy, garlic is a good natural antibiotic. Catalan cuisines typical homemade aioli sauce is an emulsion made of raw garlic, salt and olive oil. We use it with fish, charcoaled meats and greens. From Andalusian culture, we have a wonderful cold soup named ajoblanco made of garlic, tender fresh almonds, vinegar, extra virgin olive oil and salt.At El Celler de Can Roca, garlic is present in one of our dishes, the Ying-Yang Oyster, based on two sauces, the cold ajoblanco, and a hot cream made of fermented black garlic.Nutritionists notes: Apart from immunity-boosting garlic, Oysters too are loaded with zinc, the gatekeeper of immunity. This recipe is a combination of powerful antioxidants and anti-inflammatory agents, including Omega-3, selenium and Vitamin E.Recipe: Oyster Ying-YangServes 4Ingredients and method:For oysters:4 oysters500g sea waterOpen oysters with a paring knife and remove them from their shells carefully. Cut the beard off with a paring knife and blanch oysters in boiling sea water for 15 seconds. Remove them from the water and place them on a baking sheet to blast chill. Reserve.For black garlic sauce (yields 550g):250g peeled almonds500g of water7.5g Sherry vinegar12.5g extra virgin olive oil3 black garlic cloves3.75g salt20g squid inkCrush the peeled almonds with water and leave to stand for 24 hours refrigerated. Run through a cloth filter, applying pressure to squeeze out as much water as possible. Mix it with the remaining ingredients, blend, and strain and keep the resulting sauce very cool until serving.For white garlic shots (yields 700g):250g almond paste250g water1/2 garlic clove166.5g water15g Sherry vinegar20g extra virgin olive oilSalt3 gelatine sheetsHydrate almond paste for 12 hours with 250g water. Cut the garlic clove in half and remove the germ if necessary. Mix all the ingredients except for the gelatine and blend in the Thermomix. Separate a third of the mixture, heat it while keeping it below 35C/95F and dilute gelatine sheets, previously hydrated. Add in the remaining mixture and transfer it into a squeeze bottle. Let drops of the mixture fall into a container with liquid nitrogen to make frozen spheres; remove with a strainer and reserve in a container in the freezer until serving.Oyster sauce (yields 550g):10 oysters50g shallot5g butter35g oyster water20g oyster sauce625g creamSaltOpen the oysters and reserve their water. Julienne the shallot finely and toss in butter with a pinch of salt over very low heat until it cooks well. Add the oysters and sear them on both sides to brown them lightly; use the oyster water to deglaze, add the oyster sauce, cook for one minute and add cream. Simmer the mixture on very low heat for five minutes, remove and place in Thermomix. Blend the mixture and run it through a fine chinoise. Reserve in a bain-marie at 65C/149F.Garnishing and plating: Cut in half the oysters and, using a paring knife, cut a small base at the tip of each oyster, so that they stand on the plate. On a small soup dish, set one spoonful of very cold black garlic sauce on one side and white garlic shots on top of it, as well as half a cold oyster. On the opposite side, with both sauces touching but not mixing, arrange the hot oyster sauce and the other half oyster, previously heated slightly. This way, a play with cold and hot temperatures is created with both the oysters and the sauces.Chef Srijit Girija GopinathChef at the two-Michelin star Campton Place, and chef owner of Ettan, San FranciscoFavourite immunity-boosting recipe: RasamFor chef Srijit Girija Gopinath, rasam works bestWhy? The key to consumption is to eat what is available locally and what is in season. There is a reason why nature delivers it at a certain time of the year. Indian cuisine is blessed with several immunity-promoting ingredients baked into our recipes already. There is curcumin in turmeric, gingerol and capsaicin in ginger, allicin (sulphur) in garlic, Vitamin C-rich citrus fruits like grapefruit, lemon, lime, tangerine and so on. When it comes to immunity-boosting dishes, though the idea of immunity boosting was never a question then, rasam was part of everyday life. Perhaps thats one of the reasons why we seldom fell sick those days. Today, I love making variations of rasams, with chicken, fish bones, lamb trotters and crab when in season. A good half a dozen ingredients in our humble rasam are today celebrated in the Western world for their immunity-boosting qualities.Nutritionists notes: The star ingredient for an immunity-boosting effect here is tomatoes, which are loaded with a strong antioxidant called lycopene that reduces oxidative stress and enhances immune response. Rasam brings added benefits with anti microbial spices such as cumin, turmeric and ginger.Recipe: Chicken rasamServes 3-4Ingredients:For chicken rasam base3 tbsp groundnut oil300g chicken thighs/ legs with bone (cut in to one-inch pieces)2 tomatoes (medium-size, diced)3 pods garlic (crushed with skin)6 cilantro stems (crushed)1/2 tsp chilli powder1/2 tsp turmeric powderSprig of curry leaves3 tbsp moong dal (soaked)2 tbsp tamarind pulp1 litre of water approx.SaltRasam spice blend1/2 tsp cumin seeds1/4 tsp fenugreek seeds1 tsp fennel seeds1 tsp pepper corn2-3 small red chillies (torn)2 garlic cloves1 tsp urad lentil6 curry leaves1 pinch asafoetidaFor tempering3tbsp sesame oil1 tsp mustard2 shallots, sliced thin1/2 tsp cumin seeds2 cardamoms, crushed3 cloves-inch piece of cinnamon1/2 tsp black pepper, crushed1 tbsp coriander leaves, choppedMethod:Wash the moong dal and add half the water and cook it until soft. Keep it aside. Heat groundnut oil in a pan and add garlic, curry leaves, turmeric and chilli powder, cook for three minutes and add tomatoes and cook until soft.Now add the chicken and sauce for five minutes on high heat. Add cilantro stems, tamarind nectar and moong bean along with water. Add more water if required. Pinch of salt. Let it simmer until chicken is 90 per cent cooked. Now, roast the rasam spice ingredients in a tsp of oil (add asafoetida after the whole spices are roasted). Blend it all together and add it to the simmering chicken rasam base. Continue cooking the chicken until fully cooked. Adjust the seasoning and turn the heat off after adding rasam spice blend simmer for not more than 12-15 minutes.For tempering, add sesame oil and bring it almost to smoke, add mustard and let it splutter. Add all the whole spices and cook it for two minutes and then shallots until light brown. Once again adjust the seasoning, add the coriander leaves and enjoy it out of the pot or strain it and have the broth alone. I prefer to have with chicken and other vegetablesChef Atul KochharChef, restaurateur & entrepreneurFavourite immunity- boosting recipe:Lasooni dalFor chef Atul, this easy recipe from Punjab is what works bestWhy? In Indian vegetarian families, lentil dishes are the main focus of the meal, replacing the meat. This is an easy recipe from Punjab, with a pronounced garlic flavour. Garlic has been part of Indian diet since times immemorial. It boosts immunity and is known to help kill cancer cells, especially colon cancer. Benefits come from raw and cooked garlic  not supplements. Its known to work as an anti-inflammatory, especially as a rub for inflamed joints and muscles. Garlic improves cardiovascular health, it gives better hair and skin and protects your food. When wild garlic is in season, chop the leaves and add at the end for an extra garlic hit, as well as for the colour.Nutritionists notes: Lentils are a good source of zinc and Vitamin B6 that help support our immune system. Allicin is the magic component that gives garlic its immunity-boosting properties. However, to unlock benefits of garlic, crush, mince or chop it and keep away from heat for about 10 minutes before cooking.Recipe: Lasooni dalServes 44 garlic cloves1 small thin green chilli200g split yellow moong dal2 teaspoons ground turmericSeveral sprigs of fresh corianderSea saltFor the tadka4 garlic cloves1 tomato onion2 tablespoons rapeseed or vegetable oil1 teaspoon cumin seeds2 teaspoons ground coriander teaspoon red chilli powder, or to taste teaspoon garam masalaMethod:Bring 750ml of water to the boil in a large covered saucepan and assemble all the ingredients and other equipment before you begin. You also need a sieve and a saut or frying pan. Peel and finely chop the garlic cloves. Remove the stalk from the green chilli, if necessary, and split the chilli lengthways, but leave it whole. Rinse the lentils in the sieve with cold water, then add them to the boiling water and stir in the garlic, green chilli and turmeric. Return the water to the boil, then boil the lentils, uncovered, for 15 minutes, or until they are tender. When the lentils are tender, stir in extra water if they are too dry for you. Meanwhile, to make the tarka, peel and finely chop the garlic cloves. Finely chop the tomato. Peel and finely chop the onion. Heat the rapeseed oil over a medium-high heat in the pan. Add the garlic and cumin seeds and stir until the seeds crackle. Add the onion with a pinch of salt and continue to stir until the onion is lightly browned. Add the ground coriander, chilli powder and garam masala, and stir for 30 seconds to cook the spices. Watch closely so they do not burn. Stir in the tomatoes, lower the heat and continue stirring until they soften and break down, pressing down with your spoon or spatula. Stir the tarka mixture into the lentils and bring to the boil.Just before serving, rinse and finely chop the coriander sprigs. Stir half the chopped coriander into the lentils, then adjust the seasoning with salt, if necessary. Sprinkle over the remaining chopped coriander.Chef Ranveer BrarChef & television hostFavourite immunity-boosting recipe:Ashwagandha-Amla- Hibiscus Iced TeaChef Ranveer Brar picks traditional ingredients as reliable immunity boostersWhy? I believe that our traditional ingredients and our traditional food medicine have enough power to heal and make us resilient. I have spent most of the lockdown trying to research five immunity building ingredients in our food: peepramul, ashwagandha, turmeric, amla and mulethi. Ashwagandha, also called the Indian ginseng, is an ancient medicinal herb. Its known to help reduce stress levels and keep depression at bay. Hibiscus has natural antioxidants and is good for the heart. And amla is packed with Vitamin C and is a natural diuretic.Nutritionists Notes:An all-rounder that can support various features of the immune response. Mulethi keeps the respiratory tract healthy; peepramul acts as a natural pain reliever; ashwagandha, a potent adaptogen, reduces stress and improves the bodys defence system through cell-mediated immunity; turmeric is popularly known for bringing inflammation down, and amla is an excellent storehouse of Vitamin C.Recipe: Hibiscus teaServes 2Ingredients:For immunity tea masala2 tbsp mulethi Powder1 tsp ashwagandha Powder tsp peepli Powder1 pinch turmeric1 tbsp amla JuiceFor Tea2 cup water2-4 large dry hibiscus petals2 tbsp. Honey tsp immunity tea masalaA few mint leaves1 tsp lime juiceMethodOn medium heat, place water in a saucepan and bring it to boil. Turn off the heat. Now add dried hibiscus petals, immunity tea masala, mint leaves and keep for five minutes or more. Pour hot hibiscus tea it in a glass, mix in honey, lime juice and enjoy. Alternatively, let the tea cool down to room temperature and serve.Chef Nelly RobinsonChef-Owner, Nel, Sydney, AustraliaFavourite immunity-boosting recipe:Green Pea Vellouti with Cured Ham and Fresh PeaChef Nelly Robinson believes in the immunity-boosting qualities of green peasWhy? At Nel, we use a lot of ingredients like citrus, ginger and garlic that are very good for your immune system, but one of my favourites is a green pea vellouti with cured ham and fresh pea. Green pea has Vitamin C, which is good for fighting viruses and good for the immune system.Nutritionists Notes: Green peas are packed with Vitamin C, antioxidants and flavonoids that help build strong immunity. As a good source of fibre, peas help support gut health, which is closely related to a well-built immune system.Recipe: Pea and Ham SoupServes 10Ingredients:For the pork hock terrine2 Raw ham hocks3 bunches coriander root4 garlic cloves4 shallots50g ginger3 carrots1 stick celery1 leekPeppercornsStar aniseJuniperFennel seed4 gold leaf gelatineMethod:Place in a pot the ham hocks, coriander, shallot, ginger, carrots, celery, leek, peppercorns, star anise, juniper, fennel seeds in a pot and fill with water, bring to boil and simmer for four to five hours until the meat falls off the bone, drain and strain the stock and reduce, while the stock is reducing pick the meat off the hock and place in a bowl.

This dance of death cant go on in a democracyRead the writing on the wall. The tacit remarks by Prime Minister Narendra Modi during a victory speech following the NDA win in Bihar left no room for suspense that it was directed at Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee and the importance BJP was attaching to the West Bengal elections scheduled in April-May next year.From a fervent push to roll out the Citizenship Amendment Act to relentless attacks on the ruling TMC government over its alleged minority appeasement and political violence  the BJP seems to have put in place a meticulously planned election strategy months in advance. However, for the saffron party, which has had a limited presence in the state for decades, Bengal holds paramount importance since it is the missing link for its domination of the east and the northeast.TMC supremo Mamata Banerjee with state minister and leaders in Kolkata.

(Express photo by Partha Paul)Facing anti-incumbency, TMC looks for 3rd termWell aware of the challenge at hand, the TMC, which has now been in power for nearly 10 years and faces anti-incumbency, has sought to turn the election narrative into an insider vs outsider contest  pushing the idea that the BJP has brought in people from outside who do not understand Bengal and its culture. Besides, the party, which has roped in political strategist Prashant Kishor to fine tune its campaign, has been stressing on development works done by the Mamata Banerjee government.Read | Double blow for Mamata as Suvendu Adhikari, Jitendra Tiwari quit TMCThe BJP sprang a surprise by increasing its tally from two seats to 18 in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. To check the saffron surge, the TMC has gone on an overdrive in announcing new schemes besides making sure that its previous welfare programmes stay fresh on the minds of the people.With BJP leaving nothing to chance, the run-up to the 2021 elections will see Mamata holding more than 600 rallies and meetings  doing her reputation of a street fighter no harm.

(File)Among them, the renewed Swastha Sathi scheme has struck a chord among the citizens, with lakhs standing in serpentine queues to enrol themselves for the programme that will enable the insurance holder and his family to avail of treatment up to Rs 5 lakh. The decision came amid BJPs charge that the TMC government was depriving the people of the state by not implementing the Centres Ayushman Bharat scheme.The party has also launched the Duare Sarkar (government at doorstep) outreach programme, which will ensure people receive the benefits of 11 state-run welfare schemes. TMC leaders and workers are set to reach out to around 10 million households in the next few days to spread the word on the schemes.Also read | BJP releases TMC Fail Card, minister replies even Centre recognises our featsHowever, internal rebellions and dissident voices from within the party have come as a headache for Mamata Banerjee, with just 4 months left for elections to the 294-member Assembly.

Besides, party MLA Mihir Goswami also crossed over to the BJP.After Roy switched sides in 2017, he brought with him several senior TMC leaders, including Saumitra Khan and Anupam Hazra, to the BJP fold. After Roy switched sides in 2017, he brought with him several senior TMC leaders, including Saumitra Khan and Anupam Hazra, to the BJP fold.Moreover, this will also be the first election for Mamata Banerjee without her second-in-command and trusted lieutenant Mukul Roy on her side. Being called BJPs trump card in next years elections, Roy, a master strategist, has been made the BJP national vice-president recently. After Roy switched sides in 2017, he brought with him several senior TMC leaders, including Saumitra Khan and Anupam Hazra, to the BJP fold.Interestingly, TMC was once the beneficiary of this politics of defection during its first term in power, when it ended the Left Fronts 34-year rule and formed the government by winning 227 seats in the 294-member Assembly in alliance with the Congress and Socialist Unity Centre of India (Communist). TMC itself won 184 seats. Soon after, several Congress MLAs joined the TMC ranks and Left leaders too joined the bandwagon following the partys clinical show in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, where it won 34 of the 42 seats. In 2012, Mamata withdrew support to the UPA government at the Centre, protesting against FDI in retail, increase in the price of diesel.Read | Bengal polls: BJP wants TMC to target it, make it main oppositionWith BJP leaving nothing to chance, the run-up to the 2021 elections will see Mamata holding more than 600 rallies and meetings  doing her reputation of a street fighter no harm.

(Express Archive) On September 14, 2016, CM Mamata Banerjee had handed over land documents to farmers in Singur. (Express Archive)Singur, Nandigram  Mamatas springboardSingur became the epicentre of protests by farmers over the then Left Front governments decision to grant about 900 acres of land to Tata for its Nano factory. Mamata took the protest to Kolkata and held a fast for 25 days against the land acquisition at Singur, leading to the auto major abandoning the project in September 2008.Similarly, a special economic zone (SEZ) proposed by the then Left Front government saw farmers in Nandigram erupt in protests in January 2007 led by TMC. At least 14 people were killed in police firing on agitators against land acquisition on March 14, 2007. In fact, it was Suvendu Adhikari who closely coordinated the TMCs movement on the ground, earning his stripes and getting recognition within the party brass.Mamata Banerjee at the rally in Chandipur village, 18 km from Nandigram.

(Express archive photo: Partha Paul)The 2016 Assembly elections saw the CPM and Congress campaigning aggressively but only to witness the TMC thundering back to power for a second term, increasing its seats to 211. The Left parties saw a massive erosion in their support bases, with most of their rank and file moving en masse to the TMC. The Congress too lost veteran leader Manas Bhunia, a former president of the West Bengal Pradesh Congress Committee, to the TMC.Erosion of Left, Congress support gives BJP a sneakThe erosion in support for traditional parties in Bengal, especially the Left parties, provided the BJP an opening into the political arena, turning them into a formidable force.Many in the saffron party consider Bengal the partys birthplace since its founder Shyama Prasad Mookerjee hailed from the state. Besides, the Bharatiya Jana Sangh, the BJPs predecessor, had won two Lok Sabha seats and nine assembly seats in Bengal in 1952.The BJPs recent rise in Bengal can be gauged from these numbers: In the 2011 Assembly elections, BJP garnered only 4.06 per cent votes and failed to open its account while in 2016, it won only three seats. Its vote share jumped to 10.16 per cent. It must be noted that the 2016 Assembly poll was held two years after the BJP stormed to power in the Centre on the back of a Modi wave.West Bengal BJP Mahila Morcha Chief Locket Chatterjee holds a trishul during a religious procession to celebrate Ram Navami in Birbhum. (PTI) West Bengal BJP Mahila Morcha Chief Locket Chatterjee holds a trishul during a religious procession to celebrate Ram Navami in Birbhum. (PTI)The foothold by BJP encouraged organisations such as the RSS, the VHP and the Bajrang Dal, which had little presence in the state earlier, to become more assertive. Around April 2017, the RSS-BJP combine started organising Ram Navami celebrations across districts  slowly making their way into the political space.Over the next two years, the state witnessed unprecedented armed processions for Ram Navami, with several of them marked by clashes and arson  Hooghly in 2017, Raniganj and Asansol and Purulia in 2018. TMC also started taking out its own Ram Navami processions.The first indications of BJPs work paying off came in the 2018 panchayat elections, where it won 18 per cent votes, despite the TMCs uncontested wins in 33 per cent of the panchayats.2019 LS election turns BJP into formidable opponentIt was the 2019 Lok Sabha elections that saw the saffron party making massive electoral gains, relegating the Congress and once-powerful Left Front to the fringes. The BJP, which had won two seats five years ago, won 18 of the 42 constituencies, seeing its vote share rise to 40.64 per cent, just 3 per cent less than the TMCs, and bagging seats all the way from North Bengal to Jangalmahal. Analysis showed that the votes came principally from Adivasis, backward castes and Dalits.From the outset, the BJP has mounted a formidable social media campaign to paint Mamata Banerjee biased toward the Muslim community. In 2019, a video of her angry response to BJP workers chanting Jai Shri Ram at her went viral.TMC has a strong support base among the minorities in Bengal, who constitute 27 per cent of the total population. With talks around CAA and NRC resurfacing in recent days, courtesy BJP leaders like Kailash Vijayvargiya and party chief JP Nadda, the minority vote is likely to rally behind Banerjee even though Asaduddin Owaisis AIMIM may turn to play spoilsport for the TMC. In order to counter the Hindutva narrative, Mamata Banerjee has started giving stipends to purohits in crematoriums.Prime Minister Narendra Modi receives a memento at an election campaign rally in support of the BJP candidates, ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections at Rash Mela Ground in Cooch Behar district of West Bengal. (PTI Photo) Prime Minister Narendra Modi receives a memento at an election campaign rally in support of the BJP candidates, ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections at Rash Mela Ground in Cooch Behar district of West Bengal. (PTI Photo)The CAA narrative is being seen as BJPs bid to appease the influential Matua community voters  who dominate nearly 90 Assembly segments, concentrated mostly in the North and South 24 parganas, and form 17 per cent of the electorate. The Matuas, who are Namasudras, a Scheduled Caste group, trace their ancestry to East Bengal, and many of them entered West Bengal after Partition and after the formation of Bangladesh.After Home Minister Amit Shah had lunch at a Matua refugees home recently, Mamata has tried to revive her lost connect with the community by saying that Matuas had already been identified as Indian citizens and there was no question of giving them new citizenship.Prime Minister Narendra Modi addresses BJPs Save Democracy rally at Durgapur in West Bardhaman district of West Bengal in 2019. (PTI Photo) Prime Minister Narendra Modi addresses BJPs Save Democracy rally at Durgapur in West Bardhaman district of West Bengal in 2019. (PTI Photo)The BJP, of course, has a weak spot: lack of a chief ministerial face. Party leaders have hinted that it will again rely on Prime Minister Narendra Modis charisma to counter Mamata Banerjees popular appeal, which seems to have remained intact despite Saradha and Narada corruption scams rocking the TMC boat.The saffron party has made the political violence allegedly instigated by TMC against its workers an election issue, coining slogans like Ebar Bangla, parle shamla (Save Bengal if you can this time).The recent attack on BJP national president JP Naddas convoy didnt help Bengals reputation and the party seeking to ratchet the issue up in the coming days. BJP state president Dilip Ghosh has claimed that more than 120 party activists had been killed by TMC-sheltered goons in the state in recent times.As the pace of campaigning heats up, it remains to be seen if the BJP, which has set itself a target of 200 seats in next years elections, can herald a new era in West Bengal politics or will Didi (as Mamata is fondly called) be back for a third consecutive term.

But as it is said, the show must go on. And true to this motto, people have slowly started travelling, including Bollywood celebs. A host of them jetted off to the Maldives to live the sun, sand and sea life, making the island nation one of the top searched locations online. And needless to say, pictures from their #beachvacay gave us major FOMO.If youre looking to go on a beach holiday to ring in Christmas and the New Year, here are some celeb-approved outfits to take style cues from:Neon is something that can never go out of style, and Sonakshi Sinha would agree. The actor, who recently returned from her vacation in the Maldives, was seen sporting a neon green dress and matching floaters. She kept the accessories minimal, and teamed her outfit with a pair of sunglasses as she struck a pose against the backdrop of a picturesque sunset.If you want to go for something comfortable, yet super stylish, a kaftan is the way to go. Actor Hina Khan went for this easy breezy ensemble, while on a holiday, in shades of blue and white. She teamed her outfit with a cute pair of flats, sunglasses and a scarf, and kept makeup to the minimum. Uber-chic, wouldnt you say?What better way to ring in the New Year than a lovely candlelight dinner on the shore with your better half! Take inspo from actor-singer Sophie Choudry, who looked radiant in an orange, floral print Nandita Mahtani maxi dress. Holding a glass of wine, she looked ethereal against the backdrop of the beautiful Maldivian sky.Blue is a colour that exudes calm, soothing vibes, and this beautiful snap of actor Kajal Aggarwal is just that. The newlywed, on her honeymoon with her husband Gautam Kitchlu, let her hair down in a beautiful blue and white check crop top and pants. With minimal makeup, she completed her look with a pair of hoops and nude heels.Rakul Preet Singh, who was also at a beach vacation in the island nation, teaches us how to style stripes. The actor opted for a colour-coordinated bikini top and trousers with blue and mustard yellow stripes, as she basked in sunshine.While packing for your #beachvacay there are a few things to keep in mind. Take lots of florals and bright colours. Silhouettes could be flowy and flimsy. Your transparent kaftans and scarves will come handy for this trip. If youre packing a bikini, make sure it is not only stylish but also comfortable. You can glam up through sarongs and accessories, instead, suggests stylist Isha Bhansali, adding, Men can pair their colourful trunks with metal or leather jewellery to add some swag. One can also add lots of colour in their sandals.If a beach vacation isnt your cup of tea and you prefer to holiday in the hills or someplace cold, Bhansali recommends choosing the right fabric. Instead of bundling up in layers, go for pure wool fabrics thatll give you enough warmth. Invest in a wool coat and a jumper. Also, since its a holiday, add some bright winter accessories. Spending the entire holiday in neutral shades can get grim, she adds.Author tweets @srinidhi_gkFor more stories follow Facebook and Twitter",MUSTARD OIL

Even within the same State, the feast is influenced by history, seasoned with flavours of the tradewinds that brought diverse communities to India, and made with local ingredients and spices. Join us as we pull up a chair at dining tables across the countryWhere rose cookies bloomSoft white appam surrounded by lacy, browned crisp edges, and stew are the staples for a typical Christmas breakfast in Kerala, along with rich plum cake and homemade wine.However, depending on the region and the church one belongs to, breakfast, brunch and lunch vary widely from appam and duck curry or stew in Kuttanad and Kottayam to a seafood fiesta in Kollam.Renu Philip says that in the old days, a cook used to stay at her husbands ancestral home in Kottayam to prepare food for the extended family. Chicken roast or duck roast was a must along with a wide range of meats.Jaikumari Rajenesh serves steaming hot puttu, pork cooked in the Mavadi style and plum cake, a typical breakfast staple on the day of Christmas in many homes in Nagercoil | Photo Credit: Jaikumari RajeneshVeteran plantation owners in their eighties and nineties remember the game meat that used to be a speciality during the season: when venison, wild boar and more were roasted and curried.My late mother, Annie Mathappan, used to make several ethnic dishes for the festival; snacks such as cheepappam, rose cookies, kul kul, cakes and homemade wine  recalls Jessie Ignatius, a resident of Kollam.Towards the South, especially among families with roots in Kanyakumari, which was once a part of erstwhile Travancore, breakfast is incomplete without pork and puttu. After church, we have breakfast at my mothers place in Nagercoil, and then we go visiting our relatives. The pork, cooked with roasted masala and tamarind, is almost a shade of ebony. We cant have enough of it, says interior decorator Jaikumari Rajenesh. Another season special is orappan, which is cooked with rice flour, coconut milk and jaggery. After it is cooked into a halwa, it is baked for a crust on the top, explains Jaikumari.Pork cooked in the Mavadi style and puttu is a popular breakfast on the day of Christmas in many places in Nagercoil | Photo Credit: Jaikumari RajeneshIn Thrissur, no celebration is complete without pork cooked with Chinese potatoes and served with appam, rice and everything else.In Puthenthope, a fishing village in Thiruvananthapuram, families head straight to the beach after midnight mass.

At around 10 am on Christmas Day, all of us go to church. After prayers, we assemble outside the church for tea and sing together. Meanwhile, a select group of men and women would be busy cooking and arranging the dinner for that evening. By 3 pm, everyone is called to the church by ringing the bell, and all of us (about 300 to 350) would have dinner together in the church compound, he says.No feast is complete without pork and sticky rice, and usually there are different kinds of beef and fish dishes. Mepoh is a pork dish that is flavoured with shijou, which is gathered from the jungles; banana stem is curried. We have many herbs, roots and leaves that are used in our cooking. Paaknam is a spicy pancake made of besan, vegetables, and dried, fermented fish wrapped in a banana leaf and steamed, he explains. By 6 pm, the Christmas choir and worship begins, and around 8 pm, most families go home to continue the celebrations while some might remain, cracking jokes and enjoying the banter.A typical Naga feast on Christmas Day in Dimapur, Nagaland | Photo Credit: Thsope MedoMeziwang Zeliang, a member of the Zeliang tribe in Nagaland, says community feasts are a common feature of churches in the North-east. Volunteers are selected from among the men and women to do the cooking and chopping for the feast, which is invariably different kinds of pork dishes such as pork innards, smoked pork with axone (fermented soyabean) and pork in bamboo, rice, chutney made of fermented mustard leaves and endless cups of Phika cha (black tea). Dessert is usually fresh fruits; cakes and wine are not part of traditional feasts though many are adapting it now into the Christmas day celebrations, she explains.At her church, Zeliangrong Baptist Church in Dimapur, the feast is after the morning service. After the feast, most of them stay on as there are music competitions, stand-up comedy and other entertainment. We go home after the evening service and then go to meet relatives, she adds.A Portuguese thaliEast Indian Catholics are natives of Mumbai, Palghar and Thane. The community has a Portuguese influence, and so their cuisine overlaps with that of Catholics from Goa and Mangaluru. But there are a few dishes that are unique to the East Indian community. For instance, only East Indians make thali sweets, a white cake that gets its name because it is baked in a tray. Made from coconut, semolina, egg whites and ground almonds or cashews, this Christmas treat is also made during traditional East Indian weddings, says Vellani Sequeria, a baker based in Mumbais western suburb, Vasai.Christmas Day is a hectic time for Valeni as she makes an elaborate lunch that consists of roast chicken stuffed with cooked vegetables, vindaloo and sarapatel  two dishes that they share with the Goan Catholics. Mutton stew is eaten with fugias, a deep-fried bread that is slightly sweet and specific to the community.Another must at the Christmas spread is the duck moilee. Traditionally, Moilee is made with duck meat but nowadays people prefer chicken as it is easily available and easier to cook. The most important ingredient for this dish is bottle masala, which is found only in the kitchens of East Indians. It is made with over 30 to 32 ingredients that include red chillies, poppy seeds and a range of whole spices, Vellani adds. The day ends with a glass of khimad, a spiced liquor whose base is a concoction made with cinnamon, cloves, cardamom, turmeric powder and tea powder, all boiled in water.Armenian wood-fired cakesFor Christmas eve, there are all kinds of meats and roasts at the home of Brunnel Arathoon and Anthony Khatchaturian in Kolkata. Once the family returns from midnight mass, they get together for a brunch that would also have plenty of leftovers from the previous evenings dinner. We make sandwiches with the different roasts. There are cakes, homemade wines and a must is a pie made with minced beef, says Brunnel, a well-known home chef in Kolkata. While the Armenian Christians, one of the oldest denominations in India, celebrate Christmas on December 25, the official celebrations happen on January 6 at the Church of Holy Nazareth in Armenian Street.Brunnel Arathoons Armenian cakes bakes on wood-fired stoves and seasoned with cinnamon and nutmeg have buyers from all over India. Unlike plum cakes, these cakes no fruits | Photo Credit: Anthony KhatchaturianThen I cook the Armenian dishes that have been passed on to me by my mother and grandmother. Rice pilaf, harrissa and dolmades are made then, says Brunnel. Anthony remarks that the Armenian cakes that she makes in wood-fired ovens, which are made without any fruits, are much in demand all over India. They are seasoned with cinnamon and nutmeg, he adds.Heirloom recipesIf you were to drop in at an Anglo-Indian home during Christmas, chances are that you would be served homemade Old Temperance (OT), says Chennai-based Harry MacLure, editor of the magazine Anglos in the Wind. OT, he explains, is an alcohol-free, ginger-based drink that used to be made in most Anglo-Indian homes with hand-medown recipes.A vintage snap of Christmas celebrations of the Anglo-Indian community in Chennai | Photo Credit: Anglos In The WindHowever, you are free to have something stronger or wine but OT used to be standard fare in most homes along with plum cake and seed cake, which was flavoured with aniseed. In addition, there would be kul kuls, rose cookies and Dhol-Dhol, a halwa-like sweet made of puttu rice powder, coconut, jaggery, ghee. It used to be made on firewood stoves outside the house, he says, adding, It was a Portuguese favourite that has been adapted by Anglo-Indians and is a Christmas favourite.The Anglo-Indians usually attend midnight mass and like to have a late brunch on December 25, consisting of eggs, bacon, sausages, ham, salami, breads, cheese and so on. So lunch is usually after 3 pm when families and friends get together for a leisurely feast with several kinds of meat roasts and pies. We used to have coconut rice, ball curry (made of minced meat), devils chutney, pork vindaloo, sweets, cakes and roasted chicken, he recalls. He remembers that turkey roast and duck roast were common when he was growing up in the Railway Colony in Tiruchi, but nowadays it has been replaced by chicken as turkey is harder to cook and needed a lot of space. Lunch was a grand affair with friends from all communities and families gathering together. This time, the gatherings might be smaller but the spirit of Christmas will be the same, he asserts.(With inputs from Aishwarya Upadhye)",MUSTARD OIL

The 80-bed hospital constructed at an estimated cost over ` one crore was inaugurated by Director General of Prisons Santosh Kumar Upadhyay on Saturday. The hospital has also six high security cells for treatment of aggressive patients.Earlier, prisoners suffering from mental illness were being admitted to SCB Medical College and Hospital, Cuttack for treatment. Now, the they will be treated in the jail itself. The hospital is functioning from an exclusive block, said Choudwar Jail Superintendent Subhakanta Mishra.At present, the jail has 924 inmates of whom, 74 are suffering from mental health issues. Due to the high number of mentally ill prisoners, we were facing serious problems in providing necessary treatment to them. Now, these prisoners will be treated in the jail itself. Only critical cases will be referred to SCB Mental Health Institute, Mishra said.Upadhyay, who inspected different wings and activities of the prison, also stressed augmentation of the jail food processing unit. Considering the mushrooming adulterating food units in the city, we have planned to enhance the output of different food items produced by the jail inmates and their marketing by setting up stalls at different places, said Upadhyay.This will help in increasing revenue and enhancing inmates income. While steps are being taken to increase the production and marketing of mustard oil, efforts are on for marketing of flour which is now being prepared by the inmates and used in making breads for the prisoners. We have also decided to go for preparing turmeric powder and gram flour at the food processing unit, he said.",MUSTARD OIL

Meet some who published their works this year:Of love, loss and hopeSet in colonial Punjab, Dusk over the Mustard Fields is a poignant story, inspired by true events, steered by political and social upheavals of the Partition.Married at sixteen, Nimmos destiny hangs in the balance as she fails to meet the expectations of her debonair husband, Lt. Hukum Singh. This nostalgic journey into undivided Punjab gives us intimate and vivid insights into the now-lost rural Punjabi culture and a disquieting peep into the lived identities and angst of women in a deeply patriarchal society. The debut novel of Ranjit Powar, a city-based psychologist and activist, mesmerises as it conjures up the era of the British Indian army, winding through cantonments, malls and brass bands.Homeward BoundIn the Land of the Lovers, a Punjab Qissa by Chandigarh-based Sakoon Singh released in August 2020 is a novel about Punjab that embodies a historical sweep mediated through the perspective of a young woman artist, Nanaki who teaches Textile Design at the Arts College in Chandigarh. The novel, a bildungsroman, is mostly meditative, luminous prose that highlights the details of her childhood, a difficult teenage love and her professional struggles in a quaint Chandigarh neighbourhood.An alumnus of Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi and Panjab University, Chandigarh, Sakoon teaches English literature and Cultural Studies at Chandigarh and is a recipient of the Fulbright Fellowship at the University of Texas at Austin. The novel, she says, is a coming-of-age saga, at the same time rooted in a very specific socio-cultural milieu. It flits between Pre- Partition Punjab and contemporary Chandigarh. The descriptions of the city and intricate embroideries as experienced by the young artist and her myriad struggles, sometimes as a witness and sometimes as a participant.Whose war is it anywayMy novel brings alive the tragic story behind the Great War, shares bureaucrat-turned-writer Mandeep Rai, whose new novel The Wheel of Destiny: A Story of the Great War encapsulates the zeitgeist of the Great War. Released recently, the novel brings alive the intriguing story of the First World War. The novel, adds the author, holds a stark mirror to the fact that wars are fought not for national interest, but for national pride. The story kicks off against the backdrop of the Agadir crisis of 1911, and culminates with the Battle of the Marne. It fascinates me how nations, in a bid to enhance national security, somehow end up getting entangled in disputes. The Great War, for instance, broke out of a clear blue sky. My novel dwells on the way chauvinistic fervour had propelled Europe into the vortex of disaster. The underlying theme of my action-packed novel is the utter futility of war, he reflects.Military MattersAn author of five books, Major Navdeep Singh, a practicing Advocate in the Punjab & Haryana High Court released his latest book, Military Pensions: Commentary, Case Law & Provisions this year. The book, he explains, is a 33-chapter reference book on the subject. The founder President of the Armed Forces Tribunal Bar Association, Major Singh has been a national service volunteer-reservist with the Territorial Army in the past His book prior to this, Maimed by the System, was a collection of real-life stories of defence personnel, disabled soldiers and their kin who had to fight the system to claim their dues.A historical perspectiveCity-based journalist Vibhor Mohan traces the history of the capital city from the prehistoric times to the present in his book titled Chandigarh Unmasked, A Young Citys Harappan Past. A fictional account woven around the key milestones in the citys lifespan of 70 years, the story promises to make the readers see the citys existing landmarks in a new light. At the same time, the novel seeks to draw attention to the possibility that the planned, modern city could be located on an equally well-planned prehistoric Indus Valley Civilization site buried underneath. Where the book cherishes Chandigarhs past, it also highlights the issues that have cropped with the city now bursting at its seams.The key characters in the story consider the citys Harappan connection either as a blessing or a curse. They also interpret the changing times of Chandigarh differently. What if Indias first modern city stands on a glorious prehistoric past? Im sure that the chance discovery of Harappan artefacts in the 1960s ignited the imagination of many city residents, as it did in case of the storys protagonist, who even falls for a Harappan muse. The grid system of road networks in Chandigarh and Mohenjo Daro is a strange coincidence. Instead of presenting already well-known facts about Chandigarh, I wanted to narrate the story in a witty and playful style, reflected Vibhor. The second part of the story is set in 2014 and focuses on the growing aspirations of Chandigarh residents.Sweet SuccessI couldnt have written this book 15 years back, for it is a result of my life learnings, shares Vivek Atray, talking about his third book, Finding Success Within, 52 Life Skills for Young Indians, the first book in the motivational series that the author plans to write. Atray dives deep into his varied experiences as a cricketer, an engineer, an IAS officer and a celebrated motivational speaker to write this book on 52 golden nuggets for success and happiness. Finding Success Within, released this year, covers and uncovers topics as diverse as presentation and networking skills, innovation and entrepreneurship; in fact the entire set of skills and qualities that professionals need to be successful in their careers.The book also focuses on life skills and personal matters like choosing a life partner, maintaining relationships and parenting skills as well as the need to practice calmness and most importantly, meditation. There is a constant need for each of us to polish our edges, to keep the creative flame burning bright and to seek lasting inner peace instead of transient pleasures, says the author, adding that he hopes the book will help people to improve career prospects and enhance the quality of their lives.The mystery roadA quintessential adventure story, the novel, The Double Force and the Fallen Kingdom by Jaiveer Singh Katial is about a pair of adventure-seeking twins who decide to explore a theft in the neighbourhood, little knowing that they would be entangled in a war against the big evil and embark on an intergalactic journey. A student of Class VI at St Johns High School, Jaiveer started writing this novel at the age of nine and promises that it will absorb readers of all age groups.The Buddhist way of lifeThe author Dr. Sarup Sailanis book Influence of Buddhism on selected works of world literature (research work) looks into the narrative of Buddhism. It provides a never-before account of the time when Buddha was conceived. It further illuminates the concept and purpose of Buddhism not only as a philosophy but as a way of life within the circumference of nature. This is Sailanis attempt at helping others understand the concept and purpose of Buddhism through its influence on major texts.

Read MoreNEW DELHI: The farmers protesting on Delhi borders for more than a month against the three agri laws on Saturday threatened to hold a tractor rally towards the national capital on Republic Day if their demands were not met. Meanwhile, the main opposition has asked the centre to withdraw the legislation and not be obstinate.Here are the key developments of the day:1. Hardening their position ahead of the next round of talks to be held with the government on January 5, protesting farmer unions said they will take out a tractor parade towards Delhi on January 26, when the country will celebrate Republic Day, if their demands were not met. Talking to mediapersons, the union leaders said time has come for ""decisive"" action as their demands have not been addressed by the government yet. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson will be the chief guest at the Republic Day parade at Rajpath on January 26. Farmer leader Darshan Pal Singh said their proposed parade will be called ""Kisan Parade"" and it will be held after the Republic Day parade. Thousands of farmers, mostly from Punjab and Haryana, have been camping at three Delhi border points - Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur for more than a month, demanding repeal of the three farm laws , a legal guarantee for minimum support price for their crops and two others. ""We intend to be peaceful and we told the government during the talks that it has only two options - either repeal the three laws or use force to evict us (from Delhi border points). The time has come for decisive action here, and we have chosen January 26 as the Republic Day represents the supremacy of the people,"" the union leaders said.2. A 75-year-old farmer protesting against the centre's new agri laws allegedly hanged himself at the Uttar Pradesh-Delhi border in Ghazipur in the morning. Sardar Kashmir Singh, a native of Bilaspur in Uttar Pradesh's Rampur district, hanged himself in a mobile toilet using a rope, police said. Deputy Superintendent of Police of Indirapuram Anshu Jain said that a suicide note written in Gurumukhi was found on him. Singh wrote in the suicide note that the government must repeal these farm laws as these are against the interests of farmers, according to a leader of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU). In the purported suicide note, Singh expressed anguish that though some people from Punjab died during the agitation, no one from Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand has sacrificed his life for the cause. He also requested the Sikh community to help his family marry off his two granddaughters and to address the domestic problems being faced by his married daughter. His body was handed over to his grandchildren who too were part of the protest in Ghazipur, police officer Jain said.3. Samajwadi Party (SP) president Akhilesh Yadav termed the death of a 57-year-old farmer due to heart attack while protesting against the centre's new farm laws at the Ghazipur border as ""disturbing"", and accused the ruling BJP of being ""heartless"". In a Hindi tweet, he said, ""On the first day of the new year itself, the news of the martyrdom of a farmer at the Ghazipur border is disturbing. The farmers are sacrificing their lives in the dense fog and cold, but the ruling party is sitting heartless. The ruthlessness seen in the BJP has never been seen so far."" Mohar Singh died of heart attack while protesting against the farm laws at the Ghazipur border in Ghaziabad on Friday. A resident of Bhagwanpur Nangal village in Baghpat district of Uttar Pradesh, Singh was rushed to a nearby hospital where the doctors declared him brought dead, an official said. Indirapuram Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) Anshu Jain had said that the farmer died of heart attack. Commenting on the incident, the state president of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU), Rajbir Singh, said all the farmers who lost their lives during the protest against the farm laws must get the status of a martyr.4. The Congress urged the government to abandon its ""obstinate attitude"" and agree to the demands of the farmers protesting the new farm laws amid cold weather conditions. Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra said reports of deaths of farmers while protesting at the Delhi border amid harsh winter conditions are ""disturbing"". ""According to media reports, 57 farmers have lost their lives while scores are unwell. The government is showing gross insensitivity by not acceding to the demands of the protesting farmers,"" said the Congress general secretary and its Uttar Pradesh in-charge. Senior Congress leader and former Union minister P Chidambaram saluted the resoluteness of the farmers. ""The government must relent and agree to keep the farm laws in abeyance pending its repeal. Any new law must take into account the needs and desires of the farming community,"" he tweeted.5. The country's rabi foodgrains production including wheat in the ongoing 2020-21 crop year is expected to be better than the previous year's record of 153.27 million tonne, according to agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar. Sowing of rabi (winter) crops is underway. The rabi sowing begins from October immediately after the harvest of kharif (summer) crops. Wheat and mustard are major rabi crops. The crop year runs from July to June. Tomar said the country's agriculture sector performed well during 2020 as foodgrains production rose to a record in the kharif season with farmers working hard despite the COVID-19 pandemic and proving their relevance. ""This year, we hope better foodgrain production in the rabi season than last year (same season),"" he said. For the 2020-21 crop year, the Centre has set a target of a record foodgrains output of 301 million tonne, out of which it expects 151.65 million tonne to come from the rabi season.

In her own words, it will include a massive public sector investment and expenditure push on infrastructure and healthcare.This isnt anything extraordinary but an essential act, because of its welfaristic nature and the multiplier effect on the economy. But what is a matter of concern is whether the promised spending binge entails elements of the Rs 111 lakh crore infrastructure bonanza first announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in August 2019. Given the governments record of repackaging programmes and outlays, such a move will end up as a tasteless reheat of past announcements and must be avoided.Theres nothing wrong in chest-beating about landmark initiatives, but the infrastructure investment pipeline didnt cut the mustard when it was rolled out as a kickstart-the-economy package in 2019 itself. To refresh the devil in the details, every year, the Centre and states spend over Rs 10 lakh crore on infrastructure; so the proposed Rs 111 lakh crore for five years didnt enthuse many.But in FY21, the sum to be spent was significantly higher than usual and it cheered up policy watchers. However, there has been little progress since then. If in December 2019, 44% of the total Rs 111 lakh crore-worth projects were under implementation and Rs 22 lakh crore or 20% were under development stage, it remained so as of December 2020.Moveover, the Centres share translates to only 39%, while an equal sum will be borne by cash-starved states. The remaining 21% has to come from the ailing private sector. One noteworthy development, though, is the creation of the India Investment Grid to handhold all greenfield and brownfield infra projects.It will resolve some of the long-standing issues including delayed permissions and land acquisition, which means project execution should be relatively better. That said, the government must think out of the box to ensure that the expenditure push in FY22 stretches beyond what has already been announced.",MUSTARD OIL

Signed by the company in February for a period of two years, Ganguly also endorses its mustard oil in West Bengal and soya nuggets. Bollywood star, Akshay Kumar is the companys other brand ambassador.While defending its range of cooking oils, the company said this was a temporary interruption and it would continue working with the elegant southpaw, who led the Indian national team to some of its most memorable victories as its captain.Saurav Ganguly became our brand ambassador endorsing our Fortune rice bran oil. The rice bran oil is not a medicine but only a cooking oil. There are several factors which affect heart ailments including dietary and hereditary issues, said Angshu Malik, deputy CEO at Adani Wilmar. We shall continue to work with Saurav and he will continue to be our brand ambassador. We have only taken a temporary break in our TV commercial till we again sit with Saurav and take things forward.This is a very unfortunate incident and can happen with anyone. Recently we heard about a senior IT executive collapsing on a treadmill while exercising. Does that mean the treadmill is bad? Rice bran oil is one of the world's healthiest oils. It contains natural antioxidants. Gamma Oryzonal present in rice bran oil reduces bad cholesterol and improves lipid profile, Malik added.Brand experts, however, had a different view. I do believe there are several issues at play here. There is brand Adani, brand Saurav, and finally the product, oil. The farmer agitation, the association of brand Adani with the ruling dispensation, Sourav and rumours of his political leanings, are all adding to the jamboree of discontent, said brand expert, Harish Bijoor.He urged brands to stay away from politics and religion. Both these subjects divide audiences. Brands love united audiences as all are then their potential consumers. It is, therefore, best for brands to avoid these two subjects altogether, he said.Meanwhile, Ganguly or Dada , as he is fondly called, has been reported to be in a stable condition and set to return home soon from hospital.",MUSTARD OIL

The common ingredient in all of them? PepperThere is a drizzle outside when we sit for lunch.On the menu, is ammas milagu kuzhambu (pepper curry) and hot rice. I scoop a heapful of rice on my plate, add a dash of gingelly oil, and two spoonfuls of the curry. The drizzle becomes a steady downpour and by the time I wolf down the rice, there is thunder and a howling wind. But I am prepared to deal with the weather: the curry, a tangy concoction of pepper, pepper, and more pepper, leaves my palate with a mild burning sensation typical to the spice. It keeps me warm on the inside, at least for a while.Come winter and every part of India starts whipping up winter curries specific to the region. In Tamil Nadu, milagu kuzhambu is a seasonal special. During my childhood, my grandmother would serve this curry or pepper rasam with hot rice and appalam during winters, recalls 74-year-old YouTuber Gita Rajamani, who runs the popular channel Agrahara Recipes from her home in Kallidaikurichi, Tirunelveli district. Back then, in Sirkazhi where I grew up, it would sometimes rain for 15 days straight and this curry was a dinnertime staple to keep warm, she adds.During winters, when nights were dark and the stone mortar and pestle kept in the corner of the house was too cold to be held to make idli batter, milagu kuzhambu came to our rescue, says Gita. Made with plenty of tamarind, that Gita says is a natural preservative, the curry would be stored in a stone pot and was good to be had for 15 days. Pepper was the chief spice employed in Tamil cuisine, she points out. Green and red chillies were actually introduced to us by the Portuguese; but now though, we use more chillies.Pepper Rasam from South India which is very common and popular which can be served with steamed rice and ghee.Pepper was used extensively in winter, in curries and rasams. Betel leaves were used to keep lungs healthy during cold weather, points out Gita. I make a rasam with the leaves; once the regular tamarind rasam is done simmering, I place a betel leaf over it, switch off the stove, cover, and let the juice seep into the rasam, she explains adding that she removes the leaf a little later.In western Tamil Nadu, horsegram dal and rasam are winter delicacies and in places such as Coimbatore where the weather generally leans towards the colder side, the lentil is cooked through the year. In my household, we make kollu paruppu (dal) twice a week, especially during winter since the dish is considered heat-inducing, says Dharchana Muruganandam, who grew up in Pollachi. We make rasam with the water the dal has been cooked in; the dish has crushed shallots in it instead of garlic, she explains.Gita says that horsegram can also be incorporated in a thogayal (thick chutney) by grinding the boiled lentil with onions, tomatoes, pepper, and garlic. It goes well with rasam, she says adding that she spent several years in western Tamil Nadu before she got married. Gita recalls a Tamil saying with a laugh: Elachavanukku ellu, koluthavanukku kollu, which translates to: Sesame for the slim man, horsegram for the plump man, because horsegram helps break down fat in the body.Childhood stapleFood blogger Swayampurna Mishra has a treasure trove of lamb memories to fall back on every winter.She says, Im from Odisha, and my mother would make this amazing lamb curry when I was a child. I remember it being made every single Sunday through the winter: it was familiar and spicy and it would warm us right up.Lamb curry | Photo Credit: Swayampurna MishraShe adds that, admittedly, making a child feel warm was not that mean a feat in her childhood home. It doesnt get as cold in Odisha as it does in parts of the North, but I think every person from that part of the country remembers their childhood lamb curry as a winter ritual.Milagu kuzhambu (pepper curry) recipe:Ingredients2 tsp tamarind paste, turmeric to taste, one sprig curry leaves, 5 to 6 red chillies, a pinch of asafoetida, 1 1/2 tsp fenugreek seeds, 1 1/2 tsp cumin seeds, 1 tsp urad dal, 1 1/2 tsp toor dal, 2 tsp coriander seeds, 1 1/2 tsp pepper corns, 1/2 tsp mustard seeds, gingelly oil to saute, salt to taste, jaggery to tasteMethodRoast pepper and coriander seeds, toor and urad dal, and red chillies with two tsp oil. Introduce half a teaspoon fenugreek seeds, cumin, asafoetida, and curry leaves when the pepper corns start to sputter. Turn off the stove. Now, add salt to taste. Once the mixture cools, grind to a fine paste adding a little water. Heat four to five teaspoons of oil in a pan. Add mustard seeds and once they sputter, add half a teaspoon fenugreek seeds, half a teaspoon cumin seeds, a pinch of asafoetida, turmeric powder, the ground paste, tamarind paste, jaggery, and water to get the runny consistency of a curry.

As diverse as the food offerings in our country are, the science behind them is even more so. And of the veritable army of reluctant chefs created in urban India during lockdown, at least a few must prefer learning these hows and whys, instead of the how-many-teaspoons. That is the gamble Krish Ashok and Penguin Random House have taken with their recent book Masala Lab: The Science of Indian Cooking.With chapters covering everything from zero-pressure cooking to the science of spices and more, the title offers explanations and cheat sheets galore. Tongue-in-cheek writing coupled with scientific explanations by experts make up a large portion of this book, and the result is oddly gripping. Take, for instance, a small segment titled Mouthfeel  Ashok begins by describing the crunch of a pani puri before moving into an aside about decibels, bats and the way that ultrasound travels, and then concluding confidently: We can, it turns out, feel a good pani puri in our bones. Quite literally.I keep clarifying that a lot of what I talk about is applicable to urban Indian cooking, that has evolved in a very specific way over the last few decades. We dont always have access to fresh produce, and the quality of what we get  both meat and vegetables  is dubious, with concerns about pesticides and other things. So we tend to err on the side of overcooking, just to be safe, he says.He points out that because of a lack of inherent flavour in produce, urban Indian cuisine tends to be spice-heavy, while that in rural or small-town India has always been minimal. He adds: I would argue that it is a lot closer to Italian cooking, in that it relies on a fewer but more quality ingredients that are grown locally, giving the example of the magnificently tasty eggplants of Tirunelveli.An added segue is his observation that hinterland cooking is simplistic in technique, with fewer steps, because the rural woman has so much more to do in a day, from collecting water to tending to the fields and so on.Freedom to experimentAshok emphasises, A big part of the book is about trying to find generalised algorithms, for how to make something taste, say, Gujarati or Bengali or Malabari. And thus, free people from having to bother about authenticity: if you use paanch phoron and mustard oil, it is going to taste Bengali no matter what else you do.And what better way to look at regional variations in Indian cooking, than through the lens of everyones favourite feast  the biryani? Ashoks final chapter is dedicated entirely to that one dish, from its various layers of rice and protein to the different spices, techniques and flavour notes preferred in different regions. In this chapter, he writes, We will marshal every single food science trick we have learnt over the last 200 pages or so to make good biryani at home. Does he succeed? That is for the reader to find out.Masala Lab: The Science of Indian Cooking is available at leading bookstores and on Amazon Kindle.",MUSTARD OIL

Mix well and serve.VariationsYou can use any millet instead of rice.While saffron is not added in traditional south Indian pongal, if you wish, you can add it along with a very small pinch of edible camphor.TipsFor pongal, pudu paccha arisi is recommended because it gives a lovely fresh fragrance and turns soft quickly. It is also much cheaper than regular rice variants. Use of pudu paccha arisi is also considered very auspicious during Pongal because its a symbolic celebration of nature and its harvest.Puli Pongal by Jeyashri Suresh(Instagram @Jeyashris Kitchen)IngredientsBroken rice/arisi kurunai: 1 cup Tamarind a lemon sized Sesame oil: 2 tbsp + 2 tsp Mustard seeds: 1/4 tsp Peanuts: 2 tbsp Chana dal: 1 tsp Urad dal: 1 tsp Green chilli: 1 Dried red chilli: 2 Water: 3 1/2 cups Turmeric powder: 1/4 tsp Asafoetida: a generous pinch Curry leaves: few Salt as neededMethodSoak a small lemon-sized tamarind in 1/2 cup hot water for 10 minutes.

Mix well to ensure no lumps are formed.Cover the cooker and pressure-cook for three whistles.Once the pressure is released, open and add two teaspoons of sesame oil.Serve with vadams or appalam.NoteThe water measurement was perfect for this rice kurunai.

Add in the cooked dal and the ground spice powder/paste. Add in a cup of water if needed to adjust consistency. This kozhambu should be a little thicker than regular sambar. Bring to a boil. Cook for two more minutes. Turn the heat off. Temper with mustard seeds, curry leaves and 2-3 red chillies broken to pieces in one tablespoon sesame oil. We dont add chopped cilantro/coriander leaves to this sambar.Red rice ven pongal by Padma Balasubramanian(Instagram @Padma Balasubramanian)IngredientsRed rice: 1 cup Moong dal: 1/4 cup Pepper: 1 tsp Jeera: 1 tsp Hing powder: 1/2 tsp Ginger: a small piece, finely chopped Curry leaves: a few Cashews: 10 Ghee: 2 tbsp Oil: 1 tbspMethodWash and soak red rice for an hour in 3.5 glasses of water. Wash the moong dal, drain water and add it to the soaked red rice. Transfer to a pressure cooker and cook for six whistles. Keep the stove in sim for another five minutes and switch off.

Add edible camphor. Roast a few cashew nuts in ghee and garnish the dish.NotesAny millet like barnyard millet, little millet or thinai works well for this millet akkaravadisal.

Thats how during that time dried and bottled food items especially the condiments like dried onion powder, lemon powder, fried onion ringlets among a gamut of several such other food products.Thats when a city-based entrepreneur Anubhav Bhatnagar, an XLRI alumnus launched a food range with a shelf life of 12-18 months. His startup Zillis is incubated under Atal Incubation Center ALEAP We-hub.The quick DIYs range that also helps to reduce the cooking time have preservatives in them. So while it is about quick food, what assures the same is healthy? Shares Anubhav, The fruits and vegetables have a short shelf life of 7-15 days and they attract fungus and bacteria because of the moisture in them. We follow an age-old technique of dehydration of preserving the food by removing moisture.He cites an example of grandmothers using the process of dehydration by drying chips and papad under the sunlight to remove moisture content.Once dried it can stay up to 1-2 years without attracting fungus and bacteria. Our process is based on the similar concept of drying the fruit and vegetable under hot air to remove moisture content and then making the powder, he adds.He tried making the first product in the kitchen using a microwave oven. I failed multiple times, burnt a lot of onions and garlic to arrive at my desired product. I tried using dehydrated onion and garlic in my curries to understand the difference (good or bad) it brought to my recipes. I was excited to find out that my curries even tasted better and just a spoonful of these powders was enough to bring that natural flavour. Not only did I not have to chop onions and garlic, he says.The powders did not require any roasting as well since they were dehydrated and hence, in concentrated form. This reduced my cooking time almost to half! This is how to we provide RTC products to our customer without compromising on health, he shares. The products that his startup offers are red onion powder, tomato powder, green chilli powder, garlic powder among other items.We also have five blends in our product catalogue and we are consistently working towards launching many more.Kolkata Jhal Muri (Murmura/Puffed Rice) Masala can be used in puffed rice with chopped onions, green chillies, coriander leaves, coconut, peanuts mixed in a small quantity of mustard oil and blended with the goodness of spices which makes it a very tasty and healthy snack.

Sandys cheery new Besant Nagar cafe is a rose-tinted tribute to the past with its old school sandwiches, milkshakes and dcor. A bitter-sweet reminder of our pre-COVID lives.Originally planned as the first of a new line of cafs called Sandys Toasteries, the Besant Nagar space evolved through the many challenges of 2020, and finally opened recently under the familiar flagship brand instead. Now, this is a relaunch of the Sandys brand, says Sandesh Reddy, the founder, adding, We wanted to break away from what we have been doing for the past 12 years. To reinvent ourselves.In times of tumult, such as this, people crave familiarity, leaning on food that reminds them of simpler days. So, not surprisingly, Sandesh has chosen to stick with his core strength, continuing to offer uncomplicated comfort food, with a focus on popular flavours. However, proving that this is a grown up version of his first menu more than a decade ago, the plates are cleverly engineered, harnessing a global array of techniques, recipes and ingredients and influences to create deceptively simple meals. Like the steak sandwich, featuring buttery meat set between thick slices of grilled Texan toast, smeared with mustard and aioli. Or the light, breaded onion rings, steamy inside and crisp outside, topped with microgreens. Or a bowl of hummus, drizzled with olive oil and studded with sturdy chunks of falafel.Desserts are indulgent. The tiny shake shake comprises a thick chocolate shake, topped with a hunk of cake balanced on top of the glass. Of course, theres one for Instagram: Milo tiramisu, designed like a pull up dessert. Im more excited about the fact that there are cortados and Aussie lattes on the menu though: till the vaccine arrives at least we can circle the world on a cloud of caffeine.Sandys Kitchen & Chocolate laboratory is at 5, 4th Main Road, Besant Nagar.The Butterfly EffectNever underestimate a sandwich. They can be wonderful things, as any midnight snacker can attest. At newly-launched Butterfly Effect on Cenotaph Road, popular Kiwi chef Willi Wilson, who was formerly executive Chef at The Park Chennai, has created a line of inventive gourmet sandwiches.The space, launched by architect Junaid Ahmed, is chic and inviting, flooded with natural light. Over a plate of smoky chicken wings, freshly fried and finished with a clingy hot and sweet sauce, Willi says the menu, built around continental and Italian favourites, focuses on food that is sustainable, quick, tasty, fresh.Of course continental food in India has come a long way from the 90s, thanks to Chefs like Willi, moving from stodgy carbs smothered in white sauce and processed cheese to bright inventive takes on classics.For the sandwiches, diners can choose between white bread, wholewheat, baguettes, ciabatta and focaccia.

And not just any kind of saag, but a dish of mustard leaves. Winter, as we know in the north, is the time for sarson ka saag  that creamy dish that so delightfully complements makkey ki roti  or rotis prepared with maize.I studied the menus of the little eateries in and around my neighbourhood to see if anyone was known for its saag and roti. Turned out there was one, Baa Bistro, which had the dish on the menu, along with a Rajasthani thhali. I am fond of Rajasthani food, and gattey ki sabzi  a spicy dish of lentil cakes in gravy  is a particular favourite. So I licked my chops and got ready to place my order.Life is full of little disappointments: It was a rainy night, the delivery agents had called it a day, and I was told that I was not going to get my saag and roti. But, quite like a good hound, once I am on the trail of something, I dont give up easily. I went back to my research, and zeroed in on an old favourite: a small restaurant called SinglaSweets which had fed me little hillocks of bedmi sabzi in kinder times. Singla had sarson ka saag and makkey ki roti, and was delivering (Ph: 9697828888, 011-22232323).The food arrived. And it was so good that I called the owner of the shop to find out about the fare. The trick in the greens was that it was simply cooked  it had neither onions, nor garlic or ginger. It merely had a tempering of ghee and whole red chillies. The roti, again, was surprisingly soft. It was not soaked in ghee, but was nicely moist.I dipped a piece into the saag and popped it into my mouth, and went back to my village, where this was a regular part of our winter fare. I grew up on various kinds of rotis, prepared with millet, maize and gram. There were all kinds of greens too: mustard, fenugreek, and bathua, to name just a few. In the village, of course, a dollop of white butter went on top of the rotis, while the saag was topped with large quantities of ghee. Bliss.Wed also ordered a plate of malai kofta, and that was a rich concoction of cashew, cream, and paneer. But the saag was what the doctor had ordered (without the ghee of course).It rained the next day again, and the heart called out for more saag and roti. I rang up Baa Bistro (9911214567, 9930983076), and found it open.I ordered the saag-roti combo, and the Rajasthani thhali for lunch. The saag was spicy but tasty, and the rotis were thick and firm, the way most makkey ki rotis are. I enjoyed the Rajasthani dishes  especially the hot gattey and the equally spicy mangori-papad ki sabzi. There was a gulab jamun, too, which we shared.On a cold winters day, saag and roti warm up the heart. And a hot and squishy gulab jamun is like the icing  or rather the warm syrup  on top.The writer is a seasoned food critic",MUSTARD OIL

To illustrate the Dhokla mix, flour consisted of Udad dal, Chana dal, Sugar, Salt, Sodium Bicarbonate, Citric acid and Asafoedtida. The ingredients of the Rava-Idli mix were Gram dal, Udad dal, Rava, Citric acid, Salt, Green Chilli, Curry leaves, and Mustard seeds.The advance ruling bench has to delve deeply into the classification and sub-headings. While products such as the Dhokla mix, Dahi wada mix, Bhajiya mix and Idli mix fell under one sub-heading; Rava-Idli mix, Upma mix and Muthiya mix fell under another subheading. This despite the fact that all products were essentially flour and spices.The saving grace, there was no difference in the GST rate, which was the same at 5%. As regards Chutney powder, which was supplied free with a few flour mix categories, the AAR held it to be a mixed supply of goods  this too had a GST rate of 5%.",MUSTARD OIL

The changing weather necessitates a modification in nutrition as well. Especially this year, our dietary habits can be a decisive differentiator for our health and immunity. Working from home has become the new norm, resulting in far lesser physical activity and a lot more opportunities for eating. It can lead to weight gain, joint problems, vitamin D deficiency, constipation, and so on, says Pradeep Singh, wellness and nutrition expert, and certified dietitian.To add to that, winter brings with it dry skin and hair fall, which are also causes of concern. Therefore, enriching our diet with superfoods may help deal with all these problems and provide you with immunity, good skin, great digestion, and overall holistic health, he tells indianexpress.com.But what are these superfoods, and how do they benefit us? In a nutshell, superfoods are those edibles that contain a high nutritional value and provide us with a variety of health benefits.Below, he shares eight such superfoods that you should be eating this winter.Garlic: If youre a fan of garlic, winter is the time for you to have it. Garlic is a great source of selenium, germanium, and sulfhydryl amino acids, which help in boosting immunity. It is also a natural antibiotic and is effective in preventing urinary tract infections, lowering blood pressure, preventing bronchitis and pneumonia. This makes garlic one of the best winter diet additions.Cinnamon: Everybodys kitchen has this ingredient for sure. Usually shelved with cloves, nutmeg, and other spices, cinnamon is a great source of iron and calcium. It is essential for the production of healthy red blood cells and can also help in reducing spikes in blood sugar levels. A simple way to incorporate it into your diet would be, adding it to your morning cup of coffee or tea.Traditional Indian spices and herbs which are known to boost immunity find more takers in the COVID-19 times. (Source: Getty Images/Thinkstock) Traditional Indian spices and herbs which are known to boost immunity find more takers in the COVID-19 times. (Source: Getty Images/Thinkstock)Almond and walnuts: Just like blankets warm you up in winters, these nuts can warm you up on the inside. Both almonds and walnuts lower bad cholesterol, control blood sugar levels, and reduce inflammation. Walnuts are a great source of Omega-3, while almonds are rich in Vitamin E, antioxidants, and magnesium. So if youre craving a light snack, dont hesitate to pick up a few almonds and walnuts to munch on in between meals.Sweet potatoes: Sweet potatoes are great comfort food. They are also a rich source of fibre, Vitamin A, and potassium. If you want to go easy on the calories and high on the nutrients, sweet potatoes are the answer in winter. It can help with relieving constipation, building immunity, and reducing inflammation.Mustard greens: Mustard greens, just like other green leafy vegetables, are among the most nutritious foods you can eat. These greens are rich in fibre, and vitamin C, which is much needed during winter to help fight infections. Plus, it helps lower cholesterol and improves liver health.ALSO READ | 5 superfoods to boost your immunityCitrus fruits: By now, weve all heard that citrus fruits are synonymous with vitamin C. So, not mentioning them as a winter food would leave the list incomplete, and for a good reason. Fruits such as oranges, grapes, and lemons are jam-packed with minerals and phytochemicals. Therefore, including them in your winter diet is a must if you want to develop a super-strong immune system.Carrots: Carrots are rich in beta-carotene that gives them their bright orange colour and makes them rich in vitamin A. The high level of fibre they contain also means you can include carrots in your weight loss diet. They are also beneficial for regulating cholesterol levels. As an added benefit, they have high amounts of antioxidants, vitamin K, and improve overall eye health.Pea protein: Arguably the most complete plant protein, pea protein, is made from yellow split peas. Unlike beans or rice, it contains all the amino acids that your body requires. Its also a great alternative to whey or soy, especially if youre allergic or sensitive to either of the two. Plus, its a go-to protein source that will warm you up this winter if youre a vegan.Apart from winters, these foods should become a part of your daily nutrition regime as they will help you become fit and maximise your healthspan. A combination of these foods will yield clear skin, healthier hair, improved digestion, increased metabolism, and overall higher energy levels, he says.For more lifestyle news, follow us: Twitter: lifestyle_ie | Facebook: IE Lifestyle | Instagram: ie_lifestyle",MUSTARD OIL

I mentioned AKUS: The Brrgrr Co. to them one evening, and they assured me that the burgers were Yum. I had first heard about this place when some friends marked an anniversary picnic with AKUS. The praise that followed prompted me to take a look at this burger heaven. I found that it had an outlet in Gurugram and Delhis Defence Colony (call 8826669279).I looked at the menu and saw that they had an interesting mix of burgers: freshly minced lamb patties, chicken breasts, or a prawn patty. We asked for three kinds: a Bold Bingo, Meister and Chalapeno.I had the Bold Bingo, tasted the other two, and loved them all! Mine had a lamb patty, blue cheese, caramelised onions, blended cheese and lettuce. The buns were soft, lamb was juicy, the blue cheese gave it a just-right piquancy, and the lettuce lent crunch.The patty wasnt smothered with sauce (as some MNC burgers are), so it didnt drip messily, but gave the burger a kick. A young nephew who had a Bold Bingo the next day said that the meat, cheese and onions complemented one another well, and what really worked for him was the fact that the burger didnt become a gooey mess in his hands, and the size was just right.The Chalapeno had a stuffing of a grilled chicken breast, cheese blend, lettuce, jalapeo, peppers and jalapeo spread. This was ordered keeping in mind that one member of the household loves hot food  and she felt it was the best shed ever had.The master was the Meister  a lamb patty, with a fried egg, bacon, cheese, caramelised onions and sauce. The egg and the bacon (imported, says the menu) gave the burger a delicious twist. And the egg, of course, added another level of texture and taste.In the vegetarian section, there is a burger called Master Wu with wild mushroom and jalapeos, and a Master Blu with wild mushroom and blue cheese. The grilled Beetburger has a beetroot patty, and the Giza consists of a crisp potato and cheese patty. There is a gluten-free bun on offer, and a DIY kit.If youre hearty eater, this burger wont be enough for a meal. You may need side dishes, or if you are a growing boy (like the aforementioned nephew), you may want to have a full meal after the burger.There are quite a few sides, too. House made chicken nuggets with honey mustard mayo, skin-on French fries, onion rings and more. The fries are of three types: with salt and parsley, paprika, or truffle Parmesan and parsley.Prices range from 250 to 285 for vegetarian, and between 250 and 450 for the non-vegetarian burgers.Now I know why the young neighbours thought the burgers were yum. They indeed are. Yummilicious, Id say.The writer is a seasoned food critic",MUSTARD OIL

To know more, MetroPlus makes a visitI grab a leaf of peppermint from a bed of mint leaves and taste the intense freshness. Next, I look at thyme and smell the powerful aroma. A little away, purple basil with a beautiful, coppery glow beckon. I crush a lemon balm leaf, and take in the uplifting, mild scent.I am at Parna Farms, Coimbatores first urban hydroponic farm, located right in the heart of the city at an industrial building campus. Spread across 3,000 square feet, it grows 2,520 plants.Akhila Vijayaraghavan | Photo Credit: S Siva SaravananOur fresh lemon balm leaves impart a subtle flavour and fragrance, making it especially nice for custards, jam and jellies, cakes and tea, says Akhila Vijayaraghavan, owner of the farm. The purple basil is used for colour in salads. Except maybe amaranthus and palak (spinach), you can eat all the greens we grow here raw, says Akhila pointing to varieties of lettuce, basil, bok choy, and kale.Asian water spinach (kang kong), red gongura, mustard leaves and methi (fenugreek) are some of the new additions. We also grow dill leaves, which are used as garnish for fish and meat dishes and pastas. Fresh peppermint extracts are used in baking. We constantly try new crops based on demand, after rounds of trial-and-error.Peppermint grown at the hydrophonic Farm | Photo Credit: S Siva SaravananA graduate of Molecular Biology from the University of Glasgow, Akhila ran her own environmental consultancy for over 10 years before turning an urban farmer. I worked with a lot of companies, from pharmaceuticals to FMCG, and learnt that supply of quality end-product is a difficult task. Agriculture has always been one of my passions; I was interested in food crops. A herb can be used in cooking, to extract oil, extract nutrients in dry form, and maybe in alternative medicine, perfumery the possibilities are exciting, adds Akhila.She researched hydroponic methodology and educated herself on farming before diving into it. Anyone can do it, it is not rocket science, she says.Hydroponics combines both sustainability and technology. In indoor hydroponic cultivation, the control on nutrient supply ensures more quality produce, for example improved oil content in herbs, as well as better crop yield. A hydroponic mint has more methanol content than a soil-grown one. The system also uses 80% less water than conventional agriculture. The water is upcycled for reuse.At Parna Farms, greens are grown using the nutrient film technique (NFT), where a thin film of nutrient-rich water with macronutrients like nitrogen, potassium, phosphorous and calcium nitrate, and micronutrients like manganese and zinc nourish the roots of the plants.Seedlings at the nursery at the hydroponic farm | Photo Credit: S Siva SaravananThe farm has germination area that uses coco peat to sprout plants, and a nursery where net cups (small planters) are filled with clay pebbles. There is also the grow system, which involves metal stands and PVC pipes attached to a covered nutrient tank that pumps water to the plants. We incubate the net cups in a plastic tray for a couple of weeks. Once the plant grows roots, it is transferred to the main system with higher nutrients in the water. This is where it is fully grown and harvested, explains Akhila.Hydroponic agriculture, she says, has existed for over 3,000 years, with the Hanging Gardens of Babylon being one of the often quoted examples of this technique. It is one of the more accessible forms of modern agriculture, tackling the dual problems of water scarcity and shortage of farmland. It reduces soil-borne pests and diseases.Akhila says the objective is to ensure that customers get fresh, pesticide-free produce within three hours of harvest. Though a palak bunch from here costs 130, they are willing to pay the premium to enjoy good health, says Akhila, adding, You are what you eat.

Prepared with these antioxidant-rich carrots and spices, the velvety, reddish drink helps us battle the cold in North India. Chilled to the bone in a long cold spell, I had been thinking of kanji when a book arrived at my doorstep with an ode to the drink.(Stay up to date on new book releases, reviews, and more with The Hindu On Books newsletter. Subscribe here.)There was no kanji at home, so I had to make do with an appetising description of it in a story called A Brief History of the Carrot by Rosie Dastgir, included in the Claire Chambers-edited anthology, Desi Delicacies: Food Writing from Muslim South Asia. He poured out two glasses that glowed in the afternoon light. Room temperature, as the aunts recipe specified. The taste of it was sour and pungent and strangely restorative, though not exactly as he remembered, it goes. Was some vital ingredient missing?Wheres the story?Chambers writes that South Asian kitchens are the engines of an entire culture. The volume seeks to capture this essence through essays and short stories. The picture that we get of Muslim South Asian food is extremely eclectic, taking in everything from taco parties to lotus root slow-cooked in yoghurt, and from khichri to barfi, the York University professor says in a recent interview.The collection is quite mouth-watering, especially since each chapter ends with a recipe. The works of fiction, however, left me a bit puzzled. These are nice food pieces, no doubt, but are they stories?Take, for instance, Jackfruit with Tamarind by Mahruba T. Mowtushi and Mafruha Mohua. The short story is peppered with aunty this and uncle that  interesting characters, all, but each of them making only brief appearances. I would have liked to know more about them, especially about Manwara aunty, for I enjoyed the comparison between her fish curry and Ammas.Amma is fussy when it comes to preparing a fish. It has to be cleaned numerous times... She then smears the pieces with turmeric and salt and lightly fries them  for a minute or two  in mustard oil. Amma has a fervid dislike of people who skip this process. Macher jhol should have a light, refreshing taste and so spices are added sparingly, the authors write, adding, Amma always complained of Manwara auntys macher jhol, which contained such inordinate quantities of vegetables and an odd assortment of greens that eating it was like walking through a virgin jungle with a machete in hand!It is always fun to read about food, but the problem is that this isnt really a story. It works well as an essay, and is eminently readable, with little descriptions of dishes after every paragraph or two. But a story needs a beginning, middle and end, and this had none.Stomach rumblingThe Hairy Curry by Asiya Zahoor does have a twist in the end. The story is about young Gulla, a Kashmiri boy who has moved to Srinagar and is working in Bibijis kitchen. The description of a lotus-stem dish is invigorating. The velvety white curry was first to touch his palate. The softness and tangy taste was a delight. Each of the spices had given their essence fully to the curry. Its starchy texture, carrying the spices that complemented each other, was delectable. The lotus stems were cooked properly yet retained a certain crunchiness.But Gulla is troubled: theres hair in the curry  a lot of it!I was drawn more to the non-fiction part, and particularly enjoyed Rana Safvis piece (Qissa Qorma aur Qalia), in which she recounts food memories and practices of Lucknow.I relished the conversation between two uncles-in-law where they complain (in chaste Urdu) about digestive problems, which persist although they have been following their doctors advice and eating vegetarian khichri. It transpires that the cook has been adding large amounts of dried fruit and meat to the dish.The problem with a book like this is that it sends you straight to the kitchen. I certainly felt like cooking khichri after reading Farah Yameens well-written story about a child and her troubled phua.One does not serve khichri without mash and chutney to someone who is loved, Yameen writes. Or without papad or pickle, in my neck of the woods. Shows that food, really, has no religion.Desi Delicacies: Food Writing from Muslim South Asia; Edited by Claire Chambers, Pan Macmillan, 450The reviewer is a food columnist.",MUSTARD OIL

As anyone!Even if your menstrual cycle comes up like clockwork and you one of the lucky ones, chances are, it doesn't always work according to your plans. From cramps, mood swings to the irritability and rashes, having periods can be pretty uncomfortable, especially when you already have something important on your mind. Hence, the wish to 'postpone' your periods.The big question remains- are there ways to actually postpone your periods?Medically, yes there are pills which can help delay the flow of hormones and work to postpone your periods. With the advancement of science, there are some ways for women to put their periods on hold for a while, temporary, or the long run. But opting for synthetic hormonal pills or medicines may not be everyone's cup of tea. You will be surprised to know that there are some all-natural, non-medical ways to delay your periods for a while. Remember, you may not be able to outsmart or fool mother nature, but some of these remedies listed below can definitely be worth a try during times of crisis!Here are some natural herbs and medicines which can delay your periodsKnown to detoxify the body and promote weight loss, there are some old beliefs which suggest that there is yet another use of this humble drink- delaying menstruation.In fact, a lot of researchers have found out that the highly acidic content present in the ACV solution can help delay periods-upto an extent, but there's no credible proof to support it yet.Considering it as a good beneficial drink for your body, consider having a tablespoon of apple cider vinegar (in warm water) regularly for 10-12 days before your expected date.If not delay periods, drinking ACV can definitely help with the bloating and the harsh cramps which make your period woes so uncomfortable.Gram lentils, which can be found in every kitchen can also come of use when it comes to delaying your menstruation.According to some hacks, there is evidence to suggest that using fried, powdered lentils can delay period cycle.But there are some side-effects to the same. Excess consumption of lentils can lead to digestive troubles and flatulence.Using gelatin might come to be of use as a cure in emergency cases.An ancient Chinese remedy, some believe that gelatine, dissolved in warm water can push back periods by some hours, at the very least. It may not be a science-backed measure, but there are women who swear by this hack.For the ones who want relief for a long while, the gelatin treatment can be repeated again a couple of times.To use this, all you need is a couple of spoonfuls of gelatin powder or crystals mixed in a cup of warm water.Lime juice, much like apple cider vinegar is also considered to be a period postponement hack.While lime juice is hailed for its vitamin-c rich properties, the same citrus extract may also come of use in delaying your periods! Plus, it can also relieve any period complications or ease PMS pain which women experience. Some also believe that having citrusy fruits and juices also lightens up the blood flow. Make sure you have fruits, veggies and juices rich in vitamin C days leading up to your cycle.Again, do remember that having too much citrusy or acidic content can lead to gum and teeth deterioration or irritate your stomach.According to Ayurveda, using fuller's earth is not just good for better skin health, but may delay your periods too.Some ancient hacks suggest women wanting to delay periods to add about 25-30 grams of fuller's earth with a cup of warm water and have it regularly for a week before the expected date of menstruation. Some even suggest drinking the concoction for 3-4 times a day to see benefits.Do remember this is not a science-backed cure so proceed with precaution.Mustard seeds, popularly used in Indian cooking is also something a lot of women swear by in times of emergency. Soaking a spoonful of mustard seeds in water/ milk overnight and having them a week before the expected date can prove to be helpful. Antioxidant-rich chia seeds may be helpful in a similar manner.Apart from foods, there are also some other natural methods to postpone, or temporarily delay periods. Exercise and massage are some options.Since a lot of athletes often go by missing their periods due to extreme workouts they follow, it is said that rigorous exercise may postpone periods in cases. But, there is also scientific proof that suggests that exercise can regularize, instead of delaying periods.Getting a uterine massage may also be an option to consider. Not only is it very soothing and relaxing but as experts believe, it can also be a hack to delay periods or postpone cycle. This technique works best when you seek professional help.There are foods and natural techniques, apart from medicinal help you can try to postpone periods.While these methods are safe to try, they may not be the most effective or work for everyone.Again, there can be downsides of postponing your periods in the long run or consuming the foods in excess.Since they are not foolproof remedies, there can also be chances of irregular bleeding or spotting which you can expect.If you are considering halting your periods or searching for a way to deal with regular period woes, getting a gynaecologists opinion before trying out something on your own is advised. They can also devise ways and offer solutions which will help you in the longer run.",MUSTARD OIL

Hyperthyroidism is nothing but the over activity of the thyroid gland, that produces extra thyroid hormone and leads to increased metabolism. The most common type of hyperthyroidism is the autoimmune disorder Graves disease.Here, the body makes an antibody called thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin (TSI) that causes the thyroid gland to produce too much of the thyroid hormone. Excessive consumption of iodine or iodine supplements is also a common cause of hyperthyroidism.FOODS TO REDUCE THYROID ACTIVITYGluten and casein are difficult to digest and can cause irritation and inflammation in the gut lining. Avoid gluten (wheat and wheat products) and casein (milk and milk products) becomes very important to heal the gut lining and manage the condition.Consume food belonging to the Brassica family, like cauliflower, brussels sprouts, peanuts, cabbage, broccoli, kale, mustard greens, turnips, rutabagas and spinach which contain goitrogens that help the body block the ability of thyroid to use iodine and hence slows down the activity of the thyroid.Omega -3- Fatty Acids are the building blocks for hormones that control immune function and cell growth, and also help improve the ability to respond to thyroid hormones. Include fatty fish, flaxseed powder, flax seed oil, cod liver oil capsules, walnuts, chia seeds and other seeds to get a dose of omega-3- fatty acid.Protein sources also contain Lglutamine which helps in rebuilding the gut and de-inflaming the body. Opt for fish, lean chicken and free range eggs. Sattu and sprouts/whole beans combined with a cereal, also make a great protein source as the amino acid profile gets completed.The hyperactive thyroid gland can deplete the zinc in our body. Include zinc rich foods like almonds, pumpkin seeds, peanuts to replenish the zinc losses from our body.Deepika RathodThe writer is a clinical nutritionist with a focus on healthy lifestyle choices.",MUSTARD OIL

The police and paramilitary forces have deployed up to 50,000 personnel, as well as barricades, barbed wire and riot-control vehicles. The United Nations is urging restraint. And each day, more farmers and tractors arrive to join the disgruntled ranks.Prime Minister Narendra Modi is no stranger to sparking public anger with his determination to push through reforms, but this may be his most vital stand-off yet. The farmers are demanding he repeal laws passed in September that they say will ruin their livelihoods. The government insists the new policy will benefit the growers and refuses to withdraw the legislation. After months of protests, more than 10 rounds of talks and a Supreme Court order to temporarily suspend the laws, the government says it would consider some amendments and could delay implementation by as much as 18 months. But the agitators are in no mood for compromise.Were not going anywhere. We are ready to sit here for years if needed. The government has to listen, said Balwinder Singh, 50, who normally grows rice and wheat on 3 acres of land in Punjab. He has been protesting since Nov. 26 on the Singhu border, the epicentre of the demonstrations outside Delhi. We can survive the coronavirus but not these laws.Behind the protesters fears and the government rhetoric is a reality that the country somehow needs to reshape its agricultural system or face the environmental consequences of overproduction and a fiscal calamity from ballooning farm subsidies. Get the reform right and it could raise millions of agriculture-dependent families out of poverty and propel India to the forefront of global food exports. Get it wrong and it could force tens of millions of people off their land and degrade up to 90% of the nations water supply.Its a problem so titanic that consecutive governments have shied away from making meaningful changes. Not Modi. Emboldened by seemingly unsinkable popular support, even during a devastating pandemic, his administration has weighed in. Its a classic playbook for the prime minister, whose six years in power have been marked by policy reforms that often set off national protests and occasionally thrown the country into turmoil, such as canceling 86% of circulating currency and introducing a religion-based citizenship law. But the governments willingness to compromise on the farm issue shows that this is potentially an even more delicate path one that risks alienating more than half of the nations 1.3 billion people, who rely on agriculture for a living.The two sides are poles apart. The government says the laws will overhaul the way farm goods are produced and sold in the country, opening up a decades-old system of state-run wholesale markets to more private purchases and helping producers earn more. The farmers fear the laws would give companies and large wholesalers the power to dictate prices to small land-holders, who make up the majority of producers.Its about unlocking productivity in areas like farming of cereals by applying high-quality farm inputs such as seeds, and using less water to grow the same amount of grain, said Rahul Bajoria, Mumbai-based chief India economist at Barclays Plc. The best way for the farm sector to grow is to focus more on exports, for which the country needs to improve productivity and quality control.But the nations millions of small farmers live a precarious existence and have come to trust a government support system that allows them to survive year to year with enough to get to the next harvest.Private companies won't pay us on time, said Singh, the protester. If we don't get paid on time, how will we prepare for our next crop? We will die of hunger.""The root of the conflict lies in a system that evolved over more than half a century after the Green Revolution of the 1960s slowly transformed the nation from a land of frequent famines to an agricultural powerhouse. India is now the worlds biggest exporter of rice and the second-largest producer of wheat and sugar. At the same time, a complex and inefficient system of state support, controlled markets and government welfare grew up that Modi is trying to unpick.Under the present system, the government sets minimum prices for about two dozen crops and buys large volumes of rice and wheat for its welfare programs. While traders arent legally obliged to pay the government-set rates, the sheer volume of state purchases creates de facto price support for key grains from small farmers, who sell their produce through licensed traders in designated markets. These markets were set up to open up the industry and prevent exploitation of smallholders, but over time many became effective monopolies, with traders pulling together to stifle competition. As a result, prices of rice and wheat have remained stable over years, while other crops such as soybeans, corn and rapeseed have seen sharp price swings.Farmers like the arrangement because the government provides them with a guaranteed buyer, allowing them to easily secure informal short-term loans to buy farm inputs like seeds in a country where rural banking services are often inadequate.The new rules intend to liberalize trading by allowing farmers to sell crops outside the designated markets. Modis administration has promised that the welfare support mechanism will remain, but protesters arent convinced.Many believe the reforms are designed ultimately to cut the governments food subsidy bill expected to be $33.4 billion in 2021-22 by allowing market forces to drive down prices. The current support rates reflect the cost of production plus a 50% profit, which, along with assured purchases, has encouraged farmers to overproduce some crops. With India growing more wheat, rice, sugar cane and cotton than it needs, a free-for-all could cause prices to slump.Worse still, 86% of Indias farmers cultivate plots of about 2 hectares (5 acres) or less, while the other 14% own more than half the cultivated land. In an unfettered market, large landowners with lower costs per acre and better access to funds could end up dominating markets, forcing smallholders to sell their land. Thats a shift that took decades in many developed nations as rural residents migrated to cities to work in factories. But an accelerated transition on the scale of Indias population risks a major humanitarian crisis.Jokhu Ray, who grew corn and rice in the eastern state of Bihar, has had a taste of what a free market could mean. Bihar abolished its government-managed market in 2006 and Ray says the result was disastrous for him. In the 2019-20 crop year, he could only get 10 rupees (14 cents) a kilogram for his corn, less than the support price of 17.6 rupees or the 15 rupees he got the year before. Like many others, Ray left his village to seek work elsewhere and now works on a construction site in Rajasthan.Stories like Rays have fueled farmers fears. Protesters around the country held 3-hour chakka jams at the weekend, holding up traffic. The government blocked the internet at major protest sites and deployed some 50,000 police and paramilitary, along with riot control vehicles in and around Delhi, according to local media. After violence broke out at a Republic Day rally in the capital in January, the United Nations urged farmers to keep protests peaceful.The government has shut down the Internet here out of fear, said Singh, by phone. We are not scared. We are informing people through phone calls.We are urging those involved in agitation to end protests, Modi told lawmakers in parliament on Feb. 8. We should give these agriculture reforms a chance.Farmers instead are demanding new legislation that makes it illegal to pay less than the minimum support rate, a policy analysts say would distort the market even more. Private buyers could be scared off, forcing the government to have to step in and buy even more. That would worsen a fiscal deficit that is already expected to widen to 9.5% of GDP due to the coronavirus.State-run Food Corp. of India, the nations biggest food-grain buyer, is already stretched after buying 39 million tons of wheat and 52 million tons of rice from last years crop of about 108 million tons and 118 million tons respectively. Recent bumper harvests have filled many state granaries to bursting.Raising minimum prices each year could also hit exports, said B.V. Krishna Rao, president of the nations Rice Exporters Association. The moment we make minimum prices a legal obligation, we are bound to lose our share in the global market. He suggested that support prices should be set close to global levels and farmers compensated if needed for any losses.And there are other, even more serious long-term consequences if India doesnt find an equitable way to reform its agriculture, especially in states like Punjab and Haryana, where the protests began.Indias Green Revolution in the 1960s brought a surge in grain output in Punjab thanks to high-yielding seeds, mechanization and increased application of pesticides and fertilizers. Known as Indias bread-basket, the state supplied about one third of the 62 million tons of water-intensive paddy that the government purchased from monsoon-sown crops so far this year, according to the food ministry.States like Punjab grow more rice than they consume despite unfavorable terrain, which has resulted in a drastic depletion of their water tables, Rini Sen, an economist with ANZ Banking Group, said in a report.India has only about 4% of the worlds fresh water and farmers tap almost 90% of the groundwater available. Growers say they cant afford to switch from water-intensive crops such as rice and sugar cane unless the government ensures the same kind of price support for more sustainable crops like soybeans, mustard or pigeon peas (used to make dal).Finding a compromise that would reassure farmers they can still make a decent living while dismantling an archaic and inefficient agriculture market may be Modis hardest task to date. But as the two sides dig in for what could be a long and bitter stand-off, its one that India must solve.",MUSTARD OIL

The Prime Minister said this money spent on imports could be transferred to the bank accounts of farmers in the country.We are talking about the 'National Mission on Oilseeds', on which there is a plan to spend nearly Rs 19,000 crore in the next five years. A senior official of the Union Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare said the preparations for the mission are foolproof and would be implemented from April 1 in the upcoming financial year.India imports nearly 150 lakh tonnes of edible oil every year while domestic production is nearly 70 to 80 lakh tonnes. With the growing population of the country, consumption of edible oil would also increase moving ahead. In such a situation, bridging the huge gap between the edible oil imports and the domestic production by achieving 'self-reliance' in edible oil is a major goal. But Trilochan Mohapatra , Director General of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), says that when work is undertaken on mission mode, there is a greater chance of achieving success in it.He said to increase the production of oilseeds in the country, along with acreage, more emphasis would be given on increasing productivity.Mohapatra told that in the eastern region of the country, there are nearly 110 lakh hectares of land, which remains vacant after taking out the paddy crop, it can increase its area by growing mustard. In addition, farmers are encouraged to cultivate pulses and oilseeds instead of crops like paddy, wheat and sugarcane in Punjab, Haryana including northern India where there is scarcity of water.Mohapatra said like paddy and wheat, if farmers get the Minimum Support Price (MSP) for oilseeds and high yield seeds are available then their interest in cultivating these crops would increase.He told that according to the study conducted by ICAR, there are 20 agro ecological regions in the country.Mohapatra said that varieties of seeds are prepared for cultivation of suitable crops in climate of a particular region, which increases the yield. He said that India imports palm oil the most, but the emphasis is now on increasing palm cultivation in the country, which would help in bringing 'Aatmanirbharta'.A total of nine oilseed crops are cultivated in India every year. Their annual production has been exceeding 300 lakh tonnes for the last four years and is increasing year by year. These include such oilseeds and oils which are used only in industries, but most of them are used as edible oils.Director ICAR-Directorate of Rapeseed-Mustard Research, Bharatpur (Rajasthan), P.K. Rai, said there is great potential to increase the production of oilseeds in the country and mustard can be seen as an example of this. He said that the emphasis on mustard cultivation in mission mode has increased the acreage this year and production could be between 110 to 120 lakh tonnes.Agriculture Ministry official said that in the next five years, the production of oilseeds in the country could double.Apart from seasonal crops, oil is obtained from the seeds of some evergreen trees in the country. Then, there are also secondary sources of oil. A senior Agriculture Ministry official said the goal of development has been set at every level. Four sub-missions have been made under the 'National Oilseeds Mission' which are as follows:Firstly to increase the production of oil from primary source. Under this it is planned to increase production of soyabean, mustard-rapeseed, groundnut, sunflower, sesame, safflower and ramtil.Secondly to increase the production of oil from secondary source and under it crop which is not produced mainly for oil, but oil comes from it as a by-product. For example, cotton oil, linseed oil etc.Thirdly setting up of processing units in oilseed production areas wherein the areas where oilseeds are produced, provision has been made to set up processing units so that farmers can get a fair price of their crops.Fourthly to create awareness campaign to make people aware of the benefits of economical consumption of oil.Experts point out that oil consumption is steadily increasing with the country's growing population, but a research by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), advises a person to consume 30 grams of oil daily. Adhering to this ICMR study, the annual oil consumption per capita should be nearly 11 kg of oil. Whereas according to the 2017 report, the per capita oil consumption in the country is 19.3 kg.In Video: Centre to reduce dependence on edible oil imports",MUSTARD OIL

He had offered ration too.Its the call of my soul that I started NaMo canteen. It has no connection whatsoever with elections or votes. Elections come once in five years but I have been doing social work for the past more than 20 years, Ghose told this newspaper.He said as a school student, he grew up struggling but was inspired by Swami Vivekanandas famous quote: Those who serve mankind and any other living beings are serving God.Mariani (in Jorhat district of Upper Assam) is a backward constituency.

Today we are going to discuss a similar rare disease that wasnt common earlier known as Polycythemia. It is a rare blood disorder that causes your body to overproduce red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets.This disease mostly occurs in men after 40. Red blood cells carry oxygen throughout the body, white blood cells fight infection and platelets are involved in clotting the blood to stop or slow down the bleeding which indirectly helps in the healing of wounds. When too many RBC, WBC platelets circulate in our bodies, blood starts thickening and may not flow properly through the blood vessels.This increases the risk of blood clots in major arteries and veins of our body, which can lead to a stroke or heart attack. If clots occur in the entire body, then they can affect other vital organs. Smaller blood vessels can be blocked by clots which may lead to headaches, vision changes, light-headedness, numbness, burning, redness and swelling.While no special diet exists to aid the treatment of polycythemia, it is recommended that you eat a well-balanced meal and limit your intake of sodium. Increased blood volume increases your risk of high blood pressure. Limiting your sodium intake can help you better manage your blood pressure and you can avoid processed foods such as bacon, meat, sausage, frozen meals, salty chips and soup to control the same. Instead, include more fresh, home food with pink salt. Here are few tips to be healthy:Eat antioxidant-rich foods, including fresh fruits and vegetables to add fibre to your body which ultimately will help in controlling blood pressure.Avoid refined foods, such as white processed sugar, bread and junk food to control inflammation as they may contain high-fat content and increase chances of blood thickening.Avoid red meat and choose lean meats like chicken, cold-water fish, pulses and beans, nuts and seeds for protein. Protein repairs the cells in our bodies.Use healthy cold-pressed coconut oil, sesame, mustard or groundnut oil or A2 ghee for cooking, which helps in controlling inflammation.Try to eliminate trans-fatty acids from your routine, found in commercially baked goods such as cookies, crackers, cakes, French fries, onion rings, doughnuts, processed foods and margarine. They can make your blood flow sluggish and can increase the chances of blood clots.Avoid caffeine, alcohol, and tobacco as they can keep the inflammation levels high and will not help the body to heal.Drink eight to 10 glasses of water a day to make sure the body gets detoxified and it doesnt allow the thickening of blood.These practices can be followed daily to keep a check on your blood.DEEPIKA RATHODChief Nutrition Officer, Luke Coutinho Holistic Healing Systems.

""To improve the quality of prices data for reporting daily prices by the price reporting centres, the Department of Consumer Affairs launched a Mobile App on 1st January, 2021,"" the department said in a statement.It said that the monitoring and predictive analysis of prices of essential commodities has taken a giant step forward.The mobile app for price monitoring for 22 essential commodities has started providing effective real time information about retail and wholesale prices from 127 locations across the country, the statement said.The daily report of retail and wholesale prices are obtained from 127 centres located across the country. The daily report of prices and indicative price trends are analysed for taking appropriate decisions such as release of stocks from the buffer and export-import policy etc. ""Price reporting through Mobile App ensures reporting from the market location as data are geo-tagged thereby displaying the location from where price data are reported,"" the statement said.The reporting of static data from office desktop is ruled out through the application of Mobile App. ""Therefore, the condition to operationalise Mobile App is that each Price Reporting Centre has to furnish market details such as names and addresses of the shops and markets from where prices are being collected daily,"" it said.As per the guidelines for retail price reporting, the prices of the same variety of a commodity are to be collected from three markets -- high income market, middle income market and low income market, and the average of the three prices is to be reported.The department said that the mobile App has inbuilt feature to calculate and report the average price. This helps in avoiding human errors in calculation. Market information from Agmarknet, Agriwatch, NAFED and trade associations also constitute inputs for price analysis.The department is also utilising the services of Agriwatch for providing market intelligence, predictive analysis of prices and to develop price forecasting model.The department said it had proposed to DEA (department of economic affairs) for technical assistance fund under CARES Progamme of Asian Development Bank (ADB) for improving price monitoring and analysis.The activity components under the technical assistance are upgradation of price monitoring portal, capacity building for price reporting centres and price monitoring cell, identification of long-term improvements for food commodity supply chain & market efficiency.It said that the DEA has approved the proposal.",MUSTARD OIL

As there are no markers for the beginning and the end of the old marketplace, you are most likely to miss the entire Teliapara Road if you are walking down without looking up at street signs.Sign up to get quick access to Indian Express exclusive and premium stories.In his book A History of Calcuttas Streets, historian P Thankappan Nair writes that this short lane was where the telis (the oil-pressers) and the kaluas (the oil-mongers) of old Calcutta had set up their homes and shops until modern methods of mass-produced, mill-made oils became the preference for the citys residents. These oil-pressers would sell everything, from freshly pressed coconut oil to mustard oil, an essential ingredient in Bengali cooking, to other less common oils in between.It is not clear when the road and the neighbourhood came to be associated with the telis of Calcutta. An entry in the September edition of the Calcutta Gazette of 1937 indicates that the Calcutta Municipal Corporation had proposed a change in the spelling of the road from Teliapara to Tilipara but that never came to fruition. Even today, addresses on that road carry two variations of the roads spelling: Telipara or Teliapara.The teli community, writes K S Singh, in his book Indias Communities for the Anthropological Survey of India, derives its name from the Sanskrit word talika or taila, used for the oil extracted from sesame and mustard, thus alluding to their traditional occupation.The teli community found their jobs diminishing after the pressing and extracting of oil largely switched to mechanical production methods, forcing members of the community to turn to other avenues of income, like farming and animal husbandry.An oil shop on Teliapara road. (Express Photo by Shashi Ghosh) An oil shop on Teliapara road. (Express Photo by Shashi Ghosh)The 1837 edition of the Calcutta Review carries an interesting entry about the community. A chapter dedicated to the Territorial Aristocracy of Bengal indicates that the Brahmins had relegated the community as one belonging to lower castes.The Pandits thus referred to unanimously gave the verdict in his favour, a verdict founded on the dictum tula danda dhari taulik; ie, Telis are not common oil-men, but derive their appellation from the fact of their holding the scales for the weighment of goods, and that the word Teli is the corruption of the word Taulik, says the entry.An old building in Bhawanipore. (Express Photo by Shashi Ghosh) An old building in Bhawanipore. (Express Photo by Shashi Ghosh)It further mentions: As holding the scales and weighing the goods is a vocation common to all merchants and mahajans, the Telis came in the same category with other Navasaks or second class Sudras, and like them, were entitled to the privilege of making gifts. According to Singhs writings, because a small number in the community, spread across the country, are landless, many have applied to be recognised as Other Backward Castes.Today, not many oil-pressers remain in Teliapara. The road now houses a mix of residential properties and commercial establishments and it is impossible to discern where the next-door Jadubabu Bazaar ends and where Teliapara begins given that hawkers and pedestrians have taken over the pavements.Bound by the bazaar on one end and Turf Road on the other, the manic pulling down of the citys crumbling architectural heritage appears to have largely evaded the old buildings in and around this road. Some exceptions, however, remain.One would be hard-pressed to find hand-pressed oil in the city today. But Calcutta is a city where one comes in search of history and usually does end up finding what theyre looking for, only perhaps not in the expected form. In this case, remnants of the teli community can still be found in this lane, in the odd shops with yellow hand-painted signboards saying oil-dealer. Of course, these shop owners do not know that the road acknowledges Calcuttas teli communitys work.",MUSTARD OIL

There is no doubt the BJP government has brought development but what about the price rise? If they have given us Rs 2 in our bank accounts, they have taken away Rs 98, he said.Price rise weapon in the hands of Assam CongressThe price rise has come in handy for the Congress to beat the BJP with. What has the BJP done on jobs and price rise? Their promises are embarrassingly unfulfilled, said party leader and parliamentarian Gaurav Gogoi. Gogoi isnt wrong when it comes to jobs. In some other parameters also Assam lags behind many other states, although many of them could be a legacy the BJP government inherited.According to Assam Agenda 2030, a task-at-hand document brought out by the Sonowal government in early 2018, the unemployment rate stood at 61 per 1,000 population (age 15 and above) against the national figure of 50 per 1,000 population. Poverty and hunger also plague the state. The poverty head count ratio for Assam was estimated at 27.34 percent in 2015-16. This is much higher than the all-India average of 20.74 percent, the Agenda 2030 said.Similarly, hunger remains a major problem in the state. Amongst children, the most vulnerable group in this respect, almost 30% below the age of 5 are undernourished, it said. But the BJP remains confident. We are on the way to getting more than 100 seats (out of the total 126) because of our development work, said Simanta Bora, a party leader in the district of Nagaon.",MUSTARD OIL

Also, this year only those farmers who have registered themselves on the Meri Fasal, Mera Byora portal are entitled to sell their crops to the government agencies, officials said.A senior official of the district administration said that every possible effort will be made to make the procurement process a smooth affair for farmers and they will be paid 100% either in their bank account or through arthiyas. Last year, the state government transferred more than 50% of the payments directly to the bank accounts of the farmers and the remaining was made through arhtiyas.To avoid problems in getting the gate passes, there will be a facility of two computer operators each at every gate, along with Saksham Yuva for assistance. Apart from four established mandis, few temporary mandis will be set up according to the needs of the farmers. The focus will be on cleaning the mandis before the season begins, along with proper facilities for drinking water, food, toilet and electricity, he said.The district is expected to have a yield of more than 5.5 lakh quintal of mustard and 7 lakh quintal of wheat. Around 22,000 farmers have already registered themselves on the portal to participate in the governments mustard and wheat procurement process.Monika Malik, the district food and supplies officer, said, We have made elaborate arrangements to ensure that the farmers and workers abide by the Covid protocol put in place. While farmers vehicles and equipment would be sanitised at the time of entry in mandis, we will also provide them with masks and remind them to adhere to social distancing norms at the procurement centres.Only those farmers who have registered themselves at the government's Meri Fasal Mera Byora portal will be allowed entry. Suitable transportation arrangements have been made to lift crops from the mandis on time. If any transporter fails to lift the crops within 48 hours, we would be ready with an alternative arrangement, she said.",MUSTARD OIL

Heavy police force was deployed outside the mini secretariat to control the protesting farmers, but they stood their ground and burnt an effigy of Dushyant. The deputy CM had cancelled his visit scheduled on March 26. Even though the administration refused to give reasons for cancellation, sources said it was following the intelligence reports that farmers would oppose his visit.While interacting with media personnel, the deputy CM said, We have taken up 15 registered grievances, seven of which were resolved on the spot. Regarding the farmers protest, he said, Everyone has the right to protest in a democracy. The government is ready for talks. The protesting farmers should come forward for talks, as it is the only way to resolve the issue.Claiming that the governments aim was to make the farming community prosperous, he said all arrangements have been made for procurement of wheat and mustard which started on April 1.

The state has recorded a deficit of 62 per cent in precipitation during March, preceded by a deficit of 80 per cent in February and 58 per cent in January. Water sources in Himachal have been drying up or running low, while shortage of rain has affected rabi crops in a state where around 80 per cent of the cultivated area is rainfed.The average yield of mustard crop in my land is one quintal, but it is not likely to exceed 8 to 10 kilogram this time. Similarly, the yield of barley will not be more than 10 to 15 per cent of the average. In case of wheat, the crop has not even developed sufficiently this time due to lack of rains, said Om Prakash Thakur, a resident of Dhami in Shimla district.According to IMDs meteorological centre at Shimla, Himachal received 41.7 millimetres of rain/snow in March against a long period average (LPA) of 110.9 mm. It was the second-largest rain deficit in the state during March in the last 10 years. The highest deficit of 67 per cent occurred in 2018, when state capital Shimla had suffered a severe water crisis in summer.This March, all 12 districts of Himachal witnessed deficiency or large deficiency in rain as per IMDs classification. Kangra, Hamirpur and Sirmaur were the most-affected, recording a deficit of 84, 79 and 77 per cent respectively, while Kullu (40 per cent), Mandi (40 per cent) and Shimla (41 per cent) recorded the least deficit.According to Pankaj Gupta, associate director of Regional Horticultural Research and Training Station at Mashobra, shortage of rain and snow this year has adversely affected temperate fruits such as apples, cherries and pears in their fruit set stage. The chilling requirements of these fruits could not be completed this winter due to lack of adequate snow and farmers have been demanding an official declaration of drought. Apples are now entering the flowering stage, but the flowering is neither expected to be profuse nor simultaneous. Plants are flowering in small patches which reduces pollination. What happens later during the fruit development stage remains to be seen, he said.",MUSTARD OIL

Retail inflation has soared to a three-month high of 5% in February, while WPI (wholesale) inflation surged to a 27-month high of 4.2% in the same month, largely led by strengthening fuel, food and manufactured product prices.This is really a big problem for all of us, as high prices are upsetting our monthly budget, said Paramita Biswas, a professional singer and YouTuber in Kolkata. She said due to the pandemic, sanitisers and masks have added to expenses on health.The retail inflation data for February showed the extent of the strengthening prices. Meat and fish prices rose an annual 11.3% in February, while egg prices shot up 11.1%. Oils and fats rose 20.8%, while pulses and products rose 12.5%. In fact, prices of mutton, which hovered at Rs 500 per kg pre-pandemic, nearly doubled during the lockdown and have remained Rs 750-800 per kg a year later.Price of tur dal, which was around Rs 95 per kg in Delhi in April last year, has now soared to Rs 108 per kg. It is a similar story for other pulses such as urad and moong in cities such as Mumbai and Kolkata. Edible oil prices have also hardened. Mustard oil, which was selling at Rs 114 per kg in Mumbai last year, is now available for Rs 155 per kg, while sunflower, which was at Rs 105 per kg in Kolkata, is now at Rs 179 per kg.Rising fuel costs have also added to the woes of households, although of late there has been some easing. The NDA government had been successful in managing inflationary pressures since assuming power in 2014 against the backdrop of stubbornly high prices, but the pandemic-triggered price increases have upset the cart.Chinmoy Barik, who works as an engineer in an IT company, has been staying in Bengaluru for the last seven years with his wife, daughter and mother. He says the spike in fuel prices has hit his monthly budget majorly this year compared to last year. Though most of the year he has worked from home. It has hit my monthly budget as savings have gone down. A lot of extra expense has been incurred due to ordering food online during the lockdown, he said.The surge in prices of commodities and other costs are prompting people to reduce expenses on activities such as eating out.Rajiv Bansal, a bank employee in Mumbai, has a family of three. He continues to work from home for three days a week. Eating out has dropped substantially. He says his grocery, fruits and vegetables purchase costs have shot up not because of high prices but due to the buying of more quantity and exotic stuff. In education, there is a saving on childrens school uniform, transport and a marginal reduction in fees as extracurricular activities and field trips are not happening due to the pandemic. He has managed to re-negotiate the rent of his one-bedroom flat as several tenants in the complex had vacated and landlords were offering lower rates.While prices of vegetables are expected to stabilise as supplies improve, overall inflationary pressure is expected to linger for now. The latest Reserve Bank of India (RBI) inflation expectation survey showed that more households expect general prices as well as inflation to increase in the next one year. This is prominent in the case of food and non-food commodities. Households also expect more pressure on price of services over the one-year horizon when compared to a one-quarter (three-month) period.Pandemic-induced lifestyle changes are also adding to costs for some households. Consumption of vegetables and fruits suddenly shot up since the outbreak of the pandemic as we were forced to stay indoors. Now, we have decided to cut short on those expenses. Post-lockdown, we are now taking short breaks to entertain us, said Sumathi Jaykumar, a self-employed Chennai resident.",MUSTARD OIL

The yield of honey per colony has gone down manifold around 2-3 times. The reason, according to them, is that flowers of hybrid seed crops like sarson (mustard), sunflower, and berseem (fodder) etc., do not carry much nectar, because of which they are facing heavy losses.Beekeepers have been writing to the Punjab government as well as Punjab Agriculture University (PAU), Ludhiana, to address this issue by developing varieties which carry good amounts of nectar too. They also blamed that decreasing area under flowering crops.Dharminder Singh (49), a beekeeper from Dharamgarh village in Mohali district, said: I have been into beekeeping for the past 25 years and own 600 colonies (boxes) of bees which I keep across the state  in the Shivalik ranges, and outside the Himachal, Rajasthan as per availability of the flowers with the changing seasons. But the yield of honey has come down 2-3 times in all these years.We met the scientists at PAU a number of times and apprised them about how hybrid seeds of flowering crops are hitting the yield of honey because the amount of nectar in the flowers of these hybrid crops is hardly sufficient, he further said, adding that earlier, they would collect 4-5 times the honey from a box in a single season than what they now collect from one time crop.Another beekeeper, Simarjeet Billa, said that because of low yield per colony, their income has gotten hit manifold.Hybrid seed varietiesNarpinder Singh, president of the PAU Progressive Beekeeper Association Punjab and having 600 colonies, said that in India, 80 per cent honey production takes place from the mustard flower. But in the past 15 years, the average production per colony (per box of bees) has come down from 50 kg to 15 kg during the mustard crop season, which starts from November and continues till March.He said that as per records of the National Bee Keeping Board, Indias honey production was 1.20 lakh tonnes in 2019-20, which is increasing with every passing year. Punjab produces around 15,000 to 20,000 tonnes of honey but in reality, bee keepers like us are getting low yield per colony. Due to hybrid seed varieties, the duration of mustard crop has also decreased from 60 to 65 days to 50 to 55 days only, added Narpinder.Transportation expensesHe said that beekeepers are required to take the colonies from one place to another during the different flowering season. Sometimes we are going to Rajasthan during mustard crop season and some time we are taking bees to Himachal during apple flowering season We are bearing so much in transportation charges, then also keeping caretakers at the place where our boxes are kept. Government must come forward to help us in transportation charges when the yield is also going down, he said, adding that more area must be brought under flowering oil seed crops like sarson in Punjab.Artificial honeyOn manufacturing of artificial honey in India by some groups, Narpinder said the government must make NMR (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) tests for honey compulsory so that only pure honey could be available in the market rather than having sugar-laced syrups by some big companies. Purity of honey will also provide huge opportunities to the bee keepers to expand their beekeeping, he added.Reasons for yield productionPAU scientist Dr Jaspal Singh, principal entomologist told The Indian Express, said there are several reasons for low yield and one of the major reasons is the high competition in this field. He said a honey bee can travel upto 3 km to collect nectar. Earlier, there used to be a very low number of colonies in a particular area when now the number of colonies has increased manifold. Secondly, changing weather conditions also played a big role because high temperatures during February-March led to decrease in yield. Also if a crop is not sown timely, the amount of nectar also gets decreased, he added.PAU records also revealed that oilseeds crops used to be sown on around 5 lakh hectares in Punjab in 1970s and the area has reduced to just 50,000 hectares now, while the number of colonies has increased by 3-4 times now in the state.Narpinder Singh, a national award winner in beekeeping, said a colony carries around 20,000 to 25,000 bees and a bee has a life cycle of around 40 days. In India, Italian bees are rare.",MUSTARD OIL

I follow my mothers recipe to make Ugadi Pacchadi which has nice flavours dominating the bitterness of neem. We will be missing the family get-together and students and friends visiting home this year.Any festival in my family has limited rituals. Being a family of musicians, our major ritual is music-related to that particular festival. This year, I have been invited to do a special recording of a thematic presentation  Musicality of Telugu in Carnatic Sangeetham by the International Music Premier League, an online event for Ugadi.I remember the Ugadi celebration abroad when we were on a concert tour and took a break to celebrate the festival with my brothers family at Maryland in the US.I wish the live concerts resume soon.Lets spread the artKoeli mukherjee ghose | Photo Credit: Special arrangementKoeli Mukherjee Ghose, artistSpring cleaning, decorating the home with flowers and alpana on the floor with watered-down rice paste is something that I look forward to every year. This year, we would miss visiting the Hyderabad Kali Bari to offer our nabo borsho puja and enjoy the bhog prasad. We offer fruits and food at a nearby ashram, which houses homeless people.During childhood, my brother and I would wear new clothes and visit my dad's office in Dalhousie Street in Kolkata. The Stephen House building used to overwhelm us  the smell of the lift, the colonial courtyard with a fountain; everything is a memory now. There would be a little prayer gathering and sweet boxes with yummy goodies would be gifted to all of us. Lunch was at home with a traditional menu and my mother, a wonderful cook, would transform any vegetable, dal, and other eatables into gourmet dishes.The evening would be spent in musical concerts held in Rabindra Sadan, Birla Sabhaghar or Kala Mandir auditoriums. The pandemic has left a lasting impression on our minds. The art scene has shifted online, and I hope and pray that we have more visitors to the sites and art lovers reach out to the artists and buy their works.Culture and creativityRam mohan Holagundi | Photo Credit: Special arrangementRam Mohan Holagundi, theatre directorThe house looks colourful on Ugadi day with rangoli, mango leaves thoranam and marigold flowers. The first thing we do after puja is to eat behu bella, the sweet and sour chutney symbolic of different flavours in life.Three big mango trees in our house are a special part of festivities. We wait till Ugadi to pluck mangoes and distribute them among our friends, relatives and neighbours.The festive meal will have Kannada specialities  kosambri, bisibele baat, mavinkayya chutney and chitranna, muddipalya, saaru, holige and mosaru buttey (curd rice with seasoning).We usually have a family get-together but this time it will be a virtual one. Since we cant meet the elders in the family to take their blessings, we will connect with them over the phone.I hope art and culture will break the barriers and go beyond different traditions and communities.Arts continues to thriveVyshnavie Sainath | Photo Credit: Special arrangementVyshnavie Sainath, dancerMy grandmother instilled excitement in us for Puthandu and would encourage us to buy new clothes. Paati would also make special food and students in my dance centre add extra cheer by wishing Puthandu vazthukal.Our celebrations will be intimate this year starting with puja and my mother (dancer Rajeswari Sainath) is already on a long call with paati to get the recipes right. The pandemic has taught me many things and I want to fearlessly implement them. It has shown me that despite the fear and uncertainty, students/parents/practitioners have not given up on their art and have swiftly shifted to the online platform. It only reinforces the belief in me that arts can adapt to every situation. I pray that the year gets better and I can perform live.Combining traditionsAshwin Nair and Nikita Kak | Photo Credit: Special arrangementStand-up comedian Ashwin Nair and Nikita KakThis year we will be combining the traditions of Navreh and Vishu. Interestingly, Kashmiris and Malayalis place a thali type arrangement of food items in front of the image of KrishnaWe celebrate Navreh by filling a plate with rice, vegetables and fruits called Thaal bharun and cook favourite recipes like Teheri and dum aloo. I miss going to my home town but will connect with them virtually.As children, we were always excited to see the Vishu kani (a beautiful platter of vegetables, fruits, grains, flowers, gold, cash and clothes and jewellery in front of a photo or statue of Vishnu) and receive money from our grandparents. Growing up we realise the pleasure of seeing such prosperity and receive such gifts at the start of the year. Vishu is a time to celebrate the year, the summer solstice and usher in joy and prosperity.The pandemic has limited our interaction with family back in Kerala but we still look forward to celebrating a smaller version of Vishu at home with my wife and mother. Our sweetest memories of Vishu were being surrounded by cousins and extended family and waking up to the Vishu kani with our grandmother and receiving the kaineetam and eating a rich sadhya as children.It was a time of celebrating in every way  beautiful sights, food and the joy of receiving pocket moneySubdued festivitiesMayanand Thakur | Photo Credit: Special arrangementMayanand Thakur, theatre actorWe hoist Gudi (stick, flag, garland of flowers, mango leaves, neem tree leaves and upturned silver or copper vessel on the top) on top of a building or apartment balcony. Gudi padwa is a festival of rituals and traditional food especially a tangy chutney prepared with neem leaves and flowers, grated raw mango, jaggery, pepper and chilli powder with a seasoning of hing and cumin and mustard seeds. This chutney is tasty and also good for health as it improves digestion. Another ritual is to bathe with neem leaves- soaked water that keeps our body cool.We missed grand celebrations due to the pandemic last year and unfortunately, the celebrations will be subdued considering the situation now and keeping each others safety as a priority. My most loved quote during the pandemic is: We isolate now, so when we gather again, no one is missing.New beginningsNidarshana Saikia Das | Photo Credit: Special arrangementNidarshana Saikia Das, entrepreneurRongali Bihu is a celebration of spring and of youth, hence the Bihu dance takes centre stage. Young and old sing, dance and play instruments like the dhol and pepa mostly in the fields and underneath the trees. Thankfully, some Bihu functions still make room for mukoli Bihu (where everyone can dance together). And dancing underneath peepal trees have tiptoed into verandahs and drawing rooms during private home parties.This time of the year is ritualistically spent in Assam but these two pandemic-struck years have been exceptions and we miss the fun of Rongali Bihu in our homeland. We usually plan a get-together with our Assamese friends in Hyderabad but with rising cases, it will be a traditional meal with just the family.In Assam too, my aged parents will be home as the situation is aggravating.I belong to Nagaon, a small town and we used to make a ritualistic trip to the village to soak in traditions and make and savour traditional foods. The whole day wed have these small groups of children and young adults, dressed in traditional attires, flocking from a home to another, singing and performing Bihu dance, collecting money to have a feast at the end. Many a time the hosts would join in.It is quite a sight to soak in  be it Bihu songs celebrating spring, exquisite dance moves, unique musical instruments and of course the food. These become very important windows for our children to a culture theyre fast getting detached from.Foster friendshipsTejdeep Kaur Menon | Photo Credit: Special arrangementTejdeep Kaur Menon, IPS (Retd)We usually have a huge congregation of 10,000 people during Vaisakhi; Singers from different parts of Punjab come here to perform shabd kirtan but we will be missing it this year. The celebrations have become a personal affair. People may visit the Gurudwara on their own but congregations and huge celebrations are not allowed. During this time, I usually have a blue salwar kurta ready for the festival as blue is the colour we wear on the day to go to Gurudwara. I plan to make kadha parshad at home and share it with neighbours.My big wish is for normalcy to return lessons learnt from the pandemic. We should realise life is fleeting and spend good quality time with each other and foster friendships at home and outside.I long to see my granddaughter too play with her friends with the freedom with which we played outside.Every year I get kirpan on Vaisakhi day from the community. It is a rare honour for a woman to receive it but this year I am going to miss it.",MUSTARD OIL

The state government welcomed the phenomenon saying that the private players procured the oilseed at rates much above the minimum support price.After visiting eight mandis of Gurgaon, Rewari, Mahendragarh, Dadri and Bhiwani, state Agriculture and Farmers Welfare Minister JP Dalal told The Indian Express: The MSP of mustard is Rs 4,650 per quintal while it is being sold up to Rs 5,800 per quintal in Rewari. In other mandis too, its price is above 5,500 per quintal.The government has not purchased even a single quintal of mustard in Haryana mandis till date. We are happy with this situation when the private players buy produce from farmers above the prices of MSP. The welfare of farmers is the utmost priority of the government. If we need the agricultural produce, then we can procure it from the market, said Dalal.Mustard is mainly produced in southern Haryana apart from some areas of Hisar and Fatehabad.High global prices have made edible oil imports dearer, benefiting domestic mustard growers just when their crop is being harvested and brought to the mandis. Haryana Agriculture and Farmers Welfare department Director General Hardeep Singh said, Mustard is used in soaps, cosmetics, personal care products and cattle feed too. We aim to increase the area under the crop also but traditionally it is restricted to southern Haryana, and Hisar.Commenting on the higher market prices of mustard, agriculture and food expert Devinder Sharma said, It gives more reasons to make MSP a legal right for farmers. If markets are willing to pay a higher price, there is no reason why a floor price by way of an MSP should not be fixed. It does not mean the state has to buy the entire produce. It only raises the benchmark for trade.A law to ensure MSP of agricultural crops is one among the main demands of farmers, who are currently sitting at the borders of Delhi as part of their ongoing agitation against three agri laws.Dalal said the Haryana farmers are happy because of higher production of mustard this time. This time, the production will be higher by 1-2 quintal per acre against the normal production of 8 quintal per acre.The minister said kapas (narma cotton) is also fetching higher prices than the MSP in Haryana mandis currently.

Although he transitioned to a career in food and beverages from science, his new book, The Flavor Equation , goes behind the recipes to investigate the science of taste, combining his knowledge of chemistry with the mysteries of flavour pairings. The popular food columnist, blogger and recipe developer spoke toabout the Indian influences on his writing and also on mainstream American cuisine. Edited excerpts from the interview.They go hand-in-hand. Ive always felt cooking in the kitchen is just like being in a lab but with a tastier outcome. Recipe writing is just like writing experiments -- things work and sometimes they dont. Thats when you try to understand what is happening and how to fix it. A large part of recipe development is also problem-solving and creating solutions. This is where science comes in. For example, for the longest time, the paneer I made in America was too soft with a ricotta-like consistency -- a problem I never encountered in India. It turned out the calcium levels in cows milk is lower than that of buffalos milk used in India. To fix this, I simply needed to increase the amount of calcium and curdle the milk. Calcium chloride, an ingredient commonly used in cheese-making, does both these things. It gives the extra calcium and also the acid to help the milk proteins change their shape and turn into a firm block of paneer.Growing up in India, Ive been fortunate to experience and taste food from different regions as well as see and appreciate Indian ingredients and techniques for their versatility. In India, you can travel through various states and a staple ingredient like rice will morph as it moves from biryanis to fermented batters that make dosas and idlis. It gives me a sense of how ingenuity comes into play as recipes reflect adaptations to changes in geography and culture.While I dont think were exactly there yet, I do think we are on our way to seeing Indian food and ingredients in more homes than earlier. I think this is one of the most exciting times to be cooking Indian food in America because people are genuinely excited to learn about new flavours and ingredients. The works of chefs and writers like the late Floyd Cardoz, Asha Gomez, Tejal Rao, Priya Krishna, and several others are certainly helping cement the prominence of Indian cuisine in America.Cooking and for that matter even appreciating flavour, is something we learn through trial and error over time. It is experiential. Ive learnt to cook by watching my family and friends as well as through cookbooks, magazines, television shows and also working as a pastry cook in a patisserie. Flavour is a wide umbrella that not only encompasses the taste and aroma of the ingredients in our food but it also involves the interplay of our senses -- the shapes and colours of the food we eat, the different textures of food, and even the sounds food makes as we cook and eat. I remember being taught in India to pay attention to the sound of cumin and mustard seeds popping when preparing a tadka. We are constantly using all sorts of sensory cues in our cooking. And then theres the interplay of our emotions and memories that influences our perception of flavour. We love some flavours more than others, be it something we experienced in childhood or something tied into our cultures. The Flavour Equation is a book that gets into all these different facets from a nerdy-yet-fun lens with the recipes acting as enticing experiments.Living in two very different parts of the world gave me the opportunity to not only taste new food but also compare and contrast. You start to notice how people and culture define food. Often, similar beloved combinations exist throughout the world. They just get painted with different spices and are cooked in different ways -- for example, mashed potatoes and meat is a popular dish in the West but in Mumbai, potato chops provide that same degree of comforting flavours and textures where ground meat is encased in a shell of smooth, mashed potatoes before being shaped and pan-fried.My blog started out as a way for me to talk about the Indian food I didnt see in restaurants or in magazines and an opportunity to show the versatility of Indian ingredients and techniques in Western cooking. I dont see myself as an expert on Indian food since I certainly dont know all there is to Indian cuisine but I do my best to share the food I enjoy cooking at home with people. Its been a long journey but one that Ive thoroughly enjoyed. While there are plenty of common misconceptions on Indian cooking, I try to do my best through my work to show people that they can easily incorporate a lot of those flavours in their own cooking at home. Over time, Ive been fortunate to write for outlets such asandIt has certainly helped me share my food with a larger audience.There is an incomparable joy that I nd difficult to express in words when I eat ripe Indian mangoes. During ripening, the starch transforms and gives way to a soft pulp thats sweet and sour, carrying an aroma that reminds me of warm summer holidays in Goa. While mangoes are delicious as a sweet treat, they also make an excellent addition to savoury applications. The fruity, sweet avour of mangoes with lime gives this beet salad a refreshing taste. Try to use a good ripe mango without a chalky aftertaste. Its no surprise that I recommend Indian mangoes, but champagne mangoes are a good option. Youll find paneer in the cheese section at Indian grocery stores as well as most regular food markets.Paneer is not a salty cheese, so the marinade must contain a bit more salt for the cheese to absorb.The salad dressing provides a second layer of flavour as well as salt.While paneer is one of the easiest cheeses you can make at home, I prefer the store-bought variety in this application, where shape and structural integrity are important. It takes the pressure of an extremely heavyweight to bring together the protein molecules in the paneer and force them to coalesce, producing a firm, compact paneer that can hold its shape when cut and cooked. Commercial producers have equipment that generates sufficient pressure; its a little tricky to do this at home but Ive developed a method that you can use; otherwise, store-bought is perfectly fine.Whisk the ker, salt, cumin, turmeric, chilli powder, and black pepper in a small bowl. Taste and season with more salt if needed. Pour the marinade into a large resealable bag.Cut the paneer into approximately 1 by 2 by  in [2.5 cm by 5 cm by 12 mm] cubes and place them in the bag with the marinade, seal, and gently shake to coat evenly. Let the paneer marinate for one hour at room temperature. If you need to marinate it longer, leave it in the refrigerator.Preheat the oven to 400F [204C].While the paneer marinates, prepare the beets. Peel, trim the ends, and cut into quarters. Place the beets in a baking dish or roasting tray, drizzle with the olive oil, and season with salt. Roast for 30 to 45 minutes, until they are tender on the inside and a knife slides through the centre with ease. Remove from the oven and let them rest for 10 minutes.While the beets roast, prepare the dressing. Place the mango, ker, oil, lime juice, mustard, pepper, and chilli powder into a blender and pulse on slow speed until combined and smooth. Taste and season with salt.Grill the paneer just before youre ready to assemble the salad. Heat a cast-iron grill pan or a medium non-stick sauce pan over medium-high heat and brush the surface with a little olive oil. With a pair of kitchen tongs, carefully lift the paneer out of the bag and cook it in batches in the hot pan until it turns golden brown and is slightly seared,two to three minutes per side.To serve, toss the arugula in a large mixing bowl with the olive oil. Add the pepper and season with salt. Add the warm grilled paneer pieces. Drizzle with a few tablespoons of the salad dressing. Sprinkle with the amchur just before serving.Serve the remaining salad dressing on the side.",MUSTARD OIL

A lot of nuts and seed varieties can be germinated too.Now, sprouting is said to add to the nutritional content and make it a lot healthier to eat. According to nutritionists, soaking seeds in water allows softening up of the outer shells and membranes that may contain some anti-nutrients and may not facilitate proper absorption. It also eliminates gas-producing starch and lessens the cooking time of legumes and pulses.Usually eaten raw or cooked, sprouts can help maximize nutrient absorption of core vitamins, minerals, antioxidant profiles which benefit good health.Not only are they a powerhouse of nutrition, but their health benefits would also convince you to add them to your diet. We tell you about a few such reasons:Sprouting legumes, seeds or vegetables help eliminate phytic acid present in the membranes which limit the presence of digestive enzymes within the seeds.Now, a lot of the important enzymes present within the seeds help facilitate digestive processes, keep our metabolism in check and also work to improve chemical reactions in the stomach when we digest food. The enzymes also break down the food more effectively upon digestion, which helps us absorb nutrients better.Not to forget, sprouting a legume or a cruciferous vegetable adds dietary fibre to the seeds which eliminate toxin build-up from the body and keep the stomach clean and healthy.While it's crucial to have good quality fruits, vegetables, nuts and seeds to lose weight effectively, sprouts are also a healthy option to have. Not only are they filled with benefitting nutrients, but they also are low on calories, which is a prime reason a lot of weight watchers tend to have them in the form of snacks.The fibre present in the sprouted grains can also induce satiety, make us feel full and limit the release of ghrelin, which is an important hunger hormone. Sprouted moong beans, fenugreek seeds particularly are good weight-loss-friendly options to include in your diet.Sprouts contain a healthy dose of core vitamins and minerals like iron, copper, manganese and potassium which help boost the production of RBCs in the body, promote blood flow and most of all, supplies healthy oxygenated blood to vital organs.In a similar manner, germination of seeds and pulses is known to promote the level of Vitamin C and antioxidant profiles which help WBCs and support the immune system, warding off risks of illnesses and infections.Some sprouts contain helpful Omega-3 fatty acids in them which reduce the harmful level of bad cholesterol in the body that is harmful to your health. The anti-inflammatory properties also help reduce oxidative stress and cut down the risk of developing cardiovascular complications, if had regularly. Make sure you include them plenty in your diet.Spouted germs and beans are also a rich source of Vitamin A, Vitamin C, antioxidants which are extremely good for your skin and hair health. It is said that Vitamin A stimulates the growth of hair follicles, regeneration of cells and keeps skin hydrated too.Zinc meanwhile can stimulate levels of sebum in your scalp. Thus, they are excellent for your skin and health!We know that sprouting contains multiple detoxifying, heart and gut-friendly properties. What many dont know is that sprouting and germination contain high levels of glucoraphanin which is a core enzyme that protects your body from multiple types of cancers.Need any more reasons to have sprouts?",MUSTARD OIL

We take a minute to appreciate three such local favourites, beyond the mainstream bounty of mango and watermelonThe hottest days of summer are here, and it is time to pay attention to staying hydrated while replenishing nutrients.There are various healthy summer coolers which help us to stay refreshed and energised as the mercury rises. The traditional choices of the hot season: musk melon, watermelon, lemon and tender coconut water are also pocket friendly. Here are some more juices that have been part of southern Indias cuisine for many generations.It was nungu paal (ice apple-based) and nannari sherbat that we had during my childhood in Thanjavur, but now the options are wider and healthier, says Devi Bala Chandrasekar, whose foodblog, KitchenDB focusses primarily on traditional, healthy family recipes.Each region in our country has special cool drinks and I have tried Nellai pazharasam (mixed fruit punch) and the much easier neer moru (spiced buttermilk) during summer, she adds.Devi Bala shares recipes of herbal summer drinks like lemongrass lemonade, orange and oregano juice, tulsi sherbet and variyali sherbet (fennel seeds and raisin) on her blog.Nandita Shah, a homeopath suggests juicing vegetables. In North India, aam panna (made with raw mango and jaggery), sol kadhi (a coconut milk drink laced with herbs) and jal jeera (herbs and lemon juice) are popular. But we can also try blending nutrient-rich vegetables with a little lemon juice and mint in a sugar-free drink, she says.She says sugar can be substituted with dates paste or raisins. She also suggests drinking tender coconut chaas, made by combining half a cup of creamy tender coconut kernel, eight drops of lemon juice, two-and-a--half cups of water and one teaspoon chaas masala.When it comes to vegetable juices, everyone prefers carrots and beetroots, which are naturally sweet . But ry blending any kind of gourd along with raw mango (the kilimooku variety) and you will enjoy it, says Sreedevi Lakshmikutty of Coimbatore-based Biobasics.Electrical mixer/blenders have made fresh juices easy to make at home. But we must aim at making these without sugar or at least substituting it with palm sugar or jaggery, she says.Sreedevi suggests trying blending curry leaves with coconut milk seasoned with some salt and palm sugar and adding little water to make it a nutrient loaded drink for the season. I wonder why people have stopped drinking the ragi koozh (fermented porridge) or the simple lemon water with a pinch of salt, she adds.Pune-based Neha Mathur, who blogs at The Whiskaffairs says In Pune, chaas, shikanji and Jeera soda are a daily affair during summer months. I make beetroot chaas which looks great, tastes good and kids simply love it. Also cucumber blended with tender coconut flesh can also be added to the regular chaas as it can cool the body, says Neha.Down South, it has always been the neeraagaram or pazhaya sadam (cooked rice fermented in water overnight) that has been the saviour for many during the harsh weather, says Seethalalshmi N, of Organic Farmers Market, Chennai.She adds, Using heritage rice and making sure to soak few fenugreek seeds along with the rice can promote health and keep the body cool and has numerous health benefits. She adds that soaking sabja seeds and almond gum overnight in water, and adding lemon juice and water and a pinch of salt makes a wonderful drink.Ice Apple Milk DessertIngredients5 palm fruit/nungu, skinned/chopped200 ml milk, boiled/chilled4 tbsp organic brown sugar1 tbsp edible rosewaterA few rose petalsA few pistachiosMethod : Chop the skinned palm fruits into fine pieces and keep aside, add it to the chilled milk in a bowl.

During COVID-19, the body gets weakened and it continues for days even after recovering from the symptoms. Thus, it becomes essential to consume the right kind of diet for a speedy and complete recovery of the body. We spoke to celebrity nutritionist Sandhya Gugnani and she recommended some food and diet tips based on the latest research.Start with meeting 50% of the nutritional requirement of the patient and proceed to 70% by the 3rd day, gradually increasing to 100% by the end of the week.The above micronutrients increase the T-cells & B-cells(antibody) in your body and will help in COVID recovery.The main diet focus for COVID patients is to consume foods that would help rebuild muscle, immunity and energy levels. Whole grains like ragi, oats or amaranth are rich sources of complex carbohydrates. Chicken, fish, eggs, paneer, soya, nuts and seeds are some good sources of protein. Healthy fats like walnuts, almonds, olive oil, mustard oil are recommended during these days. To boost ones immunity, one should take turmeric milk once a day.Five serving of all coloured fruits and vegetables are a must to get adequate vitamins and minerals when you are COVID positive. You can have small amounts of dark chocolate with at least 70% cocoa which can lift your mood, get rid of anxiety and will also boost your immunity.Most COVID patients experience loss of smell and taste or difficulty in swallowing. It is important to eat soft foods at small intervals and to add amchoor in the food.If the patient is getting diarrhoea/ nausea give Veg Khichdi, ginger tea ( ginger, tulsi/ lemongrass, cinnamon, clove or cardamom)Consume energy-boosting foods like banana, apples, oranges or sweet lime juice to deal with post-COVID fatigue. Add sweet potato in the salad or as a part of your meal. Take warm water with organic honey and lime.Drink plenty of fluids, like warm water with tulsi leaves to manage COVID symptoms, like cough and itchy throat. Avoid sugary drinks, alcohol, coffee as it leads to dehydration. Inhale steam with the tongue out at least 2-3 times a day.Fruits and vegetables do not transmit the virus directly, but they should be thoroughly washed before cooking or consumption. They should be ideally washed in warm water or you can add soda-bicarb to the water. Soak the vegetables and fruits in this water for some time before using it.Maintain good fluid balance as Hydration is the key to avoid urinary infections.

But, have you heard of canola oil? This oil is gradually gaining popularity in the Indian market, owing to its excellent properties, texture, and a plethora of health benefits that you might not find in your usual mustard or even olive oil.So to begin with the basics, what is canola oil?Canola obtains its name from two words  can stands for Canadian, and ola means oil. There is only one thing that differentiates canola from mustard oil: Erucic Acid  mustard oil has 47 per cent erucic acid. To understand the difference in simple terms, mustard oil minus 47 per cent erucic acid is canola oil,  explains Gurpreet Singh, managing director, JIVO Wellness.This vegetable oil is obtained from rapeseed which has a low percentage of erucic acid.Check out these four health benefits of canola oil:No trans fatsCanola oil has zero trans fats, which means, no cholesterol. Thus, it is the best option to reduce those extra kilos.High in good fatsCanola oil has low saturated oil content  only seven per cent, way less than olive oil, which has 15 per cent. Low saturated oil content helps in lowering cholesterol and further lowers the risk of heart diseases, says Singh.Since it is rich in mono-unsaturated fatty acids, the oil will help in the reduction of bad cholesterol and increase the good cholesterol in the body.Rich in Omega 3We all know how important omega 3 fatty acids are and canola oil offers just that. It is an excellent option for vegetarians to obtain these fatty acids to help you maintain a healthy heart, prevent the risk of cardiac diseases, strokes, and ensure healthy blood pressure, he adds.High smoking pointOil is an essential part of cooking in any Indian household, post which there is often a bit of it left over, and contributes to waste. Canola oil, however, has a high smoking point. This makes it healthy to be reused multiple times without compromising the oils taste or quality, Singh shares.For more lifestyle news, follow us: Twitter: lifestyle_ie | Facebook: IE Lifestyle | Instagram: ie_lifestyle",MUSTARD OIL

In addition to the night curfew in force, the markets are closed during the curbs.Facing the challenge of maintaining the supply chain, most of the grocery stores in Jaipur and elsewhere have got themselves registered with the platforms which render standardised services in the relaxation period of five hours everyday. The kirana, milk, vegetable and fruit shops are allowed to remain open from 6 a.m. to 11 a.m.The Retail as a Service (RaaS) platform has enabled the grocery shop owners to standardise and digitise their operations and streamline the unorganised segments of their business. The aggregator model, introduced by Kirana King, takes care of supply chain and marketing, besides reducing the working capital requirements and increasing the product range.Kirana King CEO Anup Kumar said here on Wednesday the RaaS platform had helped improve grocers efficiency during the pandemic and ensured replenishment of essential commodities at the shops. It has also provided diverse options to the consumers to purchase essentials from their vicinity during the limited hours of relaxation, he said.The Food and Civil Supplies Department has imposed a penalty of 18,000 on the retails in Bikaner, Alwar and Dungarpur districts for black-marketing and overpricing of food materials. Irregularities were found during 53 inspections, in which the grocers were found selling the items such as chana dal, mustard oil and soaps at prices higher than the maximum retail price.Consumer Affairs Secretary Naveen Jain said instructions had been given to the Collectors to get the price lists of food items pasted outside the grocery shops and ensure a balance between the demand and supply during the restrictions. Mr. Jain said a helpline number had been released for the consumers and the information about wholesalers and the mills of wheat flour, oil and pulses was provided to retailers.However, the guidelines during the restrictions have hampered the agricultural input business, as these shops are allowed to remain open for five hours on only two days in a week. Agricultural Input Dealers Association president Purushottam Khandelwal said since the farmers were unable to get seeds, fertilizers and pesticides for the kharif crops, the agricultural production would be adversely affected this year.",MUSTARD OIL

(Express File Photo by Amit Mehra)A vocal supporter of the Centres farm laws and the DBT scheme, Haryana Agriculture and Farmers Welfare Minister J P Dalal speaks on wheat procurement, farmers protest and more.What is the scenario of wheat procurement in Haryana?Normally, procurement season goes on for two months  April and May. But this year, we have procured almost the entire wheat brought to the mandis by farmers in just 20 days. The arrival of wheat in mandis has crossed the figure of 80 lakh MT. In the next one week, the entire procurement process is likely to be completed. Early procurement will lead to early sowing of next crops including cotton while sowing seems to be getting late in Punjab. Early sowing of cotton is beneficial for the health of the crop. This time there was no need for the government agencies to procure mustard in Haryana with the private players buying the same at the rate of Rs 6,500 per quintal which is much higher than of its MSP of Rs 4,650 per quintal. With higher prices, the mustard growers in Haryana got around Rs 1,500- Rs 2,000 crore additional income this season.How was the experience of DBT scheme in Haryana which was opposed by arhtiyas?This is a historical step for the economic freedom of farmers. The farmers will understand its results in coming years. We have already made payment of around 50 per cent to total procured wheat from the farmers. The farmers have always been paying interest to the arhtiyas (in lieu of advance taken from them). But this time, if the farmer gets payment after 72 hours, he will get the principal amount from the government along with the interest at the rate of 9 per cent on it.The farmers have apprehensions that the direct supply of crops to the silos is aimed to disband mandis.See, in Haryana we have maximum facilities of transportation and storage but despite that our lakhs of tonnes wheat kept in open ground under tirpals get spoiled. We had invited tenders from private players including farmers urging them to construct godowns. During this process, if somebody constructs silos of big capacity, what is wrong in it? In the country, we have three times more stocks (of foodgrains) than of the requirement. This is also a matter of happiness that the export of agricultural produce has increased by 18 per cent this year. We need logistics and capacity of storage for further exports.What are the preparations of the government for contract farming in light of new laws?The concept of contract farming is not mandatory for the farmers. Even today, contract system is prevalent in the cases of almost 50 per cent farmers where one takes land from another at contract for cultivation purposes. The annual contract ranges from Rs 30,000 to Rs 60,000 per acre. Their issues, if arise, are resolved by the local social panchayats. The Act on contract farming has been introduced to prevent exploitation of farmers by big companies. This concept is not compulsory in nature but optional. All clauses of this Act are pro-farmers.What do you think about crop diversification?First of all, we want mechanisation of agricultural farms, proper management of water, recharging of groundwater and crop diversification by promoting production of fruits. We also want to encourage those crops which require less water for irrigation purposes to break the paddy-wheat circle. There is a serious crisis of irrigation water in Haryana with depleting water levels, so certain schemes have been launched to ensure better utilisation of water too.How do you see the five-month-old farmer agitation?The issue of this agitation is between the central government and farmers. This agitation was started by Congress by creating fear that the mandis will be disbanded, the MSP system will go and the farmers will lose their land with big capitalists snatching the same. Nothing of this sort took place. Moreover, when the Supreme Court has stayed the laws, all the leaders and farmer brothers should suspend the agitation keeping in view the current situation of Corona pandemic.What according to you will be the political fallout of the farmer agitation?The emotions of everybody are attached with the word kisan. This is also a fact that the income of farmers did not increase during the past 60-70 years after the Independence. There is a need to consider that there were shortcomings in the previous policies. So, there was a need to do something different. I would like to express my gratitude to Modi ji that he has done what the leaders of Congress could not do during all these years.The leaders of BJP-JJP have faced a lot of opposition especially in villages because of the farmer agitation. How do you see this situation?They are political men from Congress and few Communists who by misusing the name of kisan indulge in Jindabad-Murdabad while showing black flags. But this is not going to continue for long. This practice is not good. There are workers of all political parties. If such a system develops, then every (politician) may face a similar situation.",MUSTARD OIL

When a baby is born, it is attached to its mother through the navel. This is because it is the navel that offers the essence of life and growth through the nutrients, blood and oxygen that reaches the baby. That is why your navel which is also the centre of your body is one of the primary points of nourishment and growth even as an adult, says Aakash Anand, Founder & CEO, Bella Vita Organic.Oiling the navel benefits our body, including our skin. It is a primitive practice, as mentioned in our Vedas and Ayurveda wherein women and men oil their navel to provide nourishment to their entire body. It has been medically proven that your belly button is connected to various veins in the body and oiling it can lead to curing several ailments, explains Anand.READ | Korean skincare: Try this step every morning to get firm, glowing skinWhat is navel oiling?In scientific terms, the practice of oiling is called the Pechoti method which can be helpful in correcting, balancing, and healing nervous connections within the body.Benefits of oilingWhile people generally use mustard or coconut oil to apply on the navel, it is not considered effective owing to the missing ayurvedic properties with healing elements. Anand suggests, To get the best results, it is advisable to massage with an oil that contains extracts such as neem, tea tree, lemon, grapeseed and almond oil which helps cleanse your belly button.Oiling the navel helps purify your body and provides healthy glowing skin, free from radical damage. Moreover, the navel absorbs oil faster and provides nourishment from within.READ | Why you must include fermented rice water in your hair care routineHow to practice it?This process barely takes two minutes. All you have to do is pour oil on your belly button. Apply it on the navel and massage your belly button in a circular motion for 5-10 minutes. It is best to do so daily before you go to bed for the best results, he adds.

421,,,,2021-05-11,https://indianexpress.com/article/world/un-experts-islamic-state-committed-genocide-against-yazidis-7310559/,"In this Tuesday, July 22, 2014, file photo, a motorist passes by a flag of the Islamic State group in central Rawah, 175 miles (281 kilometers) northwest of Baghdad, Iraq, nearly six weeks since a Sunni militant blitz led by the Islamic State extremist group seized large swaths of northern and western Iraq. (AP)The head of a U.N. team investigating atrocities in Iraq announced Monday it has found clear and compelling evidence that Islamic State extremists committed genocide against the Yazidi minority in 2014 and said the militant group successfully developed chemical weapons and used mustard gas.Karem Khan told the Security Council the team also concluded war crimes were committed by the Islamic State group against predominantly Shiite unarmed cadets and personnel from the Tikrit Air Academy who were captured, tortured and subjected to mass execution in June 2014. He said an Islamic State video released in July 2015 showing the killings constitutes a direct and public incitement to commit genocide against Shia Muslims.The Security Council voted unanimously in September 2017 to ask the U.N. to establish an investigative team to help Iraq preserve evidence and promote accountability for what may amount to war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide committed by Islamic State extremists, both in Iraq and the Levant, which includes Syria.In his sixth report to the council, Khan said the U.N. Investigative Team to Promote Accountability for Crimes committed by the Islamic State group, also known as Daesh, ISIL and ISIS, rapidly expanded the amount of evidence it has in the last six months.Read | With a mass funeral, Yazidi survivors honor victims of ISISHe said significant developments in collecting forensic evidence from mass grave sites, digital data extracted from hard drives that belonged to the IS group, digitization of case files, and use of advanced technological tools to process and search databases has allowed the team to establish clear timelines of activities of key ISIL members.Khan called it a landmark moment that the team, known as UNITAD, had established convincing evidence that Islamic State extremists committed genocide against the Yazidi as a religious group with the intent to destroy the Yazidi physically and biologically.This was manifest in the IS ultimatum applied to all Yazidis to convert or die and led to thousands killed, either executed en masse, shot as they fled, or dying from exposure on Mount Sinjar as they tried to escape, Khan said. Thousands more were enslaved, with women and children abducted from their families and subjected to the most brutal abuses, including serial rape and other forms of unendurable sexual violence that for many lasted years, often leading to death.Khan added that crimes against the Yazidis continue, with thousands of women and children separated from their families or missing and some still with their their IS captors or those to whom they were sold.In 2016, the U.N.-mandated Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Syria said the Islamic State group was committing genocide against Yazidis, and several non-governmental organizations have echoed that conclusion.But Khan said what UNITAD has done in terms of the Yazidis is more important because the team was mandated to look at a variety of evidence that could stand up in court where the burden of proof is on the prosecution  and to not just draw brush strokes from a survey of victims.He said information from electronic devices that belonged to IS extremists also led UNITAD to open a new investigation into the development and successful deployment of chemical and biological weapons by ISIL in Iraq.Evidence collected by UNITAD details how the militant group used laboratories at Mosul University as the epicenter of its chemical weapons program, drawing on the expertise of scientists and medical professionals from Iraq and abroad, Khan said.Initially, he said, IS weaponized chlorine from water treatment plants captured by its fighters in 2014, and subsequently developed toxic lethal compounds including thallium and nicotine that were tested on live prisoners, leading to death.IS then developed a system to produce mustard gas, also called sulfur mustard, that was deployed in March 2016 through the firing of 40 rockets at the Turkmen Shia town of Taza Khurmatu, Khan said.Khan, who will become chief prosecutor at the International Criminal Court on June 15, said this investigation is rapidly progressing, with initial results anticipated to be completed within five months. By the end of the year, he said, the team also anticipates initial results addressing crimes against minority Christians, Kakai, Shabak, Shia Turkmen and Sunni communities in Iraq, as well as the massacre of predominantly Shia inmates at Badush prison.Khan said the next step is to use the information and evidence collected by UNITAD to meet the expectations of survivors and put it before national courts to prosecute those responsible for these horrific crimes.He expressed hope that Iraqi legislators will adopt a legal basis to prosecute IS members for war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide. He welcomed legislation presented to Parliament in the Kurdistan region last week to establish a court with jurisdiction over international crimes committed by IS.We must make sure that we dont become this archive, this library, Khan said of the teams evidence.He said every member of the international community should feel this sense of urgency for justice as if their own mother, father or child had lost their life or was not accounted for.Nobel Peace Prize laureate Nadia Murad, a Yazidi forced into sexual slavery by IS fighters who killed her mother and six brothers, urged the Security Council to refer the genocide against her people to the International Criminal Court or establish a court to prosecute those responsible for the atrocities.I ask you to start a new chapter  legal accountability for ISIS crimes would dramatically impact every action of my communitys recovery, she said. It is time for the international community to do, more than listen. It is time to act. If world leaders have the political will to act on this evidence, then justice is truly within reach.",MUSTARD OIL
422,,,,2021-05-12,https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/rural-imperative-indian-economy-agricultural-exports-minimum-support-price-7312693/,"The year 2020-21 was exceptional, where the farm sector expanded by 3 per cent, even as the Indian economy as a whole contracted by 6.5 per cent. Agricultural exports also grew 17.5 per cent, despite the value of the countrys overall merchandise shipments falling by 7.2 per cent. There were three drivers behind this unusual dichotomy. The first, of course, was Covid-19 cases being very low in rural areas last year and the government exempting agricultural activities from lockdown restrictions. The second was excellent rains and favourable winter temperatures that helped farmers harvest a bumper crop. The third was a spike in global agri-commodity prices from around October, the benefits of which were reaped by soyabean, mustard, groundnut, cotton, arhar, urad and chana growers. All these crops were sold near or above their minimum support price (MSP) levels, making it a Goldilocks moment of sorts for farmers, who produced more as well as realised good harvest prices. The end result was that rural India provided a cushion for the economy, which suffered its worst recession since Independence and the first after 1979-80.The availability of that cushion is in doubt today, with the second wave of the pandemic not sparing even the hinterlands. The Indian Meteorological Department has forecast a normal southwest monsoon, while the Food and Agricultural Organisations world food price index hit an 83-month-high in April. On both these fronts  rainfall and prices  the outlook for agriculture, thus, remains favourable. That leaves the one, albeit major, source of uncertainty: The spread, intensity and duration of the pandemic. The sole consolation as of now is that the main kharif planting season will begin only from mid-June with the arrival of the monsoon rains. If the current wave subsides by then, things shouldnt turn out too bad. That, needless to add, is a best case scenario  including for tractor, FMCG and cement companies that rode high on rural demand in 2020-21.Last year, the government did two things that were right. The first one was to undertake massive procurement of wheat, paddy, mustard and rabi pulses that were marketed post the lockdown. The second was the record 389.37 crore person-days of employment that got generated under MGNREGA during 2020-21. Both these, together with the Rs 6,000-per-farmer cash transfer under PM-Kisan, ensured sizeable liquidity infusion into the rural economy. This year, there is not much requirement for MSP procurement, barring in wheat. The scope of MGNREGA works is also limited when Covid has made deep inroads into rural areas. The focus should, instead, be more on cash transfers. Theres no better time to put to use the JAM (Jan Dhan-Aadhaar-Mobile) infrastructure than now.",MUSTARD OIL

It is a non-grain recipe, once known as the elixir of the gods: Mead. Crafted from honey and water and fermented by yeast, mead leaves a small carbon footprint since it depends on bees and nectar already available on existing farmlands, unlike grains that are cultivated specifically for beer, rum or whiskey.In terms of alcohol content, mead is closer to wine than beer, ranging between eight to 20% ABV (the amount of alcohol/ethanol in a drink). Mead is widely thought to be one of the oldest alcoholic beverages, with evidence of a fermented beverage made of honey, rice, and fruit dating to 7BC in China.Over the past decade, meaderies in India have slowly been taking this story forward in some pockets of the country. In barely a year since it opened, Nashik-based Cerana Meads is supplying to select hotels and restaurants in Mumbai, Pune, Thane and Nashik.Pune-based Moonshine, which holds the distinction of being Asias first meadery, has been around since 2018 and retails its experimental wares across retail at about 200 stores and 200 restaurants across Mumbai, Pune, Aurangabad, Nashik, Navi Mumbai,Thane and Goa.We began with just two tanks when we were testing the waters for mead, then we scaled up with two larger tanks and now we have 20,000 litre tanks like the ones at wineries, at our factory. Our idea is to have a pan India footprint and build a global brand, says Moonshine co-founder Rohan Rehani. Clearly, mead is in demand.Built by curiosityFor Yoginee Budhkar and Ashwini Deore, co-founders at Cerana Meads in Nashik, starting a meadery in 2020 was a natural progression of their interest in beekeeping and their fascination with fermentation. Yoginee explains, While doing my doctorate in Food Engineering and Technology, I had a fortuitous introduction to meads while visiting a professor in the UK. My friend and fellow PhD scholar Ashwini was enthusiastic about creating an innovative product from agricultural resources, and her love for wine and spirits led us to Cerana Meads.Along with its flagship mead, the meadery has collaborated with breweries in Maharashtra and Karnataka to make braggots, melding malt and mead, and also makes Indias very first pyment  a mead using grapes. Their version uses chenin blanc grapes from Nashik.Ceranas melomels, which are fruit-infused meads, highlight both local produce and natural honey, Our jamun (black plum) melomel uses local jamuns and jamun honey, which is earthy and spicy. For our pomegranate melomel, we have a lychee honey that has floral notes. We also use multi-floral honey from forests in Himachal Pradesh, where you find citrus fruits and flowers, says Yoginee.All of Ceranas offerings are priced at 180 a pint except for their Yule spice sold in winter at 450. The products find takers among the 25-40 age bracket, largely upper middle class consumers who have travelled and are curious to try out homegrown craft beverages. Says Cerana customer Shilpa Brahme from Pune, Their jamun melomel and yule spice continue to be my favourites. Being a home-baker, I have also used Yule spice for cake preparations when Ive invited friends for dinner and dessert.Business of beesThe founders at Cerana have undergone training in beekeeping. In every natural hive, a portion of the honey is used as food for the bee larvae, and the surplus gets stored in the upper one-third of the structure.Manmade bee-boxes mimic this ingenious design. The upper one-third of the bee-box, called the super, is where honey is stored. The lower two-thirds, called the brood box, houses the queen and worker bees. It took us painstaking effort to convince beekeepers to start using only the supers for their honey collection, instead of invading the brood box, and we buy only that honey for our mead production, states Yoginee.Bee Whisperer Akshay Borse at work for the Moonshine Project. Photo: Special Arrangement/THE HINDUHoney is also important to entrepreneur duo Rohan Rehani and Nitin Vishwas, who started Moonshine. Back then, meads did not exist in the Indian excise lexicon. Now Moonshine Meadery in addition to its regular stream of meads in the market, has branched out to a special Moonshine Honey Project.Moonshine has its own bee whisperer, Akshay Borse, with two years of experience on the field, 10 harvests across the country, and probably 1,000 bee stings, Akshay has made it his mission to change the way beekeeping is practised in the country, adds Rohan. The Mustard honey harvested from Doonda, Rajasthan, in January 2021, tastes like a lemon glaze, quite counterintuitive to the memory of pungent mustard.Our latest harvest was in March, an acacia honey which we will use for the next edition of the Project X mead, to highlight the wonderful single-origin honey that our country has to offer, states Nitin. To revive beekeeping, bee-boxes have been set up in and around Pune, and the Mulshi valley.The post-processing filtration and packaging is carried out below 38 degrees Celsius, to preserve all the bio-enzymes produced by the bees. The lockdown has been busy at Moonshine, with the launch of MeadLABS, gluten-free meads celebrating seasonal fruits andhoney, priced between 130 in Goa to 190 in Maharashtra. The meadery plans to expand retail in Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Kerala by 2022.Moonshines grilled pineapple mead is made with rum-soaked pineapple that has been grilled over coal and combined with a multi-floral honey.

In fact, Dushyant says, this time, 82.1 lakh MT of wheat has been lifted from mandis in a record time due to which the farmers did not have to face loss due to the storm and rain.For the first time in the country, the Haryana government made a provision under which 9 per cent interest was to be paid to the farmer if there was a delay in making a payment. About Rs 77 lakh have been given to farmers as additional interest in such cases, he added.Giving information about the mustard crop, Chautala said that last time over 7 lakh MT of mustard was procured at MSP, and this time the same has been increased to Rs 4,650 per quintal.The state government did not have to procure a single grain of mustard on MSP this time, as farmers were (even) paid Rs 7,275 per quintal in the market, he claimed.He reiterated the commitment to increase health facilities in rural areas and said that an amount of Rs 18.40 crore for 6,136 gram panchayats with less than 10,000 population and Rs 4.90 crore for 98 gram panchayats with over 10,000 population, has been approved to build isolation wards in villages. A 10-member team will look after the health facilities in these isolation wards out of which five members will be from the health department while the rest will be from the gram panchayat.Tauktae alert for next 48 hoursChautala also warned the people regarding Tauktae which is approaching towards the state. He urged the people to stay vigilant during the next 48 hours and to not step out of their homes. According to the Meteorological Department, the cyclone is moving towards Haryana via Gujarat, Rajasthan and its speed can be up to 50 kilometers per hour.All deputy commissioners have been instructed to conduct regular monitoring in this regard.

We believe he fell in love with its culture and found remnants of his beloved Lucknow in Metiabruz or Matiaburj where he chose to settle,"" said Shahenshah Mirza, 54, a civil servant and a history buff.The nawab, over the years, built some 18 palaces and the landmark Sibtainabad Imambara in Calcutta, but his descendants live scattered as the British demolished the palazzos on one pretext or the other.Mirza and his father, 86-year-old Sahebzada Wasif Mirza - the president of the Awadh Royal Family Association -- now live in a modest though stately old house at Talbagan Lane, off Dargah Road, in the heart of the eastern metropolis.""Just 500 of his followers came with him in 1856, but as news spread that he was building a Lucknow-like city within a city, at Metiabruz in Calcutta, many of his nobles, artisans and musicians followed and flourished here,"" said Mirza.Though much of the original mini-city which Wajid Ali built was taken over for Garden Reach shipyards, Metiabruz still exists and is now famous as a garment tailoring hub -- reportedly accounting for Rs 15,000 crore worth of textile trade a year -- mainly on account of the skilled tailors who came here as part of the Nawab's entourage.Wajid Ali, who used the pen name ""Akhtarpiya"" for his poetry, prose and thumris, was a known patron of arts, and with the destruction of Mughal cities in the aftermath of the 1857 revolt, Kolkata subsequently became the new cultural capital, attracting talent from all over north India.As time progressed, Bengal's zamindars and rich 'bhadraloks' (gentlemen) enthusiastically developed a taste for the Nawab's leisure activities 'mujra' (music and dance soirees), kite-flying and pigeon games (kabootar baazi). ""Even today some 3,000 people are engaged in the business of making kites in this city,"" explained Mirza.The nawab introduced the citys elite to Thumri, Dhrupad and Kathak. ""Singers and dancers of the calibre of Bindadin Maharaj, Piyari Sahab, Gauhar Jaan, Malka Jaan, Jauhar Jaan came to settle here...Kolkata opened up to Kathak and thumris,"" said well-known Shantiniketan-based musicologist Rantideb Maitra.This, in later years, influenced the film industry and the dance and music forms became part of the pan-Indian culture.The song 'Babul Mora' itself was popularised by Kolkata-based music director Rai Chand Boral when he got Kundan Lal Saigal to sing it for the movie 'Street Singer' in 1938, nearly 80 years after it was written.""Kathak, though it started as a temple dance, had taken a stylised form under the Mughal patronage. When brought to Kolkata by Wajid Ali, who himself often danced as Krishna, it blossomed into a popular classical dance form,"" said Shyam Banerjee, another musicologist and Urdu translator.However, if the average Kolkatan remembers the Awadh ruler with fondness, it is because of the gastronomic legacy he left behind.Said Manzilat Fatima, another of Wajid Ali's descendants from his junior begum, Hazrat Mahal -- who led mutineers in Lucknow and eventually escaped to Nepal -- ""He (Wajid Ali) tried to recreate Lucknow but with a difference...(among other things) his kitchen became an experimental centre for new dishes.""Fatima (53), who runs the up-market restaurant Manzilat's explained that experiments led to the inclusion of potato -- then a rich man's exotic vegetable favoured by Europeans -- and eggs to Awadh's Biryani. ""New spices, coconut milk, mustard oil, all went into the making of Awadhi dishes and the result was the unique dum-pukht Kokata Biryani, now so popular all over,"" she said.The Nawab also set up a printing press in Metiabruz and came out with a weekly gazette in Urdu, adding to the literary and journalistic tradition of the city, which boasts of being the cradle to some of India's oldest newspapers.""We feel he was more popular in the city he chose to make his own than in Lucknow...When the legendary filmmaker, Satyajit Ray, asked my father how he saw Wajid Ali's legacy, he had explained that it lives on, as is evident from the fact that 'you chose to make your first Hindi movie - Shatranj ke Khilari - on a novel based on the the Awadh ruler's life',"" added Mirza.",MUSTARD OIL

Niranjan Reddy with departmental officials including Secretary M. Raghunandan Rao, Managing Director of Telangana State Seed Development Corporation K. Keshavulu and others on Tuesday. The Minister reiterated appeal to the farming community to take up crops having good demand in the market such as cotton, red gram and others.He stated that cotton was likely to be raised in 70.05 lakh acres followed by paddy in 41 lakh acres and red gram in 20 lakh acres. Of the 1.4 lakh cotton seed packets (450 grams each) required for this season, 59.32 lakh packets were already positioned in districts.The Minister also stated that the government was not supplying soyabean seed due to non-availability of quality seed on account of excessive and untimely rains in Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh during the last kharif season. The seed was mostly sourced from these two States. He suggested that the farmers either grow alternative crops to soyabean or be extra careful while purchasing seed from private dealers.Asking the field level officials to educate farmers from now on against taking up paddy cultivation on a large scale during the next rabi (yasangi) and instead going for crops such as groundnut, sesamum, mustard and others having good demand in the edible oil market.To encourage cultivation of pulses, particularly redgram, the government had also decided to supply two kg of redgram seed per acre for growing it as an inter-crop with cotton and others.

The mere nature of the rising cases, especially post-COVID-19 is enough to scare people.Unfortunately, the rising proportion of cases has also fueled disputed claims on social media. One such recent one made people believe that things in their home could be spreading scary fungal infections.A recent claim on social media, which has been widely shared has made many believe that the vegetables stored in your refrigerator can have black fungus.Read more: Fact Check: Can black fungus be cured by turmeric, rock salt, alum and mustard oil? A post on Facebook, originally published in Hindi advises people to be careful of common use vegetables, including onions which could be a harbinger of black fungus infection.The post roughly could be translated as ""Beware while buying onions from the market and storing them in the refrigerator. The black grime or fungus often seen on the outer shell of the onions is toxic black fungus that causes mucormycosis.""The viral claim further mentions that if people are not too careful, the black grime can spread if used while cooking curries or stored in the refrigerator's cool settings.Read more: Can you get black fungus infection without testing positive for COVID-19? The writers of the post also claimed that the black mould can collect on the refrigerator surfaces and cause harm.Ever since the date of publishing, the post has been widely shared across platforms.Not only is the claim completely untrue, but the mode of transmission for black fungus also isn't through mere objects, or in this case, fruits or vegetables.For one, the fungi which form inside the refrigerator, the fungal grime present on onion shells are completely different from the black fungus infection.As per experts, the moulds which grew inside a refrigerator may be caused by some forms of bacteria, yeast. While they can be dangerous and cause contamination, they showcase nonspecific symptoms.The fungus, meanwhile, found on the onion shells is the result of a common fungus found in the soil. While it is pertinent that all vegetables be thoroughly washed before use, the fungus found on onions is rarely infectious.The black fungus infection, on the other hand, spreads in a very different manner and is many more times symptomatic. As per health experts, it carries a mortality rate of 50%.Black fungus infection, which is spread through fungal moulds called 'mycormetes' are present in the environment. The infectious spores cause the dangerous disease when a person, who is at risk of infection inhales them via contaminated surfaces (such as unsanitary environment) or humid temperatures. Simply put, it doesn't spread through the food you eat or objects you may touch, but when you inhale these contagious moulds through unclean surfaces.Reports have also suggested that the use of unfiltered or unclean water supply used for oxygenation in COVID-cases may also be a source of transmission of disease.Additionally, a black fungal infection, though carries a high mortality, isn't infectious for everybody. As per AIIMS Director and renowned medical expert, Dr Randeep Guleria, people suffering from extreme or uncontrolled diabetes, or those who have been using steroid therapy for long, since their immunity could be suppressed.Mucurmycetes infection also primarily affects people who are suffering from severe comorbidities or routinely consume medications that suppress the body's immunity to fight off infections.Furthermore, a black fungus infection can be diagnosed and detected by extracting a fluid sample from the sinus passage, tissue imaging and prior medical history.The information on black fungus infection has been clarified by a number of credible medical experts and doctors. Guidelines, information have also been listed down by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) on social media.There's no truth to the matter of the black fungus infection is similar to the moulds growing in your refrigerator, or the onion. At a time like this, it is critical that we get our facts right, be aware of the symptoms and seek treatment at the earliest. If you have recently recovered from coronavirus, or experience symptoms such as black crust formation around the nose, excruciating headaches, swelling, redness, seek a doctor's consultation at the earliest.",MUSTARD OIL

The party accused the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) of reversing all economic gains made by the Congress led United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government, insensitive treatment of the farmers, inept handling of the COVID-19 pandemic and failing to protect the country against threats from China.Randeep Surjewala, Congress general secretary and in-charge of communication department, in a virtual press conference said the Modi government was the weakest government India had had in 73 years.When the UPA government demitted office in 2014, the GDP was 8.1%, Mr. Surjewala said. Even before the pandemic hit in 2019-20 the GDP had fallen to 4.2%. In the first quarter of the 2020-21, the GDP was down to minus 24.1% and in the second quarter it is now minus 7.5%. It is estimated that in 2020-21 the GDP will be close to minus 8%, he said.High unemployment rateThe government came to power on the promise of providing two crore employment. In seven years they should have provided 14 crore jobs. Forget about 14 crore jobs, the unemployment rate is on a 45-year high, he added.Skyhigh inflation was exacerbating the already volatile situation. Petrol is selling at 100 per litre while mustard oil at 200 per litre. The LPG cylinders are at 809 per. The rate of pulses is also skyrocketing, he added.The Congress leader also slammed the government for its insensitive attitude towards the farmers. He said that the BJP government wanted big corporations to replace the small farmers. He also accused the government of going back on their promise of implementation of the Swaminathan Commission report.Govt is against poorThis government is not against poverty, they are against the poor, he said pointing at the World Bank report that claimed that during the UPA years 27 crore persons overcame extreme poverty while the PEW Research Centre in 2020 said middle class had shrunk in India with nearly 3.20 crore people being pushed off the grid.Mr. Surjewala reiterated the Congresss earlier allegation that the government had been under-reporting the COVID-19 deaths. Will the Modi government explain why there is a paucity of vaccines? And if there were no vaccines for us then why were 6.63 crore vaccines sent to the other countries, he said.Despite the chest-thumping by the Modi government, Mr. Surjewala said, China continued to occupy the Indian territory with impunity in Ladakh and Arunachal Pradesh.",MUSTARD OIL

class and the marginalised instead of attacking poverty.""The Modi government has decimated by design a robust Indian economy into deep economic recession today.The Modi government is responsible for runaway inflation where petrol is crossing Rs 100 for first time in 70 years and mustard oil is crossing Rs 200 per litre.""The Modi government is guilty of unpardonable compromise on national integrity as also our territorial integrity.The Modi government has only given us pain and suffering and has decimated the very edifice of democracy in this country and we need to restore it as a

pseudo-nationalist government utterly failed to defend our borders and to push back the Chinese from our territory"".""Time has come to ask who is responsible for insurmountable devastation, agony and anguish and unfathomable pain that has been inflicted on the people of India and that is why it is time for stock-taking,"" he said.On the Congress's poor performance at the hustings and the party not being considered as an alternative force, Surjewala said the party leadership is aware that its first priority is to save the nation from the Modi-made disaster and ensure bringing the nation back on the path of progress and help put money in the pockets of people, increase their incomes and wipe the tears of farmers and reach out to the poor and vulnerable.""The Congress party is working out what

The answer is lack of political will as well as no vision of the successive governments towards diversification of crops, farmer leaders say.Punjab used to cultivate almost 8 times more area under oilseeds than what is is cultivating now.Data sourced from the Punjab Agriculture University (PAU) Ludhiana, revealed that in 1967-68, Punjab had 3.99 lakh hectares area under oilseeds cultivation (which was maximum in its history since 1960-61).This area reduced to 48,900 hectares (provisional) in 2019-20 which is over 8 times less in area than what it was over five decades back. Also the total production then was 3.14 lakh tonnes, which came down to around 56,000 tonnes in 2018-19.Earlier, groundnut, sesamum, cotton (kharif crops) while sunflower, rapeseed and mustard (rabi crops) used to be grown in large areas.The area under groundnut cultivation was 2.22 lakh hectares in 1967-68 which has now come down to just 1,800 hectares. While the production has come down from 2.40 lakh tonnes to 3,600 tonnes but the yield has increased from 1,024 kg to 1,980 kg per hectare because of good quality of seeds.Similarly, area of rapeseed/mustard has come down to around 3,800 hectares from 1.80 lakh hectares five decades back and the production is now 57,000 tonnes against the then 1.40 lakh tonnes. The per hectare yield of this crop has doubled from 778 kg to 1,478 kg per hectare.Sunflower, which was introduced in Punjab in the early 1990s, had 1.03 lakh hectares in 1995-96 which has now reduced to 4,400 hectares and its production came down from 1.61 lakh tonnes to 8,300 tonnes. However, its yield has increased from 1,566 kg to 1,886 kg per hectare now.Seamum was cultivated in 25,600 hectares in 1974-75 which has come down to 41,000 hectares now while its yield too has decreased from 359 kg to 345 kg per hectares.Talking to The Indian Express, Dr Virender Sardana, Principal Agronomist (oilseeds) at PAU, said, Punjab is blessed to have agro-climatic conditions that are best suited for growing both kharif and rabi season oilseeds. We had been a big producer of these crops till the onset of the Green Revolution when farmers moved to wheat-paddy cycle. It is because of the assured market price that the farmers have got used to. Demand for oilseeds in India is huge. What it calls for is only a little impetus and focused approach of the state government. Paddy is a known water-guzzling crop, and we are not exporting rice but exporting our precious ground blue water.Fortunately, almost all the sarson (mustard) grown in Punjab is Canola sarson, which is the best among all varieties from a health point of view and Punjab can become the leading producer of this crop in the country too. As much Punjab moves to oilseeds, it dependence on the central government will reduce, which has of late, been putting difficult conditions on the state and its farmers just before the wheat and paddy procurment season, he said.Even if Punjab government buys Canola sarson directly from farmers and export it under its own established brands such as Sohna of Markfed, it will soon run out of stock as the well-developed western markets of Europe and North America only use Canola Sarson for human consumption and no other, he said, adding that Sohnas Sarson da Saag is already a big hit among NRIs settled in Europe, Australia and North America.Farmers would be far more than happy to cultivate Canola sarson instead of wheat as it consumes less water, less time and less input cost while its MSP is also quite good, he said.Currently, the total consumption of oil in the state is around 0.54 million tonnes to 0.60 million tonnes. According to the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare data, the per capita oil consumption of India is around 19.5 kg.Going by this calculation, Punjabs consumption will come around to 0.54 million tonnes as Punjab has 2.77 crore population. And this consumption is 2.07% of countrys total oil consumption.Punjabs gross cropped area in 2018-19 was estimated at 78.30 lakh hectares (lh). Out of that, 35.20 lh was under wheat cultivation and another 31.03 lh under paddy, adding up to 84.6% of the total area planted to all crops. That ratio was just over 32% in 1960-61 and 47.4% in 1970-71. This was the result of the Green Revolution.Punjab needs to divert at least 10-12 lakh hectares to other crops. The state can easily increase area under oilseeds by reviving areas under groundnut, sesame, cotton, mustard oil, sunflower and these crops can be easily grown on 10 to 15 hecatres during kharif and rabi seasons collectively. But the state government needs to support its farmers just like other state government do if the MSP of any crop goes down, said Jagmohan Singh, general secretary, BKU (Dakuanda), adding that farmers can grow anything provided he gets an assured market for his produce.Why is the government unable to keep a corpus of few 100 crores for crops other than wheat and paddy for support in case of need, asks a farmer.",MUSTARD OIL
437,,,,2021-06-01,https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/feul-prices-covid-lockdown-indian-economy-7340214/,"Lockdown-induced curbs on economic activity and being mostly confined indoors may have led many to look past the steep hikes in petrol and diesel prices  roughly Rs 4-4.5 per litre in the current month alone. The same, however, cannot be said about edible oils, whose consumption would have gone up with more food getting cooked in homes. The sharp price increase in these is noticeable and is biting consumers. Packed mustard, groundnut and sunflower oil are now retailing at an average of Rs 175-180 per kg, as against Rs 110-140 a year ago. All-India modal prices of even the mass-consumed vanaspati, palm and soyabean oil have risen from Rs 85-90 to Rs 140-150/kg in the last one year.India imports 13-15 million tonnes (mt) of edible oils annually, while domestic production is only 7.5-8.5 mt. The prices that consumers, therefore, pay are largely linked to what it costs to import them. Landed prices of imported crude palm, soyabean and sunflower oil in India now, at around $1,200, $1,400 and $1,550 per tonne, respectively, are way higher than their corresponding May 2020 averages of $558, $672 and $789. The reasons for petrol, diesel and LPG cylinder prices going up in the recent period, apply equally to cooking oil. There is one fundamental difference, though: Unlike with petroleum, where only a handful of indigenous crude producers (as opposed to refiners) exist, India has several thousand oilseed growers. These farmers make money when edible oil prices harden in the international and domestic market. And they did this time: Groundnut, soyabean and mustard traded near or above their official minimum support prices during both the kharif and rabi marketing seasons.Edible oils apart, prices of pulses  mainly chana (chickpea) and tur (pigeon-pea)  have also shown an uptrend, albeit far less compared to the former. The Narendra Modi government, it seems, is concerned. On May 15, imports of major pulses were moved from the restricted to free list. While that is welcome  regulating imports should always be through tariffs, not quantitative restrictions  a simultaneous move directing millers, traders and importers to disclose their stocks on a weekly basis isnt. The government needs to take a balanced view: India produces too much rice, wheat and sugar, while being import-dependent on pulses and edible oils. Farmers should be encouraged to grow more of the latter, which also requires less water. When market prices are favouring this virtuous shift in cropping pattern, any administrative action sending out the opposite signals  ahead of the kharif planting season  is unwelcome.",MUSTARD OIL

The advisory issued on Monday includes measures like sitting in the sun for a couple of hours in the morning, consuming a potion of alum, turmeric and rock salt mixed with warm water and applying mustard oil in nasal cavities Ghaziabad has reported 70 cases of black fungus. On Sunday, the district recorded its third mucormycosis death after a 52-year-old woman from Shastri Nagar passed away. Shakuntala Devi was undergoing treatment at a hospital since May 16.Regional ayurveda and unani officer, Dr Ashok Rana, said: Samshamani Vati, Nishamalaki Vati and Sudarshan Ghanwati can be used as prophylactics. One tablet each of Samshamani Vati and Nishamalaki Vati have to be taken twice a day. One tablet of Sudarshan Ghanwati in the morning and two at night are also needed. One drop of Anu tel, a herbal oil, has to be administered in the nostrils. He added that a patient should contact an ayurvedic practitioner before taking these. A potion of alum, turmeric and rock salt mixed with warm water can be taken and a few drops of mustard oil can be put in the nasal cavities, the advisory says. Drinking a mixture of 5 gram alum, 10 gram turmeric, 20 gram rock salt and warm water every morning can help, says the advisory. Take the powder, add mustard oil to make a paste, and apply that on the gums. Rinse after two minutes A few drops of mustard oil in the nostrils will help stop the growth of the fungus.Doctors, however, said regulated use of steroids and maintaining hygiene are the best ways to keep the infection away. Senior ENT surgeon Dr BP Tyagi, who has treated about 35 black fungus patients at his Raj Nagar clinic, said: There is no study that proves such methods can prevent black fungus.

People of all sections are expecting some relief during the recession and pandemic, but the government is recovering every penny possible from them, he said.""The government, which has already collected huge taxes from the public, has now turned to poor farmers who raise cattle to supplement their income.

(Express File)The Haryana State Co-operative Supply and Marketing Federation Limited (HAFED) has said that it will not distribute mustard oil and salt to AAY and BPL beneficiaries from this month onwards. Saying that farmers have sold their mustard yield to private players and salt could not be procured due to Covid-19 lockdown, HAFED has discontinued the two items.So, the state government has decided to deposit Rs 250 directly into the bank accounts of Antyodaya Anna Yojana (AAY) and Below Poverty Line (BPL) families, it said.It is to inform the general public that HAFED has been unable to procure mustard oil as farmers have sold their produce at a high rate of about Rs 6,500 to Rs 7,000 per quintal in the open market. Because of this ration depots will be unable to distribute oil to the beneficiaries, a HAFED spokesman said, Friday.He added, In this context, it has been decided by the state government that from June-2021, the subsidy (to the tune of Rs 250/- per 2 litre) on mustard oil to be given to the beneficiaries will be directly deposited in their bank accounts. This will benefit a total of 11,40,748 families. This will continue till mustard is available with HAFED. The government is making continuous efforts to ensure the availability of mustard.Meanwhile, beneficiaries are informed that the supplier of salt has been unable to arrange 1 kg packs due to the lockdown. Thus, salt will also not be distributed this month. It is known to the general public that no subsidy is provided on salt as it is purchased in bulk by the government and distributed to the beneficiaries at low prices. Since, the supply of salt is done through a supplier appointed by Confed, so as soon as packs of 1 kg salt is available, its distribution will be resumed. Haryana Food, Civil Supplies and Consumer Affairs Department is committed to safeguard the interests of consumers, the spokesman added.It was in April, 2018 when chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar had announced that the quantity of mustard oil being provided to BPL and AAY families be enhanced from 1 to 2 litres. That time, Khattar had also directed HAFED to increase the procurement of mustard in the state and evolve an effective system for the trading of mustard oil in national and international markets.He had also added that surplus mustard oil available after selling the same at HAFED outlets and providing to BPL as well as AAY families, should be sold in the national and international markets.",MUSTARD OIL

In the 1980s, Hema's husbands business brought the family to Delhi. She packed a trove of Chettinad recipes and moved North with her husband and three young children.Her daughter, Anjali, recalls that growing up, her friends couldn't get enough of Hema's South Indian fare. ""The idlis and sambar served at home weren't the cookie-cutter stuff available at Delhi restaurants then. The flavours were intense. Eating our food was guaranteed to transport you all the way South,"" says Anjali.In 2016, she and her mother launched Hema's South Indian at Greater Kailash II in Delhi. Hema is the culinary creative brain, while Anjali is the taster and marketing maven, who also designs recipes and menus, and cooks with her mother.They conducted workshops in their kitchen, teaching clients the basics of Chettinad cooking. Enamoured by the exotic and unfamiliar tastes, Delhis ladies who lunched spread the word. Hema started retailing authentic batter, unlike the packaged variety on sale on supermarket shelves.Soon, the Gupta ladies expanded their scale of operations by selling the food they cooked, setting up stalls at popular weekly markets and fairs, and catering for small parties.Now Hemas South Indian is a byword for Chettinad food in Delhi. In 2020, the lockdown forced Hemas epicurean enterprise to shut shop, but the regulars didnt give up. Says Anjali, ""The pandemic was a game-changer. We sold everything from batter to customised food. Before we knew it, we were preparing weekly menus and doing zonal deliveries on specified days across Delhi-NCR.""A client even sends his driver once a week, all the way from Hisar in Haryana to the Gurgaon border, where a delivery guy waits for him with his orders. The Indian gastronomic trend of the noughties was modernising traditional recipes, which has not stopped avant-garde chefs from experimenting until now.Anjali's contributions were the Gunpowder Prawns, Chettinad Mutton Chops and Filter Coffee Pana Cotta prepared with the freshest ingredients. She added non-vegetarian and spicy variants of Hema's traditional dishes to the menu, since she had her finger on Delhi's belly.Despite being head-chef, Hema has never tasted meat. Yet, she intuitively knows what meat is best suited to which curry or powder mix. ""After the curry base is ready, I taste it and advise Anjali on what kind of meat will go best with it,"" shares Hema.Though their extensive menu changes on a weekly basis, the popular dishes remain the same - Mutton Pepper Masala, Crab Sukka, and Malabari Fish Curry are the non-vegetarian options. The high-selling vegetarian dishes include Tangy Pineapple Curry, Jackfruit Chettinad Gravy, soft fluffy idlis with home-made podi, appams, neer dosa, idiyappams, and Malabar parottas. For dessert it is Filter Coffee Panna Cotta or Black Rice Pudding.After the second wave of COVID-19, the team at Hema's South Indian noticed a demand for healthier food options. People were choosing nourishment over fulfilment. The menu was modified by adding new dishes that took the change into consideration.Most appreciated are the prawns cooked in coconut broth without chillies, and appams made with ragi millet. This recent surge in popularity has led mother and daughter to open their first professional kitchen in Shahpur Jat.

However, with a health-conscious wave looming, millets are finding their permanent residence in kitchens across Tamil Nadu. While some triumphed early on after trials, testing and tasting, others like the barnyard millet or kuthiraivali, scientifically Echinochloa Frumentacea, are now inching their way into peoples diets. .Nutritionally superior to all other millets and cereals, barnyard millet is the wealthiest reserve of fibre and minerals in the food group. Barnyard is the healthiest option of the millets. Low in calories and high in fibre, protein and minerals, replacing merely one meal of other cereals with it can be extremely beneficial. It is also a good choice for those beginning a millet-inclusive diet, says Dr PV Lakshmi, chief dietician at Gleneagles Global Health City.Popularly grown in the Himalayas, barnyard is an important crop to hills and tribal agriculture. It is also grown on a smaller scale in Tamil Nadu, Uttarakhand, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Maharashtra, and Madhya Pradesh. Globally, India is the largest producer of this millet. A fast-growing crop that isresistant to adverse weather conditions, barnyard is a great choice for sustenance farmers and as an alternate crop to replace failed monsoon harvests. The green stems and leaves grow up to 50-95 cm in height and are ready to harvest in merely 45 days.Once harvested, they are threshed by trampling, by bullocks, to produce the nutritional grains we receive. You can make kuthiraivali upma, pongal, dosa, kesari or even try some snacks like murukku and tikki, mentions Dr Lakshmi. Labelled the superior millet, one has to assume it has health benefits aplenty. Dr Lakshmi shares some prominent pros of consuming barnyard millet.Rich reserve of ironJust one meal of barnyard millet can satiate 50 per cent of your daily iron requirements. The low reserve of calcium prevents interference in the absorption of iron and thus, it is the ideal choice in the food group for iron requirements. Hot tip: garnish your food containing the millet with some lemon juice to give even better absorption.Perfect fit for anaemic needsAnaemia refers to a condition indicating a low count of red blood cells or haemoglobin in a patient. With its high dose of iron, barnyard millet is a preventer. It is often prescribed liberally to anaemic patients.An abundant supply of fibreThe ample fibre content in barnyard millet works to the benefit of the human body in several ways  it can prevent a few types of cancer, particularly colon; it relieves constipation; provides satiety or fullness of the stomach, aiding in weight reduction. Furthermore, the presence of amylase, a starch-digesting enzyme, improves digestion.Gluten-free nourishmentLike other millets, barnyard is also free of gluten and can be easily adopted by those who are gluten-intolerant or following gluten-restricted diets.Cuts down cholesterolThose who are looking to reduce their cholesterol can greatly benefit from adding a portion of barnyard to their diet. The low-fat content in the millet absorbs and reduces cholesterol and fat absorption.Prevents cardiovascular diseasesWhile the millet has low-fat content, the presence of fatty acids such as linoleic acid, palmitic acid, and oleic acids are good for the prevention of cardiovascular diseases.For a diabetic-friendly dietThe fatty acids in barnyard millet, coupled with a moderate glycemic index, also cater to the needs of those with diabetes.NUTRITIONAL BREAKDOWN(per 100 g)Energy: 307 kcalProtein: 8.2 g, Fat: 2.2 gCarbohydrates: 65.6 gFibre: 12.5 g, Minerals: 4.4 gCalcium: 23.2 mg, Phosphorus: 280 mgIron: 10-15 mg, Vitamin B1: 0.4 mgVitamin B2: 0.1 mgNiacin (Vitamin B3): 4.2 mgSource: Dr PV Lakshmi,Gleneagles Global Health CityBarnyard millet pudina rice(by cookbook author Krishnakumari Jayakumaar)INGREDIENTSBarnyard millet: 1 cupPudina (Mint):  bunchGreen chillies: 3-4 piecesRed chillies: 2 piecesLemon: 1 pieceMustard seeds: 1 tspUrad Dal: 1 tspChana Dal: 1 tspCurry leaves: 1-2Water: 3  cupsGinger, PeanutsSalt to tastePREPARATIONSoak the millets in one cup of water for five hours at least.Grind together pudina leaves, green chillies, a small piece of ginger, juice of half a lemon and salt to create a chutney.METHODCook the soaked millet in 2  cups of water.To a pan of hot oil, add and saute mustard seeds, urad dal, chana dal, a few peanuts, curry leaves, and red chillies.Pour in your pudina chutney to the same pan and reduce the chutney quantity till the water has evaporated.Once it is reduced, add the cooked millet and salt and mix gently on a slow flame.Take the pan off the heat after 3-4 minutes of cooking.Serve hot and enjoy!",MUSTARD OIL

(Representational Image)THE FOOD Safety Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) has banned blending of mustard oil with any other oil. Blending of edible oils was first permitted by the Indian government in the 1990s. After the outbreak of dropsy (due to adulteration of mustard oil) in the late 1990s, the government pushed for blending mustard oil with other edible oils.Experts see the FSSAIs decision as a big opportunity for mustard growers in India and replacing traditional rapeseed-mustard oil varieties with Canola rapeseed-mustard to provide a healthy oil for human consumption and decrease Indias dependence on oil import.VIRENDER SARDANA, principal agronomist and in-charge, oilseeds section, department of plant breeding and genetics, Punjab Agriculture University (PAU), Ludhiana, speaks to ANJU AGNIHOTRI CHABA on what makes canola rapeseed-mustard oil the healthiest oil for human consumption.What are the benefits of vegetable oils?Daily intake of a certain minimum amount of fats is necessary for physical and mental well-being. The nutritional guidelines of Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO), World Health Organization (WHO) suggest consumption of 30g of visible (vegetable oil or animal fat) and invisible (obtained from cereals, millets, pulses, vegetables etc.) fat per person per day.One gram of vegetable oils provides 9 kcal (kilocalories) energy compared to 4 kcal energy obtained from one gram of cereals or legumes.These fats are also carriers of fat soluble vitamins such as A, D, E and K to various parts of the body. These vegetable oils are also primary sources of antioxidants (tocopherols) and phytosterol and suppliers of several minerals such as calcium, magnesium, potassium.Soybean, rapeseed-mustard, groundnut, sunflower, sesame/til, safflower and niger crops are the primary sources of edible oils. Oil extracted from rice bran, corn or maize, cottonseed and from several tree borne oilseed (TBO) crops such as coconut, palm and olive is also used for edible purposes, directly or after blending with traditional edible oils.What are the quality parameters of edible oils?Quality of any oil is determined by its fatty acid composition, which differs from oil to oil. There are three types of fatty acids in any oil including saturated fatty acids (SFAs), mono-unsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs).The PUFAs are also known as essential fatty acids. The proportion of SFAs in plant-derived oils is generally low, except in coconut oil and palm oil. Higher consumption of SFAs is known to increase low density lipoprotein (LDL), bad cholesterol, which is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular diseases.WHO recommends that the total consumption of saturated fats should be less than 10 per cent of total energy intake. The MUFA acts as a cholesterol scavenger and generates high density lipoprotein (HDL/good cholesterol). The PUFAs are known to reduce blood cholesterol, especially the harmful LDL and elevate HDL, which plays a role in transporting excess blood cholesterol back to the liver for degradation and excretion.Vegetable oils are the main source of PUFAs such as omega 6 and omega 3. However, an oil rich in PUFAs is unstable at very high temperature and gets converted into trans fats and therefore is not recommended for cooking or frying. The intake of trans-fats should not be more than 1 per cent of total energy intake. Generally speaking, however, good quality oil should be taken in moderation only.What is the ideal edible oil?An ideal cooking oil is one that contains healthy fats and nutrients, and does not break down on heating.Which oil meets this quality?Among various sources of vegetable oils, rapeseed-mustard oil is used mainly for cooking and frying as it meets most of the characteristics sought in dietary fats and oils. It has a high smoke point (240-250 degrees celcius), is low in saturated fatty acids (less than 10 per cent) and contains a relatively balanced proportion of essential fatty acids such as omega 6 and omega 3.This is in contrast to very high levels of saturated fatty acids in coconut (91 per cent), palm (51 per cent) oils, groundnut, soybean, corn and cottonseed oils (15 per cent). Rapeseed-mustard oil contains about 20-35 per cent PUFAs which are higher than those present in olive, coconut, palm or corn oils (usually 10 per cent or less). Sesame, niger, soybean, sunflower, safflower, corn and cottonseed oils contain 45-70 per cent PUFA. Rapeseed-mustard oil has a better ratio of Omega 3 to Omega 6 (1:2) as compared to soybean oil (1:8).A balanced proportion of omega 6 to Omega 3 is effective in reducing the risk of heart diseases. Rapeseed-mustard oil is also a rich source of plant sterols and vitamin E, which protects the body from cardiovascular diseases and contains higher levels of plant sterols and Vitamin E than soybean, and corn oil. It contains higher plant sterols than sunflowers, which are rich sources of Vitamin E.Meanwhile, rapeseed-mustard is a group of crops which includes Indian mustard/raya/laha, Indian rapeseed/toria, yellow sarson, brown sarson, oilseed rape/gobhi sarson and Ethiopian mustard/African sarson and taramira which are used as edible oil. Black mustard/Banarasi rai (mainly used as condiment in preparation of pickles etc.) and cauliflower/cabbage/broccoli are also members of the rapeseed-mustard family.Is rapeseed-mustard oil the best for consumption then?Not really, because rapeseed-mustard oil derived from conventional (traditional) varieties contains a high proportion (40-50 per cent) of erucic fatty acid (monounsaturated fatty acids) and low proportion of omega 9. Regular consumption of oil with more than 20 per cent erucic acid in the diet can cause thickening of arteries, which may lead to diseases like myocardial fibrosis in adults and lipidosis in children.Can erucic acid be reduced from rapeseed-mustard oil?Need to lower harmful erucic acid in oil has led to the development of low erucic acid varieties in rapeseed-mustard crops. Rapeseed-mustard varieties with low erucic (less than 2 per cent) or zero erucic have been termed as canola varieties.The term canola, which literally means Canadian oil, low acid was coined in Canada by the Western Canadian Oilseeds Crushers Association, where the first such variety was developed.Decrease in erucic acid in canola oil is also associated with corresponding increase in nutritionally desirable MUFA. Canola rapeseed-mustard oil contains higher levels (upto 67 per cent) of Omega 9 than conventional rapeseed-mustard.Other commonly used edible oils as olive oil contain (about 70-75 per cent) Omega 9, groundnut (50 per cent), rice bran, corn, cottonseed, palm, safflower, soybean, sesame and sunflower (less than 50 per cent), coconut oil (8 per cent). Canola oil makes it even better than olive oil which although contains highest proportion of omega 9 but also has higher amounts of SFAs (15 per cent) and much lower Omega-6 (8-10 per cent) and negligible amount of Omega -3 (1-3 per cent) as compared to canola oil which contains 7-8 per cent, 18-22, 8-12, respectively.Oils from groundnut, soybean, corn, sunflower, sesame, niger and safflower contain higher proportion (32-75 per cent) of omega 6, but higher proportion of PUFA makes the oil unstable at higher temperatures and potentially more prone to the production of trans-fats.Going by all these comparable qualities with other oils, Canola rapeseed-mustard oil is now a preferred cooking oil and is the most soughtafter across the world. Nutrition studies have shown that the unique fatty acid profile of canola helps mitigate factors associated with coronary heart disease including high blood cholesterol and thrombosis.In advanced countries including the USA, Canada, Europe, Japan, Australia, New Zealand etc., rapeseed-mustard conforming to canola norms can only be used as edible oil and oil from non-canola varieties is used for energy production (biofuel) or industrial purposes. They do not allow consumption of rapeseed-mustard oil with more than 2 per cent erucic acid.Canola quality rapeseed-mustard cultivars make the meal much safer for dairy animals and poultry where it is used as a preferred source of protein.What is the status of canola cultivation in India?Canola varieties are being grown in various parts of the country. In Punjab, farmers are by and large cultivating only canola quality rapeseed-mustard (mainly gobhi sarson). Canola varieties are also being grown in Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Rajasthan. But traditional varieties are also grown in large areas.PAU has developed and released three varieties  GSC 5 (2004), GSC 6 (2007) and GSC 7 (2014) and one hybrid PGSH 1707 (2020)  of canola quality (double low) gobhi sarson for commercial cultivation. PAU also released a canola variety RLC 3 (2015) and a hybrid RCH 1 (2019) of canola raya. Besides these, one hybrid of canola gobhi sarson developed by a private sector company has also been recommended for cultivation in the state.The ICAR  Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI), New Delhi, has also developed one canola quality variety PDZ 1 of raya (2015).In the past PAU and ICAR IARI have also developed a number of low erucic acid varieties of raya namely RLC 1 and RLC 2 (by PAU) and Pusa Krishma, Pusa Mustard 21, Pusa Mustard 22, Pusa Mustard 24, Pusa Mustard 28, Pusa Mustard 29, Pusa Mustard 30 and Pusa Mustard 32 (by ICAR IARI). Cultivation of these varieties is becoming popular in different mustard growing areas of the country.",MUSTARD OIL

However, I will admit that it had a lot to do with the fact that, after a string of epic fails with everyday lunches, I turned to baking under the impression that baked dinners would make for at least one decent meal per day.I do remember that my first attempt turned out fairly well, and souffl philistines that my husband and I were, how much it rose was the exact amount of rise we expected, and since we loved eggs, this was a light and satisfying dinner. Soon it became cheese souffl for dinner one night every week.My souffl-making started in the pre-Internet days, so my go-to recipe was one culled from a 1966 issue of my grandmothers stash of Woman & Home. I read the recipe, more than a bit surprised at how easy it seemed. Apparently, all one needed was some white flour, butter, eggs, cheese and milk... and some wrist game to beat the eggs to frothy perfection. In 1966, apparently manual exertion was what made for light-as-air souffls. In time, the kid was an enthusiastic, if slightly ineffectual, egg-beater when she was home for the holidays. Later on in life, the husband eschewed the egg-beater in order to go at the mixture manually, with delicious results.Flavours galoreNecessity being the mother of invention and all that, I soon turned to my masala shelves to desify the flavour of my souffl. Voila! A touch of cracked pepper, a pinch of chilli powder, finely minced garlic, all wonderfully amplified the basic flavour.As time went by, I grew more daring in my experiments. Id grate onion and add it to the mix. Paprika and mustard became regular features, as did julienned mushrooms, bits of salmon, ham, bacon. Once in a while, though, Id overplay my hand. Like the time I diced coloured bell peppers, cauliflower and cooked potatoes, and put it into the souffl. Or the time I sliced sausage bits into it; another time I slid sliced sweet potato bits into the mix. These souffls rose but not too high, were definitely not light as air, and though the end result was delectable, any old-fashioned professional chef, fictional or real, from Bertie Woosters aunt Dahlias cook Anatole to Auguste Escoffier would have immediately castigated me for passing off a Spanish omelette as a souffl.Just eggs and cheeseThen there are individuals and establishments aplenty who make fruit souffls but that offends the purist in me. If a souffl doesnt have eggs and cheese in it, it simply is not a souffl, so say I. As for souffls made with coffee liqueurs, chocolate or Grand Marnier, lets call them by their right names, shall we? They are custards. Or mousses.Reading up on this dish, I found that the perfect souffl was a work of art, involving a judicial balance between air and moisture, using a bain-marie, pre-chilling the mixture, and so on. I also gleaned several useful facts. That a souffl rose to wonderful heights only if it involved the use of many eggs and was a smoother than silk mixture. That a spoonful of cream along with the milk made for an uber-binder. That it was best eaten hot, not after it had fallen in on itself and become some sort of an egg casserole; this collapse is often because the dish is baked to a dry consistency, so a jiggle test comes in handy here. That a few cheeses did nothing for the dish, being stringy or bland, while most others gave it a sublime flavour. That the external browning did not always correspond to a fully cooked interior. That all your efforts will come to naught if you dont have a ceramic souffl dish or ramekin with sides high enough to encourage the souffl to reach for the sky. That there shouldnt be even a smidgen of yolk in the egg white mix. That the egg whites have to be beaten to a just-so consistency: not too wet, not too stiff. That all your efforts will (again) come to naught if you open the oven door while the souffl is baking inside.Better versionSome years ago, a group of us dined at Le Voltaire restaurant on the Left Bank in Paris. I ordered an onion soup (another dish which I make often at home) and a cheese souffl. Behaving rather typically, our group was soon tasting each others food. The French onion soup was far better than my version. The souffl was excellent, literally melting in the mouth, the cheese leaving a lingering aftertaste.Everyone had a forkful of the souffl. Then everyone turned to me as one and said, I dont know what it is but I much prefer your souffls. More chatpata.It was hard not to feel smug, that much I will tell you.SUNDAY RECIPECheese souffl(from the cult cookbook Larousse Gastronomique)Ingredients40 gms butter, plus extra for greasing 40 gms flour2 decilitres or 1 cup cold milk4-5 large eggs75-90 gms cup finely grated Gruyere cheese60 gms finely grated Parmesan cheesePinch of saltPepperGrated nutmegMethod1.

Chowdhury also presented this dish the traditional way, with side dishes of a home-style aloo mash and sardines fry.  Naturally, netizens in the region went wild with appreciation for Chowdhurys home-pride move.  Panta bhaat, also known as poita bhaat or pakhala bhaat, is nothing but leftover rice that has been fermented overnight. What makes this dish a favourite is the wide range of side dishes that can accompany it, varying according to the season.  Read More | Panta bhaat: What makes a dish of leftover rice soaked in water so special?  In Odisha, a favourite side dish with the pakhala bhaat is a batter-fried pumpkin flower, apart from potato mash and fish fry. In Bengali homes, panta bhaat is always accompanied by fried fish or potatoes. In Assam, the favourite accompaniment with poita bhaat is the aloo pitika (potato mash), roasted brinjal mash, roasted jackfruit seed mash and fried fish. Stir-fried tender pumpkin creepers are another popular accompaniment.  Those who love that extra tang in their bowl of fermented rice add a dash of lemon to it. Panta bhaat lovers will also agree that the best flavour from the bowl of fermented rice comes only after the mushy rice and water have been mixed well by hand before eating. A dash of mustard oil, salt, green chillies and finely-chopped onions can heighten the flavour.  The best panta bhaat has rice that is starchy and non-fragrant.

The fever was soon gone but not the shock I felt on learning its secret ingredient  Memories of childhood are intrinsically linked with food for most of us. Just a whiff or a mere mention of a favourite dish can transport us to a bygone place and time. One such dish that holds sway over me is the humble yet potent rasam.  The soup-like broth with the tanginess of tamarind, tartness of tomato, sweetness of jaggery and wholesomeness of dal, along with the spice hit from homemade rasam powder, is always a winner. Though there are variations aplenty  with or without garlic, with lemon, and so on  my favourite has always been my mothers heady, red-hued broth. So, imagine my surprise when, one day, I was offered rasam like I had never known it before  without tomato, tamarind or even rasam powder, and it looked yellow.  I still remember that day vividly. I must have been around 10 years old, and was feeling a bit under the weather. My mother brought me the yellow concoction as a home remedy. I was flustered and took a tentative sip. While it tasted nothing like the usual rasam, I took an instant liking to it. I was, however, quite taken aback to learn that one of its ingredients was milk!  Family tradition  Mother explained that this rasam was called menasina saaru, and that it was something she had seen her mother and grandmother make several times. It was extolled for its medicinal benefits and was much sought after whenever family members suffered from a fever, cough or cold. Since it contains pepper, known for its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, menasina saaru calms the body, my mother said. And sure enough, my fever quickly subsided that day, I recall.  As life moved on and over-the-counter drugs took the place of everyday home cures, we forgot about menasina saaru. However, when my sister had her first child, it made an appearance again. It is excellent for postnatal mothers, said my mother, helping to keep the body warm. It was also a great way to increase immunity, she said, with the benefits being passed on from the breastfeeding mother to her newborn.  Photo: Getty Images/ iStock  Holistic wellness  But it was not until last year, when COVID-19 hit and we were all looking for traditional ways to build immunity, that I truly came to appreciate menasina saaru. While it has many ingredients that are great for holistic wellness, what drew me to the dish was its simplicity and lack of fuss  no fancy ingredients thatll make you run to your supermarket (or your smartphone). After all, now was the time to go back to the basics.  And so, I learnt the recipe from my mother and happily made it from scratch. The fact that it was well-received by all at home was an added bonus. The Indian kitchen has so many secrets waiting to be rediscovered that I feel like I have only begun scratching at the surface. More importantly, my experience reiterates that mother, and grandmother, are always right.  SUNDAY RECIPE  Menasina Saaru  Ingredients  1 tbsp black peppercorn  2 tbsp urad dal  2 tbsp rice  4 tbsp dried coconut (copra)  2-3 cups water  1 tsp turmeric powder  Salt, to taste  1/2 cup milk  1/2 tsp ghee  1 tsp mustard seed  1 tsp jeera/ cumin seeds  1/2 tsp asafoetida  1 sprig curry leaf  Method  1) On a medium flame, dry roast urad dal, black peppercorn, rice and copra separately until lightly browned. Cool and grind together coarsely.  2) Boil 2-3 cups of water (depending on how thick or thin you like your rasam) in a pot or saucepan. Add the ground mix, turmeric and salt and mix well. Once it boils, turn off the gas and add milk.  3) For the tempering, heat ghee, add mustard and cumin seeds, asafoetida and curry leaves. Let splutter and pour over the rasam.

From a little kitchen at Chennais Alliance Franaise, blanketed in the scent of vanilla, he whipped together light, fluffy cakes the old fashioned way: with butter, flour and muscle power.  When the pandemic hit in March 2020, and business abruptly stalled, he found himself at home for the first time in decades, with nothing to do. Then, the taciturn baker, who had exchanged nothing more than nods with many students over two decades, suddenly found  to his surprise  that he was a local legend. His number circulated on Whatsapp, and the orders began again. This time, he is baking from home in Royapettah.  My cooking was never really commercial, as there were a small group of regulars: students, as well as the actors who came to Alliance for rehearsals, he says, adding with a chuckle that most of them were fuelled by his signature lemon tea. That used to be my biggest selling point. People are still messaging me to order it.  When he began to run the canteen, Yousuf says he taught himself to cook. It was all survival instincts. I was working with McRennett, and I took a gamble to run my own show. To sustain business, I kept learning new recipes from everywhere.  His menu is short but includes his greatest cafe hits: dark chocolate cake, quiches with buttery pastry bases and spicy chicken cutlets. He also makes family style servings of creamy butter chicken, pepper mutton and an old school Chennai style biryani, if you want something more substantial.  Everything is made by me, from scratch, with no short cuts, says Yousuf, adding that he focusses on quality ingredients and precise techniques to maximise flavour. Business is unpredictable, so he is quick to adapt. Suddenly someone will share my number on Facebook or a Whatsapp group, and I will get a rush of orders, he says. Then, some weeks are quiet. But thats OK. I was 21 when I joined Alliance, and now I am 45. The students treated me like family, and it is nice to be able to still cook for them.  Message Yousuf on 9840082252 to order  Ranna Mashis kitchen  Mutton curry is an unexpected addition to the parasailing, rappelling, camping and scuba-diving offerings of Adventure Zone. Unexpected, but very welcome.  The sprawling property and campsite, popular for corporate training programmes and city getaways, recently started offering a comforting, typically Bengali Sunday lunch.  In a refreshing no frill format, instead of expending energy on a gush of Instagram reels and influencers, this Sunday popup is expanding slowly, the old-fashioned way. For the past four weeks, they have been cooking first for friends, then as word spread, for friends of friends, slowly expanding their reach.  Major SR Roy, who runs Adventure Zone, says he chose to launch Ranna Mashis to showcase the skills of his talented Bengali cook. He used to run a fast food restaurant in Kolkata, serving kati rolls, chops, chicken curry and that typical Bengali biryani, says Major Roy, adding that they source ingredients, from the mustard oil to the spices, from Kolkata to ensure an authenticity of flavour.  Adventure Zone has always had a kitchen, with cosmopolitan food, says Major Roy, adding, We curate it from an activity point of view, keeping it light since people are outdoors rappelling, diving, canoeing etc.  Once COVID-19 struck, the venue fell silent. Over night we went from catering to 650 visitors to absolutely 0, says Major Roy. As restrictions ease, though locals are beginning to trickle back in, he decided it was time to find ways to get busy again.  I have a kitchen. I have the infrastructure. And very good Bengali food, he says. The menu is succinct and simple, with big, homely flavours, tasting like lunch from an aunts house. There is fish, usually a river fish like Catla, and chicken or mutton curry. The typically Bengali vegetarian accompaniments include crisp slivers of fried potatoes, ridge gourd in a rich poppy seed gravy and yellow dal. Orders close on Friday evening, giving the kitchen time to get organised.  For now, they do just one meal a week. Many of our customers now order our Sunday lunch every week, chuckles Major Roy. Then, they can just close down their home kitchens and relax.  Whatsapp Major Roy on 9444384608 to order",MUSTARD OIL

Really? she exclaimed, Ordinary poita bhat?  The Melbourne-born chef of Bangladeshi origin, Kishwar Chowdhury, may not have won the recently concluded MasterChef Australia contest, but by wowing the judges with her panta bhat, she has brought into the limelight a humble dish thats consumed in several parts of India and is called by as many names. For Bengalis, its panta bhat, for Odiyas, pakhala bhat, for Malayalis, vella choru or pazham kanji, for Tamils, pazhaya soru. Chowdhury gave her own twist to this dish, presenting it as Smoked Rice Water.  But in each of its versions, the essence of the dish remains the same: leftover rice, fermented overnight in water. Its versatility lies in the way it can take on a range of accompaniments or stand on its own.  Ideal for summer  My first introduction to this dish was at the age of 10 or 11 on a hot and humid summer day. As I waited for my parents to pick me up from school, my best friend invited me for a quick snack at her home, a stones throw away. No harm, I thought and followed her. We took off our shoes at the door and as she ran in to call her mom, I noticed her grandmother slurping what looked like watery gruel from a bowl. There it was, poita bhat.  Curious, I asked my friend if we could have some of that. And I can never forget that taste. With a dash of mustard oil and lime juice, it was one of the best summer meals I have ever had. We gorged on the accompaniments too  aloo pitika (mashed potato) and bengena bhoja (eggplant fritters), which are popular side dishes served with poita bhat in Assam  and slurped our way to the end.  The next time I relished it as much was years later, when I was on an assignment in Odisha. A field worker invited me to an impromptu lunch and as we sat down to feast on an array of dishes, he pulled out a bowl of what looked like poita bhat. Pakhala bhat, he said, In the hot summer months, this is my staple meal. Needless to say, he had to forego much of his pakhala bhat as I slurped it up with green chillies, onion and lime.  Health food  Light on the stomach, cooling and nutritious, poita bhats origins are as simple as the dish. In most States where rice is a staple, soaking the leftover portion in water overnight and consuming it the next morning made sense at a time when refrigerators were not common. This ensured there was no wastage. Left to ferment overnight, the gruelly rice has a high starch content, which sustained farmers and manual labourers for a long period of time after they ate it for breakfast. As we know today, its high Vitamin B12 and probiotic content makes it good for health. Poita bhat was also easy to prepare, standing ready even before the kitchen fire was started for the days meals.

But despite this record output, as estimated by the Solvent Extractors Association of India, the country will end up importing some 133 lt, from the 155.49 lt of the 2018-19 oil year. Simply put, India imports anywhere from nearly 60 per cent to over two-thirds of its vegetable oil requirement, depending on how good the rains are, entailing an annual foreign exchange outgo of $10-11 billion. It is in this context that one must view the Narendra Modi governments new National Mission on Edible Oils-Oil Palm. The scheme aims at increasing the total area under oil palm from the current 3.5 lakh hectares (lh) to 10 lh by 2025-26. Growers would be entitled to a minimum viability price for their fresh fruit bunches (FFB) production, which is 14.3 per cent of the last five-year-average crude palm oil (CPO) price adjusted for wholesale inflation.  The focus on oil palm is not misplaced as it is a crop that can yield 20-25 tonnes of FFBs per hectare, translating into 4-5 tonnes of CPO. No other oilseed can give so much: Mustard and groundnut yields arent more than 2-3 tonne per hectare and the oil recovery from that only at 35-40 per cent. No realistic plan of reducing import dependence in edible oils  to, say, 30-40 per cent from the existing 60-70 per cent  is possible without recognising the role of oil palm. Out of Indias annual 130-150 lt vegetable oil imports, 80-90 mt is accounted for by palm oil alone.  That said, there are valid concerns over introducing oil palm in tropical rainforests or biodiversity-rich areas such as the Andaman & Nicobar Islands and the Northeast. The crop is probably better suited for states such as Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Odisha, where it can replace paddy and be grown using drip irrigation, mulching and other water-saving practices. India is anyway producing too much rice and any diversification must be welcomed. But the focus should, for now, be on states already cultivating oil palm. Farmers there have had a mixed experience with the crop that takes at least five years to grow and start yielding 20-25 tonnes of FFB/hectare. An assured viability price, protecting against fluctuations in global edible oil markets, should instil confidence among farmers in these states. Let them expand acreages first before others in more ecologically fragile regions.  This editorial first appeared in the print edition on August 28, 2021 under the title Crude fact.",MUSTARD OIL

The Removal of Licensing Requirements, Stock Limits and Movement Restrictions on Specified Foodstuffs (Amendment) Order, 2021 has been issued with immediate effect i.e. from 8th September, 2021. Future trading on Mustard Oil and Oilseeds was suspended in NCDEX w. e. f October 08, 2021, it said.  Measures like rationalisation of import duty structure, launching of a web-portal for self-disclosure of stocks held by various stakeholders etc had already been taken, it said. In a consistent effort to further cool down the domestic prices of Edible Oils, the Centre has issued the order which was shared with all States.  Under this order, the stock limit of all edible oils and oilseeds will be decided by the respective state government/Union territories administration on the basis of available stock and consumption pattern, the ministry said.  Exceptions have been provided for exporters and importers. An exporter being a refiner, miller, extractor, wholesaler or retailer or dealer, having Importer-Exporter Code Number issued by the Director General of Foreign Trade, if such exporter is able to demonstrate that the whole or part of his stock in respect of edible oils and edible oilseeds are meant for exports, according to the statement.  An importer being a refiner, miller, extractor, wholesaler or retailer or dealer, if such importer is able to demonstrate that part of his stock in respect of edible oils and edible oilseeds are sourced from imports, the statement added.  In case, the stocks held by respective legal entities are higher than the prescribed limits then they shall declare the same on the portal evegoils.nic.in/EOSP/login of Department of Food & Public Distribution and bring it to the prescribed stock limits as decided by the State/UT administration where it is conducting its business, within 30 days of the issue of such notification by the said authorities, the statement further said.  It shall be ensured by the state governments/Union territory administrations that the stock of edible oils and edible oilseeds is regularly declared and updated on the portal, it underlined.",MUSTARD OIL
469,,,,2021-10-21,https://indianexpress.com/article/india/govt-sets-up-war-room-on-movement-of-fertilisers-7584041/,"On October 17, three railway rakes carrying di-ammonium phosphate (DAP) were dispatched from Gujarats Mundra, Pipavav, and Kandla ports to Kanakpura, a station in Rajasthan catering to the mustard-growing areas of Jaipur, Tonk, Ajmer, and Sawai Madhopur districts. The permission for moving these rakes, the first two of 2,600 tonnes each and the third of 4,000 tonnes, was secured on an out of turn basis  that too, on a Sunday.  This level of minute planning and prioritisation of fertiliser movement by the Centre is happening for the first time, in response to an unprecedented shortage situation, both domestic and globally. As The Indian Express had reported, all-India stocks of DAP and muriate of potash on September 30 were less than half of a year-ago levels, even as international prices of fertilisers and inputs have surged to their highest since 2008-09.  We were earlier simply sending material based on the month-wise requirements for the season given to us by the states. (Rabi plantings start from October.) But now, we are finding out district-wise requirements and the crops where sowing is taking place. The field demand thus assessed is then sought to be addressed by mobilising rakes to those locations, said a senior official of the Department of Fertilisers (DOF).  On the ground, this means mustard and potato, which are planted in October, taking precedence over wheat. Thus, more rakes are being moved to Rajasthan and railheads such as Rewari, Khori, and Jhajjar in Haryanas mustard belt. In Uttar Pradesh too, the allocations at present are mainly to Aligarh, Mathura, Agra, Mainpuri, Etawah, Farrukhabad, Kanpur, and other rake points near the states potato- and mustard-growing tracts.  The rakes to Kanakpura were listed low in the seniority of indents. But after anticipating heavy demand from East Rajasthans mustard farmers, we sought special permission to allow them to jump the queue, the official said. The DOF is currently operating a 24/7 war room in close coordination with the Railway Board, fertiliser companies, and state agriculture departments.  The official claimed that the estimated 18.08 lakh tonnes (lt) DAP demand this month, mostly for mustard and potato, has already been met through opening stocks of 15 lt and production of 3 lt. In addition, companies have contracted about 6 lt imports, with 4.5 lt out of this reaching the ports, and 1 lt moved to consumption centres. Thus, there is no macro shortage, although the 15 lt stocks with the trade may not all be in places where DAP is immediately required.  Also Read | Fertiliser sales down on erratic monsoon rains  The DOF has assessed the DAP requirement at 17.13 lt in November, 9.48 lt in December, 5.46 lt in January, 4.06 lt in February, and 4.47 lt in March, adding up to 58.71 lt for the season. The same for complex fertilisers (containing combinations of nitrogen, phosphorous, potash and sulphur) has, likewise, been placed at 12.86 lt in October, 12.26 lt in November, 11.09 lt in December, 9.93 lt in January, 7.86 lt in February, and 6.84 lt in March, totalling 60.86 lt.  We were till October 15 moving an average of 50 rakes daily, which has since increased to 55 (30 of DAP/complexes and 25 urea). This will further go up to 60 by October-end. That is when wheat sowings would also start in Punjab, Haryana, and Madhya Pradesh, while only after mid-November in UP, the official added.  He denied that Punjab was facing a shortage of DAP: They have 1.2 lt stocks lying with retailers now. Their requirement for potato (largely grown in Jalandhar, Kapurthala, and Hoshiarpur) was already delivered in late September to early October. We have so far this month moved 35 rakes of DAP/complexes (roughly 1.5 lt) to the state and will do another 15 (45,000 tonnes) within the next one week. All this is for wheat.  Farmers apply DAP, containing 46 per cent phosphorous necessary for root establishment and growth, at the time of sowing. Urea, the most-widely consumed fertiliser having 46 per cent nitrogen content, is generally given first around three weeks after sowing when the crop is in vegetative and tillering stages.  India has some 2.8 lakh fertiliser dealers receiving supplies from 45-odd plants and 21 ports. Around 80 per cent of the material is moved by rail to 940 rake points covering an average distance of 750 km. Never before has this logistics system  reaching adequate quantities of fertiliser at the required place and time  been tested as it is being done currently. More so with Assembly elections in UP, Punjab, and Uttarakhand barely four months away.",MUSTARD OIL

He has just launched The Tangra Project, his first own restaurant, after two decades in the industry, along with business partners Vir Kotak and Anurodh Samal. The three had started Context.Eat, the parent company, earlier last year.  Located in Delhis DLF Avenue, this barely two-month-old restaurant is an ode to Kolkata, the city where Vikramjit was born and spent his formative years. Right from the second hand book shops on College Street to the river Hooghly, everything finds a representation in the restaurant, either is the form of decor or dish. This includes marble pillars that resemble stacks of books, a giant mural of a vibrant fish that finds itself sprawled across three walls, and lights on the ceiling which are reminiscent of the toony bulbs that are strung during pujas and festivals.  Working on this project brought to life a gamut of memories for Vikramjit. As we bite into a deliciously creamy haleem on toast, he recalls how he used to catch the 1 pm show with his friends at the erstwhile Chaplin Theatre, and then wait outside for a specific vendor who sold haleem. That is what he recreated.  The kosha mangsho and kochuri are what his Sundays were made up of; he would go to the butcher with his father and get the best pieces to make this household favourite. At this restaurant, Vikram has obediently followed his mothers recipe for the kosha mangsho. She came here and taught us how to prepare it and then followed it up with a video, he laughs.  The menu is a rolodex of Kolkatas iconic dishes: Chinese, Anglo Indian, Mughlai and of course Bengali. Here youll find bhetki fish wrapped with the sharp flavours of kasundi, kanch kola kofta (dumplings made of raw plantain), cholar dal, Tangra style chilli chicken and chicken cutlets so crisp that when you bite in, you hear a satisfying crunch (#ASMR). The breadcrumbs  in which the cutlets are coated  are sourced from Kolkata, as are the other raw ingredients.  Then there are the recipes that took shape in Vikrams head before finding themselves plated on elegant crockery. These include parwal guacamole: pointed gourd being cooked for 18 hours and then made into a fine paste, featuring bits of tomato and pomegranate, shining like bright jewels on a bed of green. Or spinach, roasted poppy seed in sesame sauce, a simple yet delightful combination. If you are in the mood to experiment, the menu also offers a mustard and tender coconut mousse.  The menu, Vikram says, will keep changing according to each season. Hardly a challenge, given they had to bring down the number of entries from 500 to 200.

With its sunshine yellow facade  dappled with pink bougainvillea  French style doors and courtyard bordered with white pillars, this chocolate factory and cafe mirrors the laidback charm of the former French colony. Colocal is a passion project of Sheetal Saxena and her husband Nishant Sinha. For Sheetal, a chocolate aficionado, the idea to start a bean to bar brand came to her while she was watching videos of cacao being roasted. Curiosity led her to research more on the subject and thus Colocal was born.  They are currently doing dark chocolate: 55, 66, 72 and 85%. The eventual goal is to reach 95%, says Nishant who also owns the Roastery Coffee House in Hyderabad and Kolkata. There are bonbons and truffles, and the chocolates are also blended with sea salt, nuts, caramel among others.  Also Read | Roastery Coffee House, Hyderabad review  Colocals cacao beans are sourced from Idukki in Kerala. We roast our cacao in a proper coffee roaster and that gives our chocolate a different taste, explains Nishant. He says that often there are many myths associated with chocolate.

The bistro offers sushi, galouti kebab, golgappa with pomello, dimsums (in stunning red and purple hues, using natural colour from beetroot and purple cabbage) and more. The idea here is to try an array of cuisines rather than commit to one large main course for the entire evening.  There are large plates too. The massaman curry, for instance, where the meat is cooked for 24 hours in a sous vide machine. The food represents the chefs culinary journey across London, Dubai, Maldives and Phuket, among others. The menu also lists favourites from closer home, like appams, chicken Chettinad and cone dosa.  Owned by Gurmehar, Navdeep Singh Sethi and Alekh Vardhan, Klap was born in April, but had to temporarily shut down due to the second wave of the pandemic, before reopening in June. Spread over two floors, it has a terrace offering open air dining. The terrace also has the Chefs garden that grows basil, birds eye chilli, ajwain (carom), coriander, ginger flower, lemongrass, and microgreens such as amaranth, says Gurmehar, adding that he believes in sustainability.  To that end, cucumber and tomato peels are dehydrated and served with a dash of pink salt and paprika, as nibbles at the bar.

He said branded oil makers have also revised the rates for new stock.  Prices of edible oils in domestic markets have soared in tandem with global prices  which shot up due to reduced availability following diversion for biofuel in Indonesia, Brazil and other countries.  The government has taken a number of steps to ensure consumers get relief from high prices. We are happy to share the trend from 167 centres. Edible oil prices have declined quite significantly in the range of Rs 5 and 20 per kg in the major retail markets across the country, Pandey told reporters here.  Retail palm oil price in Delhi declined by Rs 5 to Rs 133 per kg on November 3, while it fell by Rs 18 to Rs 122 per kg in Aligarh, Uttar Pradesh, by Rs 7 to Rs 125 per kg in Cuddalore, Tamil Nadu in the said period, he said.  The government monitors retail prices of six edible oils from 167 centres across the country.  In the case of mustard oil, Pandey said, we have not seen a significant reduction in prices, but the steps taken by the government including import duty rationalisation will have an impact, Pandey said.  We are going to see a southward trend in mustard oil prices too, he said, adding that ongoing sowing of mustard seed is better than last year. The area sown to mustard seed, a rabi crop, is 11 per cent better than the year-ago period, he added.  He also said that he had spoken to industry stakeholders and that they also revised the prices for new stocks. In fact, industry body SEA has advised its distributions, retailers and wholesalers to pass import duty cut to consumers even on the old stock, Pandey said.  Major players in the industry, including Adani Wilmar and Ruchi industries, have cut wholesale prices by Rs 4 -7 per litres to give relief to consumers during the festival season, a government statement said.  The other players that have reduced the wholesale prices of edible oils are Gemini Edibles and Fats India, Hyderabad, Modi Naturals, Delhi, Gokul Re-foils and Solvent, Vijay Solvex, Gokul Agro Resources and N K Proteins, it added.  While the global edible oil prices have stabilised at higher levels in the last ten days, the reduction in import duty and other steps like imposition of stock limits to curb hoarding has helped cool down domestic prices, the secretary said. Pandey said the reduction in petrol and diesel rates will also have an overarching impact on local edible oil prices as distribution cost will reduce.",MUSTARD OIL

However, the national average retail prices for cooking oils showed little change, and mustard oil, which is only produced domestically, continued to see rising prices.  International edible oil prices remain high, but have stabilised over the past week. Interventions by the Central Government along with the State Governments proactive involvement and the cut in wholesale prices by major private players have led to retail prices cooling down much more than the international market, Mr. Pandey told journalists.  Also read: Edible oil prices likely to ease by December: official  Apart from the cuts in duties and cesses, the Centre had used stock limits to help control prices of both edible oils and pulses this year, using the provisions of the Essential Commodities Act. The amendments to the Act, which were passed by Parliament last year but suspended by the Supreme Court in January due to opposition by farm unions, would not have allowed the imposition of stock limits given the current rate of price hikes.  COVID-19 a major factor  These are extraordinary times. These are not normal times. Global commodity prices are extremely high. COVID-19 is a major factor, disrupting supply chains, closing down industry. There is insufficient labour in the oil production industry in many countries. Given the extraordinary circumstances, it is right to invoke this, stated Mr. Pandey, explaining why the Government had chosen to use the same legal provisions it had sought to remove through last years amendments.  The retail prices of most major cooking oils were 35-45% higher than a year ago. However, a clear decline in prices was seen in Delhi from the beginning of the week till Diwali eve, with prices falling 5-10 a kg over the three-day period. Some smaller centres saw greater declines, such as the 18 a kg fall in palm oil in Aligarh and the 20 a kg fall in sunflower prices in Meghalaya. Nationally, the palm oil prices fell about 1.45 a kg, while soybean oil increased the same amount.  Mustard oil, which accounted for 11% of the domestic consumption basket, saw a 2.29 a kg increase in prices, although Mr. Pandey hoped that the 12-15% increase in mustard acreage this winter would cool down prices once the harvest comes in.  Free ration scheme  With regard to Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY), Mr. Pandey observed that there were no plans to extend the free ration scheme introduced as COVID-19 relief last year beyond November 30.  As the economy is also reviving and the OMSS [or open market sale scheme] is also exceptionally good, there is no proposal from the department for extension, he noted.  PMGKAY was rolled out in March 2020 as part of the first COVID-19 relief package, and has been extended twice since then. It provides five kg of free foodgrain a month to the 80 crore beneficiaries of the National Food Security Act, who are already eligible for subsidised grain.",MUSTARD OIL

The season however may spell trouble for people with heart disease as several studies suggest increase in cardiovascular events like heart attack, heart failure, arrhythmia during winter.  As the temperature drops, our body and heart have to work extra hard to maintain a healthy body temperature. This may strain our heart and increase risk of heart failure in people whose heart function is not up to the mark.  Why winter is problematic for heart patients  ""With fall in temperature, an alteration occurs in the physiology of the body to keep it warm. Low temperature tends to activate sympathetic nervous system and along with that it increases secretion of catecholamines. This in turn leads to constriction of blood vessel which thereby results in increase in heart rate, blood pressure, cholesterol levels and aggravates the blood clotting process. All these detrimental effects eventually increase the risk of heart attack,"" says Dr. Atul Mathur, Executive Director, Interventional Cardiology and Chief of Cath Lab - Fortis Escorts Heart Institute, Okhla, New Delhi.  ALSO READ: World Heart Day: Acute stress can lead to heart attack, says Dr Ashok Seth  ""Additionally, your heart has to work harder during winter to maintain a healthy body temperature. People who are already having heart problems, those who are having high blood pressures and heavy drinkers and smokers are at increased risk during cold weather,"" says Dr Charan Lanjewar, Interventional Cardiologist and Honorary Consultant at Global Hospital, Parel, Mumbai.  Other factors  Dr Mathur says there are other factors like air pollution, decrease in physical activities, emotional stress, poor dietary habits and increase incidence of viral infection during winter also that increases the risk of heart attacks and failure.  ""Those patients who suffer with poor heart function known as severe LV dysfunction are at much more higher risk in this season, because they have a tendency of fluid accumulation within the body that leads to difficulty in breathing,"" says Dr Mathur.  The season of respiratory illnesses  Winter months are also the time when various illnesses, such as the flu and pneumonia, strike. Respiratory illnesses in particular are a real stress on the heart, especially for older people. If you have pneumonia, your oxygen is low and you have to work harder to breathe, which increases heart rate. When youre sick like that, theres a lot of physiological stress, says Dr Lanjewar.  ""Various scientific studies done all over the world have shown an increased incidence of cardiovascular events during the winter season. This may be due to seasonal variations in the levels of vaso active peptides and well as physiological changes like increased cutaneous vasoconstriction. Hence patients with heart disease need to be extra careful during winter seasons,"" says Dr Naeem Hassanfatta, Consultant Cardiologist, Wockhradt Hospital.  How to keep your heart safe during winter  * Dr Mathur advises to wear warm woolen clothes, gloves, hat to keep body warm.  * Avoid excess alcohol consumption and smoking.  * Manage your stress: Engage in hobbies and physical activities like gardening or painting. Try yoga and meditation at home. Take proper sleep in night and regular breaks from work  * Regular exercise: Daily exercise for at least 30 minutes per day is important. Avoid exercising outside early in the morning in cold temperature. Opt for indoor exercises like static cycling, treadmill, yoga etc.  * Improve diet: Avoid excessive salt and sweets in your diet. Use polyunsaturated cooking oil like safflower oil, mustard oil. Increase salad and fruits in diet.  * Regular health checkup: Go for routine visit with your cardiologist and follow the advice.  * Last but not least, keep yourself positive and immediately visit to hospital in case of any emergency.  ""Patients need to make sure that they need to stick to their medication and exercise schedule. Also avoid the increased levels of pollution during winters. Heart failure patients need to be evaluated by their doctors before onset of winter to assess their fluid status,"" says Dr Hassanfatta.

There are about 15.70 lakh agricultural power connections in Rajasthan.  The State governments Energy Department has launched an exercise to assess the demand for electricity at agricultural fields during the next two months to ensure adequate supply to farmers. The rabi crops are generally sown in two phases in the State, first in October-November and later in January-February.  Additional Chief Secretary (Energy) Subodh Agarwal instructed the public sector power discoms in Jaipur, Ajmer and Jodhpur on Wednesday to make an assessment of the potential demand in the rabi season based on the average demand during the corresponding period in the last three years. The three discoms were also asked to prepare their action plan within the next three days.  The present supply of electricity for agricultural power consumers is 10,528 MW against the demand for 11,297 MW, while the demand during the rabi season is likely to soar by 790 MW. The power demand during the peak hours at present has been calculated at 13,864 MW. Discom chairman Bhaskar A. Sawant said the average demand during December last year was 10,533 MW and a roadmap would be prepared for meeting the demand this year.  Will meet challenge  Farmers sow the rabi crops of wheat, barley, gram, mustard, taramira, masoor, pea, flaxseed, sunflower, potato and black mustard during the winter season in different parts of the State.

(Representational/File)  THE SOLVENT and Extractors Association of India (SEA), the apex body of edible oil manufactures, importers and processors in the country, has requested the Centre for introduction of genetically modified oilseed crops in the country. In their pre-budget consultation with the Centre, the organisation also batted for shifting of grains to oilseeds in north India.  Currently, cotton is the only GM crop allowed for cultivation in the country. The introduction of other GM crops has been a long-standing demand from various farm bodies, but the government has not allowed field trials of any such crop.  Atul Chaturvedi, president of SEA, said that the per-acre yield of soyabean in the country is low at 800-1,000 tonnes per hectare. Whereas GM soyabean offers yield as high as 3-4 tonnes per hectare, he added.  Even if, the government continues increasing the Minimum Support Price (MSP) on a year-on-year basis, it will not translate into great gains for farmers. Technology would help in increasing farmers yields and thus increase their income, Chaturvedi said.  Opposition technology is not scientific as the country has been consuming cottonseed oil for some years now, the SEA president said. Also, the livestock industry has been using cotton seed cake as a protein supplement for years. Without better technology, India would not be able to be self-reliant in oil seeds ever, he said.  SEA has also asked for a diversion of the area under wheat cultivation in northern India for the cultivation of the mustard crop. This, would help in replenishing the water table and also help in the diversification of crops in the states of Punjab and Haryana.  Between Punjab and Haryana, around 60 lakh hectares of land is earmarked for wheat cultivation. Assuming we can shift 50 per cent of the available land for cultivating mustard in the next two to three years, through better incentives for shifting, the additionally available crop would be 60 lakh tonnes of mustard, which translates into an additional 25 lakh tonnes of additional oil, the body added.",MUSTARD OIL

486,,,,2021-12-21,https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/chandigarh/haryana-vidhan-sabha-opposition-govt-fertilizer-dap-shortage-7684055/,"Members of the Opposition on Tuesday raked up the shortage of di-ammonium phosphate (DAP) and urea fertilizers across the state during the Haryana Assemblys Winter session, and claimed that the state government was threatening to upset the plans of farmers for sowing of Rabi crops.  On Tuesday, the issue was raised by several Congress MLAs, led by Kiran Choudhry and INLDs Abhay Chautala.  However, the state government assured the House that there was no shortage of either DAP or urea fertilizer and adequate stocks were available.  The Opposition questioned the BJP-JJP government and said that the state was denying any shortage but was failing to explain away why long queues of farmers were being seen lining up to purchase the fertilizers or why the fertilizers had to be distributed to farmers through police stations.  Congress MLAs Kiran Choudhary, Shispal Singh, Mamman Khan, Bishan Lal, Aftab Ahmed, Jagbir Singh Malik, Chiranjeevi Rao, Geeta Bhukkal, and INLDs lone MLA, Abhay Singh Chautala, had given Calling Attention notice and said that panic has gripped farmers across Haryana with a severe shortage of di-ammonium phosphate (DAP), urea and other fertilizers, which are basic nutrients for Rabi crops, threatening to upset their plans for sowing of Rabi crops, especially that of wheat and mustard.  The Opposition pointed out the long queues of farmers wanting to buy DAP outside the offices of primary agriculture cooperative societies and other dealers in several districts  including Charkhi Dadri, Mahendragarh, Nuh, Rewari, Karnal, Ambala, Kurukshetra, Bhiwani, and Hisar. They also claimed that while the DAP requirement for Rabi season in Haryana was estimated at around 3 lakh metric tons, the supply so far had been only around one-third of the demand. If there is no shortage of DAP then why was it distributed through police stations. The government is lying. The fact that raids were conducted clearly indicated that black marketing is being done, Congress MLA Jagbir Singh Malik said.  Leader of Opposition, Bhupinder Singh Hooda, too, questioned the government over the hardships that the farmers were facing over the alleged shortage of fertilizers.  However, Haryana agriculture minister JP Dalal, countered the allegations and said, Till now about 6.93 lakh metric tonnes (MT) of urea, 2.82 lakh metric tonnes of DAP, more than 1 lakh tonnes of SSP, more than 41,000 metric tonnes of NPK was available, out of which 6.24 lakh metric tonnes of urea, 2.60 lakh metric tonnes of DAP, 79,000 metric tonnes of SSP, 38,661 metric tonnes of NPK have been provided to the farmers in the state. In 22 districts, 61 complaints were received, 157 show cause notices were issued, 88 licences were suspended, and 20 FIRs were registered. Besides this, 1685 teams have conducted continuous raids to curb black marketing. The consumption of DAP in the last Rabi season was 2.58 Lakh MT whereas, during the current season a quantity of 2.57 Lakh MT has been made available up to December 15, 2021, to the farmers, which was at par with last years consumption. Further, other sources of phosphatic fertilizers  like SSP and NPK  were also made available in much more quantity than last year (SSP more than two times and NPK around 5 times). Thus consumption of total phosphatic fertilizer was 3.73 lakh metric tonnes up to December 15, 2021, against 3.01 Lakh MT in the last year during the same period. Similarly, the sale of urea fertilizer was 5.88 lakh metric tonne during last year, whereas, it is 5.74 lakh metric tonne during the current Rabi season which indicates that this year the supply to the farmers is almost the same. As of today, the state has a urea stock of 55828 MT, and additionally about 50,000 MT urea fertilizer is likely to arrive in the next 4 days. The Government of India has further announced to supply about 1,25,000 MT of urea by the end of this month.  Major Rabi crops have been sown with sufficient fertilizer as required at the time of sowing. In this Rabi season, the mustard crop has been sown in a 7.6 Lakh hectare area (about 19 lakh acres) against 6.1 Lakh hectare (about 15 Lakh acre) sown last year. Likewise, wheat has been sown in 22.9 lakh hectare area (about 57 Lakh acres) against 23.3 lakh hectares (about 58 lakh acres) sown last year. This clearly indicates that the sowing of wheat and mustard crops have not been hampered adversely due to the shortage of any fertilizer, Dalal added.  Referring to the long queues of farmers at several places, Dalal said, During the purchase of fertilizer at the sale point, the queues at few places were not because of shortage or non-supply of fertilizer rather it takes some time to update the data on PoS machine (Point of Sale machine). The system asks for Aadhaar Card and thumb impression. Government of India has started IFMS (Integrated Fertilizer Monitoring System) since 2018-19 which demands sale through PoS mandatory so that real-time sale and stock data can be captured at the national level, Dalal said.",MUSTARD OIL

The ban will remain in force for a year.  Accordingly, traders will not be able to punch in any fresh futures trades on soyabean and mustard and their derivatives, crude palm oil (CPO), wheat, paddy (non-basmati ), chana and moong for one year from December 20. They will only be allowed to square off or reverse their existing positions. Sebi did not assign any reason for the suspension in its circular dated December 20.  A futures contract facilitates the purchase or sale of an underlying commodity for delivery at a later date.  NCDEX runs the countrys largest farm derivatives segment while energy and metals bourse MCX offers trading mainly on CPO as part of its much smaller agri bouquet. NCDEX will be the hardest hit by the ban as the soya complex accounted for 36% of its average daily turnover so far this fiscal year. MCX will witness only marginal impact.  Queries to NCDEX and MCX on the reasons for and impact of the ban went unanswered till press time.  Traders and an economist view the latest regulatory move as a measure to pre-empt inflationary expectations primarily in soyabean and CPO.  It looks like a proactive move to curb potential inflationary pressures in the soya complex and in CPO, said Naveen Mathur, director (commodities & currencies), Anand Rathi Share And Stock Brokers. Agreed Madan Sabnavis, chief economist, CareEdge Ratings. Growth in consumer prices of edible oils in November 21 remained high at 29.7% against 17.9% in the corresponding month of the previous year. Inflation of the other domestically produced items remains mostly under control. Given that chana and mustard were banned earlier, the (RBI and governments) point of concern seems to be edible oils.  Food and beverages have a 45.86% weight in the CPI, whose price growth has slowed to 4.9% this November from 6.9% in the same month last year. Analysts feel the government and regulators might not want to leave anything to chance in an environment where inflationary expectations could scuttle the recent recovery in an economy ravaged by the pandemic.

490,,,,2021-12-23,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/explained-why-sebi-suspended-futures-trading-in-agri-products/article38003931.ece,"Objective is to rein in prices of essential commodities  The story so far: Securities & Exchange Board of India (SEBI) on Monday issued directions to stock exchanges in the commodity derivatives segment for immediately suspending trading in derivative contracts in key farm commodities, namely paddy (non-basmati), wheat, chana, mustard seeds and its derivatives, soya bean and its derivatives, crude palm oil and moong for a year.  The derivative contracts in these commodities were already suspended, as per a SEBI statement on August 16 and October 8, respectively.  What are derivative contracts?  Derivative contracts are between two or more parties where the derivative value is based upon an underlying asset, in this case agri commodities.  The prices of the derivatives are established by the price fluctuations of the underlying assets. Derivatives can be traded on an exchange or over the counter (OTC).  How does the system work and what are derivatives trading?  Derivatives trading takes place when traders speculate on the future price of an asset through buying or selling of derivative contracts to maximise profit, as compared to buying the underlying asset outright.  Traders also use derivatives for hedging to minimise risk against an existing position. With derivatives, traders can go short and make profit from falling asset prices. They also use derivatives to hedge against any existing long positions. The ultimate objective is to profit. This is viewed as a deterrent to bring in price discipline in the market.  What does the SEBI order mean?  No new contract will be introduced until further orders. In respect of running contracts, no new position will be allowed to be taken. Only squaring up of position has been allowed. The imports in such commodities, especially edible oils, would reduce in the short term as traders will not have a hedging platform. Hedging, which is speculative in nature, has been made difficult. This will lead to release of blocked local produce supplies into the market, which should cool the prices. Imports of commodities for speculative gains will be discouraged.  What is the objective of the suspension?  It is to rein in rising prices of essential commodities, which are fuelling inflation. India is the worlds biggest importer of vegetable oil and this measure will make it difficult for edible oil importers and traders to transact business since they use Indian exchanges to hedge their risk.  It is believed that speculators have a role in jacking up prices and this needed to be discouraged to curb inflation and support growth as the economy is recovering from COVID-19 impact.  The suspension of trading in these commodities follows a communication from the Department of Economic Affairs, which is closely monitoring price movements.  How alarming is inflation?  As per the RBI governors recent monetary policy statement, CPI inflation went up in October to 4.5% from 4.3% in September, after falling sharply between June and September. The persistence of high core inflation (i.e., CPI inflation excluding food and fuel) since June 2020 has been an area of policy concern as input cost pressures could rapidly be transmitted to retail inflation as demand strengthens.  The governors assessment is that price pressures may persist in the immediate term. He observed that supply side interventions by the Government had limited the fallout of continuing high international edible oil prices on domestic prices.  While cost-push pressures continue to impinge on core inflation, the inflation prints are likely to be somewhat higher over the rest of the year as base effects turn adverse. However, it is expected that headline inflation will peak in Q4 of 2021-22 and soften thereafter. RBI has projected CPI inflation at 5.3% for FY22.  What is being done to deal with inflation?  Besides suspension of futures trading in key farm commodities by the SEBI, the Government and RBI are resorting to multiple interventions to curb the rising inflation.  Recently, as prices of edible oil hit near record highs, the Union Government substantially reduced taxes on imports of palm, soy and sunflower oil, but the move had limited impact on combating inflation.  The Union and State Governments had also recently reduced excise duty and VAT on petrol and diesel, which was aimed at bringing down inflation by way of direct effects as well as indirect effects operating through fuel and transportation costs.",MUSTARD OIL

The prices have been reduced by Adani Wilmar (on Fortune brands), Ruchi Soya (Mahakosh, Sunrich, Ruchi Gold and Nutrella brands), Emami (Healthy & Tasty brands), Bunge (Dalda, Gagan, Chambal brands) and Gemini (Freedom sunflower oil brands), it said.  COFCO (Nutrilive brands), Frigorifico Allana (Sunny brands), Gokul Agro (Vitalife, Mahek and Zaika brands) and others have also reduced prices, it added.  ""We are happy to share that our leading members have responded proactively and reducedP on edible oils marketed by them, across the board by 10-15 per cent to provide relief to consumers during the festival season,"" Solvent Extractors Association of India (SEA) said in a statement.  With a view to providing succour to consumers, Union Food Secretary Sudhanshu Pandey had called a meeting of industry leaders a few days back and requested them to respond positively to the reduction in import duties which the government had announced, it added.  The industry body said it is hopeful the New Year would bring happier tidings for consumers with expectations of a large domestic mustard crop coupled with softening international prices in coming months.  The SEA further said that the exorbitant price increase in edible oils during the last few months on account of high international prices was unnerving domestic consumers as well as policy makers.  To rein in the prices of edible oils, the government has reduced import duties on both refined and crude edible oils several times this year.  The last reduction on import duty was done by the government on December 20 when the basic customs duty on refined palm oil was brought down to 12.5 per cent from 17.5 per cent till the end of March 2022.  To boost supplies, the government has allowed traders to import refined palm oil without licence for one more year till December 2022 and markets regulator banned launch of new derivative contracts of crude palm oil and a few other agricultural commodities.  According to the SEA, India's dependence on import of edible oils is nearly 65 per cent of the total consumption of about 22-22.5 million tonne. The country imports 13-15 million tonne to bridge the gap between demand and domestic supply.  For the last two marketing years (November to October), due to the pandemic, the imported quantity reduced to nearly 13 million tonne.",MUSTARD OIL
