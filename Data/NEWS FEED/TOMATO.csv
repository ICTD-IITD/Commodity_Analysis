To be held on February 9, 2020, the Oscars will see films like Parasite, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, Little Women, Joker and The Irishman among others fighting it out for top honours. An extravaganza of cinematic moments with celebrities stepping out in their best, the evening also sees a magnificent and elaborate culinary spread being presented to the guests.  Much like other social events, the Academy Awards too has been inspired by current social causes, a fact that is being reflected in its spread as well. A Cheatsheet article has revealed that in honour of Joaquin Phoenixs advocacy of dietary changes to reduce carbon footprint, William Morris Endeavor announced its pre-Oscars party will feature a plant-based menu.  Going by reports, it seems that the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences is going green in 2020.  The Oscar Nominees Luncheon, which was organised on January 27, featured an all-plant based menu and the academy has gone on to reveal that it will serve similar fare at Dolby Theatre prior to the show.  The post-ceremony Governors Ball will be 70 percent plant-based, 30 percent vegetarian, fish, and meat. All food will be responsibly sourced and sustainably farmed, revealed Variety.  The Academy issued a statement where they said for the past decade they have been committed to reducing carbon footprint. For the last 7 years, the Oscars show has had a zero-carbon imprint, it said.  Wolfgang Puck, who will be catering the Governors Ball, for the 26th year has also revealed that this years array of dishes will have a lot of vegan options. He told US weekly that there will be about 60 to 70 percent vegan dishes. However, the celebrated chef added that there have always been plenty of vegan options, including grilled vegetable pizza with pesto, roasted vegetables and risottos.  Vegan options at the Governors Ball   Compressed watermelon, house-made chasew ricotta with mint agave syrup   Eggplant caponata on grilled tostini   Tajin spiced popcorn and avocado tostadas with crunch cabbage and chipotle glaze   Puffed air bread, aquafaba mousse with bell pepper cavia   Root vegetable popsticker   Sweet potato tempura with mint cilantro aioli, among others   Wild mushroom Bolognese, rigatoncini pasta   Braised leeks, fennel sunchoke puree, cipollini onion, haricot verts with tomato herb pistou.

So much so, that people now celebrate their love for pizzas on Pizza Day, which falls on February 9. With bread, tomato, dairy products, and easily available meats or vegetables, pizza is now considered a wholesome meal, and Indians have fallen for it. It completes a circle of carbs, fats, proteins and vitamins in a meal. In addition to this, we as Indians share our food, be it home or when we head out to eat, so pizza is a quick and easy-to-eat item, which comes with different toppings, says Shivanth Nishkam, partner at Red Tomato, Jayanagar. For a lot of Indian parents, pizza is a great way to get children to eat veggies like broccoli in the form of toppings, adds Mani Pathak, executive chef, Fox In The Field.  Though its origin is said to be in Naples, pizzas have turned desi for Indians, thanks to twists with fusion toppings like paneer tikka, chicken tikka, paneer butter masala, to name a few. Indians mostly embrace food that is finely balanced with spice, and pizza gives you just that, says Prakash Kumar, executive chef, The Woodrose, adding that new incorporation of pizza toppings around the world include Balado Pizza (spicy chilly pizza with beef or chicken), Randang pizza (spicy beef pizza) and Tom Yum Pizza in Indonesia, and Pizza Viennese/Pizza capricciosa (mozzarella, tomato, mushroom, artichokes, cooked ham, olives, olive oil) and Four cheese pizza (Mozzeralla, stracchino, fontina and gorgonzola) in Italy.  Chef Eliyaz, Chef de Cuisine, JW Marriott Hotel Bengaluru, says sweet pizza has become quite popular in recent times. Instead of tomato sauce in the base, sauces like different vegetable purees are used. Capers, burrata, anchovies etc. are popular nowadays.As for the cheesier bit, while the most popular type of cheese used in the preparation of pizza is Mozzarella, the other varieties of cheese that have become popular are Feta, Scamorza, Provolone, Smoked Gouda, Blue cheese, Ricotta, Goat cheese and Cream cheeses. Keeping the choice of Bengalureans in mind, vegan and gluten-free options in pizzas are an emerging trend, says Yash Mathur, executive sous chef, Sheraton Grand Bangalore Hotel at Brigade Gateway. People are becoming increasingly wellness-focused and are looking for fresh and healthy options in a familiar form. We can also expect the trends of whole wheat, maize flour and millet based pizzas in the coming days, adds Kumar.",TOMATO

Wrapped in butter paper, outwardly it resembles the Arabian roll. But with subtly spiced chicken sheekh and crunchy slivers of onion neatly encased in a rumali roti, it is a burst of flavour very different from a shawarmas blandness. And thankfully, this isnt blanketed in mayonnaise!  Hotel Fanoos, opened in 1975 by the late Ajaz Husain, began as a kebab kiosk in Bengaluru and a loyal following for its kebab rolls. Over the years it found a place in the hearts of Malayalis too, whether they lived in Bengaluru, or ate at one of the outlets when they travelled there.  So, right from when this 16-seater restaurant opened its first Kerala outpost on Kaloor-Kadvanthra road, it has been packed. Dominic Tharakan, who runs the franchise, says I try to squeeze in a trip to Fanoos each time I am in Bengaluru, explaining why he chose this chain for Kochi.  A planter (rubber), who went to college in Bengaluru, Dominic decided to get into the restaurant business as diversification. Fanoos, he says, was a good choice since the food is different from what is available in the city.  The restaurants no fuss interiors are done in brown and white, and the small space cleverly manipulated so that it does not feel congested. The cooks/kitchen staff were trained in making the rolls at Bengaluru for two weeks before the launch to ensure that they got the flavours right.  Seekh kebab is made of ground meat, flavoured with spices and then barbecued, and it goes into almost everything at Fanoos. One of Dominics concerns was the quality of meat. Getting the right meat is everything, it has to be sourced carefully. Especially since the menu is meat-based, he says. So he brought a butcher from Bengaluru to whet the meat and help choose a vendor, especially for beef rather. After a four-five day recce they found two places, in Kaloor and Thoppumpady.  The menu is the same as Bengaluru Fanoos, even the spice mix (masala) is brought from there. Kebabs and rotis are made in house. The rolls, interestingly come in six sizes  regular, Jumbo, Mumbo, Rambo, Sambo and Mogambo  depending on the number of kebabs packed inside. The names were also picked by Ajaz, except Mogambo, which his sons chose. The popular rolls here are beef sheekh, beef Irani and chilli chicken roll.  While regular has a single seekh kebab, Mogambo, the largest, has six. The most popular size is Jumbo, Dominic says. With two kebabs, the meat-rumali roti ratio is just right. With these the carbohydrate-meat ratio tends to be work with the health conscious. The rolls are priced between  70 and 345.  For those looking to eat a meal of rice for lunch, Dominic has added three rice-based combinations  tomato rice-chicken curry, ghee rice-Koduva chicken curry and mutton kheema biriyani. All sourced from recipes of friends and family. The Koduva chicken curry is his mother-in-laws. With tangy tamarind and mango chutney, as the dish is served in Koduva households. The curry is simple, so is the combination. The mutton kheema biryani is a tangy affair, perhaps from the tomatoes. Unlike regular biriyani, the mutton used is mince not pieces, The mutton to rice ratio is 1:1, which makes it meaty.  Desserts are home made, by Dominics mother, and include chocolate cake and coconut burfi. The drinks on the menu are black tea (cardamom, ginger and lime), hibiscus juice and virgin Mojito, a must try.  The restaurant opens at 12.30 pm and closes at 12 am.",TOMATO

However, the horticulture department and agriculture department claimed they were unaware of any such reports of crop destruction in the district so far.  The farmers alleged that the poor weather conditions had led to crop damage in villages including Asarpur, Jogipur, Kartarpur, Nurkhedi, Budhanpur, and Basar village. They demanded the agriculture officials should make visit and assess the losses and the state government should provide them compensation. In Sanaur division, the tomato crop is sown in around around 500 acres.  Gurvinder Singh, farmer in Asarpur village, around 10 km away from Patiala, said, In our village, the tomato crop has been sown in around 100 acres and in around fifty acres the crop is completely damaged. The crop takes four months period to be harvested. We had conducted spray of pesticides on the crop to save it from any decease but the weather had damaged our crop.  Farmer Surinder Singh said that he had sown his crop in more than four acres but the same was damaged following an attack of blight decease. Around one lakh per acre is an expenditure incurred on the crop by the farmers.  Sanaur MLA HS Chandumajra visited some of these villages and demanded Girdawari for the losses farmers had faced. He said that the state government had already ignored the diversification and the tomato crop, a vegetable, was under diversification. He added that the government should pay attention immediately as the farmers here had sown tomato in hundreds of acres in this belt and compensation to the farmers be provided as soon possible.  Patiala chief agriculture officer Arvinder Singh said that matter is to be dealt by the horticulture department and agriculture department can look into the matter only if any farmer reach us with a complaint.  Deputy director horticulture Patiala, Swaran Singh Mann said, None of the farmers have visited or informed us about this and we are completely unaware about any attack or damage on the crop.

The wholesale market at Panneerselvam Park gets vegetables, fruits and flowers from various States and is purchased in bulk quantities by shopkeepers, hoteliers, educational institutions and consumers every day.  Tomatoes arrive from Talavadi and Andhra Pradesh and a box weighing 15 kg is sold for  100.  Since tomatoes do not have a shelf-life without refrigeration, only a limited quantity can be stored in the godown.  Mani Anand, a wholesaler, said that a box of fine quality tomato is sold for  100 to  120, while it is sold for  10 to  13 a kg in retail. Arrival from Talavadi is very high in the last two days leading to drop in price, he added. On an average, 6,000 to 7,500 boxes arrived in the market in the last two days, which may increase in the coming days leading to further drop in price, he said.  The 90-day crop is cultivated during the months of November - December and harvesting began in Talavadi recently. The demand is low as there are no marriages or festivals, said P.P.K.

He said that since harvesting season would continue for the next one and a half months, price of tomatoes would go up by the end of April. During summer, arrival of tomatoes from Talavadi will stop and the price of a box might reach  700 or more, he said.

Standing potato crops on 35 to 40 acres are also facing sheath blight disease in nearby Mahipani and Dhatkidihi villages.  In Nuagaon block too, crops are affected by the disease while mustard plants have come under pest attack. Tomato crops are getting rotten as they leaned on the wet ground after rain.

I had called her to clarify something about the cuisine and she is worried that vegetarian-me will return disappointed and hungry. Her fears are unfounded, I am happy to say. The spouse and I drive off to the Kashmiri food festival at Fairfield by Marriott after many calls to the Food and Beverage Manager S Bharath, seeking assurance that there will be vegetarian fare too.  We have plenty to offer, smiles the fresh-faced Chef Milap Singh Jamwal who has come all the way from Srinagar to curate this festival. The husband, who served for many many years in J&K, immediately gets into a huddle with the Dogri chef and they exchange notes about little-known towns and villages, discuss threadbare the vales and mountains and exclaim about the Jammu-Baramulla railway line. Finally, we begin to eat. The heart leaps as I recognise some of the favourites Neela has cooked for me and Raju all those years ago. There is the Haak Saag, I spot shalgam (turnip) in a pulao (brings back a rush of memories of a diet consisting almost entirely of that vegetable when we were at Leh), there is the Rajma (famous of Badharwa)...  Haak Saag | Photo Credit: Special Arrangement  A walk around the spread is enough to get the appetite up and running. Very interesting are a line of chutneys. We help ourselves to ALL of them in a quarter plate and eat them with Paneer Tikka and Nadru Churma (fried lotus stems that are a street food in Srinagar, I learn). The chutneys are made of pineapple, apple, walnut, radish, pumpkin, tomato and with a dried onion that Chef Milap has brought with him that he calls gand. We go for chutney refill and the next time around we eat them with soft garlic naan.  The chef draws my attention to something that looks like a broccoli; only it is beautiful purple in colour. It is mawal or the Kashmiri cockscomb, he explains, and it is used to add depth of flavour in several dishes.  The nicest thing about trying out a cuisine that is not too prevalent in these parts is its newness. It is also interesting how familiar ingredients too are used differently. For example the omni-present dumaloo is tempting and so distinct from the dum aloos we have eaten earlier. The secret is in our asafoeteda, I recall Neela telling me.  Just in the nick of time, after dessert, I catch sight of the Khubani Heder Shorba and I am so happy I did. A clear soup made out of the stock of apricots and mushrooms, it is light and quite delicious. The non-vegetarian alternative to that is the chicken yakhni soup. I peek into the cauldron and that looks like a clear soup too. There is mutton yakhni, fish and chicken cooked several ways, besides the famous Rogan Josh. The menu will change every day, says Bharath. Todays dessert comprises meetha chawal, phirni and oddly what seems no different from the Hyderabadi shahi tukra  all tasty. The delicately fragrant Kahwa washes down the meal.  The Kashmiri Food Festival is on till February 16 for both lunch and dinner. For reservations and more information call: 70944 46622",TOMATO

Its now a bustling food hub, full of restaurants and cafes offering all kinds of cuisines.  I went there with a group of close friends the other evening, and was stunned. The city changes before you can say paneer pasanda  and you find that a part of it has grown into some kind of a ritzy arcade.  Let me start at the beginning. Two friends wanted to take us out to dinner. They suggested a couple of places that I had not been to. One had a menu that was not very exciting, and the other didnt have parking space. I did a search and came across a few promising restaurants. One was Caf Tesu, about which I had heard good things. I suggested it to the friends, and they were happy, as they liked the food there. So we, a group of six, landed up at Essex Farms, and found it humming with life. Caf Tesu is one of the restaurants there.  We hadnt booked a table, and when we reached, we found Tesu bursting at the seams. A helpful family waiting for dessert vacated their table for us. I had a quick look at the menu. The soups include chicken cappuccino with almond flakes (265), wild mushroom bisque (245) and khao suey (415-465). Salads include goat cheese and slow poached pear (495); on the list of small plates are kaffir lime chilli cottage cheese (395), baby pork ribs (525) and chorizo and Bratwurst (495). I didnt go any further  chorizo and Bratwurst for me, I said.  The others asked for a variety of dishes  pasta with chicken, a spicy chicken pizza and a Parisian sandwich with roast chicken.  One among us was keen on a ham and brie sandwich (425), but the waiter said there was no brie. So my friend decided to have breakfast instead of dinner, and asked for French toast.  We were each very happy with the food. My dish of meats had been slow cooked in an oven and came with tomato fondue.  The chorizo was soft and spicy, and the Bratwurst was crispy. The Parisian sandwich (545) consisted of generous slices of multi-grain bread stuffed with grilled chicken tossed in red wine and served with tomato chutney and carmelised onions. The meat was juicy, and complemented the sweetness of the onions.  The spicy chicken sausage pizza (635) was delicious  with chicken heaped over a thin crust base. The friend loved her creamy pasta (575), flavoured with pine nuts. The French toast (325) was shared by everybody, and almost worked as dessert. This consisted of bread dipped in a custard batter, served with cinnamon cream.  Caf Tesu needs a revisit. I would like to try out their lamb bourguignon  prepared with brioche buns, ground lamb meat, brie cheese, caramelised onions and red wine sauce (625).  The pizza section includes classic tomato and mozzarella (535), artichoke, mushroom, olives, jalapeno, rocket leaves and parmesan shavings (625) and a fig, bacon, and blue cheese pizza (650).  I have to thank my two friends for that delightful treat, and for introducing me to Tesu. It marks the start of a meaningful  or do I mean meat-ful?  relationship.

Made of activated charcoal, which gives it this unique colour, the offering is probably a first-of-its-kind from the popular A2B chain of hotels.

Doesnt it look unique? says Mohan, eyeing the crisp, ghee roast-like dosa on his table, This is the first time Im seeing any Indian food item that is black in colour.  The concept was born when the management of A2B went through the plethora of Valentines Day offers for couples and realised that there was nothing for singles. Of course, families can try it too, smiles A2B supervisor Pranav S, adding, We have heard of burgers using charcoal, and we thought about doing something similar in our dosa.  The making of this dish is similar to that of traditional dosas  the only difference being the activated charcoal, which is mixed into the batter by the chef, resulting in the colour and flavour. There is a health benefit to this, too, claims Pranav. It helps detox the body, he says, It has been proven that activated charcoal, if had in right proportions, can have health benefits.  That is something we cannot quite guarantee, but the black dosa is certainly Instagram-worthy, and one thats likely to garner a lot of likes. Admittedly, it does leave a slightly bitter taste in the mouth. However, thanks to its crispiness and ghee overload, it leaves one satiated.  With a tangy tomato chutney on the side, this charcoal dosa could well be your date this season of love.

Winter meant stories of seasonal food, mostly of avarakkai (Hyacinth beans/ broad beans), not available in Hyderabad around the year.  The meals at home, in our nuclear family, were always simple, fuss-free, vegetarian fare. My mother focused on eating local and seasonal  a guiding principle at home. As I write this, I wonder how this is the exact food concept that has taken over the world right now  of eating seasonal foods from the region.  Family affair  Come winter, the seasonal avarakkai would make its much-awaited appearance. My mom would regale us with stories of how shelling the beans and then removing the outer skin was once a family affair. She also spoke of how the best beans were the ones that had the characteristic sogadu  aroma of the beans harvested at the right time  and how the bean made its way into almost everything from idli, dosa, upma, rice, rasam and sambhar.  One winter my father returned from Bangalore with a bag full of avarakkai. The distinctive smell of the beans in a cloth bag is something I can never forget. Excited, my parents, sister and I sat together to shell the beans; I kept looking at my fingers change colour from the oily texture of the bean pod. My mother explained that sogadu is also when the bean is at its best size and flavour and is usually harvested after a spell of rainfall. The next few days were all about avarakkai  from avarakkai saaru (rasam), a recipe that she learnt from her mother, to avarakkai uppitu (upma) and akki roti (rice rotis).  However, my favourite was the hittaku avarebele huli (sambhar made with peeled beans). When I first tasted it, I knew it was unlike the regular sambhar we had at home. This one was made using the beans cooked in ground masala and not the traditional dal.  Sweet and fried  Years later when we shifted to Bengaluru, winters meant easy access to the much-loved avarakkai as well as seeing it in many other forms including in a halwa and as a fried savoury snack. At my first newspaper job in Bengaluru, the office canteen served it with poori and it tasted exactly like what we used to eat at home.  Winter is also when the avarakkai mela takes place at Bengalurus Sajjan Rao Circle, an annual affair that sees crowds throng to sample myriad interpretations of the bean. After visiting several editions of the festival, I can say that there is something new to look forward to every year.  The bean can make its appearance even in your pani puri and gulab jamun. The versatility of this bean and the way it blends into so many dishes is really like no other. People also believe that the name of the city was inspired by the bean as it was called Bendakala Ooru (the city of baked beans) that eventually became Bengaluru. Avarakkai, for me, is a food memory that I cherish and hold close to my heart.

Before they could make sense of what had fallen a few feet away from them, their survival instincts kicked in and some of them ran for their life.  Yet, reeling under the shock, they gathered courage and went to rescue those who were caught in the vehicle. While driver Sunil (22) and four others suffered injuries, Sohail (27) died on the spot.  A large area under the RoB in Bharat Nagar is occupied by the vegetable market. Wholesalers and labourers are usually involved in brisk business from dawn. Throughout the night, lorries and auto trolleys laden with vegetables arrive.  It was a lucky escape for some labourers who were either unloading crates of vegetables from autos or taking a break on either side of the spot where the car crashed.  Lifting sacks filled with green chillies, Krishna, who was one among the labourers and a witness to the incident, said that his heart skipped upon hearing the loud crash. Folding his hands and looking up to the sky, he said they all were lucky. Another labourer Bandari Kumar said that they were sipping tea when the accident happened. Both were on night duty.  An auto trolley filled with tomatoes was waiting for an excavator to move so that it could be parked there. The car crashed on the bucket teeth of the excavator. It was a lucky escape for at least six of us since it takes at least two labourers to unload the tomato crates from the auto and four more to carry them to the market. Had the accident happened 10 minutes later, many people would have died , said Krishna. Driver of the auto Seenu said that he was sitting in the vehicle when the car came crashing down.",TOMATO

A businessman and an entrepreneur, travel has always been his choice of escape. Launching and co-founding the newest resto-bar in the city, DANK, with his close-knit gang of school friends, he talks to us about childhood friendships, his travels and finding joy in the little things in life. Excerpts follow:  What would you say is your life philosophy?  Im a simple person and dont like to make things very complicated. So, in my life, Ive tried to keep myself grounded by enjoying the little things like a conversation with loved ones over a drink and good food. Money cant buy happiness would be a suitable summary of it.  The relationship with your childhood friends is your solace outside of work. How did that come to be?  The four of us go back a long time, almost 35 years, right to our schooldays in Hospet, Karnataka. Although we lost touch after going our separate ways in high school, we reconnected a few years ago and the frequency of our meetings have only been increasing with every passing year. As clichd as it may sound, were all avid travellers and travel has been the core ingredient in reviving our childhood friendship. We try taking as many trips as possible, but we have one mandatory annual vacation that none of us misses.  Among your travels, are there any trips that truly stand out in your memory?  A couple of years ago, we took a trip to Phuket and its the one that immediately pops up in my mind. One would think that we did a whole load of activities, but for those few days, we did nothing but eat, drink and spend time with each other. If I think about it, its the same atmosphere and ambience that weve tried recreating in our new venture together  DANK resto-bar in T Nagar. DANK means awesome in one of the local Swedish tongues and its also an apt summary of our friendship.  Sreekanth Katta and Shibu Raj (right)  Coming from different business backgrounds, how did you and your friends decide to co-found a resto-bar in the city together?  The beauty of this entire process has been that were all from completely different career paths and for all of us, this is the first time being a part of the food and beverages market. Sreekanth and I are the business minds in the group and the other two cover the finance and technology portions of managing a start-up. A fantasy of brewing our own beer and having a microbrewery was the thought that set this whole process of co-founding DANK into motion. I remember texting them with a proposal, and we immediately met over the weekend and decided to take the plunge. Although the microbrewery part of it is still a distant dream, we wanted to improve the experience and ambience of a resto-bar.  Being in the restaurant business now, what is your favourite cuisine?  Im a big fan of all varieties that fall under the big umbrella that is Indian cuisine, although Im probably drawn to a fusion of south Indian and north Indian dishes. I remember visiting Kochi and snacking on pani puris filled with a tangy tomato rasam. It was the dish which convinced me that a fusion was the way to go.  Whats your beverage of choice to go with your plate of Indian-inspired fusion food?  Theres probably nothing better that I enjoy than beer. Freshly brewed wheat beer to be specific. The wheat beer in Toit in Bengaluru is an absolute delight and probably the closest you can go from Chennai to enjoy a robust home-brewed wheat beer.  Apart from food and travel, what other hobbies do you enjoy?  I used to enjoy reading but due to the lack of time, I havent picked up a book in the longest time. But sports, cricket to be exact, has been a passion since school days. Having played for the school and college teams, its something that I enjoy now as well. With the Indian Premier League coming soon, Im very hyped to see my favourite Chennai Super Kings on a winning streak again.  What would you say is a social cause that is close to your heart?  I try doing my small part in different venues in society. But being an entrepreneur, the creation of jobs has been very important to me. Over the past four years, Ive seen a lot of people lose their jobs and the economy flailing, but the one industry that Ive noticed to be immune (as a matter of fact, growing at a rate of 16-17%) is the Food and Beverage industry. So, when added to my love of food, this opportunity to create jobs was also an incentive for me to start this business.  DANK promises to deliver on food, drinks and music  R Satish Babu",TOMATO

Like everywhere in India, but especially here. Hortense Cabouret, Pernod Ricards wine ambassador is well aware of the challenges that come with trying to market alcohol, wine in particular, to a city with complicated liquor licensing.  We meet her at a wine and food pairing luncheon at Barracuda Brew, which claims to be the citys longest bar. Along with chef Mohamed Siddiq, who is serving up a rich six-course meal, she is showcasing Pernod Ricards two main wine brands: Jacobs Creek from Australia and Campo Viejo from Rioja, Spain. We are also bringing Jacobs Creek Double Barrel to Chennai in May, she informs us, It is finished in aged whisky barrels so it has more texture.  While Chennai is quite familiar with Jacobs Creek, Campo Viejo, which has been available here for two years now, is still new in the minds of the consumer, recognises Hortense. Which is why it is important for us to take the time to explain the wines to the consumers, she says.  Sniff, swirl, savour, she starts with the basics at Barracuda. Chef Siddiq, who prides himself on creating dishes that are South Indian but tweaked for the global palate, has included Brazilian beef with slow grilled peppers, and prawns baked in the pulp of passion fruit and essence of wasabi. We pair the former with Jacobs Creek Shiraz and the latter with Campo Viejo Tempranillo Blanco-viura.  Main course includes tomato rice with seer fish, and a Persian roast chicken with paprika scented rice. Both are paired with the Campo Viejo Tempranillo Red. Campo Viejo flavours are more light, explains Hortense, The red is easier to drink especially with Indian dishes. It is not so high in tannin. If there is too much tannin in your wine, you cant pair it with spicy food common to India. It will burn your mouth.  The Campo Viejo, she adds, is crafted by an all female winemaking team in Rioja, a flagship wine region in Spain. Campo Viejo pairs nicely with Southeast Asian dishes like coconut curries, and spicy dishes because it offsets the spiciness of the food.  On the other hand, we pair the Jacobs Creek Chardonnay with Chef Siddiqs mushroom and truffle soup. It is the kind of wine that will go well with creamy Indian dishes, like palak paneer and butter chicken, she says.  Explaining wines for an Indian setting has been a major part of Hortenses work here. I have noticed that people keep red wines at room temperature. That would have been fine in Europe, but here in India, especially in Tamil Nadu, that makes no sense. They have to be stored at 14 to 16 Celsius degrees max.  Hortense has been in India for five months now, observing the booming wine market. In Chennai, she has been meeting with the staff at hotels like InterContinental, Crowne Plaza, Holiday Inn, Novotel and so on, during the day, and interacting with consumers during the evenings.  Her main goal is to increase visibility, which is why Sula now being available in TASMACs does not bother her much. Yes, we are competitors but at the same time, we are from the same wine industry. If they are pushing wine consumption, it helps the whole industry, she says.",TOMATO

Inspired by south Indias distinct flavour palate that is a perfect blend of spicy and sour, the line up brings together coastal delicacies from Goa, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, alongside a few homegrown must-haves.  First on our table, was a portion of Karwari fried prawns, a Kannada delicacy where marinated tiger prawns are coated with crispy semolina and grilled to pink perfection. Served with a side of onion salad and minty curd dip, this starter is a subtle, non-spicy flavour burst that will ease you into the peculiar menu.  For Andhra seafood lovers, Chepala Pulusu is an inevitable name on their menu. The aroma of coriander leaves and slow-cooked tomatoes begin to linger in the room way before a potful of the curry is served, accompanied by white rice, vegetable salad and long strips of fried pappadam. Rohu fish is traditionally used in the Pulusu. We dont use tomato puree or powders. The gravy is slow-cooked to bring out this balance of flavours, says the Chef.  Chettinadu crab curry served with Idiyappam came as a surprise. The semi-dry gravy carries all the might of Chettinadu cookingmustard and black pepper blessing your tastebuds. Idiyappam is a Malayalai dish, right, I pondered. Well, Tamil Nadu, Sri Lanka and Kerala can claim the origin of idiyappam, says the Chennai-born, Hyderabad raised, Kerala-based chef, who has had his share of South Indian flavours. With crab meat, the struggle may be real, but the euphoria of biting into well-flavoured flesh beats all the odds. Neer dosa may not be the first thing you may expect to see at a coastal food fest, but pair it with Mangalorean Meen Gassi, and you have a deadly combination.  With chunks of kingfish floating in a thick gravy made of coconut, coriander, onion and black pepper cone, the gravy would remotely remind you of the Malabari fish curry. How many of these have you tried here before? asks the chef as we wind up the lunch session, and we replied quite honestlynone. That is the point, he laughs.

Rashmi (name changed) from Holenarasipura in Hassan district arrived in Bengaluru on Thursday night. She was locked up in a house for 14 days, restrained from using a mobile and wasn't fed. There were three other women with her. On the midnight of February 12, they broke the window panes and fled before contacting local police.  Rashmi, a diploma graduate in computer science, was jobless and her friend working in Kuwait suggested she try for a job abroad. She contacted an agency based in Chikkamagaluru which offered her a nanny's job in Qatar. After document verification, the agency demanded she pay Rs 2 lakh but she said she didn't have that kind of money.  The agency sent Rashmi on a visitor visa but told her if questioned by immigration officials, she must claim she was visiting her sister. They also gave her a return ticket.  As Rashmi was travelling abroad for the first time, she said she was ignorant about several things.  On January 12, Rashmi left Bengaluru. But as she reached Qatar, all her documents, including passport, were confiscated by the agency. Her return ticket was cancelled and she was sent to a house to work as babysitter-cum-cook for Rs 30,000. She lived with four other maids in the same house, where they were made to work for 16-18 hours a day.  ""I used to wake up around 5.30am every day and had to prepare breakfast for the employers by 6.30am. My work would end around 11pm every day. We never even got time to eat,"" Rashmi told TOI on Friday. Four days into work, Rashmi's nose started bleeding. However, the employers cared little and insisted she continue to work. After 18 days, she requested her employers that she be relieved.  The agency sent her to a house where three women were already present and locked her up with them.  ""They used to give us a glass of raw rice, an onion, tomato and potato to cook for ourselves. While we got rice every day, we had to use the vegetables for three days. We were not supposed to use mobiles or go out. Two people were monitoring us,"" she recalled.  Rashmi and the others decided to approach police but for that they needed to escape. Around 1.30am on February 12, the four women managed to break window panes and jumped out. They ran for more than a kilometre and managed to approach police, who summoned the agency and got the women to speak to their families.  Rashmi called her brother-in-law, who approached the Protector of Emigrants office in Koramangala, Bengaluru. Shubham Singh, PoE in Bengaluru, said they took up the issue with the Indian Embassy in Qatar, which immediately got in touch with Qatar police. Rashmi said, ""We were kept in prison for a couple of days and were sent to the deportation centre later.""  Meanwhile, the Indian embassy got the agency to return the women's documents. However, the agents did not pay their salaries. Two of the women were sent to Hyderabad and the third to Kerala. On Friday, Rashmi met Singh at his office, where her statement was recorded.

The portal intends to arrest volatility of prices of tomato, onion and potato. The portal can be accessed at http://miews.nafed-india.com.  The Market Intelligence and Early Warning System or MIEWS portal is a platform to monitor prices of tomato, onion and potato (TOP) and for generating alerts for intervention under the terms of the Operation Greens scheme. The portal would disseminate all relevant information related to TOP crops such as prices and arrivals, area, yield and production, imports and exports, crop calendars, crop agronomy etc. in an easy to use visual format.  As per the terms of the scheme, during a glut situation, the evacuation of surplus production from producing areas to consumption centres will be undertaken:  a) When the prices fall below preceding 3 years average market price at the time of harvest;  b) When the prices fall more than 50% compared to last years market price at the time of harvest;  c) When the prices fall less than the benchmark, if any, fixed by the state/ central government for a specified period.  Union Minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal said that the MIEWS system is designed to provide advisories to farmers to avoid cyclical production as well as an early warning in situations of gluts.  For decision makers, the MIEWS system will help in:  (i) monitoring of supply situation for timely market intervention,  (ii) assist in rapid response in times of glut to move produce from glut regions to deficit/consuming regions and  (iii) providing inputs for export/import decision making  The salient features of the MIEWS portal include (i) a dashboard that would indicate low price and high price alerts as well as price forecasts for three months forward; (ii) prices and arrivals of TOP crops across the country, including interactive charts and comparisons with previous seasons; (iii) area, yield and production of TOP crops; (iv) crop agronomy and trade profile of each of the TOP crops; and (v) regular and special reports on the market situation of the TOP crops.",TOMATO

A balancing act: Keralas popular Ajwa Biriyani chain opens its maiden Chennai outlet. How does this Thalassery variant fare against the Madras biryani we love? We find out  Biryani lover that I am, I find it hard to decide which style is best.  Madras style, made with basmati rice and high on spices, has always been my preference. I love Ambur-style biryani where red chilli paste replaces the whole green chilli, as well as subtly-spiced seeraga samba biryani. Therefore, when I visit a newly-launched eatery specialising in Malabar or Thalassery biryani, as it is popularly known, I am admittedly sceptical.  To begin with, I could not accept this plain-looking, white colour dish being called biryani (this prejudice was to be dispelled soon). For me, biryani has to be high on drama, and come with all the paraphernalia. So when Chef Razak AC took me into the kitchen of Ajwa Thalassery Dum Biryani, I was wondering where all the cooking takes place, as the kitchen was spic and span. There were huge dabaras of various sizes, and I was puzzled where that appetising aroma was emanating from, as there was no trace of any cooking.  We begin the preparation as early as 7 am. Preparing Thalassery biryani is a meticulous and time-consuming process that requires adequate planning and preparation, says Razak, who along with three of his friends opened Chennais maiden branch of Ajwa Thalassery Dum Biryani.  Three chefs from Razaks family take turns to come to Chennai to prepare the speciality dish everyday. The kaima rice variety is sourced from Bengal, and only ghee is used. The meat gravy, cooked on medium heat with sauted onions, tomato and few spices, requires no oil.  The aroma and flavour can be attributed to the kaima rice, and the three stages of slow cooking which are the most essential aspect of this style of biryani, says Razak. The most important aspect of Thalassery biryani, however, is the dum: the mutton or chicken gravy and the cooked rice are sealed and kept aside for close to three hours.  We order mutton and the fish biryani. The chef recommends spring chicken, which is made with fresh chicken weighing anywhere between 450 to 600 grams. Our biryani arrives unassumingly, topped with fried onions and served with small portions of sweet dates pickle and onion raita. Just as the dish is cooked in layers, so it is served. We cut it like a cake and plate it. You have to go right down and scoop out the rice and meat and place it on your plate, says Naushad Mohamad, one of the partners. I relished the aromatic preparation, which tasted delicious. The hours (four, says the chef) spent painstakingly preparing this biryani were worth every morsel.  The date pickle, typically served with biryani in the Malabar region, is made of dates syrup with grated beetroot, carrots and green chilli. It takes a while to get the palate used to the varied tastes of the rice, meat and pickle, and once it synchronises, you begin to relish its effect on the taste buds. The flavourful, ghee-infused preparation with a hint of masala here and there, and a splash of sweet tangy date pickle provides a satisfying meal experience. For vegetarians, there is vegetable biryani and plain aromatic ghee rice or the Kerala nei choru, along with four vegetarian side dishes such as dal fry, cauliflower fry, and paneer butter masala. Completing the meal with a hot Sulaimani is a good idea.  Thalassery biryani is all about the right amount of spices, perfect cooking of the rice and finally balancing both with perfect dum. We are informed that for dinner they also serve Malabar special items such as nei pathri, puttu and Kerala parotta. But the restaurant, with a seating capacity of 60, has nothing to write home about in terms of ambience.  So has the experience made me shift loyalties? What can I say? Thalassery biryani is an experience, but Chennai biryani is an emotion.",TOMATO

Read More  MYSURU: Farmers, who grew vegetables in abundance in Mysuru and Chamarajanagar, have suffered a setback due to lack of demand from Kerala and falling prices. Unable to bear the cost of labourers, transportation and middlemen's charges, they are forced to let their produce rot in the farms of these two districts. They are now demanding that the government provide minimum support price for their produce especially tomato, beans, brinjal and beetroot.  Tomato growers could not even recover the cost of harvest. Farmers say the price of tomatoes - usually sold for up to Rs 20 per kg - has slumped to Rs 2 per kg.  Ravi, a farmer from Nanjangud taluk, said contrary to the general practice, there is no specific rate for tomatoes now. ""There is no rate for other vegetables too in the market,"" he said.  Gundlupet taluk general secretary of Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha Mahadevappa said there was good rainfall for three months during the time of sowing. ""Farmers sowed seeds hoping for a good produce and rate. There was good yield, but the rate has fallen. During summer, people in Kerala consume more of sea food and less vegetables. But the monsoon starts in June and fishermen are not allo wed to venture into the sea to catch fish. From June, when Kerala starts to purchase more vegetables from Karnataka, then the rate will rise automatically,"" he said.  Mahadevappa demanded that the state government announce support price. ""A farmer spends nearly Rs 70,000 to grow vegetables in 1-acre land, but he is not getting even Rs 10,000. He is unable to p ay the labour cost. I have grown beetroot on 4 acres and also beans and tomatoes. But as there is no rate, I have left it in the farm itself,"" he said.  Horticulture department deputy director K Rudresh said he spoke to merchants in Kerala and was told there is no transportation of vegetables to Kerala. ""There is good yield but no buyers,"" he said.

Speaking to mediapersons in the Secretariat, he said Chief Minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy had given instructions to further increase the number of procurement centres in case of high yield to purchase foodgrains from farmers at support price.  The government had set up 109 procurement centres for black gram, 101 centres for bengal gram, 98 centres for red gram, 67 centres for green gram and 26 centres for turmeric.  The government is aware of plight of tomato growers in Chittoor, Anantapur and Kadapa due to lack of remunerative price for their produce. Steps would be taken to ensure remunerative price for tomato and onion, he said.  Civil Supplies Commissioner Kona Sasidhar said that the government set up 1,820 paddy procurement centres in the State to see that farmers do not face any hassles in selling their produce at support price.  The government has so far procured 44 lakh metric tonnes of paddy in Kharif marketing season.  The farmers are receiving spot payment in most of the case and in some cases there is a slight delay due to clearance of dues by the Centre. The matter was taken to the notice of Union Civil supplies Minister, he said.  Sasidhar said the second and third quarter funds are due to the State government. That is the reason for the delay in making payments over the past two weeks.  Chief Minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy held a high-level review meeting in this regard and directed the Civil Supplies Department to take advances from banks and Nabard to clear the dues of the farmers, he said.  Stating that the dues to farmers will be cleared by Wednesday, he said it was not fair on the part of a section of the media to blow up the issue.  He urged the farmers to call toll-free number 1902 if they face any problem in selling their paddy at the procurement centres.

(Express Photo: Arul Horizon) Farmers crowding at a cooperative bank branch in Maharashtra. (Express Photo: Arul Horizon)  Ashok Raghunath Patil has, for almost a decade now, stopped taking any peek karj (seasonal agricultural operation loans) from the Bhimrao Anna Multipurpose Cooperative Society thats right in his village. Instead, he has been borrowing  to finance cultivation of sugarcane on four acres and seasonal vegetables such as tomato and cucumber on the remaining four of his eight-acre holding at Kameri village in Sangli districts Walva taluka  from the Bank of Maharashtra. This is despite the public sector commercial bank having its branch at Islampur town, which is about 5 km from his village.  I prefer going there. The officers and staff are more professional than the people in the society here, states Patil, who has been dealing with Bank of Maharashtra since 2011. The bank advances him working capital (scale of finance) at the rate of Rs 40,000-45,000 per acre for his sugarcane crop. This loan, extended 1-2 months before plantings (which happen in June-July for the 18-month adsali and November-December for the 14-month pre-seasonal crop) and repayable over one year, attracts an annual interest of 7%.  Back in 2011, Patil was the only one in Kameri, who chose to bypass the local credit society, through which the Sangli District Central Cooperative Bank (DCCB) disburses crop loans, in favour of a scheduled commercial bank. But today, many of my relatives and friends within the village have moved to the Bank of Maharashtra, says the 60-year-old, who has also availed a Rs 3 lakh seven-year loan at 12% interest from the same bank to install a drip irrigation system for his sugarcane fields.  Patil represents a growing number of farmers in Maharashtra who no longer rely on the cooperatives, which have traditionally dominated the states rural lending landscape (especially for crop credit), for fulfilling their financial needs.  Aggressive penetration, better customer service and deployment of technologies such as mobile app by commercial banks  both public sector and private  have led to their gaining market share at the expense of cooperatives. The relative absence of politics  sanctioning of loans not being a function of proximity to directors in the DCCB/credit society board  is an additional factor cited by farmers for choosing commercial banks.  Evidence for the above migration can be seen from the accompanying table. In 2014-15, cooperative banks accounted for  Rs 15,817 crore or 28.3% of the total agricultural credit disbursed in Maharashtra. By 2018-19, their lending had fallen both in absolute as well as relative terms to Rs 12,073 crore and 17.8%, respectively. One reason for that was the increased share of term loans (from Rs 21,860 crore in 2014-15 to Rs 36,677 crore in 2018-19) in the total agricultural credit (Rs 55,961 crore and Rs 67,914 crore, respectively for these two years). Commercial banks have practically taken over the term-lending segment.  Before any new crop season, farmers take loans from cooperatives, commercial banks and regional rural banks (RRB) to finance their input (seed, fertilisers and pesticides), labour, irrigation and energy requirements. The normal interest rate on such peek karj is 7%. In case of timely repayment, farmers are entitled to an interest subvention of 3% from the Centre and 2% from the state government. That makes the effective interest rate at just 2%.  Commercial banks require farmers to provide their 7/12 land revenue extracts and have two guarantors each time that they apply for a crop loan. If the loan is for cane cultivation, they have to additionally furnish a copy of the agreement signed with the sugar mill for offtake of the crop. The DCCBs, on the other hand, deal not with individual farmers, but village-level societies (such as the Bhimrao Anna multipurpose cooperative) that draw up the necessary agreements with mills and arrange for guarantors on behalf of their members.  With commercial banks, I can approach them directly and they will pass the loan application if my papers are right. With cooperatives, you have to be in the right camp and they also take their own time to process the application, claims Patil. Maharashtra has 21,102 primary agricultural cooperative societies affiliated to 31 DCCBs. The directors on their boards are elected from its members, which also makes these bodies vulnerable to political headwinds.  Latest data from the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development reveals that commercial banks currently have 2,761 rural branches in Maharashtra, which is higher than the 2,761 of DCCBs and 444 of RRBs. Even among the 31 DCCBs, only 8-10 are believed to be financially strong to sustain credit growth.  The ones that are still alive are struggling to remain relevant as commercial banks are looking to increase their physical presence and offering better services. And rural banking is not just limiting yourself to agriculture, points out a cooperative bank official based in Pune.  Take the relatively better-performing Sangli DCCB. In 2018-19, it made crop loan disbursements of Rs 1,304.95 crore, as against Rs 1,022.43 crore the previous fiscal. However, Mansing Patil, general manager (banking and loans), is visibly worried. Yes, there is year-on-year growth, but our customer base isnt increasing. The younger rural folk are turn to commercial banks that provide better technology-based solutions, he admits.  Between 2016-17 and 2018-19, the DCCB has seen the number of loanee farmers attached to its 4,133 village societies shrink from 1.66 lakh to 1.43 lakh. The 92-year-old bank is at present facing problems due to four out of the regions 17 sugar mills defaulting on loans given by it. We are keen to introduce mobile banking, but the Reserve Bank of India has not granted permission because of our high non-performing assets, which touched 11.83% (of gross advances) at the end of 2018-19, he adds.  Over-dependence on crop loans and lending to agri-based industries is another issue. The Islampur-headquartered Rajarambapu Sahakari Bank operates 33 branches that are largely in the peri-urban and rural areas of Sangli, Kolhapur, Satara, Pune and Solapur districts. This cooperative bank lends to farmers as well as micro, small and medium enterprises in these areas. According to its managing director Rajaram Jakhale, over 51% of the banks  Rs 1,489.80 crore loans disbursed last fiscal was for housing, MSMEs, vineyards, drip irrigation and other long-term agricultural investments. But we cannot easily compete with commercial banks. They have access to much cheaper funds and are offering home loans at 8-8.5%, whereas we can give only at 9.5%, he notes.  For the farmer, whose loan needs now go beyond agriculture, the choice is clear. Pravin Patil, 40, owns eight acres at Bahe village in Sanglis Walva talika, on which he grows sugarcane in four and soyabean and groundnut in the rest. I go to the cooperative society only to avail crop loan. But for other needs, I prefer either Union Bank of India or the Bank of Maharashtra, he declares. And he doesnt mind going the extra distance to Islampur.",TOMATO

So what if parking is not thought of well, the caf has done their best with interiors for car parking frustrations to fizzle out. Done up with two dominating colours  blue and white, the caf will vaguely remind diners of Blue Door that once used to be a city hotspot for its signature Greek menu. What I liked best about the interior is that it is homely and cosy and gives a welcoming feel.  Caf Nook is the exact place where you will want to hang out after work over endless finger foods being passed from one person to the other. These cafes display of knick knacks is a carefully put-together menu and one can see that a lot of thought has gone in. Nothing seems to be out of place and every corner relates to the other with perfect harmony.  Music could be a little loud sometimes, but on request they are more than willing to lower the volume.  At most cafs, my favourite go-to-dish is chicken wings; I find them value for money. Wanting to make every penny count, I ordered a portion of it. It reached the table after a bit of waiting and the first bite had me keep it back on the plate immediately  it was crispy all right but the sauces were yet to soak in. I decided to let the wings get ready as I sat waiting while my stomach growled. After about seven minutes the wings seemed ready, and this time round, with the sauces getting fully absorbed, the wings were perfect. Those who are fans of piping hot food that comes at the risk of burning your mouth, this dish is totally for you.  I was keen on trying the Caesar salad. So I did and was completely blown away by it. Many places still dont get their salads right, this caf nailed it. A lot of dishes were recommended at Caf Nook. Some of them are kul kul mass pizza, bruschetta, keema pav, cottage cheese malfatti, peri peri chicken and the Thai curries.  Of the list suggested, the ones I was eager to have were the kul kul pizza and keema pav  but both werent available. So, for the mains, I went for chicken was Thai curry and cottage cheese malfatti. The malfatti seemed to be like malai kofta curry puddled in a thick tomato gravy  very cheesy, yet not bad to taste.  I quickly moved over from malfatti to the Thai curry. It was on point and had me cleaning the bowl to its last morsel. I also tried a no-frill chicken pizza.

Scientists and researchers in Bengaluru have formulated a matrix or powder formula that can make the pheromone-based pest control method almost eight times cheaper.  The pheromone method works like this  farmers purchase a vial of the semiochemical (a pheromone released by an organism that affects the behaviour of other substances) that are specific to particular insects. Semiochemicals synthesised in laboratories attract male species for mating. The substance is put in a dispenser that economically distributes its flow over months. As the female insect gets attracted to the dispenser, a sticky trap awaits them, explained Abishek Garg, a PhD student from Jawaharlal Nehru Centre For Advanced Scientific Research (JNCAR), Bengaluru.  He said that farmers use a dispenser named rubber septa, which requires 400 to 700 milligrams of the semiochemical and lasts for three months. Since the solution costs up to Rs 60,000 per gram, it becomes an expensive alternative to pesticides, Garg added.  Scientists from JNCAR and Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), Bengaluru have developed a matrix  powder like substance  for this nano-enabled control of semiochemicals.  Speaking to TNIE, principal scientist Dr Kesavan Subaharan said that the red palm weevil (RPW) lure technology, that was transferred by the researchers to ATGC, received a huge tender from the UAE. The lure gets rid of the invasive pests and saves a large number of date palms.  The RPW has been a menace for the past 20 years and had hit the date palm cultivation in the middle east. The researchers held field trials in parts of west and east coasts of India and found that the technology works. While this lure was sold by the USA at one or two dollars, we sold it at 30 cents, Subaharan added.  This technology has been tested for tomato pin worms, rice yellow stem borer, diamondback moth (found in cabbages), and even the fall armyworm that had caused global devastation in maize production. They are looking at breaking into global markets with their technology.",TOMATO

The thought behind this new initiative is to provide morning diners a familiar breakfast experience, yet loaded with wholesome food in the form of forgotten grains, microgreens, alternate milks, fresh juices, locally produced cheese and artisanal bread. Breakfast is considered to be the most important meal of the day and for a good reason. A comforting dosa, idli, toast, eggs, coffee and orange juice are usually some the items mostly preferred by busy executives at city hotels before their dash to the first business meeting.  The Zesty Mornings breakfast has been launched at ITCs Pavilion restaurants across the country where the chefs have put together a menu which is thoughtfully prepared with ingredients high on the health quotient while taking care of dietary requirements such as gluten free, low fat and probiotics. Take, for instance, the Conscious Cereals programme which incorporates sorghum, pearl millets, red rice, amaranth and porridge with the requisite fibre for the body while providing a healthy source of sustained energy to kickstart the day.  There are customisable Breakfast Bowls with a choice of homemade granolas, toasted nuts, puffed grains and flavoured yoghurts. For diners with dairy intolerance, there are alternate milks derived from seeds, nuts and soya. And, not to forget, the Pavilion Juicery blending freshly sourced microgreens, sprouts, herbs, fruits and vegetables to make that perfect glass brimming with taste and nutrition. The glass-covered Raj Pavilion at ITC Windsor overlooking the cool blue pool makes for a perfect breakfast destination even if you are not a resident guest at the hotel. You could make a breakfast date with your family and friends and savour the extensive fare in this sun-soaked, Victorian-themed restaurant inspired by the 100-year-old Lalbagh gardens.  Same goes for the glass, marble, steel and wood adorned Cubbon Pavilion at ITC Gardenia. Named after Cubbon Park, the highlight of this restaurant is the vertical garden which adds a touch of the outdoors inside the restaurant making it an ideal setting for a morning repast with your favourite dishes.  Going back to the breakfast, there is a Wokery section dishing out Asian food including congee, dim sums and bao buns while ensuring we get our balanced fix of protein, starch and leafy greens. There is a Western Griddle section employing healthier cooking techniques such as baking, roasting and pan-frying without compromising on the tasteful flavour of the dish. And, for those comforting moments, the South Indian island dishes out the softest idlis, crispy ragi dosas and uttapams from handmade batters accompanied with piping hot sambhar, home ground podis and chutney. However, if you are in the mood for a light breakfast then you could opt for a millet-based khichdi too.  In addition to the extensive buffet, a menu card on the table announces signature breakfast dishes which are available on order. Here you could choose from Puffed Amaranth Oat and Pumpkin Seed Granola with nutmeg cashew cream and rosewood honey or the Buckwheat and Jaggery Pancakes with toasted almond cream, fennel and chilli stewed apples.

Forced to bow out of the 2016 Rio Olympics after a knee injury, she returned to the ring with a vengeance in 2018, and became the first Indian woman wrestler to bag medals at both the Commonwealth Games (a gold) and Asian Games (silver). She subsequently became the first Indian to be nominated for a Laureus World Sports Award, often called the Oscars of sport. Her two medal-winning cousins, Geeta and Babita, along with their father and coach, Mahavir Singh, were the focus of the 2016 Aamir Khan blockbuster, Dangal. Now, Vinesh is eyeing gold at the Olympics. A look at what keeps her going.  Coming from a family of wrestling icons is a double-edged sword. Theres always great support, but with cousins whove set the bar so high, youre also under immense pressure to win.  That said, failure has taught me a lot. Since childhood, Ive faced challenges with a stubborn will and told myself, whether or not someone else can do it, I can!  After the injury at Rio, my plastered leg got weak and thin. Growing up, I was taught that training hard was the solution to everything when it came to wrestling, so being restricted to exercises that would have earlier amounted to warm-ups was frustrating and scary.  But with motivation from physiotherapist and trainers, I stuck with the plan. At six months, I started mat training, and in a year, as they had promised, I felt like the injury had never happened.  This experience taught me the importance of rest when it comes to fitness, and the negative impact of excess. Even after I returned to full-scale training, we consciously allocate time for rest.  Ive learnt a lot about diet too. Earlier I didnt really know what foods contained protein or didnt. Sometimes Id skip breakfast, have one roti for lunch or just have eggs before sleeping. Now I eat a steady, healthy diet. Before training I have eggs and oats, tomato or bread. Lunch is roti-sabzi (protein-rich chana, rajma, etc), dahi, salad or fruit; dinner is roti-(hari) sabzi and eggs.  Im not overly strict, but neither do I eat anything at any time, like I did before.  What happened in Rio gave me a lot of time to reflect and work on myself, inside and out. Now, if I lose, I see it as an opportunity to identify areas of weakness; if someone says something negative, I know how to keep it from staying in my head too long. In the end, you can have the best diet, train hard, do everything, but if you dont have faith in yourself, you cant win.  Sundays are my time off from it all. I just do my own thing, tidy up my room, watch movies, listen to music, read, spend time with my people or go shopping. All this lifts my mood like magic. The other thing that works the same way  ghar ka khaana. After a win, I just want some solid sleep and garam garam roti with ghar ka makkhan or chatni and I feel like Ive been given the world.",TOMATO

Agriculture is the major activity that provides livelihood for the people in the hilly area that is located 120 km from Erode and borders Karnataka. Tomato, onion, chilly, potato, turnip, ginger, cauliflower, cabbage, beans, brinjal, beetroot, carrot, radish, garlic and banana are widely cultivated by farmers in their small holdings in over 35 villages at Talavadi. Vegetables are taken to the seven mandis where price is arrived by auctioning and the successful bidder transports the produce to markets in Erode, Coimbatore and Kerala.  But many farmers say that they are not getting right price for their produce ending up in loss. Production cost for a kg of tomato, cabbage and beetroot comes to  5. But traders purchase it for  3 to  5, says Kanagaraj of Soosaipuram. Since there is no cold storage facility here, we are forced to sell our produce at a price fixed by traders, he says and added that tomato is even procured for  1 from them at times.  Also, vegetables arrive in large quantities from Chamrajanagar, Chikola and Bandalli, all in Karnataka where adequate water is available. Price for our produce is fixed by traders and not us, says another farmer Balan. We cannot transport our produce to markets in plains and hence we sell beetroot for  2 a kg, he added. Absence of cold storage facility, lack of provision for converting vegetables into value added products, arrivals from Karnataka and poor pricing are affecting the farmers.  Another farmer S. Manickam wanted the district administration to establish a regulated market at Talavadi so that vegetables are procured at a reasonable price every day. He sys that many farmers without harvesting tomato and beetroot are ploughing their land to avoid further loss. A tomato sapling cost sixty paise, while production cost including fertilizer, labour cost and maintenance for 60-days cost over  5. But one kg tomato is procured for  1, he said and wanted a permanent solution for the perennial problem.  Farmers say that price of vegetables will shoot up only after two months when the production drops. Even when tomato and cabbage is sold at  50 and  30 a kg respectively in retail market in May, it is procured at less than  20 and  10 a kg, Mr. Manickam added.",TOMATO

The immune system responds to stress in a negative way. It responds similarly to worry, loneliness and sadness. A time-tested stressbuster is physical exercise of moderate intensity that you can undertake from the comfort of your home. Cooking  or the art of preparing food  is another excellent stressbuster, and now is a better time than any to experiment with it.  Previously I have discussed the various foods that support the immune system and protect us from the onslaught of disease. This week, I put together those recommendations in a sample meal plan. I have intentionally kept the plan simple and practical, so that it is easy to follow. Rushing to the grocery store in search of exotic foods is not something I would encourage you to do at this point in time.  Early morning:   Tulsi tea with ginger and 2-3 black peppercorns freshly crushed.   Almonds / peanuts / walnuts / cashews (20-25 g).  Breakfast:   Colourful fruit bowl (orange / kinnow / strawberry / guava).   Porridge / upma / poha with veggies and seeds.   Bowl of curd or glass of lassi / smoothie / spiced buttermilk.  Lunch:   Colourful salad bowl (carrot / onion / tomato / broccoli / capsicum / beetroot).   Roti with bajra or ragi flour, or khichdi, or vegetable rice.   Green leaves cooked in dal or as saag (the more the variety of leaves, the better it is).   Curd / raita with veggies or fruits.   Chutney (coconut / amla / garlic / tomato/ curry leaves).  Evening tea:   Nimbu pani / lemon tea / matcha tea / green tea with lemon.   2-3 tbsp roasted seed mixture / chaat prepared with boiled channa or sweet potato / sprouts.  Dinner:   Soup / Rasam (veggies and dal with spices)   Egg / tofu/ soy nuggets / paneer salad with veggies   Idli / appam / cheela with garlic chutney   Cinnamon apple salad  Bedtime:    cup milk with  tsp turmeric powder and a large pinch of black pepper  This plan can have many variations depending upon locally available foods.  Diet-related general instructions:   Include a range of brightly coloured fruits and veggies in your daily diet.   Infuse your pitcher of water with lemon slices / basil / tulsi / mint / lemongrass for an immunity boost.   Spinach is the most popular leafy vegetable but we are fortunate to have many others that are just as good, if not better. The leaves of amaranth, fenugreek and moringa provide great value. Never discard the leaves of pumpkin, beetroot, radish, cauliflower and colocasia. They are edible and nutritious and can be used in a variety of ways that I have enumerated in my piece on anaemia.   Roasted seeds are a great snack. Seeds of sesame, flax, watermelon, sunflower and pumpkin can be kept handy as snack options.   Use generously while cooking spices like turmeric, black pepper, fenugreek (methi) seeds, black cumin (kalonji) seeds, mustard seeds, cinnamon and asafoetida (hing). Garlic and onions are also value additions.   Consume every day a probiotic food or drink that contains at least 5 billion microorganisms.   Use a cooking oil with Omega 3 fatty acids.  Other factors besides diet that play a role in prevention:   Wash your hands with soap and water thoroughly, several times a day, scrubbing for at least 20 seconds.   Soak in the sun for the much-needed Vitamin D. Expose the limbs to the early morning sun for 15-20 minutes everyday.   Breathing and physical indoor exercises for 30 minutes everyday.   Sleep 6-8 hours as per your routine. You could nap for 30 minutes during the day when homebound. However, don't oversleep, as this is counterproductive.   Write a gratitude journal.

To tide over the crisis, the BMC has made temporary arrangements for 95 vendors to set up fruits and vegetable stalls at Topiwala market.  In Goregaon (West), long queues were seen outside stores that were open. Shopkeepers said basic items such as flour and oil were available in limited quantities.  Kishore Patel, who works at Shivam Super Shoppy in Kandivli (West), said the stock should suffice for only two or three days. Transport is shut since three days and we dont know when things will resume, he added. Shopkeepers also complained that they feared for the safety of their workers. I am concerned about the safety of my staff. None of the customers want to wait or have patience and they are crowding inside and outside the store. Some have also come for a second time in two days to stock up, the owner of Dinesh Store in Bangur Nagar area said.  Shopkeepers, meanwhile, used novel techniques to ensure social distancing. At Roman General Store in Juhu, people were asked to write down what they need on a sheet of paper outside and wait for their turn to pick up orders. At several shops on the Juhu-Versova Link Road, however, there was not much crowd. A provision store owner said their worry was how long their stocks would last.  In some shops, like Maharashtra Trading Co in Jogeshwari, circles were drawn on the road with chalk at some distance from each other. The customers had to stand in these circles while waiting in line.  There was also a rush to get LPG cylinders. Shekhar Bhalerao from Byculla had to first book an LPG cylinder on his cellphone. After getting a confirmation message, he had to rush to the gas agency to get a slip and then show the same at a third location to get one. While there was panic buying till afternoon, things seemed to stablise later in the evening, as crowds around shops reduced.  The announcement of a lockdown had set off panic. Many people, however, seem to have realised that shops will remain open and the crowds reduced in the evening, a Reliance Mart employee in Kharghar said.

At major markets like Chalai, Palayam and Peroorkada, the price of vegetables is shooting over the roof. The vendors are taking customers for a ride and they are cashing in on the opportunity amid the crisis. Within 24 hours, the price of vegetables increased by Rs 20 to Rs 30. The vendors said the sudden hike is due to the shortage of supply from Apta market and Vadassery in Nagercoil. For instance, the price of onion is different at various markets. At the Chalai market, the price is Rs 95 per kg while at Balaramapuram it is Rs 70.  At Neyyattinkara, the price is Rs 36. So it is clear the vendors are exploiting the current scenario and charging exorbitant rates. We have no option left but to buy vegetables without bargaining. It is true that vendors are exploiting us. The government should do something soon to rein in the price of essential items, said Sumathi, a housewife at Neyyattinkara. On Tuesday, the price of onion at Chalai market was Rs 60. The price of tomato increased from Rs 20 to Rs 40 per kg while the price of green chilli shot up from Rs 28 to Rs 45. The same increase in price is seen in the case of beans and potato. Similarly, many vegetables, including carrot, brinjal and cabbage, are unavailable in markets.  According to M Prabhakaran Nair, a vegetable vendor at Neyyattinkara, the shortage of vegetables from Tamil Nadu has affected the sales by and large. There is a big shortage of vegetables. So we are not getting adequate supply. Even wholesale vendors are setting a high price for various items. But we are selling at nominal rates only. The acute shortage of vegetables may result in shutdown of vegetable shops soon if things go like this, he said. The lack of adequate number of Horticorp outlets also adds to the crisis. At present, only 21 direct outlets of Horticorp are functioning in the district.  Over 20 truckloads of fruits and vegetables arrive in the district from other states daily. With transport coming to an abrupt halt due to the lockdown, the losses will be massive. On Tuesday, the state police registered cases against those who violated the shutdown rules. Most of the cases were registered in Thiruvananthapuram district.  Talks to be held with Kanyakumari collector  District Collector K Gopalakrishnan said he would hold discussions with the Kanyakumari district collector to ensure hassle-free transportation of vegetables to the district. I am holding talks with my counterpart in Kanyakumari as many vegetable vendors here depend on markets in Tamil Nadu. There is a shortage of vegetables and it will be solved soon. So there is no need for panic buying and we wont allow anyone to increase the price, he said.",TOMATO

Tom Hanks and wife Rita Wilson tested positive for coronavirus while the former was shooting Baz Luhrmanns Elvis Presley biopic in Australia. While announcing it on social media, Hanks wrote the couple was taking the one-day-at-a-time approach to coronavirus as they were kept under isolation by Aussie medical officials.  The 60-something husband works in the food industry and still insists upon leaving every day for work, saying he needs to keep his business afloat. His frightened wife desperately wants him to stay home.  For another couple, in the midst of a separation, the bitterly fought issue is the kids and whether they can safely see friends. One parent is allowing it in an effort to be the fun parent; the other bitterly opposes it.  And for still another couple, its simply about grocery shopping. She fills the cart, and he accuses her of hoarding unnecessarily. She argues that they need to be prepared.  Scenarios like these are playing out in urban high-rises, suburban homes and tiny rural communities across America as couples try to navigate what has abruptly become the new normal during the coronavirus outbreak. Described by therapists, lawyers or the couples themselves, they reveal how even the most subtle differences in temperament or coping strategy can be painfully exacerbated under the incredible stress and anxiety that the outbreak is causing.  Its a time when every domestic decision can seem to have impossibly high stakes, says Catherine Lewis, therapist and faculty member at Ackerman Institute for the Family in New York, from the seemingly small  whether to go grocery shopping  to the fraught calculus of which family members should isolate together.  This pandemic is making us all think about our relationships, because you really cannot do one thing without it impacting somebody else,, says Lewis, whos been conducting therapy sessions remotely. Its such a powerful example of how interconnected we all are.  Added to that, Lewis notes, is the utter helplessness of having no idea how long the situation will last.  She does see some couples finding that they have a wild capacity to be resilient, to just find a way to move through the day. On the negative side, its clear that people are generally not at their best when under deep stress.  Normal patterns are intensified, she says. Theres increased annoyance, people snapping.  Alcohol can become a more frequent coping mechanism. Or worse.  Im worried about couples where there is intense aggression, she says. In cases where there was already domestic abuse, advocates fear a dangerous escalation.  Jennifer Kouzi, a divorce lawyer and mediator, puts it bluntly: Were seeing a lot more bad behavior.  Shes been receiving calls from clients who had already been unhappy in their marriages or in the process of splitting, and are now feeling increasingly desperate. They feel helpless, too, because along with the enforced confinement, the legal process is mostly on hold. Courts are generally closed.  In many cases, there may be no ramifications for bad behavior. One parent, for example, has refused to turn over a child to the other in accordance with their agreement, citing the virus crisis, even though the other parent is taking every precaution. Police have refused to enforce the custody order and recommended the parent go to court, but its unclear if judges will deem the case an emergency. In another case Kouzi is aware of involving a separated couple, one parent is allowing their kids to go see friends, to be the fun parent, so the kids will want to stay there full-time instead of with the parent actually following recommendations and guidelines.  Its not all grim.  Some parents have actually risen to the occasion and are communicating better than normal, rearranging schedules and increasing FaceTime access and doing what makes sense for their kids, she says.  Kouzi, who practices in both New York and in Westchester County, one of its suburbs, is telling her clients to try to use the time productively or to consider mediation. There will be such a backlog when courts open up again, she says.  Some couples are experiencing only minor ripples, if any. Stephanie Pfeiffer, a business systems analyst in Boston, found herself annoyed with her husband when they went food shopping last week, and each time she put something into the cart  two pounds of butter, cans of tuna or tomato soup, a box of crackers  he questioned why.  Were arguing over groceries, said Pfeiffer. He accuses me of panicking and hoarding, but the reality is we NEED more groceries. After all, the couple is now working at home together.  In a minor adjustment, Pfeiffer recently moved her makeshift work station away from the kitchen table, where her husband works, into a corner of the dining room. Now we cannot see each other, she quips. As time stretches out, Im optimistic we will get into a routine and settle in.  Some stay-at-home mothers say their husbands, now homebound, are finally seeing how much domestic work their spouses do. In New Jersey, Caren Tolleth, mother of a 5-year-old and a 9-month-old, finds that her workload has only increased with the addition of her husband to the routine.  Its been like most days, she reported last week, except that my husband is leaving dirty dishes and I get to clean up after him, too. She joked that her spouse had made the mistake of coming down at one point to chat, and I handed him a baby to put down for a nap. He hasnt come down since!  Adrienne Pattison, who lives in a rural area of Washington state, joined a Facebook group called Parenting Under Quarantine a week ago and wrote: Is it just me or is anyone else totally frustrated with the husband/partner or whatever?? Im about to go postal! Her good-natured venting elicited more than 160 comments and anecdotes.  Maggie Hellman, the Bergenfield, New Jersey, mother who created the Facebook group for her friends to blow off their own steam  she never thought it would balloon to over 20,000  notes that some couples are, of course, dealing with gravely serious challenges. Her brother, a pediatric intensive care physician, has to come home through a side door to discard dirty clothing and wash his hands to avoid infecting the family. His wife, a nurse, must be extremely careful as well.  Hellman, a social worker and stay-at-home mom, says its natural that couples with children are feeling intense stress.  Children create stress in a marriage, period, she says. The relationship changes dramatically. Under current conditions, she says, youre stuck at home all day with each other when perhaps there already were issues. She imagines that single parents have it even worse, especially if they have only one child.  They get no break, they have no one else to be with, she says.  Lewis, the family therapist, says its still early days. She hopes the couples she treats will find a way to deal with the anxiety and uncertainty in a useful way. Some of her best advice to couples: Lets try not to both have a bad day at the same time, she says. If todays your bad day, mine is tomorrow. Lets not blow at the same time.",TOMATO

Prime Minister Narendra Modi, on March 24, had announced a 21-day nationwide lockdown till April 14 to curb the spread of coronavirus. The district administration has issued a list of prices for basic items and prices will be applicable for the lockdown period.  The prices were decided after taking suggestions from the various market committees in the district as well a review of prices in other districts and blocks, read the order from district magistrate BN Singh.  The administration has been constantly monitoring the situation and taking action against people who are either hoarding goods or increasing the prices of essential items or selling them in black. The district magistrate had formed 30 teams to carry out inspections and act against the violators. Several shops have been fined for violations in the last week while more than 85 have been inspected so far.  Four pharmacies had also been booked under the Beta 2 police station area on Sunday under the Essential Commodities Act, 1955, for allegedly selling sanitisers at a price higher that the specified MRP (maximum retail price) even though they are now listed under essential goods.  The primary fruit and vegetable market of Phase 2 is supplying essential items through 500 vehicles to various parts of the city on a daily basis. Each vehicle also carries the rate list at which items and produce are to be sold. The administration has also urged the public to buy these items only at the designated prices.  Singh said the administration will continue to monitor the situation and take action against people not following orders.  The prices are for shops and vendors selling these products in loose. The idea is to ensure that people have access to affordable commodities, Singh said.  The cost of a kilo of flour will be between 28-30, rice between 30-35, salt between 15-20, and sugar between 38-40, among others. Similarly one kilo of potato, bottle gourd, cauliflower and tomato will cost 30, onion 35, oranges 60, and bananas50 per dozen.  Residents have welcomed the administrations new move.  This will ensure that we dont have pay inflated rates for essential items. More than that, it will make goods accessible to even low-income families who are currently having trouble procuring such necessities. Branded products are already being sold at prices higher than the given MRPs, KK Jain, secretary general, Federation of Noida Residents Welfare Associations, said.  People had earlier alleged that prices had increased as soon as the crisis had started.  Following the order, prices have gone down and its effectiveness is visible. Potatoes are now down to 30 and so are tomatoes. There is a slight increase in the prices of a couple of fruits and vegetables but even that is not by a large margin, Amit Gupta, a resident of Sector 77, said.  The administration along with the police department is constantly surveying the situation and necessary legal action is being taken.  A grocery shop owner from Gaur City 1, Manoj Kumar, was arrested by the Bisrakh police Monday for allegedly selling goods at increased rates. He was booked under relevant sections of the Essential Commodities Act.",TOMATO

Because of the non-availability of vehicles to transport their produce, many farmers allowed residents to pluck the produce from their farm free of cost.  Rangaraj, a farmer from Tholampalayam, who had cultivated watermelon at his one acre land, is among many farmers who allowed residents to take his produce for free. He said that he was unable to transport the watermelon to a market at Karamadai about 15 km from his farmland.  Similarly another farmer, Sampathkumar from Neelampathi near Karamadai who cultivated tomato at his 1.5 acres did not harvest it citing that wage he has to pay labourers and the transportation costs, which he deems high. He pointed that traders offered only Rs 6-7 per kg of tomato, while retailers sell it over Rs 45.  Durai, a farmer who has a banana plantation at Velliankadu, cited the same reasons when asked why he did not head to the market to sell his produce. He said he sells the bananas to petty shops in his village at `50 a bunch. Most farmers in Tholampalayam have small farmlands.

Aluva-based entrepreneur Anas Nasser, founder of natural soil substitute Organure talks about DIY ways to grow a vegetable garden while also managing biowaste in your house  This lockdown has taught us two thingsfirst, our fragile waste management system needs a more robust and self-sufficient alternative, and Second, we cannot keep depending on the market for vegetables. Hundreds of people staying at home are now willing to try a hand at farming. Due to the unavailability of fertilisers and additives right now, starting farming can be both easy and tough. But there are alternatives you can try at home, says Anas Nasser, an Aluva-based entrepreneur. His product, Organure, is an eco-friendly and sustainable oil substitute that will help you farm at home.  Straight out of kitchen  According to Anas, the kitchen waste we generate at home can be easily reused to grow vegetables in our garden. Most soils in Kerala right nowthe red soil in your compound, sand-mixed varieties or the clayey typeare all fit for farming. The key is mixing and balancing their characteristics. You can easily nurse the soil available to you, he says. The food waste available at home can be stored away in a pit in your backyard, or a steel container if you live in an apartment. In 30 to 45 days, you will get the right compost to make a rich kitchen garden. Cereals, pulses and vegetable waste will set very easily, he says.Another villain when it comes to having to store your waste is fish waste. Fish is a complete fertiliser. It provides all the natural nutrients your soil needs, Anas says. If you can mix it along with the other biowaste, it could work wonders for your plants.  Gardening tips  If the idea of storing food waste doesnt particularly impress you, there is an alternative. You can trim and collect the grass growing around the house and mix it with water in a 1:4 ratio. Add jaggery, salt and tamarind to this mixture and let it rest. In 20 to 30 days, it can become a strong fertiliser for garden plants, adds Anas. You can get in touch with him regarding queries on Instagram through his page @plantaemaniac  Dont believe the hype  You might have seen those DIY videos where people plant seeds and in days, it fetches a fruit. That is not always the case, and keeping high expectations can kill your passion, warns Anas. Also, techniques like growing tomato saplings from a cut tomato piece, doesnt work with hybrid varieties. This sort of half information will only turn you away from farming, he adds. According to him, the best varieties to begin with, so you can fetch and use the produce in 30 to 40 days, would be green leafy vegetables. They are packed with nutrients, and are especially helpful when you are spending time indoors, he adds. Red and green spinach, parsley, kale and coriander can be your first pick. Potatoes, green chillies and carrots are for more adventurous growers. If you spot shallots sprouting in your refrigerator, you can try planting them too, he says.",TOMATO

Bill Gates quite aptly refers to this pandemic as a corrector and not a disaster. Among some of the positive outcomes is the habit of handwashing.  It has always been difficult for us to be rigorous and diligent when it comes to washing our hands, but this habit is sure to change. While we are at it, we must remain mindful of conserving as much water as we can. Make sure to turn off the tap while you scrub your hands with soap for the prescribed 20 seconds.  We are also learning to appreciate the value of going local in terms of produce like fruits, veggies, grains. Without access to the more exotic and imported produce, we have begun to notice the nutritional worth and versatility of local and seasonal food a lot more.

There was surplus supply of vegetables on Tuesday. So, their prices came down within the budget of common people, said Dttatray Kalamkar, the head of the vegetable division of the market.  The Chhatrapati Shivaji Market Yard on Tuesday received 13,700 quintals of vegetables, higher by 1,300 quintals when compared to the last bazaar day on Sunday. The Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) officials stated that the five sub-markets in Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad also received more vegetables than expected at 6,290 quintals. Thus, prices of all vegetables, including leafy vegetables, and staples like tomato, cabbage, cauliflower and ladies finger stabilised.  Tomato was sold in the range of Rs8-12 per kg, ladies finger for Rs10-20 per kg and green chilli for Rs20-35 per kg. Garlic was sold for Rs80-140 per kg in the wholesale market.  The vendors will sell these vegetables at a little higher rates, but people dont need to panic and stock vegetables. They would not have to pay very high prices as there is adequate supply of all vegetables, Kalamkar said, adding that holding market on alternate days was one of the reasons behind the increased supply.  Last week, some retail vegetable shops in Shivajinagar sold tomatoes at Rs80 per kg, while people had to shell out Rs350 for a kilo of chilli.  The wholesale prices of leafy vegetables, too, crashed to as low as Re1 per bunch of coriander. A bunch of coriander, fenugreek and spinach was sold in the range of Re 1 to Rs6. The retail vendors are selling these leafy vegetables in the range of Rs5-10 per bunch, said Kalamkar.  About 190 quintals of vegetables were not sold in the open auction at the Market Yard. The quality of some produce was substandard and there were selected traders in the market. Eventually, this produce was also sold at low prices, said an APMC official.  This would again maintain the prices at reasonable level in the retail market, Kalamkar said.  An APMC official said more supplies would come to the market on Wednesday onwards as the commission agents would open their shops from April 1.  Farmers are worried that their produce will get damaged because of the rain in the district. Since there is no market every day, they are bringing their produce in large quantity. But it may have an adverse impact on the supply in the coming days, Kalamkar cautioned.  Chief administrator Balasaheb Deshmukh said the Market Yard would not allow more than 400 vehicles of vegetables from Wednesday onwards.

The department, through its main arm  the Horticulture wing  is motivating farmers to produce more vegetables in the State. The fact that the current period happens to coincide with the season for the cultivation of vegetables in the State has come in handy for the authorities.  Simultaneously, the Agricultural Marketing and Agri Business Directorate  another arm of the Agriculture Department  is in touch with officials of supplier States such as Maharashtra and Karnataka to ensure the steady supply of vegetables.  As Tamil Nadu receives an average of 250 truck loads of big-sized onion (around 6,250 tonnes) every day from Nashik, Maharashtra, the officials of the western State had, at an inter-State conference coordinated by the Centre on Tuesday, assured their counterparts in T.N. that there would be no shortage of onions, a senior official of the Agriculture Department said. Karnataka is another supplier State, which provides tomato, potato and carrot. Agra in Uttar Pradesh has been a consistent provider of potato to Tamil Nadus markets.  As for the domestic production of vegetables, Tamil Nadu, on an average, produces 50 lakh tonnes of vegetables annually, of which tapioca accounts for about 27 lakh tonnes; tomato 3.2 lakh tonnes; onion 2.2 lakh tonnes; and brinjal 1.2 lakh tonnes. Seventy Uzhavar Sandhais (farmers markets) in different districts have been relocated to bigger sites outside the limits of cities and towns so that the norms of social distancing could be followed.  In the meantime, the Agriculture Department is overseeing the distribution of urea to the Cauvery delta, where there are plans to raise paddy over 50,000 hectares. Called summer paddy, this crop will cover 30,000 hectares initially. On Wednesday morning, a consignment of 1,200 tonnes of urea reached the Thanjavur railway junction. The State will get nearly 14,000 tonnes more shortly. Ordinarily, the summer paddy is not encouraged. But given the present circumstances, the authorities are willing to give latitude to the farmers, who have been advised to adhere to social distancing norms.",TOMATO

There have been reports from across the State of farmers, in despair, destroying their own crop.  Yogesh, a farmer who grew muskmelon in Sira, Tumakuru, said that with no labour for harvesting and no transportation facilities to take it to the market, his produce was left to rot in the field. I gave all my fruits for free to whoever came to my farm. I spent another 10,000 to clear the land and throw away all the rotten fruits into a tank nearby, he said.  Thimmanna B.G., a farmer who grew tomatoes at Hiriyur in Chitradurga, dumped 15 tonnes of his produce on a dry tank bed as he could not transport it to the market. I invested 25 lakh, taking a loan of 17 lakh, only to throw my produce into a tank, he said. He demanded that the government provide compensation to farmers.  In Belagavi, Azad Desai, a cabbage farmer from M. Mallapur village, let cattle graze on his one-acre cabbage crop that was ready for harvest, while, another farmer in the district ploughed through his cabbage field. At Shanivarasante in Kodagu, a farmer threw a truckload of chillies on to the street, while, over the last one week, several tomato growers dumped their harvest on the streets at the markets after it fetched only a pittance and there were no buyers in Kolar, Mandya and Tumakuru districts.  In Shikaripur, represented in the Assembly by Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa, and Sorab taluks of Shivamogga district, muskmelon and watermelon are rotting away in the fields. Prabhu Kumar C.B., a farmer from Shikaripur who has grown muskmelon of the Kohinoor variety on his two-acre plot, said, Cracks have developed on the fruits owing to excess temperature. They are rotting in the field.  Rangappa, a watermelon farmer from Sorab, said the owners of fruit mandis in Mumbai and Bengaluru had approached him in the second week of March to purchase his produce, but there are no takers now.  Labour shortage  Yet another problem is the severe labour crunch in villages. Labourers and drivers are scared and are not coming to work. Moreover, watermelons and muskmelons are harvested by specialised labourers who come from outside; they have also stopped work, said Srinivas, a farmer from Srinivaspura in Kolar.  There is palpable anger against the government and elected representatives over what is being called an ill-planned lockdown and the government not coming to the rescue of farmers. In a video clip doing the rounds, a worried farmer from Belagavi, Bhima Nayak, has made an appeal to the government. We dont want the governments free LPG and rice. What I and other farmers like me need is a market for the produce that we have grown on our fields.  Farmers leaders said the crisis has put the spotlight on the lack of adequate cold storage infrastructure in the State. Farmers are dumping their produce because of the absence of cold storage facilities at most APMC yards. There is no security for farm produce in the country, said the Mysuru-based farm activist Vasanthkumar Mysoremath.  Kodihalli Chandrashekhar, president of Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha, came down heavily on both the Union and State governments for shedding crocodile tears for farmers. It is commendable that the governments are ensuring workers are paid despite being given off. But farmers are suffering huge losses for no fault of theirs. The government must ensure minimum support price for all crops, failing which it must provide compensation to farmers, he said.

Our Mavuthampathi Panchayat supported us with provisions. As for vegetables, villagers in the border areas generously offered us regular supplies of tomatoes, onions, brinjal, drumstick, and ladys finger from their farms.

Downstairs, her older restaurant Pumpkin Tales, was buzzing with laughter and conversation, as diners gathered over avocado toast, hunks of chocolate cake and steamy cappuccinos.  Then, like every other restaurant in town, both started emptying out as the shadow of COVID-19 loomed. By the weekend of March 21-22, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the all-India Janata curfew, they had switched off the ovens.  Now, they are open again. But in a very different avatar, cloaked in the scent of hand sanitiser instead of the comforting aroma of baking bread. A hefty table across the front bars customers from entering. Only delivery and takeaways. And the staff are in masks and gloves, meticulously wiping down every table with a bleach solution at regular intervals.  A lot has changed in a very short time.  Navigating the challenges of Indias 21-day lockdown, as delivery services including Swiggy, Zomato and Dunzo resume  albeit with limited timings  restaurants across the country are struggling to reopen. Not everyone can: theres an overwhelming shadow of fear, manpower is in short supply and ingredients are difficult to procure. Yet, rents and salaries have to be paid. And, judging by the response, customers are eager to start ordering food again.  Gauri Devidayal, owner of The Table, Mumbai | Photo Credit: special arrangement  Tough times  On a call from Mumbai, Gauri Devidayal, who runs The Table and Magazine Street kitchen, says, I have been speaking to people who run restaurants, delivery kitchens and catering units, and they all feel many of them are going to have to close. Rent is 50 to 60% of your cost, and it is crippling. She adds, One of the biggest challenges in Mumbai and Delhi is the fact that most kitchens use migrant workers, who have all gone home.  Her team has tried to get back on its feet as quickly as possible by restarting the bakery a few days ago. We had an overwhelming response. On the first day we went live, despite no advertising, we did the same value of sales in four hours that we did over the whole of February, says Gauri. The only reason we were able to relaunch was we got a small team to move into Magazine Street Kitchen. We converted our dining room into a living space to minimise them going back and forth.  Their delivery-only brand, Iktara, re-starts next, offering Indian comfort food. The focus is great quality at delivery prices, cooked in a hygienic kitchen, she says, adding that moving forward, hygiene is going to be of paramount importance as customers need to trust restaurateurs and chefs more than ever before.  This is why Ashvin Rajagopalan of Chennais Ashvita Bistros main focus now is restaurant hygiene, and keeping his team safe. Now that they are up and running for deliveries again, albeit with a flexible menu since not all ingredients are available, the caf accepts only contactless payments.  In Chennais T Nagar area, Paati Veedu is also slowly powering up. G Mohandas, one of the owners, says they are trying to deliver orders to their older customers especially, who find it challenging to shop for groceries and cook during the lockdown.  To accomplish this, they are focussing on larger plates of dishes that can stay fresh for a couple of days in the fridge, like tamarind rice, sambar rice, rasam and idlis.  Right now, people want anything that is available, he says. They are not being picky. Everybody has understood you cant have a whole lot. But we are trying to keep the menu interesting. Since we are a vegetarian restaurant, even with six types of vegetables available, we can dish out quite a lot.  For restaurant chains with set menus, however, a reliable supply of ingredients is vital, and with supply chains affected by the lockdown, every day poses fresh challenges. Sandesh Reddy, who oversees the French Loaf and Wangs Kitchen chains, in addition to Sandys, Ox And Tomato and Hu Tong, says they are tweaking menus depending on what is available everyday, but adds that there are a lot of logistical issues. We are doing the best we can, he says, But it is tough. And I dont know how many restaurants are going to survive this.  On popular demand, they have got five French Loaf outlets up and running, supplying bread. The bread arrives at 10 am, and we sell out by 1.30 everyday, he says. In an attempt to supplement the bread, the cafes are also selling eggs, milk, pasta and instant noodles, when available.  The team at Pumpkin Tales, Chennai | Photo Credit: special arrangement  What lasts longer  Back at Pumpkin Tales, Chindi is elbow deep in dough. We have just one baker now, so Im spending about four hours in the kitchen everyday, she says, adding that they can barely keep up with the demand ever since they reopened the bakery. We are selling four times more bread than usual, so we now bake three times a day.  They are also finding creative ways to cater to customers craving a change from cooking at home. We also make pizza crusts, that are 50% cooked, and give it with sauce and cheese, so people can make pizzas at home. Also burgers, shakshuka, and pasta sauces. They now have a lockdown menu, offering practical, larger portions for families: tubs of soup, fried rice that does well in the fridge and whole roast chickens.  Since people are comfort eating now, she is also baking more cake. We have carrot cake, triple chocolate and brownies. We used to sell cinnamon buns and scones once a week, now we bake them everyday.  She adds, We also brought back our Christmas cranberry sourdough  I think people need some kind of a treat now.

These are some of the problems facing colleges that have adopted online tutorials for students after the COVID-19 lockdown.  Many of the audio clips of these classes are already doing the rounds on social media and are a source of comic relief. Teachers are heard pleading with students to listen to them while others are threatening to reduce their internal evaluation marks if they continue to disrupt classes.  Some of the more popular clips include students playing popular Kannada songs, and an audio of how to make tomato rice in the middle of the lecture.  A lecturer of Bangalore University (BU), who has been conducting online classes, is surprised by the level of disturbance in the classes. When I begin the class, I mute the students. I unmute them later. But in the middle, students unmute themselves and start playing songs from the radio, he said.  A challenge  But laughter aside, technical glitches are a challenge. According to the BU lecturer, 25 minutes into the class, the audio malfunctions and students are unable to hear him properly. While the university has stated that these online classes are useful and that professors will be able to complete portions on time, students and faculty members disagree. Other colleges are also facing similar problems. During regular classes, I would be able to complete what I had planned in an hour. But in the online classes owing to the disturbances and technical glitches, I am able to complete only half of the study plan, said a lecturer of a city-based degree college.  A postgraduate student of BU said that she was unable to attend classes owing to poor internet speed in her village. Many of us went to our villages after college closed. It is very difficult to attend the class as our video keeps getting disconnected every few minutes. So I will just study on my own. What is making it challenging is that none of the reference books can also be found online, she said.  However, what is heartening for the lectures is that the attendance rate for these online classes is higher compared to physical classes.  Many of our students who normally bunk classes are logging in because they have nothing else to keep them engaged.

Wait before you grab your wallet and door keys  shopping during emergency situations like a pandemic lockdown needs the skills of an army general  and always a Plan B in case A goes flying out of the window. Here are some strategies that will help you make the best of your shopping time, between the stipulated hours, a fruitful experience.  Buy in quantities that will last you for at least a week or 10 days, because staying in is an essential requirement of the preventive measures.  Disappointed that your favourite products are sold out? Try and make do with substitutes. For example, tomato puree works just as well as fresh tomato in gravies. Fresh milk can easily be replaced with powdered dairy whitener or creamer in hot beverages. And coarsely ground desiccated coconut (available in most groceries) can stand in for the fresh variety in chutneys. You may surprise yourself with your inventiveness in the kitchen!  Make a list  Check your store cupboard, pantry and fridge first before you start making your shopping lists, to avoid over-buying or forgetting something. Remember, you are not planning for a picnic or party, so first list the practical requirements like flour, sugar, eggs and so on. Whether you are living alone or with family, choose a judicious mix of cook-and-serve and instant foods. Dont be tempted to overstock perishables like readymade dosa batter  unless you want to spend a few weeks eating stuff that smells slightly off. And theres only so much instant noodles seasoned with no-name spices that one can eat in a lifetime. Instead, go for long-lasting pulses and lentils like chana dal, which can be cooked in many ways. Vermicelli (sevai/semiyan) is another option that can be adapted into savoury and sweet recipes. Though writing them out may seem pernickety, lists help you to stay grounded when you are out shopping during lockdown, especially if you have more than one place to go.  Time is money  With strict rules on personal distance, and hygiene, be prepared to wait for at least half an hour before you are allowed into a store. Shops are required to be open from 6am to 2pm, so try and make an early start from home. Remember to have both currency notes and bank cards in your purse. Plastic is not always fantastic during emergencies, so keep plenty of loose change. But dont be tempted to get rid of your spare coin collection during a shopping trip  counter clerks are human beings too. So dont pay a bill for 500 with 5 coins  thats just too cheap when theres a queue of fellow lockdown shoppers snaking behind you. Or you could be digitally savvy and use contactless payment options like GooglePay.  Earn some brownie points  If you know of senior citizens or people with disability who may need help with their shopping, offer to do it for them. As public transport isnt available, you could do your neighbour a good turn by car-pooling, saving fuel and time. Remember not to crowd in though. You will definitely earn some neighbourly goodwill to boot. If you are fond of BOGOF (Buy One Get One Free) deals, you could split some of the surplus purchases with someone in need. Residents of apartment blocks could consider clubbing their home-delivery orders for things like drinking water, gas, and fresh milk, so that the delivery person makes fewer trips, and has an incentive to serve everyone safely.  Choose your store wisely  Check the travel time to each store before you set out, so that you dont end up missing something. Dont combine a trip to the butchery, fishmonger or poultry shop and grocery on the same day, as mutton, fish and chicken dont keep well in the heat, and theres no telling when you will be served.  Pharmacy alerts  If you or your family members are on long-term medication, make sure that you have enough medicines for the duration of the lockdown. Many pharmacies offer door delivery, but in case this is not possible, you could try calling ahead with your prescription, so that it can be picked up with minimum delay.",TOMATO

Occasionally, when he spots someone from his State, he would request them to make his favourite Ghugni (a gravy made with dried peas and potato). On the first day of the lockdown however, with restaurants shut and not left with much choice, he anxiously picked up the ladle and made dal. Today, from ghughni to aloo bhujiya, he can whip up a range of recipes.  Many working professionals living alone in the city have been accustomed to eating out at restaurants for almost every meal of the day, for years. Now, they have realized what an essential survival skill cooking is, and have also discovered a new love for it. I have become more patient -- thats a skill cooking has taught me. From quietly waiting for the rice or vegetables to boil and to getting the consistency right, I realized cooking has turned me into a more patient person, Mr. Kumar says.  Rengaraj Dhachinamoorthy, a 32-year-old working professional in Chennai says, he cant wait to try chicken or mutton biryani.I started with dal, now, on a daily basis, I make sambar, rasam and onion and tomato chutney. On Sunday, I made mutton curry, which turned out well. I perfectly marinated the mutton with all the spices, cooked it just right and in the end, when the gravy tasted heavenly, I thought it was well worth the effort, he says. He plans to rustle up more such recipes with the help of Youtube videos or Instagram, he adds.  Similarly, 34-year-old Thomas Pradeep too says, he was quite apprehensive initially yet, he made a beginning, out of compulsion due to the lockdown. Now, I make mutton clear soup, mutton gravy and of course the other pedestrian yet comfort foods like rasam and curries. Its quite satisfying and heartening to cook every day during this lockdown. Im glad I discovered it, he adds.",TOMATO

However, this means little for the farmers as they are unable to sell their produce in mandis due to the ongoing lockdown.Though all arrangements were made to prevent distress sale of paddy in the district, the farmers are left in a lurch. The farmers who were issued the centralised tokens, introduced last year to streamline the procurement process, are unable to sell their produce.  Around 40 per cent of the farmers had registered online and were given tokens. However, there are no buyers, said secretary of Rushikulya Rayat Mahasabha Simanchal Nahak. He said with around a fortnight to go for the procurement process to end, it is unlikely the farmers will be able to sell their produce.  Nahak said under such circumstances, the Government should waive the farmers loans and declare financial assistance for them.  Similar is the plight of vegetable farmers in the district. Like paddy, the vegetable yield too has been decent this year. But the farmers have no means to carry their produce to the market. Left with no option, several farmers are feeding the vegetables to livestock.  The lockdown has also adversely impacted the price of vegetables. While tomato was being sold for `25 per kg until a few days back, it is now available for `5 per kg. Similarly, brinjal is being sold for only `3 per kg against `30 a few days back.  Sources said tonnes of vegetables are being thrown in dustbins at Bada Bazar, the wholesale market of the city.Even as vegetables have become cheap, the prices of essential commodities have gone up. The district administration has been directing traders to sell grocery and other items at stipulated prices, a few unscrupulous ones have been acting on their own much to the discomfort of consumers.",TOMATO

Since the lockdown came into force, he has been unable to sell the produce.  The vegetable, which has a significant market in Bengaluru, was dumped for want of takers and due to the hurdles in transportation. Other vegetables still have takers every day. But capsicum is largely procured by restaurants and exporters, said Mr. Raju, who grows capsicum on two acres. The 70-day crop, cultivated annually, generally sees good production during summer, with farmers spending close to 3 lakh per acre.  Capsicum is grown on 50 acres in Denkanikottai and Hosur blocks of Krishnagiri. Red and yellow capsicums fetch anywhere between 100 and 150 per kg, while green capsicums fetch 70 per kg. Traders are unwilling to take the risk of purchasing the vegetables from the farm gate, and the export market in Hosur was shut even before the lockdown, Mr. Raju said.  To leave the vegetable on the field would destroy the entire field. It has to be harvested to save the crop. Mr. Raju and other capsicum growers here have been harvesting the crop only to dump them later.  P.M. Sivasamy, who grows cabbage on his two-acre farm at Devarayapuram in Coimbatore, is struggling to sell the produce.  He spends 30,000 to 40,000 an acre and harvests nearly 10 tonnes of cabbage after 90 days. I am able to sell only 100 kg to 150 kg a day. I used to sell to the daily markets in Coimbatore city. Now, traders come to the farms and ask for the produce at 6 to 10 a kg. Before the lockdown, I sold it at 15 to 20 a kg, he said.  D.N. Aruchamy, a tomato farmer, said, Today, the trader who buys from me every day did not come. I do not know what to do with the tomatoes. Tomato crop cannot be left without harvesting for more than two or three days. Tomato growers are selling 15 kg for just 130, as against 300 earlier. In the Nilgiris, prices of carrots and garlic are expected to crash in the coming weeks. Recently, a truckload of carrots were dumped in a pit.  Farmers and traders of vegetables say that due to the lockdown, sales of the produce to other districts has been affected. As a consequence, the production of vegetables has far outstripped demand, meaning vegetable prices have fallen steeply, said R. Hariharan, a carrot trader from Ketti Paladai.  Supply hit  Supply of vegetables to the local markets too has declined and farmers have stopped harvesting their crops over the last few weeks, he added.  Pavish Shankarnathan, a prominent farmer and vegetable trader from Udhagamandalam, said, People have cut down on harvesting crops, and some vegetables such as garlic are being stored in large quantities in warehouses till the lockdown eases. When it does finally end, all of these vegetables are going to come to the market, which will translate into a steep drop in prices. Principal Secretary of the Agriculture Department Gagandeep Singh Bedi said a video of a load of carrots being dumped in Nilgiris was filmed on the second day of the lockdown. Now, with the government removing restrictions on the movement of agricultural and horticultural crops, there will be no hitch for any farmer in selling his or her produce, he said.

58,58.0,,,2020-04-07,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/farmers-are-at-their-wits-end/article31273857.ece,"As global trade falls and supply disruptions persist, a prolonged lockdown will adversely affect food security  The COVID-19 pandemic has led to global concerns on the state of agriculture and food security. On the one hand, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) has warned of a food crisis if countries do not protect vulnerable people from hunger and malnourishment. On the other, farmers face a stalemate as they are unable to work on their land, earn remunerative prices and gain access to markets. We can try to understand the impact of COVID-19 on agriculture with three questions. One, does the world have enough food to feed its people? Two, is food available at affordable prices? Three, how are farmers coping with the lockdown?  Also read: Coronavirus | Rabi harvest to be affected for want of farm workers  Food stocks and prices  According to the FAO, as on April 2, 2020, the total stock of cereals in the world was about 861 million tonnes. This translates to a stocks-to-use ratio (SUR)  i.e., proportion of consumption available as stocks  of 30.7%. The FAO considers this comfortable. The SURs for wheat, rice and coarse grains were 35.3%, 35.1% and 26.9%, respectively. But world stocks are different from national stocks. About 52% of the global wheat stocks is held by China, and about 20% of the global rice stocks is held by India. If the major holders of global stocks decide to turn precautionary and stop exporting, and if the lockdown is prolonged, countries dependent on rice imports will suffer.  Kazakhstan, a major wheat exporter, has banned exports. Russia, the largest wheat exporter, is expected to restrict its exports. Vietnam, the third largest rice exporter, has stopped its exports, which will reduce the global rice exports by 15%. If India and Thailand too ban exports, world supply of rice will sharply fall. In March 2020, the Philippines and the European Union, major rice importers, had inventories of rice enough to feed their populations for about three months. Others, however, had inventories to hold on for about one month only. If the lockdown continues beyond a month, these countries will face food shortages.  Indias foodgrain output is projected to be about 292 MMT in 2019-20. On March 1, 2020, the total stock of wheat and rice with the Food Corporation of India (FCI) was 77.5 MT. The buffer norms for foodgrain stocks  i.e., operational stock plus strategic reserves  is 21.04 MT. Similarly, for pulses, India had a stock of 2.25 MT in mid-March 2020. In both cases, the rabi harvest is slated to arrive in April 2020, and the situation is expected to ease further.  There is always an element of uncertainty on how prices will behave if both demand and supply fall together. Prices in different markets fluctuate considerably given differences in the extent of production, stocks, arrivals and supply disruptions. According to the FAO, the world food price index fell by 4.3% and world cereal price index fell by 1.9% between February and March 2020 due to the weakening demand for food and the sharp fall in maize prices owing to poor demand for biofuels. However, retail prices of rice and wheat have been rising in the Western economies in March 2020. The major reasons identified are panic buying by households, export restrictions by countries and continuing supply chain disruptions. Retail prices of beef and eggs have also been rising.  In India, wholsesale and consumer price indices (WPI and CPI) for March 2020 have not been published yet. WPI and CPI for food in India were rising from mid-2019 onwards, reflecting a rise in vegetable prices, especially onion prices. January and February 2020 saw a moderate fall in these indices, but vegetable prices have remained high. If food prices rise due to the lockdown, it will be on top of an already rising price curve.  However, unlike in the West, food prices in India have not risen after the lockdown. While supplies have declined, demand has fallen too. In the APMC mandi in Mumbais Vashi, if about 600 to 700 trucks arrived per day before the lockdown, only about 200 trucks arrive per day after the lockdown. Yet, wholesale prices of foodgrains and vegetables in the mandi have been stable, with only the prices of pulses showing a tendency to rise. This is because there has been a sharp fall in the consumption of foodgrains and vegetables. Similarly, the consumption of milk has fallen by 10-12%.  The crisis in farming  Harvesting and marketing of crops are in crisis across India, because of (a) disruptions in the procurement of foodgrains by government agencies; (b) disruptions in the collection of harvests from the farms by traders; (c) shortage of workers to harvest the rabi crops; (d) shortage of truck drivers; (e) blockades in the transport of commodities; (f) limited operations of APMC mandis; and (g) shutdowns in the retail markets.  Second, these supply bottlenecks have led to a fall in farmgate prices. According to media reports, tomato growers in Maharashtra were receiving only 2 per kg. Wheat prices in Madhya Pradesh fell from 2200/Q to about 1,600/Q. In Punjab, vegetable prices fell from 15/kg to 1/kg. In Delhi, the price of broiler chicken fell from 55/kg in January to 24/kg in March. In Tamil Nadu, egg prices fell from 4/egg in January to 1.95/egg in March.  Third, the large-scale return of migrant workers to their homes has disrupted harvest operations, and farmers are being forced to leave the crop in the fields. While mechanical harvesters can be used, there is a shortage of drivers/operators. Most rice mills work with migrant workers, and their return home has meant that these mills are not buying paddy from farmers. There are also severe labour shortages in milk processing plants, cold storage units and warehouses.  Fourth, supply chains remain disrupted across India. Agricultural goods have been notified as essential goods. But about 5,00,000 trucks are reportedly stranded in the highways and State borders. Milk trucks are able to unload at the destination but unable to return empty, which has upset supply schedules. Trucks are in shortage as drivers have gone home. Imports of vegetable oils are not being lifted from ports due to shortage of trucks. Most APMC mandis are functioning only twice or thrice a week. Livestock feeds are in short supply, and this is breaking the back of livestock growers.  The world and India have adequate food stocks. But as global trade shrinks and supply disruptions persist, a prolonged lockdown will adversely affect food security in many countries. In the Western world, food prices are rising due to panic buying and stockpiling. Food prices are not yet rising in India. What has kept Indian food prices low is the severe decline in food consumption, especially among the poor, after the lockdown. That is, hunger may keep the food inflation in March 2020 low. Concurrently, farmers face acute labour shortages, falling farmgate prices and lack of access to input/output markets. It is unclear who is benefiting, but farmers, workers and the poor are at their wits end.  R. Ramakumar is NABARD Chair Professor at the Tata Institute of Social Sciences, Mumbai",TOMATO

As she had financial commitments, she would leave her one-year-old baby with her mother-in-law and spend the day at the market. I was gradually expanding my customer base and this lockdown has left me in the lurch, she says, adding, My husband also cant earn anything as he cannot take his autorickshaw out. We were worried about how we will manage. That is when my husband suggested that we use his autorickshaw to sell vegetables, says Deepa.  So on April 3, Deepa began to sell vegetables door-to-door in the vehicle in and around Velachery.  The idea seemed workable and I thought it would be a service to the public during the lockdown. I travel in the drivers seat, along with my husband, as the rest of the space in our auto is filled with trays of vegetables, says Deepa, adding that she resorted to a retro-method to attract customers. I shout out, avarakka, thakkali, parangikai, keera ellam fresh kai amma at the top of my voice, as we drive past apartments and houses.  Deepa goes to Koyambedu by 5 am with her husband and spends two hours to procure vegetables for 2,000. She begins her door-to-door sales from 10 am onwards. We wind up by 12.30 pm, and return home. The cost of vegetables has skyrocketed, therefore I get five kilos of six or seven varieties of vegetables. Demand seems high for fresh green vegetables such as broad beans, cluster beans, Ooty beans, lemon, ginger, drumstick, spinach and onions. Right now she does not sell fruits as the price is rather high. If I get a kilo of tomato for 20, I sell it at 25, I dont increase my margin more than 5 per kilo. After all the hard work, at the end of the day, we make 300 each.  She currently stays with her mother in Perungudi as she can leave her baby in her care; her in-laws have left to their native town. It is the elderly who are extremely happy that I bring vegetables to their doorstep. I wear gloves and cover my face with a mask, and leave the vegetables they want near their home, and request them to leave the cash in the basket, which I take after they leave, she says. So far she has sold out all her vegetables within two or three hours and whatever is left  bruised vegetables  she feeds to the cows on the road.  We disinfect the auto as we are aware of the COVID-19 and the crisis the world is facing, she adds. If anyone requires we can go to other nearby locations as well to sell.

The actor who is in self-isolation and self-quarantine along with husband, Indian cricket team captain, Virat Kohli keeps sharing her daily agenda with us, and the latest insight she has given us is how she boosts her immunity during the current coronavirus pandemic that has taken over 65,000 lives around the world.  Anushka took to her Instagram stories to share her immunity-boosting tips, posting a picture of turmeric paste, the Pari actor wrote, Boost your immunity, start the morning with Haldi.  This was followed by another picture of a jug and a glass of lime water, Next up - lemon water, she wrote. And if you think thats all, brace yourself, Anushka also has alkaline water, posting on her story she wrote, Last thing on the immunity boost menu - alkaline water. Thats it! Over and Out.  In another story Anushka also shared the food she eats to boost immunity, posting a picture of moringa leaves and rasam, the PK actor wrote, Immunity boosting food on the picture. Sharing a picture of her plate, Anushka revealed that she eats what looks like stir-fried moringa leaves and tamarind rasam made with tomato and garlic. Anushka believes these foods help boost immunity.  Other than food, Anushka has also shared pictures and posts of herself doing other activities including giving husband Virat Kohli a haircut. She most recently posted a photo of herself along with her parents and husband Virat playing Monopoly, she captioned it, Its from our primary caregivers - family that we learn how to tread the journey of life, how to walk, how to eat, how to socialize & then face the world. This forms our initial conditioning that has a lasting impact on us. In the world we inhabit today, there is a lot of uncertainty and Im sure a lot of you have found that solace & sense of familiarity with your families.  She added, Stay at home to take care of everyone precious in your lives. And also make the most of these moments ... smile, laugh, share, show affection, clear mis-understandings, develop stronger/healthier bonds, discuss life and dreams and pray for a better tomorrow. We all have been moved deeply, we all have been affected deeply and hopefully, we will carry forward these lessons in the days to come. And hopefully, we have all conditioned ourselves to relook at the world we inhabited before all of this happened...  Then referencing the game of Monopoly they played, she added cheekily, P.S.: It was a super close game of Monopoly and the competitive side of everyone was out there. Any guesses who won??  In a previous post with husband Virat and their pet dog, Anushka wrote thoughtfully, Every dark cloud had a silver lining. And this time, while it may seem like the worst time and in so many ways it actually is, has also forcefully made us all stop and deal with things we might have been running away from because either we were busy or it was convenient to say we were busy.  She continued, If this time is respected for what it is, it will enable more light to shine through. This time has also made us all realise whats truly important. For me just having food, water and a roof over my head and the good health of my family seems MOST important. Everything else is a bonus that I bow my head in gratitude for. But, that which we call basic is not so basic for everyone after looking at all the people who struggle for just those few things. My prayers with them and their families. May everyone be safe and secure. This time has surely made me more reflective.  Counting her blessings, she continued, This need to stay at home with your loved ones has been forced upon the entire world but there is a deep lesson for us all. There is a lesson to strive for work and life balance ( Ive valued and strived for this dearly for many years now ), there is a lesson to devote more time in things that actually matter. Today, when Im surrounded by all the blessings in my life, I just want to tell everyone how much compassion I feel for everyone who I see suffer. I want to help as many possible in the best of my abilities.  I feel pride in our resilience to be better human beings. I can instinctively feel this in and around me. We will all have our individual and subjective lessons from this time and hopefully, such lessons will continuously stay with us all, she signed off.

The devices will help in conducting rapid tests in clusters and help the official machinery to initiate quick measures to combat spread of coronavirus.  Officials explained it to Chief Minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy during a high-level review meeting on Monday on Covid-19 containment measures being implemented in the State.  They informed the Chief Minister that as suggested, the capacity of testing labs in Visakhapatnam, Guntur and Kadapa is being enhanced. As the ICMR (Indian Council of Medical Research) has given its nod for the new methods of coronavirus tests, it will help in conducting tests at the primary level. Accordingly, latest medical equipment is being procured.  Taking stock of the situation in the State, which registered 266 Covid-19 positive cases by Monday morning (9 am), the Chief Minister directed the officials to focus on conducting random tests in red zone, cluster-wise like in Visakhapatnam and initiate measures accordingly. The officials informed the Chief Minister that out of the total 266 positive cases, 243 are who returned from Delhi after attending Tablighi Jamaat conference and their primary contacts. Testing their samples is almost completed, they added.  Special Chief Secretary KS Jawahar Reddy said volunteers, ANMs and Asha workers conducted door-to-door survey and identified people with coronavirus symptoms. Now, doctors will determine who need to be tested for Covid-19 and accordingly take samples and send them for testing.  During the review meeting, the focus was on the future course of action in the State and how best to contain the virus spread. It was decided to collect samples using random test kits and based on the results, initiate necessary action.  Enquiring about the facilities being provided at isolation wards and quarantine centres, the Chief Minister directed the officials to ensure facilities are uniform and follow the standard operating procedure. He also instructed the officials to ready Covid-19 hospitals with all necessary equipment and ensure every hospital, government and private, has isolation wards.  The officials informed the Chief Minister that the staff treating Covid-19 patients and suspects, will undergo 14 days of isolation after working for one week.It requires more number of doctors and support staff and accordingly plans have been evolved, they added.The Chief Minister asked the officials to give priority to coronavirus affected areas in the State in the distribution of personal protective equipment and other things.  Special mobile app for agricultural products  Chief Minister Jagan Mohan Reddy directed officials to come up with a mobile application to extend help to farmers in real time by monitoring what is happening at the field level.  Through the mobile app, officials will be able to know what is happening at the field level from village secretariats, Rythu Bharosa Kendras (RBKs) and agricultural assistants about crop situation, harvest, marketing and price.  The Chief Minister directed the officials to get the mobile app ready in one week.  Officials were asked to ensure that farmers cultivating sweet lime, papaya, banana, mango and tomato do not suffer losses.  Already, bananas are being procured through self-help groups and Mission for Elimination of Poverty in Municipal Areas (MEPMA) in each district.  15 new procedures under ysr Aarogyasri  The State government, which has already brought Covid-19 under the purview of Dr YSR Aarogyasri scheme, has decided to include 15 new procedures under it to treat coronavirus suspected and confirmed stable or unstable cases as recommended by government pulmonologists. The hospitals should treat the suspected and confirmed positive stable or unstable cases under the said procedures on request made by the local health authorities or after intimation to the local health authorities duly following the safety, precautionary measures while treating such patients.  Jagan says govt will stand by farmers at any cost  The CM reiterated that the government will stand by the farmers in this time of crisis. Officials informed the CM that harvesters from other States are also being brought to ensure harvesting is not delayed. They informed that perishable agri produce is being transported to other States and rythu bazaars to ensure farmers do not suffer losses.  In view of red zones announced in Kurnool and Guntur due to more number Covid-19 cases, market yards in those areas are temporarily shifted to other places.  On the issue of aqua products, the CM asked the officials to see that there is no hindrance in transportation of fish to West Bengal, Assam, Bihar and other States and at the same time focus on ensuring stabilisation of prices of aqua feed.

The coronavirus has created a paradigm shift in the way we work and think. But, it has also taught us to be and become better people; to overcome adversities by lending a helping hand, and to do our best from wherever we are with whatever we have.  As different organisations have been coming together to help those in need, a group of young and creative artistes in the city  The Dancers Club (TDC)  are paving the way for the arts community to do their bit. The oneyear- old dance club will be curating a fundraising online dance workshop as part of their campaign Lend a Clean Helping Hand in association with Niravi NGO, today.`  The idea  Earlier last month, when Arnold Charles, director of the club, travelled to his hometown in Tiruchy, he was in for a rude shock. I came across several daily wage labourers and house helps who didnt have enough money to sustain a prolonged lockdown. So it started as a personal initiative to help those in the neighbourhood. Soon, the situation escalated and I discussed with my friends and team about starting a campaign to raise funds for those in need across the state, shares Arnold, who along with Suren R and Kaushik, started TDC last year.  Within a short span, the club has carved a niche for itself and garnered a loyal following. It is this popularity which the group decided to tap on, but for a cause. The aim was to spark an idea among the arts community and create awareness so that other artistes and creative groups could follow suit, he shares.  TDC was launched last year  Funds for a cause  After joining hands with Niravi earlier this month, the campaign was flagged off. In a span of two days, the group received a contribution of over Rs21,000 and the proceeds were given to the NGO. Five kilograms of rice bags were procured and given to 100 underprivileged people; freshly prepared tomato rice parcels were also distributed to around 150 people. Having safety as our primary concern, we have been involving only five people in the cooking process and only two of our experienced social workers go around distributing them, read a post on Niravis Instagram page.  The workshop  When the goal to help those in need was set, physical distancing, the lockdown, the lack of studio dance mirrors wasnt going to stop the team from doing what they knew best  to dance their hearts out. But this time, they have decided to take it to a larger audience via an online workshop. Since our initiation, we have curated several classes  techniques oriented and those that give focus on choreography.  But one of our recent Bollywood workshops  where I along with Simran Sivakumar, a well-known Bharatanatyam dancer, mentored a group and taught them a routine for a Bollywood song  was a big hit. Just when we were planning to conduct another session, the lockdown was announced. So, we decided to give it a spin, curate an online workshop and do it as part of the campaign.  The proceeds from this workshop will also be given to Niravi, says Arnold. The group, which is hoping to make a difference with dance, will soon be launching its second studio in Royapettah. The workshop will be held today at 5 pm. The registration fee is Rs 250. For details, visit Instagram page tdc.thedancersclub or call: 9677157369",TOMATO

Three main factors are driving food prices higher, according to data from the consumer affairs ministry, as well as a dozen agricultural produce market committees (APMCs), which are state-regulated wholesale points.  One, arrivals of farm commodities in APMC markets have plunged sharply, down almost 60% in some markets from a month ago, that is, in the first week of March. Two, land transportation costs have risen sharply, as truckers struggle to cross interstate boundaries, despite exemptions from the lockdown. Three, restrictions and quarantine measures have resulted in serious labour shortages, affecting the loading, unloading and sorting of commodities.  Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemic  A 10% rise in food prices proportionately hits household budgets in developing nations, according to the UNs Food and Agricultural Organisation.  On April 8, the Geneva-based International Labour Organisation, in a report, said the coronavirus shutdown in India could shatter incomes of potentially 400 million poor Indians.  Click here for the latest updates from the coronavirus outbreak  Currently, supply-side factors, such as restrictions and regulations in movement, have caused a spike in food prices. Soon, things could run the opposite way, economists warned, meaning supply shocks could turn into demand shocks.  Loss of income will lead to a drop in demand for food in the coming months. A possible decline in food consumption could result in malnutrition too, said Himanshu (one name), an economist with the Delhi-based Jawaharlal Nehru University  On an aggregate basis, price of cereals, such as wheat and rice, are steady, mainly because these are being adequately supplied from state-run granaries.  Also Read: Coronavirus cases in India mount to 6,412, death toll touches 199  Restrictions have impeded farmers access to markets, denying outlets of sale for farm produce, said R Mani, an economist with the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University.  What is clear is that there has been no noticeable fall in winter crop production. Rather, state and federal officials have failed to coordinate supplies and ensure deliveries at the right time and at fair prices.  The Centre has issued advisories on four occasions to freely allow agriculture and linked activities that form the farm-to-fork supply chain, on March 25, March 26, April 2 and April 8.  Yet, broken chains of command are testing the limits of ensuring that the essential needs of 1.3 billion people are met during the lockdown, which was imposed from March 25. States are regulating supplies with permits and only selected agents are being given passes to deliver commodities at farm markets, to reduce crowding and maintain social distancing norms. This permit-driven supplies are a throwback to the Socialist licence raj era predating the 1991 economic reforms.  APMC markets are the nerve centres of the countrys food supply chain, which see a web of daily interactions between producers and food aggregators, large suppliers, auctioneers, transporters and packagers, who collectively act as price setters.  Indias official retail food inflation data for March is due for release on April 13 and will likely reflect this upswing. However, since retail prices are collected by field agents, an activity that has been disrupted by the lockdown, the National Statistics Office has, in a directive, asked its statisticians to adopt novel ways, including telephonic enquiries.  Two commonly consumed vegetables  tomato and onion  offer a representative idea of the supply crunch.  Between April1-6, for instance, Andhra Pradeshs Mulakalacheruvu APMC market, a tomato hub, received just 60 tonnes of tomato that went for a modal price of Rs 550 a quintal (100 kg each) or Rs 5.5 a kg, according to official data.  Modal price, a type of average, is simply the price point occurring the most number of times during auctions. The retail rate of tomatoes in towns supplied by Mulakalacheruvu ruled between Rs 30-40 kg, a huge mark-up, according G. Sasidhar, an official of the APMC.  In Nashiks Lasalgaon, Asias biggest onion market, arrivals are down by over 80% from a month ago, data from the state-run National Horticulture Research and Development Foundation showed.  In the first week of April, the market saw arrivals of nearly 11,878 quintals of onion, trading at a modal price of Rs 775 a quintal. In contrast, in the first week of March, onion arrivals in Lasalgoan were 73,955 quintals. This is an 83% drop. The average retail price of onions in Chandigarh and Guwahati were Rs 40 and Rs 50 respectively, double their usual rates.  On April 8, the Union home ministry, which coordinate with the states, asked all state governments to invoke provisions of the Essential Commodities Act, 1955, which includes capping prices of any edible item. No state has so far put a price cap on food staples.  Unable to source buyers, farmers are dumping farm produce. My neighbour had to dump one tonne of chillies and two tonnes of chickpeas because there were no buyers at the mandi, Amra Ram, a leader of the All India Kisan Sabha, said over the phone from Rajasthans Sikar APMC.  Bottlenecks in transportation have weighed heavily on farmers. Federal instructions and orders issued by state administrations are not in tandem, as first-hand reports suggest. India is one economy but many individual markets. Steering all of them in one direction, all of sudden, has been a key challenge, ground reports suggest.  The home ministrys orders have not percolated to the ground level even though operators want their vehicles to move. Trucks are still being stopped at various state borders, Kultaran Singh Atwal, president of the lobby group, All-India Motor Transport Congress, said.  Atwal said once trucks dump their consignments, they are then stuck as state authorities dont allow them to ply back empty. This problem of one-way traffic needs immediate resolution and has pushed up road transport costs by at least 15%, he said.  We got 42 kg of rice, five kg of dal [lentil] and two litres of cooking oil from the government. But my three children are eating much less than before because there are no vegetables and fish on their plates, said Atifa Begum, a resident of North Lakhimpur in the northeastern state of Assam.

But she had friends who could not just boil eggs, but also turn them into various kinds of Bengali delicacies. One aunt, in particular, wielded magic in the kitchen. Sakti Mashis food was something to die for. Her vegetable dishes, cooked with just a sprinkling of spices, or her fish, with tangy mustard, would leave us licking our fingers.  I am reminded of her every time someone serves me good Bengali food. I developed a taste for the cuisine rather late in my life, but now I am a lifetime member of the Bengali food lovers club. I remember the time when you didnt get Bengali food anywhere outside of Bengali homes in Delhi. The few places that were there  such as Basu Lodge in Gole Market  were like pice hotels, serving wholesome but basic dishes.  Chholar dal  With the Internet, all that has changed. There are Bengali takeaways and Bengali chefs who deliver on order. I had food delivered from one such outfit a few days ago. The food was outstanding, but first let me tell you about the platform that brings regional cuisine and patrons together.  Its called homefoodi (Homefoodi.com; telephone no: 9560107937). This site and app opens up the world of Indian regional food. Homefoodi has enlisted an army of home cooks who offer all kinds of delicious regional delicacies  Bengali, Maharashtrian, Rajasthani, Tamil, among others. A team from Homefoodi tests out the chefs, taking particular interest in the cleanliness measures adopted by them. Right now, they only deliver to areas in Noida, Greater Noida and Indirapuram.  My food came from an outlet known as Kimbodonti Rannaghar, run by a formidable chef called Sharmila Maity. These are trying times, for not every ingredient is easily available. Fresh fish is a problem, so I had a Bengali meal without any kind of fish. Instead, there was a dish of bottle gourd and shrimps, called lau chingri (150). I had asked for chholar dal, or chana dal (60) and shukto  a delicate dish of mixed vegetables (75). The chef sent me a steamed egg curry, fried pumpkin flower fritters, and a dessert that I am greatly fond of, bhapa doi (steamed, sweetened and flavoured hung curd; 90).  We had a great Bong meal, indeed. First the dal. The Bengali chholar dal is mildly sweet, a taste that I have grown to like. It also has bits of fried coconut in it, which I love. I had that with some rice, and then ate the shukto  brinjal, drumsticks, broad beans, radish, bitter gourd, and other such veggies, cooked with fried dal balls in a light, mildly bitter sauce. This was excellent, and set the tone for the next dish, the lau chingri.  The lau chingri in our house is rather nice, but this was different, and equally tasty, I thought. I had a feeling the bottle gourd had been cooked in a bit of milk, which gave it a creamy consistency. The egg dish  steamed omelette pieces in a tomato gravy  was interesting, and I ended the very satisfactory meal with a delicious bowl of bhapa doi. It was different from my mother-in-laws memorable version, but I enjoyed it. I thought it was almost like a cheesecake.  The meal opened up the floodgates of memory. I finished the last bit of the bhapa doi, and remembered the aunts. They are up there somewhere, tempering food with panch phoron. And I guess my mother is looking at a boiled egg with considerable interest.  The writer is a seasoned food critic",TOMATO

A lockdown to contain the spread of coronavirus has hit agriculture, the backbone of the economy. Green chilli, grown in abundance across 25 villages in Khanapur and Belagavi, is being dumped in the compost units. Every day about 300 bags of chilli arrive at Khanapur, of which only 100 to 150 bags are being procured while the remaining produce is dumped.  Farmers say they are not getting the money spent on transport. Instances of farmers dumping their tomato crop into bins, destroying cabbage in the field without harvesting them have become common sight post the lockdown.  A drastic fall in demand for the perishable crops is expected to hit the farmers hard at the end of the lockdown.  Kodihalli Chandrashekhar, president of Raitha Sangha, said the state will face a `1 lakh crore loss in the agriculture and horticulture sectors due to the lockdown. He said these perishable crops produced in abundance in Bengaluru Rural, Kolar, Chikkaballapur, Tumakuru, Mysuru, Vijayapura, Belagavi and Bagalkot have no takers.  The demand for many perishable crops and fruits has drastically fallen with the closure of hotel and catering industry. We are able to store crops like jowar, rice, cereals and wheat, which are not perishable. However, it may become difficult to avoid losses which the farmers may face owing to the falling demand for perishable crops, said Joint Director of Agriculture Jilani Mokashi. Farmers of North Karnataka growing grapes, pomegranate, flowers, chilli, cabbage and various other crops are expected to face losses running into hundreds of crores.  A huge export of grapes from Athani region to various foreign countries besides in other parts of the country has come to a grinding halt due to the lockdown. And most of the standing crop across North Karnataka region is likely to wither without any takers if the lockdown continues. While estimating a loss of at least `120 crore for grape growers due to the lockdown in Athani region alone, Shahjahan Dongargaon, former MLA and a noted grape grower and president of Athani Raisin Processing Cluster, expressed concern over the damage the lockdown could cause to the perishable crops in the state. He said, Grape fields were damaged due to water scarcity and soil erosion during the last rainy season.  However, the grape growers managed to handle the crisis and were able to produce large quantities of grapes to meet the demand, he said. And those growing Jarbera flowers by taking huge loans from the banks are in great trouble with demand for their produce falling rapidly. Sangappa Tangadi of Hulagbali village in Athani taluk who has grown Jarbera flowers by constructing greenhouses in his two-acre land investing Rs 70 lakh, said, I was getting a profit of Rs 20,000 after meeting all the expenses and labour payment. But my income is zero now. It is difficult to store or maintain the flowers. I have to sell them right now or face the losses.  WHERE ARE THE BUYERS?  Summer paddy crop in some 15 taluks of Tungabhadra region are all set for harvest but with neither labour nor transport nor promise of procurement available, farmers are a worried lot. Summer crops in some 10,000 hectares like groundnut has no takers.  The lesser spoken of the plight of fruit and vegetable farmers the better. Government wants APMC yards open for farmers but where are the buyers? DCs impose restrictions that yards will function only between 8 am and 12 noon, but there are no or very few dealers, said Maruti Manpade, president, Karnataka Prantha Raitha Sangha.  To ensure farmers get at least some support, we roped in HOPCOMS to buy fruits and vegetables. There was a problem in supply chain the first week of lockdown but about 80% of it has been restored, said Rajendra Kumar Kataria, IAS, Nodal officer for Supply chain management and commodities appointed in the backdrop of COVID-19.

I have to sell them at distressed price tomorrow, said Shankar Palodhi, vendor at Jadubabuss Bazar.The upswing of vegetable prices at retail market was because of Poila Baishakh.

The price of lemon rose to Rs 10- Rs 12/piece last week. On Tuesday, the price plunged to Rs 3.5/piece. Lemons were sold between Rs 150 Rs 200 for 100 pieces.

Chief spokesperson on Covid-19 Subroto Bagchi stated that the State Government has taken steps for procurement of Rabi produce like green gram, black gram, groundnut and sunflower for which procurement centres have been opened. Farmers have been advised to enrol their names in e-Samrudhi portal of National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India Limited (Nafed), he said.  Vegetable growers (specifically watermelon, tomato and brinjal) have been advised to dispose of their produce in nearby markets in consultation with local horticulture officials.  Farmers have also been advised to engage combine harvester for timely harvesting of paddy except those enrolled under seed production programme.Bagchi said farmers should avail crop loan facilities for taking up kharif cultivation.

After Section 144 was clamped in the district on March 24, movement of lorries, vans and other four-wheelers transporting vegetables to the Nethaji Daily Vegetable and Fruit Market stopped completely pushing the price of vegetables. In the last week of March, tomato was sold between  40 to 50 a kg while price of other essential vegetables also were up by 30% to 50% than the normal price. Panic buying by people in the initial stage of lockdown also resulted in the increase in the price of vegetables which started to reduce after transportation of agriculture produce was allowed.  On Wednesday, the wholesale price of 14 kg box of tomato stood at  80 while the price of brinjal was between  18 and  25 a kg and onion  20 to  25 a kg. Traders at the wholesale market, which currently functions at Corporations Central Bus Stand, said that after vehicles were allowed to transport vegetables, prices started to drop. Demand remains the same, but now the supply is more, they added. Another trader Murugan said that the price of fruits has gone up in the past two weeks due to increase in demand. There is a good demand for orange which is sold at  60 to  80 a kg which used to be sold at  40 a kg earlier, he added.",TOMATO

(Source: Getty/Thinkstock) People are resorting to storing food items in the freezer, so as to extend their life; heres why it is a bad idea. (Source: Getty/Thinkstock)  With an extension in the lockdown, there has been a fresh wave of panic, with people once again stocking as much of food and other essential commodities as possible. But, it is a bad idea. Scientifically speaking  with summers already here  all that food you are going to stock in the fridge is only going to get spoiled in a few days if not consumed, especially dairy and other perishable products.  As expected, some people are resorting to storing food items in the freezer, so as to extend their life. This, too, is not that great an idea, and if you are thinking of it, here is what you should know.  * Many people have bought dairy products in abundance, hoping that it will last them a long time if they keep them in the freezer. But, while milk is essential, stocking cartons and then taking them out may cause the milk to curdle when you thaw it. Even cheese, which is supposed to be cheesy, will come out in the form of crumbs when stored in the freezer.  * Any kind of fried food item is likely to lose its crunchiness if it is stored in the freezer. Besides, what is the purpose of storing it anyway? If you want to enjoy your pakodas and your nuggets, it is advisable that you savour them right away, when they are hot.  While milk is essential, stocking cartons and then taking them out may cause the milk to curdle when you thaw it. (Source: Getty/Thinkstock) While milk is essential, stocking cartons and then taking them out may cause the milk to curdle when you thaw it. (Source: Getty/Thinkstock)  * With summers here, you are likely to consume a lot of cucumber, to keep your body warm and your skin hydrated. But, never store them in abundance in the freezer. Doing this will make them taste odd. Also, the texture may get affected, too, and they will turn soggy.  * Avoid storing fruits in freezer, too. Just like cucumbers, keeping them inside will alter their taste and affect their nutritional value. You can, however, store dry fruits inside the freezer.  * Pasta and noodles do not do well in freezer, either. So, do not prepare them in abundance. Only make as much as you can consume. When you store them inside the freezer  in prepared form or unprepared form  and then take them out, they turn mushy upon being defrosted.  * Tomato sauce is something that all households use. The ketchup is used with many different kinds of food items  be it fried foods, fritters, sandwiches, etc. So, if you are wondering if you should store them in abundance, and then keep them inside the freezer, know that it is a bad idea. When you take it out, the texture will be much different  with the paste and water separated.",TOMATO

They have also called for crop planning to ensure that the agricultural produce has a market and farmers receive a fair and remunerative price once the situation stabilises.  Vivek Cariappa, an organic farmer based in Sargur near H.D. Kote, cautioned that agriculture without crop planning was a recipe for disaster.  By force of habit farmers are opting for crops such as Bt.cotton in places including H.D. Kote though the garment and textile industry is in the doldrums. If the farmers fail to get a remunerative price for the crop, it will be a crippling blow, he warned.  He called for crop planning based on market analysis and wanted the government to play a proactive role in spelling out the food crops that should receive special thrust while avoiding commercial crops. The need of the hour is to cultivate food crops which can help farmers sustain themselves in extreme situations, he added.  Though the lockdown was necessary to spread the COVID-19 infection, the interest of the farmers who have sustained loss has not been upheld by the government said Kurubur Shanthakumar, President of the Karnataka Sugarcane Cultivators Association.  The crisis plaguing the farmers is real and for an investment of 1 lakh per acre, the returns ranged from 25,000 to 30,000 and even the input cost has not been recovered in most cases. Exempting agriculture from lockdown norms is a measure to ensure that food security was not compromised but this is no gesture to reduce farmers distress, said Mr. Shanthakumar.  The Association members said to kickstart agriculture, farmers have to invest but they are hard-pressed for cash and hence the government should have announced a financial aid or package to stimulate the sector.  Mr. Krishnaprasad of Sahaja Samruddha, an organisation promoting the cultivation of native variety of crops, said large-scale cultivation of a single crop or practising monoculture is akin to putting all eggs in one basket.  If there is no market for that particular crop as seen in case of tomato this season, the farmer will sink. Hence farmers should be encouraged to opt for multi-cropping with emphasis on food crops, he said.  Calling for an agricultural stimulus, Mr .Krishnaprasad said the government should at least focus on providing relief to farmers with small land holding as their ability to withstand shocks was limited.",TOMATO

The state government has already appointed 30 senior officers to monitor agriculture and related activities in all the districts in the wake of the coronavirus crisis.  The nodal officers have been asked to remain in constant touch with the area-level officers to ensure that problems arising in the agriculture sector are addressed promptly, a senior official said, adding that emphasis has been put on strengthening the monitoring mechanism to ensure smooth operations.  A roadmap has already been prepared to ensure smooth and uninterrupted farm activities in the state during the lockdown, he said.  Agriculture Minister Arun Kumar Sahoo has directed that problems being faced by farmers should be addressed at the earliest so that activities can resume normally.  The nodal officers will work in coordination with the Chief District Agriculture Officer, Deputy Director of Horticulture and Project Director of Water Division.  Besides, the senior officials will need to keep officers of the sub- division, block and panchayat level in the loop.  As per the ministers directions, the officers have been asked to submit reports on a daily basis through WhatsApp.  The officers have also been asked to directly coordinate with traders, wholesalers, and shopkeepers to ensure the sale of fruits and vegetables at markets.  The government has stressed on extensive use of technology and WhatsApp groups for reporting purposes in the wake of the pandemic, the senior official said.  According to Agriculture Secretary Saurabh Garg, the officials concerned should keep a tab on the market situation across the country and take appropriate steps for the sale of agricultural produce of the state.  The farmers should make ample use of Ama Krushi helpline in the existing situation, he said, adding that necessary steps are being taken to provide information on farming and market situations through this service.  The farmers may also get themselves enrolled in ""Ama Krushi"" service by giving a missed call on 0674-6667171.  They can also get responses to their queries by recording their questions on this number, he said.  Stating that there is no restriction on the sale of farm produce and transportation, Garg said the department should work in a dedicated manner to facilitate the farmers.  While the harvesting of crops, transportation of harvested produce, transportation of agri-inputs such as seeds, fertilisers and pesticides have been allowed, the outlets for the sale of agricultural inputs have been permitted to remain open for a specific period of the day.  They have been advised to ensure availability and sale of inputs by maintaining social distancing, said Garg.  The warehousing facilities for agri-inputs have also been exempted from the purview of restrictions.  To facilitate the use of farm machinery the custom hiring centres have been permitted to remain open, said the official.  The state has taken steps for procurement of rabi produce such as green gram, black gram, groundnut, sunflower for which procurement centres have been opened.

While the Americans have been panic purchasing and hoarding toilet paper, many Indians have been stocking their fridge with fruits and vegetables. You too may have stocked up only to find bundles of drooping greens, peeling skins and softened veggies. We spoke to homemakers, chefs and food enthusiasts to find different ways in which one can make fruits and veggies last longer.  Wrap it up  Leafy greens like spinach and coriander stay fresh much longer when wrapped in newspaper. Ideally, leafy greens must be consumed within the first three days. However, you can extend its life by wrapping the leaf in a paper (newspapers will do too). The paper absorbs the moisture from the leaf which stops it from rotting too fast, says Dr Shilpi Ray, geriatric specialist based in Chennai.  Tomato troubles  Most Indians love to buy tomatoes in bulk. This vegetable which is used generously in most of our foods also runs the risk of rotting if not used after a few days of purchase, depending on the ambient conditions. One way to save your tomatoes is to keep them outside the fridge in a bowl lined with paper napkins. Contrary to popular belief, tomatoes fare badly in cold temperatures. They lose flavour and texture when refrigerated, says D Nitin, a food enthusiast and home cook.  Ice bath = nice bath  Who doesnt love a crispy bite of lettuce leaves in a burger or salad? The best way to revive wilted leaves is by dunking them in an ice bath. The cold temperature awakens the crispy leaves and helps revive their freshness, says Mallika Binny Krishna, home-maker and food enthusiast. She adds that the ice bath helps revive nutrition as well.  Frozen for health  The simplest and most widely used method to have your fruits and vegetables last longer is to slice them and freeze them in ziplock bags. Before storing them, blanching fruits and vegetables in hot water helps keep the bacteria away. Items like cucumber, broccoli, capsicum, cabbage, brinjals and mushrooms are some that can be stored using this method. One can store strawberries, bananas, watermelons and grapes too, says Kishan Mahalingam, a nutritionist, adding that fruits can be sliced before being frozen.  Apples and potatoes  When potatoes are stored for over two weeks they begin to sprout buds. To increase the lifespan, try storing apples and potatoes together outside the fridge. The ethylene gas produced by apples can make potatoes last for around eight weeks. When the potatoes begin to sprout buds, it means that germination has begun. The vegetable will eventually blacken and die if the shoots are not catered to. Apples prevent the potato shoots from sprouting. This increases the lifetime of the potato, says Salma Hyder, food enthusiast.  Capping the stalk  No one likes to eat the squishy part of a banana. The fruit has a life span of just about four days before the fruit flies come buzzing. One easy way to store bananas is to cover its stalk with an aluminium foil or plastic wrap. It prevents the stalk from drying up quickly, hence, keeping the banana fresh, says Kishan.",TOMATO

Normally, they have to transport their produce to nearby markets for selling it to local traders. The district received good rainfall this season and majority of the farmers cultivated vegetables as secondary crop along with paddy and other horticulture crops. The farmers cultivated vegetables in around 2,782 hectares across the district.  Majority of vegetable crops are grown in Nellore rural, Gudur, Atmakur and Naidupeta divisions. Not only traders, but also donors, NGOs and political leaders, who distribute vegetables during lockdown, have been contacting the farmers directly for procuring their produce from fields. The district imports carrot, capsicum, cabbage, cauliflower and other vegetables. Similarly, locally grown brinjal, leafy vegetables, lady finger, drumstick, cluster bean and plantain are exported to other parts of the State from Nellore.  With transport restrictions, the farmers have started selling their produce to traders, who approach them directly. We cultivated local variety of brinjal and tomato in 1.5 hectares. With ample water, we got good yield this season. We have to shift the produce to market and also to other parts of the State after striking a deal with traders. But this time, traders and other NGOs have directly contacted us and procured our produce, said S Kamalakar, a farmer from Rajupalem.  He said that on field procurement of vegetables enabled them to save transportation costs. Meanwhile, the farmers are getting cash on the spot for their produce without any delay. Another farmer K Seenaiah from Gudur rural mandal, said that the demand for locally grown vegetables has increased during lockdown. In fact, import of some vegetables has decreased compared to normal times, he said. Local traders have been purchasing vegetables from farmers only with a slight margin from the market prices fixed by the government.

Later, he took a photo of the overcooked khichdi and sweet kadhi, a Gujarati staple, and sent it home.  Yadav, 30, says his wife, who lives back in Faizabad in Uttar Pradesh with his parents and their two children, broke down. We dont have such khichdi. We usually eat dal and rice and vegetables. She insisted I return home. But how can I go, with no transport?  Surat has seen at least two instances of violence by migrant workers desperate to get home, apart from a few minor protests. While depleting cash is one reason and the desire to return home in the face of the coronavirus pandemic another, being forced to depend on food that they are not used to eating has also pushed many to desperation.  Yadav talks of his previous nights dinner, a brinjal dish with rotis. We found it very spicy. There was no tomato or potato in it. We threw the sabzi and had the rotis alone.  Yadav came to Surat five years ago and worked in a powerloom factory before it shut in the lockdown. He says they dont have any supplies to cook own food, and the two messes in the Varachha area have also run dry.  Dharmendra Nishad, 26, says that after they came out on the streets to protest, an NGO organised lauki (bottle gourd) curry. It was watery and the potatoes were half-cooked. From Gorakhpur in Uttar Pradesh, Nishad said, To survive, we eat what we get. But how long can we have such food?  Akshay Pradhan, 23, from Ganjam district in Odisha, said, At daytime, they give a vegetable with chapattis and for dinner, khichdi and sweet dal. I stopped going after two days. We are not used to eating sweet dal.  He talks wistfully of the mutton curry he and his room-mates prepared on March 19. We had bought the meat from Laskana village. Generally we have meat four times a week. We also have fish.  Assistant Commissioner of Police, A division, Surat, C K Patel said, We have come to know about the food issue, and that was one of the reasons they wanted to go home.  With many calling a helpline set up by it for migrant labourers with complaints regarding food, the Odisha government asked Gujarat on April 14 to look at the possibility of supplying dry rations instead of cooked meals.  Pankaj Haladhar, 42, from Bajarguma village in Nayagarh district, working in a textile unit in Bamroli in Vadodara, said, I have a ration card, but it is with my family in my village. We were told that even with an Aadhaar card we can get dry ration, but the dealer refused saying we dont belong to Gujarat. Our meals are not fixed anymore. If someone distributes food and we are able to reach on time, we eat, otherwise we skip. The community kitchen is far off and we are scared to go since police are everywhere.  Nitin Bhanudas Jawale, the Odisha-cadre bureaucrat appointed by Gujarat as nodal officer for Odias stuck in the state, said 85% of the issues raised in the 3,701 calls they had received, mostly concerning food, had been resolved.

It has been almost three weeks since the lockdown began here. The first week was stressful, because there was a bit of panic buying. Looking at empty shelves in shops was definitely scary. But now, about 95% of the produce is available, in enough quantities for everyone. Most of the supermarkets also stay open an extra hour only for people in the essential services.  We step out once in 10 days for groceries, but otherwise stay home. We are one of the lucky ones who have a garden in this city, so we can still enjoy the outdoors. My wife and I have always enjoyed cooking together, and we continue to share the duties.  One of the challenges for everyone at the moment is adapting our eating habits to the new normal, to this more sedentary lifestyle  be it by eating smaller portions, cutting down on proteins and carbs, or increasing our intake of immunity-boosting foods. I, for one, have been eating smaller meals. It took just a few days for my stomach and appetite to shrink and get used to it. I have also made a list of everything I have in store and put it on our fridge, so we can make a point of using the older goods first.  We cook a wide variety: I would say about 60% of our meals are Indian, and 40% a mix of Italian, Mediterranean and European grills. We are making a lot of one-pot meals these days, like khichdi, which lets us use up any vegetables that may be getting old. And also a lot of one-pot stews and wholesome soups.

In the same pan, heat one tsp olive oil; add the sweet corn kernels and grill until lightly charred.

Recipe by chef Alfred Prasad  The Tuscan ribolita stew has been a favourite, and our comfort foods include pepper chicken, chicken biryani and the classic Indian Chinese dishes like chilli chicken with veg fried rice. Dinner is usually the lightest meal of the day: a simple salad, or a soup made wholesome with quinoa or grains simmered into it. We make soup with miso from a packet in hot water, and add some ginger, vegies and tofu. Our consumption of ginger has definitely gone up because of immunity-boosting properties  we also have it with tea, or just make a traditional drink with hot water and lime so that we remember to drink it and hydrate ourselves.  Hydration is important in times like these. It gets left behind, and we often dont realise it. We are also having more high-water, seasonal produce like gourds and cucumber, and healing spices like cinnamon and turmeric.  Heres a useful tip to reduce workload in cooking. One of the most basic masalas in cooking is sauteed onion and tomato cooked into a paste, with or without spices. This can be cooked and frozen in ziplock bags and ice trays. It can be taken out and used later whenever you want to, as a base sauce.  We are not just cooking for ourselves, either. During this lockdown, we put up a notice in our neighbourhood group (which comprises about five streets each to the North, South, East and West), asking if there are any elderly or vulnerable people who are unable to cook and would like some free veg meals. Two elderly people got in touch: a man and a woman each living by themselves. They were probably dependent on their neighbourhood restaurants for a few meals each week. So twice a week, we keep by their doors packs of the same food that we are having that day, in enough quantities to last them at least two meals. We havent met them yet, since we just ring the doorbell and leave, but we have made new friends, and will be meeting them when all this is over.

Ironically, they are now finding ways to minimise losses despite the Centre relaxing lockdown norms for agriculture and allied activities starting Monday.  Breather for Cities, Plunderer for Farms  Just as farmers were dealing with the perils of coronavirus lockdown at a time when harvesting of rabi crop is supposed to be at its peak, untimely rains late on Saturday across most parts of North India exponentially increased their fears of a crop failure.  Hailstorms hit fields in Punjab, Haryana and parts of Uttar Pradesh exactly when wheat and rabi crops were just starting to be harvested.  ""Any amount of rainfall on ready, standing crop during the harvest season is hugely damaging. Saturday's thunderstorm will be causing major losses to farmers,"" said Pushpender Singh, a farm leader in Uttar Pradesh.  Meanwhile, intermittent rains during the weekend in Amritsar have made farmers worried about their ready crops.  Several farmers informed that rain would increase the moisture content in grain and that they would face difficulty at markets as the procurement agencies would not buy grains with moisture more than the permissible limit.  They further explained that Rabi crops require less water, low temperature, less humidity and moderate sunshine. Untimely rains during the harvest season only spell havoc for the crop produce.  The India Meteorological Department (IMD) forecast had said that a western disturbance would affect the western Himalayan region, which could bring scattered rain and thunder showers over the northern plain region on April 17 and 18.  Sukhdev Singh, general secretary of Bharatiya Kisan Union said, ""Rains will damage standing wheat crop at several places. The government should compensate farmers for their crop loss.  He claimed that there were not enough tarpaulins to cover produce which was brought to mandis by wheat growers in rain-hit areas.  Chief Agriculture Officer of Punjab, Dr Harinderjit Singh said, The flattening of crop has been reported. The rainfall received in the district ranged from 4mm to 6mm. It is scanty but would delay the harvesting.  Punjab's Special Chief Secretary KBS Sidhu also tweeted, saying, Compensation, rather the relief, shall be distributed expeditiously out of this State Disaster Relief Fund (SDEF).  Normally, when untimely rains hit, farmers begin panic harvesting but that is not possible this year because the government has restricted assembly of people. Moreover, several farmers complained that machines used to harvest referred to as combiners, in local parlance, are yet to arrive, further delaying harvesting.  The problem was further intensified when migrant labourers, who usually double up as agricultural workers during the harvest season, left towns for their native places after the sudden imposition of lockdown.  No Harvesters, no Labourers  Immediately after the sudden announcement of lockdown, migrant labourers had set off for their homes. Some reached while others are still stuck at various camps setup for their stay. As a result, there is shortage of agricultural labour in villages, thus delaying the harvest at a time when the temperature has already started to soar.  According to the International Labour Organisations estimates, which is based on Census 2011 figures, around 24 lakh migrants work in fields across India.  Ministry Home Affairs on Sunday said that migrant labourer will be allowed to travel for work within the state with certain conditions but will not be able to cross borders. We have permission to harvest during the lockdown, but theres no labour available. My entire family has been manually harvesting the crop since last week,"" said Raju Singh, a wheat farmer in Madhya Pradesh.  Added to this is the delay in arrival of combine harvester machines that are responsible for more than 85 per cent of the harvesting activities in the country. On an average, farmers informed, harvesting takes three days using machines. The same activity is performed in seven days when agricultural labourers use bare hands. Now, in the absence of both, farmers estimate a delay of close to two weeks.  Lack of machinery and labour has also propped up the problem of storage. As a result, farmers have decided to delay harvesting as much as possible in the absence of any directions from the government on how to manage the produce after it is cultivated.  Several farmer organisations have requested respective state governments to ensure availability of combine harvesters that are stuck in various states. They have also sought adequate space in warehouses to store their produce till they get labourers to take it to the market.  Harvester operators from north India usually go to central and western parts of the country in winter to help farmers cultivate wheat there. During this time, they return to states like Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh to help harvest the rabi crop. Farmers in Haryana said many mechanical harvesters are stuck in states such as Maharashtra, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan because of lockdown curbs.  Low Demand Resulting in Excess Produce, Plummeting Prices  Those farmers who are somehow able to harvest their crops and transport them to markets are being greeted with lack of demand in mandis. With most industrial and restaurant activity coming to a standstill, demand has nosedived, resulting in unprecedented dip in prices, especially of perishable goods.  To understand the impact of the pandemic on markets, consider this: per quintal price of gram in Maharashtra's Latur has dipped to Rs 3,650 whereas the minimum support price (MSP) for the crop is Rs 4,875. Similarly in Rajasthan's Alwar, the market price of mustard currently stands at Rs 3,600 per quintal almost Rs 1,000 less than its MSP.  In Karnataka, tomato prices crashed by over 50 per cent, from Rs 1,290 a quintal last year to Rs 560 now.  Ladies finger rates are also down by nearly 40 per cent. In Punjab, green chillies, cucumber, capsicum and cabbage are lying dumped at mandis for lack of buyers.  Farmers across Maharashtra, Punjab and Haryana informed that there are hardly any buyers in mandis. ""I have hired carriers by spending double the amount to transport my crops to the mandis but to no use. Three days since I found a sizeable buyer,"" said Mahesh Kumar Singh, a farmer in Haryana.  Devappa Anna Shetti also known as Raju Shetti, former Member of Parliament from Maharashtra and a farmer leader explained the difficulties peasants in the state are facing.  ""Not just the harvest of rabi crops, farmers have not been able to transport their vegetables to the markets for sale. Those who have, are returning with almost their entire stock. Government buying has just started. These vegetables are transported to various states. Without that, mandis in the country will have serious shortage of supply. Farmers will get no money. The lockdown will impact the famers not just for this season but will financially dent their capacity to buy for the next year as well,"" he said.  Despite these serious concerns, India may not have to go hungry in the near future.  As per Second Advance Estimates for 2019-20 released last week, total food grains production in the country is estimated at record 291.95 million tones, which is higher by 6.74 million tonnes than the production of food grains of 285.21 million tonnes achieved during 2018-19.  The production during 2019-20 is higher by 26.20 million tonnes than the previous five years (2013-14 to 2017-18) average production of food grains.",TOMATO

Villagers armed with sticks, their faces covered with fraying bandannas, blocked the road. Fearful of the spread of the coronavirus , they were determined to enforce the government's stay-at-home orders and keep outsiders from entering their hamlet.No one is paying these men. They are out here all day, every day, under the withering sun, even as the farms behind them collapse under debt.""Police or no police, we will continue,"" said Mubarik Khan, a tomato farmer who has been guarding the gates to Bhond, about 50 miles from New Delhi, for the past three weeks. ""I'm worried, we're all worried, but I feel a sense of duty to be out here.""A fractious country of 1.3 billion people where it has long been difficult to get individuals and communities to follow the rules, India has pursued its coronavirus lockdown  the world's largest  with remarkable zeal.People aren't just dutifully following the law. Many are going above and beyond it. Volunteer virus patrol squads are popping up everywhere, casting an extra net of vigilance over the entire country. Neighborhoods are imposing extra rules and sealing themselves off.The volunteer efforts could help India protect its people from the pandemic, given the state of most Indian hospitals, the enormous population and living conditions like packed slums that leave its people particularly susceptible to outbreaks.India has reported about 16,000 confirmed infections and 500 deaths, far less per capita than many richer countries. But its testing rates are also lower, and some health experts believe the virus may be lurking here and there, undetected.Many Indians are falling in line because they fear falling ill in a country with a weak health care system offering treatments they cannot afford. But the popularity of India's prime minister, Narendra Modi, explains part of the obedience. For many people here, this is Modi's lockdown, and what he says goes. His government is India's most powerful in decades, so many Indians are scared to break his rules.Praising his countrymen for behaving like a ""disciplined soldier,"" Modi has tried to cultivate a sense of fraternity under the lockdown. Recently he asked all Indians to stand in their doorways at a certain time and clap and make noise. Likewise for a nationwide candle-lighting ceremony. In both instances, millions obeyed.India's lockdown is nearly a month old, and Modi recently extended it to May 3. As it grinds on, it has won praise but also elicited concerns about overzealous enforcement, especially targeting the poor and minorities.Lower castes are being shunned more than usual. The term ""social distancing"" plays straight into centuries of ostracism of certain groups who until recent times were called ""untouchable.""Muslims, a large minority in a Hindu-dominated land, are also facing a burst of bigotry and attacks. The Indian government keeps pointing out that an Islamic seminary in New Delhi was responsible for spreading thousands of infections. Now many Indians believe that all Muslims carry a higher risk of spreading the coronavirus.""This is one of the problems of overzealousness,"" said Adarsh Shastri, a politician in the Indian National Congress , the leading opposition party. ""People get a chance to enforce the laws per their own personal prejudice.""As in the United States and other countries, the lockdown has snarled the supply chain. Farmers have been cut off from their markets, and hungry people from food.Some of these problems have been made worse by the way lockdown rules are interpreted. For example, produce trucks are supposed to be allowed to pass through checkpoints. But many Indians now fear truck drivers as virus vectors. Trucks packed with vegetables have been turned back by police officers and volunteer guards.In perhaps an acknowledgment that the lockdown has been especially tight, the government plans to encourage officially on Monday the unshackling of industries such as agriculture, rubber and tea plantations, cargo freight and water conservation projects  some of which were supposed to be open anyway. The new guidance will cover only areas without many infections.Indians across the country have followed the instructions to retreat indoors, no matter how cramped their living spaces. One member at a time emerges to get food, which is usually not every day, and always with a mask on.Still, fear keeps growing. More communities are imposing their own measures to tighten the lockdown further and all but stop the flow of people.In one case, in Delhi, a son turned in his own father for stepping outside. In another, in West Bengal state, some families who wanted to maintain social distancing asked their loved ones to sleep in trees.Neighborhood associations, especially in wealthy areas, have become extra careful. One association in Ghaziabad, near Delhi, tried to require all residents to download the government's official coronavirus app on their phones until several residents complained it was an invasion of privacy.In Jor Bagh, a New Delhi enclave of parks, birdsong and multimillion-dollar apartments, leaders of the residents' association have curtailed the movement of residents, guests and staff, barring workers like private security guards or pizza deliverymen who are supposed to be exempt from the restrictions.""I decided to go beyond the government's mandate and imposed severe measures to protect my community,"" said Sonny Sarna, president of the Jor Bagh association.Some residents grumbled about the inconvenience of not having food delivered to their doors. But those grumbles stopped after a pizza deliveryman in another Delhi neighborhood got sick and the occupants of 72 homes he had recently served were put under quarantine. Most Jor Bagh residents seem appreciative of the extra rules.In rural areas, volunteer virus squads patrol the roads day and night. Some carry sticks, sickles and pockets full of nails for puncturing the tires of cars they deem suspicious.""You can call us civil defense,"" said Monu Manesar , the head protector of his village in Haryana state.As a van approached, he shouted, ""Hey, stop! What are you carrying in there?""He peered into the van and saw boxes of bees from a honey farm.""It's a honeycomb,"" he told the three men helping him. ""Let them go.""Manesar is a district coordinator for Bajrang Dal , a Hindu nationalist group that over the years has been blamed for attacks on non-Hindus. The fact that some of these virus patrol squads include the same people who have targeted minorities in the past may explain recent hate crimes connected to the coronavirus.Nearly two weeks ago, Sahimuddin, a reserve police officer and a Muslim who, like many in India, goes by one name, was riding his motorcycle on a rural road about 40 miles south of Delhi. A group of farmers manning a barricade at one village questioned him and then called ahead to the next village to be on the lookout.As Sahimuddin approached the next village, several Hindu farmers at a barricade threw a noose around his neck and yanked him off his bike. They beat him viciously, nearly crushing his windpipe, Sahimuddin's family said. Police officers corroborated their account.He is now in a hospital, voiceless and struggling to breathe.""You don't know how much this angers me,"" said his wife, Sameena. ""Those men had no business stopping my husband.""In another community, in southern India, upper-caste residents recently dug a 5-foot-deep trench around the homes of several Dalits, the lowest on the caste ladder, to keep the communities separate.On Sunday evening, possibly as a response to the growing reports of hate crimes, Modi said on Twitter that the coronavirus does not discriminate based on race, religion, caste or creed.""We are in this together,"" he said.",TOMATO

A tomato grower and a bean farmer who could not sell their produce took the extreme step in Mysuru and Mandya districts, while another farmer, who had grown watermelon, also ended his life recently.  Though the state has announced that farmers should not face problems harvesting, selling or transporting vegetables and fruits, farmers continue to face harassment by the local police.The sealed inter-district borders have made the situation worse for the agri-community. A farmer, Chandru, had to reach out to officials in Nanjangud and Chamarajanagar to get permission to harvest his banana crop near Suttur and transport it to Kerala.  The Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha (KRRS) fears the number of suicides may go up if the government fails to intervene. KRRS president Badagalapura Nagendra said that farmers have suffered losses of Rs 50,000 crore because of the lockdown and demanded that the state government invite Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Goa, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh governments to purchase the produce directly from farmers. Otherwise, the state government can purchase it and transport it to other states.  KRRS office-bearers will hold a protest in front government offices on Monday to draw the governments attention. State Sugarcane Growers Association president Kurbur Shanthakumar said that poor supply chain and marketing by the government has pushed farmers into the death trap. Cooperation Minister ST Somashekar said the government will make efforts to see that the farm produce is sold. Officials have been directed to visit fields and assess the loss which will be paid directly to farmers, he said.",TOMATO

At the mandi, a crate of 24 kg to 26 kg was going at 100. It was roughly 5 per kg, far below my cost of cultivation per acre, says Krishnan, a tomato grower from Pillayar Agraharam.  I convinced the trader to buy, even as he was reluctant, says Krishnan. The crates that came thereafter were just lying there without any takers. You cannot blame them. Shops are closed, and markets have fewer footfalls and less demand and therefore low prices, he says.  Krishnan, with a marginal holding of one acre, only hopes he meets the cost of production. Farmers, who depend on family labour, spend around 20,000 per acre, and those cultivating larger areas and depend on wage labour incur higher costs up to 30,000 per acre.  Last year, Rayakottai, the largest tomato growing area in the region, saw low production. Tomato growers sold a crate between 1,300 to 1,100. I sold my crates for 1,300. There was less production and high demand, Krishnan says  This year, the yield is good adding to the supply, but COVID has axed the demand.  The farmers incur the vehicle rent, crate rent of 10 per crate and the commission of 10 per 100 to the mandi for each crate sold.  According to Srinivasan, owner of Rayakottai tomato mandi, there is a fall in farmers coming from afar to drop their produce at the mandi. Farmers from as far as 60 km used to come with their produce. But, it has shrunk to a 10-km radius, because they are not getting the price.  Rayakottai has over 4,000 acre under tomato cultivation. The produce cannot be sold as food for livestock too as animals take sick from overconsumption of tomato, says Krishnan.",TOMATO

The death uncovered two more Covid-19 cases linked to the Azadpur Mandi, creating panic among sellers who demanded the markets closure and initiation of containment activities. A senior district official, however, said these were not the first Covid-19 cases to be reported from the Mandi.  The 57-year-old man was confirmed positive on Monday after his sample was collected on April 19. He is a resident of Majlis Park and was admitted to a private hospital two days prior to being tested (April 17), district magistrate (north) Deepak Shinde said.  Late on Tuesday, Shinde said the number of people who would need to be put under quarantine was not yet known as surveillance teams were still preparing a list of people from the Mandi and his family who came in contact with the deceased. He had a business partner, who is also being contacted, a senior official said.  A second senior official from the district, however, said this was not the first instance that someone from Azadpur Mandi has tested positive for Covid-19.  Earlier, a tomato dealer from Shalimar Bagh and a cauliflower seller who had left for his hometown in UPs Ghonda were both found positive. So, rigorous contact tracing is on, said the official who did not wish to be named.  Meanwhile, traders demanded a complete lockdown of the market. The authorities are being very negligent about Covid-19 spread in the market. We urge the government to shut the market for the time being. We are ready to do business in the open while adhering to all social distancing norms and regulations at Japanese Park or any other big stadium, said Anil Malhotra, a trader.  The DM said the shop of the 57-year old Covid-19 deceased and its surrounding areas have been cordoned off. Other containment measures will be decided and put in place Wednesday, he said.  The Covid-19 death comes a day after the Delhi government allowed the Azadpur Mandi--Asias largest fruit and vegetable wholesale marketto operate round-the-clock.  CROWD CONTROL  Earlier on Tuesday, the first day after the governments announcement of running the Azadpur Mandi 24x7, the police and civil defence volunteers had a tough time controlling crowds as many people jumped the boundary to enter the Mandi. The situation, however, was soon brought under control as 900 civil defence volunteers (CDV) were deployed along the markets boundary.  The police have deployed drones for continuous monitoring and have warned people that violators would be booked. The market traders association has also installed loudspeakers to remind people to maintain physical distancing.  Gauging the severity of the situation in the market at a time when the city-state of Delhi, which has the second highest number of coronvirus cases in the country at 2,156, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal personally took stock of the situation and directed officials to ensure no crowding, including vehicular traffic occurs in the area.  Union minister of state (home) G Kishan Reddy also inspected the mandi on Tuesday and reviewed the arrangements in place to prevent the spread of coronavirus, while ensuring the measure achieves its purposeto help farmers sell their produce and minimise the prices of vegetables which have witnessed a hike due to the ongoing lockdown.  Senior Delhi police officers said hundreds of supply trucks and tempos queued up outside the entry gate in the early hours of Tuesday but the situation was like any other day before the lockdown. The long queues did not affect the traffic as Delhi remains under lockdown and the roads were largely empty, police said.  Under the new arrangement, which came into effect Monday night, entry of only 1,000 persons is allowed every four hours in the market. While fruits and vegetables will be sold between 6am and 10 pm, trucks have been allowed entry from 10pm to 6am. However, on Tuesday, aside from the traders and farmers, the wholesale market saw a huge rush of people who thronged the place after hearing that it would remain open 24x7.  A large number of people living in and around Azadpur came to buy vegetables and fruits for their daily needs. We are allowing entry only through tokens and e-passes, the distribution of which is highly regulated. But a lot of people entered the market by climbing its boundary walls; one side of the grilled fencing was also damaged because of people trying to break in, a senior officer deputed at the market said on the condition of anonymity.  The crowd was brought under control by late afternoon. We have deployed 900 police and CDVs all along the boundaries of the Azadpur mandi. The situation is under control, Adil Khan, chairperson of the Azadpur agriculture produce market committee, said, adding that the biggest challenge being faced was that of social distancing.  Deputy commissioner of police (northwest) Vijayanta Arya said the police have put adequate arrangements in place.  Because its a vast area that will now be active around the clock, we are using drones for monitoring. The APMC has put in place a mechanism to operate while following social distancing. It will be made sure that all vendors and customers who come are properly sanitized even during the late night hours. We have our deployment to ensure that APMCs mechanism isnt violated. Any violation that is reported will be followed by legal action, Arya said.  APMC head Khan said at least 50 public announcement systems have been procured for constantly reminding people about the importance of physical distancing and to maintain law and order.  Besides, six teams have been deployed to do continuous video recording of all activities inside the market. This is being done so people realise they are being watched and it acts as a deterrent to violate the lockdown rules. The footage also helps us think of new regulatory measures, he said.  Khan added that disinfection tunnel that was installed at the entry and exit of the Azadpur mandi has now been discontinued.  Measure comes after the Union ministry of health and family welfare in an advisory on Monday urged local administrations to avoid using disinfectant tunnels, which spray sodium hypochlorite over individuals in order to disinfect them. Spraying an individual or group with chemical disinfectants is physically and psychologically harmful, the ministry said.  The Delhi government has written to the Centre asking for a better chemical solution that could be used for disinfection of humans, Khan said.",TOMATO

Majority of farmers are cultivating brinjal, ladys finger, beans and tomato and these varieties require substantial quantum of water to give a good yield. Despite their best efforts, farmers are unable to obtain a good yield owing to summer heat. To address this issue it would be appropriate to retain the surface water for the plants to absorb them in frequent intervals apart from periodical water of plants, says a farming expert in Pernambut.  K. Rathika, a technical expert from Agro-Meteorology department, Krishi Vigyan Kendra, Vrinjipuram in Vellore, says farmers should adopt simple techniques to prevent evaporation of irrigated water from the surface soil and protect their vegetable crops.

A mimicry artist who often does comic roles in Odia films, Ravi Kumar or Black Ravi as he is known among his peers for his dark complexion, does everything --- painting trucks, walls, doing stage shows - to feed his 11-member family including elderly parents.  Last month, soon after the lockdown due to the Covid-19 pandemic was announced, Ravi added another skill set to his repertoire. He turned a vegetable vendor hawking fresh vegetables by the roadside in Bhubaneswar and then selling the same door-to-door on his cycle.  What sets Ravi and other vegetable vendors apart is the way he sells his vegetables using his mimicry skills. I sell brinjal, bitter gourd, pumpkin, tomato and parwal while mimicking Bollywood actors Nana Patekar, Amitabh Bachchan, Dharmendra and Odia comedian Jayee. That draws a lot of people, he said.  As the coronavirus pandemic turned life upside down for crores of Indians, people like Ravi who earn their livelihood through their creative skills have been forced to look for alternative careers.  I could not just wait for the lockdown to get over to start earning. When the lockdown was announced I was shooting for an Odia movie called Bali. I also used to do wall-painting and paint trucks. As there was no opportunity to do the same during the lockdown, I took to vending vegetables in Samantarapur area of Bhubaneswar, Ravi, whose unique mimicry has earned him a huge fan following, said.  The popular comedian who has acted in more than 30 Odia films, 10 daily soaps and several video albums, said he was offered money by people to do wall painting, but refused as it would have amounted to violating the lockdown. But I have a large family to feed. Apart from my two daughters, I have to look after 4 children of my deceased brother and sister-in-law and a younger brother. So I took to vending of vegetables as it is allowed during lockdown, Kumar elaborated.  Every morning, Kumar puts up the vegetable stall by the roadside till 10 am when the suns rays start hurting. He then takes the leftover vegetables on a cycle and hawks door-to-door till everything is sold. In the evening, he sells mushrooms and raw and boiled eggs by the roadside. With the money that he earns, he also supports a widow near his house.  The comedian said he is also urging other people in his locality to take up vegetable vending as an alternative profession to run their family during lockdown.  Another popular comedian Pragyan Khatua, who does a comedy show on an Odia TV channel, said Ravi is a person who would not beg before anyone. His mimicry and anchoring skills are unmatched. He has seen difficult days and knows the value of living with dignity, said Pragyan.  The lockdown while affecting the income of comedians like Ravi has dealt a huge blow to the Odia film industry, already plagued by allegations of churning out sub-standard movies. The Utkal Cine Chamber of Commerce, a body of filmmakers and producers said the lockdown would hit the industrys plans of releasing movies during the Raja festival.  We release much of our movies during Raja festival in June. Now shooting has stopped affecting the livelihood of 1,000 technicians, 800 producers and distributors, 140 cinema hall owners and 1,600 cinema hall staffers in Odisha.

Instructions have been issued to the authorities of Gandhi Hospital, the nodal centre for Covid-19 patients, to see that the Muslim community gets balanced nutritious food for Sehri (the pre-dawn meal) and Iftar (the post-dusk meal), so that they do not face any issues during the course of treatment.  According to the tentative menu prepared by the hospital authorities, the fasting Muslims would get roti, plain rice, dal and vegetable curry for Sehri which would be served at around 3.30 am. On alternate days, they would get mutton or chicken curry along with roti, plain rice and vegetable curry for Sehri.  After Iftar prayers, the Muslim patients would be served khichdi or flavoured oil rice (bagara rice) or vegetable biryani along with tomato chutney and chicken fry. On alternate days, they would be served chicken biryani, plain rice, vegetable curry, dal and eggs.  The menu has been designed to ensure that the fasting Muslim patients get loads of proteins and carbohydrates to improve immunity and provide energy needed to fight the Covid-19 disease, a hospital official said.  For other Covid-19 patients, too, the hospital authorities have been following a healthy diet chart. Starting with a plate of idli, bread and jam for breakfast, rice, sambar, dal and curd regularly. For non-vegetarians, eggs and chicken curry are also given once a day.  All patients are served with a diet that includes a mix of all dry fruits including almonds, cashews and dates. Besides, they are also being given fruits like oranges, sweet lime and bananas for immunity and instant energy.  All the patients are provided with only bottled mineral water. Beverages like tea and milk are served twice a day along with Osmania biscuits.  Health minister Eatala Rajender said the patients are served with food neatly packed in clean and fresh packets. We are also providing free WiFi and have allowed our patients to use their mobiles phones so that they can be in touch with their families, he said.",TOMATO

I left India two months ago, and have been living with my parents since  my original plan had been to take a month-long break to travel.  For the first one or two weeks of the lockdown, I cooked everything I had missed about German cooking. It was largely Bavarain cuisine and all very ingredient-focussed, from the vegetable varieties to the different cuts of meat, and the beef.  But the other day, I was feeling nostalgic for Indian foods like chole bhature and butter chicken or murgh makhani. So I made some butter chicken [and live-streamed it on Instagram]. I have already got a few responses from my followers who tried out the recipe.  The main vegetable market in Munich is somewhat like a sabzi mandi in Delhi: produce is brought here and dispatched to every place nearby. The only difference is that we get a wider, global variety of vegetables here; from Spanish tomatoes to asparagus from France, and even kumquats. So every morning, after a cup of coffee, I walk to the local vegetable market nearby to check what has been brought fresh and what is in season.  I plan my cooking based on what I see and buy here, and not vice versa. For example, I made a summer salad with strawberries and some rhubarb that I soaked in gin and sugar, since rhubarbs are a bit more sour this time of year. Pumpkins are also in season, so I made some pumpkin soup. As are white garlic and walnuts, which we use to make pestos and chutneys.  I also made babi panggang, which is an Indonesian fried pork dish that is my fathers favourite. And then, we have made shepherds pie, a Bavarian pork roast, and skrei [Norwegian cod]. We also made some homemade pasta  about five times the usual amount  and used it over a few days.  My family loves cooking, and each meal is spent discussing and planning the next. About twice a week, my mom and I cook together. She is very competent in the kitchen, and sometimes she surprises us with a Thai curry, or a spaghetti aglio e Olio pepperoncino. Everything she makes is very fragrant and spicy.  Butter chicken (serves 4); by chef Christiaan Stoop  Ingredients for the first marination (20 minutes): 900 gm chicken breast (boneless); 10 ml lemon juice; 4 gm red chilli powder; 5 gm Salt  Ingredients for the second marination (12 hours): 200 gm hung yoghurt (curd); 5 gm dried fenugreek leaves (kasuri methi); 20 ml neutral oil (grapeseed oil or sunflower oil); 20 gm ginger and garlic paste; 5gm garam masala powder  Ingredients for the tomato based gravy: 20ml oil (neutral flavour); 1 onion (chopped); 5 ripe tomatoes (chopped); 20g ginger and garlic paste; 2 pieces fresh green chillies; 30 gm cashew nuts (soaked in water for one hour); 5 gm red chilli powder; 10 gm garam masala powder; 150 ml tomato puree; 200 ml chicken stock; 80 gm butter; 80 ml cream; 5 gm dried fenugreek leaves (kasuri methi); salt; pepper  Method for marination: Cut the chicken in rough chunks. First marinate chicken with lemon juice, chilli powder and salt for 20 minutes. Next, marinate again with the hung yoghurt, dried fenugreek leaves, garam masala, oil and ginger and garlic paste. Cover and rest the marinated chicken inside the refrigerator for at least 12 hours. The longer the better.  Grill the chicken in a grilling pan. Do this with oil and in batches. You do not want to fry all the chicken meat at the same time. Fry on the highest flame so you get a nice brown colour on the chicken Ensure that the meat is cooked through and that is tender. Let the chicken chunks cool down. Set aside.  To make the butter chicken: Once everything above is done, heat a wide pan with butter and oil. Add the chopped onions and tomatoes. Fry until it gets slightly coloured. Now add your garam masala powder, ginger and garlic paste, chillies, red chilli powder and cashew nuts. Fry this till it turns fragrant. Now pour your chicken stock and tomato pure into the pan. Add salt and taste. Let this simmer for minimum 15 minutes. Let this cool down for 5 minutes and blend this mixture in a food processor or hand blender while adding your butter and cream. Once the gravy is smooth, strain it through a fine sieve. Bring the mix again into a pot and bring to a boil for three minutes. Taste and season again.  Add the chicken and simmer for another three minutes. The chicken should become hot and soft. Taste, season and finish it off by adding cream and cold butter. Garnish the butter chicken with extra fenugreek leaves and extra cream. Serve this along with rice, naan or as shown in the picture with my favourite bread, a paratha.

Despite Government assuring that farmers will be provided passes to sell their produce in markets, that has not been the case here. With weekly haats (markets) closed and transportation stopped in wake of Covid-19 lockdown, the harvested crops are rotting in farm fields. Worse, the district has no cold storage where the helpless farmers can stock their produce.  This crop season, tomatoes were grown in Hatibari, Sankarpur, Pamal and Kamakshyanagar. Farmers usually sell their stock in Bhubaneswar, Cuttack, Angul and local markets. Although farmers got a bumper yield in March, they have been unable to sell the produce as neither wholesalers turned up to procure the vegetables nor could they take the stock to markets in the absence of passes. In some areas, farmers have not been able to harvest the crop as a result of which, a majority of it has been damaged.  Farmers in Hatibari village under Gondia block currently have over 250 quintal of unsold tomatoes. Buyers are unable to come to our farms to lift the stock. Administration is yet to allow us to take the stock to markets and there is no way, we can send the tomatoes to Cuttack or Bhubaneswar, said Satrughan Tarai, a farmer of the village.  Pumpkin stocks piling up  Similarly at Shankarpur village, 12 km away from Dhenkanal, pumpkin stocks are piling up sans buyers. Here, farmers had grown pumpkin on 33 acres of land and harvested 55 tonne recently. After lockdown was imposed, farmers could not sell the produce. To save the crop from elephants, farmers collected the pumpkin stock and kept it in a fenced orchard.  We are guarding the stock round the clock but how long can we do so? A large chunk of the stock has already been damaged in the last fortnight, said a farmer Prashant Behera. Farmers said unless the district administration issues them passes to go to markets, the entire stock will be damaged.Horticulture officials, however, expressed their helplessness in dealing with the situation.

The rain has also damaged brinjal, tomato and ladies finger crops and betel vine farms over vast tracts of farmland.

The leaves have been either bruised or rotting as the vines lie scattered on the ground due to rain and strong wind.

The hailstorm, which lashed the district on Friday for hardly 30-40 minute, has undone the months of labour of horticulture farmers who are already reeling under the pain of lockdown with low demand and distressed prices.  Horticulture farmer Samra Oram (42) of Gainjor village said the inclement weather has left him worried.

Lack of harvesters, labour shortage, lacklustre storage facilities, untimely rains and a dying demand are now starting to point towards a supply constraint that may eventually manifest itself much after India expectedly emerges out of the coronavirus pandemic.  With the non-availability of machines and agricultural labour, Ramesh Prasad and his son took half-a-month to harvest their wheat farm and another three days in storing and transporting it to the 'mandi'. They have hardly been able to sell anything for the past two days.  ""There is hardly any demand. There are no takers in mandis. Prices have come crashing down,"" said Prasad, a wheat farmer from Madhya Pradesh.  Similarly, in Uttar Pradesh's Khairpur village in West Greater Noida, farmers had to either return home with their produce or sell them at negligible costs.  Santu Singh, a local farmer in the area, was forced to strike a deal at a quarter of the usual costs.  I sold chilli at Rs 10 per kilo. Normally, the selling price ranges from Rs 40 to Rs 45 a kilo when you sell on a quintal basis, he said.  Singh was forced to sell his produce because the cost of transportation is too much to handle for small landholding farmers like him.  There have also been several reports of farmers either setting their crops on fire or using it as animal fodder. Government buying is also yet to gather steam. The lockdown has impacted the pace of procurement, driving prices below the MSP (minimum support price) across Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Maharashtra even as costs incurred due to transport and harvesting have increased.  The lack of procurement is worrisome because it determines what India eats in the year to come. Conceptually, grain stocks consist of three components: operational stocks, buffer stocks, and reserve stocks. Operational stocks are the stocks from current year production meant for the consumption in the year following the harvest. Buffer stocks are meant for price stabilisation, and reserve stocks are held for meeting shortage in supply over normal demand arising due to fall in production during an agriculturally bad year.  India is, however, well off in terms of the food grain it has for this year in case a severe shortage arises. Against the requirement of 214 lakh tonnes of wheat and rice at the beginning of the year on January 1, 2020, the Food Corporation of India (FCI) had 565.11 lakh tonnes, which means roughly two-and-a-half times more than the essential requirement for public distribution. With the new wheat arrivals expected from the first week of April, India has certainly nothing to worry about on the foodgrain front.  In addition, India already has a buffer stock of 30 lakh tonnes of sugar, which the government is planning to raise to 40 lakh tonnes this fiscal. In the case of pulses, the Ministry of Food and Consumer Affairs has been trying since December to offload 8.47 lakh tonnes from its buffer stock of pulses.  To understand the seriousness of the demand dearth, consider this: a farmer in Karnataka committed suicide last week after being unable to sell his harvest because of the lockdown. Rambhavan Shukla, another farmer from Jari village in UP, committed suicide by hanging himself from a tree over the non-availability of labour for harvesting his wheat crop.  Just as farmers were dealing with the perils of the coronavirus-induced lockdown at a time when harvesting of the Rabi crop is supposed to be at its peak, untimely rains last week across most parts of north India exponentially increased their fears of a crop failure.  Hailstorms hit fields in Punjab, Haryana and parts of UP exactly when wheat and Rabi crops were starting to be harvested.  Immediately after the sudden announcement of the lockdown, migrant labourers had set off for their homes. While some reached, others are still stuck at various camps set up for their stay. As a result, there is shortage of agricultural labour in villages, which has delayed the harvest at a time when the temperature has already started to soar.  According to the International Labour Organizations estimates, based on the Census 2011 figures, around 24 lakh migrants work in fields across India.  The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) on Sunday said migrant labourers will be allowed to travel for work within the state with certain conditions, but they will not be able to cross borders.  We have permission to harvest during the lockdown, but theres no labour available. My entire family has been manually harvesting the crop since last week,"" said Raju Singh, a wheat farmer in MP.  Added to this is the delay in arrival of combine harvester machines that are responsible for more than 85% of the harvesting activities in the country. On an average, farmers said harvesting takes three days using machines. The same activity is performed in a week when agricultural labourers use their bare hands. In the absence of both now, farmers estimate a delay of close to two weeks.  The lack of machinery and labour has also propped up the problem of storage. As a result, farmers have decided to delay harvesting as much as possible in the absence of any directions from the government on how to manage the produce after it is cultivated.  Several farmers' organisations have requested their respective state governments to ensure the availability of combine harvesters that are stuck in various states. They have also sought adequate space in warehouses to store their produce till they get labourers to take it to the market.  Harvester operators from north India usually go to central and western parts of the country during winter to help farmers cultivate wheat there. During this time, they return to states like Punjab, Haryana and UP to help harvest the rabi crop. Farmers in Haryana said many mechanical harvesters are stuck in Maharashtra, Gujarat, MP and Rajasthan due to the lockdown curbs.  Those farmers who are somehow able to harvest their crops and transport them to markets are being greeted with lack of demand in mandis. With most industrial and restaurant activity coming to a standstill, demand has nosedived, resulting in unprecedented dip in prices, especially of perishable goods.  To understand the impact of the pandemic on markets, consider this: the price per quintal of gram in Maharashtra's Latur has dipped to Rs 3,650 whereas the MSP for the crop is Rs 4,875. Similarly in Rajasthan's Alwar, the market price of mustard currently stands at Rs 3,600 per quintal, almost Rs 1,000 less than its MSP.  In Karnataka, tomato prices crashed by over 50%, from Rs 1,290 a quintal last year to Rs 560 now.  The price of ladies fingers are also down by nearly 40%. In Punjab, green chillies, cucumber, capsicum and cabbage are lying dumped at mandis for lack of buyers.  Farmers across Maharashtra, Punjab and Haryana said there are hardly any buyers in mandis.  ""I have hired carriers by spending double the amount to transport my crops to the mandis but to no use. It has been three days since I found a sizeable buyer,"" said Mahesh Kumar Singh, a farmer in Haryana.",TOMATO

The states have demanded special trains to bring these workers back. These workers will be kept in special quarantine homes being set up at state borders and at district headquarters.  Pinky, 29, has been at the Gandhi Nagar shelter home in Jaipur since March 29 and is waiting to meet her four-year-old daughter at Etawah, Uttar Pradesh. She, along with her family members, were working at a cloth mill in Bhilwara, and were brought to shelter home, when they were walking back home on March 29.  My daughter with her uncle and others reached Etawah, she said, hoping that the UP government will send buses to take them home as the state did for workers in Haryana. I just want to go back home, she said.  She is not alone. Many from UP at the shelter home have registered themselves with the government helpline for migrant workers stranded in other states. UP plans to bring back a million workers from other states.  Chandradeo Singh, 22, who went to Mangalore from Jharkhands Latehar to earn a livelihood, is stuck there, along with five others. We have exhausted all the money. Workers are not taking packets of cooked food for fear of being infected by coronavirus, he said. He wants to know if the Jharkhand government bring them back home. Even if the government withdraws the lockdown, we do not have bus or train fare to reach to Latehar.  Back home, his wife said the family of six was surviving on boiled food. We get PDS ration but we do not have money to buy even vegetables or other items to cook food, she said.  The Jharkhand governments helpline for stranded workers has registered 9,48,135 workers, from close to 15,000 places across India, all of whom want to return to their home state.  Anil Sethi, 37, is among 4.9 lakh workers from Odisha who have registered with the state government portal for stranded workers outside the state. In Bangalore, Sethi, a plumber, queues up at the food centre for three hours every day, to be ladled out some tomato rice, which, he says, is not enough for five workers from Odisha, who are sharing a room.  Whatever money I saved has been spent for buying food. I called the Odisha government helpline after which local NGO persons came and gave us 2 kg rice, 500 gram flour, 250 gram rice and a cabbage for the five of us. How long can five people survive on that? he asked.  Before the lockdown, Sethi used earn Rs 400 a day and used to send half of the money back home. I never said no to any work despite not keeping well. I have two daughters at home. So I had no other way than to work hard, he said.  Nirmal Kumar, was among the five workers. He had decided to walk back from a shelter home in Gurugram to their village in Purnia in Bihar. We got food thrice a day in a shelter, but we want to return at any cost, Kumar, 23, said. However, their journey was short-lived as they caught by police in Ghitorni in Delhi and put in a shelter. The government has failed to feel our pain, said another worker from Purnia, Bambam Kumar, 22.  Arvind, 47, a worker from Bihars Samastipur, said he came to Ludhiana two months ago to work in the agriculture fields. I came here to earn something but I am sitting idle now, he said.  Around 15 lakh migrant workers from Bihar are in Mumbai, Karnataka, Himachal Pradesh, Punjab, Delhi and Haryana. The Bihar government has refused to bring them back unless the Central government gives a go-ahead. The state government has announced special assistance of Rs 1000 through the Direct Benefit Transfer system to migrant workers. We have also received 25 lakh applications seeking Rs 1,000 assistance announced by the state government and have transferred the amount through DBT mode into the accounts of 15 lakh people so far, chief minister Nitish Kumar said.  Like Kumar, Jharkhand chief minister, Hemant Soren, has requested PM Modi to direct the Union home ministry to relax the interstate travel ban so that migrant workers and students stuck in other states could be brought back. The government has transferred Rs 1,000 each to about a lakh workers, state labour department officials said.  The Rajasthan government has started bringing back migrant workers from other states. The CM has got other states on board to get migrant workers from Rajasthan back.",TOMATO

(Source: File Photo) Keep digestive disorders at bay with these easy tips. (Source: File Photo)  With most of us confined to our homes owing to the lockdown, experiencing digestive problems such as heartburn, acidity, Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease and even gastroenteritis can be common. But do not worry as we have a fool-proof plan to help you tackle these digestive ailments. All you have to do is follow these simple tips to maintain a healthy digestive system, advises Dr Roy Patankar, leading gastroenterologist and director of Zen Hospital.  Types of digestive problems that people may encounter:  Acid reflux  Acid reflux happens when ones lower esophageal sphincter (LES) doesnt function properly. The LES can be described as a ring of muscles between ones stomach and the esophagus. During the normal digestion process, it tends to open up to let food pass into the stomach, and closes to keep stomach acid out of the esophagus. But, if the LES is weak or relaxes, then acid can flow back into the esophagus causing irritation. Also, you must note that heartburn is a symptom of acid reflux. When acid makes its way into ones esophagus, the cell lining becomes irritated and pains. But remember that not all acid reflux may lead to heartburn.  Follow Indian Express Covid-19 tracker for latest updates  Heartburn is only one symptom of acid reflux. Other symptoms of acid reflux are abdominal pain, sore throat, bloating, upset stomach, nausea, difficulty in swallowing and an acidic taste in the back of the throat.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease  GERD tends to occur when ones stomach acid flows back into the tube connecting the mouth and stomach (esophagus). This may irritate the lining of the esophagus. One may exhibit symptoms such as difficulty in swallowing, chest pain, a sensation of a lump in the throat, chronic cough, lack of sleep, sour taste in the mouth and heartburn. Now, since people are at home they tend to compromise with their eating habits or sleep schedule, which could lead to the condition.  Quarantine constipation has made bowel movements irregular and painfully slow. (Source: Getty/Thinkstock) Quarantine constipation has made bowel movements irregular and painfully slow.

The symptoms are abdominal pain, cramping, an urgency to go to the washroom, vomiting and tiredness.  Constipation  Owing to sedentary lifestyle and faulty eating habits, one may suffer from constipation. Constipation can be described as having fewer bowel movements a week. The symptoms are passing hard stools, straining to have bowel movements or the inability to pass stools.  Hemorrhoids (piles)  They are swollen veins in the lower part of the anus and rectum. When the walls of these vessels are stretched, they become irritated and even bleed. Thus, it it extremely important to deal with the condition.  Tips to tackle digestive problems  Know the triggers  Make a note of the foods and beverages that give you a tough time. Maintain a journal about what you eat and drink.

Led by women, families living in apartment complexes at KNR Colony of Nizampet are taking turns to prepare food for the homeless living around the area.  They all have taken up the Food Donation Challenge thrown by Prahari Trust, a one-year-old voluntary organisation from the area.  I got this idea after watching the sari challenge on social media, whereby women posted their pictures wearing saris. It occurred to me that a challenge for food distribution would help several hunger stricken souls during lockdown, said Y. Kanaka Vardhinee from the Prahari Trust, which had already gained a reputation in the area through distribution of clay Ganesh idols, and lake protection activities.  Ms. Vardhinee and her brother Y. Raghu Rama Rao, who is the co-founder of the Trust, began modestly by serving 30 meals a day to the starving people living around the colony.  We went around the apartments close by, asking residents therein to chip in by providing cooked meals. Several people expressed their willingness, and started preparing food by turns. Those who could not prepare food at such a large scale opted to donate, and we used the money to prepare lunch in a common kitchen, she said.  The number of apartment complexes with residents willing to provide food has now risen to 15, and 50 kg cooked food, apart from fruits, biscuits, butter milk and food grains, are being supplied every day. From 30 meals, the challenge has grown to 750 to 800 meals per day, Ms.Vardhinee said.  I once provided four kg tomato rice along with butter milk and fruits, and donated money the second time. I was moved to lend my hand after reading somewhere that the lockdown is not the same for everyone, and while a few of us could afford to stay indoors without any issues, the poor are starving on the roads. This challenge has helped me to serve, said A. Udaya Bhanu, accounts officer in a private firm, who is presently working from home.  Though initially food was served in plates, after demarcation of a few areas in Nizampet as containment zones, the NGO has started delivering packed food. The number of participants is growing, and the challenge will continue up to June 3, Ms. Vardhinee said.",TOMATO

People started marching towards the bridge in ones and twos from 5 pm. They started sitting on the bridge one by one, maintaining adequate distance between each other. Some placed their bags to reserve their spot.  By 6.30 pm, both sides of the bridge were filled with people, sitting patiently while maintaining a distance between each other. This disciplined file of people consists of a mix of daily wage and migrant workers and other people who have been left jobless due to the lockdown.  They all assemble at the bridge for their dinner. As they watch the hues of orange blend with purples and red, they all share life stories. For 35-year-old Ezhumalai, Cauvery Bridge has been home for the past 20 years. Having left home (Villipuram) at the age of 15, he does odd jobs to earn a living.  ""Food was initially difficult to come by when the lockdown began. Now, we get dinner on the bridge. Breakfast is hard to get, but someone gives us lunch and dinner daily,"" he says.  Next to him are cooks from different districts of Tamil Nadu who worked in Tiruchy in hotels or as part of catering groups. Due to the lockdown, they could not return.  The bridge is their home now. A cook from Darjeeling, too, sleeps on the bridge. There are some older men who wait for food, working as construction workers, plumbers, cooks and other odd jobs - some of these men cannot return due to friction at home.  ""I have three sons, but all of them have abandoned me. So, I have been staying here for months,"" says a 70-year-old.  As they assuage each other's grief, vehicles laden with food arrive. The workers are served piping hot chapatis with dal. The food is prepared by a team from the collectorate and trusts like Gokula Samajam Charitable Trust.  Food is served to at least 400 to 500 people at the bridge, Amma Mandapam and across Srirangam.  ""We prepare food for about 140 people daily. We give lunch and dinner. We have joined hands with the collectorate since 15 days to serve food at the bridge every night,"" said K Raghunathan of Gokula Samajam Charitable Trust.  The collector's office has been preparing breakfast, lunch and dinner for these daily wage workers.  ""About 200 to 300 packets of food come from the collectorate and 200 from volunteers. Food is being served on the bridge for 15 days. It is easy for them to maintain distance,"" said K Ramachandran, Assistant Commissioner of Police, Srirangam.  Food provided includes tomato rice, sambar rice, vegetable biriyani, lemon rice, chapati, kurma and dal Police also appreciated the discipline maintained by those receiving food.

Heres how  When Chef Karishma Sakhrani found excess chives in her fridge at her home in Mumbai, she wanted to save the precious greens, knowing finding them again would be difficult during the ongoing lockdown. The MasterChef India Season 4 finalist cut them up and froze them, thus offering them a new lease of life, while also letting herself use them when she needed to in the near future.  The way we interact with food and ingredients has changed during the lockdown: more home-cooked food, more OPOS (one pot one shot) cooking, recipes of two or three ingredients, head-to-tail cooking, and, now, extending the life of ingredients to minimise food wastage.  Karishma states freezing is a new norm, given we cannot go for grocery runs frequently. It is a great way to preserve all the nutrition, and sometimes flavour and texture arent too disturbed.  Quick tips and tricks...  Chef Karishma Sakhrani | Photo Credit: special arrangement  The shelf life of ginger is between four and six weeks at room temperature, I grate and put it into a mini ice cube tray and then demould it, putting it into a ziplock bag, so I have little pre-measured cubes of grated ginger to put it into dal or whatever else I am cooking. The same can be done with ginger-garlic paste. Karishma recommends this way of preserving things one uses a lot in the kitchen  such as tamarind and raw mango  and not just during lockdown.  Yes, tis the season of the king of fruits, but due to soaring temperatures, mangoes have a tendency to ripen quite quickly. Karishma points out that slightly overripe mangoes (soft to the touch while still smelling fresh) are ideal to blend up with some yoghurt and sugar for a breakfast side or a quick pick-me-up. One can also go for lassi or the classic home-made aamras, that is ideal for the whole family and can be quickly consumed too.  Hyderabad-based culinary instructor Arundati Rao is spending her lockdown time at a farm in Shankarpalli, Telangana. She says the yellow pumpkin  common across all Indian households and easily available through the year in the South  is a prized vegetable for curries, tangy gravies or as a dry dish. If uncut, it can be stored for months, she explains, but once cut into, like a melon, it spoils fast. Steam the pumpkin and pure it, and then it can be frozen for as long as three months. The defrosted pure can be added to pasta sauces, kneaded into roti doughs or even substituted in place of banana or apple pure in your favourite cake recipe.  Converting tomatoes into a pure or pasta sauce helps sustain the ingredients usability for longer | Photo Credit: Dennis Klein on Unsplash  One particular fruit that has been overbought is the tomato, which in this heat, ripens and softens quickly. Tomatoes have a lot of versatility, comments Karishma, When they are soft and look slightly bruised, you can make a puree or a gravy, or whip up a large batch of base pasta sauce. Oven-roasting tomatoes brings out a lot of sweetness, and doesnt require a lot of hands-on time as the oven does the workload. Once roasted, you can blend them into a soup with a smoky touch.  Alternatively, excess tomatoes can be converted into a tasty tomato chutney, to be eaten with hot white rice and a dash of ghee, creating a whole new meal in itself. These home-made chutneys are the go-to options for those not wanting to part with still-usable produce, such as ridge gourd, onions and yellow cucumber.  Refrigeration hacks  A by-product behaviour of extending the life of ingredients is becoming more familiar with your fridge, and learning how to use it to its full potential. Which shelf is optimal for which ingredients? What about temperature changes? Basic tips include keeping opened foods or foods close to expiring towards the front of the fridge for quicker consumption, not overcrowding to disrupt the circulation of cold air, and keeping unfrozen meats and fish at the bottom for optimal preservation.  A vegetable lot | Photo Credit: Julian Hanslmaier on Unsplash  Our leafy greens tend to brown fast, especially coriander and mint, which are daily staples. Karishma says, I wrap these greens up in cling-wrap tightly, and roll it up so that it uses less space in my vegetable drawer, while not compromising crispness and texture. Do not keep these in the door of your fridge; they become more prone to spoiling because when the fridge is continually opened, their exposure to fluctuating temperatures speeds up oxidation. Keep less perishable foods in the fridge door.  But not everything can be saved. Preserving need not have the same mentality of panic-buying; upcycle with moderation and do not overpopulate your freezer.

Guntur district accounted for the maximum number of new cases with 29 followed by Krishna (13) and Kurnool (11).  One more case was reported from Srikakulam, where the pandemic spread for the first time last week, taking its tally to five.

On a brighter note, no Covid death was reported in the past 24 hours and 29 recovered patients were discharged in Guntur, Anantapur, Krishna and Nellore districts. The total number of patients discharged so far went up to 287, leaving 1,014 active cases.

Further, officials said efforts were on to set up two more labs at Ongole and Nellore.  By Saturday, all the three labs will start functioning, officials said, adding that nine labs are conducting tests in eight districts of the State. Apart from these labs, Truenat kits will be made available at 50 area and teaching hospitals, officials said, adding that they are in touch with the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) for getting a mobile testing lab for the State.  Officials said they were making arrangements for delivering medicines prescribed by the doctors to the callers through the telemedicine service. Officials are making sure that medicines are delivered at the doorstep of the callers within a day, officials said. Responding to this, Jagan said a joint collector rank officer shall be given the responsibility of monitoring the delivery of medicines to the callers.  The Chief Minister enquired about the status of tests conducted on the people who were identified with Covid-19 symptoms during the house-to-house survey and asked officials to complete the tests at the earliest. Till now, 12,247 tests were conducted and the remaining will be completed in the next three days, officials said. On the agriculture front, Jagan said the government has also procured maize from farmers, which was never done in the past. He also wanted officials to take steps for setting up banana and tomato processing units in the State.

While procurement efforts by the government and its agencies have left much to be desired, the lack of cold storage facilities for the perishable commodities have added to the farmers worries.  Over the last two months, there have been several instances where distraught farmers have either dumped their produce on the roads or crushed them in their fields, unable to get remunerative prices.  According to the state Horticulture Department, there are 208 cold storage facilities in Karnataka of which a staggering 194 are managed by private entities.  Only 14 such facilities are run by the Karnataka State Agricultural Produce Processing and Export Corporation Limited (KAPPEC) and the Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee (APMC).  Leaders of farmers organisations point out that the number of cold storage facilities in the state are inadequate. Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha president Kodihalli Chandrashekar criticised successive governments in the state for lacking commitment towards farmers welfare.  In Andhra Pradesh, there are 150 cold storage facilities for mango and its extract alone. Our state is one of the largest producers of mango, but we dont have such facilities, he rued.  Less demand for food in large quantity has worsened issue  MORE than 60 per cent of the tomato crop is grown in districts in and around Bengaluru  like Kolar, Chikkaballapur, Tumakuru, Ramanagara and other places  but there are no cold storage facilities. We need at least two such facilities in every taluk, he stressed.  Officials too agree that there are not enough facilities.  Since there was no proper market in the last one month, there is an excess of perishable produce available and farmers are finding it difficult to sell.  Restaurants, hotels and wedding halls, where food is usually prepared for a large number of people, are closed. Procurement of farm produce is a priority for the government, but we do not have enough funds at present, conceded an official who did not want to be named.  However, government officials claim that though there were hiccups initially when the lockdown was announced, most of the issues have been sorted out.  Horticulture Department Secretary Rajendra Kumar Kataria, who is the nodal officer for supply chain management and commodities, pointed out that Karnataka was the first state to initiate opening of food processing units.  We have around 2,000 food processing units in Karnataka and also a few in neighbouring states. Our officials are continuously conducting surveys and excess produce is being sent to these units. We are mapping farmers, their crops and nearby processing units, he said.",TOMATO

(Express photo/Prashant Nadkar) For every green half ripe tomato that was harvested, around 10 had turned yellow. (Express photo/Prashant Nadkar)  Tomato growers in Maharashtra have complained of an unidentified disease that is causing early ripening and yield loss of their crops. Entomologist Ankush Chormale, along with growers, has asked for quick action by state agricultural universities and the Agriculture department to contain the spread of the disease, which, otherwise would completely wipe out the summer tomato crop.  Grown mainly in irrigated areas of Satara, Pune, Ahmednagar and Nashik, the rabi or summer tomato is a prized crop that helps farmers in these regions earn well. Summer tomatoes are exported to Bangladesh and Dubai. Farmers normally start preparation of the crop in February with the first picking commencing late April. The crop normally feeds the market till July, after which the second or kharif crop takes over.  Ajit Korade, a farmer from Phaltan tehshil in Satara district, had noticed the problem when he started the first picking on April 20. For every green half ripe tomato that was harvested, around 10 had turned yellow. The early ripened fruits have no market and we were forced to junk them, he said. Summer tomato is not a new crop for Korade, but this is the first time he is facing this problem. An agriculture graduate, Korade had tried to control the disease by spraying the known fungicides but to no avail. Korade admits if the disease stalks large, he will be forced to abandon his crop.  Chormale, who is an administrator of a popular agriculture-related Facebook page called Hoy Amhi Shetkari (HAS), said they have been receiving reports from various parts of the state in this regard. There seems to be nothing wrong with the crop on inspection, but the problem starts when the fruit formation starts. Farmers lose their crop even before realising what went wrong, he said.  The extension unit of the Mahatma Phule Krishi Vidyapeeth, Rahuri in Ahmednagar, had conducted some field visits in Sangamner taluka of the district but the real cause of the disease is yet to be ascertained. With the ongoing lockdown and disruption of transports, farmer are finding it difficult to send samples to other testing centres. Chormale has called for quick identification of the causative organism and suggestion of measures to control the disease. With farmers losing out due to the lockdown, swift action needs to be taken to stop further losses, he said.",TOMATO

The airline, which is delivering its in-flight meals to customers in Moscow, St. Petersburg and Yekaterinburg, said the initiative was meant to provide people with the taste of travel without leaving your home.  Everything is just like on the airplane except for the view, it wrote on its Instagram page on Thursday.  Russia has closed its borders to foreigners and grounded international flights, except those repatriating Russians or returning foreign nationals to their country of origin.  Many Russians have been confined to their homes for weeks, going out only to buy food or medicine, take out the trash or walk their dog.  However, food delivery services are still functioning and the residents of major cities have made extensive use of them to replenish their provisions.  Ural Airlines service offers the staples of airline meals - chicken, meat and fish - as well as orange, apple and tomato juice. The meal is served on a traditional airline tray.

The peak season for the farmers to make some money is between March and July, when thousands of tonnes of tomato make its way to metros and other cities in the country. Now, there are absolutely no takers for this perishable commodity.  Madanapalle revenue division, which harvests high quality crops round the year, is the largest tomato growing belt in Asia, with the acreage spread over 50,000 hectares. Close to 20,000 farmers depend on the agriculture market at Madanapalle. In mid-summer, over 1,500 tonnes of tomatoes reach the market daily, commanding a minimum price of 20 to 25 a kg.  Arrivals plummet  The lockdown has crushed their fortunes, while the arrival of stocks plummeting to half, and the price ranging between 3 and 5 per kg.  Maqbool Basha, a trader who regularly sends stocks to Bengaluru, says: The hotel industry is closed temporarily, including bars, dhabas and roadside restaurants. Even a pani-puri outlet is not functioning. Who will buy the produce now?  Basha, another trader at Madanapalle market, said: The virus resulted in indefinite postponement of marriages. Birthday celebrations and post-death ceremonies are conducted unnoticed. In the absence of public gatherings, catering services are totally missing. Except for household consumption, not a single tomato is moving out.  A tomato farmer of Goodupalle of Mulakalacheruvu mandal, A.V. Eeshwar Reddy, said that hundreds of farmers had abandoned their crops unharvested. Though we have appealed to the government and the local politicians to take the crops free and distribute them to the public during the lockdown period, there is no response, Mr. Reddy said.  Tomato growers unanimously say that there is no logic in expecting any luck in the year 2020, as they feel the COVID-19 would have its devastating impact on the hotel industry for at least six months, and large gatherings would be a taboo for any function.  Cost input  To raise the crop in one acre, it would cost 1.25 lakh, in addition to the labour component from land to market. The farmers unanimously maintain that unless tomato sells at 10 a kg, it would only lead to wreckage of their entire efforts. Tomato being a highly perishable goods, with a maximum shelf-life of a week, none dares to take a risk in the market.",TOMATO

According to information, a herd of eight elephants entered the fields close to the village around Saturday midnight and devoured the standing crops of tomato and other vegetables, besides trampling a stretch of paddy.  Seeing the commotion, two cattle, tied outside a watch-hut, started bellowing. The herd moved towards the cattle and fatally trampled the duo. Though the villagers heard the agonized cries of the cattle and the wild trumpeting of the pachyderms, they remained indoors as they could not venture due to the big number of the herd.  At sunrise, the villagers found the carcasses of the two cattle. The area veterinary hospital staff reached the spot and conducted autopsy. The forest officials from Palamaner visited the spot and assured owner of the cattle that the matter would be taken to the notice of the higher officials.

In the absence of such a move, they fear that the real distress of the agrarian community will not be recognised.  This mainly pertains to perishable commodities such as vegetables and fruits, as the chaos and lack of coordination during the initial days of the lockdown, announced on March 25, saw large-scale wastage of produce.  A. Nagaraj of Raitha Mitra, a farmer-producer company, said they were just dealing with 50% of the total production while the remaining crop lay waste in the fields. The company procures vegetables directly from farmers and trades with customers, thus avoiding middlemen. But things are far from normal and vegetables and fruits are wasting away in the fields, he said.  Despite the crisis, Raitha Mitra has so far transported 134 tonnes of fruits and vegetables after directly procuring them from farmers, ensuring a turnover of 34.5 lakh and easing the woes of cultivators, said Kurubur Shanthakumar, founder of Raitha Mitra.  Raitha Mitra gets calls from farmers for a way out as many have reaped a good crop but are hesitant to incur additional cost on labour and transportation when returns are not assured.  Twin factors  The loss and wastage was due to two factors. In the first stage, and during the initial few days of the lockdown, harvested fruits and vegetables which reached the APMC marts for sale did not have wholesale buyers as there were no trucks to transport them to different parts of the State and the rest of India.  As a result, there were scenes across Karnataka of cultivators dumping their produce on the streets. Tomato farmers were among the worst affected when the buying rate plummeted to less than 5 a kg. More than 200 tonnes of tomato was dumped and lay waste at the APMC yard in Mysuru alone in the first week of the lockdown. Once the farmers realised that the delay in transportation had forced commission agents to suspend trading and that they were not getting remunerative prices, harvesting activity also was stopped. For, the cash-strapped farmers realised that harvesting their crops would only add to their net loss.  Later on, the fate of tomato cultivators came to haunt those engaged in the cultivation of fruits. Bountiful rains resulted in a bumper production of fruits, including muskmelon, watermelon, grapes, and mango, for which there are no takers owing to the pandemic.  The crop loss and wastage of fruits and vegetables was not less than one lakh crore tonnes, according to Mr. Shanthakumar, who said that in the absence of assessments, the losses incurred by farmers would remain masked.",TOMATO

When contacted, Agricultural Commissioner Suhas Diwase said action will be taken against anyone overcharging farmers.  High input costs and low returns have thrown tomato-growers of Junnar into distress, right at the beginning of the rabi season. As traders from bigger markets stay away, wholesale prices have collapsed, with farmers being forced to sell their produce at throw-out prices.  Tomato growers of Junnar take their crop during summer months, when prices of vegetable tends to be robust. Thanks to the network of five dams in the taluka, a rabi crop becomes feasible for the growers here. Narayangaons wholesale mandi is an important tomato market for traders from Mumbai, West Bengal and Delhi, among others. The produce is also exported from this market.  The lockdown, however, has thrown the trade out of gear, as traders from Mumbai and other places have remained absent from the market. Junnar farmers plant their crop in February and the first picking starts mid-April. The early crop generally fetches good return with traders, who buy the vegetable at around Rs 20-25 per kg.  However, the lockdown saw large-scale migration of traders from the mandi of Junnar. Deepak Bhise, the chairman of Junnars tomato growers association, said mostly traders from Mumbai, Delhi and West Bengal trade in their market. Due to the lockdown, none of the traders from the bigger markets were present, he said. Thus, when the arrivals are picked up, growers were forced to sell at the rate of Rs three to five per kg. Farmers normally sell their produce in crates of Rs 20 kg each. Stoppage of road transport to Bangladesh has also had its effect, as the produce from Junnar goes to the neighbouring markets.  What has foxed Bhise and other growers is that tomatoes priced at higher rates are fetching markets of Mumbai and Pune. This does not make sense  the district authorities should ensure our producers are at least able to get back their cost of production, he said.  As if the crash in prices was not enough, farmers also have to bear with the sudden increase in input costs. A 45 kg back of urea, which before the lockdown was priced at Rs 270, is now being sold at Rs 320. Similarly, complexes like Nitrogen Phosphorus and Potassium (NPK), which were retailing at Rs 1,100 per kg, have now been appreciated to Rs 1,320.  The story is the same with fungicides and pesticides, which are necessary for tomato crop, Bhise said. He added that no district authorities were available for lodging complaints in this regard.  When contacted, Agricultural Commissioner Suhas Diwase said action will be taken against anyone overcharging farmers.",TOMATO

Employees at a Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC) run relief centre near Basin bridge have been wary for the past three days as the facility had not been sealed despite three revenue department officials, posted in the Royapuram zone (zone 5), tested positive. They had been working at the facility Babu Manikkraj, president of GCC workers union affiliated to DMK, has filed a complaint with senior officials at the GCC headquarters. On Saturday morning as well, food items like tomato rice and tea had been sent from the centre, he said.  This centre handles food and the officials were involved in distribution of food. It is a major concern among employees, as they fear of having been infected, he said. Food parcels from this camp have been sent to other community centres as well.  Based on information from staff working there, Babu Manikkraj said physical distancing norms were not being followed. The employees havent been tested yet. Our main concern is that the relief centre is still open he said. GCC is following norms to shut down buildings if cases are found but not following the rule for its own buildings, he said.  A senior official at the headquarters, however, said the information was false.  It is true that the officials tested positive, but the source is not the relief centre. Morevoer, they were only in charge of overseeing the work and not involved in distribution of relief, the official said.  Another official at the zone said the relief centre has been shut down and the cooking there stopped.  The building was closed down on that day itself and moved to a school nearby. An Amma canteen near the building has also been closed down, the official said. Sources said all the 40 people taking shelter at the facility had tested negative and that GCC officials had planned to take them elsewhere due to the reported cases.

He was taking a consignment of cosmetics from Chennai to Kathmandu , but after 48 hours of driving, he had to abandon the truck in Faridabad and return to his hometown on March 30 because of the lockdown At home, the situation was grim. I could manage for around two weeks but after that, I had to look for work. After requesting a fellow villager Mohammed, I was allowed to help in his tomato farm for Rs 300 per day, he said.Akram Khan, 28, who finds himself in the same boat as Akhlaq, says he has been a driver for a decade and had never worked in a farm before. He found the work so difficult that initially, he wanted to quit even though he had exhausted the advance received from his employer. But for the sake of my family, I am continuing and will have to keep at it to feed them, he said.Like these two men, hundreds of truck drivers in Nuh, which has roughly one lakh truckers, are forced to work as farm hands , helping in harvesting and storing crops, to earn their daily wage, as they are stuck in their hometowns without a salary due to the movement restrictions.Thirty-year-old Khushed Ahmad of Karheda village, for example, says his employer has refused to transfer more money after the advance made to him, and even though border restrictions might be relaxed, it is impossible for him to reach the destination with the existing funds. He, too, was going to Nepal to deliver spare parts.Even after reaching Nepal, we have to wait for around 10 to 12 days at the border, and during this period, we have to manage our own expenses, he explained.Apart from the drivers, the lockdown has left every stratum of the logistics industry a little frayed. Daljeet Kumar, the owner of a transport company, said they are also reeling under financial burden.We had already paid drivers, we have to pay EMI for the trucks and also bear other expenses. In this situation, we are not in a position to shell out another penny, and if the consignment is not delivered, the client will not release the payment, creating a vicious circle of monetary strain, he said.Rajuddin Jung, a local social worker, said transport companies are impervious to the plight of the drivers and are pressuring them to deliver the consignment ever since inter-state movement was allowed.

The cooling unit, which only needs water and does not run on electricity, keeps vegetables fresh for longer, which means farmers dont have to sell their produce at throwaway prices.  Named the Subjee Cooler, the cooling unit has been designed by RuKart Technologies, founded by Vikas Jha. Subjee Cooler works on the principle of evaporative cooling and does not require any utilities. However, it requires watering, once daily. The cooling chamber temperature is lower than the ambient temperature by a margin of 5-15C (depending on ambient relative humidity) and maintains a high relative humidity of above 85-90% inside the cooling chamber. The low temperature and high humidity inside the chamber preserve the (non-tuber) vegetable crop for five to eight days, said Jha, a 2016 graduate of IIT-B.  RuKart Technologies  with the help of the trade union Self-Employed Womens Association  has set up 66 such cooling units for farmers in Bihar, Odisha, and Maharashtra. Its working on an order for 200 more instalments, said Jha.  During the lockdown, the agricultural sector has been among the worst hit. Farmers with no storage facilities have been compelled to undersell crops at throwaway prices. However, Praphula Kido, a tomato and cabbage cultivator from Sundargarh in northwest Odisha, is among those who got good prices for his tomatoes, thanks to the Subjee Cooler at his one-acre farm. He now earns Rs 25-30 per kilogram (kg) of tomatoes as opposed to the Rs 7-8/kg that many other farmers have to settle for since their produce is not as fresh.  Jha said farmers with Subjee Coolers are able to charge prices that are 2030% higher than others. Earlier a farmer would harvest vegetables only once in a week, the day before the weekly market. Now an adopter [farmer with Subjee Cooler] harvests the vegetable thrice a week and stores their produce. While our adopters are selling their produce to middlemen as well as consumers at the weekly market directly, non-adopters are selling their produce only to middlemen, he said.",TOMATO

Vishwanath, a mechanical engineer, also owns a food processing unit. His company is a pioneer and holds a patent for arecanut dehuskers.  My company exists, thanks to farmers. I had to do something to pull them out of trouble. When the district administration approached me, I readied a sample in 24 hours but it was not perfect. YouTube instructions are not the most accurate and we got it 60% right, he laughs.  So Vishwanath turned to Suresh Bhatt, who has been making sweets for weddings and other functions for 30 years. Suresh pointed out where they were going wrong. Now Vishwanath has around eight to 10 women working on the petha. At the moment, we are manually cutting two tonnes of the gourd. Our target is 10-15 tonnes once the machines take over. We are learning by trial-and-error. I have tasted the pethas but had no idea they were made from gourds grown in my region, says Vishwanath.  The process from start to finish takes 72 hours and needs precision. The gourd is cut, washed, soaked in lime for several hours, then again thoroughly washed and boiled. The sugar syrup is made to just the right consistency. The sugared pieces have to dry. We cannot keep them out as even a drop of water will lead to fungus.  Vishwanath is buying ash gourd from farmers in need of sales within 10-15 kilometres radius from here. They have no money to harvest, or transport... I am reaching out to them.  But just making pethas does not solve the problem. One is unsure how much of it will sell, and 2,000 tonnes cannot all be converted into the sweet. So they are working on a marketing campaign. We plan to send ash gourds to Bengaluru. I have spoken to contacts at various apartment blocks and gated communities.  They have requested residents to buy the ash gourds and distribute them to anyone who is struggling to put food on the table.  To know more, call 9900602529. Mail: info@hingaara.com",TOMATO

124,124.0,,,2020-05-17,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-farmers-get-a-better-deal-after-recent-reforms/story-8wrOzXKTL7J94cuInodOmK.html,"The government has announced major agricultural policy changes as part of the economic package it has unveiled in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. These include deregulation of farm foods from the Essential Commodities Act (ECA). Farmers have also been allowed to sell their produce outside government-regulated markets, or Agricultural Produce Market Committees (APMCs).  The move has been celebrated by important voices. The crux of such arguments is twofold. One, laws such as ECA are irrelevant now because we are no longer a food-scarce economy. And two, it will allow farmers greater freedom in selling their produce. This is expected to guarantee better prices. Both these arguments have problems.  India has moved from a food-scarce economy to a net exporter of food. However, food production does not guarantee food security. Affordability is what matters. In the early years of economic reforms, India thought affordability will not be a problem. A universal Public Distribution System (PDS) was diluted into a targeted programme. This was reversed to enact the National Food Security Act (NFSA) in 2013. The NFSA covers two-thirds of the population as beneficiaries. It was passed by a Congress-led government and continues to be implemented by the Narendra Modi government. This bipartisanship is driven more by realpolitik than ideology. It is a recognition of the fact that a large part of our population still cannot afford food from the free market. In case of cereals such as rice and wheat, the government directly procures and then provides subsidised food. For other important crops, it uses a mix of policies including price and export controls and, sometimes, even usurping marketing activities when prices rise.  Any blanket deregulation of agricultural markets requires an end to these policy interventions. In normal times, this will go unnoticed. But what happens when prices rise? Will a government cite its commitment to reforms and refuse to intervene when onions sell for more than Rs 100/Kg like they were a few months ago? That, in a price- sensitive political economy, will have adverse political and electoral consequences.  A story in The Indian Express cites NITI Aayogs Ramesh Chand to suggest that the latest deregulation will be rolled back in times of a price hike. Such price increases will have to be at least 100% year-on-year at an all-India average retail level for vegetables (onion and potato) and 50% in the case of non-perishables (grains, oilseeds, etc), he said.  The Centre for Monitoring Indian Economys database gives monthly all-India retail prices for essential commodities since 2010. Inflation in potato, onion and tomato prices breached the 100% threshold 21 times between January 2011 and April 2020. For non-perishables including 15 items of cereals, pulses, edible oil and sugar, inflation breached the 50% barrier 48 times during this period. So, the government would have had to revoke this reform 69 times in the past 120 months, according to this suggestion. This cannot be the basis for sustainable reform.  Lets look at the question of farmers not being allowed to sell to buyers of their choice. The claims of Indian farmers being caught in the clutches of a single buyer in the form of APMCs is not supported by data. The National Sample Survey Office released a report on Key Indicators of Situation of Agricultural Households in India. It is based on a survey between January-December 2013. It gives a break-up of farmers reporting sales to different buyers. For 31 crops sold between July 2012 and June 2013, local private traders were the single biggest buyers for 29 crops. Mandis, not all of which would be APMCs, were the biggest buyers in just two crops; arhar in the kharif season and gram in the rabi season. Except in soybean, the share of farmers selling their crops to Mandis did not even exceed 25% for any crop. These figures tell us the true picture of Indias agricultural markets. The private sector has already surged ahead of the APMCs without any reforms. And the farmer is well aware of this change.  Does this mean that farmers will get better prices? Not necessarily. The number of buyers is not the only determinant of pricing power. Bargaining power also matters. This is where Indian farmers face their biggest handicap. Abolition of APMCs could make way for bigger corporate penetration in Indias food markets. But this does not guarantee that farmers will get a better deal. While such corporate players could be competitors at the macro level, thanks to their deeper pockets, they might be even bigger and stronger monopsonists at the local level.  This makes the worst possible outcome entirely possible. The farmers might be left on their own to deal with perhaps a bigger monopsonist than they were faced with when the prices are low. And, when they do go up, the government will bring back controls in the name of food security.",TOMATO

Madhuri Aggarwal @ msaggarwal  There has been a noticeable spike in the traffic on my Instagram handle during this lockdown. People have been reaching out for basic soul food and baking recipes as everyone has some time on their hands. I have been concentrating on putting up more easy-to-do recipes with basic, commonly available ingredients, rather than putting up recipes with exotic ingredients.  Minimalist frames  I have had to reinvent the way I style a frame and shoot a photograph within the confines of my home. I cannot afford to waste ingredients through the lockdown for the purpose of elegant shot compositions; so I have resorted to minimalism in my frames and there is so much that I am learning about this style of food photography.  Anjana Palaniappan  The lockdown has left me incapacitated in many ways. On the one hand, as a restaurant reviewer, I havent been able to visit restaurants for over seven weeks now; on the other, the unavailability of several heavily relied-upon ingredients put me at a severe disadvantage as a home cook. I have been left with no option but to reinvent my blogger self.  I recently read about how working professionals are having trouble balancing household chores and work through the pandemic; that is when I decided to step up and share my recipes and food hacks with the world. A lot of people have enjoyed the series, featuring the under 30-minute recipes showcased in a minimalist frame. I have been able to put together many palatable recipes, using just my pantry essentials. We made ricotta and all it took was some milk, cream and lime juice. In a similar manner, I have also been able to put together salted caramel, chilli oil, paneer, stir fry sauces, etc., from scratch.  Priya Subramani Vivek @hungryChennaifoodie  When the lockdown was announced, it didnt really press pause on my blogging routine. I continued posting images of my homecooked meals to keep my followers engaged. Over time, I realised that I had the duty of keeping them informed too. So I started sharing pointers about the availability of essentials, locally-sourced veggies, and social distancing.  I have been noticing a slow yet steady spike in the traffic on my page. With a lot of people stuck indoors and having to cook for themselves, pages like mine have become their go-to spot for guidance. Initially, it was quite challenging to get used to the minimal resources; now, it has become a way of life. Quarantine has pushed me to become experimental and sustainable. For instance, I made kuzhi paniyarams with leftover dosa batter, sandwiches and noodle samosas with available ingredients.  Fuss-free cooking  Making meal plans for the week with the ingredients available in the pantry, prepping your veggies a day ahead and storing it in the fridge for fuss-free cooking are some of the pointers I keep reiterating to my followers, to make cooking during lockdown a less tedious process. Make use of pulses, they are versatile and you can sprout them and use it in breakfast, salads, raitas and much more.  Uma Raghuraman @Masterchefmom  My followers often request me to share two kinds of recipes  anything that is quick to make but tasty, and recipes that are healthy and will detox the taste buds. The first kind of recipe requests have been popular among youngsters (students and working professionals) who are now forced to cook for themselves and their roommates, and mothers who want to satisfy the taste buds of their children. I have been focusing on creating recipes that can be made with minimal ingredients but deliver health and taste. My detox rasam, herbal relish and protein dosa are some examples. I have also taken a lot of time out to engage with my followers and respond to all the queries. I am happy to see a lot of people, who otherwise never bothered to enter the kitchen trying their hands at cooking. In this process, I am learning too.  Humble recipes  Indian vegetarian cooking is beautiful. With just minimal ingredients, one can make a great dish. That is precisely what I did with the tomato masiyal  a combination of tomatoes and arhar dal. The recipe became a huge hit. I had more than two hundred people making the humble recipe and sharing pictures and feedback. My motto is to share simple, healthy, tasty recipes from my kitchen to yours, with love.  Akrithi Jain: @plates of flavor  When the lockdown was imposed, I wanted to keep my followers engaged with quality content while being mindful of the limitations. But, there was criticism too  about how food influencers and food enthusiasts are not being mindful of the situation. Some opined that this isnt the time to prepare meals and share images on social media because many didnt even have food or ingredients at home. I took it upon myself to address the situation, explaining that this was a tough time for all and that people should be allowed to do what helps them cope with the pandemic. Soon, the criticisms died out. This experience helped look beyond food and aesthetic photographs. I am also collaborating with fellow bloggers for live sessions and for pasta potlucks. We virtually cook together and share recipes while indulging in conversations with our followers. Its become important to engage ourselves, share and learn from each other.  Ektha Kothari: @Foodtalk_Chennai  The lockdown ushered in a sense of uncertainty. While it meant that I cannot restaurant hop, explore new eateries and share new content every day, I realised that it was more important to be socially responsible now than ever. So I decided to share information about social distancing, how one can safely procure and store vegetables and provisions, and so on. I decided to give my followers a glimpse of whats cooking in my kitchen. I started preparing homecooked meals, posting recipes, sharing exclusive 4 pm and 2 am binge recipes. I have been sharing recipes that can boost peoples mood and, at the same time, satiate their hunger. As part of the quarantine cooking sessions, I also flagged an Instagram live event  a potluck party of sorts, wherein I go live along with a follower. He/she will take us into their kitchen, cook a dish and share the recipe with everyone. This has become a very important platform for home chefs who otherwise dont get a chance to showcase their skills. So far, I have conducted 10-12 live sessions. The aim is to tide through this pandemic  alone but together.  A time of rediscovery  From whipping up a delicious chowmein recipe with just coriander and pudina chutney to turning methi theplas into taco shells, I have had the chance to experiment. What makes this process wholesome is sharing the experiences with the followers, encouraging them to try something new.  Shanthi Ramachandran: @shaanthram  Over the past two months, I have been noticing an increase in the traffic that my page has been receiving. People from across the globe have been accessing my recipes. Interestingly, some have scrolled down my Instagram page and tried recipes that were posted even over a year ago. The one-pot-one-shot recipes are the ones that have been the most tried ones as it needs minimal ingredients and not too much effort or expertise. Being mindful of my followers needs and requirements, I started posting immunity booster recipes that can be made with available ingredients. Minimalistic dishes like the traditional morkali and dibba rotti have been tried by hundreds of people. With everyone stuck indoors, live sessions have become the new normal. Ive even judged a few virtual cooking competitions in collaboration with other influencers.  Beyond the gram  I have been able to help those in need by reaching out to my followers and the foodie community. For instance, when I found that a few trusts and NGOs for the elderly and the Cancer Institute (for chemotherapy) were in need of funds, I shared the news with my followers. Everyone was proactive in offering help. A follower from the UK reached out to me and offered to transfer 4,000 (approximately Rs 3 lakh) to all three institutions that I was campaigning for.  Sreya Vittaldev: @darthdevi  I have been staying true to who I am, so there was no concept of reinvention. However, what I did do is find better ways to put out my recipes more detailed, aesthetic and crisper Instagram stories. I also did a video; since then, I have received a lot of video requests. Its always been a dream to host a cookbook club; so, I started one for Bengaluru with fellow food-blogger Monika Manchanda. This has been quite enriching. Ive been able to connect with many food bloggers, authors and other cooking enthusiasts. I share verified sources of information about how to clean veggies but, most importantly, I ask my followers to support local businesses/small scale businesses. The past few weeks, Ive been doing a lot of healthy cooking and sharing the same.  Love your leftovers  2020 is the year for remixing all of our leftovers. Dont throw away your meat bones after eating; wash and store them to make stock. Also, you dont need to make popular food to be validated, its fine if you didnt make dalgona coffee or sourdough. And lastly, always wrap your greens in a damp paper towel; it lasts longer.",TOMATO

Today, I sold tomato at 60 per crate (containing 22-24kg) to the local traders as no buyers from Delhi are coming to our area due to the lack of demand amid Covid-19 lockdown, said Ajay Kumar, a young farmer from Ladwa in Kurukshetra district.  Moreover, the tomato growers have predicted further drop in rates as it is just the beginning of harvesting, which will be at its peak in the next two weeks.  Worried, the farmers have started dumping their harvest stating that the prices do not even cover the charges of transporting the crop to Delhi or any other big vegetable markets.  A crate of tomato is being sold at 80 in Delhi, but transporting one will cost 40. This will incur a profit of only 40 for 22kg of tomato, said Om Prakash, a farmer from Dhanokheri of Karnal district.  Haryana horticulture department director general Arjun Singh Saini said, To protect farmers from losses, the government has extended the deadline of registration under the Bhavantar Bharpai Scheme, which assures prices of 5/kg.  However, farmer Mahinder Singh from Yamunanagar said, The governments support is not sufficient as 5/kg price for 140 quintals does not cover even the input cost, which is around 70,000/acre.  Ram Kumar from Bhiwanis Kharkhari Makhwan village said, Even with compensation of 1/kg, I will bear a loss of 60,000/acre. So, I have dumped my produce in the field, allowing cattle to graze on it. He and with 50 other farmers from his village have been sitting on a dharna since May 15 demanding hike in the minimum support price of tomato.  Bhiwani deputy commissioner Ajay Kumar said he will raise the issue with senior officials.  ABHAY CHAUTALA MEETS PROTESTING FARMERS  Ellenabad MLA and INLD general secretary Abhay Singh Chautala on Monday met the protesting farmers in Bhiwani. He alleged that they were forced to dump crop due to governments poor policies.  They should be given compensation of 60,000/acre. If the state fails to do this, the grief-stricken farmers will shift towards old crops, which are not profitable. I will raise this issue with the chief minister and officials concerned, Abhay said.

The Government Arts College in Hosur was swarming with migrant workers, who would board the first train from Hosur to Uttar Pradesh that afternoon.  A group of Muslim men, some with skull caps, visibly exhausted, and armed with laptops were keying in Aadhaar numbers on an excel sheet for each of the migrant workers. There were over 1,000 migrants with the last of their belongings. The volunteers from the Muslim community were at it since the previous night, liaising between the officials and the workers, in Hindi, in the holy month of Ramzan.  Another team from the community was preparing over 1,800 food packets of tamarind rice and lemon rice with heavy dose of ground nuts, and chappatis with tomato chutney in their kitchen, in addition to the food that was being packed by the Hosur Corporation for the migrant workers in the central kitchen of Amma canteen. Water bottles, fruit drinks, biscuits were part of the goodies along with food distributed to the travelling migrants.  On Thursday, at 1.50 p.m, when the first train chugged out of the platform of Hosur railway station, this band of youth after clocking volunteer work non-stop for over two days and nights clapped to cheer the smiling, home-bound migrant workers.  When the pandemic acquired a communal colour in some parts of the country, this group, with the support of various jamaaths of Hosur channelled their energies into COVID relief in the industrial town.  Their presence was a shot in the arm for the Hosur Corporation and Hosur revenue administration  both faced with a short window of contacting over 1,600 workers on Tuesday evening, when the train schedule arrived and arranging for food. Faced with the mammoth task of contacting the migrant workers registered in the nonresidenttamil.org website to go home, Hosur tahsildar K.Venkatesan took the help of these volunteers of COVID relief.  When we look back, it feels good, says Abdul Hadr, one of the coordinators of the volunteering community youth.  We have a strong tech team. On Tuesday, within a span of three hours, we made 400 plus calls to UP workers. Since then, they had also made 700 calls to Jharkhand workers and 1,200 calls to Odissa workers, to organise them for the forthcoming trains, next week. Abdul Hadr and his brother Abdul Bari, who run a Trust, organised with the support of various jaamaaths of the Hosur.  Their band of youth, resourceful, highly qualified, and employed as doctors, techies, have been doing COVID relief work distributing cooked food and dry rations. Our friends across the globe contributed funds to feed people here, says Hadr.  Perhaps their first push came in the early days of COVID from Abdul Hadrs sister, a dermatologist at the Hosur government hospital. It was still early days of COVID and there were no PPEs. When we found that the doctors were apprehensive of seeing patients without protective gear, we supplied PPEs and N-95 protective masks for all the doctor of the GH.  When cross border movement of people continued, their communitys kitchen ran overtime, providing 300 packs of hot cooked dinner at the inter-State checkpost to feed the walkers.  In all this, the ingenuity of the local Hosur Corporation, led by its Commssioner K.Balasubramaniam, also stood out. Mr.B alasubramaniam roped in all the help that was needed. On Thursday morning, as the first load of breakfast for migrant workers left the central kitchen of Amma canteen, Hosur Commissioner was also relieved that the train was arriving late. Otherwise, we could not have prepared meals for 1,600 people. They would go hungry for two days in the train, he said. Simultaneously, he made calls to the biggest garment stores asking them to provide bags to put in the food packed for the workers.  We will get a call from the border post saying there are people without food. There will be some rava in the kitchen, and Ill call them to whip up some upma, says Mr. Balasubramaniam. For him, the lockdown if any, ensured full square meals for the sanitation workers. Earlier, they were not entitled to food from the canteen. Now, they get to eat full, and their work load has reduced considerably, says the Commissioner.  Without the officials, none of this would be possible, says Hadr underlining the need for decentralising and delegating relief work and embracing help from all quarters without redtape. Sundaramoorthy sir, please come, he called out introducing the sanitation inspector. He readily came to inspect the kitchen to ensure food safety of the meals for the migrants. They trusted us, delegated work, and we did it. I would call it the joint effort of all.  On Thursday afternoon, when the train was about to leave, these officials and volunteers receded to the background and optics gained foreground. A railway police officer scurried along the platform looking through the windows. He finally stopped at the window of a Muslim woman and asked her to say something, while he recorded a video on the phone. The officer asked me to thank the Railway Minister for sending a train, said the woman, who had covered up her face for the video.  Tamil Nadu government paid 920 for the workers and ensured they had left the State with dignity and their stomachs full, said an official.  On May 25, when a Jharkhand train would come to fetch the migrant workers to their State, this community of volunteers plan to celebrate Eid with the migrants on the platform.",TOMATO

Said to be the countrys first such seed portal from a public sector unit in horticulture with a wide range of seeds, it offers more than 60 high-yielding varieties of seeds for vegetables, flowers and fruit crops. Though the ICAR-IIHR seed portal (https://seed.iihr.res.in) was launched by Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) Director-General Trilochan Mohapatra during the National Horticulture Fair organised by the institute on its campus this February, it has become functional now.  According to institute director M.R. Dinesh, the portal aims to take the institutes quality seeds to even remote places of the country which do not have access to quality plant material through this portal. This helps in increasing productivity of horticultural crops as all our seeds are high yielding and have resistance to several diseases, he said.  Pointing out that IIHR has adopted a novel seed village concept of using skilled farmers to produce seeds, he said the income of farmers who are into seed production is also bound to increase thanks to the seed portal. Environment protection will also get a boost as the use of pesticides will reduce since IIHR varieties have resistance to many diseases, Mr. Dinesh said.  K.K. Upreti, principal scientist and nodal officer of the Agricultural Knowledge Management Unit of the institute, said the institute produces over 15 tonnes of seeds of fruits, vegetables and flower crop varieties annually for sale to farmers. The sales are expected to increase by 20-25% now. When a farmer registers online for buying seeds, he will also be told whether the location is suitable for cultivation of such a variety, he said. In the coming days, the institute also plans to provide counselling on cultivation practices. It has prescribed norms on maximum purchase of each variety, to ensure that quality seeds are available to a large number of farmers.  IIHR has branded all of its seeds with the prefix Arka, as it is located on the banks of river Arkavathi. Some of the popular varieties of vegetable crops developed by the IIHR include tomato (Arka Rakshak), chilli (Arka Meghana), onion (Arka Kalyan), ridge gourd (Arka Prasan), French beans (Arka Arjun), and okra (Arka Nikita and Arka Anamika).",TOMATO

This year, farmers have started reporting early ripening, yellowing and distortion of fruits, which ultimately led to massive crop loss.  A variety of viruses are to blame for the ongoing early ripening of tomatoes in Maharashtra, a report released on Friday by the Indian Institute of Horticulture Research (IIHR) Bengaluru stated. The disease, which was first reported in tomato-growing zones of Satara, Ahmednagar and Pune, had resulted in farmers reporting heavy loss for a crop which otherwise ensures a steady income for them.  Farmers, especially in Nashik, Satara, Ahmednagar and Pune, normally take the summer or rabi tomato in the months of February to July on assured irrigation sources. The kharif or monsoon tomato is taken mostly in Nashik and feeds the market post July. This year, farmers have started reporting early ripening, yellowing and distortion of fruits, which ultimately led to massive crop loss. Visual inspection had not shown any indication of pest attacks, which had baffled farmers.  The Agriculture Department had sent samples of the affected crops to IIHR for testing. The report confirmed the initial prognosis of a viral attack. The IIHR had tested the samples for 12 major viruses, including the cucumber mosaic virus (CMV), chilli veinal mottle virus (ChiVMV), groundnut bud necrosis virus (GBNV), potato spindle tuber viroid (PSTVd), tomato leaf curl Bangalore virus (ToLCBV), tomato lead curl New Delhi virus (ToLCNDV), tobacoo vein distortion virus (TVDV), tomato chlorosis virus (TCV), tomato mosaic virus (ToMV), tomato chlorosis virus (TCV), tomato mosaic virus (ToMV), tomato brown rugose fruit virus (ToBRFV), tomato ring spot virus (TRSV) and tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV).  The report  a copy of which is with The Indian Express  showed that the samples had tested positive for CMB, GBNV, TCV, ToLCNDV, TbVDV and ToMV. Most of these viruses, the report stated, were transmitted by aphids and whiteflies. The report has recommended setting up of a special investigation team to study the problem in depth, and come up with appropriate agricultural practices.  Suhas Diwase, Agriculture Commissioner, said a special team of scientists will be constituted from Mahatma Phule Krushi Vidyapeeth (MPKV), Rahuri, to come up with practices for tomato growers in the state.",TOMATO

The only exception is the potato, which at just under Rs 20 a kg on average, is almost double what it sold for in May last year.TOI looked at wholesale prices of the 15 most common veggies across 19 states and found that prices of all of them, barring potatoes and lemons, had fallen in almost all the states. To discount for seasonal variations, TOI also compared prices with last May, and found the fall to be even sharper (even lemons were way more expensive in May 2019).With state borders sealed, and supply chains hampered, what possibly led to the crashing prices was distress sale of perishable veggies and a sharp drop in demand.""Disruption of supply chain during the lockdown is among the major reason of this collapse in prices,"" said Ashok Gulati, chair professor for agriculture at ICRIER, a policy think-tank. ""If we take onions, the lockdown coincided with the rabi harvest season. That crop could not be transported at that time and is now reaching the market. This has led to the crash in prices,"" he added.Raj Kumar Bhatia, general secretary of the Chamber of Azadpur Fruit & Vegetable Traders (Delhi's biggest mandi), said, ""Our supplies were largely intact but some northern states like Punjab and Himachal Pradesh enforced a strict lockdown. Azadpur mandi is their biggest supplier. And our vehicles could not cross over. So, there were incidents of distress sale.""Bhatia added that the situation could have been better had there been clearer guidelines for local vendors who procure from Azadpur Mandi and supply to Delhi's local markets.Officials from APMCs (Agriculture Produce Market Committees) in the southern states, however, said their supply chains were not disrupted and the crash was probably because of a sudden drop in demand from bulk buyers like restaurants and hotels.Also, the fact that several events like wedding feasts were put off led to a lower demand. The steep fall in wholesale prices, however, hasn't translated into a proportional fall in retail prices, which vary significantly across markets and outlets.So, farmers' income has fallen while consumers haven't benefited fully. It's the middlemen who have raised their margin.The average wholesale price of bhindi, or ladies' finger, (calculated by the government's Agmarknet portal that tracks agricultural marketing) was Rs 3.9 per kg in Chhattisgarh, down 84.6% from March 2020 and 57.3% lower than last May. While Chhattisgarh saw the sharpest drop, prices fell the least in Kerala and Karnataka.Prices of karela (bitter gourd), too, fell in all states, the sharpest - 60% - in Punjab and Haryana. It was the same story for bottle gourd, whose prices crashed everywhere except Kerala and Karnataka.The pricey capsicum was also humbled, selling at Rs 4.4 a kg in Punjab, down over 77%.Garlic prices have also fallen in all states; so have green chillies, which went into a free fall in most states. Onion prices have fallen in all states while tomato is also being sold at lower prices in most of the major states.Prices of brinjal, cabbage, ginger, cucumber and cauliflower showed mixed trends - falling in some states while rising in others.",TOMATO

Anantapur Superintendent of Police Yesu Babu along with a posse of police officials were waiting at the Guntakal station with a sumptuous meal of 300 packets of biriyani, 100 packets of jeera rice, 200 packets of tomato rice, 150 packets of upma, 3,500 packets of biscuits, 1,600 packets of buns and 1,500 bottles of water.  Mr. Babu said all these were readied within two hours on getting a call from Chennai City Police Commissioner A.K. Viswanathan.  The Bhoomika Trust informed Mr. Viswanathan about the labourers position and he contacted the Guntakal SP requesting him to arrange the food items.  Mr. Viswanathan also gave personal assurance that the amount for providing the food would be reimbursed.  However, Andhra Pradesh DGP, getting wind of Guntakal SPs gesture, refused to accept to take the money for the food supplied as a mark of goodwill.  Mr. Viswanathan speaking to The Hindu appreciated the efficient work of Mr. Babu for getting such a huge number of food items within a short span of time.",TOMATO

On Sunday, the total arrivals of the stocks at Madanapalle, Palamaner, Punganur and Kalikiri markets stood about 3,000 tonnes.  According to information, the first quality of the tomatoes is sold at 8 a kg, while the second quality remained at 6.50 a kg. The marketing officials observed that the current pricing was very decent, during the lockdown period. Though the marriages and other auspicious functions are either postponed or performed as low-key affairs, the exports to Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Telangana and northern States have slowly picked up.  In Tamil Nadu, the tomato exports to the Koyambedu market was stopped last month with the spread of coronavirus across the inter-State border.  However, the stocks are sent to others parts of Chennai from the markets in the Chittoor district. It was observed that tomato exports from Madanapalle to Mumbai and New Delhi had touched the lowest level due to heavy presence of red zones there.  Assistant Director (Marketing) P. Gopi told The Hindu that the prospects of tomato growers, which remained hit during the ongoing lockdown period, gradually turned brighter with several measures of relaxation in transport and public movement.  Though the hotel and event management industries are at present affected by the lockdown, the arrival of tomato stocks to various markets in the district, particularly Madanapalle, has picked up. Despite being Sunday, we received close to 3,000 tonnes today, the official said.  Referring to the reports of huge losses being suffered by the tomato growers, the marketing official said that it was only the third quality of the product that would fetch low price to the growers. He said that a majority of the farmers of Madanapalle division had now started reaping marginal to decent profits through first and second varieties. Coming to the third variety, it generally sells at the lowest price. In cases where such category of stocks remains unharvested, that would be left to cattle or left out, he said.  The official said that the marketing personnel from the government side would always stand by the tomato growers and intervene at the marketing yards to bring decent price for their produce. When it comes to private markets which deal with moderate stocks, the farmers sometimes face the risk of getting exploited, Mr. Gopi said.",TOMATO

However, the retail prices of most vegetables remain firm.  According to data maintained by AGMARKNET under the Union Agriculture Ministry, the wholesale tomato prices were ruling below Rs 5 per kg in some states on May 24, while that of onion to Rs 6 per kg in the key producing state of Maharashtra.  However, potato prices were stable at 12-13 per kg.  Tomato, onion and potato are three key largely consuming vegetables in the country.  The falling price trend was also seen in other vegetables such as ladies finger, capsicum, bitter gourd, bottle gourd, chillies and coriander leaves, among others.  ""It is a matter of concern that farmers are forced to sell at such low prices,"" government think-tank Niti Aayog member Ramesh Chand told PTI.  He said the fall in rates is due to an increase in arrival due to better crop production besides mandi disruption in the wake of COVID-19 pandemic.  Chand, however, ruled out the impact of lack of demand from bulk users like hotels and restaurants.  Since mandis come under the purview of states, the Niti Aayog member said they should step up efforts to ensure smooth functioning of wholesale markets.  If they are not able to operate due to social distancing and COVID-19 reasons, other arrangements should be made to ensure farmers do not suffer.  ""Mandis are not working as usual. Maybe traders are not coming to markets. For instance Azadpur mandi in Delhi was closed for a few days due to COVID-19 reasons. There is impact on prices due to such disruptions,"" he said.  Chand said he had suggested states in the beginning of COVID-19 crisis to suspend mandis for six months which not many states have done yet.  Farmers should have been allowed to sell directly.  Stating that demand for vegetables has compressed in this crisis period, agri-economist Ashok Gulati said the demand from bulk users like hotels and restaurants is missing.  Even households are not buying in huge quantities because of fear of infection.  ""After reports of traders in some mandis had got infected with the virus, there is fear among household consumers about the quality of vegetables. They find cleaning it everytime is a big hassle and therefore shifting to pulses, whose prices have shot up sharply due to rise in demand,"" he explained.  Gulati said it is sad to see the government's TOP scheme under Operation Green has not been of much help to farmers in this situation.  The government has spent only Rs 3 crore out of Rs 500 crore since its launch two years ago under the plan, whose objective is to help tomato, onion and potato (TOP) farmers in times of surplus output.  According to AGMARKNET data, all India average wholesale rate of tomato dropped by 60 per cent to Rs 11 per kg on May 24 from Rs 27.50 per kg a year ago.  Prices have fallen in 19 states but a sharp fall of up to 83 per cent was seen in Telangana, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra.  In Telangana, prices declined by 83 per cent to Rs 4.69 per kg on May 24 from over Rs 27 per kg a year ago, while prices in Karnataka slipped by 80.76 per cent to Rs 4.41 per kg from Rs 23 per kg.  In Andhra Pradesh, prices dropped by 75.48 per cent to Rs 4.88 per kg from Rs 20 per kg.  The wholesale prices of onion declined mainly in three states -- Maharashtra, Karnataka and Delhi.  In Maharashtra, the wholesale rates fell by over 27 per cent to little over Rs 6 per kg on May 24 this year from Rs 9 per kg a year ago, while in Karnataka rates fell by 17 per cent to Rs 8 per kg from Rs 9.50 per kg.  The wholesale rate of potato, however, rose 44 per cent to Rs 18 per kg on May 24 from Rs 12.50 per kg a year ago.  In Uttar Pradesh, it jumped two-fold to little over Rs 16 per kg.  In Delhi too, rates have almost doubled to Rs 15 per kg.  In case of ladies finger (Bhindi), the all India average prices declined by 20 per cent to Rs 17.50 per kg on May 24 from Rs 22 per kg a year go.  Prices have fallen in as many as 14 states.  In Chattisgarh, rates have dropped by 57 per cent to Rs 4 per kg from Rs 9 per kg, while in Gujarat, it slipped 45 per cent to little over Rs 10 per kg from over Rs 18 per kg.",TOMATO

He was seen dragging himself on the street,, hauling his body, pushing forward with the strength of his knuckles scraping on the concrete road. He waited below the ramp, gazing at the shuttered canteen door that would open anytime then. When the canteen opened, he remained waiting below the edge of the ramp. Selvi, the canteen staff walked out and down the ramp to invite Pullayar inside. Pullayar pushed himself up the ramp and inside the canteen, and sat at its entrance.  Across the canteen counter, a smiling staff member placed 5 large sized idlies and a generous helping of steaming hot sambar on them and handed the plate over to Selvi. Before handing the plate to Pullayar, Selvi brought water in a plastic jug and poured it for him to wash his hands. She stood and watched, as Pullayar dug his knuckles into the idlies and scooped up a mouthful with satisfaction.  The canteen served 2,000 idlies and Pongal for breakfast; and tomato rice, lemon rice, sambar rice and curd rice for lunch.  You too come and eat. There is idly, and pongal, offered Selvi. If Amma canteens central kitchen had been feeding close to 10 lakh people since the start of the lockdown, the Amma canteen itself had augmented its daily feeding capacity for people like Pullayar, who would have otherwise been pushed to beggary.

Narayanaswamy on Tuesday asked the A.P. Southern Discom to issue clarification to the consumers on the alleged hefty power bills issued during the lockdown period.  Participating in the Mana Paalana  Mee Soochana programme to commemorate the completion of the first year of YSRCP rule in the State, Mr. Narayanaswamy said the clarification on power bills was the need of the hour, given the huge uproar from the consumers.  Superintending Engineer Chalapathi explained to him that the consumers believed that the excessive billing was due to the 60-day slab, but it was, in fact, due to higher consumption in April, compared to the previous bill paid by them for February.  As the manual reading was not taken due to the lockdown, the computer automatically divided the total consumption for two months and calculated the bills accordingly, he said.  Farmers income  Earlier, the Deputy CM sought suggestions from the people on enhancing the farmers income.  Chittoor MP N.

Two months of lockdown in the country has turned many into avid gardeners exploring their green side by growing a variety of plants, including flowers and vegetables, in their gardens and balconies.  This is reflected in the increase in the sale of gardening products on Snapdeal, one of Indias leading online marketplaces. The overall sales in the gardening category for mid-March to mid-May this year is more than double the sales in the corresponding period last year.  Over the last two months, users have bought seeds to grow a range of vegetables including brinjals, bottle gourd (Laukee), bitter gourd (Karela), chill, coriander, etc. Everyday-use fruits like lemons and tomatoes have also been very popular. Lemon and tomato seeds were the most searched-for seeds on Snapdeal. Combo vegetable seeds pack with multiple varieties of seeds priced under 300 was another popular pick amongst Snapdeal shoppers.  A lot of concentrated demand was observed starting late April for moringa seeds as many users decided to grow moringa (drumstick) plants at home on account of its immunity-boosting properties.  Among flowers, rose, zinnia, petunia and marigold have been the favourite choice on account of their ability to grow well in summers.  Enthusiastic gardeners also bought a range of supplies including garden tool kits comprising trowels (khurpi), clippers, weeding forks, green nets to save plants from birds, spraying cans and seedling trays. Grow bags which are a cheaper alternative to pots were a hit.  Users also bought indoor plants like money plant, areca palm, rubber plant, and fiddle-leaf fig. Succulents were also widely searched and liked but seldom bought due to its high maintenance and low survival in Indian weather conditions.  Plastic pots in a variety of shapes, colours and sizes were in high demand. The popular price range of these were 50 to 250. Most users bought multi-packs of 4-12 pots. Traditional terracotta pots were also searched for but were not available due to difficulty in transporting the same.  According to Snapdeal spokesperson, Gardening is considered a fun and relaxing way to get in touch with nature. In the lockdown period, we saw increased interest from our shoppers in this category, as they spent more time at home. From the nature of buying, we can infer that users are attempting to grow everyday-use fruits and vegetables at home. Our sellers also received queries for bulk supplies from those users who intend to grow organic produce for regular commercial sale.  Seeing the demand, we have onboarded new sellers in this category to ramp up supplies, the spokesperson added.  Shoppers from Tier-2 cities bought most of the gardening supplies. Most orders came from Bhopal, Chandigarh, Nagpur, Dehradun, Gurgaon, Jamnagar, Lucknow, Mysore, Ranchi and Raipur.",TOMATO

The prices of fruits and vegetables in wholesale markets over the past week highlights the steep fall in the price of farm produce in the face of a drop in consumer demand during the lockdown imposed to curb the coronavirus pandemic, experts said. No rebound is likely in the coming weeks and months, they added.  Demand is at rock bottom, said Devendra Sharma, a Chandigarh-based independent farm expert. The biggest consumer of the perishable products is the hospitality industry, other than individuals. There are no signs of the industry opening soon. And when it opens, there will not be many customers. So, I dont expect the demand to improve dramatically in the coming months..  India expects a bumper production of fruits and vegetables because of an above-normal 2019 monsoon and good winter rainfall. The agriculture ministrys advance horticulture produce estimate was 313.5 million tonnes for the 2020 season, the highest in five years.  The absence of bulk purchases during the lockdown enforced on March 25, which shut public eateries and confined residents indoors, has dented overall demand.  Even households are not buying in huge quantities because of the fear of infection. And there are not many signs of prices reviving soon enough to last years level, said KK Sarangi, an agricultural economist in Odisha University of Agriculture and Technology.  New horticulture crops typically start arriving in the markets from March -end . The lockdown took public transport for non-essential goods off the roads, impeding their transport to the markets this year. As the government eased transport norms, some big vegetable wholesale markets including Asias biggest fruit and vegetable market at Azadpur in New Delhi and Koyambedu in Chennai were closed because they turned into Covid hot spots.  Nobody (truckers) is willing to take my cherry produce to Delhi or Chandigarh, said Surinder Singh Bragta after selling his best quality produce for Rs 30 a kilogram in Shimlas wholesale fruit market. Last year, I sold similar quality cherry for Rs 100 a kilogram in Chandigarh. I dont know what will happen to pears and apples which could be harvested in the nest few months. Commission agents are saying this will be worst year for fruits as demand is low.  More than 2,000 kilometers away in Madhya Pradeshs Neemuch district, Tarun Baheti, a vegetable farmer, said there were no buyers in the market other than local traders. After so many years, we had a good crop of vegetables. But no one is willing to pay the right price.  Due to lockdown restrictions, we cannot take the produce to bigger markets. Ladies finger (okra) bottle gourd, sponge gourd used to be sold for a maximum of Rs 40 to Rs 50 per kg in the last season but now the rate has come down to about Rs 15 per kg in the wholesale market. Pumpkin is being sold at Rs 5 to Rs 10 per kg, he added.  In Uttar Pradeshs Barabanki district, Ram Saran Verma, a farmer who has won the Padma Shri award for work in agriculture, said wholesale markets were empty in what has been a good harvest season.  There are no buyers. Even the cost to transport the produce to market is not being recovered, he said.  Another Barabanki farmer, Dinesh Rawat, said he lost Rs 1 lakh in May alone because he was not able to transport his cucumber produce to Lucknow, Sultanpur and Agra. I had to sell it at a local mandi for whatever price it fetched, he said.  In some states such as Bihar, Odisha and Uttar Pradesh, there have been reports of farmers throwing away their produce. Verma said most farmers already lost money this year and either threw away their produce or fed it to cattle.  This year we left the produce in the field itself as there is no point in selling ladies finger for Rs 2 per kg said Bechan Yadav, a farmer in rural Patna.  Mritunjay Kumar, a farmer of Sohsarai in Nalanda district, said the cost of transporting the vegetables to the market was more than the selling price. It is better to give vegetables to cattle, at least they will get some nutrition, he said.  In Odishas Dhenkanal district, the pumpkin harvest is rotting in the farms. Manas Barik, who harvested three tonnes of pumpkins on five acres of land in Dhenkanal, said he found no takers for his produce. The traders want us to sell pumpkin at Rs 5 a kg. It does not cover even transport cost.  The distress is visible in fruit markets, too.  In Gaddiannaram fruit market at Kothapet in Hyderabad, Telanganas largest fruit and vegetable wholesale market, the prices are the lowest in years.  For the last four years, the price of mangoes was between Rs 60,000 to Rs 1.20 lakh per tonne depending on the variety. This year, it is Rs 20,000 to Rs 30,000 per tonne, said Telangana Fruit Merchants Association president Ashok Kumar. He said the prices of sweet lime (mosambi) had come down from Rs 50,000 a tonne to less than Rs 20,000 a tonne.  There is essentially no demand, Kumar added  Some are and hoping things will be normal after Lockdown 4.0 ends on May 31.  We hope that the farmer may start getting decent price from August onwards,said Patna district agriculture officer Rakesh Ranjan.  Officials at the Karnataka Horticulture Producers Co-operative Marketing and Processing Society (HOPCOMS) claimed that prices have recovered in the past one week with the easing of lockdown norms.  Prices of vegetables like onion, potato and others are more stable than the easier perishables such as greens, beans, tomato, capsicum, cucumber which wilt in the summer sun, said a HOPCOMS official who requested anonymity.

In the far-north Canadian town of Iqaluit, one boy has been glued to the news to learn everything he can about the coronavirus. A girl in Australia sees a vibrant future, tinged with sadness for the lives lost. A Rwandan boy is afraid the military will violently crack down on its citizens when his country lifts the lockdown.  There is melancholy and boredom, and a lot of worrying, especially about parents working amid the disease, grandparents suddenly cut off from weekend visits, friends seen only on a video screen.  Some children feel safe and protected. Others are scared. And yet, many also find joy in play, and even silliness.  Associated Press reporters around the world asked kids about living with the virus and to use art to show us what they believe the future might hold. Some sketched or painted, while others sang, danced ballet, built with LEGOs. A few just wanted to talk.  In the remote forests of northern California, one boy, a Karuk Indian, wrote a rap song to express his worries about how his tribe of just 5,000 will survive the pandemic.  Their worries are matched in many places by resilience and hope, for a life beyond the virus.  This is life under lockdown, through the eyes of children.  ____  LILITHA JIPHETHU, 11, SOUTH AFRICA  Lilitha Jiphethu has made a ball out of discarded plastic grocery bags to keep her amused during the lockdown. She and her four siblings play with that makeshift ball almost every day in a small scrub of ground that theyve fenced off outside their home.  The 11-year-old screams as her brothers throw the ball at her. Then she laughs, picks up the ball and throws it back at them. This happens again and again.  Lilithas house is like hundreds of others in this informal settlement of families just outside Johannesburg, South Africas biggest city. Its made of sheets of scrap metal nailed to wooden beams.  Like many children under lockdown, she misses her friends and her teachers and especially misses playing her favorite game, netball. But she understands why school is closed and why they are being kept at home.  I feel bad because I dont know if my family (can catch) this coronavirus, Lilitha says. I dont like it, this corona.  She prefers singing to drawing and chooses to sing a church song in her first language, Xhosa, as her way of describing the future after the pandemic. She misses her choir but takes comfort in the songs lyrics.  She smiles as she begins. Her sweet voice drifts through the one-room home.  I have a friend in Jesus, she sings. He is loving and hes not like any other friend.  He is not deceitful. He is not ashamed of us.  He is truthful, and he is love.

Now, the soft-spoken 12-year-old receives school assignments by computer and looks to dog Ty and cat Teddy for comfort.  Since I dont get to see my friends a lot, theyre kind of my closest friends, he says. He giggles when Teddy, now 9, snarls. He sometimes gets really grumpy because hes an old man. But we still love him a lot.  When not doing schoolwork, Hudson jumps and flips on his trampoline and lifts himself around a doorframe outfitted so he can practice climbing, something he usually does competitively.  He knows hes fortunate, with a good home and family to keep him safe, but its difficult to be patient. It makes me feel sad that I am missing out on a part of my childhood, he says.  When he draws his version of the future, Hudson makes a detailed pencil sketch showing life before the coronavirus and after.  The world before looks stark and full of pollution in the drawing. In the future, the city is lush with clear skies and more wildlife and trees.  I think the environment might kind of, like, replenish itself or maybe grow back, Hudson says.  Still, he feels uncertain: Im worried about just how life will be after this. Like, will life change that much?

Together, they take time to water tomato plants and enjoy one anothers company. Time has slowed down.  Before that I would have breakfast with them, rush out to school, come back, have dinner, go to ballet classes, come back -- and it would already be time to go to bed, Alexandra says.  Ballet has been her passion since she was 8. Now she does classes at home and sends videos of her drills to the trainer, who gives her feedback.  The dance she shows for an AP reporter begins slowly and finishes with leaps in the air.  Just like the pandemic, Alexandra says, it is sad in the beginning and then it becomes joyful.

Their mother, Jacqueline Mukantwari is paid $50 a month as a schoolteacher, but she used to earn extra money giving private lessons. That business has dried up, and the family gets food parcels from the government twice a month.  The only regular outside time Tresor has is in a small courtyard next to his home.  The day becomes long, he says in his native tongue, Kinyarwanda. (You) cant go out there  he indicates the world outside his house  and it makes me feel really uncomfortable.  Tresor draws a picture of the future that shows soldiers shooting civilians who are protesting, he says. He adds dabs of red paint next to one of those who has fallen.  There is blood, he says, and some are crying, as you can see.  Its a stark image for a boy to produce. Rwanda was the first country in Africa to enforce a total lockdown because of the virus. Its also a place where the security forces meant to be helping keep people safe have been accused of serious abuses of power.  Yet he wants to be a soldier.

Daniel Sabiiti and Gerald Imray  ___  JEIMMER ALEJANDRO RIVEROS, 9, COLOMBIA  Life in Colombias countryside has become even more difficult for the family of Jeimmer Alejandro Riveros.  The price of herbs and vegetables his single mom and siblings cultivate on a farm in Chipaque have declined. A spotty internet connection makes virtual classes difficult, and a nationwide quarantine means less time outdoors.  Here is a mountain with a river, Jeimmer, 9, says, pointing at each item in his drawing. In his mind, the future doesnt look so different. Here I am. Heres my mommy. Here is my brother. Here is my house. Here is the sun and here is the sky.  The family recently launched a YouTube channel with videos showing how to grow and propagate plants that now has more than 420,000 followers. Their first video, introducing the Jeimmers mom, older brother and dog, has garnered, by now, more than 1 million views.  Lets make this go viral! Jeimmer says, as birds chirp in the background.  Colombia is one of Latin Americas most unequal countries, and poverty abounds in rural areas where many still lack basic utilities like safe drinking water. Jeimmers family often walks 40 minutes a day to get fresh milk.  Capital city Bogota  about an hour from the familys farm  has the highest number of coronavirus cases in Colombia. But cases are increasingly being identified in rural areas with few hospitals. Chipaque reported its first case earlier this month.  Despite the obstacles, Jeimmer maintains an upbeat outlook on life under quarantine. He feels safe from the virus with his mom and brother. And he imagines a future with more time spent outdoors and one day, a grown-up job.  It doesnt matter that were in lockdown, he says. We can be happy.

The internet periodically goes out for hours, making it hard for him to complete his school work, so he plays with his dog, Navi Noop Noop.  But Shikii, as his friends call him, also has bigger things on his mind. Hes a Karuk Indian, a member of Californias second-largest tribe, and has been reading about how the pandemic is rampaging through the Navajo Nation, another tribe hundreds of miles away.  The virus can feel far away in the tribes tiny outpost of Orleans, California, where the crystal clear lower Klamath River winds through densely forested mountains south of the Oregon-California border. But in a rap Shikii wrote, he urged fellow tribal members not to get complacent.  Stay away, man, 6 feet at least. Social distancing, its a thing that could save us. What? Like 5,000 of us left, Karuk tribe, man, thats it.  Ishikiihara, whose full name means sturgeon warrior in the Karuk language, later adds, If we even just lost a few people, that would be really sad.  Rapping about his worries isnt new for him. He has a song about how his tribe lost its tradition fishing salmon runs on the Klamath River, pondering in verse why the Karuk needed permission to go fishin.  Gillian Flaccus  __  BANEEN AHMED, 10, JORDAN  Despite the harshness she has experienced, the quiet, studious girl is brimming with hard-won optimism.  Her familys suffering in war-time Iraq has taught Baneen Ahmed that outside events can turn life upside down in an instant. In the chaotic aftermath of the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq, an uncle was kidnapped, and a great-uncle was killed by armed militias, forcing her family to seek refuge in Jordan.  By comparison, the coronavirus pandemic seems manageable, the 10-year-old says. Scientists will find a vaccine, she says, speaking in halting but vocabulary-rich English, her favorite subject of study at a private school in the Jordanian capital of Amman.  Its going to take a year or a little bit to find a cure, so its going to end, says Baneen, who prefers to talk and show how shes studying at home under lockdown, rather than drawing a picture.  In Iraq, its not going to end, she continues. Its like so hard to end it, the killing and the kidnapping.  In the future, she sees herself studying abroad, maybe in the United States or Turkey. Shes thought about a career in medicine, but is excited by any opportunity to learn. For her, school represents hope.  I want to go somewhere else because they will let us study good things, Baneen says. And my future is going to be good.  Karin Laub  __  ELENA MORETTI, 11, ITALY  For Elena Moretti, the pandemic is not some faraway threat. Italy was the first European country to be hit by COVID-19, and her mother is a doctor in the public health system that has seen 27,500 personnel infected and more than 160 doctors dead nationwide.  Elena, 11, is afraid of the coronavirus. Whenever a package arrives in the mail, she brings it out onto the terrace and disinfects it with a spray-bottle soap solution she made herself.  Its a bottle, too, in Elenas drawing, capturing the virus inside.  The virus wanted to attack us, so instead of bringing us down, we counterattack and imprison it, she said of her drawing.  That fighting spirit has helped Elena get through more than two months of lockdown. After an initial spell of sleeping late because her teachers hadnt transitioned to remote learning, Elena now does schoolwork, karate and hip-hop lessons online.  Sometimes the internet connection goes out. But shes still managed to keep in touch with friends, with some video chats lasting for hours. Shes also discovered a new hobby, baking sweets  apple tort, cupcakes and cream-filled pastry.  Now that Italys lockdown has begun to ease, Elena is starting to go out again, but the fear remains.  Im afraid it might spread even more and take all of us, she said.  Paolo Santalucia  __  NIKI JOLENE BERGHAMRE-DAVIS, 11, AUSTRALIA  When she doesnt move enough, she doesnt sleep well. So, Niki Jolene Berghamre-Davis tries to go hiking in the forest whenever possible during this global pandemic. Even in the best of times, thats where the 11-year-old from Port Melbourne, Australia, feels most at home.  She is our nature girl, says her mother, Anna Berghamre.  Her mom wasnt surprised when Niki Jolene drew a self-portrait of herself facing a grove of trees. Within the drawing, there are signs of caution.  I have a face mask in my hand, she says holding up the drawing, because, well, Ive just kind of taken it off, and Im still aware.  She says that falling leaves she included in the sketch symbolize the lives that have been lost in this pandemic.  Yet the roots of the trees  wide and prominent like those of the flowering red gum trees near her familys townhome  represent possibilities, says the bubbly girl, known as Snickers to some of her friends. She smiles often, showing a full set of braces on her teeth.  After this corona pandemic, after this will end, I think it will be much more full of life, she says, throwing her arms up for emphasis. She hopes, for instance, that people will walk more and drive less because shes noticed how people in her neighborhood have often done without their cars during the shutdown.  I think people wont take things for granted anymore.  Martha Irvine  ___  DANYLO BOICHUK, 12, UKRAINE  Danylo Boichuk envies his cat, Kari, who is able to escape from the family home in a Kyiv suburb and run free. Because of the pandemic, his family had to cancel a summer camp in Bulgaria, and 12-year-old Danylo worries a lot about closed borders.  Sitting on his back porch, he has used his LEGO blocks and figures to create his version of the future  a situation at the border.  Here is a vessel en route to Copenhagen, and border guards are inspecting it, Danylo explains, pointing to particular pieces and holding up others. This crew member shows medical evidence that everyone on board is healthy, except for one man in an isolation cell.  The plastic figure makes a rattling sound after he drops it into the makeshift jail.  There is a security guard restricting contact with the man, he continues. There are IT specialists at work. There are also people who lost their jobs  musicians, farmers, showmen.  The boy wonders if authorities in some countries will use the coronavirus crisis to tighten their grip on peoples lives. For example, they may implant chips to track (peoples) whereabouts  , Danylo surmises.  His parents say he has an analytical mind. Already, he wants to become a businessman in the future and create a start-up to develop online games. Hes been reading books about Steve Jobs, the founder of Apple, and other famous entrepreneurs, during self-isolation.  After the pandemic, he says people will invest more in internet products and games.  This is an opportunity one should use, he says.  Dmitry Vlasov  __  ANA LAURA RAMREZ LAVANDERO, 10, CUBA  Her drawing depicts a simple enough dream for a 10-year-old  Viaje a la Playa, a trip to the beach. On the page, she has colored a palm tree with three brown coconuts, a boat floating in the distance and a shining yellow sun.  It is a scene representative of life on her island country, known for its white sand and aqua-blue waters. For now, however, Ana Laura Ramrez Lavandero can only dream of the beach. Under lockdown, she finds herself confined to the fourth-floor apartment she shares with her parents and grandmother. On the balcony, she watches life through a rusted iron trellis. It can seem like a jail.  My life changed, says the girl, whos accustomed to playing on the streets of her working and middle-income neighborhood in Havana.  The only time shes been able to go out in nearly two months has been for an emergency trip to the dentist. Schools are closed, and because many people in Cuba dont have internet, the education ministry is broadcasting lessons on state television.  Ana Laura dreams of becoming a famous drummer. This was her first year at a highly selective institute for students identified early on as musically talented. She is continuing with classes in math, history and Spanish, but not music.  Her childrens chorus also cant meet right now. Usually, her own choir meets alongside another one, with boys and girls of all ages.  People feel united in the chorus, she says wistfully. She cant wait to see them again.  Andrea Rodrguez  ___  SANWERIA BROTHERS, 8 AND 9, INDIA  Advait Vallabh Sanweria, age 9, grins as his younger brother lists all the things theyve been doing during Indias extended shutdown.  We get spanked, scolded, watch movies, cook, sweep floors and use the phone and make Skype calls, Uddhav Pratap Sanweria, age 8, says in Hindi.  At times the brothers are a bit of a comedy routine, or at least a danger to the furniture in their home. Theyve turned one room into a cricket pitch, with one brother bowling, or pitching, the ball, while the other bats. Other times, they play quieter games, such as chess or Uno.  Excited at first about school shutting down indefinitely, the brothers missed being able to go outside.  It is frustrating to stay locked inside our homes, Advait Vallabh, the 9-year-old says of the lockdown, which have since eased a little. When I get frustrated, sometimes I read a book. Sometimes I cry.  Recently, the brothers were excited to see a rainbow arching across blue skies outside their home.  The weather has changed so much, says Advait Vallabh, noting the visibly fresh air in New Delhi, as pollution in the otherwise choked city has cleared drastically during the lockdown.  Even with the ups and downs, the brothers believe the lockdown should continue for a year.  They shouldnt reopen until the time there are zero cases left, the younger Uddhav Pratap says.  Rishi Lekhi and Rishabh Raj Jain  ___  OWEN WATSON, 12, CANADA  Dressed in a puffy parka made by his mom and with cellphone in hand, Owen Watson gives a tour of his town, Iqaluit, in the far-north Canadian territory of Nunavut. Theres still snow on the ground in May, though the days are getting longer in this place known for its spectacular views of the northern lights.  That light blue place is the school that I used to go to, 12-year-old Owen says of the shuttered structure behind him. Then he turns to a playground. Its not supposed to be played with right now.  Surrounded by rivers, lakes and the ocean, filled with Arctic char, his dad, Aaron Watson, says the name of their town means fishes in Inuktitut, the language spoken by this regions Inuit people, which includes Owen and his mom and sister. Dad is originally from Stratford, Ontario, and works in the tourism industry in Nunavut.  Under nationwide shutdown, Owen has kept busy with packets of work from his teachers. He rides his bike around the even-quieter-than-usual town  and tries not to worry too much.  His dad observes how much Owen has been watching news about the coronavirus and wonders if theyre raising a future scientist.  So far, there have been no documented cases of the coronavirus in the town of about 8,000 people, many of whom work for the federal government and the city. When flights are running, they can fly to the Canadian capital, Ottawa, in three hours.  So young Owen thinks its only a matter of time before the virus arrives. If it gets here, he says, Ill be more afraid.  He waits and watches. The sun sets to the west, as clouds reflect soft shades of pink and purple. Its a lot for a boy to think about.  -Martha Irvine  (This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text.

Many of them have approached agriculture officials seeking answers to their questions.  As sowing would commence from the second week of June, coinciding with the likely arrival of monsoon, farmers are worried about the prospect of locust invasion.  Paddy farmers, though small in number in the eastern mandals and mulberry farmers in Kuppam division, are also keeping their fingers crossed. Tomato farmers are to some extent relaxed as the crop season has almost ended.  Joint Director (Agiruclture) N. Vijay Kumar told The Hindu that even if desert locusts invade the district, there would not be much impact as all major crops have almost been harvested.  Mud spraying  However, as a precautionary measure, in areas where there is standing crop or where harvesting has not been completed, farmers would be given orientation on a war-footing to undertake mud spraying. In order to accomplish the task, equipment such as rain guns would be used. The strategy had proved effective, the official said.  Accordingly, agriculture officials in Kuppam tri-State junction have alerted mulberry farmers and said machines to undertake mud spraying would be supplied to them as and when required.  Divisional Forest Officer (DFO) G. Srinivasulu said the locusts only attack tender leaves and shoots of various crops.  The path of locusts is unpredictable as their speed is determined by the direction of wind. The forest ranges of the Rayalaseema region would naturally be dry this summer and formation of the first layer of greenery would mostly depend on the timeliness of the arrival of monsoon. Unlike agriculture fields, the canopy of forests is mostly scattered. That being the case, there is no immediate threat to forest cover, the DFO said.",TOMATO

According to the paper, the numbers belie government claims about the operations of agricultural markets during the lockdown.  Arrivals of major agricultural commodities in markets across the country during the lockdown period were as low as 50 to 75 per cent of arrivals during the corresponding period last year, indicating the difficulties faced by agriculturists on account of severe disruption of supply chains.  A paper to be published in the upcoming issue of Review of Agrarian Studies  a peer-reviewed journal of the Foundation for Agrarian Studies  shows that the arrivals were not even 50 per cent of the total arrivals for wheat, barley, gram, potato, onion, peas and mango in 2019. While they were between 50 and 75 per cent of the arrivals last year in the case of pigeon pea, lentil, cabbage, cauliflower, ladys finger and banana. The paper is authored by R Ramakumar, NABARD chair professor, School of Development Studies, Tata Institute of Social Sciences, Mumbai.  Using data from the commodities database of the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE), a compilation of data from 3,289 markets across the country, the paper analyses market arrivals of 16 commodities between March 15 and May 15, and compares these with market arrivals during the same two-month period in 2019. The 16 commodities represent all crop groups including cereals, pulses, fruits and vegetables.  CMIE, a leading business information company, produces economic and business databases and develops specialised analytical tools to deliver these to its customers for decision making and for research.  With the exception of maize, market arrivals for all commodities were lower in 2020 than in 2019. And only two commodities, paddy and maize, saw at least 75 per cent of market arrivals as compared to 2019. In the case of wheat, an important rabi crop, market arrivals were only 47 per cent as compared to 2019.  In the case of barley and gram, arrivals were 32.6 per cent and 43.5 per cent of the corresponding period in the previous year. Arrivals of pigeon pea (arhar) were 63.6 per cent while arrivals of lentil (masoor) were 56.7 per cent in comparison with 2019.  Arrivals of perishable commodities were significantly lower, too. As compared to 2019, tomato saw 74.5 per cent arrivals, potato saw 49 per cent, while onion and peas were 32.5 per cent and 39.1 per cent, respectively. In addition, wheat, barley, gram, lentil, peas and mango also witnessed a long stretch of days in March when arrivals were negligible.  According to the paper, the numbers belie government claims about the operations of agricultural markets during the lockdown. The sizeably lower arrivals point to difficulties faced by farmers due to breakdowns in government procurement systems, lower private trade in rural areas, difficulties in transporting goods to market yards, mandi-specific requirements such as an appointment slip, etc. Farmers who ran into these hurdles at markets were forced to take their produce back or sell to middlemen at lower prices.  While farmers did indeed sell produce outside this network of agricultural markets during the lockdown period, the probability that such sales were at prices lower than market rates is high, prof R Ramakumar told The Indian Express. Some of these sales outside the markets may have been distress sales, some perishables would have suffered spoilage or would have been dumped. A few states, such as Punjab, opened more numbers of procurement centers, ad hoc institutions to increase procurements, which would not reflect in this data of market arrivals. But these are unlikely to alter the numbers significantly, he said.  In the case of some commodities, price realisations also fell alongside the dip in market arrivals, indicating more distress for the producers of these items, such as poultry and milk, vegetables and some fruits. These areas would have suffered significant losses, though the extent of distress these farmers have faced cannot be gauged by the supply or demand shocks alone, more primary studies will be required to assess the level of distress, he said.  These disruptions offer a lesson on how supply chains must be structured and secured, Ramakumar added. I am not sure if the recent steps taken by the government, including the amendments to states APMC Acts, are actually going to resolve the problem. We must look at ways in which the APMC system can be reformed and strengthened, we must identify problems such as the predominance of commission agents in some markets. The extent of disruption caused by the closing down of some APMC markets such as Mumbai and Pune show that they have a significant role to play, so reform is actually required within the APMC regime, he said.",TOMATO

Farmers of tomato growing areas have been shifting their produce to Madanapalle market, from where the vegetable is being exported to neighbouring States.  For farmers in the western parts of Chittoor district, including Thamballapalle, Piler, Madanapalle, Punganur and Palamaner, tomato is the main crop.  About 20,000 farmers cultivate tomato in the region. The total crop acreage is around 30,000 hectares. Madanapalle market is considered to be the largest exporter of tomato in the State. With easing of restrictions on vehicular movement, traders are coming forward to purchase tomato in Madanapalle market.  According to marketing officials, 2,000 to 3,000 tonnes of tomato has been arriving at the markets across the district a day as against 300 to 500 tonnes during earlier phases of lockdown.  We faced difficulty to sell our produce earlier. Now, traders have resumed purchase of the vegetable in view of the huge demand for tomato in neighbouring States. Hence, we are getting a better price for our produce now, said V Chennaiah, a farmer of Madanapalle division.  In some areas, farmers have started harvesting tomato crop with the availability of agriculture labourers. The harvested produce is being shifted to local mandis.  The price of tomato per kg will be around Rs 20 to Rs 25 during the peak season. Now, the first quality tomatoes are being sold at a price of Rs 8 to Rs 9 per kg in the market as against the price of Rs 3 to Rs 5 during the earlier phases of lockdown, bringing some relief to farmers.  They are hopeful of further increase in the price of tomato in the coming days in view of the increase in demand.",TOMATO

The possibility of a locust attack in the national capital has prompted the Delhi government to launch an awareness programme for farmers and the general public on prevention techniques to be used.  Sitting on a cot in his orchard of guavas in a North Delhi village and peeling mangoes on Friday afternoon, 83-year-old Palleram recalled a memory from his youth. The sky had turned yellow suddenly that day many years ago, that was how big their swarm was. There was a buzzing sound and these big insects (locusts) descended on our wheat crops. Our fields became barren overnight nothing but straws sticking out of the ground remained the next day, said the resident of Daryapur Kalan village.  While Palleram doesnt remember the exact year of the incident, an account by Delhi historian R V Smith mentions the year 1944 as the time when one of the biggest locust invasions took place in the city in recent history.  Palleram said that at the time of the invasion, while everyone had rushed to take cover, he ran into his fields with a bedsheet, swinging it around to distract the swarm, but in vain.  They only went after soft leaves, of jowar, wheat and other crops. My orchard would be safe if they come around again because the leaves are thicker, he said.  The possibility of a locust attack in the national capital has prompted the Delhi government to launch an awareness programme for farmers and the general public on prevention techniques to be used.  On Friday, officials from the agriculture unit of the state governments development department held one such programme with farmers of Daryapur Kalan and its adjoining villages.  However, the central governments Locust Warning Organisation (LWO) Friday said the possibility of an attack is low because the wind direction over Delhi is unfavourable for transport of active swarms in Rajasthan.  Deputy director of LWO, K L Gurjar, told The Indian Express, An attack is unlikely at present. The swarms in Rajasthan would remain there for now.  Farmers in Daryapur Kalan said they would buy chemicals to spray on locusts in case an attack is confirmed.  Jaypal Sehrawat (48), cutting his jowar crop to be used as fodder for his cattle, said: Most fields are empty right now because the wheat crop has been harvested and the ground is being prepared for the next crop. If the swarms attack, the damage would be to the jowar, which would be wiped out completely.  Farmers also said an attack can cause them further financial suffering, as the coronavirus lockdown has already made a dent in their pockets.  Deepak Rohilas farm has six bighas of land covered with sprawling tomato plants, with rotting tomatoes stuck to the vine. The 40-year-old said, We tried to sell what we could to residents here as there were no buyers at Azadpur Mandi. I invested Rs 4,000 to transport these tomatoes there but only made Rs 1,500 in sales. They are rotting because we cant do anything with them. I will have to spend more money to buy chemicals for the locusts now, otherwise the farm would be destroyed.",TOMATO

Passionate about farming from childhood, she started the same around a year ago and also cultivates various types of fruits in 4.5 cents of land in their backyard. For Priya, indulging in farming is a way to become self-sufficient, lead a healthy lifestyle and get rid of stress in life.  She cultivates vegetables like brinjal, cauliflower, capsicum, ginger, ladys finger, spinach, ridge guard, tomato and snake guard on her terrace. Only onion and potatoes are bought from outside. When we started producing sufficient vegetables at home, I started farming fruits in our backyard, says Priya. She now grows strawberry, bell fruit, blackcurrant, rambutan and guava.  Priyas husband Santosh works as an assistant general manager in Air Traffic Control, Airport Authority of India, Thiruvananthapuram. Her children, studying in Classes X and XII have also started showing interest. They spend a lot of time caring for the plants. The soil needs to be checked daily. Mental stress can be relieved while tending to plants, she said. Owing to her reliance on home-grown plants, she didnt have to go to the market to buy vegetables during the lockdown. She also spent her time effectively to manufacture new types of fertilisers on her farm. We dont use insecticides or pesticides on the plants. Rather, we use a solution which comprises leaves, to keep the plants healthy, she said.  Priya asserted that everyone should start farming in their homes to maintain a healthy lifestyle. One can begin farming in the space available. We may have to face other pandemics in the future which could result in unavailability, so it is wise to be self-sufficient.

Having grown up on a healthy diet of Westerns, the name appealed to me, instantly conjuring up an image of a swinging door and the sound of distant neighing. I looked at the menu, and it sounded good too. So I put on my Stetson, and placed an order.  Wild Wild West, I learnt, has three branches in Delhi. Now, of course, the restaurants are shut, but its food is being delivered through Swiggy and Zomato. The delivery menu includes pizzas, pastas, calzones, salads, and sandwiches. The main courses have dishes such as grilled vegetables with basil pesto sauce and smoked chicken fillets.  Grilled chicken Photo: Special Arrangement  We asked for a Meaty Submarine (350), with iceberg, onions, black olives and sundried tomatoes, chicken sausages, pork pepperoni and bacon bits, served with chipotle and mustard sauce; Grilled Chicken Breast in Cosmic Mushroom Sauce, with Grilled Vegetables (440), chicken peri peri with sauted mushroom and herbed rice (400) and Spinach and Sundried Tomato Pasta (390).  My order was the submarine, for I have a long and happy relationship with this dish. I remember the juicy submarines I had at Cellars (which later turned into a place called The Parlour) in CP. This is essentially a bigger and thicker hotdog, with various kinds of fillings.  The chilli-lover at home enjoyed the peri peri chicken, which came submerged in a red sauce. I had a spoonful of the sauce, and found that while it was spicy, it was still not as hot as I would have liked it to be.  We had imagined something else when we ordered the grilled chicken, too. Id thought the sauce would be on the side, but it came dunked in the mushroom gravy, which was just a bit too rich and creamy.  My submarine was excellent, though. It was well packed, and stuffed with enough meat to be called a meaty submarine. I enjoyed the crunchy iceberg and the tart sundried tomatoes, flavours and textures that went well with the meats. I liked the pasta, too (even though it was a bit too cheesy) and savoured the pine nuts that it had been garnished with.  Wild Wild West doffs its hat to the Indian palate. So in the pizza segment, while it has something called an Expatriate Pizza (with marinara sauce, mozzarella, baby corn, black olives, sundried tomatoes and jalapenos) and Sausage Fest Pizza, it also has Paneer Makhni Pizza and Butter Chicken Pizza. The menu includes a Butter Chicken Calzone and a Paneer Tikkalicious Salad.  I didnt venture anywhere there, of course. We were in search of what is known (in some circles) as Conti food. Overall, I think we had quite a nice meal, which we ended with some desi home-made suji halwa (cooked in just a wee bit of oil and stevia).

B Ramakrishnan asks me. The man who developed and popularised the One Pot, One Shot cooking technique for quick meals using a pressure cooker, is well known among South Indian food circles. Still, this is the first time that we are speaking, and the first thing he wants to know is this.  Ramakrishnan has just been declared the winner (long format) of the Amazon Kindle Direct Publishing contest, for his book The Story Of India Through Food: OPOS Cookbook. Published in November 2019, this book was nearly 15 years in making. It details how 60 different Indian and ethnic cuisines evolved over time, with recipes.  This book is about telling people why we eat the things we do today, and what shaped these foods. Why do some communities eat fish, some eat mutton but not chicken... a lot of these questions are answered by the evolution of each cuisine, he says.  The book started as a blog in 2009, and was born out of disputes and debates in various food groups. How is a South Indian korma different than a North Indian one? Why did the Hyderabadi Nizami cuisine, considered royal, remain in the middle of Andhra, and fail to spread across the Telugu states? These were questions for which he wanted answers.  davofjsaiff foiuafhoif fuiahfa fiuaf uagf iafg afiuag fauif afuiaf iuaf auf afiua fiuaa fiuahf  Explaining that Indian food history is more oral than written, Ramakrishnan says he travelled to different states to understand the traditional ingredients used and the methods of cooking in each place. I picked up stories from elderly people in each household  The richest source of history for him were temple cuisines, that acted like time capsules in their rigidity and stickling to rituals. For example, none of the temples I found served tomato rice as prasad. They serve tamarind rice, coconut rice, lemon rice but they dont use tomatoes in any form because tomatoes only came into India 500 years ago and are still viewed as foreign food, he says.  Given there are so many different oral histories floating around for each cuisine, a part of Ramakrishnans challenge was digging into what could be the most plausible theory of origin. He takes the example of biryani, ubiquitous across Indian communities, and its authenticity, a cause for much debate.  Biryani came to India in the North through the Mughals from Persia. Originally, it did not even have rice, just meat and flatbread. But a 1000 years before that, the primitive version of biryani was brought by traders in the South, through Kerala, the same time that Islam arose in the country, he says, describing the erachi choru, which is basically meat and rice cooked together.  The refinement of biryani, the technique of cooking on low heat, sandwiching meat between two layers of rice, so as to keep the flavours sealed and infused... that happened in the North, he adds.  In every house that he went, he would sit with the families and cook their recipes using the OPOS method, until his dishes earned their validation. He particularly enjoyed visiting families in Nagaland, Meghalaya, Manipur and Tripura. Its the only place in India that has not subscribed to the masala craze! Just fresh vegetables and meat, with minimal oil.  Ramakrishnan hopes that this book would turn out to be a blueprint for de-skilling and automating cuisines. I think its racist to say that only a North Indian can cook the best paneer butter masala, or nobody can make sambar like a South Indian. With the right tools, anyone can.",TOMATO

Referring to agriculture, the Congress leader said tomato farmers in Chittoor district are ready to harvest the crops and the government must ensure remunerative price for the produce and its hassle-free transportation in view of the lockdown.  The hope for good returns of tomato farmers get dashed every time for some reason or the other. The government should play a sincere role in ensuring good income for the farmers this time, Mr. Chandrasekhar told the media here.  He also sought provision of timely credit facilities to farmers and a support mechanism to poultry sector which suffered heavy losses this year.",TOMATO

My cousins and I spent glorious afternoons on the terrace of our grandparents ancestral home, squinting under the sun, listening to the twittering birds, and watching the large jackfruit and tamarind trees shimmering, declaring the arrival of summer.  Also jostling for our attention, the mango trees blossomed, filling the air with the rawness of its fruit. At the other end of the terrace, sitting around heaps of raw mangoes freshly plucked from these trees, our mothers, aunts and uncles exchanged juicy bites of family gossip. In another corner, paati exercised her arms in laying out vadams, vathals, and slices of lemon, tomato and gooseberry to dry on thathas white cotton veshti. And our task was to keep the usual thieving birds at bay.  Summer rituals deserve that extra bit of praise, dont they?  While this years summer arrived with a pall of coronavirus-induced gloom, the spirit of Chennai folk, however, seemed to hand out a promise of not losing this tradition to a pandemic. Soaking in this sunshine, the city began preparations for its version of preserves for the year.  Pickling memories  Lockdown or not, certain things dont change. I began with my usual pickle-making process in the first week of April. My daughter-in-law, daughter and grandchildren helped me this year. What used to be a solo ritual turned into a family bonding exercise and Im grateful that this generation is getting to enjoy these activities. Weve made gooseberry, lemon, raw mango and vegetable pickles. Ive also made vadam (rice crackers) using rice, sago and maize, because I had an extra set of hands to help me out, says 80-year-old Bhooshanam B, who has been labouriously but lovingly continuing this summer ritual for the past 50 years.  This year, however, Bhooshanams duty has been simply to guide and monitor. Division of labour was introduced. The grandchildren Karthik, Nisha and Chandru  were tasked with washing fruits and vegetables for making pickles. Her daughter-in-law Shanmathi sliced and marinated them; her daughter Sithara mixed the pickle in vinegar and filled them into jars with labels for each. Usually, when the pickle is ready, the grandchildren deliver the goodies to friends and neighbours. This year, due to the lockdown, we could distribute the pickles only to a select few. Also, I couldnt get access to the usual variety and quality of vegetables. Weve prepared a batch with whatever was available and stocked up on pickles for the next few months. The kids realised how difficult and time-consuming pickle-making is, shares the octogenarian.  Family recipes unlocked  Pickles, preserves and podis are not just condiments. They are emotions. And no one knows this better than our grandmothers and mothers who have guarded their heirloom recipes close to their heart like a family member. So, being party to this secret required consistent display of enthusiasm and the promise of never failing the recipe. But in the case of sisters Sundari Raman and Shwetha Raman, it took a pandemic to convert the new homebirds into kitchen ninjas. Both of us have been wanting to do this every year. We just procrastinate in the name of work.  Im usually busy with taking summer coaching classes for students and Shwetha has a morning shift. This was the first time we were involved in the making process and its been completely worth the effort. Weve made hand-pounded garlic powder, sambar powder, and chutneys and thokku made of watermelon and orange peels. Cauliflower and peas pickle has been our familys heirloom recipe for many years. Weve made many jars of it and given it to our neighbours. Theres a certain sense of satisfaction when you make everything from scratch. This has been of great help to amma as well, says Sundari.  Ditching comfort  Brothers Bharat Ram and Ananth Ram have been using this quarantine to commune with spices and all things summer-nice. This lockdown has been an eye-opener to us. Our parents stay in Madurai and were stuck in Chennai. Both of us work at an automobile firm. We usually take a summer break and go to our hometown for a week. Since that was not possible, weve taken it upon ourselves to learn cooking during this time. Amma teaches us simple recipes over video-calls. Ananth is fond of pickles, so he made a simple cut-mango pickle; he also learnt to make onion crackers from dad, who is an expert at it, shares Bharat.  Growing up, the brothers have seen the kitchen duties be equally divided between their parents. While their mother does the everyday cooking, their father anchors all the pickle and vadam-making activities. We did not do even the basics such as washing mangoes when we all lived under the same roof. The situation has pushed us to step out of our comfort zones to get a hands-on experience. Its been an exciting journey for two months now. We live in a single bedroom apartment. Some of the aunties in our neighbourhood appreciated us when they saw us drying the vadams, and fruit peels to make pickles on the terrace, early morning. Were managing with minimum ingredients, putting them to good use, shares Ananth, gushing with excitement.  Jars of nostalgia  For sisters Janani Ravi and Preethi Ravi, summer is about taking a break from being city slickers and visiting their hometown near Theni, to dig their teeth into their ammas summer specialities. But caught in the confines of the lockdown, the duo has been eating bites of nostalgia this year. Not a day went by without thinking of moms dry fish crackers and prawn pickle. I usually take leave for a week while my sister has a two-month-long vacation. Shed help amma with preparation from the first week of April. Back home, we live in an independent house and wed keep the materials for drying on the porch, in the backyard and on the terrace. We do not get that comfort here living in an apartment. Wed bring back more than 10 bottles of these non-vegetarian pickles and boxes of vadams for our friends, says Janani. Not willing to be separated from their staples, the duo decided to make their fix with instructions from their mother on video-calls.  We made a batch of fish and prawn pickle along with rice and dry fish crackers. Mom instructs and I follow. Since Im used to helping her often, I find it easier. She is equally upset that she wasnt able to make pickles in large quantities and distribute it to family members this year. Moms pickles are sought-after by family and friends. But it was fun preparing everything from scratch. Non-vegetarian pickles are more time-consuming. We have to devein the prawn, grind the masala with roller stone (that we bought recently), marinate for weeks in oil and rock salt, and only then devour. The quality of seafood and cost also varies. Most of our meals comprise only pickle and curd rice. Its filling and works out to be economical. Its considered to be a divine combination even at home, says Preethi.  Lessons for lifetime  The lockdown, however, has been a blessing in disguise for Parul Bhatt in fulfilling her summer duties. The lockdown was announced just before we were to go abroad with my daughter and grandchildren whod come for a vacation. What wouldve otherwise been a mundane pickle-making session was filled with laughter and enthusiasm shown from the little ones. I involved them in simple tasks such as cleaning, drying, that do not involve fire or sharp objects, says Parul, who started her brand Paruls Magic three years ago.  While the pandemic continues to stay stubborn, Paruls plans are anything but foiled. Keeping up the annual tradition, this year too she prepared eight varieties of her ancestral Gujarati pickles, including mango, chundo, lemon, garlic, methiya keri, channa and capsicum. Whats special about them? They are all hand-picked seasonal vegetables pickled in minimal oil and seasonings. The feisty grandmom and her grandchildren have been busy separating the spices, scraping the peels of veggies and preparing them to dry on the terrace.  This is the right age to keep children focussed and train them in the kitchen; they are sharp. They taste and tell me how much salt and spice is required. Im passing on the legacy to my grandchildren, just the way my grandmother once passed it on to me. This lockdown is a gentle reminder for us to slow down, calm ourselves and get back to the basics, says Parul. Truly so. Even as the COVID clouds continue to loom, this summer comes with a promise from these families that traditions and rituals emerging from the kitchen will always be pickled in the fragrance of legacy.  Minimalist staples  Pickles  Raw mango varieties, Cut-raw mango pickle, Grated raw mango pickle, Avakai pickle, Narthangai pickle, Lemon pickle  Vathal or rice crackers  Puffed rice vathal, Leftover rice vathal,  Sago vathal, Mor milagai,  Onion vathal",TOMATO

Instead, the Hinsdale, Ill.-based couple is taking their children, ages 11, 8, and 6, on a self-drive trip through South Dakota, Wyoming, and Montana, all planned with the help of SmartFlyer, a full-service travel company catering to high-end corporate and leisure travellers. In the past, the U.S. was always on the back burner, she says. We always rationalized flying somewhere, because it would introduce the kids to a different culture.  In the wake of the novel coronavirus, however, the great American road trip is getting an alluring makeover.  Forget the family Suburban and free, AAA-generated maps. The latest itineraries from outfitter Black Tomato, called Take the Open Road, are created in partnership with Auberge Resorts Collection and Mercedes-Benz. Travellers living within 100 miles of the car brands New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, or Atlanta flagships can request complimentary home delivery and pickup of vehicles that are pre-programmed with destination-specific playlists and stocked with picnic baskets.  Five-night trips start at nearly $5,000 per person, though such add-ons as two nights at a fully-serviced pop-up glamping site in Arches National Park in Utah can bring the price tag up to $18,875 per person.  In addition to overnights at Auberge properties, including Hotel Jerome in Aspen, Colo., and Calistoga Ranch in Napa Valley, Calif., the itineraries also include a private charter of an Americas Cup antique motor boat and truly away-from-the-crowds heli-hiking adventures.  For Black Tomato and many other travel outfitters, the humble road trip is emerging as a Hail Mary for travel outfitters to make up for months of lost revenue. Like many industries, we have to pivot and adjust to changing needs and demands, says SmartFlyers Robert Merlin, who has started to swap travellers summer trips to Europelike the Sundersonswith splashy U.S. drives.  If his new product is any indication, Black Tomato co-founder Tom Marchant agrees. His company ordinarily focuses on money-is-no-object voyages to places like Rwanda and Japan. Last year, domestic U.S. trips made up only 15% of Black Tomatos business, but the combination of scarce summer flights, wariness of taking to the skies, and extensive travel restrictions abroad are forcing change.  Marchant does, however, see a silver lining: We often find ourselves guilty of looking past incredible experiences that lay conveniently in our backyard.  King of the Road  Depending on what travellers are prioritizingsafety, nature, comfort, hospitalitythese glammed-up road trips can look very different. Risk-tolerant travellers craving a taste of the old normal are open to checking off Americas bucket-list attractions with the help of a driver, staying at remote luxury ranches along the way. Hyper-vigilant social distancers may prefer driving themselves and sleeping in a tricked-out RV.  Meredith Broder, an adviser at Avenue Two Travel, believes first-time road trippers will need some hand holding. You cant take a luxury traveller and suddenly make them king of the road, says Broder. You might be sleeping in a rock star vehicle, but youre most likely waking up in an RV park.  She remedies this by hiring drivers for clients and booking overnights in outdoorsy, five-star lodges such as Dunton Hot Springs in Colorado or the Lodge at Blue Sky in Utah. Shes hiring drivers exclusively from companies that follow guidelines recommended by the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention and having vehicles disinfected between trips.  Steppes Travel has found a middle ground with its new, two-week, $12,895-per-person Adventure in the American West trip. The self-drive itinerary includes privately guided 4x4 Jeep tours and heli-landings at remote parts of Utahs Rainbow Bridge National Monument. Also included in the price: the Steppes team is a call away, 24/7, should anything misfire or feel unsafe.  Thats comparable to the new itineraries from Abercrombie & Kent, whose road trips from L.A. to the Southwest and from Chicago to the West also have drivers and private guides. Not all national parks have five- or even four-star hotels, says A&K USA Managing Director Marty Behr of the current go-to destinations. Weve taken the extra steps to find high-end accommodations with separate [socially distant] buildings and in-room dining options. In the event of sudden outbreaks, he adds, his travellers have immediate access to Medivac transportation, telemedicine consults, flexible cancellation policies, and alternate routesmost of which come standard when booking with a reputable travel agent.  Close to Home, Yet Very Far Away  American travellers were already starting to pay closer attention to the cultural riches closer to home, even before Covid-19. Leah Smith, founder of Denver-based agency Tafari Travel, says thats because hotels across the U.S. have wised-up to the importance of sophisticated local experiences, whether cooking with a professional chef or learning about hieroglyphics with a historian.  Now border restrictions are intensifying the trend. The phone hasnt stopped ringing, says Sam Highley, founder of American road trip planner All Roads North. His service, which usually fills gaps for travel agents, rather than working directly with consumers, has seen more demand. What we excel at is the in-between places most Americans arent familiar with, he explains, such as the fly-fishing capital Paradise Valley, Mont., just north of Yellowstone.  The challenge, says Highly, is connecting very disparate destinations without airplanes. A lot of New Yorkers dont realize Montana is over 2,000 miles away and requires a 35-plus-hour drive, he explains. But people are deciding to make an experience of the journey.  Not Your Grandparents Vacation  Todays road tripper isnt just interested in Point A and Point B, and the focus on larger-than-life experiences can make these trips as much of a logistical challenge as an African safari. A U.S. road trip often has 40 different components, explains Highley. Among them are driving directions, where to catch the sunrise at the Grand Canyon, or which town plays host to the quirky Running of the Sheep. Theres also improved access to in-demand hotels such as Chico Hot Springs, a lodge with hot springs just north of Yellowstone in Montana. These are the details that make a road trip worth outsourcing, he notesand worth a price tag in the low five figures.  Not all travellers are ready to return to hotels. Jer Goss, president of luxury motorcoach company Goss RV, says that even without summer concert business, May rentals are on a par with 2019. These days, hes spending an hour vs. the typical 10 to 15 minutes on calls with potential renters. The first question is always: Where can I go, he says. People think of the standard KOA campground, but we have connections at luxury motorcoach resorts that feel like the Ritz, with golf courses and pools and room service. Hearthside Grove, an RV resort in Petoskey, Mich., even brings in local chefs to host cooking classes.  As for the motorcoaches, they have all the amenities of a five star hotel, including gourmet kitchens, living rooms, flatscreen TVs, and Wi-Fi. Even the price tag is comparable: Weeklong rentals top out at $40,000, the price of a Mercedes C300. If you saved for Lake Como this summer and end up at Lake Michigan, at least you can stay in style.  (This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text.

(Ryan Christopher Jones/The New Yo... Read MoreNEW YORK: Inside a low, brick-red building in Queens Village, a group of about 30 cooks has made and served more than 145,000 free meals in just 10 weeks. They arrive at 4 a.m. three days a week to methodically assemble vast quantities of basmati rice, dal, beans and vibrantly flavored sabzis for New York City hospital workers, people in poverty and anyone else in search of a hot meal.This isn't a soup kitchen or a food bank. It's a gurdwara, the place of worship for Sikhs, members of the fifth-largest organized religion in the world, with about 25 million adherents. Providing for people in need is built into their faith.An essential part of Sikhism is langar, the practice of preparing and serving a free meal to promote the Sikh tenet of seva, or selfless service. Anyone, Sikh or not, can visit a gurdwara and partake in langar, with the biggest ones  like the Golden Temple in Amritsar, India  serving more than 100,000 people every day.Since the coronavirus pandemic has halted religious gatherings in most of the country, including langar, gurdwaras like the Sikh Center of New York, in Queens Village, are mobilizing their large-scale cooking resources to meet the skyrocketing need for food aid outside their places of worship.Some are feeding the protesters marching in outrage over the killings of George Floyd and other black Americans by police. Last week, a dozen or so volunteers from the Queens center served 500 portions of matar paneer, rice and rajma, a creamy, comforting dish of red beans stewed with tomatoes, and 1,000 bottles of water and cans of soda to demonstrators in Sunnyside. They also offered dessert: kheer, a sweetened rice pudding.""Where we see peaceful protest, we are going,"" said Himmat Singh, a coordinator at the World Sikh Parliament , an advocacy group providing volunteers for the Queens Village efforts. ""We are looking for justice. We support this.""Since the pandemic began, soup kitchens have had difficulty keeping up with demand. Shuttered schools and even fine-dining restaurants are using their kitchens to prepare and serve hot meals. But few other places are as well positioned to handle the sheer scale of assistance required right now as the gurdwaras. Most have large, well-equipped kitchens, a steady stream of volunteers and no shortage of ingredients, thanks to regular donations from community members.During the last annual Sikh Day Parade in New York, in April 2019, the Queens Village kitchen  which has a walk-in cooler, multiple freezers, 50-liter stockpots and a huge grill that can cook dozens of rotis at once  produced 15,000 meals in a single day.The Sikhs' biggest challenge isn't keeping up with demand. It's letting people know that they're here  without making a big show of it or proselytizing, which is forbidden.Founded in the 15th century in Punjab, India, by the spiritual leader Guru Nanak, Sikhism has an estimated 500,000 followers in the United States and 280 gurdwaras, according to the Sikh Coalition, a civil-rights organization in New York City. One of the most visibly distinctive features of the Sikh practice is the turban  a symbol of the religion's belief in equality  though not everyone chooses to wear one.Sikhs in America have often been prey to bigotry, hate crimes and Islamophobia, particularly since 9/11. A few volunteers said in interviews that before going out to distribute meals, they worried that they might hear ignorant comments. But Santokh Dillon, president of the Guru Nanak Mission Society of Atlanta, said the people he serves are often more puzzled than prejudiced. Most have never even heard of Sikhism, he said.When some find out that the meals are free, ""They look at us and say, You are kidding, right?' ""At least 80 gurdwaras in the United States are now providing food assistance. For many, the transition has been quick and seamless.This is not just because the infrastructure is already there, said Satjeet Kaur, executive director of the Sikh Coalition. ""The call to action and the responsibility"" for helping others is deeply entrenched in the Sikh way of life. Sikhs are expected to donate at least 10% of their time or income toward community service.It took the Gurdwara Sahib of Fremont, California, just a few days after suspending religious services in March to set up a meal and grocery delivery program, and a drive-through meal pickup system outside the gurdwara.Cooks wear gloves and masks, and the kitchen is big enough for workers to stand more than six feet from one another. As at most gurdwaras, the menu changes regularly, but is typically Indian and always vegetarian. (Meat is not permitted in gurdwaras.)While these Sikh volunteers, known as sevadars, are experts in mass-meal preparation, they aren't as accustomed to spreading the word. The Fremont kitchen has produced 15,000 to 20,000 meals a day on holidays like New Year's Eve, said Dr. Pritpal Singh, a member of the gurdwara. But now, the gurdwara is serving just 100 to 150 people each day.Pritpal Singh said he hoped that more people in need would come pick up food. ""We could do hundreds of thousands of meals if given the task,"" he said.But with the demonstrations unfolding around the country, Sikhs aren't waiting for people to come to them any longer. On Tuesday, volunteers from the Gurdwara Sahib attended a protest in Fremont and handed out several hundred bottles of water as a show of solidarity.On a recent Friday, Gurjiv Kaur and Kiren Singh asked the volunteers at their gurdwara, the Khalsa Care Foundation, in the Pacoima neighborhood of Los Angeles, to prepare meals in the community kitchen that they could take to the protest. The next morning, they and others picked up about 700 containers of pasta with a garlic- and onion-laden tomato sauce and 500 bottles of water from the gurdwara, and set up a tent in Pan Pacific Park. Soon, protesters started arriving at the tent with other donations, like medical supplies, snacks and hand sanitizer.""It is our duty to stand up with others to fight for justice,"" said Kaur, a graduating senior at the University of California, Irvine. ""Langar at its core is a revolution  against inequality and the caste system,"" the antiquated hereditary class structure in South Asia, which Sikhism has always rejected.In Norwich, Connecticut, volunteers from five gurdwaras handed out a few hundred bottles of water to protesters last Tuesday, and on Friday, distributed as many containers of rajma, or kidney beans, and rice on a Main Street sidewalk, a block from City Hall.Swaranjit Singh Khalsa, a volunteer and a member of the Norwich Board of Education, noted that historically, many Sikhs in India have been killed by the police while fighting for their civil rights.At many gurdwaras in the United States, most of those who show up for langar meals are Sikhs. Now that they are catering to a broader population, menus have changed to suit different tastes. In the Seattle area, volunteers at the Gurudwara Sacha Marag Sahib are making pasta and tacos in addition to rice and dal.At the Hacienda de Guru Ram Das in Espaola, New Mexico, meals have included enchiladas and burritos. Still, Harimandir Khalsa, a volunteer, said the community kitchen is operating at less than 10% of its capacity.""I think it is about convenience,"" Khalsa said, as the gurdwara isn't centrally located. ""If we had a food truck parked in front of Walmart that said, Free food,' we could get more takers. But for people to get in their cars and drive over to this place  people aren't that desperate yet.""Location is also an issue for the Guru Ramdas Gurdwara Sahib in Vancouver, Washington, as the neighborhood doesn't have much foot traffic, said Mohan Grewal, the gurdwara secretary. So every other Sunday, volunteers pack up 300 to 400 meals made in the gurdwara and drive them to the Living Hope Church, a Christian congregation six miles away, in a more urban part of the city.One of the biggest challenges for gurdwaras is that many hospitals, shelters and other charitable organizations they would like to help don't take cooked food because of hygienic concerns, or accept it only if it meets certain health codes. Many Sikhs have started collecting and distributing pantry items in addition to making meals.Still, some gurdwaras are bustling. In Riverside, California, a hub for the Sikh population, volunteers from the United Sikh Mission , an American nonprofit aid group, and the Khalsa School Riverside, a children's program, serve 3,000 to 5,000 meals every day at the Riverside Gurdwara. People line up in the drive-through as early as 9:30 a.m., even though it doesn't open until 11:30.The process is highly systematized. The cooking team shows up at 5:30 a.m. to prepare meals based on previous days' numbers, as well as requests from senior centers, hospitals and nursing homes; another team packs the meals into microwave-safe boxes; and the third distributes them at the drive-through and other locations. The gurdwara shares information about the free meals through regular posts on large Facebook groups for local residents.""We didn't just sit there and say we are going to cook and wait for people to come,"" said Gurpreet Singh, a volunteer for the United Sikh Mission.Since the protests, Gurpreet Singh and others have been reaching out to black organizations, like churches, offering to drop off meals or groceries. They expect to see an increase in people showing up for meals, as thousands have been attending protests in the area.Groups like United Sikhs, an international nonprofit, are helping to get the word out. They have stepped up efforts to identify areas of need, connect gurdwaras with organizations seeking assistance, provide best practices for food preparation during the pandemic and mobilize Sikhs to help feed protesters.While the pandemic continues, a few gurdwaras aren't using their kitchens. Tejkiran Singh, a spokesman for the Singh Sabha of Michigan, west of Detroit, said the gurdwara committee decided it was too risky to start a meal distribution service, especially since Michigan has become a hot spot for the coronavirus.When the Sikh Society of Central Florida, in Oviedo, reopens on June 14, services will be limited to fewer people, and food will be handed out in to-go containers as they leave.But Amit Pal Singh and Charanjit Singh, the chairman and the treasurer of the Sikh Society of Central Florida, also want to continue the drive-through and delivery services they developed during the pandemic.""The concept of langar is to serve the needy,"" Pal Singh said. Before the pandemic, he said, most people participating in langar were local Sikhs coming more for social and religious reasons than out of need. The drive-through and deliveries will allow them to put meals into the hands of people who struggle to afford to eat.That will mean a lot of extra food for volunteers to prepare, in a city where the Sikh population is still small. But none of that seemed to worry Pal Singh.""We would love to be in that situation,"" he said, his optimism vibrating through the phone. ""We will handle it.""",TOMATO

Two temples  the Murugan temple in Tiruttani and the Narasimhar temple in Sholingar  agreed to supply us food. We picked up the packets by 11 a.m., every day, and distributed the food.

Based on requests  Sources in the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments (HR&CE) Department said that the food was cooked and supplied on the basis of requests from local revenue officials.  During the initial days, the numbers swelled to over 42,000 packets a day. It then stabilised at 23,000-odd packets a day. The numbers have climbed down further due to relaxations in lockdown norms. We will provide food till there is a requirement, said an official source.  Temples have spent 2.25 crore on supplying food to the poor, so far. They have supplied mixed rice varieties like tomato rice, lemon rice, vegetable rice and tamarind rice, since the items are easy to cook, pack and distribute. Usually, temple kitchens serve over 65,000 persons, every day.",TOMATO

While the Americans have been panic purchasing and hoarding toilet paper, many Indians have been stocking their fridge with fruits and vegetables. We too stocked up and then a few days into the lockdown, we opened our fridge to bundles of drooping greens, peeling skins and softened veggies. We spoke to homemakers, chefs and food enthusiasts to find different ways in which one can make fruits and veggies last longer  Wrap it up Leafy greens like spinach and coriander stay fresh much longer when wrapped in newspaper. Ideally, leafy greens must be consumed within the first three days. However, you can extend its life by wrapping the leaf in a paper (newspapers will do too). The paper absorbs the moisture from the leaf which stops it from rotting too fast, says Dr Shilpi Ray, geriatric specialist based in Chennai.  Tomato troubles Most Indians love to buy tomatoes in bulk. This vegetable which is used generously in most of our foods also runs the risk of rotting if not used after a few days of purchase, depending on the ambient conditions. One way to save your tomatoes is to keep them outside the fridge in a bowl lined with paper napkins. Contrary to popular belief, tomatoes fare badly in cold temperatures. They lose flavour and texture when refrigerated, says D Nitin, a food enthusiast and home cook.  Ice bath = nice bath Who doesnt love a crispy bite of lettuce leaves in a burger or salad? The best way to revive wilted leaves is by dunking them in an ice bath. The cold temperature awakens the crispy leaves and helps revive their freshness, says Mallika Binny Krishna, home-maker and food enthusiast. She adds that the ice bath helps revive nutrition as well.  Frozen for health The simplest and most widely used method to have your fruits and vegetables last longer is to slice them and freeze them in ziplock bags. Before storing them, blanching fruits and vegetables in hot water helps keep the bacteria away. Items like cucumber, broccoli, capsicum, cabbage, brinjals and mushrooms are some that can be stored using this method. One can store strawberries, bananas, watermelons and grapes too, says Kishan Mahalingam, a nutritionist, adding that fruits can be sliced before being frozen.  Apples and potatoes When potatoes are stored for over two weeks they begin to sprout buds. To increase the lifespan, try storing apples and potatoes together outside the fridge. The ethylene gas produced by apples can make potatoes last for around eight weeks. When the potatoes begin to sprout buds, it means that germination has begun. The vegetable will eventually blacken and die if the shoots are not catered to. Apples prevent the potato shoots from sprouting. This increases the lifetime of the potato, says Salma Hyder, food enthusiast.  Capping the stalk No one likes to eat the squishy part of a banana. The fruit has a life span of just about four days before the fruit flies come buzzing. One easy way to store bananas is to cover its stalk with an aluminium foil or plastic wrap. It prevents the stalk from drying up quickly, hence, keeping the banana fresh, says Kishan.",TOMATO

Decades later, the award-winning chef has an upscale food hall on that very street and will serve 40,000 meals this week across the city where he built his dreams, and which is now the U.S. epicenter of the Coronavirus pandemic.  Andres, whose restaurants in the United States include The Bazaar, Jaleo and the two Michelin-starred Somni, founded World Central Kitchen in 2010. It has served over 15 million meals worldwide after hurricanes, wildfires and other disasters.  Since the pandemic, his organization has served more than 7,50,000 meals from Miami and Los Angeles to Little Rock, Arkansas, and Fairfax, Virginia. It works out of places like libraries, food trucks and shuttered restaurants, feeding 125 hospitals, students in school lunch programmes and even quarantined cruise ship passengers.  Andres has amassed an A-list network around the world, relying on celebrity chef pals including Rachael Ray, Guy Fieri and Marcus Samuelsson to feed the hungry and buoy the humble restaurant kitchens across America where many started their careers.  In New York City, he set up a cafe to serve the Mount Sinai field hospital in Central Park. In Harlem, he has using Chopped TV judge Samuelssons Red Rooster restaurant to feed families.  Samuelssons Miami restaurant hasnt opened to the public yet, but instead of leaving it empty, he turned it over to World Central Kitchen. They are serving sandwiches and salads there to laid-off hospitality workers, homeless residents and Uber drivers.  Recent meals at senior centers in Washington, D.C., included creamy tomato pasta with spring vegetables, and cilantro rice bowls with spiced chickpeas and spinach topped with citrus vinaigrette and crispy tortillas.  Andres was among the first to close his restaurants, hoping to create a blueprint for chefs around the world on how to use their restaurants and employ workers while feeding the hungry. This operation is growing every day, he said. In California, Fieri is on standby, ready with a 48-foot-long (15-meter-long) rescue kitchen and support team. Guy is ready to go, Andres said. This is like war. You need to have troops ready for action.  Fieri compared his longtime friendship with Andres and other famous chefs to playing in a band.  When you hang out with generous, philanthropist warlords like Jose Andres, all you want to do is go bigger, go better, said Fieri, who cooked alongside Andres during last years California wildfires.  In the early days of the outbreak, Fieri, the TV host of Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives, also wanted to do more. He bought $50,000 in gift cards to support local restaurants. He sent dozens of personalized videos to CEOs from big food companies seeking donations.  As diners, were always the ones asking restaurants for help. We ask the servers to take special care of our tables, the bartenders to listen to our stories and the bussers to clean up our messes, Fieri said. He described the program as a big warm blanket, as if to say, Hey, we got you. Its our turn to help you for once. Ray announced a $4 million donation Tuesday from her two charities. Half will go to feeding and nutritional programs, including World Central Kitchen. The other half will support animal rescue, feeding and veterinary programs.  We are not a disaster relief fund by origin or desire but thats what weve become quite frankly in the last couple of years, she told the AP in a phone interview. Andres organization is one of the largest recipients.  In Minnesota, Chef Andrew Zimmern was among the first there to shutter his restaurants, fearing for his workers safety. Next, he cobbled together the Independent Restaurant Coalition, hiring lobbyists to be a voice in Washington for restaurants, especially mom-and-pop ones. He noted that such restaurants are many peoples first jobs, as teens, and are top employers of single moms and those transitioning from prison.  We cant fail. (Restaurants) have to be open and ready to welcome their workers back, said Zimmern. If we cant do that, it will be an economic and humanitarian cultural catastrophe.",TOMATO

It was used (mind you, in a very matter-of-fact way, with no malice intended) to describe any football-loving, churchgoing Goan girl or boy who resided anywhere from Mahim creek to the outer edges of Santa Cruz. What or who maca was held no interest for us. It was the paav part that we were fascinated by.  You see, while the rest of us ate chapatis or rice at every meal, rumour had it that these lucky lads and lasses, whose great-uncles and grandfathers had moved from Goa to Mumbai along with their bread-making skills, ate paav with everything. Paav with omelette, paav with potato bhaaji, paav with mutton curry, paav with soup, paav with kheema, paav with rassa, paav with fried prawns, paav with cutlets. You name it and they sopped it up with paav, much to our envy.  In our ghaati household (another Mumbai moniker for locals from the Western Ghats), paav was rationed. Not because it was expensive (at 25 paise for a laadi or slab of 6, it was not) but because my grandmother didnt consider it suitable food. For a woman who lugged back 5 kilos of the choicest ground wholegrain wheat flour from the mill and transformed it into robust, brown-flecked chapatis, this paav made from insipid white flour was an absolute affront.  She would rather we ate batate poha for breakfast, but the fact that lunch for the officegoers in the family had to be ready to be picked up at 8.45 a.m. by the dabbawallah meant there was no time to cook breakfast. So, with a pained look and much clucking of the tongue, she resigned herself to watching her junglee grandchildren falling over themselves to get at the paav, which she served with a pat of her homemade butter and a cup of extra milky tea to compensate for its lack of sustenance. As you might have guessed, we loved paav. And what was not to love? White all around and pale brown on top. We could have eaten them by the dozen. Instead, we got two each for breakfast. As an incentive, the cousin whose turn it was to wake at 5.30 a.m. to fetch the paavs would be allowed one extra paav. When my turn came, I would eat my extra paav on the way back, tearing eagerly into its warm, pillowy insides.  Bakers den  The bakery where we lined up at dawn was just across the road. A small shopfront with no signboard, it had soot-laden walls and one flickering lamp hanging from a cracked ceiling. A pink and green icon of baby Jesus was nailed to the back wall and flour covered most of his cherubic face and body. Actually, flour covered most of the counter, the aluminium trays and the neatly stacked sheets of old newspapers. Under baby Jesus watch was a dark cavern from which another boy, his face and singlet also covered in flour, would pop out and thump down a large tray of plump paavs. The man at the counter would push the change you placed on the counter into an open drawer, tear off the paavs, wrap them in a newspaper and shoo you away.  Back then, nobody had ovens at home, so what exactly went on inside that black hole aroused immense curiosity. It was rumoured that drunkards were hired to knead the dough through the night and that they kneaded it with their dirty feet. Once, it seems, a child had stayed back to watch and he got kneaded right in.  But mostly we were preoccupied with the paavs life story. How did it fluff up like this? We had heard whispers of some germs called yeast that were fed in. We also knew there was a bhatti into which wood had to be constantly fed. Our requests to see the bhatti were never taken seriously.  More to bread  Later, as reforms started trickling in, came the Sandwich Breads. Unlike paav, these didnt need to be bought fresh daily and you didnt need to queue up at the crack of dawn for them. It wasnt long before the bakery opposite our house shut down and a dry-cleaning shop took its place.  Soon we grew up and went to college. And then a new kind of bread arrived in our lives which displaced our affections yet again. This hand-span sized disc of thick white bread was sold in twos for a rather princely amount. On the plastic cover was written Pizza Base but for the longest time, we knew it simply as pizza paav, and there was a colourful picture of what you could do with it once you took it home.  So we took it home and recreated the picture faithfully. On top of the pizza paav, we shook a bottle of tomato sauce till its surface was covered in red blobs. Then came one layer of onion rings, one layer of capsicum rings, one layer of tomato rings.  Over this heap of balancing vegetables, were grated two cubes of cheese, their streaky stringy bits rendering the entire surface white. This wobbly thumb-high arrangement was delicately transferred to a heating tava and covered with another large upturned vessel till the cheese melted completely. For the next 15 messy minutes or so that it took us to devour it, we were in raptures. We finally knew what America tasted like.  It would be another 10 years before I would travel to Italy and finally know what a pizza tasted like. And another 10 years more before I would muster up the courage to buy an oven and try my hand at bread-making.  But when it came to baking my own breads, I found I had inherited my grandmothers distrust of white flour. Maida just wouldnt do. Well, learning to make bread from chakki-ground whole grain atta wasnt easy. It required a certain amount of navet, patience and a family that would stoically put up with frequent disasters.  A decade and thousands of loaves later, there are many lessons to share. First and foremost, real bread needs no maida, no sugar, no oil, no improver. Bread is just whole grain flour, salt, yeast and water. And the reassurance that bread-making is like every other thing we do in life. Breads turn out terrible at first, they get better and better with practice, till finally a day comes when your loaf sings, the crust crackles, and your family cannot stomach store-bought bread ever again.  SUNDAY RECIPE  Failproof bread  Photo: Getty Images/ iStock  INGREDIENTS  3 cups whole wheat atta, preferably ground with its husk  1 tsp salt  1 tsp yeast (instant or active)  2 cups water + a few tbsp more  METHOD  1. Knead it all, adding 2 cups of water. (If using active yeast, first proof it as per the packet instructions and then add it to the flour.) The dough will be sticky, so pour a few tablespoons of water in a plate. Now, dip your sticky palm face down in the water, lift it and shake off the excess water. Using the wet palm, get back to work with the dough, which will behave better now. Whenever it starts becoming sticky again, wet your palm again in the plate and knead it. When it comes together into a ball and your fingers are clean of all stickiness, your dough is ready. Keep it in a large bowl and cover with a plate.  2. Come back after 90 minutes and check on the dough. It will have doubled in size. Make a fist and knock it gently back into the bowl. Now shape it gently into a ball or an oblong depending on the shape of your bread pan. Handle it like a baby. Grease the pan with butter and drop the dough in the pan. Put the bread pan in the cold oven for another round of rising and come back after 50 minutes.  3. Take out the bread pan. Preheat an empty oven on toast (top and bottom rod on) mode to 250C for 10 minutes. Now change the settings to 220C, 30 minutes and bake (bottom rod on) mode. Take a small pair of scissors and with a light hand, quickly make 3 equidistant snips on the surface of the dough and put the bread pan in the centre rack.  4. After 15 minutes, open the oven door and turn the bread around. After 15 more minutes, remove bread from pan and knock on its bottom. It should make a hollow sound; that means the bread is done. Let it cool for 4-5 hours before serving  The writer lives in Bengaluru with herself, one husband, one daughter and one oven.",TOMATO

He added that the Chittoor SP had sent some messages on WhatsApp on how ambulances were stuck because of the walls which were meant to block vehicle movement as part of a stricter lockdown to control the COVID-19 pandemic.

Motorists plying with permission through Ponnai were diverted through entry/exit points in Christianpet and Serkkadu while those moving through Sainagunta were advised to take the Paradrami check post.

Since vehicles carrying essential goods, including milk, could not pass through the check posts, the Vellore district administration was requested to remove the walls, Renuka said.  Revenue department officers said that a huge quantity of milk and vegetables, including tomato and cabbage, were being transported through Ponnai and Sainagunta check posts every day from Andhra Pradesh to Koyambedu market. The blocking of the two key routes led to unnecessary hassles in operating trucks carrying essential goods.",TOMATO

That honour belongs to the humble rasam (meaning: essence). No wonder, then, that rasam has emerged as the most popular dish during COVID-19 lockdown.  Apart from being the simplest dish, one can prepare rasam with minimal ingredients, and it can be had as soup or mixed with rice and eaten. But preparing rasam requires knowledge, expertise and experience, says 64-year-old Usha Prabhakaran, author of the soon-to-be-launched Rasam Digest, a book with 1,000 different rasam recipes.  A lawyer by profession, Usha shot to fame in 1998, when her Pickle Digest, a book with 1,000 pickle recipes, was published. Actually, I collected almost 3000 recipes but I had to pick 1000 [for the book], says Usha, who got the Pickle Queen moniker soon after. Over time, I have developed the knack of extracting recipes from anyone and everyone I come across, adds Usha, who credits her mother-in-law, Chandra Lakshmi, for lighting her passion for cooking, who at the age of 83 still actively engages herself in cooking as well as shopping for ingredients. The nuances I learnt from her but the numerous tips and tricks I gathered over a period of time, Usha says.  The book has sections like Modest Pleasures (rasam from plant stems, leaves and rind-based), Hard to Resist Residual Wonder (rasam made with the residue of chutney or thogayal) and Quick Serves (instant rasam), Dynamic Diet, Heritage Sustenance, Physician at your Door, Dazzling Superstars, among others.  Achieving critical mass  For a perfect rasam, balancing the tamarind (sourness), adding spices and seasoning, which helps lock the flavour in, is critical. Sourness can be derived from tamarind, tomato, sour buttermilk or just dal water, says Usha, adding that rasam fits everyones budget, can be prepared with minimal ingredients, or if one or two of the basic ingredients are not available. Basic ingredients can be interchanged if one is unavailable, like moong dal can be swapped for toor dal. The dish can be prepared, tasted and changed to your desired taste all through the process of cooking. Most importantly, it is a medicinal preparation that plays a significant role throughout an individuals life from birth to old age, says Usha, adding, Which is why I have dedicated a section in the book to age-appropriate rasams, titled Birth to Adulthood.  Rasam can be made out of almost anything. Have you ever tasted pea peel rasam, or betel leaf rasam? How about jamoon rasam? Did you know that we can make rasam using jackfruit seed, watermelon rind, kodukkapuli, hibiscus flower and bamboo shoot?, she asks.  Even peels and plant stems, which are usually discarded, can be used. When we were in Kerala, our domestic helper used to collect banana peels and take it home. Out of curiosity, I asked her what she would do with them, and that is how I learnt to make banana peel rasam. Similarly, keera thandu, murunga keera and agathi keera lend themselves well for the dish. Rasam made with stems of mint, coriander and curry leaves will taste heavenly, says Usha.  Kicking up flavours  Ingredients to garnish ought to be added to ghee in a particular order. Once the ladle is hot with oil, add the urad. When it turns light brown and gives out aroma, add the mustard. As it starts to splutter, add red chillies, fenugreek seeds, cumin and curry leaves (in that order) and then pour it over the rasam. Thaalippu or garnish is the crown, so it has to be perfect, she says. If it gets burnt, just discard it and redo. In some families, they sprinkle a little water after garnishing and this is to lock the flavour.  Ushas rasam podi recipe:  Ingredients    200 gms each of Tanjore (gundu), Salem (neetu) and Bedige chillies  600 gms coriander seeds  200 gms each of pepper, jeera and fenugreek  1/4 of LG asafoetida bar  6 to 10 turmeric sticks  10 sprigs of sun-dried curry leaves  2 large fistfuls toor dal  1 fistful moong dal (optional)  1 fistful urad dal  1 fistful channa dal  Method  Sun-dry the ingredients and grind them to medium coarse in a mill.  While assembling the dish, crushing curry leaves, tomato and coriander leaves together with crystal salt and tamarind water brings out the best flavour. A slit green chilli and a blob of jaggery enhance the taste, she adds. Usha also notes that rasam is best made using an eeya chombu (a vessel made out of tin-aluminium alloy that has a broad base and narrow neck), clay pot or soapstone pot.  The eeya chombu is designed in such a manner that the aroma and flavour rotate within the vessel when it is mixed with a ladle, she says, adding a word of caution, Never use cast iron to make rasam. Another important trick is assembling the rasam. You got to crush curry leaves, tomato and coriander leaves with crystal salt along with tamarind water to get that magical taste and flavour, and this comes with practice.  Usha has listed wide range of rasam podi recipes in her book. Now coming to rasam podi, Usha insists that sun drying all the ingredients will result in aromatic rasam. The rule can be relaxed and ingredients roasted in a pan only during rainy days. Depending on usage, rasam podi can be stored for upto six months. Another reason why some never get it right is they might let the preparation boil over and this might ruin the flavour. When it is about to boil, switch off, garnish and close immediately. Use only ghee for garnishing as ghee acts as the vehicle for absorbing the goodness of the spices used. And the rasam connoisseur that she is, she insists she has prepared each of the 1,000 rasams in her book at least five times.  The book is targeted at Indian and international audiences, and has a detailed description of all 350 ingredients with a photograph, its medicinal value, taste and usage. I have also provided tips on how to buy and store these ingredients.  Adirasam delight  A rasam connoisseur would always go for Adi rasam or the mandi, which is nothing but what settles at the bottom of the vessel. Once you understand the value of mandi, you will never miss it. The best way to serve rasam is to give it a good mix with a ladle and then serve it.  Regional fare  The herbal concoction predominantly made in Southern states is called Rasam in Tamil Nadu. Chaaru in Andhra and Saaru in Konkan and Karnataka, the preparation usually an everyday affair is an essential part of the South Indian cusine.  Seasonal Rasam  Gita Rajamani, a food blogger whose You Tube channel, Agrahara Recipes, documents tradtional vegetarian recipes handed over from generations says that each of the spices has healing properties and is essentially facts as an immunity booster. Rasam preparation in households depends on the season, for example during the rainy season Jeera Milagu Rasam and Milagu rasam is the staple.  During the Covid 19 crisis, the septuagenarian recommends Kandanthippili and Sadakuppai rasam, which is a remedy for fever, cold and cough. As it is easily digestible, rasam is suitable for people of all age groups, and for diabetic population, she recommends Goddu rasam or the mild rasam with minimal ingredients and buttermilk rasam.  Nutritious Konkani Saaru  Food blogger Divya Kudua, who specialises in Kerala and Konkani cuisine, says that in Kerala rasam never takes the centrestage, but is always a mild concoction made using jeera and pepper, usually served as an after meal digestive drink. In Konkani cuisine Saaru is prepared using the tamarind, dal and coconut.  Usually on Fridays we make Channa water rasam, which is more like a soup and not necessarily mixed with rice and eaten. Saaru as we call it, is a nutritious dish suitable for all age groups, says Divya.  Instagram@divyakudua  Raw, no fuel  In Andhra and Telangana region, there are numerous variations of Chaaru (rasam). Depending on the region, the ingredients that goes into this spiced up broth varies, says Chef Thimma Reddy, The Park, Hyderabad.. He observes that the usage of garlic is high in these states, and more red chillies are used in the place of pepper corns. Considered a poor mans food, the dishs highlight is the garnishing, he says.  His favorite is the Pacchi Pulusu, which does not require cooking and is raw. Pacchi pulusu can be prepared in a jiffy, and the most important aspect is the mixing of all the ingredients in the tamarind water with ones hands  Ingredients:  100 grams Tamarind  25 grams Green chilli  00 grams Onion  10 grams Curry leaves  10 grams Coriander leaves  10 grams Jaggery  25 ml Oil  10 grams Cumin seeds  10 grams Dry red chilli  Salt to taste  500 ml Water  Method: Soak tamarind for 30 minutes in water, squeeze and extract the pulp. Slit the green chilli, roast on direct flame until it darkens and skin it off. Roughly crush all the ingredients, roasted chilli, onion, coriander using mortar and pestle. In a bowl, add water, tamarind pulp, jaggery, crushed ingredients and salt to taste. Tempering: Heat the oil, add cumin seeds, dry red chilli and curry leaves, pour the tempering over the raw tamarind rasam and mix well.  Recipe by Chef Thimma Reddy, The Park, Hyderabad",TOMATO

Take butter chicken. I remember the time when I used to look at it with disdain, and I must confess I still shudder when I think of the butter chicken pasta that a friend served me some years ago.  There was a time when I had it almost every day. I used to often dine at my friend Rajus house in my youth, and since that family loved the butter chicken from a place called TPO, next to Rivoli Theatre, it often formed a part of the dinner menu. I suppose familiarity bred contempt somewhere along the way. But I realised the dish had potential when, years later, I cooked it at home, balancing the cream with tomato ketchup and a nutty paste. Then, a couple of years ago, I had some great butter chicken delivered by a Rajasthani outlet called Roomaligarh, and decided that it was a dish that I could live with.  Last week, it featured in our dinner order. I had been reading the online menu of a place called Faasos with some interest. It delivers food in Delhi (and elsewhere, too). We decided to have the Smoked Butter Chicken Royal Meal (310), Bhuna Mutton Royal Meal (420) and Sabudana Khichdi (190). I ordered through Swiggy, but Faasos has its own app, too. The centralised phone number is 7700020020.  The meal came on a tray with compartments, which had been plastic wrapped and then boxed. The site tells us that they have a system of contactless delivery and temperature tracking of kitchen and delivery staff. I loved the way the bhuna gosht meal had been described. It consisted of succulent boneless mutton in thick tomato gravy, served with basmati rice, dal makhni, paratha and gulab jamun. The Smoked Butter Chicken Royal Platter had all the side dishes, too. The Sabudana Khichdi came with curd. But I dont think that is a dish one should order, for it was rather dry by the time it reached our doorstep. I suppose sago khichdi has to be eaten when it is just off the stove.  I tried out a piece of the butter chicken, and liked it. It was, indeed, smoky, and the gravy was nicely tart (though I think it would have been perfect had it been just a wee bit sweeter). The rice was long-grained, and the dal was deliciously thick and creamy.  The bhuna gosht was almost like the Bengali kosha mangsho. I had the crispy and flaky parathas with the meat, and enjoyed the meal immensely.  What was disappointing was the gulab jamun  not the taste, for I had no complaints there, but the size. Each royal meal dish came with one gulab jamun, and we had to cut each into three pieces , so that the three-member household could have two slivers each. A small gulab jamun, further cut, was not much of a dessert. But, still, it did its tiny bit.  There is a lot more on the menu  including Chhola Kulcha Meal (145), Palak Chicken Meal (220), Rajma Masala Bowl (145) and various kinds of biryanis. There are wraps, too  Barbecue Chicken (230), American Smoky Sausage (230), Mutton Overload (290), and Cheese Melt Paneer Wrap (165).  There is a breakfast section which includes an Aloo Paratha and Omelette Combo (165) and Pancake with Honey and Chocolate Sauce (170).  I enjoyed my meal, the size of the gulab jamun notwithstanding. I am wondering if I should try out the wraps one day. Must find out just how overloaded the Mutton Overload Wrap is.  The writer is a seasoned food critic",TOMATO

(Source: Getty/Thinkstock Images) You can conveniently grow some fruits and veggies in your home/kitchen gardens. (Source: Getty/Thinkstock Images)  The COVID-19 outbreak and the subsequent apprehensions over eating out at restaurants post-lockdown has shifted the focus back to organic produce. The quarantine period has also inspired individuals to consider growing their own food and becoming self-sufficient towards their daily needs.  Organic food arguably boasts of a higher nutritional value, and most importantly, is devoid of any additives. Moreover, there is a certain satisfaction that comes from knowing that the produce is fresh, natural and grown and processed in front of your eyes.  Below, we share a few vegetables that you can conveniently grow in your home/kitchen gardens:  Radish  The aroma of freshly grown radish can be heady, especially for a newbie. Summertime is, in fact, the best time of the year to plant these and harvested easily in a short span of time.  Coriander  One of the most commonly used herbs, coriander also perishes easily. Growing coriander is a matter of just two to three days; all you need to do is casually throw in some coriander seeds in damp soil and leave it to sprout.  Lemongrass  Perhaps the most piquant herb to start ones day, a lemongrass plant can easily be grown in the smallest of areas. It can be a great addition to your early morning tea, setting a positive tone for the day ahead.  Tomato  If you spot over-bright reddened tomatoes in the markets, they may be a result of chemicals added in higher proportions to fertilisers. However, organically produced tomatoes mostly present a light-green or yellow colour, with only a tinge of red. They also have a sweet taste.  Methi  Fenugreek or methi is another leafy vegetable that can be cultivated in our own backyard. There is an innate freshness in these leaves, harvested swiftly after the monsoon season. Apart from cooking methi leaves, its seeds could also be used as flavouring and when consumed with water, they have the potential of acting as a digestive too.",TOMATO

Each district in the state is being set a monthly target in terms of the area of coverage for vegetable cultivation and farmers will be given incentives accordingly, officials of the Tamil Nadu Horticulture and Plantation Crops Department said.  This will help sustain the supply chain and offset the impact of the pandemic.  Encouraging farmers to take up vegetable cultivation will increase production and sustain the supply chain and there will be no shortage of greens in the future, a senior officer told The New Indian Express.  The department has already swung into action to reach out to the people during the pandemic by getting veggies to their doorsteps through mobile vans and E.Thottam, an online platform for selling vegetables and fruits.  In North Arcot region, a range of vegetables is being cultivated.  Vellore district has been set a target of 300 hectares for vegetable cultivation for the current month while Tirupathur and Ranipet districts are set 300 hectares and 250 hectares respectively.  Brinjal is prominently cultivated in Elavambadi in Anaicut, tomato in Mittalam, ladies finger in Madhanur, Natrampalli and Jolarpet while red chillies, cucumber and green chillies are grown in Nemili, Sholingur and Thimiri.

From aromatherapy to haircare, here are some of the most interesting beauty questions Blossom answered. Follow these simple beauty tips and make most of your time during the lockdown.If you want to start off with aromatherapy, the best essential oils to pick is lavender oil. This miracle oil works for everything. You can use it for sleeping, to relax, for hair and also for the skin. You can also use it on your burns. It not only heals the skin but also leaves no scars or marks.In order to use it to enhance your sleep experience, you need to rub a little bit of lavender oil on both your palms and rub them gently under your ears. For skin, you can either use it with water or by mixing it with another oil. Just massage it all over your face and wash it off. You can use lavender oil as a last rinse for your hair as well.Another oil which I recommend especially for these days is neroli oil.

It has a direct effect on your mind and helps you relax. It helps in the functioning of adrenaline gland as well.

You can also use eucalyptus oil to clean your mobile phones.All oils cant be used directly on the skin, except lavender and tea tree. All other oils need to be mixed with vegetable oil. You can take a teaspoon of almond oil or olive oil and put 1-2 drops of essential oil. You need to mix essential oils with vegetable oil, otherwise, you will burn yourself. Avoid using essential oils by mixing it in creams, as it wont penetrate your skin if the cream contains mineral oil.For your face, just one drop is enough. It takes a tonne of rose petals to make one kilo of rose oil. So, one drop of rose oil is equivalent to 25 grams of cream or plant material. It is very potent, which is the reason why only one drop is enough for your skin. For your whole body, you can use 6-8 drops, which would be sufficient.You can also use it during your bucket bath. Just pour 3-4 drops in your bucket of water. Just pour it all over you. It smells divine and is also good for your skin. You can also use it in shower baths. Just put a drop or two on the corner of your shower, which will make your bath even more relaxing. You can also put a few drops on a damp towel after you bathe and pat it all over you.To make perfume on your own, just take three oils. Take a ceramic bowl and put some almond oil in it. Put a drop ylang ylang oil with some orange oil and a drop of sandalwood oil. Mix it all together and you can use it.The best way to take care of your skin naturally is by using kitchen ingredients. Use a lot of fruits for it. You can use papaya, watermelon and even banana.- You can cut a banana, smash it up and mix a little bit of honey in it. Just apply it all over your face and it will help you in getting clear and glowing skin.- Another way to cleanse your face is by using yogurt. Just take some yogurt and add a bit of salt in it.

Just take some rice powder, lemon, coffee and a little bit of salt. Just mix a teaspoon of coffee, a pinch of salt, some rice powder, juice of half a lemon and apply it all over your face. Remove it after 15 minutes by gently scrubbing your face.- For people with open pores, oily skin and tiredness, just cut open a tomato and rub it all over your face. This will help in giving your skin a gentle and natural glow.When you are going for a bath, just scrub your feet with a pumice stone. Make sure you apply lotion, instead of a cream. Before going to bed, just wash your feet and apply some cream. This will really help you in keeping your feet clean. And, when you are cutting your nails, just cut them straight. If you cut on the edges, you might face the problem of ingrown nails.For people with dry skin, banana is a very good option.

Lockdown has also forced people to look more at their screens, be it a laptop, a TV or mobile phone. The constant screen time means tired eyes, which can turn red and itchy.  High-energy visible (HEV) light or blue light released from these devices not only disrupts our circadian rhythm but also generates free radicals which are responsible for pigmentation, fine lines and premature ageing, explains the dermatologist. It also leads to an increase in the production of cortisol, a hormone that almost acts like a built-in alarm system. As per WebMD, Cortisol is your bodys main stress hormone. It works with certain parts of your brain to control your mood, motivation and fear. This, in the long run, leads to dullness and wrinkles. Lastly, an unbalanced diet, as well as less water consumption, also increases the appearance of dark circles.  What happens to your skin if you sleep properly?  Not getting enough sleep also leads to a suppressed immune system and since the skin is the largest organ of a human body, it is equally affected by the imbalance.

(Photo: Getty)  A proper sleep cycle can really change your beauty game. And if you are having trouble getting some shut-eye, heres a guide with easy yoga poses. Dr Jindal points out, It is scientifically proven that incomplete or disturbed sleep induces high stress-like condition in the body which leads to increased cortisol levels.  Want your skin to glow? Do these three simple things every morning  Not getting enough sleep also leads to a suppressed immune system and since the skin is the bodys largest organ, it is equally affected by the imbalance. Stressing on the production of collagen, the dermatologist mentions how it is responsible for providing structural support to our bones, skin, eyes, teeth and blood vessels. High cortisol levels affect collagen production, decreasing its production in the body, resulting in premature ageing, comments Dr Jindal.  Try these easy yoga poses to build immunity  How to make sure you have your sleep cycle in place  Try building hobbies that do not include staring at your screen like gardening or rekindle your love with reading.

Monitor your screen time by setting limits. This also allows you to follow a routine social media detox, which also is good for your mental health. Try nurturing hobbies such as gardening or rekindle your love for reading. The dermatologist suggests, Give utmost importance to eating healthy and staying hydrated. Make sure you control your salt intake since it contains sodium, which causes the body to retain water and bloat, leading to more prominent under-eye bags.  Give your skin the big beauty boost with these tomato DIYs  Seasonal fruits and vegetables are a great source of antioxidants, which help in getting the glow back. The dermatologist suggests eating tomatoes, and adds, They are a rich source of lycopene and beta-carotene and help in improving blood circulation and regeneration of collagen. Watermelon is a fruit rich in water content and essentials minerals and ensures good hydration of the skin. Other beneficial veggies include cucumbers, broccoli and bitter gourd.",TOMATO

(Express photo by Santosh Singh) Rai earned a living in Kolkata for the past 15 years, transporting essential goods between local markets. (Express photo by Santosh Singh)  Jobs that pay in the village dont last long City life is stressful but reassuring  Pramod Rai, 40, Truck driver  Back home in: Danapur Diara, Patna, Bihar  Returned from: Kolkata, on March 27  On March 26, after the first phase of the lockdown was announced, Rai set off for his village on a truck along with 44 other men. The group completed the 700 km journey in 20 hours. Throughout the journey, the thought of reuniting with my family kept playing on my mind, he says.  Unlike earlier, he did not bring anything for the family this time, not even the famous Kolkata sindoor (vermillion) or sandesh. He also did not bring clothes for the children, says wife Seema, 37.  The job he left behind: Rai earned a living in Kolkata for 15 years, transporting grains and essential goods between local markets. For driving his truck for 18 hours every day, he earned around Rs 7,000 every month. I sent Rs 6,000 home, says Rai, who has studied till Class 6. His employer paid him Rs 5,000 for his work till March 22. But I had to pay Rs 2,000 to a local dhaba owner before leaving, and Rs 1,000 was spent on the truck fare back home, he says.  In the past month, Rai has been in constant touch with his truck owner in Kolkata, Ramashanker Yadav, to check if he still has his job.  Family: Wife, and four children (ages 2, 4, 5, 7). Rais two brothers, Vinod and Subodh, work in Kolkata and Haryana respectively and havent returned home since the lockdown began. Rais family and his brothers families  10 members in all  share the three-room brick house they built a few years ago with their pooled savings.  Read | Among those in truck: Some who failed to get on train, workers denied wages  Together, the three of us own one bigha of land, from which we get about 250 kg of wheat a year, says Rai.  Money in hand: Rs 2,000. When he arrived at the quarantine centre at the village high school, he gave me all his savings. With that money, I bought ration for three months, but I dont know how we will manage after that. It has been a month since he returned from the centre, but he still hasnt found a job. He spends all his time with the children or playing cards, says Seema.  Rai says there are very few opportunities in agriculture either in the village. This region (the Ganga riverine belt) remains flooded for four to six months every year and that is why we grow only one crop here  either wheat or maize, he says.  Expenses: Seema says the lockdown and her husbands situation have made her realise the value of education. I want all my children to study in private schools as government schools do not offer proper education, she says. The couples eldest son Rohit, 7, goes to a private school. I pay Rs 300 per month at the school. It is tough, but I want all my children to study well so that they dont have to face hardships, says Rai. We have spent Rs 800 on buying pulses, spices and noodle packets already. I have only about Rs 1,200 left now.  Read | Train lottery leaves migrants in lurch: When will my turn come?  Sitting on the cot with his father, Rohit talks about how he is learning alphabets now. Like other grown-ups in the village for whom Kolkata has always been a preferred destination for the men of the village, Rohit hopes to go to the city too. Our forefathers also worked in Kolkata. It is closer home than Delhi and Haryana. We feel at home there, says Rai.  Seema says she loved how Rai described the city, during his visits home once or twice a year. I was hoping to see the Dakshineswar temple, but he never took us, she complains. Maybe I can plan the trip once coronavirus is over, says Rai.  But Seema isnt convinced. He doesnt even remember our wedding anniversary. I will believe him only once he takes us there, she says.  Savings: None, no debt.  What next: Setting up a dairy is an option but we dont have cooperatives to buy milk at a good price, says Rai. There are jobs that pay Rs 300 a day, but they dont last more than 10-15 days Village life is peaceful but has a lot of uncertainty. In Kolkata, life was reassuring.

It took the group over a day to cover the 100-km distance to Dungarpur district on foot.  The job he left behind: For the past two years, Kharadi helped manufacture copper powder for making power cables at the factory. He was paid Rs 300 daily for a 12-hour shift. After the first phase of the lockdown was announced, work dried up and he did not receive any salary for April. My cousin worked at the factory and he encouraged me to join.

Gruelling work hours is the only thing I remember, he says. I had an ice-cream occasionally. Sometimes I bought clothes from the local market.  Family: Wife, three children (ages 6, 4, and 2), sister and father. The seven-member family shares a two-room kuchcha home. His father owns two bighas of land on which they grow maize. However, due to scarcity of water, Kharadi says, the crop hasnt been sown yet. Now that he is here, we dont want him to leave again. He can find some mazdoori (daily wage work) here, says father Chunilal, 45.  Money in hand: Rs 300. When he returned home, there was hardly any money. I walked for 7 km to go to the bank and withdraw Rs 2,000, says Jija, 22, Kharadis wife. It was part of the Rs 2,500 the family got from the state government when their daughter turned one. We wanted to spend the money on her, but now we are using it for our survival, she adds.  Kharadi says he has been struggling to find work since his return home. I cant afford to sit at home.

Of the Rs 2,000 that she withdrew from the bank, the family gave Rs 1,000 to repay a loan that they had taken from a neighbour. Another Rs 700, says Jija, was spent on buying grocery items We have Rs 300 left, she says.  None of the couples children attends school, but Kharadi says educating them is his only dream.

When the first phase of the lockdown was announced, he set off for his village with a group of men but was caught by police and kept at a shelter home in Nashik. On May 2, Maurya was among the 847 migrant workers who returned to Lucknow on a special train. I only had Rs 500 then, of which I spent Rs 370 on the train ticket, he says.  The job he left behind: At the factory, says Maurya, he earned Rs 11,500 every month. I would send my wife Rs 4,000 every month.

The family lives in a crumbling two-room kuchcha house and all members work on a two-bigha field owned by Mauryas grandfather. We are growing some vegetables on the field now, says Veenu.  Since Maurya is still in quarantine, he cant go. My wife and I are responsible for providing lunch at home, while my parents pay for the items needed to cook dinner, he says.

Expenses: Mauryas wife spends about Rs 2,000 to purchase grains, pulses, vegetables and oil for the family every month.

Now, we dont have money for food, so I dont buy them anymore. Earlier, I would also give Rs 200 to my father-in-law, who has been saving up to get the house repaired; not now, she adds.  Savings: None, no debt.  What next: After my 14-day quarantine ends, I will look for jobs. I have heard that the government is trying to arrange work for migrants, he says. I dont have many dreams. If I get the job, I will be able to stay with my wife and wont even have to pay rent I can also get my house repaired sooner, says Maurya.  While he doesnt want to return, he has brought a miniature Taj Mahal souvenir as a reminder of this time in the town. I had bought it during a trip to Mumbai. It reminds me of my room there But life in the village is much better, he smiles.  Manjhi is yet to receive payment for the lost work days in April.

How about batter made with glucose biscuits in a pressure cooker?  New Delhi-based food blogger and cookbook author Shivesh Bhatia explains his popular five-ingredient cake (no flour, no egg), You start by preheating the cooker (close the lid without the whistle) on medium heat for 10 minutes. This makes sure that once your batter (in a greased pan) goes in, its hot enough for the cooking process to start. Use a wire rack or plate to make sure that the bottom of the cooker doesnt touch your baking pan. I dont like adding water because then it gives more of a steamed texture.  Stating that anyone can make the cake, he adds, I wanted to simplify it so that even people using a cooker for the first time can make it. It takes about 50 minutes for the cake to cook on an induction stove, but the baking time varies; I always suggest keeping an eye on it.  As for the all-important question of taste, Shivesh says, Honestly, the texture is as good as any regular cake. If you did a blind taste test, I dont think anyone will be able to guess that this cake is made with only glucose biscuits. That is the best part, because you get a great dessert without compromising on the taste.  Extra hack  Waffles are one dessert that everyone loves but a waffle iron is a gadget that is not commonly available in Indian households. Instead of the iron, use a sandwich-maker or griller to make the waffles. It actually does such a great job and I think this is a great hack that everyone can try.  Mug pizza  Mug cakes may be well known, but are you familiar with mug pizza and mug mac n cheese? Bengaluru-based food blogger Richa Gupta of the My Food Story channel says, Mug recipes are popular because when youre watching something late in the night, you just want something to eat and these recipes are really fast and easy. You dont even need egg. All my mug recipes are eggless; they are made in a microwave and are quick and easy.  So how does one make these dishes? Says Richa, For the pizza, we use baking soda as a leavening agent and so you get that bready sort of texture in the base when it cooks in the microwave. Then you add sauce, cheese and toppings and the top part cooks and gives you that pizza-like taste. The mac n cheese takes about eight minutes to make in a microwave. The reason for that is the pasta has to cook; its not like the pasta can cook in two minutes just because its in a microwave. After that, it is another 30 or 40 seconds when you add the milk, cheese and cornflower powder. And the texture is very similar to a regular pasta: creamy and cheesy.  Extra hack  My favourite hack, if you have forgotten to soak channa or rajma overnight, is to take a casserole or anything with a tight lid, fill it with hot water, add the beans, a little bit of salt, cover it, and leave it aside for one hour. The hot water and salt will do the trick and the beans will be the same as if you had soaked it overnight.  Steamed egg curry  For Sarvesh Devanandan of the Instagram page A Bite Of Chennai, a story on cooking eggs in an idli steamer gave him the idea to take it one step further and make an egg curry.  I had watched an Instagram video of eggs being steamed and then toasted on a pan with some pepper, chilli powder and curry leaves. Thats what I wanted to make initially. Then, I had this idea of changing my mothers recipe. She used to make tomato curry, where she would add the raw egg to it when it was boiling. But the eggs would become messy and also overcooked. So, I thought of adding steamed eggs to the curry. It turned out really well. The eggs were fluffy, soft and stayed intact.  Extra hack  When we make egg dosa, we usually make the dosa first and then spread the egg on it. Instead, mix the egg in the batter and cook it. You dont get the dosa texture, but it does become very fluffy. And it goes really well with any gravy or chutney.",TOMATO

Uchit Vohra, Executive Chef at ITC Gardenia, Bengaluru, shares how a spot of ingenuity takes you a long way with borderline vegetables, optimising their consumption. The most effective way is pickling to increase shelf life. This comes in handy when you have a spotting cauliflower, wrinkled carrots or a shrivelled aubergine. Fermenting increases their nutrient index, making the content more healthy for the gut owing to its probiotic properties, he says.  Alternatively, frying and freezing vegetables is an effective way of reusing them later. For potatoes on the withering spree, specifically, just slice and dehydrate in the sun to make potato chips. To make leafy vegetables like coriander and spinach last longer, blanch and make into a paste and freeze. For leaves and herbs, microwave on minimum power to dehydrate, then powder them and use as sprinklers, Vohra suggests.  Bananas are one of the most versatile things to transform. Throw them into cakes if you are a baking whiz or simply toss them into milkshakes and smoothies. You can also blitz it into a mixer with a few other ingredients and freeze before enjoying your homemade ice cream a couple of hours later. I use overripe bananas to make overnight oats with almond milk, or add flour to make an oats banana pancake for breakfast, says Chef Sanjana Patel of La Folie.  Similarly, aubergines can be redeemed by making them into a bharta or a baba ganoush spread. Leftover beans can be boiled and frozen to include in your next curry dish, pulav or a Russian salad, says Chef Rohan Dsouza. Border edibles are great to turn into spreads and chutneys. Mushy tomatoes work very well as tomato sambal, according to Dsouza. Optionally, chop the good parts of the over-ripe vegetables and boil them with salt and reduce to a thick slush. Then strain and store as cubes in an ice tray for later.

New people are coming in with new ideas and veterans are reinventing their businesses. I have always responded to people who have reached out to me on Instagram and whenever possible I have tried their products. Many have been surprisingly good.  Indias restaurants are unloved because too many restaurateurs dont seem to love their customers  Cross-Border Kitchens started operations last year as a cloud kitchen service doing home delivery with many different brands. Ishita Yashvi who is one of the founders mailed me about their service a couple of months ago. Then the folks at Cross-Border Kitchens got busy trying to help daily wagers and migrant workers and we lost touch.  Ritu Dalmia home delivers half-cooked pizza base with the toppings  This Eid, Ishita mailed to ask if I would review their Eid feast. I said yes and wondered what the food would be like. It started badly. The order arrived an hour later than promised  a capital offence in this business  by which stage I had already eaten dinner. So I ate it over the next two days in bits and pieces. To my surprise, it was very good.  There was a terrific nihari (though it was slightly less intensely flavoured than others I have had) a great rogan josh, magnificent haleem, wonderful biryani and very good galauti kebabs. You would have to search far and wide among Delhis restaurants to get Awadhi food of this quality. Moreover, this was not overly greasy unlike the food from many of its restaurant rivals.  Cross-Border Kitchens operates three large kitchens in Delhi to service the city. Each kitchen handles innumerable brands owned by the company (one does momos, another does Punjabi food, another does burgers and so on) but the largest single share of the business goes to Biryani Central, the brand that did the meal they sent me.  Tres is home delivering items like this Josper Grilled Tenderloin Burger with efficiency  Because they knew the food was meant for me, I cannot necessarily guarantee that everything that comes out of the kitchen will be of the same quality. But clearly Ahsan Ali Qureshi, one of the partners, has food in his blood: he is the great Imtiaz Qureshis younger son.  I would use them again and am now looking forward to trying their momo brand: BroMomo. If these new cloud kitchens can turn out food of this quality then restaurants are in deep trouble.  Ahsan Ali Qureshi and Ishita Yashvi of Cross-Border Kitchens, a cloud kitchen service that does home delivery  Another measure of the ingenuity of the food business is the growth of the cook-it-yourself sector. Ritu Dalmia was stuck in Goa for most of the lockdown but managed, over the phone, to mastermind a nearly-ready meal service from her Delhi restaurant. The service offers food that is nearly ready along with the ingredients you need to finish it at home.  I tried the pizza first. She had sent a half-cooked base along with the toppings (cheese, tomato paste etc. but also fresh rocket leaves, shards of Parma ham, etc.) It was nearly as good as eating it at the Italian Cultural Centre Caf, which Ritu runs, and which has the best pizzas in India.  My neighbour and former colleague, Rivanjali Mithal, tried Ritus pasta and thought it was restaurant quality  and Rivanjali knows her food. We tried the sausage risotto at home the next day and it was nearly as good as the one I make at home. (Just kidding!)  Priya Paul who runs the Park chain is still at the top of her game  Ritu is one of Indias great chefs so her success in creating these meals is not so surprising. But I was impressed by a small operation called Madison & Pike, run by the husband and wife team of Nitin Chadha and Ranjana Deopa who got in touch with me on Instagram. They sent a Poke bowl, with sauces, and a very nice Peruvian-style chicken that you finished at home. Their three-cheese pasta had a delicious sauce, which made me admire the talent of the cooks because its not easy to turn out three dishes from three different cuisines with such a high degree of competence.  Do you know what a Poke bowl is? It took me a while to find out what the damn thing was when Poke became ubiquitous a few years ago. My guess is that this is true of many of us.  The New York cheesecake at The Park New Delhi is made to exacting standards of the hotels owner  My ex-producer at NDTV, Monica Narula (she produced my shows One on One for 24X7 and Custom Made and Foodistan for Good Times) teamed up with another of my ex-producers, Gunjan Mehrish (he produced Face the Music on 24X7) and yet another NDTV producer Noopur Tiwari, to act on her belief that there were lots of people who shared my ignorance about trendy dishes. Nor did we know the stories behind even familiar dishes like butter chicken.  The three of them started a company called Dash with seed capital from Ratan Tata. Because they understood food, they were able to go to restaurants and create tablet menus for them. If you touched a dish on an iPad screen, you would get a short video telling you what the dish was and what the story behind it was.  The lockdown has given their app (also called Dash) a new relevance. People order food from home, looking at menus on the Internet without really understanding what they are getting. Monicas app will tell you the story of each dish to help you decide what to order with a high-quality food video. They have now added a feature that lets you order from participating restaurants on the app itself.  Poke bowls from Madison & Pike are pretty to boot  It is a big success and Monica and her partners may end up being among the few people in the larger food business to do okay during the lockout.  Sahil Mehta contacted me on Instagram. The name seemed familiar and some digging around revealed that he had been involved with LOpera, The Artful Baker and other such well-known bakery operations. He was now operating out of a small studio kitchen at home, he said, and baking to order. I am not keen on gluten but his passion impressed me so I agreed to try his stuff.  It was a wise decision. The quality of the baking was excellent. I had one of the best croissants I have had in Delhi, nicely buttery and flakey and the quiche he sent along was outstanding. In a country where so many bakeries use bogus chocolate and synthetic cream, I am always delighted when I find somebody who cares enough to bake the right way.  I called Sahil afterwards and it turned out that his parents had moved to Paris when he was 13. He had studied catering there (the French course is four years, a year longer than most other countries and pays special attention to baking and to chocolate) but had been reluctant to become a chef because he wanted to be a Bollywood film star. He spent a year and a half in Mumbai and when it became clear to him that he was not going to be the next Shah Rukh Khan, he finally gave baking a shot and discovered that this was where his heart lay.  The problem with getting your hands on Sahils products is that he runs a small artisanal operation out of his home. He had intended to open an outlet but the Covid crisis intervened. Nor does he have a website. So, the best way to get through to him is to go to his Instagram page and send him a direct message.  I have written (in The Taste, my other column on hindustantimes.com) that whenever I tweet in support of the restaurant business, the responses are uniformly hostile. Basically, there is little public sympathy for the restaurant sector or for restaurateurs. Indias restaurants are unloved because too many restaurateurs dont seem to love their customers.  It is this lack of affection that will open the door to cloud kitchens, delivery services and a new generation of food entrepreneurs. This crisis will finish off some of the industrys big daddies with their dated ideas; it will leave many of the old dinosaurs struggling and their investors bleeding.  But there are those in the business who will survive any shake-up because of the relationships they have built with their customers.  Among them is the team behind Tres, a neighbourhood restaurant run without hype or fuss in Lodi Colony Market in Delhi. Owned by Amit Burman and Rohit Agarwals Litebite Foods (one of the straightest companies in a business thats not always straight), Tres is fronted by two exceptional chefs, Julia DeSa and Jatin Mallick. Every time I go there I see customers interacting with the chefs with warmth and an easy familiarity.  Julia and Jatin have now started a delivery version of Tres. The food is comforting but immensely complicated: 24 hours cooked Spanish Porchetta Pork Belly; Slow Braised Pulled Lamb Shoulder; Jalapeno and Dill Crusted Sea Bass and a burger that is first grilled in the Josper oven and then served in a brioche bun with melted Raclette cheese, onion marmalade and bacon.  You have to be a super-confident chef to pull off that kind of food for takeaway or delivery. Fortunately, Jatin and Julia are among the best European chefs in the city so they make it seem easy.  If the lockdown ever really gets you down, light a candle on the dining table, open a bottle of good wine and order in from Tres. It is one-fourth the price of a five-star hotel meal  and probably more enjoyable.  And for dessert, order the cheesecake from the Park Hotel. I did and regretted missing it in my cheesecake article. Its a classic New York-style cheesecake made to the exacting standards of super foodie Priya Paul who runs the Park chain. Priya has been a pioneer in the food and beverage world and its good to see that she is still at the top of her game.  Its the people like Priya who understand true hospitality who will come out of this crisis bloody but unbowed. This is a business that depends on quality and relationships. If you care about both, you will be fine. If not, well....  From HT Brunch, June 7, 2020  Follow us on twitter.com/HTBrunch  Connect with us on facebook.com/hindustantimesbrunch",TOMATO

While lockdown restrictions have eased considerably, its unlikely that live theatre will bounce back in the near future, forcing artistes to embrace new ways to make a living.  A group of theatre artistes in the city have started a mobile eatery near Nandini Layout bus stop. Working out of a van, they sell homemade tomato bath, idli-vade, chapati, rice and sambar, and chitranna between 7 a.m. and noon.  Channakeshava G., a designer and actor, said the group believed that both preparation and consumption of food is an art form and decided to run a mobile canteen. The idea was born out of need and passion. Food is prepared by us at home without any baking soda or artificial colouring. We take all precautions while preparing and packaging food. We have seen artists start cafes and book stores. A roadside mobile eatery is rare, he said.  He and his friends admit that with their livelihood at stake, they had no option but to become entrepreneurs. Five of us, from different theatre groups came together to start this mobile canteen. It helps that cooking is our passion, he added.  Lakshman K.P., who trained at the Inter-cultural Theatre Institute in Singapore, said, COVID-19-related restrictions will remain for a long time. Our hope is to create a small but beautiful art space in and around our food van. We plan to hold poetry and photography sessions at our food stall.  Sidhaartha Maadhyamika, a theatre artist who has been part of a few indie films, is using this time to learn new skills. We were in our own zone, comfortably numb for years. But the pandemic is teaching us to adapt and keep moving, which in a way is also what theatre is about, he said.",TOMATO

(Source: Lavleen Kaur/Facebook)  The current health crisis has made everyone work towards building their immunity in more ways than one. From eating seasonal to counting on traditional recipes and exercising regularly, people have started to incorporate simple, easy things that are good for their health. But if you are someone who swears by immunity-boosting foods and recipes that are also delicious, here is a simple chutney that you should try.  Nutritionist Lavleen Kaur shared a recipe that had our attention.  She captioned the post, What if every meal you have can help in boosting immunity by just adding a spoon of magic on the side? That magic is nothing but a special immunity booster chutney that everyone in the family can relish along with the traditional meal consisting dal, rice, roti and sabji.

How to consume?  Enjoy a small serving (1-2 tbsp) with your meals.  Benefits of the ingredients used  *Raw mango, tomato and pomegranate seeds are rich in vitamin C.  *Ginger, garlic, onion and tomato are rich in antioxidants and essential vitamins and minerals.  *Fresh leaves aid in better digestion.  *Sweet basil leaves also help relieve nausea.  Who can consume it?  *Good for diabetics to maintain blood sugar levels.  *Great for acidity relief (remove chillies from recipe).  *Relieves constipation due to high fibre content.  *Good for anaemics as vitamin C helps in absorption of iron.  *Also good for PCOD, thyroid and any other hormonal imbalance.  However, be careful  *If you have IBS or Irritable Bowel Syndrome.  *If you are pregnant (mind the portion).  But why use mortar and pestle and not a blender?  As per Kaur, pounding offers a full sensory experience, such that aromas are released and flavours are compounded to the sound of stone on stone. The connection you feel with the food you are making when engaging arms and hands (and nose), is actually pretty amazing, she said, while adding how no heat is produced which makes the food taste original, more tastier and flavourful.

And those are ghee and roast, put together. My favourite dish at Saravana Bhavan  those carefree days when one could sit there and have a happy meal  was a ghee roast dosa. It was crispy, and had a delicious fragrance of ghee. And it was the thought of this aroma that drew my eyes to a dish that had the words ghee roast chicken on the menu of Fresh to Home (Freshtohome.com), a food delivery platform.  We started ordering uncooked fish and shrimps from Fresh to Home a couple of years ago. Then, some weeks ago, I saw that they had added marinated, ready-to-cook items on their menu. And there was a dish there called Tangy Chicken Ghee Roast! I ordered it, and despite being not a great fan of chicken, I loved it.  It came wrapped in the flavours of ghee and all that we had to do was to put it in a kadhai, add a tiny bit of oil and let it simmer for 10 minutes or so in 100 ml of water. We stirred it now and then, sprinkling some water when needed. And out came a delicious dish -- tangy and fiery red (thanks to the Byadgi chillies that it had been marinated with). The dish, says the app, is popular in the Mangalore-Kundapur region of Karnataka. And its certainly popular in our house.  We tried out some of the other marinated dishes, and came to the conclusion that a prawn dish that we ordered -- Gambas Con Tomates Secos Y Aceituna  deserved the crown, though the runners-up were not bad either. This was a dish of fresh shrimps in a garlicky marinade, cooked in olive oil, with sundried tomatoes, garlic, parsley, chilli flakes, sliced pitted olives and salt. Following the instructions given on the site, we let this cook in 50 ml of water, until the shrimp was done. The dish was delightful, the sweetness of the shrimp complementing the tanginess of the sundried tomatoes.  Another dish that worked well was Mutton Mince Dry Fry. It had a tomato base and a mildly sweet taste (perhaps from the peas) that I quite enjoyed. I had the keema with home-cooked rotis, freshly sliced onions and tomatoes on the side.  We also asked for Amritsari ajwaini machi pakora  a 300-g pack of sliced boneless basa, in a batter of mildly spiced besan flour and ajwain (carom seeds). This was meant to have been deep fried, but we shallow fried it. I am not a great fan of basa, though Fresh to Home usually stocks the Indian river basa (and not the Mekong one). This one didnt appeal to me much. The besan coating was a bit too thick, and I think it also lost some of its taste because we didnt fry it the way it should be done.  The rates are reasonable, but a bit erratic. I paid 279 for the 500-g pack of the Tangy Chicken Ghee Roast, though the site says it costs 245. Likewise, the 400-g mutton keema pack is priced at 700, but my bill shows that I paid 444.  Also on the menu are Coconut Chicken Curry, Butter Chicken, Chicken Cafreal, Lahsuni Malai Prawns, Honey Mustard Chicken Wings, Tandoori Chicken Legs, and something called Grannys Masala Fried Chicken.  I am going to try out Grannys Masala Fried Chicken. The word granny somehow adds to the taste of food. Quite like ghee roast!  The writer is a seasoned food critic",TOMATO

From 12 a kg for the first grade on June 1, the price has shot up to 36 on Monday, as per the official records. The second variety too saw a sharp rise from 8 a kg to 27.  This sudden phenomenon is considered the first-of-its-kind in the region in a decade. The wholesale demand is expected to touch 50-70 in a couple of weeks due to declining stock arrivals. Trade analysts predict a possible repeat of 2015 scenario when the retail price of tomatoes touched 150-200 a kg. Due to dwindling stocks, on Monday, about 1,000 metric tonnes were traded as against 1,700 tonnes on June 1.  Prices remain steady  Marketing and horticulture officials maintain that despite COVID-19 lockdown, prices remained rather steady at the Madanapalle market and in the last three months never slipped below 5 a kg, considered the threshold limit to avoid losses.

Eeshwar Reddy, a young farmer from Mulakalacheruvu mandal in the region, attributed the sudden spike in the tomato price to dismal yields in the neighbouring Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Maharashtra. Due to the COVID-19 threat, many farmers in the southern States either stayed away from active cultivation or couldnt transport their produce to markets causing shortage in the domestic markets there and spurred exports from Madanapalle region since first week of June.

Like any Bengali-at-heart, food consultant Iti Misra cannot stop gushing at the mention of beguni.  Beguni Ingredients  1 large eggplant (preferably the purple variety)  4 tbsps besan (Bengal gram flour)  1 tbsp oil  1/2 teaspoon poppy seeds  Salt and chilli powder to taste  Oil for deep frying  Method  Slice the eggplant length wise into  thick slices and sprinkle a bit of salt. On the eggplant slices and set aside. In the meantime mix the gram flour, oil, salt, chilli powder and poppy seeds in a bowl. Add enough very cold water to make a batter of the consistency of thick cream. Heat about 3 of oil in a karhai. Pat the eggplant slices dry on a kitchen roll. Dip each slice in the batter and deep fry a few pieces at a time. The eggplant should be a golden brown in colour. This will take two to 2.5 minutes. Drain excess oil on paper towels. Sprinkle with black salt or chaat masala.  Recipe by food consultant Iti Misra  The batter-fried eggplant fritter is a regional favourite, and  as Iti points out  as popular in home kitchens as it is in streetside shacks. The eggplant preferred is the large, purple variety, but beyond that the requirements for this treat are few. It is one of the beloved trio that Bengalis call tele bhaja (literally meaning fried in oil), along with alu chop (potato cutlet) and piyaji (onion pakora). Just dont confuse it with begun bhaja, she warns.  The West coast has its own share of monsoon nibbles. Mumbai-based Chef Aditi Kamat waxes eloquent about kothimbir vadi (recipe at end of copy), that elaborately prepared Puneri treat of gram flower, coriander leaves and spices that some simply steam and others take a step further, into the frying pan.  She readily confirms that it is synonymous with the rains, and adds, In Maharashtrian households, like in Gujarati ones, there is always an element of farsan when preparing a traditional platter. We usually have kothimbir vadi, or turaichi vadi, or aru vadi. The easiest that can be made at home is the kothimbir vadi. Especially for upvas food, this is preferred as it can be pre-made and kept.  Radhica Muthappa, who runs Bengaluru-based Curly Sue Pork with her husband, Uttam, grew up in Munnar on a plantation and the rains meant one thing: it was time to whip out the sandwich maker. It was usually a scrambled egg and cheese sandwich. When pulled pork was made at home, we would add that into the sandwich. That was the treat, she laughs.  A dish she started making after marriage and moving to Bengaluru was basale soppu fritter. That is a traditional Kannadiga dish that fries out really crisp. Its fairly tricky to make because the soppu is leathery and it has a lot of moisture. So, you have to wash it and pat it really dry, dip it in the batter and fry it. You need to be a little careful when preparing it. Its not rocket science but it does have a procedure.  Basale soppu bhajji Ingredients  50 grams gram flour or besan  1/2 teaspoon ajwain seeds  1/2 teaspoon red chilli powder  A pinch of turmeric  1/2 teaspoon salt  Method  Wash and thoroughly dry basale leaves. This step is very important, as the leaves are thick and full of moisture and unless completely dried will result in oil splattering while deep-frying. Make a batter of the above ingredients with a little water, such that when you dip a leaf in it, it should coat it. Enjoy with some coconut chutney or tomato ketchup.  Recipe by Radhica Muthappa of Curly Sue Pork  For Chef Regi Mathew, culinary director and co-owner of Kappa Chakka Kandhari, the monsoon is synonymous with bananas. During the monsoon, a lot of bananas would ripen together and many would be getting wasted. So, our mothers would sun-dry these bananas and store it. And during the monsoon, there is nothing to do at home so in the evenings, we would take these bananas, cut them into small pieces, add some coconut and paani (fresh toddy boiled for several hours till it achieves a honey-like consistency). When we didnt have paani, we would add honey. Our mothers would bring it in a big vessel and serve it in small katoris to everybody.  Stating that the pazham nanachathu gives one that warm, cosy feeling, he adds, Every time it rains, I always think to myself that this is what is missing in the evenings.  Another dish he associates with tea time during the monsoon is unnakkai. Unnakkai is steamed banana that is stuffed with a coconut and jaggery mix, made into small pods and then deep-fried, he says.  Here are a few recipes to try out:  Kothimbir Vadi  Ingredients   cup peanuts, 1 teaspoon ginger, 1 teaspoon garlic, 2 green chillies or 2 teaspoons green chillies, 1 to 2 tbsps water for grinding, 2 cups finely chopped coriander leaves,  teaspoon turmeric powder,  teaspoon red chilli powder or cayenne pepper,  teaspoon coriander powder (ground coriander),  teaspoon cumin powder (ground cumin), 1 pinch asafoetida (hing)  optional, 1 tbsp white sesame seeds, 1 cup besan (gram flour or chickpea flour),  teaspoon sugar  optional, salt as required,  cup water for batter, 1 to 1.5 cups water for steaming, 3 tbsps oil for frying  Method  Heat a tawa or pan and keep the flame to a low or medium. Add  cup peanuts. Stir at intervals and roast till the peanuts become crunchy. The peanuts skin will also have some brown-black spots on them. Transfer them to a plate and let them cool. Rub the peanuts in your palms. This will remove the flaky skin. Now, put the peanuts in a small grinder jar. Grind to a coarse powder. Remove and keep aside. In the same small grinder, add 1 teaspoon ginger, 1 teaspoon garlic and 2 green chillies (or 2 teaspoons green chillies). Add 1 to 2 tbsps water and grind to a smooth paste. Keep aside. Alternatively, you can even crush the garlic, ginger and green chillies in a mortar-pestle. Rinse coriander leaves very well. Drain the extra water and finely chop them. For the batter, take the coriander leaves in a mixing bowl, add the ginger+garlic+green chilli paste. Now add  teaspoon turmeric powder,  teaspoon red chilli powder,  teaspoon coriander powder,  teaspoon cumin powder and 1 pinch of hing (optional). Next, add the coarsely ground peanut powder and 1 tablespoon white sesame seeds. Add 1 cup besan (gram flour). Now add  teaspoon sugar (optional) and salt as required. Mix everything well. Now add  cup water in parts and mix well to make a thick batter. To steam, grease a pan with some oil. Add the batter. Bring to boil 1 to 1.5 cups water in another pan. Lower the flame and holding the pan (in which the batter is there) with tongs, keep it inside the pan with water. Cover with a lid and steam on a low to medium flame. Once done, check with a toothpick: it should come out clean. When the kothimbir mixture is cooled, gently place the entire layer on a plate. With a butter knife, loosen the edges and invert the pan on the plate. Tap the pan and unmold the layer. Now cut in square or diamond-shaped slices.  To pan fry, heat three tablespoons oil in a tawa or pan. Place the steamed kothimbir vadi and pan fry on medium flame. When the base is golden, flip and fry the other side. Flip a couple of times more and fry till the sides are crisp and golden. Place the pan fried kothimbir vadi on kitchen paper towels for extra oil to be absorbed. Serve hot or warm with chutney or sauce of your choice.  Recipe by Chef Aditi Kamat  Unnakkai  Ingredients  2 Nendram bananas (medium ripe), 1 cup grated coconut, 1 tbsp ghee, 1/2 tsp cardamom powder, 12 split cashews, 12 raisins, 1 1/2 tbsp sugar, oil to fry  Method  Steam the banana, remove the skin, mash well and keep aside. Heat ghee in a frying pan and saut the cashewnuts and raisins along with the grated coconut. Add sugar and cardamom powder to the pan and mix well and remove from fire. Apply a touch of ghee on both palms. Divide the mashed bananas into about seven to eight even-sized balls. Press the centre of each ball a little with the help of your thumb and stuff the mixture carefully inside. Make it into a spindle shape. Heat the oil in a kadai and deep-fry the unnakkai to a golden yellow colour. Serve hot.  Recipe by Chef Regi Mathew, culinary director and co-owner of Kappa Chakka Kandhari",TOMATO

After getting to know of the challenges being faced by the farmers, who had cultivated tomatoes on a large scale and were unable to sell them due to the lockdown, the ATAFF members decided to come to the help of the farmers by buying out their stocks. The members then donated the entire stock among poor villagers who could not afford to buy nutritious vegetables due to the loss of livelihood during the pandemic, thus ensuring a win-win situation.  Vasudeva Reddy, N. Subbareddy Chinthagunta, Venkat Kalluri and Prabhakar Reddy Chinepalli financially supported the Tomato Challenge.  In a press release here on Thursday, the association said that they bought all the tomatoes from producers and those who benefited most were farmers in Kodumuru of Kurnool district, Rayachoti of Kadapa district, Railway Koduru, and Kadapa city where tomatoes and mangoes were distributed. In Atmakur of Nellore district, onions and carrots were distributed. The largest quantum of tomatoes, however, was purchased from Chittoor district, they said.  In all, 200 farmers from Tambalapalli, Kothakota and Vinjamuru mandals of Chittoor district benefited from the charity programme.

Defending the decision, Revenue Minister R Ashoka said the government is committed to protecting farmers interests and ensuring development of industries at the same time. There is no need for any apprehension and the government will reach out to the opposition to take them into confidence, he told The New Sunday Express.  Why has the government decided to make changes in the Land Reforms Act?  We decided to amend the Act to ensure growth of agricultureal and industrial sectors of the state. The earlier provision that prohibited non-agriculturalists from buying agriculture land was not helping people in anyway and was only used by Revenue Department officials to harass people. In the last 45 years, many cases were registered for violation, but no action was taken. It had become irrelevant.  Agriculture and employment generation are among the governments top priorities. How will the proposed changes help?  Once the Act is changed, agro-processing industries, warehouses and cold storage facilities in rural areas can come up. We need to have mango juice factories, tomato processing plants, sugar factories, coconut processing units and many other agro-processing units in rural areas. That will help reduce transportation cost, which is a big burden on farmers. That is the model followed in many countries, including Taiwan. The changes will also help reduce wastage of agriculture produce.  In many developed countries, the wastage is around 3-4 percent, but here it is around 30 percent as we do not have cold storage facilities and warehouses in rural areas. Once we have these facilities, our farmers will get a good price for their produce and their incomes will increase. It will also help generate employment opportunities in rural areas and those graduating from agriculture universities too can take up farming.  What mechanisms will be put in place to ensure that the proposed changes are not misused?  We have put an upper ceiling of 108 acres per family. Let me assure people that we will have enough mechanisms in place to ensure that it will not be misused.  Why is government contemplating an ordinance route instead of getting it passed in the Assembly?  We may not have an Assembly session soon due to the Covid pandemic and even if we implement it through an ordinance, we will discuss it in the assembly when the session is convened. We are still discussing all these aspects.    Opposition parties accuse the government of amending the Act to help corporates and are planning a statewide agitation. Will you reach out to them?  The Congress is opposing only because the Act was implemented when the party was in power. However, we have to make changes depending on the current requirements. What was relevant at that time is irrelevant now. With the changes, we can put an end to peoples harassment. We will reach out to the opposition and try to explain the advantages of these amendments. But we cannot help if they are opposing only for political reasons.  The Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) Act too was amended recently and a well-established system has been opened up for the private sector. How will it impact farmers?  It will help farmers as they can now sell their produce either at APMC yards or outside. It will also create competition and protect farmers from middlemen. Our focus is to help farmers and overall development of the state.",TOMATO

Now that the government has decided to provide midday meals to children only in 49 drought-hit taluks of the total 237 taluks in Karnataka, many children will not get proper nutrition.  Since the lockdown was clamped, children who were being provided a nutritional diet, including milk, vegetables and cereals in schools, are deprived of it, as schools are shut. It has been three months now since the children have not been getting their midday meal, and children from slums and backward regions of Karnataka are the worst-affected.  Saraswathi, director of Rural Literacy and Health Programme, a not-for-profit organisation working for the welfare of children, said schoolchildren are the worst sufferers, especially those from poor families who live in slums.  They used to get a nutritious diet in schools, but are not getting it presently. Most parents of schoolkids in Ambedkar Nagar eke out a living by doing menial jobs like that of a domestic help or selling broomsticks. Theyre unable to provide a nutritious diet for their offspring, as they are struggling to make ends need. Our study reveals that their children are eating rice and tomato curry daily, she claims.  The government has to look into such issues and ensure that the children get proper nutrition, which will boost their immunity and help the children fight the threat of the novel coronavirus, states the study.  Gangappa, president of the Ambedkar Slumdwellers Association, said that about 80 children studying at a local government primary school are deprived of proper nutrition since the lockdown, as they are not getting their midday meals. The parents of these children are mostly from the North Karnataka region, and do unskilled jobs to sustain themselves. Gangappa, who is from Haveri, said that the government is doing nothing to ensure that poor children get proper nutrition.  Midday meal executive officer C Lingarajaiah said that schoolchildren got midday meals only till March. Now the government has ordered to provide midday meal rations to families of children only in drought-hit taluks of Karnataka. We have one taluk in Chamarajanagar and two in Ramanagar that are drought-hit, and none in Mysuru. There is a Supreme Court directive to provide meals to children only during school days. Were waiting for the government order to provide food or ration to children, he said.  According to the official, about 207,744 children benefited from the Midday Meal scheme and Kshera Bhagya scheme, in Mysuru alone. Deputy director of public Instruction Panduranga says that earlier, even during holidays, midday meals were provided in some schools, but now, without the governments directive, it cant be provided to them.",TOMATO

The traders at the vegetable market here in Alandur, which primarily caters to the residents of Madipakkam, Nanganallur, Adambakkam and Keezhakatalai, say that transportation cost and less arrivals at Thirumazhaisai wholesale market has led to the increase in prices of vegetables.

One kg of garlic cost Rs 300 at the wholesale rate in Thirumazhaisai while beans were priced at Rs 130.  The wholesale market prices are considerably high and increase when it is moved to retail markets, say the traders.  Potato that was earlier selling at Rs 35 was being sold at Rs 50-55. The arrival of vehicles from other districts have considerably reduced at the Thirumazhaisai market resulting in the price rise.

Traders at Azadpur said the supply fell to less than half of what it should have been during this time of the year as pre-monsoon rains in parts of the country destroyed the crop. This led to a shortage of the vegetable in Delhi and surrounding areas.  Strict quarantine rules in Maharashtra, where tomatoes witnessed a decent crop, prevented north Indian traders from visiting the farms and making direct purchase from farmers, thereby leading to a shortage of the most important ingredient in Indian curries.  According to traders, tomatoes sold up to Rs 1,000 per crate of 25 kilos in Azadpur on Monday and its effect was witnessed in retail prices in various residential pockets of the city. We used to get a supply of 45 truckloads of tomato in June, which has come down to about 20-22. There is almost no supply from Bengaluru and Maharashtra, said Anil Malhotra, a tomato trader and a member of Azadpur Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee.  Interestingly, tomato was selling at just about Rs 6 per kg at Azadpur in May, as there were fewer buyers due to the coronavirus-induced lockdown. Farmers, in fact, were forced to throw away their crop as most restaurants, where a huge percentage of tomato is consumed, were closed. Since the farmers were not able to recover their investment in the crop, they preferred to dump their produce instead of spending huge amounts in transportation.  Rajveer Kasana, a prominent vegetable dealer in Greater Noida, said the situation would start increasing from July and may stabilise by August. In a months time we hope of getting tomatoes from the upper echelons of Himachal Pradesh. It will help bridge the gap between the demand and supply, Kasana claimed.

Now, in a hot pan add ghee with onion, garlic, ginger, green chili, coriander seeds and saut until light brown. Add the leftover dal and hing and continuous stir with a wooden spoon until get dry. Make sure the heat is in medium or slow pressure and the cooking has to happen in slow method. When all the moisture evaporated then tries to make the dal mix as dry as much possible. Check the seasoning and remove from the heat and keep it aside to cool it down.  The next step is to make the litti dough. Take two cups of whole wheat flour,  tsp salt, 2 tbsp ghee , 1/8 tsp cooking soda. Add whole wheat flour, salt, ghee and cooking soda in a bowl and mix well. Add water and knead to make medium soft dough. Cover the dough and keep aside for 30 minutes.  Ingredients for honey chilli ghee will need  cup desi ghee (Warm), 1 tbsp honey,  tsp light soy sauce,  tsp synthetic vinegar, 1 tsp chopped green chili and salt to taste. In a pan, warm the ghee then keep it in a bowl and pour all the ingredients then cover it for an hour and keep it aside. Now for roasted tomato salsa, you need 8 tomatoes, 14 cloves finely chopped garlic, 5 pinches salt, 7 to 8 red chilli, 4 tablespoon sunflower oil and a few mustard seeds. Now, Heat 2 tbsp oil in a pan over medium flame, add the garlic and red chilies. Saut for 3 to 4 minutes then remove and cool. To the same pan, add the tomatoes and saut for 2 minutes. Switch off the flame. Combine the tomatoes, garlic, red chilies and salt. Grind to a fine paste, adding some water if required, and transfer to a small bowl. Heat 1 tsp oil and fry the mustard seeds for 30 seconds. Pour this over the salsa.  The final step is to assemble the litti and for that take out a large lemon sized dough and make it into a ball. Roll the dough ball to make a 4-5 inch circle. Keep 2 tbsp of filling in the centre of the dough and bring the ends together. Nicely seal the ends. Make all the lit in the same manner. Keep the litti covered with a cloth. Best to cook a litti in a charcoal fire like Bihar tradition style or pre heat an oven to 180 degrees C or take a roti tawa on a gas flame with slow heat. Bake for 20-25 minutes until browned from the top in a oven or put the litti on roti tawa then cover it fully with a steel bowl or something similar and after each few minutes sprinkle some warm water inside the bowl and then again cover it well. Flip the litti upside down and bake for another 10-12 minutes in oven or 7-8 minutes in tawa. They should be evenly browned from all the sides. Hold the litti with a tong and roast them over direct flame so that brown spots appear all over them. Dip the litti in ghee and serve with salsa.  And if you have a thing for Maharashtrian food, then Thaalipeeth is what you need to make from the leftover dal. Leftover dal, jowar flour 1 cup, besan 1/2 cup, rice flour 1/4 cup, fresh chopped coriander handful, chopped onion 1/2 cup, coriander powder 1tbsp, cumin powder 1 tbsp, red chilli powder 2 tbsp. Now all you need to do is to mix the ingredients well and knead a soft dough, flatten a dough ball with fingers on a greased pan, on a medium flame cook the thaalipeeth and try it with fresh curd and pickle.

Sources among the traders in these two markets said there were, however, challenges in shifting to a new location as the public in those localities were alerting the police. The public fear that wholesale vegetable shops in their area could lead to crowding and spread of the disease.  Almost all the traders at Anna market sell to retailers. With the market and the temporary space provided to them closed, some are selling vegetables out of trucks. Some are taking on rent private space if the rents are affordable. Some are looking at agriculture lands near the city and trying to sell from there. These are all efforts to sell vegetables that we get from different areas, said S. Suresh, secretary of the Anna market traders association. A few traders feel that if they can just sell for two hours a day, they will be able to manage the regular supplies that they get. So they try to make alternative arrangements, he said.  Some of the traders at MGR market said that though many of them were trying to see how they could continue vegetable supply to the city, they were used to doing business from a particular locality and there would be challenges when they shifted to alternative locations. Some wholesalers were just redirecting the vehicles to the buyers. Closing of the two markets could lead to rush at the Thyagi Kumaran Market and put at risk the traders and customers there too. Further, there could be hike in prices of some of the vegetables. The government should look at providing 20 acre to 50 acre in the future to set up a proper wholesale vegetable market, said one of them.  The wholesale vegetable prices in the district has remained almost the same. Only the prices of tomatoes and brinjal were slightly up. Tomato prices were up because of rain. Brinjal was at 20 a kg which was higher than what it was last month. We do not expect prices to shoot up much, said M. Rajendran, president of Thyagi Kumaran Market vegetable traders association.",TOMATO

Tomatoes which were being sold at Rs 8 per kg just a few days back in the wholesale market are now Rs 45 per kg.  In the retail market, prices of tomatoes range from Rs 50-70 per kg depending on the area. Officials say that the prices will shoot up further in the coming days and will continue to pinch pockets till the end of July.  Speaking to Express, selection grade secretary of the Agricultural Marketing Committee, Bowenpally, Srinivas Lokini says that tomato prices have risen sharply due to an uptick in demand as against a dip in supply. He explains that the local supply of tomatoes goes down during these months, as Telanganas tomato season is essentially between October-March.  ""After the supply in the State drops, the arrival of tomatoes is mostly from neighbouring states like Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh which sustains the State till the end of September. Every year, there is a slight increase in the tomato prices during this season but this year it is drastic, due to the pandemic,"" he adds.  Tomato wholesalers from Madannapet and Bowenpally vegetable mandis told Express that while prices have been rising in the last few weeks, the increase was gradual. But in the last one week, there has been a sudden spike. Last year in the same month, a cart of 25 kg of tomatoes was being sold at Rs 800.

Traders and wholesale market committees attributed the increase to the annual disruption in supply during the monsoon, but also to the increased margins by middlemen who have suffered losses in the lockdown months, and the increase in diesel prices that has a direct correlation with transportation cost.  On Thursday, most retail markers in Delhi sold tomatoes for 70-80 per kg, capsicum at around 100-120 per kg, okra for 90-100 per kg, ridge gourd for 100-110 per kg and cauliflower for around 60 per kg. The rates were up between 50% and 100% in the last one week, the traders said.  There has been no stability. Vegetables usually get costlier in this season because of the rain. The loss is relatively higher for green vegetables, which are more perishable in nature. But this year many factors played to increase the prices too much in too short a time. This is unusual, said Nilesh Kumar, a trader based at the retail vegetable market in south Delhis Mehrauli.  Records of Azadpur agriculture wholesale market, which accounts for more than 80% of the total supply of vegetables across Delhi, showed significant increase in prices. On June 25, the wholesale prices for tomato was14.75 per kg (on Thursday, this was 32), capsicum 10.25 per kg (32.5), okra 10.50 per kg (16.50), ridge gourd 9.50 per kg (12) and cauliflower 10.75 per kg (14).  While eastern and northeastern India continue to receive heavy rain, the monsoon is likely to intensify in the coming days in central and western India, the India meteorological department had reported .  Prices go up in the monsoon because the losses go up and add to the cost of vegetables. But this year, the increase in diesel prices have contributed to a two-fold blow, said Adil Khan, chairperson of the agriculture produce market committee in Azadpur.  The Azadpur market gets its largest share of green vegetables from states such as Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Punjab, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh. But, tomatoes mainly come from Maharashtra, Karnataka and Himachal Pradesh.  The increase in retail prices in Delhi is disproportionate even if compared to the wholesale price increase, Haji Yamin, a wholesale vegetable trader based in the Okhla market, pointed out.  Yamin, said: The increase in diesel price has a direct effect on transportation cost. That is likely to affect prices. But, other than that, traders and middlemen have also contributed to the disproportionate jacking up of prices in different levels to make up for the losses incurred during the lockdown months through increased margins, taking advantage of the monsoon price hike and diesel rates.  Fuel prices have been soaring in the country since daily price revisions were resumed from June 7. The price of diesel rose by 11.14 per litre in about three weeks; on Thursday price of diesel per litre in Delhi was 80.53, Gurugram 72.81, Mumbai 78.95, Chennai 77.78 and Bengaluru 76.59.  Naveen Gupta, secretary-general of the All India Motor Transport Congress, said that the change in diesel rates usually takes some time to affect transport costs.  Recently, the diesel rates have increased too rapidly in too short a time, and it is difficult to ascertain how that has contributed to increased costs of products in the agriculture sector. However, diesel comprises of around 65% of transport cost and an increase in diesel rate will definitely have a direct effect. But every market sector needs its own time to ascertain the effect of such complicated inter-related factors.",TOMATO

Thats the story weve been reading and writing for decades, since way before I became part of the culinary journalism world.  But throughout America, there is a rich tradition of celebration through shared meals that goes well beyond this story. On summer holidays, people draw upon a rainbow of dining and drinking cultures to gather and eat, and these less-shared stories highlight heritages so varied theyd make a dazzling picnic quilt.  Theres no better place to find vibrant July 4th celebrations than Los Angeles. Its one of the most diverse cities in the country, set in the most diverse state. Locals are cookout experts. They also treat the 4th of July as one of the years big holidays, not necessarily to celebrate independence but because it is a day to hang out at the beach, cook out at home, and watch major firework displays. Few restaurants are open that day, so for the millions of kids whose parents work in dining rooms and kitchens, its one of the years few, true family days. Because of the Covid-19 coronavirus, most of this years fireworks are virtual, and home parties are socially distanced. They are still being planned.  Basically, for us, the 4th of July is a time to celebrate what it means to be a non-Anglo-American, says Kim Luu-Ng, co-owner of the southeast Asian spot, Cassia, a restaurant that is especially active in supporting social justice causes. I dont have to just eat burgers and hot dogs on 4th of July. I can eat Vietnamese barbecue, too. Eating just one kind of food is deprivation, in my opinion.  Cheyenne Nicholson, founder of Fun-Diggity Funnel cakes, a popular dessert place near South Central L.A., is looking forward to this years holiday specifically as a way to break from old traditions. Being African American, a lot of us are finding our history, she explains. We celebrate a lot of holidays with open arms, and we want people to celebrate what our ancestors went through and start to have conversations and change traditions: the way you eat, the things you talk about.  Everything is changing and evolving, she adds, referring to the Black Lives Movement and other awareness campaigns. The 4th of July is a good place to start.  Here, seven Angelenos talk about what they eat to celebrate Independence Day.  Aishwarya Iyer, founder of Brightland Olive Oil  Menu: Pav Bhaji (vegetarian vegetable stew) and kulfi (Indian ice cream)  I was born in Chennai in south India, but I spent part of my childhood in Chicago, and thats where my earliest memory of the 4th of July is from, when I was around 6. We went to a couple cookouts, but my family was vegetarian; none of us could eat the burgers. I was bummed by the whole thing. At home, my Mom made pav bhajii to make up for it. Pav bhaji is a popular Indian street food, its a curry thats a little thicker than a stew, served with a roll. When you put it on a bun, it spills over the sides, like a sloppy joe. Mom added red onions and lime and cilantro on the side. It became our DIY 4th of July. Wed bring it to parties with idli [steamed rice cakes] tossed in gunpowder spice in Ziploc bags.  For dessert, wed go to Baskin-Robbins and get ice cream. But sometimes wed buy kulfi. The ultimate was kulfi falooda, which is like a sundae, with rose syrup.  I havent done pav bhaji for the 4th of July in a while. But now Im talking to my parents about it, and we have all the memories, and this is the year I want to bring it back.  Kimberly Prince, owner of Hotville Chicken  Menu: Fried chicken, corn on the cob, homemade pecan pie  If youre part of the Prince family, the 4th of July means the Nashville hot chicken festival. For the last few years, I fly back home to Nashville and roll up my sleeves. The Hot Chicken Festival started in 2007 to pay homage to my aunt Andre Prince, who owns Princes Hot Chicken Shack. Its the hottest day of the year, literally. The line for the festival is over a mile long. I wish I was exaggerating. I have walked that line myself: People from everywhere sitting on blankets with their kids, the babies, the dogs. The park isnt that big, but thats no excuse. We dont have a hot chicken festival here in L.A. yet, but its on my mind, and Im talking to all the places here to have one for future July 4ths.  This year, the 4th of July will be a work day for me. Its Hotvilles first 4th of July in our current space. Well break out the Kool-Aid, which is our summer drink. People ask what flavor is it, I say redor purple, if its grape. Well also have corn on the cob, banana pudding, pecan pie. But mostly, its fried chicken. Watch, Im going to make the 4th the hottest day of the year here.  Bryant and Kim Luu-Ng, owners of Cassia restaurant  Menu: Cantonese Roast suckling pig, Vietnamese pork rolls, and specialties from Dolan Uyghur, which features Asian Islamic food.  Kim: Every year since weve opened Cassia five years ago, weve closed the restaurant for July 4th and had a party at our house for our employees. We decided: Lets give everyone a day off and get food from places in the San Gabriel Valley where we live. Well order from different restaurants, depending on which ones we think are really good that year, and introduce these flavors to our staff.  This year were picking Uyghur food from Dolan Uyghur restaurant. We had minced lamb pie; its called goshnaan. And we had deep-fried naan, stir-fried with beef, seasoned with all kinds of spices. Whos seen that before? It was so unexpected. Our staff was, like, This is amazing. We have a lot of pride in expanding peoples understandings, it enhances the nuances of a culture.  People say, Oh, youre Vietnamese, I love eating pho. But thats just scratching the surface. Its the same thing with Chinese food. When its just that single dimension, youll never understand how rich that other culture is, and how rich and nuanced you are as a person. The people that work at Cassia are Asians of so many ethnicities: Vietnamese, Taiwanese, other Chinese. There are Black Americans, so many different Hispanic groups. We have close to 100 employees from 20-plus different countries, so many languages, and were celebrating American independence with the best food the San Gabriel Valley has to offer. Thats what it means to celebrate the 4th in Los Angelesand who you are.  We purposefully picked the 4th of July to do this. Growing up, my family and Bryants family adopted Anglo-American ways of celebrating the 4th. We had hamburgers and hot dogs, but wed also have Vietnamese barbecue.  Cheyenne and Bernard Nicholson, founders of Fun Diggity Funnel Cakes  Menu: Plant-based burger; funnel cake with ice cream, strawberries and whipped cream  Cheyenne: The 4th of July is the day we started Fun Diggity, three years ago. Its always been a party day for usalso, because my mom is our business partner. Her birthday is on the 4th. We were used to making it a gathering, so we decided its the day Fun Diggity would be born.  Were both from Compton; our store is in L.A. We get people from all over all the city. Most businesses are closed on the 4th, were open, and people have adopted us as their holiday dessert. Its one of our bestselling days: Last year, we sold 800 funnel cakes in one day.  Our feeling is: Youve got to have a burger on the 4th, but its a tradition you can evolve. Weve been incorporating more plant-based meat into our party. And then we bring out our cakes when the sun is going down and everyone is outdoors, and its like fireworks. Its our party.  Fernando Lopez, co-owner Guelaguetza and founder of the michelada party bus, Miche Mobile  Menu: Michelada-marinated carne asada, chorizo, grilled vegetables, and lots of sides and beverages  I came to the U.S. from Oaxaca when I was 7 years old. My parents had started the restaurant, Guelaguetza, and they were always working. Then they saw that no one came to the restaurant at night on July 4th, so theyd close and take us to the fireworks. You learn about Independence Day in school, but for me, the 4th of July was the one day of the year when I could see my family. Food wasnt always big for us, but eventually, when I was a teenager, we started barbecuing. But we werent hot dog and hamburger people. We had our traditional meats, like chorizo and carne asada with tortillas and plates of avocado, radishes, cheese, salsas, so many plates of toppings.  My parents retired around eight years ago. They went bankrupt, had to close everything. My sisters and I took everything we had and bought them out. When we took over at the height of the recession for the Mexican community; it hit our world later and for a prolonged time, and there were entire days when we had zero customers. We had to come up with a revenue stream, so we started selling our michelada [a spiced-up combination of beer and tomato juice] mix. No one knew what it was then, but they knew we had a good one. I bought an old VW bus, and tricked it out. It has beer taps. Theres a TV, speakers, and a DJ booth.  Our menu changes on the 4th of July. Sometimes we do our family mole, we import ingredients from Oaxaca. My family eats a lot of meat, so I make carne asada. Ive been throwing our michelada mix in with some steak, slice up some jalapenos and some onions, and then grill or saute it. Well grab big corn tortilla thats toasted, imported from Oaxaca (theyre called tlayuda), with pork spread, asiento, and a bunch of other good stuff. Usually, I have my friends over, and at least one of them will be a DJ, so they take over the booth in my truck and its a party.  Jazz Singsanong, owner of Jitlada Thai restaurant  Menu: Thai barbecued chicken and the chopped meat salad larb  When my kids were little, wed do barbecue in the back yard. Ive been in America for 40 years; I came here from Thailand with $200 and one suitcase to go to school. Then I met my husbandI didnt leave. One of my most famous dishes at Jitlada [one of the countrys most revered Thai restaurants, with a reputation for incendiary dishes] is the Jazz burger; I dont put it on the menu. I use all Thai ingredients. Its not American at all. I started making it because I found out that my daughter was hiding the food I made for her at school. She worried that her friends would make fun of her for her Thai food. Thats why I tried to make a burger for her. And Thai spaghetti. And thats why I make Thai barbecue chicken, not American barbecue chicken for the 4th of July.  The ingredients in the chicken are simple: Its whole cloves of garlic, cilantro stem, black pepper. You put it in the blender with coconut milk, fresh turmericif you can find it. Serve it with dried chile, as hot as you can stand it. When you throw all these ingredients in your barbecued chicken, the world is yours. My kids are grown up, but on 4th of July, I usually have kids from the Thai temple in Los Angeles. We have American flags outside, but the food isnt American. Its Thai.  Wes Avila, founder of Guerilla Tacos  Menu: Lobster, tortillas, potato salad, cocktail shrimp, and stiff Tiki drinks  The 4th of July was a big part of growing up here in L.A. If we werent going to Baja lighting fireworks, we were in L.A. with fireworks. Burgers and hot dogs were traditional for me as a kid, but also carne asada and chicken, which were really tasty marinated Mexican Cornish game hens. Also enchiladas. My Mom always made potato salad and macaroni salad. Every Mexican house I know makes some kind of starch salad. Its not typical in Mexico, but its a staple here. I also serve lobster because a lot of my childhood was going to Baja.  Its the place to get lobster, with flour tortillasthe good, stretchy ones. Also, tiki drinks are a thing for me. We do big big rum drinks, fruity ones like a Mai Tai, because usually its a beautiful day, along with a lot of beer. And we close the shop for the 4th of July; its one of the few days of the year that we do. Its a good reason to gather. People are upset with whats going on, some tradition or history thats not sitting well with people. Im taking the holiday to celebrate being together.

Period. But chasing deadlines, and completing targets, its one of the most missed meals, too. With busy lifestyles and most professionals working from home, breakfast becomes that one meal that you just cant afford to miss! So, having a good and filling breakfast is of paramount importance. We suggest you these five quick and easy breakfast options. Take your pick:  1. Avocado on toast  Theres nothing like a good ol avocado on crusty whole wheat toast, right? You can mash or slice it as per your taste. Scoop out the goodness of the pulp, and top it up with garlic, onion, tomato, add leafy herbs, drizzle balsamic vinegar. Or just go simple with red pepper flakes, lemon, salt and black pepper, and drizzle some extra-virgin olive oil on the top.  2. Vermicelli Upma  Wheat or semolina vermicelli is super quick to make. Theres no recipe simpler then making this one when trying your hands in the kitchen. Its also one breakfast option that has many variations. Boil it and toss it with chopped onions, ginger, and add lots of veggies like carrots, beans and peas and voil, its ready! Alternatively you could also heat oil, add urad dal, mustard and cumin seeds, chillies and curry leaves. Saut these with onions and tomato pure, veggies, a little bit of water and bring it to a boil. Add turmeric powder and salt. Allow all ingredients to cook for five to six minutes.Then add vermicelli and mix well.  Avocadoes on toast are quick to prepare and taste best in breakfast. (Photo: Shutterstock)  3. Masala Omelette  Most of us have a soft corner for eggs. So, masala omelette becomes one of the choicest dishes to prepare, and also the one that can be tried with all possible variations. You could add onions, tomatoes, green chillies, coriander, mushrooms, cheese or even chicken to make it more filling. Have fun with a variety of toppings such as capsicum and boiled potatoes. Make a smiling face with tomato ketchup, and serve!  4. Porridge  You cant go wrong with porridge! A quick instant brekkie option, all it needs is a little bit of focus. Mix oats, milk, and water in a bowl, and add a pinch of salt and microwave it for about five minutes. Top it up with fruits of your choice, and then you can completely skip adding sugar. Add honey only when the porridge turns lukewarm or after it cools down.  5. Chickpea Salad  This breakfast option will keep you kicked till evening! So on days when you have long conference meetings planned over phone or web, all you have to do is right in the morning, boil chickpeas and soak some soya granules. Later, add peanuts, onion, tomato, salt and pepper, and sprinkle some chaat masala and lime juice. Give it a good toss and its ready.

Crop failure in the rainy season and the late arrival of tomatoes in the mandis (wholesale markets) have led to the price hike. However, the prices are expected to fall after the arrival of the new crop from Himachal Pradesh next week.  A month ago, the price of tomatoes in Delhi's Azadpur mandi was between Rs 1.25 and Rs 4.75 per kg, while the wholesale price on Friday was between Rs 6 and Rs 44 per kg.  The model rate of tomato was Rs 3 per kg in Azadpur mandi on June 3, which has increased by 10 times to Rs 29 per kg. On July 2, the wholesale price of tomatoes rose to Rs 52 per kg in the mandi, which means there has been an increase of about 995% in the last one month. Due to the rise in wholesale prices, tomatoes were sold at Rs 80 per kg on Thursday in Delhi-NCR and Rs 50.70 per kg in Greater Noida .  Azadpur Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) chairman Adil Ahmad Khan said prices have gone up due to late arrival of tomatoes. The quantity of tomatoes received at Azadpur mandi was 528.2 tonne on June 3 while on July 3 it was 281.6 tonne.  The quantity has thus been reduced by nearly 50 per cent in a month. Only 241.9 tonne were received on July 2 due to which the wholesale price was ranging between Rs 6 and Rs 52 per kg while the model rate was Rs 32 per kg, Khan added.  He attributed the hike in the prices of all vegetables and fruits, not only tomatoes, due to the increase in diesel prices, which led to an increase in the transportation cost of vegetables.  From next week, the arrival of the new crop from Himachal Pradesh will lead to a decline in the prices of tomatoes. He said at present 90 per cent of the tomatoes in Delhi arrive from Himachal Pradesh while only 10 per cent are received from Haryana and Karnataka.  The consumption of all green vegetables, tomatoes and onions has declined during the past few months because of the shutdown of hotels, restaurants, canteens and dhabas following the nationwide lockdown in the wake of the corona pandemic . This led to a marked fall in prices. The wholesale price of tomatoes had come down to less than one rupee per kg.

The vegetarian food of the South, of course, is fantastic, but the flavours of the fish and meat dishes are unforgettable, too. Within the South, the cuisine of Kerala never fails to give me pleasure. A friend, who was pondering order-in options, had told us last week that Mahabelly  a Kerala restaurant in south Delhi  was delivering across town. I had eaten at Mahabelly when it opened and loved their food. So I did some surfing, had a look at the delivery menu and placed my order.  We asked for gunpowder idli (220), pork fry (440), vegetable stew with appams (225), Alleppey fish curry with appams (495), prawn mango curry (565), parottas (65 each) and extra appams (65 each). We paid 3,300 or so (with taxes, packing charges) for the food, and it was enough for three meals: lunch, dinner and breakfast.  Needless to say, I loved the pork the most. The dish consisted of fatty chunks that had been roasted with grated coconut, spices, and chillies. The pork was juicy and soft, and the spices, including crispy curry leaves, added to the taste. The prawn-mango curry was much loved at home, and I enjoyed it, too  the sauce was mildly sweet and deliciously tart (with little pieces of mango in it), and the prawns in the gravy were crispy from the outside and tender within. I had the pork and the prawns with a flaky, layered Malabari parotta, and enjoyed the meal thoroughly.  We had the idli for breakfast the next day. It came with a coconut and a tomato-onion chutney. The idlis were, as I expected, smeared with a spicy podi, but I didnt think theyd be fried. I would have preferred them steamed, for the fried pieces were a little too toasty.  Lunch, again, was a delight. The vegetable stew was a mix of vegetables (beans, carrots et al) cooked in a light coconut milk, and went well with the soft and fluffy appams. The Allepey fish was in a coconut-based gravy, too, but had a different taste altogether. The fish  Mahabelly usually uses seer fish  came in a superb sauce made colourful and tangy with kokum, and then lightened with coconut milk. The gravy was prepared with fried shallots, a ginger-garlic paste, curry leaves, rice powder, Kashmiri chillies, turmeric, ground coriander and fenugreek. We had this with home-cooked joha rice, a small and fragrant Assamese variety.  The delivery menu includes Thalassery chicken biryani (350), mackerel (aila) fish (445), chicken 65 (Rs 385) and gobhi 65 (Rs 299). There are small meals, too, such as Amrits Dal Khichdi with pickle and pappadam (199), three chapattis with potato curry (199), two parottas with tomato fry (199) and two appams with chicken stew (250).  I am glad Mahabelly is delivering (and all the way to East Delhi, too) for thats the only way food businesses can survive in these difficult times. The restaurant is run by a group of young men who are passionate about food (they have an outlet in Saket and Gurugram) and I hope they do well.  The writer is a seasoned food critic",TOMATO

The trade picture is crystal clear that from the first week of June onwards, the prices have maintained a steady march dangling between 30 and 40 a kg in the retail market till June-end. July took the consumers for a sudden surprise, with a kg of tomato of second grade selling at 60 to 70. It is estimated in the market circles that the prices would double by the month-end.  The scenario of tomato business took a sudden leap in this second half of the year, thanks to the vitamin-savvy consumers not only in Chittoor district, but also from all over the country, particularly the metros. The first grade of tomato sold at 48 a kg at the Madanapalle market is commanding 100 in the posh localities of Mumbai, Bengaluru and Chennai.  On Saturday, the Madanapalle market saw the arrival of over 600 tonnes of tomatoes, with a dip of 100 tonnes compared to last week. At the same time, the local market at V. Kota in Kuppam division for the first of time in six months saw a whopping arrival of 300-plus tonnes, while the Palamaner market added another 300 tonnes. In the months from April to August-end, the price of tomato would generally be on the downward trend, even reaching 5 a kg. The sudden spike, which is considered unusual at this season, is without a doubt attributed to the immunity seekers.  Dhananjay, an elderly tomato grower at Palamaner mandal, told The Hindu that he had been despatching regular loads to Bengaluru and Goa during the last two weeks. The size and quality of my produce would invite no argument. I cant tell you how much I get, but I am highly satisfied. This state of affairs in a month like July is something strange, he said.  Awareness  Assistant Director (Marketing) P. Gopi said that in this COVID-19 situation, naturally there is a sea of awareness among people about health and immunity.  Tomato is definitely rich with many essential vitamins. Split into three grades, the vegetable is reaching all sections. Some vendors are making big money by selling even the third grade and scrap stocks to the consumers. The exports to almost all big cities in the south and elsewhere in the north from Chittoor district are very encouraging, he said.  Meanwhile, it is projected that with the COVID-19 perception set to continue for the next few months, the tomato prices might skyrocket and might even remain beyond the reach of the common man. Coupled with this, the months from July to November would see a spree of festivals starting with Varalakshmi Vratam, Adi Krithika, Vinayaka Chaviti, Dasara and Deepavali, when the prices of all most all vegetables would be in high.",TOMATO

(Photo: Parthasarathi Biswas) Trucks waiting to load tomatoes at the Narayangaon APMC. (Photo: Parthasarathi Biswas)  Four years since the Maharashtra governments decisions to delist fruits and vegetables from being compulsorily bought and sold in APMC (agricultural produce market committee) mandis, it is business as usual at Narayangaon.  This bustling wholesale market for tomatoes in Junnar taluka of Pune district has seen no drop in arrivals of the red berry or farmer and trader footfall. And that may hold some clues to the likely impact of the Centres own recent reform dismantling the monopoly of APMCs in the trading of agri-produce and giving farmers the freedom to sell directly to wholesalers, retailers, processors and exporters or even through electronic platforms.  Deepak Bhise, a farmer from Yedgaon village, about 7 km from the Narayangaon APMC, plants tomatoes on his entire four-acres holding in February-March for harvesting in August-September. Back in June 2016, when the then Devendra Fadnavis-led NDA government in Maharashtra announced delisting of horticultural produce from the ambit of APMC trading, he was quite upbeat.  I thought buyers will flock to my farm, recalls the 31-year-old, whose tomato yields average 18-20 tonnes per hectare. Bhise, then, tried to strike deals with traders for lifting straight from his fields. A leading online grocer even approached him for supplying 10 tonnes. After taking delivery of the produce that I supplied in 20-kg crates, they said that the tomatoes were not red enough. Not only did I not receive full payment, they even did not return my crates, he says.  That bitter experience has led Bhise to go back to selling at the APMC. Once in a while, I get enquiries through online platforms, but their requirement is often in kilos when my harvest in a single picking is in tonnes. What will I do with my remaining produce, he points out, while describing the Centres recent Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion & Facilitation) Ordinance as good on paper.  Yogesh Shinde, who is from the same village and grows pomegranate and papaya on his eight acres, nods in agreement. I am not comfortable with traders who come and ask if they can lift straight from my field. I would rather deal with commission agents at Gultekdi (Pune) and Vashi (Mumbai) APMCs. Yes, I have to spend on transport, but at least there is surety and promptness in payment, he says.  Bhise, like Shinde, has experimented with selling to online players and direct-to-consumer platforms. But there are two problems with them. Their orders are too small for it to be feasible for us to deliver. Secondly, they want the best of the pick. So, what do we do with the balance quantity? Only the APMCs have the liquidity from a large number of buyers, due to which we can offload our entire produce. And there is a market for the best as well average and not-so-good grade, adds Shinde, who annually harvests 8 tonnes per acre of papayas and 12-15 tonnes in the case of pomegranates.  Sanjay Dufare, a trader at Narayangaon whose firm supplies tomatoes to wholesale markets in Mumbai, Delhi and Kolkata, is even less impressed with the Narendra Modi governments market reform ordinance issued on June 5. For somebody like me, it makes more sense to buy from a place where farmers themselves bring their produce. Most farms are scattered and have no navigable roads for me to send pick-up trucks. What else is a mandi for? And where else can I get such a wide variety of produce to choose from?, he states.  Proof of the limitations of reforms is market arrivals. The Narayangaon APMC  which also trades in other vegetables such as brinjal, bitter gourd, cauliflower, cabbage and onion  recorded total arrival of 29.47 lakh quintals in 2014-15 (October-September) and 33.26 lakh quintals in 2015-16. Despite vegetables being delisted from exclusive trading in APMCs, this mandi saw arrivals of 37.37 lakh quintals in the 2018-19 marketing year.  The move to permit fruits and vegetables to be traded outside the physical boundaries of APMC yards without attracting any mandi cess had led to a seven-day strike called by traders, especially in the Vashi market of Navi Mumbai. The Fadnavis administration had, nevertheless, pushed through what was then seen as a significant reform.  But four years down the line, figures from the Maharashtra State Agricultural Marketing Board (MSAMB) shows the total arrivals of fruits and vegetables in APMC mandis across the state to have more or less remained the same: from 949 lakh quintals in 2014-15 and 1,138 lakh quintals in 2015-16 to 1,235 lakh quintals, 1,183 lakh quintals and 1,122 lakh quintals in the subsequent three marketing years (October-September).  Hardly any trade has gone out of the APMCs after the 2016 reform. Nothing much will change even with the latest reform that goes beyond fruits and vegetables. Some business may shift to organised retailers and various online platforms, but the major APMCs  Lasalgaon for onions, Narayangaon for tomatoes, Nashik for other vegetables, Sangola and Indapur for pomegranates or Latur for soyabean and pulses  will definitely survive. Farmers and traders will themselves ensure that, admits an MSAMB official.",TOMATO

While we were focusing on the problem, Shantanu Pratap Singh was creating a solution. In June last year, this Allahabad-based B.Tech student gave birth to The Sagez  eco-friendly seed papers.Singh found that if 10,000 seed papers are sold and 10 per cent of them were planted, it could impact the environment greatly. A students-run brand, their idea was simple. Use the seed paper and send it back to earth by planting it.  After the initial success and feedback, Singh and his team included pens and pencils in their product list. All the merchandise is made of recycled paper. While the pens and pencils have a seed embedded at the far end, the paper is filled with seeds too and is used to make other stationery goodies.Initially, he used seven varieties of seeds like sunflower and chilli in the paper products. But now he has limited them to basil, wildflower, marigold and mix vegetable. The seeds to be used depends on parameters like how much pressure they can bear when they are embedded on paper, their shelf life, and how they react in contact with moisture. Based on these, I rounded in on the four variants, explains Singh, 21, the CEO and founder of the firm. The pens and pencils have over 15 seed varieties including carrot, cucumber, chilli, tomato and onion. The germination is 70-80 per cent effective, he says.  The Sagez has also collaborated with companies abroad. For a company in Netherlands, we made seed paper ID cards. The seeds work well in all terrains and weather conditions, he shares. With their current manufacturing set-up in Uttar Pradesh and Gujarat, the bootstrapped company plans to have a base in Chennai or Bengaluru once the pandemic exits.  The lockdown has not been easy as their shipping has been impacted, and the team is subjected to the wrath of customers. Shipping within India will begin soon. We have made our social media presence stronger and started taking pre-orders. We are also selling on Amazon, he says. Singh wants to promote the concept in schools, colleges and corporates.

The fritter shop (kadai) that operates out of a tiny blue window (jannal) on Ponnambala Vathiyar Street near the East gate of the Kapaleeshwar Temple has been a landmark in Mylapore for over a decade now.  One of two familiar faces behind the window, Sivaramakrishnan, alias Ramesh, is however no more. The 58-year-old man succumbed to COVID-19 on Sunday morning, his family members told Express. At the time of his death, the family was unaware of the reason.  An unkempt queue, the smell of deep fried food, a crowd of people gobbling the snack and the grilled blue window was the only way to locate the shop. For years, it gained the fondness of Chennai's residents and visitors, picking up the title ""Jannal Kadai Bajji."" The shop bears no name board.  Peek into the window, Ramesh or his brother Chandrashekaran, sits on a slab surrounded by bowls of piping hot Bajjis, Bondas, Vadais and Idlies. All conversations meant business to Ramesh.

""The shop was part of growing up for many in Mylapore and I realised that only some people outside had tried it. The walks made the shop more famous than it already was,"" said Venkataraman adding that Ramesh was stern to the staff but kind to the poor.  ""I have seen him offer free food to the poor on many occasions. Even those who paid for the food always found the food moderately priced,"" he said.  Baskar Seshadri, a social activist and a resident of Mylapore told Express that he will miss Ramesh dearly. ""I have been eating at the shop for the last 15 years. I used to be terrified of eating street food and I made an exception for this place,"" he said.  He added that he visited the shop a mere two or three weeks ago, even during the lockdown, as he felt nostalgic for the food. ""I have arthritis and cannot stand for long. Despite this, I used to wait for the Bajji and munch it on the street,"" he said.  Ramesh suffered from diabetes and had been admitted to a private hospital last week after he fell sick. He was later moved to a government hospital where he was being treated until Sunday. After his demise, his COVID-19 tests returned positive.  Speaking to Express, a family member said that the shop will however not shut its doors. ""Even as many people recognise Shivaraman, the shop is registered under Chandrashekaran - his brother. Give us a month and we will be back to business. The shop will sell food that tastes the same,"" the family member said.",TOMATO

When people try to get fitter, they cut down the consumption of oil completely. And even though there are immense health benefits of removing oils from your diet, it is best to have a healthy balance of fats, proteins, carbohydrates and even sugar in your diet. Cutting any food out completely, be it sugar or carbs, leaves you with many cravings and you may binge eat. Moderation, is always the key.  Fats are not bad, but oily foods are. Essentially, consuming saturated fats in any capacity poses a great disease risk for humans, and a lot of research shows that processed food, including oils are not meant to be consumed by humans as the good bacteria present in the body recognises it as a toxin and breaks it down as such. Deep-friend foods, foods high in oil content have a lot of calories and not enough nutrition to go with it, they are also extremely harmful to health and cause various heart problems. Reducing oil in your diet can also help in weight loss. Even small amounts of foods with oil are loaded with calories, it requires a lot of these foods to make you feel full while eating. If you reverse this process and consume foods that satisfy you hunger quicker and with fewer calories, it can help with weight loss.  Strict diets do not have to mean giving up the things you are fond of eating or sacrificing on taste.

After working with an IT start-up for a while, the MBA graduate from Aluva in Kerala felt compelled to move to a vocation closer to my heart. Anas says he then started researching eco-friendly and cost-effective methods of gardening and cultivation and realised the potential for sustainable and environment-protecting soil-less farming.  Organures organic substitute for soil | Photo Credit: Special Arrangement  In 2017, Anas brought out a soil substitute that he says is manufactured from a host of organic materials with coco peat as the chief holding medium. With space and soil availability becoming sparse in urban areas, soil substitutes are finding favour as simultaneously the push for self-cultivated organic produce and green indoor spaces gain wider appeal, says the 28-year-old.  Anas says his potting mixture is 100% soil-free, with the principal raw materials being treated coco peat, pulp from banana stem, water hyacinth subject to bio-reaction and sugarcane press mud among others. After cleansing and bio-treatment, the raw materials are powdered and mixed in the requisite proportion. To increase the mineral value of the mixture, organic plants that serve as fertilisers such as seaweed are added after due bio-reaction processes, adds the entrepreneur.  Mint grown in a passion fruit shell | Photo Credit: Special Arrangement  However, depending on purpose, whether the plants to be potted are ornamental, medicinal or for harvest, the components in the soil substitutes are customised during production. For instance, common indoor plants like succulents and cacti need more heat at the base and its good if the soil medium ensures this. Hence, additional materials such as coffee husk powder are added to the potting mixture for such plants. Whereas, herbal plants need a relatively more fertile medium and so suitable nutrients are added. As regards kitchen garden, ideally, the soil substitute needs good fertility, he explains.  Anas, who likes to research new methods of cultivation and soil substitutes and creative indoor spaces, says he endeavours to keep his home a green space, nurturing a variety of plants there. Apart from ornamental plants like succulents, aglaonema, anthurium and so on, I also like to keep a few with medicinal values and I have tulsi, aloe vera, mint, many varieties of hibiscus, all grown with soil substitutes, he says.  A succulent growing in a ceramic pot | Photo Credit: Special Arrangement  Anas' experiments at his kitchen garden has yielded him veggies like potato, tomatoes and carrot and leafy greens such as kale, lettuce, broccoli and varieties of spinach. And the veggies did come in handy for me during the lockdown, he says with a chuckle.  With a large quantity of sand that end up in urban spaces for purposes of gardening and domestic-level cultivation are mined, agricultural scientists highlight the advantages of shifting to suitable soil substitutes. Shinoj Subramanian, senior scientist and Head of Krishi Vigyan Kendra Ernakulam, says soil-less farming in Kerala is chiefly put into practice in the form of hydroponics and use of coir pith-based soil substitute. Though hydroponics is an effective method, its relatively costlier. As regards natural soil, its source is often questionable. In such a context, soil substitutes are a feasible alternative for domestic gardens, he says.  Tomato grown using the soil substitute | Photo Credit: Special Arrangement  However, Shinoj says that for large-scale agriculture, which requires clayey soil, this may not be really conducive as it is difficult to reconstitute the rich, natural qualities of clayey soil.

Taken aback, I mumbled a feeble no  There is a scene in Nicholas Kharkhongars Axone where a landlady screams at her tenants from the Northeast for being audacious enough to cook their stinky food, something she had specifically told them not to do. The pungent smell of axone (pronounced akhuni)  fermented soya bean  that the girls were discreetly using to cook a traditional pork curry, had reached every nostril in the building and raised a storm. This scene took me straight back to my own Delhi days years ago.  It was 2006. I was straight out of college and had landed an internship at a media house. I decided to move out of the hostel and get a place of my own. I had my carefully rehearsed lines ready in mind to negotiate the rent. But bafflingly, the first question a house-owner asked me was, No stinky food, I hope? Taken aback, I mumbled a feeble no. The broker with me felt the need to be more vociferous on my behalf. Arre nahin, she is from Assam. They dont cook all that there. Does she look like them? The house-owner gave a half-convinced nod. I turned and left.  Three days and countless such visits later to matchbox buildings in Kingsway Camp, Mukherjee Nagar, Indra Vihar and other nagars in north Delhi  which, ironically, is full of students from the Northeast who come to study at Delhi University  I finally made peace with the comments and found a place. For the first couple of months, I adhered strictly to my own rule of minimum interaction with the landlord and his extended family, including the daadi who always lay sprawling on her khatiya at the entrance of the house, keeping an eagle eye on the tenants. Trouble began when I returned after a visit back home. Packed in my suitcase, wrapped in layers and layers of polythene bags, was a bottle of khorisa.  Versatile ingredient  For the uninitiated, khorisa is fermented, tender bamboo shoot, which is widely used in Assamese cuisine  as in other parts of the Northeast  for its distinct and tangy/ sour/ acidic taste and strong flavour. The shoots are first defoliated, then pounded in a dheki (a leg-operated pounder) or scraped and ground. It is then left to ferment for about two weeks until it turns sour. Once ready, it can be used in vegetable dishes, with fish, chicken, and pork, or just pickled with oil and chillies.  Like axone, khorisas nemesis too is its smell  unabashedly full-bodied and pungent. I was not brave enough to use it. Like a thief keeping stolen treasure close to his heart, I held the bottle gingerly in my hands and then pushed it into the darkest corner of the kitchen cupboard. But the heart won over the head and like Upasana (Sayani Gupta) and Chanbi (Lin Laishram) in the film, I decided to take the risk.  And so, one fine Sunday afternoon, I dived into the mission. Ideally, I would have loved khorisa maas  fresh river fish cooked with khorisa  but settled for chicken, which also tastes divine with this magic potion.  Daring escapades  I took the usual precautions to prevent the smell wafting down the staircase. Deodorant spray cans were emptied in the rooms and in the balcony for added effect, and after what seemed like an extraordinary feat, my sister and I finally savoured the taste of success. That evening, my heart skipped several beats when the landlord stopped me on my way down the stairs to ask, Did you have a party? Perfume ka smell yahan tak aa raha tha. (I could smell the perfume down here.) I smiled and almost ran out.  I did dare to use khorisa many times afterwards. Grind it a little in a mortar, add a spoonful in curries and dal, sometimes with a dash of mustard oil, a little onion and some chilli for a lethal chutney. That momentary authentic smell  before its drowned in perfume  felt like home.  For many of the thousands of Northeasterners in Delhi, it is still a struggle to accept it as home. In 2007, the Delhi Police issued a booklet titled Security Tips for Northeast Students/ Visitors in Delhi in the backdrop of a spate of violent incidents against the community. Under Food Habits, the booklet said Bamboo shoot, akhuni and other smelly dishes should be prepared without creating ruckus in the neighbourhood. Naturally, this invited a backlash.  But life is not all black and white and despite those crude, racist remarks passed casually, Delhi has given many of us at least a couple of well-meaning Hyper Shiv pals in our lives. I have a bunch of them and hold them closely, like my bottle of khorisa.  Sunday recipe  Khorisa maas (fish cooked in khorisa)  Ingredients  4 pieces rohu fish  3-4 tbsp khorisa  1 medium-sized onion, grated  1 tsp ginger-garlic paste  1 tsp turmeric  1 tsp white mustard seed  1 medium-sized tomato, finely chopped  2 green chillies  4 tbsp mustard oil  Salt to taste  Method  1. Wash the pieces of fish and rub salt and a half teaspoon of turmeric powder on them. Keep them aside.  2. In a pan, heat the mustard oil and lightly fry the fish pieces. Take them out and keep them aside.  3. In the same pan, heat the oil and add chillies and white mustard seeds until they crackle. Add onion and ginger-garlic paste and saut it for a minute.  4. Add the rest of the turmeric powder and salt. Keep stirring.  5. Add the tomato pieces and cover with a lid. As the tomato gets pulpy, add a cup of water and cover it again.  6. As the gravy mix blends, add the fish pieces and give it a careful stir.  7. After a few minutes, add the khorisa and stir it in the gravy. Let the gravy come to a boil without the lid on.  Your khorisa maas is now ready. Ideally to be enjoyed with plain rice.  The writer is a Gujarat-based freelance journalist.",TOMATO

Our check dams were running below the normal level, lakes had dried up, and on most days, getting two buckets of water was a matter of luxury, at least in the privileged neighbourhoods. While we were all focussed on the problem, Shantanu Pratap Singh was busy creating a solution. In June last year, this Allahabad-based BTech student from SRM Institute of Science and Technology gave birth to The Sagez  a platform for seed papers.  Sowing seeds  Working determinedly, in his reserach, Shantanu found that if a vendor sells 10,000 seed papers and even 10 per cent of them were planted, it could impact the environment greatly. Planting trees is the solution to end water scarcity. We all know that afforestation can reduce soil erosion and increase the water table, says Shantanu. The Sagez was born out of this sheer determination. Shantanus idea was simple  use the seed paper and send it back to earth by planting it. While the brand was launched in June 2019, the first sales happened at NIT Trichys Festember in October 2019.  To ensure his message was heard, he also gave seed papers to artists for feedback. It took six months for research and development to bring out better versions of the product. My idea was to create a large impact and do mass production of the products. As a brand, we also got in touch with agricultural universities and paper manufacturers to know more about what will work well in the long-run, says the 21-year-old. After the initial success and feedback, Shantanu and his team took the next step to include seed pens and pencils in their product list. All the merchandise is made of recycled paper. While the pens and pencils have a seed embedded at the far end of the writing instrument, their brand of recycled paper is filled with seeds too. Using this seed paper, they also produce other stationery goodies like bookmarks, envelopes and postcards.  Mindful effort  Initially, Shantanu used seven varieties of seeds like sunflower and chilli in the paper products. But now he has limited them to basil, wildflower, marigold and mix vegetable. The kind of seeds to be used in these paper products depends on certain parameters. We need to know how much pressure the seeds can bear when they are being embedded on paper, the shelf life of the seeds because some tend to lose their germination properties, and how they react when they come in contact with moisture. Based on all these, I rounded in on the four variants, he explains. The pens and pencils have more than 15 seed varieties including carrot, cucumber, chilli, tomato and onion.  Taking the green message to a global audience, The Sagez has collaborated with various companies in the Netherlands and London to promote their products. For a company called Fashion For Good in Netherlands, we made seed paper ID cards. These collaborations have shown that the seeds work well in all terrains and weather conditions, he shares. The team also struck a deal with a company in Germany, but the pandemic-induced lockdown has put to a halt to their plans. With their current manufacturing set-up in Uttar Pradesh and Gujarat, the bootstrapped company plans to have a base in Chennai or Bengaluru in six months, once the pandemic exits.  Finding manufacturers and managing funds was difficult initially. With time, we met people who have sustainability goals join our journey and our brand grew. Now we have three full-time employees and four interns, working from remote locations, elaborates Shantanu, the CEO and founder of the company. The lockdown has not been easy on this eco-start-up as their shipping has been impacted, and the team is subjected to the wrath of their customers. We understand the clients frustration. Shipping within India will begin soon. In the meantime, we have made our social media presence stronger and have started taking pre-orders.  We have also collaborated with Amazon to sell our products through the e-commerce site, he reveals. The crisis, however, has not dampened his spirit. Shantanu wants to promote the concept of seed papers and pens in schools, colleges and corporate by collaborating with them. We are motivating people through our Instagram page to post pictures of their plants so that others are encouraged too. The germination is 70-80 per cent effective. I also have a small garden full of plants planted from these papers, he shares. Eco solutions can be costly, agrees Shantanu, but for a better, greener future, we have to pay a price and what better way than to invest on nature?

If the price rise of perishable items has been sharp, that of semi-perishable items, like potato, which can be hoarded easily, has been even steeper.The price of Jyoti, a common variety of potato produced in abundance and consumed widely in Bengal, rose to Rs 28 a kg on Saturday, though even a week and a half ago, it sold for Rs 22 a kg. This was because a section of traders had been hoarding huge stocks, hoping for a windfall in case of further rise of potato prices, said a trader from Hooghly.Buyers have been even more shocked when it came to buying other vegetables, such as, tomato, brinjal and bitter gourd. Before Amphan hit Bengal, tomato sold for Rs 20-24/kg but it cost Rs 70-75 a kg on Saturday. Parwal or pointed gourd, which used to cost Rs 25-30 a kilo, was sold for Rs 50-60 a kg.Transportation cost has increased manifold because of expensive diesel rates and lack of local trains. Earlier 90% vegetables was transported by train. Ferrying the essentials by road costs five times more. Secondly, a section of middlemen, who has now become active, is raising prices, said Kamal Dey, member of Market Task Force . Moreover, containment zones in the neighbouring districts, which produce the bulk of vegetables, have been cut off from the city. Vegetable growers there are being forced to sell their produces at local markets. The supply line issue has widened demand-supply gap. Rain in north Bengal has also cut off the supply of some vegetables, he said.Dilip Madal, who sells vegetables at Lake Market, rued the drop in the number of middle-class buyers.

Prices have firmed up Rs 10 per kg on a weekly basis since June 1, not only in the unorganised retail markets in Delhi, but also at Safal retail vegetable outlets of Mother Dairy and etailers Bigbasket and Grofers.  Bigbasket was selling tomatoes in the range of Rs 60-66 per kg and Grofers at Rs Rs 53-55 per kg on Sunday.  In the unorganised markets, tomatoes were available around Rs 70 per kg depending on the quality and locality, traders said.  They said prices are ruling high even in the wholesale mandis where arrivals are not robust in the last few weeks from the producing states.  Traders also mentioned that rise in COVID-19 cases in producing states of Southern India has restricted harvesting of the crop in some pockets.  The Union Consumer Affairs Ministry data shows a sharp increase in prices of tomato not only in Delhi but also in the neighbouring states.  Last week, Consumer Affairs Minister Ram Vilas Paswan said the price volatility in tomatoes was due to lean season and the commodity being highly perishable.  Experts said prices of tomatoes normally shoot up during the lean period and the last five year's data show the same trend.  Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Jharkhand, Punjab, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Jammu and Kashmir and Arunachal Pradesh are the states with deficit tomato production in the country.  They depend on surplus producing states for supplies.The country produces about 19.73 million tonnes of tomato annually, while the consumption is about 11.51 million tonnes, as per the official data.",TOMATO

Now give a healthy spin and turn the comfort food into a wholesome meal. Packed with nutrition and fresh flavours, here are some smart tips and tweaks from chefs for you to prepare a healthy burger without the guilt.  Healthy burgers will taste like punishment and diet food if they do not first scream with yummy flavours for the palate. They have to seduce and please mind, body and soul, all equally, thus, it is important to bring textures, flavour, colours, aromas, all into the recipe, says chef Suvir Saran.  He recalls the days when Joyce Goldstein, a friend, an award-winning chef and author of more than 27 cookbooks introduced him to farro, a type of grain and how it has become a staple in his pantry ever since. He says, Farro is now always in my pantry. I love using it to make patties for a veggie burgers. In addition to protein and heart-healthy fibre, the texture it contributes is incredibly hearty. He also adds, If you cant find farro, you can make the burgers with quinoa or Freekeh or millet instead.  One can also add potatoes, mushrooms and parmesan cheese to add a depth flavour to the patty. Saran suggests, If you want to indulge in these on a more regular basis, replace the potatoes with sweet potatoes instead. For those that are watching their intake in regards to diabetes or metabolic syndrome, the use of panko in the recipe can be substituted with crushed peanuts or even ground lentil flour.  Moving on to a healthier bun to go with a wholesome patty, chef Vinay Trilokiya, Farzi Cafe, Aerocity says, It can be a pleasurable experience if different grains in its base are paired with the right ingredients along with appropriate cheese and a variety of vibrant vegetables. Trilokiya also feels that made just responsibly, these can be your go-to meals with the right balance between protein, carbohydrates, fibre and flavour.  He recommends, As a chef, I would suggest using multigrain flour, ragi flour, whole wheat flour for making burger buns. In order to break the myth and bring the healthier side, try adding grilled or boiled bodies to the burger, such as boiled or grilled chicken, fish, meat, or one can try making patties of the same, and then bake in oven, and there you get the healthy meal.  For those looking to skip mayonnaise and tomato ketchup for the burger sauce, replace it with home-made tzatziki, guacamole and hummus for added texture and flavours. For the toppings, either put fresh vegetables or grill them. One could also opt for a single bun instead of two buns to make an open burger and avoid the extra calories.  Healthy burgers will taste like punishment and diet food if they do not first scream with yummy flavours for the palate says chef Suvir Saran  Farro and mushroom burgers by chef Suvir Saran  Ingredients: 3/4 cup/125 gm farro, 500 gm red potatoes (about 3), 6 tablespoons/90 gm natural vegetable oil, 1 sprig fresh rosemary, 1 sprig fresh thyme, 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, 500 gm brown mushroom caps, finely chopped,1 and 1/4 teaspoons kosher salt, 5 to 8 tablespoons/75 to 120 ml extra-virgin olive oil, 3 finely chopped shallots,1 tablespoon/15 ml dry white wine, dry vermouth, or water, 1/2 cup/50 gm finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese and 1 cup/50 g panko breadcrumbs  Method: Bring 2 1/4 cups/540 ml of water to a boil in a medium saucepan. Add the farro, return to a boil, cover and reduce the heat to medium-low, cooking until the farro is tender, about 30 minutes. Turn off the heat, fluff the farro with a fork, cover and set aside. While the farro cooks, boil the potatoes. Bring a large saucepan of water to a boil, add the potatoes, return the water to a boil, and cook until a paring knife easily slips into the centre of the largest potato, about 20 minutes. Drain and set aside. Once the potatoes are cool, peel them and place them in a large bowl. Remove the needles and leaves from the rosemary and thyme branches and place them in a large skillet along with the butter and black pepper. Melt the butter over medium-high, stirring occasionally. Once the herbs start cracking, after about 1 1/2 minutes, add the mushrooms and salt. Cook the mushrooms until they release their liquid and the pan is dry again, 6 to 7 minutes, stirring often. Transfer the mushrooms to the bowl with the potatoes and set aside.  Heat 1 tablespoon/15 ml of olive oil over medium-high heat in the skillet. Add the shallots and cook until they are soft and just starting to brown, about 2 minutes. Add the wine (or Vermouth or water) and stir to work in any browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Turn off the heat and scrape the shallots into the bowl with the mushrooms and potatoes. Add the Parmesan along with the farro. Use a potato masher or fork to mash the ingredients together.  For the mixture into 10 patties. Place the panko in a shallow dish and press the top and bottom of each patty into the panko to evenly coat. Heat 1/4 cup/60 ml of olive oil in a clean large skillet over medium-high heat. Add 5 patties and cook on each side until nicely browned and crusty, 8 to 10 minutes total. Remove the patties from the skillet and place them on a plate. Repeat with the remaining patties, adding more oil between batches if necessary. Serve hot.

It is going to be a while before you manage to score an invite for an elaborate wedding lunch.  Fortunately, despite the pandemic, popular city cooks have been able to cater to enthusiastic diners via delivery apps. In Chennai, of course, biryani is an emotion. Its Friday office bonding, teamed with chicken 65. And Sunday family lunch. It comes in sleek packs as well as in plastic buckets. There is rarely a consensus on what the citys best version is. Basmati or seeraga samba? Ambur or Awadhi? Mutton, chicken, prawn or fish? At least we agree on tea time: bun-butter-jam FTW.  Sahibs  The man who refereed the citys biggest biryani wars has jumped into the fray.  M Mohamed Ali, who runs the Food Consulate in Velachery, has hosted a face off between the citys most popular biryani brands for the past five years. Last year, 10 top contenders made mutton biryani, which was then judged by an audience of almost 1400 people at a buffet. This year, he launched Sahibs.  We make Chennai wedding style dhum biryani, says Mohamed, explaining that they deliver it in packs of 2.5 kilograms, which can serve up to five people. Sahibs currently makes three types of biryani  chicken (2,000), mutton (2,500) and prawn (3,000).  The pack also includes raita, brinjal thokku and bread halwa. Using long grain basmati rice, this version of the iconic dish is inspired by Mohameds hometown, Patemanagaram, which is about 30 kilometres away from Thoothukudi.  There is a focus on sourcing quality spices. Mohamed says that after a lot of research, he realised that high quality ingredients and simple, but responsible, processes are the best way to maximise flavour. Our spices are carefully sourced. We use three kinds of chillies: one for colour, one for heat and one for body. Everything is stone ground in a traditional mill, he states.  Of course, launching during a pandemic means that there is a special focus on hygiene. Our kitchen looks like a surgery theatre, with all the cooks in PPE. The packaging may look rather industrial, he states, adding however that the food is delivered hot, safe and sealed.  Sahibs delivers lunch on Thursday, Friday and Saturday. Orders need to be given by 5 pm, a day ahead. Call +91 89992 66662.  Pumpkin Tales  Pumpkin Tales focusses on tomato tales this month. Chindi Varadarajulu has been using the lockdown to explore indigenous produce, and is thrilled about recently discovering heirloom Kasinapatnam tomatoes, which she is using in salads. These bright, knobbly tomatoes come from seeds preserved by tribes in Andhra Pradeshs Arauku valley, she says, adding that she plans to visit them as soon as it is safe to hop on planes again.  Inspired by seed saver and agriculturist Prabhakar Rao, of Bengaluru-based Hariyalee farm, Chindi is using this downtime to learn about local, underused vegetables so she can incorporate them in her menus. To me it is a history, an heirloom we have saved, she says. Adding that she really enjoys the flavours, she admits that it could also be influenced by the awe of being able to taste decades of history.  Undoubtedly, these vegetables have more character than generic supermarket produce. Besides, bio-diversity makes food so much more interesting. While you wait till its safe to eat out again, this could be a good time to experiment with growing heirloom seeds in your kitchen garden: the internet is rife with suggestions on how to get started.  Also, if youre sick of cooking dinner, Pumpkin Tales just released a range of preservative-free food to stock your freezer. There are chicken and vegetable pot pies, made with puff pastry and as well as lasagne and wheat enchiladas. While cooking can be fun, sometimes its a relief to do nothing more than defrost and bake for a hot meal.  Gopaul dairy  For decades Gopaul dairy (9952954965) has had a cult following, despite its tiny space in Parrys Corner, because of the buns generously filled with Uthukuli butter.  The butter, which arrived on the night train, now travels by lorry so that there is no glitch in the mechanics set in place in 1953. Gopaul is currently run by 66-year-old V Krishnaraj, whose grandfather started the business, and his 29-year-old son, Pramoth.  Lockdown hit them hard  Pramoth says they used to serve 300 to 400 buns everyday. Now they make about 150, most of which are sold via delivery apps. I get mine via Dunzo, thanks to an alert friend, who manages to snag some before they sell out.  The buns, which have always been sourced from the same cottage industry in Mylapore, are tasty, but it is the white butter that is the star. Whipped till fluffy, it is generously slathered between the bread along with a quick smear of regular Kissan jam.  Theyre delicious, and deceptively light. Eat these fresh, as soon as they arrive. Each bun, priced at 25, is endearingly wrapped in butter paper and then newspaper, all tied together with twine.  One of the few surprises of 2020 that is all joy.

My interest in DIY skincare comes from my mom and grandmother! They used to give me tips on every skincare problem I had simple remedies like applying haldi and tulasi or honey and cinnamon powder for pimples was always there from the beginning. As life was racy before lockdown I couldnt invest much time on it. The only good thing about lockdown was that I got to know about my interest in skincare and turn it into a hobby  the only thing that kept me sane, during these stressful times actually.  So, I started applying some masks my mom suggested by mom using ingredients available at home like besan, tomato paste, honey and curd was my constant mask for radiant skin. I made a video out of it and shared on my Instagram (@raji_blah is my Instagram handle. I post some good skincare and hair care tips. I was overwhelmed by the response.  I started researching Pinterest about different DIY recipes and also got a few tips from my grandmother, like homemade kalonji hair oil which my grandmother used to apply for my mom and me when we were young. I have made the oil (using coconut oil, kalonji seeds, castor oil and Fenugreek seeds powder) and shared the recipe on my Instagram too:)  I was surprised how good my hair felt. Also many people liked it when I posted about it. I also got some ideas from a YouTube channel called Little DIY. I have made DIYs for undereye cream using potato and cucumber juice and a lip scrub using ground coffee, cinnamon powder, and vaseline. All these have worked well for me.  One of the DIYs I have tried was making home made coloured lip balm using beetroot juice and ghee which was good and repaired my lips.  And also, I have set a routine for myself by understanding my skins needs and started bygetting inspired from the skin routine of the Koreans. I have been following their routine morning and night like double cleansing, using Vitamin C serum and snail mucin essence (did a lot of research about these products before buying it) and I am happy how my skin turned out. I have been showcasing my journey on Instagram too. Lockdown has made me creative in a very good way and spared me some time for personal care:) Also, all the skincare products I have been using are cruelty-free and few are indian brands.

In an order, the Uddhav Thackeray government said it would allow all departments to sanction new development works permissible under the Local Area Development fund allocated to legislators.  In another development, at least 40 doctors who had come to Mumbai from Kerala on the request of the Maharashtra government are returning to their state as civic body Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has not paid their salaries. Fifteen have already left, and 25 are leaving today. The doctors from Kerala had been tasked with setting up a Covid-19 hospital in the city.  Farmers across Maharashtra say they are finding it difficult to offload their produce with the latest lockdown restrictions in Pune, Mumbai, Thane and Aurangabad. To stop the surge in Covid-19 cases, many municipal corporations and their neighbouring rural administrations have decided to impose a lockdown of 10-15 days.  The first phase of the lockdown will be exceptionally strict, with only milk and medical shops allowed to operate  in contrast to previous lockdowns when supply of vegetables was allowed.

Jagdish Apshunde, director trader of Nashiks wholesale market, said that the price of most vegetables is between Rs 10 and 15 per kg.  The daily increase in Covid-19 case in Nashik has also prompted local traders to avoid the market. Punes market has suddenly closed so we are facing the problem of plenty, he said. Apshunde and other traders said the lockdown should have exempted the supply of vegetables.  For vegetable growers in and around Pune, the closure of the weekly farmers markets comes at a time when crops were ready for harvest. Narendra Pawar, director of Swami Samarath Farmers Producer Company (FPC), said most farmers are dumping their produce on the fields. Pointing to the unruly crowds that thronged the markets last Sunday, ahead of the start of lockdown, Pawar said, Social distancing norms were ignored as people jostled to get their shopping done.

In potatoes, the current price increase is mainly due to lower production, just as it was vis--vis onions last year.  If last year it was pyaaz, this year it is aloo and now tamatar that are turning dearer, even as annual consumer price index (CPI) inflation, at 6.09% in June, crossed the Reserve Bank of Indias 4-6% upper target range.  On Friday, all-India retail prices of potato and tomato, according to the Department of Consumer Affairs data, averaged Rs 30 and Rs 50 per kg, respectively, up from Rs 20 each three months ago. The same period saw onion prices dip from Rs 30 to Rs 20 per kg.  This trend is also confirmed by information on the average sale price (ASP) for the three key staple vegetables made available by a leading online grocer to The Indian Express.  The ASP of onion charged by this retailer in the National Capital Region has fallen steadily from nearly Rs 78 per kg in January to Rs 36 in March, Rs 22.5 in May and Rs 20 during the current month. On the other hand, the ASP for potato has more than doubled to Rs 31/kg since February, while displaying extreme volatility in tomato  from Rs 30/kg in January to Rs 22 in March and Rs 14 in May, before surging to Rs 57 this month (see chart).  In potatoes, the current price increase is mainly due to lower production, just as it was vis--vis onions last year. Farmers in major potato-growing states such as Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal deposit the bulk of their produce harvested in January-March in cold stores for staggered sales till October-November, when planting for the next season begins. Only an estimated 36 crore bags (of 50 kg each) from the main rabi crop of 2019-20 were stocked in cold stores this time, as against 48 crore, 46 crore and 57 crore bags in the preceding three years. Farmers basically planted less in response to the low realisations since 2017.  Regular table potato or mota aloo is now being sold from cold stores in UP at Rs 19-20 per kg. If there was no demand drop from lockdown, the rates would have touched Rs 23-24/kg. They had actually gone down to Rs 15-16 in May, before recovering to the present levels, says Doongar Singh Chaudhary, a farmer-cum-cold store owner in Khandauli village of Agra districts Etmadpur tehsil.  The lockdown had led to the closure of hotels and restaurants, apart from consumption of potato-based snacks  from samosa, aloo chaat, tikki, and paav bhaji to masala dosa and French Fries  taking a knock. Chaudhary reckons that farmers have sold 25% of their crop kept in cold stores and will use another 15% as seed for the coming season. They still have 60% that can be gradually offloaded. It is the cold stores that have saved them from distress sales during lockdown, unlike for tomato, cucumber and other seasonal vegetables, he adds.  Our production cost is Rs 9-10 per kg. Adding cold store, grading and other charges, plus moisture loss, takes it to Rs 13-14. This is the first time in four years we are making some money. It would have more but for the lockdown, claims Mohammad Alamgir, general secretary of Agras Potato Growers Association.  In tomato, the story is different.  In May, prices in key wholesale markets such as Kolar (Karnataka), Madanapalle (Andhra Pradesh), Narayangaon and Sangamner (Maharashtra) had crashed to Rs 3-5 per kg. That was the peak arrival time for the summer tomato crop, transplanted in January-March and harvested from end-April till July. Farmers, who invest a lot in this crop hoping for better price realisations during the summer months, had to sell for a song.  The current price increase started from around the last week of June, with the tapering of supplies from the summer crop. Although such tapering is normal, it was aggravated by the earlier low prices that resulted in farmers not applying fertilisers or maintaining their crop after the first few pickings.  Tomato prices could, however, ease once the just-planted kharif crop arrives in the market. This crop, whose transplantation stretches from mid-June till end-September, has a shorter duration of 90-100 days, compared to 130-150 days for the summer tomatoes. Since it also starts yielding fruits 60-70 days after transplanting (tomato pickings happen at intervals of 3-4 days), consumers can expect some relief after mid-August.  Kharif acreage has been 50% less so far, but high prices should induce a pick-up in plantings, points out a seed industry executive. In potatoes, too, the kharif crop in Karnataka and Maharashtra will arrive from August and after November in Punjab. But it is very small relative to the main rabi crop.  Volatile vegetable prices will also make it challenging for the RBI to further slash interest rates in order to bring back growth and investments in a sagging economy.",TOMATO

As we grow older, the skin loses collagen and elastin, two proteins found in our skin which leads to the skin under our eyes getting wrinkles and dry, mentioned Pooja Nagdev, cosmetologist and aromatherapist, Inatur, Ayurveda and Aromatherapy. Which is why, it is essential to protect the skin under the eyes from UVA, UVB and blue rays.  There are many factors that can lead to the blood vessels under eyes becoming inflamed leading to dark under eye circles, such as over exposure to sun rays or blue rays, ageing, or even genetics. The best way to take care of under eye circles is to follow a routine.  What can be done?  *Apply a good sun protection cream every morning to prevent skin ageing.  *Keep the area under the eyes moisturised and hydrated without weighing it down with heavy creams.  *To prevent the blood from accumulating under the eyes as it leads to darker under eye colour, it essential to tap massage lightly with fingers twice in a day.

They are open every day, 24 hours a day.A sign in English and Spanish says ""Free food.""""If you need to empty the fridge, no one will judge you. If you need to take one tomato, or you only put one tomato in there, do it,"" said Marina Vergara, an organizer for LA Community Fridges, which has set up seven of the appliances and has plans for more.""I thought the concept of having these community fridges up in neighborhoods all around the city would make, you know, just this kind of aid more accessible,"" said Vergara.The idea was inspired by a similar initiative in New York. Whoever needs food takes it, and those who can donate, do so, putting items in the fridge at any time of day or night.The appliances are painted colorfully and bear upbeat messages, and beside them are boxes with non-perishables such as canned goods. Some people even leave shoes and clothing.""This fridge belongs to you & everything inside,"" says a sign on a refrigerator in Mid City, which like many parts of Los Angeles is a mix of modern houses and condos spawned by gentrification and older, more modest homes.Restaurants, supermarkets, NGOs and neighbors chip in to keep the fridges filled.""It's been overwhelming. It has been nothing but love,"" said Danny Dierich, manager of a cafe called Little Amsterdam , which provides the electricity for a fridge right outside.""People come by every single day. They put goods in the fridge, they bring stuff in. It's just a beautiful thing, man,"" he told AFP.""We're living in a very unusual time you know. Businesses have been shut down, people losing their job,"" he said. ""People got to feed their families."" California was one of the first states to impose lockdown orders and was a model for handling the virus outbreak, but now it has again closed parts of its huge economy because of a surge in infections, mainly in Los Angeles county.Business has halted for bars, barber shops, indoor restaurants and others, a move that will increase unemployment in the county, which was a staggering 21 percent at the end of May.Local authorities, NGOs, churches and schools have opened up food banks and soup kitchens for those most affected.Vergara, who started the fridge project with an organization called Reach for the Top, which helps the homeless, said there are immigrants without papers who are afraid to go to food banks for fear of being detained and deported. Others are simply too ashamed to tap those resources.""I think that there's definitely a negative connotation with standing in a line seeking support and aid from a nonprofit or the government,"" said Vergara.""In a lot of communities, it strips away your pride,"" she said.Her efforts give people ""the freedom of being able to go to a community fridge at any time, whether it's five in the morning or five in the evening.""",TOMATO

I pulled it out, recalling that it was a part of a series by Lawrence Sanders that had given me great pleasure once upon a time. The books were about simple mysteries solved by a character called Archy McNally. What had me totally gripped, though, was the description of sandwiches that McNally periodically created in his kitchen.  The thought of the sandwiches opened up the floodgates of sandwich memories. Whenever I think of sandwiches, I first think of Novelty Dairy and Store, as it is formally called, though aficionados also know it as Hawkers House. It is at the corner of Birbal Road in Jangpura (phone: 011-43584168). The shop has been around since 1951, and I first tasted their sandwiches more than 25 years ago; I have been a die-hard fan ever since. I looked up the Net to see if they were delivering their sandwiches, and, to my utter joy, I found that they were, and in my neck of the woods, too.  So our dinner one night consisted of sandwiches that came from Hawkers House. We asked for three plates of chicken sandwiches in white bread (100 for a packet of four triangles), chicken burger (130), tuna sandwich in brown bread (130), and sugar-free cold coffee (150).  The sandwiches were deliciously soft, and the stuffing, as always, was moist and tasty. They use a layer of a special mayo, and then fill it with sliced chicken, chicken salami, or mashed tuna. This is served with a tart green chutney and tomato ketchup. We tried out their chicken burger, too  a thick chicken patty flanked by onion and tomatoes nestled in the largish bun. The bun was soft, the patty crisp  and the two complemented each other well. I found it a bit salty though.  The delivery menu also includes mutton burger (130) and mutton burger with cheese (150). There are other kinds of sandwiches, too: chicken toasted in brown bread (120), vegetable sandwiches (90), cheese sandwich (100), pork ham sandwich (100) and tuna in white bread (120).  The normal cold coffee (much loved at home) costs 90. They also deliver omelettes: the chicken cheese omelette with two slices of bread costs 130.  Shanti Swarup ji, who ran the store, is no more, but his son and family have ensured that the standards are still high. The mayo that is added to the sandwiches is spiced up in the kitchen, and the chutney is prepared with fresh coriander leaves, onion, garlic and a bit of mint.  A family member tells me a strict hygiene protocol is being maintained  the staff is tested for body temperature every day and they have a sanitizing machine.  I finished the last crumbs of the chicken sandwich and thought fondly of Archy McNally. Time I pulled out the other Lawrence Sanders.  The writer is a seasoned food critic",TOMATO

Retail potato prices going up, from roughly Rs 20 to Rs 30 per kg in the last three months, shouldnt surprise.  A spurt in vegetable prices, especially of tomatoes and potatoes, raises questions not only on the Reserve Bank of Indias (RBI) headroom for further interest rate cuts, but even for continuing with its accommodative monetary policy stance to revive growth and investment in the economy. This is even more so with consumer price inflation, at 6.09 per cent in June, already crossing the central banks 6 per cent lakshman rekha and the pass-through effects of the Rs 11-12/litre increase in diesel prices since last month still to be felt. Vegetables turning dearer can significantly influence household inflation expectations that are also a key metric factored in by the RBIs monetary policy committee. In its last May 22 meeting, the committee had taken note of the unusual spike in food inflation in April, which it expected to moderate on the back of a normal monsoon.  Retail potato prices going up, from roughly Rs 20 to Rs 30 per kg in the last three months, shouldnt surprise. The main rabi crop, which farmers harvest in January-March and mainly keep in cold stores for making staggered sales till October-November, has been an estimated 25 per cent lower this time. The reason: Poor price realisations for the last three seasons (2016-17 to 2018-19), leading farmers to sow less in 2019-20. Given the production shortfall, the current prices are actually reasonable. The potato story is similar to onions last year. Then, too, it was the price crash from a bumper 2017-18 crop that made farmers reduce plantings the following year. Aloo prices would have gone the pyaaz way, but for the lockdown-induced shutdown of eateries and dip in consumption of potato-based snacks from samosas to french fries. More than potatoes, the rise in tomato prices  from Rs 20 to Rs 50 per kg within hardly two months  is striking. The fact that growers were getting Rs 3-5/kg for their produce in May, while even dumping them on roads, should not be lost on consumers. Nor the fact that onions are retailing today at around Rs 20, as against Rs 90-100 at the years start.  The real takeaway on vegetables is the need for not just investing in cold stores. Neither these nor in-field kanda chawl storage structures have reduced price volatility in potatoes and onions. What is necessary  especially when India has moved from being a structurally deficit to surplus producer  is crop area planning. Farmers should have access to credible forecasts of opening stocks, domestic consumption and export demand for all crops to enable them to make the right planting decisions. This is a job an agency like the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices should be entrusted with. Wild price and acreage swings ultimately benefit no one  whether farmers, consumers, processors or policymakers.",TOMATO

The tomato price began soaring as the local produce from markets like Madanapalle has come down. While the tomato price at rythu bazars was around 50 a kg during the last week, it was sold at not less than 75 in the retail market.  According to information, at rythu bazars in the city, the tomatoes were sold at 43 per kg on Tuesday while in the retail market, the price ranges between 75 and 80 a kg. The rise in tomato price is due to the decrease in the supply. Tomatoes are being supplied to Vijayawada from Karnataka for the last few weeks and the markets have seen a decrease in the supply.  The prices have begun skyrocketing from mid June and peaked on last Saturday and Sunday, which witnessed 50 a kg at rythu bazars. Interestingly, the tomato prices were stable during the lockdown period and in summer, the prices have increased steadily thereafter. The tomatoes were available for less than 20 a kg then.  Owing to shortage of the tomatoes, we are sourcing the supply from Kolar in Karnataka. The supply from the Madanapalle market in Chittoor has stopped. We are now getting the tomatoes from Kolar. About 50 to 60 quintals of tomatoes arrive at Patamata Rythu Bazar from Kolar, says S. Karunakar, Estate Officer at Patamata Rythu Bazar.  The escalating prices are due to less arrival of stocks in the markets. On an average, the PWD Rythu Bazar, which is the biggest bazar in the city, gets 400-600 trays each containing 25 kg everyday. The other rythu bazaars also get supplies from Kolar.  The situation is likely to remain the same for a few more days. Same prices may continue for some more days until the supply is increased, feel vendors.  The supplies from Anantapur are expected in a week or so. The prices will come down to 20 to 25 in that case. Meanwhile, Madanapalle market will also open, which is expected to bring down the prices further, opines the EO.  Transportation cost  The transportation cost of each tray from Kolar will be around 125, while it would be around just 10 in the local market. So, the supplies from Madanapalle and Anantapur will bring down the prices, he explains.",TOMATO

On Tuesday, the average all-India retail price of potatoes stood at Rs 35 a kg, while tomatoes were selling for an average of Rs 55 a kg, up from Rs 20 and Rs 30 on July 1, data from the consumer affairs ministry showed.  Rains and partial or complete lockdown in cities such as Bangalore, Pune, Guwahati and Bhopal to contain the spread of Covid-19, have upended supply chains, causing prices of commonly consumed vegetables to spike manifold. Among kitchen staples, households are paying the highest for potatoes and tomatoes. Onion prices are stable or have fallen in some markets due to higher production last winter, officials in wholesale markets said.  A combination of factors is behind the rising prices, traders said. Farmers in many states dumped perishables during the lockdown, unable to find buyers. So, tomatoes are in short supply. Transportation costs have risen 5-10% because of fuel price hikes by the government, Maruti Mallale, the proprietor of Mahesh Vegetable Company at Maharashtras Vashi said.  At Delhis Azadpur wholesale market, during July 13-19, the average wholesale price of potatoes rose 53.5% from a year ago, the sharpest rise in four years, data from the consumer affairs ministrys Agmarknet tracker showed. During the same period, potato quantity brought for trade dropped 42% in the market. Azadpur is the national capitals biggest hub for vegetable trade and sets benchmark retail prices across the national capital region. During the same period, tomato prices at the Azadpur market rose 33.9% from a year ago, while its arrival fell 37%.  Supply of most of the vegetables has been affected. Arrivals in cold storage have been 30% less, said Anil Chaudhury, an official of Agra Cold Storage Association. This suggests that farmers have grown less potato during 2019-20, he said. Onion prices, on the other hand, have declined. Average prices of onions in the Azadpur market fell 20.9% in the July 13-19 week.  SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON",TOMATO

Taking note of this, Chandigarh Residents Association Welfare Federation (CRAWFED) has written to the UT administration asking to penalise those found guilty of overcharging. CRAWFED chairman Hitesh Puri said, Even though the market committee is releasing the list on a daily basis, vendors were selling items at a much higher price as compared with the capped price. Around two to three vendors per sector were designated by the municipal corporation (MC) who said that they provide a better quality of vegetables and thats why they overcharge. He said that he has to pay about 10 extra as per the pre-approved rates.  General secretary of Sector 19C resident welfare association (RWA) Yashpal Kapoor said, Vendors are fleecing residents of our area. They are selling items two times more than the price fixed by the UT market committee. Some vendors said that they are overcharging as earlier CTU buses would transport vegetables and now they have to do it spending money from their pocket.  For example, some vendors were selling tomato for 60 per kg. The wholesale price for tomato is 32-36 per kg, while the fixed price is 50 per kg. Cauliflower was being sold at 55 per kg by vendors, against its fixed price of 40 per kg.  Speaking about wholesale prices, Rashwinder Singh who works as the auction recorder at the wholesale market said that wholesale prices had gone down, and spells of rain in Punjab had left prices unaffected. These days a lot of our vegetables including potatoes, tomatoes, cauliflower, etc are coming from Himachal Pradesh. The supply chain has improved after the lockdown so prices are on the lower side.  Officials of the market committee said that while prices are fixed, ensuring that vendors follow the rate list was the MCs duty and demanded the civic body inspectors to challan those who overcharge customers.  Vendors flouting Covid norms  Many residents are also claiming that vegetable vendors are flouting social distancing rules, and not wearing masks properly even as Covid-19 cases in the city has touched 800-mark. Federation of Sector Welfare Associations Chandigarh (FOSWAC) secretary Ranvinder Singh Gill said, In the northern sectors there are only a few houses yet so many vegetable vendors pass through our house. They can be seen without masks. The police need to take action against such vendors.

Garnish cheese balls with a sprig of basil leaves and serve immediately with tomato salsa or any dip of your choice.  Author tweets @srinidhi_gk  For more stories follow Facebook and Twitter",TOMATO

Choose from a variety of fruits and vegetables to get your daily dose of vitamin C. Plus, some interesting recipes to help you along!  Say Vitamin C and you almost immediately think of oranges and lemons. But did you know that a single red guava has over 200 mg of the nutrient in 100 grams, which is almost over thrice as that in an orange. You get just about 64 mg from 100 gm of orange and 48 mg from 100 ml of lime juice according to the Indian Food Composition Tables.  Vitamin C, also called ascorbic acid, is a water soluble vitamin that helps to improve immunity, aids in the synthesis of collagen (skin protein), and production of certain neurotransmitters (the bodys chemical messengers). It is not stored in the body and requires daily intake, says Bengaluru-based Dharshini Surendran, dietician.  Guava | Photo Credit: Sreejith R Kumar  While 100 gm of gooseberry provides 247 mg, others like bell peppers (yellow, red, green: 120 mg), bitter gourd (50 mg), and raw mango (50 mg), can also provide the vitamin. Though its not possible to eat 100 gm of chillies, its good to know that they contain 90 mg of the vitamin.  The daily Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) of Vitamin C for adults is 65 to 90 mg per day. We need Vitamin C to help in the absorption of iron from food, says Gayathri V, a dietician based in Kochi. A balanced diet, for example dosa or idli and sambar with seasonal vegetables for breakfast; a lunch platter of rice, green vegetables, and dal; a guava or papaya for dessert, ensures that you not only get Vitamin C, but also carbs, proteins, and fats.  Green pepper / capsicum | Photo Credit: Sreejith R Kumar  Avoid caffeine as it inhibits Vitamin C absorption, stay hydrated, and cut down on meat, especially after you consume Vitamin C rich foods, advises Pradeepa Saravanan, dietician based in Coimbatore.Include at least one serving of fresh fruits and vegetables per day in your diet. For example, a papaya salad with pomegranate, bell peppers, or banana. Vitamin C evaporates when exposed to heat, thats why I recommend consuming 500 mg every day, not just during the pandemic but for life, to make up for the nutrient loss while cooking.  One way of starting your day with a Vitamin C shot is to churn either three or four amla (gooseberries) or half a bitter gourd in the mixie with a handful of coconut bits and a jaggery to taste (nothing over a tablespoon). Mix with a little water, strain, and drink on an empty stomach.  Here are a few recipes, courtesy Dharshini Surendran, to help up Vitamin C levels:  Capsicum thokku  You can add diced capsicum to pasta or salad, or try this pickled version.  Green pepper / capsicum | Photo Credit: Sreejith R Kumar  Ingredients:  2 capsicum ( any colour diced into pieces)  1 tomato  1 onion  1 tsp tamarind pulp  1 tsp urad dal  1 tsp coriander seeds  1 tsp jeera  3 red chillies  Himalayan Pink Salt to taste  Method:  In a pan, dry roast the coriander seeds, urad dal, jeera and red chilli. Add the chopped onion, tomato and saute it well. Add the sauted onion, tomato, and dry roasted mix in a mixie jar and grind well. Add tamarind pulp.Finally add the salt as per taste and capsicum pieces and grind once again into a fine paste. This can be eaten along with rice, roti or dosa.  Sweet potato balls  Ingredients:  Sweet potatoes | Photo Credit: Sreejith R Kumar  2 sweet potatoes (boiled)  2 handful of green gram sprouts  1/2 handful of grated raw mango  1/2 handful of grated carrot  1 onion finely chopped  2 tsp pepper powder  Salt as per taste  Method:  Peel the skin of sweet potato and mash it well. Add the green gram sprouts, carrot, raw mango, onion and mix well. Finally add salt and pepper and make into balls. As the potatoes are already boiled, it can be had directly. No need to bake.  Orange Rasam  Store green chillies in a cool, dark area, because chillies lose their Vitamin C when exposed to heat, light, and air.  Oranges | Photo Credit: Sreejith R Kumar  Ingredients:  1 cup orange juice  1 tbsp moong dal (soaked and boiled)  Chopped coriander leaves (for garnish)  1 tsp lemon juice  1 orange rind (grated)  3 slit green chillies  A few curry leaves  1 tsp mustard seeds  1/2 tsp asafoetida  Himalayan pink salt as per taste  1 tsp of cold pressed sesame oil cold pressed  1tsp rasam powder (optional)  Method:  In a pan, add 1 tsp sesame oil and season it with mustard seeds, asafoetida, and curry leaves. Saut it well. Add the boiled moong dal and mix well. Add the salt and mix well and if required add rasam powder. Finally add the orange juice and rind.

Having seen some videos on how vegetables and fruits are transported without the use of gloves, etc, I wasnt sure about staying safe in the pandemic by eating vegetables that are just washed with water... especially the ones that we eat raw, like tomato and cucumber in salad, says Rita Sherpa, a Gurugram resident.  A new fad in the coronavirus world seems to be the obsession with sanitising vegetables. A number of people have, of late, had inhibitions about vegetables being a possible carrier of the virus. And this has led to an increase in the sale of vegetable washers, cleaners, sanitisers and even disinfectant sprays!  Affirming an increase in the sale of vegetable cleaners, Delhi-based Vidit Arora, owner, Rickul International Private Limited  a manufacturer of vegetable disinfectant sprays  says, We have seen a growth in the sales of our vegetable washers by over 45% and its only increasing. I think people are buying such vegetable washers because they want to keep their family safe in these times, without using any solution with toxic ingredients on perishable items that are bought for consumption. These are very uncertain times, and no one knows how the vegetables have been handled before they reach us. So, for the sake of health of our family and loved ones, people are opting for vegetable washers just like many have moved to using sanitizers and surface disinfectants.  Some organic vegetable cleaning sprays are also catching the fancy of those who are not satisfied with washing veggies under tap water. (Photo: Shutterstock)  Stores in Delhi-NCR that sell kitchenware or electronics are also recording a high demand for such vegetable cleaners. Shikhar Chawla, owner of one such store in Chakkarpur, Gurugram says, We recently stocked up on vegetable cleaners, sprays and disinfectants because of an increase in their demand. After all, we have to keep up with the trend in the market! Along with masks for personal use, the demand for vegetable cleaners and sanitisers is also at an all-time high due to the pandemic. So we have stocked up on these, and even vegetable disinfectants. People want to invest in these things to keep their families secure; and to me its an intelligent investment because for the time being its like investing in good health.  I recently bought an organic vegetable cleaning spray. If nothing else, it has mentally assured me that Im doing something to protect my familys well-being,  - Nikita Bhatia, a Gurugrammer  According to online trends, city residents have been readily Googling terms such as vegetable disinfectants. I cant believe how much my shopping pattern has changed. There was a time I used to browse delivery sites for clothes. However, now I keep checking out vegetable cleaners, sanitisers and sprays.

Most of the markets in the city saw a handful of vendors selling old stock at a premium rate. Majority of grocery shops remained shut due to supply shortage. It did not feel like a Sunday market at all.Some vegetables like tomato and drumsticks (sajne data) touched Rs 100 a kg. Brinjal soared to Rs 80 a kg. Green chillies, particularly the Beldanga variety, were sold at Rs 200 a kg. It is mainly due to semi-functional wholesale markets and non-functional haats in the rural Bengal from where wholesale markets source their items for trade.Because of weekend disruptions in the supply chain, a large number of vendors preferred to skip business on Sunday and those, who were there, tried to sell old stocks in a bid to clear what they had carried forward from Friday. The price, however, remained very high and vendors said that fresh stocks were due to arrive in the markets on Monday.Vendors have also prepared a procurement routine to adjust to the staggered lockdown regimen that the state is adopting. Not only vegetables, buyers were also upset about the quality and variety of fish available on a Sunday. At Lake Market, where the demand for tiger prawns soars on Sundays, the availability was poor. Retailers complained that supplies were not coming in from North 24 Parganas and Midnapore.Only the small variety of prawns were available and sold at Rs 350-400 a kg, up from the usual Rs 270 a kg. Most buyers had to buy rohu and katla at a steep price. Can you imagine a Sunday market where sellers are sitting with such a little variety? I wanted to buy pomphret, but most sellers didnt have it. Those who did, had a few pieces of the bigger variety left that were sold at Rs 750 a kg, up by nearly Rs 100,, rued Chaitali Bagchi, a retired banker who lives on Fern Road. In case of rohu and katla, the prices were up by at least Rs 80-Rs 100 a kilo.The availability of hilsa was another sore point across markets. Its the height of monsoons and you are still getting the 500-600 gram varieties that are selling at Rs 900 a kg, said Sandip Banerjee, a liaison executive with a real estate brand, who lives on Harish Mukherjee Road.People complained about the unavailability of Chandramukhi variety of potatoes on Sunday. The Jyoti variety too was sold at Rs 30 a kg.Most fruit sellers had vanished from the markets on Sunday. The staggered lockdown has affected movement of truckloads of fruits because they are being stopped at various locations.

Also known as Eid Qurban or Qurban Bayarami, this festival is meant to honour the sacrifice of Ibrahim for his God. The history of this day was marked when Ibrahim kept having a recurring dream of himself slaughtering his son, Ismael, to fulfil the wishes of God.  Every year on Eid al-Adha, the food prepared is split into three parts, where one part is consumed by the family, the second goes to the relatives and the third to the people in need. A lot of love and hard work goes into the preparation of all the dishes that are cooked for the feast and practically no expense is spared in the celebration of this festival. Since mutton is the main attraction of this special occasion, the fragrant aroma of biryani is the first thing that comes to mind when thinking of a feast.  ALSO READ: Eid al-Adha 2020: History and significance of Bakrid, and date of celebration in India  Here are some traditional and some unconventional recipes that you can try on this Bakrid, even as we continue to safely social distance at home amid the pandemic:  MUTTON DUM BIRYANI  Ingredients   8 Onions, thinly sliced   1/4 cup Ginger, chopped   1/4 cup Garlic, cloves   7 Green Chillies  For the rice   1 Bay leaves (tej patta), torn   2 Cardamom (Elaichi) Pods/Seeds   1-inch Cinnamon stick   3 Cloves (Laung)   2 cups Basmati rice, washed and soaked for 30 minutes   Salt, to taste  Ingredients to marinate   500 grams Mutton, curry cut   1 cup Hung Curd (Greek Yogurt)   1 tablespoon Ginger Garlic Paste   1 teaspoon Red Chilli powder   1/2 teaspoon Turmeric powder (Haldi)   1 teaspoon Garam masala powder   Salt, to taste  Other Ingredients   2 Bay leaves (tej patta)   2-inch Cinnamon Stick (Dalchini)   4 Cloves (Laung)   1 Mace (Javitri)   4 Dagad phool (/pathar phool/black stone flower)   1 teaspoon Red Chilli powder   1/4 teaspoon Garam masala powder   2 Tomatoes, finely chopped   1/2 cup Mint Leaves (Pudina), chopped   Salt, to taste   1/2 cup Milk   Saffron strands   4 tablespoons Sunflower Oil   4 Ghee   2 cups Whole Wheat Flour, for sealing the vessel  Instructions   To begin making the Mutton Dum Biryani Recipe, first we will make a paste of the ginger, garlic and green chillies.   Into a mixer grinder add the chopped ginger, garlic cloves and green chillies. Blend to make a paste and keep aside.   Wash mutton thoroughly. Add the washed mutton into a mixing bowl and add the yogurt, 1 tablespoon of the ginger garlic and chilli paste, red chilli powder, turmeric powder, garam masala and salt to taste. Cover and place the mutton in the refrigerator and marinate it for at least 4 hours.   Into a preheated pan add oil and the sliced onions. Saut the onions on low to medium heat until caramelized. This process takes time so be patient so as to get the perfect golden-brown caramelized onions.   If you brown the onions on high heat, then the onions will not caramelize evenly.   Once done, keep 1/2 the portion of the caramelized onions for the biryani masala and 1/2 portion for garnishing the Mutton Dum Biryani.   The next step is to cook the rice until it is 3/4th done.   Into a saucepan add 4 cups of water, the bay leaf, cardamom pods, cinnamon stick, cloves, salt to taste and the washed basmati rice. Allow the rice to boil in the water for 3 to 4 minutes.   Power cook the rice until 3/4th done. Once done drain the water from the rice, add a tablespoon of ghee to the rice and mix gently. Cover & keep aside.   Next, make the saffron milk; dissolve the saffron strands in warm milk and keep aside.   Next is to make the dough to seal the bowl for dum cooking. Into a bowl add the wheat flour and add water to make a firm dough. Cover and keep aside.  Method   Into a large biryani pan add 2 tablespoons of ghee. Once the ghee is hot, add bay leaves, cinnamon stick, cloves, mace, pathar ka phool and saut for a few seconds until the aromas come through.   Once done add the rest of the ginger garlic and chilli paste and saut for a minute. Now add the red chilli powder, garam masala and saut it in the onion garlic paste until the raw smell goes away.   Add the chopped tomatoes, salt to taste and saut until the tomatoes become soft and mushy.   Once the tomatoes are soft add the caramelized onions and stir well to combine.   Add the marinated mutton, the chopped mint leaves and stir for 2 to 3 minutes. Add 1/2 cup of water and cover with a lid. Reduce the heat and simmer and cook mutton for 40 minutes until the mutton is cooked and the gravy becomes thick.   Once done add the 3/4th cooked rice on top of the mutton gravy. Spread the rice evenly over the gravy. Drizzle the saffron milk over the rice and add some caramelized onions. Keep a tablespoon of caramelized onions aside for final garnish.   Finally, a small bunch of chopped mint leaves. Turn the heat to low. Cover the pan and seal the lid with the atta dough.   Cook on low heat for 15 minutes and turn off the heat. Allow the Mutton Dum Biryani to rest for 10 minutes before opening the pot.   Cut the atta dough and remove the dough. Open the pot and mix the Mutton Dum Biryani gently and transfer into a serving bowl. Garnish with the remaining caramelized onions and serve.  -- Recipe by Archanas Kitchen  VEGAN BIRYANI  Ingredients   1 cup basmati rice   3 tablespoons olive oil, divided   1/4 cup chopped pistachios   1 teaspoon turmeric   1 teaspoon cumin seeds, divided   2 teaspoons coriander seeds   1 star anise   8 cardamom pods   1 cinnamon stick   1 3/4 cup water   1 teaspoon salt, divided   1 onion, chopped   2 tablespoons minced fresh ginger   2 cloves garlic, minced   1/4 cup golden raisins   1 cup chopped fresh green beans   2 cups chopped cauliflower florets   1 yukon gold potato, small chop   1 cup frozen peas   1 carrot, small chop   2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice  Instructions   Rinse the rice in a bowl or sieve.

The supply of these perishables from Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and other states have been affected due to lesser frequency of trains amid the coronavirus outbreak. Transportation costs have also risen causing price rise, they said.  ""The rates are not fluctuating much in wholesale markets because demand is limited due to the pandemic, but retail prices of green vegetables and tomatoes are high due to various reasons,"" said an Azadpur Mandi trader Rajnish.  In local wholesale market, potato was available at Rs 8-28 per kg, onion at Rs 6.50-13.50 per kg, cabbage at Rs 4-12 per kg, gourd at Rs 6-18 per kg, tomato at Rs 8-44 per kg, and brinjal Rs 8-26 per kg. However, retail prices of tomato ranged from Rs 60-80 per kg and most of green vegetables were sold at Rs 40-60 per kg at various markets in the city.  Azadpur Mandi Chairman Adil Ahmad Khan said there was ""slight rise"" in vegetable prices due to seasonal factors. ""This is overlapping period when old stocks are spent and new arrivals reach the Mandi. So, there is slight increase but the overall rates are lower as compared to last year,"" he said.  The effect of rains on crops is also responsible for the rise in prices which again is a seasonal factor, he added.Vegetable vendors said that prices were high because their costs had increased.Due to the pandemic, costs of transportation have increased leading to increase in vegetable prices, said another retailer.  Post-lockdown hike  According to traders, prices of vegetables were under control during lockdown because supply and demand were balanced but as demand is improving, a surge in price is being witnessed  (With PTI inputs)",TOMATO

(Representational)  Two days after The Indian Express reported about how students travel miles to access a smart phone to avail education in a remote village of Morni, people came forward to offer smart phones to those in need.  Robin Hood Army, an NGO, came forward to provide smart phones to students in need of them. We read the article regarding children being deprived of education due to lack of handsets. We would like to help the kids in the mentioned article with smart phones so that they are not deprived of education and are able to tide over this crisis with their education not getting impacted.

Add 2 tbsp besan or gram flour, a pinch of baking soda and  tsp turmeric powder.  Mix all the above dry ingredients with a spoon or spatula.  Then add water. The amount of water to be added depends on the quality of flour used. I added 1 cup water. Depending on the quality of flour and besan, you can add from  to 1 cup water.  With the spatula or spoon, first mix. Break the small or tiny lumps with the spatula or spoon while mixing.  Then in round circular directions stir the batter briskly for 4 minutes. This adds volume to the batter and makes it even and smooth.  The batter should have a flowing consistency. Cover and keep the batter to ferment in a warm place for 12 to 15 hours. I kept for 15 hours. If you live in a cold climate, you can keep for 20 to 24 hours.  This is how the batter looks the next day. You will see small bubbles on the top.  Stir the batter and if you carefully see, the batter would have become thinner than what it was before fermentation.  So to thicken the batter again, add 1 to 2 tbsp of all purpose flour.  With a spoon mix very well.  Now pour this batter in the squeezy tomato ketchup bottles that we get in the market. You can also use coconut shell and make a small hole in it. You can also use a piping bag or make your own with butter paper. Depending on the capacity of the bottle, you can pour less or more in it.  Preparing sugar syrup  Take 1 cup sugar in a pan. Add 1/4 tsp saffron strands to it. Do add saffron as it gives a nice orange yellow color and also its aroma to the jalebis.  Add 1/2 cup water.  Keep this pan on stove top on low flame and begin to stir, so that the sugar dissolves.  On a low to medium flame, cook the sugar syrup.  Cook till you get one string consistency in the sugar syrup.  Once you get the one string consistency, switch off the flame and add 1/4 tsp lime or lemon juice. Stir well. Keep the sugar syrup on the burner itself so that it remains warm when you add the jalebis in it.  Frying jalebi  Heat oil for deep frying in a kadai or pan. You can also use ghee or half-half of oil and ghee. Ghee gives a better flavour.  To check the temperature of oil, add a tiny amount of batter to the oil. If it comes up quickly and gradually the oil is hot enough for the jalebis to be fried. The frying temperature is 350 degrees fahrenheit/176 degrees celsius.  Now squeeze the bottle and make concentric rings with the batter.  Either start from the center and move outside or vice versa. Be careful while making the jalebis as the oil is hot.  You wont get perfect shapes as the jalebis keep on moving while you make the circles. This does require practice and it also depends on what equipment you are using to make them.  When one side is partly cooked, turn over and fry the other side.  Some jalebis will be cooked faster than others.  Fry till the oil stops sizzling and the jalebis are a light golden. Remove with a tongs or a bamboo skewer. While removing shake to drain the extra oil.  Adding fried jalebi to sugar syrup  Then immediately put the fried jalebis in the sugar syrup. The sugar syrup should be slightly hot or warm when you add the jalebis in it.  Turn over after after a minute so that both sides are coated with the syrup.  Keep them in the syrup for about 2 to 3 minutes. If you keep for two minutes, they will be lightly colored and if you keep for 3 minutes, they will have a deep color.  Remove with a wooden skewer or tongs. Shake lightly so that the excess sugar syrup falls back in the pan. Place them in a plate or tray lined with a foil or butter paper.  Make all jalebi this way. Its better to have a help while doing so. Otherwise it is kind of multi-tasking.  Serve jalebi hot, warm or at room temperature. The leftovers can be kept in an airtight container and refrigerated.

One day, he informed me with some glee, hed visited Wengers in Connaught Place, and had eaten all kinds of goodies from there. I was instantly green with envy and quickly checked to see if they would deliver in East Delhi. In the next moment I was my golden sunny self when I learnt that they did indeed.  This has to be said out aloud from rooftops: Wengers is the best. I have had delicious patties and pastries from elsewhere, but few can outdo the magic that this old bakery wields. I also have nostalgic links with Wengers. In the early 60s, when I was a wee lad, my mother would occasionally take me there. Sometimes we sat in its restaurant that was right above and where they served Chinese and Continental fare (it later became the American Express office). Those days there were three places that we used to go to: Wengers, Tea House and Nanking (I remember its cutlets and even the face of a server). The last two downed their shutters long years ago. Thankfully, Wengers carries on.  So, the moment I found that I could get some of my favourite snacks delivered from there, I placed an order online (Wengers.in/store). Two of our all-time favourites had to be there, of course. So I asked for chicken patties (80) and mutton shammi kebabs (80). Then we thought wed have a chicken quiche, a ham and pineapple pizza, and a mushroom and cheese pizza. I also asked for a loaf of sundried tomato bread (70). With a stiff upper lip, I didnt look at the dessert section. One must keep a stern eye on ones health. All told, the bill, including shipping and processing fees, came to 1,006, and served as three happy meals.  The food arrived on the designated day, at the designated time. The pizzas, kebabs and quiche were our dinner; the bread (with a chicken paste from Licious) was our breakfast the next day, and we had the patties with tea. Wengers pizzas are special: They are not thick or flour-laden, like some of the mass produced ones. A little smaller than the MNC fare, they are also a lot cheaper. The ham-and-pineapple pizza costs 150, and the mushroom one is at 130. The crust is thin yet substantial, and the toppings are superb.  I couldnt get to taste the ham in the ham and pineapple pizza (if they were there, they were camouflaged well), but the pineapple had melted into the cheese, and the sweet and salty flavours together did a glorious act. The mushroom pizza was oozing with toppings, and two pizzas and a kebab each were enough for the three of us. The kebabs were the way I remembered them: thick and juicy.  The quiche was a pleasant surprise. I had thought it would be large enough for three, but it was just right for one. It was outstanding though, with juicy bits of chicken embedded in the creamy bed and a crunchy crust. The bread was fresh and pitted with sundried tomatoes and olives. And the patties were buttery and flaky, as they are meant to be. The shredded chicken stuffing had all the right flavours, too.  I am going back to the site. This time, there will be a quiche for each one of us. And, maybe, if the stiff upper lip uncurls a bit, even an clair or two.  The writer is a seasoned food critic",TOMATO

Actor Anupriya Goenka who is usually travelling and shooting every year during this season is now enjoying the rains. I love the monsoon, they make me poetic, soulful and happy. The sound of water droplets gives me a sense of solace and peace. I have gigantic windows in my house overlooking greenery, so my day starts sitting besides the window with a cup of coffee gazing at the birds and enjoying nature. I have started writing a journal so I do that, I write poetry, sometimes paint and listen to music. This year Im enjoying the rain from the comfort of my house, confesses Goenka who is also taking extra care of her body during the season.  She focuses on eating a lot of vegetables and proteins and keeping her diet low on carbs. It is better to cook vegetables at this point as it is cumbersome to sanitise raw vegetables. If one doesnt like eating sauteed vegetables or salads then a warm cuppa soup can be great, explains Goenka.  Talking about her skincare regime during monsoon, she recommends moisturising twice a day after using a soap-free cleanser. Along with a daily dose of sunscreen. Now that we are at home, one can also apply milk twice a day. Home remedies are great, applying onion juice to the hair and tomato and papaya pulp to the skin will keep skin and hair healthy. However, avoid applying oil because of the humidity,  she adds.  Chronicling Monsoon musings: The weather is inspiring and a great time to start writing a journal. Anupriya lists tips: Start writing morning pages: Make a target of writing a para or 3 pages daily about anything. Something she picked from a book, The artists way morning pages journal by Julia Cameron. Dont make it feel like a pressure. Convert it into a fun activity Dont block your creativity and write about whatever comes to your mind, a thought, a feeling, anything! Once you start writing you dig deeper aspects about yourself and resolve a lot of things within you.",TOMATO
258,258.0,,,2020-08-19,https://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/food/2020/aug/19/the-life-changing-magic-of-chutney-2185236.html,"Neelanjana Singh By  Express News Service  Chutney has an almost magical power to transform an ordinary meal into one that looks enticing, tastes great, and brims with nutrients. The term chutney is derived from the Hindi word chatni, which means to lick.  The traditional Indian thali, be it Gujarati or South Indian, features chutney as an integral part of the fare. A freshly prepared chutney is a delicious blend of flavours that can instantly uplift a bland meal.  Take khichdi, for example, which was traditionally prepared as a remedial dish in case of sickness. A spoonful of fresh chutney swiftly transforms khichdi into a delectable dish. Back in the colonial era, gourmands and chefs were quick to realise the worthiness of chutneys and used it to their advantage extensively.  Come to think of it, its impossible to imagine eating a kebab, tikka or any tandoori item, without a chutney to go with it. Even the dosa and the samosa feel incomplete without their accompaniments.  It is sad to see that in the modern day, we have replaced the indigenous chutneys with their poorer cousins  the store-bought, mass-manufactured spreads, sauces and ketchups.  A reason for this change has been the misplaced notion that hot and spicy foods are detrimental to health. Chutneys also came to be looked upon as an indulgence of sorts, best when avoided.  This, I believe, is the cyclic pattern of popularity that rules the world of food, clothing and almost everything else that we deal with.  The diversity of India can be mapped through the kinds of chutney prepared across the country. In fact, this would make for a delightful school project to help children understand food diversity.  The varying ingredients used to prepare chutneys are usually based on their availability and seasonality. To add a tangy zest to the preparation, some parts of the country use tamarind (imli), while some others use lemon or amchur.  The raw mango takes centre stage in summer, although every household has its unique mango chutney recipe with varying ingredients added in different ratios. Also, many different chutneys around India that are prepared with a tomato base.  The tomato could be raw or cooked. A sweet-and-sour chutney or one that is akin to a salsa where the raw tomato is blended with chillies and onion.  The dose of lycopene that you get with these tomato chutneys is great for the health of your heart, prostate, eyes, skin and more. Coconut chutney is a favourite in the coastal regions, where coconut is found in plenty.  A popular version has a splattering of mustard seeds, green chillies and some dal blended in to provide the good fat, vitamins and minerals. A couple of months ago, I shared the recipe for a curry leaf chutney that I regularly prepare as an accompaniment to my meals.  I was happy to learn that many of you tried it out, enjoyed the taste, and benefited from its high content of Vitamin A & C. The pandemic has reintroduced many herbs and spices into our regular diet, and chutneys are a great way to include all these different foods, textures and flavours into the diet.  The variety is indeed unlimited  a friend of mine specialises in preparing chutneys from a delightful combination of unlikely ingredients such as raw papaya, ginger, dates, tomato and tamarind.  A great way to use the oft-discarded coriander stalks, which are so flavourful and loaded with vitamins, can easily be included in a chutney. The regular intake of well-prepared chutneys and fermented pickles can be a beneficial adjunct to a healthy diet.  NEELANJANA SINGH  Nutrition Therapist & Wellness Consultant",TOMATO

Anthonys organic farm in the heart of Kochi is in varying stages of bearing fruit and harvesting. The 40 cent plotis hemmed in by high-rise apartments  including one under construction. Set in a tangle of concrete and traffic, this is an unlikely spot for farming.  However, the organic farmers lockdown experiment has surprised him, as well as the neighbours, with its success. Anthony did not expect the quantity he is harvesting  around 60 kilograms of vegetables every day from this plot and a combined 100-odd kilograms from another one acre-plus plot  even while on a third, a 17.5 cent plot, saplings and seeds are being planted. Here, baby amaranth plants are just a dark pink stain on plant beds; tomato and other plants have barely sprouted.  Celery, lettuce, bok choy, thyme, oregano, rosemary, green chilli, tomato, ivy gourd, snake gourd, string beans, bitter gourd ...the list of vegetables Anthony has planted and harvested is long. Some, like capsicum and celery have been a surprise as he did not expect them to thrive in the heart of the city. Vegetables are harvested daily and sold at his store, Pure Crop Organic Shop in Kadavanthra, Kochi, which sells organic produce from his other farms as well. Every morning he and his three children, along with two farm hands, pluck the vegetables.  Farming is not new to Anthony. A winner of the Kerala Agriculture departments Best Farmer award, he has organic farms in Munnar, Kanthalloor and Cumbum (Tamil Nadu); he also helped set up a collective of organic farmers in Kanthalloor, near Munnar. The 46-year-old has been an organic farmer for the last 10 years, dividing his time between his farms. Stuck in Kochi once lockdown was announced, he decided to try cultivating vegetables on unused land  as a joke, I wasnt expecting much out of it, he says.  Getting the go-ahead from the owners was the easy part. All these plots had been unused, used more as building waste dumps. It took me a month to ready the soil, says Anthony, adding It was slushy, not ideal for cultivation, these used to be paddy fields ages ago and hence the soil is marshy, he says. He started work in the first week of April; preparing the soil took a month.  Anthony at one of the farms on a vacant plot in Kochis Jawahar Nagar. What started out as a lockdown experiment, has encouraged him to try it out in different parts of the city | Photo Credit: Thulasi Kakkat  When he speaks of preparing the soil, he means reviving it with organic components, neutralising the acidic content and restoring the ph balance. He readies it like forest soil using dry, rotting leaves.  It is the best nourishment, he says, I have five crore workers! Earthworms, red ants, microbes and other micro organisms  a good, healthy harvest depends on the soil.  Four months in, these plots are in varying stages of cultivation. He planted vegetables in the beginning of May; the first harvest was ready by July. The first batch, as expected, wasnt great, but subsequently it has been good, he says. He farms the plots in rotation, once harvest is done from one plot the other gets ready. The vegetables are plucked on alternate days.  Anthonys arrangement with the owners is straightforward  they can pick any quantity of vegetables from the farms. I cannot pay rent now since I dont make much from the plots. It will take a cycle of three harvests  nine months  for the soil to change and for the returns to come in. If the owner wants the land back, all I need is a months notice to wrap up the farm, he says.  Soli Joy is one of the people who has let Anthony farm on her property. I wish I had let Anthony use the property earlier. I have been shopping for vegetables from him for a long time and over the years he has become a friend, says Soli. Earlier she would have to get her plot cleaned once every six months or so, this way I dont have to do that... Also we get access to organic vegetables, she says. She plans to ask him to farm on her daughters property in Payyannur (Kannur) too.  Anthonys success with organic farming did not come easy: he learnt through trial and error. He is partly self-taught, and also learns from experts such as KV Dayal. He has also done courses in organic farming.  He is now approaching other owners of unused land in the city. Despite his successes, convincing them is still a challenge.  In the area between Vytilla and Kaloor junction, via Kathrikadavu Road (six-odd kilometres), there are around 100 acres of unused land. I have approached a few people, there are some who have shown interest, not as many as I would like, he says. There is a lot more unused land in Kochi... if we can cultivate, I am certain that half of Kochis food requirement can be met locally.  The formula he suggests links up with food security and self-sufficiency, generating employment and also promoting waste management by buying food waste in order to compost. Farmhands from places such as Wayanad or Thodupuzha could find employment in these farms.  For the city, this could be a permanent solution but not for him. Once restrictions are eased, he plans to return to his farms.  But I am ready to show the way and help if people are willing, he says. People have to selfmotivate rather than look at the Government, for this to work.",TOMATO

Three years on, hes a content man, he tells us, even though this was never a part of his plan.  My goal was to retire from politics in 2019 and spend the rest of my life doing social work. But the party had other plans. They wanted me to accept this responsibility, and I did so happily. I am retired from active politics of course, but I am still not tired of public life.

So, my ammamma and thatha (maternal grandparents) raised me, you see. I never saw my mother, but many years later, when my daughter Deepa was born, I saw my mother in her. Many would say that she looks exactly like my mother, so I always imagined how she would have been through my daughter. I cant choose a favourite between my son and daughter, but my daughter brings me a lot of joy. Shes a social worker. I am proud of her. I feel her work is greater than mine, because for whatever I did, I always got something in return. I became MLA, MP, Minister and now Vice President. But she is doing good work without expecting anything in return. And that is truly remarkable.Yes, I make sure I do. I could not spend enough time with my children when they were growing up since I was busy with my political career. When I would wake up, they would still be asleep and by the time I returned home, they would be in bed. I cant make up for all that lost time, but now, I make it a point to spend time with my grandchildren. They give me immense happiness. They are innocent and yet so witty and smart. Earlier, I used to take them to restaurants, but now I cant do that because of protocol. I cant even take them to a chappal shop, the chappal shop has to come to me instead. So I call them home and we spend time together. When I go on my trips, I make it a point to take at least one of my grand kids with me. I avoid politics when Im with them. I dont take my work home ever. But theyre familiar with the work I do and all my colleagues. In fact, one of my granddaughters is named Sushma, after Sushma Swarajji. When she was born, Sushma Swaraj and I were working in close association and so we decided to name her Sushma. Whenever Sushma Swaraj would see her, she would smile and say, Hello there, my namesake!(Laughs) Why not? Arun Jaitleyji was one of my closest friends. Even today, I miss him a lot. We used to bond over our common love for food. Wed joke that food and food for thought kept us going. Back when we were both party workers, we would often travel together. The first thing we would do after landing in a new city was find out which was the best restaurant there and go try the local cuisine. After the party meetings got over, we would skip the regular dinner organised for the party workers and head over to the restaurant. We discussed everything from politics to personal lives over many a good meal...Theres nothing I enjoy more than my native food. I have travelled across the world and tasted many cuisines, but the food I savour the most is mana Nellore bhojanam. My favourites are the various pachadlu (chutneys), and I dont mean pickles, mind you. Kandi pachadi, nuvvulu pachadi, tomato pachadi, gongura pachadi.... I simply love them. In the evening, if Im hungry, I just eat the pachadis. I also enjoy traditional food like vankai mavidikaaya kura (brinjal and green mango curry ), chaama gadda pulusu ( colacasia curry ), kodi pulusu (chicken curry), Nellore gaarelu, chakkaralu, booralu, etc. I actually get authentic Nellore bhojanam made here in Delhi as well, and its always a big draw.Back in the day in Hyderabad, I used to frequent this restaurant called Churuva in Adarsh Nagar. Their chicken pakoda was top class. I absolutely loved it. I would also frequent Blue Diamond near the LB stadium and end the meal with a paan from the paan dabba outside. I have some great memories of the city. Of course, of late, Im being more careful because of diabetes. But Ive eaten enough to last a lifetime, so I dont feel bad that I am missing out on anything.(Chuckles) Its not just the social media crowd, even members of the media have had a taste of my banter and wit. Sometimes, during an interview, they tell me, Sir, this is a headline, and I tell them, Your headline is not my deadline. Sometimes, theyd say, Sir, what about my report, I would tell them, Your report has no support, now please sit. I enjoy this.I feel its important to not just to make your point, but also make it in a way that its remembered. These days public discourse and public life are all about glamour, but I believe there should be humour as well. If you speak with humour, it will easily register in the minds of the people. Jagannath Rao Joshi has had a huge influence on me. He was one of the most powerful speakers I have heard in my life. Public speaking is a great skill and its something I wish to pass on to my children and grandchildren as well.",TOMATO

Sowing operations for vegetable crops are taken up every month as Greater Hyderabad and other parts of the state receive daily supplies. For August, vegetable sowing was taken up in over 70,000 acres in the state.The total annual production of the vegetables in the state is over 30 lakh metric tonnes, which is less than the consumption. The state overcomes the deficit with supplies from Maharashtra, Karnataka and other states, particularly potato, onions, capsicum among others.Officials of the Horticulture department told TOI that as of August 20, tomato cultivation had been taken up in 6,344 acres in Rangareddy, 2,397 acres in Sangareddy, 1,715 acres in Siddipet, 1,746 acres in Vikarabad, 854 acres in Medchal-Malkajgiri, 277 acres in Mahbubnagar, 312 acres in Medak and 408 acres in Yadadri.

Staring at huge losses, many of them have left their crop to rot in their fields.One such farmer, V Linga Reddy, from Tadimarri mandal of Anantapur district, incurred losses of Rs 12 lakh as he could not sell the banana, tomato, and onion he cultivated on 12 acres of land. To deal with his debt, he decided to sell his land, but couldnt find anyone to buy it for even Rs 10 lakh per acre.Linga Reddy owns eight acres of land, and cultivated banana on six acres and tomato on two. Besides this, he took land on lease from his relatives to cultivate cucumber.Amid the lockdown, when transportation was restricted, he had no option but to leave his crop of banana in the fields. I even asked traders to take the crop for free, but none came forward. I left the crop so at least cattle could eat it, he told TNIE.A trader agreed to buy the cucumber crop for just Rs 40,000, and paid a paltry sum as an advance. But after taking the crop, he stopped responding to my calls. He still hasnt paid me, Linga Reddy said.But the farmer didnt lose hope, and continued to cultivate crops  watermelon and onion on three acres each. It was a bumper crop. Under normal circumstances, I would have got a huge profit. But the lockdown restricted transport, and all my crop was either left in the field or didnt even fetch me the money I invested, he rued.Aims to clear debt of Rs 20 lakhLinga Reddy had taken loans of Rs 20 lakh and invested it in agriculture. But then his wife met with an accident, and the farmer had to spend Rs 2 lakh on her treatment.To clear his debts, the farmer decided to sell two acres of land. An acre used to fetch at least Rs 17-18 lakh before the lockdown. But now there are no buyers even if I reduce the rate. A couple of weeks ago, a farmer from a neighbouring village came forward to buy the land for Rs 13.5 lakh per acre. But he too backed away. Even If I want to sell it for Rs 10 lakh, there are no buyers, he said.However, Linga Reddy has not lost hope, and is again relying on farming to rescue him. I am a farmer. A farmer does not know anything but to invest in agriculture. Only time will tell if I get out of this situation, he said.Even Throwaway prices not helpingAn acre used to fetch at least Rs 17-18 lakh before the lockdown.

Vegetables like brinjal, bitter gourd, pointed gourd, ladies finger, ridge gourd and cowpeas are largely grown in the State.As many areas of the two districts are under knee-deep water, the chances of saving the crops are very remote, admits an official of the Horticulture department.Potato and onion prices have increased sharply by Rs 5 a kg in the last couple of days following a surge in the prices at source markets. The two commodities are now selling at Rs 35 and Rs 25 a kg respectively in retail markets across the State.With Odisha completely dependant on West Bangal for potato, traders of the neighbouring state have jacked up the price ahead of Durga Puja.Attributing the surge in potato prices by Bengal traders to next year election in West Bengal, general secretary of Kuberpuri Byabasai Sangha Shakti Shankar Mishra said the tuber price will remain high till the arrival of new crops in December.This is the second dose of hike of potato by Bengal traders. Potato that was available at Rs 18-20 a kg in retail markets zoomed to Rs 30 a kg in Odisha in the first week of June.He said hike in onion price is due to increase in prices at Nasik in Maharashtra, the major onion market for Odisha. The mandi price of onion at Nasik is in the range of Rs 22 to Rs 24 a kg depending on quality.Tomato which was selling at Rs 20-30 a kg a week ago has jumped to Rs 50-60 a kg in the State.

(Photo: Getty Images/Thinkstock)Unseasonal rain and disruptions related to Covid-19 in the farm sector have led to a sudden rise in wholesale as well retail prices of tomatoes and other vegetables in different parts of Maharashtra. Traders and farmers said the present trend will continue till the new crop hits markets in the next fortnight or so.To date, monsoon in the state has been more than satisfactory in terms of rainfall as well as arrival. Till August 30, the state has received 864.6 mm rainfall as against the normal 824.5 mm it receives. Barring Pune and Nagpur divisions, all other divisions have received more than normal rainfall. Farmers have also sped up sowing activities because of favourable rainfall.At Junnars wholesale market in Pune district, farmers are realising rates of Rs 30 per kg for their produce. This is a slight rise from Rs 25 per kg in July. Market officials pointed to the sharp decline in arrivals, which has pushed the prices up. As against normal arrivals of 25,000 to 35,000 crates containing 20 kg tomatoes each, the market is now reporting around 15,000 to 16,000 crates daily basis.Farmers in the tomato growing zone of Junnar have blamed heavy rain for the dip in arrivals. Rain has lashed the state in the last few weeks of August. Deepak Bhise, president of Tomato Growers Association of Junnar, said rain had destroyed the market ready picking of the crop, and lockdown due to Covid-19 had also caused disruption in prices, leading farmers to abandon their crop midway.Unlike tomato growers in Nashik, farmers in this belt take their crop in the winter or rabi period, with the first picking hitting the markets in peak summer months of March, April and May. This crop feeds the markets till kharif tomatoes start arriving from Nashik after September.Disruption in the markets due to lockdown in the wake of Covid-19, however, has led to tomato prices crashing March onwards. As main consumer markets remained closed, feeder markets reported price crash to record low levels. This has led farmers to abandon their crop midway, leading to the supply crunch at present.Ironically, traders are asking us to bring in our produce but there is hardly any produce in the fields, Bhise said.Like tomatoes, prices of other vegetables have also recorded a steady rise as farmers blamed heavy rain in August for the same. Rain has prevented harvesting of market-ready crops. This trend will continue till the middle of September, after which prices can come down a bit, he added. The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

The shortage was mainly because of the heavy spells that affected the crops. Also, many consignments of leafy vegetables were spoiled.

It may make your mouth water and maybe even make you want to order in from your nearest restaurant (if theyre back in business amid the Covid-19 pandemic) or if you so wish, even make that extra effort of cooking them at home. Then there might also be a wish to add a can of soda, and definitely a cheesy burger with double patties to go with this delicious combination. Its all tasty and irresistible till you start counting the calories and give yourself a reality check about the food that you consume.It is rightly said you are what you eat. So you might want to feel like a light lettuce, floating around, but actually have piled on all those unwanted kilos to look like your favourite burger instead, in other words, unhealthy and definitely not a friend to your body and mind.But its not just those fries or burgers to blame, as were easily drawn to consuming junk or processed food because it might be effortless, probably tastier, and the type of food on which ingredient labels are a lost cause.Did you know that eating a poor quality diet, which includes processed or ultra-processed food, is linked to a higher risk of obesity, lifestyle disorders, depression, digestive issues, heart ailments and in some cases, even an early death?Three or more servings of ultra-processed food a day double the odds that strands of DNA and proteins called telomeres, found on the end of chromosomes, would be shorter compared to people who rarely consumed such foods, reported scientists at the European and International Conference on Obesity.Short telomeres are a marker of biological ageing at the cellular level, and the study suggests that diet is a factor in driving the cells to age faster, says a report by AFP.Even though the correlation is strong, the causal relationship between eating processed foods and diminished telomeres remains speculative, the authors of the research cautioned.Each human cell has 23 pairs of chromosomes that contain our genetic code, adds the AFP report.Telomeres do not carry genetic information, but are vital for preserving the stability and integrity of chromosomes and, by extension, the DNA that all the cells in our body relies on to function. As we get older, our telomeres shorten naturally because each time a cell divides, part of the telomere is lost. That reduction in length has long been recognised as a marker of biological age, it continues.What are ultra-processed foods?Ultra-processed foods consist of a mix of oils, fats, sugars, starch and proteins that cannot be considered whole or natural food varieties. They are often artificially-flavoured, coloured and contain emulsifiers, preservatives and other additives that increase the food products shelf-life and by that extension the manufacturers profit margins.These same properties, however, also mean that such foods are nutritionally poor compared to less processed alternatives, the researchers told AFPEarlier studies have shown strong correlations between ultra-processed foods and hypertension, obesity, depression, type 2 diabetes and some forms of cancer. These conditions are often age-related in so far as they are linked to oxidative stress and inflammation known to influence telomere length.-- with AFP inputsFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter",TOMATO

So we decided to start our quarantine meal packages, says Gayathri.While they offer breakfast, lunch and dinner, customers also have the option of subscribing to one meal per day for a 14-day period.Meals include Kerala rice, millets, quinoa, cauliflower rice, aviyal and zucchini roast. There are also non-vegetarian options with chicken, mutton and fish.According to Gayathri, their quarantine breakfast option is popular with children. Kids are known to be fussy eaters especially when they are down with an illness. Keeping that in mind, we use natural colouring elements like pudina, beetroot and turmeric to make dishes like a simple idli look attractive, says Gayathri. Roos Food Concepts now delivers an average of 50 quarantine lunch and 50 dinner orders at the doorsteps of customers every day.Keeping it simpleIn Bengaluru, Divya Prabhakar and Vishal Shetty of Oota Company are on their toes every morning catering to the 80-odd quarantine meal orders pouring in from across the city.They call it Lockdown Lunchbox. I received a call in July from a friend, who along with her whole family tested positive and wanted to subscribe to meals for 10 days. That is when I started offering the quarantine meal options, says Divya.Oota Company has two kinds of subscription options  five or 10 days. One can opt for lunch or dinner or both. The meal consists of a vegetarian menu with a curry, a dry dish, homemade curd, rasam and rice, chapati or ragi mudde.Packed and sealed in plastic boxes, the meal is home delivered through Dunzo. We have received a lot of orders from NRI clients whose parents or relatives are in the city and under home quarantine. We also give an option to customise food according to the requirements, says Divya.The kitchen at Visakhapatnams Hotel Rockdale has been working round the clock for the past three weeks, ever since it rolled out its quarantine meal services.We are delivering nearly 150 meals per day, says Satish Varanasi, the food and beverages manager of the hotel. Contact-less delivery and a nutritious menu are the highlights of these meals.The hotel provides a combination of idli-vada, tomato rice, upma, ragi malt for breakfast, while its lunch and dinner menus consist of phulka, steamed rice, dal and curd rice along with a vegetarian or non-vegetarian curry depending on the package selected. We have a team of four chefs who come up with a different menu daily and have a dedicated staff of four to package the food, says Satish.Active meals is what Hotel Minerva in Vijayawada likes to call their quarantine food package. General manager E Nagesh says, Our food is high in protein. We have relied on native ingredients like different varieties of millets and seasonal vegetables. With each meal we provided rasam with either garlic, munakkaya (drumstick) or pepper, he says. Nagesh adds, We have also tied up with hospitals for food delivery for patients and it has worked well for us.(With inputs from Prabalika M Borah)",TOMATO

While the price of one kg of beans has breached the Rs 100-mark, tomato is being sold on the retail market for a staggering Rs 60 per kg. The vendors in the retail market have attributed the surge in the prices to a drop in supply and an accompanying rise in demand . Farmers, however, have attributed the spike to the loss of crops owing to the rain.Vendors said that supply of vegetables to the city had witnessed a drop in the past few days. Most vegetables are being transported to Bengaluru and other big cities, resulting in the prices going up, said Nagaraju, a vegetable vendor.President of the Mysuru District Raitha Sangha TR Vidyasagar said that farmers engaged in the cultivation of vegetables were getting a good price for their produce. A vegetable cultivator in Nanjangud himself, he said, We are getting Rs 30 per kg of tomato, and making Rs 35 to rs 40 for every kg of beans. This is owing to the sudden rise in the price on the market.However, the incessant rain has also ushered in a fair amount of problems, with tomato crops sustaining much damage.

This prompted traders and farmers to suspend trading in a bid to boost the wholesale price.Kumawat said much of the countrys supply of onions was being maintained by onions stored from the previous harvest and prices could see-saw until November, when the fresh crop is due. Rains have damaged stored onions in many depots, the main source for current arrivals in markets, he said.Centres picked for replenishing onion stocks from a federally held buffer are located in the Northeast and Jammu and Kashmir, along with Mumbai, Delhi, Kolkata, Hyderabad, Ahmedabad, Pune and Indore, officials with knowledge of the matter said.Kharif or summer sowing of most crops has beaten last years figures, with the total acreage as of September 11, 2020 standing at 6% higher than last year, led by a 7% monsoon surplus, according to data from the farm ministry and India Meteorological Department.However, rains have disrupted supplies and damaged crops as well as stocked onion and potato in states such as Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka, said Sudin Tarle, another official overseeing the commodities trade in Lasalgaon.Potatoes, the most widely consumed kitchen staple, have become expensive too, while tomato prices have also been elevated. One of the reasons for a spike in onion prices is a surge in exports. In August, there had been a steep increase in the export quantity. About 3 lakh MT of onion was exported in August, as compared to 1.26 lakh MT during the same period last year, an official said.The price rise could be steeper in October and November, he said.The average wholesale price of potatoes in Sptember 1-14 in Agra mandi was Rs 2,200 a quintal, steeply higher than Rs 760 a quintal during the corresponding period last year, according to data from the National Horticultural Research and Development Foundation.Arrivals data in the market, which refer to volumes traded and is a key indicator of prices, show that in September 2019, potato arrivals in Agra averaged 14,000 quintal a day. Between September 1 and 14, 2020, arrivals have halved to about 7,000 quintal, the data show.Tomato prices have edged up since July. On July 11, prices in Delhi doubled to Rs 80 from Rs 40 a kg. In the national capital, Chandigarh, Guwahati and Kolkata, tomato prices have jumped from Rs 40 a kg in the first week of September to Rs 50 a kg on September 14, the price data further show.Fruits, vegetables, and oils and fats  sub-components used to measure the growth in the consumer price index, or retail inflation  showed higher inflation during August compared to July, according to official retail food inflation figures released on Monday.Within the food and beverage category, vegetable inflation in August came in high at 11.4% compared to 11.1% in July, while fruit inflation rose to 1% from 0.1%.

While the demand increased during the Onam period, the same has dwindled now in the city, with skyrocketing prices. According to Ashokan T V, a trader at the Tripunithura market, the primary reason for the price hike is that vegetables only come from Palakkad and Tamil Nadu now.Usually, we have supplies from Karnataka too, but currently districts such as Mysure are in their cultivation season. During Onam, the prices were high, but it then dropped right after the festive season. It has increased once again. Despite the reduced demand, the prices remain high because of shortage of supply, he said.However, Mani, a vegetable seller, said the spike in street vendors during the lockdown was a reason for lower demand and uneven sales.Street vendors selling vegetables, fish, biriyani and eggs have mushroomed during the lockdown. Along with Covid-19, that has also significantly contributed to fewer sales, he said. As on Tuesday, the retail prices of tomato stood at Rs60/kg, ginger was priced at Rs135, onion was sold for Rs35, ladies finger at Rs65 and potato at Rs50/kg. N H Shameed, general secretary of Ernakulam Market Stall Owners Association, mentioned the decline in supplies that arrived in markets.Earlier, we used to get 20 loads of vegetables. It has now shrunk to 10 loads. As expected, Covid is the main reason -- it has led to fewer labourers in Tamil Nadu and almost nil cultivation. In the place of 100 sacks that used to arrive, he number has dropped to 30. Then, the season for fruits and vegetables like green mango and drumsticks is over. Now, the wholesale price of drumstick is Rs50/kg and retail is Rs60/kg. Similarily, green mangoes are priced at Rs65 for wholesale and Rs74 for retail. Two weeks ago the wholesale rate of onions was Rs14, now it has increased to Rs31 in wholesale and Rs35 in retail price, he said.However, bananas have seen diminished prices; nenthran was Rs50 during Onam, now it has declined to Rs25; njalipoovan was Rs48, now it stands at Rs40.

Kolars APMC market saw about 6,000 quintals landing each day, and an annual turnover of `400 crore before the pandemic hit, making it one of Asias largest markets for tomatoes.On average, tomato is grown on about 10,000 acres in the district, mostly in Mulbagal and Srinivaspura taluks. However, the uncertainties induced by the pandemic resulted in a lower than usual harvest this year. Due to the pandemic and the lockdown, many farmers did not cultivate the crop. Instead of 6,000 quintals, about 4,000 quintals arrive at the market each day now, APMC president B Venkatesh Kolar told TNIE.Before the pandemic and subsequent lockdown disrupted international trade, tomato growers in Kolar exported their produce to Bangladesh, Pakistan, Afghanistan and China. With travel restrictions eased after the lockdown was lifted, exports to Bangladesh have resumed. Each day for the past few weeks, lorries laden with 400 tonnes of tomatoes have been making their way to the neighbouring country.Every day, 20 lorries are sent to Bangladesh. It takes four to five days to reach the Bangladesh border from Kolar. They pass Kolkata and unload tomatoes at the India-Bangladesh border, Venkatesh said. Exports to the other three countries have not resumed as flight operations are yet to reach normal levels.There is also good domestic demand in Kerala, West Bengal, UP, Delhi, Jharkhand, Tamil Nadu, Madhya Pradesh, and Gujarat, due to the poor harvest in other tomato-growing states.

When you go to the market, youre buying tomatoes, bhindi, potatoes. Who will believe there is a problem? That is the problem for me.Rao is an architect and agriculturist with a PhD in genetics and plant breeding. And hes one of Indias few but dedicated seed preservers. Their mission is to ensure that we never run out of, for instance, the purple bhindi or yellow tomato. So these botanical heritage enthusiasts search the country for seeds that are no longer widely used, and preserve and plant them.My aim is to reach the urban gardener, says Rao, who set up Hariyalee Seeds in 2011, after returning from a stint with the International Seed Savers Exchange in the United States. If I give a farmer a purple bhindi, he can grow it but he wouldnt get a price for it because the urban consumer doesnt know about the purple bhindi. Once you get urban gardeners and farmers to grow these varieties, post and share photos of them on social media, then you are creating awareness and generating demand.Diversity extinction is something that also preoccupies Sangita Sharma. There are about 200 varieties of native crops going extinct as we speak, and all it takes to prevent this is the right archive of seeds saved in community seed banks in the right agro-climatic regions across India.Sharma is the founding trustee of Annadana Soil and Seed Savers, a Bengaluru-based non-profit started in 2001. It is now a food forest spread across 2 acres in Bangalore and 24 acres in the Western Ghats, home to seed production farms, offices, drying work stations and of course the repository, which holds over 1,000 varieties of indigenous seeds, with a focus on vegetables.Hariyalee is preserving the seeds of rare breeds like the little yellow bumblebee and hilly billy tomatoes and the indigo purple ones.There are 54 varieties of tomato alone, and seeds procured from Assam for the rare and coveted giant okra, whose stem can grow to a height of 17 ft. The seeds are sourced from farmers who maintain non-hybrid, non-GMO genetic stock. The older generations usually know of the varieties that are dwindling or disappearing. Youd be surprised at what youd find in their stores of seeds, Sharma says.Kong Sangma, an 84-year-old from the Garo Hills, for instance, gave Annadana seeds for a unique red brinjal and red chillies that grow up to 1 ft long. The seeds had been preserved beneath her mattress, wrapped in old rags, Sharma says. But thats the thing about seeds. They are robust lifes gift to life.Annadana releases a new seed catalogue that is distributed each year to urban and rural farmers who have subscribed. Prices start at Rs 100 per gm of seeds. We do not supply in bulk as we are seed conservers and not a seed corporation. Farmers / urban gardeners can multiply their own seeds and become food and seed-autonomous, she says. The regular seeds saved up come in handy too and in times of distress such as after the Kerala and Kodagu floods of 2019, lakhs of packets of seeds were donated to farmers in those areas. Farmers get trained first and thereafter seeds are donated.In Odisha, meanwhile, retired schoolteacher Natabar Sarangi, 87, co-founded a group called Rajendra Desi Chasa Gabesana Kendra (the Rajendra Indigenous Agriculture Research Centre). It has preserved, multiplied and distributed close to 700 varieties of indigenous paddy over 25 years. Research has shown that India once possessed about 1.1 lakh landraces of rice with diverse and valuable properties. After the Green Revolution, when a few high-yielding varieties were introduced, a huge majority of the landraces vanished from farmers collections.While Sarangi doesnt have a community seed bank system, he keeps the cycle going by growing the varieties, in tiny patches, on the research centres 3.5-acre farm, and distributing seeds to farmers.Hes a pioneer in organic farming in the state, having started in 1998, says Surendra Natha Ghoda, assistant agriculture officer for Niali block, Cuttack, Odisha. Under his training and guidance many local paddy farmers are now motivated to take up organic farming.Follow more stories on Facebook and Twitter",TOMATO

Moreover, the nodal NECC's (National Egg Coordination Committee's) published rates have been fluctuating widely on an everyday basis unlike before when its prices remained stable for months.""Egg rates had fallen as low as Rs 44-48 per dozen during April-May. It appears that farmers and traders are seeking to recover losses. Already tomato is Rs 60 per kg, potato Rs 40-45 and onion Rs 35 per kilo. How does a common household manage expenses? Eggs are the most basic source of protein for common households ,"" said Jogeshwari resident Ambreen Shaikh .Traders blame the rising cost on the supply chain disruption caused by the Covid-19 lockdown. Raju Shewale of the Mumbai Egg Traders' Association said, ""At least 35-40 percent of poultry farmers had to close down their business amid the lockdown. Now supply is unable to keep pace with demand. Rates will remain high in the foreseeable future, perhaps rise further.""""Mumbai consumes an average of 85 lakh eggs daily but is now receiving merely 45 lakh. There is a vast shortfall. Monday's wholesale rate was Rs 550 per 100 eggs,"" Shewale said.Interestingly at the start of the pandemic, people were afraid to consume poultry items but that trend has now reversed. Mumbaikars are now consuming more eggs and chicken to build immunity against Covid-19. Shewale said, ""In fact hospitals in Pune, Satara, and various other cities and towns of Maharashtra are prescribing eggs to Covid-19 patients in order to help them recover and fortify their immunity. This has resulted in unprecedented demand.""Aftab Ahmed Khan, chairman of the same Mumbai Egg Traders' Association said, ""In lockdown season poultry farmers were unable to rear birds, procure feed or sell their products. Farming activity was also disrupted as labourers went home. Even now main supply centres like Hyderabad and surrounding areas in Andhra Pradesh, apart from Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and even Maharashtra, are unable to meet the demand. I expect prices to remain high till December.""Essentially this means there is no relief in sight for Mumbaikars. Poultry product prices peak with increased demand during winter and Christmas. So there could be a second spell of high prices during December-January.",TOMATO

For, the wholesale vegetable market which functioned at a relatively clean and neatly developed layout on the outskirts of the city during the lockdown was shifted back to what was locally known as Kanni Market near Central Bus Stand. The new market placeresembles a muddy field prepared for paddy transplantation.Over a thousand farmers from nearby villages bring their vegetables to this wholesale market every evening. An equal number of vegetable vendors, mostly women, gather here to purchase them. Both sellers and buyers transact their business standing in the ankle-high mud.With no arrangements to stack the vegetables, the farmers put the vegetable bundles, bags and crates in the mud. The vegetables often slip from their hands and fall in the mud. The vendors carefully pick them from the mud, clean them at their respective houses in the night and sell the same vegetables in push-carts next morning in the residential localities of Kalaburagi. There have been several instances of people slipping and falling on the slippery ground and getting injured. Yet, nobody from the administration has ever bothered to look into it.The market commences at 4 p.m. and continues till 11 p.m. every day except on Saturdays. The authorities never bothered to make lighting arrangements, let alone shifting the market to some better and safer place. The vendors tie torchlight or mobile phones with the torch switched on around their necks and carefully move in the dark on the muddy ground. They use the torches to shed some light on the vegetables and examine them before buying. The whole market blinks with the torches and mobile lights in the night. The streetlights on the road are of no use to the market.Thousands of vehicles  four-wheelers, two-wheelers, three-wheelers and push-carts  are brought to the place by farmers and the vendors. They are chaotically parked along the roadside that often leads to traffic jams. The frictions and petty quarrels among the people over the parking issues are very common. But, no traffic police personnel is seen to ensure proper parking and control the traffic jams.For the last few days, one more problem has cropped up: the accumulation of garbage in the muddy ground. With the incessant rains lashing the region for the last one week, the garbage generated in the market is simply left behind to rot. Now, the whole market stinks.We came to know that a novel coronavirus originated from a vet market in China and spread to the whole world. I dont know what disease will emerge from Kalaburagi market if the market continues to function the way it is now, a farmer who bought loads of tomato from a nearby village told The Hindu.",TOMATO

As per the government, there is less demand for onion compared to the last year and sufficient fresh onion produce is expected to arrive in Delhi by the end of October.Retail prices of potato have increased due to low production this year, officials said. The price of tomatoes is also on the higher side as its a highly perishable commodity. The unseasonal rains in tomato producing states have impacted the demand-supply position.

That, however, may now start coming in only by December. (File)Five years ago, retail prices of arhar/tur (pigeon pea) dal scaled to levels of Rs 180-200 per kg towards October, and was seen to have contributed significantly to the BJPs defeat in Bihar Assembly polls.This time round, the Narendra Modi government is taking no chances, especially with heavy rain in north Karnataka.The crop in this major tur beltcovering Bidar, Gulbarga, Yadgir, Bijapur and Raichur districtsnormally arrives after mid-November. That, however, may now start coming in only by December.North Karnataka has had excess rain in August and this month. At least 10 per cent of the crop there has suffered damage. Even the crop that hasnt so far will see delayed harvesting, said Nitin Kalantri, a leading dal miller based in Latur, Maharashtra.Wholesale tur prices in Latur have risen from around Rs 5,800 to Rs 6,700 per quintal in the last one month, well above the governments minimum support price (MSP) of Rs 6,000 per quintal. Milled tur/arhar dal is currently retailing at Rs 95-105 per kg in various parts of the country.Read| Dry July, excess rain in August-end spell trouble for kharif cropsThe firming up of prices is being attributed to the likely damage or late arrival of the Karnataka crop, as well as the government not issuing permits to mills for import of raw tur. This, despite the Directorate General of Foreign Trades move on April 21, notifying 4 lakh tonnes (lt) to be imported in 2020-21.Kalantri said, The permits should have been given earlier so that imports do take place just when the domestic crop is being harvested. But now, with no imports, and even the new crop going to arrive only after December, there could be pressure on supply. That is pushing up prices.Given the situation, a high-level meeting convened by the Cabinet Secretary last week is said to have reviewed the overall pulses availability situation.On September 14, the government imposed a blanket ban on export of onion after retail prices of the bulb crossed Rs 40 per kg (along with potatoes and tomatoes also at over Rs 35 and Rs 55/kg, respectively).A repeat of October-November 2015 is the last thing the government wants, when the next polls in Bihar are due around then. They will not allow arhar to become an election issue again, a source pointed out.Explained A tough balancing act for the Centre Prices of arhar and urad are ruling above MSP. The outlook for POT  potato, onion, tomato  is also bullish. That should be useful for the Modi government when it is facing farmer backlash over its recent APMC reform Bill. But the flip side of rising food prices is its possible impact on the upcoming Bihar Assembly polls. That makes for a tough balancing act.But Sanjeev Kumar Chadha, managing director of the National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India (Nafed), sought to dispel any concerns over shortage of pulses.He told The Indian Express: We (Nafed) have 8.5 lt of arhar/tur, apart from 15-16 lt of chana (chickpea), 3 lt of urad (black gram) and 2 lt of moong (green gram). Some traders are trying to create artificial scarcity to force the government to allow more imports.Farmers have sown pulses on 138.62 lakh hectares (lh) area during this kharif season, which is 6.28 lh higher than last year.Although too much rain from the second half of August has caused damage to the standing urad crop in Madhya Pradesh and tur in north Karnataka, the Agriculture Ministry expects total kharif pulses production at 93.1 lt, up from 77.2 lt in 2019 and 80.9 lt in 2018. The condition of tur in the main Marathwada and Vidarbha regions of Maharashtraarrivals there start from Januaryis said to be very good as of now.The government is obviously worried about Bihar, but will also not want prices to fall below MSPs  that would discourage farmers from planting rabi season pulses (chana and masoor). Prices are ruling above MSP after a long time and that can even help counter the unrest over the recently passed APMC reform Bill, the aforementioned source said.

The largest gains in the consumer price front during the pandemic-induced lockdown in Kerala was witnessed in the case of vegetables and fruits.While the consumer price of vegetables went up by a marginal 1.9% in June 2020, the price of most vegetables in the State fell by around a quarter. The only important vegetable where prices went up in the State during the period was ash gourd where the prices moved up by 5.8%, as per the analysis of trends in June by Pyaralala Raghavan and George Joseph of Gulathi Institute of Finance and Taxation (GIFT).The highest fall in vegetable prices were in cabbage (33.5%), followed by green chillies (26.6%), snake gourd (25.6%), pumpkin (25%), tomato (23.6%), Onion (20.6%), ladys finger (20.5%), bitter gourd (15.9%), brinjal (14.9%), and cucumber (11.9%).While some of the decline in prices of vegetables, fruits, meat and eggs can be attributed to fall in prices of imports from Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, a major portion of the dip in consumer prices will have to be attributed to the States efforts to increase domestic production of vegetables, fruits, meats and egg.In the case of rice, the price trends was below 5% in June compared to the 6.5% nationally. However, in the case of pulses, the consumer price increase nationally was significantly lower than in the State, where in some cases hike was above 35%.The consumer price increase was much lower than the national level of 18.8% in the case of meat and eggs. Consumer goods where price increase was benign in the State included sugar, tea, coffee, oil, oilseeds, tobacco, clothing and personal care products. Red chilly and garlic prices rose sharply by 35.9% and 16.7% respectively during the period.Prices of various baskets of essential commodities moderated/slowed down during June compared to the previous month. A notable fall in the average price was registered in the case of spices while the other essential commodities showed a weak price trend. The notable dip in the prices was for rice and chicken and the decrease was moderate in the case of vegetables in July. In the case of chicken, the average price dropped to 95 per kg from 125 per kg in June.The COVID-19 package rolled out by the government, timely disbursement of direct benefit transfer including various pensions, and a bunch of welfare measures helped the market to come out from the lockdown impact, as per the GIFT analysis.",TOMATO

As a result, farmers such as Shyamanthi Eswaramma struggle to irrigate the tomato crop.Plight of farmersWith the inflows into the irrigation tank dwindling over the last 18 years, the villagers started sinking tens of borewells every year, and Eswarammas husband had sunk 15 boreswells.Burdened with debts and apprehending pressure from the money-lenders, he had deserted his wife and three children and left for Bengaluru.But Eswaramma stayed put, purchased a bullock and began farming with the help of her children. Besides farming, she had taken up rearing of country hens to make both ends meet.In the last one year, she sunk three borewells, and only one of them yields one-inch of water for an hour enough for a small piece of land adjacent to the old habitation, where she grows tomatoes.Though she has three acres of land in three different locations in the village, there is no water for irrigation.",TOMATO

(Express Photo by Gurmeet Singh )As farmers dharna on the Amritsar-Delhi railway tacks completed 14 days on Wednesday, many protesters recalled how they had sat at the same track for seven weeks in 2016 to push state government to pursue better marketing of Punjab Basmati in Iran and other middle eastern countries. They also rued that due to diplomatic reasons, Punjab was not able to fully realise the potential of trading its agri-products through the Wagah border.India was first to impose 200 per cent excise duty over import of Pakistani goods via Attari-Wagha border after Pulwama attack in February 2019. Following this, Pakistan put a blanket ban over the import from India via Wahga border after removal of special status for J&K in August 2019.The government has blocked all the trade opportunities that Punjab has due to its geographical position. Punjabi farmers have great opportunity to sell their crops in Pakistan and middle east via Wahga border. But Punjabi farmers were never allowed to explore these opportunities. And now they are threatening to take away the granted MSP for wheat and paddy. Wheat, paddy and other crops produced by Punjabi farmers can never be a burden for the Indian government to purchase because these crops have very good market in the Pakistan, Iran and middle east countries for which Whgah border should be opened. But international diplomacy has been hurting the interest of Punjabi farmers. Government should open Wagha border before pushing farmers into open market, said Sawarn Singh Pandher, general secretary, Kisan Mazdoor Sangarsh Committee, Punjab.Prof D K Madaan, Head, School of Social Sciences at Punjabi University Patiala, and an expert on Indo-Pak trade said, Though trade via Wagah has almost come to halt, there has been trade of 77.69 million US dollars between India and Pakistan in first four months of financial year 2020-21. This trade mostly was through air cargo and not by road. Indian export to Pakistan reduced from 2,066 million US dollars in 2018-19 to 816.62 million US dollars in 2019-20.While protests over farm laws rage in Punjab, Pakistan has ordered 20 lakh tonnes of wheat from Russia. Many protesting farmers said that this was an opportunity missed for India in general and Punjab in particular.Food inflation often makes headlines in Pakistan. They are importing wheat from Russia. They had tomato crisis last year. Union government would have earned good profit from the food market in Pakistan. But Wagah border is closed. Wings of traders are crippled, but the talk is of selling in open market. This is joke, said Punjab PHD chamber chairman R R Sachdeva, who met Union governments 15th Finance Commission members during their visit to Amritsar in 2019 and asked them to allow Punjab to do trade with Pakistan.About the 2016 rail roko, farmers said that at that time the then Punjab government had promised farmers that it would form a high-level committee to visit Iran to explore options to sell Punjab Basmati there. The protest that year was triggered due to sharp fall in prices of Basmati in the open market, forcing the government to pick Basmati at paddy MSP. Unlike paddy, Basmati is not procured over MSP.The committee had to visit Iran to study the demand and policies of Basmati in the Iran and the other middle east counties. At that time too, there was a feeling among farmers of Mahja that one of the prime reason behind the low prices of Basmati was that Modi governments spoiled relations with Iran, said Satnam Singh Ajnala, leader of Jamhoori Kisan Sabha.This year again, Basmati is being procured in the open market at less than paddy MSP which is above Rs 1,850. Basmati has being procured at Rs 1700. Despite the promise in 2016, Punjab government did nothing to explore the opportunities for farmers in Iran or middle east. Basmati farmers are back to square one again. Now you can understand shallowness in the claims of central government about more profit to farmers after market would be open, said Sawarn Singh Pandher, general secretary, Kisan Mazdoor Sangarsh Committee Punjab.

The modalities pertaining to the loading, unloading and time schedules would be finalised in a couple of days in coordination with agriculture and horticulture wings, traders and railway authorities.District Collector Narayana Bharat Gupta on Saturday announced that the first batch of the tomato stock would be transported to Chennai next week.The decision was the outcome of a series of meetings between the district administration and traders associations of tomato and mango products of Chittoor district and Tamil Nadu and railway authorities as well.As of now, the tomato and mango stocks, including the pulp, reach Chennai and other parts of the country from Chittoor district by road through containers. The tomatoes meant for export would be predominantly procured from Kalikiri, Gurramkonda and Madanapalle mandals, the main contributors to the Agriculture market at Madanapalle. Besides, huge stocks also reach Chennai from the Vaddepalle market in V. Kota mandal.Mr. Gupta said that regular rail transportation of tomatoes from Madanapalle to Chennai and other parts would result in further boom in the horticulture trade of Chittoor district. The traders felt that rail transportation would be beneficial to them and the risk of damage to the produce would be less compared to sending it by road. It is expected that the initial shipment would require about six bogies and the number could be more during the peak season.During the peak season, the daily arrivals of tomato stocks at the Madanapalle market alone would be about 1,200 tonnes and in the lean period, it drops to below 300 tonnes.",TOMATO

(PTI Photo)NEW DELHI: India's latest agricultural reform legislations will empower farmers and give them more options to sell their produce and earn maximum profits, Israeli envoy to India Ron Malka has said, citing his country's experience.He said the Indian farmers would realise the real benefits of these reform measures once ""the dust settles"".Asserting that collaboration in the agriculture sector is one of the main ""glues"" that bind the Indo-Israel partnership, Malka said the new farm laws can further deepen ties as India can adopt Israel's technology of using digital platforms to connect farmers directly with consumers.In an interview to PTI, the Israeli ambassador said the efficiency of the agriculture sector as a whole will increase with the new legislations and consumers will also enjoy better and fresh crops.""In Israel, there are no middlemen. There is full transparency and farmers are connected to customers. This is working very efficiently with very advanced digital platforms,"" Malka said.""Once the Indian market is open and every farmer can sell to anyone they want...they can adopt these platforms (developed by Israel) by making necessary adjustments for local market conditions,"" he said.In the first phase, this kind of system gives farmers the ability to get what they deserve and in the second phase, it becomes a very efficient and powerful planning tool that helps in the supply-demand coordination, Malka said.Asked about his views on how these legislations can empower farmers in India, the Israeli envoy said, ""Yes, I believe that (these measures will help farmers). The efficiency of the agriculture sector as a whole (will increase). The consumers are also going to enjoy better crops.""Asked about apprehensions raised by a section of the people that the new farm laws would reduce the bargaining power of farmers vis-a-vis corporates, he said, ""I don't think that would be the case.""Malka said farmers probably still don't know the right know-how to adjust to the new system and will face some problems initially, but in the long term when the ""dust settles"" this is going to make the system more efficient and it will bring in much more options and opportunities for the farmers.The reforms will eventually make the system more efficient and profitable for the farmers, the Israeli envoy said.Malka cited Israel's experience for his assertions.""It will take some time to do some adjustments as the current system has been in place for a long time, but once the dust settles and we get a new equilibrium, it will be for the benefit of farmers, customers and of course the overall Indian economy,"" he said.The three farm bills -- the Farmer's Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill, 2020 -- were passed by Parliament recently. Subsequently, President Ram Nath Kovind gave his assent to the bills.The Congress, many other opposition parties and several farmers organisations have been protesting against these legislations, claiming that these will harm the interests of farmers and benefit corporates, a claim denied by the government.The Centre has asserted that these new laws will be beneficial for farmers and will increase their income.Noting that agriculture is the ""backbone of the Indian economy"", Malka said there was immense potential for collaboration between the two countries in this sector.""Our most successful collaboration on agriculture is with India. We have now 29 centres of excellence in agriculture functioning all over India. In one year, 1,47,000 farmers were trained in these Indo-Israel centres of excellence,"" he said.These centres of excellence showcase the most advanced Israeli technologies and practices in agriculture, he said.""We are going to expand these centres of excellence to 'areas of excellence'. As a concept, 55-60 villages around each centre of excellence will be taken up to expand the know-how, knowledge, systems and practices that we bring to them. And also to add to it our water-related technologies,"" he said.Millions of farmers around India have got to know of the Israeli technology and their lives have become much easier because of that, he noted.""...In Israel we have so many advanced digital platforms to connect farmers and consumers. We work on all of the value chains,"" he said while asserting that these technologies can be of great use to farmers in India now as the markets would open up for them and they would get what they truly deserve.Explaining the online platforms that have connected farmers and consumers directly in Israel, Malka said if one wanted to order cucumbers and tomato for salad, for example, the person could go to the internet and directly order the same.He said farmers in Israel get the best price for their produce without middlemen cornering any cut.Malka said this kind of system and technology could be adopted by India after some adjustments and it can take it directly from Israel rather than inventing such platforms.Such online platforms would also help in understanding the market as well as demand and supply, which in turn would help in planning and do farming much more efficiently, he said.""You can even recommend to farmers what to grow and when to grow and you can assure them a minimum price because you understand the market,"" he said.So, one can tell the farmers to go for tomatoes instead of cucumber next year, after looking at the market demand, the Israeli envoy said.Earlier this month, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Israeli counterpart Benjamin Netanyahu reviewed initiatives by the two countries in a host of sectors, including agriculture, water and innovation.",TOMATO

Bombay Greens came out of this need.During the pandemic, we were very lucky to have our own vegetable garden. This made us realise the importance of being self-sustainable and we thought of creating products that can help amateur gardeners grow their own produce easily and quickly, says Tanvi.While their initial investment for Bombay Greens was 30,000 when they started in the initial phase of the lockdown, Tanvi and Ankur broke even in a months time and their turnover has grown to 9 lakhs in the past five months.These DIY Grow Kits offer a step by step guide, including set up and instructions, for success.

Since then, it has focussed on sustainable management of natural resources, including soil, water, flora and fauna.Then came the COVID-19 pandemic, wiping grocery store shelves bare. Months later, the pandemics imprint is still easy to see. On receiving a flood of queries for kitchen gardening kits, 36-acre farm in Kalpakkam launched their Greens Kit, a zero-plastic concept with gro-bags made from banana stem and seeds, potting mix and detailed videos with instructions on how to grow fenugreek (methi), amaranthus, spinach, red spinach, and other varieties like ara keerai and siri keerai.I think people are growing more conscious of their food and health, and they also have more time to spend on their gardens, says founder Alladi Mahadevan. The gro-bags take very little space; and the kit is absolutely complete, so you dont have to run pillar to post to find any other material. At the end of 40-45 days, not only can you harvest and enjoy eating your greens, you can also immediately re-use the gro-bags. We provide seeds for three cycles, so you can repeat the whole cycle, or grow other suitable seeds of your choice.The farm is also introducing multi-cropping into small urban gardens by providing germinated sapling and growing many species together in the same pots and spaces. They recently also started making bamboo trellis (pandals) for balconies and terraces on which many pots can be hung. Says Alladi, These make it feasible even for small households in flats to grow their own food.(www.theorganicfarm.in)",TOMATO

There are notes on the freedom struggle (Shakuntala Devi was born in Gorakhpur, Uttar Pradesh, in 1914); her thoughts on and pride in the Swadeshi Movement; notes on the shortage of vegetables during the war with China.The co-founders: Noor Arora (right) with her mother Geeti Arora and aunt Mani Khurana (centre).As a child, I have memories of Ammaji writing in these books. None of us knew what she was writing, and we never asked, Noor says.Shakuntala Devi and her husband, a dentist, both loved to travel, so she also noted down home remedies from all over India. Near Kanyakumari, she writes of how she has found a nushka for body hair removal. She jotted down the key ingredient, but its in either Tamil or Malayalam and no one has ever been able to tell us what it is.Two years after Ammajis death, her daughter, Noors grandmother, was battling cancer with radiation treatment that scarred her skin. She needed to feel connected to her mom and took the journals out again. While reading them she found a recipe for her problem  a bunch of herbal juice extracts like mulberry, cucumber, hibiscus and lotus flower. We prepared it the way it was in the diary and her skin showed improvement. We were shocked, Noor says.Geeti then found a remedy that helped relieve her back pain. In a particularly smoggy and polluted winter, we followed a recipe for softer hair and skin  it had clove, bergamot and parsley. It worked. So we decided to make bigger batches and gift it to family and friends.Their reaction was so positive that the three women decided to take this public.Noor had returned from studying industrial design at the Parsons School of Design in New York, so she could help with branding. My mother and aunt did all the constructive work. They, like Ammaji, are strong believers that anything is doable; all you have to do is figure out how, Noor says.So far, the company offers 62 products and 138 raw ingredients at prices that range from Rs 200 to Rs 1500. Theres a First Water store in Delhi, and products retail through stores such as Spiritual Warrior in Delhi, Clove in Mumbai and Maal Gaadi in Chennai. Products are also available on websites like Nykaa, Amazon, Flipkart and Sublime. We have a lot of repeat customers, Noor says.I have been using the products since 2017, when I heard about them from common friends, says Vrinda Gupta, 28, a businesswoman from Delhi. I use the clay face mask and the face and body mist regularly. The sweet story about how she uses her great-grandmothers recipes makes them more special.That makes it more special for the family too. I feel like Ammajis passion is getting realised now, Noor says.",TOMATO

Take Armenian food. Who would have thought that one day youd get to eat dishes that are a part of life in the Eurasian country? But lets not forget that India has old links with Armenia, ever since the first traders came from there in the late 17th century. There are people of Armenian origin living mostly in Kolkata.That should explain why an intrepid chef opened a restaurant serving Armenian delicacies in south Delhi a few years ago. I wanted to try out the food, but never managed to do so. But now, I am happy to say, Sabyasachi Gorai  known widely as Chef Saby  has started a food delivery service, and on the menu are a couple of Armenian dishes.The outfit is called Sabys Deli - Soulful Decadence. I received a menu the other day and found it interesting. For those who like their fish and meat, there is Icelandic salmon steak (950 for 200g fish and 350g of mash and vegetables plus taxes), slow roasted American chicken leg and thigh (800 for 400g with bone), and Nordic lamb neck (600 for 300g of meat with bone). For vegetarians, the menu includes aglio e olio pepperoncino (450 for 500g), sauted beans and spinach (200 for 250g); spaghetti Alfredo (450), roast vegetables (200 for 250g).The produce, the Deli says, are sourced from the USA and Scandinavian countries, and then vacuum-packed and transported frozen through a cold chain. The dishes are then paired with local vegetables and oven cooked with just a little oil, it says.I can vouch for this  the food is light, yet delicious. I wanted a taste of Armenian food, so asked for the mushroom manti  Armenian ravioli stuffed with mushroom and cheese, in a tomato sauce (500 for 300g). It was superb, nicely creamy and spiced. The pasta  tossed in olive oil, black and green olives, capers and chilli flakes  was smooth and al dente (which is how I like it). I enjoyed the roasted pumpkin and carrot, too  plump pieces that had been roasted with a dash of sea salt, olive oil, fresh herbs, and whole red chillies.The lamb dish consisted of small pieces of meat on bone that had been braised for three hours with vindaloo spices. I liked the gravy; the meat had been cooked just right too. The slow roasted chicken leg and thigh (the chicken was American, and thus rather large!) was surprisingly tasty. It came with roasted vegetables, a garlic mash, and a delightful gravy flavoured with rosemary.The chicken had been marinated overnight with ginger and garlic and then slow cooked with a splash of garlic oil on a bed of vegetables, Chef Saby tells me. A smoked chilli rub was applied on the chicken, and then it was again slow cooked for a bit.I loved the dessert. Called ponchiki, this is an Armenian version of a doughnut with a filling. The patisserie includes cookies and cream (150 for 200g), a rich dry fruit cake with home-made liquor (250 for 200g), three milk cake (with condensed milk, cooking cream, and Niagara whipping cream with sugared nuts  400 for 350g), and lemon and maraschino cherry cupcakes (350 for a dozen). Selling dishes by weight is now a trend in food delivery, it seems.Food is delivered (with varying charges) across Delhi-NCR. Place your order (9910731957/ 9717714687) by 6 pm, for the next day.Chef Sabys food has re-ignited my love for travel. I am thinking of Yerevan. But first, I must get to know the food!The writer is a seasoned food critic",TOMATO

The price of the fragrant Mysuru Mallige (jasmine) and other flowers have gone up four to five times. The sky-rocketing prices are worrying both the consumers and the vendors.Buyers crowd around a jasmine vendorat a market in Mysuru on Sunday. Theprice of the flower has hit a high inrecent days | Udayshankar SJasmine which was sold at Rs 250 per kg is now a prohibitive Rs 1,500. The price of Kanakambara has jumped four times -- from Rs 200 per kg last week to Rs 800 on Sunday. Rose too which was sold at Rs 20 per kg is now Rs 240.And the gloomy news is that the prices are expected to further shoot up on Ayudha Puja and Vijayadashami when the demand will outstrip supply.Marigold and chrysanthemum are in great demand too on Ayudha Puja. These flowers, grown extensively in Panadavapura, KR Pet, Nagamanagala and Malvalli, are also destroyed by heavy rains and the resultant waterlogging in the fields.The farmers are not benefiting either. In fact, during April and May, every day, desperate flower farmers plucked around 60 lakh flowers and threw them away.This was because they had no takers due to the strict nationwide containment measures amid the coronavirus pandemic. Today, the farmers are in a similar situation as the rains have destroyed the crop.Heavy rain in parts of Karnataka affects flower supplyShivananjappa, a farmer, said that they had expected a bumper yield and also good prices during the Navaratri this week and the coming Deepavali festival. But the rain has not only flattened the plants but have also hit the plucking of flowers in some places.Gajendra, another flower grower, said that they could not send spatika or jasmine to meet the demand in Tirupati or the temples in Dakshina Kannada as the widespread rain has damaged the flower plants leaving them in the lurch. He said that prices will further go up if there is rain in the next couple of days.Mysuru market, which normally receives around 1,000 kg jasmines a day, is getting less than 300kg, leading to the steep rise in the price. The market gets flowers from T Narsipur, Heggadevana Kote, parts of Mysuru taluk and KR Pet in Mandya and Sathyamangalam in Erode district (Tamil Nadu).But the heavy rains in the old Mysuru region and in parts of neighbouring Tamil Nadu, resulted in the drastic reduction in the supply as harvesting has been affected. Sometimes flower merchants create artificial scarcity to push Ooty jasmine which has a better shelf life, say growers.But with non-stop rains in Ooty and Nilgiris, the export of Ooty jasmine to Mysuru and Bengaluru markets has been hit. Amid this withering of hopes, there are reports that many farmers growing flowers have switched over to short-term horticulture crops like brinjal, tomato and other vegetables.",TOMATO

This was the much-needed reality check he needed to correct his lifestyle and he spent the next six months transforming himself. His weight loss journey is an incredibly motivating example of how the right diet and workout can change your life. Read to know more!Jay Thaker29 years6 feet 1 inchMumbai136 kilos32 kilos6 months and 12 daysI have always been on the heavier side and used to weigh 120-125 kilos! I spent so much money on gym memberships, but since I have a travelling job, it was difficult to take time out for exercise. Having a 'sorted' routine was something I could just wish for. However, the day reality hit me is when I happened to weigh myself while I was working and saw my weight was 136 kilos! I just stood there in shock, it hit me so hard!My weight loss journey started in December 2019. I started following Intermittent Fasting, with a relatively smaller fasting window (14:10). By February 2020, I was able to stretch it to 16:8. And then, the pandemic happened. While there were so many negatives to the lockdown, I got the best gift I had been wanting for long- TIME.March was the time when I actually brought in more focus on my journey. The plan was to create a calorie deficit. I used an app, tracked my calories, and ate two meals a day (just lunch and dinner). Apart from this, I never indulged in snacking. Green tea/ coconut water were the only two things I drank. Day by day, with the help of exercise and strict diet, I managed to sustain my deficit and lose weight, the way I wanted. There were weeks I even lost more than a kilo!Since I dont eat anything in the morning, I just have a cup of green tea with lemon drops (zero calories, hence its allowed in my fasting hours)Lunch is the best part of the day for me and I ensure that my meal has wholesome nourishment. I have a complete meal (approximately 900-1000 calories), which has 2 rotis, vegetable subzi, a bowl of dal (moong, arhar), very little rice and some curd/ chaas to finish my meal.While lunch is heavy, I keep my dinners light. It is usually something like a large bowl of salad (carrots, beets, tomatoes, cucumbers, apples, pomegranates) with curd. Sometimes, I have a bowl of warm tomato soup.I used to work out in the morning time, i.e., during my fasting window. Hence, green tea is all I had.I have a scoop of protein shake powder with water after the 2nd round of my workout and sometimes after dinner as well (maintaining an hours gap).I enjoy everything home-cooked, which is balanced with carbs, proteins and fat. I have to give all the credit to my mom, who helped me! But, if I ever want to snack on something, it would be my favourite bajra thepla or pav bhaji!Exercise is something I never compromise on now! I have a fixed 2-hour workout session in the morning- one hour of rigorous badminton and an hour walking/jogging. I do the same in the evenings. Apart from this, I also try and take out 30 minutes during the day to indulge in ab workouts and weight training exercises at home. I use a resistance band which ensures that isn't too much muscle loss due to extensive cardio.Veggies+fruit salad with curd and brown bread sandwich once in a while.If you want to start your weight loss journey, learn two words and implement them  CALORIE DEFICIT. Intermittent fasting worked really well for me for keeping myself off snacking and ensuring that I create maximum calorie deficit! Additionally, I ensured to stay consistent with my efforts, eat healthily and stay hydrated.I received unconditional support from my family and friends. However, I do have to say that there is no bigger motivation than stepping on the weighing scale and seeing the reduction for yourself. I was so happy to see the number change from 131 to 98 kilos! Once I started seeing visible results, there was no looking back. Every day felt like a new learning experience for me.Discipline is the key and the belief that nothing happens overnight. Even if at some point if the results arent as per what I desire, I keep on going.I see myself as a very healthy and active individual with a bit of muscle gain.I made a lot of lifestyle changes to reach my weight loss goal. Some of them included:1. Eating balanced meals2. Following the 3 Cs for weight loss  lots of Cardio, consume fewer Carbs, be Consistent3. Discipline and determination. I started to enjoy my journey, rather than detesting it.For the first few days, when I wasn't habitual to eating healthy or working out, it was so difficult to swear off junk food. The cravings and getting used to the change were the hardest ones to cope with.Looks are secondary but the feeling you get once you are fit is a different kind of adrenaline.Is it easy? NO. Is it worth it? ABSOLUTELY!!",TOMATO

However, they have a years time to form and galvanize teams in a state with 403 assembly constituencies.Senior AAP leader Sanjay Singh said, We have ambitious plans for Uttar Pradesh but the national leadership will make the announcement at the right time. Singh has been spearheading the partys connect with the masses and had earned the wrath of the chief minister Yogi Adityanath by getting a survey done to prove caste bias in the governance of the state. About a dozen of FIRs have been lodged against him.Singh says they had won Delhi within a years time after the formation of the party in 2012 and that people, by now, are familiar with its flag, symbol, issues and leadership, the fact remains that UP is not only the largest state but also the toughest to win.Also read: Slippers hurled at Tejashwi Yadav during poll rally in BiharThe AAP started its public outreach programme via panchayats. Coming handy are about 10,000 oximeters provided to the party cadre to test oxygen levels of people during the pandemic.The oximeters are creating curiosity as well as a local connect with the people. As of now, the party has reached 3,500 gram panchayats in 345 assembly constituencies, each having a 25-member committee, according to Vaibhav Maheshwari, state spokesperson of the party.Challenges aheadThe BJP had swept the 2017 assembly polls independently winning 312 of the 403 seats, decimating Samajwadi Party and Bahujan Samaj Party that had dominated the states political scene from 1993 to 2017.Second, 302 political parties - including six national, two at the state level, five from other states and 289 registered but unrecognized - had contested the 2017 elections. Only eight parties had managed to open their account amid the BJP wave. The AAP will be thus another recognised party testing its fate in the complex state.While SP leader Akhilesh Yadav has always welcomed parties contesting polls saying more the merrier, the BSP and the Congress have maintained a silence with their leaders, perhaps, waiting for the announcement. Akhilesh also shares camaraderie with Kejriwal.The ruling BJP, upset with a telephonic survey done by the AAP on the caste leanings of the chief minister, was quick to retaliate. Secretary Chandra Mohan said, They neither were able to control tomato prices nor Covid. Yet they have the cheek to indulge in theatrics in UP. They are free to dream but more than their UP entry, they should worry about Delhi which they are set to lose. Yes, but they should come to UP to learn governance from chief minister Yogi Adityanath ji.Political expert Badri Narayan said, the AAP is a party in the making and may attract aspirational activists from the opposition parties.Also read: Chirag Paswans LJP to fight on 137 seats, releases 3rd list of candidatesTracing the electoral trajectory of new parties in the state, Narayan said, Its a long-drawn battle and requires consistent efforts as the first election is often contested to lose, second to damage others by cutting into their votes and third and fourth to defeat and finally win.UPs assemblys 403 seats are more than five times of Delhis (70), which are more urban in character. The state has a huge rural base and each region has distinct issues and complexities.AAPs movesThe AAP has been making sporadic noises in the past - this is the first time that it will contest the panchayat elections in this vast state. The party has about a year to prepare for the countrys most complex election in the largest state. Sanjay Singh confidently says, One year is enough. Now we have a governance model to showcase.Although east UP may be oblivious to the work done by Kejriwal in Delhi - from mohalla clinics to schools - western UP districts, adjoining the countrys capital, are aware of his performance. He will be a face to reckon with but can he win elections?Indeed, elections in UP have been driven either by a personality or caste and religion. The AAP has Kejriwal but its biggest challenge will be to find the right face in the state and correct the caste calculus.Though the opposition is in disarray, AAP has to create its own political space and cultivate vote base. This will be a gigantic task.Amongst the opposition parties that got decimated in 2017, SP chief Akhilesh Yadav still holds a decent amount of goodwill. Much would depend on how it gets converted into votes and how he holds his prime base vote of Yadavs and Muslims in the heat of the BJPs aggressive Hindutva agenda. He has activated the party organisation, which for the past few months, has been holding demonstrations on unemployment, law and order, poor development work, et cetera.However, he has yet to find a counter to BJPs growing appeal of Hindutva among the masses.Similarly, Mayawati has a core vote bank of Jatavs but her party has been invisible on the ground although her cadre, though disillusioned, can be activated anytime. After the AAP highlighted caste leanings of the chief minister, Mayawati deployed its veteran leader Satish Mishra once again to win back the disgruntled Brahmins.Mishra has already held about 67 meetings with Brahmins, somewhat on the lines of his about 27,000-kilometre journey in 2007 organising the Dalit-Brahmin bhoj. It had paid dividends with Mayawati breaking the coalition jinx to become the chief minister without any crutches.As for the Brahmins, they do crib about the neglect by the administration but find solace in the fact that the Ram temple in Ayodhya will be a reality. The BJP still remains their first choice.Coming to the Congress, which of late has been in the forefront of all public movements, it has more leaders than workers. The organisation had weakened in the state decades before the party slumped at the central level.Other national/state parties like RLD, CPI, CPM, NCP and other smaller ones have caste-based or regions of influence. Their outreach is not statewide.On the other hand, the BJP has a robust organisation, energetic cadre and popular face of the Prime Minister besides the RSS network. Mahant Yogi Adityanath has emerged as a hardcore politician after becoming chief minister. He is skilled in the art of elections and is hardworking, now called the 24x7 chief minister. He not only wears saffron but believes in hardcore Hindutva.A known turfOn a smaller scale, the AAP has contested elections in some other states, including Uttar Pradesh.In 2014 Lok Sabha polls, the popular face of the party, Arvind Kejriwal, had thrown down the gauntlet in Varanasi contesting against Narendra Modi, the then prime ministerial candidate of the BJP. Kejriwal saved his deposit, other opposition candidates had lost theirs. The party was then riding high as it had defeated Congress heavyweight chief minister Shiela Dixit in the Delhi polls.The scenario, however, is different today.",TOMATO

The government has termed the initiative as the first of its kind in the country.The base price has been arrived at by calculating the production cost plus 20% on the basis of a study conducted by the State Agricultural Prices Board. To curb malpractice, the government has also fixed a ceiling for per-hectare productivity for each of the items.The base prices (a kg) are as follows: tapioca (12), Nendran banana/Wayanadan Nendran (30/24), pineapple (15), ash gourd (9), cucumber (8), bitter gourd (30), snake gourd (30), string beans (34), tomato (8), ladies' finger (20), cabbage (11), carrot (21), potato (20), beans (28), beet root (21) and garlic (139).In the event of the market prices of the aforementioned items falling below the base price in a district, a district-level committee will declare the base price as having come into force in that district. The quality of produce will be a criterion.To become eligible, farmers have to upload the area of their farmland, data on sowing, expected harvest and harvest time before the season on the web portal www.aims.kerala.gov.in. The AIMS mobile app is downloadable from Google Play Store. They should also avail themselves of crop insurance. A farmer will be eligible for base price for a maximum of 15 acres in a season.The Agriculture Department has joined hands with the Local Self-Government Department and the Cooperation Department to introduce the pricing, Agriculture Minister V.S. Sunil Kumar said. The produce will be procured through the outlets of the department, VFPCK and Horticorp, and the Primary Agricultural Credit Cooperative Societies, Mr. Sunil Kumar said.At present, the Centre declares Minimum Support Price (MSP) for 22 products, primarily grains, pulses and oil seeds, paddy and copra, ahead of the season. Only the MSP for paddy and copra are mainly relevant in the case of Kerala, according to the Agriculture Department.",TOMATO

Vegetable sellers said that the prices have increased due to low supply and the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, and claimed that they are getting the vegetables at high rates from the mandis.On Wednesday, a visit to Noidas Indira Market in Sector 27 found that potatoes and onions were being sold at 50 and 60 per kg. In July-August, the retail prices of potatoes and onions in the city were in the range of 25-30 and 35-40 per kg, respectively, according to sellers and residents.Residents said that the prices of several vegetables have been soaring for the past three-four months. Sanjeev Kumar, a resident of Noida Sector 51, said that he had visited Harola market on Tuesday for vegetables. I bought potatoes at the rate of 45 per kg. I did not buy onions as the Navratra festival is going on. The price rise has affected many people, specially the weaker section of society. This should be checked, he said.Raju Kumar, a vegetable seller at Indira Market, said that prices have increased due to the coronavirus outbreak and high demand. We buy vegetables from mandis at Bhangel and Phase 2 in Noida, and Azadpur and Okhla in Delhi. In wholesale markets, the prices have increased and hence we have to raise the rates too, he said.The rates of other vegetables have also increased. Sunil Kumar, another vegetable seller, said that tomatoes are being sold at 60 per kg and cauliflower 80 per kg. The vegetable market is down since the coronavirus outbreak. We have to manage the transportation cost and manpower. Prices have increased due to low supply, he said.However, the Uttar Pradesh government has asked the district administrations across the state to check the rates of potatoes and onions, saying that the rates of these vegetables in the wholesale mandis are significantly low. Manoj Singh, additional chief secretary, UP government, on October 10 wrote a letter to the district administrations over price rise of potatoes, tomatoes, and onions. In mandis, the prices per quintal of potatoes are 2,320-2,820; tomatoes 2,000-3,646; and onions 1,430-3,380. The local price rise is due to hoarding and black-marketing of goods, the letter stated.Noida city magistrate Umashankar Singh said, We have not received any complaint from residents about the price hike. We will talk to the different stakeholders to check the prices of these vegetables.Santosh Kumar, secretary, wholesale sabzi mandi at Noida Phase 2, said that the prices of vegetables have increased in the past three months. Most of the vegetables in Noida markets come from other states like Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh. The import is less due to adverse weather conditions, he said.Kumar said that the price also depends on the quality of vegetables. The wholesale rate of onion is 40; potato 30 and tomato 25 per kg, he said.Suhas LY, Gautam Budh Nagar district magistrate, said that he has received the government order on vegetable price hike.

The prices of onions, potatoes, beans and other vegetables have almost doubled in Gurugram in the past two weeks.In October, the inflation rate of vegetables has soared to 25%. Vendors said the prices are not likely to come down in the coming days. Notably many families eat vegetarian food during the nine days of Navratri festival and the sudden hike in prices has affected such families the most.Potato, which generally costs Rs 20 to Rs 30 per kg round the year, is being sold at Rs 60 these days. Similarly, the price of onion has increased from Rs 30 to Rs 80 per kg and tomato prices have risen to Rs 80 per kg.Meanwhile, residents have demanded the district administration to look into the matter. Along with the prices of green vegetables, the cost of the potato and onion has also increased alarmingly owing to which salaried people like us are having a tough time, said Sector 56 resident Nidhi Srivastava.A vegetable vendor in this sector Bhagat Kumar blamed the untimely rains for the steep increase. Dev Kumar, president of Gurugram Sadar Bazar vegetable market vendor association, said that prices of vegetables and fruits have increased sharply at the Azadpur Mandi. Prices of tomatoes and onions had already increased due to the rains in Karnataka. Unfavourable weather and rising fuel prices have affected vegetable supply, leading to a steep rise in prices, he added.Arvind Kumar, who runs an eatery in Sector 18 said that he has stopped serving salad to his customers since the past few days. However fruit vendor Ranjan Singh said that a marginal increase in fruit price was a common affair during Durga Puja and Diwali. While the possibilities of regular supply of vegetables have cooled down the prices in the wholesale market, the retail market is yet to see a reduction.PS Dalal, a wholesale onion trader in Khandsa Mandi, said that the cost of transportation has increased compared to last year and especially over the past few days.

He also instructed the officials of the Horticulture department to examine the possibilities of increasing onion cultivation extent and production during the Yasangi season.The Minister told the marketing department officials to continue the sale of onion at subsidised rate of 35 per kg in Rythu Bazaars till the retail sale prices in the market came down.

For, the mandi is shut as traders are protesting against Income Tax raids on 14 of them as also the mindless stock limit imposed by the Central government.Activity at Lasalgaon matters as a whopping 35% of Indias onion supply chain is sourced from that mandi.Sulking traders are adding to the stress the kitchen staple is already facing because of heavy rains damaging the standing crop, pushing the average retail price across the country to around Rs 90 per kg (see box).Retail prices in Telangana are particularly swollen (Hyderabad Rs 130-150; Warangal Rs 100-120; Karimnagar Rs 100) as supplies from Maharashtra are just a trickle.Caught between the government and the trading community is the aam aadmi, who is being forced to reduce his onion intake.Many people have stopped buying the king of the kitchen for now, revealed vegetable trader Pritam Das in Jaipur.Till about a few days ago when Lasalgaon was a beehive of activity, onion arrivals were in the range of 70,000 to 75,000 tonnes per day as against the normal of 1.25 lakh to 1.50 lakh tonnes. In other words, a drop of 40-50%, informed Nanasaheb Patil, an onion growing farmer leader in Nasik.Lasalgaon gets ample supplies in August from states like Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana after harvest. But this year, the standing crop in all the three states was damaged by the rains. In the first week of October, onions normally start arriving into the mandi from Maharashtra, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh. But floods in parts of Maharashtra damaged both the old stock and fresh crops. As a result, new arrivals have been delayed by 40-60 days, Patil shared.In Karnataka, extended monsoon in Chitradurga, Ballari, Gadag, Dharwad, Haveri and Chikkamagaluru districts contributed to the super spike in prices.Although normally there is spike in onion prices in November-December because the March stocks tend to get exhausted and the October harvest cannot be dried and stored for long, this years rise is because around 70,000 hectares in Karnataka got affected by the monsoon, said B N Prasad, managing director of Horticultural Producers Cooperative Marketing and Processing Society).Soaring onion prices leave traders, household in tearsIn Karnatakas Chitradurga, its Nayakanahatti region produces export quality onion. But this year a purple blotch disease attributed to heavy showers led to bulb rot, said Nulenuru T Shankarappa, a farmer. Going forward, farmers are now again sowing onion seeds in the region.Since it is a three-month crop, we can expect some good produce by January-end, he added while keeping his fingers crossed. Another bee in the wholesale traders bonnet is the stock limit of 25 metric tonnes imposed recently by the Centre to cool down prices.For big traders like me this limit is ridiculously low. As we cannot do business in such an environment, I have decided not to participate in the auctioning at Lasalgaon, said a trader requesting anonymity.Raids on 14 Lasangaon traders to force them to fall in line and reduce onion prices added to the drama.We are in a Catch 22 situation, said Suvarna Jagtap, chairman of the Lasalgaon mandi.On the one side farmers are desperate to sell their summer stock but on the other, traders do not want to lift them because of the Centres policies. This will damage the farmers and consumer will end up paying high prices, she feared.Rashi Gupta, who lives in Jaipurs Jawahar Nagar colony said We are now cutting down on the use of onions as we have already suffered due to lockdown. But our home budget has gone bust due to spike in onion prices.Even potato and tomato prices are soaring. For a middle class family like ours, which runs on a limited income, there is no option but to reduce buying of these vegetables.

Around 11:30 AM, I would have a glass of lemon juice or chaas(with 1 tablespoon ajwain) or coconut water.Sometimes bowl of leafy vegetables with 2 chapatis and chaas or 5 tablespoons of fresh Curd/or saute veggies with 2-3 low-fat khakras.I was also having a bowl of daliya with veggies on days.2 hours later, a cup of green tea with a biscuit.At 6 PM strictly, I would have a glass of lemon juice or a handful of dry fruits.A while later, I would snack on fruit like apple or pear. If my dinner was delayed due to any reason, I would eat another fruit.Usually flexible in my case, I used to have it between 8 and 9 pm. It would usually be a soup of 2 tomatoes + 0.5 carrot + small bowl of bottleguard + small bunch of coriander + 0,5 capsicum + 0.5 red capsicum + 15 palak leaves & 1 wheat chapati + veggies + 5 tb dahi / Besan Chilla x 2 / Khakra x 3 with saute veggies and soup / Vegetable toast sandwich without cheese, butter, potatoes & soup.Also, I used to eat eggs and a lot of poha . My body got used to this disciplined form of eating so well, every time I tried to cheat on my diet, or ate junk food, I would develop IBS. Maybe it was my body's way of telling me what I am eating is wrong! Even if I do cheat now, I go for healthier options such as the buddha bowl, egg dishes or healthy sandwiches.As per my nutritionists guidance, she instructed me to not even look at the gym initially as I just needed to cut down the extra fat to function injury-free.Once, I hit the 120kilo mark, she advised me to brisk walk for 30 mins post dinner. The aim was to start full-fledged workouts including weight training and high-intensity workouts once I near the 100kg mark. So once I was there, I started hitting the gym with the objectives of increasing stamina, working out at high heart rates and as a result strengthening my core, back and all muscles. Weight loss coupled with focused fitness workouts are the best thing that ever happened to me. After a successful run of 7 months of heavyweight training and HIITs, I met with an unfortunate injury. I tore my right wrist ligament which also happens to by my frequented hand. I had to get surgery done. Soon after, I developed problems with my left hand too. I realized it was time to go slow.That is when I took complete rest from work and within days, the lockdown happened which meant staying home completely. Due to the lockdown, both my wrists got adequate rest, and therefore, the healing process started and my injuries got completely recovered in two months. From September, I have again started with my fitness training with a lot of cardio, as I have to build the stamina levels which Ive lost due to the long break from working out.I dont count my calories. Its the worst thing to do. Neither do I eat less. I eat right. This should be the mantra. Dont count your calories, dont eat less, JUST EAT RIGHT.Being punctual and sticking to a set of formed discipline is the most impactful. It might sound clich, but it really helped. Theres a reason why I have written STRICTLY against all timings of my daily routine, I have followed it with utmost punctuality. It works like magic. Second fitness secret is a secret in the form of a natural ingredient which is WATER. A thing that never changes in the 10-day diet alterations is the water intake. I drink at least 5L of water each day. This helps in great aqua levels of my body, keeps my well hydrated and fresh. Ensures toxins are flushed out regularly and allows effective metabolism to take place.The positive results keep me motivated to do better and better and when the goals and targets are clear, then theres nothing that can stop me personally. After a while, when people start noticing, they start heaping praises for you. They are my biggest motivation. I enjoyed being fat-shamed because it only made me mentally strong and I knew I was being criticised for not doing the right thing. My mind is programmed to be that of a leader and a leader needs to accept criticism from people and turn the tide in his favour by doing the right things. The mentality helps you win.By visiting my nutritionist every 10 days for regular consultation. Its all psychological science which is absolutely sensational if you ask me.: Not being able to fit into clothes that youd want to wear, demanding an extension to fasten the seat belt in an aircraft is not easy. I used to run out of breath so often. Being always injury prone and stereotyped. It was all so emotionally draining.:I never wanted to get slim, but always wanted to be fit. I am around 511 and I want to be in a good shape, well-built with strong muscles.: When I was overweight, I used to visit my tailor so often. Jokes aside, I have started talking to people more about health and fitness and how it can be a lifestyle worth being adopted. Now, I dont starve at all and carry my food along if I know its going to be outdoors and irregular for me.While the diet was super successful for me, it came at a cost. I had consciously taken a decision to cut myself off from my partying friends. But I was lucky to have a few really close friends to support me at that point.Never ever fall into the high weight trap. Control it from the right age. It affects a person in a 360* way. Be a winner. Have control on your mind, influence yourself to do whats right. Be an inspiration and a role model for others who are still sailing in the previous boat that youve jumped from.",TOMATO

This process may be less problematic for opponents of GM despite discussions on the technologys potential to impact human heredity. The Indian research is, however, on crops.Unlike GM (transgenic) technology which introduces foreign DNA (like insertion from a different species), gene-editing modifies existing genes in a precise manner by making specific targeted changes in the genome of an organism. But since there is a possibility of gene-editing also inserting new genetic material of different species, regulators are wary of taking a final decision on guidelines.Many people are confused that gene-editing is like genetic engineering (transgenic system). But here we have to distinguish which is a normal breeding-like approach within the genera, said R S Paroda, eminent agriculture scientist and former director general of Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR). Gene-editing should not be treated as transgenic and it should not come under the same regulatory system which has been regulating GM crops, he said.The programmable gene-editing system allows scientists to make changes in the genome of an organism to come out with nutrient rich, high yielding, disease resistant, herbicide tolerant and abiotic stress tolerant varieties of crops which can substantially reduce input costs of farmers.Among the various methods of gene-editing, the CRISPR-Cas9 system, developed by Charpentier and Doudna, is considered the most favoured for being precise and a sharp tool for geneediting.Since utilising genetic variation to develop new crop varieties through conventional breeding needs years of effort comprising cross pollination, rigorous selection of progeny for individuals with desired traits, scientists in US, Japan, Australia, China and Brazil are preferring CRISPR-Cas9 which can create desired variations more precisely and without affecting other characters of a variety.This enables new varieties to be produced quicker and enables breeders to significantly cut down on time, labour and cost, said Paroda.In India, the DBTs National Agri-Food Biotechnology Institute, Mohali is using CRISPR-Cas9 to carry out a change in bananas. Besides the ICAR institutes are also involved in application of this technology for enhancing stress tolerance and nutritional quality in a number of crops.The Hyderabad-based International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) has signed an agreement with US-based Corteva AgriScience, which holds license for MIT and Harvard CRISPR technologies, to get access to CRISPR related resources for crop improvement.The CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing technique has opened enormous opportunities for creating at will desired variations in crop plants, animals, fish and microorganisms. Scaling this disruptive innovation would not only help in meeting sustainable development goals (SDGs) but would ensure global food, nutrition and environmental security, said Paroda.Since new crop varieties do not contain foreign genetic material, many countries like the USA, Japan and Australia have exempted such edited variants from regulations.In Video: Indian scientists make progress in gene-editing tech after years of neglect",TOMATO

Be it the mushy brown-covered potatoes, or the squishy red tomatoes, theyve all put a hole through the purse, thanks to the pandemic, the lockdown and the latest addition to the list  heavy rains.Data suggests that a majority of the households in the State paid 25 to 100 per cent more for procuring these three essential vegetables, as the supply has been hit by the flash floods. Local Circles, one of Indias leading community social media platform, conducted a pan-India survey which included 1,940 responses across the State (of which 1,355 were from Chennai). According to the data, 71 per cent people paid over Rs 40 and Rs 50 for one kilogram of potato and onion, respectively. Interestingly, when the survey was conducted in September, it was found that 61 per cent of the people paid over Rs 30 and Rs 25 for the same quantity of items.This means, the average retail price paid by a majority of households rose by 30 per cent for potatoes and over 100 per cent for onions, while the price fell by 15 per cent for tomatoes, says Sachin Taparia, founder and chairman of Local Circles.Individual data suggests that about 42 per cent people bought tomato at Rs 30 to 40, potato at Rs 60 or higher, and onions at Rs 70 or higher in the State. This is indicative of a significant squeeze, given the fact that many households have faced loss of earnings or employment during the pandemic. Sectors like tourism, hospitality and restaurants have also faced cutbacks as people continue to limit movement because of the Covid fear, the study stated.The rise in prices of household necessities have only added to the burden of homemakers, especially those from low-income earning households. The survey is part of a continuous effort by Local Circles to bring the attention of concerned authorities to the issue. Taparia said, the prices rise could also hit the festive spending, which could come down by 33 per cent. Last year, about 78 per cent consumers shopped for household items, and it is coming down to 61 per cent this year, he added.Abdul Khader, secretary of Koyambedu Vegetable Wholesale Merchants Association, said the prices of potato and onions have gone up due to shortage in supplies. In Chennai, the wholesale price of onion is Rs 70 and in retail it is priced around Rs 90 to 100. However, tomato prices have come down drastically and is now available for Rs 30 a kilogram in retail.While a few traders believe that the prices in and around Chennai could be cheaper with retail outlets opening in Koyambedu market soon, it would depend on the availability and supply of the crop, said Khader.S Chandran, president of Market Management Committee and Licensed Merchants Association and general secretary of Anaithu Sangankalin Kootamaipu told TNIE that the opening of retail and semi-wholesale shops on November 16 would reduce prices by at least Rs 1 to 5 per kilogram.",TOMATO

A crate carries 22 kg to 25 kg, leaving farmers with a poor margin per kg.The retail price of tomatoes were, however, double the price offered to farmers, with tomatoes being sold at 15 per kg in the retail market. But for the growers, the price per crate at the Rayakottai tomato mandi has offered little comfort. The price per crate offered at the mandi does not offset the other expenses related to transportation of the produce, say farmers.The retail price of tomatoes has hovered between 7 and 15 depending on the location. For the farmers, the cost of production will be met only if the price per kg was above 20, says Krishnan, a tomato farmer from Rayakottai. We spend 40,000 per acre including the labour costs. The current prices would barely meet the costs. Growers will find a reasonable profit only if crates sold for 300 or 400. Otherwise, we will have to migrate to other crops, says Krishnan, who himself has diversified to flowers given the tomato prices. Tomato production had increased over the last few months, with good rainfall and increased area of cultivation. But, this has hit the prices for farmers, with the supply overwhelming the demand.In Shoolgiri, some of the tomato growing areas had seen dumping of their produce in the lakes nearby owing to diseased crops adding to the woes of the growers.",TOMATO

The Opposition demanded a voting before discussion on the resolution, leading to multiple disruptions in House proceedings on the second day of the Vidhan Sabhas resumed monsoon session. Eventually, the Congress MLAs were named by the Speaker and forced out of the House.Congress legislators subsequently protested against the farm laws outside the Vidhan Sabha complex. Earlier in the day, all Congress legislators reached the House walking and holding placards, demanding that the government must give a guarantee of Minimum Support Price (MSP) to the farmers, for which another legislation should be brought in.The proceedings got disrupted multiple times as Congress legislators demanded a voting on the farm laws. However, rejecting the Oppositions demand, Speaker Gian Chand Gupta told the Opposition that a short notice was received from Bhupinder Hooda to hold a discussion on the farm legislations that would be allowed after finishing other business. Adamant on its demand, the Opposition walked out and protested outside the complex.INLDs Abhay Chautala too slammed the ruling government and dared Chief Minister Khattar to accompany him to any mandi in the state in a private vehicle. If you will go to a mandi as a chief minister, your officers will bring 7-8 farmers in front of you who will praise the system. But, if you want to see the actual picture you should accompany me in a private vehicle. Lets go to a mandi and you will be able to see the ground reality yourself, he said.These three farm legislations are going to ruin the farmers. It will also impact the PDS ration scheme. We wanted a voting in the House so that the entire state could see that who all were in favour of these three farm legislations and who were against it. But the Speaker rejected our demand. When we kept raising our demand, the Speaker named us and we were forced to leave the House, Hooda said while talking to mediapersons outside the Vidhan Sabha.We will continue our protest against these three farm laws until the government comes out with a fourth legislation guaranteeing MSP to farmers for his crop. Wherever, whenever we get a chance, we shall continue to raise farmers voice and we shall go to any extent so that these black laws are not implemented in Haryana, Hooda added.Earlier inside the House, Hooda also quoted government figures and said that the state government was itself backing away from MSP. Various agencies are indicating it. That is the reason the farmer is forced to come out on the road and protest against these farm legislations. A voting needs to be held to find out how many of this 90-member House are in favour or against these farm legislations so that people of Haryana can also see who all are their actual well wishers.Talking to mediapersons, Hooda said, Because of these three farm legislations, the MSP and mandi system will vanish gradually. Not only the farmers, but the poor who are dependent on PDS ration will also be severely affected with this. The manner in which government agencies are withdrawing from purchasing farmers crop, clearly shows that the PDS ration will also be impacted with this. It is all due to this governments anti-farmer policies that traders are purchasing onions for Rs 3-4 per kg from farmers and selling it to the consumer at Rs 100 per kg. Similar is the case of tomato that is also being purchased for the same price but sold to consumer for Rs 80-100 per kg.BJP-JJP government wanted to run away from the discussion on these legislations. That is why they disallowed Oppositions demand and did not bother to increase this sessions duration and restricted it to two days only, Hooda added.Oppositions behaviour extremely irresponsible: KhattarAfter the Houses proceedings concluded, Khattar spoke with mediapersons and lashed out at Congress, calling their behaviour inside the House extremely irresponsible and against the principles of democracy.Discussion was held on the farm legislations. Our friends from Congress had been misleading farmer organisations to protest against the legislations. They have a political agenda, that came to the fore today. They said they wanted to have a discussion on it. They first brought a private Bill. We took legal opinion and found that such a private Bill could not be brought in the House. Then, Congress said they wanted to move a resolution. But, a resolution needs to be given 15 days in advance. However, they have moved it three days ago, said the CM.He further said, The language used in the resolution was not correct. They just wanted to condemn. Then they said they would bring a short-notice. We agreed and told them that we would hold discussion. When, we started to hold discussion on it, they got adamant on first getting the voting done. But how could voting be done without a discussion in the House on the subject? Speaker told them that whosoever from their side would like to speak on the issue, they would be given adequate time and they would be allowed to speak till whatever time they want. But, for two hours they just kept disrupting the proceedings of the House and did not agree to hold any discussion. It is probably for the first time, when the ruling party is wanting to hold a discussion on an issue in the House and Opposition avoided it. They did not have any issue to raise. It is a democratic setup. They could raise their voice, but a discussion should be held since their opinion on a subject differs from ours. But how could it be done without a discussion? It was an irresponsible behaviour of the Opposition. They just wanted to show people that they were protesting. Congress thinks that it will be able to mislead farmers. But, farmers know the truth and shall not be misled, Khattar told mediapersons. The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

Instead of fireworks, bring home a seed cracker that would burst into a plant.Concerned about noise, air and light pollution from firecrackers affecting birds and animals, a group has developed a unique concept  BeejParva or seed crackers - to celebrate an eco-friendly festival this year.Women from 40 families, part of the Gram Art Project (GAP), a collective of farmers, painters, social workers, and writers from Paradsinga village in Chhindwara district, on the border of Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra, have made exact replicas of firecrackers (available in markets  see image) using recyclable material embedded with seed balls.Rather than bursting them, these uniquely designed crackers, which have seven different variations can be sowed in a pot, watered, and nourished into an edible plant.There is an urgent need to address the impacts of our actions on voiceless species like birds and animals that suffer miserably due to the use of firecrackers during festivals like Diwali every year. Thus, we came up with this idea that not only benefits them but the overall environment while ensuring the concept also upholds the symbol of this festival, said Shweta Bhattad, visual artist and member, GAP.The variations of plant species and types of crackers include the micro-green ladi (series of crackers that have seven types of seeds in them - red amaranthus, amaranth, fenugreek, common purslane, mustard, green amaranthus, and spinach). This cracker has seven pairs of micro-green seeds for each day of the week. One simply needs to separate each pair, sow them in different pots and water regularly, and can be consumed within a month, said Nutan Dwivedi, another member.Other seed crackers include the phoenix chakkar (using onion seeds), hemp bomb (roselle seeds), golden shower (amaranthus seeds), laxmi bomb (bauhinia racemosa seeds), coriander tikli (coriander seeds), and cucumber rocket (cucumber and green sorrel seeds).The growth of the plant has been designed similar to the emitting trajectory of a cracker. For example, the anar firecracker (flower pot) forms a shower of colours when lit. Similarly, the golden shower (amaranthus) forms the same pattern when nourished into a plant.A normal series of crackers (ladi) lasts hardly seven seconds even after having more than a dozen crackers in it creating both noise and air pollution. On the contrary, if you nurture the hatcher ladi, the plant will last for more than seven generations. Instead of creating pollution and disrupting the ecosystem, it will rejuvenate it, said Roshni Narnawre, member of the group.The group has been working with environmentalist and IT professional Arundhati Mhatre in Mumbai to share the concept among nature lovers in the city. The concept took me by surprise when I learnt that all the crackers were handmade, and so much thought had gone behind this. Such projects need to be replicated in different regions while also nurturing the livelihood of communities working on them. In this case, the use of art to create something so meaningful in an attempt to conserve nature is the need of the hour, said Mhatre adding that apart from the ladi, which is priced at 50 apiece, all other seed crackers are priced at 40.Bhattad added that GAP generally has 100 families from across 10 villages involved in seed band projects. However, due to the Covid-19 pandemic, we had to restrict our work to the closest villages. For BeejParva, we had ladies from 40 families from two villages, she said.Seed-sweets an alternative to expensive sweets this DiwaliNot just crackers but the group of women from GAP have also made seed-sweets are an alternative to expensive sweets available in the market during Diwali. These seed-sweets are seed balls made from waste paper and are biodegradable. They can be consumed once nurtured after sowing and watering. They are alternatives to sweets during festivals with main ingredients as sugar and palm oil. We intended to highlight the burden of overworked sugarcane farmers across the country while habitat degradation to recover palm oil from monoculture plantations, said Dwivedi. The four variations of the seed-sweets include palm-oil free laddu with tomato and radish seeds, what-less cookies with brinjal and common purslane seeds, sugar-free barfi with okra and amaranthus seeds, and sovereign cham-cham with chilli and carrot seeds.",TOMATO

This means you need to be more vigilant while buying packaged items now.Six months ago 30,000 kilograms of fake cumin powder made from stone powder and broom bits was seized. A month ago 300 kilograms of khoya was seized crossing many State borders as it made its way from Delhi to Bhopal to Mumbai. The fake khoya is made from milk that contains melamine, a nitrogen-rich compound that increases the protein count falsely in dairy products. Other common adulterants in food items include high doses of sulphur dioxide in sugar, washing soda and chalk powder in jaggery, brick and saw dust in chilli powder, and soap stone powder in asafoetida.Nakul Pasricha, president ASPA (Authentication Solution Provider's Association), quotes from the State of Counterfeiting in India 2020 report that reveals a whopping 24% increase in counterfeiting incidents in the country since 2018. ""The burden of discerning the authenticity of products has fallen on the customer,"" he says.Suresh Sati, the founder-director of Fake Free India Foundation, agrees, The counterfeiters have exploited the pandemic this year as an opportunity to further push a parallel illicit economy. He says its almost impossible to identify a fake product on the shelf, adding that adulteration is dangerous for health in the long run. There are inspection challenges because of online shopping, where its even more difficult to track the offenders.Check the packagingWhen you are picking up stuff directly off the shelf, examine the packaging carefully because product labelling reveals many secrets. There are both subtle and visible differences in the logo, size, and colours used, or minor spelling errors. Many brands use anti-counterfeiting solutions such as special packaging layers and features, security holograms, SMS verification, QR code, or a scratch code. Look for the FSSAI mark that grants a license to authentic manufacturers and products. Check the nutrition label carefully. Fake items usually have some discrepancy in listing the ingredients with either something extra or missing. Check manufacturing and expiry date. If the date seems to be way too long ago or if it is damaged or not clearly visible, then that is likely recycled packaging with fake contents.Be alert to the contentsNote inconsistency in the texture, smell, and colour of the product because a responsible and reputed brand would never compromise on the quality of their products, says Pasricha. Chemical dyes copper sulphate, malachite green, oxytocin saccharin wax are commonly injected in vegetables that make them shine. If a food item has an unnatural glow and looks glossy (like wax coated apples or a packet of frozen shiny peas), you should probably avoid it.Stay proactiveAlways demand a proper bill for the product purchased. It helps to be suspicious of deals that sound too good to be true, says Sati. Download the Smart Consumer App launched by the Ministry of Consumer Affairs and FSSAI to get accurate information about packaged food items.Shop safe onlineWhile making an online purchase, beware of illegitimate websites. Spam mails often redirect you to fake sites, says Pasricha. He advocates shopping only with authorised vendors, who have lock icons as their security certificate. Better still, purchase from the brands own website.You can lodge a complaint withThe police station of the jurisdiction where you find the adulterated productThe Health Inspector or senior officials of the public health department at the district/State level or health officials of Corporations, municipalities and urban local bodiesThe district commissionerThe district or State consumer forum such as the Tamil Nadu State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission, Chennai, which also gives online links for district forums to lodge local complaintsFSSAI through the online platform Food Safety Voice or call on dedicated 24X7 toll free helpline number 1800112100The last resort is to file a case in consumer court.NUMBERS SPEAK600+The number of raids Sati has conducted on behalf of companies and brands in the last four decades.

Make a paratha with it.Perhaps one of the best options left is to go for a leftover makeover. Leftovers are a reality in any kitchen and all of us would have tried to transform them with a few makeovers. Those looking for more options may find #loveyourleftover on Instagram a useful hashtag to follow. So widespread is the leftover makeover habit, that it finds place in some standup comedy acts too.Rice for instance, is very popular for its many makeover avatars; simple steamed rice is easily consumed in the form of pulihora, vegetarian or non-vegetarian fried rice, baath, appam, snacks, sweets and more. Leftover rice also finds a mention in Australian chef Kylie Kwongs recipes. During summer in some parts of India, leftover rice, is left to ferment overnight and consumed the next morning with a choice of sides.During the lockdown, when actor Sameera Reddy along with her mother-in-law Manjri Varde showed a quick recipe of rotla made with leftover rice, it garnered over five million views on Instagram. In her messy mama series, Sameera admitted that unlike others, she had nothing fancy to show for her cooking skills. She adds, But I have the rotla from leftover rice. The video was appreciated because of the simplicity of the dish and the fact that it required no extra ordinary culinary skills. All one has to do is soak leftover rice in some curd, add chopped chillies, onions, coriander leaves and chilli powder, then add some flour and make it into a soft dough, roll it into a shapeless roti, drizzle some oil, cook until crisp.Raipur-based food photographer and author of My Indian Kitchen Swayampurna Mishra however, likes to give her leftover rice a fancy twist. She loves making something like arancini. She says, Arancini is made with leftover risotto. However I do something similar with basmati rice instead of arborio, because, lets face it, no one makes risotto enough to have leftovers. I add some spices to the rice, which is slightly overcooked. Then add paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, oregano and salt and cracked black pepper. I also make a filling with sun-dried tomato pesto or roasted red bell pepper pure. To make them, wet your hands and spread a spoonful of the rice-spice mix, add a little cream cheese or mozzarella, add the filling (make it slightly spicy for a real flavour bomb), add a bit more rice on top and shape into balls. Once this is done, dip them in egg (beaten, of course), coat with fine breadcrumbs (I use only panko breadcrumbs, but grind it a bit for a finer texture). Add seasoning to the crumbs before rolling in the rice balls. Fry in oil, remove, drain on kitchen napkin and serve immediately with your choice of condiment.Deep Fried Mushroom Risotto Balls with Fresh Italian Parsley and Parmesan Cheese-Photographed on Hasselblad H1-22mb CameraHowever, Swayampurnas go-to leftover makeover recipe is the matar (peas) paratha. She says It is easy and my absolute favourite.Mumbai-based blogger Kalyan Karmakar, in one of his blogposts, mentions how he repurposed leftovers from the fridge into spectacular dishes during the lockdown. He also says #loveyourleftover has been his anthem during this time. I love using leftover kebabs to make kathi rolls for breakfast. I made a truly epiphanic lunch with orange emulsion that accompanied a dish  an almond and coriander-crusted John Dory  I had ordered from the Trident BKC. I had a feeling that it would go well with offal. I took out some chicken liver from the freezer, thawed it and tossed it in a pan with sliced onions, green capsicum salt and pepper in olive oil. I added a bit of the orange emulsion to the sauteed chicken liver at the end before turning off the flame. Any longer and it would get burnt and bitter. I drizzled in a bit more of the orange emulsion on the plate before serving it with grilled sourdough bread.He adds, Later a reader, Rahul Jha, DM-ed me on Instagram saying that Heston Blumenthal apparently has a dish called meat meets fruit, which also involves liver, orange and sourdough.The trick with dalDid you know that leftover dal can be used to knead flour and the resultant rotis or parathas turn out soft, fluffy and tasty? Hyderabad-based home baker Arundati Rao often mentions this during her cooking classes. She says plain leftover dal made with red lentil and tuvar is best to knead flour with. Alternatively, if there is too much left over, add chopped onions, chillies and spices to turn your dal into a dhaba-style dal tadka.Kalyan also alters gravy from chicken curry by adding boiled eggs and turning it into egg curry.

The rates have spiralled mostly because of the lack of supplies, which have been hit because the borders are sealed and the trucks carrying vegetables are stuck.The prices of vegetables have seen a 20-25% rise in the wholesale market, while the rates in the retail market have almost doubled in the past one week.Dev Kumar, president of the Gurugram Sadar Bazar vegetable market vendors association, said the sealing of borders had affected the supply of vegetables and fruits to the Azadpur mandi. Gurugram is totally dependent on the Azadpur mandi. We are now feeling the heat of the farmers protest. Azadpur has seen a shortage of supply since Friday. This has had a cascading effect on the price of vegetables and fruits. Since the trucks are stuck for long, many of the items are getting spoilt, he added.Vendors feared the prices are unlikely to come down in the next few days if the protests continue. Potato, which usually costs Rs 20-30 a kilo round the year, is now being sold for Rs 60. Similarly, the price of onion has increased from Rs 40 to Rs 80 per kg. A kilo of tomato is selling at Rs 80.PS Dalal, a wholesale trader at Khandsa mandi, said that during this time of the year, a new crop of potatoes usually comes from Punjab and Himachal Pradesh. But the supplies have been hit now because not only are trucks stuck at the borders, transporters are also reluctant to send new vehicles as they fear the protests can turn violent anytime.Vegetable supplies from Sonipat, Rohtak and Fatehabad have been hit badly because of the protests. They have stopped the supply of vegetables, fruits, milk and other items to cities. Naturally, the prices have soared in the wake of dwindling supplies, Dalal said.Traders in the retail markets, which cater directly to the city residents, are also feeling the pinch.There is a 30-40% drop in supplies since Saturday. On Sunday, the wholesale prices were up by about 20%, said Amit Kumar, a trader at Khandsa.The protests have also cut short milk supply. The milk plants in Gurugram and Faridabad received 5,862 litres on Sunday against a daily average of 76,000 litres. However, a senior official at one of the plants assured they have sufficient stock of milk and the supply would not be affected much. However, he warned milk supply from his plant could be hit if the agitation continued for long.",TOMATO

He was here to inspect the arrangements for the conclusion of the month-long Vertivel Yatra. Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan would participate at the concluding event of the yatra at Tiruchendur on December 7.Murugan said the state government should consider the reservation sought by the PMK, for which the BJPs ally is organising intensive protests in Chennai.Talking about the farm Acts, he said the Union government had implemented them after studying the needs of farmers, their long demand of empowering them to fix the right price for their produce and the Swaminathan committee report. Murugan added that the Acts would empower farmers to fix the price for their produce.There are times when the price of tomato falls to Re 1 or Rs 2 per kilogram. Unable to sell it, they are used as cattle feed. According to the Acts, farmers can enter into an agreement with a company to sell the same for Rs 30 or Rs 50 per kg, even if the price crashes locally, Murgan said.The Acts also facilitate multinational companies to establish cold storage facilities which will reflect in increased production. It will also help farmers directly export, he said.The central government is holding talks with farmers protesting in Delhi though they are instigated by political parties. Farmers here know the DMKs venomous and false propaganda. So, they did not give way for such protests here, he added.Commenting on Rajinikanths pending decision on entering politics, he said the actor is a spiritual person with nationalist ideologies.

(Source: Getty/Thinkstock)Sometimes we do not feel like stepping out and pampering ourselves in a salon, even if we have a festival to celebrate or a wedding to attend, for which we have to look our best. That is when we turn to home-based techniques and DIYs, which give us salon-like skin at the comfort of our house.Of the many things that bother people when it comes to their skincare routine, are pesky blackheads, which are found on almost all skin types, especially oily skin. But, worry not, because there are some products straight from your kitchen which can remove blackheads in no time. Read on.* Egg whites: Egg is the easiest and the best thing you can apply on the face to get rid of blackheads. Just mix an egg white with a little bit of honey, and then apply the paste on the face. Allow it to sit for a few minutes until the face starts to feel dry. Wash it off with regular water and pat-dry. The egg white is believed to tighten your pores and remove the blackheads. When combined with honey, it can make your skin feel soft, clean and supple.* Tomatoes: Every house will have tomatoes. Just take one out of the fridge and apply the pulp on the blackhead-affected portions of the face. Do this before you go to bed at night and clean your face in the morning, like you usually do for your morning skincare routine. Tomato is considered to be a natural exfoliator  it will clean your pores and leave your skin feeling fresh in no time.* Baking soda: Baking soda is not only used for cooking, and for fighting acne, but it can cleanse your face of blackheads as well. Just mix a tablespoon of baking soda with two tablespoons of water, and make a consistent paste. Now apply it on the face and let it stay for about 15 minutes; wash it off with lukewarm water. Just like tomatoes, baking soda, too, is a natural exfoliator and has antibacterial properties. A patch test is advisable.For more lifestyle news, follow us: Twitter: lifestyle_ie | Facebook: IE Lifestyle | Instagram: ie_lifestyle The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

China denies mistreating Uighurs and says the camps are vocational training centers needed to fight extremism.Broad impactWhile the Treasury sanctions target XPCC's financial structure, Wednesday's action will force apparel firms and other companies shipping cotton products into the United States to eliminate XPCC-produced cotton fibre from many stages of their supply chains, said Brenda Smith, CBP's executive assistant commissioner for trade.That pretty much blocks all Chinese cotton textile imports, said a China-based cotton trader, who asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the issue.Identifying cotton from a specific supplier will sharply raise manufacturing costs, and only the few large companies with fully integrated operations across the complex textile supply chain could guarantee that no XPCC product has been used, the trader said.It really depends on how much proof they want. If they want real proof that this cotton has not been used, that's going to be extremely difficult, he added.Major clothing brands including Gap Inc, Patagonia Inc and Zara owner Inditex have told the Thomson Reuters Foundation that did not source from factories in Xinjiang - but that they could not confirm that their supply chains were free of cotton picked from the region.The XPCC could not immediately be reached for comment. The China National Textile and Apparel Council declined to comment. The China Cotton Textile Association could not immediately be reached.In September, CBP considered a much broader import ban on all cotton and tomato products from Xinjiang, but after dissent from within the Trump administration, it announced narrower bans on products from specific entities, including two smaller cotton and apparel producers.U.S. apparel makers had criticized a broader ban as impossible to enforce, but on Wednesday clothing and retail groups welcomed the XPCC-specific ban. The groups, including the American Apparel and Footwear Association and the National Retail Federation, said in a statement they were on the front lines of efforts to ensure forced labor does not taint our supply chains or enter the United States.Mr. Biden has pledged to work with U.S. allies to bring pressure on China to curb human rights and trade abuses. Mr. Trump in recent weeks has increased action against major Chinese state companies, banning access to U.S. technology and investments.",TOMATO

Read MoreTikri (Delhi): With hundreds of farmers driving in every day and parking their tractor trolleys on the roadsides, the caravan of protesters at the Delhi-Haryana border in Tikri now stretches 15km, largely comprising farmers from Punjab who have driven down in groups anywhere between 200km and 500km for a cause on which, they believe, rests not only their own livelihoods but also those of generations to come.According to Shalini Singh, Delhis joint commissioner of police who was at the border on Thursday, the entire 15km stretch of the Delhi-Bahadurgarh road was filled with several thousand protesters, rising in large numbers over the last eight days since the first batch of farmers found their way past barricades set up by Haryana and reached the borders.There is heavy police deployment and barricading and drones are keeping an eye on the swelling crowds. Cops have placed a couple of earth-moving machines and concrete cement blocks across the highway to prevent protesters from crossing over to Delhi. Some policemen have also positioned themselves on the terraces of buildings along the border. The protest , however, has been largely peaceful, with no untoward incidents reported so far.All through Thursday, protesters raised anti-Modi slogans at this border even as Delhi Police kept a hawk eye on them. Some pro-Badal sloganeering was heard too. Many of the farmers TOI spoke to said they had food supplies that can last them up to six months and have no intention of going back till the three new farm laws are repealed by the central government.We are in no hurry to return. Even if the ration gets over, we are sure we will receive help from the local people here who have already extended a helping hand, said 45-year-old Harjinder Singh from Sri Muktsar Sahib, who covered a distance of about 400 kilometres over two days in a truck and with 40 other farmers. They have been protesting for the past nine days now.Some farmers said their families dont want them to return empty-handed. We have full support from our family members, especially our wives and children who insist that we stay put till our goal has been achieved. In fact, a couple of days ago, a few among us did go back to check on their well-being but our families made sure we returned to the protest site immediately, said Maninder Singh, a farmer from Patiala.Apart from many community kitchens set up for meals, some farmers from Haryana are procuring truckloads of vegetables from their farms and distributing them to the protesters free of cost.Kuldeep Bishnoi, from Tohana in Haryana, brought 30 quintals of cauliflower, 10 quintals of eggplant and several kilos of tomato and distributed these. This is my way of protesting. I will ensure my co-farmers are well fed and their resolve to fight against these bills gets stronger, he said.Rajinder Singh from Fatehabad said he had a hard time ensuring the protesters did not antagonise the large police force positioned across the barricades. Standing atop a wooden table, he urged the crowd to move back. Pointing at a metro pillar, he said, This is where the jurisdiction of Haryana ends and that of Delhi begins. We have to make sure we do not do anything which gives the Delhi cops a reason to take action against us. We need to maintain a calm and safe distance from the barricades. Those who do not comply with these regulations will be considered as being on Modis side, he told the crowd, drawing a huge round of applause from the people, who instantly obeyed.On Thursday, farmers from Palwal and Nuh too joined the agitation at Tikri border. Hundreds of us have come from Nuh and this protest seems to be the only way to make the deaf ears of the government listen to our woes. We will not budge till our demands are met, said Shauqat Ali, a farmer from Ghasera in Nuh.The Haryana state president of the Bhartiya Kisan Union, Gurnam Singh Chaduni, said the farmers are being misled by the government. The so-called talks of the Centre with the farmer representatives are an eyewash. This government needs to assure us that farmer loans are waived and there is no loss of minimum support price, he said.Cops at ground zero said they do not anticipate any sort of violence in the coming days. It has been about 10 days since the protesters first started coming to this border and so far, its been very peaceful. Several people living right at the border work in factories located in Bahadurgarh and we have not prevented th-em from moving. We hope this impasse gets resolved soon, said a senior Delhi Police official deployed at the border.",TOMATO

They get immediate value for their produce and nothing matters to them as much.Much before the Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020 (FPTC Act) came into being, the tribals have been selling their produce outside government mandis and market yards though without the desired price for lack of direct market linkage.Natho Samad (45), a tribal horticulture farmer of Sorada in Nuagaon, has no knowledge about the protest or the new farm laws and wants intra and inter-State trading of his produce to continue. Samad has cultivated tomato, bean and other vegetables over nine acre of land including three acre of his own and the rest on mutual contract.Horticulture crops are being sent outside the district by traders of Nuagaon and Rourkela since many years. Though we do not get a fair price for our produce, the middlemen help us get ready cash without much effort. I feel farmers will be able to get good price for their crops if they have direct market access, said Samad.He informed that on Monday, he sold 25 kg of tomato to a local trader at the rate of `24 per kg while retail price of the vegetable at Rourkela was `50.Sources said horticulture crops of Nuagaon block are exported to Jajpur, Keonjhar, Cuttack and a few other districts of Odisha besides Jharkhand and Bihar for the last two decades. With no cold storage option available, farmers best bet is to sell bulk crops at a bit less price and get ready cash without much effort.A trader of Nuagaon Sudhir Sahu said the general notion that local traders make huge profits is wrong. After harvest, I lift the crops directly from the field at a price which prevails in Nuagaon and send the produce to intra or inter-State destinations. Profitability of farmers depends on prevailing market price besides quality and quantity of yields in a crop season, he added.Nuagoan panchayat samiti member Gajendra Sahu said, till four years back, Nuagaons tomato was getting exported to Pakistan. After the Covid-19 restrictions were lifted, intra and inter-State trading of vegetables are rising gradually, he said.",TOMATO

Stalin led a protest here on Saturday in solidarity with the farmers agitating in New Delhi against the three laws to deregulate the agriculture sector. He questioned why Prime Minister Narendra Modi was not prepared to give an assurance to the farmers on the minimum support price (MSP). The DMK organised well-attended agitations in different parts of Tamil Nadu.Addressing the gathering near Kandhashramam here, Mr. Stalin said Mr. Modi talked up the benefits of the laws without specifying them. How would he be able to do so when there are no benefits [in the law], he said. The Prime Minister says farmers will get the MSP. But why is he not ready to include it in the law, he asked.Mr. Stalin said the agitation had shaken the Centre. He pointed out that while Mr. Modi had said his government would prevent farmer suicides, 10,281 farmers had ended their lives last year alone. Contrary to the Prime Ministers assurance, the government had informed the Supreme Court that it would not implement the recommendations of the M.S. Swaminathan Committee report.Mr. Stalin criticised Chief Minister Edappadi K Palaniswami, whom he called Salem scientist, for stating that the protest was instigated by traders and middlemen in Punjab. The Chief Minister is saying, as if it were a new finding, that farmers can sell their produce in any part of the country under the new law. But would tomato farmers at Edappadi travel to Punjab to sell their produce, he asked.He said the Chief Minister was not well informed about the laws, and he must atone for his betrayal of farmers. He reiterated that the State must oppose the laws and pointed out that Kerala and Punjab had mounted a legal challenge.Mr. Stalin also questioned the Chief Minister why he had not responded to DMK deputy general secretary A. Rajas challenge to a debate on the 2G case and the charges of corruption against the DMK.Corporatising farmingParticipating in a protest at Mettupalayam, DMK womens wing secretary M.K. Kanimozhi said that had the DMK been in power, Tamil Nadu would have been the first State to oppose the anti-farmer, anti-people farm laws.The BJP government at the Centre used its brute majority and passed the Bills in Parliament. The urgency with which it had passed the Bills showed that it wanted to corporatise the agriculture sector by eliminating small traders to pave the way for corporates.",TOMATO

As a way out of this pickle, a select few Mumbai, Delhi and Kolkata residents were sent a DIY home-cooking kit by the Italian Embassy for a cooking challenge.As part of the fifth edition of the World Week of Italian Cuisine in India, this edition celebrated the rise of home-cooking during lockdown by asking contestants to make the Italian dish found in every home  the Spaghetti al Pomodoro.The backstoryAccording to chef Riccardo Fanucci. of Gambero Rosso in Rome, despite the great differences in gastronomic traditions travelling through Italian regions, spaghetti with tomato sauce or spaghetti pomodoro is probably the recipe that you can always find everywhere  at the best restaurants and in every single household.The spaghetti with tomato sauce represents a symbol of union and brotherhood between all Italian regions. Italy was the first European country, after Spain, to know the tomato in the first years of 1500 AD, thanks to the close relationships existing between the Bourbons and the reigning families of the time and the Spanish domains on Italian territory. The climate of our country is particularly favourable to the cultivation of tomatoes, chef Riccardo says. But that doesnt mean that tomato is present in 90 per cent of Italian recipes. Thats a myth because there are hundreds of recipes that dont use tomatoes, he adds.H.E. Vincenzo De Luca, Ambassador of Italy in India was one of the judges of the competitionThe primary factor in any Italian dish is the ingredients. But its difficult to find raw ingredients from Italy, which results in fusion versions. But sometimes its sad to see the original name of ancient recipes handed down for centuries, sometimes transformed into grotesque reproductions. Its also true that its never wrong to satisfy the needs of customers, changing the recipes in accordance with the expectations of taste in a foreign country. The most important thing is to call things by their right name, chef Riccardo adds. Just remember to use good wine and extra virgin olive oil.This is something that cook-off winner Karan Tripathi, who has started cooking more during the lockdown and has now learnt familial recipes, also noticed.Since its such a simple sauce prepared with only a handful of ingredients, the tiniest of error, could make all the difference. Being careful was key. While I have prepared arrabbiata sauce a number of times, pomodoro never got the chance to be showcased. I would always discard the basil stems and only use the leaves, but the chefs recipe suggested I cook basil stems along with garlic on low heat to maximise the flavour. I was afraid of overcooking and browning the basil stems, giving an undesirable burnt flavour to the sauce. Also, if the pasta is on high heat while adding the Parmesan cheese, the cheese will overcook and take on a gritty texture. Too much Parmesan will overpower the delicate basil flavour, he describes.Moment of truthAs a result, the pasta was light on the palate, allowing room for all the ingredients to shine, unlike the desi counterparts where the garlic, dried oregano, and chili flakes are overdone.The cook-off winner Karan Tripathi learnt not to discard the basil stems but cook it along with garlic on low heat to maximise the flavourMaking pasta from scratch and not overcooking risotto, is still a pet peeve, says the winner of a free enogastronomic trip to Italy.The dish also busts two common myths about Italian cuisine, says chef Riccardo: The first, spaghetti is served with meatballs. Youll hardly ever find it in a restaurant in Italy. This is a recipe that belongs to the tradition of home-cooking - a recipe that could be found at a grandmothers house in the 1940s on the table of Italian immigrants in America, he says.Secondly, there is no pasta with chicken or ketchup. It only comes together inside a sandwich! He adds. It was nice to see how even in India the tomato spaghetti managed to bring the warmth of Italy to your homes. The recipe I chose was the one that most faithfully reflects the real Italian atmosphere that a plate of spaghetti with tomato on a table can create - its just waiting to be eaten!The participants had to send in three separate videos  an introduction, the cooking process and prep, the table setting and tasting. Then, five shortlisted participants had a cook-off, judged by Alex De Masi , first counsellor, and Isabella Periotto, first secretary, and chef Riccardo Fanucci of Gambero Rosso joining in from Rome.For both Italy and India, food traditions are crucial and a common factor that binds us. Home-cooking plays a central role in households of both countries and so, we wanted to dedicate this World Week of Italian Cuisine to it, especially since people are opting for it in the lockdown, says H.E. Vincenzo De Luca, Ambassador of Italy in India.Follow @Kkuenzang on Instagram and TwitterFrom HT Brunch, December 6, 2020Follow us on twitter.com/HTBrunchConnect with us on facebook.com/hindustantimesbrunch",TOMATO

Which is why, given the unhealthy climate that exists because of the pandemic, we asked five top chefs to share their thoughts on immunity-boosting ingredients and the recipes that use them.Chef Joan-RocaChef-Owner of the three-Michelin star El Celler de Can Roca, Girona, SpainFavourite immunity-boosting recipe: Oyster Ying-YangWhy? In Mediterranean gastronomy, garlic is a good natural antibiotic. Catalan cuisines typical homemade aioli sauce is an emulsion made of raw garlic, salt and olive oil. We use it with fish, charcoaled meats and greens. From Andalusian culture, we have a wonderful cold soup named ajoblanco made of garlic, tender fresh almonds, vinegar, extra virgin olive oil and salt.At El Celler de Can Roca, garlic is present in one of our dishes, the Ying-Yang Oyster, based on two sauces, the cold ajoblanco, and a hot cream made of fermented black garlic.Nutritionists notes: Apart from immunity-boosting garlic, Oysters too are loaded with zinc, the gatekeeper of immunity. This recipe is a combination of powerful antioxidants and anti-inflammatory agents, including Omega-3, selenium and Vitamin E.Recipe: Oyster Ying-YangServes 4Ingredients and method:For oysters:4 oysters500g sea waterOpen oysters with a paring knife and remove them from their shells carefully. Cut the beard off with a paring knife and blanch oysters in boiling sea water for 15 seconds. Remove them from the water and place them on a baking sheet to blast chill. Reserve.For black garlic sauce (yields 550g):250g peeled almonds500g of water7.5g Sherry vinegar12.5g extra virgin olive oil3 black garlic cloves3.75g salt20g squid inkCrush the peeled almonds with water and leave to stand for 24 hours refrigerated. Run through a cloth filter, applying pressure to squeeze out as much water as possible. Mix it with the remaining ingredients, blend, and strain and keep the resulting sauce very cool until serving.For white garlic shots (yields 700g):250g almond paste250g water1/2 garlic clove166.5g water15g Sherry vinegar20g extra virgin olive oilSalt3 gelatine sheetsHydrate almond paste for 12 hours with 250g water. Cut the garlic clove in half and remove the germ if necessary. Mix all the ingredients except for the gelatine and blend in the Thermomix. Separate a third of the mixture, heat it while keeping it below 35C/95F and dilute gelatine sheets, previously hydrated. Add in the remaining mixture and transfer it into a squeeze bottle. Let drops of the mixture fall into a container with liquid nitrogen to make frozen spheres; remove with a strainer and reserve in a container in the freezer until serving.Oyster sauce (yields 550g):10 oysters50g shallot5g butter35g oyster water20g oyster sauce625g creamSaltOpen the oysters and reserve their water. Julienne the shallot finely and toss in butter with a pinch of salt over very low heat until it cooks well. Add the oysters and sear them on both sides to brown them lightly; use the oyster water to deglaze, add the oyster sauce, cook for one minute and add cream. Simmer the mixture on very low heat for five minutes, remove and place in Thermomix. Blend the mixture and run it through a fine chinoise. Reserve in a bain-marie at 65C/149F.Garnishing and plating: Cut in half the oysters and, using a paring knife, cut a small base at the tip of each oyster, so that they stand on the plate. On a small soup dish, set one spoonful of very cold black garlic sauce on one side and white garlic shots on top of it, as well as half a cold oyster. On the opposite side, with both sauces touching but not mixing, arrange the hot oyster sauce and the other half oyster, previously heated slightly. This way, a play with cold and hot temperatures is created with both the oysters and the sauces.Chef Srijit Girija GopinathChef at the two-Michelin star Campton Place, and chef owner of Ettan, San FranciscoFavourite immunity-boosting recipe: RasamFor chef Srijit Girija Gopinath, rasam works bestWhy? The key to consumption is to eat what is available locally and what is in season. There is a reason why nature delivers it at a certain time of the year. Indian cuisine is blessed with several immunity-promoting ingredients baked into our recipes already. There is curcumin in turmeric, gingerol and capsaicin in ginger, allicin (sulphur) in garlic, Vitamin C-rich citrus fruits like grapefruit, lemon, lime, tangerine and so on. When it comes to immunity-boosting dishes, though the idea of immunity boosting was never a question then, rasam was part of everyday life. Perhaps thats one of the reasons why we seldom fell sick those days. Today, I love making variations of rasams, with chicken, fish bones, lamb trotters and crab when in season. A good half a dozen ingredients in our humble rasam are today celebrated in the Western world for their immunity-boosting qualities.Nutritionists notes: The star ingredient for an immunity-boosting effect here is tomatoes, which are loaded with a strong antioxidant called lycopene that reduces oxidative stress and enhances immune response. Rasam brings added benefits with anti microbial spices such as cumin, turmeric and ginger.Recipe: Chicken rasamServes 3-4Ingredients:For chicken rasam base3 tbsp groundnut oil300g chicken thighs/ legs with bone (cut in to one-inch pieces)2 tomatoes (medium-size, diced)3 pods garlic (crushed with skin)6 cilantro stems (crushed)1/2 tsp chilli powder1/2 tsp turmeric powderSprig of curry leaves3 tbsp moong dal (soaked)2 tbsp tamarind pulp1 litre of water approx.SaltRasam spice blend1/2 tsp cumin seeds1/4 tsp fenugreek seeds1 tsp fennel seeds1 tsp pepper corn2-3 small red chillies (torn)2 garlic cloves1 tsp urad lentil6 curry leaves1 pinch asafoetidaFor tempering3tbsp sesame oil1 tsp mustard2 shallots, sliced thin1/2 tsp cumin seeds2 cardamoms, crushed3 cloves-inch piece of cinnamon1/2 tsp black pepper, crushed1 tbsp coriander leaves, choppedMethod:Wash the moong dal and add half the water and cook it until soft. Keep it aside. Heat groundnut oil in a pan and add garlic, curry leaves, turmeric and chilli powder, cook for three minutes and add tomatoes and cook until soft.Now add the chicken and sauce for five minutes on high heat. Add cilantro stems, tamarind nectar and moong bean along with water. Add more water if required. Pinch of salt. Let it simmer until chicken is 90 per cent cooked. Now, roast the rasam spice ingredients in a tsp of oil (add asafoetida after the whole spices are roasted). Blend it all together and add it to the simmering chicken rasam base. Continue cooking the chicken until fully cooked. Adjust the seasoning and turn the heat off after adding rasam spice blend simmer for not more than 12-15 minutes.For tempering, add sesame oil and bring it almost to smoke, add mustard and let it splutter. Add all the whole spices and cook it for two minutes and then shallots until light brown. Once again adjust the seasoning, add the coriander leaves and enjoy it out of the pot or strain it and have the broth alone. I prefer to have with chicken and other vegetablesChef Atul KochharChef, restaurateur & entrepreneurFavourite immunity- boosting recipe:Lasooni dalFor chef Atul, this easy recipe from Punjab is what works bestWhy? In Indian vegetarian families, lentil dishes are the main focus of the meal, replacing the meat. This is an easy recipe from Punjab, with a pronounced garlic flavour. Garlic has been part of Indian diet since times immemorial. It boosts immunity and is known to help kill cancer cells, especially colon cancer. Benefits come from raw and cooked garlic  not supplements. Its known to work as an anti-inflammatory, especially as a rub for inflamed joints and muscles. Garlic improves cardiovascular health, it gives better hair and skin and protects your food. When wild garlic is in season, chop the leaves and add at the end for an extra garlic hit, as well as for the colour.Nutritionists notes: Lentils are a good source of zinc and Vitamin B6 that help support our immune system. Allicin is the magic component that gives garlic its immunity-boosting properties. However, to unlock benefits of garlic, crush, mince or chop it and keep away from heat for about 10 minutes before cooking.Recipe: Lasooni dalServes 44 garlic cloves1 small thin green chilli200g split yellow moong dal2 teaspoons ground turmericSeveral sprigs of fresh corianderSea saltFor the tadka4 garlic cloves1 tomato onion2 tablespoons rapeseed or vegetable oil1 teaspoon cumin seeds2 teaspoons ground coriander teaspoon red chilli powder, or to taste teaspoon garam masalaMethod:Bring 750ml of water to the boil in a large covered saucepan and assemble all the ingredients and other equipment before you begin. You also need a sieve and a saut or frying pan. Peel and finely chop the garlic cloves. Remove the stalk from the green chilli, if necessary, and split the chilli lengthways, but leave it whole. Rinse the lentils in the sieve with cold water, then add them to the boiling water and stir in the garlic, green chilli and turmeric. Return the water to the boil, then boil the lentils, uncovered, for 15 minutes, or until they are tender. When the lentils are tender, stir in extra water if they are too dry for you. Meanwhile, to make the tarka, peel and finely chop the garlic cloves. Finely chop the tomato. Peel and finely chop the onion. Heat the rapeseed oil over a medium-high heat in the pan. Add the garlic and cumin seeds and stir until the seeds crackle. Add the onion with a pinch of salt and continue to stir until the onion is lightly browned. Add the ground coriander, chilli powder and garam masala, and stir for 30 seconds to cook the spices. Watch closely so they do not burn. Stir in the tomatoes, lower the heat and continue stirring until they soften and break down, pressing down with your spoon or spatula. Stir the tarka mixture into the lentils and bring to the boil.Just before serving, rinse and finely chop the coriander sprigs. Stir half the chopped coriander into the lentils, then adjust the seasoning with salt, if necessary. Sprinkle over the remaining chopped coriander.Chef Ranveer BrarChef & television hostFavourite immunity-boosting recipe:Ashwagandha-Amla- Hibiscus Iced TeaChef Ranveer Brar picks traditional ingredients as reliable immunity boostersWhy? I believe that our traditional ingredients and our traditional food medicine have enough power to heal and make us resilient. I have spent most of the lockdown trying to research five immunity building ingredients in our food: peepramul, ashwagandha, turmeric, amla and mulethi. Ashwagandha, also called the Indian ginseng, is an ancient medicinal herb. Its known to help reduce stress levels and keep depression at bay. Hibiscus has natural antioxidants and is good for the heart. And amla is packed with Vitamin C and is a natural diuretic.Nutritionists Notes:An all-rounder that can support various features of the immune response. Mulethi keeps the respiratory tract healthy; peepramul acts as a natural pain reliever; ashwagandha, a potent adaptogen, reduces stress and improves the bodys defence system through cell-mediated immunity; turmeric is popularly known for bringing inflammation down, and amla is an excellent storehouse of Vitamin C.Recipe: Hibiscus teaServes 2Ingredients:For immunity tea masala2 tbsp mulethi Powder1 tsp ashwagandha Powder tsp peepli Powder1 pinch turmeric1 tbsp amla JuiceFor Tea2 cup water2-4 large dry hibiscus petals2 tbsp.

Now add dried hibiscus petals, immunity tea masala, mint leaves and keep for five minutes or more. Pour hot hibiscus tea it in a glass, mix in honey, lime juice and enjoy. Alternatively, let the tea cool down to room temperature and serve.Chef Nelly RobinsonChef-Owner, Nel, Sydney, AustraliaFavourite immunity-boosting recipe:Green Pea Vellouti with Cured Ham and Fresh PeaChef Nelly Robinson believes in the immunity-boosting qualities of green peasWhy? At Nel, we use a lot of ingredients like citrus, ginger and garlic that are very good for your immune system, but one of my favourites is a green pea vellouti with cured ham and fresh pea. Green pea has Vitamin C, which is good for fighting viruses and good for the immune system.Nutritionists Notes: Green peas are packed with Vitamin C, antioxidants and flavonoids that help build strong immunity. As a good source of fibre, peas help support gut health, which is closely related to a well-built immune system.Recipe: Pea and Ham SoupServes 10Ingredients:For the pork hock terrine2 Raw ham hocks3 bunches coriander root4 garlic cloves4 shallots50g ginger3 carrots1 stick celery1 leekPeppercornsStar aniseJuniperFennel seed4 gold leaf gelatineMethod:Place in a pot the ham hocks, coriander, shallot, ginger, carrots, celery, leek, peppercorns, star anise, juniper, fennel seeds in a pot and fill with water, bring to boil and simmer for four to five hours until the meat falls off the bone, drain and strain the stock and reduce, while the stock is reducing pick the meat off the hock and place in a bowl.

However, onion and potato continue to maintain their rates.This favourable winter weather has led to bumper production of bittergourd, cabbage, carrot, cauliflower cucumber, brinjal, ladyfinger, pumpkin, radish, tomato and other vegetables in the district. While the price of cabbage has come down by half from Rs 40 to Rs 20 per kg, brinjal is being sold at Rs 15 instead of Rs 30 per kg till a few days back . Similarly, the price of pumpkin has halved to Rs 15 per kg and tomato is now available for Rs 20 per kg.Arakhita Das, a vegetable seller said even price of beans has dropped to Rs 15 per kg and cucumber to Rs 10 per kg. The sharp dip in price of vegetables has the farmers staring at losses owing to rise in input cost. On top of it, middlemen rake up profits by procuring vegetables from farmers in bulk at lower rates and selling them at skyrocketing prices in Cuttack, Bhubaneswar and other cities.Vegetables procured from farmers in the district are also being sold at retail malls in cities, said Mahadev Sutar of Rajkanika. President of district unit of Krusaka Sabha Umesh Chandra Singh said unavailability of cold storages in the district has forced farmers to sell their produce at throwaway prices.The consumers are not complaining though. Thanks to an arrival of winter crops in the markets, prices have crashed as much as 50 per cent compared to the last month.

Barring March, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation remained above six per cent throughout 2020.According to the latest data released by the Ministry of Statistics & Programme Implementation (MoSPI) on Monday, inflation in food basket or Consumer Food Price Index eased to 9.43 per cent during the month under review as against 11.07 per cent in October and 10.68 per cent in September, even as prices of vegetable mainly onion, potato and tomato stayed higher. On the other hand, Wholesale Price Index (WPI)-based inflation rose to a nine-month high of 1.55 per cent as against 1.48 per cent in October. WPI inflation in October was at an eight-month high due to costlier manufactured products.According to Aditi Nayar, principal economist at ICRA with a sharp and fairly broad-based sequential increase of 0.8 per cent, the core-WPI inflation rose to a 22-month high of 2.6 per cent in November 2020. In our view, a rise in inflation for core items, including crude oil and mineral oils, would be partly offset by a base-effect led decline in the food inflation in December 2020, resulting in a fairly stable print for theongoing month, Nayar said.RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das, in its latest monetary policy committee meeting, pegged CPI inflation at 6.8 per cent for October-December quarter before easing marginally to 5.8 per cent in Q4 of 2020-21.",TOMATO

The restaurant, with fine ingredients beautifully presented, elevated the cuisine to the level of fine dining. Singh wasnt alone in this movement  Atul Kochhar and Vineet Bhatia both won Michelin stars that very year  but hes a respected chef whose influence is still felt two decades later. He now also owns more-casual establishments such as Cinnamon Kitchen and Cinnamon Bazaar.For Bloomberg, he supplied a simple recipe for Old Delhi-Style Butter Chicken. Ive eaten the dish in Delhi at Moti Mahal restaurant, where many say that it originated. I have loved it for years and couldnt wait to try cooking it at home. Except that I took a lot of liberties with Viveks recipe. I substituted turkey breast for chicken to see if the recipe would work for Christmas. It does, but you need to be ready to adjust cooking times. My turkey was almost fully cooked after 13 minutes in the oven.My way of preparing this dish, which contains an astonishing amount of tomatoes, was to cook the sauce at a very low heat for more than an hour while I read a book and drank wine. It reduced right down to the point where it was thick and very intensely flavored before I re-introduced the turkey. Im not sure that Vivek would approve but I enjoyed it as much as any butter chicken I have eaten.Vivek recommends two 750 gram (26.5 ounce) free-range young chickens (poussins), skinned and each cut in half along the backbone; alternatively use 800g boned chicken thighs cut into two. The dish serves four to six. I skipped any accompaniments and downsized it to 600g of turkey. Reader, I ate it all.Ingredients:For the marinade:80 grams full-fat Greek yoghurt1 tablespoon ginger & garlic paste1 tbsp vegetable oil1  teaspoons saltJuice of 1 lemon1 tbsp red chili powder1 tsp ground cumin tsp garam masalaFor the sauce:1 kilogram (2.2 pounds) tomatoes (or 600g pure of tinned tomatoes)5 centimeter (2-inch) piece of fresh ginger, peeled and finely chopped1 tbsp ginger-garlic paste1 bay leaf1 tbsp red chili powder80g butter, diced2 green chilis, slit lengthways75 milliliters (2.5 fluid ounces) single cream1 tsp salt2 tsp dried fenugreek leaves, crushed between your fingertips tsp garam masala1 tsp sugarPreparation:First, prepare the chicken. Make small cuts all over the chicken pieces with a sharp knife to help the marinade penetrate. The dish tastes better on the bone, but if using boned thighs, no need to make cuts on the surface. Just cut each thigh into two pieces each. To prepare the marinade, mix all the ingredients together in a deep ovenproof dish. Smear the cut chicken with the marinade, cover and set aside in the fridge for 10 minutes.Preheat oven to 220 degrees Celsius (428 Fahrenheit), gas mark 7.Cook the chicken in the preheated oven for 13-15 minutes. You may need to turn the pieces after 8-10 minutes to ensure they color evenly on both sides. Cut the cooked chicken into smaller pieces as per your preference. The chicken does not need to be completely cooked at this point as it will continue to cook in the sauce. Cut the chicken halves into smaller pieces. Strain off the juices through a fine sieve and set aside.For the sauce, place the chopped tomatoes ( or pure if using ) in a pan with 125ml of water, the ginger-garlic paste, bay leaf and simmer for about 15-20 minutes over medium heat until the tomatoes have completely disintegrated. Pick out the bay leaf , then blend the tomato broth with a hand-held blender and pass it through a sieve to obtain a smooth pure. Return the pure to a clean pan, add the chili powder and simmer for 8-10 minutes. It should slowly begin to thicken.When the sauce turns glossy, add the chicken pieces and the reserved roasting juices. Then add about 200ml water and simmer for 3-5 minutes until the sauce turns glossy again and the water is absorbed. For a thicker sauce, either add slightly less water or simmer for longer.Simmer until the chicken is cooked through and the sauce is beginning to acquire a glaze. Add the chopped ginger, green chilies and cream and simmer for a minute or two longer, taking care that the sauce does not split. Stir in the salt, crushed fenugreek leaves and garam masala, then check the seasoning and add the sugar. Slowly whisk in the butter, a couple of pieces at a time, allow the butter to melt while stirring to create an emulsion. Remove from the heat and serve with naan bread or pilau rice.(This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text.

Red baubles on a Christmas tree, a red hat for your festivities, and even the colour of the wine youd opt to go with all the merry celebrations. While this colour makes a mark amid the green and white at the end of the year, our neighbouring state Kerala, has had a liking for red for decades. No, we are not talking about their political leanings, but their love for red rice.A full Kerala meal, popularly called sadhya, is incomplete without a heap of red rice adorning the centre space of the banana leaf, while the kootu, curries and pachadis form the border. Red rice, called matta rice, is a staple in every Malayali household. Dietician Preethi Rahul walks us through the different variants of this variety, how they affect the body, and shares a simple recipe.Red rice vs white riceThe presence of anthocyanin in this type of rice gives it a red colour. It is present in the bran layer of the rice. Anthocyanins are a kind of chemicals that have antioxidant properties, which in turn carries a lot of health benefits.Nutritional valueCalories in any kind of rice is similar  350kcal in 100 g. In terms of nutritional profile, red rice is very similar to brown rice. It has 6.6g of protein (per 100 g) and 6.7g of fibre (per 100 g). The fibre content in this variety of rice is the highest as compared to others. Hence, it is good for diabetic patients. This variant has a moderate GI (glycemic index) of 50-70 units. It is often recommended for people with diabetes.Types of red riceIn a paper titled Nutritional and functional properties of coloured rice varieties of South India: a review by TS Rathna Priya and her team, which was published in 2019 in the Journal of Ethnic Foods, she notes that there are several varieties of red rice. We are all aware of rosamatta (matta) variety from Kerala. But, in Kerala itself, there are other varieties like kattamodan, kairali, bhadra, rakthashali, jyothy, etc. Even in Tamil Nadu, we have our native variants like red kavuni, kaivara samba, mappillai samba, kuruvikar and poongar. There is also another belt in India  the Himalayan region  where red rice is commonly grown, and it is called Himalayan red rice.Each rice has its own benefits. Red kavuni has anti-microbial properties; poongar is usually consumed by women after they attain puberty and is believed to avert ailments associated with reproduction; mapillai samba helps reduce cholesterol; kattuyanam lowers glucose; garudan samba has anti-arthritic properties. In Kerala, different types of red rice are used in Ayurvedic treatments too, notes the paper. Rakthashali helps in reducing fever and ulcer, and improve eyesight; nivarrice is used to treat haemorrhoids.Which red rice to chooseThe most commonly available variant is the rosamatta rice. Having said that, it is hard to say that one must continue only one variant as each one has its own benefit. The taste of all the red rice varieties differ, too, but they are all parboiled and seem a little dry. The pigment of the rice is based on the level of anthocyanin present. Some people may be averse to the rice just by looking at it. But, it has immense benefits. If you plan to make the switch, opt for matta rice. Once you get used to its chewy taste, you can try the others. It is chewy because it retains the bran and endosperm. This is why it takes a longer time to cook as well. This rice must not be cooked till it becomes soft; if you do so, you will lose all the nutrients in it.Other nutrientsRed rice has some amount of calcium, iron, higher on potassium content, and there is some amount of selenium, too. These are nutrients that are additionally present, considering the presence of bran and endosperm intact. But, rice isnt one of the sources to get these nutrients from.Safe choiceRed rice is considered to be safe for people with allergies because anthocyanin tends to have a protective effect on allergic manifestation in certain cases.RecipeRed rice khichdiIngredientsRed rice: 2 cupsDal (Moong or Toor):1 cupVegetables: Carrot, beans, cauliflower, onion and tomatoMETHODSoak rice and dal for a while in water. Heat oil in a cooker. Saute onion and tomato along with any spice youd like to add. Add vegetables. Now, mix in the rice and dal. Give it stir. Add salt and close the cooker.

At its most basic, pizza is a food whose primary ingredient, wheat, is grown by these very farmers.Do Indian farmers eat pizza? This question has opened the door to all kinds of misinformation, with outrage being manufactured at the sight of the protesting farmers near Delhi eating pizza. Real farmers dont eat pizzas, we are told. They eat roti, dal, chawal and sabzi, followed by a tall, frothing glass of lassi, because thats the image that is most convenient for us to believe  just as convenient as the image of a farmer who, having worked hard all day, goes to bed happy in the knowledge that mehnat ka phal meetha hota hai. The bitter fruits of reality  ever-decreasing margins, rising debts, frequent crop failures  might as well not exist.So let us reframe the question: Can farmers eat pizza? The answer is why not? What is pizza, really? At its most basic, pizza is a food whose primary ingredient, wheat, is grown by these very farmers. Its cheap, easy to eat and is widely available across India, including the city at whose borders the protestors have been camping for nearly three weeks. And, yes, it is delicious and filling. But lets ask that question one last time, and get it absolutely right this time: Why shouldnt farmers eat pizza? Before it became one of the most globalised fast foods, it was a humble peasant dish of flatbread, tomatoes and cheese from Naples, Italy. The modern pizza is, in its own way, a marker of class distinctions  not least in India  but it does frequently breach these lines to be eaten and enjoyed even by those who cant afford San Marzano tomatoes and mozzarella. They simply make do with tomato ketchup and processed Indian cheese.And, finally, pizza is the ultimate shareable food. By its very design, it is meant to be eaten by a group of people, sitting companionably and reaching over each others shoulders to grab a slice. For a protest marked by such a sense of solidarity and fellowship as the ongoing farmers protests, pizza is, then, the food that makes the most symbolic sense. The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

But, here, the different things are being done in the same way, ie, new crops are being grown with the same or higher input intensity. In fact, what the state should have directed and attempted in participation with other actors has been left to the private corporate and multinational enterprises. It is important to recognise that what is needed is not less of state but better state for promotion and regulation of economic activities, and organisations and institutions for sustainability.He also found, The nongovernmental and community organisations, which can play a role in information provision, and in the monitoring and regulating the working of contracts, are, unfortunately, missing from the state altogether. In fact, that was one of the reasons that the suicides of farmers due to crop failure and indebtedness in the state recently (1998) could not be prevented.So, what is essential for making success out of contract system is the institutional and organisational innovations in the states rural sector, which it is capable of, as proved by the emergence of the secondary tractor markets in the state. Contracts require frequent and independent scrutiny so that they remain competitive both with similar contracts and with open market transactions. Wide publicity of contract terms will help to stimulate competition, the research paper stated.Secondly, vigorous bargaining cooperatives, or other agricultural producer organisations are needed to negotiate equitable contracts which have been able to secure the standardisation of contracts and their scrutiny by a government agency in the past in the US. In Japan as well, the farmers have managed their relationships with companies well through cooperatives.When contacted, Prof Singh said, I have been studying the issue of contract farming over 20 years. I am not against it. However, the states role is necessary to protect the small farmers who engage in contract farming. Right now, contract farming is only in favour of medium or large farmers. Whats more, the current law on contract farming has several weaknesses. It is badly drafted so the government needs to iron out the flaws to make it effective.",TOMATO

Ramakrishna has said that the agriculture reforms envisaged in the farm Bills will attract more private investments and promote farm mechanisation on the desired scale.In a press release here on Friday, he said with the proposed reforms, the agriculture sector would play a vital role in accelerating economic growth of the country.Mr. Ramakrishna said the CII was facilitating private sector engagement in agriculture through Farmers Producers Organisations (FPOs), which were aimed at capacity-building of farmers and forging market linkages.Nine value chains, namely rice, maize, soybean, pulses, banana, potato, tomato spices and red chilli had been prioritised under the programme, and 11 companies had already signed up to engage with the FPOs.Under the programme, over 50,000 farmer families were expected to be impacted by 2021 and nearly 2 lakh by 2023.With these partnerships, CII hoped the wastages and other non-value-adding costs along the supply chain would be eliminated and more investments made in agriculture extension services, which contributed to enhancement of productivity and returns. Besides, they helped in the creation of on-farm post-harvest infrastructure.",TOMATO

Appaji Reddem reports on the outbreak, the response and the possible causesIt has been 11 days since she suddenly collapsed and had a seizure, but Bantu Mallikas woes are not over. The thirty-two-year-old homemaker from Temple Street in Eluru still gets shivers, headaches and dizziness.It was on December 6 that Mallika felt a piercing headache and giddiness at home. Feeling disoriented, she called the village health assistant, Durga, for help. It was a timely call, for minutes later she lost consciousness and had a seizure. She was rushed to the medical centre at the end of the street.The Tangellamudi canal is filled with garbage in Eluru town. | Photo Credit: Giri K.V.S.I dont know what happened to me, Mallika said. When I opened my eyes, I found myself on a hospital bed in the Government General Hospital (GGH). I had followed my usual routine that day. I did the household chores and had more or less the same food and water that I have been having for years. And none of my family members had any problem. Mallika was discharged on the same day after treatment.Health assistant Durga too was surprised by the sudden attack. Mallika had a five-minute seizure and complained of nausea after she gained consciousness. For the past couple of days, we have been monitoring her along with four others on the street who experienced similar symptoms. They still feel weak and complain of a vomiting sensation, she said.Also read: 170 hospitalised with unknown disease in West Godavari districts EluruMallika and four others quickly turned to scores of people and scores to hundreds. Confusion prevailed as there seemed to be no identifiable cause of this illness. For the people of Eluru, in West Godavari district, already living in fear of COVID-19, this was a bolt from the blue. Between December 5 and December 13, over 600 people had fallen ill and no one knew why. Only theories floated around. On December 10, the Andhra Pradesh government constituted a 21-member high level multi-disciplinary committee to investigate the disease that was affecting the people of Eluru, a city with a population of over four lakh and a hub of agriculture, commerce, aquaculture and export.The initial daysDoctors at the GGH said the illness had in fact started impacting several people in mid-November. All the patients had the same symptoms: after experiencing giddiness, back pain, fits, vomiting, anxiety, loss of memory, and headache, they all collapsed. The patients were immediately tested for COVID-19, their reports showed negative. While the recovery rate was extremely high, people were shocked when one man died. The sudden outbreak grabbed global attention in the first week of December, with officials of the World Health Organization (WHO), the State and Central governments, and research organisations scrambling to find out the cause.A patient is brought into the hospital after having a seizure. | Photo Credit: Giri K.V.S.According to government records, a majority of the cases have been traced to JP Road, Vangayagudem, Dakshina Veedhi, Turpu Veedhi, Arundhatipeta, Kothapeta, Kobbarithota and Sanivarapupeta in Eluru. The first cases were reported from JP Road and Vangayagudem, according to hospital authorities.Also read: Health experts chasing all kinds of leadsOn December 9, GGH was buzzing with activity. It was the second consecutive day that a decline in cases was reported, yet the hospital was still admitting patients with similar ailments  at least more than two every passing hour. GGH Superintendent A.V.R. Mohan was busy attending calls from State and Central officials, journalists and staff members. Speaking to The Hindu, he said that there was no pattern in the answers of patients when they were asked what they imagined was the reason for the illness. Some said the episode struck after they drove, some said it happened after they ate, others, after they drank. The authorities were at sea.Mohan said the illness broke out before December. Sporadic incidents were reported by some rural medical practitioners from the middle of November, he said, but no one suspected anything. Then the numbers began climbing from December 4, the hospitals began filling up with patients, and a 45-year-old man died on December 9. However, that death cannot be directly attributed to the disease, Mohan said. The person fell in the bathroom and the cause of death was reported as a head injury. But of course, post-COVID-19, any such development is a matter of concern. Some people even experienced seizures more than once, but they were treated and sent home, said Mohan.Also read: Eluru poisoning | 561 people affected so farThe responseTo handle the rapidly emerging crisis in Eluru, 150 additional people were brought from hospitals across the State, including doctors, paramedics and nurses. Expert teams from premier research and medical institutions in Delhi, Pune, Bengaluru, Hyderabad and other parts of Andhra Pradesh were also brought in.Speaking to The Hindu at GGH, Jamshed Nair, Associate Professor at the Department of Emergency Medicine, AIIMS, New Delhi, said their team has collected inputs from the patients at GGH and visited the discharged patients and their kin in the affected colonies in Eluru. We have collected blood samples from them. Samples of water and milk have been collected from Eluru and neighbouring villages for testing, he said.On its part, the government roped in administrative staff, police and medical personnel, and research institutions to handle the situation. Sixty-two village secretariats have been activated, and first aid centres have been set up in each locality. Each centre has a doctor and two paramedics and basic medication to help patients till the ambulance arrives. The Centre has maintained a log book of referred cases with details such as the name of the patient, ward, gender, symptoms noticed, the date of admission, the reference hospital, present condition, the mobile number of the patient, date of discharge and remarks. Such micro-level data has helped immensely in handling the situation, said the GGH Superintendent.According to the data on Temple Street, where the first incident was reported, there were 17 cases recorded from December 5 to 9. While 13 of these patients had fits, the remaining complained of dizziness, weakness, vomiting and diarrhoea. The patients were referred to GGH, Swaruparani Hospital and Vijaya Diagnostics.The government has established a round-the-clock control room and a call centre at the municipal office. According to officials, it initiated house-to-house surveys within municipal limits. So far, 42,012 households out of 43,897 have been scanned. To check the possible scarcity of beds, a speciality hospital was kept on standby in Vijayawada. Twenty ambulances were pressed into operation, and 300 beds and 150 doctors and nurses were kept ready for patients in GGH Eluru and Asram hospital. Food, milk and drinking water were supplied to all the patients. Specialist doctors from AIIMS were flown in to conduct a detailed investigation. Experts from the National Institute of Nutrition, Indian Institute of Chemical Technology, and Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology were roped in to figure out the cause of the disease.Possible causeBy December 10, potable water, cerebral spinal fluid, blood, and milk in the areas were tested and the CT scans of 42 patients were taken. Traces of heavy metals such as lead and nickel were found in the blood samples of patients, the AIIMS report said, but where they originated remains unclear. The Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology has concluded that the locals consumed a neurotoxic contaminant that has caused the outbreak. The Director of the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology, Rakesh Mishra, said, The Council of Scientific and Industrial Research and the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology carried out extensive analysis using the next generation sequencing-based approach to explore the microbiomes of samples collected from affected individuals. The samples included blood, faeces and vomitus. Our analysis showed no link between any infectious organism and this mysterious disease. The microbiomes were of healthy individuals. It is, therefore, likely that this disease was caused by a one-time event in a localised context and is not linked to any infectious organism. Considering the information available, it looks like a point-source outbreak where a neurotoxic contaminant has been consumed by the local people.Pesticide residueThe government constituted a multi-disciplinary high-power committee to investigate the source of the disease. The panel was also expected to suggest remedial measures to prevent any such event in the future. Headed by the Chief Secretary of Andhra Pradesh, the committee included doctors, scientists and senior officials from the Andhra Pradesh government.The Chief Minister, Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy, announced on December 16 the findings of the expert panel through a video conference call and wanted further investigation into the issue. According to the details shared by the government, the probability that pesticide residues triggered the illness is high. AIIMS and the Indian Institute of Chemical Technology also agreed that this probability was high, but wanted further investigation on how the pesticides entered human bodies. The two institutes have been entrusted with the responsibility of carrying out further investigation. The Chief Minister also instructed the officials concerned to set up public labs in each district and continue the tests on food, water and soil so that the Eluru incident is not repeated. He wanted the agriculture department to focus on natural farming without using pesticides and help farmers with inputs through the Rythu Bharosa Kendras (RBKs). Over 10,000 RBKs were set up in Andhra Pradesh with the objective of helping farmers to enhance productivity while ensuring better incomes.Various findingsCommenting on its findings, AIIMS, New Delhi stated that the blood samples of patients contained lead and nickel. All the milk samples that were collected also contained nickel. Based on the observations of patients, it said the reason for the illness could be the presence of organochloride which might have entered bodies through pesticides in the food cycle. Lead was also found in the blood samples of the relatives of the patients. AIIMS suggested that the food samples, food and vegetables be tested for a few months to help determine the exact reason for the illness. It also suggested geotagging of the samples.The Indian Institute of Chemical Technology collected 21 water samples from different parts of Eluru along with blood samples from humans and animals. It found no traces of lead, arsenic or any other heavy metals and pesticides in the water samples. However, the blood samples contained endosulfan and dichlorodiphenyltrichloethane (DDT), which are hazardous. Blood samples also contained lead and there were no organophosphates present.The National Environmental Engineering Research Institute, Hyderabad, which collected air, soil and ground water samples from the affected areas, said that the air quality is within acceptable limits. Except for mercury, all other metals and substances in surface and ground water are well within the limits. There were no traces of organochlorine or organophosphates in the samples. Compared to surface water, the ground water contained higher levels of mercury. The phenomenon was attributed to burning of solid waste in the region. The tests on soil are still underway.The Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology, Hyderabad, did not find any substances beyond the permissible limits in the serum and urine samples. There were also no traces of bacteria or virus, according to their report. The National Institute of Virology, Pune, said there was no evidence to prove any kind of viral infection. The National Institute of Nutrition, Hyderabad, found pesticide residues in the tomato and brinjal samples. These pesticides could have caused the mysterious illness, according to its report.AIIMS, Mangalagiri, suggested a detailed examination and study of samples in other regions of the State against the backdrop of the Eluru incident. While investigating the presence of pesticide residues in humans, it wanted the right inputs to be given to farmers on the use of pesticides and natural farming. It has also suggested a detailed medical protocol to be used in the event of such an occurrence in the future.The WHO representative wanted the expert panel to focus on how the pesticide residues entered human bodies.Poor hygieneMeanwhile, the public in Eluru feel that there should be a streamlining of pesticide and chemical usage and discharge of the same from agri and aqua processing sectors in and around the city. Though there were no formal complaints about the high and intensive usage of chemicals and pesticides, they expressed concern as Eluru is a major hub of aqua and agri exports. There are about 30 major aqua units which store, package, weigh and export aqua products such as shrimp and fish. These firms process, pack and export about 10,000 to 12,000 tonnes of processed product to different countries.In December, the general hygiene conditions and management of garbage in Eluru are alarming. Almost all the canals are filled with garbage, still water, and plastic materials, which are a potential threat to general health. Eluru generates approximately 82 metric tonnes of garbage per day.Several sources in and around Eluru leave effluents in irrigation and other canals which eventually seep into groundwater. The public spoke about industrial solid and liquid waste from aqua processing industries, effluents and pesticides mixing with water from aquaponds and agricultural patches. Eluru-based school teacher Sambasiva Rao said all the aqua industry certifications are upto the mark but there are violations. The Marine Products Export Development Authority frequently conducts camps for aqua farmers on the excessive use of non-organic fertilisers, pesticides, insecticides and antibiotics. We know about the intensive use of pesticides in agriculture. All these are obviously sinking into soil and groundwater. Its an open secret, he said. Senior citizen and resident of Eluru, M. Satyanarayana, said, Dumping garbage in open places and canals and water stagnation have become normal. There seems to be no tab on the use of pesticides and chemicals and discharge of different effluents here. This needs to change. The government should definitely focus on this aspect with commitment, he said.Meanwhile, with this illness causing fear among the people, eating out has become uncommon and public movement has reduced in Eluru, people said.Residents also said people from other regions are now sceptical about visiting Eluru. B. Subbarao, a resident of Powerpet, said he noticed people being extra careful. People are carrying their own water and eating out less. Fewer people are travelling to Eluru now. People have become suspicious of every small ailment. I had a headache a few days ago, and I was worried. But it turned out to be a normal headache. But the anxiety that something may happen to me is there all the time. I feel uneasy for no reason, Subbarao said.Doctors at GGH said that such mild paranoia is natural. Its common for the general public to take smaller illnesses more seriously and become anxious. We have had many cases at the GGH over the past few days where people who came for a check-up displayed high anxiety levels. It could be addressed in a matter of hours, said GGH Superintendent Mohan.The Andhra Pradesh State Health Minister Alla Kali Krishna Srinivas announced on December 13 that there were no new cases reported and all the 600 odd patients admitted in hospitals with symptoms of the illness were successfully treated and discharged. But the mysterious disease with no name has taken hold of peoples lives in Eluru. As trains near the Eluru railway station, passengers down the shutters. The sale of water bottles has reportedly seen a dip on platforms. It is as if the very air of Eluru has turned toxic.",TOMATO

The United States has been clear that perpetrators of human rights abuses like these are not welcome in our country,"" he said in a statement.US-China relations have plunged to their worst level in decades as the world's top two economies spar over issues ranging from the coronavirus outbreak, Beijing's national security law for Hong Kong, trade and espionage.On Friday, Washington added dozens of Chinese companies, including top chipmaker Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp and drone manufacturer SZ DJI Technology Co Ltd, to a trade blacklist.Also on Monday, US Department of Homeland Security chief Chad Wolf said it was looking at further restrictions on China, which he called an ever-increasing threat to the United States.Wolf told the Heritage Foundation think tank these included tighter visa curbs on Chinese Communist Party members and a broader ban on goods made with forced labor. He said DHS was also reviewing the activities of Chinese television maker TCL Electronics Holdings.Wolf noted a State Department action this month to reduce the validity of US visas for members of China's ruling Communist Party to one month.""We're ... working with State to consider further restrictions on visa validity periods for CCP members,"" he added.He said DHS was ""continuing to develop and hoped to soon issue"" a region-wide ban covering ""key categories of products produced with forced labor"" in China's Xinjiang region.Wolf did not elaborate, but he was apparently referring to a broad import ban on all cotton and tomato products from Xinjiang that the Trump administration considered this year before opting for narrower bans on products from specific entities.US apparel makers have criticized a broader ban as impossible to enforce.Wolf said DHS would soon issue a business advisory cautioning against using data services and equipment from firms linked to China and said it was ""reviewing entities such as the Chinese manufacturer TCL,"" the world's third largest manufacturer of TV sets.Wolf said it had been discovered this year that the firm had ""incorporated backdoors into all its TV sets, exposing users to cyber breaches and data exfiltration.""Wolf said DHS would soon release a ""Strategic Action Plan to counter the People's Republic of China"" that would draw on Trump's 2017 national security strategy and a 2020 document laying out a US strategic approach to Beijing.

As there are no takers for the vegetable in markets and prices offered are not even sufficient to cover the labour cost of harvesting and transportation, frustrated tomato growers are leaving the crop to rot in the fields.The farmers have hoped to recoup some of the losses they suffered due to the Nivar Cyclone in November, but low price for tomatoes has dashed their hopes.The crop is cultivated in around 4,000 hectares in the district and today it is being sold anywhere between 80 paise to Rs 1.30 a kg.It costs Rs 8,400 per acre for labour charges to harvest tomatoes, but a farmer will get only Rs 5,000 by selling his produce in an acre.In other words, a farmer will not even get back the labour cost of harvesting. So many farmers are not even ready to harvest the crop.armers said that to harvest tomatoes, a farmhand has to be paid Rs 250, and per acre, the cost of picking up the fruit and packing comes to around Rs 2,900.Transporting a box of 15 kg tomatoes costs Rs 16 and when rent, box cost and loading and unloading charges and mandi commission are added, the cost per box will come to around Rs 22.Per acre, Rs 250 boxes are required and the total cost of harvesting, packing and transporting will come to around Rs 8,400. However, at present, the box of 15 kg is going at Rs 20 and at that price, the total income from selling Rs 250 boxes will be Rs 5,000 only. In other words, a farmer will suffer a loss of Rs 3,400 on harvesting, packing and transport, in addition to the cultivation cost.The cost of cultivating tomatoes is increasing every season and with middlemen and mandi owners playing foul, we are suffering huge losses, lamented Gowtham, farmer in Nuthimadugu of Kambaduru mandal.The reason more number of farmers opting for tomato cultivation is its less duration (90 days). Each sapling of tomato costs Rs 70 paise to Rs 1.10 paise and 12,000 saplings are required per acre.That is, the cost of saplings per acre is around Rs 12,000. If the other farm inputs like sprayings are taken into consideration, it costs another Rs 80,000 per acre.When contacted, Anantapur Horticulture assistant director Chandraskehar said increasing the extent of tomato cultivation is decreasing the demand for its exports, resulting in the low prices.",TOMATO

Undeterred, the university went on to embrace the virtual medium, promote alternative techniques of sowing, win national and international recognition and support the farmers cause.After the nationwide lockdown was imposed in March, the university reached out to students virtually. It also successfully organised the first-ever virtual Kisan Mela in September. When travel restrictions led to paucity of trained farm labour across the state, experts from the university, under the aegis of director agriculture MS Bhullar, proposed the direct seeding of rice (DSR) technique for sowing, which was met by widespread scepticism. However, all detractors were silenced when the farmers reported a bumper crop. The university is on the verge of expansion with the state government deciding to set up PAU Colleges of Agriculture at Ballowal Saunkhri village in SBS Nagar and Kalanaur in Gurdaspur.Teaching and non-teaching unions staged agitations against the varsity authorities and demanded regularisation of contractual employees , implementation of the old pension scheme for employees recruited before July 9, 2012, bringing the grade pay of library and meteorological attendants at par with lab attendants, promotion of employees, and filling up of vacant positions. Though the employee union staged a 60- day strike, and Punjab Agricultural University Teachers Association (PAUTA) president HS Kingra went on a marathon eight-day hunger strike, no committee has been set up to consider the demands so far.With the ongoing agrarian agitation on the border, principal soil chemist Varinderpal Singh refused an award, a gold medal and citation during a function in New Delhi and PAU vice-chancellor BS Dhillon submitted a report compiled by the economics department to the Punjab government, highlighting flaws in the three farm laws.Seed scamIn June, the universitys name cropped up in a seed scam after it was found that Brar Seed Store near the universitys Gate Number 1 managed to procure and sell a large quantity of uncertified paddy variety seeds (PR-128) from the institutes Ladhowal Seed Farm. This raised questions over the sales protocols followed by the institute. An investigation was ordered and a few were arrests made.Varsity challenges Delhi on issue of farm firesAmid hue and cry over farm fires in Punjab contributing to pollution in the National Capital Region (NCR), a study carried out by department of climate change and agricultural meteorology head Prabhjyot Kaur Sidhu found that stubble burning in Punjab was a localised problem that did bot add to air pollution in New Delhi or the NCR. Rather, the practice affected the health of farmers and their kin, especially children, the study found.Rebuts Capitals microbial solutionIn November, days after the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government in New Delhi announced it had found a solution to the paddy stubble menace in the form a bio-decomposer, PAU scientists said microbes in the form of a decomposer were not the answer. The Indian Agricultural Research Institute, Pusa, had developed the decomposer. Microbe-based technologies, promoted and widely advertised, are being offered as stand-alone interventions. It is, however, clear that the application of microbes needs to be integrated with machine-based solutions, said Shammi Kapoor, dean, College of Basic Sciences and Humanities, PAU, in its study. Kapoor and additional director research GS Manes have also submitted a study to the vice-chancellor, which says a multipronged approach is the only way to manage stubble burning.The varsity inked several MoUs for commercialisation of different technologies amid the Covid-19 pandemic.Virtual fairThe universitys first virtual Kisan Mela that was held on September 18 and 19 was carried out successfully. Punjab chief minister of Punjab Captain Amarinder Singh inaugurated the fair, in which 2,65,740 men and women participated. Panel discussions (paddy straw management and direct seeded rice technology), technical sessions and field demonstrations were some of the major highlights.Facebook programme:A hit across bordersThe PAU Live Programme, which takes place every Wednesday on Facebook and YouTub, has received an overwhelming response from farmers of Punjab and adjoining states. Over 40,000-50,000 farmers view it. The programme was started to apprise and guide farmers about improved crop varieties, their production-protection technologies, allied agriculture occupations, and weather forecast. Interestingly, the programme also became a hit in Pakistan, where several agricultural science students and farmers have become avid viewers of this programme and routinely post questions to experts. Training programmes on diverse aspects of agriculture such as integrated crop production, crop residue management, mushroom cultivation, beekeeping, jaggery making, preservation of fruit and vegetables, soybean processing, bakery and confectionery products were also held.Hall of famePAU alum and United Nations World Food Programme Representative and Country Director to India Bishow Parajuli won the Nobel Peace Prize for his world food programme.

At a time when farmers were being offered Rs 2 per kg, we facilitated them to sell about four-and-a-half tonnes of tomato at Rs 15 per kg. This time, the plan is to help them sell about 12 tonnes of their produce at a better price, Kiran Chandra, resident, ForIT, told TOI, adding that while the IT employees paid for transport charges last weekend, this time, the farmers are more confident. Farmers are going to get vegetables and fruits directly to the city this time. All we have to do is show them a place to sell their fruits and vegetables, he added.Members of the forum said it is disheartening to see that farmers are not able to get the minimum support price for their produce. They said that because of the Delhi protests, denizens are aware of the farmers struggle and are sympathetic towards their cause. People are coming forward to buy directly from the farmers even if it means they have to spend slightly more, said Praveen Chandrahas, general secretary of the forum, adding that they received an overwhelming response from denizens last Saturday.",TOMATO

The concrete barricades, thorny iron fences and powerful water cannons have not been able to prevent their tractor trollies from reaching the vicinity of the national capital. They have been so determined and prepared that the Delhi winter has failed before them. Assembled in their thousands, they have established a new way of life at Singhu, Tikri, Ghazipur, Noida and Shahjahanpur. In some manner, the upsurge by these farmers resembles the Occupy Wallstreet Movement in the United States, in 2011, whose slogan reverberates even today across the world: We are the 99 percent.Unflinching willpowerThe government might have thought that the farmers would retreat to their villages after a couple of days or a week at the most, but this is not the mood at all among the farmers. As a frequent visitor to one or the other centres of struggle, this writer would definitely say that this farmers struggle is unique in the history of free India. A self-contained lifestyle with all necessary arrangements for food, shelter, clothing, and sanitation are in place. Scores of them, young and old, with whom this writer could interact with, represent the unflinching will of a people who consider agriculture as their culture. Their utmost proximity to soil and nature has tempered them as steel, while helping them remain calm and cool at the same time.Farmers protest | Farmers to escalate protest if deadlock continues on January 4The firefighters in the government who talk in different terms (may be purposefully), might have prepared their own strategy to face this struggle of the annadatas. Some of them say that the doors of dialogue are always kept open. There are certain others who are stubborn in saying that there can be no compromise on the implementation of the three Farm Bills. There are also those who still promise to take a relook if necessary, but only after two years. There is no need to ponder on this as most of these officials have been trained in a certain ideological school. As part of their campaign of malignment, the propaganda managers have labelled the farmers Khalistanis and urban naxalites.But these sons and daughters of the soil, who sow the seeds of hope to feed their fellow beings, have maintained inimitable self-restraint. Their struggle, their unity, their patience, and the massive nature of their battle are having an impact on the cohesive nature of the ruling alliance, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA). Following in the footsteps of NDA ally, the Shiromani Akali Dal that walked out of the NDA in support of the farmers, the Rashtriya Loktantrik Party has also snapped its ties with the alliance. Another important party that shares power with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Haryana continues to remain unhappy with the central governments approach to the farmers issues.The Narendra Modi government expected the farmers to tire out and slowly retreat from the battlefront. But it is mistaken. The determination by the farmers to go on with the struggle is only strengthening by the day. The Prime Minister himself has come forward to lead a frontal attack on the annadatas. Recently, he minced no words in expressing his disappointment while accusing the struggle of being a politically motivated one. The thrust of his attack was evident when he criticised the Opposition as misleading the farmers and shooting from their shoulders to target the government. In this tirade, the Prime Minister pointed a finger against the Left-led government in Kerala.Farmers protests | Ready to celebrate Lohri at the borders, but theres no going back now, say farmersThe situation in KeralaAll the allegations that he has levelled against the Kerala government are unfounded, and far from truth. In his exhortation that there are no Agricultural Produce Market Committees (APMCs) and mandis in Kerala, he presumed that the concept of the Minimum Support Price is not prevalent in the State. He has shut his eyes to the basic truth about the agricultural scenario in Kerala.It is true that mandis regulated by an APMC are not in existence in Kerala. But it does not mean that the interests of farmers are not taken care of in the State. In fact, Kerala is the State where farmers rights are being protected by the government itself, and much more effectively than any other Indian State.Also read | Do new agri Bills impact Kerala?While the government of India has fixed the procurement rate for rice at 18 a kg, the Left Democratic Front government in Kerala is procuring rice from cultivators at 27.48 a kg. In the same manner copra (dried coconut) is also procured at a much higher rate in Kerala than the price announced by the central government. Kerala is the State where increased basic price is ensured not only for paddy but also vegetables and fruits. Sixteen such items are enlisted by the government where the basic prices (per kg) are guaranteed. To cite some of them, tapioca (12), banana (30), garlic (139), pineapple (15), tomato (8), string beans (34), ladies fingers (20), cabbage (11) and potato (20).Apart from crop insurance, paddy cultivators will get the royalty in Kerala at the rate of 2,000 per hectare. They have a pension too, which is something unique in India. In 2006, when farmers suicides became the order of the day across the country, the Left Front government introduced a debt relief commission that extended a helping hand to the farmers, thereby saving them.Also read | Kerala Assembly passes resolution urging Centre to scrap farm lawsThere is basis for a counterNo BJP-led government in the country can even imagine the measures that the Left government in Kerala has initiated for the welfare of farmers. Instead of understanding those measures, the Prime Minister has chosen to train his political guns on the Kerala government and the farmers. The influence of corporates on his allegations is clear. The Left has the moral and political authority to engage in any polemics with the BJP-led central government in this regard.It is intriguing why the Prime Minister has never said a word about the experience of Bihar where mandis were abolished in 2006 and the plight of farmers that only worsened after this measure was initiated. After the three farm ordinances of June 2020, 40% of mandis in Madhya Pradesh have registered only zero transactions.Also read | Mandis not an option for Kerala: Agriculture MinisterThe corporate stampThis is the reality of the farm Bills. Though they claim to enable the protection and the empowerment of farmers, the truth is just the opposite. The purpose of these laws is the enabling of the corporatisation of Indian agriculture and the introduction of contract farming. When Ministers continue to assure the continuance of mandis they are practically pushed out of the scene, as it happened in Madhya Pradesh and elsewhere. The annadatas have been able to foresee the evil in the three farm laws that would eventually find them at the mercy of corporate profit mongers. They know that these laws would ruin the backbone of the agricultural economy and badly affect the food security of India.Also read | You are being misled, Narendra Modi tells farmersThe farmers are in the struggle in order to prevent such a calamity from happening. It is high time that the Prime Minister and his government understand the patriotic and selfless role being played by the food providers of the country and the genuine nature and cause of their struggle.Binoy Viswam is Secretary, CPI National Council, and leader of the party in Parliament.

The scrub is good for removing dead skin.Mira also shared her go-to DIY facial routine  first, she applies lemon juice on her face. After removing it, she applies a mask made with besan (gram flour) and curd. To this mixture, you can also add other ingredients; Mira, for instance, adds orange peel powder, moringa powder, neem powder, and so on. Once the mask is semi-dry, rub your skin gradually to remove it.Following the mask, she puts tomato juice on her face. Cut a tomato and apply it straight on your face. Leave it for another 10-12 minutes and then remove.The facial routine is completed with aloe vera, which has many benefits for the skin.

While most farmers then decided to remain put at the borders  saying authorities wanted to push them into a corner  about 400 eventually moved to the Burari ground.Pointing to a volleyball net tied between a branch and a tent, Jagdeep Singh (24) from Punjabs Faridkot said on Tuesday, A sewadar from Delhi donated this net to us 10 days ago. Since then, some of us gather to play in the evenings. Farmers cannot sit idle, it is in our blood to do something productive. For the same reason, a number of older farmers decided to make use of the land and grow a few vegetables.Rows of 12-day-old onion plants are being cultivated not far from the 40 tractors at the site. Said Gurudev Singh Manga (42): They will take around 60 days to start yielding onions. It is symbolic of the fact that we will not move from here anytime soon.Gurudev and others from Ropar district in Punjab reached the site in the last week of November: We keep visiting Singhu and Tikri, but we will not go anywhere as it is easier to march to Delhi from here.At another corner of the site, Jaskaran Singh Kahan (58) and his family from Firozpur tend to the rows of corn, spinach, tomato and onion: There are 15 corn trees and two rows each of other vegetables. Once it becomes a bit warmer, we will grow rice and a few more vegetables. That way, we do not have to depend on resources from outside.He added that some were grown from leftover vegetables, while some seeds and plants were purchased from a nursery nearby. He said that they will be grown organically as the quality of the mud is good.While sporadic rains have been a boon for these crops, they have posed a new set of challenges. Many farmers dug trenches around their tents and tractors when they were expecting rain so water wouldnt accumulate where they sleep.For others, who have set up bigger tents with cloth on the ground, this was not an option. Pinderjeet Kaur (32), who joined her father-in-law at the protest, came to Delhi in a private vehicle along with her husband and two children. She said, Ten of us, including the children, sleep on three mattresses, which are now wet because of the rain the roof of the tents keep flying at night as well. She said nobody has given them a fresh set of mattresses and that they would have to wait for them to dry.Meanwhile, groups of farmers worked through the day to set up sheds for the two langars at the site. Jaspaal Singh (58) from Faridkot said a number of items come in from Singhu and Tikri borders. When we need something, we tap our networks there. Apart from that, people from Delhi come to our aid. The day it rained, a few sewadaars came and gave us material to set up tents, including asbestos, logs of wood, nails and hammers.As the evening set in, both langars had been sheltered from the drizzle, and farmers said they no longer had to worry about cooking in the rain.",TOMATO

But going just by the looks of it may prove fatal considering the extent of spurious food that have made their way into the open markets, particularly from Cuttack. The recent raids by the Commissionerate Police are a pointer to the volume of fake and sub-standard food items laced with chemicals flooding the markets.What are you consuming?From ghee, honey, turmeric and chilli powders to tomato sauce and soya chunks, the food adulteration network runs deep. The products are prepared using harmful chemicals, colours and sold to unsuspecting consumers at cheaper rates. A report suggests that spurious ghee is a heady mix of palm oil, vanaspati and yellow chemical colour; honey is prepared using water, sugar and chemical colour. For turmeric powder, the adulterators use waste rice powder and non-edible synthetic yellow colour.The list does not end here. Soya chunks are prepared using flour and ammonium bicarbonate (a levelling agent) that makes the dough light and airy besides, chilli powder is laced with non-edible aniline dyes. The innocuous ketchups that go into your noodles, rolls and fast food are prepared using cheap red, orange and green colours along with a mixture of pumpkin, potato and tomato paste. These sauces are easily available in the market and commonly used by street food vendors.Capital Hospitals Department of Forensic Medicine and Toxicology (FMT) consultant Dr LK Behera says adulterated food can cause serious health hazards and lead to diseases like cancer. Turmeric is often adulterated by mixing wood powder and can cause obstruction in the intestine while chemicals in food products can cause cancer, gastroenteritis, liver and skin diseases, and others, he says.Profits First, Health SecondThe trade of spurious food is booming and food adulterators make a profit of 200 per cent (pc) through the illegal trade as cost of production is cheap.For example, production cost of a kg of refined honey is Rs 200 but that of adulterated honey is only Rs 40 which though sells for Rs 140 per kg in the market, says a report by Commissionerate Police. Whereas pure honey costs Rs 300 a kg and has a profit margin of 15 pc, sale of spurious honey brings 100 pc profit.Similarly, production of branded and popular tomato or chilli sauce would cost Rs 120 per kg but the spurious and low-quality costs only Rs 30. The genuine sauce costs Rs 160 per kg having a profit margin of 20 pc but the fake one is sold at Rs 70 per kg with an 80 pc profit margin.The production cost of pure turmeric and chilli powders is Rs 150 per kg and adulterated is Rs 70 per kg. Unadulterated turmeric and chilli powders are available for Rs 260 per kg with a profit margin of 20 pc and the spurious powders are sold for Rs 120 per kg having a profit margin of about 60 pc.Similarly, adulteration of clarified butter or ghee is equally profitable with the unscrupulous elements earning 40 pc profit from the business. Production of ghee costs Rs 300 per kg and a kg of the spurious stock can be prepared with just Rs 80. Pure ghee is available in the market between Rs 350 and Rs 500, the spurious counterpart is available at Rs 150 a kg.When it comes to soybeans, production cost is Rs 60 per kg as compared to Rs 30 per kg for the unadulterated item. Soybeans are sold for Rs 80 per kg in the market with 15 pc profit margin as compared to Rs 50 for the adulterated product having 40 pc profit margin. Its the high profit margin which drives these spurious food manufactures to sustain, says Cuttack DCP Prateek Singh who has gone after the adulterators in his area of operation.The Market & ConsumersThe recent raids show food adulteration mafia operates mostly out of Cuttack city and Jagatpur which are hubs of manufacturing consumer goods besides outskirts of the Millennium City where they can remain low-profile. The businesses have been flourishing as surveillance by Cuttack district administration as well as the municipal corporation is next to nothing.The consumer base, though, is spread across the region and food class. Much of the low-standard food is consumed by caterers which use the cost advantage to save on spending. Fast food makers are a big consumer base too as they pay little attention to health and hygiene; nor do their buyers.These manufacturers also focus on suburban and rural landscape of neighbouring districts where quality of packaged food is never under scrutiny due to poor surveillance of Food Supplies and Consumer Welfare Department, says an officer.Last year, Commissionerate Police alone registered 21 cases against production of adulterated food items and arrested 25 persons arrested while seizing goods worth over Rs 7.36 crore. This means the overall business of such spurious food manufacturers run into tens of crores rupees across the State, just going by the volume exposed by Twin City Police.Intensifying SurveillanceThe raids have led to alarm but also brought relief from people in general that adulterated food is being obliterated from the markets. Locals have urged police to continue raids at food manufacturing units to arrest the menace. Surveillance is the need of the hour, they said. Apparently, such illegal units continue to thrive due to complacence of the municipal corporations and district administrations. Consider this: Odisha scored only 53.15 pc in Food Safety and Standards Authority of Indias second State Food Safety Index in 2019-20.This index is based on performance of the State on five significant parameters - human resources and institutional data, compliance, food testing (infrastructure and surveillance), training and capacity building, and consumer empowerment. The Index is a dynamic quantitative and qualitative benchmarking model that provides an objective framework for evaluating food safety across all States/UTs. FSSAI states that states scoring below 60 pc score need a push.Keep an Eye on PricesCuttack-Bhubaneswar Police Commissioner Sudhanshu Sarangi has urged citizens to not compromise with price while buying food items as adulterated products cost less in open markets. People must inform police if they find the price of a food product to be surprisingly low.Our raids will continue so that health is not a casualty. We have also requested Odisha Industrial Infrastructure Development Corporation to review the land allotment of the units found to be involved in manufacturing adulterated food items and take necessary action against them, said Sarangi.Food adulteration is conducted to alter the taste and quantity and can have serious impacts on an individuals health. People must be alert, Dr Behera cautions.",TOMATO

Thats how during that time dried and bottled food items especially the condiments like dried onion powder, lemon powder, fried onion ringlets among a gamut of several such other food products.Thats when a city-based entrepreneur Anubhav Bhatnagar, an XLRI alumnus launched a food range with a shelf life of 12-18 months. His startup Zillis is incubated under Atal Incubation Center ALEAP We-hub.The quick DIYs range that also helps to reduce the cooking time have preservatives in them. So while it is about quick food, what assures the same is healthy? Shares Anubhav, The fruits and vegetables have a short shelf life of 7-15 days and they attract fungus and bacteria because of the moisture in them. We follow an age-old technique of dehydration of preserving the food by removing moisture.He cites an example of grandmothers using the process of dehydration by drying chips and papad under the sunlight to remove moisture content.Once dried it can stay up to 1-2 years without attracting fungus and bacteria. Our process is based on the similar concept of drying the fruit and vegetable under hot air to remove moisture content and then making the powder, he adds.He tried making the first product in the kitchen using a microwave oven. I failed multiple times, burnt a lot of onions and garlic to arrive at my desired product. I tried using dehydrated onion and garlic in my curries to understand the difference (good or bad) it brought to my recipes. I was excited to find out that my curries even tasted better and just a spoonful of these powders was enough to bring that natural flavour. Not only did I not have to chop onions and garlic, he says.The powders did not require any roasting as well since they were dehydrated and hence, in concentrated form. This reduced my cooking time almost to half! This is how to we provide RTC products to our customer without compromising on health, he shares. The products that his startup offers are red onion powder, tomato powder, green chilli powder, garlic powder among other items.We also have five blends in our product catalogue and we are consistently working towards launching many more.Kolkata Jhal Muri (Murmura/Puffed Rice) Masala can be used in puffed rice with chopped onions, green chillies, coriander leaves, coconut, peanuts mixed in a small quantity of mustard oil and blended with the goodness of spices which makes it a very tasty and healthy snack. We have come up with this authentic blend straight from our kitchen for this snack, he informs.They have six fruit roll-ups and fried onion flakes as well.",TOMATO

(Representational)The Trump administration announced an import ban on all cotton and tomato products from western Chinas Xinjiang region on Wednesday over allegations that they are made with forced labor from detained Uighur Muslims.U.S. Customs and Border Protection said the order applies to raw fibers, apparel and textiles made from Xinjiang-grown cotton, as well as canned tomatoes, sauces, seeds and other tomato products from the region, even if processed or manufactured in third countries.Read | How China won Trumps trade war and got americans to foot the billThe agency, which is part of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), estimates that about $9 billion of cotton products and $10 million worth of tomato products were imported from China into the United States in the past year.DHS acting deputy secretary Kenneth Cuccinelli told a news briefing the order sends a message to importers that DHS will not tolerate forced labor of any kind and companies should eradicate Xinjiang products from their supply chains.The move is the latest by the Trump administration in its final days to harden the U.S. position against Beijing, erecting economic penalties that would make it more difficult for President-elect Joe Biden to ease U.S.-China tensions after he takes office on Jan. 20.In December, Congress passed the bipartisan Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, which assumes that all goods manufactured in Xinjiang are made with forced labor and therefore banned, unless CBP certifies otherwise.Read | Uighur exploitation in China slammed as modern day slaverySecretary of State Mike Pompeo, in his final days in office, has been weighing a determination as to whether forced labor in Xinjiang constitutes an atrocity or labeling it genocide, which analysts say would have significant implications for relations with China.The region wide import ban follows a move to block cotton imports from Chinas largest producer, the military-linked Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps (XPCC).Both will have a big impact on cotton production in Xinjiang, which produces as much as 20% of the worlds supply of the commodity.Cotton futures prices fell slightly on Wednesday, but traders attributed the drop to profit-taking after prices hit a two year high on a U.S. production outlook cut.CBP officials said some 43 shipments of cotton-based products have been detained at U.S. entry ports since the XPCC ban was announced.The U.S. apparel industry had previously criticized a broad ban as impossible to enforce. On Tuesday, a coalition of apparel and retail groups said in a joint statement that members were working to push forced labor from their supply chains but hoped to work with CBP to make sure that enforcement is smart, transparent, targeted and effective.The United Nations cites what it says are credible reports that 1 million Muslims held in camps have been put to work in Xinjiang and faith leaders, activist groups and others have said crimes against humanity, including genocide, are taking place.China denies mistreating Uighurs and says the camps are vocational training centers needed to fight extremism.The Chinese embassy in Washington said in a statement the forced labor issue was a political lie and vowed to take actions to safeguard the rights of its companies.The U.S. side resorts to pressure, sanctions and other means to suppress Xinjiang enterprises and undercut Xinjiangs stability, development and prosperity, the statement said.",TOMATO

Cauliflower, for instance, is selling at Rs 3.50 per kg at the weekly markets and mandis and tomato for as low as Rs 10 per kg.This is because many Haryana farmers are selling their produce directly in the Gurgaon mandis instead of the main market at Delhis Ghazipur. Since several roads are blocked in the national capital, it has been difficult for them to reach Ghazipur, from where their produce is routed to states like UP, Punjab, Himachal and Rajasthan. But with truck movement severely disrupted because of the blockades  the UP Gate protest site is, in fact, right next to the Ghazipur mandi  farmers are opting to sell their produce in Gurgaon and cut their losses.In fact, prices of almost all vegetables have come down by 50 to 75% in the past 20 days. Apart from the local vegetable markets, veggies on aggregator apps and in stores inside condominiums have also been selling at a low price.According to farmers, apart from the blocked roads, the absence of a cold storage facility in Gurgaon is forcing them to sell their produce at a lower rate as they are unable to preserve the veggies. Usually farmers from Pataudi, Farrukhnagar, Nuh, Jhajjar and other nearby districts of Haryana sell their produce at the Ghazipur mandi. However the blockade of arterial roads has meant that sales of fruits and vegetables have shrunk close to 50% at the capitals wholesale market for over a month now.Sellers from Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan are unable to visit the Ghazipur mandi, which has started to hurt their business. Vegetable sales are 50% less than a month ago, said Anil Yadav, a member of the Azadpur mandi, and wholesaler at the Khandsa mandi in Gurgaon. The detour has increased the transport freight and shortage of trucks has also affected our business. Transportation of onions, bottle gourd, bitter gourd, ginger, garlic to north Indian states has come down substantially due to the unavailability of trucks.Rajinder Kumar, a wholesaler, said vegetables are being literally dumped at the Gurgaon mandi. Earlier, vegetables from the neighbouring districts were transported to Delhi. But nowadays, instead of selling their crop in the mandis there, farmers are dumping the same in the wholesale market in Gurgaon. The current climatic conditions are favourable for vegetables and thus a large number of farmers in the adjoining district have been bringing huge quantities of vegetables to the local markets.The rates of onions and potatoes have also seen a dip, being sold at Rs 25 per kg and Rs 15 per kg, respectively, on Wednesday. The price of radish and carrot is Rs 10 per kg, while peas and pumpkin are being sold for Rs 25.Hemant Kumar, another wholesaler, said he has witnessed this sharp slump in vegetable prices for the first time. Be it radish, carrot, onion or potato, prices of all vegetables have crashed. The oversupply in the market is only leading to drop in prices as buyers are less, he said.At present, only 6,000 trucks are moving in and out of Delhi. Earlier this number used to be around a lakh. Not only vegetables, but prices of all essential goods have been impacted, said Rajinder Kapoor, president of Delhi Goods Transport Association.Meanwhile, consumers are a delighted lot. This is the first time that I got five different veggies for less than Rs 40 a kg. I am surprised that I am able to purchase vegetables for such a low price in an expensive city like Gurgaon, said Megha Chawla, a Sector 56 resident.",TOMATO

The venue and dates of the fest will be declared soon. District magistrate Kaushal Raj Sharma has held meetings for assigning roles of agriculture, horticulture, culture, tourism departments, Indian Institute of Vegetable Research, Varanasi Municipal Corporation and Varanasi Development Authority. We will rope in hotels, restaurants, chefs and housewives.District horticulture officer Sandeep Kumar Gupta said, Tomato and onion are two vegetable that witness massive price fluctuation. When the prices start rising, there is massive hue and cry. But, mostly the price of tomato doesnt rise and farmers are compelled to sell it for Rs 3-Rs 10 per kg. Risk for tomato growers is also high as it is perishable and cant be stored for long.As per rough estimates, tomato is cultivated in over 5,000 hectare in Mirzapur, Sonbhadra, Naugarh belt of Chandauli, Ghazipur and Varanasi, and on an average 350 quintal of hybrid tomato is produced per hectare, said Gupta.It is a good move of the government and will help increase local and industrial consumption of tomato which will ensure good price round the year, he added.The fest will help farmers understand the requirements of hospitality and industrial sectors and the varieties of tomatoes best suited for them.Gaurav Garg, the chief executive officer of the event management company assigned this fest, said, It will be a good event. Housewives and master chefs will be participating and cooking their own dishes, while hotels, restaurants and vendors will also showcase their tomato-based food, drink and dessert items.

If all goes well, I hope to have a satiating Vishu feast in a couple of months at my Malayali friends place. Since sadhya is usually vegetarian, I thought I should, meanwhile, make the most of some fluffy appam and chicken stew. I went to the net and found that there were two new Kerala restaurants in my neighbourhood. I decided that Id try both out.The first was Kannur (Ph: 8750483283), and the second Mariyan (Ph: 8447127533), both in Mayur Vihar Phase III. From Kannur, I ordered some parottas (10 each), chicken curry (120), buffalo meat fry (120), tomato fry (50) and (by mistake) kadhai paneer (140). With taxes and delivery charges, the bill came to about 660.From Mariyan, a few days later, we asked for the Mariyan Special Chettinad chicken curry (180)  though this is not from Kerala  buff meat dry fry (160) and appam (12 each).On the two menus are also dishes such as vegetable korma, kadala curry, egg roast, biryani and various kinds of fish preparations.I love both parottas and appams. Kannurs parottas were flaky and crisp. I had one with the chicken curry gravy, which was nicely spicy, and the tomato fry, which was rather interesting  tart, but not overly so. Even though the paneer was not on my list, it turned out to be pretty good: the pieces were soft, and the gravy was thick and creamy.I was looking forward to the buffalo meat fry, but that sorely disappointed me. I tried out a piece when it arrived, and found it much too hard. So I pressure cooked it a bit, but even then it was too chewy. I had thought Id have one parotta with the meat fry, but after bravely struggling with the meat, I gave up.Appam | Photo Credit: iStockphotoMariyans buffalo meat fry, however, was delicious. It was a bit different from the ones that Ive had over the years. For one, it didnt have the little coconut bits that the Kannur buff had (I really enjoy the fried coconut in this dish). Second, the meat had been cut into strips, like small fish fingers. And the pieces had been dredged with corn flour and masalas, and then fried. It had a heady flavour of garlic, and the cornflour gave it an enjoyable crunch.The Chettinad chicken curry was delicious, too. The gravy was thick and had a coconutty taste, while the meat was so tender that it fell off the bone. I had the curry with two appams (which, despite the 6-odd-kilometre journey, were fluffy and soft when I had them for dinner). I missed not having parottas with the buffalo meat.Well, that can soon be remedied; all that I need to do is make a call. I am glad I have these small Kerala eateries in my neighbourhood. There was a time, not so long ago, when I used to comb the areas around hospitals in search of good Kerala food. Hospitals meant staffers from Kerala, which, in turn, translated into good regional food. Now, these eateries can be found in all parts of Delhi.

While a kilogram of drumstick at Koyambedu Wholesale Market Complex (KWMC) costs Rs 120, curry leaves was sold at Rs 60 a kg. Traders attributed the unprecedented increase to a drop in arrivals to the market.V R Soundararajan, a former member of the market management committee of KWMC and a wholesale trader, said unseasonal rain damaged crops, resulting in short supply and price rise. Harvest and ,in turn, arrivals to Chennai, have reduced. I havent seen such high prices sustain in the wholesale market in the past. Wholesale cost of curry leaves has never exceeded Rs 30 per kilogram, he said.Curry leaves, which cost Rs 80/kg last week, will be sold for Rs 60 this week. The Rs 20 drop was due to a dip in sales, Soundararajan said. Koyambedu market sources curry leaves from Mettupalayam in Coimbatore district and parts of Andhra Pradesh.Cost of drumstick too has reduced by Rs 20 and will cost Rs 120 a kg this week. The market currently gets only 100 tonnes of drumstick a day, 50% of the daily average of 200 tonnes of drumstick supplied usually. The highest the vegetable cost all of last year was Rs 60/kg and at times, dropped to Rs 15/kg.

He said his meeting with farmers throughout the State was to understand their fears and raise it in the Assembly seeking answers from the government.Mr. Vikramarka alleged that both the Central and State governments were terrorising the farmers foisting false cases but the Congress party would support the farmers when they need political support the most.Explaining how lack of government support will hurt the farmers, he said tomato farmers in Narayankhed recently had to throw away their produce due to lack of support price. Neither the traders were willing to buy nor the government was helping and they just threw away the produce on the roads.He said both Narendra Modi and KCR were together in cheating the farmers to ensure their crony capitalists benefited.

This is not just a business, but its our passion project, asserts Abhipsa who quit her job at a call centre to start this kitchen with her mother. And the passion surely transcends into the delicious food that they make. Specialising in Marwari cuisine, giving healthy twists to regular food is what sets them apart.For instance, the Rajkachori that I had was made in fresh, crisp poori stuffed with dhokla made with spinach and topped with sev, coriander and tamarind chutney and curd. The green dhokla gave the chaat a splash of colour and a unique twist to this street-food. Abhipsa says, Some people do not prefer aloo, so we add dhokla.Abhipsa ans Nirmala TulshanThe Marwari lunch that followed was a simple meal that had the quintessential tastes of ghar ka khana, without any added colours, preservatives or extra oil. The paneer badami was not spicy, was a little sweet in light tomato gravy topped with slivers of almonds. It paired well with hara bhara parathas made of wheat. The nutritious rotis were soft and thankfully, not oily. The meal also had a mix of dal chawal  typical tuvar daal in a flavourful tadka mixed with white rice.Two types of home-made pickles  one with red chillies and the other made with potatoes and green peas! Yes, you read right, and it was lip-smacking. Fluffy and tangy dahi vada and gaund laddoo ended the meal. The healthy laddoo made of jaggery had a nice crunch, and we couldnt stop at just one. The USP of our food is that each and every component is made at home and we dont compromise on the quality of the ingredients, shares the duo that runs this with five other staff.Not just sticking to traditional Mawari food, they also make international dishes such as spinach rice with veg augratin, pastas, burgers, etc. On the range of food, she says, We started with daily meals and chaats to fill the gap for good ghar ka khana, which became an instant hit. We moved on to making homemade dry snacks like bhel, jhaal muri, mathris, and flavoured bhujiyas. Abhipsa credits her mother Nirmala for these recipes.Always open to adaptation, she adds, We customise our starters; whip up new dishes and tweak the old ones of my mothers recipes. As they do not have a fixed menu and also do on-site catering, orders have to be placed two days in advance. Food is delivered in leak-proof packaging using local courier services.

The music starts getting louder with the space getting busier by 9:00pm.Owner Zorawar Kalra says, We built Swan to cater to the sensibility of the modern day ladies and gents, with a focus on clean aesthetics and a romantic vibe. And just to be clear, a swan on the menu is totally ruled out. The fine dine restaurant serves a mix of Japanese and Italian cuisines. We started with the Mushroom Cappuccino Soup, a creamy soup topped with truffle oil and served with ladyfinger cookie topped with chives and cream. The combo: deadly.The crispy Avocado Toast came laden with tangy and creamy avocado paste and was well-made. The asparagus fritters in the Asparagus Tempura Maki Roll, were covered in rice and fried to crisp, and paired well with a strongly-flavoured sauce. The baby wild mushrooms complemented the cream and parmesan cheese in the Porcini Mushroom Risotto.In the non-vegetarian, Herbs Marinated Chargrilled Prawns were a sheer delight. Grilled prawns drizzled with tomato pickle mayo were tender and delicious, so were the Lamb Chops. But if you want to keep your dining experience light, skip the latter as its quite oily.Swan also offers a variety of pastas, pizzas and Robata dishes, apart from Nigiri and Sashimi. Edamame and Asparagus Gyozas were not over boiled like the Indian version of dumplings and one could feel the crunchiness of the veggies, and spicy jalapeno sauce made for the best accompaniment.Swan makes for good brunch and dinner.

While they continue to juggle to do their best in the personal and professional front, one thing that often gets ignored is their health. Women tend to miss out on some of the most beneficial supplements in the daily grind, also, due to lack of awareness about their benefits. Take, Vitamin C, for instance, the immunity boosting, and often misunderstood vitamin. It is water soluble, hence, your body cannot store it. This is precisely why you need to consume it every day through food and other supplements, for it to have the required effect in the body. Dietary recommendations for Vitamin C are often not met because of poor lifestyle, various diseases, smoking, alcohol, or drug abuse.Now, while most properties of Vitamin C help both genders the same, especially in boosting immunity, there are some that work particularly well for women. As women multi-task around the clock, lead hectic lifestyles and often fall prey to many lifestyle diseases, supplements like Vitamin C balance what their diets could be missing, lets take a closer look at the advantages of Vitamin C for women.This water-soluble nutrient acts a powerful antioxidant is needed for the development and maintenance of arterioles, scar tissues and cartilage. Collagen is a substance that is naturally produced by the body. However, the production of this substance diminishes as people grow older. Vitamin C plays an integral part in the production of collagen which therefore decreases wrinkles and the symptoms and signs of aging.Due to the needs of the developing foetus and the growing infant, vitamin C requirements are enhanced for pregnant and lactating women. The Vitamin C status of pregnant women is often lower than non-pregnant women, presumably due to active transfer of Vitamin C to the foetus. Women with complications of pregnancy can have much lower vitamin C status l. Supplementation of pregnant women with Vitamin C can potentially decrease the risk of pregnancy-related complications.Stress can affect various processes in the body like hormone production, the menstrual cycle, and fertility in women and men as well as digestion and immune function. When your body is exposed to stressful stimuli, the body makes the body makes it the priority over many other important processes. Vitamin C helps in dealing with typical indicators of physical and emotional stress. It also decreases the level of stress hormones. Hypertension is an important risk factor for cardiovascular disease in women but is often underestimated and undiagnosed. Incidences of abnormally high blood pressure can be lowered by the regular intake of Vitamin C.Vitamin C supplements can help improve the absorption of iron from the diet. Vitamin C assists in converting iron that is poorly absorbed, such as plant-based sources of iron, into a form that is easier to absorb. As a result, it may help reduce the risk of anaemia among people prone to iron deficiency.Vitamin C supplements have been linked to a reduced risk of heart disease. These supplements may reduce the impact of known risk factors for heart disease such as high blood levels of LDL (bad) cholesterol and triglycerides.Vitamin C can elevate your estrogen levels and lower progesterone levels. This causes the uterus to contract and the lining of the uterus to break down, leading to the onset of menstruation.The daily intake of Vitamin C depends on the country you are residing in. In India, you need 65-115 mg of Vitamin C depending on your age.66 mg/day68 mg/day65 mg/day80 mg/day115 mg/dayCitrus fruits, tomatoes and tomato juice, and potatoes are major contributors of Vitamin C. Other good food sources include red and green peppers, kiwifruit, broccoli, strawberries, brussels sprouts, and cantaloupe. Not all fruits and vegetables have equal levels of Vitamin C. For instance, bananas and apples are quite low in Vitamin C whereas oranges, strawberries, tomato, kiwi have a higher content. Vitamin C supplements are available as tablets, capsules, chewable tablets, gummies, and effervescent tablets. Not all Vitamin C supplements are created equal. To better ensure quality and safety, choose supplements that have been tested and certified by an authorised certifying body, such as the FSSAI (The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India).Vitamin C is a water-soluble vitamin that must be obtained from the diet or supplements. Vitamin C plays an important role in strengthening your immune system thus enabling you to lead a healthy life.",TOMATO

Those citrusy bites were my only gustatory awakenings in the sleepy blandness that COVID-19 brought into my life. But, I could not smell them.Close your eyes and picture your favourite food. It is likely that the first thing you thought of was how it smells. The parts of your brain that process your emotions and memories use olfactory data, linking them closely. Our sense of smell richens our sense of taste.So when you wake up one morning and lose both, the world around you shifts slightly. You dont realise it but you miss the stimuli that were anchoring you: the smell of your skin, your bedsheets, wet soil in the garden, the shampoo in your hair, breakfast cooking in the kitchen.It happened to me in February, after I caught COVID-19. But to Chindi Varadarajulu, it happened 30 years ago  a severe flu during her second winter in Vancouver, Canada, left the would-be chefs nose incapable of sniffing out flavours.I am still upset that I have never smelt real lilacs, says Chindi. After appointments with specialists in Singapore and Canada, she had a name for the condition: anosmia.Chef Chindi Varadarajulu, founder of Pumpkin TalesIn the past year, anosmia has become a significant marker of Covid. Or in my case  parosmia, where instead of an olfactory vacuum, familiar smells seem distorted. For a few days, I wondered if anyone had spilled anything rancid in the vicinity. Did our dog kill a rat we did not know about? Because it seemed as though a stench would follow me around, stuck inside my nose.Around the world, as there is greater research on long covid, there may be relief for people whose symptoms have still not abated, even after testing negative.Thirty years on, Chindis sense of smell still has not returned. Still, it did not pull her back from a career in the culinary arts. Could her journey provide some answers for those who still show symptoms of anosmia?For a year after I stopped being able to smell, I tried nasal sprays of all sorts. Sometimes I would convince myself that I smelled something familiar  but it was just like a phantom itch, says Chindi.At her first restaurant in Vancouver, set up in 2003, she remembers accidentally burning a batch of dal, failing to notice and put it out until someone drew her attention to it. Today, she creates new recipes out of memories of old flavours, and has her team at Pumpkin Tales in Chennai test it out.She can do this because all these years, she has been making up for her lack of smell through an accentuated sense of taste.I may not be able to identify flavour profiles [a combination of taste and smell] but my taste is enhanced in many ways. For instance, tamarind, tomato, lemon  these are all sour tastes, but to different degrees: some sharp, some more rounded, some leave a bitter aftertaste, some sweet. I can appreciate all of that because of my years of training in it, says Chindi.I could see how visually appealing the meal was: a dollop of ghee melting over the tomato dal, seasoned with herbs and greens. But inside my mouth, it was a hot lump of nothingnessThe passion with which she speaks of taste reminds me of the two weeks I spent bereft of it. At lunchtime, I could see how visually appealing the meal was: a dollop of ghee melting over the tomato dal, seasoned with herbs and greens. But inside my mouth, it was a hot lump of nothingness. Fluffy rotis were like wet paper; evening snacks nothing better than an exercise in chewing.So of course, after getting my taste back, the first swirl of peanut butter chocolate ice cream made me feel complete in a way nothing else has.Chindi encourages me to pay more attention to the food I eat, and I readily agree. Take in the texture. Look at what you are eating and associate it with what youre feeling in your mouth, focus on the balance of tastes, she recommends.Train yourselfPay attention because if it slips away, you might not notice all at once. For, while there are eye charts and hearing tests, there are not many quantitative ways we can measure our power of smell and taste. Which is why, many people who have been infected with Covid once find it difficult to say for sure whether their senses have returned completely.Smell kits help. Comprising essential flavour profiles, they help associate odours with the correct source, almost willing your brain into recognising and remembering them.Back in February, I would do an informal training every day, as I picked up an apple or my favourite bar of soap, sniffing it, trying to remember what it smelt like.After I was reacquainted with a familiar smell  a cloud of freshly sprayed disinfectant, I rushed to the kitchen, sniffing spice after spice like some strange dog-woman. Most I could recognise again, but some are muffled till date.You should come over to the restaurant once, offers Chindi, We can do a smell-test and see how many you get right. I look forward to it.",TOMATO

This is the second such announcement he has made after he promised to create another district with Arani (Tiruvannamalai) as its headquarters, last Sunday.Giving a fillip to micro-level administration, and to ensure that the people have easy access to government schemes, Palaniswami in the past four years carved out six new districts Kallakurichi, Tenkasi, Chengalpattu, Tirupattur, Ranipet and Mayiladuthurai. As of now, Tamil Nadu has 38 districts.Earlier in the day, while campaigning in Karur, Palaniswami recalled his connection with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. It was Modi who guided me when I took over as the CM. He shared his experiences as the CM of Gujarat, and it was he who gave the good advice that has helped in the development of our State. He further stated, Union Home Minister Amit Shah has helped us whenever we asked for it.The Centre has provided `1 lakh crore to Tamil Nadu for the construction of National Highways only because we have a very close alliance with them. In another development, veteran leader and DMKs agriculture wing State secretary, M Chinnasamy, joined the AIADMK in the presence of Palaniswami.

We are building a barrage at Nanjai Pugazhur at Rs 406 crore. Three-quarters of 1 TMC water will be stored so that farmers can get water for both, irrigation and drinking purposes. The AIADMK government has also carried out Cauvery drinking water project in 50 panchayats in Aravakurichi and Paramathi at Rs 462 crore. He added, Through the Tamil Nadu Slum Clearance Board, as many as 32 flats worth Rs 3 crore are being built in Karur. A betel leaf processing centre worth Rs 2.50 crore is also to be set up at Velayuthampalayam.Steps have been taken to bring surplus water from the LPP canal to cultivate reed grass. Through this, about 10,000 acres of farmlands will be irrigated. There are also plans to build a dam across the Amaravati River in Chinnadharapuram. Necessary steps will be taken to clean and desilt Thathampalayam lake too. Lands in Aravakurichi will be irrigated through a pumping station, and once this project is completed, the arid region will become a prosperous area. Palaniswami also lashed out at DMK chief MK Stalin for fielding Senthil Balaji to fight the elections.Stalin, who calls the AIADMK corrupted, has Senthil Balaji with him, who was fired by former Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa, for corruption in Karur. Stalin calls him the best candidate. Senthil Balaji is someone who gives fake assurances. He had said in the last election that they would give 3 cents of land to everyone in Aravakurichi. But did that happen? We worked hard for him when he was in the AIADMK. But today, he wants to overthrow us. While canvassing votes at Vedasandur later in the day, Palaniswami accused Stalin of insulting farmers.He referred to Stalins fake farmer and rowdy jibes against him and said, Stalin is insulting farmers in his attempt to insult me. Elaborating on various welfare schemes implemented by the AIADMK government in Vedasandur, the Chief Minister said that steps have been taken to carry out projects like establishing a Taluk office in Guziliyamparai and a food park and processing units for tomato and drumstick farmers. Madurai Kamaraj Universitys constituent college in Vedasandur would be converted into a Government Arts and Science College, he promised.Later, in Palani, Palaniswami also made a slew of other promises including the implementation of road and underground drainage projects, establishing cold storage facility for guava farmers, direct procurement centres for coconut and Kodaikanal hill garlic, among others. He also assured that a tourist bus stand would be built in Palani for devotees. Vaiyapuri lake would also be cleaned and a park would be constructed, Palaniswami said. The CM also addressed rallies in Dindigul and Oddanchatram constituencies, and promised to provide 1,000 units of free power supply to power loom weavers.

The 68-year-old veteran faced multiple defeats in the Krishnagiri region over that period, and is set to contest from Veppanahalli in the same area, yet again this time. In 2016 Assembly elections, he came a distant third in Pennagaram. In 2019 Lok Sabha elections, he lost to the Congress candidate A Chellakumar in Krishnagiri. Now, he is locking horns with sitting DMK MLA P Murugan.The last two Assembly elections witnessed a bitter fight for Veppanahalli. On both occasions, DMK emerged victorious. Munusamy, a three-time MLA, is now a Rajya Sabha MP. Murugan, on the other hand, is contesting for the same seat for a second time. Last elections, Murugan won the seat by a margin of over 5,000 votes. Veppanahalli shares borders with both Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. Interestingly, its the only constituency with 100 per cent rural demography.Largely an agrarian society, tomato, mint, coriander, cabbage, and beans are widely cultivated here. People here are also dependant on the daily wages brought back by labourers working in Hosur, Bengaluru, Mallur, KGF, and other nearby industrial areas. Veppanahalli is rich in minerals and has over 150 granite polishing units.But, labourers here are mostly migrant workers. The segment, being a border area, has considerable number of linguistic minorities, who speak Telugu, Urdu, and Kannada. The constituency is dominated by Vanniyars, followed by Naidu, Adi Dravidar, and Gowdas communities.Whats the issue here?For tomato cultivators M Velayutham and L Vijay, their main demand is a cold storage unit. The State government should ensure that the tomatoes can be turned into a value-added product, by giving us equipment to make a sauce, juices, pickles, or other by-products. Government should set up a method where farmers could sell their produce directly to the government agency, they urged.The man-animal conflict was also a major concern for the people in this constituency. A forest official suggested, Because of the National Highway connecting Chennai - Bengaluru passing through the forest area, a few elephants inadvertently wander into the highway where they meet with accidents.To solve this fences must be built for a stretch of one km near Sanamavu. An Eco-Bridge can be constructed to allow the elephants to cross the road. The residents also demand to upgrade the PHCs.Poll promisesAIADMK candidate KP Munusamy assured to carry out all government schemes and ensure implementation of all AIADMK promises in the manifesto such as six gas cylinders per household, three-phase current system for farmers, and loan waiver for Self Help Group.DMK candidate P Murugan promised to set up a Government Polytechnic college in Veppanahalli.

The growing rift comes as the United States and other Western governments increase pressure on China over suspected human rights abuses in the western region.Chinese social media users last week began circulating a 2020 statement by H&M announcing it would no longer source cotton from Xinjiang.H&M said at the time the decision was due to difficulties conducting credible due diligence in the region and after media and human rights' groups reported the use of forced labour in Xinjiang - a charge that Beijing has repeatedly denied.Xu Guixiang, a spokesman for the regional government of Xinjiang, told reporters that a company should not politicise its economic behaviour and said H&M won't be able to make money anymore in the Chinese market because of its statement.Elijan Anayat, another Xinjiang government spokesman, said during the briefing that Chinese people do not want the products of companies such as H&M and Nike that have boycotted Xinjiang's cotton. He invited companies to take trips to the region's cotton fields to see for themselves what is happening.WESTERN SANCTIONSWashington on Friday condemned what it called a ""state-led"" social media campaign in China against US and other international companies for committing not to use cotton from Xinjiang.The wave of consumer boycotts in China has coincided with a coordinated set of sanctions imposed by Britain, Canada, the European Union and the United States last week over what they say are human rights abuses taking place in Xinjiang. The US government has publicly accused Beijing of genocide against the Uighur Muslim ethnic minorities in the region.Xu repeatedly rejected accusations of genocide and human rights abuses in the region and accused the Western powers of engaging in political manipulation to destabilise China with the sanctions.The United States in January announced an import ban on all cotton and tomato products from the area due to allegations of forced labour from detained Uighur Muslims .Western governments and rights groups have previously accused authorities in the far-western region of detaining and torturing Uighurs in camps, where some former inmates have said they were subject to ideological indoctrination.China has repeatedly denied all such charges and say the camps are for vocational training and combating religious extremism.",TOMATO

That explains, to an extent, why Mexican food appeals to me. It is, after all, a glorious mix of fluid and tonal flavours.It is also the cuisine that a talented young chef called Noah Barnes has been focusing on. Id had some delicious Mexican food at his restaurant Arriba some years ago, and still remember the taste of the habanero-smoked pork skewers, flavoured with honey and served with a hot chilli sauce.The chef now runs a new restaurant called Miss Margarita (Ph no 8920331591; M block market, GK 2), which specialises in Mexican food. Chef Barnes, who learnt the nuances of Mexican cooking from the former ambassador of Mexico in India, and a visiting master chef at the embassy, prepares various kinds of tortillas, quesadillas, tacos and more.Mexican food has a spicy edge that appeals to the Indian palate. Some of the flavours  such as cilantro  are used in both cuisines. We love our tomatoes and onions; so do they. A lot of what we eat  think corn on the cob or peanuts  came to our shores from distant Mexico.I love all their open and closed wraps. The tacos that he prepares, with different toppings are superb. His Street-styled grilled chicken and chilli bean taco (475) consisted of grilled chicken strips, a sweet paprika drizzle, refried beans, rocket, and smoked tomato salsa, topped with fresh tomato and onions.The dish I really loved was the diablo prawn (725). With a pressed tomato and coriander drizzle, it had a tamarind and habanero glaze and came with burnt garlic and lime. The prawns were first grilled and then tossed in the sauce. The tart flavours of the tamarind went well with the sharpness of the chillies. The prawn  soft inside and crunchy outside  had soaked in the flavours.The cheesy jalapeno chicken chipotle quesadilla (625) was just that  hot with a sharp taste of cheese, while the charred sweet potato and crispy cauliflower taco (395) was a spinach tortilla, also topped with a hot sauce. The problem with the latter was that I didnt really get the taste of cauliflower or the sweet potato, as it had been overwhelmed by the sauce.The pork carnitas tacos, however, were superb. Soft pork belly had been topped with a potato, pineapple and jalapeno salsa, smoked tomato salsa and refried beans (575). The chicken enchilada, the chef said, was a dish of chargrilled chicken, mixed with peppers and cheese, rolled in tortilla bread and topped with home-made fermented hot sauces, baked with cheese.Churros with chocolate and chilli chocolate sauce at Miss Margarita in Delhi | Photo Credit: Special arrangementChef Barnes takes pride in his Fresh Guacamole Bar, where guacamole is prepared at the table with avocado, tomatoes, jalapeno, onion, coriander and lime, and served with chips. There is a smoked chicken guacamole, too.There is a lot else on the menu: blackened Cajun fish taco (475), gondhoraj flavoured lime shrimp fajita (975) and a chicken casserole consisting of crispy, skinned chicken and spiced pilaf (775).I ended the meal with my favourite churros, eaten with chocolate and chilli chocolate sauce (425). It is a simple dish  fried dough dusted with sugar and cinnamon, but it is the sauce that gives it its singular taste. I dipped the churros in the chilli chocolate sauce and thought that was a blend worth a salsa.The writer is a seasoned food critic",TOMATO

With a farm-based economy, the process-side lags and the lack of affiliated agro-based industries are the main concerns for the cultivators here. A cold storage facility for tomatoes remains to see fruition here.The constituency is also drought prone. Poor rainfall and the resultant drought axed cane production that Palacodde Sugar Cooperative Mill did not take up crushing this year for want of cane.Palacodde has long demanded irrigation schemes linking from Ennekolputhur (Krishnagiri) to Thumballahalli dam; Aliyaalam dam to Tulchetti lake; and Jathalavau channel extension to Pullikarai  to tackle the drought. Ennekolputur project was hastily hatched up in an election year and notification was issued only recently.Minister for Higher Education K.P. Anbalagan has had winning streak, holding the constituency for four straight terms since 2001. If anti-incumbency is a challenge, his run is equally dogged by the drought of Palacodde and the inability to deliver the promised irrigation schemes.The drought is seen as a result of the AIADMK governments failure to implement the irrigation schemes and the Minister is seen as the face of that failure, since the irrigation schemes were part of his poll promise in 2016. Kongu Vellalar community that is second only to the Vanniyars in population in the constituency has been hit hard by the drought as land holders.In addition, there is resentment of under-representation amid Kongu Vellalars for not receiving candidature even in the neighbouring constituency of Paapireddypatti, where they are a sizeable population. The blame for it has been laid on Mr. Anbalagan, who is said to have pushed for Vanniyar candidate in all, but one reserved constituency.The vote bank is led by Vanniyars by over a lakh population (48.30%), followed by Kongu Vellalars (15.50%), Adidravidars (13.80%), Muslims (4.80%), Chettiars (5.20%) and others.The AIADMK has relied on the Vanniyar votes of the AIADMK and the PMK. But, the communitys votes are split with the DMK too. In addition, there is also degree of distrust amid the PMK supporters over the defeat of their leader Anbumani Ramadoss in the Lok Sabha elections, allegedly caused by the lackadaisical participation of the AIADMK.The DMK has fielded P.K. Murugan, an office-bearer in its lawyers wing for the second time after his loss in 2016. A Vellalar Gownder, Mr. Murugan is riding high on sympathy wave that he is well expected to garner the community votes in full. He is also expecting to garner the votes of the Muslims and the Adi Dravidars, with neither community expected to go with the AIADMK. An essentially two-cornered contest, Palacodde is no cakewalk for the high-profile incumbent.",TOMATO

Especially when pitted against, rather unfairly, the universally loved potato. While madhura kizhangu puzhukku and sweet potato fries have persuaded many to switch camps, it doesnt exactly top the list of favourite vegetables for too many.But, maybe it should, given that theres plenty more to this unassuming tuberous root, says Yamini, clinical dietician, Kauvery Hospital. Theres a misconception that roots and tubers are not to be consumed in large quantities because of their starch content. But, when it comes to the nutritional value, the other components like micro-nutrients also have to be kept in mind.For this, sweet potato can be consumed, explains Yamini. There are two types of the sweet potato. The one which is available in India is the orange-pinkish one; the other one is purple and not commonly available here. But, both of them have the same properties and are very good for your health. It is antiinflammatory, reduces free radicals and boosts your immune, she details.Addresses anaemiaIt is very rich in ascorbic acid, fulfilling the vitamin C part. Its also a good source of iron. If cooked with jaggery, the nutritional anaemia can be treated.Potassium powerSweet potato is a rich source of potassium. This can help manage high blood pressure, its water retention properties can regulate muscle contractions and prevent kidney stones too.Starchy but goodEven though it is a starchy vegetable with a minimal amount of carbohydrates, it minimises the absorption of sugar in the body; thanks to its good fibre content both soluble and insoluble. So, even diabeticpatients can consume it once or twice a week if their sugar level is under control.Metabolism mattersThe high fibre content also helps in maintaining gut health. It enhances the growth of beneficial bacteria in your stomach; this way, it can help treat infective diarrhoea, irritable bowel syndrome and other digestive disorders. It helps in weight gain but portion size is the key and it has to be taken appropriately.Brain foodIt is a very good source of choline an essential nutrient that enhances the brain function.Vitamin storehouseSweet potato is also very rich in beta carotene, which is the precursor for vitamin A. This vitaminis very essential in all stages of life, playing a vital role in eye health.Rich in antioxidantsIt is filled with anthocyanins with antioxidant properties. Hence, it has to be included in everyday diet.ConsumptionA 100 grams of baked sweet potato offers 51 grams of carbohydrates, 4 grams of protein, 6 to 7 grams of fibre and very minimal fat. Otherwise, it is also rich in vitamin C and B6, magnesium, etc. The best way to consume sweet potato is to steam/bake it and have it with jaggery or slight seasoning. It can also be made as a regular south Indian curry or poriyal, with tomato and onions and spices.Sweet potato is not given much importance on the plate. But, you should try to include it regularly in your diet. In layman terms, it just looks like the pancreas the shape of the tuber. And Mother Nature has given it all these properties too. That depicts that it is very good for your vital organ, pancreas, she concludes.",TOMATO

For a growing number of Indians; it is not so much about swigging a few beers or throwing back a few shots, but more about enjoying the change of scenery and revelling in a non-alcoholic drink.Unfortunately, the virgin tag in the drinks space has so far come with a green light for compromise. Most virgin mojitos just have dollops of sugar syrup, while some virgin cucumber gimlets comprise lime juice with chunks of cucumber at best.Thankfully, consumers are now empowered more than ever to ask for a premiumisation of mocktails: that is to say, ones without sugar rush-inducing ingredients and stacks of ice. In response, bartenders rise to this challenge and admit that non-alcoholic beverages have shot into prominence.Sidecar founder and mixologist Yangdup Lama | Photo Credit: special arrangementThough Yangdup Lama first opened his famous Delhi bar Sidecar in August 2018, they did not have a liquor license until December of that year. So the place kicked off with a mocktail menu, which seemed risky. However, looking back at those first few months, he says innovating on mocktails was liberating rather than restricting, and he and his team of trusted bartenders loved the process so much that they retained that mocktails menu to this day.Read More | All about Sidecar, the only Indian bar in 2020 Asias Best 50 list, and its creatorWe get people coming in during the day for those mocktails, he explains. One of our popular ones is made of bel or wood apple  such a fantastic fruit in so much abundance  and we opened up that conversation around the bels versatility. This is mind, the demand for mocktails is also based on the typical growth mindset in that people always want something more. Other much-loved mocktails at Sidecar include a velvet spice (a concoction of black grapes, redberry puree and lime, with a dash of chilli) and walk on the street (grapefruit, turmeric shrub with orange and mint soda).A long-time inequality, resolvedFlair bartender Ami Shroff crafting a drink using chillies | Photo Credit: Ami Shroff / InstagramMumbai-based flair bartender and TEDx speaker Ami Shroff points out that for people who drink alcohol, there are many choices in terms of the base, a whiskey, a cognac or even a beer  and then for each base, there are countless possibilities. However, in the mocktail space, options are limited to mainly juices and aerated waters. This inequality has been long predominant at bars and restaurants across the country, and she is glad it is changing. Cocktails obviously have a bigger price bracket and get more attention, so that explains the heavier focus on them at some places, she states.Interestingly, Ami points out that many of Indias bartenders receive training from liquor brand ambassadors, so their repertoire primarily comes with boozy elements. There is not much focus on how flavours would work without alcohol. The same goes for a lot of bartending schools. Automatically, the bartenders are just attuned to fixing cocktails, she reflects. The good thing is, as the experience across customers is evolving, so will that of the bartenders.Ami predicts that bars will have more training sessions, specifically around flavour combinations in the non-alcoholic space. When a drink does not have such a component, the profile changes significantly. So bartenders will have to look into the good and bad of flavour compensation a lot more. As an example, she says Bloody Mary can easily be made non-alcoholic by enhancing the tomato flavours without offering the customer too much acidity.The growing mocktail mania has seen Yangdup working with different companies such as Jimmys Cocktails, making ready-to-make mixes in a mocktail format. In the next few months, people can look forward to more such companies releasing these non-alcoholic packages, he puts forth. These companies would also be making sure that one can add alcohol if they like to the same mix, to help people be more experimental at home which has been much of the new normal, post-pandemic.Going mainstream Big conglomerates have launched mocktail lines too. In 2019, Coca Cola foresaw the trend and launched their Bar None range, featuring sangria, bellini spritz, dry aged cider and ginger mule flavoured mocktails.More recently, in February, Pepsi launched Neon Zebra canned mocktails in margarita, strawberry daiquiri, mojito and whiskey sour variants.These companies, including &Stirred, Tea Trunk and Mixtale, appeal not just to big metro cities, but also to smaller towns where there are few opportunities to try a good mocktail or a cocktail.Of flavour and soulA juggler and flair bartender, Ami is no stranger to the theatre of the bar, but insists that the success of a drink comes down to its flavour and soul.Will this shift in consciousness affect how a restaurant or bars supply chain operates? Ideally, it should not. There is a misconception that making a mocktail is a no-brainer. But clearly, that is not the case, considering how so many mocktails have been a let-down for such a long time. Both Ami and Yangdup say the same knowledge of techniques, flavour combinations and presentation to make a cocktail should be used to craft a mocktail.Owing to premiumisation, Indias drinking crowd is more ingredient-conscious now; going far beyond ordering a drink just by the name but understanding and often predicting how a combination of elements would taste together in a single sip. People are asking bartenders when a juice within a drink was made, if it is freshly-squeezed or packaged. The communication between the customer and bartender has changed, specifies Yangdup.It is one thing to hear how mocktails are successful for bartenders reaching a new demographic, but we want to know what mocktails they actually drink. Yangdup favours any drink combination of kaffir limes, and mangoes makes him happy. Meanwhile, Ami chuckles and says she loves a good virgin Bloody Mary.",TOMATO

Consequently, the retail prices have also fallen to Rs 9-10 per kg.ON Shibudeen, a vegetable agent in Thennampalayam market in Tiruppur, attributed the price drop to a bountiful harvest. However, this has hurt farmers and traders as the excess supply of native variety has led to a slump in prices. ""We now get around 7 tonnes of tomatoes daily, compared to 4-5 tonnes earlier.

They had got some soft, sesame seed topped buns, and ordered pork patties from Meatigo.I began dreaming about this: creamy mayo slathered over a piece of bun, onion rings, perhaps a slice of tomato over it. A juicy patty on that, a crisp lettuce leaf and another soft bun on top. The problem was that we didnt have any buns, and it was too late to have them delivered.But burgers had been promised to two young people at home  one visiting Delhi for the first time. So, I turned to my good friend, the internet, and chanced upon a place called Boss Burger. I liked the different kinds of burgers it offered, and was further encouraged by the fact that it has branches across the city. With the help of Swiggy, we placed our order.The youngsters like chicken, so for them we asked for two OG Chicken Burgers (518 for two). They are also fond of hot food, so we added a Crispy Peri Peri Chicken Burger (299). A Crispy Fish Fillet Burger (349) and what seemed rather interesting  a Mutton Ghee Roast Burger (369).The burgers arrived just when the mice in the stomach had started kicking up a real shindy. The boxes were encouraging  strong, well packed cartons, which contained the burger, as well as sauces and napkins. Without much ado, we got down to business.The young ones were happy with their burgers  brioche wrapped around melted cheese and chicken topped with a hot sauce. The hot peri peri chicken was even better. The chicken and cheese patty had been doused with garlic aioli and a spicy sauce. The fish fillet burger, which came with tartar sauce, was disappointing. The patty was crisp from the outside, but sadly soggy within.My mutton ghee roast burger, however, was delicious, with its fusion flavours. The patty had been prepared in the Mangalorean style  slow cooked and then garnished with curry leaf flavoured mayo. It had a taste of soft onions that I really liked, and, overall, the patty cooked with Indian spices went rather well with the soft, bland buns.My last happy burger meal was when I had ordered in from Akus, which has some outstanding burgers with blue cheese, wild mushrooms, jalapenos, caramelized onions and more.Boss Burgers menu is comprehensive, too. For vegetarians, it offers Aloo Rataloo (sweet potato patty with mozzarella cheese, garlic aioli and chutney), Spicy BBQ Paneer, Quinoa & Veggie (quinoa-crusted roasted root vegetable patty, topped with sriracha mayo and saunth chutney) and Holy Guacamole! Black Bean Burger.Meat lovers can have its Truffled 3 Cheese Tenderloin Burger (grilled tenderloin and cheese patty, topped with truffled aioli and pickles, served in a sesame brioche bun) and a Chicken Tikka Burger. There are fries, chicken nuggets, wings and various kinds of shakes on the menu.All in all, we had a nice meal, indeed. But now I need to order in some buns and patties. Nothing like a DIY burger.The writer is a seasoned food critic",TOMATO

Prakash Kammaradi.It is the first time in the history of the country that fertilizer prices have seen a hike of nearly 58%, accounting for an increase of 1,400 a quintal.Dr. Kammaradi, who had commissioned studies related to cost of production for various crops in Karnataka in his capacity as KAPC chairman, said increase in fertilizers cost would almost neutralise the cushion being provided by minimum support prices with respect to a few crops, including paddy.Citing an example, he said the paid out costs, which include not just cost of production but also rental value of land and family labour, is already much higher than the revenues earned by farmers with respect to several crops, including paddy.According to him, the cost of production of paddy on one acre is 37,578 of which the fertilizers alone cost 7,314 as there is a requirement of about 400 kg. Of this, the DAP and NPK, which have seen hike in prices, account for 50% of quantity. This would mean there would be a jump of about 2,800 to 3,000 per acre of paddy. Pointing out that farmers get 27 to 28 quintals of paddy per acre on an average, he says, production cost would go up by a minimum of 100 per quintal of paddy.With actual paid out cost of paddy already high at 52,453 per acre, the present fertilizer price hike would only increase the financial burden and make cultivation of various crops almost financially unviable despite MSPs, he argued.Similarly, the growers of elakki variety of banana spend about 16,429 per acre of plantation on fertilizers alone. Now, these expenses would increase, he pointed out. Same was the case of cotton where 333 kg of fertilisers is used per one acre. Even vegetable and fruits growers have been hit hard. According to an estimate, 290 kg of fertilizers is required for growing tomato on one acre of land while 505 kg of fertilizers is needed for growing dry chillies on one acre.Even dairy farmers, who are struggling since milk procurement prices were reduced on account of COVID-19, are expected to be hit hard as a majority are dependent on fertilizers for cultivation of fodder. Dr. Kammaradi argued for restoring full quantum of subsidy that was being given for fertilisers to bail them out.",TOMATO

For instance, Roojam said, against a normal purchase of 15 kg of flour in foreign countries, people would start storing 50 kg flour, and similarly other products.This created a lot of demand, especially when the eateries were closed during the lockdown and people started buying ready to eat products in large quantity, Roojam said, adding that there were initial hiccups when the transportation took a hit due to lockdown last year, but once the restrictions were eased, the export of Markfed products registered a sharp increase.There was a lot of demand from countries like US, UK and Australia, said Roojam.The jump in exports.

For example, he said, Markfed was procuring sarson for ready to eat saag through contract farming on more than 350 acres near its plant in Jalandhar.Roojam said among other products, there was a huge demand for honey from foreign countries and beginning this fiscal Markfed would start the honey export.

In the absence of adequate transport facility and marketing opportunities, vegetables are taken to the 11 mandis and auctioned from where traders transport to wholesale markets in Erode, Coimbatore and Kerala. Hence, farmers are not getting the right price for their produce and were long demanding for effective steps to improve their livelihood.Tomato is a major crop cultivated in the hilltop during November-December and harvesting is done in March-April.

In the absence of a cold storage facility, farmers were forced to sell their produce at the price fixed by the traders, he added.Since tomatoes are available in large quantities, it can be processed into pulp, puree or paste so that it is purchased by tomato product manufacturing companies.If processing units cannot be started for lack of investments, mobile processing units can be deployed in the hill areas and the product can be marketed, said Duraisamy of Gettavadi.Farmers said that processing and value addition to their produce would fetch better and stable income and improve their livelihood.It is a perennial problem that remains unattended for many decades, he added and wanted the new State government to fulfil their long demand.Farmers said that when the production drops after May, the price of tomatoes would go up significantly. But even then, we will not get a good price as traders fix the price, he said and added that tomatoes also come from Chamrajanagar to the mandis.Farmers also suggest that a regulated market could be established at Talavadi where they can sell their produce at a reasonable price.

Another reason for dry skin is diabetic neuropathy i.e. damage to the never endings, especially of legs and feet. Dry skin tends to become itchy and when we itch, it leads to cracks, providing an easy opening for infectious elements to enter the skin leading to inflammations, redness, and irritation on the skin.*People with diabetes are more prone to fungal infections. Red, itchy rash accompanied with blisters and scales appears on the folds and warm areas of the body such as in between toes, in the fold of elbows or the armpits, corners of mouth etc. The common fungal infections in diabetic people are candida albicans, ringworm, athletes foot, jock itch, and recurring vaginal yeast infection.*People with diabetes suffer from more bacterial infections than people without the condition. Boils, folliculitis, styes on eyelids, carbuncles, and infections around the nails are common in diabetics.*Necrobiosis Lipoidica are small solid bumps that appear on the skin. They look similar to pimples but if ignored they turn into patches of swollen and hard skin with a yellow or reddish-brown colour. Other indications are shiny skin surrounding the bumps, painful itchy skin, and visible blood vessels.*Acanthosis nigricans is a pre-diabetes condition in which the skin of the armpits, groin, or neck turns very dark, thick, and velvety.

I tried speaking to testing labs but nobody was ready to visit my home for a test. After trying for 2 days I got my test done on 25th April and as I had feared, I was COVID positive as well. It was really shocking as we didnt expect this to happen to us. My mom got her vaccination done and right after that she tested positive. We are still in a thought, if she got the virus from the vaccination centre. I had no symptoms when my mom got positive so I maintained distance from her completely but, somehow I got the virus too. I follow social media very actively and almost everyone was posting things related to COVID and every minute, my mobiles notification was related to it only by which I started getting depressed and I started overthinking on everything which actually took me to the stage of mental breakdown and I had no one to share these feelings with as I had to take care of my family as well.I developed severe chest pain and headache, which I thought was not related to COVID and I took it very lightly. It continued till 2-3 days and I still ignored it. Surprisingly, I got a fever the next morning and lost the sense of smell and taste. My headache was so dangerous that I had tears in my eyes all the while and turned me into an insomniac. The throat pain felt as if someone was holding my neck hard and not letting me breathe. I had a scratchy throat, and a fever, with this sweeping kind of fatigue. The new mutation of the second wave is more dangerous and deadly. Also, I lost almost 5-6 kgs in a week, so weight loss is also a symptom that I witnessed. I immediately consulted my doctor who advised certain medications, given to all COVID patients. I had a lot of pain in my chest due to cough so I took steam thrice a day which gave me some relief. I have done meditation almost daily to stay positive, mental health is really important for us. I believe 40 % of the people are losing their minds by watching negativity going around in the world and I am one of them.I didnt realise how the quarantine period passed as in this state, I was cooking food for my family and other household work as we had sent back our servants so that they can stay safe. I used to wake up around 8 a.m in the morning and till 10pm at night I had to take care of myself and my family single handedly. Somehow I managed to do meditation daily just to calm myself and ignore the negative thoughts running in my head all the time. I used to watch a lot of videos related to COVID before sleeping on how to get the sense of smell and taste back. I truly believe that God has been with me in this and gave me a lot of will power to fight against COVID alone and also take care of my family...Dietary precautionsI consulted a nutritionist so that I can take a balanced diet. Early in the morning I used to take lukewarm lemon water with 1/4 tablespoon of giloy stave from Baidyanath with 5 almonds and 2 dates and one tablespoon chyawanprash. In breakfast I used to eat besan halwa and after an hour 2-3 kiwis. In lunch I used to eat khichdi/ biryani, either of them and after an hour one cup of green tea with 2 pieces of dates. In the evening, tomato soup and papaya were the best combination for energy. Then for dinner, I just had haldi milk. This diet can help everyone to stay fit while they recover from COVID.While I am on my road to recovery, I want to tell all COVID+ patients to not give up on hope. Yes, the situation is bad, but nothing can be stronger than your willpower. That's the biggest weapon in hand to fight coronavirus. Talking to yourself, positive thoughts will help you recover. Don't let the negative thoughts rent space in your head. As I would say, start masking your ears too and protect yourself from all kinds of negative energies.",TOMATO

This season is also known for its bountiful supply of tropical fruits. When we talk about fruits during summer, we think of mango, pineapple, watermelon or litchi. These fruits, when carefully paired with compatible spirits, make for a great refreshing and cooling drink on a warm summer day. Summer cocktails usually bring to mind the picture of a serene sea, salt air and swaying coconut trees.When it comes to popular drinks during these times, the pina colada is the most common. This drink expresses the beautiful flavours of pineapple and coconuts paired with rum.Another option is an iced drink like a frozen daiquiri, paired with summer fruits like mangoes, watermelon, strawberries or even passion fruit. Theres also a nice pitcher of sangria, which can be consumed with a choice of fruit chunks in them to nibble on at the end of a glass.Some of us love summer just because its the season for mangoes, the king of fruits. Adding some chunks of mangoes in your drink or pairing it with certain herbs to elevate the freshness of the drink is also a refreshing option. Some fruits also have added benefits in the guise of healthy minerals and vitamins.Watermelon, for instance, is a great source of vitamin A and C, and one can pair it with rum, vodka or gin to make an invigorating cocktail that could prevent skin damage due to the summer sun, which could really ruin a holiday! Another beautiful summer fruit to use in cocktails is the humble guava.This is my favourite. Replacing guava juice for tomato juice in a traditional Bloody Mary gives it that unusual tang and is my perfect trick to beat the summer heat. Cheers!

Aside from all the tweaks thatll go on over the vaulting table, Pranatis palate will now be conditioned to trade the machher jhol (fish curry) for the sashimi twice a week.Our athletes always run into this problem: they struggle for food abroad and then mentally they keep thinking theyve not eaten properly and are not prepared for competition. Pranati will need to get used to having Japanese meals, so 2 or 3 days in a week, well start her off on the food she might end up eating in Tokyo, coach Lakhan Sharma says, of Indias latest and only qualifier in gymnastics at the Olympics, picked for the four apparatus of All Around competition.Thats an astonishing amount of detailing worked out quickly, considering what has been a surprise qualification for the Tokyo Games.With a bunch of tournaments cancelled  including the Asian meet at Hangzhou, China for this week  qualification came down to Pranatis results at the last World Championship.READ | Pranati Nayak follows in Dipa Karmakars footstepsSneaking in as the second reserve from Asia, the 26-year-old from Midnapore in West Bengal who won bronze in the vault at the Asian Championships in March 2019, has a coach who makes it a point to keep himself updated with international trends.Theres just two months left so well only polish the old routines on Floor exercise, Balance beam and Uneven Bars. But shell go there with all the upgrades, says the geeky mentor, hailing from Ujjain, posted at Kolkata as coach.An order was placed for a tome on techniques, titled Championship Gymnastics penned by Gerald George and illustrated by James Stephenson, costing Rs 30,000 as soon as it became clear to Sharma that Pranati had a chance to get to Tokyo.Natural flairShes a strong gymnast whos very hardworking. But shes also a natural, shell go further than people expect her to, Sharma says with a coachs conviction, hoping to use the definitive text to polish a couple of her elements at the Olympics.To that effect, hes weaning her away from her mobile phone  only Saturday/Sunday, shell be allowed  he says.While a physio, masseur and nutritionist will assemble to fine-tune Pranatis preparation as the SAI arena opens its facility only for her, the chef is choosing his best knives for the usu-zukuri, the fine cuts.Kolkatas SAI facility had proven a charm for Pranati nearly 20 years ago, though the earliest Samaritan in her career wasnt the chef, googling how to make Sushi in SAIs cavernous kitchens.Dileep uncle still narrates the story with my father filling in the details, Pranati starts. They rejected me saying I was too thin and said Ill trip on the apparatus. So they told my father to take me back, saying iska nahi hoga (she cant be admitted), she laughs.Pranati Nayak with her father Sumanta Nayak Pranati Nayak with her father Sumanta NayakSumanta Nayak had wept when the coach at Kolkatas training centre told him that his 8-year-old gymnast daughter would not make it in the sport and had no place in the hostel. They said, wo gir jaaegi (she will fall). They had not seen her jump and spin and cartwheel around the house. My girl was strong and always landed on her feet. Usme bahut hunar tha. (She was very talented.) When they said that she wouldnt be taken into the hostel, I couldnt control my tears, he recalls.Thats when Dileep, a helper assigned to clean the apparatus and fetch tea, had seen the bawling father break down on the road, and guided him to Ms Sushmita, the leading official at the centre. Sushmita would put in a word with the nurturing coach, Minara Begum, who would take on Pranatis responsibility completely.She never complained, but while her parents would travel 100km to bring her to training while she waited for a hostel, I knew that she was also doing a lot of housework where she stayed. I decided to take charge of her career, the now-retired coach recalls.Besides the leotards with frills that she fixed for Pranati and taking care of her education and meals (since she was extremely thin, though not frail), Minara would also equip her with skills, sponged up by the eager learner.From the springboard, theres a forward salto on the beam. I taught her that very early on  because she was sincere and would learn meticulously, the coach recalls of the tiniest of headstarts for her ward. Others in India are doing it only now.Its on the vault though that Pranati will look to carry forward the baton from Rio 4th-placer Dipa Karmakar. It was Indias second World Cup medallist, Aruna B Reddy, also a vaulter, in fact who alerted Pranati to the chance of making it to Tokyo last week. Pranatis Handspring forward 540 (difficulty 5.8) and Tsukahara back 720 (D: 5.6) have been her reliable routines that she hopes to land perfectly  banking on the staple if not the spectacular  a la Karmakar. On the Floor, Pranati  a hobby dancer  has a trippy sequence where her acrobatic lines blend into some bop to the Dom and Tak beats of Maashallah from the hit film Ek Tha Tiger.Its on the beam and vault though that Pranati truly finds her rhythm.Sumanta Nayak and wife Pratima knew their second daughter had a future in gymnastics when she repurposed all surfaces in their house to spin and whirl right since they dropped her off at a gymnastics club, one amongst hundreds that dot Bengal  even the rural non-descript towns.READ | Pranati Nayak vaults to a bronze at Asian meet: For my father, a bus driverOlder sister Jayati and younger Tapti got busy with books, but Pranati couldnt stop cartwheeling around. Her father, who moved from Jharkhand to Bengal and drove a bus to make ends meet, was supremely confident that his second daughter had what it took.Ill be honest. After three daughters, I felt a little bad about not having a son. But Pranati showed so much talent that I knew she is going to go further than any male child I mightve had. I was convinced she was special. Thats why it was important that the Kolkata centre accepted her. She needed a good diet I could see, but only a sports hostel couldve provided for her. Part reason I cried (when she was turned down) was I couldnt do much for her if she didnt get into the training centre, the father remembers.Prodigious talentCoach Minara Begum was impressed with the bridges and forward and back somersaults of the 9-year-old. She would shepherd her career with her own diligence from 2003, and while India was just acquainting itself with Dipas scary vault, Minara would keep Pranati on the conventional path  nothing eye-popping, just gymnastics basics, executed to the best of her ability.Pranati Nayak with former coach Minara Begum Pranati Nayak with former coach Minara BegumPranati wouldnt forget about the family that had revolved its routine around ferrying her to and fro from practice  at times 4-hour rickety bus rides to Kolkata. So the Rs 12 lakh she earned from the Nationals two years ago saw her build a slightly bigger house in Midnapore and take entire responsibility for her older sisters wedding couple of years ago.Her first medal had come at Childrens Asiad in Russia, while she would make the All Around finals (4th on Beam & 5th on vault) of the 2014 Asian Games alongside Dipa.Pranati Nayak bronze medal winning Vault from 8th Senior Artistic Gymnastics Asian Championship, Ulaanbaatar Mongolia.

I was disappointed at the World meet, so I spent all of the lockdown keeping in shape and not going out of training for a single day, she says.It meant her father would fix a bamboo horizontally across two trees  for her to do the simple swings that were part of her weakest apparatus  the uneven bars. Olympics wasnt on my training plan then  this was unexpected. I wanted to do well at the CWG in Birmingham, Pranati says. Somewhere, I think, that hard work paid off. Even now with everything closed, Lakhan sir ensures I get training, Pranati says.Sharma had been lining up practice at different clubs  in Bally, Patuli and Dum Dum, with Pranati travelling for up to an hour and 40 minutes to clock one session of practice wherever possible.Pranati Nayak with with coach Lakhan Sharma Pranati Nayak with with coach Lakhan SharmaLakhan Sharma would message his trainees  and the club owners would open up their facilities for the international gymnast, twice a week, to enable her to practise when SAI was closed. You have to understand what gymnastics means to Bengal. Even the smallest towns have gymnastics clubs with basic infrastructure, nothing fancy. Its in the culture, even rurally, thats why its not a surprise Pranatis father saw a future for her in this sport. A lot of girls from Bengal as well as the Northeast are suited for this sport. They arent very tall, so lower centre of gravity, he says. But moreover, people here are extremely creative and artistic. Its great to work with gymnasts who understand the art in this sport, he says.Sharma says little girls training hard at clubs dotting Bengals remote geography were bound to throw up a winner, though the pandemic serendipitously picked Pranati.Fine angles define perfection in gymnastics.

Desperate pleas for oxygen, medicines and vaccination slots have become dominant everyday conversations. Amid this raging chaos, while the role of healthcare industry intensifies, it is the non-profit sector that has as always stepped up, providing relief material and ration for scores of families affected by COVID- 19.And one such NGO doing their part is Aranya Foundation that recently started a free service to deliver fresh meals at the doorstep of COVID-19 patients. When health is compromised, even the simpler things in life a good meal, for example is a stressful task, be it for a homemaker and their family or someone living alone. Shilpam Kapur Rathore, founder of Aranya Foundation, witnessed this firsthand when the virus kept her friend confined to the bed. She had to quarantine in a room in her house. Thats when I realised that many are affected by the lack of a homemakers presence in the kitchen.They end up ordering in food, which may not necessarily aid in recovery and healing. It is a fifteen- day struggle. Since the foundation has experience in providing nutritious, healthy, simple meals, we thought well start this for COVID-19 patients free of cost, shares Shilpam. With this intent, through her Foundation, Shilpam is providing 2,000 meals a day to the patients and their families in Kilpauk, Anna Nagar, Nungambakkam, Mylapore and Adyar.Patients can contact their helpline handled by four professionals one day in advance and place the order. Simple, healthy food like sambar and rice, variety rice with pickle, or tomato rice prepared by 18 people at the Radha Soami Satsang Beas, is packed in a disposable container and delivered to customers via Delhivery. The raw materials for the meals are funded by the donations received by the Foundation. On May 11, their first day of the initiative, the Foundation received requests for 1,500 meals.Besides following the hygiene protocols, offering fresh food is a non-negotiable for Shilpam. All the kitchen workers are equipped with hairnets, masks, and gloves, and have taken the RT-PCR test. This is the Foundations second initiative during the pandemic. Last year, at the time of the lockdown, they aided citybased class 11 student, Arnav Rathore, in providing a weeks worth of dry ration to the homes of 800 senior citizens free of cost. They also distributed over 20,000 meals to migrant workers in Chennai with the help of Radha Soami Satsang Beas.Their work has no borders. With Delhi gasping for breath owing to the dearth of oxygen cylinders, the Foundation organised a bus with 10 oxygen concentrators for the North Delhi Municipal Corporation. I feel all of us have the power to make a change. When I started out on my mission of Annandhanam in 2015, I just made one meal for one woman on the streets. Then she said there are so many like her. I made 20 and then realised there are 100. Its a moment that sparks a movement, says Shilpam. Amen to that!To order, call 42997501. RTPCR results must be provided.

This Saturday, about 5,000 tonnes of vegetables arrived at the market, but 50% remained sold.S Chandran, secretary of Federation of Wholesale Vegetable Market Associations, said that about 20% of unsold vegetables including brinjal (eggplant), ladies finger (okra) and tomato may go waste. Last Saturday (May 8), nearly 99% of the vegetables that arrived were sold out, while it was 80% during the previous Saturday. But, the sudden announcement over slashing the working hours for retail stores led to traders decreasing their purchase on Saturday, he said. At the market Koyambedu, beetroot was available for Rs 8 per kg, cabbage cost Rs 4 a kg, while carrot was sold for Rs 15 a kg. The retail traders, who account for a majority of the buyers at the market, did not buy excess vegetables fearing that they might not be able to sell them due to the reduction in timings, he added.Besides, the number of small vehicles used by retail traders to buy vegetables fell by 1,000 from an average of 4,000. S S Muthukumar, president of the Koyambedu Semi Wholesale Vegetable Traders Association, said the number of retail traders has also reduced.There were 15,000 people at the market on Saturday against the average of one lakh in pre-Covid times, he said.The market management committee, which maintains the Koyambedu market complex, has banned the entry of auto rickshaws and cars to the facility to keep the general public away.According to a press release on Saturday, the KWMC will function only till 10am as per the directions of the state government.

(Representational image)The lack of predictability in the functioning of wholesale vegetable markets in the country, on account of variabilities in the lockdowns in different states and the closing of retail outlets, hotels, hostels and marriage halls, has resulted in large quantities of tomatoes going unsold in the Kolar APMC market, which is the second largest tomato market in Asia.Crates of tomatoes were dumped by the roadside in the Kolar region this week after they went unsold in the APMC market which supplies tomatoes at this time of the year to markets all over India. A video of the dumping of tomatoes was circulated on social media.We checked on the dumping of tomatoes on the sides of the road and found that they were tomatoes that had remained unsold at the APMC market on account their quality, Kolar district Deputy Commissioner Dr R Selvamani said.We asked our officials to find out and we learnt that out of the 1,200 tonnes of tomato which arrived at the Kolar APMC on Wednesday, as much as 70 tonnes were unsold because they were considered to be of low quality, the Kolar DC added.The APMC tomato market in Kolar is the main supplier of tomatoes to states like West Bengal, UP, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and also for exports to countries such as Bangladesh, Pakistan, Afghanistan and China.Also Read | Chamarajanagar oxygen tragedy: Karnataka govt announces Rs 2 lakh compensation for victims familiesDuring the current season when farmers have cultivated large tracts of land with tomato in anticipation of good prices, the uncertainties in markets around the country created by the lockdowns has resulted in miscalculations in the timing of the harvesting of crops and a glut in the market, resulting in tomatoes losing quality and saleability, APMC traders said.Tomato is cultivated in as much as 10,000 acres of land in the Kolar district and tomato produce from as many as five districts in south Karnataka is received at the Kolar APMC tomato market. In recent days, during the ongoing lockdown to prevent the spread of Covid-19, the quantity of tomatoes arriving at the market has been between 1,200 to 1,700 tonnes.On the day when the videos of dumping of tomatoes on the side of the road emerged this week, as much as 1,600 tonnes of tomato had been received at the market. On Saturday, over 3,500 tonnes of tomato arrived at three APMC markets in the Kolar district, according to data for the crop provided by the online data system of the APMCs.The tomato produce has been nearly four times more than previous seasons because farmers were expecting good prices and sales. The disruption of the market by the lockdown has meant that some of the produce goes unsold for a few days and then their quality deteriorates and they end up commanding no prices at all, said C R Srinath, a tomato trader at the Kolar APMC market for tomatoes. Good tomatoes were going at about Rs 200 for a 15 kg box but fourth and fifth quality tomatoes fetch only a few rupees for a 15 kg box, he said.The key to getting good prices is in the timing of the harvest. The crops need to be harvested two days before they are taken to markets in states like West Bengal and UP. What is happening now due to the lockdowns is that farmers are not getting clear information on the days when markets in other states will be open. This has resulted in produce coming to the market long before they can be transported and losing quality, Srinath added.Another reason for the wastage of tomato crops this season is the fact that retail sales is restricted due to the lockdown and the hotels, hostels and marriage halls are all shut. There is excess crop and less demand, the trader said.Incidences of wastage of the tomato crop are frequently reported from the Kolar APMC due to the vagaries of the market. The lockdown in 2020 also created similar problems.",TOMATO

Growers, who normally sell their market ready vegetable at around Rs 10-15 per kg are now forced to sell it at an average price of Rs 2-4 per kg.Ajit Korade, a sugarcane and vegetable grower from the village of Nirewadi in Phaltan taluka of Satara district had taken the crop over three of his total 70 acres of holding. The average price he received from Vashis wholesale market in Navi Mumbai was just Rs 4 per kg. This is a complete wash out for us as the cost of production of top quality crop is Rs 10 per kg, he said. To top this, Korade had to throw away 40 tonnes of the vegetable, the first pick from his crop early in April, as an unknown virus had led to fruit damage. The per acre yield of summer tomato is around 20-35 tonnes.Vegetable growers in Maharashtra normally take two crops of tomato from farmers of Niphad taluka in Nashk, growing mainly the kharif crop. Farmers, from Pune and Satara, take the crop during the summer season on assured irrigation. The summer crop fetches a better premium than the kharif crop but the cost of production of the summer crop is higher.The harvest season of the summer crop this time has coincided with covid-19 related lockdowns, thereby crashing crop prices across markets.Farmers like Korade, who deal directly with the Vashis wholesale market said they at least had market access while others were forced to give up their plot for good. Traders in Vashi market cited the closure of retail markets and prices dropped drastically, he said. Superior quality produces which other wise would have commanded Rs 15 per kg is now being sold at Rs 4 per kg.This price slide, Korade said, came at a time when farmers in Pune and Satara had increased their tomato acreage in anticipation of good prices in the summer season.Last year, farmers had suffered from the attack of a virus on the crop as well as lack of market while this year the markets have collapsed. Korade also highlighted out how retail prices in urban centres like Pune and Mumbai have not seen much reduction even though wholesale prices have collapsed.Farmers like Korade said alternate market chains like direct to customers is not feasible for them. On an average our daily yield is around 3 tonnes so there is no question for us to sell it directly to consumers, he said. This low prices, Korade said would led him to default on his bank loans and he would be forced to turn to private money lenders to raise finances this kharif. Stay updated with the latest Pune news.

A chilled watermelon feta salad with mint garnish for lunch on a hot summer day or a Subway chicken teriyaki salad bowl is all you need for a hearty meal.Salads are refreshing, easy to make and nutritious. In summers, nutrient-rich yet tasty food is a good way to keep your health in check, especially when a lot of people are working from home. Quinoa, for example, is a rich source of protein, essential minerals, and amino-acids which regulate your body function. Include citrus fruits, cheese and nuts in your salads as they help in immunity building, says Md. Shahid Hossain, executive chef at the Taj Krishna.Whether you are working from home or attending an online class, try to switch to a salad for lunch. These are very light and prevent you from dozing off in your chair. Summer salads, paired with a good workout plan, will help you shed those pandemic pounds easily. Otherwise, include a salad as a side dish to your meal or snack time and you will be able to inculcate the necessary veggies and hearty greens into your diet effortlessly.Mansi Patel, a nutritionist based in Hyderabad, says, Salads are a good source of fibre, which helps relieve constipation. Salad bowls usually contain a rich source of protein, a healthy amount of fat and veggies that contain vitamins and minerals. For people who are watching their weight during the lockdown or those who want to improve their strength, salads are the easiest and most beneficial.Everyone loves a salad at a restaurant but a lot of us will not touch lettuce unless it is in a delicious burger. The creamy and savoury dressings make all the difference to a salad bowl. Be it any sauce -- a tangy BBQ or a refreshing mint mayonnaise or a basic mixture of mustard, honey, and vinegar -- salad dressings add flavour and zing to your greens. Some of the sauces that are available on e-commerce platforms are mint mayonnaise, BBQ, chipotle southwest dressing, sriracha sauce and honey mustard, among others.Instead of boring yourself with a standard salad dressing, which will eventually make you give in to cravings, mix and match various dressings and sauces.

As a result, while transport costs skyrocketed, prices crashed so severely that he decided not to harvest the crop at all.The price offered was not even the quarter of what he would need to meet the costs. If I sell at these rates, I will incur heavy losses considering what it costs to harvest and transport. So I am feeding the ladies finger to my cattle. As for the onions, I have asked the labourers to harvest and take home as much as they want for free, Mr. Rama told The Hindu.Produce dumpedThis is the story of many farmers across Karnataka. A video clip of a watermelon grower in Sagar, Shivamogga, destroying his crop in frustration was widely shared. There was another of a jasmine grower dumping his harvest on the streets in the district, cursing the administration for the lockdown. Many tomato growers in Kolar and Chickballapur recently protested by throwing their produce on the street.A kilo of tomato was selling at less than 2, which wouldnt have even recovered my transport cost, leave alone my investment. So I abandoned the crop at the market and returned, said Adi Reddy, a tomato farmer from Kolar.The fall in demand for vegetables, fruits and flowers, the disruption of transport networks, and high transport costs following the Statewide lockdown imposed for the past three weeks have hit these farmers hard.Despite the lockdown guidelines clearly allowing free movement of all cargo, transport networks have been disrupted, especially inter-district and inter-State ones.For two weeks, vegetables were not being sent out of the State. This has now been resolved. The price of tomatoes improved to 7 to 9 a kg only after the supply to other States, including West Bengal and Bangladesh, resumed, said G. Srinivasan, a farmer from Nandi and a member of HOPCOMS. He also said transport operators were charging several times more than usual, citing the lockdown, police harassment, and skyrocketing diesel prices. Diesel prices have touched an unprecedented 90 a litre. This has also added to the farmers woes, he said.Inadequate reliefThe State government sop of 10,000 a hectare (4,000 an acre) for vegetable, fruit and flower growers has been dubbed woefully inadequate by farmers and farmers unions.

(Representational image/Reuters)The US government blocked imports of seafood Friday from the entire fleet of a Chinese company that authorities say forced crew members to work in slave-like conditions that led to the deaths of several Indonesian fishermen last year.Customs and Border Protection said it will place an immediate hold on any imports linked to the more than 30 vessels operated by Dalian Ocean Fishing, under a US law that bars goods suspected to have been produced with forced labor.Imports from Dalian, which primarily fishes for tuna, have exceeded USD 20 million as recently as 2018. Shipments linked to the company have dropped over the past year to about USD 200,000, officials said.We will not tolerate any amount derived from forced labor, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas told reporters as he announced the measure.Also Read | Joe Biden banks on $3.6 trillion tax hike on the rich and corporationsCBP issued what is known as a withhold release order that halts shipments that have suspected links to forced labor, under a law that has been on the books for decades, ostensibly to protect US producers from unfair competition.The law has been used with increased frequency in recent years, given the growing awareness of the prevalence of what is essentially modern-day slavery in a range of industries, with workers forced to work long hours for low pay, or none at all, and subjected to violence.CBP found that Dalians operations, across the fleet, met all 11 criteria for forced labor laid out by the International Labor Organization, including the holding back of wages, inhumane conditions and physical intimidation, said John Leonard, the acting executive assistant commissioner of the agencys Office of Trade. This was a rather egregious example, Leonard said.Both the State Department and Labor Department have also documented abusive conditions in the Chinese fishing industry, where mostly foreign crews often work 18 to 22 hours per day under abysmal conditions.US authorities have used the Tariff Act of 1930 to halt imports from specific companies, individual fishing vessels and all cotton and tomato products from the Xinjiang region of China, where the Chinese government is waging a brutal assimilation campaign against Uyghurs and other predominantly Muslim ethnic groups.The announcement Friday marks the first time that the US has sought to block imports from a companys entire fishing fleet, a sign that the CBPs investigation found evidence of widespread abuse on Dalian vessels around the world.Indonesias government in May 2020 accused the company of inhuman treatment of fishermen from that country, with dozens of men forced to work 18 hours a day for no pay or less than agreed upon.It said the conditions led to illnesses that killed at least three fishermen, whose bodies were cast overboard into the Pacific Ocean.Dalian did not immediately respond to a request for comment made through its website.The company has had recent financial troubles, but Leonard said it appears to be reorganizing and planning to resume operations. We need to be vigilant, he said.",TOMATO

Restrictions in place on movement within and outside the State to contain the spread of COVID-19 pandemic have adversely impacted farmers, with vegetable growers taking a big hit.According to information, the minimum support price (MSP) or remunerative price has remained elusive for paddy, tomato, banana and other crops, with even recovery of investment remaining doubtful in some cases.Paddy is cultivated in 8.81 lakh hectares in the State during rabi with an estimated production of around 61.89 lakh metric tonnes (MT). The government has opened 1,441 paddy purchase centres across the State but the procurement remained at 32.10 lakh MT as on May 27.In the first place, there are no proper transportation facilities. Secondly, payments are delayed by the government. As a result, farmers are forced to sell their produce below the MSP, says K.V.V. Prasad, State general secretary, AP Ryotu Sangham. Farmers are selling away the produce at 1,200 to 1,400 per quintal against the MSP of 1,888 for A grade variety and 1,868 for a common variety, he adds.Procurement not hitAccording to the Andhra Pradesh Civil Supplies Corporation officials, however, it is too early to say that the COVID-19 restrictions have impacted the procurement process. The procurement will increase but the numbers cant be specified as of now, says a senior official.AP Rythu Sangham State president Y. Kesava Rao says the much-touted Rythu Bharosa Kendras (RBKs) have also failed to help farmers. Taking advantage of the situation, middlemen are paying 10% less than the fixed price besides demanding 10 kg more per bag of paddy, he adds.The situation is no better for jowar. The government has not been procuring white jowar on the ground that it was not meant for human consumption causing farmers 700-800 loss per quintal.Efforts to reach Markfed officials in this regard have not been successful.Routine holidaysSimilar is the fate of chilli farmers. The farmers are losing 3,000 to 4,000 per quintal due to the closure of the chilli marketyard at Guntur, says D. Sesha Rao, a farmer.Mirchi marketyard secretary I. Venkateswara Reddy, however, says it is a usual practice to declare holidays for the yard from May 10 but it has been advanced to May 3 due to the COVID-19 pandemic this year. Still, farmers are allowed to sell their produce outside the market through e-nam platform, he remarks.The plight of farmers who cultivated vegetables is worse. With no takers, farmers are leaving tomato and brinjal unharvested, says Chalamaiah, a farmer leader. The price has fallen to 6 a kg from 10 and above.Pulp units being encouragedMarketing officials say that pulp manufacturing units are being encouraged to buy tomato from farmers and as much as 1,625 MT has been made into puree. The department has also been buying from farmers at a minimum price of 5-6 per kg and sending it to Rythu Bazaars, says a senior official.The price of bananas, a major horticulture crop, is also on the decline.D. Janardhan, a groundnut farmer in Chittoor district, says the prices of groundnut, sugarcane and other crops are also crashing due to lack of marketing facilities. There is no check though traders have been demanding 5-6 kg extra per bag towards so-called losses, he says.Even coconut business, especially of the tender one, that sees a huge demand during the summer, has suffered due to the COVID-19 curbs. Coconut is usually exported to Odisha, West Bengal, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh. However, due to lockdown and other restrictions in many States, local traders have reduced procurement citing difficulties in transportation.Farmers associations say that the COVID-19 pandemic has aggravated the problems caused due to system failure.",TOMATO

And since no ones around to judge us when were homebound, how can one not give in to unhealthy but tasty foods? The myth that healthy is not as delicious as the greasy and the fried is easily busted by the variety of millet recipes floating on social media.A versatile ingredient to incorporate into your routine is the kodo millet, which is commonly consumed in the form of idli, dosa, pongal and upma in south India. You could even try making idiyappam, payasam, adai, or soup to experiment with the millet. When we have recipe competitions, people even prepare tasty and nutritious cookies with the millet, says Dr P V Lakshmi, chief dietitian of Gleneagles Global Health City.Known to have originated in tropical Africa, kodo millet or Paspalum scrobiculatum is believed to have been cultivated in India for 3000 years. This fibre-rich crop is quite widespread in the country, adopting a gamut of names in various languages  Kodra (Hindi and Gujarati), Varagu (Tamil), Arikelu (Telugu), and Haraka (Kannada).A drought-resistant crop, kodo can be grown on gravelly, poor soil or loamy, rich soil, in Kharif or Rabi season. The flexibility in its farming process allows it to be grown by farmers in several areas of the nation. Currently, Kodo is cultivated in Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Chhattisgarh, and the Jhum fields of Arunachal Pradesh.The crop is generally grown in warm and dry conditions, where it can survive as little as 40-50 cm rainfall. As a short crop, the millet can be harvested within 100-120 days of planting. The crops are cut close to the ground and then bundled and stacked. After a week, they are threshed and the grains are cleaned by winnowing.While there are endless ways to use millets in your diet, the transition from rice and wheat is extremely sluggish due to some misconceptions. These millets are not boring. They adopt the flavour in which we cook it. Its more like rice. You can make any dish for which you typically use rice, with millets too. Be it carrot rice, tomato rice, sambar rice etc, explains Ashwanandhini Govindarajan, a food regulatory specialist and home chef. She also shares her favourite kodo recipe.The millet is the richest source of fibre in the cereals and millets family. This and other properties of the millet lend various nutritional benefits to its consumers, as further elaborated by Dr Lakshmi.For improved digestionHigh fibre content and low fat make it effective in maintaining a healthy digestive system and help with constipation.Keeps the heart in checkHypertension or high blood pressure is a growing issue in India. Kodo helps control blood pressure and is great for those with hypertension and other cardiac patients due to its high fibre and low fat.Good for weight watchersSince the millet is rich in fibre, kodo is filling even in small quantities. Hence, those who are looking to lose weight or reduce food consumption can opt for this millet.Healthy option for kidney patientsThe millet contains low amounts of phosphorus. This makes it a great food option for kidney patients. People who require peritoneal dialysis due to kidney failure would benefit from consuming kodo.Balances blood sugarA glycemic index indicates how fast a certain food can increase blood glucose levels. With a very low glycemic index, kodo keeps a check on blood sugar and is thus, a great food source for those suf fering from diabetes.Helps those with CholelithiasisCholelithiasis or gallstone formation refers to solid masses formed in the gallbladder or biliary tract, generally due to high cholesterol. Deficient in fat content and abundant in fibre, the millet is good for those suffering from Cholelithiasis.Kodo millet pongalby Ashwanandhini Govindarajan (@ashwanandhinigovindarajan)INGREDIENTSKodo millet:  cupMoong dal: 2.5 tbspWater: 1 cup, Milk: 1 cupGrated ginger:  to 1 tspWhole peppercorn: 1 tspCumin seeds: 1  tspGhee, oil, cashews, curry leaves and salt as requiredPreparation: Soak the millet for 10 minutes before cooking.METHODCook the dal and millet in a pressure cooker on medium flame for 2  whistles.

(Bryan Denton/The New York Times)At Chongming Island just outside Shanghai, Chinas most populous city, workers collect and pack tomatoes and cucumbers at a glass greenhouse operated by Dutch company FoodVentures, which harvested their first batch of produce at the site in May.The facility is one of dozens sprouting up on the outskirts of Chinas megacities that utilise high-end technology to manage irrigation, temperature and lighting systems to grow vegetables within easy reach of a large and affluent consumer base.There is a trend towards more sustainable and professional supply, said FoodVentures director Dirk Aleven.Weve seen a huge acceleration since (the) coronavirus, it is even more important now that fresh produce is produced at the spot where its consumed. Before that, they were transported for thousands of kilometers, even within the borders of China.By far the worlds largest vegetable producer, China has used greenhouses for decades, but food supply disruptions sparked by coronavirus lockdowns in 2020 have accelerated the development of high-tech glass greenhouse facilities.To avoid future disruptions, municipal governments have said they aim to build up reserves of critical staples, and develop distribution and logistics facilities. A growing affluent middle class, willing to pay more for higher quality food produced with less pesticides, is also fueling the trend, said greenhouse developers.The area used for glass greenhouses grew 28% in 2020, well above the 5.9% rise seen in 2019, and faster than the 6% growth seen last year in areas housing cheaper plastic greenhouses, according to consultancy Richland Sources. Plastic greenhouses help shield crops, but are considered less efficient than glass greenhouses. The latter can churn out high quality produce that is sold directly to retailers, reducing reliance on traditional supply chains.We see an irreversible trend since the pandemic in consumers buying more of their groceries online, and spending more on healthier choices and agricultural brands they trust, said Lim Xin Yi, executive director of sustainability at Pinduoduo, Chinas largest e-commerce platform by users.BYPASSING THE MIDDLE MANHistorically, Chinas vegetable production was concentrated in certain areas and required complex cold chain logistics networks for food to reach major cities wholesale markets. The vulnerability of that hub-centric system became apparent in 2020. COVID-19 outbreaks at a seafood market in Wuhan  ground zero for Chinas coronavirus pandemic  and at a major fresh market in Beijing caused a breakdown in the flow of goods to consumers, leading to food shortage and crop spoilage.The pandemic has pushed the fresh food industry to reduce the number of intermediaries in its supply chain network, said Gayathree Ganesan, an analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit.Built within city limits to reduce distance to buyers, the greenhouses are usually collaborative ventures between Chinese property firms and greenhouse companies from the Netherlands, a key player in agriculture technology.FoodVentures greenhouse outside Shanghai is a typical example. Over three football fields long and two storeys high, one of the facilitys units nurtures uniform rows of cherry tomato plants that snake up towards the ceiling. It is capable of producing up to 120 tonnes a month of cherry tomatoes.Being healthy is already a first protection against any virus, so people care even more about what they eat, said Aleven. Secondly,  we want to get rid of the long logistics because we are not sure if it always works and thats what weve seen during this pandemic. Localising it as much as possible is the only answer, he added. Greenshouse-grown produce is usually sold directly to e-commerce platforms and supermarkets, bypassing the many middlemen and wholesale markets that are a traditional feature of Chinas vegetable supply chain.Carrefour China, which is 80% owned by Chinese retail giant Suning, said its cooperation with greenhouses around cities has grown steadily in the past two years to meet consumer demand.SUSTAINED EXPANSIONFurther growth in key cities is likely, with a recent government document showing Beijing aims to more than double its high-efficiency facility agriculture land to over 300 hectares by 2025.That growth could further cement Chinas status as top vegetable producer.The country already accounts for 75% or more of global output of cucumbers, green beans, spinach and asparagus. Xu Dan, CEO of greenhouse operator Beijing HortiPolaris, said his business benefited last year when a second coronavirus wave hit Beijing in June, shutting down a major wholesale market and driving his daily orders up 300%.(At that time) supermarkets were looking for growers with the ability to deliver within 24 hours and they had no time to search for new suppliers, he said.But Xu said China could face some obstacles as it leaps into modern farming.The biggest challenges are people, people who have the knowledge to manage greenhouses to produce quality vegetables, he said.Most farmers are getting old and their way of production also out of date, replacing such (a) big amount of farmers is really a big challenge.",TOMATO

Then came the Covid-19 lockdown and the closing of educational institutes and Veni Aunty, as she is fondly called, was not only no longer able to cook at the canteen, but didnt have any other sources of income. To her gratitude, the army of students she fed werent willing to see her suffer. LSR students, current and past, have created an Instagram page for Veni Aunty home-delivery service.Das moved to Delhi from Mumbai many years ago and settled in south Delhis East of Kailash with her son. I started my life in the capital by stitching clothes at a small factory. But I got tired of it, so much so that I just didnt want to continue with that job, said the woman. I then began working as a masseuse, which was when I met Meenakshi Gopinath , who was then the principal of LSR. We bonded well because we were both south Indians in a north Indian city.It was during one of her meetings with Gopinath that Das was sounded out about starting a small south Indian food section in the college canteen. I was very happy with the idea, smiled the affable woman. I prepared a menu, and the college administration tasted my menu and visited my home to see whether I cooked in hygienic conditions. I was able to win their approval and have been serving idli sambhar, vada sambhar and lemon and tomato rice to the students.But the lockdown took a cruel toll on her finances. After so many years of regular income, I was suddenly left without a paisa in earnings. While in college, the LSR girls were always in touch with me and many would ask me if I needed help, assuring me that I neednt worry about anything, she said. But when the college closed down due to the lockdown, I didnt know who to contact for help.Recently a few students approached Das for an interview for their project. While talking to them, the topic of her lockdown problems cropped up. I told them about how I hadnt been able to earn anything and was relying on my son for money, said Das. You see, Ive always wanted to avoid asking my son for financial help. That is when the LSR girls suggested that I should start a food delivery service.The good-hearted girls helped her open an Instagram account under the tag of Veni Aunty. The account has her phone number and a small menu. It has been four days since she went online. Many students have been ordering food from me, beamed Das. Also, past students called me and said they wanted my food because they missed it from their time in college.One of the students assisting Das said when they learnt of her predicament, they decided to start a crowdfunding relief campaign for her. But others thought something that got her a regular income would be better than temporary monetary assistance. Thus began the food delivery venture  and a new lease of life.",TOMATO

Kota mandal from Saturday midnight till early hours of Sunday.According to information, the herd came to a freshly-planted banana plantation at Nagireddipalle last night, and reportedly devoured over one thousand plants. Later, the herd made its way to the neighbouring village, where a vast stretch of tomato crops was destroyed. As the herd consisted of baby elephants, farmers did not venture to drive them away. A few minutes before dawn, the herd retreated into a nearby stockade of trees.A farmer, who owned one of the fields, deplored that the loss could be in several lakhs of rupees. Several farmers observed that with the fresh spell of rains since June, they hoped for good times and took to fresh plantation of banana and tomatoes. They said their entire investment was rendered waste in the jumbo raids.Meagre compensationFor a loss of over 5 lakh, the forest department would pay a meagre compensation of 5,000. In spite of our repeated requests to initiate steps for protection of croplands from such raids, or erect fences at the forest-fringes, nothing has been done, a farmer said.Divisional Forest Officer (Chittoor West) S. Ravi Shankar confirmed that a large number of wild elephants split into several herds was on the move at the tri-State junction between Kuppam and Palamaner ranges. We are trying our best to address the elephant-farmer conflict in the region, but the problem continues to persist, he said.The official denied the observations of the farmers regarding payment of compensation to the crop losses.

In the lab-scale experiments, the reduced quantity of nano-DAP fertilizer input than c-DAP promoted the early seedlings growth and development in both crops. It also led to enhanced phosphate uptake efficiency in these seedlings.Based on these promising results in the lab-scale experiments, the research team is now planning to test the efficacy of nano-DAP on tomato plants under field conditions.n-DAP in reduced doses while meeting the plants optimum P nutrient requirement would also be preferred for better soil health and agricultural sustainability, said the research team consisting of Naorem Ronald Reagan Singh, Harita Pant, research scholars at UoH; Srikanth Venkata Satya Siva Vadali and Rahul Kumar, faculty at UoH, and Sreedhara Sudhakara Sarma and Tata Narasinga Rao from ARCI, Hyderabad.While several hurdles remain to be overcome before the real potential of nano-DAP can be realised under field conditions, the researchers think its application in reduced quantity may significantly cut down on the overall input of conventional phosphorous-fertilizers currently applied in agriculture.Their work titled Cryo-milled nano-DAP for enhanced growth of monocot and dicot plants was recently published in Nanoscale Advances, a reputed scientific journal published by the Royal Society of Chemistry, UK.Chemical fertilizers application is critical to boosting crop productivity. In fact, besides improved varieties and better irrigation methods, one of the factors that contributed to the enhanced crop productivity during the green revolution and afterwards is the application of chemical nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) fertilizers. However, excessive use of these chemicals over decades has affected the soil quality.Moreover, global phosphorus reserves are finite and likely to be irreversibly exhausted in the next 100-200 years. India lacks big natural P-reserves and meets its P-fertilizers demand by importing. In this context, the research findings assume importance.",TOMATO

Among several titles, his first book in English, The Safari, centres around wildlife preservation and tiger protection in India, while his first book in Hindi is a travelogue titled Aap Biti Jag Biti.Through the Prabha Khaitan Foundation, he helps carry out various cultural activities with the aim of preserving and promoting Indias rich cultural heritage. Additionally, he is a social activist working in the field of welfare, international cultural cooperation, and the promotion and preservation of Indian arts. Excerpts from an interview:What initially drew you towards exploring diverse cultures?I have always had a penchant for travelling since my childhood and exploring new diverse cultures often provide the most worthwhile travel. I love discovering new cultures and interacting with different kinds of people and it also widens your perspective. These experiences and interactions have led me to write columns for different newspapers and my own blogs for over a decade,Could you share some interesting anecdotes about your travels across the world?The most abiding memory was from my maiden visit to Incheon, South Korea where I nearly starved.This was many years back, just before it became a destination for international conventions. Being a vegetarian, options are often quite limited in foreign shores, but in Incheon, it seemed as though the very concept of vegetarian food did not exist at that time. I survived on Korean rice and tomato puree for the entire duration of my stay. Another one is the chilling account of 9/11. I was there in New York on that ill-fated day and had watched in horror from my room as the planes flew into the twin towers. In fact, a day earlier, I had planned a visit to the North Tower in the morning with a few of my friends and UN officials, but postponed my plans when I got a call from the Indian Mission requesting I visit them. That was when I not only thanked God, but actually felt I had lived to tell the tale owing to divine intervention.As a globetrotter could you comment on the future of travel, given the pandemic?I travel a lot, almost on a weekly basis and I dont remember having stayed in one place for such a long period. Though the world is starting to get back on its feet and things are slowly returning to normal, it will never be the same. There is so much uncertainty and so many protocols to follow especially for International travel. The second wave has hit us badly, and we are recovering only now, whether it will stay this way or well experience another slump, no one knows. Travel restrictions will continue to shape in the months to come, airlines have gone into major losses, hotels cannot give you the same service anymore, but now that vaccination is out hopefully we will get there.Could you give some suggestions on preserving our culture and heritage?The younger generation must grasp the value and need for cultural and heritage preservation. While I always believe in the principle of being a global citizen, we also must learn Apni Bhasha Apne Log My various organisations carry out various cultural activities with the aim of promoting Indias heritage. We work with folk artists across India and take these events overseas to showcase the essence of India. We also started a project which aims to popularize heritage among children nationwide by weaving it into formal and informal education through student activity.Are you working on a new book?I have a new book I am working on at the moment which is on my enriching experience during my visit to Oslo, Norway.",TOMATO

Healthy eating does not mean consuming boring food; it can also be flavourful.Satisfying hungerSatisfying hunger is an important part of life, but then listening to what your mind tells you to eat, can be the key to switching to clean consumption of food. For instance, having a pizza is a good example of what one could consider as not being healthy. Opting for a healthy pizza, however, is also possible.The pizza base itself can be a bread made of whole wheat in place of refined flour, to make it a healthier option. You can lift the value and taste of the tomato sauce, cheese, herbs, olives, etc., that are a part of the toppings. Similarly, if noodles are your calling, carrots, zucchini or even radish make for tasty noodle options that are balanced and leave no scope of worry for health.Try making a healthier pizza at home.

To put it simply, it is a way of eating that provides and helps fulfill all your nutritional requirements in balance and based on what suits your body type and goal. It is about how well are you able to maintain healthy eating, while also allowing some room for treats and foods you truly enjoy; even better if made the healthy way with healthier alternatives.ALSO READ | Indians prioritise eating healthy in 2021 but wont compromise on tasteAdding valueFrench fries? How about swapping them with baked sweet potato fries or dehydrated kale chips? Even if you wish to go for fries, at least make sure the right quality of the oil is used for frying. Small shifts like these can go a long way in maintaining your health.In the past, getting over the feeling of having something sweet was tough. But now, one easy way to enjoy the sweet without compromising on health is to stick to natural sugars. Fruits, raw honey, dates, dried figs, jaggery, coconut sugar, dried raisins, etc. make for alternative options.All along, natural food products have been associated with improvements in food quality and health due to reduced pesticide residue and heavy metals compared to conventional food. This clean culture has grown on account of both the availability of 100 per cent natural food products and the time to prepare meals oneself. Both are seen as being particularly important to achieving healthier food consumption.Having said that, what we eat is just half of the story. How and how much of it, our emotional state, our relationship with food, etc. also impact how we digest, absorb, and assimilate a meal. So, its necessary to focus on each of these aspects to extract the maximum worth from a nutritional meal that has ingredients that appeal to the taste buds.The saying you are what you eat might not always strictly translate into execution, but a meal that is both healthy and delicious will always be an ideal food choice for anyone who wants to live a long, happy life.(The author is lifestyle coach, and co-founder, YouCare Lifestyle)For more lifestyle news, follow us: Twitter: lifestyle_ie | Facebook: IE Lifestyle | Instagram: ie_lifestyle",TOMATO

The imbalanced sugar levels in the blood can adversely affect many organs of the body, including the skin. Most people with diabetes or pre-diabetic condition notice some recurring skin issues or have skin disorders at some point in their life. In some cases, the changes on the skin can be an indication of the onset of diabetes or if you already have diabetes, it means that your dosage needs to be adjusted, mentioned Dr Rinky Kapoor, consultant dermatologist, cosmetic dermatologist and dermato-surgeon, The Esthetic Clinics.What causes skin problems in diabetics?Over 75 per cent of people around the world suffer from type 2 diabetes-related skin problems. Diabetes can cause new skin problems and worsen old ones, said Dr Kapoor.*High blood glucose because of diabetes leads to poor blood circulation in the body, thus the blood vessels and nerves do not get enough blood and nutrients and as a result, the white blood cells lose their ability to fight infections.*Decreased blood circulation reduces the skins ability to heal and damages skin collagen thus robbing skin of its ability to bounce back.*Damaged skin cells lose the ability to function well and the skin experiences increased sensitivity to temperature and pressure.Know the changes in your skinThe positive news is that with little awareness you can contain the skin issues in the early stages while also protecting your body from further damage because of the condition.

(Source: Getty Images/Thinkstock) Skin issues in diabetes are quite common. Heres what you need to know. (Source: Getty Images/Thinkstock)Increased blood sugar leads to the body draining fluid from skin cells in order to produce urine, which in turn makes the skin dry and cracked. Another reason for dry skin is diabetic neuropathy i.e. damage to the never endings, especially of legs and feet. Dry skin tends to become itchy and when we itch, it leads to cracks on the skin, providing an easy opening for infectious elements to enter the skin leading to inflammations, redness, and irritation on the skin.Fungal infectionsFungal infections can happen to anybody but people with diabetes are more prone to it. Red, itchy rash accompanied with blisters and scales appears on the folds and warm areas of the body such as in between toes, in the fold of elbows or the armpits, corners of mouth etc. The common fungal infections in diabetic people are candida albicans, ringworm, athletes foot, jock itch, and recurring vaginal yeast infection.Bacterial infectionsPeople with diabetes suffer from more bacterial infections than normal people. Boils, folliculitis, styes on eyelids, carbuncles, and infections around the nails are common in diabetic people.Necrobiosis LipoidicaSmall sold bumps appear on the skin which look similar to pimples but if ignored, they turn into patches of swollen and hard skin with yellow or reddish brown colour. Other indications are shiny skin surrounding the bumps, painful itchy skin, and visible blood vessels.Acanthosis nigricansThis is actually a pre-diabetes condition in which the skin of armpits, groin, or neck turns very dark, thick, and velvety. This condition can also affect elbows, hands, and knees.Digital sclerosisIt has nothing to do with excessive use of digital devices but it can make it difficult for you to use them. Symptoms include tight waxy skin around on hands and stiff fingers. The hard thickening skin makes it difficult to move the fingers and the disease can spread to toes, upper arms, knees, ankles, and even elbows.ALSO READ | Tips for diabetes patients to manage their blood sugarDiabetic blistersDiabetic neuropathy causes sudden blisters to appear on the skin around the elbows, feet, or legs. They are not painful and heal on their own.Diabetic ulcersHigh blood glucose levels causes damage to the nerves and make it harder for the body to recognise and heal wounds. Open sores and wounds especially those on feet take a long time to heal and often go unnoticed.Diabetic dermopathy or shin spotsPainless brown spots that look like sunspots appear near front of the legs. Some people also notice scales and depression in the skin. This condition happens because of changes in blood vessels.Yellow patches around the eyelidsThese are an indication of poorly managed diabetes.

The true-blue Bengalurean admits that she missed the bus to pursue her dreams during her younger days. But not stopping herself now, Raju has a finger in every pie- education, entrepreneurship, and social service.I was a Kuchipudi dancer. But I come from a very conservative family and had little scope to express my talent on stage. When I was growing up, a woman performing on stage was not accepted. Even today I miss being a dancer, says Raju, who is in her 50s. But life had different plans for her. Before donning the hats of an educationist and a business person, in the early 2000s, she was part of Innerwheel, an international organisation linked to the Rotary Club, which was improving the infrastructure in Hebbal. From setting up water facilities to lighting the streets, I was part of the communi ty development project, says Raju, who later assumed the role of managing director at the family-run Vyasa International School in 2008.From being a homemaker to taking on an administrative role has been a challenge.It was difficult to shift gears. However, my father guided me and I learnt all the tricks of the trade. Getting into the education sector was a different ball game, but I enjoyed every bit, says Raju, who took over as board member of Atria Education Trust and Atria Hotel in 2015.Not having been able to pursue her dreams at a young age, she is ensuring that other women have an opportunity to take their passions forward. At FICCI FLO, we have lined up a series of startup incubation programmes, mentoring sessions to reach out to women entrepreneurs who are struggling during the pandemic, says Raju who has been part of the Bengaluru chapter for six years now. In the coming days, Raju plans to airdrop over 5 lakh seedballs (a blend of manure, seeds and red soil) prepared by kids.This, to reduce the carbon footprint. In addition, she will be taking over a project that FICCI FLO took on last year. Theyhad adopted a village in Mandya to introduce skill-based development programmes to rural women and children. We are introducing an organic farming model. This year we are also starting English and computer classes for women and children. Moreover, the village grows a lot of tomatoes and as a result we are looking to collaborate with a local NGO to set up a tomato processing unit.

These include chocolates, breads, processed foods and fast-food items, fat-rich products, including high-fat milk, and liquor. Garlic and onion (their allium content gets converted to sulphur inside our body), hot peppers and spicy foods are high in capsaicin, that cause your brain to think that you are feeling hot, resulting in the sweat glands working overtime. Caffeine too adds to the feeling of hotness as the intake increases heart rate and blood pressure and the body reacts by activating sweat glands. If you have a high sodium diet, the body expels this salt in the form of excess sweat and urine.Carb-rich food is tough to break down by the digestive system and, hence, it produces a significant thermic effect. Sugar-laced foods can spike your insulin, resulting in profuse sweating. Excess of protein powered thermogenic foods on consumption lead to more urea production inside your body, which is expelled as sweat. Smoking contributes to excessive sweating, Kapoor explains adding, When you smoke, the nicotine releases acetylcholine. This increases the bodys temperature, causing more sweating. Likewise, when you take a sip of your favourite beer or wine, the blood vessels dilate, raising the bodys temperature, causing perspiration.Tackle toneWork at reducing the workload on your digestive system by eating the correct foods. Dr Divya Malik, Senior Nutritionist at Apollo Spectra Hospitals, Delhi, suggests using olive oil while cooking food as it prevents the body temperature from rising, curbing sweat production. Green tea is popular for its calming effects. Even a glass of homemade, fresh tomato juice keeps perspiration at bay. Stay hydrated with fluids such as coconut water, lemonade, buttermilk, watermelon juice or fresh fruit juice, if you experience severe sweating.Cut out extra salt consumption by giving up salad dressings, instant soups, potato chips, roasted nuts, and canned foods. Instead, increase your intake of vegetables high in water content like spinach, bottle gourd, cucumber, broccoli, sweet potato, lettuce, cauliflower, bell pepper, cantaloupe, eggplant, and red cabbage. Fruits such as grapes, oranges, lemon, pineapple and watermelon help you stay fresh. Have bananas four times a week, and combine milk with morning cereal. Oats are a good option as they are low-fat and high in fibre. Have soaked almonds and walnuts, suggests Malik. Maintenance routines such as showering frequently, towelling the underarm areas dry and using medicated antibacterial soap are useful. Go sleeveless with a vengeance!Home remedies to fob off the underarm stench A tea tree and water spray helps keep the underarms dry and sweat-free Raw grated potato and cucumber with lemon juice work like a natural bleach Aloe vera carries healing, anti-bacterial properties A turmeric and lemon juice paste application on underarms helps immensely",TOMATO

They have gained additional income over the years with farm visits on the itinerary of most tourists. The pandemic had hit their hopes last year as tourists did not turn up following the lockdown.  Among the beneficiaries of farm tourism are those who grow a few apple trees to those with orchards. The apple flowering season is from January to February with harvesting from mid-July to August end.  Usually, farmers retain fruits on trees till the end of Onam season to draw in visitors to the farms. They get better income as tourists are allowed to pluck apples from the tree.  As the apple saplings experimentally cultivated by a few farmers were found to be a success, other farmers also followed suit converting sabarjilli farms into apple farms.  Apple cultivation gained strength after the State government in association with the Kanthallur grama panchayat promoted every home with a fruit tree scheme. Slowly Kanthallur became a favourite destination for farm tourism.  Though other fruits are also grown in Kanthallur, it was apple cultivation that gave the grama panchayat a firm footing in farm tourism. The proximity to Munnar also worked in its favour.  Apple varieties such as Royal Delicious, Gyanismith and Gyaniland brought from Kodaikanal and Himachal Pradesh are mainly cultivated, though Kashmiri varieties are also cultivated. Farmers say they get an annual yield of over 40 kg from a tree.  Tourists reach the farms throughout the year as one or the other fruit, including orange, sweet lemon, strawberry, tree tomato and blue passion fruit are there for the taking.  Chandran Valiyaveettil, a fruit farmer, says no tourists have turned up so far. He says apple is ripe and selling it to local vendors will not provide a remunerative income. Those arriving with family pay us a far better price if it is apple, orange or any other fruit, he says.  As commercial sale of apple is not done, fruit farmers like him are worried they will lose this season also.",TOMATO

Traffic on Delhis pot-holed roads has been crawling for hours. In the quiet, tree-lined neighbourhood of Friends Colony, however, 35-odd diners at boutique hotel The Manor are getting ready for a treat: a 10-course menu featuring some of the bravest, most avant garde Indian cooking yet.  Inside, chef Prateek Sadhu, 34, is readying to roll it all out. This is the first day of a three-day pop-up of Masque, his Mumbai restaurant. Tickets sold out within 48 hours of announcement. Pop-ups in four other cities are to follow  Bengaluru, Chennai, Kolkata and Leh, where Sadhu will keep adding elements to the dishes, building newer ones as he finds inspiration in local cuisines and ingredients.  Also read | Indias new spice merchants  Unique and universal  Before the pandemic hit, Sadhu had been doing precisely this at Masque  a restaurant sans a menu, where guests are encouraged to sit inside a lab and experience how he puts together thoughts and flavours after trips to different regions and farms across the country. The restaurant, which turns five this September, recently made it to number 32 on Asias 50 Best Restaurants list of 2021  the only Indian entry apart from Indian Accent in New Delhi (at number 18).  The Masque team touches down in Delhi | Photo Credit: @masquerestaurant  But this is the first time that many gourmands in other Indian cities are getting to experience Sadhus distinctive cooking because even within our competitive, growing restaurantscape, Masque is more niche than popular, more experimental than mass. Which is a shame because it is perhaps the only one in the country that prizes pure experimentation over commerce. If Masque was cinema, it would have been Satyajit Rays.  Like art house cinema, there is both the unique and the universal in Sadhus oeuvre. Take, for example, some of his dishes from the Delhi pop-up: course one was Carrot kanji, bhekti  brined and cured fish, pickled Kashmiri cherry, pickled lime, gongura greens, aam papad, and carrot kanji. Sour is perhaps the least accepted of tastes with the Indian palate. But Sadhu pushes that boundary with this study in sour. Fermented traditions from across India have been layered  northern Indian kanji, eastern aam papad, southern gongura, the pickled lime of the numerous pan-Indian achars, and the elusive Kashmiri cherry.  In course two, Sadhu puts out Corn pani puri, kalari kulcha, ghevar and chok charwan with tomato rasam. What could be the thread of thought running through his mind while putting together such disparate regional influences? A study in textures: of crusts and breads from several Indian regions. The Marwari pure veg ghevar serves as a base for Kashmiri lamb liver, startling purists, but look closely and youll find a redefining of the idea of Indian bread.  Part of the menu at the Delhi pop-up | Photo Credit: Special arrangement  Food that doesnt pander  Sadhu seems to use his individual experiences  his Kashmiri roots, travels, and the innate internationalism that comes from his stints at top global restaurants such as Alinea, Le Bernardin and Noma  as the lens to look at more universal Indian culinary traditions. Kashmiri lamb neck yakhni meets morels miso in what turns out to be his most popular dish that evening; rogan josh sausage and katlam, the Jammu bread, masquerade with NYC casual-chic; and Pondicherry chocolate gets combined with indigenous central Indian flower liqueur mahua that not many urban Indians have tasted before.  Also read | Sadhu and Krugs onion chronicles  In a way what he does is the opposite of what I do because I do not mix different regional cuisines, chef Manish Mehrotra, one of Sadhus guests that evening, who came with his teenage daughter Adah, tells The Hindu Weekend. Mehrotra, widely regarded as the father of modern Indian cuisine, whose signature Indian Accent dishes continue to be copied and regurgitated by chefs in even small towns, finds Sadhus voice to be among the most unique in Indian kitchens. He mixes cuisines and is not afraid to experiment even if diners here do not accept certain tastes or the importance of things like acidity, something that all Michelin-level dining pays attention to internationally, he points out.  The five-year plan Influenced by zero wastage, techniques like fermentation, and local ingredients sourced directly from farms, the philosophy behind Masque has remained the same since it launched. Even as Sadhu sharpened his focus to researching diverse subregional cuisines. So what is his ambition in the next five years? It is always to survive, he says candidly, about the difficulty of balancing commercial success with cutting-edge experimentation. The pandemic has made this tougher. The next few years will definitely have to be about healing from our current difficult scenario. But, personally, my ambition is to dig deeper into Indian cuisines. I feel I have only scratched the surface. I want to look at home recipes, bring them into the restaurant after R&D, understand different regions and subregions, castes and sub-castes, and how food has changed so many things in the country, he says.  Sadhus signature style is neither purist nor populist, and it is definitely not derivative. In fact, his individualistic experimentation is one of the ways forward for modern Indian food. ITCs Manisha Bhasin concurs. There are two schools of thought when it comes to Indian food, one is purist and other is inventive. But what I like about Prateeks food is that it is not about presentations; the food talks to me, there is a purity in that, says Bhasin. ITC hotels will be the venues for Sadhus pop-ups in Chennai, Kolkata and Bengaluru.  Younger chefs like Dhruv Oberoi of Olive, who was also a guest at the pop-up, add that this is perhaps the boldest experimentation in Indian gastronomy yet  with a sense of internationalism in the dishes. While a few of the courses like the lamb yakhni were comfort, there were bold combinations like chocolate and mahua that I had never experienced before, says Oberoi.  Chefs Dhruv Oberoi, Manisha Bhasin and Manish Mehrotra  What is authentic?  I remember the first meal I had at Masque, in the first week of its opening in Mumbai in 2016 in a mill compound that had fallen into disuse. There was Himalayan rye bread and sea buckthorn berries from Leh, there were textures of potato using techniques like dehydration, cooking in an earthen pit, and sous vide, there was olive oil specially pressed from Rajasthan. The whole approach was described as botanical bistronomy  what appeared to be a mix of international styles of cooking using carefully-sourced (and often unheard of) regional ingredients. Over the last five years, that focus has sharpened.  Koji-cured barramundi, carrot & passion fruit kanji  Sadhu now uses Indian ingredients as well as cooking styles and techniques and refashions them. But the sense of internationalism still binds all these. Does he see his food as Indian? Indian food as we know it today is a result of constant evolution. What is authentic? Is my mothers rogan josh more authentic than what my aunt cooks? Authentic is subjective; food is the result of migration and is constantly evolving. So while tradition is important, innovation is critical, he says. His Indian food, he points out, is not about returning to regional recipes and simply plating them with new tweaks. It demands revisiting ingredients in altogether new ways that can build cross-cultural bridges, he adds.  As you eat a bhetki with clam rogan with a puri flavoured with Goan sausage, thinking cross-cultural bridges is inevitable. The pop-up menu will continue to evolve over all its stops  much like the journey of food itself.  The upcoming pop-ups will be priced 5,500 plus taxes. Bengaluru on August 20-21 and Chennai on August 27-28.  Chef Sadhu and his team  Hat tip  Sadhus innovative cooking and internationalism (that comes from study at the Culinary Institute of America plus work at top global restaurants) have been winning him recognition ever since Masque launched. In its first year, it was ranked among the top 10 on Food Tanks 2016 list of restaurant innovators in the world. In 2020, the restaurant received the Miele One To Watch award in Asias 50 Best Restaurants list before debuting this year on the main list. Sadhu has been the first Indian chef to be a brand ambassador for Champagne brand Krug and, more recently, he contributed a simple but inventive beets with peach chunda recipe for the #Amexforfoodies cookbook featuring recipes by top global chefs. Before the pandemic, Masque had also been collaborating with leading chefs across the world to host pop-ups, including with Matt Orlando who helms Copenhagens Amass, in 2017.",TOMATO

Soyabean growers, especially in Marathwada, are concerned about mosaic virus, as well as infestation of pink and American bollworm. The Agriculture department has issued advisories for preventive measures to be taken to tackle the pest problem.  Soyabean growers from Amravati, Latur and Osmanabad districts have reported the attack of mosaic virus. A secondary infection caused by aphids, this virus causes curling of leaves, stunted growth and dip in productivity in the oilseed crop. While the attack has been limited to a few pockets, the Agriculture department has advised preventive measures, including spraying of insecticides such as Imidacloprid The advisory, issued last week, has pointed out that usage of infected seed may be a probable cause of spread of the virus.  On Tuesday, the state Agriculture Commissioner chaired a high-level meeting of various experts on the issue of virus attacks on tomato crop as growers in Maharashtra have reported major crop loss due to the attack of mosaic virus in the last two years. Nurseries which sell tomato sapling were instructed to ensure they take proper measures to control the spread of the virus. A detailed report about the matter is expected to be submitted soon.  Last year, the Agriculture department had made efforts to promote re-usage of seeds by farmers and this year, it has asked farmers to be careful about choosing seeds from non-infected parts of the field. Maharashtra has reported sowing of the oilseed over 45 lakh hectares, an all-time high.  Pink and American bollworm infestation in cotton fields is also a major problem for farmers. While some cotton fields in Marathwada and Vidarbha have reported infestation of this pest, the number of such cases has been low. Only in a few cases has the infestation caused such extensive damage that the farmer concerned has reported significant loss of crop.

For fragrance, add 5-6 drops of rosemary. Apply it on the scalp and hair and leave it for 30 minutes  *To reduce frizz, use a homemade hair mask by mixing honey, banana, aloe vera and avocado and a few drops of oil. Apply the mask on the hair and scalp for 30 minutes. Wash to see best results  *To reduce hair fall, soak fenugreek seeds overnight. Grind it the next morning and mix well with coconut milk and an egg white. Apply it on the scalp and leave it for 30mins  *Dandruff is caused by a fungal infection and not a dry scalp. Therefore, avoid oiling your hair in the monsoon. Instead, to reduce dandruff, mix yoghurt with apple cider vinegar and keep it for 20 minutes  Although these recipes involve natural ingredients, its necessary to check if you are allergic to any, said Dr Goel. Hence, do a patch test on your hand or thighs before trying these remedies.  Its a myth that one should avoid using a hairdryer. In fact, its advised to use a hairdryer in monsoon, with the heat turned off. Allowing the hair to dry naturally leaves moisture in the hair which may lead to fungal infection, said Dr Goel.",TOMATO

Also, there are sojji appams, sweet little maida pooris stuffed with rava kesari, and nutrient-rich paruthipaal made from extracted cotton seed milk blended with rice flour, cardamom, dry ginger and palm sugar. These dishes that are an integral part of the citys street food culture are staples in Sourashtrian households in South India. Yet there is much more to be discovered especially during the festival seasons and special ceremonies, when Sourashtrian families get together to prepare and share traditional recipes handed down generations.  Sensing an opportunity to revive heirloom recipes during the pandemic, members of the Sourashtra community planned food festivals to remind members about what defines their food, while simultaneously showcasing their food culture to the rest of the city. The first, a three-day food festival held recently in temple town Madurai revived some time-honoured recipes.  Sourashtrian delicacy Polte Chaino now commonly known as mutton kootu | Photo Credit: Special Arrangement  According to chef Aravinth G N, who curated the food festival, it is believed that the Sourashtrians brought the idli to South India. A blend of rice and urad dal, ground together and steamed to form cakes called iddada can be traced to Gujarat in the 10th to 12th Century. Rasam is also said to have originated in 16th Century Madurai, made by the Sourashtrians who called it pulichaar.  There are select dishes in traditional Sourashtrian menus for weddings and important ceremonies; we follow the ingredients and preparation style as taught by our ancestors, says Aravinth, whose family is known for its expertise in Sourashtrian cuisine and has been in private catering for the last six decades.  The taste, texture and ingredients of our cuisine has transformed under the influence of Tamil culture; even the names changed, says C R Venkatesh, president of Sourashtra Small Business Association. For instance tamarind rice, popular as puliodharai now, was called ambad bhaat; saman ambadi is kudal kuzambu, limbu pongal is commonly known aslemon rice, while the spicy alagar koil dosa evolved from halke dhowra thida. The original Sourashtrian tomato rice has a strong cinnamon flavour while their sakkarai pongal is prepared in paruthipaal (cotton seeds milk).  Sourashtrian delicacy The original Ambad Bhaath is what we now know as tamarind rice or puliyodharai | Photo Credit: Special Arrangement  Our ingredients and food are unique in taste, yet nowhere in the world there is a decent restaurant offering authentic Sourashtrian cuisine, rues Yogesh Thirukonda, who conceived the revival initiative.  It is estimated that there are around 6,00,000 Sourashtrians across Tamil Nadu, and Madurai is a major hub with 1,80,000 settled there. History records that the silk thread merchants from Gujarat were brought as royal weavers by the Nayak kings of the South in mid-17th Century.  Three major waves of migration happened, to Madurai, Thanjavur and Salem. When people move, they not only bring their food with them but the memories of home, says Venkatesh adding that heritage recipes and food available in the new place of work and living often amalgamate to shape the immigrant experience, while influencing their new home.  The community is now keen on compiling the traditional recipes to bring out a book on Sourashtrian cuisine because food is as much about memories as it is about festivity, culture, spices and names that ought to be documented, says Thirukonda.

But, in the days leading up to the wedding, the stress, shopping, and general anxiety about wedding arrangements can make her skin act up.  While some experience sudden acne, for others, the lack of good sleep, etc., can give rise to puffiness of the face. So, how to get rid of it?  Dr Madhu Chopra, a cosmetologist and the managing director at Studio Aesthetique, says a puffy face happens when:  1. There is dehydration due to excessive alcohol or a bad diet. The body reacts by holding on to the available water and storing it, which leads to a puffy face.  2. High salt content in the diet also works as a hygroscopic and retains fluids.  3. Allergies to trial makeup or certain types of food or medication.

While occasional cheat-meals are okay, one must also learn to consciously stay away from foods that can harm their health and lead to lifelong issues.  As we await Diwali, Minal Shah, senior nutrition therapist, Fortis Hospital, Mulund shares some pointers on how one can enjoy the festival of lights, keep their taste buds happy and also not compromise on health.  ALSO READ | This festive season, balance your cravings with these simple tips  Here are a few pointers for enjoying guilt-free desserts:  1. Choose a milk-based dessert like shrikhand, sandesh, mishit doi, kheer, etc. Milk is a good source of first-class protein, and these desserts can easily be made at home with any modifications that we desire.  2. Sugar can be replaced with natural flavoring agents like cinnamon, nutmeg, dry fruits like dates, raisins, and fresh fruits. To an extent, jaggery and honey can also be opted over refined sugar, but with quantity restriction.  3. Make a healthier choice among existing desserts.   Choose badam katli (omega-3 fatty acids) over kaju katli.   Choose besan ladoo (protein) or peanut ladoo (MUFA) over rava ladoo, Mysore pak (protein) over coconut ladoo.   Choose carrot halwa or dudhi halwa (antioxidants/vitamins) or moong dal sheera (protein) over rava sheera.   Choose payasam over a regular rice kheer.  4. Try something new and unconventional with a functional food added to it. Like dates sesame ladoo, oats dates nut ladoo, walnut ladoo, methi kheer, dudhi kheer, apple sheera, fruit kheer, papaya halwa, beetroot halwa, carrot kalakand, oats pancakes with cranberry syrup or blueberry syrup or chocolate syrup, homemade protein bars, apple pie, pumpkin pie, fruit yogurt, seeds chikki (pumpkin/sunflower/flaxseed).  5. Consider the portion size. There may be desserts which are high in fats like jalebi, malpua, gulab jamun, gulpapdi, sheera etc. If its your favourite, reduce the portion size. Cut smaller pieces to reduce the calorie intake.  6. Also, remember the basics  add a good bowl of salad with different coloured vegetables and fruits to ensure healthy fibre in every meal.  7. Add fillers for yourself and your guests, which are low in calories and tasty as well like ginger lemonade, virgin pina colada, kiwi margarita, masala milk, thandai, milkshake with fennel seeds, falooda, cucumber mint cooler, tomato mocktail, etc.   For more lifestyle news, follow us on Instagram | Twitter | Facebook and dont miss out on the latest updates!",TOMATO

He has just launched The Tangra Project, his first own restaurant, after two decades in the industry, along with business partners Vir Kotak and Anurodh Samal. The three had started Context.Eat, the parent company, earlier last year.  Located in Delhis DLF Avenue, this barely two-month-old restaurant is an ode to Kolkata, the city where Vikramjit was born and spent his formative years. Right from the second hand book shops on College Street to the river Hooghly, everything finds a representation in the restaurant, either is the form of decor or dish. This includes marble pillars that resemble stacks of books, a giant mural of a vibrant fish that finds itself sprawled across three walls, and lights on the ceiling which are reminiscent of the toony bulbs that are strung during pujas and festivals.  Working on this project brought to life a gamut of memories for Vikramjit. As we bite into a deliciously creamy haleem on toast, he recalls how he used to catch the 1 pm show with his friends at the erstwhile Chaplin Theatre, and then wait outside for a specific vendor who sold haleem. That is what he recreated.  The kosha mangsho and kochuri are what his Sundays were made up of; he would go to the butcher with his father and get the best pieces to make this household favourite. At this restaurant, Vikram has obediently followed his mothers recipe for the kosha mangsho. She came here and taught us how to prepare it and then followed it up with a video, he laughs.  The menu is a rolodex of Kolkatas iconic dishes: Chinese, Anglo Indian, Mughlai and of course Bengali. Here youll find bhetki fish wrapped with the sharp flavours of kasundi, kanch kola kofta (dumplings made of raw plantain), cholar dal, Tangra style chilli chicken and chicken cutlets so crisp that when you bite in, you hear a satisfying crunch (#ASMR). The breadcrumbs  in which the cutlets are coated  are sourced from Kolkata, as are the other raw ingredients.  Then there are the recipes that took shape in Vikrams head before finding themselves plated on elegant crockery. These include parwal guacamole: pointed gourd being cooked for 18 hours and then made into a fine paste, featuring bits of tomato and pomegranate, shining like bright jewels on a bed of green. Or spinach, roasted poppy seed in sesame sauce, a simple yet delightful combination. If you are in the mood to experiment, the menu also offers a mustard and tender coconut mousse.  The menu, Vikram says, will keep changing according to each season. Hardly a challenge, given they had to bring down the number of entries from 500 to 200.

With its sunshine yellow facade  dappled with pink bougainvillea  French style doors and courtyard bordered with white pillars, this chocolate factory and cafe mirrors the laidback charm of the former French colony. Colocal is a passion project of Sheetal Saxena and her husband Nishant Sinha. For Sheetal, a chocolate aficionado, the idea to start a bean to bar brand came to her while she was watching videos of cacao being roasted. Curiosity led her to research more on the subject and thus Colocal was born.  They are currently doing dark chocolate: 55, 66, 72 and 85%. The eventual goal is to reach 95%, says Nishant who also owns the Roastery Coffee House in Hyderabad and Kolkata. There are bonbons and truffles, and the chocolates are also blended with sea salt, nuts, caramel among others.

Apparently, that is the best way to enjoy the innovative bite-sized small plates that this trendy bistro by day and gastro by night is known for.  The bistro offers sushi, galouti kebab, golgappa with pomello, dimsums (in stunning red and purple hues, using natural colour from beetroot and purple cabbage) and more. The idea here is to try an array of cuisines rather than commit to one large main course for the entire evening.  There are large plates too. The massaman curry, for instance, where the meat is cooked for 24 hours in a sous vide machine. The food represents the chefs culinary journey across London, Dubai, Maldives and Phuket, among others. The menu also lists favourites from closer home, like appams, chicken Chettinad and cone dosa.  Owned by Gurmehar, Navdeep Singh Sethi and Alekh Vardhan, Klap was born in April, but had to temporarily shut down due to the second wave of the pandemic, before reopening in June. Spread over two floors, it has a terrace offering open air dining. The terrace also has the Chefs garden that grows basil, birds eye chilli, ajwain (carom), coriander, ginger flower, lemongrass, and microgreens such as amaranth, says Gurmehar, adding that he believes in sustainability.  To that end, cucumber and tomato peels are dehydrated and served with a dash of pink salt and paprika, as nibbles at the bar. Stems of broccoli and leftovers of onion are frozen in blocks of ice, which double up as slabs on which sushi, sashimi, and nigiri are served.

She promptly went to the market, with her son on video call to pick out guajillo chillies and a list of other ingredients he needed for dinner, including a fiery block of Achiote paste and bags of fragrant masa flour. Then came the tough part of the assignment: She had to figure out how to send it from her home in Puebla, Mexico, to Chennai.  At newly opened Tinga, the citys first taqueria, Chef Joacim chuckles about his endless hunt for authentic Mexican ingredients. Determined to keep prices affordable, in the tradition of old school Mexican taquerias, he and his partners are balancing a tightrope between economics and ambition.  Annie Gali was captivated by Mexico, after holidaying there. Gero Francis runs the Aqualum resort in Tulum, a Mexican town on the Caribbean coastline of the Yucatn Peninsula, known for its beaches and dramatic ruins of an ancient Mayan port city. We loved the experience of sitting in these tiny places and eating tacos, with sauce dripping down to elbows, chuckles Annie, nimbly squeezing past the counter with practised ease to serve customers in the cheery, compact space. She adds, Hence our tag line  messy if done right!  Chef Joachil, Annie and Gero.  Explaining that they were determined not to compromise on flavours, Giro says they spent four months working on the recipes with Chef Joacim, figuring out what local ingredients could be used, making a note of what needed to be imported, and cutting open a lot of avocados. Chef Joacim shakes his head: Indian avocados  they are just not the same as the ones in Mexico. Nevertheless, they soldiered on. We paid for extra baggage, and Chef Joacim brought the first lot of ingredients with him from Puebla, says Giro, adding And then his mom sent him the second lot.  Now that supply chains are up and running again, after the challenges of the pandemic, they are importing a regular supply of masa for their tortillas, as well as chillies and spices. Along with Chef Saravanan, who was formerly with The Park hotel, the team first set up a central kitchen in Porur, making Tingas signature fresh sauces from scratch, planning to focus on takeaway across the city. Then, a few days ago, they launched their outlet on TTK Road, and though it is small  to a sorry-I-put-my-elbow-in-your-empanada degree  it has been packed with enthusiastic customers ever since.  It is quickly evident why: Chef Joacim launches the meal with fried plantain balls in a rich tomato sauce, which are a satisfying balance of sweet and savoury notes. Then come steamy cassava balls stuffed with cheese, and hibiscus-stuffed empanadas. (The sun dried petals add a delicate floral note.) The juicy minced chicken empanadas that follow have enticingly crisp edges, and are served with dollops of chipotle mayonnaise and a chiffonade of pickled onions.  Discussing what drew him to India, Chef Joacim, who was working with Gero at Aqua Lim, says he was intrigued by the idea of starting Chennais first taqueria. Mexican food has so much flavour, and I want Indians to taste it the way it is made at home, he states, sliding chicken tinga tacos across the table. Originating in his home town of Puebla, the saucy tinga, rich with smoky chipotle, oregano, thyme and other spices, is bright with flavour and cradled by light, fluffy tacos.  The team brings out an army of sauces that include black mayonnaise dark with roasted peppers, a zingy green jalapeno dressing and the addictive salsa macha, with garlic and guajillo chillies.  There is careful attention to detail: Takeaway boxes come with detailed instructions on how to eat each item as well as a QR code that takes you to the Chefs playlist so you can groove to a nachos-appropriate background score. It is a lot of packaging though, and they should find ways to cut frills and plastic to be more eco friendly.  Tingas food focusses on fresh sauces.  Eat at Tinga if you can: nothing beats tacos straight out of the kitchen. Especially after so many months of lockdown and takeaway. Sure its a bit of a squeeze, but on the bright side, you can end your meal with churros hot from the pan: Sweet, airy and sticky with warm chocolate.

Several vegetable markets saw no takers for tomatoes.  According to information, the tomato market at Madanapalle, the largest in Asia, received 419 tonnes of tomato on Monday. While the first grade was sold at 58 a kg, the second variety was priced at 29.6 a kg in the wholesale. The market officials said that with the start of winter months, arrivals generally remain low. However, the climatic conditions in Madanapalle division led to crop damage in some stretches, leading to a slump in the arrivals.  Vegetable merchants in Chittoor said that last year, the tomato prices slipped to below 10 a kg in November, with the business suffering under the impact of COVID first wave. While bulk stocks of the first variety were transported to Bengaluru, Chennai, Hyderabad and other cities in the neighbouring States, the domestic markets in Chittoor, Nellore and Madanapalle were receiving the second and third grade varieties, which get damaged quickly.

While farmers are delighted, consumers are worried as prices soared to Rs 48 a kilo on Monday. Farmers said the inclement weather reduced the shelf life of tomatoes resulting in price rise.  Tomato is one of the key crops in the district, cultivated on 5700 hectares producing an average production of 75,000 tonnes per year. This year, because of the incessant rainfall over the past few days, the self-life of tomatoes has drastically reduced leading to a reduction in supply.

Only in April, a kilo was sold at Rs 5 per kg and six months later it increased 10 fold to Rs 24 - Rs 26 (in October). Now the prices are estimated at Rs 48-50 in Ulavar Santhai, in retail the prices have further increased. This is a seasonal fluctuation, when the monsoon passes the prices will fall drastically again.""  Selvaraj, a farmer, said, ""Cultivating tomatoes between October and December is risky as it is profitable.

He added that, even with low production, farmers are making good profits this season.  Consumers however are facing the heat of soaring prices. Natarajan, a resident of Dharmapuri town, said, ""Tomatoes are part of the staple food. Prior to Deepavali, retail prices was around Rs 60-70 per kg. Only a few months ago we were purchasing the same for only Rs 5 and Rs 8 per kg.""  Officials in the Agriculture Marketing department said, ""Many farmers stopped cultivation of tomatoes because of the severe decline in prices a few months ago.

If rains continue, traders said the prices may skyrocket further.  While business is dull in Koyambedu Wholesale Market, the prices of vegetables keep soaring. President of Koyambedu Vegetable Wholesale Merchants Association S Chandran told TNIE the prices of vegetables have shot up as there have been fewer arrivals. Usually, 80 trucks of tomatoes reach the city every day but on Monday, only 40 trucks reached the market, he said.  Retail shops in and around Koyambedu are selling tomatoes at Rs 100. A box of 12 kg tomatoes costs above Rs 1,000 today. So we are selling it above Rs 100, says a retail trader. President of Koyambedu Vegetable, Fruit and Flower Sellers Welfare Association M Thiagarajan told TNIE the price of tomato is expected to go up due to its unavailability.  On Sunday, tomatoes were selling at Rs 60 to Rs 65 per kg and on Monday, it touched Rs 70. On Tuesday, the price could go up by another Rs 5, he said. Until fresh crops arrive from north India, the price of tomatoes will continue to rise drastically as the traders here are competing with each other to get the vegetable, added Thiagarajan.  A woman, who was bargaining with a shopkeeper, says if the prices go up then she has to think twice about using tomatoes in curry or rasam. The prices have gone up drastically. I am finding it difficult to afford. My house owner gave me a Rs 50 note to buy a kg of tomato. How can I buy a kilo of tomato at Rs 50? she asked.  Apart from tomatoes, the price of other vegetables has also gone up by Rs 5 to Rs 10, says Chandran. Till the rains last, the vegetables will be costlier, he observed. President of Kovai Thyagi Kumaran Anaithu Kaikari Viyabarigal Sangam M Rajendran said the supply of vegetables to the market was not a problem. However, sales dropped drastically. He attributed the sales drop to the festival holidays followed by rain in the region. The wholesale price of onion per kg has gone up to Rs 40 from Rs 30 four days ago, he added.",TOMATO

Less arrivals of the crop in other markets due to monsoon have increased the demand and price of tomatoes from Madanapalle.  Incessant rains in Telangana, Tamil Nadu and some other major growing regions have resulted in a shortfall of supply of the crop in markets there. As a result, tomato traders are now looking at the Madanapalle market, the largest in the State.  Normally, traders from Tamil Nadu and Karnataka visit wholesale markets in Palamaner, Madanapalle and Punganur to purchase tomatoes during the season. Tomatoes have been exported to Telangana, Maharashtra, Chattisgarh, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, West Bengal, Odisha, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka from Madanapalle market.The prices of high quality tomatoes, which were sold at Rs 6 to Rs 14 per kilo at the wholesale market in September-end, shot up to Rs 50-70 in the last one week.  We have suffered severe losses this year. Now, the increased prices give us some respite. Less arrival of the crop in other States due to heavy rainfall has increased the demand for tomato in Madanapalle market. The price has touched Rs 74 per one kilo in the last week. Tomato traders from Tamil Nadu, Telangana and other states have been giving orders to local traders, said K Sukumar Reddy, a farmer from Madanapalle.  Madanapalle market is getting enough stock from the western parts of the mandals  Thamballapalle, Punganur areas and border villages of Karnataka like Lakshmipuram, Rayalpadu, Gownepalli and Srinivasapuram. Thamballapalle is the major supplier of the crop to Madanapalle market with around 70-75 per cent of the arrivals.  On Tuesday, the first grade tomatoes were sold for Rs 68 a kg and the arrival stood at 323 metric tonnes a day. This is the off-season. Usually, the season of huge arrivals is between March and August. The market has received a record arrival of 1,850 metric tonnes in a single day during the season. Now, the arrivals have not crossed 350-400 metric tonnes which resulted in demand for the produce, said N Prakash, a trader from Madanapalle market.  Majority of the produce from Madanapalle market is being exported to Tamil Nadu, coastal Andhra Pradesh and border areas of Odisha.Sources in the agriculture marketing department say that the prices have increased with the less arrivals to the market.

In the last three weeks, the prices of vegetables including tomato, beans and drumstick have seen a three-fold surge. Wholesale dealers said that even before the beginning of Deepavali, there was a shortage of supply from Tamil Nadu, from where over 60 per cent of supplies are coming to Kerala.  This has resulted in a sudden surge in prices of vegetables. Schools reopened in the state last week and there was an increase in demand for vegetables. This was also another reason for the price hike.  ""There is a 30 per cent dip in overall quantity of loads arriving from Tamil Nadu every week.

Among vegetables, tomato price in the retail market touched Rs 80 on Wednesday. Ashraf said that in the wholesale market, tomato is priced at Rs 55 and the retailers will add their margin to the actual price, which has resulted in the surge. There are also complaints from consumers that there is no uniformity in price and it varies from shop to shop. ""The vegetable vendors/retailers are charging as per their will for vegetables.

The data, relating to the past five years, reveals a jump of more than 100% in domestic vegetable production and the acreage under cultivation. While the state requires around 5,479 tonnes of vegetables per day, domestic production accounts for 4,301.4 tonnes, the agriculture department statistics say.  However, experts are not fully convinced about the states expanding self-sufficiency in vegetable production as urban markets continue to be ruled by vegetables from neighbouring states.  Pradeepkumar T, head of the vegetable science department in the Kerala Agriculture University, said: The data may be true in terms of acreage under cultivation, production and consumption. But based on that data, we cannot conclude that Kerala has almost reached self-sufficiency in vegetable production.  While there has been a significant rise in the production of vegetables like snake gourd, bitter gourd, cucumber, ash gourd, pumpkin, cowpea, ladies finger and spinach in the past couple of years, the state still has to source other staple vegetables from outside, he pointed out. In fact, a glut of cucumber and other horticultural produce like snake gourd, had forced farmers to abandon their produce in some places. However, Kerala still has to depend on the neighbouring states to meet its daily requirement of onion, potato, tomato or winter vegetables like beans, carrot, cabbage and cauliflower, as their production is significantly low in the state, he said.  The course ahead for the state should be to identify the areas or the crops that need to be improved, and explore ways to meet its requirement in other produce as well. The state should also find markets outside for the crops which have an excess harvest. The Vegetable and Fruit Promotion Council Keralam exported a shipload of quality produce to West Asia and London during Onam as there is a high demand for ethnic vegetables in overseas markets, Pradeepkumar said.  While refusing comment on the latest agriculture production statistics, P Indira Devi  former director of research at KAU  said there has been a new momentum in farming in Kerala in recent years, which is yielding results not only with vegetables but with fruits too.

At the same time, local traders pointed out that tomato was being sold at Rs 120 per kg in the retail market, and drumstick at around Rs 200 per kg.

Theres no other way to explain the perennial popularity of this cocktail that once went by the decidedly grimmer name of Bucket of Blood (or so goes one story). This combination of vodka and tomato juice turned 100 this year, according to Harrys New York Bar in Paris, which claims to be Bloody Marys birthplace. But, like the variations on this drink  with or without tabasco, bits of bacon and shrimp, celery salt, olive juice  stories about its origins are numerous.  Indeed, the lore that surrounds the Bloody Mary would seem quite out of proportion with the modesty of its ingredients and its appearance which, even when jazzed up with a salted rim or a celery stick, is not greatly appetising. Also consider the fact that, save for vodka, all the ingredients that go into its making are also used to make soup or sauce, and the Bloody Marys legions of fans make even less sense.  But, have a sip. First, the combination of vodka with tomato juice packs a punch, especially with the added heat of tabasco and black pepper. This has made the drink a popular hair-of-the-dog remedy. Combined with its heartiness, this makes the Bloody Mary a great option for a guilt-free brunch or lunch drink. Best of all, the Bloody Mary is an incredibly forgiving, fuss-free drink.

Along with eggs, these were the only two items that recorded a fall. However, not all vegetables followed this trend. Tomatoes were an outlier with a staggering 31% rise in costs. Their bloated costs were induced by a drastic fall in supply. Also, when demand surged, traders and retailers increased their mark-ups, inflating prices further.  Highs and lows  India's retail inflation rate, measured by the Consumer Price Index, stood at 4.91% in November. The price of oils and fats, fuel and light, and transport and communications increased the most in November. On the other hand, vegetable prices contracted by 13.62%.  Chart appears incomplete?

However, the vegetable which carried the third most weight, tomato, recorded a 31% rise in prices compared to last year. No other vegetable recorded an increase of more than 20% in prices.

In Bhubaneswar a kilo was bought for 70 on an average in December whereas in Bengaluru and Lucknow it crossed the 60 mark  Arrivals and mark-ups  The surge in tomato's November prices was preceded by a steep fall in their arrivals at the markets.

As can be observed, the price difference is peaking again in November 2021. This indicates that as the demand surged and supplies dropped, retailers increased their mark-up and sold at a much higher multiple than what they purchased. The graphs show that this is a routine practice almost every year-end when supplies drop and demand peaks.  Targeted mark-up  The graph shows the % of mark-up set by traders and retailers for food products in Indian cities. The data is based on a 2019 survey done by RBI. For instance, in the case of tomatoes, traders increased the price by around 20% and the retailers increased it by 40%.

Sri Sasthalaya Catering, who have been running sabha canteens for seven years, will be serving an elaborate lunch at the venue for the first time.  We have been granted permission to serve ela sappad (a traditional lunch on a banana leaf), says Ramesh Krishnan, the proprietor. He adds, We usually serve mini lunch on plates, but this year we are looking forward to serving a freshly made, authentic kalyana sappad (wedding style lunch). The menu will be diverse, with different types of rasam, sambar, vetha kulambu and moru kulambu. There will be a variety of thogayal (lentil based chutnies) and payasams everyday.  He promises that the menus will be non-repetitive, with mavadu (tender mango pickle) and veppalakatti (a traditional dry pickle made with lime leaves) readied exclusively for the meals.  Starting from 6am, the canteen will serve piping hot Chettinad specials such as vella appam, kuzhi paniyaram, appam and idiyappam. They are also launching pizza idlis: idlis steamed in circular plates, topped with mixed vegetables and loaded with cheese. Still in a Mc Sabha frame of mind? Try their cheese idlis as well.  Of course all idlis, even the ones with American accents, must come with chutney and coffee. We are serving ginger chutney, tomato kara chutney, Kumbakonam kadappa (a regional speciality made with moong dal, coconut, spices and mixed vegetables) and Chettinad masala kulambu (an aromatic gravy with vegetables, made with freshly ground coconut and spices), says Ramesh.  As for dessert, as always he says their khoa jangri is what steals the show year after year. Pricing is deliberately competitive. Sabha canteens are an opportunity for caterers like us to find new customers that may bring in business for the rest of the year, says Ramesh. Therefore my focus is to impress the customers with our food, and definitely not profit.  Dont forget to try the coffee, the kiosk is always a major crowd puller here.We source high quality coffee beans from a single estate in Coorg and cows milk from local suppliers, says Ramesh. We start serving coffee as early as 5am.

And though people were nervous about crowds, it was comforting to experience at least one familiar note in a tensely unpredictable year.  This year they have started a week ahead of the season due to an overwhelming demand from customers. People are now confident of leaving their homes and heading to the canteen, says RK Venkatesan adding, On day one (December 10) we served 300 lunches, which was rather overwhelming.  Sastha serves a typical South Indian wedding feast on a banana leaf (400 per head). In a wedding feast we normally serve a set menu such as potato roast, aviyal and usili. But I am trying to bring in more variety, says Venkatesan. For example, he says, they serve poosanikka pulippu kootu, chow chow rasavangi (a thick gravy made with coconut, spices, with brinjal or chowchow) and other traditional home style dishes. The focus is on using less oil and spices, he adds.  This is the fifth year that the caterer is running a sabha canteen during the music season.  For breakfast, while there are the traditional ghee dosas, to keep things interesting, Sastha also serves pineapple dosa, beetroot dosa and spinach dosa. If you drop by in the evening, look out for their popular crisp vethala (betel leaf) bajji, Manglore bondas and paani puri.  For the New Year, we will be serving a special lunch (500) where one can taste special items from Andhra, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Karnataka, says Venkatesh.

I am organising such a canteen only for sake of my loyal customers, as they look forward to our elaborate meals every year during the December Season.  His team specialises in traditional vegetarian meals, as well as snacks and tiffin. I try to bring into the menu, what we normally may not find in the restaurant. For example, paal kozhukattai, vella paniyaram and badam halwa, which is my fathers secret recipe, says Srinivasan. The kalyana virundhu we serve has no onion, no garlic (525 per person) and we generally avoid root vegetables during the weekends, he says, adding that Most of us did not get to attend many weddings during the pandemic, so it is a chance to celebrate familiar flavours.

Of the 1,500 licensed vegetable shops in the market, nearly 200 were wholesale shops and the rest belonged to semi-wholesalers.  Drop in prices  Meanwhile, the price of tomato has dropped to 40-50 a kg in the wholesale market on Wednesday as the arrivals had increased to 50-60 lorries. Wholesale traders said there might be a dip in the tomato cost by January following fresh harvest.  Similarly, the price of some of the other vegetables such as beans and brinjals had dropped to 40-50 kg now. They were sold for nearly 90-100 a kg until recently in the wholesale market. Beans are being procured from other parts such as Ranchi.  At present, the market receives 300 truckloads of vegetables daily. When the number of arrivals touches 350 truckloads, the cost of most vegetables may stabilise around 50 a kg, the traders added.",TOMATO

Caused by heavy rains, the price-rise brought much discomfort to both farmers and consumers. Some of those vegetables were the usual suspects  capsicum, brinjal  those two overrated brother-vegetables that enjoy a niche audience and high prices. Onions were there on the list too, but our nation is no stranger to the antics of onions.  Onion prices have toppled governments in the past and shaken up hastily made coalitions of the previous decade. Our nation has its own methods of dealing with sky-rocketing onion prices. Sometimes, we are told that there is great virtue in eating satwik food, without onion and garlic. In fact, the humble garlic is not given credit. It is an indispensable part of our diet; adds taste and flavour  but never throws tantrums of price-rise and stock-shortage.  But to see tomato in the list of vegetables was a little surprising to me. India has a rich, enviable food culture dating back to thousands of years. In this long history, tomato has made a fairly recent entry. The first tomato was brought by the Portuguese in the 16th century, and its successors quickly made themselves an important part of our diet. Travel to any part of the country, and you will find the humble tomato having assimilated with the local culture. From the Punjabis, who add copious amounts of tomatoes in their Paneer Butter Masala. To down south, where we literally bathe the dish with tomato, resulting in tomato bath.  The tomatoes were such a part of our culture, that they entered our cinema too. Imaginative directors of the 80s used tomatoes (along with lemons, mangoes and other vegetables) to show budding love in the era of kiss-less cinema. Even modern filmmakers were not immune  remember the film Zindagi Milegi Na Dobara? Where the leads broke their shackles from middle-class problems by hurling tomatoes at each other in the La Tomatina?  While the prices have thankfully stabilised since, there were reports that this could have caused a shortage in the market. I cannot claim to know much about the commodities market, but it made me appreciate the many ways tomatoes found its way to my stomach everyday. I had begun to dread a time when ketchup sachets are not handed out wherever I go. Will the gold-coated samosa in a theatre taste the same without a packet of ketchup? In fact, one dares say  will our lives even be the same without the humble sachet of ketchup being silently peddled to us? From movie halls, to restaurants, to roadside Chinese stalls, to airplanes. Imagine being given the ghastly mayonnaise with samosas. Or having a plate of sinfully delicious chow-mein desecrated by pudina chutney!  Philosophers often ask us to appreciate what we have today, instead of lamenting about the past, and worrying miserably about the future. Last months spike of inflation made me appreciate the value of the tomato in my life. There are several vegetables that are native to India. Brinjal, bitter-gourd, and drumsticks. While they are all cool in their own ways, tomato is a red vegetable that makes all the others green with envy.  Pumpkin may be the National Vegetable of India. The tomato was not born in this land. In fact, in many languages, the tomato is literally called vilayati  meaning foreigner. And yet, the tomato has found its way into our lives, our cuisines, and our systems.

501,,,,2021-12-24,https://indianexpress.com/article/world/biden-signs-bills-on-forced-labor-in-china-als-research-7687911/,"President Joe Biden signed a bill into law Thursday to block imports from Chinas Xinjiang region unless businesses can prove the items were made without forced labor, the latest in a series of intensifying U.S. penalties against the Asian power for alleged abuses.  The measure had to overcome some initial hesitation from the White House, as well as corporate opposition, to win final passage last week in the Senate, following earlier House passage. Biden also signed a separate bill Thursday funding research into a cure for Lou Gehrigs disease.  Today, I signed the bipartisan Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, Biden said on Twitter, along with a photo of him as he signed the legislative text at his desk in the Oval Office. The United States will continue to use every tool at our disposal to ensure supply chains are free from the use of forced labor _ including from Xinjiang and other parts of China.  The new law is the latest in a series of attempts by the U.S to get tough with China over its alleged systemic and widespread abuse of ethnic and religious minorities in its western region, especially Xinjiangs predominantly Muslim Uyghurs.  It requires U.S. government agencies to expand their monitoring of the use of forced labor by Chinas ethnic minorities. Crucially, it creates a presumption that goods coming from Xinjiang are made with forced labor. Businesses will have to prove that forced labor, including by workers transferred from Xinjiang, was not used in manufacturing the product before it will be allowed into the U.S.  The House and Senate each passed the measure with overwhelming support from Democrats and Republicans.  It wasnt until shortly before the Senate voted last week that the White House said Biden supported the measure. The announcement followed months in which the White House declined, despite repeated questioning, to take a public stand on an earlier version of the measure.  The United States says China is committing genocide in its treatment of the Uyghurs. That includes widespread reports by rights groups and journalists of forced sterilization and large detention camps where many Uyghurs allegedly are forced to work in factories.  China denies any abuses and says the steps it has taken are necessary to combat terrorism and a separatist movement.  The U.S. cites raw cotton, gloves, tomato products, silicon and viscose, fishing gear and components in solar energy as among goods alleged to have been produced using forced labor in Xinjiang, a resource-rich mining region that is important for agricultural production. The region also is home a booming industrial sector.  Detainees also are moved outside Xinjiang and put to work in factories, including in the apparel and textiles, electronics, solar energy and automotive sectors, the U.S. says.  Some big corporations lobbied against the measure. Apple, like Nike and other companies with production done in China, said it had found no sign of forced labor from Xinjiang in its manufacturing or supply chain.  Uyghur rights advocates and others had also feared private opposition from within the Biden administration as the U.S. sought cooperation from the Chinese on climate change and other issues.  In a statement last week, White House press secretary Jen Psaki noted export controls and import restrictions, sanctions, diplomatic initiatives and other measures the administration had already taken targeting forced labor from Xinjiang.  The White House also recently announced that it would stage a diplomatic boycott of the coming Winter Olympics in Beijing, citing Chinas egregious human rights abuses and atrocities in Xinjiang. U.S. athletes will be allowed to compete under a diplomatic boycott, but the president and other U.S. dignitaries will not travel to the games, which open in February.  While Biden signed the Uyhgur bill in private, the White House arranged a public signing ceremony _ with guests participating remotely _ for  the Accelerating Access to Critical Therapies for ALS Act.  The law will funnel $100 million annually between 2022 and 2026 into research into Lou Gehrigs disease, an incurable neurodegenerative disorder also known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and similar diseases. It will also create grant programs and provide early access to promising treatments for patients who arent accepted into clinical trials.  For too long there have been no survivors of ALS, but this bill can get us closer to changing that, Biden said.  ALS is named for the New York Yankees baseball player who retired 1939 because of the disease. Gehrig died in 1941.",TOMATO

U.S. President Joe Biden on December 23 signed into law legislation that bans imports from China's Xinjiang region over concerns about forced labor, theWhite House said, provoking an angry Chinese condemnation.

Also Read Intel facing China backlash after Xinjiang statement  The bill passed Congress this month after lawmakers reacheda compromise between House and Senate versions.  Key to the legislation is a ""rebuttable presumption"" that assumes all goods from Xinjiang, where Beijing has established detention camps for Uighurs and other Muslim groups, are made with forced labor. It bars imports unless it can be proven otherwise.  Some goods  such as cotton, tomatoes, and polysilicon usedin solar-panel manufacturing  are designated ""high priority"" for enforcement action.  China denies abuses in Xinjiang, a major cotton producer that also supplies much of the world's materials for solarpanels.  Its Washington embassy said the act ""ignores the truth and maliciously slanders the human rights situation in Xinjiang.""

Nury Turkel, Uighur-American vice chair of the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom, told Reuters this month the Bill's effectiveness would depend on the willingness of Biden's administration to ensure it is effective, especially when companies seek waivers.  U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Mr. Biden's approval of the law underscored the ""United States' commitment to combatting forced labor, including in the context of the ongoing genocide in Xinjiang.""  ""The State Department is committed to working with Congress and our interagency partners to continue addressing forced labor in Xinjiang and to strengthen international action against this egregious violation of human rights,"" he said in astatement.  One of the bill's co-authors, Democratic Senator Jeff Merkley, said it was necessary to ""send a resounding and unequivocal message against genocide and slave labor.""  ""Now ... we can finally ensure that American consumers and businesses can buy goods without inadvertent complicity in China's horrific human rights abuses,"" he said in a statement.  In its final days in January, the Trump administration announced a ban on all Xinjiang cotton and tomato products.

Many of the ingredients that we regard as integral to Indian food came from South America and only reached us when Europeans brought them here: tomatoes, potatoes, corn, chillis etc.  And so many of the dishes that we regard as being part of the ancient Indian tradition are restaurant creations from the 20th century. Butter Chicken, Masala Dosa, Chicken 65, Vada Pav, Chicken Tikka, and so many others.  This should not surprise us. It is true of all cuisines everywhere in the world. Spaghetti Bolognese was not created in Bologna but in England. Chicken Kiev was not invented in Kiev or anywhere in Ukraine. It was invented in New York. Pepperoni is not a traditional Italian topping for pizza. It is an American creation.  This is as true of the food of Asia. Along with sushi and sashimi, the one Japanese dish that has found popularity all over the world is Ramen. The sight of a Ramen house with diners loudly slurping their Ramen and soup strikes us as being quintessentially Japanese. And so it may bebut only now. Till the 1950s, hardly anybody in Japan ate Ramen.  Till then, the Japanese called Ramen Shina Soba or Chinese soba because the dish was regarded as being part of Chinese cuisine. All that changed after Japans defeat in the Second World War. The victorious American occupiers tried to feed the defeated Japanese masses, only to find that the country recorded its worst rice harvest in 42 years in 1945. The Japanese were then (and still are, in many ways) a predominantly rice-eating population, so there was a terrible food shortage and people went hungry.  The Americans responded by flooding the country with US wheat, hoping that the Japanese would eat bread. They didbread consumption in Japan more than doubled between 1948 to 1951. But much of the American wheat went into making Chinese-style wheat noodles, which eventually became an urban staple under the name of Ramen.  So, Ramen is hardly a traditional food in Japan. It is a Chinese dish that has become popular because of American occupation.  Noodle dishes boomed all over Asia after the Second World War. Take Pad Thai, perhaps the most popular Thai dish in the world. One story suggests that it was only invented in the 1930s by the Thai government to foster nation-building, and called Pad Thai to give it a patriotic character. (Pad means stir-fry, so Thai Stir-fry or something like that.)  The dish only took off in the 1950s and that is attributed to rice shortages during the Second World War. The Thais discovered that you could make two kilograms of rice noodles from a kilo of rice (no, I am not sure how this works either) so, they used their precious rice supplies for noodle-making. The Pad Thai recipe was already around so, the noodles went into Pad Thai, which became a way of feeding the nation. By the 1950s it had become a staple.  You can argue about the historicity of the stories but what is clear is that both Pad Thai and Ramen only took off after the Second World War and are relatively recent dishes, which are far from traditional in their own cuisines.  We went through a similar transformation in India. Till the 1950s, Indians did not really drink tea. It had been planted by the British using saplings brought from China, but the production was meant mainly for export. Tea drinking only took off in India in the fifties after a campaign by the Tea Board to get Indians to drink tea.  Because the taste of fine tea was alien to our palates, the Tea Board promoted inexpensive teas (made by a process called CTC) which could be cooked with milk and sugar to create the tea we now associate with every chai shop. You can judge the success of the Tea Boards campaign in India by looking at Sri Lanka where CTC consumption is low (they drink the real thingor orthodox, to use the technical term) and our kind of cooked tea is not the norm.  We recognise now that tandoori chicken and chicken tikka were popularised only in the 1950s by a restaurant called Moti Mahal in Delhi. But we also need to acknowledge that the tomato and butter-rich black dal that is served in all Indian restaurants around the world with such names as Dal Bukhara and Dal Makhni was also created at the same time. There were no tomatoes in Punjabi black dal when it was a home-made dish.  The original Moti Mahal in Daryaganj is no longer run by the families of the founders and there are at least three sets of people who use variations of the Moti Mahal trademark. So far, they have been content to serve Butter Chicken, saying that the dish was invented in Moti Mahal (which it was).  But now, there is a new battle between the descendants of Kundan Lal Gujral, who was the face of the original Moti Mahal, and the descendants of Kundan Lal Jaggi, who was one of the partners. Jaggis descendants say that Gujral looked after the front of the house but Jaggi was in the kitchen creating such dishes as Butter Chicken. Their own restaurant chain, Daryaganj, says it is run by the inventors of Butter Chicken, which makes Gujrals descendants see red because they dispute Jaggis role.  In the case of Butter Chicken, we know where it was invented and when. All that is in dispute is the identity of the man who thought it up.  But other dishes present their own mysteries. Take Chicken 65. We still dont know how it got its name. According to the Buhari restaurant in Chennai, which claims to have invented it, the dish went on the menu in 1965 and was called Chicken 65 after the year of its introduction. Well, may be. But Bangalore claims to have invented it, too. And there are other theories about its name: the chicken had to be 65 days old, it used 65 different spices, it was dish number 65 on the menu and so on.  Though there are no clear answers, we can be sure that the dish is a relatively recent invention (mid-1960s) and that it is not part of any culinary tradition: somebody just made it up.  Another southern favourite is Gobi Manchurian (though the name varies slightly depending on which state you are in). The dish is a variation on Chicken Manchurian, which was invented in Mumbai in the mid-seventies in response to customers who asked for spicy Chinese dishes. The invention is usually credited to restaurateur Nelson Wang, especially after he claimed the dish as his own in a show I did nearly two decades ago. But there are others who say that they, not Nelson, created it. And even Nelson did not, even in his worst nightmares, conceive of Gobi Manchurian.  So, lets give this authenticity thing a rest. Cuisines evolve. Dishes are created. Some are good. Some are terrible. But each dish finds its own market. And as time goes on, it begins to be regarded as authentic.
