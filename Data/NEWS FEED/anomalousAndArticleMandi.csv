(express photo by deepak daware) farmers sell their harvest at the agriculture produce market committee mandi at amravati, maharashtra. (express photo by deepak daware)when in mid-december, anand pawar decided to register the standing tur (pigeon-pea) on 10 out of his 50-acre holding with the maharashtra state cooperative marketing federations purchase centre at latur, he was quite hopeful of realising the governments minimum support price (msp) of rs 5,450 per quintal for the soon-to-be-harvested crop. at the time of registration, this farmer from harangul khurd village of latur taluka was even promised he would soon receive an sms, specifying the date and time for him to proceed to make the sale at the centre.the sms never came and, more than five months later, pawar is still stuck with the 65 quintals of tur he harvested in mid-january. and he deeply regrets not having sold his crop then at the prevailing market rate of rs 4,200-4,250 per quintal. tur is currently trading in the latur market yard at rs 3,550-3,600 per quintal. why promise something you did not intend to deliver? what option do i have other than sell at todays going price? i need the money for my next crop, with the monsoon rains just 2-3 weeks away, says pawar, whose sole consolation is from the soyabean on his balance 40 acres. while it also sold initially below the msp of rs 3,050 per quintal  at rs 2,550-2,600 in november and rs 2,800-2,900 in december  prices rose significantly thereafter. pawar could fetch rs 3,800-3,900 per quintal for his last lot of soyabean sold in early-april.pawar is a relatively better-off farmer, who was able to make some money by not selling his entire soyabean crop during the peak marketing season of november-december. but 2017-18 has been an unmitigated disaster even for him, when it comes to pulses. for growers of tur, urad (black gram), moong (green gram), chana (chickpea) and masur (lentil), this is a year they would simply not want to remember.also read | does growth in pulses output mean india has reached self-sufficiency?the curse of low realisations for farmers  ironically, in a crop where india has been perpetually import-dependent  comes despite government agencies undertaking record procurement during the last two years. in the 2015-16 crop year (july-june), a mere 1.19 lakh tonnes (lt) of pulses were procured under the price stabilisation fund set up by the narendra modi government: 50,422.53 tonnes during kharif and 69,049.08 tonnes in the rabi marketing season. in 2016-17, procurement by the national agricultural cooperative marketing federation (nafed), food corporation of india and small farmers agribusiness consortium rose over 13 times to 15.62 lt. that included 14.74 lt of kharif pulses (11.66 lt tur, 2.20 lt moong and 0.89 lt urad) and 0.87 lt of rabi pulses (0.60 lt chana and 0.27 lt masur).in the current year, procurement, which is ongoing, is set to further double. nafed, the only government agency now procuring under the so-called price support scheme (pss), has till now bought 14.59 lt of chana, 8.58 lt of tur, 2.95 lt of moong, 2.03 lt of urad and 1.36 lt of masoor. that adds up to around 29.50 lt. the final figure could well cross 30 lt  unprecedented as far as pulses go.but unlike for wheat and paddy  for which there are established systems that have stood the test of time  the actual process of procurement has been far from smooth in the case of pulses. under pss, the msp-based procurement is done by state marketing federations that are sub-agents of nafed. in states such as madhya pradesh and maharashtra, farmers wanting to sell are required to register themselves first at the procurement centres of their areas. as part of this process, they have to mention the area planted under a particular crop, while providing proof of land ownership (copy of 7/12 revenue extract) and also their aadhaar identification and bank account numbers. once registration happens, the farmers are supposed to get an sms intimation of the date for bringing their produce, the idea being to avoid overcrowding at the procurement centres. payments, too, are to be credited directly into their bank accounts within 48 hours of the sale taking place.however, things havent quite worked that way on the ground.also read | breeding challenges: hybrid rice clicks better in poor than agriculturally prosperous statesin mp, farmers have had to wait in long queues at the mandis for selling their chana and masur at the governments msps. there have even been reports of a couple of farmers dying after standing for hours in the searing summer heat. the situation has been rendered worse by the shortage of weighing machines and porters, especially in the smaller mandis. notwithstanding all this, government agencies, as on may 22, had managed to procure 9.10 lt of chana from mp (worth rs 4,003.96 crore at the msp of rs 4,400 per quintal) and another 2.67 lt (rs 1,174.99 crore) from rajasthan. the agencies also bought 1.34 lt of masur from mp, whose msp value was rs 571.23 crore. both mp and rajasthan are, incidentally, headed for state assembly polls in november-december this year.in maharashtra, many farmers registered their crop at government purchase centres, but could not sell a single quintal at the msp. pawar sought to sell, apart from his 65 quintals of tur, also 25 quintals of chana grown on five acres this rabi season. i went to the centre on monday to make a final enquiry on whether at least my chana would be procured. but the officials could not give any definite date. how does this government really expect our incomes to double?, he asks sarcastically.government agencies procured 4.01 lt of tur from maharashtra is the 2016-17 kharif marketing season. this time, they purchased another 3.25 lt, worth rs 1,770.84 crore at the msp, but farmers havent received even half of this amount so far (when they were supposed to get paid within 48 hours). the reason for it is that the procured produce has not been moved from the centres to the designated godowns. nafed will not realise the payments without that. but the produce cannot be moved, as there is no space in the godowns, which are full with the unsold tur and chana of last year, admits a maharashtra government official.with the new planting season about to start, nafed is desperately issuing tenders for offloading its inventories. total unsold stocks of pulses in government godowns, from two years of record procurement, are estimated at more than 40 lt. these stocks  on top of continuing imports  will exert further pressure on prices when the next crop arrives from september. the only thing that can prevent such an eventuality is drought. that, again, isnt going to help farmers.for all the latest india news, download indian express app",GWALIOR

(express photo by partha paul) with farm incomes for crops like paddy coming down, farmers are going for cash crops like mustard and potato in west bengal howrah district. this year overproduction of paddy also led to a crisis among cultivators. (express photo by partha paul)a drop in potato production from last years 110 lakh tonne to 80-100 lakh tonne this year is anticipated, but is unlikely to impact the staple crops prices, officials said.speaking at the 53rd annual general meeting of west bengal cold storage association (wbcsa) in kolkata on monday, state agricultural marketing minister tapan dasgupta and wbcsa president patit paban de shared the view that potato prices would not be hit due to an excess stock of about 9 lakh tonne from last year.production of potatoes will be lesser in comparison to last year, but it will still be far more than the average consumption of the state. also, last years stock will help in keeping the price of potatoes in check, said de.the area of cultivation for potatoes has been reduced by five per cent in the state this year. as per sources, the average land allocated for potato cultivation is around 4.6 lakh hectares, but this will be reduced to 4.4 lakh hectares this season.at present, out of 575 cold storage units in the state, 460 are dedicated to storage of potatoes. with a capacity of 70 lakh mt (metric tonne) and enhanced efficiency, these units have adequate space to store the states entire production. however, high crop production across the country severely impacted the market, and despite efforts from all parties involved, the stock of potatoes kept in cold storage could not be fully sold. this despite extending the normal period of storage till december, officials said.pointing out that the annual consumption of potatoes in the state is around 65 lakh tons, including seeds, de appealed to the state government to encouraging marketing of the crop in neighbouring states and abroad right after the start of the season.we request government authorities to make timely plans for marketing of excess produce to avoid distress sales. most of the old cold storage units operate with bank loans for various purposes. however, due to insufficient rent recovery, many are unable to repay the loans. we submit a rent revision prayer to the government every year. the current rate is rs 152 per quintal for north bengal and rs 148 per quintal for south bengal. we will try to bring it to rs 180 per quintal, he said.when asked about this, dasgupta told the indian express, they havent applied to us yet. however, rent revision depends on the instructions given by chief minister mamata banerjee we will ensure farmers get their dues. last year, there was excessive stock, hence they didnt get good money.the minister also said the government is encouraging cold storage owners to turn to solar power.in order to maintain an eco-friendly environment, we are encouraging them to install solar power solar units will reduce the operating cost. so far, this has been initiated in 10 cold storage units in midnapore, bankura, hooghly, etc he said.however, de pointed out that investing in solar power units was a costly endeavour.to run a cold storage 200 kwh solar unit, rs 1 crore is necessary. however, in absence of any subsidy for such a huge investment, there is a remote possibility of installing such units using ones own funds.for all the latest kolkata news, download indian express app",KOLKATA

(express photo by partha paul)a drop in potato production from last years 110 lakh tonne to 80-100 lakh tonne this year is anticipated, but is unlikely to impact the staple crops prices, officials said.speaking at the 53rd annual general meeting of west bengal cold storage association (wbcsa) in kolkata on monday, state agricultural marketing minister tapan dasgupta and wbcsa president patit paban de shared the view that potato prices would not be hit due to an excess stock of about 9 lakh tonne from last year.production of potatoes will be lesser in comparison to last year, but it will still be far more than the average consumption of the state. also, last years stock will help in keeping the price of potatoes in check, said de.the area of cultivation for potatoes has been reduced by five per cent in the state this year. as per sources, the average land allocated for potato cultivation is around 4.6 lakh hectares, but this will be reduced to 4.4 lakh hectares this season.at present, out of 575 cold storage units in the state, 460 are dedicated to storage of potatoes. with a capacity of 70 lakh mt (metric tonne) and enhanced efficiency, these units have adequate space to store the states entire production. however, high crop production across the country severely impacted the market, and despite efforts from all parties involved, the stock of potatoes kept in cold storage could not be fully sold. this despite extending the normal period of storage till december, officials said.pointing out that the annual consumption of potatoes in the state is around 65 lakh tons, including seeds, de appealed to the state government to encouraging marketing of the crop in neighbouring states and abroad right after the start of the season.we request government authorities to make timely plans for marketing of excess produce to avoid distress sales. most of the old cold storage units operate with bank loans for various purposes. however, due to insufficient rent recovery, many are unable to repay the loans. we submit a rent revision prayer to the government every year. the current rate is rs 152 per quintal for north bengal and rs 148 per quintal for south bengal. we will try to bring it to rs 180 per quintal, he said.when asked about this, dasgupta told the indian express, they havent applied to us yet. however, rent revision depends on the instructions given by chief minister mamata banerjee we will ensure farmers get their dues. last year, there was excessive stock, hence they didnt get good money.the minister also said the government is encouraging cold storage owners to turn to solar power.in order to maintain an eco-friendly environment, we are encouraging them to install solar power solar units will reduce the operating cost. so far, this has been initiated in 10 cold storage units in midnapore, bankura, hooghly, etc he said.however, de pointed out that investing in solar power units was a costly endeavour.to run a cold storage 200 kwh solar unit, rs 1 crore is necessary. however, in absence of any subsidy for such a huge investment, there is a remote possibility of installing such units using ones own funds.for all the latest kolkata news, download indian express app",KOLKATA

low temperature, less humidity and moderate sunshine. untimely rains during the harvest season only spell havoc for the crop produce.the india meteorological department (imd) forecast had said that a

days when agricultural labourers use bare hands. now, in the absence of both, farmers estimate a delay of close to two weeks.lack of machinery and labour has also propped up the problem of storage. as a result, farmers have decided to delay harvesting as much as possible in the absence of any directions from the government on how to manage the produce after it is cultivated.several farmer organisations have requested respective state governments to ensure availability of combine harvesters that are stuck in various states. they have also sought adequate space in warehouses to store their produce till they get labourers to take it to the market.harvester operators from north india usually go to central and western parts of the country in winter to help farmers cultivate wheat there. during this time, they return to states like punjab, haryana and uttar pradesh to help harvest the rabi crop. farmers in haryana said many mechanical harvesters are stuck in states such as

transport them to markets are being greeted with lack of demand in mandis. with most industrial and restaurant activity coming to a standstill, demand has nosedived, resulting in unprecedented dip in prices, especially of perishable goods.to understand the impact of the pandemic on markets, consider this: per quintal price of gram in maharashtra's latur has dipped to rs 3,650 whereas the minimum support price (msp) for the crop is rs 4,875. similarly in rajasthan's alwar, the market price of mustard currently stands at rs 3,600 per quintal almost rs 1,000 less than its msp.in karnataka,

be allowed to travel for work within the state with certain conditions but will not be able to cross borders. we have permission to harvest during the lockdown, but theres no labour available. my entire family has been manually harvesting the crop since last week,"" said raju singh, a wheat farmer in madhya pradesh.added to this is the delay in arrival of combine harvester machines that are responsible for more than 85 per cent of the harvesting activities in the country. on an average, farmers informed, harvesting takes three days using machines. the same activity is performed in seven days when agricultural labourers use bare hands. now, in the absence of both, farmers estimate a delay of close to two weeks.lack of machinery and labour has also propped up the problem of storage. as a result, farmers have decided to delay harvesting as much as possible in the absence of any directions from the government on how to manage the produce after it is cultivated.several farmer organisations have requested respective state governments to ensure availability of combine harvesters that are stuck in various states. they have also sought adequate space in warehouses to store their produce till they get labourers to take it to the market.harvester operators from north india usually go to central and western parts of the country in winter to help farmers cultivate wheat there. during this time, they return to states like punjab, haryana and uttar pradesh to help harvest the rabi crop. farmers in haryana said many mechanical harvesters are stuck in states such as maharashtra, gujarat, madhya pradesh and rajasthan because of lockdown curbs.low demand resulting in excess produce, plummeting pricesthose farmers who are somehow able to harvest their crops and transport them to markets are being greeted with lack of demand in mandis. with most industrial and restaurant activity coming to a standstill, demand has nosedived, resulting in unprecedented dip in prices, especially of perishable goods.to understand the impact of the pandemic on markets, consider this: per quintal price of gram in maharashtra's latur has dipped to rs 3,650 whereas the minimum support price (msp) for the crop is rs 4,875. similarly in rajasthan's alwar, the market price of mustard currently stands at rs 3,600 per quintal almost rs 1,000 less than its msp.in karnataka, tomato prices crashed by over 50 per cent, from rs 1,290 a quintal last year to rs 560 now.ladies finger rates are also down by nearly 40 per cent. in punjab, green chillies, cucumber, capsicum and cabbage are lying dumped at mandis for lack of buyers.farmers across maharashtra, punjab and haryana informed that there are hardly any buyers in mandis. ""i have hired carriers by spending double the amount to transport my crops to the mandis but to no use. three days since i found a sizeable buyer,"" said mahesh kumar singh, a farmer in haryana.devappa anna shetti also known as raju shetti, former member of parliament from maharashtra and a farmer leader explained the difficulties peasants in the state are facing.""not just the harvest of rabi crops, farmers have not been able to transport their vegetables to the markets for sale. those who have, are returning with almost their entire stock. government buying has just started. these vegetables are transported to various states. without that, mandis in the country will have serious shortage of supply. farmers will get no money. the lockdown will impact the famers not just for this season but will financially dent their capacity to buy for the next year as well,"" he said.despite these serious concerns, india may not have to go hungry in the near future.as per second advance estimates for 2019-20 released last week, total food grains production in the country is estimated at record 291.95 million tones, which is higher by 6.74 million tonnes than the production of food grains of 285.21 million tonnes achieved during 2018-19.the production during 2019-20 is higher by 26.20 million tonnes than the previous five years (2013-14 to 2017-18) average production of food grains.support the daily wage earners who have been hit the hardest by the covid-19 crisis. click here to contribute to the cause. #indiagivesthe daily news18 coronavirus covid-19 newsletter - get your copy here.subscribe to news18 daybreak. follow us on twitter, instagram, facebook, telegram, tiktok and on youtube",KANPUR

across the country have been forced to virtually shut down their businesses following the governments surprise move to demonetise high-value currency notes and transition from a cash-based to a less cash economy. besides, traders said, there was a lot of confusion and misinformation due to the government changing the norms every other day.traders pleato improve the situation, the traders have suggested they be allowed to accept old currency notes (of rs.500 and rs.1000 denominations) with proper kyc (know your customer) forms, with a commitment to deposit the notes in banks on the very same day. also, they want the limits on withdrawal from the current account to be lifted, for ease of doing business. supporting this suggestion given by the apex traders body confederation of all india traders (cait), industry body assocham said: besides, traders can also be asked to maintain strict stock details with fool-proof system against back-dated transactions and other misuse. considering the limitations of the income tax departments, the staff of the state governments and other central departments can be deployed with a provision of strict penalties on any misuse.umesh seth, joint treasurer (delhi), cait, said: there is a total shut down of trade. withdrawals of even up to rs 50,000 are being rejected (by banks) because of shortage of currency. mr. seth, who is also the joint secretary, automotive parts merchants association, added: also, we cannot do much business with a weekly withdrawal limit of rs 50,000 from the current account leading to a monthly limit of rs.2 lakh, as it is not enough to meet our basic monthly expenses like rent, wages and daily incidental expenses. for those dealing in high value items, doing business has become virtually impossible. he pointed out that with all the workers waiting in queues before banks to withdraw money or to deposit old notes, many man-hours are being wasted, which, in turn, was a loss to the national economy.in karnataka, the agricultural produce market committee yards in hubballi, belagavi and dharwad were closed on thursday due to lack of sufficient currency notes. many traders are finding it difficult to pay the farmers for their produce. the main market areas in bengaluru city were also impacted. apmc yard in bengaluru is known for its cash payments. only because of the on-time payment did many farmers prefer bengaluru. increasing the current account limit to rs.50, 000 per week will not help us in any way as we need to pay in lakhs to farmers on a daily basis, said ravishankar b., director, bengaluru onion & potato merchant association. he added, this is the season when karnataka onion farmers bring their produce to the market. we need to pay the trucks, farmers and other workers. in the current scenario we are not able to help the farmers and reward them for their work.business has dropped over 70 per cent as most of the trade is depended on the cash economy. as per the estimates of the karnataka hosiery & garment association (khga), the sector has seen the lowest business in the last couple of years. the association also said the current account weekly withdrawal limit of rs.50,000 will not help the traders as many small traders need more than rs.50000 for daily business needs. the government should soon bring rs. 500 notes to the market to achieve normalcy, said sajjan raj mehta, former president, khga.in kolkata, anupam boral, proprietor of a small firm, geetanjali solar enterprises (gse), said the shortage of rs 100 notes is also hurting business. for instance, boral said he is finding it difficult to get five notes in rs 100 denomination to buy the papers for the tender floated by the central glass research and ceramic institute. though there is an option of pay order, small businesses like ours are having difficulties in finding people to stand in a long queue on our behalf to get a bank order."" on other practical difficulties that he facing on a daily basis, boral said, i am also unable to pay my transporters as their bill varies between rs 800 to rs 1500. the shortage of rs 100 rupee is crippling us. even if i avail the cash credit facility  it comes in five notes of rs 2000 denomination.""in coimbatore, there is a lot of confusion and misinformation on cash and withdrawal limits. p.k. govindaraj, who has a foundry at the sidco industrial estate at kurichi in coimbatore, went to the bank on thursday morning to draw rs. 30,000 from his cash credit (cc) account, but was in for a shock when he was told that the maximum limit is only rs. 10,000. he said, i employ 50 people and need rs. 80,000 a week for their wages and another rs. 20,000 for payment to vehicles, etc. how can i manage a week with rs. 10,000?the castings manufactured at the foundry are sold at his shop in coimbatore city. we usually use the cash from the sales at the shop. but, there are so many restrictions now and i had to draw money from the bank. i have this account for nearly 40 years. we should be allowed to withdraw more, he says. however, another foundry owner in the city was able to draw rs. 50,000 from his cc account. he had drawn rs. 10,000 last friday and was allowed to draw another rs. 40,000 on thursday. there is no clarity on the issue. some banks allowed the industries that have cc account to draw rs. 50,000 a week and some have not, said v. sundaram, president of coimbatore district small industries association.the plight of small scale industrial units in hyderabad is no different from those in several parts of the country as a result of demonetization. cash is the predominant mode of transaction for them. since bank finance to them is limited, the entrepreneurs depend on hand loans and the informal sector  avenues that have hit a roadblock over the last week.federation of telangana and andhra pradesh chambers of commerce and industry leaders ravindra modi and v. anil reddy counted payment of wages, transportation charges and replacement of machinery spare parts among aspects that get affected immediately. since customers are not insulated from the cash crunch, there is bound to be pressure on revenue generation cycle.though there is bound to be impact in the short term, the units need to take into account benefit the demonetization exercise would deliver in the long run, says k.koteswara rao, convenor of all india forum for small and medium industries. he expected the lending rates to come down and money coming into the system to be used for infrastructure development

across the country have been forced to virtually shut down their businesses following the governments surprise move to demonetise high-value currency notes and transition from a cash-based to a less cash economy. besides, traders said, there was a lot of confusion and misinformation due to the government changing the norms every other day.traders pleato improve the situation, the traders have suggested they be allowed to accept old currency notes (of rs.500 and rs.1000 denominations) with proper kyc (know your customer) forms, with a commitment to deposit the notes in banks on the very same day. also, they want the limits on withdrawal from the current account to be lifted, for ease of doing business. supporting this suggestion given by the apex traders body confederation of all india traders (cait), industry body assocham said: besides, traders can also be asked to maintain strict stock details with fool-proof system against back-dated transactions and other misuse. considering the limitations of the income tax departments, the staff of the state governments and other central departments can be deployed with a provision of strict penalties on any misuse.umesh seth, joint treasurer (delhi), cait, said: there is a total shut down of trade. withdrawals of even up to rs 50,000 are being rejected (by banks) because of shortage of currency. mr. seth, who is also the joint secretary, automotive parts merchants association, added: also, we cannot do much business with a weekly withdrawal limit of rs 50,000 from the current account leading to a monthly limit of rs.2 lakh, as it is not enough to meet our basic monthly expenses like rent, wages and daily incidental expenses. for those dealing in high value items, doing business has become virtually impossible. he pointed out that with all the workers waiting in queues before banks to withdraw money or to deposit old notes, many man-hours are being wasted, which, in turn, was a loss to the national economy.in karnataka, the agricultural produce market committee yards in hubballi, belagavi and dharwad were closed on thursday due to lack of sufficient currency notes. many traders are finding it difficult to pay the farmers for their produce. the main market areas in bengaluru city were also impacted. apmc yard in bengaluru is known for its cash payments. only because of the on-time payment did many farmers prefer bengaluru. increasing the current account limit to rs.50, 000 per week will not help us in any way as we need to pay in lakhs to farmers on a daily basis, said ravishankar b., director, bengaluru onion & potato merchant association. he added, this is the season when karnataka onion farmers bring their produce to the market. we need to pay the trucks, farmers and other workers. in the current scenario we are not able to help the farmers and reward them for their work.business has dropped over 70 per cent as most of the trade is depended on the cash economy. as per the estimates of the karnataka hosiery & garment association (khga), the sector has seen the lowest business in the last couple of years. the association also said the current account weekly withdrawal limit of rs.50,000 will not help the traders as many small traders need more than rs.50000 for daily business needs. the government should soon bring rs. 500 notes to the market to achieve normalcy, said sajjan raj mehta, former president, khga.in kolkata, anupam boral, proprietor of a small firm, geetanjali solar enterprises (gse), said the shortage of rs 100 notes is also hurting business. for instance, boral said he is finding it difficult to get five notes in rs 100 denomination to buy the papers for the tender floated by the central glass research and ceramic institute. though there is an option of pay order, small businesses like ours are having difficulties in finding people to stand in a long queue on our behalf to get a bank order."" on other practical difficulties that he facing on a daily basis, boral said, i am also unable to pay my transporters as their bill varies between rs 800 to rs 1500. the shortage of rs 100 rupee is crippling us. even if i avail the cash credit facility  it comes in five notes of rs 2000 denomination.""in coimbatore, there is a lot of confusion and misinformation on cash and withdrawal limits. p.k. govindaraj, who has a foundry at the sidco industrial estate at kurichi in coimbatore, went to the bank on thursday morning to draw rs. 30,000 from his cash credit (cc) account, but was in for a shock when he was told that the maximum limit is only rs. 10,000. he said, i employ 50 people and need rs. 80,000 a week for their wages and another rs. 20,000 for payment to vehicles, etc. how can i manage a week with rs. 10,000?the castings manufactured at the foundry are sold at his shop in coimbatore city. we usually use the cash from the sales at the shop. but, there are so many restrictions now and i had to draw money from the bank. i have this account for nearly 40 years. we should be allowed to withdraw more, he says. however, another foundry owner in the city was able to draw rs. 50,000 from his cc account. he had drawn rs. 10,000 last friday and was allowed to draw another rs. 40,000 on thursday. there is no clarity on the issue. some banks allowed the industries that have cc account to draw rs. 50,000 a week and some have not, said v. sundaram, president of coimbatore district small industries association.the plight of small scale industrial units in hyderabad is no different from those in several parts of the country as a result of demonetization. cash is the predominant mode of transaction for them. since bank finance to them is limited, the entrepreneurs depend on hand loans and the informal sector  avenues that have hit a roadblock over the last week.federation of telangana and andhra pradesh chambers of commerce and industry leaders ravindra modi and v. anil reddy counted payment of wages, transportation charges and replacement of machinery spare parts among aspects that get affected immediately. since customers are not insulated from the cash crunch, there is bound to be pressure on revenue generation cycle.though there is bound to be impact in the short term, the units need to take into account benefit the demonetization exercise would deliver in the long run, says k.koteswara rao, convenor of all india forum for small and medium industries. he expected the lending rates to come down and money coming into the system to be used for infrastructure development in the country.(inputs from pradeesh chandran, indrani dutta, m. soundariya preetha, n. ravi kumar & arun s)",BENGALURU

""this amount is not adequate to meet transport expenses and wages of labourers,"" patel said. bhikhabhai gajeram, the secretary of junagadh apmc, said: ""traders in apmc are finding it difficult to purchase."" he said oil millers, whose entire business was conducted with cash, were not willing to pay through cheques. ""hence when there is no buying, apmc traders are not purchasing from farmers,"" gajeram said. a b pandya, the secretary of amreli apmc, said farmers feared that some cheques may be dishonoured. they were also concerned that traders could cheat them. however, in ahmedabad, some traders were doing business with cheques . kishore, an ahmedabad trader, said: ""we are purchasing onions and potatoes coming to the apmc with cheques and sellers are accepting cheques readily."" at the apmc jetalpur, against the average of 500 trucks, only 140 arrived for trading. prices remained constant and there was not much of an impact.",KANPUR

rice, potatoes, onions, milk, edible oils and poultry products.in consonance with other states, bhubaneswar markets have witnessed a reduction in prices of fruits and vegetables by 10-15 per cent and 20 per cent, respectively.the arrival of winter produce along with lack of consumer demand is helping to keep vegetables prices low. some vegetables are now available at 30-50 per cent less.sudhakar

arisen due to demonetisation.hyderabadconsumers tight-fistedj deepthi nandan reddybarring a few exceptions, demonetisation has left prices of essential commodities untouched, but prices of perishable goods such as vegetables, fruits have decreased considerably. vegetables such as tomatoes were in fact dumped in the hyderabad markets last week as there were few takers. consumers have either not been able to access small notes of valid currency or having gained access to such notes have been reluctant to part with them.this tight hold on cash has badly affected vegetable and meat sales and prices. for instance, tomatoes sold at rs 20 per kg before demonetisation are now available for rs 10. prices of other vegetables have also dropped as sellers lowered prices to dispose of produce. buyers have become scarce, said mohammed ibrahim, a vegetable vendor at mehdipatnam in hyderabad. further, due to rumours and apprehensions of transport being affected post-demonetisation, the price of salt touched rs 60 immediately after november 8. however, the situation soon returned to normal.bengalurudip in prices of perishablesakram mohammedprices of essential commodities like rice and pulses have not seen much difference in bengaluru post demonetisation, but prices of perishable commodities like fruits and vegetables are down by 20-30 per cent, according to bangalore wholesale foodgrains and pulses merchant association. prices of pulses have been more or less stable but volumes are low. there are three issues here. first, sales have come down. second, perishables are being sold at lower prices since they cannot be stored for a long time. third, small vendors have been hit really hard.a vegetable trader kamraj k said he procures two small truckloads of vegetables every

down by half in the aftermath of the demonetisation drive. but that has not had an impact on prices.even in cases like potatoes where the price is supposed to have an upward revision around this time has not happened.in this currency-driven business, they have no money to procure supplies due to restriction on cash withdrawal. in that, the smaller traders are at a severe disadvantage vis-a-vis the

than two weeks after confiscatory demonetisation sucked cash out from the economy, the food market has remained by and large steady, rather deceptively so. this held true at small retailers and vegetable shops in the cities and towns that express checked out.there are small differences, but all marginal. the perishable commodities  tomato was a common casualty  did witness a downturn, but mostly due to stock clearance sale in the evenings. but the figures may not tell the full story. this is not stability, insist traders, who have been having few visitors and minimal sales. the fall in demand starts at 40-50 per cent and climbs higher for hawkers. its this decline in demand that is keeping the price steady, a perilous equilibrium.veterans in the trade who have learnt to look beyond the immediate told express that the situation could change if cash does not return to the market in the next few weeks and if stocks dry up. what the low demand conceals are stories about farm produce that could not be brought to the market due to supply chain disruption following the cash crunch. in some cases, harvests have been postponed as the price offered is less than what is required to pay the farm hands.every acre that is not cultivated and every tonne of produce not reaching the market will add up to a sharp decline in supply in the coming months, the period when markets are hoping to stabilise with the expected arrival of currency. if the fears prove to be true, a price inflation may be around the corner.express does a status check across south india and odisha on the impact of demonetisation on prices and sales of small retailers and vegetable and fruit shops.kochiwhat when the stocks are over?shibu b stwo weeks into demonetisation of big currency notes, markets have been able to maintain steady prices. being a consumer state, kerala depends upon other states for most of the essential commodities. usually, wholesale dealers stock up goods by october-end, ahead of the christmas season, explained ernakulam broadway shop owners association (bsoa) joint secretary joseph dsilva. but traders expect prices to go up in the coming month on the basis of the cash flow and arrival of stocks from other states.however, there is a dip in demand. for instance, a retailer who used to buy 500 kg of onion before demonetisation is now buying only half of that quantity, dsilva added. another reason for the steady prices is that a major chunk of the transactions between wholesale dealers and retailers in kerala is being done through credit. the major crops produced here like coconut and pineapple and pepper have suffered a drop in its prices, said p solomon of pushpa stores, ernakulam broadway.vijayawadasales down to 20 per cents guru srikanthmarkets in vijayawada have gone into a freeze since the demonetisation of rs 1,000 and rs 500 currency notes. merchant associations say business is not even 20 per cent what it used to be at this time of the year. however, there has not been much of an impact on prices of essential commodities. only volumes have come down. with no money in the market, outstanding payments, outstanding receipts and loans have been affected. the situation has impacted sales, particularly of perishable commodities, said vakkalagadda bhaskar rao, president of vijayawada chambers of commerce and industry.in the first week after

(express photo: gopal kateshiya)at 6 am, theres still time for the auctions, but farmers have already filled a giant shed in this towns old apmc (agriculture produce market committee) yard with their fresh harvested vegetables. about half-an-hour later, a freshly shaven ghanshyam pokar, the auctioneer for shree patel group, a leading commission agency-cum-trading firm here, arrives and is immediately surrounded by buyers that include vegetable vendors. the auction, then, begins with bids as low as re 1 per kg, before settling at rs 2 for brinjal. in almost all others  cabbage, cauliflower, red/green chilli, carrot, radish, lemon, spring onion and ginger  the prices dont exceed rs 10/kg. by 8 am, when pokar has finally wound up, the entire produce in the shed has been auctioned off.bakul savaliya, a farmer from the outskirts of gondal  40 km from rajkot city and housing saurashtras, and one of gujarats, biggest apmc  doesnt hide his disappointment. the 50 kg of carrots that he brought fetched a mere rs 4 per kg. ive been coming here for the last 10 days and prices have never crossed rs 8. at these rates, can i recover anything other than my own labour of digging out the carrots, cleaning and lugging them here? asks this 34-year-old who has grown the vegetable on his 20-bigha holding (six bigha make a hectare).ramji jamod, another farmer from jamwadi, a village five km from gondal, is similarly bitter about his 15 kg of green chillies grossing just rs 150 at rs 10/kg. he has reasons to be so: it is biting cold, especially when i have to ride my bike and be here by 5 am to find enough space for unloading the produce. and at the end, what am i getting?dhiru and ashok mer with their groundnut crop. (express photo: gopal kateshiya) dhiru and ashok mer with their groundnut crop. (express photo: gopal kateshiya)jamods sole consolation is that he has started getting payment in hard cash. after notebandi  the nda governments november 8 announcement scrapping the legal tender status of rs 500 and rs 1,000 denomination currency notes  the gondal apmc was closed for a couple of days.i tried hawking the vegetables myself, but found it too time-consuming and so returned to selling through the shree patel group. they first did not pay anything for a whole week. then, they paid rs 7,000 in the old notes, of which i am still carrying rs 4,000. but for the last two weeks, they have been paying in valid currency notes, says jamod. while he attributes the fall in prices to notebandi, pokar  whose firm earns a 6 per cent commission, charged on the price paid by the buyer, on top of a 0.7 per cent apmc user charge  blames it equally on the spike in arrivals from a good crop this time.the class iii-pass jamod tills 50 bigha land taken on a three-year lease, costing rs 80,000 annually. paying it isnt an issue. my problem today is finding hard currency. the five quintals of kapas (raw unginned cotton) that i sold fetched me rs 25,625, but the entire payment was through cheque. since there was no cash, i had to borrow rs 6,000 for paying the cotton pickers. i now need labour for picking the residual groundnut pods in the soil. as im not sure when the cheque can be encashed, it looks we (wife and three children included) will have to do the job ourselves, he complains.jamod, during the kharif (post-monsoon) season, had planted groundnuts in 30 bigha, cotton in 15 bigha and vegetables  mainly chillies and val papdi (broad beans)  in his remaining five bigha. he is yet to sell his 40 quintals of harvested groundnuts, waiting for prices to improve. vegetable sales are keeping his family going for the time being.i have sold rs 25,000 worth of produce so far. but i have also been spending rs 2,500 per week on pesticides alone, apart from irrigating the standing chilly using tanker water. i have already purchased seven tanker loads, each costing rs 1,500, notes jamod. given the acute water shortage, he has even resorted to harvesting tender green chillies. the ones that are half-ripe, he is allowing to further ripen, before harvesting, sun-drying and finally taking to the market.meanwhile, in the gondal apmcs new yard, gujarats largest market for groundnut, the auctions start at 8:30 am. on monday  which saw arrivals of 16,043 bags of 35 kg each  the bids ranged from rs 3,200 to rs 4,305 per quintal. the average rate, at rs 3,700 per quintal, was well below the centres minimum support price of rs 4,220.among the 100-odd farmers waiting for their produce to go under the hammer is 35-year-old dhiru mer, who belongs to kundani village in rajkot districts jasdan taluka. although jasdan has an apmc, he prefers travelling 80 km and paying rs 2,000 to the trucker to sell at the gondal yard, where prices are better. the auctioneer hansraj sardhara declares mers two separate piles of groundnut sold at rs 3,780 and rs 4,055 per quintal. but kishor rajapara, who has placed the higher bid, is ready to pay mer rs 80,000 only through cheque. i feel bad, but we ourselves are being paid by cheque and banks are allowing us to make weekly withdraw of just rs 50,000, states this trader. mer picks out a rs 20 note from his pocket, swearing he has nothing else  not even money to buy lunch.december is the peak season for groundnut arrivals. normally, at this time, these would be one lakh bags daily, whereas we are hardly getting 15 per cent of that. only farmers with debts to clear or having special family obligations are coming to sell, admits jayantibhai s dhol, chairman of the gondal apmc.there is a dearth of buyers, too. the only ones active are the oil mills and even they arent stocking up. farmers come to me every day demanding cash. but i am unable to oblige, because theres nobody to pay me by cash. i am issuing over 50 cheques daily, while running out of leaves every second day. there are many cases of delayed clearances and even bouncing of cheques, observes haresh vadodariya, a commission agent and also a director of the apmc.the cash crunch, post-demonetisation, has also slowed down rabi (winter) season plantings. jayantibhai hadwani, who cultivates 18 bigha in navagam village of junagadh districts vanthali taluka, got 40 kg of coriander seeds from a fellow farmer, but had to spend four days in bank queues to deposit his old notes and withdraw new currency. on monday, the 50-year-olds son lined up before the state bank of indias branch at shapur, a nearby village, only to return empty-handed. hadwani himself is owed rs 15,000 by other farmers who had hired his tractor and thresher.sagar makadiya, a farmer from khadpipli village in junagadhs mendarda taluka, has harvested 34 quintals of groundnut from eight of his familys 10 bighas. he does not want to sell at the current rates, but was forced to borrow rs 5,000 to pay labourers for picking up the residual groundnut pods and prepare his field for sowing coriander. the coriander seeds and fertilisers, too, he purchased on credit. last week, makadiyas father sold three quintals of kapas from the remaining two bighas at rs 5,140 per quintal. the trader who bought issued a cheque for rs 16,000, which bounced, as the bank found that his fathers name had been spelt differently. so, makadiyas father has gone back to the trader, requesting for a fresh cheque for the same amount.the worst-hit, though, are agricultural labourers. six families from nandurbar district of maharashtra are currently camping in khadpipli. farmers here owe us over rs 8,000. we want to return home, but the pending dues are holding us back, informs sanjaya nahade, who is one of those awaiting payment from equally cash-strapped farmers.for all the latest india news, download indian express app now",MUMBAI

long is debateable. according to state horticulture department, madhya pradesh is the second highest onion producer in the country with 2.65 million tonnes (2015-16), in 1,13,754 hectares, the highest being maharashtra. across the country, onion cultivation is spread across three seasons -- kharif, late kharif and rabi.in april, prices crashed to 20 paise per kg in ratlamwhen the rabi crop hit the market in april, prices crashed to 20 paise per kg in ratlam and the situation was no better in mandsaur and neemuch, forcing the government to go in for purchase of onion at rs 6 per kg. on thursday, many farmers left their onion crop in neemuch mandi when they were offered prices around rs 1 per kg and in mandsaur irate farmers stopped the bidding process for two hours when the opening bid for onion was rs 1.50 per kg. the prices are hovering around the same level on friday also. as of now, markfed officials have ruled out any plan to purchase onions as they did in may this year.while excessive sowing by farmers in the rabi season (winter crop) was attributed as the main reason for the crash in prices in april, the kharif sowing of onion has been 12 per cent lower this year compared to 2015. kharif is the monsoon crop and at present those who had sown late are coming to the market with their produce.explaining the impact of demonetisation, a mandi official who did not want to be identified said, all the small traders who used to bring in supply from small farmers in the hinterland have vanished due to shortage of cash and big traders appeared to have formed a cartel. the small traders used to act as counter-balance. also small farmers are selling their produce at their nearest smaller mandi where prices are always 20 to 30 per cent less than bigger mandis. due to swift communication in this technological age, the big traders are sourcing their produce from smaller mandis, which is leading to pressure on prices in the bigger mandis.most traders prefer cash for which they do not pay taxeslack of cash has meant more cashless transaction which can come under the scrutiny of the taxman. the same mandi board official said, most traders prefer cash for which they do not pay taxes, but now with cheque payment not only do they have to pay 7 per cent to 8 per cent tax, if they increase their turnover too much, they will invite attention of the tax authorities, so they are limiting their purchase.mp kisan ayog president bansilal gujar admits that demonetisation has had some effect on the prices, but he also attributes other factors too. overall there is shortage of cash and while earlier one trader used to lend cash to another trader for the day (on a day when huge quantity of grains come to the market, the grain trader used to take money from say the onion trader) but this practice has come to a halt as there is not enough cash, gujar says. he also attributes lack of communication between government department officials and farmers on what they should sow and how much. he also blames herd mentality of the farmers of sowing whatever his neighbour is doing for the problems.mp horticulture director satyanand said that local factors at the mandi could be responsible for the crash in prices of onion in mandsaur-neemuch as there is no spike in supply during this time of year. the rabi crop will arrive from february 2017, he said.state has increased storage capacity of onions by almost 50%satyanand said that after rabi glut the state has increased storage capacity of onions by almost 50 percent, but in neemuch and mandsaur they are yet to meet the target. onions have to be stored in special storehouses and not in cold storages. last year we have 80,000 store houses in the state, now it has increased to 1,20,000, with capacity ranging from 25 tonnes to 50 tonnes.local mandi authorities in neemuch and mandsaur were unwilling to come on record for the reason behind the crash in prices. neemuch mandi secretary r s baghe said, i do not want to comment on this matter.farmer woesfarmer ramnarayan said that he was planning to buy a water pump from the proceeds of the onion crop, but when i reached here i came to know that the prices have crashed to re 1 per kg.farmer lalaram bhatt of diken village was in tears after hearing the news of crash in onion prices. we are already facing cash shortage problems due to demonetization and this crash in onion prices is a double blow. at these prices, we wont be able to pay even for transport, he said.farmer prem patidar said that input cost for producing onion crop on one bigha land is about rs 20,000. the production from one bigha is about 5,000 quintal and today we are getting rs 5,000 for this crop.markfed bought 10.4 lakh quintal of onionsafter onion prices crashed in april 2016, the madhya pradesh marketing cooperative federation bought 10.4 lakh quintal of onions. it sold 1.46 lakh quintal of onions at pds shops while 7.52 lakh quintals of onions were damaged. the government spent an additional rs 90 a quintal to dispose the rotten onions, according to a markfed official",MUMBAI

""good quality turmeric coming in from mysore is still selling at rs 8,500 and rs 8,700 a quintal in erode market,"" says general secretary of the federation of all trade and industries' association, erode, v k rajamanickam.""however, the prices are dropping in most markets because they are being flooded with stored turmeric harvested as long as two years ago. their quality is not good,"" he said.the turmeric harvest season in the western region, especially in erode which is considered as one of the largest turmeric producing districts in the country, begins immediately post-pongal. however, this year due to the drought that prevailed throughout 2016, the harvest was postponed by most farmers.""there are a lot of farmers who despite the drought sowed turmeric in at least half their land. but they are unable to harvest it because the crop has not even matured and has even begun drying up. so they can't cut it,"" says raja manickam. ""the yield is very low,"" he adds.agriculture marketing experts believe that the drop in cultivation and yield of turmeric in erode will lead to the turmeric yield in andhra pradesh and maharashtra setting the price trend for the spice.""usually the yield and prices in erode set the trend for turmeric pricing across the country, but this year since the rain was better in maharashtra and central india leading to their yield being better, they would become the bigger market players. their produce will even start flowing into western region markets,"" says rajamanickam.on the other hand, shoppers saw the prices of both small and big onions go up by almost 30%.

(representational image) traders said the shortage of supply was likely to continue till the first month of the next year. (representational image)as the price of onions witnessed a steep hike in retail markets across the city this week, traders attributed it to a shortage of supply of the vegetable to the pune agriculture produce marketing committee (apmc). in one week, the prices have risen from rs 20 per kilogram to rs 38 and 40. as per the traders, the price of the commodity is expected to remain high for at least a month, as the supply to the market has dried up. this, the traders said, was because the ongoing showers were creating issues in harvest of the kharif crops.vilas bhujbal, a trader at market yard, said, the markets should have received kharif crops by now but because of the ongoing showers theres difficulty in harvesting the crops. the stocks from rabi crops have already dried up. hence, the supply to the market is going down with every passing day. he added that the price of onions in wholesale market at pune apmc range from rs 2,000 to 2,200 per quintal this week. if this continues, the retail rates may even touch rs 50 by the end of this month, he said.traders said the shortage of supply was likely to continue till the first month of the next year. damage of the onion crop is not restricted to maharashtra, a similar situation is prevailing in neighbouring karnataka, they added. changdeo holkar, former director of the national agriculture marketing co-operative federation, said, in some of the districts, as much as 60 per cent crop has been damaged due to untimely rainfall. farmers whose crops survived may get a great return this time. that is, if the government doesnt intervene.for all the latest pune news, download indian express app",DHARWAD

(file photo) one of the prime reasons behind high volatility in onion prices stems from a lack of storage facilities that have not kept pace with rising production. (file photo)onions are, once again, in the news. last week, retail prices touched rs 50/kg in several markets, and wholesale prices touched rs 30/kg in major onion markets like lasalgaon in maharashtra. this is not the first time that onion prices have spiked. almost every alternate year, this roller-coaster of boom and bust in onion prices happens (see graph). but 2017 is interesting as it saw record low prices in may-june when farmers sold onions at around rs 2/kg in several mandis in madhya pradesh. this has led to grief and anger among farmers.the situation became precarious when farmers protested and police fired at them, resulting in some unfortunate deaths. the mp chief minister realised the sensitivity of the incident and quickly announced a decision to procure onions at rs 800/quintal and state agencies procured 8.76 lakh tonnes. but in the absence of ample storage capacity in the state, onions had to be quickly disposed of through the pds and open market operations at almost one-fifth the cost. the whole operation caused a loss of rs 785 crore to the mp government.however, the more unusual aspect of the onion situation was that only a few months later, in august 2017, prices started shooting up (see graph) resulting in a visit by officers of the union ministry of consumer affairs to lasalgaon, income tax raids on traders in september and the suspension of trading in lasalgaon apmc for about a month. the prices then fell for some time but they have been rising since diwali, prompting the government to announce the import of onions by the mmtc to bring down domestic prices.this is not the first year when government action has been so ad-hoc and puzzling within a few months. in previous years, too, we have seen the government fix the minimum export price, ban exports of onions, and even a study by the competition commission of india. the lesson: income tax raids proved futile in keeping the lid on onion prices even for a few months. we need better policies.so, what is it that causes high volatility in onion prices and what could be the way out? in order to respond to these questions, one may first note that india produced 21.7 mmt of onions, which is about 20 per cent of global production in 2016-17, second only to china. india also exported 2.4 mmt in 2016-17, up from 1.2 mmt in 2014-15. about 60 per cent of onion production is in the rabi season, sown in december-january and harvested in april-may. this is the onion which is stored by farmers and traders and it meets export as well as domestic demand till the arrival of the kharif onion crop, which is sown in may-june and harvested in october-november. the late kharif crop is sown in august-september and harvested in january-february. kharif and late kharif crops produce about 20 per cent each of the annual production. kharif onion is of rather poor quality and cannot be stored for very long. the prices tend to rise in october-november when rabi onion stocks are almost depleted and kharif onion is yet to hit the market, or if the kharif crop is damaged, as is the case this year.one of the prime reasons behind high volatility in onion prices stems from a lack of storage facilities that have not kept pace with rising production. also, the traditional storage practices incur losses as high as 40 per cent. while maharashtra used the rashtriya krishi vikas yojana and national horticulture mission and created 42,282 low-cost onion storage structures with a capacity of 9.65 lakh tonnes, there is hardly any storage facility in mp. no wonder, mp farmers suffered most in a bumper onion crop year. however, modern cold storages, as being set up by allround india, a subsidiary of allround holland, and other such companies, can bring down wastage within the 10-15 per cent range.so, the first policy action has to be to promote modern cold storages and develop a system akin to that of the warehouse receipt system for farmers. while a bulk of the storage has to be undertaken by the private sector, the state can do some stocking under a price stabilisation fund. they can hire the services of specialised private sector agencies to carry out such operations on the governments behalf.second, use trade policy for price stabilisation. in case of a bumper crop, promote exports and in case of a deficit crop, encourage imports. this has to be done well in advance  as soon as one comes to know the advance estimates of production.third, encourage the setting up of onion dehydrating units and promote demand for dehydrated onions amongst large consumers (restaurants, fast food chains, army, hospitals, etc). gujarat has already emerged as the main centre for dehydration units with 85 out of 100 units located there, while maharashtra has just five units. dehydrated onions are being exported to japan, europe, russia, us and some african countries. the ministry of food processing and state governments can encourage entrepreneurs to avail grants for setting up onion dehydration and processing units. a subsidy of up to 35 per cent with a cap of rs 5 crore is available to such units. however, the budget of the ministry of food processing for this scheme is just rs 95 crore. and mp, in its budget for 2017-18, has provided just rs 7 crore as grants to food processing units. this needs to go up manifold if we are serious about encouraging food processing and stabilising prices even of fresh onions.thus, instead of raiding traders or banning exports et al, the centre and the states would do better if they promote investment in scientific storage and processing facilities, and use trade policy more judiciously.for all the latest opinion news, download indian express app",MUMBAI

in order to respond to these questions, one may first note that india produced 21.7 mmt of onions, which is about 20 per cent of global production in 2016-17, second only to china. india also exported 2.4 mmt in 2016-17, up from 1.2 mmt in 2014-15. about 60 per cent of onion production is in the rabi season, sown in december-january and harvested in april-may. this is the onion which is stored by farmers and traders and it meets export as well as domestic demand till the arrival of the kharif onion crop, which is sown in may-june and harvested in october-november. the late kharif crop is sown in august-september and harvested in january-february. kharif and late kharif crops produce about 20 per cent each of the annual production. kharif onion is of rather poor quality and cannot be stored for very long. the prices tend to rise in october-november when rabi onion stocks are almost depleted and kharif onion is yet to hit the market, or if the kharif crop is damaged, as is the case this year.one of the prime reasons behind high volatility in onion prices stems from a lack of storage facilities that have not kept pace with rising production. also, the traditional storage practices incur losses as high as 40 per cent. while maharashtra used the rashtriya krishi vikas yojana and national horticulture mission and created 42,282 low-cost onion storage structures with a capacity of 9.65 lakh tonnes, there is hardly any storage facility in mp. no wonder, mp farmers suffered most in a bumper onion crop year. however, modern cold storages, as being set up by allround india, a subsidiary of allround holland, and other such companies, can bring down wastage within the 10-15 per cent range.so, the first policy action has to be to promote modern cold storages and develop a system akin to that of the warehouse receipt system for farmers. while a bulk of the storage has to be undertaken by the private sector, the state can do some stocking under a price stabilisation fund. they can hire the services of specialised private sector agencies to carry out such operations on the governments behalf.second, use trade policy for price stabilisation. in case of a bumper crop, promote exports and in case of a deficit crop, encourage imports. this has to be done well in advance  as soon as one comes to know the advance estimates of production.third, encourage the setting up of onion dehydrating units and promote demand for dehydrated onions amongst large consumers (restaurants, fast food chains, army, hospitals, etc). gujarat has already emerged as the main centre for dehydration units with 85 out of 100 units located there, while maharashtra has just five units. dehydrated onions are being exported to japan, europe, russia, us and some african countries. the ministry of food processing and state governments can encourage entrepreneurs to avail grants for setting up onion dehydration and processing units. a subsidy of up to 35 per cent with a cap of rs 5 crore is available to such units. however, the budget of the ministry of food processing for this scheme is just rs 95 crore. and mp, in its budget for 2017-18, has provided just rs 7 crore as grants to food processing units. this needs to go up manifold if we are serious about encouraging food processing and stabilising prices even of fresh onions.thus, instead of raiding traders or banning exports et al, the centre and the states would do better if they promote investment in scientific storage and processing facilities, and use trade policy more judiciously.for all the latest opinion news, download indian express app",MUMBAI

(express photo by arul horizon)the central government has announced a 5 per cent incentive on onion exports to boost the roots flagging prices, said pasha patel, chairman of the state governments committee for agricultural prices. patel said he had met union minister of commerce suresh prabhu to discuss the matter. the minister has agreed to extend 5 per cent incentive for onion under the merchandise export from india scheme, patel told the indian express on thursday.onion prices have crashed in the wholesale markets of maharashtra due to the bumper crop in the state. this year, maharashtra reported plantation of over 3.5 lakh hectares of land, instead of the usual 3 lakh hectares. the increased arrival has subdued the price of onions, which are trading at rs 6-7 per kg in mandis. the price drop comes after an eight month bull run for the bulb in wholesale markets. from june last year till early march, average prices of the bulb hovered between rs 25 per kg and 30 per kg.the price rise was mainly due to the drought in karnataka, which had resulted in the failure of karnatakas rabi crop last year. rabi or summer onion is planted late december and harvested post march-april. this onion is the only one which is amenable for storage and feeds the market from april till september before the arrival of kharif onions. farmers in maharashtra store these onions moisture proof storage structures called kanda chawls and offload them when prices are right.last year, due to the scarcity of onions, prices were high. the government took several steps to reduce the prices, such as importing at least 20,000 tonnes of onion while income tax officials raided the premises of seven traders who were allegedly storing onions. also, the minimum export price (mep), which was kept at zero since december 2015, was raised to $850 per tonne. between april 2017 and february 2018, the country had seen exports of 21,35,421.57 tonnes of the bulb  a record high.since march, onion prices have been on the wane as arrival has increased in wholesale markets. the governments decision to free exports by removing the mep slab in february had failed to boost the market sentiments. similarly, the decision of nafed to wade in the market and procure 25,000 tonnes of the bulb at maharashtras lasalgoan mandi had failed to firm up the prices. it is expected that the price of the bulb will increase in the days to come. agri-commodity analyst dipak chavan also welcomed the move, saying this will be beneficial for domestic markets. our currency is at an all time low, so this incentive will have a positive effect on the markets and firm up the prices, he said.for all the latest pune news, download indian express app",BENGALURU

Traders believe that until the fresh crops from Maharashtra arrives in the month of late December or early January,,0.9204699355351912,ONION,2019-11-04,Normal,Normal,BELGAUM,2.172440000352768,9.0,2019-09-24,Anomaly,2019-09-22,KARNATAKA," there will be no respite for buyers.the reason for the prices to skyrocket is due to various factors, say onion wholesale dealers. usually, this is the time that the prices of onions rise as there is non-availability of fresh crops. this phase is usually for a brief period but now with the non-availability of nashik onions which was hit due to floods, all eyes will be on the fresh crops, which are expected during the month of december or january next year, following which the prices are likely to stabilize, said the trader.abdul khader, secretary of koyambedu vegetable wholesale merchants association, said the price of onions will be determined, based on the availability of the crop.yesterday, the availability was less and price was on the rise. on monday, there was a huge availability of andhra onions at koyambedu wholesale market, which has low shelf life. usually, andhra onions are considered to be cheaper when compared to onions from karnataka and maharashtra. it was priced less than `20 a couple of weeks ago. yesterday, it shot up to `50 per kg. now the price has come down to `45 per kg due to more trucks coming from andhra, said khader.an onion trader told express that once the andhra season ends, the traders will depend on bangalore onions or onions from maharashtra, which is facing a crisis due to damage of crops during the rain. as a result, the prices are expected to go up further as there will be demand for bangalore onions, the trader said.he said the cost of bangalore onions in the north is rising due to infrastructure costs involved in supply of onions. onions in delhi are costing above `70. the shelf life of bangalore onion is also less when compared to maharashtra onions, that could last for more than a month. now it all depends on the availability of the crop. till then, the favourite onion sambar is likely to be a costly affair for tamilians, he said.

The reason: this festive season,,0.9428143463876588,ONION,2019-11-11,Normal,Normal,BELGAUM,2.1938787482847024,9.0,2019-10-05,Anomaly,2019-09-29,KARNATAKA," a kg of garlic costs rs 232, while peeled garlic costs rs 267 per kg. horticultural producers cooperative marketing and processing society (hopcoms) officials said that while good quality garlic is usually quite expensive, now, even low-quality garlic is no less than rs 120 per kg.b n prasad, md, hopcoms, told tnie the price of garlic has been steadily increasing in the last one-and-a-half months. even the price of onion did not rise this much. earlier, in bengaluru, the price never crossed rs 80 in the retail market, he said.the costs of some kitchen staples, such as onion, garlic and ginger, have been on the higher side of late. however, the prices of both potatoes and tomatoes are stable now. according to hopcoms, a kg of onion costs rs 54, potato rs 29, ginger rs 200 and tomato rs 34.prasad said that garlic is not grown much in karnataka, and is imported from madhya pradesh. he also added that the price of onions, which was high till the end of september, has now started to drop. this is because onions are grown in karnataka, and the price will only drop further in the coming days. to ensure that potato prices are stable, potatoes coming in from agra are being stored in cold storage units, and its the hassan crops that are being released in the market.in the case of other vegetables, hopcoms said that in general, prices are on the higher side for the last two weeks or so, and have not come down yet. officials maintained that the price rise has nothing to do with the festival season, as it is assumed, but actually due to continuous rainfall.unprecedented rainfall in maharashtra, north karnataka and in the outskirts of bengaluru (ramanagara, anekal, chikkaballapur, doddaballapur and other areas) is the reason behind the price rise, prasad said.ashraf u f, a vegetable vendor in indiranagar, said that during festival season, vendors tend to make a little more profit.vegetables are a daily necessity, and during festive season, prices hike by about rs 5 or rs 10. though it is not a big amount, it is sufficient for us, he said.beulah amma, another vegetable vendor at halasuru market, said that she has been getting 30-50 customers per day for the past one week, and has been able to make enough money to get through the festival season.we make a profit of rs 100-rs 200 per day during the festival season, unlike other days. however, this year, since it has been raining, we have also lost a few customers, as they prefer to shop in big retail shops, she said.

and green grocers, their cars and two-wheelers crowding narrow streets in some suburbs and crowding stores selling everyday staples.while the maharashtra governments lockdown order in force prohibits more than five persons gathering in public places, shops in residential areas saw scores of panicked mumbaikars jostling or queuing up to stock up on essentials, including foodgrain, snacks, milk, eggs, bread and cleaning materials.the daylong hush across residential areas, as mumbai began its total lockdown on tuesday, ended even before prime minister narendra modis speech ended.first, two-wheelers and then cars headed out of housing societies, honking. as people stood outside stores, policemen used their batons to enforce the ban on gatherings. i had to return home empty-handed because some policemen were beating people ahead of us, said pooja gala, a working professional who went with her father to a grocery near the bhayander police station. the road was barricaded but people were forcing their way through, resulting in police using their lathis. one woman was hit, gala said.in andheri (west), a large crowd jostled outside a vegetable market, most preparing to stock potatoes, onions and tomatoes, some hoping to get enough for 21 days. not more than a handful wore masks, and none followed the social distancing norms. the pm has said there is complete shutdown for 21 days. this will mean we cannot venture out of our homes at all, right? said one woman in the queue. it is better to stock up, even if it means standing in a long queue now.people stood shoulder to shoulder, with barely a few inches between them, outside general stores, vegetable carts and chemist shops.in juhu, a vegetable cart was surrounded by at least 20 people, everybody trying to grab the days last remaining vegetables. to add to the confusion, police patrol vehicles and policemen on duty asked people to go home, leading to chaos and more jostling.a hawker, fearing the police, tried to take his cart away even as many chased after him, the police in pursuit. i need to stock up and run home or the police will beat me up, said a middle-aged woman, waiting for change from the hawker.a local resident, ali raza, said theyd been trying to explain to residents that the shutdown would continue for mumbai exactly as it had been on tuesday, but but the declaration of a 21-day announcement had sharpened peoples fears. even if essential commodity shops stay open the panic buying and hoarding will mean no stock will be available for some days. better safe than sorry, so im in queue to purchase eatables, he told the indian express.a policewoman in lokhandwala township, kandivali, said the crowds grew at stores even before the pms speech ended. they just ran down as soon as pm said

company, spent an hour in queues outside grocery stores in lokhandwala township. she said, we though it is a complete lockdown and we need to stock up. if it had been made clear that grocery shops would function, there wouldnt have been such panic buying. this is absolutely crazy.a senior police officer in the western suburbs agreed that they were taken by surprise by the panic buying. its a big health hazard and hence, we have told policemen to ensure that there is no crowing at some spots, the police also baton-charged the people and asked vegetable vendors to shut down. however, once the policemen left, the crowds assembled again, the officer said.in khar east, as people formed a long queue outside a grocery store where several products were out of sock and some were being sold for over the printed mrp, policemen tried to stop people from standing in a huddled queue, to no avail. some shoppers were whacked on their legs with police batons. outside a store in kandivli (east), policemen tried to make announcements assuring people that essential goods shops would remain open and that the pms order did not in effect change any lockdown conditions for mumbaikars. those in the queue pressed on.near phoneix marketcity in kurla, a vegetable vendor was already closing for the day, every item sold out except spinach. outside the kohinoor city housing society nearby, within minutes of the pms speech ending, people queued up outside a shop selling snacks, chocolates, cold drinks, mineral water, processed food and pre-made packaged food. the store was already running low on supplies, but people waited nevertheless to get whatever was available.in andheri (east) and vile parle (east) too, people rushed in large numbers to grocery shops and medical stores. several youngsters lined up outside a flour mill selling wheat-meal. we had stocked up for three to four days, but there is a lockdown for another 21 days so we are unsure if essentials will be available tomorrow onwards, said a 19-year-old student. he was also helping other senior citizens to stock up essentials.here too, police personnel were seen making announcements on a loudspeaker requesting people to disperse and that essential goods would continue to be available, but with little success.it was more of the same scenes at champion supermarket in tilak nagar, where a long queue of people waited to buy groceries and vegetables. the store allowed only four persons inside at a time, but the queue kept growing outside. the lockdown also led to people queuing up outside atms.in kharghar, navi mumbai, around 20 to 25 people stood in queue outside the dinesh supermarket near the valley shilp housing complex. the stores have had low stocks for several days, and now with a 21-day shutdown

and green grocers, their cars and two-wheelers crowding narrow streets in some suburbs and crowding stores selling everyday staples.while the maharashtra governments lockdown order in force prohibits more than five persons gathering in public places, shops in residential areas saw scores of panicked mumbaikars jostling or queuing up to stock up on essentials, including foodgrain, snacks, milk, eggs, bread and cleaning materials.the daylong hush across residential areas, as mumbai began its total lockdown on tuesday, ended even before prime minister narendra modis speech ended.first, two-wheelers and then cars headed out of housing societies, honking. as people stood outside stores, policemen used their batons to enforce the ban on gatherings. i had to return home empty-handed because some policemen were beating people ahead of us, said pooja gala, a working professional who went with her father to a grocery near the bhayander police station. the road was barricaded but people were forcing their way through, resulting in police using their lathis. one woman was hit, gala said.in andheri (west), a large crowd jostled outside a vegetable market, most preparing to stock potatoes, onions and tomatoes, some hoping to get enough for 21 days. not more than a handful wore masks, and none followed the social distancing norms. the pm has said there is complete shutdown for 21 days. this will mean we cannot venture out of our homes at all, right? said one woman in the queue. it is better to stock up, even if it means standing in a long queue now.people stood shoulder to shoulder, with barely a few inches between them, outside general stores, vegetable carts and chemist shops.in juhu, a vegetable cart was surrounded by at least 20 people, everybody trying to grab the days last remaining vegetables. to add to the confusion, police patrol vehicles and policemen on duty asked people to go home, leading to chaos and more jostling.a hawker, fearing the police, tried to take his cart away even as many chased after him, the police in pursuit. i need to stock up and run home or the police will beat me up, said a middle-aged woman, waiting for change from the hawker.a local resident, ali raza, said theyd been trying to explain to residents that the shutdown would continue for mumbai exactly as it had been on tuesday, but but the declaration of a 21-day announcement had sharpened peoples fears. even if essential commodity shops stay open the panic buying and hoarding will mean no stock will be available for some days. better safe than sorry, so im in queue to purchase eatables, he told the indian express.a policewoman in lokhandwala township, kandivali, said the crowds grew at stores even before the pms speech ended. they just ran down as soon as pm said lockdown. there was no space for cars to move. now, we are telling people that essential services will be available and they should go home, she said.vijila kurup, sales head at an advertising company, spent an hour in queues outside grocery stores in lokhandwala township. she said, we though it is a complete lockdown and we need to stock up. if it had been made clear that grocery shops would function, there wouldnt have been such panic buying. this is absolutely crazy.a senior police officer in the western suburbs agreed that they were taken by surprise by the panic buying. its a big health hazard and hence, we have told policemen to ensure that there is no crowing at some spots, the police also baton-charged the people and asked vegetable vendors to shut down. however, once the policemen left, the crowds assembled again, the officer said.in khar east, as people formed a long queue outside a grocery store where several products were out of sock and some were being sold for over the printed mrp, policemen tried to stop people from standing in a huddled queue, to no avail. some shoppers were whacked on their legs with police batons. outside a store in kandivli (east), policemen tried to make announcements assuring people that essential goods shops would remain open and that the pms order did not in effect change any lockdown conditions for mumbaikars. those in the queue pressed on.near phoneix marketcity in kurla, a vegetable vendor was already closing for the day, every item sold out except spinach. outside the kohinoor city housing society nearby, within minutes of the pms speech ending, people queued up outside a shop selling snacks, chocolates, cold drinks, mineral water, processed food and pre-made packaged food. the store was already running low on supplies, but people waited nevertheless to get whatever was available.in andheri (east) and vile parle (east) too, people rushed in large numbers to grocery shops and medical stores. several youngsters lined up outside a flour mill selling wheat-meal. we had stocked up for three to four days, but there is a lockdown for another 21 days so we are unsure if essentials will be available tomorrow onwards, said a 19-year-old student. he was also helping other senior citizens to stock up essentials.here too, police personnel were seen making announcements on a loudspeaker requesting people to disperse and that essential goods would continue to be available, but with little success.it was more of the same scenes at champion supermarket in tilak nagar, where a long queue of people waited to buy groceries and vegetables. the store allowed only four persons inside at a time, but the queue kept growing outside. the lockdown also led to people queuing up outside atms.in kharghar, navi mumbai, around 20 to 25 people stood in queue outside the dinesh supermarket near the valley shilp housing complex. the stores have had low stocks for several days, and now with a 21-day shutdown there is no guarantee when stocks will be available. were buying for two weeks at least, said gajanan chavan, a resident.even if a complete lockdown has been ordered, the state is committed to ensure that there is no shortage of essential commodities. we urge the people to cooperate with the government, konkan divisional commissioner shivaji daund said.a statement released by the state administration, while asking people not to panic, said the government was taking steps to ensure that adequate and continuous supply of essentials like foodgrains, vegetables, milk, bread and medicines was maintained.congress mla donates 2 months salary to cms relief fundmumbai: congress mla from bandra east zeeshan siddique has decided to donate two months of his salary to the chief ministers relief fund for the fight against coronavirus. an mla gets a monthly salary of rs 2,31,873. siddique is hoping that his fellow colleagues, too, will donate their salary. i distributed 30,000

(b) disruptions in the collection of harvests from the farms by traders; (c) shortage of workers to harvest the rabi crops; (d) shortage of truck drivers; (e) blockades in the transport of commodities; (f) limited operations of apmc mandis; and (g) shutdowns in the retail markets.second, these supply bottlenecks have led to a fall in farmgate prices. according to media reports, tomato growers in maharashtra were receiving only 2 per kg. wheat prices in madhya pradesh fell from 2200/q to about 1,600/q. in punjab, vegetable prices fell from 15/kg to 1/kg. in delhi, the price of broiler chicken fell from 55/kg in january to 24/kg in march. in tamil nadu, egg prices fell from 4/egg in january to 1.95/egg in march.third, the large-scale return of migrant workers to their homes has disrupted harvest operations, and farmers are being forced to leave the crop in the fields. while mechanical harvesters can be used, there is a shortage of drivers/operators. most rice mills work with migrant workers, and their return home has meant that these mills are not buying paddy from farmers. there are also severe labour shortages in milk processing plants, cold storage units and warehouses.fourth, supply chains remain disrupted across india. agricultural goods have been notified as essential goods. but about 5,00,000 trucks are reportedly stranded in the highways and state borders. milk trucks are able to unload at the destination but unable to return empty, which has upset supply schedules. trucks are in shortage as drivers have gone home. imports of vegetable oils are not being lifted from ports due to shortage of trucks. most apmc mandis are functioning only twice or thrice a week. livestock feeds are in short supply, and this is breaking the back of livestock growers.the world and india have adequate food stocks. but as global trade shrinks and supply disruptions persist, a prolonged lockdown will adversely affect food security in many countries. in the western world, food prices are rising due to panic buying and stockpiling. food prices are not yet rising in india. what has kept indian food prices low is the severe decline in food consumption, especially among the poor, after the lockdown. that is, hunger may keep the food inflation in march 2020 low. concurrently, farmers face acute labour shortages, falling farmgate prices and lack of access to input/output markets. it is unclear who is benefiting, but farmers, workers and the poor are at their wits end.r. ramakumar is nabard chair professor at the tata institute of social sciences, mumbai",MUMBAI

(representational)after a brief period of stability, onion prices across wholesale markets in maharashtra have started rising again, and market sources say the trend will continue till the new crop arrives in early november.traders attribute the rise in prices to a disruption in the supply chain, caused by heavy rain in the last week of august, which affected the quality of stored onions in madhya pradesh and gujarat.this supply crunch comes even as the country has reported 9.90 lakh hectares of onion acreage for the 2019-2020 rabi season, as against 7.70 lakh hectares in the 2018-2019 rabi season.onion prices had started the year on a high note, as excess rain had caused extensive damage to market-ready crops in maharashtra, madhya pradesh and other onion-growing states. at lasalgaons wholesale market in nashik districts niphad taluka, average prices were in the range of rs 4,500-5,500 per quintal, which cooled down considerably after the new crop arrived in march.following a bumper kharif, harvest prices stumbled to rs 1,498 per quintal in march, which further corrected to rs 730 per quintal by july. wholesale prices of the kitchen staple firmed up to rs 1,00 per quintal in august, which further increased to rs 1,968 in september.explaining the present trend, suresh deshmukh, an onion commission agent, who operates at nashiks dindori wholesale market, said this was mostly due to the destruction of poor-quality stored onions in madhya pradesh and gujarat. heavy rain in august has led to moisture ingress in stored onions and their quality has deteriorated. even in nashik, farmers have reported moisture damage to their stored onions, said deshmukh.nearly 80-85 per cent of the produce was of below average quality, and prices have been increased to attract better-quality stored onions. while a bumper crop had subdued the markets post march, this rain-induced damage has again hiked the prices, said deshmukh.heavy rain has also affected standing crops in nashik and other onion-growing regions, said jaydutt holkar, chairman of lasalgaons wholesale market. we feel the new crop will also be affected and the present price trend can continue for quite some time, he said.how onions are storedonion growers tend to store their winter or rabi crop in on-field dust-proof and moisture-proof structures called kanda chawl to prevent the growth of green shoots. this stored onion forms the supply chain to markets till the kharif crop arrives in early november. the indian express is now on telegram. click here to join our channel (@indianexpress) and stay updated with the latest headlinesfor all the latest pune news, download indian express app.",MUMBAI
