The leguminous pulse crop has been successfully raised by Mahima, a group of 15 women, engaged in works under the Mahatma Gandhi Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme, in Ward 15 of Cheriyanad grama panchayat in Chengannur.On four centsThe group took 90 cents of land on lease for group farming and cultivated tapioca, elephant foot yam, colocasia, and green gram. The women took up black gram cultivation on a trial basis on four cents of land and found it successful. The harvest was made after one and half months of sowing. Encouraged by the short harvesting period and good returns, they have raised a second crop and are awaiting harvest.Black gram is generally cultivated in States such as Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh. The higher market value of the crop could be reason enough to expand the area under black gram cultivation, according to farm experts."
58f1df51a3d24b245e59d5ec,Telangana at risk as food production records steep fall,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/Telangana-at-risk-as-food-production-records-steep-fall/articleshow/51002995.cms,2016-02-16,"HYDERABAD: Alarm bells are ringing in Telangana where agriculture production has reported a steep fall for the fourth consecutive season this year.According to the report on agriculture by the Telangana Directorate of Economics and Statistics, production of food, especially rice, has been on the decline. In fact, till a few years ago Telangana was the leader in south India in rice production but the situation has now been reversed, if not turned grim.Agriculture started getting affected from the Kharif season in 2014, which saw deficit rainfall and a steadily plummeting ground water table. Added to this was the dismal power supply situation in rural Telangana. With these factors getting worse over time, farmers recorded huge losses in the Kharif and Rabi seasons in 2014-15 and 2015-16.""Even the total cultivated zone has come down drastically. Due to the dwindling ground water table, farmers now require even more electricity to lift water from borewells, but that is not readily available,"" pointed out a senior official.A look at the total food output underlines the gravity of the situation. Whereas the Kharif season of 2013-14 saw the production of 65.28 lakh tonnes of foodgrains, it fell to 44.72 lakh tonnes in 2014-15. This is a steep fall of 31.5 per cent. The decrease was attributed to lesser area under cultivation and an overall decrease in yield of paddy, maize, red gram and green gram crops.The case was similar with the Rabi season. While in 2013-14, the season saw 41.58 lakh tonnes of foodgrains being produced, it fell to 27.46 lakh tonnes the next year, a fall of 33.96 per cent.The worst hit of them all was paddy cultivation, which had earlier thrived due to the introduction of free power to the farm sector. Overall paddy cultivation fell from 65.81 lakh tonnes in 2013-14 to 45.45 lakh tonnes in 2014-15. An expected further fall in production has stoked fears of steep rise of rice prices in 2016-17. Crops such as maize, jowar, wheat, bajra and ragi too have reported a decline.Troubled farmer associations are now pleading the government to save distressed farmers. ""The state government did not announce drought in 2014-15 though the situation was bad, with nine out of the 10 districts of Telangana reporting more than 20 per cent deficit rainfall and drastic drop in the groundwater table. This year, the government has announced drought, but it is too late,"" said Kirankumar of Rythu Swarajya Vedika. The NGO has done extensive studies on the impact of drought on tenant farmers in Telangana and the reasons behind farmer suicides."
5904ea097be9e04154dfda83,"Farmer suicides is no fashion trend, Mr Gopal Shetty",http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/minorityview/farmer-suicides-is-no-fashion-trend-mr-gopal-shetty/,2016-02-18,"The BJP Member of Parliament from Maharashtra Gopal Shettys statement that it has become a fashion among farmers to commit suicide is ignoble. It not only points to an utter lack of sensitiveness to the plight of the farmers but also points to the ignorance of the difficult conditions in which farmers operate with hardly any infrastructure or help from the government. A cursory glance of the most recent report of the NSSO on Some Aspects of Farming in India brought out earlier this week will most certainly enlighten the honourable BJP MP in this regard.According to the report, which surveyed farmers for the two periods July to December 2012 and January to June 2013, the average cropped area of an Indian farmer was less than one hectare. While the average value of total crop production per agriculture household was Rs 40, 580 in the second part of the year which includes the khariff crop it was at a still lower Rs 36,696 in the first half of the year which included the rabi season. This is a far cry from the hefty payments doled out to the government employees by the various pay commissions and often for very unproductive work.The farmer has very little access to modern inputs and was heavily dependent on the local traders and their own farm for seeds and other farm inputs. Moreover what is worse is that the survey shows that the central and state governments have not been able to spread awareness of the various government programs to help farmers including the widely used minimum support prices which is to protect the farmers from any distress sales during periods of good harvests. And even the minor segment which is aware of the minimum support prices sold their produce to procurement agencies and benefited from the program.But it is not the governments ability to inform the farmers about minimum support prices which galls the experts. More important is the government inability to provide any kind of insurance to cover for the risks the farmers take through large investments in each cropping season. While the share of agriculture households insured was in low double digits in crops like moong, groundnut, soya bean and cotton it was less than 5% in important cereals like paddy and wheat. Numbers on most major crops show that less than half the farmers were aware of crop insurance schemes and even among those aware of such schemes very few had any idea of the facilities it provided.However, the biggest default on the farm front is the governments apparent inability to provide extension service for the farmers. Less than 3% of the agriculture households who were keen on updating technologies have access to the support of krishivigyan kendras, agriculture universities or NGOs. Hardly 6% had access to services of extension agents. Similarly 7-8% of the agriculture households can avail of services of private commercial agents or veterinary departments. The largest source of agriculture households access to technical advice was progressive farmers and media like radio, television, newspaper and internet which accounted for almost a 20% share each.There is also substantial disparities in the access to technical advice for agriculture household across states. Among major states almost two third of the farmer households has access to technical advice during the khariff crop in the states of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Kerala. In contrast the access to technical advice to farmer household was the least in Jharkhand, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh where it was just around a quarter.These numbers give an idea of the innumerable hurdles that Indian farmers have to face to eke out a marginal existence on the fringes of the economy. The government inability to provide even basic facilities like extension or insurance facilities either directly or through private agencies point to bankrupt polices which has forced many a farmer to take their own life especially when input costs and cost of farming practices have soared up in recent years. Gopal Shetty, the BJP Member of Parliament from Maharashtra should try to educate himself about the sad plight of the farmers before he makes such ignoble statements about them."

Nearly 500 members of the community joined the celebrations.We have been celebrating Holi in a traditional style in this city for last 10 years. People from the Banjara community are spread across the country. Regardless of the place, we are settled in, people of our community never miss the Holi revelry, said B. Sivaram Naik, president of the State unit of the Sangh.Holi is a multi-religious, multi-faceted and largely popular festival celebrated by people of different communities in their own style.Students of colleges and schools formed independent groups and played with colours in residential localities.Boys of Syed Appalaswamy Degree College at Chittinagar, grabbed the opportunity to forge a stronger bond. After drenching one another in colours of camaraderie, they descended on the college campus to shake off the humidity impact under open showers. Students of Potti Sriramulu Chalavadi Mallikharjuna Rao College of Engineering and Technology, K.L. University and several other educational institutes were seen partaking in the festivity.Students of Lingayas Institute of Management and Technology (LIMAT) played the festival of colours, emotions and happiness on the college campus.

Agraharam for a massive get-together and drew plans for revelry.The festival-eve started on a conventional note with a visit to the temple. Newborn babies were brought to the temple for a ceremony called Dhood.In the evening, they burnt Holika, a ritual practice since ancient times. The real celebration will take place on Thursday when youngsters would be seen zooming on their bikes, painting the town in a splash of colours. We buy synthetic colours in the local market two days in advance and use them dry and with water, says Vikas Jain, a pan broker in Brodipet.Sweetmeats like moong dal seera, lapsi and wheat flakes are relished on the occasion. It used to be far more vibrant in the past. We used to have a large tub of coloured water, where men and women splashed colours at each other, recalls Mr. Jain.In Ongole, the young and the old celebrated the festival with great enthusiasm.Revellers, particularly the youth, went around town on motorcycles and exchanged wishes. Businessmen from Rajasthan, who have made Ongole their second home, indulged in merry-making on the busy Gandhi Road and Trunk Road.In Chittoor, residents along Neeva River performed special pujas at the Hanuman temple and sprinkled colours of revelry.Several families from the Rajput and Jain community celebrated the occasion with gusto. An impressive gathering of men from the Rajput community participated in Kamadhahanam at the arch of Shiva Temple on the banks of Neeva river. Orginiser Bhim Singh said the event will continue till early hours of Thursday."

58f4c07460de4776e369496f,Costly pulses hit domestic budget,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160419/jsp/odisha/story_80836.jsp,2016-04-19,"POCKET PINCH Cuttack, April 18: Dal is missing from the menu of several households as the prices of pulses have gone up in the past week across the state. Primarily, the high cost of pulses in Maharastra, Chhattisgarh, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka - from where the state procures dal - is responsible for the price hike. Besides, the state government's norms - fixing the limit of stocking pulse - have also added to the consumers' woes. The retail prices of pulses have registered a hike varying from Rs 5 to Rs 15 per kilogram. At present, arhar dal is being sold at Rs 148 to Rs 150 per kg at the retail markets. The rate of chana dal has also gone up to Rs 80 to Rs 82 per kg against the retail price of Rs 73 to Rs 78 last week. There has been no change in the retail price of moong dal, which is being sold at Rs 85 to Rs 90 per kg. But, the prices of biri dal have gone to Rs 145 per kg from Rs 120 and the rate of masoor dal stands at Rs 85 per kg while it was being sold at Rs 75 at the retail markets last week. Harapriya Samal, a working woman from Jhanjirmangala, said: ""Rice is our staple diet, and our meal is incomplete without dal. So, we are now forced to buy dal at such high rates,"" said Samal. Malgodown traders, however, put the blame on bulk procurement by several multi-national companies, who are now procuring pulses from the farmers. The state requires seven lakh metric tonnes of pulses per annum, while only 80,000 tonnes to one lakh metric tonnes are produced here. A Cuttack Chamber of Commerce official said the pulses' prices were expected to rise due to the existing curb on stocking pulses. At present, a trader is only allowed to stock 750 quintals of pulses according to the government norms. ""If the stock limit is raised, then only the prices of pulses can be kept under control at least for a month despite the high procurement rate as there will be adequate stock to meet the requirement,"" said the official. ""Various big companies are now directly procuring essential commodities from farmers, and as the prices of pulses are high at the point of purchase, there has been a gap in the supply which has pushed the prices,"" said Cuttack Chamber of Commerce joint secretary Prafula Chatoi, who said they had submitted a memorandum to the district administration demanding an increase in the stock limit for traders to 5,000 quintals. On the other hand, Cuttack collector Nirmal Chandra Mishra convened an emergency meeting to review the situation here today, and the Malgodown traders were asked to report the wholesale and retail prices on a daily basis. ""There is an adequate stock at Malgodown. We also urge the consumers not to resort to panic buying as the wholesale prices at Malgodown have been stable for the past two to three days,"" said the collector."

His one inmate is used to -2 degrees Celsius, the other to 40-degree temperatures; the biggest weighs in at 2,500 kg, the smallest is lighter than 15 gm; one calls for wheelbarrow khichdi meals, the other for kheer. 176 acres, 1,500-plus creatures, 200 workers, and mercury grazing 50. If curator Khan is getting through his 29th summer at the National Zoological Park, New Delhi, it is on the strength of over 70 large coolers, 20 kg of glucose daily, some Ayurvedic medicines, and a summer diet chart.2 elephants; 62,500 sq m areaIdeal temperature for Asian elephants: 21-28 CIts 7 am and Heera Gaj (50) and Rajalakshmi (35) have woken up to a stunning sunrise, visible over the ruins of the Delhi Old Fort. Soon the sun wont seem as pleasant, but for now the two 10-ft tall elephants are taking a leisurely stroll, ears flapping, trunks swaying, through a verdant patch. Mahaut Kuliemimboro accompanies the two largest mammals at the zoo in their morning exercise. The walk, usually an hour long, has been cut to 45 minutes because of the heat.By the time they return to the elephant enclosure, a light breakfast, of 8 kg bananas, is ready. As Kuliemimboro explains, The bananas help maintain the water balance in body and protect Heera and Rajalakshmi from heat stroke. With experience, zoo officials know that keeping the stomach light is the best trick for summer.Watch Under The 40-Degree Plus Sun, Delhi Zoo Goes Into Summer ProtocolIn cooler times, the elephants are fed bucket-loads of un-ripe amla, which is rich in Vitamin C and builds immunity.Like the other zoo supplies, bananas are delivered daily by a supplier who got the contract via a tender.The food meant for the elephants. The food meant for the elephants.Around 9 am, the elephants are led for a bath, where they are hosed down with special pressure pipes. As he ensures water washes every part of their body, Kuliemimboro says, The shower is not just to keep them cool. It is to know whether they are keeping well in the heat. Are they energetic and sprightly? Or do they appear tired? The morning shower answers these questions. It also creates trust. When they are scrubbed, they love it.While Heera appears to be enjoying his bath, Rajalakshmi stands quietly under an umbrella-shaped shelter. Kuliemimboro doesnt think there is any cause for worry. The elephants, brought to the zoo 30 years back from Kanpur, have not reported any illness this year. Originally from Assam, Kuliemimboro himself has been here only a year and earns Rs 15,000 a month.To be a keeper for elephants or the big cats, one needs to be at least Class X pass and have minimum three years of skilled experience. Kuliemimboro, who also looked after elephants back home, is a permanent employee, which means his salary is indexed to the Pay Commission and he gets Central government dearness allowance. Many of the employees, like Kuliemimboro, live in staff quarters on the premises.Satisfied all is well, Kuliemimboro next leads the elephants to a big, open sand pit where Heera and Rajalakshmi roll around in the mud, to cool their thick skin that has started heating up.Heera again seems to be having the most fun. Visitors have started trickling in by now, and as they watch him, he scrubs himself and deposits sand onto his back with his trunk.In summer, the number of sand pits is increased. The dust also guards the elephants from harmful sun rays and prevents itching, says Kuliemimboro.A diet chart for the summer has been put up in a 1010 ft room located around 500 metres away. Kuliemimboro goes by it to prepare the meal for the elephants with the help of two others.Again, in concession to the weather, it is mostly khichdi these days. About 30 kg of rice is made separately and mixed with 10 kg of moong dal and mustard oil. The cooking starts at 11 am, for the khichdi to be ready before 2 pm. It is then transferred to a special wheelbarrow-like trolley, where it is kept for cooling for three hours. Only at five, after the zoo is closed for visitors, will the meal be served, says Kuliemimboro.As evening sets in, Heera and Rajalakshmi retire to a semi-conical enclosure, open on one side. There is a partition in the middle to ensure they dont fight at night. By now the weather is cool enough for them not to need any special arrangements  making them an exception for the zoo.2 adult tigers, 4 cubs; 22,500 sq m areaIdeal temperature for white tigers: 20-35 COn September 24 last year, Vijay had grabbed headlines for mauling to death a 20-year-old man who had fallen into his enclosure. This summer, all efforts have been put in place to ensure that the 200-kg white tiger remains calm.Since the incident, Vijay, who was born at the zoo in 2008  in a case of mating the officials are proud of  has fathered four cubs. In the mornings, it is Kalpana and the cubs who are let out into the open space in the enclosure for public viewing. Once the temperature starts dipping by 2 pm, Vijay comes out. Care is taken to ensure that the cubs do not make any contact with the father.Vijay gets a morning bath in his special enclosure, which is the only one monitored with a CCTV camera. Vijay gets a morning bath in his special enclosure, which is the only one monitored with a CCTV camera.Says caretaker Yameen, Vijay can get aggressive in summer. This is to ensure that the four cubs do not get intimidated by him.His enclosure, with 20-ft high walls on three sides, is the only one in the zoo to be monitored with a CCTV camera. Besides, a private guard has been delegated at the spot from where the public views him.Four desert coolers operate round the clock in the area where he rests. On hotter days, Vijay can wade into a V-shaped artificial pond with a cement boundary. Water mixed with glucose is fed into the pool, where the tiger also drinks from, to keep him hydrated.Kalpana and the cubs stay in separate steel cages, each one with a cooler. While the female cubs are called Meeta, Neeta, Rita, the male bears a more majestic name, Tipu.Fateh Singh, 55, has been taking care of the tigers for 30 years. He says it is a skilled job, requiring special training, and that there are risks. However, working with the tigers doesnt get him any extra perks. Yameen, 27, joined Fateh recently as there are two enclosures to look after.Yameen after dropping food into the cage as Kalpana walks in. Her cubs with Vijay are in separate enclosures. Yameen after dropping food into the cage as Kalpana walks in. Her cubs with Vijay are in separate enclosures.At 12.30 pm, the tigers are served their only meal of the day. Ten kilogrammes of buffalo meat is divided and kept in each of their enclosures  2 kg less in summers than the rest of the year. I have to leave for namaz by 1.30 pm, Yameen says, adding that apart from lesser red meat, they also add white meat to the tiger meal in summers.The meat is delivered to the zoo by suppliers by 8 am everyday. At the meat house on the premises, it is segregated for different enclosures. It is then weighed and transferred into plastic buckets for transporting.P C Ray, who has been working with the zoo for 20 years, transporting the meat to the enclosures.

Naresh is not a permanent employee as yet.Outside, Kalpana and her cubs are playing in a 50-m-long pool designed for the summer. After some minutes, they sit down, only their necks visible above the water.Glucose again comes in handy. When the four come inside with their mother, we first give them glucose-mixed water in stone bowls. It is only after this that they are served the meal. They munch the meat for over four hours, Yameen says.Friday, when the zoo is shut, is one day of the week when the animals arent fed red meat.Vijay in a pond with glucose water.

However, its too hot for that law of nature to work.So, like the tigers, six-year-old Salman, who was born at the zoo, is also given glucose. Plus, its food has been rationed to 5 kg of buffalo meat daily, from 7-8 kg at other times.Apart from a cooler, a special green shade blocks the sun and provides Salman respite from the heat, while also giving the animal that is known to be very shy a feel of wilderness. Such special arrangements have also been made for jackals and hyenas  two other creatures of the night.Leopard Salman has a cooler plus a special green shade to block out sun rays. Leopard Salman has a cooler plus a special green shade to block out sun rays.The shade keeps out 75 per cent of the sun rays. You will never find a leopard in the desert, which has no green cover. This green shade helps it feel at home even during the dry summers in Delhi, says Balle Ram, who has been guarding this enclosure for over two decades.The 50-year-old is a father of two, both of whom work as daily wagers, and says he wont be happy to retire. Pointing out that he has seen at least a dozen leopards come and go, he remarks, Sirf mausam badla hai, aur kuchch nahin (Only the weather has changed, nothing else).1 sloth bear and 6 Himalayan Black Bears: 20,000 sq m areaIdeal temperature for sloth bears: 20-30 C; for Himalayan bears: -2 to 18 CHere is a wild one getting special attention these days since a fellow sloth bear, all of 6, escaped the Hyderabad Zoo a month ago. It was reportedly disturbed due to the extreme heat.Riaz Khan says they cant take things lightly with their own sloth bear now.Known to be a reclusive animal, the Delhi Zoo sloth bear lives in an enclosure where two coolers work round-the-clock. But with its thick black fur still making the Capital heat almost unbearable, their diet has to be more closely monitored than that of others.A special addition is bael, the Indian fruit known as wood apple, offered at regular intervals. The wood apple controls excessive thirst. It also has medicinal value. Outdoor cooling can contribute only a little to maintaining the heat balance of the animal. It is only through diet that one can solve the problem of heat stroke, says Khan.Apart from bael, the bear is fed cucumbers, water melons, melons, cheeku and beetroot (around 2.5 kg of food in all daily). In winter, this is changed to a lot of sweet potato and singhara.While bears are omnivores, the Delhi Zoo sloth bear is by now a vegetarian. However, notes Khan, it is given kheer, prepared in the pantry, and eggs.Not in summer though. The bread and milk content is being reduced. We have also stopped giving eggs, especially when the temperature is very high, Khan says.Apart from the tigers, Fateh Singh also takes care of the bear enclosure.The enclosure for the Himalayan Black Bears, which have a similar diet, is nearby. It has four females, but the authorities havent been able to shift the two males in. Brought from Himachal Pradesh in March for breeding, they are still in a temperature-controlled room at the zoos veterinary hospital, slowly adapting to the climate.During their first two weeks here, sources say, the Black Bears were kept at zero-degree temperature. The bears were then shifted to a cool temperature, maintained by desert coolers. Currently, they are in a room with fans. We are slowly making them adapt to Delhis climate. They are responding well and should be out by the end of August. The females (who have been in the zoo for five years) will not get to see their male counterparts this summer, a source laughed.100 antelopes; 62,500 sq m areaIdeal temperature for deer: 25-30 CIn a first for the Delhi Zoo, the deer enclosure now has a 360-degree sprinkler. It is meant for the zoos most vulnerable species, the black buck, also known as the Indian antelope.Leopard Salman has a cooler plus a special green shade to block out sun rays. Leopard Salman has a cooler plus a special green shade to block out sun rays.Black bucks usually inhabit grassy plains and slightly forested areas. So this summer a hundred new plants were planned well in advance to make the enclosure greener.Due to their vulnerability, the special sprinklers are run once every two hours till the sun sets. So the enclosure is always moist and cool. After the installation, we have not received a single complaint from this enclosure during the summers, Khan says.The deer are fed green vegetables, bengal gram, wheat, maize and oats during the summer.Despite the special arrangement, it is here that the officials have had their biggest scare this time. In the last three months, 16 spotted deer have died due to suspected rabies. The enclosure is now out of bounds, with over 30 employees who work with them also undergoing a rabies vaccination programme.30 bird species; 8 cagesIdeal temperature for the birds: 20-30 CBefore the summer arrived, the bird enclave was given a complete makeover. This year the zoo has special glasshouses with agro net green shade. Besides, pipelines have been laid throughout to ensure that the water being delivered to the cages has glucose in it.Home to exotic birds with glorious plumes, Delhi Zoo knows this is one of the favourite areas for its visitors, especially children. From the macaw, known to be extremely intelligent and curious as well as friendly, to the critically endangered Blue Edward Pheasant, Khan says, they cant be too carefully with the diet of the birds.For birds, special glasshouses, water pipelines delivering glucose. For birds, special glasshouses, water pipelines delivering glucose.The Illigers Macaw, endangered in the wild due to deforestation, feeds usually on seeds, fruits and nuts. During the summer, special apples and water melons are provided to keep them cool.For the Golden Pheasant, who usually live in small groups and are a hit as they prefer to run rather than fly, the diet is green vegetable salad, bread, chana sattu and gauva.The macaw has been provided a special wooden area near the water to give it a feel of its natural habitat. This is to ensure that they keep coming to drink water, Khan says.The curator says there is another reason he and his staff at the bird enclosure are excited this summer. The zoo is expecting eggs of at least 24 exotic birds to hatch soon. The arrival of these chicks is being monitored closely at the hospital. The Silver and Golden Pheasant have laid over a dozen eggs each, with an incubation period of 20 days.We must monitor the temperature as well as humidity levels, smiles Khan.200 employeesOver 50 of them work in the animal section, which is the lifeline of the zoo. They take care of the feed and wellbeing of the animals.Close behind is the security section, including over 20 employees, who keep in touch over wireless as they guard the different enclosures. A supervisor heads the team and monitors the CCTV cameras.The garden section has over 20 employees, responsible for greenery at the zoo. They also maintain the small vermin compost unit to meet the zoos manure requirements.It is the garden section which has the oldest employee at the zoo. Mahender Mali, who is over 60 years of age, has been keeping this part of the Capital green for years. For me, zoo is home, says Mahender. I will be retiring soon, but I wish to continue contributing.Around 4 pm, as the visitors hasten to catch their last glimpse of the animals before the zoo shuts its gates, Riaz Khan steps out of the office for his last round of checking. Over the next 30 minutes, he enquires about animals in 12 enclosures.By 6 pm, before heading home, the staff has kept food in enclosures for the nocturnal animals, including foxes and hyenas.On the eastern side, some soaked grams, fruits and vegetables have been left out in a bowl.Before long, a porcupine emerges. As the zoo quietens, it is the hour of its largest rodent to feed.Colombo to HamburgIndira Gandhi was part of an ad-hoc committee of some prominent nature lovers of Delhi, headed by the chief commissioner, which got down to giving Delhi a zoo in 1952.Major Weinmann, Director of the Ceylon Zoological Garden, Colombo, was invited to help draw up a coordinated plan for development of the park. He submitted a report along with a preliminary plan. As he was not available for continued consultations, the committee approached Carl Hagenbeck, owner of the famous Animal Park at Hamburg, West Germany, who gave the idea of the open moat enclosures. He presented a preliminary report in March 1956 and provided a general layout plan of waterways, roads and paths, animal enclosures and sewage system.The Government of India approved the final plan on December 31, 1956.Even while the final touches were being given to the zoo, state government and individuals started gifting animals. The animals, including tigers, leopards, bears, foxes, deer and birds, were initially kept in temporary enclosures around Azimganj Sarai, a courtyard built for travellers during the Mughal days.The park was formally inaugurated on November 1, 1959."

This zone comprises 36% of the total value of unsold flats in MMR. But this area has only 4% of the 1.71 lakh flats in the MMR. Till June-end, there were 6,214 unsold apartments in south central Mumbai.Mumbai topped the list with highest sales volume growth of 22.93% in the residential segment, followed by Bengaluru with a growth of 18%. Hyderabad saw an increase of 8.10%, while the Pune market remained stagnant. Samantak Das, chief economist and national director of Knight Frank India, said, ""South central Mumbai (Parel, Worli, Nepean Sea Road, Colaba) is the most expensive real estate market in India. It is bigger than the entire Chennai, Hyderabad, Kolkata and Ahmedabad markets.'' ""The current unsold inventory in south central Mumbai will take five to six years to sell,'' added Gulam Zia, executive director, Knight Frank. Independent property market sources expect an estimated 2,500 apartments in this area to hit the market in the next one year, which could lead to a major glut.

NCR witnessed the sharpest drop in new launches, at 41% year-on-year (YOY), followed by Chennai and Pune, at 36% and 32%, respectively. ""Mumbai turned out to be a surprise, as the city noted growth in new launches by more than 29% YOY in H1 2016,'' said the report. In terms of sales, the top six cities observed a positive growth of 7% in H12016, as the number of units sold jumped from 1,26,615 in H1 2015 to 1,35,015 in the latest period. But this is considerably lower than 1,85,800 units sold across these cities in H12015.Meanwhile, according to the half-yearly report released by the real estate consultancy, Cushman & Wakefield, Pune saw the highest drop in absorption of office spaces over the first half of the year (41%), after Chennai (51%). These cities, among the major eight cities, were followed by Mumbai (-36%) and Bangalore (-34%), where also the negative growth was seen to be significant.The reason cited by Cushman & Wakefield was ""unavailability of quality Grade A space in many cities, and prevalence of small-sized deals"""

Gram dal has instead become costlier. The price of arhar dal fallen but that of other pulses has not reduced as expected. Arhar dal is now sold in the retail market at Rs 140 a kg, moong dal at Rs 120 a kg and gram dal at Rs 110 a kg. On June 28, when the cabinet had decided to revise VAT on dal, chief secretary Aditya Prasad Padhi said: ""The traders had promised that if the VAT was revised, it would not affect revenue collection and would have a positive impact on the prices that would be passed on to the consumers. We will observe during the next three months the impact of VAT revision on revenue collection and price revision. We will then take the final call."" Federation of All-Odisha Traders' Association general secretary Sudhakar Panda had said that the VAT revision would definitely bring the prices down. However, observing the situation, food supplies secretary P.K. Mohapatra had shot off a letter to all district collectors asking them to conduct market studies on the wholesale and retail prices of dal. ""We are keeping a close watch on the market situation and will recommend action against unscrupulous traders,"" said deputy director, market intelligence, Pravakar Rout. Panda said VAT had been reduced by four per cent and it has had its impact on the dal prices. ""The arhar dal price has fallen from Rs 140 to Rs 130 a kg. The price of moong has also fallen correspondingly."" He, however, conceded that the gram dal price had climbed by Rs 30 a kg. ""We have no control over the price of gram dal because it has been listed under the National Commodity Exchange. The price fluctuates based on speculation,"" he said, adding that they had urged the Centre to de-list gram dal from the National Commodity Exchange. ""But the Centre has not accepted our demand."" Panda, however, hoped that the prices would fall in the coming days, as dal cultivation in Maharashtra, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh had been higher this year because of favourable weather conditions."

The sluggishness in sowing paddy, according to agriculture experts, follows fear of borewell failures with the rains so far not resulting in extensive recharge of groundwater table after two years of successive drought.""The rainfall has been fairly good this time, but not good enough to recharge the water table that had fallen to low depths in the last two years. As a result, rain-fed crops stand a better chance whereas sowing of the crops like paddy has not picked up,"" said agriculture scientist G V Ramanjaneyulu. ""The sowing of paddy should have been over by now. With just 16 per cent of normal crop area so far, we cannot really hope that farmers will plant the crop in a larger area in the next fortnight or a month,"" he added.Of the normal crop area of over 15 lakh hectares in the state, where farmers grow rice, sowing of paddy has been done only in 2.14 lakh hectares. ""The paddy sowing has been slow as compared to other crops since farmers depending on borewells are not getting enough water. The groundwater level has not improved as expected,"" said N Narasimha, joint director of the agriculture department. Narasimha was optimistic that the situation would improve and sowing of paddy might reach 50% of its normal crop area by August 15.The groundwater was severely affected due to two years of drought in 140 out of the total 445 mandals in the state. Water levels have plummeted to more than 20 metres below ground level (mgbl). The situation was termed 'critical' by the state groundwater board in 90 more mandals where water was available only after depths of 15 metres. The average depth of groundwater in Telangana is 10 mgbl. Though this year on an average the state has received 16% more rainfall, the rains have done little.""The rains have not been enough for irrigation projects.

Ramanathapuram District Jamaathul Ulama Council had opposed installation of the statue stating that it was against Muslim personal law (Shariat) but the officials decided to go ahead with the installation.It appeared that construction of the building might not be in the immediate offing when officials from the Directorate of Architecture, MoD, said they required seven to eight acres of land for building a world class memorial. Later, the State government had arranged 3.5 acres of land. It was negotiating with private parties for making available another 2.75 acres.Meanwhile, family members of Kalam visited the burial site and offered prayers at the Kabur (burial site) on the eve of his first death anniversary on Tuesday.

Most may have just heard this but Dr Ravindra Kolhe can vouch for it. Born in the temple town of Shegaon, he listened to sermons of saints who visited the place. ""They had a deep impact on my heart and mind,"" says the doctor who had his early education at a local school in Marathi medium.Suffering with a congenital heart ailment termed as primary pulmonary hypertension, Kolhe says frequent hospitalization and frail health made him a voracious reader. ""I got very good marks in Std X and wanted to become an engineer. But my teachers said I should go for medicine.""Kolhe moved to Wardha and enrolled at JB Science College. ""It was here that I came under the influence of Gandhi and Vinobha Bhave. Their ideologies had a deep impact on my mind.""Good marks in Std XII ensured a seat in Government Medical College, Nagpur. ""Here, too, I looked around for a library and found one at Ramkrishna Mission,"" he says. By this time Kolhe had realized that he had to work in rural area. ""I read John Ruskin's book 'Unto This Last' and was impressed by it. I was also in the company of seers at the Ramkrishna Math and would discuss the purpose of life with them.""By the time he was in the final year, he had formed a group called Sangharsh with his batch mates and they worked in the Babulkheda slum behind the medical college. ""It was at this time that I read the book 'Where There is No Doctor' written by a Spanish revolutionary. The book cover had an image of four persons carrying a patient on a stretcher and there was a milestone on which it was written -- hospital 30 miles. That image remained imprinted in my mind and when I passed out I decided to hunt for a village from where a hospital was 30km away,"" says the doctor.Though he wanted to rush to rural areas, ""my seniors advised me that I should first learn to do deliveries single-handedly, diagnose pneumonia with stethoscope and should be able to treat diarrhoea"", he says. Two house jobs in Mumbai equipped him with these skills.""My professors Dr Dinoo Dalal and Dr Minoo Advani took me through an intensive course in mother and child care,"" he says. On October 30, 1984, when Dr. Kolhe was just 23 years old, he went searching for the ideal village and travelled through Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Maharashtra.""I finally identified Bairagad in Amravati district on Feb 9, 1985. My batchmate and I began working from a veranda of a house,"" he says. But realization that they can't handle surgical emergencies made them decide that they should complete post-graduation too.Kolhe enrolled in GMC for MD in preventive and social medicine in 1986. ""My professor Dr Motghare said that I should look for some more sustainable solutions and asked me to prepare a paper on tribal health. The data that I collected about the mother and child health of tribals at Dharni was dismal.""What he discovered during this compilation was malnutrition of children in Melghat. These findings reached out to the world as he was interviewed by BBC radio. ""Suddenly this issue of child mortality and malnutrition in Melghat got political attention as I identified 200 reasons for it.""But after completing his MD, Dr Kolhe's partner refused to return to the village. ""This made it imperative that I get married as alone I could not serve the community."" But the conditions that he laid out for his would-be wife were tough. ""I wanted to marry a woman who would run the house in 400 per month, walk up to 40km, would agree for a registered marriage and be prepared to beg for others.""Ironically, the woman he married was a far cry. ""I was running a homeopathy clinic and earning lots of money. I was fashion conscious and would travel across the city just to match my footwear with a sari,"" says Dr Smita, who was also an ABVP worker and a school mate of Nitin Gadkari. ""But these four conditions were acceptable to me as I would always think what is it in life that I want beyond what I have,"" she says.In 1988, she left behind her penchant for good clothes and a good life and moved with her husband to Bairagad. ""It was a trial marriage and would continue till she kept to these four conditions,"" says Kolhe.In the village, the couple got a new mud house built by the villagers. ""Drawing water from the well, getting the mud, cow dung and hay mixture right for the walls, cooking on firewood were things that I had never done in life,"" recalls Smita.Wearing a sari costing 10 purchased from ration shops, she began enjoying the scenic beauty of Melghat and got involved in the life of the villagers. ""I loved the beauty of the place and the simplicity of the tribals,"" she says.The couple has two sons and both studied at the local school. ""The elder one Rohit is an agriculturist and the younger, Ram is studying at the medical college in Akola. The elder one's wife is a farmer's daughter. She took time to adjust with our lifestyle but is now comfortable with it,"" Smita says and adds that luckily the sons agreed to follow their parent's lifestyle.Going beyond community service through medicine, the couple have also focused their attention to making the village economically strong. ""We took help of agriculture universities and began sowing potatoes, soya bean, cotton, sugar cane, jute, water melon, turmeric and summer moong. Amravati is known as the suicide district but there are no such events in Melghat,"" says the proud couple.""Child mortality came down to 40 per 1000 when we began working it was 200, mortality of preschool children is 100, previously it was 400. We have been able to make an operation theatre with the help of private aid and now there are 70 doctors in the region,"" said Kolhe.The couple also organizes a camp 'Tarunai' for youth which is about social orientation and community living. ""We did not set up any NGO. This village is our karambhoomi and we are happy with any progress that is made here."" There only grouse is the lack of electricity in the area. ""It stops us from doing much more,"" they say."

The pattern of deficient rainfall has been common to all districts with South Interior Karnataka recording a 70 per cent deficit in the average rainfall during the month.North Interior Karnataka districts consisting of Bombay Karnataka and Hyderabad Karnataka regions also experienced 54 per cent deficient rainfall during August and the Malnad and the Coastal regions recorded 37 per cent and 28 per cent deficient rainfall during the month.As against a normal average rainfall of 197 mm during August, the State received only 114 mm rainfall. Similarly, South Interior Karnataka districts recorded 23 mm average rainfall as against a normal average rainfall of 76 mm. North Interior Karnataka districts recorded 50 mm average rainfall as against a normal rainfall of 110 mm during the month.

(The rain during the harvest period in August usually hampered harvest procedures and caused loss to farmers.)This year, farmers cultivated green gram in a record 52,562 hectares of land against the target fixed by the government at 35,100 hectares in Kalaburagi district. The productivity per hectare was also a record 5 quintals per hectare and as per the official estimate, a record 2.63 lakh quintals of green gram has been produced this year."

Pinning hopes on a similar windfall, onion growers increased cultivation. Maharashtra also recorded a good yield.

This season, onion has been grown in large quantities in Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and Bihar as well. Due to low demand, price has dipped, said APMC trader Suresh Habib.Rudragouda Ninganagouda, a farmer from Katakol village in Ramadurg taluk, lamented that the current prices of onion were so low that it would be better to bury the crop in the fields instead of harvesting it. The government should help farmers by announcing minimum support price and by procuring onion directly from farmers, he said.Green gramThe price of green gram has also fallen, and it is being purchased for Rs 3,000 to Rs 5,000 a quintal. Compared to last year, green gram price had come down by Rs 3,000 to Rs 4,000 a quintal, trader Shivanna Adargunchi observed."

Hence, not many are aware how does the food taste with its varieties and names a bit similar to that of Bengali dishes given it is the neighbouring state of Bengal. Unfortunately, theres hardly any restaurant in the city that offers the cuisine. Those who want to have a taste of the same can go to Aish, The Park as Odia Bhoji - Odia Food festival is being held over there that will be on till September 19. One can enjoy it both for lunch and dinner.The menu was curated by chef Mandar, chef Bibhu Bhatta, Bhubaneswar and food blogger Swati Sucharita. At the sampling we tasted Dahi Bara Aloo Dum - a unique combination of dahi bara with soft spicy potatoes. We liked Sijha Manda - rice dumplings with moong dal filling. It somewhat appeared like bao. After two more starters we tasted the main course. Thunka Puri with its jumbo size made for a great combo with Chenna Tarkari and Ghanta Tarkari, a mix of crushed vegetables and sprouted grams. We liked it with Oau Khatta a chutney of elephant apple. We tried Dahi Machha and Mansha Kassa with Ghia Arna, a rice preparation. We recommend Badi Chura with rice. Its nothing but urad dal baris fried, crushed and mixed with spices. Our pick from the dessert platter is Kheera Sagar - a rasmalai like dish made from baby rasgollas. It is a delicious spread, but we missed Kanika with which Odia food is associated with."

He appealed to the banks to disburse fresh crop loans to farmers before the Kharif season ends on September 30 without further hassles.""Though banks are issuing fresh loans to farmers, there are several instances of loans being denied. I appeal to the banks to cooperate with the government and help farmers,"" Rajender said at the State Level Bankers' Committee (SLBC) meeting on Monday.The government has only made a partial payment of the third instalment of crop loan dues so far this year. ""Steps were being taken to release the remaining amount and the dues would be settled 'at the earliest'"", he said. According to the farm loan waiver scheme announced in 2014, the government has to pay Rs 17,460 crore to banks in four equal instalments in four years. While the government paid two instalments in full, it paid only Rs 1,060 crore of the third instalment this year. Agriculture minister Pocharam Srinivas Reddy too, appealed to banks to issue fresh loans before September 30. Noting that some of banks were collecting interest from farmers for their outstanding loan amounts, the agriculture minister requested bankers not to collect interest and asked them to remit the amount of interest already collected to their respective accounts.Later, Srinivas Reddy told the media that the banks had disbursed Rs 11,556 crore as crop loans against the target of Rs 17,460 crore for the current kharif.""The banks are obliged to issue another Rs 6,000 crore before the end of this month,"" he added. He also said that the government would release the pending input subsidy to farmers in drought-hit mandals soon. He said that Telangana had witnessed good monsoon with 711.8 mm rainfall recorded as on Monday (September 19) resulting in considerable cultivation. ""Farmers have sowed in 37.73 lakh hectares as against the normal 43.4 lakh hectares. Except paddy all other crops, including maize (190 per cent), soya bean (148 per cent), red gram (167 per cent), and green gram (142 per cent), have crossed the normal level. Standing crops are also in good state,"" he said. However, cultivation of cotton has come down by 5 lakh hectares after the government issued an advisory against growing cotton in view of falling prices."
58f6ab577be9e031f13b9a82,Govt misled ryots on cotton cultivation?,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/Govt-misled-ryots-on-cotton-cultivation/articleshow/54436534.cms,2016-09-21,"HYDERABAD: A government advisory not to grow cotton this kharif crop season has landed state farmers in trouble with prices of alternative crops they were encouraged to grow falling. And rubbing salt into their wounds, the price of cotton has been witnessing a dramatic rise.Further, there has been no word from the government so far on initiating market intervention measures and procuring of produce at minimum support price (MSP).The gravity of distress in the farming community this Kharif has been such that more than two farmers a day - 74 in all - killed themselves in the state just in August, according to Rythu Swarajya Vedika (RSV), an NGO that works on issues related to the farming community. This makes August this year the deadliest for farmers in the recent past. ""When the government advised the farmers not to grow cotton at the beginning of Kharif, it was its responsibility to put in place a support system even before the farmers went for alternative crops. The system should have been ready to procure produce from farmers at reasonably good prices. In the absence of these steps, the government advisory has wreaked havoc and farm suicides have risen at an alarming rate even before the end of monsoon season,"" said Kiran Kumar Vissa , state executive member of RSV.Predicting low prices for cotton ostensibly based on projected global market scenario, the government advised framers not to grow cotton and, instead, asked them to go for crops such as soybean, pulses, and millets.Consequently, in Telangana, the third largest cotton producing state in India, cotton sowing fell drastically this Kharif and cultivation of other crops like soybean, red gram, green gram, maize almost doubled. But much to the farmers' shock, with Kharif drawing to close, price of cotton has gone up and prices of crops that they have planted have fallen. The farmers, in addition to being faced by dropping prices for their produce, are also having to contend with moderate yields that have been below par for the alternative crops thanks to the dry spell that took hold in the middle of the monsoon season. In different agricultural market yards in Telangana, cotton that was sold at Rs. 4,050 a quintal last year in August-September, is now fetching between Rs. 8,000 and Rs. 10,000 a quintal. Only a few are rejoicing this upbeat scenario since a majority of farmers abandoned cotton following the government's advisory. Against normal cropped area of 17.09 lakh hectares, cotton was sown in 9.86 lakh hectares this Kharif.On the other hand, cultivation of soybean went up by 148 per cent from 2 lakh hectares to 2.96 hectares. Redgram cultivation increased from 2.5 lakh hectares to 4.175 lakh hectares that is 168 per cent rise. Maize and greengram saw 190 per cent and 142 per cent respectively with cropped area of 4.91 lakh hectares and 2 lakh hectares.However, the prices of other crops have plummeted drastically. Greengram sold at Rs.6,965 a quintal last year is now selling at about Rs. 4,500. Soybean now sells at Rs. 2,800 against it's last year's price of Rs. 3,700 a quintal. Price of maize has fallen from the last year's Rs. 1,419 to Rs.1,200 per quintal. Redgram has seen a steep decline from Rs 7,000 to Rs.5, 827 a quintal.The government, however, is attributing the fluctuation in price to demand and supply dynamics.""It is natural that price of cotton is going up since cultivation of the crop has drastically gone down across the country. And farmers went for over cultivation of alternative crops because of which their prices have crashed,"" said principal secretary of the agriculture department C Parthasarathi.He said the government issued advisory against cotton to avoid a monocrop situation in the state and asking farmers not to plant cotton was not on the basis of price alone. 'However, the government is ready for market intervention, The farmers need not be worried,"" Parthasarathi said."

Karnataka's UMP promises more options for sale. For the local trader in the mandi (market), it also offers the opportunity to access a larger market for secondary trading. The gradual integration of all major mandis in the states will ensure common procedures for issue of licences, levy of fee and movement of produce. Over 5-6 years, the government expects significant benefits for farmers with integration of national markets.Driving the projectManoj Rajan, a 2008 IFS officer, was the brain behind the UMP which was launched in 2014. As managing director and CEO of ReMS, he decluttered the agriculture market riddled with middlemen and unfair trade practices. Manoj, who is from Kolar, used technology to provide a barrier-free agricultural market system.

Rajan, a graduate of Mysore University, also had a stint as a chief electoral officer and managing director of the Karnataka State Beverages Corporation.Showing the wayKarnataka's Unified Market Platform has now become a pan-India inititiative and model for several other states. The model was first showcased at the National Conference on Sustainable Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi at Gangtok in January 2016.

It is a matter of serious concern. Our government is focussing on the development of crop varieties tolerant to climatic stress. Our universities and agricultural scientists need to concentrate on this area of research which is expected to gain much importance in the days to come, he said.In the first phase, the Minister added, climate resilient crop varieties of red gram, green gram, chickpea, jowar, ragi, maize and other such crops that are essential for food and nutrient security would be developed. These new varieties would not only be climate resilient but they would also give 30 per cent more yield as compared to conventional varieties, he said.The Minister also advised the farming community to rapidly shift from conventional farming to scientific and advanced farming by reaping the fruits of technological innovations and advancements in the farm sector.It is by adopting newer technologies, crop varieties and advanced and scientific farming methods only farmers can face the newer challenges in the sector. We cannot always view agriculture emotionally. We have to inevitably move from conventional farming method to scientific and advanced farming methods with which we can get more yield with less investment and less cultivation area, he said.As many as 12 farmers, one male and one female farmer from each district of Hyderabad Karnataka, who made significant achievements in the field of agriculture were honoured and conferred with Shreshta Krishika (male) and Shresthta Krishi Mahile) awards on the occasion.

Gobindo Sarkar, 42, was found dead at his home in Khiripara village in Bamungola, about 55km from here. While his family said Sarkar had committed suicide because of the cash crunch, police said the reason was yet to be found out. According to the police, Sarkar had returned from Hyderabad about a week ago. ""He had returned with some money after working in Hyderabad. He had run out of cash after settling debts. His wife, Anguri Sarkar, is a domestic help in Delhi. The couple have three children, Champa, 18, Sagar, 15, and Shampa, 11. The eldest daughter is a first year student in Pakua College. Her younger siblings study in Pakua High School,"" a police source said. Champa, who ran the household in the absence of her parents, said all the cash that her father had brought had been exhausted. ""My mother sometimes sends money to my father's bank account from Delhi. We had run up dues to the tune of Rs 10,000 at the local grocery. There was no cash at home. Since Monday, I have been going to the only ATM of the State Bank of India in Pakua, about 2km away. There was a huge queue before the ATM on Monday and I could not withdraw money. Yesterday, too, I stood in the queue but before I could enter the ATM, it had run out of cash. I returned home and told my father that I was not able to draw cash. He turned furious and scolded me. I, along with a neighbour and my brother and sister, went to the ATM after sunset. We returned around 8pm and found my father hanging from a beam in the ceiling,"" Champa said. Prasanta Sarkar, Gobindo's elder brother, said he and his brother struggled to make both ends meet. ""We are extremely poor and somehow manage to eke out a living. My brother and his wife work outside and they have a bank account in Pakua where they send money for their children. About a week ago, he returned home. They had run out of cash and could not buy food and the grocer had stopped giving them credit. Even though there was some money in his bank account, his daughter could not withdraw it because of long queues and the machine running out of cash. Gobindo broke down mentally and committed suicide,"" Prasanta said. Today, some of the villagers stood by the family to pay for Gobindo's last rites. ""After his death, his family did not have money for the last rites. We started a collection and some money will be handed over to his children. We paid for his last rites. We are angry and upset that he had to kill himself because of the cash crisis in the wake of the demonetisation decision,"" said Pralay Biswas, a neighbour. Asutosh Pal, the officer-in-charge of Bamungola police station, said he couldn't say before investigation whether the suicide was triggered by the cash crisis. ""There was some problem in the family and that is why the man committed suicide. Whether it was due to the cash crunch can be said only after a thorough investigation,"" Pal said."

She helps run a self-help group of 18 women in this village in Sangareddy district, which borders Karnataka and is 168 km from Hyderabad.The village is readying up for rabi sowing. Many of the villagers are Dalit tenant farmers. Chandramma and her husband decided to cultivate sugarcane this year. Already late to sow, they needed an urgent need to borrow Rs 30,000 from the nearest Andhra Pradesh Grameen Vikas Bank, 25 km away in Narayankhed, a town with just one other bank, SBI.That was when demonetisation struck. There are only three buses to Narayankhed; some days none. And then the bank, which had never said no to Chandramma in the past, refused to lend to her this time. So she turned to a money lender, borrowing at a monthly interest rate of 3 per cent or 36 per cent annually .As Chandramma speaks, two men join her side and she stops talking. Gunendar Rao and T Nandu Singh are both money lenders and do not seem pleased that Chandramma is talking to the press. Everything is fine here, one of them says. People are just a bit inconvenienced here. The banks will sort things out.Gunendar Rao decides to justify himself. I dont charge too much, just 3 per cent, which amounts to Rs 900 a month for Rs 30,000. Im trying to help these farmers because the banks arent giving them any money.Nandu picks up the theme, Now the banks dont have money to give, so they come to us. We dont have any problem accepting their Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes.There are whispers that the moneylenders take a cut of Rs 100 from each demonetised note.Kharamungi is separated from the Karnataka border by the Manjira river. Villagers can choose to cross the river and travel to Bidar, a distance of 15 km, or travel 40 km by public transport to the nearest agricultural market in Bidar. It is easier to get demonetised notes exchanged there than go to the Narayankhed banks. Narayankhed is the connecting point for 43 villages in Manoor mandal, serving over 50,000. Last Thursday, there were long queues snaking out of the towns two banks. The only ATM was closed in the morning and had a long queue in the evening.Pushpa Thakur has money due fromthe local dairy | SATHYA KEERTHIBack in Kharamungi, Pushpa Thakur and her husband dont own the home they inhabit with their son. In 2015, they borrowed Rs 40,000 from a money lender to farm a land they leased. The banks did not give them credit as they dont own the land. But the Manjira flooded that year, resulting in crop losses for most farmers in this village including Pushpa Thakur and her family. Pushpa switched to selling cows milk to Vijaya Diary to get by. But the dairy company has not made any payments for October and November. Everytime we ask them, they say next week. Now they say they dont have money, says Pushpa. She is afraid she will default on her payments to the moneylender.Demonetisation was sprung upon Kharamungi at a time when rabi crop sowing season was due. Now with banks and microfinance companies not lending to farmers owing to the currency shortage, farmers are left with no option but to approach the local moneylenders."

Papikonda forms part of the picturesque Eastern Ghats and a major portion of these hills will be submerged in the backwaters of the Polavaram dam across the Godavari.There are a number of plant and animal species endemic to the Papikonda hills and they will lose a major portion of their unique habitat once the dam is ready. The stripe-necked mongoose, which is a native of the Western Ghats and Sri Lanka, was discovered in Eastern Ghats earlier this year through camera trappings. This is the first time that this variety of mongoose has been found outside the Western Ghats. Wildlife enthusiasts fear that the stripe-necked mongoose will lose its new habitat even before zoologists could fully explore the animal. Incidentally, the animal was featured in the latest issue of the 'Journal of Threatened Taxa' published on December 26, the day AP government received Central funds for Polavaram.Research scholars, Kumpatla Balaji from the department of zoology in Andhra University , Visakhapatnam, and Jarugulla Eswar Satyanarayana, from the department of environmental sciences in Acharya Nagarjuna University , Guntur, have discovered the stripe-necked mongoose in the Papikonda hills. They not only obtained camera trappings but also sighted the animal in the Papikonda sanctuary. Though the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) in its latest 'Red List' classified stripe-necked mongoose as ""least concern"", wildlife activists argue that the Polavaram dam will rob the animal of its new habitat.Besides the new variety of mongoose, Balaji and Satyanarayana also spotted rare animals including the Gaur, Indian spotted eagle and Indian peafowl. ""Local tribes Konda Reddy, Koya Dora and Valmiki call the stripe-necked mongoose 'Yentawa mungisa'. There was a historical sight-record from the Horsley Hills in the Eastern Ghats but hitherto dismissed as doubtful. There has been no records of the stripe-necked mongoose from the entire range of the Eastern Ghats. Hence, this is the first photographic evidence,"" they said.The researchers emphasized the need for a thorough research on the conservation status of the stripe-necked mongoose.The threat to the animal should be studied in detail before the dam is ready."
