The trend that started after Onam is expected to continue until March if not for any unexpected natural event.Of the 23 items under the tubers and vegetables category in the ESD list, 17 have lower prices than previous January with some like carrot and tomato showing over 40 per cent dip. Exceptions are elephant foot yam, tapioca, colocasia, cucumber, banana and plantain which recorded 4-56 per cent hike in prices.While the milk price is stable, a dozen white leghorn eggs now cost Rs 1.40 less. V P Jayakumar, a vegetable trader in Chalai market and a former office-bearer of the Kerala Vyapari Vyavasayi Ekopana Samithi, said now there was a surplus supply of vegetables from Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka, unlike previous years.Prices are down after Onam and the situation is likely to continue until March, he said.Cereal is one category that survived the downfall trend and firmed up. Except Chamba rice, all other rice varieties showed an upward trend, 7-18 per cent growth from previous January. Sugar too recorded a 23 per cent growth. According to Satheesh R N, Supplycos marketing manager, the new governments decision to sell 13 commodities at the same rate during its tenure has helped control the prices of major cereals and pulses.The 1,400-odd outlets of Supplyco help our consumerist state to control food prices. Commodities other than the 13 classified items are sold at prices 40-50 per cent less than the market rate. FMCGs are sold at 2-30 per cent discount, he added."

Rich aroma of Aresalu is wafting into the streets. Bylanes are reverberating with the singing of Haridasus and kites of various desgins are soaring high in the sky.The enitre State is ready for the celebration of rich Telugu culture and traditions. It is Sankranti.Why it is celebrated?Makar Sankranti has a uniqueness to itself. Unlike other Hindu festivals which follow the lunar calendar, Makar Sankranti is probably among the very few festivals that is observed as per the solar calendar.This makes it the only festival to fall on a fixed date every year - January 14.The mode of celebrations has an agararian overtone and in Andhra Pradesh, being a major agrarian economy, it is arguably called the mother of all festivals. The harvest festival is celebrated for four days in Andhra Pradesh.Women playing kolatam during Sankranti celebrationsat A Convention Centre in Vijayawada on Friday | ExpressDay 1 - BhogiThe festival starts with the Bhogi, a day preceding Sankranti. People shed old and derelict things and welcome the new symbolising transformation.Before the day break, bonfires (Bhogi Mantalu) are lighted with logs of wood, other solid fuels and wooden furniture that are no longer in use.It stands for realisation, transformation and purification of the self by a change for the better.Day-2 Makar SankrantiOn Makar Sankranti, the second day of the festival, people wear new clothes, offer prayers to God, and make offerings of traditional food to ancestors who have died. Beautiful and ornate drawings and patterns are drawn on the ground with chalk or flour (Rangoli or Muggulu) in front of houses and these drawings are decorated with flowers, colours and small, hand-pressed piles of cow dung, called Gobbemmalu.Day-3 KanumaOn the third day, Kanuma is celebrated. Kanuma is very dear to the farmer community as it is the day on which they showcase their gratitude to cattle which are the symbolic indication of prosperity.The animals are given a bath and adorned with ornaments. Girls feed animals, birds and fish as a symbol of sharing.To ensure the happy gathering of the family members, any travel on this day is considered inappropriate.Day-4 MukkanumaThe fourth day is called Mukkanuma which is popular among the non-vegetarians. On this day, farmers offer prayers to the natural elements like soil, rain and fire for blessing them with good harvest. People in Coastal Andhra do not eat any meat (or fish) during the first three days of the festival and do so only on the day of Mukkanuma and the day following Mukkanuma call for celebrations with union of families, friends, relatives followed by fun activities, which include cockfights, bullock race and kite flying.The young damsels come together and put forward cute little dolls coupled with other things and narrate a scenario. Although this tradition of Bommala Koluvu is slowly fading, people of all ages love to see the display as friends and relatives are invited to have a look. In the olden days, local handicrafts like Kondapalli and Etikoppaka toys and dolls were showcased but now collection of handicrafts across the country are being displayed.HaridasusDressed in an attire unique to the art form, with an Akshaya Patra on the head, a Tambura, and Chidatalu, the Haridasu is the one who ushers in the festive spirit associated with Sankranti. Haridasu goes from house to house and ask for bhiksha. Haridasu says Krishnarpanam when he receives offerings from people.Lip-smacking delicaciesFor this festival, most of the families prepare Chakinalu, Nuvvula Appalu, Gare Appalu, Madugulu (Jantikalu), Bellam Appalu, Kudumulu, Ariselu and Dappalam (a dish made with pumpkin and other vegetables) to make an offering to God. The sweet delicacies include a sweet porridge like dish known as Chakkara Pongal which is made with rice, jaggery and mung lentils, flavoured with cardamoms and dry fruits. Symbolic of joy and festivity, Poornam Boorelu is the most popular sweet prepared in the homes of Andhrites.CockfightsCockfight is a tradition that has been followed by the people. It is a bloodsport between two roosters held in a ring called cockpit. It is the favourite sport of people living in the coastal region of Andhra Pradesh.The fights are organised in sprawling fields with thousands watching. Three or four inch blades are attached to the cocks legs. Knockout fights to the death are widely practiced in the State.Different celebrations of Sankranti across IndiaIndia is known for Unity in Diversity and at the same time India is known as the Land of Festivals.

The Rigveda literature gives description of different kinds of patras (containers) and household items. Later, the artisans with their skill and imagination added high value to those items which constituted one of the major items of Indias export.Economic historian Angus Maddison in his book The World Economy  A millennial perspective noted that from first century AD to 15th century AD, India was the worlds largest economy with 32.9% share of worlds GDP. The East India Company used to buy Indian goods worth five lakh pounds every year before 1757 AD for export.It is not only the art objects the Indians knew, the technique of building climate friendly houses and knew organic farming techniques. In fact, Indian economy was an extension of eco-system which can be rewoven to generate employment and foreign currency.The brassware industry of Moradabad has an estimated annual turnover of Rs 8,000 crore out of which Rs 6,000 crore come from export. Indian gold sector employ 2.5 million artisans to export gold ornaments worth $20 billion per annum.The wooden toy makers of Nirmal in Adilabad district of Telangana add high value to idols of gods and goddesses, large sized horses, elephants, eagle and figures from the Indian mythologies. Only about 50 artisans survive to work for one handicraft production centre of the state government. Their income hardly exceeds Rs 300 per day after nine hours of hard labour.The artisans do not have direct access to buyers and exporters. Here the state government should provide raw material-poniki wood, transparent marketing facility and social security to the artisans. In 1960s, every house in Salem had a loom. Today, hardly 100 handloom weavers struggle to keep the tradition alive.The handloom tradition has declined due to poor cooperative leadership, corruption and mismanagement. The weavers were forced to pay commission at the time of buying yarns, receiving order and while receiving payment which is delayed for more than one year. The majority of the buyers cannot distinguish a pure Salem silk from a mill-made one. Salem may miss all its genuine handloom weavers in the next five years.Similarly, the Paithani silk saree weavers of Aurangabad are left with little enthusiasm. Some 10 to 20 senior weavers in the city work for traders on daily wage basis. Genuine Kashmiri carpet is losing to mill made carpets which are sold in the name of Kashmiri carpets. Here, the state government should create awareness among buyers about the genuine Kashmiri carpets which are worth gold.Senior artisans of Srinagar can make fine papier machie work. One can see the different shades of rose petals drawn on papier machie work with a magnifying glass. India has many craft traditions namely rose wood, coir, cane and mask of Kerala, dhokra craft of Odisha and Chhattisgarh, religious paintings of Odisha, Himachal Pradesh, AP and Bihar, wood craft of Bastar tribe, the warli paintings of Maharashtra, the bidri craft of Bidar, bangles and pearl work of Hyderabad, embroidery work of Gujarat, paintings of Rajasthan and hundreds of exotic crafts from different parts of India. India can have a big share of world artisans products which is estimated at $ 800 billion.Decorative itemsLike bio degradable utility and decorative items, Indians knew organic farming practices in the later Vedic period from 1000 BC to 600 BC. Organic farming is going to be the future agriculture. As per The World of Organic Agriculture: Statistics & Emerging Trends 2016, the global organic food market reached $80 billion in 2014 and is growing at 10% per annum, India can tap the ancient organic farming techniques which are still practiced in many places.Tribal in Malkangiri of Orissa grow organic turmeric, horse gram, green gram, tur daal, small rajma and mango jelly. Dedicated research on organic farming, district-wise bio diversity survey and documentation of the farming practices can evolve a well thought out national organic farm policy.Houses in India were also built to suit different climatic conditions. One can come across houses with roof made with tile, nim leaves, wood and clay were made to offset summer heat in Karimnagar district of Telangana. A simple mason from Kerala understands the geographical and climatic condition well. Houses with sloping roof of clay tiles, palm leaves, hard wood and timber used to fight harsh sun, heavy rain, the wet and humid condition in Kerala.Bamboo, cane, cane leaves, mud, and lime used for the building material in North East India were most suitable to the climatic condition of the region. There are houses made of wood with slanting roof of stone slates to fight rain and snow in Himachal Pradesh.One can come across a wide range of dress material which are made according to different climates of the country. Like the dress materials, Indians knew how to prepare the widest variety of nutritious homemade food in the world. How to tap Indias huge economic potential enshrined in Indian way of life is the biggest challenge before the Modi government."

Turn to Ayurveda,http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/hyderabad/2017/feb/04/want-beautiful-skin-turn-to-ayurveda-1566673.html,2017-02-04,"HYDERABAD: Beauty isnt skin deep, it goes much deeper. Skin being the most absorbent organ of the body, requires special care. With the environment already unleashing high level of toxins on our health, its time to be alert about not just our lifestyle, what we eat, drink and even breathe, but also what we apply on your body. This is where Ayurveda come to your rescue. Unlike beauty regimens, Ayurveda is ideal for all skin types.In conversation with Hyderabad Express, Dr GG Gangadharan, Director Ramaiah Indic Specialty Ayurveda, Ayurvedic advisor, Lever Ayush, reveals why it is time to throw those bottles and tubes of creams and packs, and head to the kitchen and fridge instead.We often witness college-goers wrap their faces in dupattas to keep away the pollution but it still gets to them. Suggest some skin care routine.Wash face with lukewarm water mixed with 1tsp honey and 1 tsp lemon juice twice a day (in the morning and as soon as you reach home). Massage face and neck with oil which helps in enhancing complexion like Chemparathyadi Coconut oil (based with hibiscus) and Nalpamaradi Coconut oil (Based on Nalpamara viz., Ficus family and Turmeric). These medicines are available in all Ayurvedic pharmacies. If you are used to drinking milk, boil garlic (3 gms, peeled, washed and crushed) in 1 cup of milk, filter and take it internally at bed time. Alternatives are: honey (1 tsp) mixed with 1 glass of lemon water or carrot juice mixed with orange juice. This regular routine will help clear the pores of the face and keep the skin fresh.Models and creative artistes put on a lot of makeup viz., toner, primer, foundation etc. What kind of Ayurvedic products can one use to protect skin from an onslaught of such cosmetics?Generally synthetic ingredients cannot give any textural enhancement, and some of them are even harmful to the skin if used over long periods. It is better to protect the skin on a daily basis by mild face massage with Nalpamaradi Coconut oil/ Nisoushiradi tailam/ Eladi Coconut oil and face steam with tulsi (Basil leaves) water. Doing this on a regular basis shall help to open the clogged pores and remove the impurities thereby preventing harm to skin. Later cleanse the face with any vegetable pulp (e.g., cucumber/ tomato Pulp) or fruits like orange pulp/ fresh black grapes pulp. Then wash your face with fresh lukewarm water and put face mask with fine coriander powder with coconut milk and honey. Regular maintenance with above said facial care shall help maintain the skin texture and tone.Suggest a few tips on combating the pollutants in the city traffic.To protect from the pollutants in the traffic, it is better to scrub the face with a handful of incha (bark of the climber Acacia intsia, traditionally used for bathing after Ayurveda oil massage) which is available in all Ayurveda stores. Then wash with lukewarm water and gently massage with pure coconut oil and face steam with lemon water (cut the lemon into pieces and boil in water). Then massage the face, neck, shoulder with a paste of green gram boiled in milk and honey. Along with this, hydrate face with cooked rice water. Apply, face pack with carrot, tomato pulp.Suggest some personal care across the day using five or six proven Ayurvedic tips.The best method of personal care is using regular oil bath. This routine can be done at home or at an Ayurveda centre. Oil like pure coconut oil/ sesame oil can be used. An Ayurveda doctor will be able to select a suitable oil based on your body nature and general constitution.Exercise and Yoga enables one to improve inhalation of more oxygen and thereby purifies the body. This aids cell repair (hair follicle included) and activates metabolism.Early to bed, early to rise and early morning bowel evacuation is important for healthy body and skin.Regular eye wash and application of medicated collyrium (anjana) is important to maintain eye health.Regular foot massage during bed time after cleaning feet is advisable which helps to relax the nerves of body and ensures good sleep. It also helps to protect the eyes.Wholesome food habitsProactive in performing regular, designated and rightful duties towards oneselfand for the nation.Does loose hair touching cheeks cause any harm to the skin? If yes, then what can be doneabout it?Hair is of elastic nature. Continuous rubbing can scar the skin thereby reducing the softness of cheeks. Apply a cream made by swirlingbutter in turmeric (Kastoorimanjal) and honey on cheeks.What do you think are fiveessentials that every youngster in a polluted city must consume everyday to maintain good health and clear skin?Avoid Constipation. Hydrate the body tissues by regularly drinking adequate water.Accelerate the skin peeling process by having regular bath after body massage with oil.Regeneration of body cells is essential which can be enhanced by regular intake of amalaki, ghee, honey and milk.Staple food specific to the region should be consumed. Eat seasonal fruits and vegetablesAyurveda advises to take green gram soup and horse gram soup which help in maintaining the minerals, vitamins and protein required for the body. Green gram soup recipe: Soak a handful of green gram dhal overnight. Pressure cook the same until it is well cooked. Strain it and season the juice with pure ghee and salt to taste.Dr GG Gangadharan, Director Ramaiah Indic Specialty Ayurveda, Ayurvedic advisor, Lever Ayush"
58fd34217be9e06c93716fbe,Ignored Himayath Sagar still a lifeline for city,http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/hyderabad/2017/feb/24/ignored-himayath-sagar-still-a-lifeline-for-city-1574137.html,2017-02-24,"HYDERABAD: It might be battered and bruised but Himayath Sagar is not dead yet. A recently published study on water quality of the lake has revealed surprising figures which clearly indicate that the lakes water quality is still close to that of drinking water. Experts say that one of the reasons behind this is the protection that the lake has received over the years in the form of Government Order (GO 111) which has been implemented in bits and pieces.The figures of water quality parameters revealed by the study, and a comparison of these figures with those of Hussain Sagar water, gives another reason as to why the GO 111 needs to stay rather than be repealed.During the study conducted by VNR Vignana Jyothi Institute of Engineering and Technology over a span of a year, water samples were collected from different locations of the lake in winter, summer and rainy seasons. The samples were then analysed for various physicochemical and biological parameters including Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD), Total Solids and Phosphates.While some parameters were found to be slightly above the drinking water quality standards prescribed by the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) and Central Pollution Control Board(CPCB), others are much lower than the maximum permissible limit.Sample this: As per CPCB, BOD should be 2 milligrams per liter (mg/l) or less for drinking water. The value in Himayath Sagar was recorded at 3mg/l in whereas that in Hussain Sagar and Musi river goes up to 20mg/l and 80mg/l respectively. Similarly, Total Solids should be absent as per BIS. It was recorded at 3.4mg/l in Himayat Sagar and a humungous 1,000mg/l in Hussain Sagar and Musi.Protection ensured good quality of waterDr MVSS Giridhar of Centre for Water Resources, JNTU-Hyderabad said: Though Osman Sagar and Himayath Sagar have been polluted over the years, the amount of pollution has been low due to the lakes being protected under GO 111. This makes it necessary to ensure that the lakes stay protected.Dr Giridhar added, One argument being made is that Hyderabad is no more dependent on Himayath Sagar or Osman Sagar for drinking water as we are getting Krishna and Godavari water. It should be kept in mind that climate change is a reality. Drought year or floods due to sudden downpour can strike anytime. The lakes will play essential role in both situations, for providing drinking water and controlling the floods."

One must make a choice to take a chance or our lives will never change.Too heavy to understand! Right? Well, anyway who wouldnt want to be spoilt for choices? Choices on the menu card are pass. The new fad is to have choices of chef! Thanks to Mercure Hyderabad, people can choose chefs and their signature dishes.The chef series at Cayenne restaurant of Mercure offers choice of chefs and also cuisines ranging from Hyderabadi, South Indian, North Indian, Pan Asian and Western.

Just when I was enjoying my first mango drink, they placed a bowl with globule of rice.Even before I could give the chef a puzzled look, they poured some magenta pink fluid.The chef enlightened me that it was chawal with beetroot shorba. Well, my slow-motion video of it makes me crave for the soup. I never imagined myself relishing beetroot so much that I asked for more shorba.Then came another star to fulfill my gastronomical cravings. I was served fried idli with lime pickle filling. The south Indian in me couldnt be happier to discover that the most underrated idli could be given such a makeover. It remained the show-stopper.I heard Pineapple rasam from the corner of the table and I jumped in excitement. There is no south Indian wedding that is complete without pineapple rasam. I wanted to taste the chefs style and it goes without saying, the spices of rasam, tanginess of pineapple and the infusion of red round chillis were intact.Ankuri Makkai Hara Pyaaz Ki Tikki was next on my plate. To explain it in local language, it was an exotic full moong dal ki vada. The green chutney complimented well. My main course had coconut rice with badami kofta and some cheese risotto. The desserts couldnt get any better with Paan kulfi, Andhra Special Putharekulu, poached pear and some edible flowers.Other delicacies included dishes like Murg Gulnaz, Matki Murg, Kothimir kodi, Khmer fish curry, SubzBadamiKofta, GuttiBeerakai Masala, Gongura Kodi Kura, under one roof.The Choose your Chef series will continue till April.

The yield has reduced to one-third of last years harvest, they rue. Out of five acres, I could harvest just eight bags of green gram, each of 100 kg, against 22 bags last year, said S. Muthukumar of Athukudi village. The price which stood at Rs. 6,000 has come down to just Rs. 5,200.Ditto with blackgram crop. S. Vasanthan, another farmer from the same village, said he raised black gram on an acre. Against six bags last year, he could get only three now. The price of each bag, which stood at Rs. 13,000 last year, had come down to Rs. 6,800.Adding to the list of woes was the rodent menace, which caused extensive damage to the crop when it was nearing harvest.To the farmers, the fall in prices against a low yield was a mystery. Especially, when they had not marketed their produce immediately and waited for the demand to increase in order to get better returns.But wholesale dealers said the abundant supply of green gram and black gram from adjoining states, particularly Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka, resulted in the fall in the prices of the two crops. Though the yield was poor in Tamil Nadu, the adjoining states registered a steady increase in terms of yield."
5922bfa27be9e01fe6dfa26e,Bidar fort beckons!,http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/hyderabad/2017/apr/29/bidar-fort-beckons-1598902.html,2017-04-29,"HYDERABAD: After chasing blackbucks in the Jungle Lodge Resort in Vilaspur (Karnataka), I chose to kill the next day in the nearby Bidar, a mere 18 km from the resort. Bidar city is well known for its Bidri handicraft products, as much for its rich history. It is also considered one of the holiest places for Sikh pilgrimage (Gurdwara Nanak Jhira Saheb). I often find people travelling from Hyderabad for a days trip to Bidar, which is around 140 kms away  a three-hour drive.On the way they stop for cutting chai or cool watermelon or simply munch time-pass moong phalli (peanuts) in the air-conditioned comfort of their car. Of course, whenever something rural and fancy catches their eye, there will be a brief stop for a selfie moment.I did not enter Bidar city. Instead, I caught a glimpse of Karnatakas richly textured history in the rugged 15th century Bidar Fort: surrounded by a triple-moated wall hewn out of red rock, with intricate battlements and an imposing gateway.Took a walk through the ruins, which were once royal baths, kitchens, audience halls and pleasure pavilions. Experienced the Rang Mahal with its elaborately carved wooden pillars, Persian couplets engraved in tiles and exquisite mother-of-pearl inlay work. Whats more, I came back much invigorated!Bidar FortBidar Fort is considered as one of the most formidable forts of the country. It was distinctly planned and built on the brink of the Deccan Plateau by Sultan Ahmed Wali between AD 1426-1432. Engineers and architects of various countries were employed on its design and construction. The fort is surrounded by 5.5 km of defence wall consisting of 37 massive polygonal bastions and seven strong irregular rhombic shaped gates.The fort is entered from the southeast by a zigzag passage protected by three gateways. It is said that the unique triple moat defence, resembling the medieval European forts was made by Turkish mercenaries.Another interesting feature is the massive magazines for arms storage and tunnels for escape in emergency. Within the fort are interesting monuments like Takht Mahal, Tarkash Mahal, Rangeen Mahal, Gagan Mahal, Shahi Matbakh (royal kitchen), Diwan-i- Aam (public audience hall), Sola Khamba Mosque, Naubat Khana etc. I spent time at some of the most noteworthy monuments.Sola Khamba MosqueOriginally it was the principal mosque, Masjid-i-Jami of Bidar. It is also called zanana masjid. In 1656 AD when Aurangzeb, as viceroy of the Deccan from the imperial court at Delhi, conquered Bidar, he hastened to this mosque to have the khutba recited in the name of his father Shah Jehan, as proclamation of his sovereignty in the newly acquired territory. In the inscription, dated to AD 1423-24, it is mentioned that the founder of this mosque was Qubli Sultani.The mosque is called so, as it has 16 pillars in the front. It is of vast dimensions and one of the largest mosques of India noted for its architectural style. It consists of a large prayer hall divided into a multitude of aisles by massive circular columns.The roof is crowned by a majestic dome, raised on a high clerestory with windows of perforated screen work in different geometrical patterns. A parapet of pleasing designs above the imposing arcade adds to its beauty. It is an excellent example of the second phase of the Deccani style.Gagan MahalThis was originally built by the Bahmani kings, but later the Barid Shahi rulers made some alterations and additions. The palace has two courts, the outer one apparently was used by the staff and the guards of the palace and the inner one was for the royal ladies. The main building of the palace lies to the south of the inner court, used by the sultan and his harem.Rangeen MahalRangeen Mahal, situated in the fort, near Gumbad Darwaza, is unique because of its decoration with blue coloured Persian tiles and other artwork. Woodcarving done here is not only precious but also unique.The walls of the mahal are adorned with mother-of-pearl of the finest quality inlaid in jet-black stone. Floral patterns and calligraphic text are also depicted here. Stone carving, stucco art are other attractions of this monument. It was rebuilt during Barid Shahi period. The design of this monument represents the blend of both Hindu and Muslim architecture. There are rooms in the basement of the Rangeen Mahal.Tarkash MahalIt is said to have been built for Turkish wife of the sultan. From the remains of the decorative work found in the ornamentation of the walls, it can be said that the mahal was built or extended by the Barid Shahi Sultans who had kept large harem with ladies from different nationalities. The rooms are decorated with stucco work.Takht MahalBuilt by Ahmed Shah, this royal residence was originally decorated with coloured tiles and stone carvings part of which can be seen even today. It has two side royal pavilions with lofty arches and a spacious hall at the back of which lies the sultan's room. The building has stately dimensions and exquisite surface decoration. The coronations of several Bahmanis and Barid Shahi sultans were held there. From the royal pavilion, which is situated behind the throne palace, I had a great view of the valley and low land below.After that leisurely wandering in the fort, I sat and watched some ladies doing a puja, right at the entrance of the fort gate. We chatted along as they broke coconuts, sprinkled haldi kumkum, lighted incense and showered flower petals. I thought the fort richly deserved the worship though they said the ritual was meant for a particular deity.(The author is a documentary filmmaker and travel writer; she blogs atvijayaprataptravelandbeyond.com)"

Ingredients such as pounded rice, organic vegetables and fresh local raw components add that extra flavour to Andhra cuisine, says Mr. Kumar and cites the example of a unique idli -making practice in Ambajipet of Konaseema region. It is called Pottikkal. Fermented idli batter is wrapped in jackfruit leaves in the shape of a cone and steam-cooked. The aroma of jackfruit leaves enhances the flavour of the idli , lending the dish a unique touch, explains Mr. Kumar, informing that the pyramid idli served with ulavacharu (the concentrated extract of horse gram) is very healthy.Method of cookingLeaves and flowers of drumstick, jackfruit and amla which have medicinal value, are also being brought into use. Method of cooking and use of traditional utensils like brass vessels and earthen pots, not seen much these days, is yet another focus area.The recipes thus culled out will be referred to a team of nutritionists for their expert advice and endorsement besides roping in an ayurvedic doctor to present his point of view on the identification of medicinal value of each recipe.After consulting with some of the top chefs in Hyderabad, Mr. Kumar and his team have identified about 30 recipes in different categories.AppetisersIn the appetisers section are delicacies such as Nalleru kada vada (vada made with the stem of Nalleru, a medicinal plant) and kobbari kudumulu (coconunt dumplings): under main course, mulaga puvvu thalimpu (tempered drumstick flower) and arati puvvu-pesara kura (banana flower-green gram curry); cereals- menthe kura-tomato annam (fenugreek leaves-tomato rice) and dampudu biyyam pesara molakala pulao (pulao with hand-pounded rice and green gram sprouts); pulses- Chintha chiguru pappu (dal with tender tamarind leaves) and in the non-vegetarian category dosakai mamsam (meat with yellow cucumber) and sora puttu (a fish delicacy).The team members are on an elaborate exercise of standardising each of these recipes for taste, texture, yield and nutritional balance. The cooked samples will be sent to the National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibrating Laboratories (NABL) to evaluate the amount of carbohydrates, proteins and based on their feedback, the recipes will be further modified if need be.The final details of the recipes will take the form of a book that will be printed and published for public use. The Tourism Authority also plans to host food festivals across the country and cookery contests in the State.We can embrace healthy food with simple tips. Substitute use of sugar with brown sugar, palm jaggery or fruit syrups. For example, Kakinada khaja can be made using sugar syrup made with pineapple juice, banana juice or strawberry juice, he says. Eliminate deep frying which absorbs more oil and take to concealed way of cooking (dum style of cooking). Use more of ingredients like yellow pumpkin, raw banana flowers and stem, drumstick leaves, methi leaves and cow ghee."

CBSE's regional office in Chennai, which takes care of Maharashtra along with southern states (excluding Kerala), refused to share state-specific data for comparison.CBSE Delhi HQ has always shared only region specific data, which give a bird's-eye view, but leaves many questions unanswered. The state specific data was sometimes officially, sometimes unofficially, sourced from respective regional offices. There is no reason assigned by CBSE for refusing to share statewise data, and with every regional office lording over a huge geographical area, there seems to be no problem for people running the show to be answerable.A CBSE school principal said, ""While we can access data related to our students, it will be great to see how different states and even cities are performing. What such data does is that it provides us with benchmarks and helps to analyse indicators through which we can perform better."" Schools have often complained that both Chennai regional office and the Delhi HQ are unresponsive to queries.On the other hand, it is no secret that CBSE is short-staffed in many areas. Never having an 'inspection' mandate meant it did not have presence in every state where its affiliated schools are present. The Chennai regional office looks after a humungous geographical area, including Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Maharashtra and Goa. With zero staff members outside Chennai, CBSE falls short when it comes to speed in responding.A source in the board told TOI that the IT staff, which computes results data and makes it public, have not left office for the last two days. The source added that in such cases tasks are prioritized and releasing data gets missed out.GIRLS BETTER 2016 MARKPass percentageOverall 82.02Girls 87.50 88.58 (2016)Boys 78.0078.85 (2016)Appeared numbersBoys 5,78,961 5,64,213Girls 4,40,399 4,28,443No re-evaluation this yearThe CBSE will not entertain requests for revaluation, starting this year.

5a05dfa79855b76bf13c1857,With love from Hyderabad,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/with-love-from-hyderabad/article18953100.ece,2017-06-10,"This is one of my favourite times of the year. Not because of the promise of rain, but because of the promise of haleem.In some parts of the country, haleem  a superb dish of mashed meat, cracked wheat and a mix of dals  is prepared only during Ramzan. You get it through the year in Delhi, and I do have it at all times, but I always look forward to getting my haleem from Hyderabad, where it is a Ramzan special.Ever since I got to know, a few years ago, that Hyderabads Pista House was couriering haleem to places outside the city during these four weeks, I have been getting my haleem from there.Pista House is a well-known restaurant and bakery in Hyderabad. Though largely known for its sweets and biscuits, its haleem is special.This time, too, I placed my order on an online service for a tub of haleem from Pista House  or I thought I did. Last year, my haleem came in a green tub; this time it was a white bucket. So I looked at it and closely and discovered it was not from Pista House, but from Shah Ghouse, another Hyderabad eatery. I called Pista House and learnt that they werent sending out their haleem this year.But I am not complaining at all about Shah Ghouses haleem. In fact, I thought it was outstanding. The mash was just right  not chewy or stringy, but just thick enough to come up easily on a spoon. I garnished it with fried onions (fried on low heat), slivers of ginger and chopped green chillies. On top of that, I squeezed some lime juice  and it became mouth-wateringly good!I often come across people who ask me how haleem is cooked. So let me give you a basic recipe for the dish (cooked with 500 gm boneless lamb, 1-1/2 cups cracked wheat, 1 tbsp channa dal, 1 tbsp moong dal, 1 tbsp masoor dal  roughly for four people).Rinse and soak the broken wheat and the dals. Let it soak for five hours or so and then drain the water. In a large pot, fry sliced onions in oil or ghee. Add cardamom, cinnamon and clove and fry some more. Add the meat and a pinch of red chilli and turmeric powders. Fry till the oil rises to the top. Now add water and cook till the meat is tender. Once done, mash it well. Now add garam masala, coriander and cumin powders, mint leaves and curd (and a bit of ghee if you wish to) and let it simmer for 10 or 15 minutes. Meanwhile, in another pot, boil the dals and the wheat in 10 cups of water, along with salt, peppercorn and turmeric powder. When done, turn off the heat. Add the meat mix to the dal mix. Now mash it really well with a ladle till its nice and mushy. Put this back on the fire, and let it simmer, stirring now and then, till the dal and meat have really mixed well  say, 45 minutes to an hour. Take it off the heat, and serve with the garnishing of your choice.If you dont want to go through the trouble, just order in! I like my Hyderabad haleem for two reasons. One, it is indeed delicious. The other reason is the ease with which I get it. I log on to gaticonnect.com. There is a band right on top, and I click on haleem (ignoring such attractive lures as jewellery and pearls and health and wellness). It takes me to the haleem page, and I place my order. A kilo is for Rs. 799 (its Rs. 599 if you buy it in Hyderabad).There have been occasions when I have got the consignment on the same night, roughly around 10 or 11 p.m. This time it came a day late, but I did get a notice from Gati to say that it had been delayed. The haleem comes well-packaged. You take it out of the container and its ready to be demolished.Just heat it  and eat it."

The Minister said that directions to take strict action had been given to the Civil Supplies and Legal Metrology departments. Legal measures would be taken too.Inspections had been conducted in rice shops and supermarkets recently. There were eight cases in Thiruvananthapuram alone. The prices of chillies, green gram, Urad dal, gram, and dal had come down significantly.Rices prices had increased, but had been brought under control, the Minister said.With drought damaging crops in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, the two States had turned to Andhra Pradesh, leading to a hike in prices there. This had made its impact felt in Kerala.The Minister said non-subsidised Jaya rice was being sold for Rs. 37.50 a kg. Long-grained Matta rice was being sold for Rs. 40.65 in Ramzan fairs.Slump in pricesPrices of rice and vegetables from Kuttanad had come down.The State government was considering buying onions straight from farms to regulate prices here, Mr. Thilothaman said.The government planned to open Supplyco outlets in all panchayats in the State.

Since there has been good rain so far in many parts of the State, the farming community is also going up for paddy nurseries early, the officials said adding that such activity was only taken up towards mid-July in recent years.Farmers in many parts of Mahbubnagar, Jogulamba-Gadwal, Rangareddy, Sangareddy, Medak, Kamareddy and a few other districts believe that they reap rich harvest if they sow seed of pulses and cash crops such as cotton and soyabean in the first 15 days after the Eruvaka (Mungarau) Pournami, which occurred on June 10 this year.Accordingly, they have taken up the sowing operations in many areas which have received ample precipitation."

Our mind is programmed to rehearse perfect moments, thousands of times. Often, you think of situations from your past, and try to think of ways to make them perfect. Especially arguments, what if you really had the chance to do it? Thats how The Alterant begins.Deepak Karamungikar, author of The Alterant talks about the journey he has embarked on. The story revolves around Jason Hunt, a brilliant PhD candidate in Quantum Physics who has another passion Julia Middlesworth, a Hollywood actress whos past her peak.Originally from Hyderabad, Deepak believes that sentence formation is the greatest of all arts, and theres no joy greater than the one you see in the eyes of someone whos enchanted by your stories. The Alterant is his fourth book. Excerpts:What was an early experience where you learnt that language has power?Growing up, I barely had anyone speaking English with me for purposes other than academics. I learned my English from cricket commentary. Geoffrey Boycott, Tony Greig and Harsha Bhogle were my idols. For him he right sentences at the right time, is almost magic.What do you think makes a good story line?There are two things emotions and surprise. You take any genre comedy, drama, sci-fi, romance or even horror, unless the story evokes emotions in the reader, it is hard to make a lasting impact. Only stories that stir your emotions are remembered. I remember reading Khushwant Singhs stories. After every story, I used to sit quietly and feel the story. Its very important to connect emotionally. Then the element of surprise. I was 11 when I read this book called, No Comebacks by Fredrick Forsyth. That story has the best last line I have ever read in my life. I still feel the punch in my gut. That is why I am a big fan of twists.Give us an insight into your main character. What does he do that makes him different from the rest of the characters?Jason Hunt is a brilliant but an emotional guy. He loves to drink and is passionate about Hollywood actress, Julia Middlesworth. He reveres her. Its not romantic. In spite of never having met her in his life, hes sincere and truthful. His professor loves him and supports him throughout the story. There are times when he has to choose between his mind and heart, he always chooses his heart with no regard to consequences. Jason is borderline idealistic, but physicists cant be idealists. So, theres that dilemma but he does whats right. Hes not greedy.Which was your favourite chapter to write and why?My favorite chapter is the first one. I remember the tension I experienced while I began to write it. Its a sci-fi, time travel novel. Im a nobody. I hadnt studied Physics academically after 10+2. I remember waking up at 4.40 am on the first day in the Virginia winter and just staring at the screen with a cup of tea by my side.All these factors were weighing in heavily as I put my hands on the keyboard. I also had to include what I had left out in the script version. Then suddenly, it began to flow.Is there a specific significance of the book cover?The book cover shows a wormhole, which is a hypothetical connection between widely separated regions of space and time. The story unfolds as Jason traverses through the wormholes."

The matter had been reported to the Deputy Commissioner Ujjwalkumar Ghosh. He directed the concerned authorities to immediately stop the distribution of expired stocks from last week.Around 70,000 expired vegetable oil packets and around 525 kg of green grams with expired dates were seized. Mr. Biradar said the manufactured date mentioned on a few oil packets was December 2016 and on others it was February 2017, valid for four months from the date of packing.Meanwhile, the Divisional Food Laboratory in its report had recorded the oil as sub-standard as the acid value of tested oil is 1.02%. As per the Food Safety and Standards Authority (FSSAI) the acid value should be less than 0.5%, Mr. Biradar added.Similarly, the samples of green gram stocked in godowns were also recorded as sub-standard. The grains contain 6.97% weevilled grain and 1.86% foreign matter, and do not conform to the standards.Vijayanand Diggikar, Assistant Director for Food and Civil Supplies, speaking to The Hindu over the phone said that though the products were expired and lab reports clearly confirmed the samples of vegetable oil and green gram were sub-standard, the samples would be sent to the Food Laboratory in Hyderabad for tests.Based on the lab reports, senior officials would take a further decision."

Unable to handle the devotees frenzy during the distribution of the laddu hours before the immersion of the deity on the 11th day, the Khairatabad Ganesh Utsav Committee is contemplating replacing the giant laddu that adorns Ganesh's left palm with a smaller locally made one or one made of Plaster of Paris.""This year, there will be no giant laddu or Maha Prasadam prepared by PVVS Mallikarjuna Rao , owner of Suruchi Laddu based in Tapeswaram in East Godavari district of Andhra Pradesh. If no local donor comes forward for the preparation of a smaller laddu, we will go with one made of PoP,"" Khairatabad Ganesh Utsav Committee organising secretary S Raj Kumar told STOI.From the year 2010, Mallikarjuna Rao has been offering the Khairatabad Ganesha the Maha Prasadam that came to be known as the Tapeswaram Laddu. Until 2009, the organizers used to offer a laddu that was no more than 10 kg. Apparently, the laddumaker from East Godavari had visited the Khairatabad Ganesha in 2009 wherein his daughter wondered as to why should the sweet offering to a giant Ganesha be such a small one. Taken in by her observation, Mallikarjuna approached the organisers and offered to donate a big laddu to the deity from then on. The bonanza for the devotees of the elephant god began in 2010. Beginning with a 500 kg laddu that year, Mallikarjuna Rao increased the quantity to 2,400 kg in 2011 to 6,000 kg in 2015. For the donor, making the laddu was a humungous task and a costly one too. The 6,000 kg laddu needed 2,600 kg of sugar, 1,500 kg of ghee, 1,500 kg of bengal gram, 200 kg of cashewnuts, 200 kg of badam, 30 kg of cardamom and cost him a whopping Rs 18 lakh.But by then, the scramble for a piece of the Maha Prasadam turned into a law and order problem, leading to lathicharge on a few occasions during the distribution of the laddu before the immersion. Devotees would assemble by midnight and stand in queues to have the laddu. Besides, in 2013, incessant rains damaged the laddu leading to it being dumped in Hussainsagar. With both the police and organizers pleading helplessness, Mallikarjuna Rao decided to trim the size of the laddu and donated a 500 kg laddu in 2016.For 2017, the committee is scouting for a city-based sweet maker who would come forward and donate the laddu, though not of the size that Mallikarjuna Rao used to offer. If nothing works out, devotees would have to do with a PoP laddu sitting on the Ganesha's left palm. In any case, from now on, the giant Khairatabad Ganesh would make his annual appearance but the giant laddu has taken the bow."

5a0f0ba39855b76bf13d5760,‘Onion shortage for 15 more days’,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170812/jsp/odisha/story_166872.jsp,2017-08-12,"Caption There is a hue and cry over shortage of onions in the market. What is your department doing to address the issue? The states requirement of onion per annum is 5.5 lakh tonnes. We produce onion in only four districts  Nuapada, Balangir, Kalahandi and a part of Nabarangpur. We also produce some onion at Puruna Cuttack, which is located between Boudh and Phulbani. Despite all our efforts, the production of onion remains 1.5 lakh tonne per annum. We cannot preserve it for a long time. We have already exhausted our stock. To meet the shortfall of 4.5 lakh tonnes, we have to depend on Nashik in Maharashtra, Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh and also on Madhya Pradesh. But the damage to crops following floods in Maharashtra, onion produced in the interior parts of the state could not come. To check farmer suicides, the Maharashtra government started procuring onion at a higher price. So, only a few options are left for our traders to procure onion at a lower and competitive price. Sometimes our traders have had to buy onion at Rs 24 to Rs 26 a kg. I asked the traders and my department officials to sell onion with a profit margin of just Re 1, which will meet the transportation and preservation costs. How long will the shortage persist? It may take another 15 days. One cant store onion, as it is a perishable commodity. So there can be no hoarding. I have already sent a message to everybody that the government would take strong action if they do any mischief. Now, the businessmen have started cooperating with the department. Is it not an irony that despite the fact that we do not produce sufficient onion, our farmers had to resort to distress sale? Yes, there was distress sale. This was due to the fact that onion from neighbouring Madhya Pradesh where it was selling for Rs 2 per kg flooded our markets. The traders from Madhya Pradesh also asked our farmers to sell the onion at that price. However, we intervened and brought the onion price to Rs 7 per kg. But we cannot preserve it for long. Why dont you implement the Market Intervention System to rescue farmers? For market intervention, there has to be a consensus between the Centre and the state government as the price will be shared in the ratio of 50:50. We have already announced MIS for mung and biri dal. Two days ago, I told the officials that groundnut should be purchased at Rs 42.20 per kg. In the case of onion, they did not agree. Onion cultivation is not confined to Odisha but spread over many states. The governments failure to build a chain of cold storage may be one of the factors that has led to the distress sale... That is a wrong notion. We have nearly 42 cold stores in the private sector across the state. Besides, we have nearly seven cold stores around the capital city. A number of cold storages are there in Berhampur, my hometown. We have 24 cold stores in a bad condition. When the proposal came to me for their repair, I strongly suggested that these units be privatised. Let the private party undertake repairs and do business. The business cannot be run by the government. Every year, we face distress sale of various agricultural produce. How can this problem be solved? Everything is related to demand and supply. If suddenly there is excess supply, the prices will plummet and it becomes difficult to arrest it. Thats the time the government needs to intervene. We are doing so now. In the case of paddy, we have decided whatever the quantity of rice produced in our state, we will procure it from the farmers. Last year, we procured 56 lakh metric tonnes of rice. I have asked the primary agriculture societies to purchase paddy from the sharecroppers. What will you do with so much of surplus rice? Under the food security programme, we are giving 5 kg of rice per head. We will use up 30 lakh metric tonnes of rice under the programme. The rest of the rice will be procured by the Food Corporation of India. We also export rice to Punjab, Haryana, Jharkhand, Bihar and Karnataka. We are the third largest producer of rice in the country. You are part of a ministerial committee that discussed the issue of sharecroppers being given certain rights vis-a-vis the landowners. When will committees report be ready? Nearly 90 per cent landowners give their land to sharecroppers for farming. There is a fear among landowners that if they declare that they are leasing out land for cultivation purpose, their land will be taken away. Keeping this concern in mind, we are now emphasising on real cultivators. But as the issue is a controversial one, we have to secure the interest of the sharecroppers as well as farmers. It will take some more time to resolve the issue. You have staged a came back to the ministry. Earlier, a section of leaders from Ganjam claimed that they had lobbied for your inclusion in the government. Its the prerogative of the chief minister to pick up people for inclusion in the ministry. He also decides who he will use for party work and other purposes. When I was not in the ministry, he had used my services extensively in west Odisha and other parts of the state for the partys work. I never felt for a moment that I was out of favour with Naveen babu. Later, he brought me back to the ministry. Lobbying does not work. BJP national president Amit Shah launched his party programme Mo Booth Sabuthu Majboot (My booth is the strongest) from Ganjam. Your party must have been worried. BJP is a national party and it has formed the government at the Centre. The party has also formed governments in a number of states. Now, they are facing anti-incumbency in Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and other states. They have already lost Punjab and managed to form government in Goa. They are in alliance in Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and some other parts of the country. They are making efforts to enter newer areas. Now, they have set eyes on Odisha, Bengal and some other states. They are making all-out efforts to strengthen their organisational base. But, they will not be successful in Odisha as long as Naveen babu is here. But the anti-establishment factor also works against the BJD. No. We are taking up need-based programmes for development of the people. Naveens image is imprinted in the minds of people. Earlier, you equated Naveen babu as lord Krishna who drives the chariot (state) and Pyari Mohan Mohapatra as Arjun, who shoots the arrows. After Pyari Mohan, who is the Arjun now in the party? After the Mahabharat war was over all the Pandavas started claiming that they had defeated the Kauravas. But one Belalasena said he had seen only a wheel chopping off heads. Similarly, here Naveen babu is Krishna and there is no need for Arjuna as this war is different from the Mahabharat battle. What is the major challenge for the party in 2019? The Congress is almost a spent force. The space vacated by it is now being filled up by the BJP. Many Congress leaders are joining the BJP in the hope of getting a ticket. They are also spreading their network. Despite BJP emerging as a challenge, they will be no match for Naveen babus image and our programmes for the people. What do you consider more important: loyalty to the party leader (Naveen Patnaik) or efficiency at work? Both loyalty and hard work are required to be successful."

This was informed by Vice-Chancellor (VC) of the agriculture university, SN Pasupalak on Thursday.Addressing a gathering on the occasion of 56th Foundation Day of the institution, the VC said NRSC will provide farmers under OUAT exact information on farm land status and water availability besides, conducive weather condition to help them plan agriculture works and water resource management.This apart, the Centre would train young scientists from different disciplines of the university for follow up satellite data for integrated use of geospatial tools with crop models and in-situ observation network for timely crop production forecast, drought assessment and monitoring.Addressing the gathering, Governor and Chancellor of Universities SC Jamir said, agriculture has largely been seen as a development sector, for managing poverty, not for creating wealth. For agriculture to move away from being seen as just a billion mouths to feed, it must start modernising agriculture, from farm to the table and with supporting agro-industrial development, he said. Jamir also inaugurated a rooftop solar plant of 815 kw and a water harvesting system on the OUAT premises.Agriculture Minister Damodar Rout stressed upon using indigenous seed varieties and technologies for development of a sustainable agriculture system.Pasupalak informed that OUAT will soon set up Atal Incubation Centre to foster budding agri-entrepreneurs in the field of agriculture and allied areas and steps have also been initiated to establish community radio stations in each of the 31 Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVKs) of OUAT to disseminate real time information within 1,015 km radius. Besides, efforts are on to develop cold and weed resistance pulse varieties and the State Government has sanctioned `2.25 crore for research in this regard. Under the project, five different pulses including green gram, red lentil, black gram, peas and fava beans will be cultivated in farms after paddy harvesting is completed. The university has also decided to increase number of pulse seed hubs from seven to 11 districts.On the occasion, the KVK at Gajapati was awarded as the best KVK and Laxmipriya Pradhan of KVK-Keonjhar was felicitated as the best extension scientist."
5a12bcd79855b76bf13e18e3,Satellite imagery to the aid of sons of soil,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/satellite-imagery-to-the-aid-of-sons-of-soil/article19568467.ece,2017-08-27,"Can a mix of satellite imagery, artificial intelligence, Internet of things, and big data analytics come down to earth in aid of the sons of soil? Can it help farmers to get bank loans, timely and correct insurance claims, may be even ensure a good MSP (minimum support price) for their crop?A handful of space entrepreneurs, aged around 30 or less, worked on it and created a map-based digital framework or dashboard over the last 18 months to show that it can.Abhishek Raju, SatSure Ltd.s directorAsia, and Prateep Basu, chief operating officer, who founded the company, say that by marrying satellite imagery-based information with ground data, they hope to improve the livelihood of farmers without directly working with them.By reducing the risks associated with Indias weather-based farming, their solution, they say, should make it easier for the farmer to earn more; and get agricultural credit and insurance and its settlement at the right time. In the bargain, the government spends less on insurance premium doles; and agriculture insurance companies make less payouts. And it can work as a scientific basis for fixing MSPs.Collating dataStarting in early 2016, a bunch from SatSure worked their home Internet over six months to pull data from Indian and European satellites and old imageries from the U.S. Landsat. They keyed in latitudes and longitudes of little known places across the country to stack them up with local socio-economic data. To this they added mandi-level commodity prices down to a piece of land, potential prices, and historical rates.SatSure, with its bases in London, Switzerland, and data centres in Dubai, now has a humungous 1.5 petabytes of data, says Mr. Basu. We are easily the first in India to do satellite data integration on a Hadoop-based system and large area analytics.Last year, they began their pilot over a total of 250 hectares in Andhra Pradeshs Srikakulam district. They randomly chose different crops grown on farmlands measuring 20 to 30 acres each. Different mixes of fertilizer and water were tried out. At the end of the 2016 seasons  the summer kharif and the winter rabi  they could predict crop yields that were 85 to 90% accurate. It is an ongoing work and this has been now fine-tuned to 95%. Conventional or manual estimates are said to be less than 80%, they say.Forecasting crop yieldsHow does an accurate forecast of crop yields help the farmer or anyone else? Mr. Raju points out that not just the farmer but every stakeholder needs to know in advance the fate of the crop sown: the bank that lends him money for seeds and materials; the government that pays crop insurance premiums and announces MSPs; and the insurance agency that must pay the farmer if his crop fails.In July, the Comptroller and Auditor General picked holes in the implementation of agricultural insurance scheme during 201116 and pointed out delays in settling 84.5 lakh claims amounting to Rs. 14,000 crore. It said farmers did not get the full benefit of the Rs. 36,000 crore-plus that the Union and State governments had given out towards crop insurance premium subsidies.SatSures Google Earth-like navigable online dashboard will be customised and offered to users such as district collectors or deputy commissioners, decision makers, crop insurance companies, banks, and large single farmers.The dashboard, they explain, becomes the decision makers tool for interpreting yields assessed a month ahead of harvest, crop health, acreage, and planning the commodity logistics. Next, we will be working with insurance agencies on how many and where to do crop cutting experiments, how banks can use the data to give credit worthiness scores to farmers.Mr. Raju notes that the new Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana wants agencies to use technologies such as satellite remote sensing, ICT, and mobile phones to read risks and settle farmers claims quickly.Today, the two say, next-gen children of farmers are aware, use smartphones and understand modern solutions to their problems.Apart from its Andhra Pradesh activity and working with private farms in Kolar and Mandya in Karnataka, SatSure is partnering a crop insurance project in Gujarat and also in the Marathwada region of Maharashtra."
5a10b4809855b76bf13d9c43,Shortage looms as ‘Sona Masuri’ not sown in Tungabhadra area this year,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/shortage-looms-as-sona-masuri-not-sown-in-tungabhadra-area-this-year/article19572749.ece,2017-08-28,"Perhaps for the first time in history, the Department of Water Resources has not released water from Tungabhadra reservoir to the command area for even the first crop this year. As a result, the vast cultivation area of the premium Sona Masuri rice brand here has remained unsown.The water crisis, affecting around 20 lakh farmers and labourers in the command area, is likely to trigger a migration. There are also fears it could lead to a serious shortage of this high-quality rice in the market.Consumers in Karnataka, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and other parts of the country, as well as those in Singapore, Dubai and Sri Lanka, are likely to be hit as the rice variety grown in the Tungabhadra belt is of high quality and is sought after.At present, the reservoir has 57 tmcft of water, against its capacity of 133 tmcft. This includes 32 tmcft of slit accumulated over the past 50 years. Considering the evaporation losses, drinking water requirements, and the share of undivided Andhra Pradesh, hardly 35 tmcft of water will be left in the reservoir for the States irrigation. Given the poor inflow, the reservoir cannot meet the demand of 80 tmcft for taking up paddy cultivation on around 6 lakh acres spread over three districts  Ballari, Koppal and Raichur.Water releaseAccording to sources in the Department of Water Resources, water will be released into the canals in the first week of September for farmers to cultivate rabi crops such as chickpea, green gram, sunflower and sorghum, which require relatively less water. The Tungabhadra Irrigation Consultative Committee (TICC) is scheduled to meet in Bengaluru on Tuesday to finalise the schedule and amount of water to be released from the reservoir.In 2016-17, which witnessed the lowest inflow, water was provided with difficulty for kharif crops. Paddy growers then managed to scrape through before the closure of canals, but cotton and chilli growers suffered Going by that experience and the reduced inflow to the dam in August, farmers are not taking any risks. Meanwhile, the TICC has been very cautious in releasing water into the canals as top priority is being given to overcoming the looming drinking water crisis.Furthermore, farmers who have grown paddy plants for the purpose of selling them to other farmers for transplantation are feeling the heat as their saplings are growing old in nursery beds with no buyers."
5a11510b9855b76bf13df5af,'Fund must for education',https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170909/jsp/odisha/story_171791.jsp,2017-09-09,"The state's eminent academics and the chancellor (governor) have time and again raised concern over the standard of education in Odisha. How do you think Odisha University of Agriculture and Technology (OUAT) is faring? The higher education system entirely depends on the school education system. If you have a good school education system, then we are good. But that is lacking. We are fortunate that we get students through the examination system, which stresses on career. Our students have done well in the Junior Research Fellowship. Now, we stand eighth among all state agriculture universities in the country. Our position is 11th if we include deemed universities Being a premier university in agriculture, has OUAT been successful in transferring the technology from laboratories to land? We have 31 Krishi Vigyan Kendras that play the role of a catalyst in transferring the technology to the field across the state. We signed an MOU with the National Remote Sensing Centre, Hyderabad, to use satellite data for real-time agricultural monitoring. It will help farmers plan by providing exact information on land and water availability. Besides, it can give accurate weather forecast. The centre will train young scientists from various disciplines in the use of satellite data for agriculture along with drought assessment and monitoring. We have also inked an MoU with Philippines-based International Rice Research Institute for production of high nutritional paddy seed in the state. We have developed stress-tolerant rice varieties that are performing exceptionally well under the adverse effects of climate change such as flooding, drought and salinity. We have signed MoUs with five institutions of international repute like the International Livestock Research Institute for production of feed and fodder. It will look into the issue of fodder supply and demand, improve feeding practices and building capacity of key players. Are there any more MoUs in the pipeline? We have initiated efforts for an agreement with the Software Technology Parks of India to introduce IT-enabled agriculture. It will provide an opportunity to farmers to get smart agriculture services. It will give ample scope to farmers to adopt best practices to get maximum yield with minimum manpower and less investment. We are focusing on giving market linkage through agri enterpreneuership. But what has been the contribution of OUAT to the state so far? It's the only agriculture university that deals with a wide range of subjects. It has made quite an intervention in the livelihood of the common man. We have produced more than 151 varieties of crops, including different varieties of paddy such as Lalat, Khandagiri, Parijata, Konark and Surendra. Because of this, we have become a surplus state in rice production. What are the projects that university is undertaking at this moment? We are focusing on developing cold and weed resistant pulse varieties. Under the project, five pulses such as green gram, red lentil, black gram, peas and fava beans will be cultivated in farms after paddy harvest. We have been successful in our interventions in maize, ginger, chilli, sunflower and mustard. The students are now being provided with training about hybrid maize production, rose, honey, mushroom cultivation and packaging and marketing, milk and fish cultivation. Are you satisfied with OUAT's research and development compared to other universities? One should not indulge in comparisons. The research activities undertaken at OUAT are marvellous compared to the money we have invested in them. We didn't have any contingency to undertake critical research work. Now, the state government increased our budgetary provision by 35 per cent after we raised the issue. We also have nearly 96 vacancies in the faculties despite the posts being sanctioned a decade ago. The workload has increased and many new research fields are opening up and we will certainly go ahead in the coming days. The OUAT has nearly 5,500 students. Do you have any plans to set up a second campus? We have not thought about a second campus. We have our 11 constituent colleges across the state in agriculture, engineering and horticulture. But we are acquiring space to improve the existing infrastructure here. The chief minister recently laid the foundation stone of various infrastructure projects, including new classrooms and examination hall of the college of forestry. He also visited the organic mushroom centre and the students' maize research fields and interacted with them on how the outcome of the research could be utilised by the farmers. The Assembly passed the OUAT Amendment Bill in 2013 to accord affiliation to private institutions for imparting education in agriculture. How many private institutions have applied for affiliation? Not a single one. Do you think we should encourage private institutions? In the changing world scenario, huge investment and infrastructure is required for the improvement of education. The government cannot do it alone. At the same time, the government has the mechanism to control and regulate faculty members to ensure that the quality of education is not compromised. In the 2012 annual budget, the Centre had announced Rs 50 crore to OUAT. Did you receive all the funds? So far, we have received only Rs 12 crore. However, I will not comment on the past. We have an agriculture university as well as a Central Rice Research Institute (Cuttack) in the state. But why has there not been a green revolution in Odisha like Punjab? To make significant progress in agriculture, we should have three basic things - enough irrigation, adequate fertilisers and assured supply of power. Besides, we also need funds. After Independence, Punjab got huge funds from the Centre. They have all the three things mentioned above. Agriculture in Odisha is a victim of natural hazards. But things have started taking off. After the second green revolution, we have surpassed many in the field of rice production and in some other sectors. The vice-chancellor of Ravenshaw University has stirred up a controversy by pointing fingers at unnecessary political interventions in university administration. What about you? Not at all. We had no election last time and there are no elections this time as well as the students are busy building their careers. With no elections, our atmosphere is peaceful. Yesterday you had been invited to share your thoughts on the Mahanadi river dispute. How serious is the problem? I am raising the issue as an agro-meteorologist and not as an Odia - man has exclusive right over water. For the cause of industrial growth of one state, one cannot give up water, which is crucial to the livelihood of lakhs of people. If the flow of water in the Mahanadi is checked, the surface water level in various parts of the state will go down and it will have a serious impact on the ecosystem and livelihood of people as well as the climate. You are closely associated with the farming sector. Experts are of the view that the government's Re 1 per kg rice scheme has made people lethargic and it its difficult to find labourers for agricultural activities. In a welfare state, the basic duty of the government is to adopt a food security policy for its citizens and to ensure that there is no starvation death. From that point of view, the government has done the right thing. That people are becoming lethargic is a social issue. What would you have been had you not been a teacher? Since my childhood I had thought of becoming a teacher. It's my dream that has been fulfilled with God's grace."
5a10fbb29855b76bf13db57c,From forest to runway,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-mumbai/from-forest-to-runway/article19674546.ece,2017-09-13,"For centuries, the forests have fed the ancestors of weavers Gorre Shankaraiah (48) and his elder brother Gorre Bapu (56). Until recently, members of the family (which resides in Mahadevpur, Telangana), would head to the Kawal forest (in Adilabad) to pick discarded cocoons fallen on the forest floor.Now, the Gorre brothers source the raw material from societies who mostly buy them from Kolam tribals. Though covered with twigs and dirt, the tribals keen eyes spot the oblong, beige cocoons with an exit hole  the moths have taken flight.Unlike regular pure silk, where live cocoons are boiled to extract pure tussar, Madhepur gicha tussar is made with double spun strands from empty cocoons, which are then stuck together to create strong silk yarn. The resulting material has a slubby texture and a natural sheen.The silk routeCut to Lakm Fashion Week Winter/Festive 2017 last month. For Hyderabad-based designer Divya Reddys collection, Sage, actor and showstopper Taapsee Pannu wore a floor-length, long-sleeved, intricately embellished pure Madhepur pink tussar jacket over a sheer embroidered piece and a pair of gicha trousers.Reddy was introduced to this tussar almost 16 years ago, when she wore her mother Vanaja Reddy Sallas sari. It was beige with a black border. This tussar is an any-weather fabric; it keeps you warm in the winter and cool in the summer, says the 32-year-old.Reddys love for handloom grew under Sallas tutelage (who worked with weavers to design saris for personal use), and she started working with Madhepur tussar in 2016. For the LFW Spring Summer line this year, she also experimented with konda patti (wild mountain cotton), sourced from the jungles of Adilabad.Reddy returned home just to work with the Gorre brothers, who had resisted quitting the trade and migrating. Once a village of 40 looms, it had been reduced to nought as they had no finances to source cocoons, weave and wait for money to come in. So they had started gathering cocoons for sale.Today, after tying up with Reddy, you can hear the clackling of 25 looms in the village. Many weavers have turned farm hands, helping raise jowar , chilli and moong . But their hands are meant to weave, just like our ancestors did. The right pricing and government support is all we need, says Shankaraiah.Natural huesMeanwhile, Reddy says a few belts of untouched forests still exist in Telangana. Care is taken to ensure that only whats on the floor is collected, says the designer, who has also tied up with 25 families in the area to raise konda patti cotton on arid land. Its advantageous because it has been weathered by the sun and rain. It doesnt need treatment and lasts longer,  she adds.Usually, both the cotton and silk are used in their natural shades  beige for silk and off-white for cotton. Of late, weve worked to create natural dyes using vegetables, fruits, seeds, barks, medicinal herbs, and even a blue-coloured root, she says. But Shankaraiah loves the natural colour of tussar best. It has a shine that you have to see to believe, he shares.People powerThe designer, who has seen people specifically asking for Madhepur tussar and konda patti cotton, says the goal is to make them popular enough to get at least 500 cotton farmers and weavers to resume the work and sustain it, whether or not a designer backs them.She has found support from the Telangana Government in her attempt to aid reverse migration. But the biggest boost, she states, is when weavers see their creations on the ramp. When Shankaraiah saw what Taapsee wore, he said if they could get support, he would get all his cousins back to weaving, she says.Reddy is now working on a dailywear collection for Design One, to be held in Mumbai on September 21 and 22. In the Rs. 8,000 to Rs. 25,000 range, will feature both Madhepur tussar andkonda patticotton, she concludes.Details: divya@divyareddydesign.inMadhepur tussar is an any-weather fabric; it keeps you warm in the winter and cool in the summerdivya reddy"
5a147ec59855b76bf13e4d79,Respect women is the message of Bathukamma,http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/hyderabad/2017/sep/22/respect-women-is-the-message-of-bathukamma-1661265.html,2017-09-22,"HYDERABAD: Her phone buzzed incessantly as she jotted down to-do list on one hand and instructed her assistants on the other. All this, while addressing us on Bathukamma, a floral festival of Telangana nativity and its significance. Her hot green tea in a grey ceramic mug was getting cold but not her energy levels. Kavitha Kalvakuntla, Member of Parliament from Nizamabad district and founder of Telangana Jagruthi is a proof why women are called true multitaskers.Humming her favourite Bathukamma song, she says that this colourful festival is close to her heart and singing those songs during the festival is her favourite part of the nine-day long festival. Unlike every year where 12 Bathukamma songs get released, this year they released 60 songs by 12 artistes.Just like how dialect changes every 100 kilometres, songs too vary in every part of Telangana. Reflecting the soul of every area of Telanganas folklore is the list of songs released this year. Usually, the priest performs the rituals and others just worship. This is a folk festival, where everyone knows the song, participates and adds his or her own version to it, which becomes an extension of the festival. Keeping this in mind, we focused on the songs, besides the other needful arrangements, she informs.Generally in Telangana, people are more inclined towards Lord Shiva and Goddess. The songs are also based on them. It is close to our hearts because it is a semi-religious festival. There is no restriction and limitations, she shares while adding why the almost faded festival needed a revival. Kavitha says she is cool with Bathukamma song being remixed and played at parties. Caste issues or discrimination was not the reason for the destruction of this festival. The influence of globalisation and Andhra rule made Bathukamma take a back-step. Thanks to Telangana movement, the festival regained its glory, she rejoices.The way poetry was used during French Revolution, Kavitha used this folklore festival Bathukamma during Telangana separate state revolution. There were many revolutions in the world that failed because culture was not made a part of it. When I started Telangana Jagruthi in 2006, I started to work with Telangana rural women, who were not sanctioned loans by the banks. I realised we should pick up a point that would rally thousands of women into the movement. I was looking for a thread that could connect all the women.Taking inspiration from Bal Gangadhar Tilak, I programmed Bathukamma. Women taking up Bathukamma communicated that they were fighting for a separate state. Bathukamma and Bonalu became symbols of protest and not just festivals. Today, it is a celebration, she beams. We made Bonalu our state festival and our financial commitment is with it, she adds smiling.Last year, Kavitha travelled to nine countries to promote the importance of this floral festival but this year, she confines herself to attending Bathukamma events in Hyderabad.Going down the memory lane, Kavitha says she has fond recollection of celebrating the festival in her village along with her grandmother. Every year, we used to be off to the village for nine days. Wed enjoy watching the festival and even took part in the activities until my grandmother was alive, she smiles and also adds that the vacuum her her grandmother left was filled through the floral festivities.Kavitha was going viral not just on vernacular media but also on national media during Rakshabandhan for promoting the idea of gifting helmets to brothers. Speaking about the idea, Kavitha says, It was not my idea. I just promoted it as I liked it. A kid called Vamsi made a video saying, if sisters gift helmets to brothers, they will think twice to take it off or forget to wear it. I wanted to launch this on my brothers birthday, so I waited for it. It was a surprise for him too. I am glad, it made a difference on a national level, she laughs.Would she like to attach a cause to Bathukamma too? Pat comes the reply, There are already plenty of causes attached to Bathukamma. Teamwork, unity, protection of water bodies, protection of the environment, and of course enjoying every moment of life. The intrinsic message is being sensitive and respectful towards women and it begins at home. Women empowerment starts at home, enlightens the first women MP from Telangana.Africans are the oldest being on the planet. They danced around a centrally placed force. It could be fire or flowers. The same thing applies Bathukamma. They sing and dance in the circular motion around the force called  Shakthi. The format of the festival shows that it is an age-old festival, although we cannot determine the day it started, she shares while speaking about the history of Bathukamma. It is a and nice and fun festival yaar! she says. How does she see the role of men in the festival? Their role is in bringing the flowers and carrying it when it gets heavy and helping the same throw in the lake if the shore of the lake is slippery or broken. I dont have many Bathukamma memories with Ram anna (KTR). Earlier, holidays were given during Sankranthi and not during Dussera. I used to take leave and go with my parents but he used to study in a hostel and wouldnt make it to the festival often, the sister shares.Talking about the special food prepared during the festival, she says the home-grown items like corn, moong dal is prepared. In the folk culture, people treat God as one among of them. According to them, God eats what we do and does what we do. Thus the food consumed by us is offered to the God too. Malidha Muddalu, made of roti and jaggery is the special dish prepared during Bathukamma.On the ninth day, they offer saddhannam. It is nine varieties of rice items like curd rice etc because it can sustain for long. The significance is, we are sending the goddess back, so we are giving her food that doesnt perish immediately, she explains passionately also adding that her personal favourite is makka garalu (corn vadas).Her vision for Bathukamma is to make it popular like Onam or any other state festival. When people think of Kerala, they think of Onam. I want to live the day when people associate Telangana with Bathukamma, she concludes."
5a145c879855b76bf13e3905,Kharif foodgrain output may fall 2.78%: Govt estimates,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/kharif-foodgrain-output-may-fall-2-78-govt-estimates/articleshow/60837520.cms,2017-09-26,"NEW DELHI: India's summer-sown foodgrain production is likely to fall nearly 3 per cent , dashing hopes of higher farm income, because of erratic rainfall and farmers shifting to other remunerative crops.Output of kharif, or summer-sown crops, is expected to fall to 134.67 million tonnes from the record 138.52 million tonnes last year, a fall of 2.8 per cent , according to the government's first formal estimate of the harvest. It makes four 'advance estimates' in the course of the year.This is expected to hit rural incomes in some areas, although the government said the harvest of 134.67 million tonnes, estimated with the help of inputs from states and other sources, would still be 5 per cent higher than the five-year average of 128.24 million tonnes.""The country has adequate stock of foodgrain. So on food security front, there is nothing to worry about. But farmers in rain-fed areas may be hard-hit and their income might go down if prices don't recover,"" said former agriculture secretary Siraj Hussain.He said lower production may hit rural economy and buying capacity of farmers. ""The government has to ensure farmer gets minimum support price for pulses, soyabean and cotton . Also, a stable trading regime needs to be ensured for commodity prices to recover.""Experts said food prices are likely to remain steady. This year's monsoon is about 5 per cent below average, but some parts of the country were flooded while others were relatively dry, hurting kharif output.However, the recent surge in rainfall will help the winter-sown, or rabi, crop because of good soil moisture and more water in reservoirs.Production of rice, the main kharif crop, is estimated to be 94.48 million tonnes, or 1.98 per cent less than the previous year. There was a small drop in paddy acreage, to 37.68 million hectares from 38.18 million hectares a year earlier, on account of deficient rains in a number of districts in Chhattisgarh , Telangana, Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka.""Rice is one commodity in which we have been self-sufficient since 1991-92,"" grain analyst Tejinder Narang said. ""There are unlikely to be a spike in prices. In winter, planting of rice will take place in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana which can make up the deficit.""Output of kharif pulses such as tur, moong and urad is estimated at 8.71million tonnes against 9.42 million tonnes last year. The ministry cited a shift by farmers to more remunerative crops like sugarcane and cotton for this 7.5 per cent fall in production.Lokesh Goenka, managing director of U Goenka Sons that trades in agriculture commodities, said this would have no major impact on prices in the short run. Area under pulses this season was 14.12 million hectares, 3.47 per cent less than last year.Production of oilseeds such as groundnut, soyabean and castorseed is estimated to decrease by 7.68 per cent over the previous year to 20.68 million tonnes, with farmers shifting to urad, sugarcane and cotton on expectation of higher profitability, the government said.Solvent Extractors' Association of India president Atul Chaturvedi said the Indian farmer was losing interest in the oilseed crop as it was not remunerative compared with others.Sugarcane production is estimated at 337.69 million tonnes, higher by 30.97 million tonnes than the last year. Area under sugarcane has increased by 9.4 per cent .According to Abinash Verma, director-general of Indian Sugar Mills Association, ""The government's estimates are very similar to ISMA's which was 340-345 million tonnes. ""Despite an 18.68 per cent increase in area coverage this season, lower productivity of cotton has resulted in reduced estimated production of 32.27 million bales (of 170 kg each) as compared to 33.09 million bales in 2016-17, said the ministry."

Traders take Telangana cotton farmers for a ride,http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/telangana/2017/oct/26/what-msp-traders-take-telangana-cotton-farmers-for-a-ride-1683358.html,2017-10-26,"HYDERABAD: Despite the Centre and State governments tall claims of being pro-farmers, they are unable to ensure that Minimum Support Prices (MSP) promised by them are provided to farmers. Cotton farmers in northern Telangana are having a tough time getting sufficient compensation for their produce.Though the Cotton Corporation of India (CCI) has fixed the MSP at Rs 4,320 per quintal, traders are paying anywhere between Rs 1,500 and Rs 3,500 depending upon the quality of cotton.Traders blame it on poor quality of produce, thanks to unseasonal rains that destroyed large areas of cotton crop in the region.Enumamula market yard, the second-largest in Asia, is usually packed with cotton bags around this time of the year. However, when Express visited the yard on Monday, only a few thousand bags had arrived. Farmers, who lost most of their crop to rains, brought the remaining damaged cotton to market hoping to recover at least a part of what they invested.They are bringing wet, blackish cotton, claimed a trader. We cannot pay them much for this. We will have a tough time scouting for people who would buy such low quality cotton.Farmers claim their produce isnt that bad and traders were taking advantage of situation. My cotton is slightly above the prescribed natural moisture content percentage fixed by CCI. But traders are not ready to accept that fact, says T Ramesh of Arepally village in Warangal Urban mandal. They are paying us just Rs 2,500 per quintal. This is even lesser than what we invested.Money spent to cultivate cotton has drastically increased, as input costs and labour charges have risen four fold. This has made it harder for farmers who are now making losses. Earlier, farmers had demanded that CCI increase moisture content percentrage from 8-12 pc to 20 pc.Its not just cotton, even grain farmers claim they do not get MSP. Farmers in Warangal cultivated 24,000 acres of green gram this sowing season. However, the produce is being sold for as less as Rs 3000-Rs 4000 per quintal when the MSP is Rs 5,575 per quintal. We have invested Rs 10,000 per acre but got only 2 quintal yield. Adding to it, traders are offering lesser than the MSP, said K Narasaiah.The Telangana State Co-Operative Marketing Federation  Markfed  has setup one procurement centre in the market yard here, but has purchased only 50 quintals this season. Farmers are now pleading the state to ensure purchase of their produce at MSP.The CCI is also not buying cotton with moisture content over permissible limits. This would be a huge loss for us, explained a CCI official. Farmers, officials claimed, prefer selling their produce to traders than government agencies.For CCI or Markfed to procure their produce, they have to produce their pass book and Aadhaar details. They have to wait 15-20 days for the money. Its only when they do not get the MSP from traders that they come to us, said a Markfed official.Experts say MSP is a misleading concept as traders never buy produce at fixed rates. It varies depending on market price on a given day. Farmers lack resources to store their goods and wait for prices to increase. As a result, farmers who have taken loans are selling their produce at throwaway prices.Release insurance amount to farmersAgriculture secretary C Parthasarathi requested insurance companies to see that crop insurance amount is released to farmers, immediately. At a meeting with representatives of insurance companies at Secretariat on Wednesday, Parthasarthi wanted them to release crop insurance claim amounts for Kharif season and transfer the money into the accounts of individual farmers. For this, the bankers wanted some more time.Increase permissible moisture content: FarmersCotton farmers led by Congress and Rythu Sangam leaders on Wednesday protested in front of market yard demanding that government increase moisture content criterion in cotton from existing 8 to 12 pc to 20 pc. Ryots said natural moisture percentage in cotton was 16 and it was difficult for them to bring it down to eight. TPCC general secretary G Sujatha launched hunger strike demanding government increase moisture content criterion to 12 per cent."

And it did the city a lot of good. Of course it brought with it the much-need international visibility and perked up its promising startup sector with a booster shot of probable investments; but that wasnt what GES will be remembered for, for many years to come. At least not among the ordinary Hyderabadi janata who despite being kept miles away from the epicenter of all the action, was only too glad that the mega event had travelled to mana sheher. And why wouldnt they. After all it was courtesy GES and its VVIP invitee Ivanka Trump that they found some respite from acrobatically maneuvering through potholed roads that had been rudely stripped off its wafer-thin tar clothes, since the time monsoon unleashed itself on the land of Nizams. And if that wasnt joyous enough, they even found their otherwise concrete jungles sporting bursts of green as the civic authorities went out of their way to beautify medians of arterial roads with humungous flower pots. So what if the sight of a majority of them  painted in deadly shades of pink and yellow -- was jarring and repulsive. At least they broke the monotony, right? It spent Rs 44 crore or more on this beautification drive, which also included clearing the streets of beggars!While given the gravity of the meet, one would have imagined that the deliberations between leading entrepreneurs, industry bigwigs and state heads  unfolding at the event -- would grab the most eyeballs, it wasnt quite the case. Instead, the labels that Trump wore (see pics on left) and the touristy rides she took to Golconda Fort and Falaknuma Palace drew more traction. And though the verdict on her specially-designed attires remained divided, the city certainly swooned over the advisor to the US President, when she dug into a plate of kebabs/biryani at table 101 or laid bare her admiration for the historic fort. There was Miss World Manushi Chhillar too who added the star quotient with her brief appearance, and the while looking her glamorous best. That she also spoke eloquently, was a bonus!The five-day World Telugu Conference (WTC) in December provided a sociocultural, literary, and political boost to the state government. While Telangana state succeeded in producing archaeological, historical and cultural evidences to prove that Telangana is the birth place of Telugu language, CM K Chandrasekhar Rao had emerged as the master linguist reciting with ease the most difficult of Telugu compositions. KCRs daughter and Nizamabad MP K Kavitha donned the role of an epigraphist with her well-researched presentation on the origin of Telugu alphabet and literature. IT minister KT Rama Rao, too, glittered during the Tollywood show attended by several top Telugu film personalities.WTC was a meticulously planned literary and cultural event that had brought to the fore several hitherto unknown facets of Telangana. Many departments worked over time gathering every bit of scientific evidence to prove the contention of the TRS government that the birth place of Telugu alphabet, prose and poetry was Telangana. Its long been contested that coastal Andhra is the birth place of proto-Telugu, the mother of modern Telugu language. Epigraphical, archaeological and historical data were produced at various sessions of the WTC in support of the evidence.About 10 years and over Rs 15,000 crore later, the Metro Rail finally chugged into Hyderabad late 2017, with Modiji on board its maiden run. Predictably, the Hyderabadi populace that had almost submitted to its fate of being a metro-less metropolis, thanks to a series of crises around finances, logistics, improbable deadlines and design of the rapid transit system, was only too excited to ultimately see their dream being realised. Result: within hours the footfall on these coaches touched one lakh! And as news about its swanky air-conditioned interiors and stylish technology-driven features spread, the 30-km ride from Nagole to Miyapur, became the new weekend outing for scores of families in town whose recreational options were limited to the movies and neighbourhood parks, up until then. But as weeks passed by, complains too started to surface  about the overly restricted speed (of 33 kmph), the cap on coaches (only three for now), the lack of enough toilets and severely scarce parking space.Though Hyderabadis are willing to dismiss all of it as mere teething problems, they are certainly hoping that the babus and netas finally wake up and take note of their minor miseries. They are also hoping that the Ameerpet-Hi Tec City stretch, which is expected to up and running by June 2018, is delivered on time without any further ado. Is someone listening?After a one-and-half year wait, fans finally got the know why Kattappa killed Baahubali! For the film fraternity, SS Rajamoulis mega offering was about being hit by a cinematic giant that was never heard, seen or even dared to have been made before. No surprises then that the moolah came gushing into the directors coffers soon after its April release (Rs 500 crore? Rs 1,500 crore? Your guess is as good as ours).The concept, cinematography, storyline, special effects and even performances were equally appreciated. The wait is now on to see what Rajamouli has up his sleeves next."
