With just two months to go for the season to be over, the monsoon seem to have lets them down.While there was a 40% deficit in rainfall during the first three months of the monsoon (October to December), the crisis deepened with a 98% deficit of rainfall in the winter period (January), according to the Meteorology Department. Farmers began sowing crops in the second week of October and the season will end in the beginning of March.Crop has been sown in 19.49 lakh hectares till date this season. While paddy is still in the transplantation stage, jowar, bajra and ragi crops are in the vegetative stage, maize crop is in the vegetative to tasseling stage. Red gram, green gram, black gram, horsegram, groundnut and sesamum crops are in the vegetative to flowering stage and Bengal gram crop is in the flowering to pod formation stage.Paddy has been already sown in 5,44,311 hectares. The area in which the other course grain crops have been sown are jowar 89,305 hectares, bajra 1,906 hectares, maize 1,75,678 hectares and ragi 6,493 hectares. Coarse grains have been sown in a total of 2,76,074 hectares. When it comes to the pulses, black gram has been sown in 3,84,481 hectares, green gram 87,031in hectares, Bengal gram in 5,02,660 hectares. Pulses have been sown in a total of 9,44,350 hectares. Statistically, only half the crop in the State has irrigation facility and the remaining half depends on groundwater and rain for moisture.Crisis situationAdditional water is required in the next week or fortnight to prevent withering of groundnut in Anantapur, Chittoor, Kadapa, Krishna, Kurnool, Prakasam and West Godavari districts, according to projections of the Andhra Pradesh Water Resources Information and Management Services. With a long wait till July-August for the South West monsoon, the water available in reservoirs also seems to be meagre. There is only 460.06 tmcft, that is 47.84%, in the Godavari, Krishna, Pennar and other river basins."

The International Trade Fair's display of a variety of millets at numerous stalls was impressive according to Hosangadi.The fair began on Friday at the Palace Grounds.While enquiring about a particular millet at a counter, he said,""This is huge. There are several things that I do not know about.""I have a 20-acre land which grows onion, chilli, groundnut and green gram, said Subash.He said that 60% of farmers from his village, Belavanaki, do not use fertilisers.""These farmers need to be educated that with the use of fertilisers, the yield is increased and the soil quality is sustained,"" he said. Hosangadi added that the international millet festival has presented new opportunities to farmers like him.The fair inaugurated by Chief Minister Siddaramaiah on Friday, witnessed over 300 stalls of millets, traditional grains and organics among others from Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Meghalaya, Uttarakhand, Haryana, and Chhattisgarh.A group of women farmers from four villages in Vikarabad, 70 km from Hyderabad exhibited a certain variety of millets. Among their other products, the safflower oil was a major source of attraction.""We have not seen anything like this before,"" said Shobha Rani, one of the women farmers.While speaking about the group of women, Anil Kumar, a member of a team which supports small communities like the women's said that it is always better to empower women through farming as the money goes directly to them.He added that if the money is with the men, they might spend it on drinking, while the women are far more responsible.The fair also witnessed international delegates and buyers from a range of countries including USA, Germany, Switzerland, UAE, South Korea, Uganda, China and Malaysia among others.""I think India needs to grow in the field of marketing. There needs to be a fair price so that the farmers benefit out of it,"" said, Zhou Zejiang, president, IFOAM, Organics International-Asia (Global organisation for organics).In his inaugural speech, the chief minister said: ""It is important for us to raise awareness and promote millets as they have a high nutritional value and easy to cultivate. We are a dry agriculture state and over the last 17 years only three years were drought free."""

Their members will arrive in Delhi to express their anguish under the current NDA rule.Budget no solaceHe said the Budget offered nothing for the farmers as there was no significant increase in the allocations.The much-waited 50% extra on minimum support price is yet to be implemented. The suggestions of the M.S. Swaminathan Committee have been ignored as they favour the farmers, he said. He said while Prime Minister Narender Modi promised to double the income of the farmers by 2022, his efforts were only helping the corporate sector and insurance companies.Many crops in the country such as green gram, black gram, bengal gram, and rice have witnessed a bumper yield, but the farmers are forced to sell them for 35% less as there is no market for the produce, he said."

Birendra Singh was accompanied by district agriculture officials and general manager of central warehouse corporation. They visited Bhograi, Jaleswar, Basta and Baliapal where they interacted with farmers associated with pulse cultivation and tried to ascertain the problems they faced.Singh wanted to know whether the farmers had the soil tested before plantation, the seed treatment process and use of fertilisers and pesticides, their weeding methods, yield per hectare and market.Although the farmers said they received help from the department and showed their soil test certificates, they complained about the distress sale of pulses. They alleged that they were forced to sell moong and Bengal gram at Rs 30 to Rs 35 a kg against the Centre's minimum support price (MSP) of Rs 55 a kg last year.They alleged that the lack of marketing facilities such as Markfed - co-operative marketing federations like those in Punjab and Andhra Pradesh - and the Nafed had enabled middlemen to exploit them. ""The farmers mainly raised the issue of distress sale because of the absence of marketing agencies and urged the team to address the issue. They complained that while they were forced to sell their produce for Rs 30-Rs 35 a kg against the central MSP of Rs 55 last year, the price in the open market was between Rs 60 and Rs 70 a kg,"" said assistant agriculture officer, Basta block, Sanjay Rout.""The farmers said that they had reduced the area of cultivation this year because of last year's distress sale,"" he said. According to department sources, pulses are grown on around 12,000-15,000 hectares in north Balasore with around 25,000 farmers involved. The yield per hectare is around 8 to 10 quintals, sources said.""Last year's yield was satisfactory, but we didn't find the market.

5b14cfcd9855b75db2e6f03f,Mango crop affected in Gujarat due to unfavourable weather: Parshottam Rupala,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/mango-crop-affected-in-gujarat-due-to-unfavourable-weather-parshottam-rupala-5165204/,2018-05-06,"Union Minister of State for Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, Parshottam Rupala Union Minister of State for Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, Parshottam RupalaExtreme weather conditions have halved the mango yield in its home districts of Junagadh and Gir-Somnath, according to findings of a survey by the Gujarat government. Union Minister of State for Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, Parshottam Rupala, while speaking at the Farm to Fashion: Indian textile global summit 2018 in Ahmedabad, said that the mango crop in the state had been affected severely by unfavourable weather conditions this season and that the government was assessing potential crop losses.Due to the extreme heat, mango trees have been damaged. There is a very big loss to the mango crop this year. We have got details from some of the farmers. We are doing a survey of it, Rupala said at the three-day event that began Friday in Ahmedabad. His comments have come around two weeks after a survey conducted by the Gujarat government concluded that mango orchards in Saurashtra were likely to produce only 40 to 45 per cent of fruits of the long-term average this year.Gujarat Agriculture Minister Ranchhod Faldu had visited Junagadh on April 5 and he instructed us to conduct a survey to assess the loss of crops, stating that farmers had made representations in this respect. With the help of scientists from Junagadh Agricultural University, we conducted sample survey in Junagadh and Gir Somnath districts. At the end of the survey, we concluded that the crop is 50 to 55 per cent less of the average in Junagadh district and 55 to 60 per cent less in Gir Somnath district, an officer of state horticulture department told The Indian Express on the condition of anonymity.The report was submitted to the state government last month and sources said it was being considered at higher level. Junagadh and Gir Somnath in Saurashtra region are known for the Kesar variety of mango. Farmers have grown mango orchards in more than 8,500 hectare in Junagadh and around 15,500 hectare in Gir Somnath. Overall, Gujarat is the fifth largest producer of mango in the country after Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Telangana. While farmers in Junagadh, Gir Somnath, Amreli, Bhavnagar and Kutch grow aromatic Kesar variety, their counterparts in Valsad, Navsari and Surat districts in south Gujarat mainly grow Alphonso variety. But this horticulture crop is highly weather-sensitive and sudden changes in weather affect the crop adversely.The news comes just a day after the Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) in Talala, one of the biggest wholesale markets of mango in the state, started auctioning the juicy fruit, marking the formal beginning of the mango season. The APMC, located in Gir Somnath district, recorded the arrival of 14,100 boxes, each containing 10 kg of mangoes, on the inaugural day on Thursday and the average price was around Rs 340 (for a 10-kg box) or around Rs1,700 per quintal. On Friday, the arrivals dropped to 8,350 boxes but the average price remained stable at around Rs 340. The highest price on Friday was Rs 650 and the lowest was Rs 210 for a 10-kg box, officers of the APMC said.Farmers say the crop is poor this year due to unfavourable weather. Skies remained overcast for three consecutive days in the first week of December under the influence of cyclone Ockhi. This affected the crop badly. In those days, mango trees in my orchards had started bearing fruits. But due to sudden change in the weather, the trees shed magdis (mango fruits of the size of green gram). Then again in January, the mercury soared unusually and led to khakhdis (immature mango fruits of the size of areca nut) falling down, Bharat Dobariya, a mango grower in Madhupur village in Talala taluka of Gir Somnath district, said. Dobariya has mango orchards in seven hectares out of his total land holding of nine hectares.Horticulture officers concur with the Dobariya. There was heavy rain in Talala and surrounding areas in October and therefore, flowering on mango trees started late. Then, due to cyclone Ockhi, flowering was affected. At the fruit-bearing stage in early January, there was huge variation in daytime temperature and night temperature. Consequently, trees shed immature fruits. Therefore, the overall production is likely to remain only around 45 per cent of the long-term average, said a horticulture officer in Junagadh.Dobariya said that he was expecting his mango production to remain around 300 quintals against 760 quintals last season. The government does not cover our horticulture crop under any crop insurance scheme. Nor does it declare Minimum Support Price for mangoes. So, we are completely at the mercy of market forces even in bad crop years, added the 36-year-old farmer.Incidentally, the state government had conducted a similar survey in Junagadh and Gir Somnath last year also after farmers complained of their trees bearing less number of fruit. The survey had concluded that the crop had seen an average of 25 to 30 per cent loss. But the mango growers had not received any compensation from the government.Farmers say good prices can salvage the season for them. I have started harvesting mangoes and a box of 10 kg is fetching around Rs 600 these days. This price is better as compared to corresponding period last season, added Dobariya.Junagadh and Gir Somnath together produce around 20 lakh quintals of mangoes every year. However, yields have remained stagnant at around 85 to 95 quintals per hectare. But prices have remained firm over the last few years as significant quantity of the total production is exported mainly to Europe and West Asia. The state had exported 5.32 lakh quintals of mangoes worth Rs 445 crore last year.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

(Source: PTI) AB De Villiers took a stunner to dismiss Alex Hales on Thursday. (Source: PTI)AB de Villiers lit up the Chinnaswamy Stadium with an absolutely stunning catch to get rid of Alex Hales in the eight over of Sunrisers Hyderabads innings against Royal Challengers Bangalore on Thursday. Chasing 219 in 20 overs, Hyderabads opening batsmen, Shikhar Dhawan and Alex Hales began their innings on a brisk note to keep the asking run rate in check. While Dhawan departed early, Hales kept the momentum going with a few lofty hits.However, playing one shot too many proved to be Hales undoing. With 60 runs in 7 overs, the Briton slogged one on the leg-side of the bowling off Moeen Ali, but De Villiers, who was fielding at deep mid-wicket, leaped on one leg and grabbed the ball with his right hand to complete a sensational catch. His effort also left skipper Virat Kohli in awe. Complementing ABD, Kohli said, That was Spiderman stuff. You dont do that as normal human beings. I thought it was going for a six but he pulled it off. He can do freakish things but I am used to it now. His fielding I am pretty used to now.Ab de Villiers is not human. I repeat he is not human. pic.twitter.com/hz39X9pJJK  Brandon Spence (@TheRealBSpence) 17 May 2018Earlier, SRH skipper Kane Williamson won the toss and asked RCB to bat first. Despite losing a couple of early wickets, RCB went on to score a humungous 218/6 in 20 overs. AB de Villiers (69) and Moeen Ali (65) put up a century stand to help the scoreboard surge past 200. Reflecting on his knock and the teams effort with the willow, Moeen Ali said, Definitely going to take that total and back ourselves to defend it. Do or die situation for us, so happy that everyone managed to get a few runs. The best way to play for our team is to play freely and not think too much about anything else. One of lifes great pleasures is to bat with AB, and it was amazing to share a partnership with him.For all the latest Sports News, download Indian Express App IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd"

(Express Photo by Gurmeet Singh/Representational Image) The scheme is an attempt to open another avenue for the farmer as well as firm up prices in open markets. (Express Photo by Gurmeet Singh/Representational Image)More than 2 lakh farmers in Maharashtra have been left in the lurch as the deadline for the procurement of tur  at the procurement centres run under the guidance of NAFED in the state  ended on May 15. This is the second time the state has failed to meet the deadline and procure 4.47 lakh tonnes (lt)  its target for procurement under the Price Support Scheme (PSS). The state government is hopeful that the Centre will give it another extension to tide over the crisis. But because of its failure to intervene successfully in the agricultural market, many farmers are now stuck with their produce.Whats the procurement scheme?Run by the Union Ministry of Food and Civil Supplies, PSS is a form of market intervention by the central government, to stabilise prices of commodities in wholesale markets. The scheme is activated when prices of agricultural produce such as tur, moong and chana fall below the government-declared Minimum Support Price (MSP).Under the scheme, the state governments, with the help of NAFED, set up procurement centres where farmers can sell their produce at MSP. The scheme is an attempt to open another avenue for the farmer as well as firm up prices in open markets. Usually, about 30 per cent of the produce is targeted for procurement. This season, the scheme was implemented in the state by the Maharashtra State Cooperative Marketing Federation and the Vidarbha Cooperative Marketing Federation via nearly 180 centres.What are the roadblocks in the process?As per the original schedule, the scheme was going to come to an end on April 18, but as the state faltered in the procurement process, the deadline was extended to May 15. Even with a revised deadline, the state could procure only 3.1 lt of the produce from 2 lakh farmers, leaving over 2 lakh more, who had registered for procurement, in the lurch. This year, state governments in Telangana, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh have also started tur procurement under PSS. While the process is underway in Gujarat, it has been completed in the rest of the states. Except Karnataka, most other states have managed to procure greater quantities of tur, reveals data from NAFED.Why does Maharashtra lag behind other states?Officials of both marketing federations and the Directorate of Marketing admit that the state had failed to meet its target due to lack of storage space. As per NAFED guidelines, the produce procured under the PSS programme can be stored only at the godowns of the Central Warehouse Corporation or State Warehouse Corporations. This year, most godowns are still stocked with the tur procured last season.Last year, Maharashtra had seen bumper production of tur, with prices crashing well below the MSP. To help out the farmers and preventing prices from falling further, the state government had purchased a record amount of over 7.7 lt of tur. Most of the procured tur has remained in the godowns as the process of disposal has been slow.It is estimated that while the Maharashtra State Cooperative Marketing Federation has disposed of some of the tur, about 2.1 lt procured last year remain in the godowns. As tur is a food grain, only godowns that are rain-proof, rodent-proof and have fumigation facilities can be used for storage. The marketing federations, therefore, have a lot of grain that is not being disposed of in time. With monsoons round the corner, authorities are worried about how to keep the stored tur fresh.Officials of NAFED said states that have a better network of godowns as well as better supply chain management for foodgrains perform better in terms of meeting their procurement targets. A similar fate seems to await the procurement process for chana, as the state has procured only 70,000 quintals of the 3 lt target given to it. With the deadline ending on May 29, chana growers might also find themselves in the lurch.How does it affect prices?Throughout the kharif season of 2017, the price of tur in the wholesale market had remained much below the MSP of Rs 5,400 per quintal. At Laturs wholesale market, the average trade price of the commodity was around Rs 4,200-4,500 per quintal, leading to an effective loss of over Rs 1,000 per quintal. It is estimated that the cumulative loss for farmers this season was over Rs 1,060 crore.Farmers are also apprehensive about the prices falling further as NAFED has pulled out of the market. It is estimated that around 3 lt of tur still remains with farmers, who now have to sell it at throwaway prices.Yogesh Thorat, managing director of the MahaFPC, a consortium of farmer producer companies (FPCs), said the state government needed to make alternative storage arrangements. We need to think out of the box and have farmgate level storage structures, which will help farmers dispose of their produce at will, he said.For all the latest Pune News, download Indian Express App"

All India Dal Mills Association has urged government to roll back the tax to promote regional dal mill sector.MP Dal Mill Association (Indore) president Suresh Agrawal said, We are losing business because dal processed in Gujarat, Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh and other states are much economical. They do not levy mandi tax on out station purchase of raw pulses.Agarwal said that dal mills have to pay Rs 11,000 as mandi tax on a truckload of 100 quintals pulses.Locally manufactured pulses are expensive by Rs 2 to Rs 3 per quintal in comparison to dal produced in other states.Dal mills of Indore bring chickpeas, green gram, black gram and red gram from neighbouring states such as Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, Rajasthan, Karnataka and Maharashtra. Dal processors said processed pulses from other states have captured the local market.Agrawal said, We have given a memorandum to chief minister to abolish the mandi tax on purchase of raw pulses from other states.According to MP Dal Mill Association, local dal mills have cut down production of processed pulses by about 50 per cent since the operative cost was huge as against the input.Dal mills purchase raw pulses from market and then process it into dal of various grades. After processing 60 per cent comes out as dal, while 25 per cent goes as cattle feed and the rest is wasted, experts said.There are 175 dal mills in Indore while the state is the leading producer of pulses in the country with a share of 35-40 per cent."

A majority of them live in unprotected areas to meet their food requirement.The incidence of blackbuck herds raiding standing groundnut, pigeon pea, green gram, maize and sorghum crops in the vegetative stage is on the rise. It is only be a matter of time before farmers resort to various methods of trapping and killing them, experts say. It is for hunting this animal that is listed in the First Schedule of the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972, that Hindi movie star Salman Khan was sentenced to five years rigorous imprisonment by the district court in Rajasthan.Professor Jayashankar Telangana State Agriculture University professor V. Vasudeva Rao said that more blackbucks were living outside protected areas because they were attracted to the wide variety of crops raised in the ayacut of many new lift irrigation schemes that have come up in the drought-prone districts of Rayalaseema.The blackbuck prefers open areas to closed forests.Prof. Vasudeva Rao did his Ph.D on the behaviour and other aspects of the blackbuck in two different habitats that is in arid areas of Prakasam district and on the banks of Godavari River, in 1999. He is currently head of the Department of Vertebrate Pest Management in the university.Status changed thriceThe International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List had changed the status of the blackbuck three times in the past three decades. From Vulnerable in 1994-96, the status of the antelope has been changed to Near Threatened (NT) (2003-08) and to Least Concerned (LC) after that till today.According to the IUCN, the population of the blackbuck increased from 22,000 in the 1970s to over 50,000 by 2000.Blackbuck was the heraldry symbol of seven princely states of India before Independence.It was the State animal of the undivided Andhra Pradesh. However after bifurcation, Telangana changed its State animal to spotted deer. After considerable deliberations, the new Andhra Pradesh decided to continue with the blackbuck as its State animal. It is the State animal of Haryana and Punjab also."

These are some of the individuals who may have been responsible for spreading fake rumours of child abduction that have killed over 30 people this year, an NDTV investigation has found.Spread over four states, our reporters relied on police records and local accounts to piece together a profile of the instigators of the messages that triggered a series of mob attacks across India.In at least three instances, in Maharashtra, Hyderabad and Jharkhand, the police have narrowed down on local media for manufacturing or amplifying dubious claims of child snatching.In Dhule, north Maharashtra, five people were killed by a violent mob on July 1. Amongst the reasons, the police claimed, was a video news report that went viral from a YouTube channel called MediaLive run by a local journalist called Rafeeq Sheikh.The report said that burqa-clad men were out on the prowl to abduct children from a local mosque, creating panic.Mr Sheikh claims the video was taken down within 10 minutes of it being put up. ""My adversaries downloaded the video and made it go viral after I took it down,"" he said.He told NDTV that he was only reporting an incident that occurred in his village. ""A lady in my village told me that she saw two men in a burqa trying to kidnap a girl, but failed when she spotted them from the kitchen and raised an alarm,"" he said.Police have denied any such incident.Curiously, police have not taken action against him, letting him off after questioning.Rafeeq Sheikh carried a report that burqa-clad men were out on the prowl to abduct children from a local mosque, creating panic.The role of the media has also surfaced in Telangana, where a transgender was beaten to death and two others badly injured in a mob attack on May 27 in Hyderabad.Police claim that among those who spread rumours of child abduction in the run-up to the attack are two local journalists, Subhan and Syed Saleem.Subhan allegedly shared a post of a video on his Facebook page called 'Reporter Subhan', claiming that child lifters were on the prowl in Mahbubnagar, nearly 100 kilometers from Hyderabad. The post blamed the police for rescuing the abductors. The video, in fact, was of the police rescuing a group of men who were wrongly targeted as child abductors.Among the 221 people who shared the post was Saleem, who allegedly has a track record of posting inflammatory messages on social media.Both were arrested on charges of abetment to murder. ""They heard rumours from other areas and spread it without understanding the consequences. The transgender was attacked because of them,"" said V.Satyanarayana, Deputy Commissioner of Police, South Zone, Hyderabad.Subhan, however, claims he did nothing wrong, and that the police have been unduly harsh.In Jharkhand, which witnessed the first instance of such mob attacks in May last year, the role of the media has been called into question.In Assam, however, police investigations have revealed how old-fashioned tools of communication, like phone calls and word of mouth have triggered a mob attack.For playing a role in spreading rumours that led to the murder of two men in June 8 in Assam's Karbi Anglong district, police have filed a case against a local man, Alfajos Timung.On the evening of June 8, the victims were finding their way to a waterfall when they encountered Timung.According to the police, Timung claimed the victims were child abductors, and got into an altercation with them. A crowd gathered and began to throw stones but the victims drove off.7 people were killed in Jharkhand in May 2017 over suspicion of being child-lifters.Timung then called ahead to a nearby village, and alerted them about the arrival of the two men, amplifying the story to allege that the car contained five child abductors, as well as abducted children. By the time the men reached the village, a crowd had gathered which beat them to death.""Not only did he give false information, but also propagated it and took part in the lynching,"" Dr GV Siva Prasad, Senior Superintendent of Police of Karbi Anglong district told NDTV.Timung was a school dropout but was an influential voice in the district as a member of the Karbi Student Union, say locals.His relatives claim that he was only trying to warn people against child abductors. ""Alfajoz has told us that he believed that they were really child lifters thus he alerted the villagers and the villagers had to check because these people exist,"" Timung's relative, Basanti Tehronpi, said. She said the area was rife with rumours about child abduction in the run up to the deadly event.Currently, Timung is in jail with his father and brother for instigating the crowd."

Zeenath, who whipped up this delicacy at The Hindu s Our State Our Taste cookery contest, organised in association with Andhra Pradesh Tourism at Mangalagiri on Saturday, perhaps has Dangeti Dharma Rao, the creator of this dish, to thank.I like trying new dishes and this particular dish, I saw it in the YouTube, she says, clueless about how Rao fiddled around with various ingredients to make this sinfully delicious halwa decades ago, the recipe of which was later disseminated and lapped up by people fond of wielding the ladle.I soaked the wheat and ground it to make wheat milk. I then boiled it along with jaggery syrup and ghee till the wheat milk turned into a halwa and garnished it with cashew and almonds, Ms. Zeenath shared the recipe even as people in the vicinity scooped out large portions from the bowl on the table before she knew it.Even after a century, the melt-in-the-mouth dish has not lost its original flavour that continues to tantalise the senses of people with sweet tooth.Nagalakshmi combined prawns with chintakaya (raw tamarind) to create a perfect taste liked instantly by the two-member jury. The chintakaya-royyalu curry was declared the second best and Sujitas kobbari palu annam (rice cooked with coconut milk) received the third prize.The penultimate episode of the preliminary round of the contest caravan that travelled across 11 mandals each in Krishna and Guntur districts saw 165 participants presenting diverse flavours at the Srimathi Nannapaneni Lakshmi Kalyana Mandapam in Mangalagiri.Authentic dishesIt was out-of-the-box recipe of Pravalika who made halwa with tegalu (tender palm shoots) and regipallu pachchadi (Indian plum chutney) that got her a consolation prize.Another consolation prize went to Vijayalakshmi for her dish patchi royyalu kura (prawn curry).The tilt of the judges, M. Damodar and K. Rajender Reddy, was clearly towards participants who kept their dishes simple. We are looking at traditional authentic dishes with high nutritional value, said Mr. Damodar.P. Mallikarjun Kumar, the lone male contestant, waited eagerly to explain the recipe of his dish coconut khova liberally sprinkled with cashew and badam.Pasta payasam, pesara pappu (green gram) gulab jamun, ragi puttu, kanda-bachchali attu, gummadi aviri pulusu, puchchakaya halwa and chilakada dumpa poornalu were some of the unique delicacies that vied for the top honours.The myriad flavours were generated in myriad ways. From the chopping to the plating of the food, the ingredients were grated, grilled, layered, levelled, melted or poured. Some involved scrambling, slicing, stirring, dipping and frying. But each dish was worth the effort that went into it.The show was powered by the Butterfly Group, in association with RKG Ghee and Oil and rice partner Fortune. The gifts were sponsored by the CMR group and Kanchi Kamakshi."
