But, the wild animals such as wild bears, boars, simians and peacocks are playing havoc with the lives of the farmers.Following the prevailing drought conditions, the wild animals have started intruding into human habitations in search of food and water. The food-starved wild animals entering into fields were destroying the ID crops such as maize, jowar, ground nut, green gram, Bengal gram and vegetables, etc.The farmers were taking all measures to protect the crops by tying sarees, plastic sheets, used water bottles etc to scare the wild animals and also sprinkling of pesticides around the fields, but in vain. Farmers have also erected manch and guarding their fields round-the-clock and making sounds by using drum and utensils to scare the wild animals.Anjanna from Manakondur mandal, who cultivated maize in two acres of land, said that the monkeys and wild bears were destroying his crop in spite of taking all preventive measure to scare the animals. Already, we are worried lot with non-availability of water and protection of the crops. The wild animal menace had become a nightmarish experience for us, he added.A farmer Venkat Reddy from Mujampalli village of Manakondur mandal literally wailed when asked about his groundnut crop.He had taken two acres of land on lease and cultivated groundnut. But, a horde of monkeys attacked his fields and destroyed the crop in search of food. We are informing the authorities to protect the crops from wild animals, but in vain, he complained.The man-animal conflict, which started with the advent of granite quarry operations, had aggravated during this drought conditions, said a forest range officer.We had constructed the percolation tanks and water storage points in the forests for the benefit of wild animals. But, there were no inflows due to drought and the forests have also withered forcing the animals to stray into human habitations in search of food and water, he stated.He said that they were planning to prepare an action plan to ensure that the water was made available to the wild animals in the jungles during the summer season."

The leguminous pulse crop has been successfully raised by Mahima, a group of 15 women, engaged in works under the Mahatma Gandhi Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme, in Ward 15 of Cheriyanad grama panchayat in Chengannur.On four centsThe group took 90 cents of land on lease for group farming and cultivated tapioca, elephant foot yam, colocasia, and green gram. The women took up black gram cultivation on a trial basis on four cents of land and found it successful. The harvest was made after one and half months of sowing. Encouraged by the short harvesting period and good returns, they have raised a second crop and are awaiting harvest.Black gram is generally cultivated in States such as Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh. The higher market value of the crop could be reason enough to expand the area under black gram cultivation, according to farm experts."
5904ea097be9e04154dfda83,"Farmer suicides is no fashion trend, Mr Gopal Shetty",http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/minorityview/farmer-suicides-is-no-fashion-trend-mr-gopal-shetty/,2016-02-18,"The BJP Member of Parliament from Maharashtra Gopal Shettys statement that it has become a fashion among farmers to commit suicide is ignoble. It not only points to an utter lack of sensitiveness to the plight of the farmers but also points to the ignorance of the difficult conditions in which farmers operate with hardly any infrastructure or help from the government. A cursory glance of the most recent report of the NSSO on Some Aspects of Farming in India brought out earlier this week will most certainly enlighten the honourable BJP MP in this regard.According to the report, which surveyed farmers for the two periods July to December 2012 and January to June 2013, the average cropped area of an Indian farmer was less than one hectare. While the average value of total crop production per agriculture household was Rs 40, 580 in the second part of the year which includes the khariff crop it was at a still lower Rs 36,696 in the first half of the year which included the rabi season. This is a far cry from the hefty payments doled out to the government employees by the various pay commissions and often for very unproductive work.The farmer has very little access to modern inputs and was heavily dependent on the local traders and their own farm for seeds and other farm inputs. Moreover what is worse is that the survey shows that the central and state governments have not been able to spread awareness of the various government programs to help farmers including the widely used minimum support prices which is to protect the farmers from any distress sales during periods of good harvests. And even the minor segment which is aware of the minimum support prices sold their produce to procurement agencies and benefited from the program.But it is not the governments ability to inform the farmers about minimum support prices which galls the experts. More important is the government inability to provide any kind of insurance to cover for the risks the farmers take through large investments in each cropping season. While the share of agriculture households insured was in low double digits in crops like moong, groundnut, soya bean and cotton it was less than 5% in important cereals like paddy and wheat. Numbers on most major crops show that less than half the farmers were aware of crop insurance schemes and even among those aware of such schemes very few had any idea of the facilities it provided.However, the biggest default on the farm front is the governments apparent inability to provide extension service for the farmers. Less than 3% of the agriculture households who were keen on updating technologies have access to the support of krishivigyan kendras, agriculture universities or NGOs. Hardly 6% had access to services of extension agents. Similarly 7-8% of the agriculture households can avail of services of private commercial agents or veterinary departments. The largest source of agriculture households access to technical advice was progressive farmers and media like radio, television, newspaper and internet which accounted for almost a 20% share each.There is also substantial disparities in the access to technical advice for agriculture household across states. Among major states almost two third of the farmer households has access to technical advice during the khariff crop in the states of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Kerala. In contrast the access to technical advice to farmer household was the least in Jharkhand, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh where it was just around a quarter.These numbers give an idea of the innumerable hurdles that Indian farmers have to face to eke out a marginal existence on the fringes of the economy. The government inability to provide even basic facilities like extension or insurance facilities either directly or through private agencies point to bankrupt polices which has forced many a farmer to take their own life especially when input costs and cost of farming practices have soared up in recent years. Gopal Shetty, the BJP Member of Parliament from Maharashtra should try to educate himself about the sad plight of the farmers before he makes such ignoble statements about them."

It used to be far more vibrant in the past. We used to have a large tub of coloured water, where men and women splashed colours at each other, recalls Mr. Jain.In Ongole, the young and the old celebrated the festival with great enthusiasm.Revellers, particularly the youth, went around town on motorcycles and exchanged wishes. Businessmen from Rajasthan, who have made Ongole their second home, indulged in merry-making on the busy Gandhi Road and Trunk Road.In Chittoor, residents along Neeva River performed special pujas at the Hanuman temple and sprinkled colours of revelry.Several families from the Rajput and Jain community celebrated the occasion with gusto.

58f4c07460de4776e369496f,Costly pulses hit domestic budget,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160419/jsp/odisha/story_80836.jsp,2016-04-19,"POCKET PINCH Cuttack, April 18: Dal is missing from the menu of several households as the prices of pulses have gone up in the past week across the state. Primarily, the high cost of pulses in Maharastra, Chhattisgarh, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka - from where the state procures dal - is responsible for the price hike. Besides, the state government's norms - fixing the limit of stocking pulse - have also added to the consumers' woes. The retail prices of pulses have registered a hike varying from Rs 5 to Rs 15 per kilogram. At present, arhar dal is being sold at Rs 148 to Rs 150 per kg at the retail markets. The rate of chana dal has also gone up to Rs 80 to Rs 82 per kg against the retail price of Rs 73 to Rs 78 last week. There has been no change in the retail price of moong dal, which is being sold at Rs 85 to Rs 90 per kg. But, the prices of biri dal have gone to Rs 145 per kg from Rs 120 and the rate of masoor dal stands at Rs 85 per kg while it was being sold at Rs 75 at the retail markets last week. Harapriya Samal, a working woman from Jhanjirmangala, said: ""Rice is our staple diet, and our meal is incomplete without dal. So, we are now forced to buy dal at such high rates,"" said Samal. Malgodown traders, however, put the blame on bulk procurement by several multi-national companies, who are now procuring pulses from the farmers. The state requires seven lakh metric tonnes of pulses per annum, while only 80,000 tonnes to one lakh metric tonnes are produced here. A Cuttack Chamber of Commerce official said the pulses' prices were expected to rise due to the existing curb on stocking pulses. At present, a trader is only allowed to stock 750 quintals of pulses according to the government norms. ""If the stock limit is raised, then only the prices of pulses can be kept under control at least for a month despite the high procurement rate as there will be adequate stock to meet the requirement,"" said the official. ""Various big companies are now directly procuring essential commodities from farmers, and as the prices of pulses are high at the point of purchase, there has been a gap in the supply which has pushed the prices,"" said Cuttack Chamber of Commerce joint secretary Prafula Chatoi, who said they had submitted a memorandum to the district administration demanding an increase in the stock limit for traders to 5,000 quintals. On the other hand, Cuttack collector Nirmal Chandra Mishra convened an emergency meeting to review the situation here today, and the Malgodown traders were asked to report the wholesale and retail prices on a daily basis. ""There is an adequate stock at Malgodown. We also urge the consumers not to resort to panic buying as the wholesale prices at Malgodown have been stable for the past two to three days,"" said the collector."

Soyabean in Adilabad, rice in Khammam, Karimnagar, Nalgonda, Warangal and Nizamabad and maize in Medak, Mahbubnagar and Ranga Reddy will be the predominant crops to be covered with villages as units of insurance.Other crops like jowar, red gram, green gram, black gram, chillies, turmeric and groundnut will be covered with mandal as unit.However, soyabean, rice and maize will also be covered in mandal as unit where they are not listed as predominant crops. For instance, rice is not a predominant crop in Adilabad, Medak, Mahbubnagar and Ranga Reddy. Similarly, soyabean is not a predominant crop in all districts except Adilabad and maize not in districts other than Medak, Mahbubnagar and Ranga Reddy.Besides, the government notified cotton, red chillies, oil palm and sweet lime in various districts for weather based crop insurance scheme (WBCIS) as part of PMFBY. The PMFBY aimed to support sustainable production in agriculture with financial assistance, stabilising income of farmers, encouraging them to adopt innovative and modern agricultural practices and ensuring credit flow. The WBCIS was meant to address the financial loss suffered by farmers on account of adverse weather conditions."

Photo: By arrangementCutting across party lines, all Zilla Parishad Territorial Constituency (ZPTC) members and Mandal Parishad presidents (MPP) have alleged large-scale irregularities in the distribution of tractors on subsidy to the farmers by the Agriculture Department, and demanded a thorough inquiry to punish the guilty officials.Raising the issue during the Zilla Parishad general body meeting in Karimnagar town on Wednesday, Mallial ZPTC member Shoba Rani alleged that officials sanctioned the government subsidised tractors to rich and influential farmers, denying the benefits to small and marginal farmers who own land in the range of 2.5 to five acres, by all violating norms.She charged that the eligible Scheduled Caste beneficiaries were also denied the subsidised tractors.Similar views were also expressed by the Kodimial and Medipalli MPPs, who demanded a thorough inquiry to punish the guilty officials.They also sought mandal-wise details of tractors sanctioned to the beneficiaries. At this juncture, Zilla Parishad chairperson Tula Uma intervened and stated that she received complaints about the irregularities in the same from various parts of the district.Stating that authorities have diluted the cause of providing government benefits to real beneficiaries, the ZP chairperson informed Joint Director (Agriculture) Sucharita to order for an inquiry and ensure that the tractors are provided to genuine beneficiaries.Earlier, the ZPTC members complained that the Agricultural Department officials failed to provide adequate seeds of various ID (irrigated dry) crops such as redgram, green gram, maize, etc. in the district.Boinpally ZPTC member K. Latchi Reddy said that the while the government is asking people not to take up cotton cultivation during this kharif season, it has failed to provide adequate quantity of ID crop seeds .The ZP general body meeting also discussed about the need to strengthen government schools by increasing the enrolment of students.The ZPTC members lodged several complaints against the teachers for dereliction of duties and involving in other business activities, neglecting their prime duty of teaching in the schools.Legislators T.

58f23cd5a3d24b68099ab6f7,Farming operations begin,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/Farming-operations-begin/article14415965.ece,2016-06-11,"With the onset of monsoon and early rainfall in various parts of Karimnagar district in the first week of this month, farmers have launched agricultural activities. The farmers of the district, who faced several hardships due to drought for two consecutive years, are expecting a good rainfall and have intensified their farm activities. Besides, the desiltation of the minor irrigation tanks under the Mission Kakatiya programme and taking up of other rain harvesting structures had also boosted the morale of farmers and are expecting a complete recharge of ground water table. During the last kharif season, farmers cultivated crops in only 3.43 lakh hectares against the normal area of cultivation on 5.2 lakh hectares. This year, the Agricultural Department is expecting cultivation on 5.15 lakh hectares. The authorities are also encouraging farmers to go in for ID (irrigation dry) crops instead of cotton crop. Against the normal area of cultivation of cotton in 2.26 lakh hectares during the kharif season, the authorities expect cotton to be cultivated only on 1.62 lakh hectares due to their awareness programmes. Maize cultivation would be increased from the normal area of 53,799 hectares to 83,669 hectares, soya cultivation would be increased to 31,761 hectares from the normal area of 9,744 hectares. Similarly, the green gram cultivation would be increased from 4,579 hectares to 10,742 hectares. The red gram cultivation would also increase from 5,422 hectares to 13,241 hectares. Even as the government has been educating farmers to go in for ID crops such as maize, pulses etc, the authorities have failed to provide adequate quantity of seed to farmers."

Sowing of most of the crops require good soil moisture for germination and the required dampness in the upper layers of soil comes only with the help of at least 70 mm rainfall, officials of Agriculture Department said adding that many mandals have not recorded that amount of rain so far.Sowing of seed of crops such as maize, cotton, red gram, jowar and others, besides paddy, could be done till the third week of July, the officials said. Cultivation of cotton is likely to remain high in such circumstances, in spite of the government efforts to bring it down to 10.64 lakh hectares this year against last years 17 lakh hectares.The crop has already been cultivated in nearly half of the total extent covered in kharif season as the plans to encourage soybean and maize in place of cotton have fallen flat due to delayed rains and institutional credit.The State Government has prepared orders to release Rs. 2,019 crore out of Rs.4,040 crore required for writing off the third quarter of the crop loan waiver.Official sources said that renewal of crop loan accounts linked to the waiver scheme is likely to be delayed for over a week due to the time consumed in percolation of the information along with necessary orders by the controlling officers of banks till the branch level.The actual rainfall in 125 out of 443 mandals where crops are cultivated is either deficit or scanty till date, although it is normal or excess in the remaining mandals. Technically, the average rainfall across the State till June 27 is 17 per cent above normal with deficit of only 15 per cent, 13 per cent, respectively, in Adilabad and Karimnagar districts."
58fed95a7be9e0420db28460, still dear after VAT cut,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160719/jsp/odisha/story_97423.jsp,2016-07-19,"Bhubaneswar, July 18: The price of various varieties of dal have not decreased as expected despite the state government reducing the value-added tax (VAT) on pulses from five to one per cent from July 1. Gram dal has instead become costlier. The price of arhar dal fallen but that of other pulses has not reduced as expected. Arhar dal is now sold in the retail market at Rs 140 a kg, moong dal at Rs 120 a kg and gram dal at Rs 110 a kg. On June 28, when the cabinet had decided to revise VAT on dal, chief secretary Aditya Prasad Padhi said: ""The traders had promised that if the VAT was revised, it would not affect revenue collection and would have a positive impact on the prices that would be passed on to the consumers. We will observe during the next three months the impact of VAT revision on revenue collection and price revision. We will then take the final call."" Federation of All-Odisha Traders' Association general secretary Sudhakar Panda had said that the VAT revision would definitely bring the prices down. However, observing the situation, food supplies secretary P.K. Mohapatra had shot off a letter to all district collectors asking them to conduct market studies on the wholesale and retail prices of dal. ""We are keeping a close watch on the market situation and will recommend action against unscrupulous traders,"" said deputy director, market intelligence, Pravakar Rout. Panda said VAT had been reduced by four per cent and it has had its impact on the dal prices. ""The arhar dal price has fallen from Rs 140 to Rs 130 a kg. The price of moong has also fallen correspondingly."" He, however, conceded that the gram dal price had climbed by Rs 30 a kg. ""We have no control over the price of gram dal because it has been listed under the National Commodity Exchange. The price fluctuates based on speculation,"" he said, adding that they had urged the Centre to de-list gram dal from the National Commodity Exchange. ""But the Centre has not accepted our demand."" Panda, however, hoped that the prices would fall in the coming days, as dal cultivation in Maharashtra, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh had been higher this year because of favourable weather conditions."

Most may have just heard this but Dr Ravindra Kolhe can vouch for it. Born in the temple town of Shegaon, he listened to sermons of saints who visited the place. ""They had a deep impact on my heart and mind,"" says the doctor who had his early education at a local school in Marathi medium.Suffering with a congenital heart ailment termed as primary pulmonary hypertension, Kolhe says frequent hospitalization and frail health made him a voracious reader. ""I got very good marks in Std X and wanted to become an engineer. But my teachers said I should go for medicine.""Kolhe moved to Wardha and enrolled at JB Science College. ""It was here that I came under the influence of Gandhi and Vinobha Bhave. Their ideologies had a deep impact on my mind.""Good marks in Std XII ensured a seat in Government Medical College, Nagpur. ""Here, too, I looked around for a library and found one at Ramkrishna Mission,"" he says. By this time Kolhe had realized that he had to work in rural area. ""I read John Ruskin's book 'Unto This Last' and was impressed by it. I was also in the company of seers at the Ramkrishna Math and would discuss the purpose of life with them.""By the time he was in the final year, he had formed a group called Sangharsh with his batch mates and they worked in the Babulkheda slum behind the medical college. ""It was at this time that I read the book 'Where There is No Doctor' written by a Spanish revolutionary. The book cover had an image of four persons carrying a patient on a stretcher and there was a milestone on which it was written -- hospital 30 miles. That image remained imprinted in my mind and when I passed out I decided to hunt for a village from where a hospital was 30km away,"" says the doctor.Though he wanted to rush to rural areas, ""my seniors advised me that I should first learn to do deliveries single-handedly, diagnose pneumonia with stethoscope and should be able to treat diarrhoea"", he says. Two house jobs in Mumbai equipped him with these skills.""My professors Dr Dinoo Dalal and Dr Minoo Advani took me through an intensive course in mother and child care,"" he says. On October 30, 1984, when Dr. Kolhe was just 23 years old, he went searching for the ideal village and travelled through Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Maharashtra.""I finally identified Bairagad in Amravati district on Feb 9, 1985. My batchmate and I began working from a veranda of a house,"" he says. But realization that they can't handle surgical emergencies made them decide that they should complete post-graduation too.Kolhe enrolled in GMC for MD in preventive and social medicine in 1986. ""My professor Dr Motghare said that I should look for some more sustainable solutions and asked me to prepare a paper on tribal health. The data that I collected about the mother and child health of tribals at Dharni was dismal.""What he discovered during this compilation was malnutrition of children in Melghat. These findings reached out to the world as he was interviewed by BBC radio. ""Suddenly this issue of child mortality and malnutrition in Melghat got political attention as I identified 200 reasons for it.""But after completing his MD, Dr Kolhe's partner refused to return to the village. ""This made it imperative that I get married as alone I could not serve the community."" But the conditions that he laid out for his would-be wife were tough. ""I wanted to marry a woman who would run the house in 400 per month, walk up to 40km, would agree for a registered marriage and be prepared to beg for others.""Ironically, the woman he married was a far cry. ""I was running a homeopathy clinic and earning lots of money. I was fashion conscious and would travel across the city just to match my footwear with a sari,"" says Dr Smita, who was also an ABVP worker and a school mate of Nitin Gadkari. ""But these four conditions were acceptable to me as I would always think what is it in life that I want beyond what I have,"" she says.In 1988, she left behind her penchant for good clothes and a good life and moved with her husband to Bairagad. ""It was a trial marriage and would continue till she kept to these four conditions,"" says Kolhe.In the village, the couple got a new mud house built by the villagers. ""Drawing water from the well, getting the mud, cow dung and hay mixture right for the walls, cooking on firewood were things that I had never done in life,"" recalls Smita.Wearing a sari costing 10 purchased from ration shops, she began enjoying the scenic beauty of Melghat and got involved in the life of the villagers. ""I loved the beauty of the place and the simplicity of the tribals,"" she says.The couple has two sons and both studied at the local school. ""The elder one Rohit is an agriculturist and the younger, Ram is studying at the medical college in Akola. The elder one's wife is a farmer's daughter. She took time to adjust with our lifestyle but is now comfortable with it,"" Smita says and adds that luckily the sons agreed to follow their parent's lifestyle.Going beyond community service through medicine, the couple have also focused their attention to making the village economically strong. ""We took help of agriculture universities and began sowing potatoes, soya bean, cotton, sugar cane, jute, water melon, turmeric and summer moong. Amravati is known as the suicide district but there are no such events in Melghat,"" says the proud couple.""Child mortality came down to 40 per 1000 when we began working it was 200, mortality of preschool children is 100, previously it was 400. We have been able to make an operation theatre with the help of private aid and now there are 70 doctors in the region,"" said Kolhe.The couple also organizes a camp 'Tarunai' for youth which is about social orientation and community living.

Pinning hopes on a similar windfall, onion growers increased cultivation. Maharashtra also recorded a good yield. The influx impacted prices and good quality onion is being purchased for Rs 900 a quintal while average quality is priced at Rs 300 a quintal, APMC Secretary H C Gajendra said.More than 70 loads of onion from Ramadurg, Bagalkot, Badami, Basavana Bagewadi, Lingsugur and other areas had arrived at the APMC yard on Saturday.We used to sell onion to other states earlier. This season, onion has been grown in large quantities in Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and Bihar as well. Due to low demand, price has dipped, said APMC trader Suresh Habib.Rudragouda Ninganagouda, a farmer from Katakol village in Ramadurg taluk, lamented that the current prices of onion were so low that it would be better to bury the crop in the fields instead of harvesting it. The government should help farmers by announcing minimum support price and by procuring onion directly from farmers, he said.Green gramThe price of green gram has also fallen, and it is being purchased for Rs 3,000 to Rs 5,000 a quintal. Compared to last year, green gram price had come down by Rs 3,000 to Rs 4,000 a quintal, trader Shivanna Adargunchi observed."

But with the successful launch of UMP, their role is increasingly getting eliminated as farmers get a far better price in the market,'' said Manoj Rajan, managing director and CEO, Rashtriya e-Market Services, the brain behind the venture.The UMP success can be gauged from the fact that wholesale dealers from Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Kerala, Haryana, West Bengal and Delhi have taken the unified trader licence to participate in Karnataka's online markets.

Next year, 52 more markets will start transactions on UMP.Rajan said the new system has contributed to a significant rise in prices of copra, groundnut, tur, turmeric, Bengal gram, arecanut, dry chilli and green gram. For instance, the average price of copra increased from Rs 5,000-5500 a quintal in 2013 to Rs 10-000-14,000 a quintal in 2016, thanks to UMP.Farmer leader Mallesh added that the online system has created quality and price awareness among farmers but the biggest challenge for the government is to rope in more farmers into the systemRajan said around 18 lakh farmers have registered till date. The government launched a drive to bring in more farmers under the system in 11,000 villages across the state.Besides, he said, they have commenced assaying services in 10 markets to cover a minimum 15% of arrivals in the market. ""We have taken an ambitious programme of installing automated cleaning and grading machinery in APMC markets where the farmer's produce will be cleaned and packed before sale. The project will take off in 65 markets next year,'' he added.National NetworkRashtriya e-Market Services (ReMS), a joint venture of the state and NCDEX Spot Exchange was envisaged as a pan-Karnataka electronic trading portal which seeks to network the existing Agricultural Produce Market Committees (APMCs) and other market yards to create a unified national market for agricultural commodities. Karnataka's UMP promises more options for sale. For the local trader in the mandi (market), it also offers the opportunity to access a larger market for secondary trading. The gradual integration of all major mandis in the states will ensure common procedures for issue of licences, levy of fee and movement of produce. Over 5-6 years, the government expects significant benefits for farmers with integration of national markets.Driving the projectManoj Rajan, a 2008 IFS officer, was the brain behind the UMP which was launched in 2014. As managing director and CEO of ReMS, he decluttered the agriculture market riddled with middlemen and unfair trade practices. Manoj, who is from Kolar, used technology to provide a barrier-free agricultural market system. Rajan currently holds three important positions in the government since he has earned a reputation for innovation. Rajan, a graduate of Mysore University, also had a stint as a chief electoral officer and managing director of the Karnataka State Beverages Corporation.Showing the wayKarnataka's Unified Market Platform has now become a pan-India inititiative and model for several other states. The model was first showcased at the National Conference on Sustainable Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi at Gangtok in January 2016. He was quite impressed with it and did not hesitate to borrow the model from a Congress state. Andhra Pradesh has integrated seven markets on the lines of UMP. The state bagged the Quality Council of India's DL Shah Award-Platinum at the 11th National Quality Conclave 2016 in New Delhi recently.How UMP helps* Farmers have greater bargaining power compared to traders* Farmers are more aware of crop quality specifications* Greater transparency at every stage of transaction within a mandi* Electronic trading system allows buyers to bid in real time even if they're not physically present* E-auctioning system enabled sellers to participate, irrespective of proximity to mandi* APMC revenues increased due to online transactions* Transparency in registration process reduced evasion of market fee* Tender results announced daily at 1pm so farmers do not face uncertainty'Good delivery mechanism'Online trading can surely revolutionize agriculture marketing system provided it has a good delivery mechanism. It seems true in the case of Karnataka's Unified Marketing Platform.-- Narendar Pani | professor, school of social science, National Institute of Advanced Studies, Bengaluru"

She helps run a self-help group of 18 women in this village in Sangareddy district, which borders Karnataka and is 168 km from Hyderabad.The village is readying up for rabi sowing. Many of the villagers are Dalit tenant farmers. Chandramma and her husband decided to cultivate sugarcane this year. Already late to sow, they needed an urgent need to borrow Rs 30,000 from the nearest Andhra Pradesh Grameen Vikas Bank, 25 km away in Narayankhed, a town with just one other bank, SBI.That was when demonetisation struck. There are only three buses to Narayankhed; some days none. And then the bank, which had never said no to Chandramma in the past, refused to lend to her this time. So she turned to a money lender, borrowing at a monthly interest rate of 3 per cent or 36 per cent annually .As Chandramma speaks, two men join her side and she stops talking. Gunendar Rao and T Nandu Singh are both money lenders and do not seem pleased that Chandramma is talking to the press. Everything is fine here, one of them says. People are just a bit inconvenienced here. The banks will sort things out.Gunendar Rao decides to justify himself. I dont charge too much, just 3 per cent, which amounts to Rs 900 a month for Rs 30,000. Im trying to help these farmers because the banks arent giving them any money.Nandu picks up the theme, Now the banks dont have money to give, so they come to us. We dont have any problem accepting their Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes.There are whispers that the moneylenders take a cut of Rs 100 from each demonetised note.Kharamungi is separated from the Karnataka border by the Manjira river. Villagers can choose to cross the river and travel to Bidar, a distance of 15 km, or travel 40 km by public transport to the nearest agricultural market in Bidar. It is easier to get demonetised notes exchanged there than go to the Narayankhed banks. Narayankhed is the connecting point for 43 villages in Manoor mandal, serving over 50,000. Last Thursday, there were long queues snaking out of the towns two banks. The only ATM was closed in the morning and had a long queue in the evening.Pushpa Thakur has money due fromthe local dairy | SATHYA KEERTHIBack in Kharamungi, Pushpa Thakur and her husband dont own the home they inhabit with their son. In 2015, they borrowed Rs 40,000 from a money lender to farm a land they leased. The banks did not give them credit as they dont own the land. But the Manjira flooded that year, resulting in crop losses for most farmers in this village including Pushpa Thakur and her family. Pushpa switched to selling cows milk to Vijaya Diary to get by. But the dairy company has not made any payments for October and November. Everytime we ask them, they say next week. Now they say they dont have money, says Pushpa. She is afraid she will default on her payments to the moneylender.Demonetisation was sprung upon Kharamungi at a time when rabi crop sowing season was due. Now with banks and microfinance companies not lending to farmers owing to the currency shortage, farmers are left with no option but to approach the local moneylenders."
