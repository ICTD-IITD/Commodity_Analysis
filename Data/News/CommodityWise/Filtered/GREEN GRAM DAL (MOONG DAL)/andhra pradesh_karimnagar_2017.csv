The trend that started after Onam is expected to continue until March if not for any unexpected natural event.Of the 23 items under the tubers and vegetables category in the ESD list, 17 have lower prices than previous January with some like carrot and tomato showing over 40 per cent dip. Exceptions are elephant foot yam, tapioca, colocasia, cucumber, banana and plantain which recorded 4-56 per cent hike in prices.While the milk price is stable, a dozen white leghorn eggs now cost Rs 1.40 less. V P Jayakumar, a vegetable trader in Chalai market and a former office-bearer of the Kerala Vyapari Vyavasayi Ekopana Samithi, said now there was a surplus supply of vegetables from Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka, unlike previous years.Prices are down after Onam and the situation is likely to continue until March, he said.Cereal is one category that survived the downfall trend and firmed up. Except Chamba rice, all other rice varieties showed an upward trend, 7-18 per cent growth from previous January. Sugar too recorded a 23 per cent growth. According to Satheesh R N, Supplycos marketing manager, the new governments decision to sell 13 commodities at the same rate during its tenure has helped control the prices of major cereals and pulses.The 1,400-odd outlets of Supplyco help our consumerist state to control food prices. Commodities other than the 13 classified items are sold at prices 40-50 per cent less than the market rate. FMCGs are sold at 2-30 per cent discount, he added."

Rich aroma of Aresalu is wafting into the streets. Bylanes are reverberating with the singing of Haridasus and kites of various desgins are soaring high in the sky.The enitre State is ready for the celebration of rich Telugu culture and traditions. It is Sankranti.Why it is celebrated?Makar Sankranti has a uniqueness to itself. Unlike other Hindu festivals which follow the lunar calendar, Makar Sankranti is probably among the very few festivals that is observed as per the solar calendar.This makes it the only festival to fall on a fixed date every year - January 14.The mode of celebrations has an agararian overtone and in Andhra Pradesh, being a major agrarian economy, it is arguably called the mother of all festivals. The harvest festival is celebrated for four days in Andhra Pradesh.Women playing kolatam during Sankranti celebrationsat A Convention Centre in Vijayawada on Friday | ExpressDay 1 - BhogiThe festival starts with the Bhogi, a day preceding Sankranti. People shed old and derelict things and welcome the new symbolising transformation.Before the day break, bonfires (Bhogi Mantalu) are lighted with logs of wood, other solid fuels and wooden furniture that are no longer in use.It stands for realisation, transformation and purification of the self by a change for the better.Day-2 Makar SankrantiOn Makar Sankranti, the second day of the festival, people wear new clothes, offer prayers to God, and make offerings of traditional food to ancestors who have died. Beautiful and ornate drawings and patterns are drawn on the ground with chalk or flour (Rangoli or Muggulu) in front of houses and these drawings are decorated with flowers, colours and small, hand-pressed piles of cow dung, called Gobbemmalu.Day-3 KanumaOn the third day, Kanuma is celebrated. Kanuma is very dear to the farmer community as it is the day on which they showcase their gratitude to cattle which are the symbolic indication of prosperity.The animals are given a bath and adorned with ornaments. Girls feed animals, birds and fish as a symbol of sharing.To ensure the happy gathering of the family members, any travel on this day is considered inappropriate.Day-4 MukkanumaThe fourth day is called Mukkanuma which is popular among the non-vegetarians. On this day, farmers offer prayers to the natural elements like soil, rain and fire for blessing them with good harvest. People in Coastal Andhra do not eat any meat (or fish) during the first three days of the festival and do so only on the day of Mukkanuma and the day following Mukkanuma call for celebrations with union of families, friends, relatives followed by fun activities, which include cockfights, bullock race and kite flying.The young damsels come together and put forward cute little dolls coupled with other things and narrate a scenario. Although this tradition of Bommala Koluvu is slowly fading, people of all ages love to see the display as friends and relatives are invited to have a look. In the olden days, local handicrafts like Kondapalli and Etikoppaka toys and dolls were showcased but now collection of handicrafts across the country are being displayed.HaridasusDressed in an attire unique to the art form, with an Akshaya Patra on the head, a Tambura, and Chidatalu, the Haridasu is the one who ushers in the festive spirit associated with Sankranti. Haridasu goes from house to house and ask for bhiksha. Haridasu says Krishnarpanam when he receives offerings from people.Lip-smacking delicaciesFor this festival, most of the families prepare Chakinalu, Nuvvula Appalu, Gare Appalu, Madugulu (Jantikalu), Bellam Appalu, Kudumulu, Ariselu and Dappalam (a dish made with pumpkin and other vegetables) to make an offering to God. The sweet delicacies include a sweet porridge like dish known as Chakkara Pongal which is made with rice, jaggery and mung lentils, flavoured with cardamoms and dry fruits. Symbolic of joy and festivity, Poornam Boorelu is the most popular sweet prepared in the homes of Andhrites.CockfightsCockfight is a tradition that has been followed by the people. It is a bloodsport between two roosters held in a ring called cockpit. It is the favourite sport of people living in the coastal region of Andhra Pradesh.The fights are organised in sprawling fields with thousands watching. Three or four inch blades are attached to the cocks legs. Knockout fights to the death are widely practiced in the State.Different celebrations of Sankranti across IndiaIndia is known for Unity in Diversity and at the same time India is known as the Land of Festivals.

5923bd157be9e01fcef058dc,Artisans need govt help to survive,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/591985/artisans-need-govt-help-survive.html,2017-01-17,"Artisans need govt help to surviveSudhansu R Das, Jan 18, 2017 23:31 ISTThe state govt should provide raw material to artisans, who have no direct access to buyers and exporters.For centuries Indians knew how to prepare utility and decorative items from material available in nature. The Rigveda literature gives description of different kinds of patras (containers) and household items. Later, the artisans with their skill and imagination added high value to those items which constituted one of the major items of Indias export.Economic historian Angus Maddison in his book The World Economy  A millennial perspective noted that from first century AD to 15th century AD, India was the worlds largest economy with 32.9% share of worlds GDP. The East India Company used to buy Indian goods worth five lakh pounds every year before 1757 AD for export.It is not only the art objects the Indians knew, the technique of building climate friendly houses and knew organic farming techniques. In fact, Indian economy was an extension of eco-system which can be rewoven to generate employment and foreign currency.The brassware industry of Moradabad has an estimated annual turnover of Rs 8,000 crore out of which Rs 6,000 crore come from export. Indian gold sector employ 2.5 million artisans to export gold ornaments worth $20 billion per annum.The wooden toy makers of Nirmal in Adilabad district of Telangana add high value to idols of gods and goddesses, large sized horses, elephants, eagle and figures from the Indian mythologies. Only about 50 artisans survive to work for one handicraft production centre of the state government. Their income hardly exceeds Rs 300 per day after nine hours of hard labour.The artisans do not have direct access to buyers and exporters. Here the state government should provide raw material-poniki wood, transparent marketing facility and social security to the artisans. In 1960s, every house in Salem had a loom. Today, hardly 100 handloom weavers struggle to keep the tradition alive.The handloom tradition has declined due to poor cooperative leadership, corruption and mismanagement. The weavers were forced to pay commission at the time of buying yarns, receiving order and while receiving payment which is delayed for more than one year. The majority of the buyers cannot distinguish a pure Salem silk from a mill-made one. Salem may miss all its genuine handloom weavers in the next five years.Similarly, the Paithani silk saree weavers of Aurangabad are left with little enthusiasm. Some 10 to 20 senior weavers in the city work for traders on daily wage basis. Genuine Kashmiri carpet is losing to mill made carpets which are sold in the name of Kashmiri carpets. Here, the state government should create awareness among buyers about the genuine Kashmiri carpets which are worth gold.Senior artisans of Srinagar can make fine papier machie work. One can see the different shades of rose petals drawn on papier machie work with a magnifying glass. India has many craft traditions namely rose wood, coir, cane and mask of Kerala, dhokra craft of Odisha and Chhattisgarh, religious paintings of Odisha, Himachal Pradesh, AP and Bihar, wood craft of Bastar tribe, the warli paintings of Maharashtra, the bidri craft of Bidar, bangles and pearl work of Hyderabad, embroidery work of Gujarat, paintings of Rajasthan and hundreds of exotic crafts from different parts of India. India can have a big share of world artisans products which is estimated at $ 800 billion.Decorative itemsLike bio degradable utility and decorative items, Indians knew organic farming practices in the later Vedic period from 1000 BC to 600 BC. Organic farming is going to be the future agriculture. As per The World of Organic Agriculture: Statistics & Emerging Trends 2016, the global organic food market reached $80 billion in 2014 and is growing at 10% per annum, India can tap the ancient organic farming techniques which are still practiced in many places.Tribal in Malkangiri of Orissa grow organic turmeric, horse gram, green gram, tur daal, small rajma and mango jelly. Dedicated research on organic farming, district-wise bio diversity survey and documentation of the farming practices can evolve a well thought out national organic farm policy.Houses in India were also built to suit different climatic conditions. One can come across houses with roof made with tile, nim leaves, wood and clay were made to offset summer heat in Karimnagar district of Telangana. A simple mason from Kerala understands the geographical and climatic condition well. Houses with sloping roof of clay tiles, palm leaves, hard wood and timber used to fight harsh sun, heavy rain, the wet and humid condition in Kerala.Bamboo, cane, cane leaves, mud, and lime used for the building material in North East India were most suitable to the climatic condition of the region. There are houses made of wood with slanting roof of stone slates to fight rain and snow in Himachal Pradesh.One can come across a wide range of dress material which are made according to different climates of the country. Like the dress materials, Indians knew how to prepare the widest variety of nutritious homemade food in the world. How to tap Indias huge economic potential enshrined in Indian way of life is the biggest challenge before the Modi government."

The yield has reduced to one-third of last years harvest, they rue. Out of five acres, I could harvest just eight bags of green gram, each of 100 kg, against 22 bags last year, said S. Muthukumar of Athukudi village. The price which stood at Rs. 6,000 has come down to just Rs. 5,200.Ditto with blackgram crop. S. Vasanthan, another farmer from the same village, said he raised black gram on an acre. Against six bags last year, he could get only three now. The price of each bag, which stood at Rs. 13,000 last year, had come down to Rs. 6,800.Adding to the list of woes was the rodent menace, which caused extensive damage to the crop when it was nearing harvest.To the farmers, the fall in prices against a low yield was a mystery. Especially, when they had not marketed their produce immediately and waited for the demand to increase in order to get better returns.But wholesale dealers said the abundant supply of green gram and black gram from adjoining states, particularly Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka, resulted in the fall in the prices of the two crops. Though the yield was poor in Tamil Nadu, the adjoining states registered a steady increase in terms of yield."

Chandrababu Naidus plan to popularise and promote traditional and authentic Andhra cuisine internationally has sent a team of the Tourism wing on a delicious trail of identifying and moderating to add nutritional value to the most authentic traditional dishes, some of which are on the verge of extinction.A team led by Andhra Pradesh Tourism Authority (APTA) Joint Director Sudha Kumar, a culinary expert, is currently engaged in identifying and perfecting healthy recipes.There are some not-very-popular traditional recipes with the health factor intact in them. Ingredients such as pounded rice, organic vegetables and fresh local raw components add that extra flavour to Andhra cuisine, says Mr. Kumar and cites the example of a unique idli -making practice in Ambajipet of Konaseema region. It is called Pottikkal. Fermented idli batter is wrapped in jackfruit leaves in the shape of a cone and steam-cooked. The aroma of jackfruit leaves enhances the flavour of the idli , lending the dish a unique touch, explains Mr. Kumar, informing that the pyramid idli served with ulavacharu (the concentrated extract of horse gram) is very healthy.Method of cookingLeaves and flowers of drumstick, jackfruit and amla which have medicinal value, are also being brought into use. Method of cooking and use of traditional utensils like brass vessels and earthen pots, not seen much these days, is yet another focus area.The recipes thus culled out will be referred to a team of nutritionists for their expert advice and endorsement besides roping in an ayurvedic doctor to present his point of view on the identification of medicinal value of each recipe.After consulting with some of the top chefs in Hyderabad, Mr. Kumar and his team have identified about 30 recipes in different categories.AppetisersIn the appetisers section are delicacies such as Nalleru kada vada (vada made with the stem of Nalleru, a medicinal plant) and kobbari kudumulu (coconunt dumplings): under main course, mulaga puvvu thalimpu (tempered drumstick flower) and arati puvvu-pesara kura (banana flower-green gram curry); cereals- menthe kura-tomato annam (fenugreek leaves-tomato rice) and dampudu biyyam pesara molakala pulao (pulao with hand-pounded rice and green gram sprouts); pulses- Chintha chiguru pappu (dal with tender tamarind leaves) and in the non-vegetarian category dosakai mamsam (meat with yellow cucumber) and sora puttu (a fish delicacy).The team members are on an elaborate exercise of standardising each of these recipes for taste, texture, yield and nutritional balance. The cooked samples will be sent to the National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibrating Laboratories (NABL) to evaluate the amount of carbohydrates, proteins and based on their feedback, the recipes will be further modified if need be.The final details of the recipes will take the form of a book that will be printed and published for public use. The Tourism Authority also plans to host food festivals across the country and cookery contests in the State.We can embrace healthy food with simple tips. Substitute use of sugar with brown sugar, palm jaggery or fruit syrups. For example, Kakinada khaja can be made using sugar syrup made with pineapple juice, banana juice or strawberry juice, he says. Eliminate deep frying which absorbs more oil and take to concealed way of cooking (dum style of cooking). Use more of ingredients like yellow pumpkin, raw banana flowers and stem, drumstick leaves, methi leaves and cow ghee."

CBSE's regional office in Chennai, which takes care of Maharashtra along with southern states (excluding Kerala), refused to share state-specific data for comparison.CBSE Delhi HQ has always shared only region specific data, which give a bird's-eye view, but leaves many questions unanswered. The state specific data was sometimes officially, sometimes unofficially, sourced from respective regional offices. There is no reason assigned by CBSE for refusing to share statewise data, and with every regional office lording over a huge geographical area, there seems to be no problem for people running the show to be answerable.A CBSE school principal said, ""While we can access data related to our students, it will be great to see how different states and even cities are performing. What such data does is that it provides us with benchmarks and helps to analyse indicators through which we can perform better."" Schools have often complained that both Chennai regional office and the Delhi HQ are unresponsive to queries.On the other hand, it is no secret that CBSE is short-staffed in many areas. Never having an 'inspection' mandate meant it did not have presence in every state where its affiliated schools are present. The Chennai regional office looks after a humungous geographical area, including Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Maharashtra and Goa. With zero staff members outside Chennai, CBSE falls short when it comes to speed in responding.A source in the board told TOI that the IT staff, which computes results data and makes it public, have not left office for the last two days. The source added that in such cases tasks are prioritized and releasing data gets missed out.GIRLS BETTER 2016 MARKPass percentageOverall 82.02Girls 87.50 88.58 (2016)Boys 78.0078.85 (2016)Appeared numbersBoys 5,78,961 5,64,213Girls 4,40,399 4,28,443No re-evaluation this yearThe CBSE will not entertain requests for revaluation, starting this year.

Unable to handle the devotees frenzy during the distribution of the laddu hours before the immersion of the deity on the 11th day, the Khairatabad Ganesh Utsav Committee is contemplating replacing the giant laddu that adorns Ganesh's left palm with a smaller locally made one or one made of Plaster of Paris.""This year, there will be no giant laddu or Maha Prasadam prepared by PVVS Mallikarjuna Rao , owner of Suruchi Laddu based in Tapeswaram in East Godavari district of Andhra Pradesh. If no local donor comes forward for the preparation of a smaller laddu, we will go with one made of PoP,"" Khairatabad Ganesh Utsav Committee organising secretary S Raj Kumar told STOI.From the year 2010, Mallikarjuna Rao has been offering the Khairatabad Ganesha the Maha Prasadam that came to be known as the Tapeswaram Laddu. Until 2009, the organizers used to offer a laddu that was no more than 10 kg. Apparently, the laddumaker from East Godavari had visited the Khairatabad Ganesha in 2009 wherein his daughter wondered as to why should the sweet offering to a giant Ganesha be such a small one. Taken in by her observation, Mallikarjuna approached the organisers and offered to donate a big laddu to the deity from then on. The bonanza for the devotees of the elephant god began in 2010. Beginning with a 500 kg laddu that year, Mallikarjuna Rao increased the quantity to 2,400 kg in 2011 to 6,000 kg in 2015. For the donor, making the laddu was a humungous task and a costly one too. The 6,000 kg laddu needed 2,600 kg of sugar, 1,500 kg of ghee, 1,500 kg of bengal gram, 200 kg of cashewnuts, 200 kg of badam, 30 kg of cardamom and cost him a whopping Rs 18 lakh.But by then, the scramble for a piece of the Maha Prasadam turned into a law and order problem, leading to lathicharge on a few occasions during the distribution of the laddu before the immersion. Devotees would assemble by midnight and stand in queues to have the laddu. Besides, in 2013, incessant rains damaged the laddu leading to it being dumped in Hussainsagar. With both the police and organizers pleading helplessness, Mallikarjuna Rao decided to trim the size of the laddu and donated a 500 kg laddu in 2016.For 2017, the committee is scouting for a city-based sweet maker who would come forward and donate the laddu, though not of the size that Mallikarjuna Rao used to offer.

In any case, from now on, the giant Khairatabad Ganesh would make his annual appearance but the giant laddu has taken the bow."

The seized pulses would be sent for laboratory examination. The accused person was procuring adulterated pulses from Jaipur in Rajasthan and supplying the same to kirana shops and others in Karimnagar town.Commissioner of Police VB Kamalasan Reddy visited the spot and appreciated the Task force police. On this occasion, the Commissioner of Police warned the persons involved in adulteration of food commodities of criminal cases and if continued frequently they would even register PD Act.He called upon the people to inform the police if they notice any adulteration of food commodities in the district. Food inspector Amruthasri, Karimnagar one town inspector T Srinivas Rao, Task Force sub-inspectors Kiran and Santosh and their team were also present.Khammam Special Correspondent writes:The Police Commissioner's task force on Tuesday seized a large quantity of packets containing adulterated spices powder and substandard vermicelli, among other adulterated products, from a godown at Pumping Well Road in the three-town area here.The seizure of the adulterated spices powder and vermicelli packed in attractive packets came close on the heels of the busting of rackets in adulteration of garlic paste and other powdered food products, considered essential ingredients in traditional recipes.The district had earned the dubious distinction of being a safe haven for organised gangs involved in illegal trade of adulterated chilli powder in the past.The Police Commissioners Task Force had unearthed cricket betting, toddy manufacturing, illegal rice and sand smuggling rackets in Khammam and elsewhere in the division ever since the special team was constituted in May this year.The sleuths handed over the seized material, including baking soda, to the three-town police for investigation."
5a0f0ba39855b76bf13d5760,‘Onion shortage for 15 more days’,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170812/jsp/odisha/story_166872.jsp,2017-08-12,"Caption There is a hue and cry over shortage of onions in the market. What is your department doing to address the issue? The states requirement of onion per annum is 5.5 lakh tonnes. We produce onion in only four districts  Nuapada, Balangir, Kalahandi and a part of Nabarangpur. We also produce some onion at Puruna Cuttack, which is located between Boudh and Phulbani. Despite all our efforts, the production of onion remains 1.5 lakh tonne per annum. We cannot preserve it for a long time. We have already exhausted our stock. To meet the shortfall of 4.5 lakh tonnes, we have to depend on Nashik in Maharashtra, Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh and also on Madhya Pradesh. But the damage to crops following floods in Maharashtra, onion produced in the interior parts of the state could not come. To check farmer suicides, the Maharashtra government started procuring onion at a higher price. So, only a few options are left for our traders to procure onion at a lower and competitive price. Sometimes our traders have had to buy onion at Rs 24 to Rs 26 a kg. I asked the traders and my department officials to sell onion with a profit margin of just Re 1, which will meet the transportation and preservation costs. How long will the shortage persist? It may take another 15 days. One cant store onion, as it is a perishable commodity. So there can be no hoarding. I have already sent a message to everybody that the government would take strong action if they do any mischief. Now, the businessmen have started cooperating with the department. Is it not an irony that despite the fact that we do not produce sufficient onion, our farmers had to resort to distress sale? Yes, there was distress sale. This was due to the fact that onion from neighbouring Madhya Pradesh where it was selling for Rs 2 per kg flooded our markets. The traders from Madhya Pradesh also asked our farmers to sell the onion at that price. However, we intervened and brought the onion price to Rs 7 per kg. But we cannot preserve it for long. Why dont you implement the Market Intervention System to rescue farmers? For market intervention, there has to be a consensus between the Centre and the state government as the price will be shared in the ratio of 50:50. We have already announced MIS for mung and biri dal. Two days ago, I told the officials that groundnut should be purchased at Rs 42.20 per kg. In the case of onion, they did not agree. Onion cultivation is not confined to Odisha but spread over many states. The governments failure to build a chain of cold storage may be one of the factors that has led to the distress sale... That is a wrong notion. We have nearly 42 cold stores in the private sector across the state. Besides, we have nearly seven cold stores around the capital city. A number of cold storages are there in Berhampur, my hometown. We have 24 cold stores in a bad condition. When the proposal came to me for their repair, I strongly suggested that these units be privatised. Let the private party undertake repairs and do business. The business cannot be run by the government. Every year, we face distress sale of various agricultural produce. How can this problem be solved? Everything is related to demand and supply. If suddenly there is excess supply, the prices will plummet and it becomes difficult to arrest it. Thats the time the government needs to intervene. We are doing so now. In the case of paddy, we have decided whatever the quantity of rice produced in our state, we will procure it from the farmers. Last year, we procured 56 lakh metric tonnes of rice. I have asked the primary agriculture societies to purchase paddy from the sharecroppers. What will you do with so much of surplus rice? Under the food security programme, we are giving 5 kg of rice per head. We will use up 30 lakh metric tonnes of rice under the programme. The rest of the rice will be procured by the Food Corporation of India. We also export rice to Punjab, Haryana, Jharkhand, Bihar and Karnataka. We are the third largest producer of rice in the country. You are part of a ministerial committee that discussed the issue of sharecroppers being given certain rights vis-a-vis the landowners. When will committees report be ready? Nearly 90 per cent landowners give their land to sharecroppers for farming. There is a fear among landowners that if they declare that they are leasing out land for cultivation purpose, their land will be taken away. Keeping this concern in mind, we are now emphasising on real cultivators. But as the issue is a controversial one, we have to secure the interest of the sharecroppers as well as farmers. It will take some more time to resolve the issue. You have staged a came back to the ministry. Earlier, a section of leaders from Ganjam claimed that they had lobbied for your inclusion in the government. Its the prerogative of the chief minister to pick up people for inclusion in the ministry. He also decides who he will use for party work and other purposes. When I was not in the ministry, he had used my services extensively in west Odisha and other parts of the state for the partys work. I never felt for a moment that I was out of favour with Naveen babu. Later, he brought me back to the ministry. Lobbying does not work. BJP national president Amit Shah launched his party programme Mo Booth Sabuthu Majboot (My booth is the strongest) from Ganjam. Your party must have been worried. BJP is a national party and it has formed the government at the Centre. The party has also formed governments in a number of states. Now, they are facing anti-incumbency in Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and other states. They have already lost Punjab and managed to form government in Goa. They are in alliance in Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and some other parts of the country. They are making efforts to enter newer areas. Now, they have set eyes on Odisha, Bengal and some other states. They are making all-out efforts to strengthen their organisational base. But, they will not be successful in Odisha as long as Naveen babu is here. But the anti-establishment factor also works against the BJD. No. We are taking up need-based programmes for development of the people. Naveens image is imprinted in the minds of people. Earlier, you equated Naveen babu as lord Krishna who drives the chariot (state) and Pyari Mohan Mohapatra as Arjun, who shoots the arrows. After Pyari Mohan, who is the Arjun now in the party? After the Mahabharat war was over all the Pandavas started claiming that they had defeated the Kauravas. But one Belalasena said he had seen only a wheel chopping off heads. Similarly, here Naveen babu is Krishna and there is no need for Arjuna as this war is different from the Mahabharat battle. What is the major challenge for the party in 2019? The Congress is almost a spent force. The space vacated by it is now being filled up by the BJP. Many Congress leaders are joining the BJP in the hope of getting a ticket. They are also spreading their network. Despite BJP emerging as a challenge, they will be no match for Naveen babus image and our programmes for the people. What do you consider more important: loyalty to the party leader (Naveen Patnaik) or efficiency at work? Both loyalty and hard work are required to be successful."
5a12bcd79855b76bf13e18e3,Satellite imagery to the aid of sons of soil,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/satellite-imagery-to-the-aid-of-sons-of-soil/article19568467.ece,2017-08-27,"Can a mix of satellite imagery, artificial intelligence, Internet of things, and big data analytics come down to earth in aid of the sons of soil? Can it help farmers to get bank loans, timely and correct insurance claims, may be even ensure a good MSP (minimum support price) for their crop?A handful of space entrepreneurs, aged around 30 or less, worked on it and created a map-based digital framework or dashboard over the last 18 months to show that it can.Abhishek Raju, SatSure Ltd.s directorAsia, and Prateep Basu, chief operating officer, who founded the company, say that by marrying satellite imagery-based information with ground data, they hope to improve the livelihood of farmers without directly working with them.By reducing the risks associated with Indias weather-based farming, their solution, they say, should make it easier for the farmer to earn more; and get agricultural credit and insurance and its settlement at the right time. In the bargain, the government spends less on insurance premium doles; and agriculture insurance companies make less payouts. And it can work as a scientific basis for fixing MSPs.Collating dataStarting in early 2016, a bunch from SatSure worked their home Internet over six months to pull data from Indian and European satellites and old imageries from the U.S. Landsat. They keyed in latitudes and longitudes of little known places across the country to stack them up with local socio-economic data. To this they added mandi-level commodity prices down to a piece of land, potential prices, and historical rates.SatSure, with its bases in London, Switzerland, and data centres in Dubai, now has a humungous 1.5 petabytes of data, says Mr. Basu. We are easily the first in India to do satellite data integration on a Hadoop-based system and large area analytics.Last year, they began their pilot over a total of 250 hectares in Andhra Pradeshs Srikakulam district. They randomly chose different crops grown on farmlands measuring 20 to 30 acres each. Different mixes of fertilizer and water were tried out. At the end of the 2016 seasons  the summer kharif and the winter rabi  they could predict crop yields that were 85 to 90% accurate. It is an ongoing work and this has been now fine-tuned to 95%. Conventional or manual estimates are said to be less than 80%, they say.Forecasting crop yieldsHow does an accurate forecast of crop yields help the farmer or anyone else? Mr. Raju points out that not just the farmer but every stakeholder needs to know in advance the fate of the crop sown: the bank that lends him money for seeds and materials; the government that pays crop insurance premiums and announces MSPs; and the insurance agency that must pay the farmer if his crop fails.In July, the Comptroller and Auditor General picked holes in the implementation of agricultural insurance scheme during 201116 and pointed out delays in settling 84.5 lakh claims amounting to Rs. 14,000 crore. It said farmers did not get the full benefit of the Rs. 36,000 crore-plus that the Union and State governments had given out towards crop insurance premium subsidies.SatSures Google Earth-like navigable online dashboard will be customised and offered to users such as district collectors or deputy commissioners, decision makers, crop insurance companies, banks, and large single farmers.The dashboard, they explain, becomes the decision makers tool for interpreting yields assessed a month ahead of harvest, crop health, acreage, and planning the commodity logistics. Next, we will be working with insurance agencies on how many and where to do crop cutting experiments, how banks can use the data to give credit worthiness scores to farmers.Mr. Raju notes that the new Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana wants agencies to use technologies such as satellite remote sensing, ICT, and mobile phones to read risks and settle farmers claims quickly.Today, the two say, next-gen children of farmers are aware, use smartphones and understand modern solutions to their problems.Apart from its Andhra Pradesh activity and working with private farms in Kolar and Mandya in Karnataka, SatSure is partnering a crop insurance project in Gujarat and also in the Marathwada region of Maharashtra."
5a10b4809855b76bf13d9c43,Shortage looms as ‘Sona Masuri’ not sown in Tungabhadra area this year,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/shortage-looms-as-sona-masuri-not-sown-in-tungabhadra-area-this-year/article19572749.ece,2017-08-28,"Perhaps for the first time in history, the Department of Water Resources has not released water from Tungabhadra reservoir to the command area for even the first crop this year. As a result, the vast cultivation area of the premium Sona Masuri rice brand here has remained unsown.The water crisis, affecting around 20 lakh farmers and labourers in the command area, is likely to trigger a migration. There are also fears it could lead to a serious shortage of this high-quality rice in the market.Consumers in Karnataka, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and other parts of the country, as well as those in Singapore, Dubai and Sri Lanka, are likely to be hit as the rice variety grown in the Tungabhadra belt is of high quality and is sought after.At present, the reservoir has 57 tmcft of water, against its capacity of 133 tmcft. This includes 32 tmcft of slit accumulated over the past 50 years. Considering the evaporation losses, drinking water requirements, and the share of undivided Andhra Pradesh, hardly 35 tmcft of water will be left in the reservoir for the States irrigation. Given the poor inflow, the reservoir cannot meet the demand of 80 tmcft for taking up paddy cultivation on around 6 lakh acres spread over three districts  Ballari, Koppal and Raichur.Water releaseAccording to sources in the Department of Water Resources, water will be released into the canals in the first week of September for farmers to cultivate rabi crops such as chickpea, green gram, sunflower and sorghum, which require relatively less water. The Tungabhadra Irrigation Consultative Committee (TICC) is scheduled to meet in Bengaluru on Tuesday to finalise the schedule and amount of water to be released from the reservoir.In 2016-17, which witnessed the lowest inflow, water was provided with difficulty for kharif crops. Paddy growers then managed to scrape through before the closure of canals, but cotton and chilli growers suffered Going by that experience and the reduced inflow to the dam in August, farmers are not taking any risks. Meanwhile, the TICC has been very cautious in releasing water into the canals as top priority is being given to overcoming the looming drinking water crisis.Furthermore, farmers who have grown paddy plants for the purpose of selling them to other farmers for transplantation are feeling the heat as their saplings are growing old in nursery beds with no buyers."
5a145c879855b76bf13e3905,Kharif foodgrain output may fall 2.78%: Govt estimates,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/kharif-foodgrain-output-may-fall-2-78-govt-estimates/articleshow/60837520.cms,2017-09-26,"NEW DELHI: India's summer-sown foodgrain production is likely to fall nearly 3 per cent , dashing hopes of higher farm income, because of erratic rainfall and farmers shifting to other remunerative crops.Output of kharif, or summer-sown crops, is expected to fall to 134.67 million tonnes from the record 138.52 million tonnes last year, a fall of 2.8 per cent , according to the government's first formal estimate of the harvest. It makes four 'advance estimates' in the course of the year.This is expected to hit rural incomes in some areas, although the government said the harvest of 134.67 million tonnes, estimated with the help of inputs from states and other sources, would still be 5 per cent higher than the five-year average of 128.24 million tonnes.""The country has adequate stock of foodgrain. So on food security front, there is nothing to worry about. But farmers in rain-fed areas may be hard-hit and their income might go down if prices don't recover,"" said former agriculture secretary Siraj Hussain.He said lower production may hit rural economy and buying capacity of farmers. ""The government has to ensure farmer gets minimum support price for pulses, soyabean and cotton . Also, a stable trading regime needs to be ensured for commodity prices to recover.""Experts said food prices are likely to remain steady. This year's monsoon is about 5 per cent below average, but some parts of the country were flooded while others were relatively dry, hurting kharif output.However, the recent surge in rainfall will help the winter-sown, or rabi, crop because of good soil moisture and more water in reservoirs.Production of rice, the main kharif crop, is estimated to be 94.48 million tonnes, or 1.98 per cent less than the previous year. There was a small drop in paddy acreage, to 37.68 million hectares from 38.18 million hectares a year earlier, on account of deficient rains in a number of districts in Chhattisgarh , Telangana, Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka.""Rice is one commodity in which we have been self-sufficient since 1991-92,"" grain analyst Tejinder Narang said. ""There are unlikely to be a spike in prices. In winter, planting of rice will take place in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana which can make up the deficit.""Output of kharif pulses such as tur, moong and urad is estimated at 8.71million tonnes against 9.42 million tonnes last year. The ministry cited a shift by farmers to more remunerative crops like sugarcane and cotton for this 7.5 per cent fall in production.Lokesh Goenka, managing director of U Goenka Sons that trades in agriculture commodities, said this would have no major impact on prices in the short run. Area under pulses this season was 14.12 million hectares, 3.47 per cent less than last year.Production of oilseeds such as groundnut, soyabean and castorseed is estimated to decrease by 7.68 per cent over the previous year to 20.68 million tonnes, with farmers shifting to urad, sugarcane and cotton on expectation of higher profitability, the government said.Solvent Extractors' Association of India president Atul Chaturvedi said the Indian farmer was losing interest in the oilseed crop as it was not remunerative compared with others.Sugarcane production is estimated at 337.69 million tonnes, higher by 30.97 million tonnes than the last year. Area under sugarcane has increased by 9.4 per cent .According to Abinash Verma, director-general of Indian Sugar Mills Association, ""The government's estimates are very similar to ISMA's which was 340-345 million tonnes. ""Despite an 18.68 per cent increase in area coverage this season, lower productivity of cotton has resulted in reduced estimated production of 32.27 million bales (of 170 kg each) as compared to 33.09 million bales in 2016-17, said the ministry."
