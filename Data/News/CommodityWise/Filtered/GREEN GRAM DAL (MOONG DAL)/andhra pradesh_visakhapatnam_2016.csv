58f67369a3d24b0b70c2b996,Rich yield from black gram farming,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/rich-yield-from-black-gram-farming/article8087836.ece,2016-01-10,"A group of enthusiastic farmers have proved that Keralas climatic conditions are favourable for cultivation of black gram. The leguminous pulse crop has been successfully raised by Mahima, a group of 15 women, engaged in works under the Mahatma Gandhi Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme, in Ward 15 of Cheriyanad grama panchayat in Chengannur.On four centsThe group took 90 cents of land on lease for group farming and cultivated tapioca, elephant foot yam, colocasia, and green gram. The women took up black gram cultivation on a trial basis on four cents of land and found it successful. The harvest was made after one and half months of sowing. Encouraged by the short harvesting period and good returns, they have raised a second crop and are awaiting harvest.Black gram is generally cultivated in States such as Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh. The higher market value of the crop could be reason enough to expand the area under black gram cultivation, according to farm experts."
5904ea097be9e04154dfda83,"Farmer suicides is no fashion trend, Mr Gopal Shetty",http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/minorityview/farmer-suicides-is-no-fashion-trend-mr-gopal-shetty/,2016-02-18,"The BJP Member of Parliament from Maharashtra Gopal Shettys statement that it has become a fashion among farmers to commit suicide is ignoble. It not only points to an utter lack of sensitiveness to the plight of the farmers but also points to the ignorance of the difficult conditions in which farmers operate with hardly any infrastructure or help from the government. A cursory glance of the most recent report of the NSSO on Some Aspects of Farming in India brought out earlier this week will most certainly enlighten the honourable BJP MP in this regard.According to the report, which surveyed farmers for the two periods July to December 2012 and January to June 2013, the average cropped area of an Indian farmer was less than one hectare. While the average value of total crop production per agriculture household was Rs 40, 580 in the second part of the year which includes the khariff crop it was at a still lower Rs 36,696 in the first half of the year which included the rabi season. This is a far cry from the hefty payments doled out to the government employees by the various pay commissions and often for very unproductive work.The farmer has very little access to modern inputs and was heavily dependent on the local traders and their own farm for seeds and other farm inputs. Moreover what is worse is that the survey shows that the central and state governments have not been able to spread awareness of the various government programs to help farmers including the widely used minimum support prices which is to protect the farmers from any distress sales during periods of good harvests. And even the minor segment which is aware of the minimum support prices sold their produce to procurement agencies and benefited from the program.But it is not the governments ability to inform the farmers about minimum support prices which galls the experts. More important is the government inability to provide any kind of insurance to cover for the risks the farmers take through large investments in each cropping season. While the share of agriculture households insured was in low double digits in crops like moong, groundnut, soya bean and cotton it was less than 5% in important cereals like paddy and wheat. Numbers on most major crops show that less than half the farmers were aware of crop insurance schemes and even among those aware of such schemes very few had any idea of the facilities it provided.However, the biggest default on the farm front is the governments apparent inability to provide extension service for the farmers. Less than 3% of the agriculture households who were keen on updating technologies have access to the support of krishivigyan kendras, agriculture universities or NGOs. Hardly 6% had access to services of extension agents. Similarly 7-8% of the agriculture households can avail of services of private commercial agents or veterinary departments. The largest source of agriculture households access to technical advice was progressive farmers and media like radio, television, newspaper and internet which accounted for almost a 20% share each.There is also substantial disparities in the access to technical advice for agriculture household across states. Among major states almost two third of the farmer households has access to technical advice during the khariff crop in the states of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Kerala. In contrast the access to technical advice to farmer household was the least in Jharkhand, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh where it was just around a quarter.These numbers give an idea of the innumerable hurdles that Indian farmers have to face to eke out a marginal existence on the fringes of the economy. The government inability to provide even basic facilities like extension or insurance facilities either directly or through private agencies point to bankrupt polices which has forced many a farmer to take their own life especially when input costs and cost of farming practices have soared up in recent years. Gopal Shetty, the BJP Member of Parliament from Maharashtra should try to educate himself about the sad plight of the farmers before he makes such ignoble statements about them."

58f4c07460de4776e369496f,Costly pulses hit domestic budget,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160419/jsp/odisha/story_80836.jsp,2016-04-19,"POCKET PINCH Cuttack, April 18: Dal is missing from the menu of several households as the prices of pulses have gone up in the past week across the state. Primarily, the high cost of pulses in Maharastra, Chhattisgarh, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka - from where the state procures dal - is responsible for the price hike. Besides, the state government's norms - fixing the limit of stocking pulse - have also added to the consumers' woes. The retail prices of pulses have registered a hike varying from Rs 5 to Rs 15 per kilogram. At present, arhar dal is being sold at Rs 148 to Rs 150 per kg at the retail markets. The rate of chana dal has also gone up to Rs 80 to Rs 82 per kg against the retail price of Rs 73 to Rs 78 last week. There has been no change in the retail price of moong dal, which is being sold at Rs 85 to Rs 90 per kg. But, the prices of biri dal have gone to Rs 145 per kg from Rs 120 and the rate of masoor dal stands at Rs 85 per kg while it was being sold at Rs 75 at the retail markets last week. Harapriya Samal, a working woman from Jhanjirmangala, said: ""Rice is our staple diet, and our meal is incomplete without dal. So, we are now forced to buy dal at such high rates,"" said Samal. Malgodown traders, however, put the blame on bulk procurement by several multi-national companies, who are now procuring pulses from the farmers. The state requires seven lakh metric tonnes of pulses per annum, while only 80,000 tonnes to one lakh metric tonnes are produced here. A Cuttack Chamber of Commerce official said the pulses' prices were expected to rise due to the existing curb on stocking pulses. At present, a trader is only allowed to stock 750 quintals of pulses according to the government norms. ""If the stock limit is raised, then only the prices of pulses can be kept under control at least for a month despite the high procurement rate as there will be adequate stock to meet the requirement,"" said the official. ""Various big companies are now directly procuring essential commodities from farmers, and as the prices of pulses are high at the point of purchase, there has been a gap in the supply which has pushed the prices,"" said Cuttack Chamber of Commerce joint secretary Prafula Chatoi, who said they had submitted a memorandum to the district administration demanding an increase in the stock limit for traders to 5,000 quintals. On the other hand, Cuttack collector Nirmal Chandra Mishra convened an emergency meeting to review the situation here today, and the Malgodown traders were asked to report the wholesale and retail prices on a daily basis. ""There is an adequate stock at Malgodown. We also urge the consumers not to resort to panic buying as the wholesale prices at Malgodown have been stable for the past two to three days,"" said the collector."
58fed95a7be9e0420db28460, still dear after VAT cut,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160719/jsp/odisha/story_97423.jsp,2016-07-19,"Bhubaneswar, July 18: The price of various varieties of dal have not decreased as expected despite the state government reducing the value-added tax (VAT) on pulses from five to one per cent from July 1. Gram dal has instead become costlier. The price of arhar dal fallen but that of other pulses has not reduced as expected. Arhar dal is now sold in the retail market at Rs 140 a kg, moong dal at Rs 120 a kg and gram dal at Rs 110 a kg. On June 28, when the cabinet had decided to revise VAT on dal, chief secretary Aditya Prasad Padhi said: ""The traders had promised that if the VAT was revised, it would not affect revenue collection and would have a positive impact on the prices that would be passed on to the consumers. We will observe during the next three months the impact of VAT revision on revenue collection and price revision. We will then take the final call."" Federation of All-Odisha Traders' Association general secretary Sudhakar Panda had said that the VAT revision would definitely bring the prices down. However, observing the situation, food supplies secretary P.K. Mohapatra had shot off a letter to all district collectors asking them to conduct market studies on the wholesale and retail prices of dal. ""We are keeping a close watch on the market situation and will recommend action against unscrupulous traders,"" said deputy director, market intelligence, Pravakar Rout. Panda said VAT had been reduced by four per cent and it has had its impact on the dal prices. ""The arhar dal price has fallen from Rs 140 to Rs 130 a kg. The price of moong has also fallen correspondingly."" He, however, conceded that the gram dal price had climbed by Rs 30 a kg. ""We have no control over the price of gram dal because it has been listed under the National Commodity Exchange. The price fluctuates based on speculation,"" he said, adding that they had urged the Centre to de-list gram dal from the National Commodity Exchange. ""But the Centre has not accepted our demand."" Panda, however, hoped that the prices would fall in the coming days, as dal cultivation in Maharashtra, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh had been higher this year because of favourable weather conditions."

Most may have just heard this but Dr Ravindra Kolhe can vouch for it. Born in the temple town of Shegaon, he listened to sermons of saints who visited the place. ""They had a deep impact on my heart and mind,"" says the doctor who had his early education at a local school in Marathi medium.Suffering with a congenital heart ailment termed as primary pulmonary hypertension, Kolhe says frequent hospitalization and frail health made him a voracious reader. ""I got very good marks in Std X and wanted to become an engineer. But my teachers said I should go for medicine.""Kolhe moved to Wardha and enrolled at JB Science College. ""It was here that I came under the influence of Gandhi and Vinobha Bhave. Their ideologies had a deep impact on my mind.""Good marks in Std XII ensured a seat in Government Medical College, Nagpur. ""Here, too, I looked around for a library and found one at Ramkrishna Mission,"" he says. By this time Kolhe had realized that he had to work in rural area. ""I read John Ruskin's book 'Unto This Last' and was impressed by it. I was also in the company of seers at the Ramkrishna Math and would discuss the purpose of life with them.""By the time he was in the final year, he had formed a group called Sangharsh with his batch mates and they worked in the Babulkheda slum behind the medical college. ""It was at this time that I read the book 'Where There is No Doctor' written by a Spanish revolutionary. The book cover had an image of four persons carrying a patient on a stretcher and there was a milestone on which it was written -- hospital 30 miles. That image remained imprinted in my mind and when I passed out I decided to hunt for a village from where a hospital was 30km away,"" says the doctor.Though he wanted to rush to rural areas, ""my seniors advised me that I should first learn to do deliveries single-handedly, diagnose pneumonia with stethoscope and should be able to treat diarrhoea"", he says. Two house jobs in Mumbai equipped him with these skills.""My professors Dr Dinoo Dalal and Dr Minoo Advani took me through an intensive course in mother and child care,"" he says. On October 30, 1984, when Dr. Kolhe was just 23 years old, he went searching for the ideal village and travelled through Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Maharashtra.""I finally identified Bairagad in Amravati district on Feb 9, 1985. My batchmate and I began working from a veranda of a house,"" he says. But realization that they can't handle surgical emergencies made them decide that they should complete post-graduation too.Kolhe enrolled in GMC for MD in preventive and social medicine in 1986. ""My professor Dr Motghare said that I should look for some more sustainable solutions and asked me to prepare a paper on tribal health. The data that I collected about the mother and child health of tribals at Dharni was dismal.""What he discovered during this compilation was malnutrition of children in Melghat. These findings reached out to the world as he was interviewed by BBC radio. ""Suddenly this issue of child mortality and malnutrition in Melghat got political attention as I identified 200 reasons for it.""But after completing his MD, Dr Kolhe's partner refused to return to the village. ""This made it imperative that I get married as alone I could not serve the community."" But the conditions that he laid out for his would-be wife were tough. ""I wanted to marry a woman who would run the house in 400 per month, walk up to 40km, would agree for a registered marriage and be prepared to beg for others.""Ironically, the woman he married was a far cry. ""I was running a homeopathy clinic and earning lots of money. I was fashion conscious and would travel across the city just to match my footwear with a sari,"" says Dr Smita, who was also an ABVP worker and a school mate of Nitin Gadkari. ""But these four conditions were acceptable to me as I would always think what is it in life that I want beyond what I have,"" she says.In 1988, she left behind her penchant for good clothes and a good life and moved with her husband to Bairagad. ""It was a trial marriage and would continue till she kept to these four conditions,"" says Kolhe.In the village, the couple got a new mud house built by the villagers. ""Drawing water from the well, getting the mud, cow dung and hay mixture right for the walls, cooking on firewood were things that I had never done in life,"" recalls Smita.Wearing a sari costing 10 purchased from ration shops, she began enjoying the scenic beauty of Melghat and got involved in the life of the villagers. ""I loved the beauty of the place and the simplicity of the tribals,"" she says.The couple has two sons and both studied at the local school. ""The elder one Rohit is an agriculturist and the younger, Ram is studying at the medical college in Akola. The elder one's wife is a farmer's daughter. She took time to adjust with our lifestyle but is now comfortable with it,"" Smita says and adds that luckily the sons agreed to follow their parent's lifestyle.Going beyond community service through medicine, the couple have also focused their attention to making the village economically strong. ""We took help of agriculture universities and began sowing potatoes, soya bean, cotton, sugar cane, jute, water melon, turmeric and summer moong. Amravati is known as the suicide district but there are no such events in Melghat,"" says the proud couple.""Child mortality came down to 40 per 1000 when we began working it was 200, mortality of preschool children is 100, previously it was 400. We have been able to make an operation theatre with the help of private aid and now there are 70 doctors in the region,"" said Kolhe.The couple also organizes a camp 'Tarunai' for youth which is about social orientation and community living. ""We did not set up any NGO. This village is our karambhoomi and we are happy with any progress that is made here."" There only grouse is the lack of electricity in the area. ""It stops us from doing much more,"" they say."

Pinning hopes on a similar windfall, onion growers increased cultivation. Maharashtra also recorded a good yield. The influx impacted prices and good quality onion is being purchased for Rs 900 a quintal while average quality is priced at Rs 300 a quintal, APMC Secretary H C Gajendra said.More than 70 loads of onion from Ramadurg, Bagalkot, Badami, Basavana Bagewadi, Lingsugur and other areas had arrived at the APMC yard on Saturday.We used to sell onion to other states earlier. This season, onion has been grown in large quantities in Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and Bihar as well. Due to low demand, price has dipped, said APMC trader Suresh Habib.Rudragouda Ninganagouda, a farmer from Katakol village in Ramadurg taluk, lamented that the current prices of onion were so low that it would be better to bury the crop in the fields instead of harvesting it. The government should help farmers by announcing minimum support price and by procuring onion directly from farmers, he said.Green gramThe price of green gram has also fallen, and it is being purchased for Rs 3,000 to Rs 5,000 a quintal. Compared to last year, green gram price had come down by Rs 3,000 to Rs 4,000 a quintal, trader Shivanna Adargunchi observed."

He sells it online after browsing through prices quoted by traders, clicks the best price and get paids online, all thanks to the Unified Marketing Platform (UMP), a model initiative of the Karnataka government It's changing the lives of farmers like Gowda like no other venture. The network has reached 18 lakh farmers, and is expanding by the day, making it the country's most ambitious rural initiative.""Middlemen have always been a bane for farmers in the agriculture markets as they shortchanged the small and marginal farmers by quoting the lowest prices. But with the successful launch of UMP, their role is increasingly getting eliminated as farmers get a far better price in the market,'' said Manoj Rajan, managing director and CEO, Rashtriya e-Market Services, the brain behind the venture.The UMP success can be gauged from the fact that wholesale dealers from Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Kerala, Haryana, West Bengal and Delhi have taken the unified trader licence to participate in Karnataka's online markets. Bulk institutional buyers like ADM, Cargill, ITC, Reliance, Metro Cash & Carry, Godrej Agro, Pepsico India and major traders have also opted for online trading.Currently, 142 markets across 28 districts have been brought under the UMP. Next year, 52 more markets will start transactions on UMP.Rajan said the new system has contributed to a significant rise in prices of copra, groundnut, tur, turmeric, Bengal gram, arecanut, dry chilli and green gram. For instance, the average price of copra increased from Rs 5,000-5500 a quintal in 2013 to Rs 10-000-14,000 a quintal in 2016, thanks to UMP.Farmer leader Mallesh added that the online system has created quality and price awareness among farmers but the biggest challenge for the government is to rope in more farmers into the systemRajan said around 18 lakh farmers have registered till date. The government launched a drive to bring in more farmers under the system in 11,000 villages across the state.Besides, he said, they have commenced assaying services in 10 markets to cover a minimum 15% of arrivals in the market. ""We have taken an ambitious programme of installing automated cleaning and grading machinery in APMC markets where the farmer's produce will be cleaned and packed before sale. The project will take off in 65 markets next year,'' he added.National NetworkRashtriya e-Market Services (ReMS), a joint venture of the state and NCDEX Spot Exchange was envisaged as a pan-Karnataka electronic trading portal which seeks to network the existing Agricultural Produce Market Committees (APMCs) and other market yards to create a unified national market for agricultural commodities. Karnataka's UMP promises more options for sale. For the local trader in the mandi (market), it also offers the opportunity to access a larger market for secondary trading. The gradual integration of all major mandis in the states will ensure common procedures for issue of licences, levy of fee and movement of produce. Over 5-6 years, the government expects significant benefits for farmers with integration of national markets.Driving the projectManoj Rajan, a 2008 IFS officer, was the brain behind the UMP which was launched in 2014. As managing director and CEO of ReMS, he decluttered the agriculture market riddled with middlemen and unfair trade practices. Manoj, who is from Kolar, used technology to provide a barrier-free agricultural market system. Rajan currently holds three important positions in the government since he has earned a reputation for innovation. Rajan, a graduate of Mysore University, also had a stint as a chief electoral officer and managing director of the Karnataka State Beverages Corporation.Showing the wayKarnataka's Unified Market Platform has now become a pan-India inititiative and model for several other states. The model was first showcased at the National Conference on Sustainable Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi at Gangtok in January 2016. He was quite impressed with it and did not hesitate to borrow the model from a Congress state. Andhra Pradesh has integrated seven markets on the lines of UMP. The state bagged the Quality Council of India's DL Shah Award-Platinum at the 11th National Quality Conclave 2016 in New Delhi recently.How UMP helps* Farmers have greater bargaining power compared to traders* Farmers are more aware of crop quality specifications* Greater transparency at every stage of transaction within a mandi* Electronic trading system allows buyers to bid in real time even if they're not physically present* E-auctioning system enabled sellers to participate, irrespective of proximity to mandi* APMC revenues increased due to online transactions* Transparency in registration process reduced evasion of market fee* Tender results announced daily at 1pm so farmers do not face uncertainty'Good delivery mechanism'Online trading can surely revolutionize agriculture marketing system provided it has a good delivery mechanism.

But with the successful launch of UMP, their role is increasingly getting eliminated as farmers get a far better price in the market,'' said Manoj Rajan , managing director and CEO, Rashtriya e-Market Services, the brain behind the venture.The UMP success can be gauged from the fact that wholesale dealers from Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Kerala, Haryana, West Bengal and Delhi have taken the unified trader licence to participate in Karnataka's online markets. Bulk institutional buyers like ADM, Cargill , ITC, Reliance, Metro Cash & Carry, Godrej Agro, Pepsico India and major traders have also opted for online trading.Currently, 142 markets across 28 districts have been brought under the UMP . Next year, 52 more markets will start transactions on UMP.Rajan said the new sys tem has contributed to a significant rise in prices of copra, groundnut, tur, turmeric, Bengal gram, arecanut, dry chilli and green gram. For instance, the average price of copra increased from Rs 5,000-5500 a quintal in 2013 to Rs 10-000-14,000 a quintal in 2016, thanks to UMP.Farmer leader Mallesh added that the online system has created quality and price awareness among farmers but the biggest challenge for the government is to rope in more farmers into the system Rajan said around 18 lakh farmers have registered till d a t e. T h e g ove r n m e n t launched a drive to bring in more farmers under the system in 11,000 villages across the state.Besides, he said, they have commenced assaying services in 10 markets to cover a minimum 15% of arrivals in the market. ""We have taken an ambitious programme of installing automated cleaning and grading machinery in APMC markets where the farmer's produce will be cleaned and packed before sale. The project will take off in 65 markets next year,'' he added."

She helps run a self-help group of 18 women in this village in Sangareddy district, which borders Karnataka and is 168 km from Hyderabad.The village is readying up for rabi sowing. Many of the villagers are Dalit tenant farmers. Chandramma and her husband decided to cultivate sugarcane this year. Already late to sow, they needed an urgent need to borrow Rs 30,000 from the nearest Andhra Pradesh Grameen Vikas Bank, 25 km away in Narayankhed, a town with just one other bank, SBI.That was when demonetisation struck. There are only three buses to Narayankhed; some days none. And then the bank, which had never said no to Chandramma in the past, refused to lend to her this time. So she turned to a money lender, borrowing at a monthly interest rate of 3 per cent or 36 per cent annually .As Chandramma speaks, two men join her side and she stops talking. Gunendar Rao and T Nandu Singh are both money lenders and do not seem pleased that Chandramma is talking to the press. Everything is fine here, one of them says. People are just a bit inconvenienced here. The banks will sort things out.Gunendar Rao decides to justify himself. I dont charge too much, just 3 per cent, which amounts to Rs 900 a month for Rs 30,000. Im trying to help these farmers because the banks arent giving them any money.Nandu picks up the theme, Now the banks dont have money to give, so they come to us. We dont have any problem accepting their Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes.There are whispers that the moneylenders take a cut of Rs 100 from each demonetised note.Kharamungi is separated from the Karnataka border by the Manjira river. Villagers can choose to cross the river and travel to Bidar, a distance of 15 km, or travel 40 km by public transport to the nearest agricultural market in Bidar. It is easier to get demonetised notes exchanged there than go to the Narayankhed banks. Narayankhed is the connecting point for 43 villages in Manoor mandal, serving over 50,000. Last Thursday, there were long queues snaking out of the towns two banks. The only ATM was closed in the morning and had a long queue in the evening.Pushpa Thakur has money due fromthe local dairy | SATHYA KEERTHIBack in Kharamungi, Pushpa Thakur and her husband dont own the home they inhabit with their son. In 2015, they borrowed Rs 40,000 from a money lender to farm a land they leased. The banks did not give them credit as they dont own the land. But the Manjira flooded that year, resulting in crop losses for most farmers in this village including Pushpa Thakur and her family. Pushpa switched to selling cows milk to Vijaya Diary to get by. But the dairy company has not made any payments for October and November. Everytime we ask them, they say next week. Now they say they dont have money, says Pushpa. She is afraid she will default on her payments to the moneylender.Demonetisation was sprung upon Kharamungi at a time when rabi crop sowing season was due. Now with banks and microfinance companies not lending to farmers owing to the currency shortage, farmers are left with no option but to approach the local moneylenders."

Papikonda forms part of the picturesque Eastern Ghats and a major portion of these hills will be submerged in the backwaters of the Polavaram dam across the Godavari.There are a number of plant and animal species endemic to the Papikonda hills and they will lose a major portion of their unique habitat once the dam is ready. The stripe-necked mongoose, which is a native of the Western Ghats and Sri Lanka, was discovered in Eastern Ghats earlier this year through camera trappings. This is the first time that this variety of mongoose has been found outside the Western Ghats. Wildlife enthusiasts fear that the stripe-necked mongoose will lose its new habitat even before zoologists could fully explore the animal. Incidentally, the animal was featured in the latest issue of the 'Journal of Threatened Taxa' published on December 26, the day AP government received Central funds for Polavaram.Research scholars, Kumpatla Balaji from the department of zoology in Andhra University , Visakhapatnam, and Jarugulla Eswar Satyanarayana, from the department of environmental sciences in Acharya Nagarjuna University , Guntur, have discovered the stripe-necked mongoose in the Papikonda hills. They not only obtained camera trappings but also sighted the animal in the Papikonda sanctuary. Though the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) in its latest 'Red List' classified stripe-necked mongoose as ""least concern"", wildlife activists argue that the Polavaram dam will rob the animal of its new habitat.Besides the new variety of mongoose, Balaji and Satyanarayana also spotted rare animals including the Gaur, Indian spotted eagle and Indian peafowl. ""Local tribes Konda Reddy, Koya Dora and Valmiki call the stripe-necked mongoose 'Yentawa mungisa'. There was a historical sight-record from the Horsley Hills in the Eastern Ghats but hitherto dismissed as doubtful. There has been no records of the stripe-necked mongoose from the entire range of the Eastern Ghats. Hence, this is the first photographic evidence,"" they said.The researchers emphasized the need for a thorough research on the conservation status of the stripe-necked mongoose.The threat to the animal should be studied in detail before the dam is ready."
