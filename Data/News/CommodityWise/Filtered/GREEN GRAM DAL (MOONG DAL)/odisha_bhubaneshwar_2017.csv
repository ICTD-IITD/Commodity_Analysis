5923bd157be9e01fcef058dc,Artisans need govt help to survive,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/591985/artisans-need-govt-help-survive.html,2017-01-17,"Artisans need govt help to surviveSudhansu R Das, Jan 18, 2017 23:31 ISTThe state govt should provide raw material to artisans, who have no direct access to buyers and exporters.For centuries Indians knew how to prepare utility and decorative items from material available in nature. The Rigveda literature gives description of different kinds of patras (containers) and household items. Later, the artisans with their skill and imagination added high value to those items which constituted one of the major items of Indias export.Economic historian Angus Maddison in his book The World Economy  A millennial perspective noted that from first century AD to 15th century AD, India was the worlds largest economy with 32.9% share of worlds GDP. The East India Company used to buy Indian goods worth five lakh pounds every year before 1757 AD for export.It is not only the art objects the Indians knew, the technique of building climate friendly houses and knew organic farming techniques. In fact, Indian economy was an extension of eco-system which can be rewoven to generate employment and foreign currency.The brassware industry of Moradabad has an estimated annual turnover of Rs 8,000 crore out of which Rs 6,000 crore come from export. Indian gold sector employ 2.5 million artisans to export gold ornaments worth $20 billion per annum.The wooden toy makers of Nirmal in Adilabad district of Telangana add high value to idols of gods and goddesses, large sized horses, elephants, eagle and figures from the Indian mythologies. Only about 50 artisans survive to work for one handicraft production centre of the state government. Their income hardly exceeds Rs 300 per day after nine hours of hard labour.The artisans do not have direct access to buyers and exporters. Here the state government should provide raw material-poniki wood, transparent marketing facility and social security to the artisans. In 1960s, every house in Salem had a loom. Today, hardly 100 handloom weavers struggle to keep the tradition alive.The handloom tradition has declined due to poor cooperative leadership, corruption and mismanagement. The weavers were forced to pay commission at the time of buying yarns, receiving order and while receiving payment which is delayed for more than one year. The majority of the buyers cannot distinguish a pure Salem silk from a mill-made one. Salem may miss all its genuine handloom weavers in the next five years.Similarly, the Paithani silk saree weavers of Aurangabad are left with little enthusiasm. Some 10 to 20 senior weavers in the city work for traders on daily wage basis. Genuine Kashmiri carpet is losing to mill made carpets which are sold in the name of Kashmiri carpets. Here, the state government should create awareness among buyers about the genuine Kashmiri carpets which are worth gold.Senior artisans of Srinagar can make fine papier machie work. One can see the different shades of rose petals drawn on papier machie work with a magnifying glass. India has many craft traditions namely rose wood, coir, cane and mask of Kerala, dhokra craft of Odisha and Chhattisgarh, religious paintings of Odisha, Himachal Pradesh, AP and Bihar, wood craft of Bastar tribe, the warli paintings of Maharashtra, the bidri craft of Bidar, bangles and pearl work of Hyderabad, embroidery work of Gujarat, paintings of Rajasthan and hundreds of exotic crafts from different parts of India. India can have a big share of world artisans products which is estimated at $ 800 billion.Decorative itemsLike bio degradable utility and decorative items, Indians knew organic farming practices in the later Vedic period from 1000 BC to 600 BC. Organic farming is going to be the future agriculture. As per The World of Organic Agriculture: Statistics & Emerging Trends 2016, the global organic food market reached $80 billion in 2014 and is growing at 10% per annum, India can tap the ancient organic farming techniques which are still practiced in many places.Tribal in Malkangiri of Orissa grow organic turmeric, horse gram, green gram, tur daal, small rajma and mango jelly. Dedicated research on organic farming, district-wise bio diversity survey and documentation of the farming practices can evolve a well thought out national organic farm policy.Houses in India were also built to suit different climatic conditions. One can come across houses with roof made with tile, nim leaves, wood and clay were made to offset summer heat in Karimnagar district of Telangana. A simple mason from Kerala understands the geographical and climatic condition well. Houses with sloping roof of clay tiles, palm leaves, hard wood and timber used to fight harsh sun, heavy rain, the wet and humid condition in Kerala.Bamboo, cane, cane leaves, mud, and lime used for the building material in North East India were most suitable to the climatic condition of the region. There are houses made of wood with slanting roof of stone slates to fight rain and snow in Himachal Pradesh.One can come across a wide range of dress material which are made according to different climates of the country. Like the dress materials, Indians knew how to prepare the widest variety of nutritious homemade food in the world. How to tap Indias huge economic potential enshrined in Indian way of life is the biggest challenge before the Modi government."

(Bhola Prasad) Jamshedpur, March 18: Odisha has joined hands with Tata Steel Adventure Foundation (TSAF), a Jamshedpur-based adventure outfit, to impart training in climbing to youths and empower them through expeditions - a wake-up call for Jharkhand. This initiative is a part of the Odisha State Youth Policy. All the activities will be conducted by TSAF under the banner of Biju Patnaik Himalayan Expedition. The Odisha government and TSAF were in talks since August last year. The adventure body had also conducted an expedition to Mount Rurdagaira on a pilot basis in the end of September last year. The tie-up materialised on March 5 following the visit of Rajender Singh Pal, an Everester and manager of TSAF, to Bhubaneswar to hold talks with officials involved with the state's youth policy. Selection trials began on March 6 in Bhubaneswar. Odisha team's co-ordinator Jogabyasa Bhoi said 75 youths participated in the trials held in Bhubaneswar. ""The list was pruned to 40 who were then sent to Jamshedpur. Of the 40 selected, 35 took part in the trials. TSAF will select 25 who will participate in an outdoor leadership course in Uttarkashi in May. Finally, 15 members will be shortlisted for an expedition to Thelu Peak in Garhwal Himalayas in May,"" he told The Telegraph. A team of 37 members from Odisha, including two support staffs, took part in various adventure activities in Tumung, Dimna lake and Dalma hills in Jamshedpur in the past one week. The members, belonging to the age group of 18-30, also did sport climbing at JRD Tata Sports Complex. ""The team did in caving, abseiling and rock climbing, besides an overnight camp at Tumung. The Dimna lake was reserved for rafting and raft-making. They trekked the Dalma hills on March 14,"" Pal said. Bhoi, who was in Jamshedpur with his assistant Soumyaranjan Sahu, said they were impressed with the way the outfit conducted the activities. The trials in Jamshedpur concluded on March 15. ""We would certainly like to strengthen our tie-up with TSAF. The association will boost adventure activities in our state,"" he said. A TSAF official said a formal MoU would be signed soon. The official said the Jharkhand government had never approached them to conduct such activities. ""We are open to such a proposal from the state government. But before that we will need to go through the terms and conditions and facilities. The Odisha government has given us a free hand in selecting expedition teams and conducting selection trials."" He said the Jharkhand government had approached them to manage tourism some three years back. ""But talks never made any headway."""

PTI File photoBJP chief Amit Shah today launched his party's expansion drive in five states from West Bengal's Naxalbari village, declaring development and progress will start from the place where the left-wing extremism had its origins in the late 1960s.Aiming to expand his partys footprint ahead of the 2019 general elections, Shah met BJP workers and said the Trinamool Congress will not be able to stop Narendra Modi's chariot and the ""lotus will bloom"" in Bengal.Union Minister Smriti Irani yesterday said that by starting his drive from booth number 93 at Naxalbari, Shah will give a message of solidarity to BJP workers, who have ""suffered"" violence there.The BJP has accused the ruling TMC of unleashing violence on its workers in the state.Shah's visit to Naxalbari comes a day after the deadly attack by Naxals in Sukma in Chattisgarh in which 25 CRPF men were killed.West Bengal is among the five states where he will spend three-days each as he looks to strengthen the party in the states where it has been traditionally weak, with an eye on the next Lok Sabha polls. Odisha, Telangana, Tamil Nadu and Kerala are the other states that will be covered by Shah.""The Naxals had started their violent activities here at Naxalbari and now, development and progress will start from here,"" Shah said at a meeting of BJP workers at Naxalbari in Siliguri in north Bengal. ""Under Narendra Modi's leadership, Bengal will very soon be on the path of development.""The BJP chief had lunch at the house of a tribal family before interacting with party workers.Sitting on the floor of Raju Mahali's house at Dakkhin Katiajote village in Naxalbari, he had a meal of rice, moong dal, 'potol' (a kind of gourd) fry, squash curry, salad and papad, served on a banana leaf.Shah said he would tour five states in 15 days.""TMC may think they can stop Modiji's chariot, but they cannot stop it.

As demand for pulses and groundnuts is always high, farmers (share croppers in particular) decided to take up cultivation of the crops despite the fact the Government did not offer subsidy on seeds.Moong was sown in 42,116 hectares (ha) and the Agriculture department had set a target to procure 2.50 lakh quintals through NAFED, MARKFED and Odisha State Cooperative Marketing Federation Ltd by April first week.For Moong, the Centre has fixed a minimum support price (MSP) of Rs 5,225 per quintal, including Rs 425 as bonus. For groundnut, MSP is Rs 4,220 per quintal, including Rs 100 as bonus and MSP for black gram is Rs 5,000 per quintal, including Rs 425 as bonus.As per the Central Governments suggestion, the State Government has directed all district agriculture officers to fix target for procurement of pulses and groundnuts in the State. Accordingly, agriculture officials of the district sent the procurement target report to the State Government.However, a month has passed but procurement is yet to begin. As a result, Moong farmers are being forced to sell their produce at Rs 3,000 to Rs 3,500 per quintal and similar is the plight of farmers who cultivated groundnuts and black grams. Activists of Naba Nirman Krushak Sangthan have submitted a memorandum to the local administration demanding immediate procurement. They also demanded opening of two procurement centres in each block so that farmers can easily sell their produce.Assistant District Agriculture Officer Nilamani Dash said as per the proposal, the Agriculture department had decided to procure only Moong for the time being. So far, three procurement centres have been opened in Jagatsinghpur, Raghunathpur and Balikuda and procurement of Moong would begin from next week."

593ae0527be9e009ad91b93a,"Motion pictures, limited",http://www.newindianexpress.com/sport/other/2017/may/28/motion-pictures-limited-1609899.html,2017-05-28,"CHIBA, Chiba Prefecture, Japan. Its April 1991 and the city is getting ready to host the World Table Tennis Championships. It is also gearing up for one of the most significant developments in a post-Cold War world. A unified sports team from Korea  a first since the Peninsula was divided after the second World War  is registered.The move is to generate goodwill amid an air of increasing hostility between the two nations.It works. The side generates a massive amount of eustress. That wave reaches a crescendo when the womens team, led by Ri Bun-Hui (North Korea) and Hyun Jung-Hwa (South Korea), beats China to gold. What had happened at the 1990 Asian Games adds to the occasion. Jung-Hwa beat Bun-Hui, but ended up losing to Deng Yaping in the womens event. Six months later, two foes become friends to get the better of China and Yaping.It has everything a director wants in a sports biopic  national pride, historical significance, geopolitical tension and enough drama to shoot nine seasons worth of Emmy-award winning episodes. So, in 2012, Ko-ri-a, hits the screens. Even before the film begins, the masses are on the edge, whistling and crying. The entire peninsula is sketched inside one of the alphabets as the title is displayed. It doesnt have the international border.The title fades and the biopic begins. Where hopes and dreams marry reality, even if its mixed with a generous dollop of fiction.***Right around the same time as As One (Ko-ri-a) premiered, there was a small but intangible change taking place in the corridors of Bollywood. Producers and directors began backing sports biopics. The smartly packaged Paan Singh Tomar (PST), the real-life story of an armyman who represented the country at the Asian Games in 1958 before becoming a rebel, in March 2012, meant there was a realignment of how the money men perceived stories of sportspersons, alive or dead. Lagaan, Iqbal and Chak De! India  all made in the first 10 years of this century  did prove viewers were willing to watch sports films, either fictitious or inspired by real events. But it wasnt until PST that the mentality changed.Ad film director Prahlad Kakkar agrees. See, you have to understand how the industry works, he tells Express. Nothing succeeds like success. Our film industry is reactive, not original. When romantic films were made, everyone made them. When action films were made, everyone started doing the same. But after the successes of PST and Bhaag Milkha Bhaag, there was a whole genre that was waiting to be tapped. And that is what you have seen over the last 18 months and will see in the months to come.That is true. There are films on Saina Nehwal, PV Sindhu, Pullela Gopichand and Dhyan Chand lined up as well as one on Mariyappan Thangavelu.Given that watching sports and going to the cinema are two of the most tribalistic pastimes, does he find it strange that its taken this much time for the industry to bring this category of film-making into the mainstream? It also depends on the story, he says. Dangal was a world hit because of how it was portrayed. The actual story segued superbly into the writing so much that there wasnt a need for willing suspension of disbelief. Or any outrageous scenes of jingoism. There is always a market for good stories provided the accuracy is maintained.Even so, facts were tweaked to bollywoodise Dangal; a familiar trope among film-makers around the world. But Babita Kumari, who won a gold at the 2014 Commonwealth Games, understands why the makers resorted to it. There was masala also, which I cant criticise because films need to do well at the box office, she says. It helped me reach out to the audience outside the Hindi-speaking wrestling belts. People who cheered for us at international events did not know about our parents and the roles they played in bringing us up.That is a powerful tool for film-makers. Everyone knows how Sindhu, Saina et al became Olympic medallists. But the medium of cinema is such that it gives the fan a behind-the-scenes look at what went into making them sporting heroes in a land that is devoid of them, by and large. A sports biopic also saves the producers a lot of money with respect to marketing and publicity, Kakkar opines. You just need to mention the word Saina or a Sindhu and the publicity takes care of itself.Sometimes that may be a detriment as well. Expectations are already set in stone and the protagonists themselves may not like to be a part of the film. L Ibomcha Singh, Mary Koms coach, was one of those dissenting voices. I am a coach and I did not want to be part of the movie (Mary Kom), he says. Movie is fantasy. So I refused to play any role. Even some Manipuri movie-makers tried to persuade me but I rejected their offer. However, he did share footage of training sessions with the stakeholders.***Sachin: A Billion Dreams, a documentary-drama that released over the weekend, is the latest in a spate of sports personality-based films to hit theatres. This, though, fails to strike a chord with people who grew up with Tendulkar. There are enough previously unseen footage to keep viewers interested, but it doesnt pull at the heartstrings like when he came out to bat. Its a movie made for the Instagram generation, not for the tape-recorder ones. However, one line in the movie  a part of his farewell speech at the Wankhede  is one of the reasons why sports biopics are being made in abundance these days. Ajit, he says, my brother, now what do I talk about him? We have lived this dream together.That is the essence. This genre allows people to not only dream, but live fantasies through prism of their heroes.In the pipelineSaina NehwalTo be titled Saina, biopic on first Indian shuttler to win Olympic medal will star Shraddha Kapoor.

According to the Union Home Ministry, over 15,000 people, including more than 3,000 security personnel, have been killed in the naxal violence in the last 35 years.Long violence has caused irreparable damage to the tribal economy. The tribals make exotic handicrafts, do agriculture, collect hundreds of minor forest products, weave exotic fabrics and do fishing activities. They make utility items from biodegradable materials available in the forest. Over the years, those utility pieces have become art objects with high value addition.Dhokra craft, iron craft, tribal jewellery, wood craft, ragged dolls and bead work etc have demand in domestic and global craft bazaars. The tribal have the skill to make hundreds of utility items from grass, tree leaves, cane and organic fibres. A deeper understanding of the tribal culture and its economy will not only reduce the red menace but make forestry a vibrant economic sector.Tribal living in forest fringed villages collect honey, medicinal plants, bamboo, timber, ivory, fruits, other minor forest products and grow organic food grains. As per the Agriculture Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (Apeda), the country has exported 38,177.08 MT of natural honey worth Rs 705.87 crore in 2015-16. The domestic demand for pure honey is very high due to its various medicinal, nutritional and religious value. Malkangiri tribal of Odisha collect organic tamarind, grow black gram and green gram but sell it to traders and middlemen at a far lower price.Similarly, the tribal of Mayurbhanj district of the state make ropes from Sabai grass, a natural fibre which grows abundantly in the district. The rope is used for various purposes including furniture making. The Rs 400 crore rope trade is controlled by the outside traders. Here a tribal rope maker hardly earns Rs 150 per day.The tribal also make Khalipata (saal leaf plate), grow special kind of organic Tandula (tur dal), collect bamboo and other minor forest products from the forest. Traders and middlemen buy their products at throw away price and sell it at high price. The Dhokra craft of Mayurbhanj is very popular in international craft bazaars for its artistry. As the tribal artisans do not get the profit they deserve they lose interest and skill.Chhattisgarh tribals sing, dance and make exotic handicrafts. The Gaur and Ahirai folk dancers and singers of Chhattisgarh give their performance in foreign countries. Teejan Bai, the noted Pandbani singer and Padma Shri award winner of Chhattisgarh has performed in many countries. Tribal artisans of Bastaar make export quality wood craft, iron craft and dhokra craft which are very popular in handicraft markets. The Jhabua tribal make dolls from rags which are of export quality. Forest always gives them inspiration and raw material.A unique study  Green Accounting for Indian states and Union Territories Project  for the first time estimated the value of our forest at Rs 88,60,259 crore as on 2003. The study reveals the economic values of nutrient loss: nitrogen, phosphorous, potassium and organic matter in the country was Rs 5,024 crore. The decrease in state of timber alone in two years between 2001 and 2003 makes for a wealth depletion of Rs 38,000 crore. There has been no survey to assess the huge loss between 2003 and 2016.Sustainable developmentSustainable forest management could become a means of creating millions of green jobs, thus helping to reduce poverty and improve the environment, said Jan Heino, Assistant Director General of Food and Agriculture Organiations Forestry Department. Indias 89 national parks, 504 wildlife sanctuaries, 14 biospheres and 25 wetlands should be micro managed for sustainable development.Elinor Ostrom, US political scientist who was awarded the 2009 Nobel Memorial Prize in economic governance, said: monitoring of local users holds the key to improve forest conditions. When local users have long-term rights to harvest from the forest, they are more likely to monitor and sanction those who break the rules and better forest conditions.The value of international trade in forest products has increased by almost 50% in the last decade. Here, the government has to make the tribal capable of managing their forest.Foreign tourists happily spend Rs 1 lakh to Rs 2 lakh each to sight wild animals in natural environment. One horned rhino, Asiatic lion, migratory birds, crocodiles, royal Bengal tiger, black buck, lion tailed macaque, snow leopard, Nilgiri tahr, reptiles and a wide range of flora and fauna always attract tourists.Besides wildlife tourism, the tribal sports talent can also be tapped. The worlds best hockey full back Dileep Tirkey, Olympian Michel Kindo, dozens of hockey stars, Dutee Chand, the 100 m national champion sprinter who missed the Rio Olympic qualifying score by 0.01 seconds, Mary Kom, the six-time world amateur boxing champion and the legendary footballer Baichung Bhutia are tribals.The government should evolve a tribal-specific development policy and improve governance which will create sustainable employment opportunities in forestry sector."

Writing off their crop loan will provide more relief than increasing the MSP for paddy. The State Government should accept the BJP demand and announce loan waiver of the farmers, State BJP spokesperson Sajjan Sharma said.Holding the State Government responsible for the plight of farmers who are not getting support price for many of their agricultural produces, Sharma said the Government did not come to the rescue of farmers when there was distress sale of moong. The State announced to procure moong from farmers at `5,250 per quintal but it failed to keep its commitment. The famers had no option but to dispose of their produce at `3,370 per quintal in the open market, he said.Why is the State Government demanding higher MSP for a single item (paddy), when it failed to ensure the same for other agricultural items announced by the Centre, he wondered."

The additional cost involved for production of certified seeds is more that `500 per quintal. But the State Government has fixed procurement price for certified seeds at `1,837 per quintal, said Ashok Baral, farmers representative in OSSC Board.While the State Government is asking the Centre to revise MSP for paddy from `1,550 to `2,930 per quintal, the procurement price for certified should also be revised to the same level, he said.The Odisha Assembly had unanimously passed a resolution to increase the paddy MSP to `2930 per quintal. The farmers representatives further drew the attention of Agriculture Minister to the apathy of the department in utilisation of fund received from the Centre under Bringing Green Revolution to Eastern India (BGREI) programme.The Ministry of Agriculture had provided financial assistance of ` 6.16 crore to the State Government to provide incentives to farmers for production of high yield/hybrid seeds in 2015 kharif season. However, about `2 crore of the Central assistance has remained unspent till date, they informed Rout.The delegation informed the Minister that farmers, who had supplied certified paddy seeds to OSSC in January, are yet to receive their payment. They requested Rout to direct the managing director of the corporation to release their dues without delay.Alleging that the seeds corporation is dilly dallying for procurement of certified moong and biri seeds from the farmers, the delegation requested the Minister to take steps for immediate procurement of seed stocks from the farmers."

The corporation is reported to have sold 2.4 lakh quintals of seeds under DBT.With no more demand for seeds, the OSSC is now in a fix how to dispose of the balance stock. The all-in-cost price of certified paddy seeds has been fixed at Rs 2,597 per quintal. The farmers will get a subsidy of Rs 997 per quintal.Under the DBT scheme, farmers have to pay the actual cost of seeds upfront. The subsidy amount will be transferred to the farmers accounts subsequently.Prior to the DBT scheme, the farmers were buying seeds at subsidised rates. As they have to pay the full cost now, farmers facing cash crunch do not wish to buy their entire requirement of seeds from the corporation. Either they use the paddy stock of their own as seed or go for the cheaper varieties available in the market, sources in OSSC said.The low off-take seeds from the corporation which supplied the farm input through Primary Agriculture Cooperative Societies (PACS) will have a negative impact on the seed replacement rate (SRR) targeted by the State Government, sources added.The SRR in case of paddy has reached nearly 35 per cent prior to the implementation of DBT in 2005-16. It was less than 25 per cent during kharif 2016. We apprehend that the SRR will be below 20 per cent this year, said an officer of Agriculture department.The DBT proved to be a dampener during 2017 Rabi season when farmers purchased only 2000 quintals of certified groundnut seeds from the corporation against its target to sell 30,000 quintals. The corporation was selling more than one lakh quintals of groundnut seeds before the implementation of DBT.

5a0f0ba39855b76bf13d5760,‘Onion shortage for 15 more days’,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170812/jsp/odisha/story_166872.jsp,2017-08-12,"Caption There is a hue and cry over shortage of onions in the market. What is your department doing to address the issue? The states requirement of onion per annum is 5.5 lakh tonnes. We produce onion in only four districts  Nuapada, Balangir, Kalahandi and a part of Nabarangpur. We also produce some onion at Puruna Cuttack, which is located between Boudh and Phulbani. Despite all our efforts, the production of onion remains 1.5 lakh tonne per annum. We cannot preserve it for a long time. We have already exhausted our stock. To meet the shortfall of 4.5 lakh tonnes, we have to depend on Nashik in Maharashtra, Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh and also on Madhya Pradesh. But the damage to crops following floods in Maharashtra, onion produced in the interior parts of the state could not come. To check farmer suicides, the Maharashtra government started procuring onion at a higher price. So, only a few options are left for our traders to procure onion at a lower and competitive price. Sometimes our traders have had to buy onion at Rs 24 to Rs 26 a kg. I asked the traders and my department officials to sell onion with a profit margin of just Re 1, which will meet the transportation and preservation costs. How long will the shortage persist? It may take another 15 days. One cant store onion, as it is a perishable commodity. So there can be no hoarding. I have already sent a message to everybody that the government would take strong action if they do any mischief. Now, the businessmen have started cooperating with the department. Is it not an irony that despite the fact that we do not produce sufficient onion, our farmers had to resort to distress sale? Yes, there was distress sale. This was due to the fact that onion from neighbouring Madhya Pradesh where it was selling for Rs 2 per kg flooded our markets. The traders from Madhya Pradesh also asked our farmers to sell the onion at that price. However, we intervened and brought the onion price to Rs 7 per kg. But we cannot preserve it for long. Why dont you implement the Market Intervention System to rescue farmers? For market intervention, there has to be a consensus between the Centre and the state government as the price will be shared in the ratio of 50:50. We have already announced MIS for mung and biri dal. Two days ago, I told the officials that groundnut should be purchased at Rs 42.20 per kg. In the case of onion, they did not agree. Onion cultivation is not confined to Odisha but spread over many states. The governments failure to build a chain of cold storage may be one of the factors that has led to the distress sale... That is a wrong notion. We have nearly 42 cold stores in the private sector across the state. Besides, we have nearly seven cold stores around the capital city. A number of cold storages are there in Berhampur, my hometown. We have 24 cold stores in a bad condition. When the proposal came to me for their repair, I strongly suggested that these units be privatised. Let the private party undertake repairs and do business. The business cannot be run by the government. Every year, we face distress sale of various agricultural produce. How can this problem be solved? Everything is related to demand and supply. If suddenly there is excess supply, the prices will plummet and it becomes difficult to arrest it. Thats the time the government needs to intervene. We are doing so now. In the case of paddy, we have decided whatever the quantity of rice produced in our state, we will procure it from the farmers. Last year, we procured 56 lakh metric tonnes of rice. I have asked the primary agriculture societies to purchase paddy from the sharecroppers. What will you do with so much of surplus rice? Under the food security programme, we are giving 5 kg of rice per head. We will use up 30 lakh metric tonnes of rice under the programme. The rest of the rice will be procured by the Food Corporation of India. We also export rice to Punjab, Haryana, Jharkhand, Bihar and Karnataka. We are the third largest producer of rice in the country. You are part of a ministerial committee that discussed the issue of sharecroppers being given certain rights vis-a-vis the landowners. When will committees report be ready? Nearly 90 per cent landowners give their land to sharecroppers for farming. There is a fear among landowners that if they declare that they are leasing out land for cultivation purpose, their land will be taken away. Keeping this concern in mind, we are now emphasising on real cultivators. But as the issue is a controversial one, we have to secure the interest of the sharecroppers as well as farmers. It will take some more time to resolve the issue. You have staged a came back to the ministry. Earlier, a section of leaders from Ganjam claimed that they had lobbied for your inclusion in the government. Its the prerogative of the chief minister to pick up people for inclusion in the ministry. He also decides who he will use for party work and other purposes. When I was not in the ministry, he had used my services extensively in west Odisha and other parts of the state for the partys work. I never felt for a moment that I was out of favour with Naveen babu. Later, he brought me back to the ministry. Lobbying does not work. BJP national president Amit Shah launched his party programme Mo Booth Sabuthu Majboot (My booth is the strongest) from Ganjam. Your party must have been worried. BJP is a national party and it has formed the government at the Centre. The party has also formed governments in a number of states. Now, they are facing anti-incumbency in Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and other states. They have already lost Punjab and managed to form government in Goa. They are in alliance in Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and some other parts of the country. They are making efforts to enter newer areas. Now, they have set eyes on Odisha, Bengal and some other states. They are making all-out efforts to strengthen their organisational base. But, they will not be successful in Odisha as long as Naveen babu is here. But the anti-establishment factor also works against the BJD. No. We are taking up need-based programmes for development of the people. Naveens image is imprinted in the minds of people. Earlier, you equated Naveen babu as lord Krishna who drives the chariot (state) and Pyari Mohan Mohapatra as Arjun, who shoots the arrows. After Pyari Mohan, who is the Arjun now in the party? After the Mahabharat war was over all the Pandavas started claiming that they had defeated the Kauravas. But one Belalasena said he had seen only a wheel chopping off heads. Similarly, here Naveen babu is Krishna and there is no need for Arjuna as this war is different from the Mahabharat battle. What is the major challenge for the party in 2019? The Congress is almost a spent force. The space vacated by it is now being filled up by the BJP. Many Congress leaders are joining the BJP in the hope of getting a ticket. They are also spreading their network. Despite BJP emerging as a challenge, they will be no match for Naveen babus image and our programmes for the people. What do you consider more important: loyalty to the party leader (Naveen Patnaik) or efficiency at work? Both loyalty and hard work are required to be successful."

This was informed by Vice-Chancellor (VC) of the agriculture university, SN Pasupalak on Thursday.Addressing a gathering on the occasion of 56th Foundation Day of the institution, the VC said NRSC will provide farmers under OUAT exact information on farm land status and water availability besides, conducive weather condition to help them plan agriculture works and water resource management.This apart, the Centre would train young scientists from different disciplines of the university for follow up satellite data for integrated use of geospatial tools with crop models and in-situ observation network for timely crop production forecast, drought assessment and monitoring.Addressing the gathering, Governor and Chancellor of Universities SC Jamir said, agriculture has largely been seen as a development sector, for managing poverty, not for creating wealth. For agriculture to move away from being seen as just a billion mouths to feed, it must start modernising agriculture, from farm to the table and with supporting agro-industrial development, he said. Jamir also inaugurated a rooftop solar plant of 815 kw and a water harvesting system on the OUAT premises.Agriculture Minister Damodar Rout stressed upon using indigenous seed varieties and technologies for development of a sustainable agriculture system.Pasupalak informed that OUAT will soon set up Atal Incubation Centre to foster budding agri-entrepreneurs in the field of agriculture and allied areas and steps have also been initiated to establish community radio stations in each of the 31 Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVKs) of OUAT to disseminate real time information within 1,015 km radius. Besides, efforts are on to develop cold and weed resistance pulse varieties and the State Government has sanctioned `2.25 crore for research in this regard. Under the project, five different pulses including green gram, red lentil, black gram, peas and fava beans will be cultivated in farms after paddy harvesting is completed. The university has also decided to increase number of pulse seed hubs from seven to 11 districts.On the occasion, the KVK at Gajapati was awarded as the best KVK and Laxmipriya Pradhan of KVK-Keonjhar was felicitated as the best extension scientist."

""Malnutrition rate is high among kids and health status of women in our state is also poor. We have selected seven districts that are most affected where we would promote cultivation of nutrition-rich crop varieties such as green crops, pulses, millets, leafy vegetables and so on,"" said vice-chancellor Surendra Nath Pasupalak told The Telegraph on the sidelines of the OUAT foundation day event. The seven districts identified are Boudh, Kandhamal, Koraput, Rayagada, Gajapati, Nuapada and Jajpur. The varsity has partnered with voluntary organisations, which will monitor the improvement in health indicators after one year. According to sources, 34 per cent of the total children below five years age in the state are underweight. The varsity has also decided to expand its research across the state. The research will be done in districts to provide quality seeds of pulses, paddy, maize and wheat to the farmers. ""The aim is to double the farmers' income in the state by 2022,"" said Pasupalak. The varsity is working on developing cold and weed resistance pulse varieties. Under the project, five varieties, including green gram, red lentil, black gram, peas and fava beans, will be cultivated in farms after paddy harvest is done. ""By doing the dual crop of both paddy and pulses, the farmers' income will be increased substantially,"" he said. The government has sanctioned Rs 2.25 crore for research on developing new varieties of pulses. The OUAT has decided to increase the number of pulse seed hubs from seven to 11 districts where the varsity will provide technological inputs and support to the farmers to grow quality pulses seeds. The varsity will buy these seeds to distribute among farmers. ""We are also working on developing a high-yield variety of aromatic rice with the use of genomics,"" he said."

Being from Odisha, my speciality naturally became Odiya cuisine. But I prefer to call myself an Indian chef because I can cook specialities across the country. I acquired my culinary education from IHM, Chennai and started my career at The Residency, Karur. Later, I worked at Accord, Puducherry and now I am at the Paprika cafe in The Courtyard by Marriot, Teynampet.I have been an Oriya speciality chef in all of these establishments. Although I make specialities from across the country, like dal makhni, rogan josh and Awadhi biriyani, I personally prefer Oriya dalma as comfort food. It is made from yellow moong dal and a melange of vegetables. I also like kakhara poi ghanto which is made from plenty of vegetables like pumpkin, spinach, raw papaya, drumstick and potatoes. Maccha besara which is made from fish and other vegetables is also my favourite.Odiya cuisine also features some unique desserts such as chenna pudo, which is a cottage cheese-based dessert sweetened with sugar syrup. Then we have goja which is maida and sugar syrup based dessert. Khassa laddu, which is black sesame seed with jaggery is served after special ceremonies in Odisha. I am against food wastage. Therefore, we cook according to the reservation. Its better to make more if necessary than to end up with excess food.Since we are a business class hotel, the guests tend to stay longer. This gives me the opportunity to build a cordial relationship with them and I try my best to go out of my way to fulfil their requests. If anybody is tired of North Indian cuisine, I make South Indian food for them. I also take custom requests on how they want their food prepared. Recently, a US navy team stayed with us and before they left, they specially asked to meet me. I was hugged and appreciated by all of them for the food and experience we provided them. This is why I love my profession.

5a11510b9855b76bf13df5af,'Fund must for education',https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170909/jsp/odisha/story_171791.jsp,2017-09-09,"The state's eminent academics and the chancellor (governor) have time and again raised concern over the standard of education in Odisha. How do you think Odisha University of Agriculture and Technology (OUAT) is faring? The higher education system entirely depends on the school education system. If you have a good school education system, then we are good. But that is lacking. We are fortunate that we get students through the examination system, which stresses on career. Our students have done well in the Junior Research Fellowship. Now, we stand eighth among all state agriculture universities in the country. Our position is 11th if we include deemed universities Being a premier university in agriculture, has OUAT been successful in transferring the technology from laboratories to land? We have 31 Krishi Vigyan Kendras that play the role of a catalyst in transferring the technology to the field across the state. We signed an MOU with the National Remote Sensing Centre, Hyderabad, to use satellite data for real-time agricultural monitoring. It will help farmers plan by providing exact information on land and water availability. Besides, it can give accurate weather forecast. The centre will train young scientists from various disciplines in the use of satellite data for agriculture along with drought assessment and monitoring. We have also inked an MoU with Philippines-based International Rice Research Institute for production of high nutritional paddy seed in the state. We have developed stress-tolerant rice varieties that are performing exceptionally well under the adverse effects of climate change such as flooding, drought and salinity. We have signed MoUs with five institutions of international repute like the International Livestock Research Institute for production of feed and fodder. It will look into the issue of fodder supply and demand, improve feeding practices and building capacity of key players. Are there any more MoUs in the pipeline? We have initiated efforts for an agreement with the Software Technology Parks of India to introduce IT-enabled agriculture. It will provide an opportunity to farmers to get smart agriculture services. It will give ample scope to farmers to adopt best practices to get maximum yield with minimum manpower and less investment. We are focusing on giving market linkage through agri enterpreneuership. But what has been the contribution of OUAT to the state so far? It's the only agriculture university that deals with a wide range of subjects. It has made quite an intervention in the livelihood of the common man. We have produced more than 151 varieties of crops, including different varieties of paddy such as Lalat, Khandagiri, Parijata, Konark and Surendra. Because of this, we have become a surplus state in rice production. What are the projects that university is undertaking at this moment? We are focusing on developing cold and weed resistant pulse varieties. Under the project, five pulses such as green gram, red lentil, black gram, peas and fava beans will be cultivated in farms after paddy harvest. We have been successful in our interventions in maize, ginger, chilli, sunflower and mustard. The students are now being provided with training about hybrid maize production, rose, honey, mushroom cultivation and packaging and marketing, milk and fish cultivation. Are you satisfied with OUAT's research and development compared to other universities? One should not indulge in comparisons. The research activities undertaken at OUAT are marvellous compared to the money we have invested in them. We didn't have any contingency to undertake critical research work. Now, the state government increased our budgetary provision by 35 per cent after we raised the issue. We also have nearly 96 vacancies in the faculties despite the posts being sanctioned a decade ago. The workload has increased and many new research fields are opening up and we will certainly go ahead in the coming days. The OUAT has nearly 5,500 students. Do you have any plans to set up a second campus? We have not thought about a second campus. We have our 11 constituent colleges across the state in agriculture, engineering and horticulture. But we are acquiring space to improve the existing infrastructure here. The chief minister recently laid the foundation stone of various infrastructure projects, including new classrooms and examination hall of the college of forestry. He also visited the organic mushroom centre and the students' maize research fields and interacted with them on how the outcome of the research could be utilised by the farmers. The Assembly passed the OUAT Amendment Bill in 2013 to accord affiliation to private institutions for imparting education in agriculture. How many private institutions have applied for affiliation? Not a single one. Do you think we should encourage private institutions? In the changing world scenario, huge investment and infrastructure is required for the improvement of education. The government cannot do it alone. At the same time, the government has the mechanism to control and regulate faculty members to ensure that the quality of education is not compromised. In the 2012 annual budget, the Centre had announced Rs 50 crore to OUAT. Did you receive all the funds? So far, we have received only Rs 12 crore. However, I will not comment on the past. We have an agriculture university as well as a Central Rice Research Institute (Cuttack) in the state. But why has there not been a green revolution in Odisha like Punjab? To make significant progress in agriculture, we should have three basic things - enough irrigation, adequate fertilisers and assured supply of power. Besides, we also need funds. After Independence, Punjab got huge funds from the Centre. They have all the three things mentioned above. Agriculture in Odisha is a victim of natural hazards. But things have started taking off. After the second green revolution, we have surpassed many in the field of rice production and in some other sectors. The vice-chancellor of Ravenshaw University has stirred up a controversy by pointing fingers at unnecessary political interventions in university administration. What about you? Not at all. We had no election last time and there are no elections this time as well as the students are busy building their careers. With no elections, our atmosphere is peaceful. Yesterday you had been invited to share your thoughts on the Mahanadi river dispute. How serious is the problem? I am raising the issue as an agro-meteorologist and not as an Odia - man has exclusive right over water. For the cause of industrial growth of one state, one cannot give up water, which is crucial to the livelihood of lakhs of people. If the flow of water in the Mahanadi is checked, the surface water level in various parts of the state will go down and it will have a serious impact on the ecosystem and livelihood of people as well as the climate. You are closely associated with the farming sector. Experts are of the view that the government's Re 1 per kg rice scheme has made people lethargic and it its difficult to find labourers for agricultural activities. In a welfare state, the basic duty of the government is to adopt a food security policy for its citizens and to ensure that there is no starvation death. From that point of view, the government has done the right thing. That people are becoming lethargic is a social issue. What would you have been had you not been a teacher? Since my childhood I had thought of becoming a teacher. It's my dream that has been fulfilled with God's grace."
5a1482f39855b76bf13e50e6,Secrets out: caste and polarisation,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170921/jsp/nation/story_174283.jsp,2017-09-21,"Chandan Mitra New Delhi, Sept. 20: Former BJP MP and national executive member Chandan Mitra has described his party's quest to expand in the east, particularly in Bengal, as a ""humungous task"" - casting doubts on chief Amit Shah's dream of capturing power from panchayat to Parliament and crediting the party's recent wins to caste and religion. Mitra, sidelined in the current dispensation, has described Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee and Odisha's Naveen Patnaik as ""powerful regional leaders"" and said the BJP had its ""task cut out"" in the two crucial eastern states. The comments appeared in an article on the edit page of the newspaper Hindustan Times today. ""As it forays east in its quest to make India Opposition-free, the BJP faces formidable obstacles in two states - Bengal and Odisha. Of course it (the BJP) has not broken into some southern states either, but the challenge is bigger in the east on account of powerful regional leaders like Mamata Banerjee and Naveen Patnaik, whose popularity shows no signs of waning dramatically even if fraying at the edges,"" Mitra says in the article. Mitra, editor of The Pioneer newspaper, explains why he thinks it would be a ""humungous task"". The BJP's ""caste-based winning formula"" for north India will not work in the east, he says, because caste is not a decisive electoral factor in this region. Mitra appears to suggest that the Uttar Pradesh elections this year were won on caste. In Bengal the party has a ""huge disadvantage"" because Muslims account for 27 per cent to 31 per cent of the population and appear firmly behind Mamata, he argues. ""Her excessive appeasement of the minorities may periodically antagonise urban Hindus, but that does not seem enough to galvanise the majority community fully behind the BJP.... Thus the battle to gain acceptance in the Bengali mindset, particularly among the bhadralok, is a humungous task for the BJP.,"" Mitra writes. While the situation might be similar to that in Assam a few years ago, he says, the difference is that in the Northeast state ""communal polarisation increased sharply"" just before and after the 2014 general election, ""enabling"" the BJP to capture power. ""Bengali society has resisted communal polarisation so far,"" he stresses. Party leaders refused to officially react to Mitra's comments but, off the record, said the former Rajya Sabha MP could be venting his displeasure with the current regime. They said Mitra should have refrained from commenting in the way he has done at a time party boss Shah was working on how to capture power in the two eastern states. At the party's Bhubaneswar national executive earlier this year, Shah had given a call to ensure that the lotus bloomed from panchayatto Parliament. Mitra has cited the example of the 2014 Lok Sabha elections to show how Mamata and her Odisha counterpart, Naveen, withstood the Narendra Modi wave to buttress his argument that the two chief ministers were formidable leaders. ""In the barely 18 months that remain for the 2019 Lok Sabha election (in Odisha, Assembly polls will be held simultaneously), the BJP has its task cut out. But it is not an easy one,"" he says. He feels the BJP ""requires a credible leadership and a popular face, acceptable to the bhadralok in particular"". That is something, he says, the BJP ""would have to accomplish in the little time left before the next round of polls"". Mitra concludes by saying that the ""conquest"" of Bengal was ""crucial to the BJP's ambition to decisively win the 2019 Lok Sabha election""."

Telegraph picture Many Jamshedpureans are cycling for fun or leisure if the swelling register of the city's first group for cyclists formed by Tata Steel management trainees, Steel Cyclos, is any indication. From 40 on August 31, when Steel Cyclos had been launched in the presence of Everesters Bachendri Pal and Premlata Agarwal, the number of members has now risen to 147. ""We think membership will cross 250-plus by this year-end. There are a fair number of women, too,"" enthused Ashish Chaudhary, a manager in Tata Steel and one of the club's core committee members. And, it's not empty numbers either, Chaudhary stressed. ""Our members meet mostly on Sundays. We pedal to many destinations near the steel city, including Jadugora, Gamharia, Dimna, and even Tiring on the Odisha border, some 45km from Jamshedpur. The club started with mostly Tata Steel employees but non-company residents have also shown great interest to join us as it gives them an opportunity to socialise differently, exercise, and most importantly, reduce carbon footprint and go green,"" he said. Senior manager at Tata Steel Adventure Foundation (TSAF) Hemant Gupta, who turned an Everester earlier this year, said he was delighted that something like this was finally happening in the steel city. ""I am an active member of the club's core team and so I'm really happy to see membership grow in leaps and bounds in such a short span,"" Gupta said. ""It proves that many people are keen to be fit, enjoy the outdoors and making new friends and want to reduce air pollution,"" he added. In November, club members are heading to Tumung, a rocky area some 25km from Jamshedpur, with a special cause, Chaudhary said. ""We'll visit a primary school in Tumung to spread awareness on education among school children there. We'll also distribute stationery items like copies, pencils and erasers among them."" Steel Cyclos has a Facebook page for enrolling names. Aspiring members can also visit the TSAF office at the JRD sports complex in Jamshedpur. There no membership fee. ""As they say, the best things in life are free,"" laughed Harjit Singh, an employee of a private firm and a Mango resident who joined Steel Cyclos last week. ""I liked the concept of this club and will ask my friends to join too,"" he added. Adityapur businessman Sumeet Pandey said he loved cycling as a leisure activity. ""But joining a group certainly makes it more exciting,"" smiled the new member. Share your experiences on a group trip with Steel Cyclos with ttkhand@abpmail.com"

However, payment has been delayed citing funds crunch though the State Government has created a corpus fund of `100 crore to help out the farmers. Farmers in many parts of the State are waiting to get their dues for the last seven months.Sources, however, maintained that OSSC has withdrawn only ` 60 crore so far from the fund. Though the State Government stood guarantee for `40 crore loan, OSSC authorities have so far not taken the loan. This has led to fund crunch in the corporation resulting in unnecessary delay in payment of dues to the farmers.Farmers alleged that they are supposed to get the first instalment of the dues while supplying the seeds and the rest within one month of the seeds clearing the testing process. Delay in receiving the payment has hampered their preparation for the rabi crop, they added.Meanwhile, though the State Government had asked district Collectors to submit reports on crop loss due to untimely rains in the second week of November, it is yet to receive reports from all the districts. The Government had announced that farmers will be paid compensation within seven days of receiving the reports."
