""This is a major breakthrough in the field of rice research. Generally rice varieties have around 7% protein,"" said Nayak.He said the variety is awaiting approval of the Central Variety Releasing Committee, the apex body of releasing varieties in India. ""Once approved, it will be sent for large seed production,"" Nayak said.The new variety has been developed by crossing Assam rice collection - a high protein and low yielding variety with Naveen - a high yielding variety. NRRI has been doing research on the variety for the last 4 to 5 years. The variety will yield at least five tonnes a hectare, he added.Nayak was here to attend the fourth interface meet of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) institutes, State Agriculture University (SAU) and state departments for 2015-16.In the meeting, major concerns of farmers were discussed, including timely supply of quality seeds of potato, onion and pulses. ""Creating of infrastructure for storage, irrigation, processing and value addition and marketing was also discussed,"" said Nayak.This year, NRRI will emphasise on further research in aromatic rice varieties, production of green gram and black gram, which has reduced drastically over the years. ""To tackle the effect of climate change, NRRI has been giving emphasis on integrated farming system but unfortunately various models developed in the laboratories are not transferred to the field,"" he said.The NRRI also suggested the state government to develop miniature farm machinery at affordable prices to easily transfer scientific breakthroughs to field. An exhibition where institutions and organisations showcased their models and technologies for the benefit of farming community was organized on the occasion."

He is on a two-day visit to the state.The minister was here to attend the meeting of Hindi Salahkar Samiti, constituted by the Centre to look after the use of Hindi language in official communications.An official statement, circulated during the news conference, said the Centre has already taken a decision to import 10,000 MT of pulses.The Centre has imposed ban on export of all pulses, except 'kabuli chana', organic pulses and lentils, up to 10,000 MT. Zero import duty on pulses has been extended up to September 2016, the statement said. It said despite two years of less rain, there was more than adequate food grain stock available with the government.Besides to check hoarding and black marketing of essential commodities, the Centre has asked all states to impose stock limits for onion and pulses.In Odisha, prices of pulses have gone through the roof in the last few months. While arhar dal is selling at 160 a kg, prices of moong and urad dal have also skyrocketed much to the discomfort of common man, market sources said.State requires about seven lakh MT pulses per annum against its production of only 80,000 to one lakh MT only. Due to shortage in domestic market, pulses are being imported mainly from Myanmar."
58f4c07460de4776e369496f,Costly pulses hit domestic budget,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160419/jsp/odisha/story_80836.jsp,2016-04-19,"POCKET PINCH Cuttack, April 18: Dal is missing from the menu of several households as the prices of pulses have gone up in the past week across the state. Primarily, the high cost of pulses in Maharastra, Chhattisgarh, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka - from where the state procures dal - is responsible for the price hike. Besides, the state government's norms - fixing the limit of stocking pulse - have also added to the consumers' woes. The retail prices of pulses have registered a hike varying from Rs 5 to Rs 15 per kilogram. At present, arhar dal is being sold at Rs 148 to Rs 150 per kg at the retail markets. The rate of chana dal has also gone up to Rs 80 to Rs 82 per kg against the retail price of Rs 73 to Rs 78 last week. There has been no change in the retail price of moong dal, which is being sold at Rs 85 to Rs 90 per kg. But, the prices of biri dal have gone to Rs 145 per kg from Rs 120 and the rate of masoor dal stands at Rs 85 per kg while it was being sold at Rs 75 at the retail markets last week. Harapriya Samal, a working woman from Jhanjirmangala, said: ""Rice is our staple diet, and our meal is incomplete without dal. So, we are now forced to buy dal at such high rates,"" said Samal. Malgodown traders, however, put the blame on bulk procurement by several multi-national companies, who are now procuring pulses from the farmers. The state requires seven lakh metric tonnes of pulses per annum, while only 80,000 tonnes to one lakh metric tonnes are produced here. A Cuttack Chamber of Commerce official said the pulses' prices were expected to rise due to the existing curb on stocking pulses. At present, a trader is only allowed to stock 750 quintals of pulses according to the government norms. ""If the stock limit is raised, then only the prices of pulses can be kept under control at least for a month despite the high procurement rate as there will be adequate stock to meet the requirement,"" said the official. ""Various big companies are now directly procuring essential commodities from farmers, and as the prices of pulses are high at the point of purchase, there has been a gap in the supply which has pushed the prices,"" said Cuttack Chamber of Commerce joint secretary Prafula Chatoi, who said they had submitted a memorandum to the district administration demanding an increase in the stock limit for traders to 5,000 quintals. On the other hand, Cuttack collector Nirmal Chandra Mishra convened an emergency meeting to review the situation here today, and the Malgodown traders were asked to report the wholesale and retail prices on a daily basis. ""There is an adequate stock at Malgodown. We also urge the consumers not to resort to panic buying as the wholesale prices at Malgodown have been stable for the past two to three days,"" said the collector."

""We decided upon it after the state government relaxed norms for visit of tourists to tribal areas recently,"" said Patnaik.Tribal tourism can be a source of income for Juangs and locals. Odisha is home to some 62 different tribes speaking hundreds of tribal languages. ""Foreign tourists always obey guidelines while visiting tribal villages,"" said Sanghamitra Jena, a noted tour operator. The government should build proper roads and guest houses or put up tents near the Juang hills to promote tourism, she said.""The Juangs live on hills and inside the forest. They cannot survive anywhere else. They come down from the hills only once a week to buy salt, kerosene and cooking oil in the weekly haat at the foothills of Chingudipala,"" said sarpanch of Chingudipala Renuka Deuli. They cultivate vegetables, black grams, green grams and paddy over the land, she said.Deuli said Juangs are one of the poorest tribes and are far from development and education.""The geographical distance from the main towns is another deciding factor in their development. Many villages are without proper roads, electricity, drinking water and PHCs,"" added Deuli."

58fed95a7be9e0420db28460, still dear after VAT cut,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160719/jsp/odisha/story_97423.jsp,2016-07-19,"Bhubaneswar, July 18: The price of various varieties of dal have not decreased as expected despite the state government reducing the value-added tax (VAT) on pulses from five to one per cent from July 1. Gram dal has instead become costlier. The price of arhar dal fallen but that of other pulses has not reduced as expected. Arhar dal is now sold in the retail market at Rs 140 a kg, moong dal at Rs 120 a kg and gram dal at Rs 110 a kg. On June 28, when the cabinet had decided to revise VAT on dal, chief secretary Aditya Prasad Padhi said: ""The traders had promised that if the VAT was revised, it would not affect revenue collection and would have a positive impact on the prices that would be passed on to the consumers. We will observe during the next three months the impact of VAT revision on revenue collection and price revision. We will then take the final call."" Federation of All-Odisha Traders' Association general secretary Sudhakar Panda had said that the VAT revision would definitely bring the prices down. However, observing the situation, food supplies secretary P.K. Mohapatra had shot off a letter to all district collectors asking them to conduct market studies on the wholesale and retail prices of dal. ""We are keeping a close watch on the market situation and will recommend action against unscrupulous traders,"" said deputy director, market intelligence, Pravakar Rout. Panda said VAT had been reduced by four per cent and it has had its impact on the dal prices. ""The arhar dal price has fallen from Rs 140 to Rs 130 a kg. The price of moong has also fallen correspondingly."" He, however, conceded that the gram dal price had climbed by Rs 30 a kg. ""We have no control over the price of gram dal because it has been listed under the National Commodity Exchange. The price fluctuates based on speculation,"" he said, adding that they had urged the Centre to de-list gram dal from the National Commodity Exchange. ""But the Centre has not accepted our demand."" Panda, however, hoped that the prices would fall in the coming days, as dal cultivation in Maharashtra, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh had been higher this year because of favourable weather conditions."

An agriculture scientist addresses a meeting in Umerkote.Two Bhubaneswar-based institutes of ICAR (Indian Council of Agricultural Research) plan to adopt at least two villages in Nabarangpur, an effort to promote the growth of micronutrient-rich crops and help tribals arm themselves against malnutrition.Last week, scientists of Bhubaneswars Central Tuber Crop Research Institute and Central Institute for Women in Agriculture visited Sukhigaon and Biriguda villages in Umerkote and Pondripokhana village in Raighar to assess local requirements.CTCRI director Dr Archana Mukherjee, who heads the six-member team, said the intervention by ICAR institutes was prompted by The Indian Expresss District Zero series on poverty and change in the district. The District Zero series was haunting us. When our director general Trilochan Mohapatra asked us to do something for the hunger hotspots, we thought what could be a better place than Nabarangpur to focus on. Our project was conceived last month. Our aim is to bring freedom from hunger and malnutrition, said Mukherjee.CTCRI focuses on research on sweet potato and aroids catering to the needs of the eastern and northeastern regions. CIWA focuses on agricultural technologies and policies with a womens perspective and undertakes studies to understand drudgery and safety-related issues of women farmers.Dr Rajasekhara Rao Korada, principal scientist at CTCRI and coordinator of the project, said they would focus on making nutrition available between January and June before the arrival of monsoon. Between January and June there is little food in a tribal household. At CTCRI we have varieties of sweet potato that could address the beta carotene deficiency and vitamin deficiency in tribal women and children. The sweet potatoes developed by us need very little water and would be suitable for Nabarangpur, he said.The two institutes will also help grow nutrient-rich colacasia and tapioca. These will reduce dependence on potato available in he market. Every day, they can harvest one or two such tubers till June, said Korada.CTCRI, which has also conducted research on pulses, plans to introducing green gram and horse gram that would mature in 90 days. Our objective is to intervene in their dietary practice and improve upon it to enhance its nutritional value. The tribals of Nabarangpur mostly eat dalma, a recipe of boiled pulses and vegetables. We will give them good saplings of papaya, banana and drumstick, which they can use in preparing dalma, said Dr Mukherjee.As per the BPL census of Odisha, over 73.6 per cent people in Nabarangpur live below the poverty line. According to the women and child development department, 3,400 children in the district suffer from malnutrition, 296 of them severely.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

Picture by Badrika Nath Das Cuttack, Sept. 14: A seven-member squad of the civil supplies department today conducted raids on Big Bazaar, Reliance stores and other shopping malls to put a check on the rising prices of pulses. The raid was conducted following complaints that several such malls had been selling different varieties of dal at exorbitant rates. Civil supplies officer Ashok Mohapatra told The Telegraph that it was found that the pulse rates were higher at the malls than in the retail market. Official sources said arhar dal was being sold at a price ranging from Rs 110 to Rs 114 a kg at Big Bazaar while moong dal was being sold for Rs 100 to Rs 105 at the shopping malls. ""There was difference of Rs 4 to Rs 5 of pulses per kg being sold at malls due to the cost of packaging and other charges. We have asked the authorities to ensure that there is no higher variation in the prices as compared to the retail market,"" said Mohapatra. Mohapatra added no violation was detected in the physical maintenance of stocks because the malls are allowed to keep a stock of 2,000 quintals as they come under the wholesale category. A retailer, on the other hand, is only allowed to stock 50 quintal of pulses at his shop or godown, he said. A district administration official said a close watch was also being kept on the retail markets. The stocks at Malgodown, the largest wholesale market, would shortly be verified to ensure that there was no hoarding of the pulses. Sources said there had been a hike in the prices of pulses, especially arhar dal, by at least Rs 10 to Rs 15 in the wholesale price per kg compared to the price last week. Cuttack Chamber of Commerce joint secretary Prafulla Chatoi also admitted the prices of the pulses had come down in the last month, while the markets were now witnessing a reverse trend. ""The wholesale price of arhar was earlier between Rs 9,000 and Rs 9,200 per quintal, which has again gone up to Rs 100 to Rs 102 per kg,"" said Chatoi. Chatoi said the Malgodown traders were now procuring less quantity of pulses due to severe fluctuations in the prices as they had earlier suffered losses."

While wheat price records an all time high in Odisha leading to surge in price of flour, suji and maida, prices of pulses have fallen considerably much to the delight of consumers.Market sources said wheat price has soared from Rs 2,000 per quintal to Rs 2,700 in the last one month whereas dal prices witnessed a downward trend since early December.Tur (Arhar) dal, which was being sold Rs 10,000 to Rs 11,000 per quintal a month ago, is now priced Rs 7,500 to Rs 9,500. While green gram (moong dal) priced Rs 8,000 per quintal is now sold Rs 6,000, Bengal gram is priced Rs 13,000 instead of Rs 12,000. Similarly, red lentil is sold at Rs 6,000 per quintal against its earlier price of Rs 8,000 and black gram is priced Rs 8,500 to Rs 9,500 instead of Rs 12,000.The price of pulses is likely to fall further. General secretary of Federation of All Odisha Traders' Associations (FAOTA) Sudhakar Panda said the price of arhar would slide down to Rs 6,500, moong Rs 5,000 and black gram Rs 7,000 in January.While the country has a requirement of 2.2 crore tonnes of dal, this time pulses production is expected to touch 2.3 crore tonnes. Plus, 40 to 50 lakh tonnes of pulses will be imported.In wheat, the situation has been worsened by stocks with FCI which is yet to start open sale. This was largely a result of last years crop loss.Panda said since Odisha, which needs 16 lakh tonnes of wheat, largely depends on other States, the import is hit by cash crunch. ""We used to send money to the traders through RTGS and they pay cash to farmers. Since currency crisis still prevails in Punjab and UP from where we procure wheat, the traders are unable to buy,"" he added."
