58f54d8d7be9e01a3579dac2,Madhya Pradesh: Spike in pulses’ output cools price,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/mp-spike-in-pulses-output-cools-price/articleshow/56709764.cms,2017-01-23,"Bhopal: Ruling at abnormally high price, good production of pulses has led to a decline in prices bringing back cheers on face of middle class.Widely consumed tuar nosedived to Rs 60 to 75 a kg in wholesale market depending on its variety. Last year, it was sold at Rs 170 per kg in wholesale and crossed even Rs 200 mark in retail.At grocery shop, it varies from Rs 65 to Rs 85 a kg, said Motiram Wadhwani , a wholesaler in at Hanumanganj grain market.Urad dal has gone down to Rs 75 to Rs 80 in wholesale market, which was sold at Rs 160 a kg. The price in retail market goes up from Rs 5 to Rs 10 per kg depending on variety of the pulse. Similarly, price of masoor has also gone down from Rs 80 a kg at wholesaler to Rs 55 to Rs 60.Good harvest has led to decline in prices of major pulses, Wadhwani said. After unprecedented increase in tuar rate last year, farmers covered more area under cultivation of pulses.In Madhya Pradesh, pulses cultivation went up by 50% from 4 lakh hectares to 6 lakh hectares last year.Agriculture department sources said, ""Area of cultivation of long duration tuar went up as many farmers opted for tuar instead of soyabean.""""Many farmers preferred pulses like urad, moong and even maize over soya in last kharif season. A good output has resulted into decline in prices,"" sources said. In fact, price of most vegetables mellowed and have come down much these days.Vegetables, including potato, onions, tomatoes and all green vegetables are being sold at low price because of good production."

(Express Photo by Shubham Dutta) When it sets off from Howrah station, the Antyodaya is almost empty, but as it enters Vijayawada, almost every inch of space is taken. (Express Photo by Shubham Dutta)From a 21-year-old fleeing the sea in Goa to a 54-year-old former bus conductor from Malda who is going to Kerala for the first time, the Antyodaya Express, a fully unreserved train between Howrah and Ernakulam, and its 20 coaches carry the shared burden of a thousand stories and dreams. The Indian Express rides alongsideFitted with cushioned luggage racks, vestibuled ends for passengers to move through compartments, drinking water dispensers, mobile-charging points, fire extinguishers and modular toilets, the Antyodaya services the Eastern-Southern railway corridor, which sees the heaviest movement of migrant workers in the country. A 2013 report by the Gulati Institute of Finance and Taxation that was placed in the Kerala Assembly said that four states  Assam, West Bengal, Bihar and Odisha  alone accounted for 62% of the migrant workers in Kerala.The train finally pulls into Ernakulam (above) on Monday morning (Express Photo by Shubham Dutta) The train finally pulls into Ernakulam (above) on Monday morning (Express Photo by Shubham Dutta)At its launch, Railways Minister Suresh Prabhu said, Antyodaya Express is a long-distance, fully unreserved, superfast train service for the common man to be operated on dense routes The facilities provided in Antyodaya coaches are similar (to those) in first class. Our governments focus is on aam aadmi so we launched the product with many facilities for them.Except, most people dont know about the train. When it sets out from Howrah at 5 pm on March 18, a Saturday, its third trip from Howrah to Ernakulam, only 200 of the 1,600 seats had been filled. Almost everyone on the train had found their way here accidentally, after missing the other train, Suvidha Special, which, curiously, runs on the same date and on the same route.The problem is that there has been very little publicity about the Antyodaya whereas the Suvidha Special continues to be completely crammed  if you get an empty patch to sit on the train, you dont move for the next 36 hours, says a senior officer of the South Eastern Railways.So this Saturday evening, as passengers gingerly get on to the new train, complete with the sheen rarely associated with the Railways, many wonder if they have got onto the wrong train.Like Mohammad Rafiqul. A few minutes after he steps in, the 33-year-old, a veteran of unreserved trains and a labourer in Kochi, realises that all 20 coaches of Antyodaya are unreserved. He sits on a berth and tentatively stretches out his legs. Then, with more abandon, he flings his small bag onto the parallel seat and says with a smile, It doesnt smell of sweat. It smells different.By 8 pm, the train is rumbling through Odisha and all mobile charging points have been taken. Music from mobile phones, ranging from folk songs of Bengal to Bhojpuri film music, compete with the steady chugging of the train. One passenger points to his GPS, the blue dot rushing parallel to the ocean and asks another, You think we can see the sea from here? The sun has set though and the observatory windows  a novelty on unreserved trains  have little to offer.Home-cooked meals are prised open, filling the train with the heady aroma of mustard and spicy fish curries. The lights stay on, all night. But that doesnt seem to bother many  as one passenger puts it, a good meal and a place to stretch your legs is all you need to get some sleep.Much of the journey continues the same way. It isnt until 12.30 on Sunday afternoon that the train reaches Vijayawada, the junction where the most number of passengers get on. Most of them are migrant workers from Chhattisgarh, Bihar and Andhra Pradesh. But the amazement of the passengers as they get to the train and the shared burden of their stories remain the same, helping workers who dont speak the same language to somehow find common ground.Take, for instance, Shaiful Sheikh. The 24-year-old from Mayapur in West Bengal works near Aluva in Kerala. He is engaged in a deep conversation with Hari Shankar Kumar from Jharkhand  about the train, the Narendra Modi governments plans for the poor and how it all connects with demonetisation. When neither Hindi nor Bengali proves to be a language they can converse in, they throw in a few Telugu and Malayalam words.Our stories are all the same. We are all here because of our stomachs, says Kumar.Over the next few hours, there are more stories  of drought, rains coming too late or too early, crops lost to blight, parents dying and leaving behind only debt, of industries moving away or eating up their land, of crooked politicians.It isnt until 1 am on Monday that the train finally fills up. As it pulls into Coimbatore Junction, hundreds fill the compartments. Some lie underneath the seats to catch some sleep, others balance themselves against the new scratch-proof walls of the new train and somehow, manage to fall asleep.At the start of the journey, many had looked around in wonder at the near empty train. Now, they sit stoic, squeezing in to accommodate more people. Isnt this how trains for the poor always are, after all?Pramod Kumar, 21No job yetFrom: Raigarh, ChhattisgarhDestination: Salem, Tamil NaduAfter a bit of coaxing, Kumar reveals the truth: he is fleeing Goa. He simply hated the place. A year ago, says the 21-year-old, he went to Goa on a whim after seeing a photograph in a magazine. I thought itd be nice to get work near the sea, he says . But that place was horrible. I used to work on a fishing boat and it was scary. I didnt know how to swim. I learnt that but what good is a little boat if the weather is bad?, he says, adding that he is now on his way to Salem, Tamil Nadu, where a cousin works.After some negotiation, Ram managed to find a train to Vijayawada from where he will travel to Salem. My cousin said the contractor would give me food and pay me Rs 8,000 or 9,000 a month. Thats better than what I was getting in Goa. Besides, thankfully, theres no sea in Salem, he says with a shudder.In his bag: A GOA T-shirt and some clothesBirender Kumar Ram, 33Juice shop ownerFrom: Karihari, JharkhandDestination: VijaywadaRam moved out of his village when he was in his twenties. My family didnt have any money. I had studied till Class 12, but there was no job in the village. So I started working in a restaurant in Tirupathi and later Hyderabad.He worked his way through different jobs  mostly restaurants, sometimes at shops. I did well because I was educated. The language was a problem, but when your survival depends on it, you can learn almost anything.A couple of years ago, Ram and his friend from his village started a juice shop in Tirupathi. We named it Balaji Juice Shop. It is a good shop on the way to the temple. I save Rs 10,000 a month, he says.Ram says he misses his family  his wife and two children are in Jharkhand  but cant say that about his village. Every time I go back to the village, it seems strange, a little alien.In his bag: A note his son wrote to him, neatly folded in his walletNaresh Sarana, 23Works at ice-making plantFrom: Gossaigaon, AssamDestination: ErnakulamThe 23-year-old has a hard time explaining where his home is. Buxa, in Assam, he says repeatedly. When told Buxa is in West Bengal, he explains patiently, Buxa, the forest. Our home is in the forest that starts from Buxa in West Bengal and comes all the way to lower Assam. My family is from Gossaigaon.The 23-year-old has studied till his Class 10 and now works in Ernakulam at an ice-making plant. He explains that whenever he travels out of home, he stops at Siliguri, a city known for its wholesale Chinese goods market. I picked up a new leather wallet there, he says with a grin.I have been working in Kerala for two years. A friend of mine told me about this job and I get paid Rs 7,500 a fortnight. My family grows a little rice on our field but that is not enough. So my parents depend on my income.In his bag: His new walletNoorwar Mondal, 32Construction workerFrom Mayapur, West BengalDestination: AluvaMondal has been a construction worker in Kerala for three years. Like his ancestors before him, he had worked as a sharecropper, but soon, found that work was hard to come by as were the wages. By 2014, he decided to join the many people from his village and make his way to Kerala.It was easier than I thought because there are so many people from Bengal in Kerala. For instance, my family told me to carry mustard oil with me so that I could make fish curry  mustard oil is hard to find in Kerala.His work is tough but pays well, between Rs 450 and Rs 500 a day, along with overtime. In Bengal, there are too many people and not enough jobs; in Kerala, people are all well educated and dont want to do the work we do, says Mondal, who spends six months with his family  wife and two children  and six months working and saving.In his bag: A bottle of mustard oilMd. Rafiqul, 33No job yetFrom Islampur, West BengalDestination: ErnakulamRafiqul used to work as a compounder in a local hospital in Islampur, a town in West Bengals Murshidabad district. But last year, after his son was born, he decided he needed to get work that paid more. His friends told him about Kerala and how he could find work laying floor tiles. So he packed his bags and took the train, his first trip to Kerala.I am a little worried. Everyone has said that Kerala has good fish. But the fish in Murshidabad is the best in the world. Our Hilsa is the best and there is no one who can cook it the way we do. I cant survive on dosas, he says laughing.And then, on a serious note, he says, My friends told me I can earn almostRs 1,000 a day in Kerala. From Ernakulam, I will meet a friend and we will go together to Thiruvananthapuram. If what they have promised comes true, it will change our lives  at least my sons if not mine, he says.In his bag: A bottle of mustard oilMohammad Isharul Islam, 26Construction workerFrom Islampur, West BengalDestination: ErnakulamIslam has been in Kerala for six years, working as a construction worker. That makes him somewhat of an old hand. So when he talks about his work in Kerala and why he doesnt think the good run will last, people around him pull in closer to hear him speak. Demonetisation was a turning point. Construction work stopped altogether and all of us were stranded, he says, adding that his employers still owe him about Rs 50,000.Still unmarried, he laughs and says that his mother is constantly horrified at the thought of him marrying someone from outside Bengal. The 26-year-old works as a construction worker, laying floor tiles in homes. Its strange working in these big homes and then going back to a cramped room. But at least I can send about Rs 3,000 to my family. But what they really look forward to is the banana chips I take for them, he says.In his bag: A family photographDeepak Dhaori, 29CarpenterFrom Jhargram, West BengalDestination: VijaywadaA carpenter, Dhaori is on his first trip outside Bengal. The 29-year-old is from Chandri, a village in Jhargram, 37 km from Lalgarh, which was the site of the November 2008 clashes between villagers and cadres of the erstwhile Left Front government.Dhaori plans to alight at Vijayawada and take the bus to Secunderabad in Hyderabad. Someone from my village is in Secunderabad and they said they need carpenters. In my village, there is no work and it has been that way for years, he says.Married, with a boy and a girl whom he has left behind, the 29-year-old says that until a decade ago, people in his village used to die due to lack of medical attention and clean drinking water. To be honest, I am scared to go to a new place. There are things, habits you never thought you would give up  like the evening tea with friends. But I had to leave home.In his bag: A new shirtSonu Ram, 40LabourerFrom Jabalpur, MPDestination: CoimbatoreOn his way to Shoranur, a town in Keralas Palakkad district, this is the 40-year-olds first trip outside home. There is no work in Madhya Pradesh. The drought last year wiped out the farms. We lost all our crops. My elder son studied till his Class 8 and then went to Kerala for work, the other is in Class 5. My son said only if both of us work can we support the family.While his son paints houses, he says he is unsure about what he will do  I may have to start by laying bricks.He had taken a train from Jabalpur to Vijayawada, from where they boarded the Antyodaya Express. Asked about the work and his expectations, he says, From what my son has told me, I can make about Rs 15,000 a month and not spend too much because the employers give us food and a place to sleep.In his bag: A list of phone numbers and directions written on a piece of paperRabindra Mali, 27Mill workerFrom Cuttack, OdishaDestination: CoimbatoreThe 27-year-old has been working for over a decade at a spinning mill in Kozhikode. From a traditional fishing family near Cuttack, Rabindra says he has never been to school. When I was 10, I went to Tirupati because I heard you can get work near the temple. I started working in a tea shop and then at a restaurant as a waiter. Later, I got this job in a spinning mill, he says.Rabindra will get off at Coimbatore and take a bus to his factory. I work about 12 hours a day and make Rs 390 a day  thats about Rs 12,000 a month, he says. The company he works for, says Mali, pays him overtime but no food and accommodation. My sister and brother-in-law also live in Kozhikode. He works in a company and she works as a domestic help, he says, adding that he hopes to someday bring his wife and 3-year-old son to the city.In his bag: A sari for his sister and a new shirt for his brother-in-lawMahesh Bharti, 24MasonFrom Jabalpur, MPDestination: CoimbatoreWhen he is not poring over Hindi film magazines, Bharti has people around him hooked with his knowledge of all things Bollywood, passionately discussing everything from Katrina Kaifs love life to Salman Khans troubles with the law.Bharti works as a contract labourer in Shoranur, a town in Palakkad district, and earns about Rs 650 a day. I am going to Coimbatore and from there I will go to Shoranur. Thats where I have been working the past year. Tiles, plaster, wall putty  I do it all, he says with a grin. His parents continue to live in Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh, where they have own some land.In his bag: A few Hindi film magazinesTapash Pappu Maity, 26WaiterFrom KolkataDestination: ErnakulamTapash Maity, or Pappu as he calls himself, worked as a waiter at various outlets of Kwality Walls in Kolkata until three years ago. The 26-year-old married two years ago and now has a year-old son.He says, The job in Kolkata was okay  the money wasnt too good, but it was good, steady work. But the problem was my salary was stuck at Rs 8,000 a month for far too long. In Kerala, I work for Lazza Ice Creams  I serve at their parlours and earn about Rs 24,000 a month.It helps to be from a big city, he says  nothing surprises me. Others, you know, they see women roaming around late at night in malls and get a shock. Not me.In his bag: Photographs of his wife and year-old sonMilan Mondal, 23Construction workerFrom Murshidabad, West BengalDestination: Ernakulam, KeralaWhen he was 12, Mondal borrowed Rs 400 from his parents, saying he was going to Kolkata to see the city, and ran away with an elder cousin.My first job was at a construction site in Kolkata  a club house run by the Left that was being renovated. In the mornings, I would fetch water and in the evenings, when the party people sat down to play cards, Id serve tea and get some bakshish. I had left home with Rs 400; when I went back eight years later, I had Rs 4,000.Mondal has been in Kerala for three years, working at a construction site in Idduki. I earn Rs 6,000 a week, much more than what I earned in Kolkata, he says, distracted as he fiddles with his smartphone. Gadgets are my real love. Tonight, I am going to watch movies on YouTube  old Bengali films. Those stories are from a simpler time.In his bag: SD card with moviesSheikh Hasibul Arinde, 40ElectricianFrom HowrahDestination: CoimbatoreThe 40-year-old is a trained electrician, having earlier worked for a government-run electrical agency in Bengal. He now works as an electrical contractor for Larsen and Toubro, on a project near Coimbatore.I have been working as an electrician for decades now. My father was an electrician at the Kolaghat Power Plant near Kolkata and I learnt from him. But to be able to work in Bengal, you need a licence and for that, you have to pay bribes to the party, he says, adding that he is glad he moved to Coimbatore.My daughter and son are in school in Howrah. I dont want them to become electricians, but I always tell them to see and experience new things. For instance, when I first went to Tamil Nadu, I had a hard time with the language. Not anymore, he says.In his bag: A new shirt that his in-laws gave himAbhishek Sarkar, 29ElectricianFrom Nabadwip, West BengalDestination: CoimbatoreSarkar met Arinde while in Kerala and the two now work together for the same company in Coimbatore. Their friendship, they admit, is rare for these times. He is Muslim, I am Hindu. We live together and eat together. I celebrate his festivals and he does mine. But when we go back home, people give us strange looks. What they dont understand is this: Hindu or Muslim, our problems are the same. God doesnt come into the picture when youre not getting paid, says Sarkar, talking about how demonetisation hit people like him.For almost two months, we didnt get paid. Employers still owe us about Rs 75,000. One of the contractors from Odisha said he would pay us soon; now he doesnt even pick his phone, he says.In his bag: His mother has packed a packet of sandesh from his favorite shopArshad Rahman, 37Labour contractorFrom Kamrup, AssamDestination: Katpadi, Tamil NaduWhen asked what he does, he says, Businessman. I am a labour contractor.I am a migrant, but not a labourer. I arrange for labourers, he says repeatedly. He says he first went to the south around 15 years ago when he got an order to get labourers to work at a Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) in Chennai. My men have made almost all the STPs in Chennai. My labourers are the best, he brags. Talking of how he began his business, he says, There were so many people in the Northeast and East looking for work that I realised it was a great opportunity.Rahman, who says he has worked in several states, including Gujarat, Telangana and Kerala, saves about Rs 30,000 a month. Work has slowed down in Gujarat because all the big projects have already come up. In Kerala, too, it will slow down. Right now, I am going to Katpadi near Vellore (Tamil Nadu) and after that, I may have to go to Telangana.In his bag: A new pair of jeansSheikh Shamim, 29Construction workerFrom Pandua, West BengalDestination: ErnakulamThis is Shamins second trip to Kerala, where he works at a construction site. After spending almost an hour worrying if he was on the right train, he finally settles down.A year ago, a contractor from our village asked me if I wanted work. I said yes, and here I am. It is hard work, but the money is better than anything you get in Bengal, he says.The 29-year-old from Pandua in Hooghly district, who dropped out after Class 3, used to work as a rickshaw driver. With his wife expecting their second child, he says he had to find a way to earn more money. I came at a bad time, though. Within a few months of my coming to Kerala, work dried up because of demonetisation. Contractors said they couldnt pay us anymore, so I went back. This time, I am planning to stay for as long as I can, he says.In his bag: Puffed rice and naaru (sweet made of coconut and jaggery)Sheikh Mantu, 54LabourerFrom Malda, West BengalDestination: ErnakulamThe 54-year-old worked as a bus conductor for close to four decades, but three years ago, after a near-fatal accident, his family said they wouldnt let him to do that work any longer. I was a conductor on the Malda-Kolkata route. I did that for 36 years. But once, our bus met with an accident  the driver was killed and my rib cage was shattered. My family was scared after that. They still call buses vehicles of death.But with his family  wife, three children and an ailing father  to take care of, Mantu had to find some work. There were others from my village working as labourers in Kerala so a year ago, I decided to come with them, he says.The work in Kerala, he says, is strenuous, but the money is good. I do plastering and painting. I used to make about Rs 400 a day, now I make twice that. But to be honest, I didnt think I would have to work at this age.In his bag: A pack of cardsShamwar Hossain, 20Construction workerFrom Mayapur, West BengalDestination: Aluva, KeralaHossain has been to Kerala only once before. He works as a construction worker there, earning Rs 450 a day. I work for a contractor who tells me where to work. The hours are regular in Kerala and pay comes on time. The government is also more sensitive to the needs of the poor. For instance, I am told that they will give me a identity card, he says.Hossains family are sharecroppers, but with agriculture in Nadia, his home district, failing, labour is no longer in demand and his father has been unemployed for five years.I dont plan to go back to Nadia. There are others who miss home. I dont. When I think about home, I think of people suffering because they cant find work and my mother skipping meals to let us to eat. In Kerala, lifes good. I earn well, I work hard and I sleep peacefully at night.In his bag: Four packets of chanachur (a snack of chickpeas, lentils and nuts)Mritunjay, 24CarpenterFrom Kharagpur, West BengalDestination: Katpadi, Tamil NaduMritunjay says never wanted to leave his home in Kharagpur. But with no formal education, the 24-year-old says he couldnt have found a job in his village. There are schools for us Adivasis in Kharagpur, but I never studied. That was a mistake.He learnt carpentry from his uncle in Kharagpur, helping him make tables and chairs for government offices. He had earlier worked in Thane as a labourer but returned to his uncles shop. Not only did they not pay well, he says, but they were cheats and the city is too crowded and people unkind.Mrirtunjay says his uncles friend is a construction worker in Vellore. My uncle said his friend would help me. He even bought me the train ticket. I have been told that I can earn Rs 500 a day and if I do a lot of overtime, over Rs 15,000 a month. Thats almost double of what I was making in Kharagpur.In his bag: Two new gamchasMohammad Firoz, 26MasonFrom: HooghlyDestination: ErnakulamThe 26-year-old first came to Ernakulam in 2008. He knew an uncle in the area, who quickly set him up to work as a bricklayer.Since then, he has progressed to being a wall putty specialist. Initially, I had some trouble with the food in Kerala. Everything is cooked in coconut oil. I dont like that. There are others who will eat just about anything. But that isnt me. I enjoy my food. Luckily, there was good beef in Kerala  that was a life saver.Firoz now earns about Rs 500 a day, plastering walls at a Kendriya Vidyalaya in Ernakulam. Its a government school so we get paid on time. I make aboutRs 3,400 a week, including overtime. That is enough for me to live comfortably  eat beef and fish once in a while whenever I dont feel like eating the food the contractors give me.In his bag: a photograph of his parentsFor all the latest India News, download Indian Express App nowFirst Published on: March 26, 2017 3:26 am"

The state goes to polls next year and analysts and political commentators feel the current turmoil might turn the farming community against the ruling party.The BJP is keeping up a brave face for the moment, saying the crisis will pass. This was completely Congress sponsored violence. In such a situation the Congress will not gain anything politically. The state government has fulfilled almost every demand of the farmers in the past over 10 years, insisted former MP and veteran BJP leader Kailash Sarang.But many others disagree. Congress has really benefited in the short term, but it remains to be seen if it would be able to cash in on the situation in the long run, said political commentator Girijashankar.In a state where farmers account for a sizable chunk of the 50 million electorate, the political ramifications of the farmer deaths could be huge. A nervous state government initially attempted to deny the complicity of the police after news broke that farmers agitating for better crop prices had been fired on in Mandsaur on Tuesday. Through the day, chief minister Chouhan and home minister Bhupendra Singh went on record to say, Police didnt fire at the farmers.By evening however, the tone and tenor of party leaders had turned defensive. The home minister admitted that the police personnel fired in at the crowd in self-defence. The government also increased the compensation to the families of the deceased farmers from Rs 5 lakh to Rs 1 crore, the largest ex-gratia payment in Madhya Pradesh so far.Farmers torch trucks at Mhow-Neemuch Highway in Mandsaur district of Madhya Pradesh on Wednesday. (PTI Photo)Many, including those even in the administration, are blaming the chief minister. First, he had reportedly refused to acknowledge the agitation when it began on June 1, and then dubbed the protesters as anti-social elements after the demonstrations turned violent.Rather than engaging with the farmers, the chief minister is also accused of seeking to divide them by ignoring their leaders such as Shivkumar Sharma and Anil Yadav. Instead, he struck a bargain with the Bharatiya Kisan Sangh (BKS), a farmer body associated with the Rashritya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS). The BKS immediately announced its withdrawal from the agitation on Sunday evening, further angering the farmers across western Madhya Pradesh.To make matters worse, state BJP president Nandkumar Singh Chauhan said the farmers affiliated with the BKS would felicitate the CM for defusing the agitation by marginally raising the procurement prices for onions and lentils. The statement alienated the farmers more, even forcing the BKS to distance itself from the planned felicitation.A state of farmersThe tragic events in Mandsaur have given fresh ammunition for another round of political slug fest.Congress, the principal opposition party in the state, is trying to seize the opportunity and punch holes in the state governments claim of successfully turning around the agrarian economy.Accusing the government of betraying the farmers, Congress spokesman Bhupendra Gupta said chief minister Chouhan spoke of farmers welfare all these years but did precious little. Gupta has also been quick to add that the Congress was a real well-wisher of the farmers.The party is hoping that following the Mandsaur violence, the perception would grow that economic benefits have bypassed the farmers.State BJP spokesman Rajneesh Agarwal, however, defended the state government and maintained that Congress plans would come to a naught, pointing to the Central-governments Krishi Karman award that Madhya Pradesh won five times in a row and the states annual agricultural growth of about 20%. These figures, he said, spoke of the prosperity of farmers in Madhya Pradesh."

(File Photo) Earlier on Saturday, Madhya Pradesh CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan sat on an indefinite fast at Dussehra Maidan in Bhopal for restoration of peace. (File Photo)The wholesale agriculture market in Mandsaur, one of the largest in Madhya Pradesh, wore a deserted look as agitating farmers stayed away from it for the 10th day on Saturday, leading to losses running into several crore rupees. The Mandsaur Krishi Upaj Mandi, spread over 30 hectares of land on the outskirts of the town, saw a sharp dip in the arrival of farm produce on June 1, when the farmers stir, demanding better price for their produce and a loan waiver, began in the state. The mandi normally attracts about 5,000 farmers everyday from several districts of Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan and records an average daily turnover of Rs 4 to 5 crore.Since June 2, trading activities have come to a complete halt and the market remained empty, causing losses of several crore rupees, said M S Muniya, the secretary of the market committee.The market mainly deals in wheat, garlic, coriander and lentil.The mandi committee, which collects a levy on the sale, has suffered a loss of Rs 10 lakh so far and its 400-odd traders too have incurred huge losses.The stir has hit us badly. There has been no business for the past 10 days. But we have to pay our employees and workers, said Bablu Agarwal, a trader.Another trader, Narendra Anna, echoed Agarwals views and expressed hoped that the situation will become normal soon.Scores of daily wagers too bore the brunt of the agitation. With no income, they had to struggle to make ends meet.The market committee secretary hoped that once the curfew was lifted, farmers will return to the market with their produce.A curfew was imposed after five people were killed in police firing when the farmers agitation turned violent on June 6. Later, another farmer Ghanashyam Dhakad (26), died in Badavan village in the violence-hit Mandsaur district.The villagers alleged that the local BJP MP and MLAs have not visited them yet.The Mandsaur-Neemuch region, about 300 km from the state capital Bhopal, was the nerve centre of the stir. Later, protests spread to some other parts of the state.Earlier on Saturday, Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan sat on an indefinite fast at Dussehra Maidan in Bhopal for restoration of peace. He has appealed to farmers to come to Dussehra Maidan and have a dialogue with him.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Yet unrest has flared in states ruled by his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), catching regional leaders flat-footed and providing a reality check on Modis promise to double farmers incomes over the next five years.The next year will be challenging for the government in ensuring farmers get decent realisation, said Harish Galipelli, head of commodities and currencies at Inditrade Derivatives & Commodities in Mumbai.Farmers in Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra are demanding better prices for their produce and billions of dollars in debt relief after the new BJP government in Indias most populous state, Uttar Pradesh, recently announced a $5.6 billion loan write-off for farmers.Yet experts say such loan waivers amount to quick fixes that cannot compensate for flaws in farm policies, which have encouraged higher production of crops previously in short supply but offered scant protection on prices.Many farm commodities are trading below support prices set by the government. That is because the government only commits serious sums to buying wheat and rice, but not other crops that enrich the diet of Indias 1.3 billion people.Prices will fall further unless exports are revived, said Galipelli, adding production has jumped but local demand hasnt risen in the same proportion. Ample world supply is likely to persist, predicts agribusiness giant Cargill Inc.There is no export parity right now. Even after the recent correction in oilmeal prices, Indian supplies are expensive, said B.V. Mehta, executive director of the Solvent Extractors Association (SEA), a Mumbai-based trade body.Indore: Farmers stage protest at Indore-Bhopal highway on Friday. (PTI)Indian grains production reached an all-time high of 273.38 million tonnes in the latest crop year, on record output of rice, wheat, oilseeds and pulses. But exports failed to revive, depressing local prices of corn, wheat, soybean and turmeric.Exports of key farm commodities fell by a quarter in 2015/16 to $16.07 billion due to drought, and failed to revive in 2016/17 despite the recovery in output.Rural distressA rising population, shrinking farm plots and increasing indebtedness among farmers have all hit Indias vast rural hinterlands. Farming accounts for 14 percent of gross domestic product - down from 47 percent at independence 70 years ago.Nearly a third of rural households are in debt, owing an average of more than 100,000 rupees ($1,560). Many farmers lack access to formal credit, forcing them to borrow dearly from money lenders or relatives.To mitigate this distress, state and central governments have ramped up purchases of red chilli, turmeric, corn, onion, sunflower, pigeon peas and groundnut from farmers.Still, farmers such as Sanjay Shinde from Maharashtras Nashik district are unhappy. If Uttar Pradesh can waive all farmers debts, then why not Maharashtra? he asked.Reserve Bank of India Governor Urjit Patel has warned that such loan waivers - forecast by BofA Merrill Lynch to reach $40 billion - would weaken already-strained state finances. It is a path that we need to tread very carefully, he said this week.Analysts and traders say good monsoon rains - forecast at 98 percent of the long-term average - will only complicate matters unless supplies are adequately managed.There is an urgent need to restrict imports and promote exports. Thats how one can bring down the inventory level of food grains, says Nitin Kalantri, a miller at Latur in Maharashtra.Otherwise in the next season we will have much a bigger problem. And much bigger farmers protests."

Onion was being sold for just Rs 1 in Madhya Pradesh till the state government stepped in to buy, potato is still being sold for 80 paise in Haryana and pigeon pea (tur dal) is fetching no more than Rs 40 in Maharashtra.The glut and plunging prices is the sum total of the crisis staring at farmers across the length and breath of the country. Last week, matters came to a head after farmers protest in Mandsaur of Madhya Pradesh turned violent, resulting in six deaths.Like everywhere else, Mandsaur farmers were agitating after they were forced to sell onions at just Rs1 a kg. The prices are well below what they fetched in 2016: Onion for Rs 1 as against Rs 7, turmeric for Rs 50, half the price in 2016, soya bean at 33% lesser than the rate in 2016 and so on.Farmers blame their plight on demonetisation and the failure of the government to impose adequate import duty on time.Farm economy runs on cash and traders say they have no money to give us. We are forced to sell the produce at whatever price they (traders) are offering, said Jasbir Mamumajra, a sunflower grower from Yamunanagar in Haryana, who blamed demonetisation for his woes.Most of the agriculture trade used to run on cash, mostly unaccounted money, and on credit. With cash being sucked out, the traders have less liquid asset to take risks. In some places they are seeking a commission of up to 2% to make payment in cash.A farm trader in Indias food bowl of Punjab, Devinder Singh, agrees, saying note-bandhi has disturbed the trade cycle. Entire trade shifted to no-credit system. It has hit us hard, he said.An agriculture expert with Bihar government, Anil Kumar Jha, said input costs such as labour, fertilisers and pesticides have gone up significantly this year. This added to the miseries of farmers, already facing cash crisis due to demonetisation.Maharashtra farmers, who were first to protest after prices of pigeon pea (tur dal) fell, blamed the Centre for not imposing high import duty on pulses.The production cost of the tur per quintal is more than Rs5,000 for farmers. With the Union government allowing the import of lentil at Rs 3,700 a quintal, the farmers are not likely to recover their cost, said Vijay Jawandhia, farm activist and Shetkari Sangathana leader.Same was the complaint by farmers in Haryana, who have been forced to sell sunflower at Rs 2,500 per quintal as against the minimum support price of Rs 3,950 even though the cost of seeds have increased by almost 50% in 2016.We could have been saved had the government increased import duty on edible (palm) oil, said Balwinder Singh, a Karnal-based farmer. However, state government officials blamed poor quality for the low price.In Asias largest grain market in Khanna, Punjab, the prices of maize have plummeted with traders like Sanjeev Kumar saying the farmers are bearing the brunt. In Uttar Pradesh, farmers sold wheat at less than the minimum support price, saying government agencies were not willing to buy the produce because of the record production this year.Wholesale traders in Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh said the prices of onion, tomato and potato have crashed.The per quintal wholesale prices of the onion in Maharashtra was down to Rs 600-800 from Rs 1,000-1,250 in 2016. Potato in Haryana was sold at Rs 80 a quintal on Tuesday. Farmers sold onion for Rs 1 in Madhya Pradesh after which the government announced a procurement price of Rs 8 per kilogram.P Chengal Reddy, founder-chairman of the Consortium of Indian Farmers Associations (CIFA), said: The Centre takes into consideration the average production of past three years and not the current years production cost, in deciding the MSP. If it continues, time is not far when farmers across the country will revolt, he said.(With inputs from state bureaus)"
5a5312af9855b770e037d03b,Problem of Plenty: How a Bountiful Harvest Brought Farm Sector to Its Knees,http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/problem-of-plenty-how-a-bountiful-harvest-brought-farm-sector-to-its-knees/story-8lfrrhXToi3WR8KeCzCxTK.html,2017-06-13,"Duty-free imports and a plentiful harvest caused a near-50% dip in food item prices in the wholesale market and by 14-20% in retail, data released by the government shows. This phenomenon gave rise to violent protests by farmers in Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan.The death of six farmers in clashes with the police in Madhya Pradeshs Mandsaur district brought the farm crisis into national focus, uniting the Opposition against the National Democratic Alliance government. The Centre, for its part, reiterated its promise of doubling farmers income by 2020.The indicators of how farm produce prices crashed this year became clear on Monday, when the Consumer Price Index (CPI) was released. One can understand the reasons for farm distress in a bumper crop year by comparing CPI prices with the latest wholesale prices of pulses and vegetables in agricultural markets.The index showed that vegetable prices fell by about 13.5% in May, as compared to the corresponding month last year. The dip in the price of pulses was even higher, at 19.5%. This led to an overall deflation of 1.05% in food prices for the first time since 2012.The fall was higher in wholesale markets, where farmers offload their produce, with pulses and vegetables selling at nearly two-thirds (or 63%) of last years price. It was a sad year for farmers despite having a bumper crop after two tough years (of drought), observed T Haque, former head of the Commission for Agriculture Costs and Prices (CACP).MANDI REPORT Main produce of each state suffered as prices crashedMain produce of each state suffered as prices crashedIn many states, the farmers have not even been able to recover the input costs, he said, adding that it was the responsibility of both the Centre and the states to ensure that agriculturists are provided with a price cushion.Highs and lowsIndias farm sector production grew by 8% this year, the highest ever.According to agriculture ministry data, the production of pulses amounted to 22.14 million tones  50% higher than 2014-15. Horticultural products, for their part, witnessed a growth of over 40%.However, the high production caused an unprecedented glut in farm markets already loaded with imported food items  including pulses. The government imposed 10% duty on these items in May, after prices crashed.In 2015-16, the Centre had allowed the import of pulses such as pigeon peas (tur dal) and lentils (mosur) to check rising prices even as the Opposition accused it of failing to control food inflation. The resultant glut in the market caused prices to come crashing, and the dip was as low as 80% for commodities such as onions and pigeon peas.I could not find a buyer for my produce for two whole days, said Mandsaur farmer Rakesh Patidar, who was finally left with no option but to sell his onions for Re 1 per kg in mid-May.Many farmers like Rakesh started growing onions after their prices skyrocketed in 2014, leading to a significant increase in its area under cultivation. Pigeon peas witnessed a similar trend in 2015 owing to crop failure.It seems like farmers were not looking at anything else, said a senior agriculture ministry functionary on the record production of onion and pigeon peas. They thought onions and pigeon peas would fetch them a good price, but they lost money instead.Farmers in Madhya Pradeshs violence-hit Malwa region, who have been growing onions since 2015, are now witnessing a dip in prices for the second year in a row. The situation is similar in many parts of Maharashtra, where the state government has now announced loan waivers.India is not the only country to have witnessed a steep fall in prices of pulses and vegetables this year. According to agriculture ministry officials, there has been an over 50% dip in prices across the globe due to a demand crunch. However, unlike India, farmers in other countries have the requisite infrastructure to store their produce and sell when prices stabilise."

(PTI) During the protests in Mandsaur. (PTI)How money reached themWhen five protesters died on June 6 in alleged police firing near Mandsaur, the epicentre of the farmers unrest, the government announced a compensation of Rs 5 lakh for each death and later doubled it to Rs 10 lakh. But with anger spreading to other parts of the state and the import of its political damage sinking in, by the end of the day, Chief Minister Shivraj Chouhan announced an unprecedented compensation  Rs 1 crore and a job to a family member of each of the victims.Opposition parties accused the BJP government of bidding over dead bodies and the district collector, since transferred and later suspended, publicly expressed his inability to pay the compensation, saying anything more than Rs 4 lakh was beyond his mandate.A week later, as Chouhan travelled to meet the family members, his secretariat ensured that the money was electronically transferred to the bank accounts of the families. Citing exceptional circumstances, the secretariat sent a note-sheet with the CMs signature to the General Administration Department (GAD) to clear the money. The GAD, in turn, sent a formal sanction letter to the collector, who later transferred the money from the local treasury.Officials in the CMs secretariat said there was no limit to the amount that can be sanctioned under the CMs discretionary fund. By its very definition, its the CMs discretion and the process is not bound by rules. The amount can be Rs 10,000 or Rs 1 crore, a top officer in the secretariat told The Sunday Express.In normal circumstances, the process is rigorous and requires verification.The CM had doled out huge amounts in the past, but that was restricted to players such as P V Sindhu, who got Rs 50 lakh from the discretionary fund after she won the silver medal at the Rio Olympics. Soldiers from the state who die in the line of duty usually get Rs 10 lakh.The BJP high command was reportedly unhappy with the hefty compensation, fearing it could set a precedent. When the sixth death, allegedly in police custody, took place in Mandsaur a few days later, family members and relatives of Ghanshyam Dhakad said they would not cremate his body until they were compensated with Rs 1 crore and a job. Since then, the Congress has demanded that every suicide by farmers be compensated with Rs 1 crore.To put things in perspective, a look at compensation packages announced in the past: On September 13, 2015, the day after an explosion left 80 people dead in Petlawad town, Chief Minister Chouhan announced a compensation of Rs 5 lakh for each death and a job to a family member. A farmer who was killed in police firing in Bareli, Raisen district, in 2012 got a compensation of Rs 2 lakh. The farmers were protesting against the delay in procurement of wheat caused by a shortage of gunny bags. In 1998, when the Congress was in power in the state, more than 19 farmers were killed in police firing in Multai town of Betul district. The victims families got Rs 2 lakh in compensation from the state government and Rs 50,000 from the Prime Ministers fund. The compensation for those who died in the 1984 gas tragedy was hiked to Rs 10 lakh in 2010.Family hopes to use the money for Satyanarayans father Mangilals (above) treatment.

The family owns five bighas, of which two bighas stand mortgaged for Rs 40,000 (the land deed is shared by the extended family), along with about 300 grams of silver and a gold-plated necklace for Rs 7,000.The Family: Having studied till Class 10, Satyanarayan was the most educated in the family; Kanhaiyalal studied till Class 2 and Raju till Class 5.Satyanarayan used to take care of all the household finances, says Kanhaiyalal, He was charming so he would convince people that he would pay off his debts later. Satyanarayan never married.The brothers, their wives, and the parents occupy a room each. The family grows wheat and alsi (flax) on their land. Last season, they also grew potatoes and peas. When not in the fields, the brothers work as labourers and are said to be good at reinforcing wells.Satyanarayans father, Mangilal Dhangar, prefers to sleep outside. The day The Sunday Express met the family, he was on a cot in the open, crying out in pain. He finally slips off the cot onto the mud floor. As he keeps groaning, the brothers call an ambulance and he is taken away. He was fine until now, says his wife Bhanwari.Whats in the house: Three cots, a ceiling fan, a table fan, lots of utensils and a tractor.That day: He had joined the protests because he was frustrated with falling prices, says brother Raju. Our debts kept rising and the returns from farm kept declining.Rs 1 crore: We will pay off our debt, though the Chief Minister told us he will get it all waived, says Raju. Some money might also be used for their fathers treatment. With the rest, they plan to buy some land.Its worth: Over 22 times their total debt.He joined the protests as expenses exceeded earnings, says Kanhaiyalals wife Sumitra (Photo: Oinam Anand) He joined the protests as expenses exceeded earnings, says Kanhaiyalals wife Sumitra (Photo: Oinam Anand)Kanhaiyalal Patidar, 44,Chillod Piplya villageSurvided by: Wife Sumitra, daughter Puja and son Jitendra.Debt: None, says wife Sumitra. He bought seeds and manure with help from the cooperative society. The interest on the societys loan is zero per cent for the first year and seven per cent from then on, so he avoided the interest, says wife Sumitra.The Family: Kanhaiyalal lived with his wife and children in a small, two-storey unplastered and unfurnished house, next to the homes of his two brothers, Jagdish and Ganpat, and other relatives.Like each of his brothers, Kanhaiyalal owned six bighas, on which he grew wheat, soybean and garlic. With the rate of wheat hovering between Rs 1,100 and Rs 1,200 a quintal, and that of garlic between Rs 800 and Rs 2,000 a quintal, each of us made only around Rs 30,000 last year, says Jagdish. Kanhaiyalal also had a cow and a buffalo and sold some of the milk. Milk sells for Rs 20-22 a litre, the price of water, says his mother, Debu Bai. The brothers also worked as daily-wage labourers.Whats in the house: Of the two rooms in the house, one is on the ground floor, and the other on the roof, which doubles up as a kitchen. There is a storehouse which has a few sacks of produce, an agricultural weighing machine and Kanhaiyalals motorcycle.That day: Kharcha nahi baith raha tha (Expenses exceeded our earnings), says Sumitra. Isiliye andolan mein gaye thhe (Thats why he joined the protest).The Rs 1 crore: The money has been transferred into the bank accounts of Sumitra and the children. Bank officials have told us that we cannot withdraw money from the childrens accounts yet and need permission from the bade sahab (big boss), says Laxmi Narayan, Sumitras father. The children say they are inspired by a relative, a doctor uncle in Ratlam, and want to be doctors too. While daughter Puja managed 50 per cent in Class 10, son Jitendra scored 70 per cent in Class 7.Sumitra says the childrens share of money will be saved as fixed deposits. Kanhaiyalals brothers also indicate they will be given some money to continue farming on his land. We will hire labourers to till his fields. All of us will also move to a better place within this village, says Jagdish. Then there are the villagers who have donated to set up a bust of martyr Kanhaiyalal in the middle of the village.Its worth: The Rs 1 crore is 625 times Pujas annual school fee of Rs 16,000, which Kanhaiyalal could not afford; his father-in-law, Laxmi Narayan, would pay the childs fee. Kanhaiyalal took care of his sons education, which cost him Rs 12,000 a year. Masterji in school told me I wont be allowed to take my exams if I didnt pay the fee. My father always somehow paid, says son Jitendra.The crore is not worth my husband, says Ghanshyams Rekha Bai (Photo: Oinam Anand) The crore is not worth my husband, says Ghanshyams Rekha Bai (Photo: Oinam Anand)Ghanshyam Salitra, 30,Badwan villageSurvived by: Wife Rekha Bai, four-year-old son Rudra, month-old daughter Himanshi, father Durgalal Dhakad, sister Shamu BaiDebt: The family owes Rs 3 lakh to two banks and another Rs 2 lakh to a cooperative society. The loan goes back years. Almost all of it was to buy seeds, manure, pay for labour, hire machines, says father Durgalal.The Family: Ghanshyam never saw his daughter Himanshi. He was at the protest site on June 8, when his wife, Rekha, returned from her maternal home, where she had delivered her daughter. He left hours before I arrived, she says. His four-year-old son Rudra jumps around the house before coming back to play with his sister.Ghanshyam had enrolled Rudra in a private English-medium school, where the annual fee is Rs 10,000, says Ghanshyams wife Rekha.The family owns four bighas on which they grow wheat, garlic and fenugreek. Soon after Ghanshyams Class 12, he started working in their fields. The chief minister came and assured me Rs 1 crore. I told him to bring back my husband. I asked him who will take care of my children. He said the government would bear all their education expenses and give me a job, says Rekha.They killed my only son, says Durgalal.Whats in the house: A bedroom, another for the produce, and a third that doubles up as a kitchen and temple. Two cows, two buffaloes, a bull and a calf, and a dog, Kalu, in a fenced enclosure. Also, three fans and a television.That day: He and other men from the village were protesting and chanting Jai Jawan! Jai Kisan! when police caned them. He tried to run but got stuck in the fence. Police took him to the station. I later came to know they hit him on his head and throat till he fell down, Durgalal says. They came home around 3.30 that night and claimed he was injured. They told us to reach the police station at 9 am, but by then they had taken him to a hospital in Indore. By the time my father-in-law got there, he was dead, Rekha says.The Rs 1 crore: Our father went to Mandsaur to open accounts in the name of the children, says Ghanshyams sister Shamu. Some money has been transferred into the accounts but we dont know how much.Its worth: Zero. This crore is not worth my husband, says Rekha.Abhishek used to help his father Dinesh (above) in the fields (Photo: Oinam Anand) Abhishek used to help his father Dinesh (above) in the fields (Photo: Oinam Anand)Abhishek Dinesh, 18Barkheda Panth villageSurvived by: Parents Dinesh and Alka Bai, brothers Madhusudan and Sandeep, grandparents Bhanwar Lal and Lakshmi BaiDebt: None. But this January, the family sold off 6 of their 29.5 bighas to cushion their expenses.The Family: Most mornings, Abhishek would assist in the fields before leaving for school around 11 am. He would then return to the farm by 5 pm, finally getting home late in the evening. He would also skip schools when there was a lot of work at the farm, says brother Madhusudan.In the just declared results of Class 11, Abhishek had scored 47.2 per cent. He wanted to do an agriculture course once he was done with school, says Sandeep, who is enrolled in a BBA course.The family grows soybean, wheat, bajra, corn, lentils. Over the past four to five years, the price of soybean has halved from around Rs 5,000 a quintal to around Rs 2,500 now. We also sold 52 quintals of onion for Rs 6,500 at Rs 1.25 per kg. How can a household run like this? asks father Dinesh.Whats in the house: There are logs of sal, about 1.5 feet in width, overhead, going across the roof of the rooms. Above them are bamboo poles, which hold a bamboo mat and the mud roof. Thats how the roof has been in this house since 1957, when we built it, says Abhisheks grandfather Bhanwar Lal, in his early 90s. The house has four rooms and a large hall which was renovated about three years ago, apart from a kitchen.That day: He had gone to the protests as he was curious others from the village were also going, says mother Alka Bai. Everyone goes to protest if the cause is genuine, adds grandfather Bhanwar Lal.The Rs 1 crore: The money has been transferred into the accounts of Abhisheks parents. They first plan to buy back the land they sold earlier this year. They also want to buy more property and reinforce their well. Brother Sandeep will get the government job. Relatives have also been turning up frequently. I learnt of Abhisheks death today (a week after the incident) and came running, says Ramesh Chand Patidar, a relative.Its worth: The Rs 1 crore can cultivate their 23 bighas nearly 72 times over. It takes Rs 6,000 roughly to cultivate a bigha of land, says Dinesh.Babloos mother had an hysterectomy operation a month ago (Photo: Oinam Anand) Babloos mother had an hysterectomy operation a month ago (Photo: Oinam Anand)Poonamchand Patidar alias Babloo, 23Takrawad villageSurvived by: Wife Anita, mother Durga Bai and sister GirijaDebt: Rs 4 lakh in unpaid home loans and about a couple of lakh more in agricultural dues for labour, seed and manure purchase, and tractor rent, among others. The family also paid Rs 50,000 for a hysterectomy operation that Babloos mother had over a month ago.The Family: With their savings and some loans, Babloos father Jagdish Ram and uncle Bala Ram built the two-storey house that Babloo lived in with wife Anita, mother Durga Bai, uncle Bala Ram and cousin Dasrath. His father had passed away in January last year, after which he dropped out of college and married Anita. The house, with eight rooms, was built two years ago, when the family enjoyed better times.Babloo inherited his fathers eight bigha on which he grew wheat, coriander, garlic and chickpeas. He also helped out on his uncles farm. We sold a quintal each of wheat for Rs 1,100, coriander for Rs 4,000, fenugreek for Rs 1,500 and garlic for Rs 3,000. Over a year ago, the rates were Rs 2,000, Rs 7,000, Rs 4,000 and Rs 8,000, says Bala Ram, who too owns eight bighas. So while he spent Rs 96,000 on the farm, he made only about Rs 60,000 last year, he adds. Moreover, the cheques against payments take over a month to be cleared, says cousin Dasrath. When not in the fields, Babloo used to repair vehicles, especially vans, to make ends meet.Whats in the house: The house is mostly empty. A crib dangles in the middle of one of the rooms.That day: Around 150 youth from our village went to protest. Police shot at a few of them from close range. He was among those hit. Villagers told us police shot him on the road. The villagers rushed him to a hospital in Mandsaur on a motorcycle but he died on the way, says Babloos uncle Bala Ram.The Rs 1 crore: The money has been transferred to a joint account opened in the names of Babloos mother and wife. The heavy dose of drugs after her operation has left Babloos mother with mental troubles, says Bala Ram. Babloos wife Anita has left for her maternal home and will return soon, he says. Sister Girija Bai too shows little interest in money matters and so, it for Bala Ram and his son Dasrath to decide. We still get notices from the bank. So we will pay that off first, says Dasrath, who dropped out of school after Class X and will get the government job.Then there are the relatives, who have not left the home since Babloos death. Will we get money? And when? Everyone only comes and takes down our names, says Babloos aunt Lakshmi. His mother Durga Bai sits expressionless.Its worth: The compensation money is 200 times the cost of his mothers operation.He had good height but never passed the Army test, says Chainarams father Ganpat Lal (Photo: Oinam Anand) He had good height but never passed the Army test, says Chainarams father Ganpat Lal (Photo: Oinam Anand)Chainaram Patidar, 23Nayakheda villageSurvived by: Wife Pushpa, parents Ganpat Lal and Manju Bai, younger brother Govind, sister PavitraDebt: Only Chainaram kept a record of the expenses, so the family has little idea if they had any loans, though they say he used to borrow from the cooperative society. If there is any debt, they dont know about it as no one has approached them yet.The Family: Chainarams two-room house is one of about a dozen small houses  mostly of his uncles and cousins  that lie on either side of a narrow lane within Nayakheda village.The family owns two bighas on which they grow wheat and soybean. When not on the fields, Chainaram would, like his daily-wager father, go looking for work.Keen on joining the Army, as a couple of village youths are in the forces, Chainaram began applying around five years ago, after he turned 18. He had good height and could run quite a bit. He cleared the physical test thrice but would always be ruled out in the medical tests; his left eye was weak, says father Ganpat, 43. On April 29 this year, Chainaram married Pushpa. She is still dazed and barely speaks.Whats in the house: A cooking stove and gas cylinder, an earthen pot and utensils. The family sleeps on the floor under the only ceiling fan in the house, which has to be prodded with a stick for it to start rotating.That day: The family says he had gone to the protest, but just to look. Villagers said he had been hit on his leg. It was only the next day that we were told he was hit on his head, says sister Pavitra.The Rs 1 crore: The money will be divided among 4-5 people, says Ganpat. There are Ganpats brothers  Rameshwar, Balu Ram, Paras Ram  and his cousins, all of whom, he says, will receive a share of the crore. Also, neighbours Mangilal, 61, and Phool Chand, 72, who have lent a shoulder. But Ganpat doesnt know how it will be divided. I am uneducated. Chainarams uncle Bharat does all the work, he has all the documents. We will all sit and divide the money soon, he says.Its worth: The compensation is 376 times the value of his familys wheat production. Last year, they produced 19 quintals of wheat and sold half of it for Rs 1,400 a quintal.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

He needed to clock 150 km on the final day on Sunday, after falling behind schedule through illness.But the 44-year-old could only complete 114 km, falling agonisingly short of his target  which was the equivalent of about a quarter of the Earths circumference.He was plagued by gastro-intestinal infections and contracted viral fever but has run 9,964.19 kms in 100 days, said Vikram Bhatti, who handled Mr. Singhs campaign.Dressed in a blue sports vest, Mr. Singh started each day in the early hours from the northern Mumbai slums and headed to the business district in the citys south.Untiring spiritMy journey of running 100 kilometres per day is very challenging but I wanted to show the endurance limit of human spirit, Mr. Singh said ahead of the final run.Friends mocked the man from Madhya Pradesh for taking on the challenge, but it became an attempt that caught the public imagination.I survived without a job for the last nine months and people have come forward and supported me with donations, shoes, clothes and equipment, Mr. Singh said.He had a GPS watch, a basic mobile phone for emergencies and Rs. 200 a day. The runner said he particularly enjoyed his meal of rice and spicy lentils, after every run.The five-time ultra-marathon winner lost 16 kg during the challenge as his exertions took their toll.I have focused on my goals with determination and nurtured my dreams despite cracked heels, fractured joints and legs, Mr. Singh said.He was spotted one day by Mumbai documentary-makers Vandana and Vikram Bhatti, who named him The Faith Runner.We met him on the 47th day of his challenge and were taken aback by his story. So, we have been running a Facebook campaign to create awareness and generate funds for Samir, said Vandana Bhatti.Fans joined him for several stretches of his run each day.Mr. Singhs run was longer than the Great Wall of China (5,500km) and further than the distance from Mumbai to London (7,200km). He went to a temple to pray on Monday, giving up a plan to complete the last 36 km.Mr. Singh said he would now rest, and then starting mapping out a new challenge  this time over 40,000 kilometres.I have not met my mother for a while as she would be heartbroken looking at my sunken face. But I am happy so many people are invested in my story right now, Mr. Singh said."

The government must ensure strict compliance of tender condition that the stock (masoor dal) supplied should be free from artificial colour and presence of kesari dal, conform to current season's crop, be in sound merchantable condition, sweet, dry, clean, free from moulds, living insects, obnoxious smell, discolouration and admixture of deleterious substances and all other impurities.""On March 6, the government issued an order permitting the Tamil Nadu Civil Supplies Corporation to procure masoor dal for supply to fair price shops. It, soon after, prohibited the supply of masoor dal to noon-meal programme on the basis of Karur district collector's report that it was unfit for human consumption. It was then that the present PIL was filed by former deputy director of animal husbandry, Aasthi Jaganathan.Granting conditional permission to authorities now, the bench said samples of masoor dal must be sent to accredited food analytical laboratories for testing, and it must be sent for distribution through ration shops only after ensuring that it was free of kesari dal and that it was fit for human consumption.The bench said, cautioning the government that it must comply with its undertaking given in the counter-affidavit filed by cooperation, food and consumer protection department principal secretary Pradeep Yadav, said: ""TNCSC must adopt a strict protocol and the masoor dal shall be brought to the supply chain only after quality check to rule out the presence of kesari dal.""In his counter, Yadav said: ""The government has never banned consumption of masoor dal by the public in the state. The presence of BOAA (Beta-N-Oxalyl Amino Alanine) in the dal sample was only due to admixture of kesari dal. It is also evident from the tests recently conducted on randomly-collected masoor dal samples from market by food analysis lab of King Institute and other private labs under food safety and drug administration department, which clearly reveal the absence of BOAA.""Masoor dal is grown in more than nine states including Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, Bengal and Rajasthan and the overall production is around 10 lakh metric tonnes. Sufficient measures have been put in place to rule out presence of kesari dal in masoor dal. There are facilities of modern technologies - grader and colour sorter for pulses, through which the presence of kesari dal in masoor can easily be identified and segregated. Besides, National Accreditation Board for Laboratories accredited food analytical labs are also available in Tamil Nadu for testing, the secretary said."
5a157f169855b76bf13ee79a,Pune techie couple enjoying viral attention over their shopping list,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pune-techie-couple-enjoying-viral-attention-over-their-shopping-list/articleshow/60866316.cms,2017-09-28,"Just last week, a young, Pune-based man uploaded the image of a hand-written shopping list for vegetables on LinkedIn  one of many crafted for him by his wife on a regular basis, to supplement his apparently not-so-perfect grocery shopping skills. What followed, however, was nothing Gaurav or Era Golwalkar had ever expected. Her succinct, practical and descriptive instructions, alongside little doodles of veggies, swept the imagination of the online world so effectively that the list went viral.With the post trending at the top of Reddit India's list on Sunday, and gaining over 10 lakh retweets on Twitter and over 30,000 shares on Facebook, the young couple residing in Balewadi has been enjoying the surprising affinity pouring in for their personal ritual, not just in India, but also from abroad.""Since I have spent a lot of time in hostels, I am generally quite bad at ingredient shopping. I don't really understand the difference between various lentils or leafy vegetables, and often end up paying more than the required price,"" laughed 31-year-old Gaurav, who hails from Bhavnagar and is partner-promoter at an education technology company. While the duo was married in 2014, Era had to leave soon after for a stint in the US. ""Even when she was there for a few years, Era often ordered vegetables online for me, or even called the vegetable vendors she was familiar with in this area,"" he added.Era, on the other hand, professed that she is rather particular when it comes to grocery shopping. ""I returned from the US in January this year, but we can't always go shopping together due to time constraints, so we divided the task between the both of us every alternate week. I made lists for him right from the beginning, but I soon realised they were not quite working,"" elaborated the 29-year-old IT analyst, who hails from Indore. ""So, I decided to make them easier to understand.""Initially, Era used at least seven or eight buying parameters per vegetable, but the lists started getting much too long  the couple then decided she would just tell him the three most important parameters for each instead. And, that's how it has been going for the last five or six months.Gaurav initially decided to upload the list on LinkedIn to catch the attention of online grocery store brands  but it took off to an unexpected scale. Now, hordes of digital denizens, who don't quite have the gift of being able choose the freshest produce, have been zeroing in on this pragmatic solution. A friend of Era's in the US even sent her the list when it was forwarded to him online, asking if it was her.""The question I've been asked the most by strangers online is whether I fulfil these shopping criteria now,"" chuckled Gaurav, as Era nodded an amused affirmative. ""The best part has been the lack of negativity or trolling about the post  everyone has taken it so positively,"" Era summed up."

""The CBI was to investigate the Vyapam irregularities. But it looks like they have become an RSS 'shakha',"" Nath said.He said that even before the law courts have decided on the Vyapam case, CBI's giving such an assurance means that it has become part of the RSS. Kamal Nath on Friday came to the state to join AICC general secretary Digvijaya Singh 's Narmada Parikrama. He is scheduled to go to Chitrakoot on Saturday and address public meetings there for the bypolls.Speaking to reporters in Indore, Nath said that Madhya Pradesh has become the ""most corrupt state"" in the country. ""We have to bow our heads in shame with the kind of corruption that happens here. There have been 160 scams since the BJP government came to power. And the state will enter the Guinness Book of Records soon for the maximum number of farmers' suicides,"" he said.He alleged that chief minister Chouhan sells dreams while farmers are suffering in 35 affected districts. ""Farmers are not getting fair price for onions or potatoes. With onions acquisition, we saw another scam. Every year, farmers are in a dilemma regarding the price of lentils,"" the senior Congress leader argued. The former Union minister explained that during UPA regime, the government used to assess how much would be the production of lentils. ""We imported only after evaluating the production in the country. That amount that would be required in addition to the production in the market,"" he said. ""But today, lentils are being imported without assessment of home production."""

(File photo) Thomson Reuters 2017As farmers in India struggle with dwindling incomes and soaring costs, with huge debts triggering a wave of suicides, experts said one solution may be to only work part-time on the land.About 60 percent of people in India make their living from the land, but earnings from agriculture have plunged to one-third of a farm family's income from two-thirds in the 1980s.""There is a strong case for part-time farming: when opportunities arise elsewhere, they must go there. And when there are new opportunities on the farm, they can return there,"" said Michael Lipton, a development economist.""That is what makes most sense, rather than have the farmer tied to his land all the time,"" the professor from Britain's University of Sussex told the Thomson Reuters Foundation on a visit to Hyderabad.Over the past decade, tens of thousands of farmers have killed themselves across India, with debt or bankruptcy cited as the main reason.Problems usually stem from failed monsoon rains or low prices due to a supply glut in produce like lentils and cereals.Deadly protests by farmers in states, including Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu, this year have led to assurances of debt write-offs of some defaulting farmers Prime Minister Narendra Modi has promised to double farmers' incomes over the next five years amid growing discontent.Employment in agriculture shrank by 26 million jobs between 2011 and 2015, according to McKinsey Global Institute, the research arm of the consulting firm.Seven out of 10 rural households in India are landless or own plots of less than 1 hectare or 2.5 acres.Although landless farmers do not qualify for government loans or insurance to protect against crop losses, they earned more than land-owning farmers when there are other job opportunities, HSBC India said in a report earlier this year.Common alternative sources of income are the government's rural jobs scheme, which is often road-building work, and earning daily wages in cities, such as on construction sites.""After a good monsoon, there is increased demand for labour. As a result, real wages rise; this has largely benefited the landless class, given that a majority of their income comes from wages,"" HSBC India's chief economist Pranjul Bhandari said. ""On the other hand, the landed, who pay these wages and are more directly dependent on income from cultivation, have taken the brunt of falling food prices.""(Reporting by Rina Chandran, Editing by Katy Migiro)"

Express photo by Praveen Khanna At Dilli Haat, INA. Express photo by Praveen KhannaMukund Baghel, 50, has never been to Delhi before. The Bastar-based farmer has also never befriended anyone from Manipur. But at Dilli Haat, as he sits next to a live demo of mahua maand  the sacred drink of the adivasis  he has found a friend in a Manipuri woman manning the stall.I have never spoken to anyone from Manipur, I have never spoken to a foreigner either. Ive never got this much exposure before. Bastar is known to people here as a violent place but we have so much to offer maybe the opinion of city people will change now that we are here, he said.At the ongoing Aadi Mahostav, organised by Tribal Cooperative Marketing Development Federation of India (TRIFED) at four venues across the city, tribal communities from across the country have come together to display artefacts, jewellery, clothes, and food items.Apart from items on sale are stories, myths and traditions native to these communities that have found space in this festival. From Dindori in Madhya Pradesh, Braj Bhushan Dhurwe, 30, brings a wedding tale to the forefront through his Gond painting  a deity who turns into a tigress on the day of the wedding. While, Ganesh Mahadev Wangad, 36, from Palghar in Maharashtra presents Tarpa dance on his Warli painting canvas.People in my village still do the Tarpa dance during Diwali, but now its not as popular. I am bringing it to Delhi through my work, maybe people here will understand us and our rituals and traditions better, said Wangad, whose family has been doing Warli painting for four centuries now.Over the next four months, TRIFED plans to take the festival to all states in the country.The response has been phenomenal till today, the artisans have done business worth Rs 1.5 crore. In terms of talent, theyre second to none but in terms of exposure, theyre lagging behind. This is our effort at giving them that exposure. The festival will come back to Delhi next year as well, said Pravir Krishna, Managing Director, TRIFED.On till November 30, the food stalls towards the end of Dilli Haat too throw up revelations such as Chilra, a multigrain bread and seabuck thorn tea from Lahaul and Spiti.Im a housewife and selling food is not my business. This is my first time in Delhi and the sale has been good, I might turn it into a proper business after this experience, said 38-year-old Savitri Nalwa, who is manning the Himachal Pradesh food stall. There is khadia roti with chicken curry from Odisha; dhuska, gulgula and Maruwa roll from Jharkhand; and pork ribs from Nagaland at the festival.Apart from paintings, clothes and jewellery, there are also stalls selling lentils, honey and pickles. Umrao Singh, 64, from Chamoli in Uttarakhand, is busy explaining the medicinal benefits of the rose water bottles he has brought to Delhi, along with packets of rajma, Kulthi dal, rosemary and apricot oil.The rose is from Bulgaria but the oil is developed in Chamoli; all the stuff Ive brought is organic. Being in Dilli Haat gives us exposure, badava milta hai Ill come back next year too, said Singh, who has already shopped for his family from other stalls at the festival.For all the latest Delhi News, download Indian Express App"
