Above all, this expands access to higher education for remote populations. But the relationship of the university and its neighbourhood is multi-directional, especially when the university looms as a large embodiment of modernity in a space where tradition seemed dominant until now.The Indira Gandhi National Tribal University Act of 2007 parked the first Indian university of its kind, one that attracts majority tribal students and whose core strength is research on tribal culture and heritage, off the beaten track, in Amarkantak, Madhya Pradesh.Having just returned from a visit to IGNTU, I want to share some of the experiences that seemed very striking and portentous. This first blog about these experiences is about some of the universitys rural neighbours and their expectations of it.The following video is taken early morning in Pamra village. You can get to it through a sylvan path through a hole in the university wall  on one side of which are the red and yellow buildings, departments, hostels, guesthouses, library etc and on the other side tamarind and sal trees, hibiscus and jack fruit, chirping birds, masoor fields, clean, cool and mud tiled huts. On that side the battle with plastic and waste has begun; on this side Swachh Bharat is not a struggle but salient reality  fruit of a simple, organic lifestyle. On this side, captured in the video, time seems to have stood still.In the fields seen in this video they are not even using pesticides. But not too far down the path there is some dodgy looking bauxite mining going on, digging ugly craters in the meadows, leaving toxic looking lakes in its wake.As we walked back to the university, a villager working a field along the path called us over and said the above-mentioned mine was without an extant lease, he had seen other such mines wreak havoc on agriculture in neighbouring villages, but the bullies running the mine just wouldnt listen, couldnt the university do something about it?A few hundred steps closer to the university another villager conveyed to us not a plea but a plaint. In her courtyard were piles of the masoor dal crop, she pointed to its poor health, expressed sorrow over the poor rains, and then said what made her life harder was that she couldnt even buy vegetables from the market now  because the university had sent prices through the roof!The lives of the university and its surrounding villages are now intertwined. It provides work and hope of a better life. But alongside better schooling and jobs will come more plastic, more demand for scarce water, houses built with heating tin rather than cooling muds, the danger of deforestation, the pressure to use pesticides to increase yields.Can the university progress by leaps while its surroundings remain as sylvan as today? Yes. For example, water harvesting lakes are being established across the campus. The new buildings have energy efficient architecture. Respecting the organic lifestyle of its rural neighbours will go a long way in preserving and reproducing it.Respecting context is critical. Below is a picture of a Swacch Bharat toilet we saw at the Farri Semar tribal village, a few hours uphill trek from the university. On spotting it, one was struck by wonder. Wow the government delivered! But of course behind the blue door we found piles of stray leaves  making it clear that this toilet is not even being used to store crops. Its completely out of place, absolutely pointless.For a people used to going in the forest and still surrounded by forest, whats the incentive for using the new toilet? We are talking about a sparsely populated mountain village practising organic self-sustaining farming. The springs here are not threatened by faeces and plastic but bauxite, which brings us to another key point. For villagers who have to carry drinking water up and down the mountain, whats the incentive to carry even more water for cleaning the Swachh Bharat Mission toilet? A water less model may have had more success here.Basic lesson is respect context. In doing this, IGNTU can set new benchmarks for a university at one with its environment. But no question, this will have to be a careful balancing act  some local features like health and education need to be modernised while others like cleanness, organic farming, low emission lifestyles, tribal art and culture, etc need to be conserved. Still, as Samuel Johnson said, Few things are impossible to diligence and skill. Great works are performed not by strength, but perseverance."
5904af9d7be9e04154dfa5f7,"Amarkantak II – Two tribal brothers, a wild boar and desperately awaiting DBT",http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/twinkle-twinkle/amarkantak-ii-two-tribal-brothers-a-wild-boar-and-desperately-awaiting-dbt/,2016-04-09,"This is the story of lessons learnt on a trek from the Indira Gandhi National Tribal University to the neighboring Baiga village of Farri Semar, in Amarkantak, Madhya Pradesh. As mentioned in my previous post in this series, in this tribal hinterland, the lives of the university and its surrounding villages are now intertwined.On the half day Farri Semar trek being discussed here, the guru was award-winning photo artist and tribal documentarist Manohar Kajal, the guide was Gond tribal and department employee Omkar Singh Marari, the students Nritya Gopal, Julee Rajput, Priyanka Sharma and Rohit Kumar Burman  all from the Department of Journalism & Mass Communication.The village is made up of sparsely scattered, large and many-roomed mud huts, sitting amidst dry looking fields of masri aka masoor dal and desi chana. The trees are pretty and beneficent  those eucalyptus and pine transplants happily didnt make much inroads here. There are majestic tamarinds. Char aka chironji. Mulberries and papaya. Tendu  its leaves make bidi but the fruit is surprisingly wholesome. Munga aka drumstick tree. Pakri whose leaves translate into a vegetable delicacy. And of course the rich red flowering semal, which gives the village its name, ready to bloom into cotton.Amongst the many joys of wandering through this idyllic looking and very friendly village, the students were pursuing two specific quests. To find and photograph the native Baiga tribals traditional hunting tools and to find out if the village elders were receiving their pensions.Although these two research questions appear distant at first glance, the uniting factor is that both seek answers among the elderly, with whose passing a whole way of life will pass away.In the first case the challenge was that with wildlife having become sparse and conservation laws having become strict, most houses have junked or sold their hunting tools  the youngest generation doesnt even remember what they looked like.In the second case while it quickly became evident that there was a serious problem in the pension flow into the village, the challenge was that the homesteaders had poor understanding of documents and rights and bank accounts  even speaking their own address in a way GoI would comprehend appeared an insurmountable trial. Forget Aadhaar numbers, many didnt seem to know their house number.Panku Baiga, above, is blind and 85 years old we are told. He should be getting Rs 500 a month under the Indira Gandhi National Old Age Pension scheme. His granddaughter said the family has been running after various village officials, finally there is a cheque in the pipeline but they havent gotten any money yet.About other schemes we heard talk of village officials passing on the monies after keeping a bit for themselves. We heard of a man who used to get a pension but then it stopped. We didnt meet anyone who admitted to getting a pension.The children of Panku Baiga do farming and small jobs. His hunting tools are also long gone. But his memories of them are vivid. He grins like a child talking about those days. Birds he hunted plenty. And some black bucks and wild boars. In the above picture he is showing us his hand, with half a thumb missing. It was lost in an epic battle with a really big boar  it took ten men to carry back that prey.A meander and some tendu and tamarind and water later, we found a family happy because of the recent birth of a little one. Their house, seen above, was large and super clean like most others in the village, with its roof speckled with drying herbs and vegetable greens.Here we met Mangal Baiga. He is 100 years old his family say. Hes lost his hearing. Hes not getting any pension either. Turns out hes Pankus elder brother!When we ask the family if they have any hunting tools they all sort of coyly giggle and say theyve given up all that sort of thing, everybody does farming now, whats left to hunt anyway. But a bit more persuasion and lo and behold. They bring out the bow and arrow and Mangal Baiga proudly poses with them.They dont hunt any more but we shouldnt touch that arrow tip because its coated in poison. Hmmm. Wonder why? Mangal Baiga refuses to toe this coy line. He still believes and says straight that the bow and arrow is the tribals true treasure.Well theres obviously little of it left. The pension could compensate. But neither 85 years old Panku Baiga nor 100 years old Mangal Baiga has ever seen it. This then underlines the imperative of spreading the Direct Benefit Transfer scheme fast. If DBT takes its own sweet time reaching this remote hamlet, death may win out."

Within a week, it has touched 150 per kg from Rs 120 per kg.According to market sources, poor yield in Bundelkhand and Madhya Pradesh has soared the prices.UP Dal Miller Association president Mithlesh Gupta said that Bundelkhand in Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh were the main producers of arhar. Production was low due to draught in these areas.Farmers are selling their produce at high cost, as a result prices in open market rose. Hoarders too were exploiting the situation. He informed that impact of arhar dal had made the price rice in other pulses. Gram pulse, which was available for Rs 61 per kg on April 3 had recorded a hike of Rs 12 to 13 per kg. At present, gram dal was Rs 72 to 73 per kg.The traders expect that the prices may go up further and suggested that the government should import lentils to meet the domestic demand and take stern action against hoardersThe country consumes around 18 to 19 million tonnes of arhar, whereas production is around 14 to 15 million tonnes."
58f56dc8a3d24b0b70c21428,Insure farmers against climate change,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/insure-farmers-against-climate-change/article8587072.ece,2016-05-12,"Bundelkhand is where Indias marginal farming dream died. Known for the dacoits of Chambal and the Rani of Jhansi, the arid region, occupying districts of Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh, has experienced drastic variation in climate in recent times. It faced a drought from 2003 to 2010, then floods in 2011, delayed monsoons in 2012 and 2013, and drought again since 2014. Farmers tried everything to adapt  growing a mix of dry crops during the kharif season, while interspersing the winter rabi wheat with cash crops like chickpea and mustard. They invested heavily in borewells, tractors, threshers and seeds and fertilizers through formal and informal credit.The past two winters, with hailstorms and unseasonal rain, destroyed crops (chickpea yields were mostly wiped out, the arhar crop failed completely), leading to farmer suicides (3,500 since 2003) and mass migration. Mitigation has been lacking; contractors not farmers benefit, and instead of providing crop insurance, warehouses are built. Bereaved families, hoping for compensation from the Uttar Pradesh government (Rs.7 lakh on death), were instead offered wheat bundles.India, a climate change hotspotIndia is uniquely vulnerable to rising temperatures  it ranks in the top 20 in the Climate Change Vulnerability Index. Our average surface temperature, over the past four decades, has risen by 0.3 Celsius, accompanied by a rising incidence of floods, droughts and cyclones. With the majority of all landholdings in India measuring less than a hectare, marginal farmers face a steep decline in household income and a concomitant rise in household poverty through exacerbated droughts. Climate change would impact soil health, with increasing surface temperatures leading to higher CO{-2}emissions and reducing natural nitrogen availability. Mitigating this by increasing chemical fertilizer usage could impact long-term soil fertility, leaving the soil open to greater erosion and desertification. Meanwhile, migration patterns, farmer suicides and stagnating rural incomes, along with increasingly ad hoc land acquisition in the name of public goods, have politicised the idea of climate mitigation. Marginal farmland will increasingly be useless for agriculture.Our dependency on rain continues to amplify  rain-fed agriculture is practised in the majority of our total cropped area supporting a significant proportion of the national food basket (55 per cent of rice, 90 per cent of pulses, 91 per cent of all coarse grain). Our regional crop patterns assume a specific range of weather variability, failing to cope with the recent high periods of heavy rainfall with long dry intervals. In 2013, large crops of wheat, gram, lentils and mustard, weeks away from harvesting, were destroyed in untimely rains. Indias flood-affected area has doubled since Independence, despite generous state spending on flood protection schemes.Research has highlighted the deleterious impact of climate change on crop production. By 2100, the kharif season will face a varying temperature rise (0.7-3.3 Celsius) with rainfall significantly impacted. Limited temperature rises could lead to a 22 per cent decline in wheat yield in the rabi season, while rice yield could decline by 15 per cent. Other staple crops  sorghum, groundnut, chickpea  could see a sharp decline. Its impact is already prevalent: it is estimated that without rising temperatures and rain variability, Indias rice production over the past four decades could have been 8 per cent higher. India is home to the largest hungry population  falling agricultural yields will only make matters worse.Some policy prescriptionsOur low agricultural productivity remains a key constraint. According to the Swaminathan Committee on Farmers (2006), for rice, we produce 2,929 kg per hectare, while China produces twice as much. For other staples, we remain woeful, producing 913 kg of groundnut per hectare, while Indonesia produces nearly half as much more. As suggested by the National Commission on Farmers, a rural spending plan, focussed on investments in agriculture infrastructure, particularly in irrigation, rainwater harvesting and a national network of soil-testing laboratories is needed. Simple water harvesting and conservation measures (micro-irrigation, watershed management and insurance coverage) can reduce the majority of the potential loss due to drought (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 2013). Drought strategies should be extended to the village level  for example, each village should have a village pond, created under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme.Indian agricultural policy has made us structurally vulnerable to climate change. As suggested often by the National Commission on Farmers, conservation farming and dryland agriculture should be promoted. Each village should be provided timely rainfall forecasts along with weather-based forewarnings regarding crop pests and epidemics in various seasons. Afforestation, in a biodiverse manner, should be encouraged to help modify regional climates and prevent soil erosion. Our agricultural research programmes need to be retooled towards dryland research  it has been argued that adoption of drought-tolerant breeds can help reduce production risks by nearly a third, while offering attractive returns to breeders. Changing planting dates could have a significant impact; research highlights that planting wheat earlier than usual can help reduce climate change-induced damage. Zero tillage and laser-based levelling can also help conserve water and land resources. Crop planning can be conducted as per the climatic zones of different regions, while utilising better genotypes for rain-fed conditions.We should focus on expanding our formal credit system to reach all marginal farmers. Insurance coverage should be expanded to all crops while reducing the rate of interest to nominal levels, with government support and an expanded Rural Insurance Development Fund. A debt moratorium policy on drought-distressed hotspots and areas facing climate change calamities should be announced, waiving interest on loans till farming incomes are restored. The Centre and States should launch an integrated crop, livestock and family health insurance package while instituting an Agriculture Credit Risk Fund to provide relief in the aftermath of successive natural disasters.Climate change will impact the entire food production chain, affecting our food security. Livestock production, often considered to be a substitute to farming for marginal farmers, would face reduced fodder supplies given a decline in crop area or production. With Indias population rising, demand for diversified crops will be hard to square with diminishing yields. Agricultural investments in food crops, along with systemic support for irrigation, infrastructure and rural institutions can help move India beyond climate change-induced food insecurity, strengthening our stressed food production systems. Through adaptation and mitigation measures, we can overcome this Hobbesian crisis.Feroze Varun Gandhi is a Member of Parliament, representing the Sultanpur constituency forthe BJP."
58ff0c447be9e0420db2be6a,SC orders states to feed the drought-hit,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160514/jsp/nation/story_85645.jsp,2016-05-14,"New Delhi, May 13: The Supreme Court today passed a slew of directions for immediate supply of foodgrain, lentils and edible oil, plus milk and eggs for children, to people in 12 drought-hit states, as it came down heavily on the governments' failure to properly implement the food security act. A bench of Justices Madan B. Lokur and N.V. Ramana said there would be ""utter chaos"" and a collapse in the country's federal structure if the states chose to violate a parliamentary enactment. The National Food Security Act is deemed to have come into force from July 5, 2013. The court said the right to food was a ""constitutional right"" and states were bound to provide not just foodgrain under the NFS act, but also dal and edible oil despite there being no provision for such additional benefits. Foodgrain and mid-day meals should be given free of cost, the court said, while lentils and edible oil should be provided at subsidised rates of Rs 30 per kg and Rs 25 per litre respectively. (see chart). The court was hearing a PIL by Swaraj Abhiyan, a non-profit organisation, seeking supply of adequate foodgrain, dal and edible oil for the 12 states. The states are Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Telangana, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Jharkhand, Maharashtra, Bihar, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh. An estimated 50 crore people are affected. Under Section 3 of the NFS act, the monthly entitlement of foodgrain is 5kg per person for eligible households under the ""priority"" category and 35kg per family under the Antyodaya Anna Yojna for rice, wheat and coarse grains. There is no provision for supply of 2kg dal and one litre edible oil to the households under the act and supply of eggs/milk to schoolchildren under the midday meal scheme. The apex court rejected the Centre's argument that it would be difficult for the states and the Union government to provide such benefits as it would have large financial implications. ""A state government, by delaying implementation of a law... is effectively refusing to implement it and Parliament is left a mute spectator. Does our Constitution countenance such a situation? Is this what 'federalism' is all about?"" the court asked. ""Deliberate inaction in the implementation of a parliamentary statute by a state government can only lead to utter chaos or worse. One can hardly imagine what the consequence would be if a state government, on a similar logic, decides that it will not implement other parliamentary statutes meant for the benefit of vulnerable sections of society."" The court expressed surprise that some states had not implemented the act. ""...Uttar Pradesh has partially implemented the NFS act in the sense that it has been implemented only in 28 of its 75 districts. Gujarat has admittedly implemented the NFS act only from 1st April, 2016. ""It is surprising that the implementation of a law enacted by Parliament... is left to the whims and fancies of the state governments, and it has taken more than two years after the NFS act came into force for Gujarat to implement it and Uttar Pradesh has only implemented it partially. This is rather strange."" It added: ""No one can doubt that children are the future of our country and if there is some stinginess in providing them with adequate nutrition, the country as a whole is deprived in future of taking the benefit of their potential."" Taking a serious view of the way in which most states had started implementing the NFS act only from 2015, Justice Lokur said: ""Hopefully, someone somewhere sometime will realise the possible alarming consequences. ""Similarly, the entitlement of foodgrain at 5kg per person per month is a goal that must be achieved by the state at the earliest.... ""In fact, statute or no statute and implementation or non-implementation of a law enacted by Parliament, the state ought to appreciate and realise that an adequate supply of foodgrain must be made available without much fuss to people in drought-affected areas. ""As it is, because of the drought, such persons undergo immense hardship mainly for reasons beyond their control, and if there is a scarcity of food, it would only add to their misery."""

Madhya Pradesh Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission ordered the seeds corporation to pay farmers an interest of Rs 4.26 lakh.The orders have been given by the bench to commission comprising expert member Subhash Jain and S D Aggarwal on May 28.Farmers of Tikamgarh filed a complaint against National Seeds Corporation Limited in district consumer forum in 2012. They had bought seeds in 2010 under the scheme of state government with the help of assistant director after analysing farmlands. The seeds were actually manufactured by State Farms Corporation of India Limited. Seeds were sown as per regular technique, but seeds did not grow. When the case was registered with district consumer forum, a report of inquiry by district collector and agriculture department officers was filed on directions of forum which stated seeds were of extreme poor quality.Later moving on to the higher commission Madhya Pradesh Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission, an appeal was filed in 2015 by National Seeds Corporation Limited, but after analysing the report and hearing both the parties, commission decided to go by the orders of district forum and asked the corporation to pay the compensation for the loss of farmers. District forum initially has also directed to pay the same amount of compensation to farmers."

It sold for three times its estimate. Christies London had a beautiful note of nostalgia to share with art lovers. Gaitonde and Ram Kumar first met in Bombay in the early 1950s through the artist and gallerist Bal Chhabda, who was a common friend. Although Kumar was living in Delhi following his return from France, he frequently travelled to Bombay to exhibit his work at the Alliance Franaise, once even moving his family to the city for six months in 1954. Gaitonde, too, would travel to Delhi for his exhibitions at Kumar Art Gallery, and the two continued to meet, developing a close friendship based on mutual respect that would last till Gaitonde passed away in 2001.Over the next two decades the two artists met frequently, even though they lived in different cities, often along with others like Tyeb Mehta, Krishen Khanna and Maqbool Fida Husain. When Gaitonde, Husain and Mehta set up studios at the Bhulabhai Memorial Institute in Bombay with several other artists, Kumar remembers spending a lot of time with them there. Around the same time, in 1957, Gaitonde and Kumar collaborated with Husain and Mehta to establish the short-lived artists collective, Shilalekh, and produced a series of lithographs together so that their work could reach wider audiences.Ram Kumar recalls that even in the 1950s Gaitonde was completely sure of himself and his work, inspiring a great deal of confidence in him and in many other artists. Although he did not talk about his work and was not directly associated with any particular group of artists, he was respected by everyone in the art world. It was commonly said that when artists like Syed Haider Raza visited Bombay, they would first pay their respects at Mahatma Gandhis samadhi or memorial and then at Gaitondes door!When Gaitonde moved to a barsati in the Jangpura neighbourhood of Delhi in 1972, the two became neighbours as well. At least once a week, Kumar would stop by Gaitondes house on his way to buy groceries in the evening. A writer as well as an artist, Kumar would regale Gaitonde with stories of the art community, which the latter stood apart from but enjoyed hearing about, and of his many travels around the world. As Kumar was the only one in the neighbourhood with a phone, he also found himself conveying news and messages to and from his friends house. Often, the two would go to the cinema together or to the India International Centre to watch obscure French films.Along with his wife Vimla, Kumar took great care of Gaitonde in Delhi. Gaitonde was very fond of Vimla, although he categorically forbade her to clean his messy flat. Every day, she would ensure a box of daal or lentils would be sent to him from the Kumar household so that he had soft food to eat given his stubborn refusal to get dentures! Kumar also remembers the two of them buying a colour television for Gaitonde along with Husain and Arun Vadehra, so that he could replace the old box set he used to keep switched on all day long.Over the many years of their friendship Ram Kumar also made sure Gaitonde was financially stable when he needed it the most. Apart from arranging various grants for him, Kumar also wrote and spoke on Gaitondes behalf as a member of the jury for the Madhya Pradesh Kalidas Samman art award in 1988-89. Gaitonde won the award, and with its substantial funds was able to resume working on canvas after a debilitating accident he suffered a few years earlier.In the same spirit, Kumar bought this painting (lot 5) from Gaitonde at an exhibition in Delhi in the mid-1970s. After Kumars first choice of paintings from the show was requested by Tom Keehn, their friend and the American representative of the Rockefeller Fund in India, he gave it up and picked this luminous canvas from 1975. For more than forty years, Ram Kumar proudly hung this painting in his home, a mark of the high regards in which he held Gaitonde, and his deep respect for the latters artistic integrity and uncompromising dedication to his work."

But farmer's wife purchases same lentils at Rs120.""Senior state leader Singh said, ""In today's context, Congress in the state is not working in the manner it should have. Who are not active or can be made active is not the issue. We all want to work but if work is not distributed and responsibility is not assigned, then workers will sit at home."

It has acquired RH Agro 's rice mill in Sonipat, Haryana, for Rs 70 crore and has taken four other rice mills across the country on exclusive lease, which will help it launch 18 packaged rice brands by the end of this month.At present, Patanjali sells three variants of packaged rice  silver, gold and diamond. It meets its procurement needs by buying finished rice and packaging it at its Haridwar facility. The new mills will not only give the FMCG company the capability of producing 3.2 lakh tonnes of finished rice a year from paddy but will also allow it to produce region-specific rice variants that it plans to sell locally and export as well.""The acquisition will give us technical know-how in rice processing,"" said Acharya Balkrishna, MD of Patanjali Ayurved. ""We have partnered with thousands of rice farmers in many regions of the country to produce traditional variants.""Other than the mill in Sonipat, which will process basmati, Patanjali has leased two mills in Madhya Pradesh to process the pusa variety. Another mill in Telangana will produce the lightweight aromatic sona masuri to cater to markets in the south, while a mill in Fazilka, Punjab will process rice grains that are grown in the north. Around 150 varieties of rice are currently grown in the country, industry estimates showed.Patanjali, known for its best-selling products such as cow's ghee and ayurvedic toothpaste Dant Kanti, has drawn up an ambitious strategy to disrupt India's packaged rice market, which is currently dominated by brands such as India Gate, Kohinoor, Best Basmati and Daawat. Research firm Euromonitor has valued the market at Rs 22,000 crore and said it will grow at a CAGR of 11% till 2020.""The rice brands will be made available in 50 SKUs (stock keeping unit) of various sizes,"" said Balkrishna. Prices will range between Rs 67 for one kilo of Sona Masoori Steam and Rs 2,100 for 25kg of Lashkari (kolam), the company said. Senior executives at Patanjali said its new rice variants will have a shelf life of two years, which is double that of brands available in the market. ""Some of our variants will also take less time to cook than competing brands,"" they said."

Newly constructed farm pond in Mataundh village of Banda district, UP.Back-to-back droughts wreaked havoc on agricultural production and farmers incomes across India in 2014-15 and 2015-16. Regions like Bundelkhand were all the more affected, as the absence of any protective irrigation cover forced large-scale distress migration of rural residents to cities, including the national capital. Bundelkhand being one of Indias main pulses growing belts, the impact of the drought there was also felt through the sharp spike in prices of legumes.Watch What Else Is Making NewsOne way to at least partly insulate regions against droughts is through constructing of farm ponds on a large scale. Many states  Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh (MP) and Karnataka, among others  have dabbled with this solution with reasonably encouraging results.Stopping rainwater run-off and its storage in large man-made tanks/lakes was part of traditional wisdom in Bundelkhand. The regions Chandela rulers built many such artificial reservoirs such as the Kirat Sagar, Vijay Sagar and Madan Sagar in Mahoba and adjacent areas. But in recent times  especially following the Dewas experiment in MP  the focus has been more on farm ponds. These are farmers individual assets, unlike community tanks/lakes that are public assets. Construction of farm ponds requires farmers to set aside a piece of their land for this purpose, which farmers were reluctant to do earlier. But the consecutive monsoon failures are now making them seeing the utility of such assets.Bundelkhands population density, as per the 2011 Census, was 328 persons per square km, below the 828 persons for Uttar Pradesh (UP) and the national average of 382. Average landholding for the region, at 1.43 hectares, is also higher than the 0.76 hectares for the whole of UP. The larger landholdings, plus only a very small area having assured irrigation and recurring droughts, has made its farmers more receptive to construction of farm ponds.Taking the above facts into account, the UP government conceived a scheme under the Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana, which offers a 50 per cent subsidy to farmers for construction of farm ponds. The cost estimate for a 1,320 cubic meter pond (20*22*3 meters)  which can provide one irrigation for a one-hectare farm  was put at Rs 1.05 lakh. Under the scheme, the farmer would contribute half of this amount, with the government subsidising the balance 50 per cent. At the same time, the farmer was given the freedom to hire the machine for construction himself. Besides, even if he engaged family rather than hired labour, the government would not reduce its absolute subsidy contribution of Rs 52,500. This flexibility gave a huge boost to the speedy construction of farm ponds.The UP governments initiative was launched in April this year in all the seven Bundelkhand districts falling in UP: Jalaun, Jhansi, Lalitpur, Hamirpur, Mahoba, Banda and Chitrakoot. Initially, 2,000 farm ponds were sanctioned, of which 500 were earmarked for the worst-hit Mahoba district. The fact that 1,900 ponds got built by end-June before the onset of the monsoon was proof of the farmers enthusiastic response to the scheme, in which NGOs and officials also played major roles. Many farmers, in fact, even invested extra money to construct ponds of larger size. Riwai village in Mahobas Charkhari tehsil alone saw 25 ponds of 2,000 cubic meters each getting built by farmers.The state government has subsequently sanctioned 2,500 new farm ponds for Bundelkhand. Of these, 1,200 will be of 3,100 cubic meters size that can store enough water to give one irrigation over 2.5 hectares. Bundelkhand, as already pointed out, is a pulses bowl. These, unlike paddy or wheat, require only one or, at most, two irrigations after planting. The farm ponds  which are brimming with water after a good monsoon this time  will be of immense use for the chana (chickpea), masur (lentil) and matar (green peas) crops grown during the winter rabi season.Assured irrigation created through farm ponds has led to some farmers in Bundelkhand even planning rearing of fish or taking a crop of singhaada (water chestnut) in their fields. There could also be scope to earn extra income from planting of fruit-bearing trees on the bunds. By enabling harvesting and conservation of rainwater, creating irrigation potential and providing a means of drought proofing, farm ponds have shown they can be a potential game-changer for even parched regions like Bundelkhand.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"
58d929e7a3d24b224f242b2b,From Amma Canteens to Annapurna Rasois: Low Price Kitchens Mushroom across India,http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/from-amma-canteens-to-annapurna-rasois-low-price-kitchens-mushroom-across-country/story-XGla3f7iQqtU77vEE2zTOL.html,2016-12-20,"Economists deride them as populist measures that burn a big hole in the budget, but more and more states across the country are rolling out soup kitchens for the poor.First popularised by the late J Jayalalithaa, Tamil Nadus former chief minister, the canteens selling hot wholesome meals at subsidised rates are an instant hit.Besides the food, the kitchens also have proven to be a great recipe for accruing political goodwill for those in power.Last week, Rajasthan became the latest state to launch its own scheme.HT reporters visited the kitchens across several states, to taste the meals and the mood.RajasthanThis is as good as one can get, said Surendra Soni from Alwar, as he gorged on Gehu ka Mitha Khichda (porridge made of wheat) being served hot at a mobile kiosk outside Jaipurs SMS Hospital.I come to the hospital regularly for health checkups and this new scheme has turned out to be boon for us. The food available here is way cheaper than that of SMS Hospital canteen. Add to that, the food is tasty and hygienic, Soni explained.People buy lunch brought from the Annapurna Rasoi van at SMS hospital, in Jaipur, Rajasthan. (Himanshu Vyas/Hindustan Times)Part of a government-initiative just a week old, the word has spread and long queues are already beginning to form in front of mobile kiosks at various spots of the state capital. Named Annapurna Rasois, the scheme offers breakfasts at 5 rupees and meals at 8 rupees a plate.The menu offered is simple and the staple includes Besan Gatta Pulao, among other items. The kiosks parked at different locations will offer ready to eat food in 12 cities of the state.But the rush has also meant some disappointment. I wanted to have the meal but couldnt get it as the van ran out of food, lamented Ramnarain Bairwa. He has to wait his turn.Tamil NaduAmma Canteens  or Amma Unavugam in Tamil  are the best known symbols of former chief minister J Jayalalithaas largesse. But for them, we would have all starved, said Prem Ravishankar, a labourer.Much of Chennai and the state were crippled by Cyclone Vardah last week, but the 400-odd canteens meant the poor did not go hungry. Here, you can eat like a king for five bucks, grinned Ravishankar, referring to the average cost of a lunch.Amma Canteens  or Amma Unavugam in Tamil  are the best known symbols of late former chief minister J Jayalalithaas largesse. (HT Photo)The menu is uncomplicated: idli and pongal for breakfast, three varieties of pre-mixed rice dishes for lunch, and chapattis served with daal for dinner. The chapattis come for 3 rupees each with free daal.The canteens launched in 2013, and costing around Rs 300 crores every year, are hugely popular.I walk 3 km every day to have my meals here. They are a lifesaver for people like us, said Priya S, a daily wage earner.A pioneering welfare scheme, many states are now trying to emulate the Amma Canteens. A delegation from Egypt visited the state in 2014 to study the model.OdishaOdias love their dalma  a watery mixture of lentil and boiled vegetables  and the Ahaar centres serving them piping hot with rice at just 5 rupees a plate have proven to be a big draw.Though meant for the poor, the 111 centres serving lunch in all 30 districts of the state have even white-collar employees lining up before them. The rice may be a bit coarse, but the food is tasty, said Biswajit Sahoo, a corporate executive in the town of Bhadrak, who takes off his tie each time he goes to buy a token for a meal.From Balasore in the north to Malkangiri in the south, the Ahaar centres are also fodder for renewed political mudslinging. The opposition calls them a cheap gimmick, a charge rejected by the BJD of chief minister Naveen Patnaik. Its our most popular scheme, said Priyadarshi Mishra, a ruling party MLA.Andhra PradeshNTR Anna Canteens are to Andhra Pradesh what Amma Canteens are to Tamil Nadu.Launched in June, Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu christened the scheme after ex-chief minister and his father-in-law, N T Rama Rao. But the presence of Anna (big brother in Telugu) in the name suggests he too is eyeing an Amma-like status for himself.NTR Anna Canteens are already feeding hundreds of government employees who have recently relocated from Hyderabad to the states new capital Amaravati. The quality is good, though the taste could have been better, said Krishnaveni, a secretariat employee.Read | Inspired by Amma, Naidu launches Anna NTR canteens in AndhraTelanganaMeals for 5 rupees are available at 50 kiosks in Hyderabad since 2014. At present, they feed to 15,000 people daily and the subsidy per plate works out to 15 rupees, said Hyderabad Mayor Bonthu Rammohan Rao.The meal of rice, sambar and pickle is frugal, but the dividend, apparently, rich. The ruling Telangana Rashtra Samithis convincing victory in the municipal polls earlier this year, when it won 100 of the 150 seats, is credited to the subsidised meal scheme. It is, therefore, not surprising that the government is planning to start 100 more canteens in the next year.Hyderabad residents with a Rs 5 meal, a scheme being implemented by Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation. (HT Photo)But government staff is not exactly complaining. Yet to be built, Amaravati is still a cluster of villages and the canteens offer them a change of taste and cheap food. Breakfasts cost five rupees while lunch prices vary from 6.50 to 7.50 rupees.Government subsidy per plate comes to 40 rupees. It is , however, going ahead with plans to set up 35 such canteens in Guntur, Visakhapatnam, Tirupati and Anantapur.JharkhandThough not as well known as Tamil Nadus Amma Canteens, Jharkhands Mukhyamantri Dal Bhat Yojana (chief ministers dal rice scheme) has by far been the oldest of soup kitchens run in the country.Former chief minister Arjun Munda started 370 centres in 2011 to feed the poor in the drought-hit state. They mostly closed down some years later for want of money, but the government relaunched them in January this year.The food is cheap plus less oily, said Sunita Kumari, a middle-aged woman savouring a meal at the centre near a prominent Ranchi hospital. Around 22.5 lakh people are being fed and the government spends Rs 25 crore annually.Madhya PradeshChief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan is planning to launch his own version of subsidised canteens next year. Chouhan said healthy meals would be sold for Rs 5 under what is to be called Deendayal Kitchens."
