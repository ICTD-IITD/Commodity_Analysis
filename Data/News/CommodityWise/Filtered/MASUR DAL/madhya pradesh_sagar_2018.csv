We will force those in power to bow down. Well shake things up. Well unseat them.Madhya Pradesh  which promotes itself as the heart of India and is home to the Pench national park, the setting of Rudyard Kiplings Jungle Book  has seen some stupendous farm growth rates. But the states image of being a hub of rural prosperity fell apart in June 2017, when the central city of Mandsaur became the flashpoint of violent protests.Angry over falling prices of their produce, farmers announced a 10-day siege in cities such as Sehore, Bhopal and Indore. Five farmers of the Patidar caste, the community behind the campaign against the BJP government in Gujarat, died in police firing in Mandsaur, a wealthy belt that grows legally-sanctioned opium, wheat, soyabean, oilseeds and lentils.A rough patch in Indias agriculture has thrust the rural economy and farmers issue on to the political centre stage, posing a key political risk in BJP-ruled states. Three of them  Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh  will face elections this year.Agrarian distress was responsible for the BJPs diminished rural tally in the Gujarat elections last month. With farm issues back on the national radar, the BJP is watching out for the possibility of rural dissatisfaction-fuelled anti-incumbency shaking its formidable rural-support base.Nearly 72.4% of Madhya Pradeshs population is rural. About 49% of land-owning farmers had voted the ruling NDA in the 2014 general election, according to data from Lokniti. The BJP-led formation had also won the support of a third of landless tenant cultivators.Across states, falling rural incomes due to a combination of unfavourable global factors, bad weather and unprofitable prices has spawned a new wave of protests. There is a near consensus around two key demands. First, farmers want assured returns that are 1.5 times the cultivation costs, which translate into a 50% profit. Second, they want a complete write-off of all farmers loans. The first demand isnt hard to justify  it was, after all, part of the BJPs official poll manifesto in 2014. The Modi government has also declared that it will double farmers income in six years.One of our sister organisations in Punjab went to court seeking an implementation of this promise (50% profits). In its response in an affidavit in January 2015, the Modi government has said it was not in a position to do so. This is cheating, said Shiv Kumar Sharma alias Kakaji, one of the main leaders behind the 10-day Mandsaur agitation and the chief of Rashtriya Kisan Mazdoor Sangaha. He was arrested during the Mandsaur crackdown.Kakaji was referring to the Centres response in February 2015 to a plea filed by the Consortium of Indian Farmers Association. In it, the Centre said a mec- hanical linkage between MSP and cost of production may be counter-productive. The Centre said a 50% hike on MSP on cost may distort the market, Chengal Reddy, the petitioner, told HT. Sharmas colleague Binod Anand says the organisation has set February 1 as the deadli- ne for the government to meet its dem- ands. The next stop: a protest in Delhis Jantar Mantar on February 23, he says.Madhya Pradeshs farm fortunes began dipping in 2013-14, when farm GDP contracted 1.14% due to a drought. The next year, farm growth rose 4.6% but slowed again to 1.7% in 2015-16. In 2016-17, growth shot up 22.39%, the result of a statistical base effect due to poor growth the previous years and a bumper harvest. However, disruptions caused by demonetisation and the implementation of the goods and services tax meant prices crashed.The state is looking to stem rural angst with a slew of sops. This includes an unprecedented flagship scheme, Mukhya Mantri Bhavantar Bhugtaan Yojana, to directly pay farmers a part of the prices they fail to recover for their produce from the markets, something never tried before in the country. But farmer organisations have made it the main target of their attacks.The scheme pays only the difference between the prevailing modal price of a crop and what farmers manage to sell for. The modal price of a crop denotes the price level at which a majority of transactions take place. It therefore serves as an average price. It doesnt pay the higher minimum support prices, or the floor price, set by the Centre. Farm leaders allege the scheme benefits traders more than farmers. Farmers organisations that came together in the aftermath of the Mandsaur protests are preparing for a fresh spell of agitation in the year ahead. Sinha, a detractor of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has promised his support and time to them.The Gadarwara rally attended by Sinha and former Union farm minister Sompal Shastri, who doesnt belong to any party now, was called to highlight the plight of farmers nearby whose land was acquired for a power plant.New-age tacticsThe issues may be rooted in agricultural prices but the battle in Madhya Pradesh is a political one. Anand claims they arent fighting on partisan lines and its difficult to predict what political impact their movement will have in Madhya Pradeshs elections. But leaders of many political parties are in touch with us, he admitted.The Harda-based Aam Kisan Unio is however open about bringing about a regime change if the current government doesnt accept its demand.One of its leaders, Kedar Shankar Sirohi, is a social-media savvy activist who has a Bachelors degree in agriculture and a Masters in agricultural economics. Sirohi says he founded his organisation in 2011 to create an independent, apolitical farmers union as some of the bigger farmer groups were directly affiliated to either the Congress or the BJP.We are non-party but we are not non-political, Sirohi, a farmer who grows wheat and soyabean, in his Harda farm says. Asked to explain his intriguing comment, Sirohi says farmers issues need political solutions. In this new-age farmer mobilisation, social media is a handy tool.When the Mandsaur agitation happened, Sirohi says, the chief minister (Shivraj Singh Chouhan) pointed to jeans-clad protesters to say they werent real farmers. He doesnt know how young farmers look. Today, farmers have one hand on their steering wheel and the other on the mobile (phone).Catchy sloganeering on Facebook and WhatsApp is drafting support. Those who live by the sword die by it. This is a government of slogans and social media, and we will discredit it through social media and slogans, Sirohi says.The Aam Kisan Union has attacked the Bhavantar price-deficit payment scheme as byapariyon ka poshan, kisano ka soshan or nourishment for traders, exploitation of farmers. Our slogan is catchier, laughs Bhopal-based Irfan Jafri, a farm leader who runs the Kisan Jagriti Sangathan. We are calling the scheme election ka collection.Sirohi says joblessness among educated children of farmers has become a major social anxiety. Its delaying marriages, he says. I am a farmer, but our children dont want to do farming. This election could be worse than Gujarat for the BJP, says Anand Bajaj, a well-off farmer from Devas.Sirohi and his colleagues have started an online campaign, asking farmers to stop making loan repayments. They are calling it a non-cooperation movement. Every farmer who enrols has to display a slogan on his house walls, pledging his support. Jafri has posted a picture on WhatsApp of 30-year-old Chain Singh Lodhi from Raisen districts Jamunia village standing next to his house with a pledge written in bold, blue paint that has been widely forwarded.The farmers seem confident about their political strategy. Sirohi says concentrating on electoral seats where the BJP is entrenched would be a waste of time. Of the 230 seats, the BJP wins by a small margin is about 60-70 seats. Thats where we will put up our fight."

5b1632fc9855b72e9ad6d63c,Shivraj Singh Chouhan’s agri sops to dent state’s finances badly,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/cms-agri-sops-to-dent-states-finances-badly/articleshow/62892351.cms,2018-02-13,"BHOPAL: Good politics does not necessarily make good economics. This adage fits perfectly on Madhya Pradesh government, that is staring at assembly general elections later this year and mounting anger from the farmers.Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhans sops on Monday for the farmers announced at a Kisan Mahasammelan has burdened the cash-strapped state, further.If sources from the MP finance department are to be believed, the government would need at least Rs 10,000 crore to meet its commitment made to the farmers.To give a boost to the income of farmers, the state would need about Rs 10,000 crore. And around Rs 5,000 crore in the next two months for effective implementation of the scheme, state finance department sources said.Sources further said that Rs 1,340 crore would be required to pay Rs 200 bonus per quintal on the MSP of 67 lakh metric tonne wheat procured from the farmers in 2016-17 while another Rs 340 crore would go to paddy farmers for 17 lakh metric tonnes of produce as bonus. Another Rs 1,700 core for chana, masoor and mustard farmers and Rs 500 crore for onion.Besides, there are the other announcements like making Chambal ravines suitable for farming and expenses on storing produce in ware houses, said the sources.And where would the money come from for government? The CM too did not divulge the details?The government has done all its calculations. Chouhan may earmark some funds in the budget to be presented later this month. The money may also be arranged after slashing down budgetary provisions of different departments. If the CMs plan is executed, MP might not see any new development works in 2018-19, top sources said seeking anonymity.After having made the announcement, the chief minister was elated, mainly due to the positive response from the farmers, who have been expecting fair deal from him on their produce. The chief minister was seen returning to the dais thrice to repeat his announcements, and extending the Shivratri greeting to the eagerly waiting farmers.Sources said the governments main concern is small and marginal farmers, who often tend to work as agricultural labourers and have not seen a significant rise in their incomes, despite an impressive agriculture growth in agriculture reported by the state over the years. Though MPs farm performance look impressive, the distribution of gains are not reflected in their income. For the rabi 2018, the MSP and bonus announcements will be done after the produce is procured, sources said.Minister for agriculture Gaurishankar Bisen said, For farmers, there is no dearth of funds with the government. The government is committed to fulfil its promises.However, the farmers leaders are still not happy.National president of Rashtriya Kisan Mazdoor Sangh Shivkumar Sharma alias Kakkaji said, This is another stunt in an election year. We will take out a yatra to tell farmers not to be misled by the announcements."

It will also help in making the farmers aware of the multiple ways in which they are looted, check what really happens in the agriculture markets and whether they really get the MSP being assured by the Central government.This is a truth mission on the lines of the spirit of Gandhian Satyagraha and we invite everyone to participate to find out the MSP reality, he said.Arguing that MSP is the solemn guarantee by the government to the farmers to ensure a floor price, Mr. Yadav pointed out the reality is that the farmer is forced to sell for much less  Bengal gram (chana) selling for Rs. 800 to Rs. 1000 less than MSP of Rs. 4,400, lentils at Rs. 3,200-Rs. 3,800 as against Rs. 4,250, rapeseed at Rs. 3,500 as against Rs. 4,000, etc. He contested the governments claims of ensuring income of 1/1.5 times the production cost.Prof. M. Kodandaram, whose TJAC is among the several organisations supporting the programme, demanded fair MSP for all crops and alleged that the infrastructure facilities at markets are inadequate with middlemen and traders ruling the roost.Even in recent red gram procurement by Markfed, the farmers arrears were to the tune of Rs. 220 crore."

Madhya Pradesh has recorded bumper production of gram, lentil and mustard and farmers will get justified price of their produce under MSP, the CM said.Chouhan did not clarify why the government took this decision at time when the Centre has welcomed Bhavantar and has formed a group of ministers to study the scheme in the interest of farm community across the country.Chouhan simply said that the central committee has not taken a stand, hencethedecision by thestate. Bhavantar scheme has got very positive response, and a group of ministers under the chairmanship of home minister Rajnath Singh is studying it, but a decision in the regard is yetto arrive, theCMsaid, assuring that the MP government will help farmers during all adversities.After the announcement, the state government has asked farmers register for MSP. Those who have registered for Bhavantar will get the benefit, too.Officials said the decision to exclude these three crops from Bhavantar was taken after the Centre announced benefits under the scheme for Kharif crops. The Centre is yet to decide whether to include Rabi crops, barring wheat and paddy, under Bhavantar. As per the formula, the Centre will have to bear expensesof Rs12,000crore under Bhavantar and after thorough discussion, Delhi will take the decision to include gram, lentil and mustard under Bhavantar, said Rajesh Rajora, principal secretary of agriculture department.Chouhan is hopeful that Bhavantar will get countrywide acceptance after the Centres approval. On Sunday, I will address farmers of MP and inform them about government welfare schemes. Niti Ayog is also working on Bhavantar and we are hopeful that farmers will soon get an appropriate plan to help them financially, said Chouhan."

The Rajasthan government, however, is purchasing wheat at MSP of 1,735 for every quintal fixed by the Centre.Madhya Pradesh has announced a special incentive of 100 every quintal for chana, masoor and mustard in the 2018 rabi marketing season.According to an official order issued by the Madhya Pradesh government, wheat and other crops, including chana, mustard and masoor, will be eligible for the cash incentive irrespective of the rate at which it is sold in the market.The state hasnt termed the scheme as a bonus to circumvent a central order that curbs state governments from declaring a bonus over the MSP.Upset at lower prices prevailing in Rajasthan, farmers in Kota division are planning a jail bharo andolan on April 12, to protest against what they call lower MSP and inadequate arrangements for purchase of wheat and other rabi crops at the mandis.At most mandis, farmers are being forced to sell wheat at 1,500 every quintal. Farmers are also getting lower prices for chana, which is being sold at about 1,000 every quintal lesser than the MSP, said Akhil Bharatiya Kisan Sangarhsh Samiti convener Fatehchand Bagla.We will stage protest at the Kota collectorate on Thursday and also court arrest, he said.Kisan Mahapanchayat president Rampal Jat said since Madhya Pradesh was a neighbouring state it was natural that farmers in Rajasthan will expect similar prices. When MP government can purchase wheat at 2,000 per quintal, there is no reason why the Rajasthan government cannot do the same, he said.State agriculture minister Prabhulal Saini said MSP was fixed by the Centre and the new norms prohibit declaring a bonus over and above the MSP.In Rajasthan, the Food Corporation of India is purchasing wheat at 207 designated centres at 1,735 every quintal. Rajasthan is the fifth largest wheat producer in the country.Rajasthan, which goes to the polls in the next few months, has faced a series of farmers agitations in the past one year due to crash in prices and crop damage.Chief minister Vasundhara Raje in her last budget before the elections announced a farm loan waiver of up to 50,000 for small and marginal farmers that will cost the state exchequer more than 8,000 crore.Besides, the farm loan waiver, the state government has constituted a permanent farm commission and has allocated 5,000 crore interest-free loans to the Rajasthan State Co-operative Marketing Federation for procuring mustard and gram."

The district administration, however, denied that the farmer had waited for three days.Omprakash Patidar, 34, a resident of Boda village in Rajgarh district, died at the Narsinghgarh Mandi around 5pm, according to fellow farmers. His death came five days after another farmer Moolchand Meena, 65, allegedly died under similar circumstances at Lateri Mandi in Vidisha district.Omprakashs death triggered protests near the Narsinghgarh Mandi in Rajgarh district, about 140 km northwest of state capital Bhopal. Farmers staged a protest and also blocked National Highway-12 passing through the town.The agitating farmers alleged that the Rajgarh district administration had made no arrangements for them to beat the scorching heat while waiting to sell their produce.The process is too slow and we have been waiting in a queue for the last three days. There is no drinking water for us either, said farmer Ramkishan Singh.The farmers lifted the highway blockade after the district administration assured it would increase the number of weighing machines, arrange drinking water and provide other facilities.The deceaseds brother Peru Patidar, who was with him when he died, declined to say anything. Fellow farmers said the Patidars produce was masoor dal (red lentils).Rajgarh collector Karamveer Sharma said rumours spread by anti-social elements misled the farmers. It was Peru Patidar who was waiting for his turn at the mandi. Omprakash Patidar came to the mandi in the afternoon only to give his brother food.Sharma added, Weighing of the agriculture produce at the mandi was over for the day at 3.30pm, whereas Omprakash Patidar died at 5pm. He was having his food in the mandis canteen when he collapsed. He was rushed to a nearby hospital, where a doctor declared him dead. In the preliminary post-mortem report, it was found that he died of cardiac arrest."

(Express file photo) Wheat growers have been promised Rs 265 over and above the MSP of Rs 1,735 per quintal. (Express file photo)Frustrated by the long wait to sell his produce of chana, a farmer stormed into the mandi office here last week and threatened: If I am not able to sell my crop on Monday, I will set it afire here. The threat, which came against the backdrop of a farmers death at the mandi as he waited to sell his produce, jolted the officials into action. They had a tough time pacifying the farmer.With hundreds of farmers waiting outside mandis in temperatures above 40 degree Celsius to sell their produce of chana, lentil and mustard to the government, scenes like these are becoming common across Madhya Pradesh. Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan on Thursday asked Collectors to take steps to reduce delays at mandis. The Collectors have been told to ensure that limited number of farmers are called to the mandis so that there are no queues. BJPs Kisan Morcha on Thursday asked its members to reach mandis and offer cold drinking water to the waiting farmers from May 25 to June 15.ALSO READ | High procurement of crop means little to farmers: Yogendra YadavThe BJP governments direction came a day after the Congress asked its workers to reach mandis and procurement centres and interact with farmers. Alleging that farmers are dying in the state due to firing, high debts, farm losses and now waiting to sell their crops, state Congress chief Kamal Nath has said the state government claims to be pro-farmer but they are the ones to suffer the most.The long queues at mandis and procurement centres follow the governments decision to buy wheat, gram, mustard and lentil directly from the farmers. The procurement of wheat began on March 15 and will continue till May 26 while purchase of chana, mustard and lentil began on April 10 and will continue till June 9. As of Thursday, the state government has procured 9.79 lakh MT chana, the highest ever in the country, and 70.58 lakh MT wheat.Wheat growers have been promised Rs 265 over and above the MSP of Rs 1,735 per quintal. The MSPs for chana, mustard and lentil are Rs 4,400, Rs 4,250 and Rs 4,000, respectively. Shortage of weighing machines and porters is aggravating the situation because only a limited number of trolleys can be weighed at the smaller mandis like the one at Lateri.Most mandis are not equipped with a weighbridge that can quickly weigh a loaded and unloaded trolley to determine the produce. The current process involves emptying a trolley on ground, distributing the content in sacks, weighing them and sealing them. It takes up to 80 minutes to weigh a 40-quintal trolley. After the death of the farmer last week, the Lateri Mandi increased the number of weighing scales but they are still proving inadequate to cater to the rush.Lateri, one of the smaller mandis, caters to 10,000 farmers living in a radius of 35 km. Once the farmers reach the mandi, before their turn or after, they dont go back home so that they save on diesel or rent of tractor-trolleys. Also, they have no option but to sell to the government because traders are offering much less. The farmers, however, said that if they sell to traders, they get the money immediately, but the proceeds from selling to the government is deposited after some days.We are angry with the government. We need money on time. No point getting something extra when the need is over, said Babu Khan, a farmer from Lateri, when asked about the extra money he will get by selling his produce to the government. Mandi officials, on the other hand, said the farmers either come before the due date or later and insist on selling their produce immediately. Even when they are told to go home and come at a later scheduled date, they dont go. This makes things unmanageable, said mandi official Vishwanath Dhamde.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

(Express Photo by Deepak Daware) Farmers sell their harvest at the Agriculture Produce Market Committee mandi at Amravati, Maharashtra. (Express Photo by Deepak Daware)When in mid-December, Anand Pawar decided to register the standing tur (pigeon-pea) on 10 out of his 50-acre holding with the Maharashtra State Cooperative Marketing Federations purchase centre at Latur, he was quite hopeful of realising the governments minimum support price (MSP) of Rs 5,450 per quintal for the soon-to-be-harvested crop. At the time of registration, this farmer from Harangul Khurd village of Latur taluka was even promised he would soon receive an SMS, specifying the date and time for him to proceed to make the sale at the centre.The SMS never came and, more than five months later, Pawar is still stuck with the 65 quintals of tur he harvested in mid-January. And he deeply regrets not having sold his crop then at the prevailing market rate of Rs 4,200-4,250 per quintal. Tur is currently trading in the Latur market yard at Rs 3,550-3,600 per quintal. Why promise something you did not intend to deliver? What option do I have other than sell at todays going price? I need the money for my next crop, with the monsoon rains just 2-3 weeks away, says Pawar, whose sole consolation is from the soyabean on his balance 40 acres. While it also sold initially below the MSP of Rs 3,050 per quintal  at Rs 2,550-2,600 in November and Rs 2,800-2,900 in December  prices rose significantly thereafter. Pawar could fetch Rs 3,800-3,900 per quintal for his last lot of soyabean sold in early-April.Pawar is a relatively better-off farmer, who was able to make some money by not selling his entire soyabean crop during the peak marketing season of November-December. But 2017-18 has been an unmitigated disaster even for him, when it comes to pulses. For growers of tur, urad (black gram), moong (green gram), chana (chickpea) and masur (lentil), this is a year they would simply not want to remember.ALSO READ | Does growth in pulses output mean India has reached self-sufficiency?The curse of low realisations for farmers  ironically, in a crop where India has been perpetually import-dependent  comes despite government agencies undertaking record procurement during the last two years. In the 2015-16 crop year (July-June), a mere 1.19 lakh tonnes (lt) of pulses were procured under the Price Stabilisation Fund set up by the Narendra Modi government: 50,422.53 tonnes during kharif and 69,049.08 tonnes in the rabi marketing season. In 2016-17, procurement by the National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation (NAFED), Food Corporation of India and Small Farmers Agribusiness Consortium rose over 13 times to 15.62 lt. That included 14.74 lt of kharif pulses (11.66 lt tur, 2.20 lt moong and 0.89 lt urad) and 0.87 lt of rabi pulses (0.60 lt chana and 0.27 lt masur).In the current year, procurement, which is ongoing, is set to further double. NAFED, the only government agency now procuring under the so-called Price Support Scheme (PSS), has till now bought 14.59 lt of chana, 8.58 lt of tur, 2.95 lt of moong, 2.03 lt of urad and 1.36 lt of masoor. That adds up to around 29.50 lt. The final figure could well cross 30 lt  unprecedented as far as pulses go.But unlike for wheat and paddy  for which there are established systems that have stood the test of time  the actual process of procurement has been far from smooth in the case of pulses. Under PSS, the MSP-based procurement is done by state marketing federations that are sub-agents of NAFED. In states such as Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra, farmers wanting to sell are required to register themselves first at the procurement centres of their areas. As part of this process, they have to mention the area planted under a particular crop, while providing proof of land ownership (copy of 7/12 revenue extract) and also their Aadhaar identification and bank account numbers. Once registration happens, the farmers are supposed to get an SMS intimation of the date for bringing their produce, the idea being to avoid overcrowding at the procurement centres. Payments, too, are to be credited directly into their bank accounts within 48 hours of the sale taking place.However, things havent quite worked that way on the ground.ALSO READ | Breeding challenges: Hybrid rice clicks better in poor than agriculturally prosperous statesIn MP, farmers have had to wait in long queues at the mandis for selling their chana and masur at the governments MSPs. There have even been reports of a couple of farmers dying after standing for hours in the searing summer heat. The situation has been rendered worse by the shortage of weighing machines and porters, especially in the smaller mandis. Notwithstanding all this, government agencies, as on May 22, had managed to procure 9.10 lt of chana from MP (worth Rs 4,003.96 crore at the MSP of Rs 4,400 per quintal) and another 2.67 lt (Rs 1,174.99 crore) from Rajasthan. The agencies also bought 1.34 lt of masur from MP, whose MSP value was Rs 571.23 crore. Both MP and Rajasthan are, incidentally, headed for state assembly polls in November-December this year.In Maharashtra, many farmers registered their crop at government purchase centres, but could not sell a single quintal at the MSP. Pawar sought to sell, apart from his 65 quintals of tur, also 25 quintals of chana grown on five acres this rabi season. I went to the centre on Monday to make a final enquiry on whether at least my chana would be procured. But the officials could not give any definite date. How does this government really expect our incomes to double?, he asks sarcastically.Government agencies procured 4.01 lt of tur from Maharashtra is the 2016-17 kharif marketing season. This time, they purchased another 3.25 lt, worth Rs 1,770.84 crore at the MSP, but farmers havent received even half of this amount so far (when they were supposed to get paid within 48 hours). The reason for it is that the procured produce has not been moved from the centres to the designated godowns. NAFED will not realise the payments without that. But the produce cannot be moved, as there is no space in the godowns, which are full with the unsold tur and chana of last year, admits a Maharashtra government official.With the new planting season about to start, NAFED is desperately issuing tenders for offloading its inventories. Total unsold stocks of pulses in government godowns, from two years of record procurement, are estimated at more than 40 lt. These stocks  on top of continuing imports  will exert further pressure on prices when the next crop arrives from September. The only thing that can prevent such an eventuality is drought. That, again, isnt going to help farmers.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

The minimum support price for paddy has been hiked by Rs 200, or about 13 per cent, and the rest by up to 50 per cent. The decision, taken by the Union Cabinet headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, comes less than a year before next general elections.Also, by the end of this year, assembly elections will be held in three BJP-ruled states - Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh - where farmers, already restive, form a chunk of the populationThe delay in implementation of a big hike in support prices -- one of the pre-election promises of the BJP -- has triggered huge protests by farmers in many parts of the country.. They also had the support of the opposition, which has highlighted farmers' suicides to accuse the government of being insensitive to farmers' demands. While the move is expected to boost the rural economy, there are concerns that it could translate into food inflation.Called it a ""historic decision"" by the NDA government, Home Minister Rajnath Singh said, ""Farmers are the largest producer, consumer and customer in this country but they never got the price they deserved for their produce. Modi ji understood this and now farmers will get 1.5 times more MSP on their produce.""PM Modi, who has promised to increase farm incomes, tweeted:        -      1.5  MSP      ,                      -   - Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) July 4, 2018The MSP is like a shock absorber by the government to safeguard farmers against any sudden fall in produce prices. The MSP is a guaranteed price for their produce. In February, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley while presenting his fourth budget in the Modi government, promised to set MSP at 1.5 times the cost of production.The government was regularly attacked by farmer associations and the opposition for making ""hollow promises"" about doubling their income by 2022.Congress President Rahul Gandhi had accused the prime minister of ""finishing the farmer"". He said, ""The government has to help the farmer. How will that happen? Through MSP and loan waivers. In the absence of such measures, small farmers are unable to make any money.""Last year saw massive protests by farmer associations across the country over MSP and loan waivers. It started last summer in Madhya Pradesh, where six farmers were killed in police firing, and spread to other states where farmers destroyed fresh produce in symbolic protest. In March, it took shape of the colossal Kisan Long March in Maharashtra, in which around 50,000 farmers walked 180 km from Nasik to Mumbai.Last month, farmers across the country held a 10-day ""Gaon Bandh"", during which thousands refused to send supply of fruits, vegetables and dairy products to cities.According to the list, the MSP of common grade paddy has been fixed at Rs 1,750 per quintal. The MSP for top variety cotton will be Rs 5,450, up from 4,320 per quintal. The price for two varieties of pulses -- urad (lentil) and tur -- will see a revision of about Rs 200 per quintal."

The Mandsaur police firing that killed five farmers will be reinvestigated if Congress comes to power, it says.For the first time, Congress promises to launch a Ram Van Gaman Path tour to retrace Lord Ram's footprints in MP, pass a law to protect River Narmada and set up a new 'religion and spiritual department'. It also aims to begin commercial production of cow urine and cowdung cakes. Unlike Chhattisgarh, it hasn't called for prohibition but vows to rid MP of 'intoxicants'.To address upper-caste resentment after amendment of the SC/ST Atrocities (Prevention) Act, the Congress Vachan Patra promises a Samanya Varg Ayog or Commission for general categories to address their issues.The manifesto was released at the state Congress headquarters here on Saturday morning by PCC chief Kamal Nath, state election campaign chairman Jyotiraditya Scindia, former CM Digvijaya Singh, Leader of Opposition Ajay Singh, and former Union ministers Suresh Pachauri and Arun Yadav. Chairman of the manifesto committee Rajendra Singh was also on dais.Congress described it as the voice of people of Madhya Pradesh. There is something for just about everyone  daily wagers, jobless, industrialists, homemakers and even journalists (a law to protect mediapersons), but the focus is clearly on farms and job creation.Kamal Nath told reporters, Congress is not releasing a manifesto for the people of the state. Rather, this is our pledge to bring Madhya Pradesh back on the tracks of development so that farmers can smile, women will feel protected and youth can get employment. In the last 15 years, BJP presented only jumla patras (propaganda deeds) in the name of manifesto and deceived people. Congress is determined to end corruption and mafia rule which starts from villages.Scindia called it a a new morning after 15 years of darkness for farmers, women and youth. Congress has presented its resolution, not just a manifesto, out of the willingness to serve. We have promised progress and development, plus reduction in price of petrol and diesel, justice for slain farmers of Mandsaur and distribution of free laptops to meritorious students in every district. Women will be given priority during recruitment in police force. Industry will be promoted so jobs are created. And all this will be implemented with a specified time limit.Apart from agricultural loan waiver up to Rs 2 lakh, Congress promises 50% waiver on electric bills for agrarian sector, grant of Rs 51,000 for marriage of young women, and salary subsidy of Rs 10,000 to firms to encourage employment generation and investment. The manifesto assures passing a law for right to housing. Rest houses will be built every 15km along the Naramda Parikrama route.The Vachan Patra says that if Congress comes to power, it will bring transparency in recruitments and appointments and Vyapam  which has been in the eye of a storm for eight years  will be shut down. Congress alleges the BJP governments involvement in Vyapam irregularities.Congress manifesto promises more than the BJP governments policies at the Centre and state. While chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan promised bonus on grains like wheat and dal, Congress promises to give bonus to farmers on practically every major crop grown in the state  wheat, paddy, jowar, bajra, corn, soybean, mustard, cotton, arhar, moong, gram and masoor, urad, garlic, onions, tomatoes and sugarcane. The Narendra Modi government in Delhi gave LPG connections to the poor through Ujjwala Yojana, and Congress promises Rs 100 subsidy per cylinder.

Respite for one would come only at the cost of the other ones interest.Poor rains are expected to increase the rates of pulses. But the higher rates may help in easing farmers losses. Traders fear the rates may still be reigned in if the government, which is sitting on a huge stock of pulses procured in previous years, begins offloading it. A sudden increase in supply due to it will offset the shortfall due to less output.Rates of pulses had touched a rock bottom due to a bumper crop in the last two years. This led to large-scale purchases at minimum support price (MSP) by the National Agriculture Cooperative Marketing Federation of India (NAFED).This year a poor crop of pulses both in kharif and rabi seasons is estimate and it has already led to a bullish trend. Yet the prices are either below the MSP or barely above, so far. The rates need to increase further for farmers to profit, said a traderArrival of pulses would begin with tur in January which is a kharif crop. There are market estimates of at least 30% downfall in output of tur.Tur in raw form is available for Rs4,400 to Rs4,800 a quintal, an increase of over Rs500 within two months. This is still below the MSP which is at Rs5450. Raw tur is further processed into tur dal and is sold for between Rs60 and Rs70 a kg in bulk markets, said market sources.Pulses like chana (gram) and masoor (lentil), which are rabi crops, reach the market by March. Rates of chana have jumped by Rs1,200 a quintal in two months and touched Rs4500 to Rs4700 a quintal. The MSP, on the other hand, is at Rs4,620 a quintal. Chana dal, made out of chana, is in the range of Rs60 to 65 a kg.Both tur dal and chana dal had made headlines in 2014 when the rates had touched Rs200 and Rs120 a kg, respectively.Masoor is priced at Rs4,300 a quintal in raw form, still below the MPS by Rs150. Masoor dal costs up to Rs48 a kg, said sources in local market.Traders say even as there is a bullish outlook considering the shortfall, uncertainty remains.Meanwhile, farmers in Vidarbha, who mainly grow gram, are facing a tough rabi season. According to a senior officer in states agriculture department, rabi production is expected to be down by 30% in Amravati division which covers west Vidarbha. There is an equal downfall in the sowing as well.Chana, which is the main rabi crop of the region, has been affected. In east Vidarbha, estimates have not been made yet as sowing is still in progress, said a source.Amid fears that NAFEDs sale may keep the price low, its managing director Sanjeev Kumar Chaddha told TOI that the agency is left with over 5 lakh tons of tur. There are no plans to sell it in the open market. After setting aside the required quantity for buffer stock, the pulses may be supplied through the public distribution system, he said.On chana, Chaddha said, NAFED is left with 23 lakh tons of it. It would be sold from time to time in open market as well as PDS. The measures would be calibrated and it would be seen that supply by NAFED does not lead to a crash in prices.The rates have barely improved and there was a petition in the high court seeking the government should take steps for price control. Tur, which is among the major pulses, is still ruling below the MSP. If NAFED offloads the stock the farmers would be at a loss, said Pratap Motwani, secretary of Itwari Grain and Seeds Merchants AssociationArpit Jain of Himalaya Agro Impex said it may be too early to predict the trend. There is a bullish outlook at present. The rates of chana jumped by over Rs1,000 two months ago after that there has been no movement. Maharashtra stands third in chana production after Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh. Recently there have been showers in some of the pockets which can improve the output. There is enough stock with government which if offloaded can ease the rates, he said."
