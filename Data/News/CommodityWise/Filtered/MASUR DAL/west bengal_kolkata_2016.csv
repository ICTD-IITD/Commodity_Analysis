A retired steel plant superintendent, Das has been a walker for almost all his life, but this is his first attempt at a marathon.Every day, for the past two months, he has been running a distance of 21 km in preparation for the marathon. While no other member in his family is part of Sunday's event, they will certainly cheer for him when he crosses the finish line.""Apart from a sugar problem, I don't suffer from any ailment. Regular walking and jogging keeps me in good shape,"" he said.As a senior superintendent at Durgapur Steel Plant in West Bengal, Das, a sports enthusiast, dabbled in football and badminton. ""Even though it has been years since I retired, I keep myself active. I moved to Navi Mumbai seven years ago. The wide open roads here are ideal to stay in shape. My family, especially my wife Ritka, has been supportive of my mission,"" he said.One of the reasons he is able to run at this age is the strict diet regime that he follows. Sangita, his daughter, said he ate within limits and his diet included dry fruits, typical Bengali meals of rice, lentils, vegetables, fish and curd and an occasional dry snack.""I make sure I get proper sleep. I sleep reasonably early since I wake at 5.40am. Then from 6.15am to 9.15am, I jog on the streets,"" he laughed and said.Keeping his body in good shape is not his only mission. His mind, too, needs to stay sharp. Apart from being an avid news watcher, he tutors his grandchildren.""This way my father stays abreast of what is happening around and his mind stays focused,"" added Sangita.His son-in-law, Subhendu, recalls the time Das climbed 17 floors to their residence when the lift was out of order. ""Even younger people struggle to climb so many floors. But he managed it easily,"" said Subhendu.Thrilled to be part of Sunday's marathon, Das can't curtail his excitement. ""This is the first time I am taking part in the marathon and I am so happy to be a part of it,"" he said."
58f9936aa3d24b0b70c40a99,India-Bangladesh feeder service begins,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/indiabangladesh-feeder-service-begins/article8394703.ece,2016-03-25,"The maiden coastal feeder service between India and Bangladesh commenced on March 23, after facing a minor hitch, at Chittagong Port in Bangladesh.As per the schedule, m.v. Harbour-1, the container vessel owned by Neepa Paribahan, was to arrive at Krishnapatnam Port in Andhra Pradesh on March 26. However, it failed to depart from Chittagong Port on March 17 due to lack of adequate number of containers and a crane fault.Maiden journeyIn its maiden journey, the vessel was to carry 150 empty containers. Due to the crane fault, only 30 containers were loaded on to the vessel since March 17, trade sources said.When contacted, Krishnapatnam Port officials said they had received confirmation that the vessel would reach the port by early next week.India and Bangladesh signed a coastal shipping deal during November 2015 to promote coastal shipping, enhance bilateral trade between the two countries and bring down transportation costs for EXIM cargo. Bangladesh imports onion, rice, lentils, cotton, industrial raw materials and machinery.As per the deal, the vessel would call at the ports of Kolkata, Haldia, Paradip, Visakhapatnam, Kakinada, Krishnapatnam and Chennai, while in Bangladesh it would be at Chittagong, Pangaon ICT, Narayanganj, Ashuganj, Payra, Khulna and Mongla. The vessels first call would be at Krishnapatnam Port.CongestionCurrently, container goods are moved from and to Bangladesh either through Colombo or Singapore as Chittagong Port does not have a deep draft and hence smaller feeder vessels are deployed. Besides, rapid growth in bilateral trade between India and Bangladesh led to congestion on the road at Indo-Bangladesh border. Hence, the importers and exporters urged introduction of feeder service between India and Bangladesh, said trade sources.Out of a total of 1.8 million tonnes of cargo moved on Indo-Bangladesh protocol route during 2013-14, fly ash accounted for 98 per cent, which was transported from Kolkata to various river ports in Bangladesh. During the current year, India for the first time used the Indo-Bangladesh river protocol to transport food grains via Ashuganj to Tripura. However, the quantum of cargo has not picked up because of low draft in the upper reaches of Bangladesh rivers and also because of certain non-trade barriers, says a Shipping Ministry release."
5923306e7be9e01fd59ad0d3,Why drought isn’t grabbing the headlines,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/marathwada-maharashtra-farmer-suicide-why-drought-isnt-grabbing-the-headlines/,2016-03-31,"Drought, in a sense, has only added to the miseries of rural producers who are simultaneously battling the effects of a global commodity crash which has hit agricultural exports and farm prices. Drought, in a sense, has only added to the miseries of rural producers who are simultaneously battling the effects of a global commodity crash which has hit agricultural exports and farm prices.This time it has been a most unusual drought. Even with three consecutive bad crops (kharif 2014, rabi 2015, kharif 2015) and a fourth not-so-great one (thankfully, theres been no big damage from unseasonal rains/hail unlike in March 2015), the annual consumer food price inflation is only 5.3 per cent.In the past, droughts invariably fuelled speculation and hoarding by unscrupulous traders. This time were hardly feeling it in the cities. Barring sugar, where the price increase in recent weeks is more of a correction from unhealthy lows, consumers arent paying all that more for what they are eating compared to a year ago. No ones talking much about onion prices, either. Even arhar dal is selling cheaper than when it consumed the BJP in Bihars assembly elections during October-November; the same goes for urad, moong or masur.Simply put, this is a drought essentially of farmers and rural producers. And since it isnt really pinching urban consumers, politicians even in Maharashtra  where the drought is most acute  have found it more important to discuss whether not chanting Bharat mata ki jai amounts to treason. Incidentally, Asaduddin Owaisis defiant speech that set off this most-important debate was made at Latur in the droughts epicenter of Marathwada!For farmers, the current crisis isnt just of production loss from drought. It is also one of low price realisations. Farmers in Maharashtra are today selling cow milk at Rs 15-16 per litre, compared to Rs 25-26 a year ago.This, despite a severe fodder shortage that would also means higher production costs. In most crops  whether cotton, rubber, basmati, guarseed or even potatoes, apples, kinnow and pineapples  producer realisations are below what they were a couple of years ago. The only reason nobodys talking about onion these days is because the bulb is being sold in Maharashtras Lasalgaon market at below Rs 7/kg, as against Rs 12 last March and Rs 45-plus in early-September when pyaaz was grabbing all the headlines.Drought, in a sense, has only added to the miseries of rural producers who are simultaneously battling the effects of a global commodity crash which has hit agricultural exports and farm prices. That, in turn, also explains why urban consumers arent particularly feeling the heat of the drought: they have been shielded mainly by low global prices. Compare this to the situation in 2007 when international prices were on the boil and we had food riots everywhere, including in places like West Bengal.Right now, the drought is not about agriculture: The current rabi crop  whatever has been planted  is close to being harvested, if it has not already. The more immediate concern, instead, is about drinking water. With two-and-a-half months to go for the monsoon to arrive in the most parched areas and the countrys major reservoirs barely 25 per cent full, meeting peak summer drinking water requirements is going to be a challenge. It will be even more in Marathwada where reservoir water levels are down to 5 per cent of full storage capacity.The one consolation we have is global climate models pointing to a weakening of El Nino, which was the main cause of the 2015 drought. The 2015-16 El Nino was one of the longest, starting around February last. It is even now in a strong phase and is expected to enter neutral zone only towards May, according to the latest forecast of the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Since there is usually a two-month or so lag between its effects translating into actual rainfall, one cannot rule out a delay in the monsoon even if turns out normal.The NOAA is also giving a 50 per cent probability of a La Nina  El Ninos opposite, which is beneficial for the Indian monsoon  developing from August. But that again would deliver good rains not earlier than in the second half of the monsoon. A delayed, but good, monsoon is what seems most likely now. And that would mean a minimum three-month wait before things finally look up.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

The fear went through the mind of hundreds of residents who live near the collapsed Vivekananda Road flyover as they rushed to the street the moment they felt a tremor on Wednesday. Some who stayed back didn't waste another moment as they felt it a second time. But reality dawned soon enough. Safety is not guaranteed as a part of the flyover is still standing ominously.The fear was palpable as dozens of autos stand right under the flyover. In case of a disaster, there is no escape route as the midpoint of the 2km road under the cursed flyover is inaccessible due to the collapse and police barricades. Panic spread as the shopkeepers abandoned store and frantically searched for an open space, but there was none to be found. The flyover runs in a handshaking distance from most of the buildings and in two cases, it passes over two second-storey balconies.""When I felt the ground shake, I immediately came downstairs. I stayed put for 5-7 minutes but thankfully, the timespan was little so eventually I gathered the courage to go back to my first floor office,"" said Manoj Agarwal, who runs a lentil business at Posta.However, for the majority, the flyover collapse returned in a flashback. The first thought was that the rest of the flyover would come down. Several autos are parked underneath it and are packed with passengers when they leave. Coolies and daily wagers sleep on the footpath at the Posta Patti. Fearing an aftershock, or worse, they evacuated the area quickly.""We felt two jolts and immediately evacuated the building. The other 20-odd residents of the building too rushed downstairs in fear. But after waiting for a while, with a prayer on the lips and sigh of relief, we returned to our flats. The flyover collapse is still fresh in our mind,"" said Deepak Mishra, a businessman who lives in 1, Sethia House with his wife and schoolgoing daughter. The building is among those marked ""dangerous and unstable"" by the Kolkata Municipal Corporation.Jitters at MetroArun Adhikary, a resident of Beadon Street, was stuck in Sovabazar Metro station when he felt the tremor. A minute later came the announcement that the services will remain suspended for 'some time' due to an earthquake. Panic-struck, his co-passengers tried to rush out of the station. There's complete chaos for 10-odd minutes and things settled down following another announcement from the Metro.""It was really scary. My two-year-old daughter was on my lap. First I thought that I would come out of the station and catch a taxi. But then came the announcement that the services would begin in 10 minutes. I heaved a sigh of relief and decided to take the next train to Esplanade,"" Adhikary said standing outside Esplanade Metro station.Anindita Mukherjee, a resident of Tollygunge, however, did not take a chance and came rushing out of Chandni Chowk station when the earthquake stuck. ""I was waiting to catch a Kavi Subhas-bound train. But the thought of catching a train after I felt the tremor in the underground was quite horrifying. I simply decided to rush out of the station, fearing aftershocks,"" Anindita said.Rajesh Das, a RPF personnel on duty at Esplanade station, had to control a mad rush of commuters fleeing to safety after repeated tremors were felt. ""I myself was also feeling extremely uncomfortable after I was convinced that it was a case of severe earthquake. But then, I found people jostling to get out of the station. I tried to make them feel comfortable by asking them to stay back,"" Das said.At 8pm, a contradictory picture was revealed at the Esplanade station. Commuters, many of them shoppers, were seen making a beeline in front of ticket counters. "" I think Metro is the safest mode of transport in such a calamity,"" said Aniruddha Sen, who had come to New Market for a last-minute shopping for Poila Baisakh."

The shutdown comes at a time when restaurants styled on The Dhaba menu are doing brisk business.Sriparna Ghosh, who lives in Ballygunge Place, received the shock of her life last week when she found the shutters down with notices that declared the closure was permanent. ""The restaurant was open till the other day and I distinctly remember all the tables were full. Though many restaurants have come up in recent years, The Dhaba at Phari has retained its popularity due to its convenient location and wholesome food at reasonable prices.

The purpose of the project is to protect indigenous art forms restricted to particular parts of India, and help in creating markets for these products.Weve identified 100 such items from all over the country and will file for the GI status on their behalf. The full process takes about two years, he said.He pointed out that the GI is different from other intellectual property rights since the tag calls for the use of local resources and looks at sustenance of people involved with the making of these items.Items on the listThe list also includes intricately woven kangri baskets from Kashmir, among others.Most food items, however, are from Bengal, including goyna bori from East Midnapore and moa from Joynagar in South 24 Parganas.While goyna bori is fritters made of ground lentils, which resembles womens jewellery (goyna), moa is a hand-rolled ball made up of puffed rice, emulsified milk and jaggery.Sarpuria from Krishnanagar along with sitabhog and mihidana from Burdwan are also on the list.While the Union government has plans to export sweets from Bengal, the GI tags for these delicacies would provide a major boost to the Centres initiative.The GI is the process of identifying an item as originating in a territory, region or locality where the quality and other characteristics are unique to the geographical area.Chakrabarti told reporters that once an item gets the GI tag, IIT-Kharagpur will fund custodians of these local art forms for the next five years to help revive these items.Brand priceThe GI products today generate a premium brand price internationally, Chakrabarti said.Elaborating, the the tech school director said, The GIs provide socio-economic value to the producers. GI rights are collective rights, which provide producers a distinct socio-economic advantage. Once they get a GI tag, it would contribute to local employment creation and sustenance of rural economy.DH News ServiceMost food items are from Bengal, including goyna bori from East Midnapore and moa from Joynagar in South 24 Parganas.

P. Chakrabarti said in the next three to five years, they will identify 100 such products all over the country and help the community get the GI tag.To begin with, the Intellectual Property Cell of the institute has recently taken up activities to facilitate the process of filing of GI for Goyna Bori, the fine art of using lentil paste mix to create exquisite designs, distinct in West Bengals Midnapore.With distinct historical basis dating back several centuries of the Rajbari and also referred by Rabindranath Tagore in his works, Goyna Bori is believed to have originated in Midnapore.Apart from being edible, Goyna Bori is actually more about unique pieces of fine art having great appeal to the eye.Besides sweets from the State, the IIT has also planned to file GI for Kangri, a basket that is traditionally used by the people of Kashmir to keep themselves warm by keeping burning charcoals in it.Patent officeWe have spoken to the patent office that as an institution we want to file GIs. The communities will get the rights. After that we will help them build an economy around it. The entire region will benefit out of this. In the past, India had to fight for intellectual property rights for turmeric. But once these communities get the GI tag they will only have the right to that brand, Dr Chakrabarti said.The IIT model will be a five-year project which will begin after the community gets the GI tag. For the first year, they will pay everything besides the labour cost and from the second year onwards the IIT will start taking back the money in a phased manner.These communities may not be prosperous as others are using the brand value of their product. We will ensure that they make good business out of it, he said, adding that for the project the IPR team will work closely with the local communities.Once the communities get the GI tag then others will not be able to sell the product by claiming it is from that particular region.The geographical indication (GI) tag identifies a product as originating from a particular location and conveys an assurance of quality and distinctiveness that is essentially attributable to the fact of its origin.Once granted, the GI tag prevents unauthorised use of the geographical indication and boosts exports by giving it a unique identity. Products like Dajeeling Tea and Mysore silk are examples of popular GI tags in India. - PTI"

Unlike harvest festivals such as Onam, Pongal, Bihu, and Baisakhi celebrated across India, Nuakhai is celebrated by offering the un-ripened grain to the presiding village deity even before any animals or birds set their eyes on it. People offer this Nabanna to the deity amidst Hulahuli, beating drums, cymbals and sounds of conch shells. It also marks the occasion for family get together and merry making, guided by elaborate set of rituals.Nuakhai is no longer a local festival anymore. People from western Orissa, staying at every major cities of India and across the globe, celebrate it with equal fervour. With a lot of fanfare and merry making Nuankhai is now being celebrated in US, Dubai, Mumbai, Kolkata, Delhi, Chennai, Bangalore and Hyderabad.

Community lunches were provided for devotees and music, drawing and fancy dress competitions were organized.At the 200-year-old Shila Mata Temple in Amber Fort, serpentine queues of devotees braved the heat for a 'darshan' of the goddess.Devotees had come from nearby cities such as Ajmer, Dausa, Dudu, Shahpura, etc. as it was a Sunday. Even though there were separate queues for men and women, many had to wait for over an hour to reach the sanctum sanctorum of the temple. ""I came from Biladi village in Dausa with my family to offer my prayers to Devi for protecting us,"" said Ram Dedhu, who was planning to visit Amber Fort after the 'darshan'.At the pandals of Bengali community, devotees dressed in traditional attire conducted 'pujas' and 'pushpanjali' for Durga early in the morning.This was followed by 'bhog' (vegetarian meal), which includes 'khichuri' (rice and lentil dish), 'labra' (assortment of vegetables) and 'payesh' (vermicelli pudding). The SDM Durga pandal at Raja Park hosted 'bhog' for over 1,500 devotees, mostly Bengalis. ""This year, all our cultural events have been carefully designed to give a strong social message. Famed Bengali singer Alok Roy Choudhary came from Kolkata to present soulful songs of Tagore which are spiritual and at the same time social in nature,"" said Manik Das Adikhari of SDM Durga pandal. The idol of the goddess was made with sand brought from Ganga river and other eco-friendly material.At Durga Bari Association (JDBA) in Bani Park, the city's oldest venue, devotees were seen throughout the day seeking the blessings of the goddess. Here, the pandal was in the shape of a corridor of a zamindar's house. ""This is a religious-cum-social gathering. We always ensure to give devotees a feel of being close to their culture,"" said Sudipto Sen, secretary of JDBA. According to organizers, over 10,000 devotees visited the pandal during the day.Traditional music groups and celebrity singers added to the festivities at several dandiya venues and puja pandals.Many temples were illuminated with colorful lights and the organizers were relieved as the predicted rains kept away. A spell of rain on Thursday had cast a shadow over festivities and additional arrangements had to be made to rain-proof the venues."

As the bank is situated at least 4-5 km from our native place, it takes at least 3-4 hours to make the entire trip on foot. This apart, we have to spend 5-6 hours more in queues of almost 500 customers to complete all processes including exchange of old currencies, deposition or withdraw of cash amounts,"" said Savita Devi, 55, a resident of village under Bagodar block.Delayed sowing of seeds or cutting of standing crops will affect agricultural production. ""This is the time for germination of Rabi crops like wheat, mustard, gram, masoor or others, which requires moderate temperature between 9-17 degrees for better germination or other activities. If the sowing of such seeds is delayed by 7-10 days, it would certainly affect growth and produce of such items. On the other hand, this is the right time for cutting of Kharif crops like paddy, which cannot be done after its stem is wetted (normally from the second half of October to the first of November as per the quality of paddies)."" said the District Agriculture Officer (DAO), Brajeshwar Dubey, adding that as Gawan and suburban areas are considered better farming field for Rabi crops, the delays may affect the rural economy to a great extent.In a relief, the state food and supply department (FSD) is working on appointing banking correspondents (BCs) to lessen the woes of the rural people in availing money at their door step.""The PDS units will function as common centres where select bank activities shall be done and BCs will be the interface between the customer and the bank,"" said FSD minister, Saryu Rai.Refraining from thoroughly disclosing the nitty-gritty of the proposed system the minister said the work towards implementation of this initiative is moving at pace and probably by the end of next financial year it could be implemented in phased manner.
