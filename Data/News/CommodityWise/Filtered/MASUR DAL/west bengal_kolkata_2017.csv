The 74-year Meenakshi, Indias oldest woman Kalaripayattu exponent, said the honour was quite unexpected. I was surprised when the officers passed the news, she said. My family and students are happy to hear the news.They have already begun to celebrate, she added. Meenakshi started learning Kalaripayattu from the age of six under Raghavan Master for 10 years and at the age of 17 she married him. After marriage, she joined the Kadathanadan Kalari Sangam at Vadakara, which was started by her husband in 1949 as a teacher. The sangam has been imparting free training to Kalaripayattu enthusiasts since then. Now, around 150 students are learning the martial art at the sangam. We receive only gurudakshina (offering for teacher at the completion of training) from the students,she told Express. Nowadays, apart from teaching, I practise prior to performances, she said.K J Yesudas, Padma VibhushanKeralas celestial singer K J Yesudas has recorded over 50,000 songs in a number of Indian and foreign languages. He was honoured with Padma Shri in 1975 and Padma Bhushan in 2002. He won the national award for best male playback singer seven times and state awards 43 times - by the governments of Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and West Bengal. Yesudas was born to the late couple Augustine Joseph and Elizabeth Joseph in 1940. His father was a well-known Malayalam classical musician and actor. His first film song was Attention penne attention which he sung with Santha P Nair. On special occasions, the musician renders his first song Jaathi bhedam matha dwesham, the famous lyrics of social reformer Sree Narayana Guru. Yesudas is the youngest person to head the Kerala Sangeetha Nataka Akademi in 1970.Nonagenarian Akkitham Achuthan Namboothiri could not initially believe that he was named a recipient of Padma Shri, Indias fourth highest civilian award. I now feel it was God that made it possible. All awards, whether small or big, give me immense happiness. If the younger generation works hard, accolades will surely come their way, said the Malayalam poet, popularly known as Akkitham. Although Union Government officials from New Delhi relayed the news to his family in the morning itself, it was only by 5.20pm that an official announcement was made.Born on March 18, 1926, Akkitham has written around 50 books and has several poems, short stories and essays to his credit. One of his prominent works is Dharmasooryan based on the life and works of Gandhiji. His anthologies include Idinja Polinja Lokam, Oru Kulla Munthirinja and Oru Kudunna Nilavu.He worked as an activist of Yogakshema Sabha to reform the Namboothiri community and also with V T Bhattathiripaad against the ill practices in the society. A recipient of Kendra Sahithya Academy award, Odakuzhal award, Ashan award, Vallathol award and Jnanapana awards, he has served as vice-president of Kerala Sahitya academy and Changampuzha Memorial Academy and as director of Kottayam Sahithya Pravarthaka Sahakarna Sangham.Akkitham, Padma ShriChemancheri Kunhiraman Nair, Padma ShriThough the national recognition has come a little late to Chemancheri Kunhiraman Nair, the 103-year-old Kathakali maestro seemed overwhelmed with joy on Wednesday. I am honoured. I am grateful for this acknowledgement. Its equally a recognition to the field of dance and Keralas own art form Kathakali, the elated maestro said. People from all walks of life flocked into his house at Chemancheri near Koyilandy to congratulate him after the declaration of Padma Shri awardees of the year.At the age of 15, Chemancheri left home to join a Kathakali troupe run by Guru Karunakara Menon. Later, he founded Bharatiya Natyakalalayam in 1945, the first school of dance in North Kerala. Determined to revive the dying art from, he opened several other dance schools down the line. In 1983, he established Cheliya Kathakali Vidyalayam in his native Cheliya village, about 30 km from Kozhikode. Even at 103, Chemancheri is full of energy and has a unassailable zest towards the classical art form.P R Sreejesh, Padma ShriWednesday turned out to be a day to remember for national hockey team skipper P R Sreejesh, 30. For, he became the first male sportsperson from Kerala to be bestowed with Padma Shri, Indias fourth highest civilian honour, and was also nominated in the Goalkeeper of the Year category of the International Hockey Federations (FIH) annual award. In 2016, Sreejesh - who is now playing for Uttar Pradesh Wizard in the Hockey India League - led the country to the quarterfinals of the Rio Olympics and helped it bag a silver medal in the Champions Trophy.He was also part of the team that overcame Pakistan 3-2 in the final to lift the Asian Champions Trophy in October. Anju Bobby George, who, along with K M Beenamol, received the honour in 2004, congratulated the Indian goalkeeper and said, It is a proud moment not just for Kerala, but for the entire country. Over a decade passed since a Kerala sportsperson won the award. It will boost the state and inspire our youngsters. As for Sreejesh, the honour will help him perform even better and achieve greater things for the country. Previous Padma Shri awardees from Kerala include M D Valsamma (1983), P T Usha (1985) and Shiny Wilson (1998).Carnatic musician Parassala B Ponnammal on Wednesday expressed her happiness at being selected for the Padma Shri award. I was resting when the call came from Delhi. By then, TV channels too began showing the news, seated at her home in Valiyasala, she said. Its all due to the blessings of Sree Padmanabha Swami, Chembai and Semmangudi, she said. She recalled how she had started her musical journey 76 years ago. I was part of the first batch at the Swathi Thirunal College of Music.And I got a teaching job before I was 18, she said. After the news of her selection broke out on Wednesday, friends, relatives, political leaders and the media thronged the residence, where she lives with her elder son Mahadevan and family. Ponnammal, born in 1924, has several firsts to her name; the first girl to study music in a professional institute, the first woman faculty of the Swathi Thirunal College of Music and the first woman head of the RLV Music College in Tripunithura (she joined in 1952 and retired in 1980), among others."
58f5d3f57be9e01a357a8082,"Kolkata eats healthy, but works out less: Survey",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/city-eats-healthy-but-works-out-less-survey/articleshow/57069549.cms,2017-02-10,"KOLKATA: People in Kolkata eat the healthiest among eight metros, an analysis of 43 million food logs of 1 million urban Indians has revealed. The flip side, however, is that the average Kolkatan burns the least calories. Also, with families increasingly eating out, the advantages of a balanced diet that is inherent in Bengal's traditional recipes may soon not reflect on the people, warn nutritionists and dieticians.Data logged by mobile health and fitness firm HealthifyMe, which analyses self-reported information on what and how much people consume to work out the protein-fat-carbohydrate (PFC) ratio, shows a slightly higher protien and fat intake and a reduction in carbohydrate can make the average Kolkatan's diet perfect. Other cities, however, require substantial changes to their food habit to make it healthy.The National Institute of Nutrition under the Indian Council of Medical Research pegs the average Indian adult's ideal PFC ratio at 20%:30%:50%. From the 5.5 lakh food logs reported by 10,000-plus Kolkatans in 2016, the average PFC ratio of food intake is 16.9%: 28.6%: 54.5%, the closest to the ideal, says Tushar Vashisht , co-founder and CEO of HealthifyMe.Compared to the rest of the country, the percentage contribution of protein to energy is higher while fat and carbohydrate to energy is lower in Kolkata. ""The high protein intake from the regular intake of fish, meat and lentils put people in the city at a lower risk for conditions like diabetes, osteoporosis, stroke and obesity,"" remarked Mitali Palodhi, nutritianist-dietician and vice-president of Indian Dietetic Association.Consumption of vegetables is also higher in Kolkata than most other cities. Masoor dal, mixed vegetables and machher jhol are among the most popular meal items while muri or puffed rice is a very popular snack item.In contrast, consumption of fat is highest in Delhi that thrives on paratha, milk/butter and samosa. Such food habit puts them at greater risk of heart disease and hypertension. Chennai, Hyderabad and Bangalore, on the other hand, consume more carbohydrate through their diet of rice, idli and dosa makes them susceptible to diabetes.While the survey shows that Bengal's traditional food is balanced as they contain all nutrients, dieticians are worried that habits are fast changing. ""Increasingly, people are opting to eat out or order in. When one does that, one doesn't know the fat content. It is also disturbing to hear some parents brag that their children don't like rice or roti. One has to get children addicted to home food,"" said Ipsita Chakravarti, chief dietician of CMRI.The lack of balance diet is leading to micronutrient deficiencies like Vitamin D and iron and folic acid. ""These problems would earlier occur mostly among the impoverished people who could not afford a proper meal. But that is not the case now. High consumption of fast food is resulting in these problem across socio-economic groups,"" said Palodhi.Another major problem, says Chakravarti, is sendantary lifestyle. Analysis of HealthifyMe data shows the average Kolkatan burns minimum calories. While a Kolkatan burns 209 kCal a day, it is 232 kCal in Bangalore, 229 kCal in Delhi and 227 kCal in Mumbai."

58f6be437be9e031f13bafa1,Amazon awaits FDI approval to deliver groceries at doorstep,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/amazon-awaits-fdi-approval-to-deliver-groceries-at-doorstep/articleshow/57404855.cms,2017-03-01,"KOLKATA: Ten years after Amazon began the experiment with groceries at its Seattle home, the US e-commerce company is set to start selling farm produce, lentils and milk in India once it receives the government's approval for its wholly-owned foods unit. Amazon Fresh , a business that owes its genesis to a 2007 move by the online retailer to offer Seattle area residents doorstep delivery of a limited selection of groceries, awaits Foreign Direct Investment approval before it can sell locally. Besides groceries, Amazon India will continue to invest heavily in the fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) business for a few more years, according to the Director, FMCG category management, Saurabh Srivastava.""We will maintain the entire supply chain directly and right sourcing will be the key. Such value was not possible to be delivered had the government not liberalised the FDI policy,"" said Srivastava. The company will source fresh produce and staples directly from farmers as part of the Amazon Fresh initiative, he said.Amazon Fresh has been the key vehicle the e-commerce giant has used to compete with the supermarkets, enabling it to sell fresh produce, dairy and bakery products in the US, UK and Europe. Last June, the company hopped across the Atlantic for the first time, offering services to London consumers.In India, the company already sells fresh vegetables, fruits and dairy products through its hyperlocal venture Amazon Now in Mumbai, Delhi, Hyderabad and Bengaluru. For this, it sources the products from the supermarkets based on through screening and packs them in special temperature-controlled boxes for delivery to the consumer household.""Our experience with Amazon Now is not satisfactory, especially on the quality of produce we source from the supermarkets. Hence, we have not yet started with fish and meat. Once we undertake direct sales and sourcing under Amazon Fresh, we would be able to add much more value,"" said Srivastava.He said the company will continue to invest over the next few years and is not looking at immediately generating profit: The company is instead seeking to drive a habit change for consumers buying FMCG and grocery products online. ""Our focus is on the long term. Of course, as our order volumes increase, we would drive economies of scale into the business. But we don't want to focus on just one city to make it profitable right now and would rather expand our offering,"" he said.On discounts on low-margin categories such as FMCG, Srivastava said discounts are passed on by the brands or sellers since they see e-commerce as one of the fastest growing channels. ""There are discounts in this category that are offered by neighbourhood grocers, supermarkets and even wholesalers, which they are not supposed to do. We have enabled access to all such discounts directly to consumers,"" he said.The FMCG category is one of the fastest growing at Amazon and the largest in terms of units sold. There are over 9,000 sellers for FMCG products at present and the business has grown by 165% last year over 2015. Amazon currently sells 1.9 million FMCG products across categories."

The remaining quantity is expected to reach the State by March 10.In the first week, each family will receive 5 kg, and 10 kg in the following weeks.Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan will inaugurate the project on March 6, in a ceremony to be organised by the Karakulam Service Cooperative Bank. Mr. Surendran will preside over the event. The distribution will be conducted in 40 outlets each in Thiruvananthapuram, Ernakulam, Kozhikode, Kannur, Palakkad, Thrissur, and Kollam, 30 outlets in Malappuram, Alappuzha, Pathanamthitta, Idukki, Kottayam, and Kasaragod, and 20 outlets in Wayanad.The project will continue at least until Vishu , Mr. Surendran said. Whether or not it should be continued after that will be decided on the basis on the price prevailing in the market at the point.Subsidised rateThe rice, the procurement and transport of which actually costs approximately Rs. 27 a kg, is being provided at a subsidised rate with the plight of the common man in mind, the Minister said, adding that the cooperative societies had agreed to bear this burden.It was decided to make the purchase from West Bengal after the consortium made visits to dealers in Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, and West Bengal.The Minister said the consortium had found that the recent rise in the price level was due to the operations of some rice agents centred on Kollam, who intended to exploit the customer."

(Express Photo by Shubham Dutta) When it sets off from Howrah station, the Antyodaya is almost empty, but as it enters Vijayawada, almost every inch of space is taken. (Express Photo by Shubham Dutta)From a 21-year-old fleeing the sea in Goa to a 54-year-old former bus conductor from Malda who is going to Kerala for the first time, the Antyodaya Express, a fully unreserved train between Howrah and Ernakulam, and its 20 coaches carry the shared burden of a thousand stories and dreams. The Indian Express rides alongsideFitted with cushioned luggage racks, vestibuled ends for passengers to move through compartments, drinking water dispensers, mobile-charging points, fire extinguishers and modular toilets, the Antyodaya services the Eastern-Southern railway corridor, which sees the heaviest movement of migrant workers in the country. A 2013 report by the Gulati Institute of Finance and Taxation that was placed in the Kerala Assembly said that four states  Assam, West Bengal, Bihar and Odisha  alone accounted for 62% of the migrant workers in Kerala.The train finally pulls into Ernakulam (above) on Monday morning (Express Photo by Shubham Dutta) The train finally pulls into Ernakulam (above) on Monday morning (Express Photo by Shubham Dutta)At its launch, Railways Minister Suresh Prabhu said, Antyodaya Express is a long-distance, fully unreserved, superfast train service for the common man to be operated on dense routes The facilities provided in Antyodaya coaches are similar (to those) in first class. Our governments focus is on aam aadmi so we launched the product with many facilities for them.Except, most people dont know about the train. When it sets out from Howrah at 5 pm on March 18, a Saturday, its third trip from Howrah to Ernakulam, only 200 of the 1,600 seats had been filled. Almost everyone on the train had found their way here accidentally, after missing the other train, Suvidha Special, which, curiously, runs on the same date and on the same route.The problem is that there has been very little publicity about the Antyodaya whereas the Suvidha Special continues to be completely crammed  if you get an empty patch to sit on the train, you dont move for the next 36 hours, says a senior officer of the South Eastern Railways.So this Saturday evening, as passengers gingerly get on to the new train, complete with the sheen rarely associated with the Railways, many wonder if they have got onto the wrong train.Like Mohammad Rafiqul. A few minutes after he steps in, the 33-year-old, a veteran of unreserved trains and a labourer in Kochi, realises that all 20 coaches of Antyodaya are unreserved. He sits on a berth and tentatively stretches out his legs. Then, with more abandon, he flings his small bag onto the parallel seat and says with a smile, It doesnt smell of sweat. It smells different.By 8 pm, the train is rumbling through Odisha and all mobile charging points have been taken. Music from mobile phones, ranging from folk songs of Bengal to Bhojpuri film music, compete with the steady chugging of the train. One passenger points to his GPS, the blue dot rushing parallel to the ocean and asks another, You think we can see the sea from here? The sun has set though and the observatory windows  a novelty on unreserved trains  have little to offer.Home-cooked meals are prised open, filling the train with the heady aroma of mustard and spicy fish curries. The lights stay on, all night. But that doesnt seem to bother many  as one passenger puts it, a good meal and a place to stretch your legs is all you need to get some sleep.Much of the journey continues the same way. It isnt until 12.30 on Sunday afternoon that the train reaches Vijayawada, the junction where the most number of passengers get on. Most of them are migrant workers from Chhattisgarh, Bihar and Andhra Pradesh. But the amazement of the passengers as they get to the train and the shared burden of their stories remain the same, helping workers who dont speak the same language to somehow find common ground.Take, for instance, Shaiful Sheikh. The 24-year-old from Mayapur in West Bengal works near Aluva in Kerala. He is engaged in a deep conversation with Hari Shankar Kumar from Jharkhand  about the train, the Narendra Modi governments plans for the poor and how it all connects with demonetisation. When neither Hindi nor Bengali proves to be a language they can converse in, they throw in a few Telugu and Malayalam words.Our stories are all the same. We are all here because of our stomachs, says Kumar.Over the next few hours, there are more stories  of drought, rains coming too late or too early, crops lost to blight, parents dying and leaving behind only debt, of industries moving away or eating up their land, of crooked politicians.It isnt until 1 am on Monday that the train finally fills up. As it pulls into Coimbatore Junction, hundreds fill the compartments. Some lie underneath the seats to catch some sleep, others balance themselves against the new scratch-proof walls of the new train and somehow, manage to fall asleep.At the start of the journey, many had looked around in wonder at the near empty train. Now, they sit stoic, squeezing in to accommodate more people. Isnt this how trains for the poor always are, after all?Pramod Kumar, 21No job yetFrom: Raigarh, ChhattisgarhDestination: Salem, Tamil NaduAfter a bit of coaxing, Kumar reveals the truth: he is fleeing Goa. He simply hated the place. A year ago, says the 21-year-old, he went to Goa on a whim after seeing a photograph in a magazine. I thought itd be nice to get work near the sea, he says . But that place was horrible. I used to work on a fishing boat and it was scary. I didnt know how to swim. I learnt that but what good is a little boat if the weather is bad?, he says, adding that he is now on his way to Salem, Tamil Nadu, where a cousin works.After some negotiation, Ram managed to find a train to Vijayawada from where he will travel to Salem. My cousin said the contractor would give me food and pay me Rs 8,000 or 9,000 a month. Thats better than what I was getting in Goa. Besides, thankfully, theres no sea in Salem, he says with a shudder.In his bag: A GOA T-shirt and some clothesBirender Kumar Ram, 33Juice shop ownerFrom: Karihari, JharkhandDestination: VijaywadaRam moved out of his village when he was in his twenties. My family didnt have any money. I had studied till Class 12, but there was no job in the village. So I started working in a restaurant in Tirupathi and later Hyderabad.He worked his way through different jobs  mostly restaurants, sometimes at shops. I did well because I was educated. The language was a problem, but when your survival depends on it, you can learn almost anything.A couple of years ago, Ram and his friend from his village started a juice shop in Tirupathi. We named it Balaji Juice Shop. It is a good shop on the way to the temple. I save Rs 10,000 a month, he says.Ram says he misses his family  his wife and two children are in Jharkhand  but cant say that about his village. Every time I go back to the village, it seems strange, a little alien.In his bag: A note his son wrote to him, neatly folded in his walletNaresh Sarana, 23Works at ice-making plantFrom: Gossaigaon, AssamDestination: ErnakulamThe 23-year-old has a hard time explaining where his home is. Buxa, in Assam, he says repeatedly. When told Buxa is in West Bengal, he explains patiently, Buxa, the forest. Our home is in the forest that starts from Buxa in West Bengal and comes all the way to lower Assam. My family is from Gossaigaon.The 23-year-old has studied till his Class 10 and now works in Ernakulam at an ice-making plant. He explains that whenever he travels out of home, he stops at Siliguri, a city known for its wholesale Chinese goods market. I picked up a new leather wallet there, he says with a grin.I have been working in Kerala for two years. A friend of mine told me about this job and I get paid Rs 7,500 a fortnight. My family grows a little rice on our field but that is not enough. So my parents depend on my income.In his bag: His new walletNoorwar Mondal, 32Construction workerFrom Mayapur, West BengalDestination: AluvaMondal has been a construction worker in Kerala for three years. Like his ancestors before him, he had worked as a sharecropper, but soon, found that work was hard to come by as were the wages. By 2014, he decided to join the many people from his village and make his way to Kerala.It was easier than I thought because there are so many people from Bengal in Kerala. For instance, my family told me to carry mustard oil with me so that I could make fish curry  mustard oil is hard to find in Kerala.His work is tough but pays well, between Rs 450 and Rs 500 a day, along with overtime. In Bengal, there are too many people and not enough jobs; in Kerala, people are all well educated and dont want to do the work we do, says Mondal, who spends six months with his family  wife and two children  and six months working and saving.In his bag: A bottle of mustard oilMd. Rafiqul, 33No job yetFrom Islampur, West BengalDestination: ErnakulamRafiqul used to work as a compounder in a local hospital in Islampur, a town in West Bengals Murshidabad district. But last year, after his son was born, he decided he needed to get work that paid more. His friends told him about Kerala and how he could find work laying floor tiles. So he packed his bags and took the train, his first trip to Kerala.I am a little worried. Everyone has said that Kerala has good fish. But the fish in Murshidabad is the best in the world. Our Hilsa is the best and there is no one who can cook it the way we do. I cant survive on dosas, he says laughing.And then, on a serious note, he says, My friends told me I can earn almostRs 1,000 a day in Kerala. From Ernakulam, I will meet a friend and we will go together to Thiruvananthapuram. If what they have promised comes true, it will change our lives  at least my sons if not mine, he says.In his bag: A bottle of mustard oilMohammad Isharul Islam, 26Construction workerFrom Islampur, West BengalDestination: ErnakulamIslam has been in Kerala for six years, working as a construction worker. That makes him somewhat of an old hand. So when he talks about his work in Kerala and why he doesnt think the good run will last, people around him pull in closer to hear him speak. Demonetisation was a turning point. Construction work stopped altogether and all of us were stranded, he says, adding that his employers still owe him about Rs 50,000.Still unmarried, he laughs and says that his mother is constantly horrified at the thought of him marrying someone from outside Bengal. The 26-year-old works as a construction worker, laying floor tiles in homes. Its strange working in these big homes and then going back to a cramped room. But at least I can send about Rs 3,000 to my family. But what they really look forward to is the banana chips I take for them, he says.In his bag: A family photographDeepak Dhaori, 29CarpenterFrom Jhargram, West BengalDestination: VijaywadaA carpenter, Dhaori is on his first trip outside Bengal. The 29-year-old is from Chandri, a village in Jhargram, 37 km from Lalgarh, which was the site of the November 2008 clashes between villagers and cadres of the erstwhile Left Front government.Dhaori plans to alight at Vijayawada and take the bus to Secunderabad in Hyderabad. Someone from my village is in Secunderabad and they said they need carpenters. In my village, there is no work and it has been that way for years, he says.Married, with a boy and a girl whom he has left behind, the 29-year-old says that until a decade ago, people in his village used to die due to lack of medical attention and clean drinking water. To be honest, I am scared to go to a new place. There are things, habits you never thought you would give up  like the evening tea with friends. But I had to leave home.In his bag: A new shirtSonu Ram, 40LabourerFrom Jabalpur, MPDestination: CoimbatoreOn his way to Shoranur, a town in Keralas Palakkad district, this is the 40-year-olds first trip outside home. There is no work in Madhya Pradesh. The drought last year wiped out the farms. We lost all our crops. My elder son studied till his Class 8 and then went to Kerala for work, the other is in Class 5. My son said only if both of us work can we support the family.While his son paints houses, he says he is unsure about what he will do  I may have to start by laying bricks.He had taken a train from Jabalpur to Vijayawada, from where they boarded the Antyodaya Express. Asked about the work and his expectations, he says, From what my son has told me, I can make about Rs 15,000 a month and not spend too much because the employers give us food and a place to sleep.In his bag: A list of phone numbers and directions written on a piece of paperRabindra Mali, 27Mill workerFrom Cuttack, OdishaDestination: CoimbatoreThe 27-year-old has been working for over a decade at a spinning mill in Kozhikode. From a traditional fishing family near Cuttack, Rabindra says he has never been to school. When I was 10, I went to Tirupati because I heard you can get work near the temple. I started working in a tea shop and then at a restaurant as a waiter. Later, I got this job in a spinning mill, he says.Rabindra will get off at Coimbatore and take a bus to his factory. I work about 12 hours a day and make Rs 390 a day  thats about Rs 12,000 a month, he says. The company he works for, says Mali, pays him overtime but no food and accommodation. My sister and brother-in-law also live in Kozhikode. He works in a company and she works as a domestic help, he says, adding that he hopes to someday bring his wife and 3-year-old son to the city.In his bag: A sari for his sister and a new shirt for his brother-in-lawMahesh Bharti, 24MasonFrom Jabalpur, MPDestination: CoimbatoreWhen he is not poring over Hindi film magazines, Bharti has people around him hooked with his knowledge of all things Bollywood, passionately discussing everything from Katrina Kaifs love life to Salman Khans troubles with the law.Bharti works as a contract labourer in Shoranur, a town in Palakkad district, and earns about Rs 650 a day. I am going to Coimbatore and from there I will go to Shoranur. Thats where I have been working the past year. Tiles, plaster, wall putty  I do it all, he says with a grin. His parents continue to live in Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh, where they have own some land.In his bag: A few Hindi film magazinesTapash Pappu Maity, 26WaiterFrom KolkataDestination: ErnakulamTapash Maity, or Pappu as he calls himself, worked as a waiter at various outlets of Kwality Walls in Kolkata until three years ago. The 26-year-old married two years ago and now has a year-old son.He says, The job in Kolkata was okay  the money wasnt too good, but it was good, steady work. But the problem was my salary was stuck at Rs 8,000 a month for far too long. In Kerala, I work for Lazza Ice Creams  I serve at their parlours and earn about Rs 24,000 a month.It helps to be from a big city, he says  nothing surprises me. Others, you know, they see women roaming around late at night in malls and get a shock. Not me.In his bag: Photographs of his wife and year-old sonMilan Mondal, 23Construction workerFrom Murshidabad, West BengalDestination: Ernakulam, KeralaWhen he was 12, Mondal borrowed Rs 400 from his parents, saying he was going to Kolkata to see the city, and ran away with an elder cousin.My first job was at a construction site in Kolkata  a club house run by the Left that was being renovated. In the mornings, I would fetch water and in the evenings, when the party people sat down to play cards, Id serve tea and get some bakshish. I had left home with Rs 400; when I went back eight years later, I had Rs 4,000.Mondal has been in Kerala for three years, working at a construction site in Idduki. I earn Rs 6,000 a week, much more than what I earned in Kolkata, he says, distracted as he fiddles with his smartphone. Gadgets are my real love. Tonight, I am going to watch movies on YouTube  old Bengali films. Those stories are from a simpler time.In his bag: SD card with moviesSheikh Hasibul Arinde, 40ElectricianFrom HowrahDestination: CoimbatoreThe 40-year-old is a trained electrician, having earlier worked for a government-run electrical agency in Bengal. He now works as an electrical contractor for Larsen and Toubro, on a project near Coimbatore.I have been working as an electrician for decades now. My father was an electrician at the Kolaghat Power Plant near Kolkata and I learnt from him. But to be able to work in Bengal, you need a licence and for that, you have to pay bribes to the party, he says, adding that he is glad he moved to Coimbatore.My daughter and son are in school in Howrah. I dont want them to become electricians, but I always tell them to see and experience new things. For instance, when I first went to Tamil Nadu, I had a hard time with the language. Not anymore, he says.In his bag: A new shirt that his in-laws gave himAbhishek Sarkar, 29ElectricianFrom Nabadwip, West BengalDestination: CoimbatoreSarkar met Arinde while in Kerala and the two now work together for the same company in Coimbatore. Their friendship, they admit, is rare for these times. He is Muslim, I am Hindu. We live together and eat together. I celebrate his festivals and he does mine. But when we go back home, people give us strange looks. What they dont understand is this: Hindu or Muslim, our problems are the same. God doesnt come into the picture when youre not getting paid, says Sarkar, talking about how demonetisation hit people like him.For almost two months, we didnt get paid. Employers still owe us about Rs 75,000. One of the contractors from Odisha said he would pay us soon; now he doesnt even pick his phone, he says.In his bag: His mother has packed a packet of sandesh from his favorite shopArshad Rahman, 37Labour contractorFrom Kamrup, AssamDestination: Katpadi, Tamil NaduWhen asked what he does, he says, Businessman. I am a labour contractor.I am a migrant, but not a labourer. I arrange for labourers, he says repeatedly. He says he first went to the south around 15 years ago when he got an order to get labourers to work at a Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) in Chennai. My men have made almost all the STPs in Chennai. My labourers are the best, he brags. Talking of how he began his business, he says, There were so many people in the Northeast and East looking for work that I realised it was a great opportunity.Rahman, who says he has worked in several states, including Gujarat, Telangana and Kerala, saves about Rs 30,000 a month. Work has slowed down in Gujarat because all the big projects have already come up. In Kerala, too, it will slow down. Right now, I am going to Katpadi near Vellore (Tamil Nadu) and after that, I may have to go to Telangana.In his bag: A new pair of jeansSheikh Shamim, 29Construction workerFrom Pandua, West BengalDestination: ErnakulamThis is Shamins second trip to Kerala, where he works at a construction site. After spending almost an hour worrying if he was on the right train, he finally settles down.A year ago, a contractor from our village asked me if I wanted work. I said yes, and here I am. It is hard work, but the money is better than anything you get in Bengal, he says.The 29-year-old from Pandua in Hooghly district, who dropped out after Class 3, used to work as a rickshaw driver. With his wife expecting their second child, he says he had to find a way to earn more money. I came at a bad time, though. Within a few months of my coming to Kerala, work dried up because of demonetisation. Contractors said they couldnt pay us anymore, so I went back. This time, I am planning to stay for as long as I can, he says.In his bag: Puffed rice and naaru (sweet made of coconut and jaggery)Sheikh Mantu, 54LabourerFrom Malda, West BengalDestination: ErnakulamThe 54-year-old worked as a bus conductor for close to four decades, but three years ago, after a near-fatal accident, his family said they wouldnt let him to do that work any longer. I was a conductor on the Malda-Kolkata route. I did that for 36 years. But once, our bus met with an accident  the driver was killed and my rib cage was shattered. My family was scared after that. They still call buses vehicles of death.But with his family  wife, three children and an ailing father  to take care of, Mantu had to find some work. There were others from my village working as labourers in Kerala so a year ago, I decided to come with them, he says.The work in Kerala, he says, is strenuous, but the money is good. I do plastering and painting. I used to make about Rs 400 a day, now I make twice that. But to be honest, I didnt think I would have to work at this age.In his bag: A pack of cardsShamwar Hossain, 20Construction workerFrom Mayapur, West BengalDestination: Aluva, KeralaHossain has been to Kerala only once before. He works as a construction worker there, earning Rs 450 a day. I work for a contractor who tells me where to work. The hours are regular in Kerala and pay comes on time. The government is also more sensitive to the needs of the poor. For instance, I am told that they will give me a identity card, he says.Hossains family are sharecroppers, but with agriculture in Nadia, his home district, failing, labour is no longer in demand and his father has been unemployed for five years.I dont plan to go back to Nadia. There are others who miss home. I dont. When I think about home, I think of people suffering because they cant find work and my mother skipping meals to let us to eat. In Kerala, lifes good. I earn well, I work hard and I sleep peacefully at night.In his bag: Four packets of chanachur (a snack of chickpeas, lentils and nuts)Mritunjay, 24CarpenterFrom Kharagpur, West BengalDestination: Katpadi, Tamil NaduMritunjay says never wanted to leave his home in Kharagpur. But with no formal education, the 24-year-old says he couldnt have found a job in his village. There are schools for us Adivasis in Kharagpur, but I never studied. That was a mistake.He learnt carpentry from his uncle in Kharagpur, helping him make tables and chairs for government offices. He had earlier worked in Thane as a labourer but returned to his uncles shop. Not only did they not pay well, he says, but they were cheats and the city is too crowded and people unkind.Mrirtunjay says his uncles friend is a construction worker in Vellore. My uncle said his friend would help me. He even bought me the train ticket. I have been told that I can earn Rs 500 a day and if I do a lot of overtime, over Rs 15,000 a month. Thats almost double of what I was making in Kharagpur.In his bag: Two new gamchasMohammad Firoz, 26MasonFrom: HooghlyDestination: ErnakulamThe 26-year-old first came to Ernakulam in 2008. He knew an uncle in the area, who quickly set him up to work as a bricklayer.Since then, he has progressed to being a wall putty specialist. Initially, I had some trouble with the food in Kerala. Everything is cooked in coconut oil. I dont like that. There are others who will eat just about anything. But that isnt me. I enjoy my food. Luckily, there was good beef in Kerala  that was a life saver.Firoz now earns about Rs 500 a day, plastering walls at a Kendriya Vidyalaya in Ernakulam. Its a government school so we get paid on time. I make aboutRs 3,400 a week, including overtime. That is enough for me to live comfortably  eat beef and fish once in a while whenever I dont feel like eating the food the contractors give me.In his bag: a photograph of his parentsFor all the latest India News, download Indian Express App nowFirst Published on: March 26, 2017 3:26 am"

(Source: Express Photo) Shahid Afridi in his column for ICC opened about his relations with Indian cricketers. (Source: Express Photo)Former Pakistan cricketer Shahid Afridi, in his column for the ICC, revealed about the bond he shares with Indian cricketers but said Gautam Gambhir remains an exception. Contrary to popular belief, India and Pakistan players get along very well. Of course, there are exceptions like Gautam Gambhir, who dare I say isnt the friendliest, wrote Afridi.Gambhir and Afridi had a heated on-field exchange during a India-Pakistan clash after which the relation between the two became sour, and have continued to be.We are unlikely to be found together at a coffee shop anytime soon. We had a heated exchange on the field some years ago and it made headlines all over the world. While I have moved on in life as I feel these things are part and parcel of the game, Gautam for some reason cant get over it. Good luck to him!The former Pakistan all-rounder also mentioned about the players in the Indian side with whom he shares some wonderful memories. Shahid Afridi mentioned Harrbhajan Singh, Yuvraj Singh and Zaheer Khan were some of the players with whom he used to get along well.The three are my good mates and we have some wonderful memories together from the times when both the sides used to play and tour each other on a regular basis.In the early days of our careers, we used to hang out together quite a lot and also spend time at each others homes. Now, all of us are married and, as such, responsibilities and the priority lists have changed. But whenever we catch up, we meet with warmth and love, and remember our good times together, Afridi added.Talking about the present players, Pakistans former skipper said that he admires Virat Kohli and hailed his fitness and batting abilities. Last month, the Indian team presented Afridi a jersey with Virats name and jersey number on it.Another player I admire and respect from the present lot is Virat Kohli. He has a fantastic cricket bat in hand and an even a better heart in his supremely fit body. I will always remember him for the gesture he showed when he gave me an India cricket teams signed shirt following our match in Kolkata in the World T20. This shirt sits prominently in my collection and will always remind me of not only my matches and visits to India, but my excellent relationships with most, if not all India cricketers, he wrote.Recollecting some fond memories with Indian team, Afridi remembered Indias tour to Pakistan. The Pakistan all-rounder mentioned about how he treated the Indian side at his place in Karachi.I recall during one of Indias tours to Pakistan. Invited the entire India team to my Karachi house. We prepared special Pathan-style rich food, full of lamb and mutton dishes. When the food was served, there was a complete silence in the room and my Indian friends were looking at each other. At that point, I realised that my honourable and respectable guests dont eat that type of food. Quite a few of them were vegetarians, and so, we had to urgently replace the food with Daal (lentils) and vegetables dishes. It was quite embarrassing for me to not know about the dietary requirements of the guests since our similarity of culture made me take many things for granted. That was a funny memory of my hospitality for the Indian team.Unfortunately, we dont meet each other that often now due to the prevailing relations between the two countries. But I miss the good times with my Indian cricket friends and I am sure they feel likewise. Hopefully, the situation will improve soon so that the old friends can reunite to relive old memories, he added.For all the latest Sports News, download Indian Express App now IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd"
5922ccc67be9e01fe6dfb3bb,Rats! they did it again,http://www.newindianexpress.com/opinions/editorials/2017/may/09/rats-they-did-it-again-1602735.html,2017-05-09,"The Bihar police claim that rats consumed several thousand litres of seized liquor from their maalkhanas, or record rooms, has led to much media mirth and merriment. Years ago, a police station in Kolkata had claimed that a hanuman had broken into their maalkhana and stolen a huge cache of jewellery recovered from robbery.While we might chuckle over such claims, rats do cause immense damage to police record rooms. Consider this: Hapless police in Karnal, Haryana reportedly hired a couple of domesticated white rats to scare away an army of rats merrily chewing its way through documents. The damage goes way beyond maalkhanas. Rats eat and contaminate thousands of tons of food stored in government godowns and trains. To the extent that a sub-clause in the Prevention of Food Adulteration (PFA) Act, 1954, says wheat, maize, jowar, bajra, rice, masoor, urad, moong, chana and arhar shall be free of adulteration, but with five pieces of rodent hair and faeces permitted (per kilogram). When challenged, the government said that a zero-rat-excreta/hair level would be impossible to comply with.Rats gnaw into the insulation of power lines, causing short circuits and fires. Field rats, apart from damaging crops, build burrows which weaken irrigation canal banks, causing unexpected floods. In 2001, after terrorist rats attacked the Parliament, India mobilised troops along the border. This involved laying and mapping minefields in sensitive locations to deter enemy incursions. In 2002, when we decided to stand down without a fight, the area had to be demined. But field rats had apparently shifted hundreds of small anti-personnel mines to their burrows. Fifty-eight civilians and a 100 soldiers were killed, while 310 others were hurt by these landmines between January 2002 and March 2004 in the three states bordering Pakistan. After causing so much death and destruction, can we really blame the rats in Bihar for wanting a drink?"
59355c3e7be9e061b1737066,Mumbai foodies get ready to celebrate Indian food days,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-foodies-get-ready-to-celebrate-indian-food-days/articleshow/58750422.cms,2017-05-20,"Food has always been an inherent part of India's cultural fabric. With its vast repertoire of ingredients, rich culinary traditions and regional influences, Indian cuisine has gained prominence in the world food scenario. And yet, now that we think about it, it seems bizarre that there's not one single day when we collectively celebrate any of our dishes! There have been occasional attempts in this area  like food communities trying to mark a World Undhiyu Day or a National Milk Day, but none of them have really taken off. Rushina Munshaw Ghildiyal , a food consultant who has been organising international food days in Mumbai for some years now, was struck by this thought. And then she saw people from Odisha celebrating Pakhla Day in March this year to promote Odia cuisine. She did not need to look any further to take her vision forward. Says Rushina, ""India has such an interesting food calendar, so why not recognise and celebrate it? Our ingredients are specific to seasons. Their uses, cooking methods, combinations, all affect our yearly food habits. Indian dietetics and dining etiquette have all been built into a system of traditional practices with sound reasons behind them. We consume food according to the needs of our bodies which varies with different seasons. For example, we have rich food in the winter, but lighter and easy-to-digest ones in the monsoons. However, the science behind these traditions are fading from our consciousness and before we forget them altogether, I decided that we need to come together and reignite the discussion around them. We will cook food, click pictures, post them online and invite people to talk about them. It will help to spread the word. And an interesting format to pique people's interest is to designate specific days to certain dishes, when they can be celebrated.""The Indian food calendar is currently all spiced up. According to the Indian climate, summer is the best time to grind dry spices and turn them into tangy, peppery, piquant powders that are coveted around the world. And since pickles make extensive use of these flavourful spices, Rushina decided to flag off her vision with the Aam Achar Day (April 22). This way, it celebrated both the legend of Indian spices and the king of Indian summer fruit, mango. Given the success of the Aam Achar Day, Rushina followed it up with the Papad/Badi Day on May 13. The day was marked by a volley of information about papad and badi (dried balls of mashed lentils and spices) being shared on social media, not just by home-cooks but also from professional chefs and restaurateurs. At her studio, Rushina organised a potluck where food enthusiasts from Punjab, Uttaranchal, Gujarat and West Bengal came together and cooked regional dishes made from the regional varieties of papad and badis. Apart from being a learning experience, it also highlighted, once again, the richness of Indian food's variety. Said media professional Meghna Petkar , who took part in both the celebrations, ""I was never a fan of pickles since I felt that they are such a task to make. So, when I heard about this day, I wanted to join and see what goes into making achar. I realised I was scared for nothing. The preparation is simple. Also, it was a gathering of like-minded people who could interact with each other, share tips and masalas and cook too, while getting to learn new things from experts of different communities.""The Aam Achar Day, which was the first in a series of Indian food observance days that Rushina is planning, saw many reminiscing childhood memories, telling stories, sharing recipes, clicking pictures and going live on social media. All of it was curated with a hashtag #AamAcharDay . The result was that word reached a large number of people, and those numbers just grew when she followed it up with the Papad/Badi Day. She shared with us an interesting anecdote from the experience. ""City-based chef, Ashish Bhasin , who was on vacation in Indonesia sent me pictures of Indonesian papads! It was an interesting bit of information that made us realise, papads exist in all the South East Asian countries  just that they are not always made of lentils, but can also be rice and sago based,"" she quipped.From the Kashmiri spice, ver, to the sambhar masala of the South, from the methiyu no masalo of Gujarat to the panch phoron of Bengal, the hot summer month of May is when communities all over the country dry and grind spices to create the powders that lend regional cuisine their characteristic identity. So the next in the series is the Masala Day, which will be observed today, May 20. ""I have planned an Indian food day calendar for this year. Next, for the month of June, I am planning a Biryani Day,"" informed Rushina. It is not surprising that even kids have taken to this favourably, and are all gung-ho about joining their parents to celebrate their favourite dishes. And who can blame them? If there are specific days when we can show off our love for our favourite foods, like achar and biryani, we are all for it!"
593bc9387be9e04956d788b6,Worth going ‘Fidahh’,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/worth-going-fidahh/article18587550.ece,2017-05-27,"As Iran elected its president, I was reminded of a band of young Iranian friends I had way back in time. In those days when Jawaharlal Nehru University was where all rebels gathered  though I cant say it has changed much since then, despite all efforts to tame it  they studied in JNU and were greatly critical of the Shah of Iran. As Hassan Rouhani was re-elected, I thought of them, wondered where they were, and decided that we would have an Iranian meal in their memory.So I trotted off to the Food Court in the Nehru Place Metro Terminal, in search of an eatery called Fidahh, where I heard you get good Iranian food. I went there and found that the food is essentially Lebanese (of course, theres a shared culinary heritage in the region), but there are quite a few Iranian dishes, too. There is, for instance, something called jujeh kabab, spiced chicken kababs served with rice and a dip.This is a food court, so you order your dishes and eat at a table at the centre of the court, which has a large sitting area. I asked for some lamb chelo kabab (Rs. 340), which I have often eaten in a restaurant called Peter Cat in Kolkata, a chicken shawarma roll (Rs. 219) and, hoping to be healthy, a fattoush salad (Rs. 185). The chelo kabab was to have come with a bed of rice, a red chilli dip and warm pita bread. There was no pita bread  warm or otherwise  but the kabab was excellent, as was the long grained rice, mildly sweet and spiced.I enjoyed the salad, a mix of lettuce leaves, tomatoes, cucumbers and onions, flavoured with zaatar, a mix of spices often used in the region which lends a tart taste to a dish, mint, olive oil, lemon juice and sumac (a much used herb). This was to have been served with crispy pita bread, but I dont think it was my day for bread, for there was no pita with my salad.Deliciously crunchyWhat I really enjoyed was the chicken shawarma, a roll of chicken and iceberg lettuce, served with hummus. The chicken was excellent, lightly spiced but well flavoured, and the roll itself was deliciously crunchy. I bit into it, and the juices oozed out, giving the dish just the right bit of moistness that it needed.Fidahh sells dips, toothere is the garlicky chickpea hummus, the yoghurt dip tzatziki and the grilled eggplant dip, babaghanoush100 grams for Rs. 160. You can try out the hummus bil lamb, the dip prepared with chickpeas, garlic, tahini and olive oil, served with marinated lamb chunks and pita bread. If you get the pita, that is.The region loves its meat, but they have a great many vegetable dishes too. So Fidahh has quite a comprehensive vegetarian section. Paneer, alas, figures prominently there, thanks to a demand for it, no doubt. The Fidahh special vegetable roll (Rs. 220)  a meal in itselfconsists of red, green and yellow peppers with paneer wrapped in a pita bread. There is spinach and cheese kabab (Rs. 265) and tabulleh wrap (Rs. 199) with tomato, onion, parsley, mint, lentils and pomegranate seeds). There is even something called falafel chaat for Rs. 200.There is a harissa (hot chilli pepper paste) chicken steak with summer grilled vegetables for those who want something substantial. And there are stews for those who like their gravies  lamb, chicken and fish stew that costs between Rs. 300 and Rs. 320.The food is delivered to the neighbourhood. The official address is TDI South Bridge, Shop No 6, Food Court, Lower Ground Floor, Nehru Place Metro Terminal, and the phone numbers are 9911166951 and 9971166951.I liked the look of the place, and the food. Its light, but not bland. And its flavourful but not drowned with spices. I felt sated after my semi-Iranian meal. I thought of friends long gone from my life, and wished them peace, wherever they are."

Farmers in both states have held protests demanding better prices for their crops and for crores of rupees of their debt waived off.

India is still carrying a huge inventory of food grains from last years record harvest as exports were hit by an appreciating rupee, falling global prices and restrictions on overseas shipments. Another bumper harvest could accelerate the price slide and stoke discontent among farmers that has triggered protests in the big agrarian states of Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh, where police shot dead five protesting farmers this week.Read the story here.3) GST Council lowers tax rates for 66 items, including insulin, printers and incense sticksThe GST Council lowered tax rates on 66 items such as pickles, incense sticks, some movie tickets and printers after industries and states complained that the goods will become too expensive when the new indirect taxation system kicks in from July 1. The panel, chaired by Union finance minister Arun Jaitley and consisting of his counterparts from all states, had divided almost all goods and services into four tax brackets when it last met in Srinagar in May. But a number of industries opposed the tax classification, and Jaitley said that the panel had received a request to review the levies.Read the story here.4) Congress leader apologises after gali ka gunda remark against army chiefCongress leader Sandeep Dikshit on Sunday withdrew his controversial statement made on army chief General Bipin Rawat and tendered an apology for the same.

Therefore, timely announcement of minimum support prices (MSP) for pulses prior to the sowing season is of great importance, according to a study conducted by the M S Swaminathan Research Foundation . ""Announcement on MSP for pulses ideally in June-July can have a significant impact on farmers' choice of crops,"" it said.India produced over 106 million tons of rice and over 95 million tons of wheat in 2013-14. This is about 10 million tons higher than the demand for each of these crops. In the same period, we produced just about 19 million tons of pulses which reduced to 17.5 million tons in 2014-15, although there is annual demand of about 24 million tons of pulses. ""This deficit situation in pulses exists, because there is a much more efficient system for procurement and a lucrative MSP for rice and wheat. India currently has a policy in place for five pulses only - tur, moong, urad, lentil and gram. Further, there is need to ensure that the MSP actually reaches the farmer and is not exploited by middlemen. State governments could explore special schemes for pulses in respective states,"" the study said.Recent analysis by the multi-country LANSA consortium project led by MSSRF showed that as per the National Sample Survey 61st and 68th rounds, only Himachal Pradesh met the daily requirement of 40 grams of pulses.States like Jharkhand, Rajasthan and West Bengal , did not even meet 50% of the norm set for daily protein intake. In a country, 34 per cent of children are underweight (NFHS-4), pulses are important to address malnutrition.The study further recommends ensuring availability through Public Distribution System and increasing consumption of less popular but more nutritious pulses.""Since pulses need less than one-fifth the water rice requires, they are also water-smart. Getting farmers to grow pulses is important to increase income, reduce water for farming and improve nutritional status. In the current year, we may face a deficit monsoon. So announcing a remunerative MSP for pulses may be the way ahead. It is time to make this announcement now,"" it said."

While the acceptable levels of lead in blood are pegged at less than 0.05 mg/litre for children and less than 0.25 mg/litre for adults, the presence of the element varied from a minimum of 5 times (in fish) to 2,911 times (in vegetable) of that limit.File picture. The presence of lead in samples of fish was found to vary approximately between 5 to 71 times higher than the permissible limits in adults and 26 to 356 times the limit suitable for children. (HT Photo)The GSI team identified diesel exhausts of the city traffic and soil in the nearby areas where vegetable is grown as the major sources of excessive lead. The lead has come from diesel exhausts. This type of study is rare in the world. A few have been conducted in the US and France. A new machine has helped us to pinpoint diesel as the chief source of lead and there is no ambiguity in the findings, Dipayan Guha, director of geochronology and isotope geology division of GSI told HT.The outcome of the study, conducted by project director Dipayan Guha and a team of six scientists, was published in Environmental Science and Technology and Environmental Science and Pollution Research. The studies began in 2014 and continued till March 2016.Read: How indoor air pollution is leading to stunted growth in Indias childrenIn rice the presence of lead was a minimum of seven times (of the limits for adults) to a maximum of 30 times. It implied a level that is 36 times to 149 times of the safe limits for children. The presence of the element in chicken is as high as 38 times the permissible limit for adults and 191 times of that for kids.Samples of rice were found to contain lead that was 58 times more than the permissible limit for adults and 287 times of the ceiling for children. (HT Photo)The maximum Pb concentration in rice was 14.39 mg/kg in the Khidirpur sample from west Kolkata. Vegetables sold in the sampled markets had a Pb concentration ranged from a low of 3.28 mg/kg to a very high value of 145.47 mg/kg, read a GSI statement.The GSI team collected samples of polished rice, red lentil (masoor dal), chicken, fish (without scales), spinach, biscuits, spices (cumin seeds) and tulsi from 12 roadside markets from north, south, east and west of Kolkata.Even if one washes the items in water, one can get rid of 50% of the lead, said Guha.Read: Killer in the air: WHO says polluted environments kill 1.7 mn children a yearThe maximum concentration of lead was found in the soil at and near Dhapa, the citys principal dumping ground.The GSI team also found the lead content in the street dust alarming. The mean concentration of Pb found in the 29 sites was 383.2 mg/kg with a range from 23.82 mg/kg to a very high value of 2,697.24 mg/kg at Amherst Street in north Kolkata, a GSI release said.The GSI spokesperson told HT that they chose samples from the roadside markets since common people buy from these.Since much of the contamination is caused by exposure to air, one can expect that packaged items sold in closed conditions will have less lead, said the spokesperson.Kalyan Rudra, chairman of the state Pollution Control Board, told HT there was no immediate relief in sight. CNG is not available in Kolkata and is only expected to reach here in 2020. Even after it reached the city, it will take a lot of time for the commercial vehicles to switch from diesel to CNG. The autorickshaws, however, have already to LPG, said Rudra."
5a1518099855b76bf13eaeb2,Branding the humble Khichdi cooks up mishmash of a debate,http://www.newindianexpress.com/thesundaystandard/2017/nov/05/branding-the-humble-khichdi-cooks-up-mishmash-of-a-debate-1692210.html,2017-11-05,"New Delhi: Its not often that a common mans food becomes fodder for debate on social media and the Internet. But thats exactly what the humble khichdi has done these past few days.A day after union food processing minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal christened khichdi as the Brand India Food on November 1, it began topping Twitter trends and became a much-searched word on the Internet, according to Google Trends. Heated debates started on the elevated status summarily thrust on the dish as well as the point of doing so.But as this khichdi was cooking, The Sunday Standard was left wondering whether an over-ambitious attempt had been made to define India, a land of over 1.3 billion people with widely varying taste buds, by a single dish.Harsimrats announcement set off a flurry of heated debates, unending speculation and conflicting opinions over the culinary identity of India and the unilateral attempt to define its food by one dish. Regardless, khichdi basked in new-found glory as the Prime Minister inaugurated World Food India on November 3, a three-day event aimed at attracting $10 billion in investment.Alongside, naysayers had a field day lambasting the minister for her announcement while supporters acknowledged the importance of making the dish a brand ambassador. In the last few days, khichdi has possibly been spoken of more than it has been eaten.While I enjoy khichdi, to make it a Brand India dish is an overestimation. It is a certainly a comfort food, but not Indias favourite comfort food. Such generalizations are inaccurate and take away from our pluralistic essence, said Gaurav Pathan, a rice mill worker whose factory is on the outskirts of Delhi, near Sonipat.Social media, meanwhile, went on overdrive. Khichdi to be national dish. Why? Is the nation ill? said one. Do I have to stand up when I eat khichdi now that it is a national dish? was another. Why khichdi? I would want aloo methi to finally get its due, said yet another.But between wit and humour lies a deeper narrative of how fundamentally undemocratic such decisions are. Raju Mohapatra, a diamond sorter in Karol Bagh, said, I dont understand how one person in power suddenly gets up and starts deciding things on behalf of the country. Was there a poll, a study done to conclude that khichdi is the most-liked comfort food?Piyush Jain, chef at Molecule restaurant, said that if khichdi was popular, so were biryani, pulao, chicken curry and dal tadka. So, to say that khichdi is the only dish that can represent Indias food tradition is incorrect, he said.Two days after elevating the khichdi from a sick mans food to a national delicacy, Harsimrat said her intention was to replace the curry with khichdi as the quintessential Indian dish.But isnt replacing one dish by another fatuous? In a few years, khichdi will become the new curry. Will we once again think of something new? asked Santosh Kumar, a sales representative with an electronics company.He is exasperated at the remark that khichdi is a neutraliser. I lived in Telangana for 13 years where I was working at a light manufacturing company. There, I was introduced to the regions famous kheema khichdi. Its a rich rice dish made with basmati rice, lentils, meat and chicken stock. Are these ingredients affordable to the poor?It is important to understand that the dish doesnt remain in its humble form in every region, and therefore, cannot be the staple. Besides, has everyone forgotten that dal, a main component of khichdi, is often out of the reach of the poor? asked Kumar.Master chef Sanjeev Kapoor, who has been curating Food Street, an experience zone within World Food India 2017, begged to differ. Khichdi has been celebrated and relished for years in India. From khichuri in West Bengal to Ven Pongal in Kerala, khichdi has united India in geographical expanse with its flavour and recipes through dynasties.It is definitely one of the most loved dishes in India and the world record only aims at making it popular on an international level. Therefore, its declaration as the Brand India food is fair, he said.Indias distinctness has always been its diversity. Flavours from the North, South, East and West have all contributed to create its globally loved cuisine. So, was it inappropriate to grant a single dish such exalted status?"
5aeb24c89855b7179ad71a8a,Sweet somethings,http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/west-bengal-gi-registration-kolkata-rasagolla-odisha-4940866/,2017-11-17,"Crafting a spongy rosogolla does require dexterity. (Illustration: CR Sasikumar) Crafting a spongy rosogolla does require dexterity. (Illustration: CR Sasikumar)In the last decade of the 19th century, the food aficionado Bipradas Mukhopadhyay compiled what was then regarded as the definitive list of Bengali sweetmeat recipes. Mishtanna Pak (cooking of sweets), Mukhopadhyays two-volume magnum opus, goes into copious details while giving instructions on preparing sweetmeats, many of which are obscure today. It lists more than 25 varieties of the sandesh. But Mukhopadhyay  whose more famous work, Pak Pranali, has been described by the sociologist Krishnendu Ray as the first truly popular modern Bengali cookbook  is way less effusive about the rosogolla. It finds a mention only in the discussion on sugar syrups.Rosogolla is prepared by mixing one ser (equivalent to 933 grammes) chhana (cottage cheese) with one ser sugar syrup. Small amounts of cardamom and rose water are added. One ser rosogolla requires four times of its quantity of syrup so that the chhana balls can float easily. The sugar syrup should be prepared very carefully so as to prevent it from becoming concentrated. The chhana should be fresh and absolutely free from moisture. It should be kneaded properly to squeeze the water out of it, notes the Mishtanna Pak. The West Bengal government cited this discussion in the 19th century cookbook as evidence for rosogallas origin in the state when it applied to the Registrar of Intellectual Properties for the Geographical Index (GI) tag for the sweetmeat.By most accounts, the Bengali passion for sweetmeats made from chhana is less than three centuries old. Food writer Chitrita Banerjee believes that confectioners in the state may have been trained by Portuguese colonists in the use of cottage cheese. But even into the mid-19th century there is no mention of the sandesh or rosogolla, Banerji writes in her classic, Life and Food in Bengal. She believes that these sweets were probably devised by professional sweat-makers during the latter half of the 19th century. However, its also well-known that in about a century, the two sweets had become emblematic of gastronomy, so much so that a ban on chhana sweets in 1965 by West Bengals then chief minister, Prafulla Chandra Sen  to deal with a milk shortage  evoked strong protests from Calcuttas confectioners. According to contemporary accounts, the artisans employed by the confectioners did not know how to make sweets other than sandesh and rosogolla.In their recent gastronomic kerfuffle with foodies from neighbouring Odisha, Bengali rosogolla buffs often extol the skills of these sweetmeat artisans. Crafting a spongy rosogolla does require dexterity. The chhana balls should be soft but firm enough so that they are not broken while coming in contact with each other, cautions the Mishtanna Pak. Judicious addition of different agents in measured quantity is a major responsibility of the experienced artisans, notes the West Bengal governments GI application. It likens the role of the artisan to the conductor of an orchestra, who knows how to direct it to a flawless conclusion.Bengals upper-caste sweet aficionados have, however, had an ambivalent attitude to the sweet meat artisan, the moira. According to Banerji, tradition pictures the moira as a huge immobile mountain of flesh sitting in front of his stove or in front of a huge platter which he manipulates with the ease of long practice. He is utterly oblivious to all else in the world and so satiated with his products that he never touches them himself. Other accounts are at odds with such benign imagery. Historian Utsa Ray writes that confectioners, who generally belonged to the lower castes, were an object of disgust for the middle-class. She quotes a petition to the Bengal government in the mid-19th century which describes moiras as men more concerned with their own interests than the health and lives of their buyers. Moiras were also accused of being dirty and unhygienic, by R.C. Day, a physician writing in the 1920s.It was one such moira who is credited in numerous accounts as the creator of the rosogolla  as the Bengalis know it. According to the Oxford Companion to Sugar and Sweets, The story goes that Nobin Moira belonged to a family of gur traders that had fallen on bad times. After at least one false start, he opened a shop in the Bagbazaar district of North Kolkata. Two kinds of sweets were popular at that time, sandesh and sweets made of lentils. An account written much later notes that patrons were bored and demanded something different. So Nobin came up with the rosogolla.But like most items, pinpointing rosogollas origins is a difficult  and as the Odisha-West Bengal contest over the sweetmeat shows  and fraught endeavour. Even in Bengal, there are several accounts about the rosogollas origin. Food historian Pranab Ray believes that the sweet was introduced a few years before Nobin Moiras creation by a confectioner who traded his wares in front of the Calcutta High Court. An early 20th century account, Nadia Kahini, quoted by Utsa Ray claims a rather fortuitous origin for the syrupy sponge balls: Rosogolla is not more than 50/60 years old. Haradhan Moira used to make sweets for the landlord. His little daughter was crying. In order to pacify her, Haradhan dropped some cottage cheese in the sugar syrup that was boiling on the stove. The result was a fine product. The zamindars named it rosogolla.In her work on American cheese-making, anthropologist Heather Paxson argues that cheese artisans have a tradition of inventing. The different, and contesting, accounts of rosogollas origins testify to such ingenuity  of Bengals moiras and Odishas sweet makers. But a GI tag runs counter to inventiveness. It binds artisanal production to strict standards of authenticity  and origin. A 2006 paper by trade economist Ben Shephard argued that the strict GI standards were making it difficult for French wine-makers to cater to tastes of New World Consumers. It will be a pity if such a fate befell Nobin Moiras successors.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"
