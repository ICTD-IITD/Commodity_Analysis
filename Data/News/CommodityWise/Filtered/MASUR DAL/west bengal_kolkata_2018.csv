Farmers Still Cold to Nano Plot,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/was-the-singur-protest-for-nothing-farmers-still-cold-to-nano-plot/story-3cHpNuRnbOAuUGlJUmWlPK.html,2018-01-31,"More than a year after West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee gave back to farmers the land on which Tatas Nano car plant was built, a major chunk of the 997.11-acre plot remains uncultivated.Cattle graze on large swathes as weeds run wild. Crops barely cover about 250 acres of the reclaimed land, Hindustan Times found during a recent visit to Singur. My plot of land is unfit for farming, said Amar Santra, a resident of Khaserbheri village that was the epicenter of the two-year-long land agitation that saw the Tata group abandon the plant in 2008. Last year, the monsoon washed away most of the topsoil, baring the remains of a concrete structure several feet below, Santra said. Other farmers, too, had similar complaints.Most of the plot was fit for cultivation, Pradip Majumdar, the chief ministers principal adviser on agriculture, countered.Farming resumed on more than 500 acres within months of the buildings being razed, he said. We have proven it beyond doubt that the land can still yield gold. If there still are some patches with construction remains, well get things right, Majumdar said.Banerjee, who was at the forefront of the stir against land acquisition for the car plant, had in October 2016 sowed potato seeds during the handover in perhaps the first instance of an industrial land being reconverted to farm land in India.But farming is yet to catch up.Of the 56 mini-deep tubewells installed by the state government, only 20 are operational.In November 2017, the Hooghly district magistrate issued a fresh notice, inviting farmers to work in the fields. Only 50 of the 630 applicants turned up till January 8. In Khaserbheri, fields are a favourite hunting ground for scrap-dealers, as iron rods jut out of the ground. In Bajemelia and Gopalnagar villages, acres are still submerged under the water after last years monsoon.According to Beraberi panchayat chief Dipankar Ghosh, nearly a third of the land needed to be worked on. His views were echoed by KGD gram panchayat chief Tapan Bag. Some of those who had sown potato, lentils and mustard during October-November 2016 also farmed the monsoon paddy in 2017. However, after monsoon wrecked havoc, many of them refrained from sowing the winter crop, said Uttam Das, the agriculture coordinator of Gopalnagar gram panchayat.Singur MLA Rabindranath Bhattacharya said he had informed the authorities about the need to redevelop parts of the land. When asked why bulk of the plot had not been cultivated, Majumdar said, There could be other reasons, refusing to elaborate on them.Some locals, though, had the answer. Many farmers turned plumbers, bricklayers, carpenters and mechanics in the 10 years  the land was acquired in 2006 and returned in 2016  they were away from their fields.People like Dipankar Das, who is now a carpenter, are earning a lot more. He would continue with both  farming in the morning and carpentry noon onwards  once his plot was ready, Das said.None will admit this because it will raise questions on why were all so keen to get their land back if they were switching professions anyway, said a 57-year-old resident of Gopalnagar Ghoshpara, whose sons now work in a garment factory in Howrah. He didnt wish to be identified, fearing a backlash.Local politicians and a section of the administration are hopeful that more people will return to till the land when sowing season begins in March and the monthly compensation of Rs 2,000 will wind down. The dole was started by the Banerjee government in 2011 for farmers who refused the compensation in 2006."

And Mumbai is a city that opens its arms to people from all over the country.Today, on Assamese, Bengali, Odiya and Malayali New Year, BT speaks to four young women from these communities, who live far away from home, yet have kept their culture and tradition alive. Read onTanvi Nair might have lived in Mumbai for a very long time, but her heart lies in her homeland, Kerala. It is this constant pining to go back to where she belongs, that makes her celebrate Vishu and other festivals with fervour. My family has taught me how important such festivals are, to remain connected to our roots. Its not the distance, but the feeling of oneness that matters. The day begins by looking at the Vishukani, where auspicious things  a vessel containing fruits, rice, a mirror, gold and cash  are arranged.Its symbolic of prosperity and happiness. This is followed by a grand sadya (traditional feast) with near and dear ones in the afternoon. Another popular tradition is Vishu Kaineettam  elders giving money as a token of love and blessing to the younger ones. The festival serves as an opportunity for family members staying across the city to come together and recreate a mini version of what it would be like in Kerala. Our elders have invested their time and effort in passing down to us the significance of being connected to our homeland, and it applies to life as a whole. It is our responsibility to be more aware of our roots and pass on the same learnings to future generations, explains Tanvi Nair, the young dancer and PR professional.Sutapa Singha from Kolkata shifted base to Mumbai a couple of years ago, after marriage. There is something about Mumbai... every festival here is celebrated with gusto, says the writer by profession. Sutapa feels that Poila Boishakh is all about bonding with her loved ones. Its mostly about families. And new clothes, of course. I spend the day with my husband and try to meet up with other Bengali friends living in the city. We sing together and enjoy khaati Bangali adda over cups of tea. And, theres always a couple of new outfits in our wardrobe. Ask her how she stays connected to her roots and Sutapa explains, Food is a big connector. One or the other Bong friends is sure to make some pithe puli on this day. And if a Bong has her favourite foods in front of her, it doesnt matter if she is in Kolkata or Mumbai. Of course, I miss my parents and my sister. And my moms special paatishapta with chocolate filling. But, thats alright because I make up for it during the Puja holidays.For actress Plabita Borthakur, Bihu is all about donning the traditional attire. Back home in Duliajan (in the Dibrugarh district of Assam), Plabita would go berserk dancing to Bihu tunes with troops that would drop by for a quick performance. I love wearing mekhela sador (traditional Assamese attire), I wear it sometimes anyway. I make sure I wear one on Bohag Bihu and listen to a couple of Bihu songs to get the feel of the festival. And I definitely cheat on my diet on this day. I used to love applying jetuka (mehendi) and dancing with the different husori (is a group of people dressed in traditional attire, touring peoples homes  singing, dancing and wishing them well for the year ahead) teams that would come over.Just like any other ambitious person, Debdutta Mohanty moved out of her Rourkela home 10 years ago. Although a decade has passed by, but for her, Pana Sankranti , even to this day, is about making the cooling drink this festival is named after. Its been a long time I have been away from Odisha. Back home, we used to visit Shiv and Hanuman temples. In Mumbai, we go to the ISKCON temple and enjoy traditional food. The festival has derived its name from a cooling drink call pana, made out of bela (wood apple), grated coconut, chhenna (grated paneer) and jaggery. Other than that, we prepare rice, khichdi, dalma (lentils mixed with different vegetables) and mixed vegetable (called ghanta in Odiya), says Debdutta, a freelance journalist, matter-of-factly."
5aea8dd19855b73f522c08ec,"No toilet, no school, no proper roads: ‘Forgotten’ groups say they will not vote",http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/kolkata/bengal-panchayat-elections-no-toilet-no-school-no-proper-roads-forgotten-groups-say-they-will-not-vote-5138713/,2018-04-16,"At an enclave in Cooch Behar, prior to the pact. (Express Archive) At an enclave in Cooch Behar, prior to the pact. (Express Archive)A school, a health centre, a drainage system, proper roads, and toilets. Pradeep Burmans family of ten and other residents of Kokoyabari in Cooch Behar were promised these basic facilities along with legal documents for their lands under schemes of the state and central governments. For Kamaleshwar Sarkar, 40, who lives with his family in a makeshift refugee colony in Haldibari, a job and a home now seem a distant dream. In Bangladesh, he used to work for a pharmaceutical company, while his wife was a nurse. Today, he runs a toto (e-rickshaw) to fend for his family, which depends heavily on monthly government rations that he terms as too less.Burman, 26, and Sarkar are among former residents of Bangladeshi enclaves in India and Indian enclaves in Bangladesh, who settled in in Cooch Behar after a historic pact between the two countries. On August 1, 2015, over 14,000 people in 37 enclaves got new identities and the promise of a better future after India and Bangladesh agreed on an enclave exchange. In Kokoyabari, most residents, including Burman, have had to construct makeshift toilets while they wait to get proper ones under the Swachh Bharat scheme. Without a school in the area, most children must trek to the nearest primary school, which is is two-and-a-half km away, or the nearest higher secondary school, which is 5 km away, Burman said.Everyone seems to have forgotten us. Just before the polls, some government people come and measure the land. Then they disappear. There are no proper roads. Aanganwadi centres are yet to open. People are yet to get papers for their lands. Here, people have small plots of one or two bighas each, said 66-year-old Bijendranath Burman, a resident of Falanpur, speaking to The Indian Express over phone. Burman was the president of the erstwhile Chit Nagarik Suraksha Committee, which fought for the cause of enclaves until an agreement with India was reached.According to Burman, small agricultural holdings in Falanpur add up to 506 acres, while in Nalgram they stand at a total of 1,393 acres. None of the residents in these areas have received the required papers yet. All we have are only a few tubewells and some solar-powered pump sets for irrigation. Even the voter ID cards given to us have a lot of anomalies and dont contain proper addresses. So many political parties are knocking on our doors now. But we have all decided not to vote in the panchayat polls. We feel cheated. In the newspapers, we read money has been sanctioned, but we see little on ground, said Burman.Official sources said Falanpur has a total population of 2,700, of which over 500 are voters. The ruling Trinamool Congress has blamed BJP for inciting the former enclave dwellers and hatching a conspiracy. All-round development has happenedBut it takes some time. BJP is going to these areas and inciting, misleading people Roads are being built, Aanganwadi centres are being set up, electrification in the areas where they live is complete. The government is building apartments for those who do not have land and have come from the Bangladesh enclaves. Their children are going to nearby schools. The government is also giving rations. We are talking to them and we are confident we will be able to convince them to vote, said North Bengal Development Minister Rabindranath Ghosh, MLA and the Trinamool Congress district president of Cooch Behar.The anger of former enclave dwellers is justified. Little has happened. Only some roads and some tubewells. Their land rights are a major issue. Most of them do not have land rights papers for their own fields. The government is planning to give them small apartments whereas they want the land to build a home. Schools, jobs promised are yet to be delivered. This, even though the central government has sanctioned money. We have highlighted the matter with the Centre, said Nikhil Ranjan Dey, BJP district president of Cooch Behar.Sarkar and his three brothers stay in a makeshift shelter in Haldibari, where six to seven family members stay in a single room. The brothers take turns to run two totos. Roy claimed the family receives 30 kg rice, 5 litres mustard oil, 5 kg kerosene, 5 kg masur dal, 2 kg of salt and 2 litres of milk monthly from the government. There are no schools here. There is no proper drainage system and no proper road. The government promised us employment and skill development through various projects, including animal husbandry and pisciculture. They promised to give us land too. Nothing happened. Many here are working as labourers to fend for their families. I left a job in a medicine company, and my wife, that of a nurse. So many times we have approached the BDO and SDO, nothing happened, said Sarkar, claiming that his community had recently held a meeting and decided to abstain from voting.Roy and his family hail from an enclave in Bangladeshs Debigunj under Panchagarh. They had come to the Haldibari camp on November 27, 2015. There are 530 people (105 families) in the camp, of which 362 are voters, sources said. Roys wife, Kanika, said the low-cost apartments promised to them are still under construction. Each apartment has only one room for families with six or seven members, she added.Our surname is Roy, but somehow, after we got our voter IDs, it was written Sarkar there, she further claimed. At Nalgram, another former enclave, there are 969 voters in a population of 1,800, official sources said. Residents contacted by The Indian Express said they are yet to get papers for their lands, which is their prime demand.I have a family of six. I have two-bigha land, but I am yet to get papers from the government even after three years. We also demand a proper road and a health centre. We will not vote this time. We have voted in the 2016 assembly polls, before which voter ID cards were hurriedly issued to us. But this time, we will not, said Debicharan Adhikari (42), a resident of Nalgram near Mathabhanga in Cooch Behar.Burman, whose family has two-and-a-half bighas of land at Kokoyabari, said almost none of the announced government schemes have reached the ground so far. There are so many government schemes, but we are yet to benefit. We were promised toilets under Swacch Bharat. But that never happened. Some of us used our own money and set up toilets. So many government officials came, media took our pictures, but then everyone forgot us. We are fed up with the false promises. We still have no means of drinking water or a proper drainage system, he said.Kokoyabari has 52 voters from 16 families, official sources said.For all the latest Kolkata News, download Indian Express App"
5b153cf09855b76246385864,From the house of Mr Biswas!,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/from-the-house-of-mr-biswas/article23859553.ece,2018-05-12,"I went chasing a rainbow, and actually found a pot of gold at the end of it. It was one of those days when there was talk of rain. We thought it called for a nice meal, ordered in, but we were not keen on having Chinese. I felt a Bengali meal would be a good idea, but the local Bengali food takeaway was a bit disappointing when we had last placed an order from there.So I thought I would go looking for Prinsep 21. I had heard about it and had been following it up on the internet. But the place in Noida did not deliver to Mayur Vihar, so I knew that if I had to try the food out, I had to make a visit there. So, that day when the weather  sultry but promising rain  demanded a memorable meal, I went trudging towards Noida in the heat.And I am glad I did  for it turned out to be best Bengali meal Ive had in a very long time. The dhoka  a curried dish of steamed lentil cakes  was so delicious that I made sure some was left over for my breakfast the next morning. That was certainly the first time ever I had dhokar dalna for breakfast!But before I get to the food, let me tell you about the place. Prinsep 21 is in Noida, Sector 51 (Phone numbers: 08010360859and 8470880448). I called one of the numbers up a few times to find the place. The take-away is run from a small room with an attached kitchen in a lane.Wielding a deft karchi is Mrs Biswas. Handling the orders is Mr Biswas. And lending a helping hand is their daughter, Bipasha (and occasionally the son-in-law). The Biswas takeaway offers most of the dishes that Bengalis go gaga over  from mustard rahu to prawn malai curry and from aloo posto to chholar dal.I asked for some rohu jhol, dhokar dalna, chicken rezala and mango chutney. They added aloo bhaja to the food packet.I had a delicious dinner that evening. The potato fries  called jhurjhurey aloo bhaja  were wafer thin and crunchy, and I wished Id ordered some moong dal to go with it. The gravy in the rezala, with plump and juicy pieces of chicken in it, was light, yet full of flavours, with the yoghurt giving it a mildly tart taste. The fish, again large pieces, had been cooked with basic spices  a pinch of cumin seeds, coriander, green chillies and mustard, and was again excellent. But the dhokar dalna took the cake, if you would pardon the pun. The steamed lentil cakes were incredibly soft, full of juices and just lightly spiced. Even the next morning, when I ate them for breakfast, they were as soft as ever.The chutney was sweet and sour, and was a happy end to what was a delightful meal.Mr Biswas told me that their menu depends on whats freshly available. If there is good hilsa or pabda at CR Park, he buys them, and then they are cooked for the day. The menu includes some of the old specialities that are not easily available in Bengali eateries  such as a dish called muri-ghonto, fish head cooked with rice. Some old favourites are also there  such as Kolkata biryani, mutton dak bungalow with eggs and kosha mangsho.The rates are fair. Chicken rezala is for Rs. 240, rui jhol for Rs. 300, dhokar dalna for Rs. 190 and mango chutney for Rs. 70.They have chops, fish fillet fried and pea-filled kachoris, too. There is a whole pomfret on the menu, along with various kinds of fish including mustard pabda.I am happy to have found Prinsep 21  the house of Mr Biswas."
5b137c6e9855b762ecebc9c8,Maharashtra: Mango tasting farms soar high on popularity list of travellers,http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/mumbai/mango-tasting-farms-soar-high-on-popularity-list-of-travellers-5174633/,2018-05-13,"A group of travellers at a farm in Nate, Ratnagiri. (Express) A group of travellers at a farm in Nate, Ratnagiri. (Express)WHEN Nikiti Nagori (23) sipped a glass of Alphonso amras (mango pulp) at a Ratnagiri-based mango farm last weekend, she couldnt stop at one. While the Kolkata-based corporate lawyer has relished Alphonso mangoes at her office in Mumbai, she confesses nothing matches the joy of plucking mangoes from farms and having them amidst nature.In the last couple of weeks, an increasing number of travellers have visited farms in Konkan region and Dapoli to experience the natural taste of the king of fruits. While some prefer to drive to the farms, many tour groups are organising mango tasting sessions in these farms.Last weekend, we took a bunch of 15 travellers to an agro-based farm in Nate in Ratnagiri. During the tour, they were given a complete tutorial on how mangoes are cultivated, the time it takes for the fruit to ripen and when is the apt time to pluck them. The locals who worked at these farms act as our guides, Mahesh Kumar from Ramblers India Group, which organises treks for travellers, said.With urban travellers preferring to opt for farm visits, Kumar decided to introduce mango tasting in his three-day tour of Konkan region. The group relished mango products, including aamras and pickles in their lunch, and hoarded boxes of mangoes on their way back to enjoy them during summer, he said.While tourists from Mumbai, Pune and other parts of Maharashtra are regulars at such tours, travellers from other areas like Gujarat, Delhi, Karnataka, and Chennai and even foreign tourists flock to these quaint Maharashtra farms to relish mangoes cultivated in the Konkan belt, tour organisers said. A quick getaway from the routine and the urge to taste fresh produce from the farm drives them, they added.This is the first time I have visited a farm. Our group would have plucked hundreds of mangoes. The joy of eating a fresh mango, and that too amidst its natural surroundings, cannot be compared to anything. It is an unique experience, Nagori said.Cashing in on the demand, prominent travel websites are arranging special trips to mango farms in Raigad, Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg.

5b26a9229855b70a272af880,Scent of a lemon,https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/scent-of-a-lemon-231659?ref=india-new-stry,2018-05-20,"Paromita SenEXSQUEEZE MOI: The gondhoraj is not full of juice like the acid lime, nor as easy to come by as the kagzi. Photo by Subhendu ChakiThe gondhoraj, quite literally means the sultan of aroma. Even king of fragrance is a fair translation but it doesn't really do justice to the majesty of it.We are, of course, talking limes. From the football-sized grapefruit to the golf-ball sized acid lime, India has been blessed with plenty. There is the large, loose-skinned Nagpur orange, the yellow-green mosambi, the juicy kagzi, the small but sweet Darjeeling orange, naarthangai that is always pickled, the large, slightly bitter chakotra or pomelo, the Malta that grows in the northern hills, the sweet-tart sweet lemon grown mostly down South... But none of these compares to the innate kingliness of the gondhoraj.Most traditional meals in eastern India, celebratory or otherwise, start with a wedge of lemon and a pinch of salt. If you did not want to squeeze the tart fruit over any of the dishes, you could always use it at the end to wash the oiliness off your hands. Intimate meals always feature the gondhoraj - in a bowl that it shares with green chillies.Considering the sheer variety of limes available in India, it is a mystery why it is used so little in cooking. It is tamarind that is the primary souring agent in eastern India, yoghurt in the north and kokum in the South - the lime is restricted to sherbets and pickles.Not that the gondhoraj would be a great souring agent - it tends to lose its beautiful fragrance when heated. Says food historian Pritha Sen, ""The lime has always been used as a condiment, never the star ingredient."" But that might be changing.Pass a grove of gondhoraj - or even a single tree - and, like a royal fanfare, it announces it presence with a whiff of that distinct scent - clean, citrusy, with an undertone of floral sweetness.This fragrance is most intense in the oval, bright green and shiny leaves - in fact, they were used to flavour the gondhoraj bhaat, where the leaves are layered with the rice. When there were no limes in the garden, the leaves were used to flavour the pulses - masur dal or bhaja moong dal.The dark green limes are, of course, always in great demand. As they ripen, they turn a smooth light green and acquire a little juice. Not that you want a whole lot of gondhoraj juice - it is extremely sour. The gondhoraj, like kingly favour, is best savoured in small doses.The gondhoraj is actually a native of Rangpur, a hilly area in the northern part of Bangladesh - bordered on one side by Assam and the other by West Bengal - with rich golden soil. It used to grow wild there.It was possibly a poor foodie who discovered that his simple meal of overnight rice ( panta bhaat) and green chillies became a feast for the senses when flavoured with the leaves of the hardy lime tree.The Rangpur lime, a natural hybrid born off a Mandarin orange and a citron, has been known in Indian cuisine since the Mughal era, says Rishi Krishna De, assistant director in the department of agriculture of the West Bengal government. It has since migrated to the tables of the rich and thence, in the recent past, to the kitchens of fine dining restaurants.Found in the eastern part of the country, it is grown commercially in Bengal, Assam and Tripura, as well as in gardens across the country.All the citrus fruit in the world can trace their roots to the Indian subcontinent. In fact, it was the citron - father of the gondhoraj - that first travelled out of India with Alexander the Great. When it reached Europe, it was named the Citrus medica for its curative properties. The Rangpur lime, too, has travelled; among other places to Florida in the US, where it is called the Mandarin lime and grown primarily as a hardy ornamental plant that can withstand low temperatures.If you Google Rangpur lime, scientific name Citrus limona, you are sure to be disappointed. It shows a round, orange fruit that looks nothing like the green, oblong, thick-skinned gondhoraj we know and love. Pictures do not say the whole story; if you can lay your hands on a Rangpur lime, you will recognise its sweet, citrusy fragrance at once."" Gondhoraj limes are plucked before they ripen. That is why they are green in colour,"" says De. ""If left to ripen on the tree, they will turn bright yellow."" The gondhoraj that is commercially grown is usually not pure Rangpur lime but lime that has been cross-bred to be smaller in size.The thick-skinned fruit is a table lime, its fragrant but scanty juice usually squeezed over rice. At most, it is used to flavour buttermilk ( gondhoraj ghol) or sherbet. It is its leaf that is used to flavour dal or rice. In that, it resembles its cousin, the Kaffir lime, used generously in Thai cuisine. The rough-skinned Kaffir lime itself is, however, pruned off to get a more lush growth of leaves.These days, however, the gondhoraj is flavouring a host of dishes - from the pioneering Gondhoraj Bhetki to Gondhoraj Chicken to Gondhoraj Sorbet to Gondhoraj Mousse. Vegetable dishes and cocktails, too, have not escaped its influence.""The trick to the best flavour profile from gondhoraj is to get fresh, quality limes and use them fresh,"" says Joymalya Banerjee, chef-owner of the contemporary Bengali cuisine restaurant, Bohemian, in Ballygunge, Calcutta. ""Steaming or heating it to high temperatures kills 90 per cent of the gondhoraj flavour,"" says the man who came up with the recipe for Gondhoraj Bhetki when he was the head chef of the Bengali fine dining restaurant, Oh! Calcutta. ""You can say I was the one who started this trend,"" he says, while pointing out that the idea was Anjan Chatterjee's, the man who owns the Oh! Calcutta chain.Chatterjee once admitted to The Telegraph his obsession with the king of flavour and his tendency to ""follow every waft of citrus scent borne in by the sea breeze"", looking for the elusive gondhoraj. That is how he discovered that apart from the Kaffir lime, the gondhoraj has cousins in China (Canton lime) and Japan (hime). These are varieties of the same family of Rangpur limes, as is the Limao cravo found in Brazil and the Mandarin lime in the US.Replication is the best form of flattery and Chef Joy has got a lot of that. He, however, feels that none of the dishes has been able to get or consistently maintain the flavour profile of the Gondhoraj Bhetki of Oh! Calcutta. As for the Bohemian menu - tired of being referred to as the Gondhoraj Man, a name chef Karen Anand bestowed on him - the chef has taken a few of the gondhoraj dishes off the menu. Yet, the day we visited Bohemian, Gondhoraj Julep was the most ordered mocktail.Bohemian has another popular cocktail, the Gondhoraj Martini. It is flavoured with Gondhoraj Limoncello brewed under Chef Joy's supervision. The lime-rimmed martini glasses add another layer of flavour to the drink.Should not the aroma that improves everything from chicken to alcohol to dessert be given global recognition? Why then has the gondhoraj remained a local phenomenon? According to Chef Joy, that's because no one has yet been able to bottle the volatile oils of the fruit. Without that it is not possible to take the gondhoraj to foreign shores.Agriculture scientist De says gondhoraj stays fresh long enough to be exported but there is no demand for it because it is difficult to squeeze the juice out of it. Gondhoraj lemonades, however, are doing brisk business in foreign lands.While we in India are still discussing the possibility of making the gondhoraj a global flavour, a British company has beaten us to it. Liquor company Diageo has been marketing the Rangpur lime-flavoured Tonquaray Rangpur since 2006. Made in Scotland, this citrus-flavoured gin is most popular in the US. As is the Rangpur lime marmalade - the only way the Americans have made the tart limes palatable.The gondhoraj can only grow in soil that is rich and dark. That is why the Rangpur lime thrives in the dark, volcanic soil of Hawaii, as it does in eastern India. There, the king of fragrance is affectionately called the Kona lime. It is as beloved as the gondhoraj but it is not "" gondhoraj"".The sultan of aroma remains rooted firmly in the clayey soil of the Ganga delta."

In the last eight years the Hindustan Park resident has made the city his home, has given promising musicians and artists a platform called Chaitown Creatives, flown down Angie Miller of American Idol fame for performances, taught vocals at Calcutta School of Music and has conducted several music shows, including the 50th edition of Assembly of God Churchs annual Christmas celebrations last year. The 32-year-old from Boston is currently preparing for Christmas concerts, which will be held next month, and hes writing new music for an album. Heres more from Zac.This is the busiest time of the year since you conduct several music shows in the city. What can we expect at this years Songs of the Season (December 7 to 9), which Assembly of God Church hosts every year?Songs of the Season is one of the longest-running Christmas productions in the city. The 51st SOS will not disappoint. Its a Broadway-style musical filled with wonderful songs, dancing and drama, and the 40-odd members of the choir and cast are working hard. Ive also been working with the Kolkata Symphony Orchestra and the Kolkata Community Choir for their upcoming Christmas concert (December 8 at St. Pauls Cathedral).You have been living in Calcutta for almost eight years and recently returned to writing music. Tell us what inspires you and can we expect an album.There is something so wonderful about India, especially this city; such a sense of togetherness and this marvellous atmosphere of joy. After eight years of living in Calcutta I can proudly claim that a part of me belongs to the city; you cant separate it from my identity. A lot of my writing is coming from my life experiences and lessons Ive learned in the past few years, living in India. Id like to put all the songs Ive been writing into an album and Im pulling in a few friends from Calcutta to collaborate with.You have also spent a couple of years in Mumbai. How do you find the music scene there and in Calcutta?I never really lived full-time in Mumbai, but I did spend a significant amount of time there and I have quite a number of Calcutta friends who have turned Mumbaikars. Although all of them still proclaim loudly there is no city like Calcutta, Mumbai has so many different opportunities for musicians to make a living. To me, though, Calcutta stands out as a city with a deep-rooted passion and love for music.What brought you to Calcutta?We had close family friends who were living here at the time. After finishing my studies, I was given an invitation to work with young musicians, specifically to train vocalists.What was your initial perception of the city?All I knew about Calcutta was that Mother Teresa lived here. I look back and laugh because Calcutta is so much more than that. Amanda and I dated while living in Calcutta; we hosted our wedding reception in Calcutta; and, our son Kaden was born in Calcutta. Hes now 15 months. Calcutta seems like a different world compared to Boston, but what I feel weve done as a family is taken the West and the East and adopted the best of both.How did the journey from Berklee College of Music in Boston to India shape you as a musician and a person?Berklee was a challenging place to study at. I grew a lot as a vocalist studying under some incredible professors. From Berklee to moving to India in 2011, and up until now, there has been a lot of life Ive lived. There have been extremely painful events and extremely joyful events that have taken place in my life. I think one of the greatest lessons Ive learned is finding joy  true joy  and leaning into that joy during lifes painful events. I think losing our daughter Chloe and burying her here in India will still be one of our familys most painful events, and at the same time Kaden being born a year later will be our familys most joyful event. Not just our family, but so many loved ones here walked with us through that pain and joy. This journey of learning to put others first has and will continue to shape me as a person and as a musician. Its definitely shaping how I write and the message I want to get across in the lyrics I sing.What have been some of the milestones for Chaitown Creatives, which you started to bring together artists and musicians?Chaitown was started out of a desire to see young musicians and artists excel; to give training and new platforms. I think one of the milestones is artists collective, which is still going strong after almost three years. Its one of my favourite events that Chaitown hosts.Do you intend to stay on?As for now we are here and based in Calcutta; its our home. We havent put a timeline for our family at this point.Five musicians from Calcutta you cant get enough ofPaloma and Adil  Palomas voice is goldWhale In The Pond and Sourjyo SinhaDavid Mani (singer-songwriter)Deep Phoenix (percussive guitar)Sherman Jackson (pianist from the AG Church)Five places in Calcutta that inspire youRabindra Sarobar, Jorasanko Thakurbari, Prinsep Ghat, the AG Church, north Calcutta (especially Shyambazar)Five things in your wardrobe thats IndianPunjabi kurtas, Kolhapuris, Nehru jackets, Indo-Western suits, dhotiFive Indian/Bengali dishes that have become a household stapleTadka dal (any kind of lentil dish).
