A retired steel plant superintendent, Das has been a walker for almost all his life, but this is his first attempt at a marathon.Every day, for the past two months, he has been running a distance of 21 km in preparation for the marathon. While no other member in his family is part of Sunday's event, they will certainly cheer for him when he crosses the finish line.""Apart from a sugar problem, I don't suffer from any ailment. Regular walking and jogging keeps me in good shape,"" he said.As a senior superintendent at Durgapur Steel Plant in West Bengal, Das, a sports enthusiast, dabbled in football and badminton. ""Even though it has been years since I retired, I keep myself active. I moved to Navi Mumbai seven years ago. The wide open roads here are ideal to stay in shape. My family, especially my wife Ritka, has been supportive of my mission,"" he said.One of the reasons he is able to run at this age is the strict diet regime that he follows. Sangita, his daughter, said he ate within limits and his diet included dry fruits, typical Bengali meals of rice, lentils, vegetables, fish and curd and an occasional dry snack.""I make sure I get proper sleep. I sleep reasonably early since I wake at 5.40am. Then from 6.15am to 9.15am, I jog on the streets,"" he laughed and said.Keeping his body in good shape is not his only mission. His mind, too, needs to stay sharp. Apart from being an avid news watcher, he tutors his grandchildren.""This way my father stays abreast of what is happening around and his mind stays focused,"" added Sangita.His son-in-law, Subhendu, recalls the time Das climbed 17 floors to their residence when the lift was out of order. ""Even younger people struggle to climb so many floors. But he managed it easily,"" said Subhendu.Thrilled to be part of Sunday's marathon, Das can't curtail his excitement. ""This is the first time I am taking part in the marathon and I am so happy to be a part of it,"" he said."
5923306e7be9e01fd59ad0d3,Why drought isn’t grabbing the headlines,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/marathwada-maharashtra-farmer-suicide-why-drought-isnt-grabbing-the-headlines/,2016-03-31,"Drought, in a sense, has only added to the miseries of rural producers who are simultaneously battling the effects of a global commodity crash which has hit agricultural exports and farm prices. Drought, in a sense, has only added to the miseries of rural producers who are simultaneously battling the effects of a global commodity crash which has hit agricultural exports and farm prices.This time it has been a most unusual drought. Even with three consecutive bad crops (kharif 2014, rabi 2015, kharif 2015) and a fourth not-so-great one (thankfully, theres been no big damage from unseasonal rains/hail unlike in March 2015), the annual consumer food price inflation is only 5.3 per cent.In the past, droughts invariably fuelled speculation and hoarding by unscrupulous traders. This time were hardly feeling it in the cities. Barring sugar, where the price increase in recent weeks is more of a correction from unhealthy lows, consumers arent paying all that more for what they are eating compared to a year ago. No ones talking much about onion prices, either. Even arhar dal is selling cheaper than when it consumed the BJP in Bihars assembly elections during October-November; the same goes for urad, moong or masur.Simply put, this is a drought essentially of farmers and rural producers. And since it isnt really pinching urban consumers, politicians even in Maharashtra  where the drought is most acute  have found it more important to discuss whether not chanting Bharat mata ki jai amounts to treason. Incidentally, Asaduddin Owaisis defiant speech that set off this most-important debate was made at Latur in the droughts epicenter of Marathwada!For farmers, the current crisis isnt just of production loss from drought. It is also one of low price realisations. Farmers in Maharashtra are today selling cow milk at Rs 15-16 per litre, compared to Rs 25-26 a year ago.This, despite a severe fodder shortage that would also means higher production costs. In most crops  whether cotton, rubber, basmati, guarseed or even potatoes, apples, kinnow and pineapples  producer realisations are below what they were a couple of years ago. The only reason nobodys talking about onion these days is because the bulb is being sold in Maharashtras Lasalgaon market at below Rs 7/kg, as against Rs 12 last March and Rs 45-plus in early-September when pyaaz was grabbing all the headlines.Drought, in a sense, has only added to the miseries of rural producers who are simultaneously battling the effects of a global commodity crash which has hit agricultural exports and farm prices. That, in turn, also explains why urban consumers arent particularly feeling the heat of the drought: they have been shielded mainly by low global prices. Compare this to the situation in 2007 when international prices were on the boil and we had food riots everywhere, including in places like West Bengal.Right now, the drought is not about agriculture: The current rabi crop  whatever has been planted  is close to being harvested, if it has not already. The more immediate concern, instead, is about drinking water. With two-and-a-half months to go for the monsoon to arrive in the most parched areas and the countrys major reservoirs barely 25 per cent full, meeting peak summer drinking water requirements is going to be a challenge. It will be even more in Marathwada where reservoir water levels are down to 5 per cent of full storage capacity.The one consolation we have is global climate models pointing to a weakening of El Nino, which was the main cause of the 2015 drought. The 2015-16 El Nino was one of the longest, starting around February last. It is even now in a strong phase and is expected to enter neutral zone only towards May, according to the latest forecast of the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Since there is usually a two-month or so lag between its effects translating into actual rainfall, one cannot rule out a delay in the monsoon even if turns out normal.The NOAA is also giving a 50 per cent probability of a La Nina  El Ninos opposite, which is beneficial for the Indian monsoon  developing from August. But that again would deliver good rains not earlier than in the second half of the monsoon. A delayed, but good, monsoon is what seems most likely now. And that would mean a minimum three-month wait before things finally look up.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"
58f493e8a3d24b68099aed7f,To help get GI tags for indigenous art,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/To-help-get-GI-tags-for-indigenous-art/article14544911.ece,2016-08-01,"To protect indigenous art forms and commercial products restricted to a particular area like the Kangri of Kashmir, IIT-Kharagpur will help such communities get Geographical Indication (GI) tags and broad- base the market of their products.Announcing the new project, IIT-Kharagpur Director P. P. Chakrabarti said in the next three to five years, they will identify 100 such products all over the country and help the community get the GI tag.To begin with, the Intellectual Property Cell of the institute has recently taken up activities to facilitate the process of filing of GI for Goyna Bori, the fine art of using lentil paste mix to create exquisite designs, distinct in West Bengals Midnapore.With distinct historical basis dating back several centuries of the Rajbari and also referred by Rabindranath Tagore in his works, Goyna Bori is believed to have originated in Midnapore.Apart from being edible, Goyna Bori is actually more about unique pieces of fine art having great appeal to the eye.Besides sweets from the State, the IIT has also planned to file GI for Kangri, a basket that is traditionally used by the people of Kashmir to keep themselves warm by keeping burning charcoals in it.Patent officeWe have spoken to the patent office that as an institution we want to file GIs. The communities will get the rights. After that we will help them build an economy around it. The entire region will benefit out of this. In the past, India had to fight for intellectual property rights for turmeric. But once these communities get the GI tag they will only have the right to that brand, Dr Chakrabarti said.The IIT model will be a five-year project which will begin after the community gets the GI tag. For the first year, they will pay everything besides the labour cost and from the second year onwards the IIT will start taking back the money in a phased manner.These communities may not be prosperous as others are using the brand value of their product. We will ensure that they make good business out of it, he said, adding that for the project the IPR team will work closely with the local communities.Once the communities get the GI tag then others will not be able to sell the product by claiming it is from that particular region.The geographical indication (GI) tag identifies a product as originating from a particular location and conveys an assurance of quality and distinctiveness that is essentially attributable to the fact of its origin.Once granted, the GI tag prevents unauthorised use of the geographical indication and boosts exports by giving it a unique identity. Products like Dajeeling Tea and Mysore silk are examples of popular GI tags in India. - PTI"
