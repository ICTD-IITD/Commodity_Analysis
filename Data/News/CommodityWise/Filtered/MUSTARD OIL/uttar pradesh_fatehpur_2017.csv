Political parties too have framed special strategies to woo this large chunk of voters. Villages are expected to witness crowded 'chaupals'.The multi-phase elections will begin with notification for the first phase on January 17 and end with voting in phase 7 on March 8, coinciding with a period when farmers have some time on their hands. ""This season wheat has been sown in around 1.24 hectares alone in Agra district and potato in 79 hectares. Harvesting of mustard crop will take place on 30 hectares. Farmers will start harvesting potatoes from around February 25, followed by wheat and mustard in March,"" said deputy director of agriculture, K N Rai.Shyam Singh Chahar, district head of Bharatiya Kisan Union said, ""Farms in Agra and nearby districts are covered with crops of wheat, potato and mustard. Framers will not be having much to do on the fields till first phase of voting on February 11. Farmers will be discussing their issues with the candidates and mark their presence in election rallies and political meetings.""Farmer Manvendra Singh of Kheragarh block said, ""It is after a long time that the election schedule is suitable for farmers. During election campaign days, we will have time to listen and interact with candidates and ask them what they are going to do for agricultural development and welfare of farmers.""This time party workers and candidates will not have to make the round of farms to meet cultivators and seek their vote. During the day, farmers will be either at home or in public places in villages.BJP district president Shyam Bhadoriya said, ""The party in Agra has been in continuous interaction with farmers. Our wing, the BJP Kisan Morcha, has been helping farmers in their time of need. Ahead of elections we are going to organize special chaupals and interact with farmers around bonfires. We will remind farmers of the pro-agriculture initiatives of the central government and note down their grievances."" BSP district head Pramod Raina said, ""We will make farmers aware of the Centre's neglect and farlse promises by the state government. In recent seasons farmers in the region have faced major losses due to harsh weather but the government has not provided any help. Through open meetings the party's plans for welfare of farmers will be conveyed throughout the district."" Congress district president Dushyant Sharma said, ""Party workers are in regular touch with farmers. The Centre's unplanned demonetisation has hit farmers the most. Once votes to power, the Congress will completely waive all pending debt, reduce electricity bills by half and enact other initiatives to relieve the burden on them. Special teams have been constituted at the district level to visit different villages and convey the party's vision for the welfare of farmers."""
58e4a0f9a3d24b136653b8f2,The sisterhood of wrestlers,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/The-sisterhood-of-wrestlers/article17002100.ece,2017-01-07,"Its 3.30 p.m. on a clear day. Balali village, in the Bhiwani district of Haryana, is slowly whirring to life after the siesta. Theres a whiff of mustard in the air as the fields of yellow sway in the gentle breeze. The serenity, however, barely seeps in to a hall adjoining the rabi crop where 11-year-old Komal Sangwan is giving the mats a hurried sweep. In minutes, the hall would be packed with 20-odd children, Komal included, first warming up and then straining their sinews to instructions yelled out from the doorway.The tough taskmaster in question: Mahavir Singh Phogat, father and coach to golden grapplers Geeta and Babita. The father-daughters exploits, known in sporting circles for over half a decade, have entered the national conversation with the Aamir Khan-starrer Dangal , the Bollywood blockbuster thats scripting a new collections high at the box office each passing day.The high notes have been years in the making, literally. When he started training his two eldest daughters in 2000, Mahavir quickly became the black sheep of Balali. My relatives, even my parents, would ask me, Arent you ashamed that you are making pehelwans (wrestlers) out of girls? When I used to say that my daughters would make a name for themselves and make the country proud, people used to laugh, says Mahavir, as he sits outside the wrestling hall, Roxy, his pet pug, sleeping at his feet.They laughed then, but the laughter turned to applause as Geeta and Babita went on to win the gold and silver medals respectively at the 2010 Commonwealth Games in Delhi. Their sisters and cousins, Priyanka, Ritu, Vinesh and Sangita, also followed them into the sport, winning medals at international and national-level competitions.Winds of changeAlong with the Phogat sisters and Sakshi Malik, bronze medal winner at the Rio Olympics in 2016, young girls in the State are increasingly taking to the sport as evidenced by the throng at the small wrestling centre Mahavir built on his land, complete with a running track through the fields, and elsewhere in the State. When I started training my daughters there werent any akharas that allowed girls. Now, there must be at least 50 akharas that train girls, he says.Its not just that attitudes are changing, the State has also been investing in sports infrastructure, even allocating Rs.1.5 crore in the 2016-2017 budget for wrestling mats and weight-training equipment for akharas. Apart from the State governments wrestling centres, the Sports Authority of India also has three training facilities for the sport in Haryana in Hisar, Bhiwani and Sonepat. But there is a lot more to be done. With the right assistance, Mahavir says he can churn out many Geetas. The Haryana Sports Department itself estimates that Rs.2.5 crore is needed to strengthen akharas.At any rate, in a State with the lowest sex ratio in the country and where women have at different points been banned from using cell phones and wearing jeans, the sight of girls wrestling and excelling at the sport has started a conversation. Daya Kaur, Mahavirs wife, has seen it first-hand. From the time my daughters started wrestling to now, I can see some change. But its not the majority that has changed. Many still wish for a boy to be born, and take the birth of a girl in their family as a burden, she says, as she peeks into the wrestling hall while bracing up for the evening chores.Nine-year-old Neha Sangwan, the daughter of Balali sarpanch Amit Kumar Sangwan, has been training with Mahavir for two years. She can do 600 push-ups, says a village elder who is sitting outside and playing cards with friends. Its more like 100, clarifies Neha sheepishly.Sarpanch Sangwan says the fact that young parents like him are encouraging their daughters to train with Mahavir pehelwan  is an indication of change in the village. Its not just wrestling, but girls in the village are getting jobs in the paramilitary forces, in aviation and the government services. Wrestling will open up opportunities for my daughter, he says.For girls like Neha, the next step is to move to a town as training centres there offer better facilities.The Haryana Sports Department runs wrestling centres across the State, with the one at Rohtaks Chhotu Ram Stadium boasting of many famous students, including Sakshi Malik.About 100 students, including 30 girls, train twice a day for up to six hours at the centre. With photos of Sakshi Malik, double Olympic medallist Sushil Kumar and London 2012 medal-winner Yogeshwar Dutt hanging on the walls, the students arent short on inspiration.Most of the girls are aged 16-24 and have come from villages across the State, with their families funding their stay. They live by themselves in Rohtak, in single rooms on rent. A typical day starts at 5 a.m., with the morning training session spanning from 6.30 a.m. to around 9 a.m. Then its back to the room, where they cook, clean and rest before the afternoon session from 3.30 p.m. to around 7 p.m., and back home in time for dinner. Sunday is the only respite from this gruelling schedule, with the luxury of a few extra hours of sleep.For 18-year-old Reena, who has been wrestling for seven years, while attitudes of those around her may be changing, society still needs to. When I started winning medals, the people in my village started looking at me differently. The biggest change was after Sakshi didi s bronze medal in the Olympics. But I feel its superficial support, they dont really believe in us, she says.Back home, girls are married off as soon as they finish Class X, says Reena in the middle of a training break. Their mindset has not changed overall. My village is about 2 km away, but my parents insist that I rent a room in Rohtak just to keep out the taunts of others, she says.The coach at the centre, Mandeep Singh, who also trains Sakshi Malik, however, insists attitudes are changing. Just from talking to parents, we can see the change, he says, as girls as young as eight years old are being dropped off and picked up twice a day at the centre by eager parents.The wrestling boomIf the number of girls who are starting to take up the sport is any indication, then wrestling is booming in Haryana. Coaches and training centres are finding it difficult to accommodate the rush.At Rohtaks Maharshi Dayanand University, about 100 students train under former national-level coach Ishwar Chand Dahiya, who used to run the Chhotu Ram Stadium centre till his retirement a few years ago. It was there that he encountered Sakshi Malik and became her first coach.At a cold early morning session at the universitys wrestling hall, Kiran Ahlawat cant wait to get back on the mat. The 16-year-old injured her shoulder trying to impress the coach and now has to look on while the others practise. Wearing a pink hoodie and matching socks that peep out from a small hole in her shoes, Kiran is among 14 girls who train under Dahiya. When I started training girls in 2003, even my relatives used to say hes gone mad. But I did not treat girls and boys differently, says the genial coach as he watches over the students morning session.One of the beginners at the centre is 11-year-old Sakshi Malik. After her illustrious namesake became the first Indian woman to win an Olympic medal for wrestling, Sakshi decided that she wanted to follow in her footsteps. Every morning before school, and every afternoon after classes get over, she makes her way from her village, Kharawar, which is about half an hour away.For the twenty-somethings, the wrestlers are grappling with the pressure to get married, but not in the same way as their peers. Their families insist that they focus on their game, win accolades and then think of settling down. Medals will give them an upper hand when it comes to prospective suitors, says a coach. For now, the mat is where their focus is.Sudesh Malik, 22, who is from Bhainswal Kalan village in Sonepat district but lives and trains in Rohtak, knows exactly how things have changed for her ilk. Her parents had forced her to stop wrestling when she was younger. Only an intervention from her coach could get them to agree. When I started winning, they stopped objecting. Now they support me completely. In fact, when I meet my friends from the village, they tell me that I have it the best. Theyre all married. They tell me not to get married, she says.For Sudesh, who competes in the 74-kg weight class, the growing participation of girls has meant more competition. Earlier, there used to be only five to seven girls in my weight class. Now, at national-level events, there are up to 25, she says.Grappling with ground realitiesAnother wrestler at the session, 23-year-old Seema, says though wrestling gave her a new life, life back in her village has not changed much. They talk about us behind our backs. They say things like wonder what she is up to and what kind of clothes must she be wearing, she says.But the villages the girls come from are a world away from the mats. During an evening session, Dahiya shows the students some techniques. The entire hall gathers around as he tackles a student to the ground. As he stands on the sidelines giving instructions, he is interrupted by a girl asking permission to leave early. The hostel warden isnt allowing me to stay late, says the undergraduate student. The hostel she stays at has a fixed curfew for girls, 6 p.m., while boys are not required to adhere to any deadlines. The coach says he will figure it out, speak to the authorities and ask for permission.Meanwhile, Sudesh and Seema are grappling on one side of the mat when they bump into two young men who have also just gone to the ground. Move to your side, yells one of the boys, pointing to the edge of the mat where the girls are supposed to practise. Seema and Sudesh roll their eyes and carry on.Towards the end of the session, the young men and women practise with each other, as the coaches make sure that the doors and windows are closed. I dont let anyone, apart from parents, hang around the hall. If they see girls and boys wrestling with each other, theyll create a ruckus. If this (points towards a girl and boy grappling) was happening in a village, there would be murder, says one of the coaches.League of aspirationsIn some time, its Sudesh who asks to leave. The second edition of the Pro Wrestling League  a bid to professionalise the game on the lines of similar franchise models for cricket, hockey, badminton, kabaddi, etc.  is starting and she wants to catch the first match on TV. Coach Dahiya agrees, and tells all his students to watch kushti on TV as he wraps up the session.The girls cycle frantically to Sudeshs one-room house to make it in time for the opening. With three teddy bears hanging on the wall and two dumb-bells on the floor next to the bed, Sudeshs room is far removed from the staid wrestling hall where she spends hours each day.As Sudesh peels amlas (gooseberries) and a beetroot for juice (its good for you after practice, she says), the programme begins. Seema and Sudesh watch the bouts, talk about which of their favourites could win. As the day winds down, Sudesh gets a call from her father. She assures him that shes taking care of herself and not exerting too much  she hasnt competed in a big competition in about two years due to a knee injury. But Im getting better, getting the strength back, she says, as images from the K.D. Jadhav stadium in Delhi play on in the background.For many of the young girls in Haryanas wrestling centres and akharas, getting to compete alongside international stars in a televised league is a new opportunity, complete with money, fame and the opportunity to learn. But life is no breeze for the young women who appear to have made it.Kiran and Indu Chaudhary have just completed their bouts on day three of the league. With the deafening roar of cheering fans and drums still ringing in their ears, the Haryana Hammers teammates catch a breath. If we give our best, then young girls and their families can see the possibilities. It promotes the sport for the next generation, says Indu, who is from Meerut in Uttar Pradesh. Indu has had a tough bout and ended up injured.  Injury toh wrestler ka gehna hai , says Kiran, to which Indu nods.Whether it is in the wrestling centres or the akharas or under the floodlights of a Delhi stadium, the assembly line coming out of Haryana augurs well for Indias sporting ambitions in the global arena even as it equalises opportunities and alters societal attitudes along the way. Theres a new-found can-do spirit stemming from the successes of the Phogat sisters and Sakshi Malik. Even in faraway Balali, where Neha Sangwan has set her sights on winning an Olympic medal. Like Sakshi didi , she says. Only two notches better.Gold.From the time my daughters started wrestling to now, I can see some change. But its not the majority that has changed. Many still wish for a boy to be born, and take the birth of a girl in their family as a burden-Daya Kaur, wife of Mahavir Phogat"
58f6e0587be9e031f13bd539,Cold tightens its grip; Sriganganagar 3.8 and Mount Abu 3.0 degrees Celsius,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/cold-tightens-its-grip-sriganganagar38-and-mount-abu-30-degrees-celsius/articleshow/56430244.cms,2017-01-10,"JAIPUR: It seems that cold is tightening its grip in the state as majority of places recorded their temperatures below the normal notch. Dense fog prevailed many places in state. Sriganganagar in plains and Mount Abu in hills remained coldest with minimum temperatures of 3.8 degrees Celsius and 3.0 degrees Celsius respectively, met report said.Attributing the climatic change to active northerly winds Jaipur met office said that similar conditions will prevail in the state in next couple of days.Jaipurities woke up to the coldest day of the season so far, as a minimum temperature of 9.2 degrees Celsius was recorded. Roads wore a deserted look during early morning hours while vehicles were moving at snail's pace due to dense fog. Traffic on highways connecting Jaipur to Agra, Jaipur to Delhi and Jaipur to Ajmer was chaotic due to the abrupt jams. Likewise, half-a-dozen early morning flights were also affected by the situation. Trains coming from neighbouring states including Uttar Pradesh, Harayana and Delhi also arrived beyond scheduled at Jaipur railway station.Sriganganagar and Mount Abu were followed by Phalodi (Jodhpur) where a minimum temperature of 5.0 degrees Celsius was recorded along with Bikaner 6.5 degrees Celsius, Alwar 6.8 degrees Celsius, Vanasthali 7.1 degrees Celsius, Jaisalmer 7.4 degrees Celsius, Pilani 7.6 degrees Celsius, Sikar 8.0 degrees Celsius, Churu 8.4 degrees Celsius, Barmer 9.2 degrees Celsius, Jodhpur 10.4 degrees Celsius. Ajmer recorded 10.5 degrees Celsius followed by Chittorgarh 11.0 degrees Celsius, Udaipur 11.4 degrees Celsius Sawai Madhopur and Bundi 11.8 degrees Celsius each.Meanwhile, the continued dip in temperature is favourable for crops including wheat and mustard as temperature was warm throughout December. ""It is actually favourable for the crops as ground frost during January is very necessary,"" said an officer with the agriculture department"
58f5f432a3d24b0b70c26744,BJP on charm offensive to win Jats over,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/BJP-on-charm-offensive-to-win-Jats-over/article17280539.ece,2017-02-10,"As the countdown to the first phase of the Uttar Pradesh elections on February 11 begins, the most striking development that has emerged through the campaign is the revolt of the Jats against the Bharatiya Janata Party. In the Lok Sabha elections of 2014, this dominant community  swept away by communal frenzy following the Muzaffarnagar riots of 2013  had played a critical role in the BJPs stunning electoral victory.Today, two-and-a-half years later, vestiges of hatred lurk beneath the picturesque sugarcane and mustard fields of western U.P. that turn the landscape green and gold in this season. But passions have cooled and the Jats have had time to think. Angered by the BJP-led governments failure to grant the community reservation and devastated by demonetisation, they are now repenting deserting the Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) and the family of their hero, Chaudhury Charan Singh.Failed effortsJats are so incensed that last Tuesday, BJP president Amit Shah was compelled to call a meeting of community leaders at the residence of Union Minister Chaudhury Birender Singh, a Jat leader from neighbouring Haryana. But the dinner diplomacy failed to pacify the guests. A day later, another BJP Jat leader and Union Minister of State and MP from Muzaffarnagar, Sanjiv Balyan, was asked to engage the community in Meerut. Reports suggest this effort, too, was unsuccessful.Pushpinder Choudhury, who heads the politically unaffiliated Jat Aarakshan Sangharsh Samiti, says this development means that the RLD is back in business. Jats will vote tactically to defeat the BJP. They will vote not just for Jat candidates or RLD candidates but also for whoever can defeat the BJP, he told The Hindu.That may be an exaggerated claim as a small section of Jats, especially those affiliated to the BJP, younger men in particular, will remain with the party. Reports coming in from western U.P. say the BJP  and organisations affiliated to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS)  have, in the closing days of the campaign, attempted to reintroduce emotive Hindutva issues relating to the theft of cattle and molestation of Hindu girls. The promise to form anti-Romeo squads (another name for the love jihad campaign) is officially in the manifesto. As one farmer leader put, Once the official campaigning closes, electioneering will continue on WhatsApp and Facebook.Onkar Singh, an RSS functionary from the Dharam Jagran Samanway in Muzaffarnagar, told The Hindu : Its a straight contest between the SP-Congress combine and the BJP. But once people start seeing the long lines of Muslims, the Hindus will all vote BJP.RLD factorConversations with members of all political parties in the fray suggest that the RLD could win anything between four and nine of the 73 seats, spread across 15 districts, going to the polls on February 11. But the fact that the party is now a player means that it will be a four-way contest  the Samajwadi Party (SP)-Congress combine, the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), the BJP and the RLD  making the outcome that much harder to predict.Clear choiceAnother significant community in this part of the State, the Muslims, are squarely behind the SP-Congress combine, as the two parties are most likely to provide them security, something they currently prize above development. The alliance, too, has given the SP a boost, with joint rallies in the region receiving rapturous receptions.Muslims will, however, vote for the BSP wherever the alliance candidate is weak. This could place the latter party in a position of advantage in some seats, as the Dalit votes are sizeable here.The BJP will clearly do better than it did in 2012 when it won just 11 of these 73 seats, but it appears unlikely to be anywhere comparable to their performance in 2014, when they won two-thirds of the Assembly segments in the Lok Sabha seats here. The BJP, SP-Congress and BSP sources all claim they are leading in the first phase, but political observers agree that it will be a direct fight between the BJP and the SP-Congress combine, with the BSP at No. 3.The RLD has a fighting chance in four to nine seats in the first phase of the polls on February 11"
58ff2ded7be9e04136163447,Will note ban  decide UP polls?,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/596742/will-note-ban-decide-up.html,2017-02-16,"Will note ban decide UP polls?By Geeta Pandey, Feb 17, 2017, 23:25 ISTIn November last year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi stunned the country by announcing that Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes were as good as garbage. Despite his insistence that the ban was meant to curb black money and put terrorists out of business, many analysts said it was motivated by politics rather than economics, and done with an eye on the Uttar Pradesh (UP) elections.Since the rise of the regional Samajwadi Party (SP) and Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) in the late 1990s, national parties  the Congress and the BJP  have been often relegated to third and fourth positions in the state. This time around, the Congress has joined the governing SP as a junior partner in an alliance, and the BJP is making an all out effort to win back the state.In the past few days, Ive travelled through several districts in the state to ask people if the currency ban or notebandi (Hindi for stopping of notes) here - is an election issue.The notebandi has without doubt touched every life, in the big cities, smaller towns and tiny villages, and everyone talks about the problems theyve faced. But will it impact the way people vote? In the main market in Barabanki town, not far from the state capital, Lucknow, the trading community is seething at the BJPs betrayal.Traders have traditionally supported the BJP, and in the past they have also contributed generously to party funds. But this time, they tell me they will not vote for the party. Notebandi is the biggest issue here, says Santosh Kumar Gupta, who along with his brothers, runs the family hardware store. The public has been really hassled. The government set limits on withdrawals and even those little amounts were unavailable because banks had no money.Gupta points out that in his address to the nation, the prime minister said the government had been planning for it for six months and that people would face minor problems.But there were lots of problems. Isnt he ashamed of lying? he asks angrily. Police used sticks to beat up people waiting in queues to withdraw their own hard-earned money. All small manufacturing units in Barabanki shut down for weeks. Thousands became unemployed.Theres a labour market a few metres from our shop and every morning, nearly 500 daily wage labourers from the nearby villages would gather to look for work, but for the first time, we saw there were no takers for them. His brother Manoj Kumar Jaiswal adds: Traders are very angry with Modi. He first said it was done to curb black money.Then he said it was done to promote digital economy. You can use credit cards and (popular mobile wallet) Paytm in cities like Delhi and Mumbai, not in Barabanki. People here are illiterate, many dont have bank accounts or credit cards. The Gupta family has 10 voters and not one will opt for the BJP.In Gosaiganj, on the outskirts of Lucknow, I stop to talk to people gathered at a tea stall. Raja Ram Rawat, a 60-year-old widower, lives with his two sons and four grandchildren. The small plot of land he owns is not sufficient to support the family and his sons work as daily wagers to supplement the family income. Since November 8, theyve not been able to find work even for one day, he says. I ask him how they are managing. Earlier if we bought two kilograms of vegetables, now we buy only one. Thats how we are managing.A farmer in the group, Kallu Prasad, compares the ban to poison for his community - it came just as the rice crop had been harvested and the sowing season had begun for wheat, mustard and potatoes. Normally we sell a kilo of rice for Rs 14, but this time we had to sell it for Rs 8 or Rs 9. We couldnt buy seeds and pesticides in time. Farmers who grew vegetables were the worst affected. Since people had no money to buy vegetables, they had to just throw them away.In the holy city of Varanasi, walking through the narrow lanes of Lallapura area, where homes sit cheek by jowl, one cannot escape the noise of the looms. Here, every home is a tiny factory where weavers work in semi-darkened rooms, using coloured silk threads to create beautiful patterns. Varanasi is famous for its hand woven silk and cotton saris and nearly a million people make their living from this cottage industry here.It was like we were hit by a bolt of lightning, says factory owner Sardar Mohd Hasim, describing the moment of Modis announcement. Hasim, who represents 30,000 weavers, says initially about 90% of the industry was affected since all their transactions happen in cash.Looms still shutWe had no cash to buy raw materials, we had no cash to pay wages to the workers. Nearly three months later, all my 24 looms are still shut. Most of my weavers are doing other jobs to earn a living.Varanasi has eight assembly constituencies, and Hasim insists that BJP will not win even one. Why would anyone now vote for Modi? he asks. One of his former workers, 40-year-old Mangru Prajapati, who is now back to work in Hasims brothers loom, agrees. Hes the sole breadwinner for his family of eight.Rajan Behal, trader and leader of the organisation that represents traders, weavers and sellers, calls it a major disaster. The ban, he says, couldnt have come at a worse time - November to February is the wedding season when sales peak, but this year its been a wipe-out. A long-time BJP supporter, Behal refuses to say who he will vote for but predicts that Modi will not win enough seats to be able to form a government in the state.Its an assessment challenged by senior BJP leader in the state Vijay Pathak, who pegs the partys chances of winning at 101%. He says that there were difficulties in the implementation of the currency ban, but insists that they have been able to convince the voters that it was done in the nations interest. We started our campaign with the aim to win more than 265 of the 403 seats. Now we believe we will cross 300.That, he says, is because people have faith in the man whos taking the decisions - the prime minister. On this count, hes right - Modis personal stock remains high, especially with the youth. In Kukha Rampur village in Tiloi constituency in Amethi district, 21-year-old Tanu Maurya says she will vote for Modi because he is doing good work and that the note ban was a good decision even if it caused some hardships in the short term.Since his sweep of the 2014 general election, Modi has not had much luck in state elections and hes desperate to reverse that losing trend. A victory in the politically key state of Uttar Pradesh would be a huge shot in the arm for Modi and his party.But will the rupee ban help him or hurt his chances? When the votes are counted on March 11, we will know whether it was a masterstroke or a miscalculation.International New York Times"
593ba8fa7be9e0066b6f6078,Lalu ribs Modi on 'adopted son',https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170218/jsp/bihar/story_136301.jsp,2017-02-18,"Lalu Prasad and Narendra Modi Patna, Feb. 17: RJD chief Lalu Prasad today sought to make light of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's statement that he was the adopted son of Uttar Pradesh by asking him to reveal his parentage. Lalu said people were confused because of Modi's statements. ""Prime Minister Modi should reveal who is his father is,"" Lalu said on the sidelines of a function at Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (IGIMS) in Patna today. Addressing an election rally in Hardoi, Uttar Pradesh, on Thursday, Modi had that while Lord Krishna was born in Uttar Pradesh and had made Gujarat his "" karmabhoomi"", he himself was born in Gujarat and had been adopted by Uttar Pradesh. He went on to say that being an adopted son of Uttar Pradesh, he would not ditch his mai-baap (mother and father). Lalu had earlier attacked the Prime Minister saying he finds some or the other link with whichever state is going for polls. ""I really find it funny that whenever there are elections, the Prime Minister finds some relation with that state. Only recently he called himself the blood son of Punjab,"" Lalu had said. During the 2015 Assembly elections, too, Lalu had used derogatory language against Modi, calling him a "" brahma pishach (powerful demon spirit)"". He had said he would use the smoke of yellow mustard and chilly to throw such elements out of Bihar. Referring to BJP national president Amit Shah and Modi, Lalu said a black pigeon needs to be sacrificed and liquor poured to get rid of people like "" narbhakshi (man-eater) Amit Shah and brahma pishach Narendra Modi"". Lalu recently returned after addressing three public rallies in Uttar Pradesh. His second round of campaigning there is from February 26. He was campaigning in western Uttar Pradesh and would now visit a few constituencies in the eastern part of the state. Even his younger son and deputy chief minister Tejashwi Prasad ridiculed Modi on his adopted son comment, saying he had made elections a big joke. ""Modi ji said he is the adopted son of Uttar Pradesh. Earlier he used to say that Ganga maiya is calling him. It sounds like joke,"" Tejashwi said during a visit to Chhapra to file RJD candidates' nomination paper for the Council polls. ""I must tell you that Ganga maiya will now punish him for his false promises. He has been telling utter lies in his the election rallies."" No Grand Alliance (JDU, RJD or Congress) leader was ready to comment on Lalu's derogatory remarks against the Prime Minister. JDU MLC and spokesperson Neeraj Kumar avoided reacting to Lalu's comment but attacked the Prime Minister on the adoption issue. ""The Prime Minister's track record with the word 'adopted' has always evoked suspicion. His plan to adopt villages in parliamentary constituencies was a big failure. He may have made the village he adopted spic and span, but other villages adopted by MPs remain in bad shape."" Senior BJP leader and former deputy chief minister Sushil Kumar Modi sharply reacted to Lalu's comment against the Prime Minister. ""Lalu's politics hinges on abusive language because his DNA is filled with abusive language,"" Sushil said. The word ""DNA"" has returned to Bihar politics after over a year. Modi had attacked chief minister Nitish Kumar's ""political DNA"" during an election rally in Muzaffarpur on July 25, 2015. Lalu grasped the opportunity, taking the pain to explain what Modi implied. ""Do you know what it means? He called him dogla,"" Lalu had said. Dogla, a cuss word, means ""illegitimate""."

This facility would be used in developing plants from which higher yield could be secured with less use of water and fertilizers.Singh said ICAR-IARI, Pusa has developed an innovative, eco-friendly and cost-effective wastewater treatment technology through which waste water can be made pollution free and used for irrigation purpose with less than 1% energy and less than 50-60% investment and operational cost.The minister also said that this technology would be effective in checking the shortage of water and pollution of soil, ground water and food due to wastewater in future.Singh highlighted the various schemes launched by the government such as Prime Minister Crop Insurance Scheme, Prime Minister Agricultural Irrigation Scheme, Farm Mechanization Mission, National Agricultural Marketing, Rural Storage Scheme and Soil Health Card Scheme for the growth of farm sector.

A voice wafted across the dusty road and the bright yellow mustard fields on both sides - ""Aapke apne pratyashi, aapke pyare Raja Bhaiyya aap ke beech aa rahe hain (Your very own Raja Bhaiyya is coming to meet you)"" from a loudspeaker atop another SUV in the motorcade piloting the Independent candidate from Kunda assembly constituency of Pratapgarh district.On Monday, just one day before campaigning comes to an end for the fourth phase of the Uttar Pradesh elections, Raghuraj Pratap left the Bhadri Estate in Beti village early with his fleet of cars, snaking its way on the dusty road through the sun-soaked fields.He has won five consecutive Assembly elections from Kunda since he got into electoral politics in 1993 and his victory margin has only spiraled every time. And, the answer to why he could do so is there for all to see.As his fleet drove by, people along the road stopped their work and bent in reverence with folded hands. The cycle repair shop-owner stood up, leaving his work. An old man riding his bicycle, stops it and gets down to bow in reverence. He asked his car to be stopped on the road side where men and women stood in a huddle.As soon as the car pulled up to a halt, men pushed their hands in through the window, touching his feet. The crowd grew and he had to request them to step back so he could open the door.A loud roar of ""Raja bhaiyya ki jai ..."" rent the air as he stepped out. Men and women fell on his feet. There were young boys and girls, who sought his blessing, an old man had an application in hand, another wanted some work done while most cheered him, holding large cardboard cutouts of a saw - his election symbol -- wishing him success as he readied for the polls on Thursday. The ""Raja of Kunda"" folded his hands, raised his arms and accepted their greetings.He then drove off to the neighbouring constituency Babuganj, where another Independent candidate is fighting with his support.In the badlands of eastern Uttar Pradesh, Raja Bhaiyya is also considered a ""bahubali"" dominating the socio-political landscape, though he has not faced any charge in the recent past and has been acquitted in the earlier ones.Raghuraj Pratap's writ runs large in Pratapgarh, where people have been voting him for the last 25 years and revering him as their icon.Every morning, people would throng his palace to seek justice and he would ensure an informal spot justice, people seeking his blessings in even settling petty disputes around land or property. He would call the warring parties and deliver justice that can hardly be challenged.""If there is a case of teasing, people of his constituency prefer to complain to him and he who would call the wayward boy, reprimand him. Police is our second choice in such situations,"" said Radhe Mishra of Kunda Bazaar, adding that he organises marriages of poor girls and performs ""kanya daan"" himself.Is he the Robinhood of Kunda or a good Samaritan? ""They are like my father, mother, daughters and sons.""It is said in Kunda that you would punish an electricity department employee by hanging him upside down if there was power outage in your constituency,"" said TOI. The answer comes in an instant: ""It's of course a myth. And that is not needed. A phone call from me is enough to set things right.""He would ask his car to be stopped every other minute, whenever he found a gathering, waiting for a glimpse of the man whose victory margin has risen from 66,000 to 73,000, 72,000, 82,000 to 88,000 in the last election, turning the elections into a no contest irrespective of the opposition.Raghuraj's aura has remained undiminished despite then UP chief minister Kalyan Singh cracking down on him and describing him as ""Kunda ka goonda"" and then Mayawati slapping POTA on him.But, why has he never ventured out of the state to test political waters in the Delhi?He was offered a seat in the 2004 Lok Sabha elections by the then Samajwadi party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav but he declined and preferred to stay as an Independent MLA.Raghuraj Pratap is not only a heavyweight to the extent of being invincible in Kunda by now for the last 25 years, but in Lucknow too he plays an important role in the formation of the government. It was Raja Bhaiyya who played a key role in rescuing then Kalyan Singh government in 1997 after BSP had withdrawn support from him. He engineered defections in the BSP and Congress to marshal support of required MLAs.When Mayawati became chief minister in 2002, she slapped POTA on him and threw him behind bars for over one-and-a-half year but was later acquitted. It was during his jail term that he had twins but saw them only after 11 months after he was out of bail."

Abbas Ansari walks out of one of the vehicles towards the square. He bears a strong semblance to his father, Mukhtar Ansari, especially because of his twirled-up moustache. The 26-year-old sports a blue scarf and four wristbands of the Bahujan Samaj Partys blue. Young and old, especially women, rush out to welcome him. A plate of chura (a rich, flattened snack), jaggery balls and a glass of water is served to him as custom in this part of the country.The media people call us mafia. Now you show them if we are mafia or messiah, Mr. Abbas addresses the Rajbhar women (a most backward caste) assembled there in chaste Bhojpuri.The villagers have good things to say about Mr. Abbas and his family. Some even reach out to bless him. All these electric poles were set up 15 years ago by Mukhtar bhai (the village then fell under the Mau constituency), and the roads and tubewells too. But no party or MLA has worked for us since. Look at the condition of the roads today, Ganpat Rajbhar said.A call awayA few moments later, Mr. Abbas is informed by residents that the village has had no power supply for the past 24 hours. Dial the chairman, he directs his aides without any delay. After speaking to a senior official, he assures villagers that power would be restored within a few hours. I will take care of you. Bestow me with your blessings, Mr. Abbas appeals to villagers as he exits the locality.Making his political debut from the Ghosi seat on the BSP ticket, Abbas hopes his fathers goodwill among the poor and downtrodden, and clout, will see him through. But there also comes the burden of being Mukhtar Ansaris son  the four-time MLA from neighbouring Mau seat is accused of dozens of crimes and is currently in jail in connection with the 2005 murder of the BJP MLA Krishnanand Rai.False cases were registered against my father to put an end to our politics. If he was mafia, why would people entrust faith in us for the past 25 years, says Mr. Abbas, who himself enjoys a clean image. In fact, he is an exemplary sportsperson. He is a member of the Indian shooting team and is among the top 10 skeet shooters, winning acclaim in two subsequent World Cups  Germany and Finland. He secured his first national championship in 2011 in the shotgun category, and missed a berth in the Rio Olympics after an accident in 2014, which kept him out of practice for a year. I am one of the few shooters who excel in all three categories  big bore rifle, skeet and pistol, says Mr. Abbas."

""Chachi, Jai Bhim,"" exclaims Abbas Ansari , as he adjusts his dark brown sun glasses and twirls up his moustache before greeting the woman with folded hands.It is afternoon and Ansari (25), the BSP candidate from Ghosi assembly constituency in Mau is at the peak of his campaign. But more than a candidate-inarguably youngest to be fielded by any political party in this UP assembly election-Abbas is the son of gangster-turned-politician Mukhtar Ansari , who, while still lodged in jail, is contesting from the neighboring constituency of Mau Sadar.Even as the shadow of a gangster father looms over him, Abbas, a management graduate and a national level shooting champion, is in a hurry to get into the shoes of a 'neta'. ""Ek baar aapan ladka ko vote diyo...(vote this time for your son),"" Abbas exhorts in a typical local dialect, even as one of his accomplices pulls out a calendar bearing a photograph of BSP chief Mayawati and hands it over to Naina.Bemused, the woman responds: ""Humka kachhu na chahi bhaiyya... hum logan ka koi kuch nahi kari raha ab tak...(I don't need anything...nobody has done anything for us),"" she pleads. Abbas listens patiently and then bows to her. ""Vote na diyo...aashirwad to diyo Chachi.. (Don't vote but at least bless me),"" he says, before walking away to a waiting cavalcade of SUVs parked in the sunbaked stretches that snake through swathes of mustard fields.The cars, bearing BSP flags and blaring out a party song moves from one village to another. And each time, Abbas darts out of his SUV to meet people, poses for a selfie with youngsters and even hugs children.The Ghosi assembly constituency, comprising as many as 181 small and big villages, has seen a public representative of either BJP or BSP since 1993. Fagu Chauhan, who won the seat as BJP candidate in 1993 and 1996, switched to Mayawati's camp and won the seat in 2002 and then in 2007 on BSP ticket. He lost the seat in 2012 to SP's Sudhakar Singh. Mukhtar had then, as a candidate of Quami Ekta Dal-now merged with BSP-had contested from both Mau and Ghosi. He won Mau but was relegated to third position in Ghosi.This time, Sudhakar is in the fray to get re-elected as SP candidate, while Chauhan is contesting on a BJP ticket. Not surprisingly, Abbas keeps hitting at both Sudhakar and Chauhan. ""Bhaiyya aap Sudhakar Chacha aur Fagu Chacha to dekh liye ho...hum unka jaise nahi hain...koi commission na laihein...jo paisa aayi u yahin laga dehiyein... (You have seen Sudhakar uncle and Fagu uncle...I am not like them...I will not take any commission.. whatever funds arrive would be put into development of the area),'' he tells a group of men in village Fatehpur Dulhara. ""My father has been four times MLA from Mau. He must have done something to win the seat so many times. Time has now come for Ghosi to see development,'' Abbas tells TOI.The Ghosi assembly constituency is actually a complex mix of Dalits, Muslims and Most Backward Caste (MBC). While Dalits account for nearly 18% of the total population, Muslims are around 20%. The constituency, otherwise, is dominated by non-Yadav OBC, essentially Rajbhars. While BSP is banking on a general projection of Dalits-Muslims consolidation, the SP and BJP is relying completely on local factors."
58f95f59a3d24b0b70c3f3ac,Yellow is the new saffron here,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/yellow-is-the-new-saffron/article17385175.ece,2017-03-01,"Sipahs bright mustard fields appear completely in sync with the political mood of the village. Cutting past its dusty roads, the colour yellow becomes even more apparent  vivid yellow scarves, banners, flags and posters indicate the presence of the Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party (SBSP).The village, nestled in the Zahoorabad constituency in Ghazipur, less than 20 km from the banks of the Ganga, is in the heart of the Yadav-Muslim-Bhumihar belt of eastern Uttar Pradesh. However, the talking point here is not any social alliance but the political significance of the Rajbhars. The community is one of the 17 most backward castes that have been for long been demanding inclusion in the Scheduled Caste category.At a crossing in Sipah, around a dozen Rajbhars have gathered, some of them tired after the days campaigning. There is no doubt about their political and electoral inclination  they are strongly behind Om Prakash Rajbhar, president of the SBSP, which draws its strength from the Rajbhars.Its about prideOm Prakash Rajbhar is making our presence felt. We are also getting the honour due to him. Before his movement, no party wasted a second on us, says young Rajesh Rajbhar, a small-time farmer, like many other people of his caste in Sipah. If Rajbhars lavish praise on Om Prakash Rajbhar for elevating the asmita (pride) of the community and popularising their icon Suheldev, they are also thankful to the Narendra Modi government for its outreach.After coming to power, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government has taken concerted steps to popularise Suheldev. If BJP chief Amit Shah unveiled a statue of Suheldev in Bahraich, the party installed his frame in its gallery at its headquarters in Lucknow. Last year, the BJP went against convention and started a new superfast train  the Suhaildev Express  named after the medieval warrior-king, a legend among Rajbhars.The triweekly service covers the breadth of Indias most populous State  from Ghazipur in Purvanchal to Anand Vihar in Delhi. The BJP-Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) have, over the years, aggressively tried to portray Suheldev as a Hindutva warrior who stopped the march of the Muslim invader Ghazi Mian, a nephew of Mahmud Ghaznavi, in Bahraich, and halted Islamisation of the region. In this village, too, Suheldev is hailed as a national hero who kept out invaders. Several respondents spoke with a communal undertone.Affinity for BJPThe affinity of the Rajbhars towards the BJP also stems from that fact that the party is fighting the elections in an alliance with the SBSP. It is expected to further push the BJPs outreach among non-Yadav backward communities.As part of its deal with the BJP, the SBSP is fighting eight seats spread across eastern U.P.  Mau, Bansdih, Chaudauli, Zakania, Shahganj, Mehnagar, Ramkola and Zahoorabad in Ghazipur, where Om Prakash Rajbhar is himself contesting. However, the BJP hopes to gain across the belt as an understanding with the SBSP has earned it a commanding presence among the Rajbhars.Campaign journeysOm Prakash Rajbhar is himself travelling across the belt with Amit Shah to draw in his communitys people. Though estimated to be around 2% of the States population, the Rajbhars are concentrated is some districts of east U.P., having the potential to impact results. While Om Prakash has in the past claimed that his community is effective in no less than 70 seats, his aide Pattiram Rajbhar, says the Rajbhar vote is spread across 147 constituencies. In every constituency, there are 10,000 to 80,000 Rajbhars, says Pattiram, adding that the vote was being transferred to the BJP in full strength.In Zahoorabad, Om Prakash is battling against the Bahujan Samaj Partys (BSP) Kalicharan Rajbhar, former MLA and runner-up last time, and the Samajwadi Partys (SP) Mahendra Chauhan, a candidate from the Noniya backward caste. In Sipah, Om Prakash is the clear favourite among members of his community.Whereas Sipah strongly backs its community leader, while travelling across Ballia, Azamgarh, Mau and Ghazipur districts, substantial conversion of the Rajbhar vote towards the BJP could be found. In some areas, however, they appeared split between the SP and the BSP as well, especially if they fielded candidates from the community.Moti Chand Rajbhar, an ally-turned-foe of Om Prakash, however, says the latter has lost credibility in his community due to his flip-flops and would not be able to ensure the full Rajbhar vote to the BJP.No intelligent Rajbhar likes him, says Moti Chand, who now works for the SP in Ballias Rasra seat. Om Prakash Rajbhar struck a deal with the BJP for his own greed. He has sold the communitys future for a few bucks.  He had merged his outfit, the Jai Suheldev Party, with Om Prakashs BSP to form the SBSP, but the two soon parted ways over differences.In 2002, after leaving the Bahujan Samaj Party, Om Prakash Rajbhar, who has in the past claimed to be a descendant of Suheldev, formed the SBSP. In 2012, it contested 52 seats and secured over 4.7 lakh total votes [5.06% votes in the seats it fought] but failed to open its score. Mr. Rajbhar himself stood third from Zahoorabad, despite winning a decent 48,865 votes.Another issue that stirs the Rajbhar is the talk of Dalit status. The community is financially, socially and educationally among the most backward."

Susheela Devi (far right) stands with her neighbours in the village. (Below) An old Thakur house.R.V. MoorthyThe sprawling village of Kalan is set in 1,200 bighas of fertile land in the southeastern corner of Uttar Pradeshs Sultanpur district. An early spring sun filters through the trees onto the ruins of Somit Pratap Singhs hereditary home. He is supervising the building of his new home, as the mountain of bricks before which he sits suggests. Somit has just completed his MSc from the Shri Vishwanath Degree College nearby and hopes to become a primary school teacher, once the Assembly elections conclude and recruitment is resumed.Three days before polling in the Kadipur Assembly constituency (February 27), in which this village falls, we talk about the electoral prospects of the parties in the fray. Its BJP versus BSP here, he says confidently. His vote, like that of his fellow Thakurs, will go to the kamal ka phool (lotus, the BJP symbol). He suddenly rushes off and returns with a large notebook, flips it open and shows me a family tree he has drawn up painstakingly. It goes back two centuries. Its important that future generations know who their ancestors were, he stresses.The Thakurs, BJP loyalistsIndeed, pride in their heritage is a recurring theme with the Thakurs who dominate the village politically, own the largest tracts of land, and are patrons of education. Kalan has many shortcomings, but it has an array of educational options in its immediate vicinity from the government school and degree college to the swish Shivbrat Childrens Academy and an engineering college: it ensures that virtually every child here is getting an education. The last named is administered by Uma Shankar Singh, the former pradhan of Kalan, who studied at Mumbais K.C. College and the Mafatlal Institute before embarking on a 25-year-long career in textile quality control that included a stint at Subbu Textiles in Tamil Nadus Erode district.Rajendra Bahadur Singh, a primary school teacher in a neighbouring village, claims his familys arrival in these parts predates Rana Pratap  a Thakur icon  who ruled in the sixteenth century. His ancestors, he says, came as horse traders from Amer in Rajasthan, overthrew the Rajbhars who were the local rulers at the time and settled down in the village of Khanpur Pilai, less than five km from Kalan. Today, he proclaims proudly, Our clan of Kachwaha Thakurs is spread over 52 villages and the Rajbhars work on our land. But we dont have any social relations with them.Its a given that Rajendra and his family, including his elder brother who holds a PhD in sociology from Lucknow University and has done research work at Delhis Jawaharlal Nehru University, will vote BJP. It is the only nationalist party  all educated people will vote for Narendra Modi, he says.And then he adds, This time, the Rajbhars, who are traditional BSP supporters and even voted for the party in 2014, have shifted to the BJP. The reason? A brand-new Rajbhar party, the Bharatiya Samaj Party, that takes its inspiration from Raja Suhel Dev, ironically enough the Rajbhar king who was defeated by the Thakurs, has allied itself with the BJP this time.Rajbhars shifting right?In Kalan, the Rajbhars, an OBC community, are numerically larger than the Thakurs but, barring the Musahars (earlier rat catchers but now landless labourers), are the poorest in the village. Its members largely live below the poverty line. A handful are marginal cultivators not even growing enough to feed their families, while the vast majority are landless labourers here.The Rajbhar quarter in the village is a tongue of land surrounded on three sides by lush green fields of paddy and mustard. But most of it belongs to another OBC community, the Badhais, traditionally makers of agricultural tools, but whose secondary occupation is cultivation.The crowded mud hovels in which the Rajbhars live are a far cry from the well-lit havelis and whitewashed bungalows of the Thakurs, equipped with modern conveniences. Some have laid out their string beds outside their homes. To protect themselves from the elements and the mosquitoes, they have opened out used fertiliser bags and stitched them into mosquito net-like canopies for their beds.Our ancestors left us no land, says Sanichara sadly, so we work on the lands of the Thakurs and the Badhais. Rajpati and Mala join in the conversation to complain they have the  lal rang ka card  (BPL card) but dont get any of the welfare benefits that others seem to enjoy. No one cares whether we are alive or dead, says Mala. We have no proper drains or toilets, and a kucha (unpaved) road leads to our dwellings. Her nephew, Munna, is a mason who has seen a bit of life outside the village. Look at Bihar: have you seen the pitch (tarred) roads there? he says enviously. Here we were told that everyone with a red BPL card would get a free bulb, and pay Rs. 25 on electricity. But we are being made to pay Rs. 270. In the hand-to-mouth existence that they live, that makes a big hole in their meagre earnings.So has anyone come to seek your votes, I ask. Yes, says Rajpati, someone from the BSP. But when I ask who they are voting for, the women say,  Kono palan nahin (We havent decided yet). Mala adds,  Jahan public jutegi wahan jayenge (Wherever the majority is going, we will follow).Sanicharas father-in-law, Motinath, with matted long hair and a straggly unkempt beard, is more forthcoming: The cycle [the SP symbol] is looking at its community, the elephant [the BSP symbol] at its community. We are trying something new: well vote for the kamal .As I turn to leave, there is a surprise. Sanichara, Rajpati and Mala follow me. As soon as they are out of earshot distance from their menfolk, they grab my arm and whisper in my ear: We like Mayawati: we have attended her rallies in the past. We are going to vote for her. Dont you think thats a good idea?Camp BSP: the DalitsIf the Thakurs of Kalan have memories of military triumphs stretching over several centuries that gives them the self-confidence to take on the challenges of life, the BSP phenomenon has empowered the Dalits over the last 25 years. Indeed, though Akbarpur, the birthplace of the socialist leader, Ram Manohar Lohia, is less than 40 km away, only old-timers in the village have fleeting memories of him, with a statue and a few educational institutions named after him there. Instead, with BSP founder Kanshi Ram making this region  of which Kalan is a part  one of his social laboratories, it is the BSP that continues to have influence here.In Kalan, numerically too there are roughly the same number of Dalit families as there are Thakur households, adding to their sense of power. As I walk to the Dalit quarter, right at the heart of the village, this is immediately visible, especially among the women and the younger generation.Uneducated Dalits like Ramachal and his wife Usha are marginal farmers, who supplement their income by carrying bricks at building sites. But they have nothing left at the end of the month. Ramachals ailing father gets a pension, but thats about it. They complain about notebandi (the demonetisation exercise) and are a bit subdued, but their eldest child, Sonu, who is in Class XI at the local government school, is not. He says he wants to be an engine driver and see the world. His mother butts in to say sourly, Where will we get the money for the bribe? But Sonu remains cool and instead explains the Pythagorean theorem with aplomb  a tribute both to him and the school where he studies.At 17, he doesnt have a vote but clearly takes an interest in politics, for it is he who says that his parents will vote for the elephant.  Behenji [BSP chief Mayawati] ran a very good government and the BSP is our party. We are all elephants, Sonu stresses.Like Sonu, one of their neighbours, Sunita Devi, who works at an Anganwadi, has her own world view. An attractive young married woman, she is the mother of three little girls, and has studied till Class X. Modi had said ghar ghar sauchalaya [a toilet in every house], but we have no toilets yet, she says. We will vote for Behenji because she gives the most benefits. When my eldest child was born, she was in power and the government gave Rs. 1 lakh insurance for the baby. When my daughter turns 18, I can use the accrued money for her marriage.I tell Sunita I had heard that a BJP representative visited the Dalit quarter, and ask her what she thinks of the Prime Minister. Yes, Rajesh Kumar [a BJP activist] came here and said, vote for kamal ka phool. I told him we are haathi [elephant] people, so forget about it. And then she takes off on the Central government: I was expecting my third child last November and had gone to my parents home in Azamgarh district. Thanks to notebandi , my parents had such a tough time raising the Rs. 5,000 for me to have the child at a private hospital.So what does she expect of the Prime Minister? When we choose a Prime Minister, we do it in the hope that he creates a harmonious atmosphere, and works for the welfare of all the people. Then everyone will be happy. We dont expect notebandi  everyone sitting at home and crying, she says.If the Dalit women are committed Mayawati supporters, some of the men are considering other options. Ramprakash, a bus conductor who earns Rs. 4,000 a month, says, We are haathiwalen but its not necessary that we will all vote BSP. Modi has done some good work: lets try him once. His fiery young wife, Shashikala, and their neighbour, Meera, turn on him: Rubbish! He has done nothing. We women at any rate will vote BSP.And then comes another surprise. Meera says, Our grown-up sons are considering another option  Akhilesh Yadav [of the SP], because he has given cycles and laptops.The split backward voteBut Mayawati has other admirers among the backward castes. In Kalan, there are half-a-dozen homes of the Lohars, traditional blacksmiths, but who have now turned to carpentry, with many moving to Mumbai. The Lohars have some land, but it is not enough to feed them. Saroja Surajlal Vishwakarma, the young daughter-in-law of one Lohar household, is an ardent Modi admirer. But her aunt-in-law, Parvati, who lives in Mumbai and is here on vacation, hates the Prime Minister. She had to pawn her jewellery to get her husband treated after demonetisation devastated their carpentry business. Someone who begs for your votes should not oppress you. Life was best for women under Mayawati. I have been to her rallies, she says firmly.But not all communities who vote BSP have been empowered. Take Kalans only Musahar family. Ram Chander, his two brothers, and his wife Lakshmina, who suffers from a nervous disorder, live on the edge of the village. Three decades back, they lived in a small room in the nearby kasba , and would travel to Kalan for work. One day, a Thakur said that he would give them a piece of land in exchange for which they would have to make sal leaf pattals (plates) and clear away the soiled plates. Now no one eats from those plates and they do odd jobs to eke out an existence. They also have a little stall on the main road where they sell chewable tobacco, potato crisps and toffees.If the Lohars are divided, another backward caste, the Chaurasias, traditional betel growers and a community that has social relations with the Thakurs, are firmly with the BJP. Kalans current pradhan Bimla Devi was away in Mumbai to attend to her husband Chottey Lal, who is admitted in a hospital there after he sustained a heart attack. They have a thriving betel leaf and motor parts business in that city. That is evident from the imposing three-storey house they are building in the village, with tiered, carved balconies that curve around the structure.Their younger son, Krishna, who has a BSc degree, is standing in for his mother. He reels off all the improvements he has made to the village  drains, roads, electricity  and says he hopes to contest the seat when it is de-reserved. His elder brother Mukesh, who is going to sit for the entrance exams for a government job, and he are both BJP supporters. Mukesh says he likes the BJP but wishes the party would not try and divide society  also he makes it clear that reservation for OBCs must continue. But Krishna likes the party for its anti-Muslim stance: They tease our girls in Muslim-dominated areas and the SP gives them protection, he says, adding, I want Yogi Adityanath to be Chief Minister.In Kalan, however, the Muslims are a miniscule minority, no more than six families, two of whom live on one edge of the village. But the two  related to each other  have quarrelled over land, and a wall separates their homes. Tabassum is a young widow. She and her daughter live with her mother and sister-in-law. They have no land, so her brother who works in Mumbai sends home money to support them. My daughter, Saina Bano, has friends at the private school she attends, but none in the village. For much of the year, they live in splendid isolation: Most people dont know we are Muslims, so we go and play Holi, she says and then adds, We invite people for Bakrid. Yes, she will vote, she says. I hear people are voting for Mayawati. Ill do the same.Akhileshs Yadavs?The Yadavs in Kalan are predictably supporters of the SP: they are largely educated and financially on a stable footing. Sangeeta, a young housewife who also works at an Anganwadi, lives in a joint family. Her brother-in-law Rajesh has an MA degree and is looking for a job. But the family has enough land to not only to feed itself but also sell in the open market. Everyone here says they are voting SP, but it is the younger members who answer the difficult questions. The cherubic-looking Saurabh is only 16, but clearly sharper than his elders: when I ask the family what they have to say about the Yadavs cornering all the benefits, it is he who responds, measuring his words carefully: Do only OBCs walk on the roads or benefit from the ambulances and police vans? Are they the only ones who get pensions? Yes, there may be many Yadavs in the police and forces because we are a martial people. But the bureaucracy is dominated by Kayasthas and Brahmins. Why not talk about that?And then Saurabh springs a surprise. He will be of voting age by 2019 and he says: I am very impressed by Modis personality. I think many in my family will vote BJP in 2019. His uncles demur but he has let the cat out of the bag. After SP patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav came to power, through the 1990s and the 2000s, political power helped the Yadavs prosper materially and enter the middle class. Their aspirations have changed and many no longer wish to be associated with a party associated with lathi-wielding musclemen. If the advent of the polished Akhilesh Yadav has held them back, the results of the current elections could well determine the future voting patterns of the community.The cycle is looking at its community, the elephant at its community. We are trying something new: well vote for the kamal (lotus).Motinath Behenji [BSP chief Mayawati] ran a very good government and the BSP is our party. We are all elephants.sonuOur grown-up sons are considering Akhilesh Yadav because he has given cycles and laptops.Meera"

The district officers were unaware when the minister could do the inauguration with the model code of conduct in place.I will have to check on this were all they were willing to say. However, the minister got special permission from the Election Commission, but that did not help. The officials were not sure if they could attend the function or not. When the minister did the inauguration on Sunday, the district officials were not present.Akalis on cloud nine after DSGMC polls winOverjoyed with the partys victory in Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (DSGMC) elections on March 1, Akali supporters, who are awaiting the poll results in Punjab, have coined a new slogan, Ek nu Dehli, 11 nu Punjab, meaning that they have been victorious in Delhi gurdwara polls and would also win the Punjab assembly polls where the results are due on March 11. The SAD (Badal) staged an impressive victory in Delhi where Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) backed out of the contest. The AAP gave a tough fight to AAP and Congress in Punjab, though.Retd Punjab babu on green missionRetired IAS officer Suresh Kumar is leading another campaign post-retirement, focusing on water-energy-agriculture nexus and crop residue in Punjab. While in service, he led the agriculture department. At a discussion held last week, the thinking heads from the state departments of agriculture, environment, irrigation and power, besides experts from the Punjab Agricultural University (PAU), came together to discuss these issues. Kumar managed to involve the United States Agency of International Development (USAID) and Centre for International Projects Trust (CIPT). They have divergent views on some issues, but there was consensus that solutions need to be found before it is too late.Netas of varied huesThe proceedings in the Haryana assembly remained dreary during the first week of the budget session. There were not any great speeches. Clever wordplay was also missing, barring occasional digs by leaders of the ruling and opposition parties at each other. And the most noticeable thing in the 90-member House was the sartorial sense of the legislators  their kurta-pyjamas and sleeveless jackets in pink, purple, red, mustard, green and blue hues. Leading the pack of MLAs sporting colourful clothes was none other than chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar. Like his mentor Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the RSS pracharak-turned-politician has a penchant for wearing colourful jackets and kurtas with white churidaars. Their multi-coloured clothes of the MLAs have not remained unnoticed. They are a talking point among the mandarins and mediapersons.Sulking Haryana BJP legislatorsUpset over neglect, several BJP legislators in Haryana are publicly griping against the functioning of their own government. Though chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar had tried to placate them on Thursday, his assurances do not seem to have worked. The 16 miffed MLAs, who have complaining against sautela vyavahar (step-motherly treatment), not only asked the ministers in the House on Friday about the fate of projects announced by the chief minister in their areas. They had another meeting to formulate a joint strategy. Kuch log goad mein baitha rakhe hain. Baki vidayakon ki koi sunwayi nahin hai (Some people are sitting in the lap. Other MLAs are not lent an ear). Officers keep objecting to everything. With what face we will go to the people, one of them grumbled after the meeting. They are now waiting to meet the central leaders after March 11, the day of the assembly results.Envying the neighbourThe grass, they say, is always greener on the other side. Ask the MLAs in Haryana about their status. A number of them feel there is no place like neighbouring Uttar Pradesh where the assembly polls are currently underway. Vidhayak ka bahut roab aur rutba hota hai UP mein (MLA has major influence and status in UP), one of the miffed BJP legislator said. But its not the MLAs. A senior minister also feels this way. Main jab bhi UP jaata hoon toh feel hota hai main mantri hoon (When I go to UP, I get the feeling that I am a minister), an outspoken minister said while chatting with reporters on the sidelines of the ongoing budget session. He attributed the difference to size of the two states. Being a small state, the officers are in direct contact with the CM or his staff, and do not pay attention to legislators, he said.Dhankars killer dialogueSmiles were rife at a press conference held by agriculture minister OP Dhankar the other day on the forthcoming agri-leadership summit in Surajkund. Asked about absence of adequate marketing for farm produce from the state, he amused the newspersons and officials alike by quoting a dialogue of Bollywood film Raees. Us film mein Shah Rukh Khan kahta hai, Gujarat ki hawa mein vyapaar hai, mein chahata hoon Haryana ki hawa mein bhi vyapaar ho, he said while exhorting the state farmers to look at market demand prior to sowing. The smiles turned into laughter when the minister was elaborating upon inviting progressive farmers and a journalist suggested that officials supposed to invite them could have easily met them together at dharna spots where the Jats are holding protests. However, the joke did not amuse the minister.Dharamshala as 2nd HP capital: BJP takes divergent standChief minister Virbhadra Singhs move to give second capital status to Dharamshala has been hailed by his party colleagues from Kangra district, but the opposition has been giving confusing signals. Congress MLA from Jawalamukhi Sanjay Rattan recently not only heaped praise on the CM for the decision, but also urged Virbhadra to construct his private residence there. Before the CM even responded, Dehra legislator Ravinder Singh Ravi, who belongs to the BJP, warned urban development minister Sudhir Sharma that Rattans suggestion was aimed at displacing him from Dharamshala. However, Shimla MLA Suresh Bhardwaj, who is also from BJP, has openly criticised the decision. He is blaming the minister, seen as the CMs blue-eyed boy, for the move. Its not Virbhadras decision. Sharma has mesmerised him, Bhardwaj says.Himachal CPS told to play it coolKnown as Congress loose cannon, chief parliamentary secretary Neeraj Bharti hurls accusations at not only members of the opposition BJP, but at his own party colleagues on social media. Those at the receiving end include transport minister GS Bali and his son Raghuvir Singh Bali. Raghuvir, who is secretary, Himachal Congress, had a word of advice for Bharti when the latter was abroad. People elected by popular vote should show restraint while speaking on public platforms, he said during a short visit to Bharti assembly constituency, Jawali.(Contributed by Aseem Bassi, Gurpreet Singh Nibber, Navneet Sharma, Rajesh Moudgil, Gaurav Bisht, Naresh K Thakur)"

Its a very different river from the one you see from the ITO Bridge or Nizamuddin Bridge. To see the river, you go down Outer Ring Road, past the University and Timarpur, and turn off towards the Yamuna Biodiversity Park.Then you weave your way through the dusty by-lanes of Jagatpur, just another one of those urban villages that dot Delhi, till you reach the fields bordering the river. Concrete roads cut across the fields of vegetables and mustard to the river, jutting like grey-brown fingers on green baize.If you are lucky, and it is the right time of the year, you may see Red Crested Pochards, not inside the biodiversity park, but in one of the agricultural ponds surrounding the fields. The large diving duck that comes to India from Europe and central Asia is unmistakable. The males have a bright orange head and a striking red bill.The fields themselves are home to the Red Avadavat, a pretty red bird that belongs to the munia family, Scaly-Breasted Munia, weavers of various kinds, chiff-chaffs, warblers, and other common birds. Eurasian Marsh Harriers are common, Eurasian Hobbies not so (although you may see them). And in the winter months, the air is filled with Black- and Brown-Headed Gulls, and the occasional Pallass Gull.Then the road (no matter which one you are on) ends abruptly, and you are at the river. On a typical day, you may find some people bathing here, others immersing the ashes of the dead, and still others just hanging around. The bank is usually littered with garbage, plastic bottles, marigold garlands, shiny packs that one served as homes for chips or biscuits. Lapwings (you may spot two varieties usually, three if it is your day) and larks dot the banks. The water is unexpectedly clean (or at least looks clean).In the winter months it is filled with gulls and the kind of ducks you see in Delhi in those months  Northern Shovellers, Northern Pintails, Eurasian Wigeons, two or three kinds of pochards.One afternoon, I sat by the bank and watched the dying sunlight leap off the russet brown bodies of a huge flock of Ruddy Shelducks. We (my son and wife were with me) ticked off around 60 species that day (many others have seen more)  not exactly a high number in Delhi where you can see 30 species in your garden.Indeed, Delhi and its environs are a birders delight and dismay. One year, a bunch of us, in a convoy of seven cars, drove 90-100 km away to Dighal to see a rare Marbled Teal that had somehow strayed into India. The bird was in an agricultural pond, in the middle of a village. It wasnt a particularly clean village; we had to watch our step. A Peregrine Falcon makes its home in a tall TV tower in West Delhi. It is seen there every year.Most people associate birds with forests. At the least, they expect a green area earmarked as a sanctuary, or a water body surrounded by greenery, like Haryanas Sultanpur National Park. Yet, there is better birding to be had in the fallow and cultivated fields and scrubland behind the park that birders call Sultanpur Flats.And in a place not too far away from Sultanpur, Basai, near what is touted as the regions next hot real estate zone, developments adjoining the Dwarka Expressway. There is even better birding to be had along a drainage canal in Najafgarh. The Aravalli Biodiversity Park, Basai, Sultanpur, Bhindawas, Dighal  all are probably hotspots in the Central Asian Flyway, a migratory path from Europe and Central Asia to the Indian peninsula that birds have been using for hundreds, maybe thousands of years. A few of the hotspots have become national parks. Many are privately owned agricultural land or commons.Across India, the commons are under threat and the owners of agricultural land are selling their holdings thanks to the relentless development of our cities. In Basai, real estate developments have sprung up in fields once homes to thousands of waders and Bar-Headed and Greylag Geese. The birds still come, flying over the Himalayas en route, although their numbers are dwindling.On the other side, in Uttar Pradesh, the huge lake near Beel Akbarpur in Dadri (Greater Noida), and the surrounding marshes that were once home to thousands of waders and ducks is gone, consumed by developments including a large Ansal project and a university funded by Shiv Nadar, an IT-billionaire-turned-philanthropist.In 2014, a birder photographed a Lesser Florican in the stub of grassland that remains behind the university. The bird, a bustard, is named in Schedule I of the Indian Wildlife Act  promising it absolute protection. To be sure, it could have been a vagrant. And to be sure, birds have shown far more resilience to the inexorable march of progress than many other species.Not far from Dadri is Dhanauri Kalan, made famous by happenings in an adjacent hamlet Bhatta where farmers protested that they werent getting fair value for land being acquired by real estate developers. The commons here are home to the largest roost of Sarus Cranes near Delhi. Ive seen up to 120-125 of them playing, dancing, and calling in unison. But Dhanauri was lucky. Thanks to the efforts of an environmentalist, Anand Arya, it was classified a wetland.Many other commons are not as fortunate.In India, no one really associates the commons with the environment, which is not surprising in a country where most people think removing weeds and scrubs from a plot and replacing them with Australian grass is actually good for the environment.R Sukumar is editor, Mintletters@hindustantimes.com"

The scheme was launched by Animal Resources Development Department Minister Swapan Debnath on Monday at the departments headquarters at Salt Lake. There would be three vans initially, spread out across Kolkata.AT A time when meat sellers have come under watch in Uttar Pradesh, and now Jharkhand, the West Bengal government is set to get non-vegetarian delicacies to Kolkatas doorsteps through Meat on Wheelz.The initiative has been started by West Bengal Livestock Development Corporation Limited (WBLDCL)s popular brand Haringhata Meat, which also deals in non-conventional meat such as that of quail, duck, turkey and emu. Officials said that apart from taking cooked non-veg delicacies to Kolkata and its suburbs, Meat on Wheelz would also sell frozen packaged items of Haringhata.The scheme was launched by Animal Resources Development Department Minister Swapan Debnath on Monday at the departments headquarters at Salt Lake. There would be three vans initially, spread out across Kolkata. Depending on the success of the pilot project, a fewmore vehicles would be added, including in other district headquarters of the state, an official said.On Tuesday, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee commented about the recent happenings in Uttar Pradesh, where meat sellers went on strike in protest against the crackdown on slaughterhouses. People are afraid & many are scared about differences over caste, creed & religion, she said in a statement.Among the dishes planned on Meat on Wheelz are quail briyani, gandharaj turkey and duck roast.An official said that Haringhata Meats sales had trebled over the past few years, with that of quail, duck and turkey meat doubling in the last one year. In 2014-15, we had sales of Rs 4.35 lakh in frozen and processed meat. By 2015-16 September, it had jumped to Rs 9.58 lakh. If you take into account sales during the Ahare Bangla food festival, we crossed the Rs 10 lakh mark, said the official. Ahare Bangla is an annual food festival organised by the West Bengal government, which saw participation from other countries as well last year.Officials said Haringhata had also tied up with three food courts at shopping malls in Kolkata, one in Siliguri and with different hotel and retail chains.WBLDCL deals primarily with the production, processing and marketing of hygienic meat products of different types, like chicken, pork, chevon (adult goat meat), mutton, duck, quail, emu, vanaraja chicken (chicken breed bred for rural areas) and turkey. The organisation also sells non-meat products like table eggs, duck eggs, quail eggs, pure mustard oil, ghee and honey.The corporation has two modern hygienic meat processing units in Haringhata of Nadia district  one for pork products and the other for chicken, duck, goat and lamb.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

(Photo: Sarah Hafeez) Rashid Mushahid with a customer at Jama Masjid. (Photo: Sarah Hafeez)Rashid Mushahid goes by many names  he calls himself a hakim or a kaano ka doctor, most of Old Delhi refers to him as one of the lal topi waale, while his colleague, Jamal, simply calls him a kan melia or ear cleaner.Mushahid, a member of the Banjara community whose ancestors migrated to Delhi from Uttar Pradeshs Moradabad three centuries ago, says he has been keeping alive the shahi kaam of cleaning ears. His ancestors, he says, served in the royal Mughal households and were privy to palace intrigues and gossip. While the tradition has been reduced to a roadside service, it still has some takers.Perched on a stair leading to Jama Masjid, Mushahid sports a red skullcap, a cloth satchel slung over his right shoulder and a green towel over his left. He happens to catch a glimpse of Kamal, a 24-year-old who lives on the mosque premises, cleaning and doing menial jobs there.I have always got my ears cleaned by kan melias. I dont use earbuds, says Kamal as Mushahid sits down to work, pulling out a slender ear pick and wrapping a wad of cotton around the spatula before peering down Kamals right ear.The elaborate service, which costs Rs 20, involves several rounds of cleaning  once with plain cotton, the next with cotton dipped in hydrogen peroxide and, if needed, mustard oil. Cotton earbuds in the market irritate the ear and can rupture the ear drum. What I do is clean and heal the ear if it is inflamed or infected. That is why I still have enough customers to make around Rs 250 a day, Mushahid says.But the ear cleaners resent the suspicion they are met with. We have been providing an indispensable service for three centuries. But nowadays, people suspect we use unhygienic instruments which can pass on infections. Thats not true. We sanitise the picks with Dettol before each use, Jamal says.Mushahid says. There are roughly 1,000 more like me, scattered across Old Delhi, Connaught Place, India Gate and the New and Old Delhi railway stations.Things, though, are changing. I am in the trade but my children are studying, so they dont have to join me, says Mushahid.The red pagdi his ancestors proudly donned has been replaced by a thin cotton skullcap.

From the farmer in UPs Hathras who sells his spent animals, to the small-time vyapari through whom it reaches the supplier of a state-of the-art processing-cum-exporting unit in Aligarh, the buffalos journey.FOR Puran Chand Sharma, dealing with Mohammad Sabir Qureshi is a twice or maybe thrice-a-year affair. But this transactional relationship is essential to sustaining his dairy farm operation involving 10 female buffaloes  three now in-milk, two pregnant animals, two young yet-to-calve heifers, and three one-year-old calves.The ones that are pregnant will start giving milk when those currently producing go dry. In the meantime, the jhoti (heifers) will also be ready to conceive. So, at any time, Ill have three buffaloes together yielding 25-30 litres daily for me to sell at Rs 30-35 per litre, explains the 60-something Sharma. So, where does Qureshi come in? Prompt comes the reply: He takes care of the animals that have become a bojh (burden) on me.Sharma classifies the buffaloes that are a bojh into four categories. The first includes those that after about five lactations  by then, theyre 9-10 years old  have stopped producing enough milk to justify their continued maintenance. The second are infertile animals (we wont sell if they do not get pregnant the first time, but will if they dont the second time too). The third are the ones with damaged udders (jiske thun bekaar ho gaye). The last are male calves, sold even before they are a year old.These animals are of no use to me. If they are useful to him (Qureshi) and he is willing to pay me Rs 25,000 or more, why should I have a problem selling? That money I can use to buy a four-year-old, first-time lactating buffalo, capable of giving 2,000 litres annually, for Rs 60,000. This cycle of replacing old animals with new is what keeps my business going, Sharma says in a matter-of-fact tone.Farmer: Puran Chand Sharma. At Rs 6/kg for bhusa, Rs 20/kg each for khali and daliya, and Rs 40/kg for gur, it costs him Rs 100 a day to feed an unproductive animal and Rs 200-plus for a buffalo with a yield of 10 litres. So he sells his unproductive cattle for Rs 25,000 or more (Express Photo by Oinam Anand) Puran Chand Sharma. At Rs 6/kg for bhusa, Rs 20/kg each for khali and daliya, and Rs 40/kg for gur, it costs him Rs 100 a day to feed an unproductive animal and Rs 200-plus for a buffalo with a yield of 10 litres. So he sells his unproductive cattle for Rs 25,000 or more (Express Photo by Oinam Anand)Agrees Chaudhary Maharaj Singh, a 2.5-acre, five-animal farmer from Madhaka, the village in Sadabad tehsil of Uttar Pradeshs Hathras district to which Sharma belongs. A buffalo has to be fed 10 kg bhusa (wheat straw), 1 kg khali (mustard oilcake) and 1 kg daliya (ground wheat) every day, whether or not it produces milk. For 10 litres yield, I have to increase the khali to 4 kg and daliya to 2 kg, and also give 1 kg of gur (jiggery). At todays rates (Rs 6/kg for bhusa, Rs 20/kg each for khali and daliya, and Rs 40/kg for gur), it costs Rs 100 daily to feed an unproductive animal and Rs 200-plus for 10 litres, he says.Singhs relationship with Qureshi is, again, purely transactional. It doesnt concern me what he does with our buffaloes. All I know is we farmers cannot afford to feed them, he says.***Mohammad Sabir Qureshi, 25, is one among the many livestock vyaparis who procure and aggregate buffaloes that farmers such as Sharma and Singh see as having served their utility, even if they can continue to live for 15 years and beyond. The vyapari is the vital cog in the buffalo meat value chain, connecting the small dairy farmer in UPs rural hinterlands to the processor-exporter supplying to consumers in Vietnam, China, Malaysia, Thailand, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Egypt or Algeria.When business was good, Qureshi  his farmer clientele extends to 40-50 villages in Sadabad tehsil  could assemble up to eight animals within one-two days for transporting on a 14-foot Canter truck. But there was a one-month period  from around March 11 to April 10, after the Bharatiya Janata Party stormed into power in the UP Assembly elections  that saw no transactions at all. The new Yogi Adityanath administrations crackdown on illegal/unlicenced slaughterhouses and meat shops, coupled with heightened cow vigilante violence and police harassment on the ground, led to a virtual collapse of the livestock trade.Livestock trader: Mohammad Sabir Qureshi. He procures and aggregate buffaloes from farmers such as Sharma. When business was good, he could assemble up to eight animals within 1-2 days for transporting on a 14-foot Canter truck. But between March 11 to April 10, traders such as Qureshi bought no buffaloes. Now he just about manages a truckload once in 3-4 days as against 1-2 days earlier Mohammad Sabir Qureshi. He procures and aggregate buffaloes from farmers such as Sharma. When business was good, he could assemble up to eight animals within 1-2 days for transporting on a 14-foot Canter truck. But between March 11 to April 10, traders such as Qureshi bought no buffaloes. Now he just about manages a truckload once in 3-4 days as against 1-2 days earlierNo vyapari in our area purchased a single buffalo during that time. I used to get calls from many farmers to take their animals, but we were all too afraid to buy. Had we sat in our homes for a month or two more, the farmers themselves wouldve been on the streets, says Qureshi. Though the situation has improved a tad in recent weeks, I can just about manage to do a truckload once in three-four days now, as against one-two days earlier.Qureshi takes his animal truckloads mainly to Mohammad Kafil, who is a registered supplier for integrated abattoirs-cum-meat processing plants  such as the one at Talaspur Khurd, near Aligarh, owned by the Mumbai-based Allanasons Limited. Kafil is somebody on Allanasons records, technically authorised to supply to its plant on a commission basis and to whom payment is made through RTGS bank fund transfer. He, in turn, pays Qureshi independently in cash. Before this government came, I was supplying 100-150 buffaloes daily, which fell to zero through much of March and the first week of April. It has since recovered slightly to 60-70, but we still face lot of trouble from the police, Bajrang Dal and other gau rakshak (cattle protection) groups, says Kafil, who has 10-15 primary aggregators such as Qureshi working for him.***The meat exporters announce their purchase price for buffaloes, delivered at the plant, every 10-15 days. The rates are based not on the animals live weight, but carcass yield, usually about 45 per cent of the former. Thus, a buffalo whose live body weight is 400 kg would be assessed at a carcass yield of 180 kg. The carcass is basically the meat and bones left after the animal has been dressed (slaughtered) and stripped of its hide, head, horns, ears, feet, udders, fat, tissues and internal organs (heart, liver, kidney, spleen, lungs, stomach and intestines).The price the plants quote to their registered suppliers  who further communicate it to the vyaparis  is on a Rs per kg basis. If this is, say, Rs 150/kg, the delivered rate for a 400-kg buffalo with a carcass weight of 180 kg works out to Rs 27,000. The price that the farmer receives is determined after deducting commission fees to the registered supplier (normally Rs 0.50/kg of carcass; Rs 90 in this case) and the vyapari (Rs 500), besides expenses incurred towards transport, local levies and kharcha paani (incidental payments, including to the police).Broker: Registered suppliers such as Mohammad Kafil bring the animals to the plant where they are taken to a lairage (in picture) and rested for 24 hours before being moved to the dressing line.

(Express photo/Oinam Anand)According to Qureshi, the haulage cost for eight buffaloes, inclusive of loading and unloading charges, over a 60-km distance from Sadabad to Aligarh is roughly Rs 4,500. In addition, one has to shell out Rs 400-500 per truck at every police station/outpost  there are four of them (Kachhpura, Chandpa, Sasni and Hanuman Chowki) between Sadabad and Aligarh. Adding other costs (toll tax, levies, local transport of animal from farm, maintenance at aggregation point, etc) takes the total deductions to Rs 1,700-1,800 per buffalo. The farmer, at the end of it, gets Rs 25,200-25,300 for his spent buffalo.Sourcing from farmers is the easiest part. For us, the real problem is in taking the buffaloes to the processing plant. Theres always the risk of police impounding our trucks or the animals being freed by gau rakshaks. All this ultimately increases our costs, points out Kafil.The most convenient tool to extract kharcha paani is via invoking provisions of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act or asking the vyapari to produce a fitness to travel certificate issued by a government veterinary doctor for the animals. Procuring such certificates isnt easy when there arent too many veterinarians around, and even more difficult for the small-time vyapari aggregating buffaloes from farmers in remote villages.***Allanasons Aligarh plant has a registered capacity for dressing and processing meat from 2,000 buffaloes a day. Like most others abattoirs in UP, it had to close down for a week after the Yogi government was sworn in on March 19, as buffalo arrivals ground to a halt. The plant is currently getting 1,000-odd buffaloes  below its past daily average of 1,500  even as the threat of disruptions to livestock movement remains. All five units in Unnao, for instance, have shut this week, following a district administration order under which no animal would be allowed entry into a plant without a valid fitness-to-travel certificate.Abattoirs-cum-meat processing plant: Buffalo meat being processed into various cuts at the Allanasons plant in Aligarh. Plants such as this one quote a price to suppliers, who further communicate it to the vyapari. If the price is, say, Rs 150/kg, the rate for a 400-kg buffalo with a carcass weight of 180 kg works out to Rs 27,000. The price that the farmer receives is determined after deducting commission fees to the supplier and the trader.

The price that the farmer receives is determined after deducting commission fees to the supplier and the trader. (Express photo/Oinam Anand)UP has 41 of Indias 73 buffalo abattoirs/meat processing plants approved by the Agricultural & Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA) under the Union Commerce Ministry. While some of them  Allanasons units at Aligarh and Unnao or the Abu Dhabi-based LuLu Groups at Barabanki and Rampur  have the capacity to handle over 1,000 animals per day, the majority do about 750. Getting enough animals to ensure minimum capacity utilisation, which wasnt an insurmountable problem during the previous regimes, is the single biggest challenge facing these units today.The Aligarh plant, which is spread over 40 acres and originally came up in 2010, has entailed an investment upwards of Rs 250 crore. It has all facilities, starting with a reception where the buffaloes brought in trucks are unloaded, tagged and subjected to an ante-mortem inspection by the units veterinary team to check for disease-free, non-milking and non-pregnant status. Once cleared, they are taken to a lairage and rested for 24 hours before being moved to the dressing line.Since slaughtering happens through halal  the Shariah-compliant method of slitting just the carotid artery, jugular vein, food pipe and windpipe in a single swipe  it ensures all the blood is drained out from the animal. This is collected and sent to a separate rendering facility for drying and conversion into a high-protein blood meal used as fish feed. Slaughter is followed by removal of hide, feet, fat, tissues and various organs and offals. Most of these are again sold independently  the hide to leather tanneries; fat (tallow) to soap and lubricant makers; and ear, hooves, liver, heart, lungs, food pipe, intestines, bladder, udders, and abomasum (the fourth stomach compartment) to the pet-food industry. There is a separate edible food market also for the other three bovine stomach chambers: omasum, reticulum and rumen. If this werent enough, the ingesta or undigested food in the stomach, too, is recovered and dried for use as plant boiler fuel.The dressed carcass that remains is weighed, washed and then chilled for 24 hours  primarily to arrest microorganism development  prior to deboning. The bones go to the rendering facility for processing into gel chips, sold to manufacturers of gelatine used in drug capsules and various food products. The deboned meat constitutes some 68 per cent of the carcass weight. Ergo, from a 400-kg buffalo with 180-kg carcass yield, 122.4 kg of boneless meat can be produced for export. The boneless buffalo meat is processed into various cuts  tenderloin, shin/shank, rump steak, blade, silverside, etc  and weighed, packed and frozen to minus 18 degrees Celsius, before being despatched by refrigerated trucks for final shipping in containers.***At an average Rs 200/kg export price, the 122.4 kg of boneless meat would fetch close to Rs 24,500. Another Rs 5,500-6,000  it could be more  can be realised through sale of hide, gel bones, offals and other by-products. That would make for gross revenues of around Rs 30,000, of which Rs 25,000-plus or 83 per cent goes to farmers. The farmers share would, of course, drop as the animals are brought in from longer distances, pushing up both transport costs and various incidental expenses.Our estimate is that the farmers payout would be at least 60 per cent of the industrys turnover. We probably give more than what even dairy plants give for milk, claims Fauzan Alavi, director at Allanasons Limited.Indias buffalo meat exports rose spectacularly, almost five-folds in quantity terms and over 22 times in value terms from 2002-03 to 2014-15, before tailing off somewhat in the last two years. The boom in exports (Rs 26,303 crore during the last fiscal) came even as the countrys buffalo population increased from 97.92 million in 2003 to 108.70 million in 2012, while also going up from 22.91 million to 30.63 million for UP during this period.We have not grown at dairys expense. On the contrary, our industry is complementary to the White Revolution. If the government is serious about doubling farmers income, they cannot afford to ignore livestock that includes both milk and meat, says Alavi.It remains to be seen whether that argument will wash with the Yogi government.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

He was 60.Cardiac specialists at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) tried to resuscitate him for more than an hour before declaring him dead around 9:45am.Dave, a member of the Rajya Sabha since 2009, was sworn in as a minister with independent charge of environment, forest and climate change last year. He was reportedly unwell since January this year and was also not attending office.The minister is unwell and has not been coming to office on regular basis. We brief him at his residence, a senior environment ministry official had told HT on Wednesday, a day before his death.Dave was rushed to the cardiology department around 9am after he complained of uneasiness, shortness of breath and chest pain.He was brought straight to the cardio- thorasic tower two at the hospital and admitted into the cardiac care unit (ccu), which is the Intensive Care Unit for cardiac emergencies, said a source in the hospital, requesting anonymity as the person is not authorised to speak to media.Doctors tried hard to revive him, but his condition kept on deteriorating, said the source.Dave was under the care of Dr Gautam Sharma, professor in the department of cardiology at the hospital.His body is being taken from the AIIMS Mortuary to the department of anatomy for embalming. It will be flown to his hometown Indore later for the last rites.AIIMS released an official statement that said Dave was brought to AIIMS in a state of cardiac arrest. All possible measures were taken immediately at AIIMS, but he could not survive and declared dead around 9.45 am.His death was condoled by senior politicians, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi who said he was in a meeting with Dave on Wednesday evening and described the demise as a personal loss.Anil Madhav Dave ji will be remembered as a devoted public servant. He was tremendously passionate towards conserving the environment, Modi tweeted.Absolutely shocked by the sudden demise of my friend & a very respected colleague, Environment Minister Anil Madhav Dave ji. My condolences.  Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) May 18, 2017Anil Madhav Dave ji will be remembered as a devoted public servant. He was tremendously passionate towards conserving the environment.  Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) May 18, 2017Born in Barnagar in Madhya Pradesh, Dave was a Rashtriya Swyamsewak Sangh (RSS) member since childhood. His first major political assignment was as an adviser to then Madhya Pradesh chief minister Uma Bharti in 2004.He then went into political oblivion for sometime as Bharti was replaced by Shivraj Singh Chouhan. But, then he started working on environment related issues on Narmada in Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat and was nominated to the Rajya Sabha in 2009.Those close to him said Modi was impressed with his organisation of a seminar on Hinduism and rivers at an event during 2015 Ujjain Kumbh.Experts from across the world attended the three-day conference inaugurated by the PM. A few months later, he was nominated as environment minister, replacing Prakash Javadekar.From the start, the minister had shown his disdain for civil society activists and had told the HT that he will not talk with those who give speeches sitting in air-conditioned offices.He had also rubbished a Health Effects Institute study that said that 1.1 million Indians died because of air pollution in 2015 and requested the health ministry to conduct study on impact of air pollution.As environment minister, Dave had fastened approval of Indias first river-linking project Ken-Betwa falling in Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh.On Wednesday, the Forest Advisory Committee (FAC) gave its conditional principle approval to the project that will submerge one-third of Panna tiger reserve in Madhya Pradesh and will irrigate 6.35 lakh hectares of land in drought- prone Bundelkhand.Dave took several policy initiatives, including delegating power to give environment clearance to building projects to the state governments and time-bound approval to projects.He pushed approval for genetically modified Mustard which was stalled for the last two years. The Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC) last week recommended to the government its commercial release."
5a0534449855b76bf13c01ad,Why agriculture matters: An irony,http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/why-agriculture-matters-an-irony-4694780/,2017-06-08,"The reason why agriculture cannot be the dominant source of livelihood is that levels of productivity and hence living standards can never approach. The reason why agriculture cannot be the dominant source of livelihood is that levels of productivity and hence living standards can never approach.The reasons that agriculture matters are well-known: it provides sustenance to so many, food to all, and employment to many. In addition to these intrinsic positive reasons to invest in agriculture, there are other instrumental reasons: poor agricultural performance can lead to inflation, political and social disaffection, and restiveness all of which can hold back the economy. There are intrinsic as well as instrumental reasons for prioritising agriculture.But we must be clear and honest about one important link. The Nobel Prize winner, Sir Arthur Lewis, showed that economic development is always and everywhere about getting people out of agriculture and of agriculture becoming over time a less important part of the economy (not in absolute terms but as a share of GDP). But this must happen along with rapid productivity growth, ensuring rising farm incomes and adequate food supplies for the people. The reason why agriculture cannot be the dominant source of livelihood is that levels of productivity and hence living standards can never approach and have historically never approached those in manufacturing and services. That, of course, means that we must get our industrialization and urbanization right for the alternatives toagriculture to become meaningful, prosperous alternatives.When Dr. Ambedkar, famously derided the village as ?a sink of localism, a den of ignorance, narrow mindedness and communalism,? he was perhaps on to a deeper truth an Indian social complement to the Lewisian economic insight that in the long run people need to move and be moved out of agriculture. Dr. Ambedkar was warning about the patronization of agriculture masquerading as a romanticization of rural India.So the irony is this: we must care deeply about farmers and agriculture today because we want there to be fewer but more productive and prosperous farms and farmers tomorrow. In other words, all good and successful development is about facilitating this transition in the context of a prosperous agriculture and of rising productivity in agriculture not least because that will facilitate good urbanization and rising productivity in other sectors of the economy.So, today, I am going to provoke to force us all into collective self-reflection on the state of agriculture and its future. It is easy for me or for anyone  to list 10 or 20 different things that need to be done to improve our agricultural performance: stem the deterioration in agricultural research, educational, and extension institutions, improve resilience, incentivize drip irrigation, etc. But it is as easy to list them as it is perhaps useless. Because for any improvement or reform that all the experts recommend, we have to ask the simple question: ?If that is so obviously good for agriculture why hasnt it happened already? Or, put differently, ?What it is about today that will make these proposals successful when they have demonstratively failed to persuade in the past?Rather, I want to ask a question or tentatively pose a hypothesis: is it possible that we actually love some crops (cereals) and their farmers too much and, for all the pious professions and mythologizing, and other crops and their farmers not enough. To put it more bluntly, perhaps we are now smothering cereals with too much government support and other cropspulses, dairy, oilseeds, livestock, and fruits and vegetablesnot enough?The SuccessesBefore I elaborate on the main themes of my talk today, I would like to take stock of our achievements and shortcomings in agriculture. Given where we began in 1947, Indian agriculture has come a long way. We have achieved food security  at least on the major crops; rural poverty rates have declined substantially; agricultural incomes have risen; nutrition levels have risen.In terms of successes, I would highlight the following: The green revolution transformed Indian agriculture by increasing yields of wheat and rice, especially in Northern and then in Southern India. Credit here goes to international research but perhaps even more so to Indian scientists, agronomists and researchers, extension workers in public institutions that completed the link from technology to actual farm output.The white revolution that transformed the Indian dairy sector, increasing milk production, reducing dependence on imports, creating vibrant and participating institutional structures on agriculture and founding a vibrant consumer goods industry based on diary. Credit here goes, of course, to Dr. Kurien, leader of the Kheda Cooperative movement, and enlightened leadership of the NDDB. In addition to these sectoral successes, there have been, other regional achievements cotton in Gujarat, Maize in Bihar, Sugar in Uttar Pradesh, wheat in Madhya Pradesh, potatoes in West Bengal.Smothering with love: Cereal-CentricityThink of how and how much we support cereal and especially rice production. They are too numerous to exhaustively enumerate. The government helps the farmers through policies that affect the prices of outputs and inputs; through schemes and through institutions. We provide minimum support prices to farmers and the benefits accrue mainly to farmers who produce marketable output and that too mostly in cereals and wheat, which in turn is confined largely to a few States, notably in the North (Punjab and Haryana).We then provide subsidies for power, water, fertilizer (now the second largest subsidy), seeds, credit, we exempt agricultural income from income taxes, and we periodically grant loan waivers. The figure above shows how clearly agricultural incomes in Punjab and Haryana exceed those in the rest of India to get a sense of this biased smothering with love.Smothering with love: Big not Small FarmersThere is a second aspect to this smothering with love: not only does it mainly benefit the cereal farmers, it also tends to favour larger farmers, or at least it does not adequately reach the smaller farmer. Several examples: by definition, the exemption of agricultural income from tax favours those with larger incomes. In fertilizer, we estimated in the Economic Survey that only about one-third of the total subsidy went to small and marginal farmers. On agricultural credit, there is now growing evidence that not all of this goes to farmers. On the loan waiver, it is surprising how little the small and marginal farmer borrow from formal financial institutions (less than 50%) and how much from informal sources, while the large farmer relies on formal sources to the extent of about 75%; on power, we estimated in the Economic Survey that the bottom quintile received about 10% of the total subsidy while the top quintal about 37% because of highly skewed electricity consumption.But is there something as loving too much? The experience of Punjab is perhaps suggestive. Thanks to support, incomes are high and amongst the highest but there is growing evidence that this is proving now to be counter-productive. Punjab has lost most of its earlier agricultural dynamism. Between 1971-72 and 1985-86, agricultural growth was 5.7% percent compared to the All-India number of 2.3 percent. Since 2005-06, its average agricultural growth has declined to 1.6% compared to Indias 3.5%.One can hazard that Punjabs dynamism will only be restored if it weans itself off its agriculture that has taken a toll of its water resources, soil quality, and human health (refer to cancer district). Its fading dynamism may be in part due to the excessive support that its agriculture receives.Loving Too LittleIf we love some crops too much, perhaps we love many of the others too little. I have in mind here pulses, dairy and livestock, fruits and vegetables, and oilseeds. How do we love them too little? In the case of pulses, commendable efforts have been made to increase procurement at MSP (MSP without procurement, it must be emphasized, offers little comfort for farmers) and this Kharif season there was indeed a substantial increase to 2 million (out of a total output of 8.7 million). Despite this, it is estimated that about 60% of the record Tur output was sold at less than MSP, resulting in depressed income. Stock limits and export restrictions kept market prices low; had they been eased the fortunes of farmers would have been better.I think we misunderstand an important economic insight here that we highlighted in the pulses report. Some of the loving-too-little occurs because of the perception of a tension between farmer and powerful middle-class consumer interests. This leads to a response that creates policy volatility and pro-cyclicality, which increases price uncertainty for farmers: so when prices go up, export restrictions are imposed, and when prices decline, import restrictions are imposed and so on. But this perception and the consequent policy action do not adequately recogonize a fundamental alignment of interests. Lower farmer prices today will adversely affect future agricultural supplies (especially in crops that are predominantly produced domestically such as pulses, fruits and vegetables) which will increase consumer prices tomorrow. So, even over reasonable planning and political horizons, what is good for the farmer is good for the consumer.On fruits and vegetables, restrictions on selling imposed via APMCs are perhaps taking a toll. The government has created an electronic common market and the results are awaited. On dairy and livestock, two points are worth emphasizing. Governments have the right to choose their social policies. But in doing so they must be fully aware of the economic costs of these policies. If social policies impede the workings of the livestock market, the impact on the economics of livestock farming could be considerable. These must be costed for appropriate choices to be made.Second, it must be recognized that the economics of livestock farming, and hence the fate and future of this source of livelihood will depend critically on the terminal value of assets, in this case the no-longer-productive livestock. If social policies drive this terminal value precipitously down, private returns could be affected in a manner that could make livestock farming less profitable (and recent research by Anagol, Etang and Karlan (2013)NBER Working paper No. 19437suggests that returns to livestock farming are in any case very low and even negative) . This declining terminal value arises both because of the loss of income from livestock as meat and the additional costs that will arise from having to maintain unproductive livestock. But there is more. It is possible that social policies could affect social returns even more adversely. Stray cattle, and a lot of it, will have to be looked after, otherwise diseases (foot and mouth) could spread, leading to health hazards and social costs.(Let me add as an aside that responding to changing consumer preference for proteins, which Indians under-consume to the detriment of their health, needs both reduced cereal-centricity, and at the same time promotingnot hindering alternative sources of protein from pulses, dairy and livestock). Finally, there is technology that again is especially important for pulses, oil seeds and dairy. Harish Damodaran of the Indian Express has written persuasively about the choices we face on GM. To paraphrase him, it seems that the patronization of farmers masquerading as romanticization is rife.This must be addressed rationally even beyond mustard. If we want farmers to benefit from new technology we must allow them these benefits regardless of the provenance of the technologies just as we do in other sectors. Expropriating property rights retroactively and undermining sanctity of contracts as sought by voices on opposing ends of the ideological spectrum could impede the flow of technology and thus end up hurting not helping farmers. To be sure, we must absolutely ensure that there is no abuse of patent rights or other monopolistic practices but the right instruments must be chosen; moreover, there must always be an underlying cost-benefit analysis but an analysis as farmers themselves would do it rather than as how the analysis might be done for them.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd"
5981a59c9855b768c1b03a8d,Seeds of relief for farmers,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170617/jsp/business/story_157272.jsp,2017-06-17,"New Delhi, June 16: The prices of hybrid seeds for the coming kharif season 2017-18 will be cut by 10 per cent, bringing some relief to debt-ridden farmers. However, the price cut, to be effective from June 19, will not include cotton seeds that are already regulated by the government. The seed industry agreed to cut the prices after a meeting with Union agriculture minister Radha Mohan Singh. The minister later tweeted, ""I appreciate the seed industry for making a collective decision in favour of farmers by reducing the hybrid seed MRP by 10 per cent."" ""The industry agreed to make arrangements for the sale of hybrid seeds at prices 10 per cent below the MRP printed on the seed packets effective from June 19,"" M. Prabhakar Rao, president of the National Seed Association, said. The retail prices of hybrid seeds range between Rs 300 per kg and Rs 500 per kg. Hybrid seeds are sold for crops such as corn, rice, bajra, mustard and vegetables. Rao said the prices ""are for the kharif season. We will review for rabi season later"". Besides the National Seeds Association, representatives from the Federation of Seed Industry of India (FSII) were present at the meeting. Global seed companies Monsanto, Bayer and Sygental are members of the FSII. More than 80 per cent of the seeds sown in the country are hybrids. The size of the hybrid market is about Rs 6,000 crore. Earlier this week, the Union cabinet had approved an interest subvention scheme worth Rs 20,339 crore under which farmers will continue to get short-term loans up to Rs 3 lakh. The decision came in the wake of the Centre facing criticism for its agrarian policies, which the critics said had not benefitted the farmers on the ground. While Uttar Pradesh has announced a Rs 30,000-crore farm loan waiver, Maharashtra has waived loans worth Rs 35,000 crore. However, finance minister Arun Jaitley has said states will need to generate their own funds to facilitate these waivers. Farmers are saddled with a huge inventory of foodgrains from last year's harvest, while higher production on account of a good monsoon is expected to lower prices further. Faced with the price fall, farmers have sown pulses over 2.22 lakh hectares so far in the 2017-18 kharif season, down 38 per cent from the last season. Much of the kharif crops are sown during the monsoon period, between July and September. However, farmers are sowing early in some parts with assured irrigation"

It's just not milk or cooking oil, prized spices too are heavily adulterated, according to officials of National Institute of Nutrition ""Many times, papaya seeds are grounded and mixed with synthetic gum to make it seem like black-pepper.This happens as pepper is costly and mixing them with papaya seeds makes it cheaper for miscreants,"" Dr V Sudarshan Rao, a scientist from the Food Safety Division of NIN , told TOI.Following black pepper, the next most adulterated food item is fennel, which is mixed with sodium hydrosulphite. ""This is then blended with sawdust and brick dust and sold in the market as masala powder,"" said an official from Nutrition Society of India.Not just food meant for daily consumption, even cold drinks and ice-creams are mixed with high quantities of glycerol monostearate, an emulsifying agent, which is meant to be used in moderate amounts as prescribed by Food Standards and Safety Authority of India (FSSAI).""People are not aware that in current times, everything we eat could be adulterated. Earlier, the practice was limited to mixing rice with stones to fudge weight. Now, it has become modern with miscreants using chemicals. Even mustard oil is sold by mixing it with a low-grade oil. There's no mechanism in place to curb this menace,"" said Dr B Sesikiran, director of NSI ""While the food regulator has to monitor, check and penalize people who adulterate food, nothing moves on the ground. Till punishment is harsh, you cannot expect to have safe food,"" he said.TIMES VIEW:While its a welcome move that cops have finally launched a sustained crackdown against adulteration of spices and other food items in the city, efforts must be made to ensure that these traders do not get back to their old practice. Authorities should also ensure that these offenders get strict punishment and are not allowed to get away with minor penalties for playing with lives of people on a daily basis."
5a05cfff9855b76bf13c1106,Modified approaches,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170628/jsp/opinion/story_158981.jsp,2017-06-28,"The Central biotech regulator, the Genetic Engineering Approval Committee has recommended the commercial use of genetically modified or GM mustard after much deliberation and several rounds of field trials. It is believed that GM mustard would be beneficial for agricultural growth in the country and would end India's dependence on other countries for the import of edible oil. At present, India imports edible oil worth 11 million dollars, nearly one-third of what the country gains by exporting agricultural commodities. After three years of deliberation, the biotech regulator has agreed to its limited use for commercial purposes from the coming rabi season. GM mustard seeds have been developed in an Indian laboratory and by a group of scientists from the Delhi University, which makes it a truly desi product. The project was funded by two national organizations, the National Dairy Development Board (the largest producer and supplier of the Dhara brand of oil) and the government's department of biotechnology. The idea behind this new project was to make the country self-reliant in mustard oil production. Countries like the United States of America, Brazil, Argentina, China and others are using GM seeds for the production of maize, soya bean, cotton, canola, papaya and paddy. In the US, 72.9 million hectares of land are being used for the production of GM crops. Brazil is using roughly 49 million hectares of land. At present, India is trying out only with BT cotton in 10.8 million hectares. Because of stiff opposition from activists, the introduction of BT brinjal was stalled in 2010. Since 2013, GM mustard has been opposed by activists on the ground that the new seeds can pose serious scientific and technical challenges to farmers, besides causing environmental degradation and health hazards. Activists allege that no attempt has been made to share field trial data with the farmers. The Supreme Court will have to take a call on this contentious issue in the coming months. Before the new seeds cause another spate of farmers' suicides something needs to be done. The GM mustard seeds have been opposed on other counts too. Aruna Rodrigues, an activist, argued that the Centre's preliminary clearance to GM mustard, named Dhara Mustard Hybrid-11 (DMH-11), contravenes a 2013 report by a Supreme Court-appointed technical expert committee. This committee had said, among other things, that herbicide-tolerant crops ought not to be permitted in India. One of the genes in DMH-11, developed by researchers, contains 'bar' that makes it herbicide tolerant. This makes plants resistant to a class of insecticide containing the chemical, glufosinate. After the disastrous consequences of using BT cotton seeds in Vidarbha, Maharashtra and other parts of the country, questions are being raised about the efficacy of GM mustard. Initially, in the 1990s, BT cotton seeds were imported in a clandestine manner bypassing all checks and control by government agencies. The farmers were told by the agents of the wholesale dealers that BT cotton output would ensure a quantum jump in the cotton production. The cost of production of the new crop was three to four times higher, farmers had to borrow money at a high rate of interest from moneylenders. After sowing, they waited, only to find insecticides destroying the cotton fields. The disaster led to a large number of farmers' suicides. In the early 1990s, nearly one thousand farmers committed suicide by consuming pesticide in Maharashtra alone. Why did the farmers use new genetically modified BT cotton seeds of the multinational company called Monsanto in the 1990s? One answer to this question is that they took the risk because they had gained some kind of confidence in using new seeds after the successful introduction of high yielding varieties and various other inputs during the Green Revolution. Moreover, different types of HYV seeds were also introduced by the Indian agricultural research institutes with which farmers had no problems. However, the simple narratives of risk and trust fell apart when BT cotton seeds were introduced: the new seeds gave farmers a nightmare and within a short time cotton cultivation with the new seeds was abandoned in many parts of the country. Other problems aggravated the crises in Maharashtra, like adulterated and spurious inputs, lopsided flow of institutional credits and indebtedness, the mismatch between the expected and actual yield of cotton, the breakdown of the joint family system, ecological factors like soil degradation owing to the excessive use of chemicals and fertilizers. The factors worked in a complicated way in leading to suicides. However, the Green Revolution made scientific knowledge popular among farmers. Agricultural innovations with new HYV seeds has changed the contours of local knowledge about farming in the last five decades. Science made inroads into the world of local knowledge in remote areas in agriculturally backward states like Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan. The triumph of science over traditional techniques of cultivation helped farmers gain trust in new discoveries, especially in seeds, fertilizers and pesticides. Constant interaction between agricultural scientists and farmers made it easier to spread Green Revolution technology. Agricultural scientists made it a point to ensure that farmers became important stakeholders in spreading this in rural areas; frequent field trials by agricultural scientists helped bridge the gap between scientists and farmers. The disaster in Vidarbha has broken the trust that farmers gained after the Green Revolution and it has allowed local knowledge to regain lost ground. Indian agriculture would hardly benefit if scientific knowledge does not percolate down to the villages. Science has an important role to play in augmenting agricultural production and from this point of view new seeds or GM crops can fulfil two primary objectives: first, they can increase food production and second, they can make India self-sufficient in producing edible oil and cotton. In order to fulfil these two broader objectives, science has to reach those who till the land. But this is not happening with GM seeds; farmers are being ignored by the State and by scientists. Before introducing GM mustard, it would be necessary to involve farmers, the main stakeholders, in this new venture. In many parts of India, farmers are well-organized; they are controlled either by unions or by their caste associations. Sometimes they join hands without taking support from unions or caste associations as is the case in the present farmers' agitation in Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra. In West Bengal, the Left Front paid a heavy price for not consulting peasants before land acquisition in Singur and Nandigram. A spontaneous agrarian struggle forced the state government to abandon land acquisition. On a contentious issue like the introduction of GM crops, farmers should get an opportunity to express their opinion. After all they are the main stakeholders, they must be heard."

Since agriculture makes up roughly 15% of India's GDP, a 4.5 to 9.0% negative impact on production implies cost of climate change to be roughly at 1.5% of GDP per year,"" reads the report.The committee said that various studies indicated overall reduction in productivity by 4-6% in rice, 6% in wheat, 18% in maize, 2.5% in sorghum, 2% in mustard and 2.5% in potato besides significant regional variability. Also, the committee has projected production deficit of 33% for cereals by 2015 and of 43% by 2050. Meanwhile, for pulses, the deficit has been projected at 3% by 2025 and 7% by 2050.Consequently, the committee has suggested that enhancing agricultural productivity is critical for ensuring food and nutritional security for all, particularly poor, small and marginal farmers who would be affected the most.Further, the committee found that the total post-harvest losses to agricultural commodities are estimated to be from 6 to 18% and nearly 30% of the agricultural produce harvested is lost due to inadequate storage facilities in the country, including in Punjab and Haryana.On over exploitation of ground water, the committee found that the Central Ground Water Board ( CGWB ) has submitted plan for artificial recharge in 442 over exploited ground water blocks in Punjab, Harayana, Andhra Pradesh , Karnataka, Maharashtra, Rajasthan,Tamilnadu, Telangana and Uttar Pradesh.The report says that as per the ministry of earth sciences, during the period 1901-2010, heavy rainfall events (rainfall exceeding 15 cm in 24 hours) over northern parts of the country show an increasing trend of about 6% per decade. Also, as per 5th IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) report, climate projections developed for India for the 2050s indicate an increase in the average temperature by 2-4C during that period, an overall decrease in rainy days by more than 15 days in western and central India and an increase by 5-10 days near foothills of Himalayas and north-east India.The IPCC has also analyzed that there has been a decrease in rainfall in the month of July but there has been an increase in rains in June as well as August across the country indicating a change in the rainfall pattern.The committee observed that animal husbandry and cattle rearing are important source of income for majority of farmers in Punjab, Haryana and other parts of the country.However, it expressed that national plan on dairying has ignored indigenous varieties of cattle leading to over dependence on crossbred varieties for milk production despite the fact that indigenous varieties of cattle possess many traits such as heat tolerance that can be very effective in future scenario projected for climate change.Mainly focusing on climate change effect on agriculture, the committee was of the view that there will be changes in consumption patterns in coming decades due to increasing rate of urbanization and increased income of households. It has been found that demand for fruits, vegetables, dairy products, meat, poultry and fisheries will increase at faster rate than that of food grains. The need for a climate-resilient approach to agriculture is critical for India where more than 80 percent agriculturists are small farmers and the warming trend in India over the past 100 years has indicated an increase of 0.60C, says the report."
5a1484889855b76bf13e521d,Cattle and cash curbs stoke farm revolt,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170925/jsp/nation/story_174909.jsp,2017-09-25,"Cattle graze on a field off the Sikar-Jaipur highway Sikar, Sept. 24: A 13-day agitation by Rajasthan's farmers, joined by about 100 disc jockeys with sound systems blaring, has forced the Vasundhara Raje government to agree to loan waivers up to Rs 50,000 and payment of the full minimum support price. Some 15,000 farmers had gathered at a mandi in Sikar town, 115km from Jaipur, on September 1 and by the time the government buckled on September 13 night, their strength had grown to nearly one lakh, according to spearhead All India Kisan Sabha. On September 9, the Sikar district DJs' association sent a cavalcade of over 100 sound system-fitted cars to join the protests. ""We too come from farming families, which too are burdened with loans,"" explained Babulal, a DJ who performs at weddings and other celebrations. While the mainstay of the movement was Sikar, where the Kisan Sabha has a strong base, the organisation with less than 4 lakh members in the state managed to mobilise support in 13 other districts too. Traders observed a day's strike in Sikar in support of the farmers and provided the agitators with food and water. Vasundhara Raje ""The trader who sells farm equipment is burdened with the goods and services tax. He knows that if the farmer is unable to sell his crop, he cannot buy the trader's products,"" said Navrang Lal, a trader from neighbouring Neemrana. Amra Ram, the All India Kisan Sabha national president and a four-time ex-legislator from the CPM, admits that the farmers have merely won the first round. ""A farmer has to first fight to get his demands accepted, and a second time to have them implemented. We are ready,"" he said in his chamber at ""Comrade Bhavan"", the district CPM headquarters in Sikar. A series of central government decisions over the past one year - from demonetisation to cattle sale curbs and the goods and services tax - had left farmers and allied traders reeling. Several decisions of the state's BJP government compounded the problems. Rajasthan, the only state with a full-fledged ministry dedicated to cows, imposed a 10 per surcharge on stamp duty on non-judicial instruments this year to raise money to protect cows. But the farmers say they have had enough of cow protection - it's they themselves who need protection now. Since the central government banned animal markets from transacting cattle sales for slaughter, farmers have been burdened with unproductive cows they can't sell - or have to sell locally at throwaway prices. Barbed fences, or makeshift barriers made of branches tied together to stave off old stray cattle, are common sights now across crop fields in Rajasthan. ""This isn't all. The government has laid down that a calf cannot be separated from its mother for the first six months of its life,"" said Ram Partap Bagariya, resident of Rashidpura near Sikar. ""We need the milk - for our families and to sell to customers. How'd we survive without the milk?"" Another problem, the farmers say, was that the state government did not pay the promised minimum support price for their crops. ""Across the border in Madhya Pradesh, farmers were selling onions at Rs 8 a kg while in Rajasthan they got half the price. Nor did the government procure mustard. We suffered heavy losses,"" said Dhani Ram of Reengus. Rajasthan produces 11 per cent of India's pulses, second only to Madhya Pradesh, but this year the growers faced ruin. While they invested Rs 13,000 per hectare of chickpea, the crop sold at Rs 4,800 a hectare. For green gram, the investment was Rs 9,000 per hectare and sold at Rs 3,000. ""Last year, 15 to 20 trucks carried barley from our mandi every day. This year, we have barely seen 4 to 5 truckloads a day,"" said Sandeep Agarwal, secretary of the Krishi Upaj Mandi in Sikar where the farmers had assembled for 13 days. ""In the case of mustard, the number of trucks has fallen from 30 to 3."" The state government has agreed to pay the minimum support price from October 1 while a task force will work out the details of the loan waiver after studying similar schemes in Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra and Punjab. The report will be submitted in a month's time. In June, Punjab had announced loan waivers of up to Rs 4 lakh for marginal farmers and Rs 2 lakh for small farmers, with the package expected to cost the exchequer around Rs 10,000 crore. Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra have announced waivers up to Rs 1 lakh, with the expected bills being Rs 36,359 crore and Rs 30,500 crore, respectively. Implementation has been riddled with controversy, though. This newspaper reported earlier this month how the Uttar Pradesh government had waived sums as low as Rs 27 and Rs 42 on loans of Rs 18,000 and Rs Rs 1 lakh. Amra Ram has his fingers crossed. ""In Maharashtra, farmers with pucca houses have been left out of the waiver scheme. Let's see what the government here comes up with,"" he said. The Kisan Sabha chief has a theory why the Rajasthan agitation succeeded at a time farmers from Tamil Nadu have been intermittently squatting at New Delhi's Jantar Mantar for months, waiting to be heard. ""Delhi is not bothered with what's happening thousands of kilometres away in the southern states. People from these states can't come to Delhi in large numbers,"" he said. ""But when a mass mobilisation happens anywhere in the Hindi belt, everyone takes notice."""
5a14c07a9855b76bf13e77ee,Mapping the not-so-normal monsoon,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/mapping-the-not-so-normal-monsoon/article19825298.ece,2017-10-09,"If youre statistically inclined, you may be celebrating the fact that the south-west monsoon for 2017, which is now bowing out, has turned out to be normal for the second consecutive year. But farmers know that there can be many shades of grey to an officially normal monsoon.Another bumper year?India has received a total 841.3 millimetres (mm) of rain in the south-west monsoon season from June 1 to September 30 this year.IMD deems the season normal if the all-India quantum of rain falls within a 10% range of its long-period average of 887.5 mm. The 2017 monsoon fell short of the number only by 5%. In fact, the cumulative rainfall numbers this year arent very different from 2016 when the country recorded 862 mm of rain. This may seem like good news. In 2016-17, India harvested a record crop of cereals (252.7 million tonnes) and managed a quantum jump in its output of both pulses (16.3 million tonnes in 2015 to 22.9 million tonnes in 2016) and oilseeds (25 to 32 million tonnes). This contributed to a significant bump-up in the agriculture leg of the GDP which grew 4.9% in FY17 compared with 0.7% in FY16.But expecting an encore of that impressive performance just because this years monsoon has turned out normal, would be unrealistic. More than the quantum of rainfall that is dumped on the sub-continent during the four critical months, it is the spatial and temporal distribution of rains that make or break crop prospects. On this score, the 2017 monsoon has been quite whimsical.Patchy distributionFor the purposes of measuring the spatial spread of rainfall, the IMD categorises India into 36 meteorological sub-divisions.IMDs wrap-up of the recent monsoon season tells us that in the just-concluded monsoon season, 5 of Indias 36 sub-divisions received excess rains, 25 received normal rains and 6 witnessed deficient rains. Last year, 4 sub-divisions were showered with excess rains, 23 were normal and 9 were deficient.But the devil really lies in the details and the identity of the States that suffered deficient rains really matter to crop prospects. This years monsoon has played truant in some key food-bowl States. For instance, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh and Punjab account for a lions share of kharif rice production. But this years monsoon has been 29% below normal in Uttar Pradesh and 22% short of normal in Punjab. West Bengal alone has enjoyed a near-normal season, as has much of the southern peninsula. Madhya Pradesh, which is a critical growing region for the rabi wheat crop, has seen a deficiency of 20%.Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Maharashtra are similarly critical for pulses output. Of these, while Rajasthan has received excess rains (8% above normal) and Maharashtra has been just about normal, rains playing truant in Madhya Pradesh look set to impact pulses output.While excess rains in Gujarat (19% above normal) could augur well for the groundnut and cotton crops, the patchy show in both Madhya Pradesh and Haryana (26% below normal) cloud the prospects for oilseeds such as soyabean, rapeseed, mustard and sunflower. There have also been wide variations between growing regions within each state, which can have a bearing on crop prospects.Weak endingMonth-wise rainfall patterns during the south-west monsoon also play a big role in deciding cropping area and yield. In 2016, the monsoon got off to a snail-paced start, but picked up pace in the latter half of the season.But this years monsoon has behaved in exactly the opposite fashion. After excess rains of about 4% and 2% against normal seasonal patterns in June and July, the months of August and September have seen all-India rainfall fall 12-13% short of normal levels. Good rains in the months of June and July may have contributed to good sowing and coverage of the kharif crops. But deficit rains in August and September could impact the eventual output by pruning crop yields.It is also important to note that rainfall in the last two months of the south-west monsoon dictate reservoir storage and soil moisture, both of which set the tone for the planting of the winter crops. Though there is much tracking and analysis of Indias south-west monsoon and the kharif crop, the rabi season has been equally important to the countrys agricultural prospects in recent years. Rabi output often matches or even exceeds the kharif output.The rabi season accounts for the whole of Indias wheat and gram harvest, a fourth of the output for coarse cereals and chips in with over a third of the yearly harvest of urad and moong. Oilseeds such as rapeseed and mustard, sunflower and safflower are also predominantly winter crops. Therefore, dry spells in the latter half of this monsoon, taken with deficient rains in key rabi growing regions, can make for less than rosy rabi prospects.All this could explain why the agriculture ministry, in its First Advance Estimates, has painted a somewhat muted picture of crop prospects for FY18. The estimates are based mainly on cropping and sowing patterns and a lot can change on yields and output, as the year progresses. But so far, it appears as if India will have a hard time living up to the 4.9% expansion in agriculture GVA that it so comfortably managed last year."

It shouldnt surprise if the money from sale of milk in litres, at the end of the year, adds up to more than that from the quintals of paddy or sugarcane.More than a fifth of Indias agricultural output by value today comes from milk. In 2014-15  the latest year for which detailed estimates at individual crop level is available  the value of milk production, at Rs 495,840.52 crore, for the first time, exceeded even the Rs 486,845.87 crore for foodgrains that includes all cereals and pulses.The accompanying table shows that in many states  virtually the entire northern belt covering Rajasthan, Haryana, Punjab, Jammu & Kashmir, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, plus Gujarat  milk accounts for over, or just under, a quarter of the value of their total output from farming and allied sectors. It puts paid to assumptions by policymakers and even academic scholars, who have for long viewed livestock farming as a subsidiary activity to regular crop agriculture.The subsidiary treatment to dairying may have some justification at an individual farmer level. Income from milk could well be lower than from their main crop for most farmers. However, even this might, in many cases, be obscured by the fact that milk marketing happens round-the-year, as opposed to the more visible money generated from the one-time sale of paddy, wheat, sugarcane or cotton. Bulk income from the so-called main crop may help marry ones daughter or build a new house, but the cash from milk sales is what is squirrelled away by the homemaker to meet the familys day-to-day expenses. It shouldnt surprise if the money from sale of milk in litres, at the end of the year, adds up to more than that from the quintals of paddy or sugarcane.Also, while a sugarcane grower may not cultivate cotton, just as mustard or chana farmers are unlikely to plant paddy, virtually all of them produce some quantity of milk. If every farmer is, by implication, a dairy farmer  a rising share of the milk that the Gujarat Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation (Amul) procures is now being supplied those having 30 or more animals, fed on fodder grown in-house(see The Big Picture: A new churning )  it makes all the more sense to discard the traditional subsidiary view of dairying.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

His body was brought to Deeg community health centre (CHC) for a post-mortem on Monday and has been handed over to the family.Bhagwan Singh was found hanging from an iron pole at 6 am on Monday by his wife, Hardei, who had gone there to serve him tea. He was sleeping in the cattle pen nearly 50 metre from the house.Villagers gathered at the spot after hearing Hardeis cries. They brought the body down and informed the police. According to the villagers, Singh was upset as he had a burden of agriculture debts from the bank and village moneylenders and had also suffered crop loss due to water shortage.Singh has two sons Jagat Singh who is pursuing graduation and Akash Singh, a class 9 student. His two daughters are married. Jagat Singh said that the family owned four acres of agriculture land in the village but it didnt harvest crops for last three-four years due to water shortage.My father had taken 5 lakh loan from a bank and 6 lakh from the village moneylenders for the wedding of his two daughters last year. He was worried about the huge debt, Jagat Singh said.Jogendra Singh, a villager, said that he had met Bhagwan Singh two days ago. He looked worried. He asked me for money to repay his debts, he said.Hardei said that they had got a notice from the bank a few days ago. Village moneylenders were also pressurising us to pay the debt, she added.Station house officer (SHO) of Deeg police Kanheya Lal said that the body has been kept at a mortuary. Villagers, including the deceaseds family, registered a complaint about the suicide due to the debt burden.Bharatpur zila parishad member Nem Singh said that farmers in the district have been facing water crisis for a long time. We have agitated several times to demand water from the Yamuna through Gungaon canal in Haryana but in vain, he said.Villagers, led by Nem Singh, handed over a memorandum for the Chief Minister to sub-division magistrate Dulichand Meena demanding debt waiver and compensation for the deceaseds family.Earlier, two farmers had committed suicide over crop failure in April and June.Rajasthan, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi and Himachal Pradesh signed a pact on May 12, 1994, to release 1,280 cusecs of Yamuna water for Bharatpur.According to the pact between Rajasthan and Haryana governments, the district should receive 500 cusecs of water every day through the Gurgaon canal. Not only water crisis, Bharatpur farmers have been facing frequent power cuts.The district produces 3.50 lakh tonnes of mustard on 2.10 lakh hectare of land. Nearly 3,90,313 hectare of agriculture land is affected with salinity out of the gross cropped area of 5,070,73 hectare in the district."
