From 28 metric tonnes of honey in 1997-98, Rajasthan today accounts for 4,100 metric tonnes, thanks to the contribution of Bharatpur that alone produces close to 1,800 tonnes.While states like Punjab, Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh still remain the strong traditional geographies contributing much of the 80,000 metric tonne that India produces annually, the vast expanses of mustard fields in Bharatpur are now drawing large colonies of the stripped honey-makers making it the number one district in the country in terms of quantity of production.A state that is still slotted by Khadi and Village Industries Commission (KVIV) as having least potential for apiculture, the sweet revolution was not without an intervention. In the early 1990s, Lupin Human Welfare and Research Foundation ( LHWRF ) sensed an opportunity in the pasturage of Bharatpur.We conducted surveys, which indicated good possibilities for beekeeping. In 1992-93, two entrepreneurs of village Aghapur and one of our employees were sent to Hissar Agriculture University for practical training. When they came back, they were given 20 boxes of bee colonies which were stationed at Aghapur in the close vicinity of Keoladeo National Park (KNP). The experiment failed due to an attack of wild bees of KNP over the domesticated bees, recalls Sita Ram Gupta , executive director of LHWRF.But the failure led to more experiments taking assistance from and working with Central Bee Research & Training Institute in Pune, KVIC and other agencies. The activities gained momentum again. SIDBI and mirco-finance institutions were roped in to provide finance. Wherever difficulties arose, Lupin chipped in with funding.Experimenting constantly, documenting and developing scientific practices, and empowering entrepreneurship skills has been the cornerstone of LHWRFs efforts for promoting beekeeping activity in the district. Providing training, exposure visits and access to finance were also key components of our strategy to popularize the activity, added Gupta.The success in Bharatpur intrigued chief minister Vasundhara Raje . In 2007, she appointed LHWRF as a nodal agency for a honey cluster development project to expand and organize the activity in the eastern districts of Rajasthan covering Hadauti region and Kota division. Keen to promote the low-cost and high returns economic activity, National Bee Board made LHWRF its member.Economically, bee-keeping is highly rewarding. A colony of 50 boxes is the ideal size for a person to start the activity which costs around Rs 3 lakh. The government provides subsidies up to 40%. But in the first year of the activity, the entrepreneur earns about Rs 2.40 lakh from selling honey. Raw honey is sold at Rs 100-125 per kg. Each box produces about 50 kg honey annually. So the entrepreneur gets back his entire investment in the first year of operation, said Bhim Singh , additional chief project coordinator, Lupin, Bharatpur.Gupta said LHWRF has supported about 3,000 bee-keeping entrepreneurs in Bharatpur who are mostly jobless youth and marginal farmers and the foundation has set a target to create 15,000 bee-keeping entrepreneurs. With activities rising and volume increasing, a couple of entrepreneurs have also set up a honey refining unit in Bharatpur.About 8,000 metric tonnes are processed annually in the unit and a large chunk of it is exported. People from neighbouring states like Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Bihar bring their raw honey to process here, added Gupta.Initially, farmers were apprehensive about bees damaging crops. But that notion changed completely when they realized that bees actually help the pollination of crops and increase the yield of oilseeds, pulses, fruits, etc by at least 15%. It is an important agriinput. Beekeeping deserves to be recognized as an organic technology in raising farm production, said Gupta said."

5aea9a429855b73f522c11dd,"Rain, Hailstorm Flatten Crop, Drench Harvest in Punjab, Haryana and UP",https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rain-hailstorm-flatten-crop-drench-harvest-in-punjab-haryana-and-up/story-hKuG0WwhQ7H5Bfe8aZZITJ.html,2018-04-10,"Rain accompanied by high wind and isolated hailstorm walloped the food bowl states of Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh on Monday, drenching harvested produce in grain markets and damaging ripe wheat and other winter crops in farms.The storm flattened wheat crop in several districts of Haryana and affected harvesting, according to farmers and administration officials. Also, it damaged this years wheat and mustard produce stacked in bags at wholesale markets.The rain damaged our crop lying in the open as there are not enough sheds to store the entire produce at the Karnal grain market, said Gurdeep Singh, a farmer. The farmers are worried that their wet wheat will not be procured until it dries in the next few days. The rain has delayed harvesting by nearly a week. We will have to pay more for harvesting the flattened crop, said Ajay Kumar, a farmer in Indri.Karnal, Kurukshetra, Kaithal, Yamunanagar, Hisar and Sirsa were the worst-hit, reports said. Weather officials said the highest rainfall of about 30mm was recorded at Nilokheri in Karnal.Raj Singh, who heads the states meteorological and agriculture department, said farmers have been warned about the storm approaching the region. We suggested that farmers harvest their crop and store it in a dry area as there was a good chance of rain from April 9 to April 11. We have sent SMS alerts. The forecast is for more rain in the next 48 hours. Western disturbances are present over areas bordering Pakistan, which have attracted clouds over northern India, said JP Gupta, director of the meteorological department in Lucknow.Punjab reported a similar scenario as rain and strong wind flattened crops in Kapurthala, Jalandhar, Shaheed Bhagat Singh Nagar, Patiala, and Mohali districts. The state agriculture department said theres no need to panic as the rain fell in isolated areas. The loss to crop will be less than 1%, state agriculture director Navdeep Bains said.Shamsher Singh, a farmer in Patiala, said most of his crop on two acres was down. Such weather will reduce the yield by two to three quintals per acre. The crop was ready for harvest and the loss will be huge, he lamented. Farmers and officials of procurement agencies reportedly covered harvested crops with tarpaulins in several places.The freak storm also damaged crops in eastern UP, while the administration asked sub-divisional magistrates to inspect rain-hit areas and assess the loss.In Bareilly and Moradabad regions, ripe wheat crop on an estimated 90 acres was flattened or submerged in water following spells of rain from Sunday evening till Monday afternoon. Hailstorm in some areas of Bareilly and Rampur affected crops.We were expecting a bumper mango crop because the trees flowered well. But the rain battered the buds  We will suffer a bigger loss if the rains continue, said Sukhwinder Singh, an orchard owner in Pilibhit."
5aea91069855b73f522c0b58,"In Sarfabad Village, Wrestling Is the Way to Settle Disputes",https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/in-sarfabad-village-wrestling-is-the-way-to-settle-disputes/story-cTnj0QSFUsDbMRqHF7KviM.html,2018-04-17,"In Sarfabad village of Noida, a dangal (wrestling bout) is the easiest way to settle disputes.It saves money of both parties  they dont have to pay off policemen to settle the case  and it also provides entertainment to the masses, chuckles a veteran pahalwan (wrestler) of Sarfabad.According to village elders here, if two people get into a dispute, they dont get into a brawl and nor are the police involved; rather the elderly of the hamlet sit together and announce a dangal between the two parties to resolve their issues.Located in the midst of planned sectors and high-rise societies, Sarfabad might appear as one of those vague, Delhi-NCR villages that pop up when you google crime stories every now and then.Scratch a bit deeper and one can find as many as 200-250 amateur and professional wrestlers in this Noida village. Whats more, wrestling enthusiasts from western UP and Haryana flock here every year in August when the dangal season begins.Uphaar Sharma(22) a national level wrestler from Dankaur Gautam Budh Nagar, is eyeing a post in Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB) or Railways under sports quota. (Sunil Ghosh/HT Photo)Wrestling is what defines Sarfabad, which has a history of 275 years of having one pahalwan in every household. Here, families boast of khurak (diet) of their in-house wrestlers and matchmaking is done according to the chest size of the men. Predominantly home to the Yadav community, Sarfabad is also infamous for being the native place of former Mafiosi-turned politician DP Yadav, who is currently serving a life sentence in Dehradun jail.Kushti (wrestling) is the glue that has kept the social fabric of this village intact for almost three centuries. The sport thrives here in every household as we train young boys to professional athletes, says Surendra Singh Yadav, a resident and wrestling coach of Sarfabad.However, with the fast-paced urbanisation of Noida, the village is like any other urban village of Delhi-NCR it has accepted the charms of consumerism as is evident from the swanky SUVs parked under cowsheds in pucca houses. As a result, veterans wrestlers fear that youngsters will now be lured away by corporate jobs and higher education opportunities, much to the detriment of the sport.Its a fact that the number of professional and amateur wrestlers has declined in Sarfabad. Hunt for employment has made many men leave the village while others just boast of wrestling as a hobby they inherited from their fathers. I always tell young people that studies are important but so are sports. Kushti gives you discipline, teaches you values and keeps you away from vices, says Sukhbir Singh, an army veteran and former wrestler who runs a akhara in the village.Coach Surendra Singh Yadav, an army veteran, trains young wrestlers in Sarfabad in a bid to sustain the wrestling culture of the village. (Sunil Ghosh/HT Photo)To provide a professional touch to the wrestling culture of Sarfabad, 49-year-old Singh alias Sukhbir Pahalwan has been training young boys for the past 15 years. Employed as a wrestler in the army, Singh took retirement at the age of 34, after a knee injury in 2003.Over 100 young men and boys train in his akhara every day and many have represented Uttar Pradesh in the national games. A few, such as 27-year-old Subodh Yadav, have represented India in the Asian Games.Every day, Singh reaches his akhara by 6am to guide the young wrestlers who train in the loose soil mixed with henna, mustard oil and turmeric to avoid bodily injuries.Checking the soil quality, Singh says, Hundred years ago, we had legendary wrestlers such as Malkhan Pahalwan and Balwant Pahalwan who had trained all their lives under extreme poverty with only mustard oil available to them. Today, our boys have all the facilities, including a proper diet, yet we find it difficult to make them pursue wrestling as a profession.However, lack of interest is not the only hurdle for the young wrestlers of Sarfabad. Diets are expensive and lack of employment opportunities keeps troubling them.A regular diet of any wrestler includes a huge quantity of almonds, 1.5 litre milk, fruits, juice and other protein nutrients. They have to shell out a minimum Rs 1,000 every day on food. Although we train here for free, the cost of the diet makes it even difficult for a few to take up professional wrestling. I know a few wrestlers who had to seek jobs as bouncers to continue their diet, says 22-year-old Gaurav Chaudhary, who had appeared in the national games last year.Wrestlers at Sukhbir Pahalwans akhara prefer army posts over government jobs. However, none of the 50 wrestlers who have been trained here have been employed by any state or central government agency.Since I have participated in national games thrice, I was eligible for a Grade 4 division job but I refused to apply since I am eyeing a post in Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB) or the Railways, says 22-year-old Uphaar Sharma, a Dankaur-based wrestler who trains in Sarfabad.Sukhbir Pahalwan believes that it is the duty of society to ensure that a wrestler doesnt have to lose his dignity to seek a livelihood once he his past his prime.The life of a wrestler is not easy when you have to train four to five hours every day amid dust and soil and take care of your body weight with a strict diet. We dont allow our boys to go to the movies or pubs as wrestling requires dedication and focus. A wrestler puts his entire youth at stake and trains hard to bring glory to his state and country. When his prime days are over, it becomes the responsibility of society to take care of him, Sukhbir argues.In such times, the dangal season in August and September is a windfall for wrestlers as organisers place bets on them according to the tournaments they have participated in.For example, a national level wrestler can easily fetch a bet of Rs 30,000 whereas an Asian Games wrestler gets a bet as high as Rs 50,000. Wrestlers from western UP and Haryana also attend the dangals, adding to the charm.Their coach Surendra Singh Yadav believes that excessive exposure to traditional wrestling such as might also act as a hindrance for wrestlers when they go for international tournaments.The typical stance wrestlers use in dangal is the Hanuman stance where one leg protrudes ahead of the other and the body is bent forward. However, according to international wrestling standards, keeping your legs together benefit the wrestler in maintaining balance. It becomes difficult for players to unlearn the tricks of dangal and adapt to international standards, Yadav says.However, for Sukhbir Pahalwan, it is not the professional glory but personal etiquette that matters most.Wrestling teaches perseverance, patience and tolerance. After a knock-out or an unintentional backbreaker move, a wrestler might feel humiliated and angry but he has to learn to control his anger and use it judiciously at the right time. Before learning wrestling, a player must learn humility and compassion. He has to put his ego aside and learn to bend as a token of respect for his elders and colleagues. Without humility, a wrestler is nothing but a street goon, Sukhbir says.As Sukhbir kept explaining the nitty-gritty of wrestling, Gaurav Chaudhary and Uphaar Sharma (both 90kg category wrestlers) are locked in a bout. Chaudhary pounces on Sharma from behind, bends his hand towards his back, puts his knee on his head and makes him taste the soil till he accepts defeat. A few minutes later, both the wrestlers are seen sharing a badam milk and friendly banter."

5ce5df16e8e3fc56af40fa0a,A tale of two States,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/a-tale-of-two-states/article25694572.ece,2018-12-08,"A few farmers sit huddled near a statue of Sardar Patel at Balaguda village in Mandsaur, Madhya Pradesh pouring out their woes over steaming cups of tea. The statue marks the entry point to the Patidar-dominated village.One of them, Manoj Patidar, who has just returned from the Mandsaur wholesale market, says that the goods and services tax (GST) and rising prices of diesel have made agriculture a loss-making activity. If the Shivraj Singh Chouhan government stays for another five years, we will have to sell our lands, says the tall farmer, his wry smile deepening the lines on his weather-worn face.In another place and State  in Rajasthan  separated by distance as well as priorities, Chhatar Singh Rathore of Tena village in Shergarh tehsil in Jodhpur district has a very different concern.He runs a roadside dhaba on National Highway 114, which connects Jodhpur to Jaisalmer. His main complaint concerns what he believes to be the wilful disregard of Rajput sentiment. Rajasthan Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje, who is seeking a second consecutive term in office, he says, has humiliated Rajputs by not backing their opposition to the film Padmaavat , and also marginalising Manvendra Singh, son of former Union Minister Jaswant Singh, who is a Rajput.With not much farming visible in the entire region, caste is the primary marker of social identity, unlike in Madhya Pradesh, where locals display a clear sense of identity as farmers. The contrast between Mandsaur and Shergarh points to the differences between two worlds. While both are rural, one is agrarian and the other is dominated by an array of non-farm activities.On November 30, all eyes were on New Delhi where there was a massive protest by farmers who had gathered from all over the country in the thousands. Opposition leaders such as Congress president Rahul Gandhi, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, and CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury spoke. This event came in the wake of another landmark protest held more than a year ago.In the middle of last year, farmers organisations had taken out a rally that touched Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Gujarat and Rajasthan, among other places. The participants also visited Mandsaur, where, a month earlier, five farmers had been killed in police firing. Weighed down by debts, the agitating farmers were demanding loan waivers.As politics heats up in the run-up to the 2019 Lok Sabha election, the Opposition sees farmer anger as having the potential to dent the prospects of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which has performed well in most State elections held since it came to power in 2014. The reading is not far off the mark. The BJP scraped through in its stronghold of Gujarat in the 2017 Assembly elections, as a result of urban votes. The Congress, on the other hand, did well in rural Gujarat.However, one was able to get an idea of the situation while travelling through Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan over the last month. In a complex picture, the rural cannot always be conflated with the agrarian.Long list of woesMadhya Pradesh today presents a picture of rural discontent that is cementing an amorphous farmers identity  a sort of occupational consciousness  that the ruling BJP will have to be wary of in the future. But the same does not hold true in Rajasthan, where the rural sector is involved in an array of occupations  from stone mining and animal husbandry to forays into the hospitality sector through highway and city restaurants. There is nothing like a farmers identity across the vast, parched, swathes of Indias largest State by land area.It takes half an hour to reach Pipliya Mandi, the epicentre of last years farm unrest, on the road from Mandsaur to Neemuch town in Madhya Pradesh. Mukesh Patidar, a soyabean farmer in his mid-30s, has come to the mandi (wholesale market) to buy agricultural implements. My village, Chilot Pipliya, which is about 17-18 kilometres from here, saw one farmer become a shaheed (martyr) last year, he says. He adds that soybean farmers are a distressed lot, with a long list of grievances.If the fertilizer DAP (Diammonium Phosphate) cost Rs. 800-900 per 50 kg in 2013-14, it is now priced at Rs. 1,440 for 45 kg, he says. Potash, which was priced at Rs. 450 per 50 kg one-two years ago, now costs Rs. 900 kg, he adds.We use tractors to prepare our fields for the crop. They run on diesel, which has gone up from Rs. 50 a litre to around Rs. 70 a litre, Patidar says. And labour charges have also gone up from Rs. 150-200 to Rs. 300 a day now. Why will they work for less? They are getting grain at Rs. 1-2 a kg.He predicts that the BJP will lose votes in villages around Pipliya Mandi this time. Dilip Patidar, a farm activist who also runs a shop selling various agricultural goods, says the GST has made things difficult for farmers. He says, The GST on pesticide is 28% now. These were taxed at 0-4% earlier. Look at the motor that pumps water to fields. It was taxed at 6% earlier but attracts 12% GST now. The pipe to connect the motor to the fields attracted no tax earlier but attracts 12-18% GST now.All this has made farm inputs dearer. Of the entire area under soyabean cultivation in India, about half is in Madhya Pradesh, the soyabean State of India. The Malwa region, of which Mandsaur is a part, accounts for more than half of M.P.s cultivation of the kharif crop. Fields are prepared by tractor in the summer months. Renting is the norm for small and medium farmers and tractors are rented out for Rs. 700 per hour, up from Rs. 500 because of diesel price hikes. The cost of soyabean seeds, Dilip Patidar says, is Rs. 5,400 per quintal. Labour charges for sowing as well as harvesting have gone up, he adds.Electricity bills too have shot up. While it is possible to run a diesel engine instead of an electric motor to pump water into the fields, with diesel prices going up, it is becoming an expensive proposition now as with diesel becoming more expensive, with costs are Rs. 200 per hour.The soyabean produce is transported to the mandis (wholesale markets) in Pipliya Mandi, Mandsaur and Neemuch. Here again, transportation is more expensive because of the rise in diesel prices. The present minimum support price (MSP) for soyabean is Rs. 3,399 per quintal, but it sells in mandis at Rs. 2,800-3,100 per quintal.In 2013-14, the mandi prices had gone up to Rs. 4,500-5,000 per quintal, says Mukesh Patidar. He blames faulty export-import policies for the fall in prices.Mandi prices keep fluctuating on a demand-and-supply basis, and vary each day. Says a wholesale trader at the Mandsaur Mandi who refuses to be identified, These are like the stock market. It is partly the luck of the farmer and partly his ability to read trends that determine the price he gets for his produce.Look at onions. When prices begin to rise, they import these and the prices fall again, says Dilip Patidar.Indeed, the interests of farmers and consumers are at odds. When the prices of farm produce rise, the commissions of wholesale traders and other intermediaries in the supply chain push up the retail prices of farm produce. When prices fall, food price inflation ceases to be a problem but farmers face losses, rendering agriculture unprofitable as an occupation.For example, at the Ajmer vegetable wholesale market, tomatoes were selling at Rs. 8 a kg. On the previous two days, 1 kg was was selling at Rs. 10 and Rs. 12, respectively. Just 2 km away at the retail market, it was selling at Rs. 20.The dip in farm fortunes is visibly impacting the politics of Madhya Pradesh, a traditional BJP stronghold, with the Congress clawing back in the villages. The troubles of increased documentation, paperwork and bank payments,  seen by many as a part of the formalisation of the sector and cleaning up of the system  have also annoyed farmers.The M.P. government has put in place a subsidy scheme called Bhavantar Bhugtan Yojana (BBY), under which the government promises to plug the gap between market prices and the minimum support price (MSP). But to avail it, a farmer has to register himself at an authorised office and produce the required documents at the grain and vegetable market when he goes to sell his produce.Says Sunil Solanki, a farmer: Our soyabean crop gets a subsidy of Rs. 500 a quintal. But for this we have to submit a copy of our documents to the mandi merchant, who submits our farmer code numbers to the official market committee and then credits the money to our accounts, a process which takes between 10 and 15 days. The government subsidy under the BBY, he adds, takes two to three months to get credited to a farmers bank account. Unlike farmers elsewhere, farmers in M.P. are not paid in cash as everything is digitised.In other words, say several farmers, they pay in cash for labour, for renting tractors, and to transport the produce, but get paid by bank transfer. The time lag results in a cash crunch. They complain of long queues at markets and banks. Sensing this as an opportunity, Congress leaders have begun to promise cash payments to farmers if voted to power, according to local residents.Economist Utsa Patnaik says that the coming together of farmers across classes  the poor and the rich  was long overdue. She says: There has been a concerted attack on agriculture over the last few decades under the influence of neoliberal policies. There has been a mistaken belief that we should displace farmers and promote industrialisation, and the displaced will be absorbed by industry. The experience of Europe was different. Rather than being absorbed in industry there, the displaced were exported to North America, Australia and South Africa, and they captured the resources there after subduing indigenous people. We dont have that option.She adds: The open trade policies have exposed farmers to the highs and lows of global prices, which they cannot withstand. The meaning of priority sector has also changed under the influence of neoliberal policies, and farmers are unable to access low-interest loans. They have to borrow from private lenders at high interest rates and end up in a debt trap. It is only now that people have begun to notice the farm unrest that was waiting to burst forth.Other sources of incomeFew farmers can be seen at the Ajmer wholesale vegetable market after 11 a.m. They come here at 3 a.m. and leave after selling their produce  in return for cash payments  by 9-10 a.m. The mandi lacks the scale of operations or the frenzied activity of, say, the Surat wholesale market or even Azadpur Mandi in Delhi.The reason is not hard to find. This correspondents journey through Rajasthan, across 2,100 km, covering Jaipur, Tonk, Ajmer, Sawai Madhopur, Nagaur, Pali and Jodhpur districts, showed farm activity present only in the villages close to Tonk.Rasoolpuri village, which has high Gujjar and Meena populations, has farmland where mustard is grown. Here, farmers complain about rising diesel and fertilizer prices and the limited supply of water, which is available only from 10 p.m. to 4 a.m. The produce, they say, sells at Rs. 3,200 a quintal, much below the MSP of Rs. 4,200.Farmers at a tea stall just outside the village say they will vote for the Congress as they are fed up of having their concerns brushed aside.But most of rural Rajasthan is a very different world. Villages, even around Jaipur, for miles on end have hardly any farm activity. The better off among villagers have diversified into non-farm activities such as dairy and poultry, while the poor are into animal grazing or work as labourers in construction activities and other sectors.A 40-minute drive on the Jodhpur-Jaisalmer highway leads to the Balesar-Shergarh belt, an arid, sparsely populated area dotted with Rajput-dominated villages. A detour from the highway down a narrow, broken road reveals what substitutes for farming in this region: stone-mining for the construction sector is in full swing on both sides of the road.Meghlasia is a village with Meghwal (Scheduled Caste) and Rajpurohit families. The latter, who describe themselves as gurus of Rajputs, are Brahmins by caste.Stone-mining is a key source of income for the villagers. In addition, they also sow bajra (millet) after the first rains in June-July, but the yield is subject to the vagaries of the monsoon rains.Caste is the markerLike many other Rajputs who have opened restaurants or dhabas because there is not enough water for farming, Chhatar Singh Rathore of the Rajput-dominated Tena village too runs one on the road towards Jodhpur.Says Rathore, Many people in my village run restaurants on the highway. The richer Rajputs also own restaurants in Jodhpur. There are 10 restaurants in the city run by people from my village.He tries to summarise his villages sources of income: Our previous generation saw many people join the Indian Army. You will find many ex-servicemen here. This generation has taken to the restaurant-catering sector in a major way. That apart, many from the village have migrated to Surat to join the cloth industry where they specialise in designing and packing. Some even race horses in Dubai.The Rajput community in the State has gravitated towards the hospitality sector, with heritage hotels and havelis dotting the State. Many are owned by richer Rajput families. They have a traditional feel and visible Rajput markers such as photographs of men in traditional attire holding a sword or rifle. A lot of them try to attract foreign tourists.This non-farm rural world is in sharp contrast to that of M.P., where an occupational identity centred on farming is being forged. In Shergarh tehsil of Jodhpur, caste remains the prominent identity marker, with cultural issues occupying centrestage.Rathore is unhappy with the Rajasthan government for not standing behind Rajputs on the film Padmaavat . He complains that Vasundhara Raje got the entrance to the Raj Mahal Palace in Jaipur sealed to target former royal Diya Kumari, and also humiliated the family of BJP veteran Jaswant Singh.In Tibna village, about 90 km from Jodhpur, water supply poses an acute problem. Sarpanch Bhawani Singh Rathore points to a dry hand pump which is wrapped in a sack cloth. The village has houses placed wide apart, and is populated longitudinally, one house after another for a few kilometres. It has just 300 families, says the sarpanch, of which 150 are Rajput. Other than water, villagers also complain about the lack of school teachers in the local government school. However, despite their various frustrations, they do not think of themselves as aggrieved farmers. Caste remains the key marker of identity and status.You find three types of scenarios, says political analyst and author Sajjan Kumar. The first is Madhya Pradesh, where agriculture is linked to the market, with cash crops such as soyabean and cotton. Here, farming is under stress because of a fall in market prices and the impact of demonetisation. The second is seen in agrarian States such as Bihar and Uttar Pradesh (excluding western U.P.). Their agriculture is not linked to the market, with mainly food crops such as rice and wheat being produced. An arid State such as Rajasthan presents a third scenario, where agriculture is not central to rural life.He explains the significance of these diverse realities: An occupational identity, where people identify as farmers, is emerging in States of the first kind, such as M.P., Maharashtra and Gujarat. In States such as U.P. and Bihar, while agriculture is central to rural life, caste and religion remain dominant identity markers in the absence of strong market linkages of agriculture. In Rajasthan, in the near absence of agriculture as a key rural vocation, identity markers are still tied to caste.Rathores sentiments lend credence to this hypothesis. I have no problem with [Prime Minister] Narendra Modi. He says we should sell pakodas if we can and I have been doing so at my restaurant, he says. My problem is with Vasundhara Raje. Rajputs will try to ensure a victory for Manvendra Singh at Jhalrapatan. What is a Rajput without self-respect?There has been a concerted attack on agriculture over the last few decades under the influence of neoliberal policies. There has been a mistaken belief that we should displace farmers and promote industrialisation.Utsa Patnaik,Economist"
