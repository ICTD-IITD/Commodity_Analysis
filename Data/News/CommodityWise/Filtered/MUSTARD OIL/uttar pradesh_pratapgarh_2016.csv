The agriculture officers claimed that wheat crop in Allahabad and Pratapgarh has started showing signs of damage and production could be severely hit.The agriculture land in Allahabad is around 2.5 lakh hectare, of which wheat is grown on 2.3 lakh hectare while in remaining area pulses and mustard are grown. As per experts, the day temperature is hovering around 25 to 26 degree Celsius, which should be around 12 to 15 degrees in early January. The situation is equally worse in areas where irrigation facilities like canals are available and areas which depend on rain. Farmers have to draw water from nearby water sources. In Allahabad, worst affected areas are Koraon, Karchana, Manda, Khiri, Bara in trans-Yamuna. The farmers of trans-Ganga areas of Mauaima, Baharia, Soraon, Holagarh are equally affected. The wheat crop in the neighbouring Pratapgarh district is equally affected.The farmers are pinning hope on rabi crop after kharif crop failed due to hailstorm in 2015, followed by drought.Farmer Prakash Singh said that leaves of wheat crop are turning pale due to lack of rain and foggy weather. The farmers have lost hope and those who have take loans for procuring seeds and fertiliser have started migrating to the city to work as labourers.Munna Singh of village Sewan in Nawabganj said that famers will be severely affected if crops fail to get the optimum weather condition. District agriculture officer J P Dube said, ""The threat of another drought looms large if the prevailing weather condition does not improve in next two weeks. The crop is affected due to high day temperature.""Till date, the damage is not being assessed as the administration wants to wait for another few days. ""The crop wants bitter cold conditions and moisture which this winter lacks,"" added Dube. Meanwhile on Saturday, the difference between day and night temperature was over 12 degrees Celsius. Maximum temperature was recorded at 24.9 while the minimum stood at 12.7 degrees. The humidity was high at 92%.On Friday, the maximum temperature was 25 degrees and minimum was 8 degrees."

If the warm winter conditions continue, a range of rabi (winter) crops as well as fruits such as apples could be impacted, say experts.The past two kharif (summer) seasons were hit by deficit monsoon rains while heavy unseasonal rains and hailstorms affected the intervening rabi crop over large regions of Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan.Experts said high winter temperatures could impact tillering (side growth) of wheat and could lower yields if the temperatures continue to remain above normal. High temperatures in March could affect grain formation in wheat, which would then be in the milking stage. Wheat has been grown this year in over 35 lakh hectares in Punjab and about 24 lakh hectares in Haryana. The two states are the biggest contributors of the grain to the national stock.High temperatures and missing snowfall is also posing a threat to Himachal Pradesh's Rs 3,500-crore apple sector. Experts said rain and snow at this time of the year is crucial as it provides the chilling hours required for good production of apples in the coming season.In Uttar Pradesh, the weather is causing concern not only for wheat but also the gram crop. ""If the weather remains warm and dry in the second half of January, it will hit flowering and ripening of wheat and gram"" said Sudhir Panwar, president Kisan Jagriti Manch and member of UP State Planning Commission.The lack of winter rain has also worsened the groundwater situation in UP, where 52 districts or two-thirds of the state's area, faced a drought last year. Irrigation has also suffered because of the decline in water table.In Rajasthan, farmers have been hoping in vain for minimum temperatures to drop below 5 degrees C and ground frost to form, as these conditions are good for wheat, barley, peas, grams and mustard.""With a clear skies and high temperatures, moisture levels have decreased. There's now a chance of these crops getting damaged. For mustard in particular, you need shivering cold conditions,"" said Amrik Singh, a farmer in Sriganganagar, the main farming district of Rajasthan."
58f184fca3d24b245e59b03d,"Sea of poppies, hotbed of violence",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/Sea-of-poppies-hotbed-of-violence/articleshow/50661208.cms,2016-01-21,"MALDA: A fortnight after the Kaliachak violence where the police station was vandalised and torched on January 3, cops are convinced the planned attack was instigated by smugglers and illegal traders who thrive in the lawlessness at Kaliachak.While smuggling of fake currency and arms has been a big racket for years, the explosion in poppy cultivation has added to the illegal activities that abound in this place bordering Bangladesh.Grown by local farmers under the watchful eyes of the 'mafia', the poppy fields produce tonnes of opium.For Class VI student Ibrahim of Sahbajpur, carrying a container of concentrated opium resin known as atha (glue) in local parlance across the border fetches Rs 100, a princely sum for people residing in these border lands. Children like Ibrahim and women are used as carriers to smuggle opium across the border. Crossing over to Bangladesh in the morning and returning before sunset is a common practice.Finer products like heroin are carried back from there through Lalgola and Domkal. Around 750-800 gm of resin is required to produce 100 gm of heroin. The riches from the opium trade has reduced poverty.Ismail Sheikh of Golapgunj, a daily labourer till recently, has come into wealth and built a pucca house and bought a motorcycle. How? He took 1 bigha land on contract for a year and sowed poppy. ""Last October, we all took seeds of mustard or wheat but Ismail went for poppy. And we heard that he garnered over Rs 50,000 from the plot,"" said his neighbour Alim.Ismail's isn't the only rags to riches story. Thousands of farmers in Malda, Nadia and Murshidabad have found the short cut to success within three-four months, dumping the uncertainty over ravi crop to welcome offers from some 'foreigners'.Sabiruddin of Rejinagar recounted how the 'foreigner', Lakshman Yadav, met him and offered money to take contract of the land to farm. Yadav, a resident of UP, came here from Lalgola.Sabiruddin took the 1 bigha land from the owner who lives in Kolkata, for Rs 12,000. Yadav gave him this money as well as the seeds. The contract was that Yadav would take away entire resin collected from the poppies leaving the kernel for the farmer. Sabir learnt that the resin costs Rs 25,000 a kg. ""I heard that the gum is used to make intoxicant,"" he remarked.Thousands have similarly fallen to temptation of easy money that has led to the conversion of land along the belt into 'mini Afganistan'.Those who cannot afford to till large land opt for smaller ones even in the backyard. ""With China Silk invading the market, the cultivation of traditional mulberry has become non-viable. Even farming of vegetables with huge expense and little profit is avoided by the farmers,"" observed Binoy Mandal of Ramnagar. Instead, a cottah of poppy cultivation costs Rs 5000-7000, which yields 1 kg of resin that fetches Rs 60,000-70,000."" ""Moreover, the farming is not strenuous.Malda had a shortage of wheat production this year. Against 43,290 hectare of land in which wheat was cultivated last year, 41,145 hectare was used this year.Opium cultivation has a long history in this region. Immediately after the war of Plassey in 1757, East India Company discovered the treasure of opium in adjoining areas. Mainly controlled by the Portugese, the British soon took control of the trading to export opium to Asian and European countries. Apart from being used by the pharmaceutical companies, the opium journeys across the parched plains on a trail beaten by the British, who learnt to enslave China with Indian opium.However, the Indian government after Independence has never given licence to farmers to grow poppy apart from parts in Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan or Madhya Pradesh. But the tradition remained in Bengal. Oblivious of the danger and huge 'potential' lying within, Some farmers used to spray poppy seed in their lands. It is to get poppy seeds (posto) which is a popular cooking ingredient.FACTFILE:Villages thriving on poppy cultivation: Rajarampur, Nasipur, Kedarchandpur,Sarbangapur, Kasipur, Dubsor, Dakatepota, Chandghar in Murshidabad;Kaligunj, Tehatta, Karimnagar in Nadia; Harishchandrapur, Manikchak, Golapgunj, Ramnagar, Shersahi, Sahabazpur in Malda.Land under poppy cultivation: 5 lakh hectarePoppy cultivation unearthed: 15,000 bigha"
5940a0bf7be9e024e4599a08,Sunday story: The Cattlelines,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/sunday-story-the-cattlelines/,2016-01-24,"A cattle market at Omarpur, a little over 8 km from the border with Bangladesh. The haat, one of the larger cattle markets of Murshidabad district, comes alive every Sunday A cattle market at Omarpur, a little over 8 km from the border with Bangladesh. The haat, one of the larger cattle markets of Murshidabad district, comes alive every SundayBorders mean little here  the Padma doesnt think its worth even a pause. So the river flows on, even at Lalgola in West Bengals Murshidabad district, where it is part of the border between India and Bangladesh. The river refuses to pay heed to any man-made creations  border fences or security outposts  dismissing all such attempts with a casual change of direction every year during the monsoon. Over the last year, however, the Padma would have noticed a shift: the cattle smuggling trade between the two countries, much of it over the river and its tributaries, is now down to a trickle.Officers of the Border Security Force (BSF), whose jawans patrol the 915 km stretch of the border that West Bengal shares with Bangladesh, estimate that cattle smuggling has come down by more than 70 per cent since the BJP-led government at the Centre made the issue one of its top priorities. In April last year, Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh instructed BSF personnel deployed along the border to check cattle smuggling.Four months later, the minister touted the drop in figures for cattle smuggling as one of the governments major successes: from about 20-22 lakh cattle that would be smuggled across the border every year, he said, the numbers had come down to 2-2.5 lakh cattle in 2015.Since the NDA government came to power, the BSF has given its men discretionary powers to shoot at cattle smugglers, a strategy that has reportedly contributed to the drop in smuggling. In December 2015, in a written reply to a question in the Rajya Sabha, Minister of State for Home Kiren Rijiju had said, During the current calendar year, 21 cross-border criminals were killed by the BSF along the Bangladesh border, of whom 16 were allegedly cattle smugglers.We are taking different measures to ensure that cattle smuggling is stopped. Over the last year, we brought it to a halt and now weve asked the Centre to provide us with land to construct fences to stop all infiltration, says BSF DIG R PS Jaswal.BSF officers claim their efforts have had a direct result on sale of beef in Bangladesh. Figures available with the cattle haat (market) in Bangladesh show that around 22 lakh cattleheads were sold in 2013, 18 lakh in 2014, but only 4.5 lakh in 2015.But what Delhi sees as smuggling, Dhaka sees as legitimate cross-border trade. So during the November 16-17 Home Secretary-level talks between the two countries, Bangladesh raised the issue of rising prices of beef in that country as a result of the BSF crackdown. Dhaka reportedly also requested Delhi to go easy on cattle smugglers.The BSF has identified 64 Border Outposts (BOPs) along the Bengal-Bangladesh border that are vulnerable to cattle smuggling. Of these, they say, 46 account for 80 per cent of the cattle smuggling cases. Eight of these are in Murshidabad, where the river makes the border particularly hard to sanitise.The BSFs outposts are mostly bamboo sheds where jawans spend the nights. In the mornings, these outposts see a steady stream of people who take their cattle to the other side to graze. The jawans greet the cattle herders, reminding them to be back before sundown.Besides the outposts, new fences have been set up and BSF jawans patrol the river, their twin-engine speed boats rushing past the smaller country boats.But everyday life has a way of looking beyond the jawans, their guns and their speedboats. Umaruddin Ahmed, a farmer in Aurangabad village, says he routinely crosses over with his herd of cattle. Why should the border matter? My sister lives in Bangladesh. My ties with her are more important than anything else. We have documents issued by the state government that prove we live in India. The BSF examines our papers and allows us to walk across, says Ahmed, who has just returned from another visit to his sister. While the younger of his three sons takes care of his 200 sq ft field, he takes care of his cattle, taking them for walks across the border. My cattle like grazing on the other side. Here there are too many cows and not enough space. And of course, I get to chat with my sister, he says.This easy relationship that the villagers share with the border coupled with the Centres push to stop cattle smuggling leave the BSF with an unenviable job. Not only do they have to ensure that every Indian citizen who crosses the boundary is properly identified and returns before sunset, they also have to photograph, tag and count every animal that crosses the border.If someone returns with one animal less, we immediately file a case against him and hand him over to the police. There is no separate section in the Indian Penal Code for cattle smuggling, so we register cases under sections pertaining to cheating, says a senior officer of the BSFs Lalgola unit who spoke on condition of anonymity.The daily ritual of counting cows at checkposts, once in the morning and then again in the evening, is one of the many ways the BSF hopes to counter a trade that has thrived in the area for as long as anyone can remember.Apart from constructing border roads, putting up flood lights and increasing outposts along the border, the BSF has also increased the frequency of its surveillance. On Thursday, the Union Home Minister said a plan had been finalised to complete the fencing of the border.The BSF is now digging trenches and laying iron pipes in them along the barbed wire fences at the border. The trenches and the pipes will make it difficult for the cattle to jump across. This method has been very successful, says IG Sandeep Sulanke, who is in charge of the BSFs South Bengal Frontier.On more than one occasion, however, BSF jawans and officers have found themselves outnumbered and outflanked by the cattle smugglers. In December, we ambushed a big group of smugglers and their cattle. When we fired in the air, the cows, around 200 of them, started running helter-skelter and the smugglers gave us the slip. We were left holding the tails of a few cows. We only managed to round up about 50 cows, says a BSF officer posted at Cooch Behar, the district neighbouring Murshidabad, where the BSF claims cattle smuggling has come down  from a lakh a day to 500  since the land boundary agreement on enclaves made it easier to identify the border.Despite their efforts, many in the BSF feel that given the socio-economic realities of southern Bengal, the demand for beef and the nearly limitless supply of ageing bovines in India, smugglers will soon find a way to hoodwink them.We are doing our best and the situation (of cattle smuggling) is far better now than before, but frankly, we can stop, say, 10 cows. How can we stop a hundred? Theres a constant supply of cows from India and high demand in Bangladesh. With the kind of poverty in these parts and the money thats to be got from smuggling, to many of them, the risk of getting arrested or even dying during a smuggling operation seems worth taking, says a BSF officer who is posted at the BSFs Murshidabad circle headquarters in Behrampore town.In June 2015, the BSF had in its official magazine suggested that the only way to curb cattle smuggling was to legalise the export of over-aged and non-milching animals and promote beef industry in India by allowing the slaughter of unwanted cattle.Its a little before noon and a cattle haat is on at Omarpur, a little over 8 km from Lalgola at the border. The haat, one of the larger cattle haats of Murshidabad district, comes alive every Sunday. Several thousand cows are brought here for sale from across India  particularly Haryana, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Jharkhand. Most of the cows are old and sick, their ribs sticking out, their eyes glazed.Almost all these cows will be smuggled across the border for slaughter, some will make it to the few legal slaughterhouses in the state, says a trader.I have just sold two of my cows for Rs 13,000. They were healthy and fetched a good price. I am going to buy some chicken and vegetables and well have a feast at home today. Its a Sunday after all, says Ibrahim Kazi from Behrampore town, briskly counting the notes.For decades, the smuggling and sale of cattle across the border have provided sustenance to families in Murshidabad, both Hindus and Muslims. The trade has thrived, often as a family profession, with secrets passed down generations: how to evade the BSF, the best routes to transport cattle, how to ensure stealth while crossing the border.The economics of cattle smuggling is what makes the BSFs job tough. For most Indian farmers, a cow past its prime is of little value. Besides, tractors have long replaced bulls and oxen and they are of little use too. So the cattle are sold to traders who supply them to slaughterhouses in India, both legal and illegal. But with beef selling for around Rs 350-Rs 450 a kg in Bangladesh, in comparison to Rs 150 a kg in Bengal, smuggling is far more lucrative.Villages such as Shamsherganj and Lal Kola are seen as the hub of the cattle trade. By day, however, these are just an idyllic expanse of green. Their fields, thick with silt from the Padma, are among the most fertile in the country. But fragmented landholdings have forced villagers to look for livelihood options elsewhere  and its cattle smuggling that most turn to.We grow vegetables and our produce is possibly the best in the state. But we dont earn any profit. The money we earn, which allows us to educate our children, comes from taking cattle to Bangladesh, says Barun Mondal, a farmer at Shamsherganj.However, he claims to have stopped himself. I used to transport cattle from the haats to the collection point. It wasnt thought of as illegal until recently.Ahmed Raza, the headman at Chotokalia hamlet in Shamsherganj, says, Most families here survive because of cattle smuggling. Women roll beedis at home and men tend to their farms. But without the cattle trade, our income will go down by half. There are already families here who can no longer afford to send their children to school. Education is free, but theyd rather have more hands to work on the fields if thats the only source of income, he says.Ranjit, a villager from Omarpur in Murshidabad, who now works for an insurance company, says he smuggled cattle for most of his adult life. You cant do this on your own. You need to be part of a network, says the 42-year-old, adding smugglers usually organise themselves along religious or caste lines. For instance, the Muslim families of Omarpur look out for each other. Similarly, smugglers of the Ghosh community share information with each other, he says.Though he now sells insurance to people in his village, I was very good at smuggling, he says proudly. That makes him qualified to explain the trade and its ways.To begin with, he says, villagers bring their cows to the haats, from where transporters take them to collection points. The transporters avoid the main roads and usually move with not more than two cows at a time. Depending on the distance they cover, they get paid Rs 200-Rs 500 to take the cattle to the collection point, he says.This collection point is usually the home of a villager who is trusted by those in charge of the operation. Here the cows are kept for a few days until there are at least a hundred cows in one village. The smuggler pays for the upkeep of the cows and also pays a few thousands to the person whose house is the collection point, says Ranjit.The third and final part of the operation is the actual crossing of the border. This is done by cattle herders, usually young boys called rakhaals. The cows are fed a mixture of mustard oil and salt, which, smugglers believe, makes them less likely to moo while crossing. At places where the river separates the two countries, the cows are led into the water and forced to cross the river. The rakhaals hold on to the cows tail as they swim across the river to the other side. Smugglers prefer taking at least a hundred cows together because even if the BSF were to interrupt the smuggling operation, there is no way two patrolling officers can stop a hundred charging cows or bulls, he says.The rakhaals choose their time and moment to cross over  they usually do so when theres heavy fog or when its raining. That makes it very difficult for us to see the cows as they move across the border, says a BSF jawan posted at the Murshidabad circle headquarters.The BSF has been filing FIRs against the cattle smugglers they arrest before handing them over to the police. But the police, they say, need to do more. The BSF is limited to the border, but the police can make arrests in the haats. But that doesnt happen, making our job almost impossible, says the officer.So for now, the BSF relies on its meticulous headcount. There is a joke in the BSF now about how we are actually the CSF or the Cattle Security Force. We are following our orders and we are stopping the smuggling of cattle. But as far as national security is concerned, many of us feel that our efforts will be better directed at stopping the flow of fake currency and contraband and not counting cows, says a senior BSF officer.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

The current spell of rain and hailstorms in parts of Rajasthan has also threatened the mustard crop.R.K. Gupta, Director at the Indian Institute of Wheat and Barley Research (IIWBR), told The Hindu that it was too early to assess the damage. However, on a conservative side, the wheat crop might have been damaged in five per cent of the total sown area in these northern States. Wheat has been sown on around 29 million hectares this season across the country and out of this, around half the wheat is sown in the northern and western States.Meanwhile, an Agriculture Ministry official said: We are monitoring the situation and our teams have already left to asses the crop loss. It would be only after the reports are submitted by these teams that an actual assessment of damage could be figured out.Agriculture experts say the current spell of rains is detrimental for the early sown varieties. However, the late-sown crops could survive provided there is no wind or hailstorm in the coming days.Untimely rain, hail and strong winds have flattened standing wheat crop.

A good yield was expected this year but heavy rains induced by westerly disturbances flattened the wheat crop less than a month before harvest in Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh.The damage can be up to 50% in several districts of Haryana, Punjab, northern Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh, an agriculture ministry official said, adding that state governments had been asked to submit reports.Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal ordered divisional commissioner A Anbarasu to assess the damage to crops in the Capital. Have asked Div Commissioner to assess damage to crops of farmers in Delhi due to unseasonal rains (sic), Kejriwal tweeted.The governments of Madhya Pradesh, Haryana and Rajasthan also instructed officials to assess the loss.In 2015, the Centre gave states about Rs 8,000 crore for crop losses due to unseasonal rains.In Madhya Pradesh, protesting farmers took a tractor trolley full of hailstones to the office of the SDM, Banda in Sagar district and a chakka jam protest was held on NH-86 near Banda on the Sagar-Chatarpur road to draw the administrations attention towards damage to crops.In Rohtak, Ram Chander, a Dalit farmer who had taken two acres of land on contract for Rs 25,000, said rain and thunderstorm had almost completely destroyed his wheat crop. There is not much left, he said, crying for government help.Farmer Kundan Lal Jatav of Ghatla village in Rajasthans Alwar district said with tears in his eyes that rain and hail ruined his entire mustard crop on seven bighas of land.The government needs about 62 million tonnes of grains, including wheat and rice, to ensure steady supply of food items under the national food security law. Good crops in 2014 had ensured adequate stocks but crop damage in two consecutive years can exert a burden on the buffer maintained by the Food Corporation of India.Experts say the government might not have enough buffer stocks to sell in the market to keep wheat prices under check.Apart from wheat, officials admit, there has been extensive damage to mustard, potato and peas in these states. The showers have withered the flowering of mangoes in Uttar Pradesh and apple, pears and apricots in Himachal Pradesh.Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi raised the issue in the Lok Sabha and asked the government to assess the crop damage and provide adequate compensation to the affected farmers.After the hailstorm and heavy rains, farmers of northern India are in distress.

As many as 264 villages have been severely affected in Madhya Pradesh alone.The minister said that government has decided to extend relief to Union Territories as well under NDRF, which was not the case earlier.

The current spell of rains will, however, be beneficial for late-sown crops, if there is no wind or hailstorm in the coming weeks.The minister's assurance came hours after Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi raised the issue in the lower House and demanded immediate action to extend relief to the affected farmers. Demanding a statement from the agriculture minister on the issue, Gandhi said the Centre should hasten provision of relief to the affected farmers and, unlike the last time, the assistance should reach them as early as possible.Though arriving at any actual figure on the extent of crop loss is difficult at this juncture, agriculture ministry officials, on the basis of the preliminary findings, believe that the impact of rains and hailstorm is less than last year when as many as 15 states were affected due to rains for a longer period during the middle of the harvest season."

The current spell of rain and hailstorms in parts of Rajasthan has also threatened the mustard crop.R.K. Gupta, Director at the Indian Institute of Wheat and Barley Research (IIWBR), told The Hindu that it was too early to assess the damage. However, on a conservative side, the wheat crop might have been damaged in five per cent of the total sown area in these northern States. Wheat has been sown on around 29 million hectares this season across the country and out of this, around half the wheat is sown in the northern and western States.Meanwhile, an Agriculture Ministry official said: We are monitoring the situation and our teams have already left to asses the crop loss. It would be only after the reports are submitted by these teams that an actual assessment of damage could be figured out.Untimely rain, hail and strong winds have flattened standing wheat crop.

This, as per the state's calculation, works out to be 38,000 metric tonne mustard or sesame oil. Akhilesh has said this will be great help to population residing in 50 drought-hit districts of the state. The letter said, keeping in mind UP's financial condition, it will not be possible for the state to bear the cost, but the government will take care of distribution, transportation, and expenses on margin money. With regards to this, a letter written by the state government to secretary, consumer affairs, food and public distribution, Government of India, on January 3, 2016 has also been attached.UP CM has also written that people in drought-hit districts and farmers were facing the most difficult times as a result of a second season of drought and natural calamities. The state government, Akhilesh has underlined, was sensitive to the situation and made efforts to mitigate problems faced by farmers.Of the 75 districts in the state, 50 including Bundelkhand, were facing drought. The 28 lakh Anyodaya families in these regions are eligible, under the provisions of the National Food Security Act 2013, to receive 35 kg food grain per month for which 32,000 metric tonnes of wheat and 68,000 metric rice.After subtracting the Antyodaya units from the total population, 11 crore population is left out. Owing to the acute drought conditions, the state government is of the view that without a bias of APL and BPL, under the NFSA 2013, 3 kg wheat and 2 kg rice, per person per month for the next six months so that the drought-hit districts can battle the problem out. In his letter, the CM also said UP government, to meet the protein needs of the drought-hit people in 50 districts, will provide 2 kilos of arhar daal, and one litre edible oil, per family, to all Antyodaya families and eligible households.The CM has also said UP will need 37,000 metric tonnes of wheat, 29,000 metric tonnes of rice, 38,000 metric tonnes of arhar, and 1.89 crore litres of mustadr or sesame oil per month.

A resident of Jattari in Aligarh, Prasad found that his mustard crop, spread over six bighas, was completely destroyed due to heavy rain and hailstones over the weekend. According to his son Rajveer, Prasad died on Monday evening after complaining of chest pain.He suffered a huge blow after seeing that the mustard crop had been almost completely destroyed, Rajveer told The Hindu. Prasad was not the only casualty of the untimely rain and hailstones. Two more farmers reportedly died in Agra due to the distress caused by destruction of crops. About 30-40 per cent of the crops have been destroyed by the sudden change in weatherOfficials told The Hindu that farmers were badly affected by the large-scale damage to crops. In Aligarh district, wheat, potato and other rabi crops were badly affected. There is no district in western Uttar Pradesh which has not seen crop damage.Though the agriculture department has begun surveying the losses incurred, unofficial estimates put the figure at 25-30 per cent.From the information we collected from the ground, production of wheat in Meerut division may go down by 15 per cent. Similarly, the percentage of crop damage in Saharanpur, Moradabad, Bareilly, Agra and Aligarh division is about 20-25 per cent. The crop damage may go up further if it rains in the next few days, said Ghulam Mohammad Jaula, president of the Bharatiya Kisan Mazdoor Manch.Mr. Jaula said the problem was multi-fold for farmers. First of all, a large number of farmers have not enrolled for the crop insurance scheme. The other problem is that a farmer will get insurance benefit only if the crop damage is at least 33 per cent, which complicates the situation especially for small farmers who are solely dependent on agriculture for survival, added Mr. Jaula."

58f110f3a3d24b245e595638,UP's B'hand packagedefies SDRF norms,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/UPs-Bhand-packagedefies-SDRF-norms/articleshow/51591832.cms,2016-03-29,"Lucknow: Uttar Pradesh government's largesse to the seven drought-hit districts of Bundelkhand contravenes the Centre's guidelines for use of emergency funds from the State Disaster Relief Fund (SDRF). UP government has announced that it will give 25kg potatoes, 10kg wheat flour, 5kg chana dal, 5 litres of edible oil, 1 litre desi ghee and 1kg milk powder to 2.34 lakh Antyodaya families in Bundelkhand. This will be in addition to the 35kg foodgrain the families receive under the National Food Security Act, 2013.According to SDRF guidelines cleared by the Centre on April 8, 2015, however, families grievously affected by natural calamities can be offered government assistance on following conditions: First at the rate of Rs 60 per adult, and Rs 45 per minor, for those families not staying in relief camps. Secondly, the state government should identify families not staying in relief camps and also declare the basis on which they were selected as beneficiaries for assistance. Thirdly, any special assistance can only be given to beneficiaries for 30 days, and extended in the case of drought to a maximum of 90 days or three months. Lastly, the state government cannot spend more than 25% of the total annual allocation to SDRF for extraordinary relief operations.But special assistance of the kind UP government plans to give to Bundelkhand's poorest of poor - the Antyodaya familes - is in direct contradiction of most of the SDRF guidelines. Sample this: Each relief package for distribution in the region costs the state more than Rs 2,500, including packaging, transport and distribution. According to UP's department of food and civil supplies, there are 2.34 lakh Antyodaya families in seven districts of Bundelkhand, with one family unit, on an average, accounting for two adults and three children. According to SDRF guidelines, relief should be given at the rate of Rs 60 per adult and Rs 45 per child. If this formula is followed, each family is entitled to receive relief worth Rs 255.But every unit of UP's Bundelkhand package-if only the cheapest variant of each component is considered-adds up to approximately Rs 1,670, minus the costs of packaging, transport and distribution. That's 10kg potatoes for about Rs 60-Rs 80, 5kg chana dal for Rs 375, 10kg wheat flour for Rs 240, 5 litres of mustard oil for Rs 575, and 1kg desi ghee for Rs 400. Add 1kg milk powder for families with children and the amount increases by Rs 250 to settle at Rs 1,920 per packet.For 2.34 lakh beneficiaries, the cost totals Rs 45 crore. With additional cost of packaging, transport and distribution, senior government functionaries confirm one month of supplying relief to Bundelkhand's poor will cost the state's exchequer approximately Rs 70 crore, and that is on the lesser side. UP does not have the financial resources to provide relief to the drought-hit farmers. Earlier this month, CM Akhilesh Yadav wrote to prime minister Narendra Modi asking for financial assistance from the Centre ""to provide, for at least six months' edible oil and foodgrains for residents of the drought-hit districts of the state."" In UP, SDRF allocation for a year is Rs 709 crore, not allowing the government to spend more than Rs 177 crore per annum for relief work across UP. for the moment, though, UP government will support poorest of poor in Bundelkhand for a month. Then, the drought-hit poor will be on their own, again."

Jhansi, Jalaun, Hamirpur, Banda, Mahoba, Chitrakoot and Lalitpur districts fall in UP, while the rest in MP.The National Human Rights Commission had recently sought reports from the governments of the two states over the plight of people living in drought-hit Bundelkhand region."

Three consecutive droughts, with bouts of hailstorms and unseasonal rains, had dented his morale. He wanted to defend whatever little crop he managed to grow on his four-bigha land from stray animals which raided his fields in the dark.He had started to look tense and desperate. He even reduced his food intake, said Musrus son Mayaram.Musru, who owed Rs 1 lakh to moneylenders and relatives, was found dead the next morning. The post-mortem report could not ascertain the actual cause of his death, but his family, villagers and local officials believe he was the latest in the list of  sadma  (shock) deaths that have stalked the parched landscape of Bundelkhand. In Banda itself, nine such deaths have been reported in the last two months, District Magistrate Yogesh Kumar said.To witness the agrarian crisis, all one needs to do is drive through the parched region, past its definitive yellow and brown landscape. Swathes of land lie unused as farmers did not sow this season given the absence of irrigation facilities and crippling water crisis. Some took a chance, seduced by light showers, only to face huge losses later.Musrus family had borrowed the seeds and fertilizer, and even leased land at much higher costs. The burden has now shifted to his son Mayaram, whose plans to migrate were shattered by his fathers death. He now has to take care of three younger brothers. While politicians are building farm houses, farmers are forced to abandon their farms, said Mayaram, who remains without a job despite a graduate degree in education and a post-graduate degree in economics.Rising suicidesAccording to activist Sanjay Singh, around 18 lakh people have migrated from Bundelkhand over the years. Since 2003, 3,500 farmers are estimated to have committed suicide in the region. The figure this year is already 174, said Mr. Singh.While the agrarian distress has shattered the hopes of smaller peasants, even the big farmers are at a loss, many engaging in distress sale of grain and cattle. The poor quality of grain is also making it harder to sell. The Food Corporation of India accepts six per cent shrinkled grain but the farmers samples [with around 12 per cent shrinkled] are failing the FCI standards. They are engaging in distress sale much below the MSP of Rs.1525 per quintal. We have requested the government to relax the norms, said Mr. Kumar.The area under cultivation has shrunk and, consequently, the output of major crops has fallen sharply. Those relying solely on farming have been pushed to the brink.Farmers dont have enough to eat, forget about recovering the money for the cost of fertilizers, seeds, or selling it in the market. We were better off without sowing anything, said Munna Lal, a farmer in Hamirpur, who could only salvage two quintals of wheat after increased investment.The figures for the Chitrakoot Division explain it all. The overall output of wheat in the mandal has halved in the past three years. If in 2012-13, the output was 23.87 quintals per hectare, in 2015, the figure plummeted to 11.28 quintals. In 2016, it is just one-third. Chana dal (chick pea) also did not fare well. Production has fallen consistently from 3.25 quintals per hectare in 2014 to a meagre 1.75 quintals in 2015. The production of peas, masur and jowar has also fallen substantially.The total area under cultivation for the rabi crop in Chitrakoot division has halved in a year. In 2014-15, the cropped area was 8,90,982 hectares as against a target of 9,22,057, while 3,01,74 hectares were left uncultivated. The figures for the 2015-16 season are, however, much worse: against a target of 9,42,013 hectares, the cultivated area was a paltry 4,20,051 hectares. Significantly, 5,21,962 hectares were left uncultivated.The kharif crop production has been much below the State average. Rice output in 2014 was 16.17 quintals per hectare against the State average of 22.67, while bajra was 9.71 quintals per acre (State average was 19) and arhar dal (red gram) was only 3.85 quintals per hectare against the State average of 8.20.To address the crisis, the Akhilesh Yadav government has allotted Rs 867 crore for the damage to crops this year. The State suspended all revenue collection till March 31, while increasing the working days under MGNREGS from 100 to 150 days. From April, it also implemented the Food Security Act, under which food grains would be distributed for free for four months, and introduced 100 per cent coverage of all eligible families under the Samajwadi Pension Scheme. The government launched the Samajwadi Drought Relief programme, under which antyodaya families would get relief material of 10 kg of wheat flour, five kg of rice, five kg of chana dal (chick pea flour), 25 kg of potatoes, five litres of mustard oil, one kg pure ghee and one kg of milk powder.While observers have praised the State governments drought response measures, some feel the real test is in ensuring their implementation. While travelling for this story, this correspondent found that many villages were yet to even have their lists of FA beneficiaries ready. Officials blame the administrative mechanism and system of distribution for the delays and lapses."

The 32 bighas of land that Mr. Singh shares with his three brothers also boasts of a one-of-a-kind rural museum, the Humane Agrarian Centre. A farmer-activist based in Bandas Badokhar Khurd village, Mr. Singh believes that his experiment with sustainable and traditional farming could be replicated at a larger level, and could pave the way for a policy change.The idea is to ensure the prosperity of the farmers family, ecological balance and food security of the country.He calls his pioneering method of sustainable farming Aavartansheel Kheti. Loosely translated, as per a book he co-authored with Belgium environmentalist Johan Dhulster, it means periodic proportionate farming.Key elements of this approach are crop rotation, organic farming, animal husbandry, food processing, planting and research for improving soil fertility and seed development. The essence is to minimise the farmers reliance on the market while improving their standard of living.The farmer would have to utilise his farm by dividing it into three parts: one-third would be used for rearing fruits and crops, the other for growing timber and the remaining portion for animal husbandry. Mr. Singhs multi-pronged technique, pioneered and implemented by him for over a decade, is similar to the idea of farming Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been propagating in his addresses to farmers.The farmer, known in the area as pragatisheel or progressive, advises farmers to not directly trade their produce in the market but to sell the processed extracts. For instance, sell paneer but not milk, and so on. That will link the farm to the kitchen. And also give the customers a better quality and nutritious product, said Mr. Singh. Some of the popular products at his farm are amla pickle and candy, cow ghee, mustard oil, organic rice and flour (wheat, gram, and barley). Asked whether it was practical for small farmers, Mr. Singh said, yes, with certain adaptations and adjustments.Born in 1964 into a farming background, Mr. Singh studied philosophy in Allahabad University but soon turned to his ancestral vocation. In 1995, he adopted a traditional method of farming, triggered by his dismay at the negative impact of the Green Revolution.He says the Green Revolution and other policies played a big role in dismantling the traditional structure of farming and pushed the farmer to the mercy of unsustainable methods, which also harmed environment. Mr. Singh links it to the present crisis, where three consecutive droughts, with bouts of unseasonal rains and hailstorm, have devastated the morale of the Bundelkhand farmer.The outside knowhow of some experts was forced upon farmers. Till 1980, not a single bag of urea was purchased in Bundelkhand. But due to the governments policies, farmers were forced to abort traditional and more sustainable methods, eventually leading them into debt-traps, Mr. Singh said. Every time a farmer commits suicide, the government says he was burdened by debt. What is the key reason for the debt? The farmers are dying because they follow the schemes of the government. This is the real injustice.Droughts are not new to Bundelkhand. As per records, in the last century it witnessed 17 major droughts, 10 of them caused by deficient rainfall. But the traditional water-recharging methods, numerous ponds, and natural harvesting techniques of people then mitigated the scarcity. The steps taken by the government in the last three decades have nullified the work of the ancestors, Mr. Singh said.The crops grown then did not require much water. With the Green Revolution, underground water began to be extracted heavily to sustain the thirst of the seeds. The local seeds were tested and adapted to fight drought. But the seeds introduced by the government needed excess water and urea to grow. Tractors further increased the costs, Mr. Singh said.At the centre of it all, said Mr. Singh, was the ruling class apathy towards farmers, manifested in their lack of representation in policy formation. The farming sector was bearing the brunt of their mistakes and excesses of the industrial and service sectors.His farm has plenty of water, many trees bearing fruit and a steady produce of organic products"

The women and child development minister, Maneka Gandhi, decried the shooting of about 200 nilgai in the state over the past week, saying it reflected the environment ministry's ""lust for killing of animals"". But environment minister Prakash Javadekar said the culling which had been allowed on a request from the Bihar government was an element of ""scientific management"" of human-animal conflict. ""What has happened in Bihar is a big massacre of a protected animal,"" Maneka told television channels today. She said the environment ministry has been writing to all states asking them to name the species they want to kill, adding that they've permitted Bengal to kill elephants, Himachal Pradesh to kill monkeys, Goa to kill peacocks, and Maharashtra to kill wild boars. The claims prompted the environment ministry to deny that it had given permissions to kill elephants or peacocks and Javadekar to clarify that his ministry had merely responded to state requests. ""When farmers face difficulties because animals are destroying their crops and when states send us requests, we grant permission only for specific areas and specific periods,"" Javadekar said. A senior wildlife official said the environment ministry had not given any permission to kill deer, peacock, or elephant and that all permissions given have followed the standard operating processes laid down in India's Wildlife Protection Act of 1972. Under the law, state governments can submit proposals for culling if there are complaints about human-wildlife conflict. Maneka Gandhi ""Five states have submitted proposals,"" said S.K. Khanduri, inspector general of wildlife in the environment ministry. ""The ministry examines these proposals and allows scientific management in specific areas for a limited time. There have been complaints about wild boar, blue bull and other animals,"" Khanduri said. He said the ministry had approved proposals from Bihar, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand, while the proposals from Maharashtra and Gujarat are still under examination. Scientists from the Wildlife Institute of India (WII), Dehradun, have in the past documented crop-raiding by ""overabundant"" populations of nilgai in several parts of the country. While the nilgai has been recorded in 114 protected areas in 16 states, a research paper from the WII had five years ago warned that Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Haryana, Punjab, Madhya Pradesh and Uttarakhand appear to be the worst-affected by their crop-raiding. The WII study had cautioned about extensive crop losses in farmlands caused by nilgai to wheat and mustard crops, not just through foraging, but also because of trampling of crops during the resting and movements of the animals. An assessment by WII research scientist N.P.S. Chauhan in 2011 had found wild boars causing significant damage to wheat, rice, sugarcane, maize, groundnut and chickpea among other crops. Chauhan had also counted 927 human casualties caused by wild pigs alone between 1990 and 2010, one-fifth of them in crop fields. The environment ministry documented 500 human deaths last year because of human-wildlife conflict."

",https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160713/jsp/bihar/story_96302.jsp,2016-07-13,"Workers sort roasted gorgon nuts and (below) 'makhana king' Satyajit Kumar Singh. Pictures by Ruchira Gupta Jugeshwar is a Mahadalit sharecropper living off the edge of a pond in a remote village in Araria. Satyajit Kumar Singh is the CEO of Shakti Sudha Industries in Patna. Both are 46-year- old Biharis. Their lives are interconnected by the euryale ferox. This water lily with bright purple flowers is a common sight in wetlands and ponds in north Bihar. It produces a seed, called makhana in Hindi and fox or gorgon nut in English. It has become one of Bihar's biggest exports. A wild food source during the Neolithic period, the makhana was traditionally offered to Goddesses during festivals with pan (betel leaf) and machh (fish) in the Mithila region. It is now eaten roasted and popped or in a raita or kheer in Punjab, Uttar Pradesh and West Asia. It is a unique high-protein, fat-free crop that helps strengthen the kidney and spleen to relieve diarrhoea, regulate blood pressure, and relieve numbness and aches caused by arthritis. The American Herbal Products Association has given euryale seed a Class 1 rating. Thanks to its medicinal properties and use as a new form of snack, the demand for makhana has shot up globally. At the time of India's Independence, it grew only in Darbhanga and Madhubani. Now it grows in eight districts and Bihar accounts for 90 per cent of the annual world production with a market value of Rs 500 crore. Four actors who did not know each other played a role in Bihar being able to match the global demand for this little-known seed. The first actor was the Indian Council of Agricultural Research. It found a technique for the field cultivation of euryale so that more areas could be covered by this crop and the seed could be harvested for over nine months between July and March. Earlier, the harvesting season was just August and September. Now Araria, Purnea, Katihar, Samastipur, Supaul and Saharsa have begun to grow this lovely water lily. The second actor was Jugeshwar, a landless Tatma by caste, who would eke an existence by cultivating vegetables on other people's fields. He used to watch makhana pickers from the Malla caste come from Darbangha, pitch tents near his village, wrap up their lungis and walk knee-deep into the jalkar (pond) and come out with a long stem that had a fruit at the end. He followed the Mallas into the pond. At first he was put off by the thorns around the fruit and on the underside of the leaf. But they told him they earned Rs 500 a day for removing the thorns and pulling out the seeds. They taught him how to avoid the thorns and to apply mustard oil on his hands if he was pierced. Now he is an ace makhana picker. This unique inter-caste mobility has led to a larger work force involved in the cultivation, harvesting, shelling, drying, pounding and roasting of the makhana seed. Earlier one caste picked the gudiya (seed), another broke the seed and a third roasted it. The third actor was the Bihar government that made jalkars or water bodies common property, free of the ownership of contractors or water lords, making it possible for people like Jugeshwar to cultivate and harvest makhana on an impulse. The fourth actor was Satyajit Kumar Singh who envisioned that this product would replace popular snacks like potato chips and cornflakes and that he could set up a multi-crore business based on a supply chain that would pay five lakh farmers/labourers like Jugeshwar a fair procurement price. He set the ball rolling with a Rs 7-crore agro-based project whose annual turnover is now over Rs 50 crore. It supports 12,000 farmers and producers organised as interest groups and farmer producer groups. In 2006 farmers would get Rs 60 per kilo and they had to sell on credit. A decade later his company pays farmers Rs 240 per kilo directly and right at the time of procurement. Most - 80 per cent - of his supply chain are women. His vision is to take the company to Rs 5,000-crore turnover in the next ten years selling in the Middle East, UK, US and Europe. With the supply chain that he has worked so hard to create and the roasting machine he has introduced to take care of the most arduous part of processing the makhana seed, he is likely to succeed.

58f62faea3d24b0b70c28d69,Mainstreaming the marginalised,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-mumbai/Mainstreaming-the-marginalised/article14637087.ece,2016-09-11,"The motifs the artist uses are fairly self-evident, but at times removed from urban reality. Other than the overburdened donkey, we see sewing machines and kitchen implements.Ranjeeta Kumaris first solo, Labour of the Unseen  Sujani  Nihilism in the Craft , which is on at Clark House, Colaba, looks at workers who toil endlessly so that our lives function without a hitch. The 33-year-old artist asks the urban milieu to reconsider the dismissal of this labour force  their lives, hopes and ambitions  and the claim that they exist only to increase slum populations and demand pay raises every year. Through videos, installations of borrowed, bartered or found objects and photographs, and a collaboration with her mother, Kaushalya Devi, Kumari shifts the view to what she terms the labour of the unseen.Kumaris impulse comes from her own life-experiences and the views of her Marxist father. Born and raised in Patnas Harijan colony, Kumari was one of the few children with access to education. Growing up with the inequities her community faces, she found herself keenly following the lives of people in the Domkhana, near the Patna College of Arts & Crafts, where she completed her Bachelors in Fine Arts. The Domkhana (colloquially an informal settlement of the untouchable caste, Doms) was filled with cane craftspersons who made objects for religious and ritualistic ceremonies at low prices. However, they were shunned by the very people who used the objects.Motifs of artThese experiences seem to be the crux of what drives the conversation in Labour of the Unseen. The show begins with a series of watercolour paintings of the donkey, bringing to mind the most common words associated with it: labour, transport, lazy, stubborn. The well-executed portraits (one of them even brings to mind Raghu Rais famous portrait of a donkey) set the tone of what is to come: a donkey is often more useful than a horse, but still considered somewhat secondary to the horses beauty and taciturn nature.The motifs the artist uses are fairly self-evident, but at times so removed from urban reality that they throw the viewer off for a minute. Other than the often-overburdened donkey, we see sewing machines, water drums, construction tools and implements from the Indian kitchen. When we visited the show, at least three other people in the gallery at the time could not recall the word for the chakla , the flat circular board on which chapatis are rolled across India.Cultural evolutionsThe donkeys lead us to meditations on the evolution of cultures. The famed Grand Trunk Road, a 2,500-km stretch from Kabul in Afghanistan to Tamralipti in West Bengal during the Mauryan Empire, exists in modern forms and is still in use. It passes Dadri in Uttar Pradesh (most recently in the news for the beef-related murder of Mohammed Akhlaq in 2015), where Kumari completed an MFA at the Shiv Nadar University.Like an archaeologist, Kumari leaves us snapshots of items used by the worker, by the former farmer, by the now-mechanic, without so much as a trace of the person it may belong to.Take the series of photographs and installations around economic activity in Dadri, where she saw tradition clash with industry in an obvious way. Photographs of small mechanical repair shops cover the wall: a series titledTools(2016). Shops now run by those who have given up or lost their access to farmlands or cant survive on income from farming alone due to various inequities.Tools of tradeFurther ahead, another set of photos,Marks on the Land(2016), documents marks left by construction on a patch of land. Each new set of marks (messy tyre treads from trucks mixed with construction dirt moving to cemented order) feels like it is erasing its predecessor, making you wonder: does the cemented patch remember the dirt patch it used to be?And so it goes as you take in the stacks of bindas : or rolled up scraps of cloth and cement bags labourers stack on their heads as ballast when they carry heavy objects. The installation Unseen City (2016) is accompanied by recorded interviews with labourers whom the artist bartered with for their bindas. The artist recounts how she at first tried to make them new ones, but they preferred their own techniques and began to ask for cloth and material to make new ones of their own. Along with the installation are a set of photographs: items of daily use by the labourer: a tiffin, a gamchha , and so on.Farming of the Fundamentalis more direct. It references the Constitution of India, speaking of the inspiration and hope it and the writings of Dr. Ambedkar induced in a person born to a lower caste background.Kumari also speaks of the dislocation and dissonance felt by those who worked on farmlands slowly turning into a township.The video shows us a clay replica of the Constitution, in which she plants mustard seeds. The video documents the growth of the seeds into plants over three months and how they eventually die out. There is a touch of confusion in what the dying out could imply, but imagining the once-bright fields of mustard (and jowar and bajra) makes you think back to a time when your own hometown (or, in my case, Mumbai) used to be a patchwork of farmland surrounding a station and administrative buildings.A few works in between falter: the drawings of the river, while quite exquisite, dont quite lend to the context as well. The chakla , on its own plinth, retelling a conversation between the artist and her mother: is the world your home or is the home your world? It sits with a sari Kumari has block-printed with images of old sewing machines (a lot like the ones seen in theTools) and a sujani (quilt) hand-made by the artist and her mother. The sujani is a reminder of more unseen labour, womens labour, which is seen and registered even less. Together, these three somehow lack the impact ofAcross the Line, a tightly shot video of the artists mothers hands grinding daily masala (turmeric, red chilly powder) on a grindstone. Once again, evidence that speaks to the labourer a lot more than perhaps the chakla, which seems simplistic in response. In some places, the work feels it lacks contextualisation and one wonders if there need to be notes on hand for a better understanding of the work and the spaces it inhabits. However, these are small infractions that a lengthier viewing might address.The show is not just a little victory for the fairly young Shiv Nadar University, with its faculty of contemporary artists, but also a witnessing of thoughts and work from the Indian heartland that throw up challenges to an urban perspective.Labour of the Unseen  Sujani  Nihilism in the Craft will show at Clark House, Colaba, till September 29.The author is a freelance writer"

This comes in the wake of stiff opposition by a section of scientists, activists and public outcry against GM food crop as it poses a serious health hazard.""We are against the entry of GM food crops as they pose serious health hazards. We are also opposing the Centre's plan to permit field trials of GM mustard,"" agriculture minister V S Sunil Kumar said.""We have cited seven reasons for opposing GM food crops, which are GM crops would end original species diversity, GM food is scientifically proven to cause health hazard, GM seeds induce sterility so existing seeds will be lost, multi-national corporations will run seed companies and take monopoly , traditional agriculture sector will disappear, GM food crop is not productive and it will affect the existing production,"" he added.Sunil Kumar said if the Centre permits field trials of GM mustard, it will contaminate other food crops. ""With that the Centre would give ap proval for other GM food crops, which is dangerous. Every citizen has a right to safe food and entry of GM food crops is in violation of that,"" he said.GM mustard called `Dhara Mustard Hybrid 11' has been developed by Centre for Genetic Manipulation of Crop Plants, University of Delhi, with support from department of biotechnology and National Dairy Development Board.GM mustard was developed by genetically engineering bacterial genes into selected mustard parental lines to create male sterile parent plants and to induce herbicide tolerance.It is used for production of hybrids seeds which are then sold to the farmers for cultivation.Green activists said that GM crops were already banned in Europe, Japan, China and Gulf countries. Mustardgrowing states like Rajasthan, Haryana, Punjab, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Delhi have raised their protest and stopped field trials of GM crops.Leading ecological scientist, Western Ghats ecology experts panel member and Salim Ali Foundation chairman V S Vijayan said, ""If GEAC approves GM mustard as the first GM food crop, following that 71 GM food crops are lined up for approval and that will prove disastrous for agriculture and end safe food"".MNC Bayer has tied up with Monsanto and is behind the move to push for GM Mustard nod by GEAC in India, scientists said. Green activist Sridhar Radhakrishnan said that GM seeds induce sterility in plants, thus forcing the farmers to buy seeds from these companies every time and it will also end organic farming. With that India will lose its niche in global market of organic products and will be forced to get a `GM-free certificate' for every export, which is a costly affair."

The unit, located on the premises of Udyogiri at Gandamunda area, is equipped with eight motor-enabled oil extraction machines.Earlier, a Kachi ghani mustard oil unit existed at the same location which was destroyed in the super cyclone of 1999. With financial assistance from the State Government, the OKVIB took an initiative to revive the unit at a cost of `10 lakh. The cold pressed machines which can extract upto 60 litres of mustard oil per day, have been procured from Kanpur in Uttar Pradesh, OKVIB Chairman Tejeswar Parida said.Procurement of mustard seeds to run the plant will be done from remote districts of the State where farmers are victims of distress sale. Raw material will be purchased at market price from farmers through Odisha Consumer Cooperative Federation - Bhanjaprabha from all districts. This will eliminate the scope of farmers getting exploited by middlemen, Parida added.Inaugurating the processing unit, MSME Minister Jogendra Behera exhorted consumers to purchase mustard oil from OKVIB to support small farmers. The products are 100 per cent adulteration free and more such units are required to imbibe financial independence of people in remote areas, he added.The Board will soon install a honey processing plant with capacity of 100 kg of honey per day at the same facility. The honey processing plant will be procured from Pune.

Her government received attention for its extensive social-welfare agenda that it continued from its previous term, which included several subsidised Amma-branded goods such as canteens, bottled water and salt. Three years into her tenure, she was convicted in a disproportionate assets case, rendering her disqualified to hold office but she returned as chief minister after being acquitted in May 2015. In September 2016, she fell severely ill and, following 75 days of hospitalisation, died on December 5, 2016 from a cardiac arrest.Mamata BanerjeeClose on the heels of Jayalalithaas swearing-in, Mamata Banerjee too assumed charge as Chief Minister of West Bengal for a second term. The oath-taking ceremony, one of the biggest events in West Bengal, was called the coronation of the Queen of Bengal. Massive cutouts of Mamata Banerjee lined the roads leading to the venue. Besides Banerjee, 41 ministers were sworn in, many of whom touched her feet after taking an oath, reflecting a bit of the authoritarian aura of her counterpart in the southern state.Smriti IraniIranis tenure as Human Resources Development minister came to an abrupt end in 2016 after she allegedly courted more controversy than any other minister in the Narendra Modi cabinet. The former TV star bore the brunt of public outrage and the oppositions wrath over her handling of the episode that was blamed for the suicide of Rohith Vemula, a University of Hyderabad Dalit PhD scholar.She was accused of abetting the punishment of Dalit students by writing a series of letters to the University of Hyderabads vice-chancellor, which culminated in Rohith Vemula ending his life. After she was removed from the high-profile HRD ministry, Irani was given the textile portfolio.The infamous JNU row that made student union leader Kanhaiya Kumar a household name also backfired for the feisty leader. The opposition alleged that the HRD ministry had distorted facts in the case against the JNU student leaders who were representatives of Left parties.Kanhaiya KumarThe president of JNU students union was slapped with sedition charges, suspended from the university and arrested. Kumar, along with his fellow students Anirban Bhattacharya and Umar Khalid were charged with raising anti-national slogans at a students march protesting Parliament attack convict Afzal Gurus hanging on the third anniversary of the death. Kumar, who is a member of the All India Students Federation, the student wing of the CPI(M), was remanded to five-day police custody which led to an outcry among the student community, on social media and liberals across the country. Though Kanhaiya Kumar initially emerged a hero, he later drew flak for drawing political mileage from the issue.Rohith VemulaThe suicide of Rohit Vemula, a Dalit PhD scholar at the University of Hyderabad created a nationwide stir. Vemula wrote in his suicide note about his daily struggle against prejudice and discrimination, in the university and in society. Two weeks prior to his suicide Vemula and four of his Dalit friends, all members of the Ambedkar Students Association were suspended by the university following a complaint of assault by an ABVP leader. Vemula and his friends denied the charges. Vemula committed suicide soon after, an episode that drew attention to the plight of Dalit students in universities and also the alleged witch hunt that was pursued by then HRD Minister Smriti Irani in this particular case.Zakir NaikThe popular Islamic missionary and the controversial preacher came into the public eye after the Dhaka restaurant attack in July. He was accused of being the inspiration behind the attacks. Investigators claimed that Zakir Naik played a role in instigating youth to join the terror outfit Islamic State.Irom Chanu SharmilaA constant activist seeking the repeal of the controversial Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA) ended her 16-year-old fast. First introduced to fight the Naga rebellion in the 1950s, AFSPA has been a bone of contention in Jammu and Kashmir in the north and Manipur and other parts of northeast India as well, mainly due to its reported misuse by security forces. Sharmila now plans to take her battles to the political arena and contest in the Manipur elections.Akhilesh Yadav and Shivpal YadavThere have been undercurrents between unclenephew Akhilesh Yadav and Shivpal Yadav ever since Akhilesh was named chief ministerial nominee of the Samajwadi party in the previous Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections, over Shivpal Yadav. However, things took a turn for the worse when SP Chief Mulayam Singh Yadav made Shivpal the partys state unit chief in place of Akhilesh, in an attempt to strike a balance between his son and his brother before the upcoming UP elections.Akhilesh Yadav stripped his uncle of three portfolios. Shivpal Yadav, thereafter, resigned from the state government as well as the post of the chief of Samajwadi party state line. The saga now continues as party chief Mulayam on December 28 released a list of over 300 candidates for the 2017 election, completely disregarding son Akhileshs picks; and Akhilesh restorted a day later by naming 167 candidates of his own to contest under different election symbols.Sri Sri RavishankarSpiritual leader and founder of the Art of Living (AOL) Sri Sri Ravishankar was mired in controversy after the World Cultural Festival hosted by him on the plains of the river Yamuna is alleged to have caused large-scale damage to the fragile eco-system around the water body. Environmentalists from across the country had protested the permission given to the festival to be held on the floodplains of the Yamuna, as they warned that massive temporary constructions for the event would cause an ecological disaster. Pressed for time and construction already having begun full swing when the case reached the National Green Tribunal (NGT), all that was done was to go ahead and give a green signal to the event, after the foundation agreed to pay Rs 5 crore in damages, which was never recovered.Vijay MallyaMallya, who has always been in the news for his flamboyant lifestyle, was in the limelight in 2016 for a wholly different reason  the poor state of his finances. The collapse of Kingfisher Airlines unravelled his business empire. And even as banks were trying to recover the thousands of crores of rupees given to his companies as loan, Mallya was allowed to fly out of the country despite a case being filed by the CBI filed against him for fraud, money laundering, and misappropriation among other charges. The liquor barons escape from the country led to the opposition putting political pressure, resulting in the revocation of Mallyas passport and a non-bailable warrant issued against him. Mallya, however, continues to live in the UK, evading the law in India.Baba RamdevSwadeshi business baron Baba Ramdevs Patanjali products is estimated to be worth over Rs 5,000 crore and the profits surged by almost 150 percent in 2016. The yogis products have been inching close to national brands like Dabur, Marico, Godrej, ITC, Nestle, HUL and P&G. A recent report, however, sparked doubts about the efficacy of his products that are claimed to be completely herbal and in some cases, organic. A court fined Patanjali Rs 11 lakh after it found the company guilty of ""releasing misleading advertisements by selling certain products with its labels although they were being manufactured by some other firm."" The case was filed in November 2012 after samples of products, including edibles like salt, honey, besan (gram flour), mustard oil and jam allegedly failed quality tests in August.Raghuram RajanRBIs 23rd governor, globally respected and credited with bringing down inflation in the country  and for taking several bold economic decisions  stepped down after completing his tenure in September. Rajans outspoken nature, particularly his comments on Prime Minister Narendra Modis pet project Make in India, which he said was better named Make for India, as reports suggest, did not go down well with the government. That, among other reasons, is suspected to have dented his chance at a second term in office, the possibility of which was widely discussed in the media. In a television interview, after announcing his decision not to seek a second term, he said, I was willing perhaps to stay, provided we could reach the right kind of agreement. We didnt. Thats where it ended."

But nearly 2,500 km away from home, he is guarding the perimeter of a luxury hotel in Kasargod.The 21-year-old Robin Singh is an 18-time state champion in sub-junior, junior and senior categories between 2012 and 2016. At the Subrata Classic International Powerlifting Championship at Jamshedpur, he finished second behind Irans Arash Rezaei in the 93kg category.I thought the government would support me. But all I got was `10,000 from the district administration on the Republic Day, he said, choking on his words. Poverty was gnawing at his dream and the self-trained powerlifter left his home at Ladpur village in Bulandshahr district. Robin came to Delhi and left his CV at several staffing agencies. One of them found him a job as a security executive at The Lalit Resort & Spa at Bekal. Powerlifting is not an Olympic sport but championships are conducted regularly by federations. It is a strength sport in which contestants attempt three types of lift - squat, bench press and dead lift - in a set sequence.Born to a farmer couple - Lalita and Subhas Singh Poonia - Robin was taken to bodybuilding when he was in Class VIII in 2008. There was no sportsperson or bodybuilders in the family and my parents were baffled at my choice, he said. He converted a shed in his house into a gym, made weights out of his mothers chakki (stone grinder) and upholstered a plank with rexine for his bench press. In 2012, he drifted to powerlifting through Youtube and signed up for a trial for North Zone championship at Mathura. I sat through the tournament watching others lifting weight, learning the techniques, he said.At the NZ championship at Patiala, Robin won the gold in the 93kg category. Since then there was no looking back. I go to tournaments to learn techniques. I speak to referees for guidance, then train at home, he said. But without a proper trainer, it was just a matter of time before he herniated his spinal discs. In 2015, I had bulge in L4, L5 and S1 discs, he said. Doctors asked him to quit the sport.But after six months of rest, he returned to the ring. But the first resistance came from his home. Every day Robin drank four to five litres of milk and ate 60 almonds. His parents cultivated wheat, mustard and rice in their 1.5 acres of farmland but the income was too meagre to sustain Robins schedule. He has two younger brothers too. Luckily, my mother reared two cows and three buffaloes, he said.The frequent crop failure due to drought and rain also made his going tough. But his exploits at the Subrata Classic changed his familys perception. The villagers gave me a rousing welcome upon my return. My parents said they would support me. But I know it was tough for them. Perhaps, my dream was too big, he said. On the brighter side, Ladpur started warming up to the sport. Youngsters started approaching Robin who threw open his gym for them. But after five months, Robin left home in search of a job."
