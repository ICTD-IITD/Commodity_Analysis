58fd12b57be9e06c937144d6,Shooter from Hyderabad called to tame wild elephant on trampling spree in Bihar,http://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2017/mar/24/shooter-from-hyderabad-called-to-tame-wild-elephant-on-trampling-spree-in-bihar-1585432.html,2017-03-24,"PATNA: A wild elephant has wreaked such havoc in parts of Bihars eastern Bhagalpur district that anxious forest authorities have requisitioned help of a certified shooter from Hyderabad to tame the animal.The wild tusker trampled a man to death in Kahalgaon subdivision of Bhagalpur district on Thursday and left two others seriously injured in the same locality on Wednesday, said Sanjay Kumar Sinha, the divisional forest officer (DFO).Believed to have entered Bhagalpur district from forests in neighbouring Jharkhands Godda district, the elephant has been roaming from village to village with gay abandon and rushing to trample people coming in front of it. It has also damaged a few huts and some mustard crops ready for harvesting, said officials.We have already deployed a team of experts from Bankura district in neighbouring West Bengal. They have used tranquilisers, but with little success so far in bringing the wild tusker to control, said regional chief conservator of forests (RCCF) Prashant Kumar Gupta. This is why we have requisitioned the services of Shahnawaz Safat Ali, a certified shooter from Hyderabad. His arrival is expected soon, he added.The pachyderm, which is spotted in one block of the district one day and in another the next day for the past four days, trampled an elderly man, Lakhan Das, to death in Alampur district. It also left two men  Uday Kant Mahto and Narayan Sahni of Sadanand Baisa village  badly injured on Wednesday, said forest officials.Forest department officials said rising instances of human interference in forests and dwindling sources of water could be a reason behind elephants entering human habitations. Although Bhagalpur district does not fall in the migratory area of wild elephants, there are rare cases, such as the present one, of wild elephants from parts of Jharkhand straying here, said Gupta."
58ff70e27be9e041531468c3,On the Migrant Express,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/on-antyodaya-express-migrant-workers-in-kerala-tamil-nadu-from-west-bengal-assam-railways-minister-suresh-prabhu-4585838/,2017-03-25,"When it sets off from Howrah station, the Antyodaya is almost empty, but as it enters Vijayawada, almost every inch of space is taken. (Express Photo by Shubham Dutta) When it sets off from Howrah station, the Antyodaya is almost empty, but as it enters Vijayawada, almost every inch of space is taken. (Express Photo by Shubham Dutta)From a 21-year-old fleeing the sea in Goa to a 54-year-old former bus conductor from Malda who is going to Kerala for the first time, the Antyodaya Express, a fully unreserved train between Howrah and Ernakulam, and its 20 coaches carry the shared burden of a thousand stories and dreams. The Indian Express rides alongsideFitted with cushioned luggage racks, vestibuled ends for passengers to move through compartments, drinking water dispensers, mobile-charging points, fire extinguishers and modular toilets, the Antyodaya services the Eastern-Southern railway corridor, which sees the heaviest movement of migrant workers in the country. A 2013 report by the Gulati Institute of Finance and Taxation that was placed in the Kerala Assembly said that four states  Assam, West Bengal, Bihar and Odisha  alone accounted for 62% of the migrant workers in Kerala.The train finally pulls into Ernakulam (above) on Monday morning (Express Photo by Shubham Dutta) The train finally pulls into Ernakulam (above) on Monday morning (Express Photo by Shubham Dutta)At its launch, Railways Minister Suresh Prabhu said, Antyodaya Express is a long-distance, fully unreserved, superfast train service for the common man to be operated on dense routes The facilities provided in Antyodaya coaches are similar (to those) in first class. Our governments focus is on aam aadmi so we launched the product with many facilities for them.Except, most people dont know about the train. When it sets out from Howrah at 5 pm on March 18, a Saturday, its third trip from Howrah to Ernakulam, only 200 of the 1,600 seats had been filled. Almost everyone on the train had found their way here accidentally, after missing the other train, Suvidha Special, which, curiously, runs on the same date and on the same route.The problem is that there has been very little publicity about the Antyodaya whereas the Suvidha Special continues to be completely crammed  if you get an empty patch to sit on the train, you dont move for the next 36 hours, says a senior officer of the South Eastern Railways.So this Saturday evening, as passengers gingerly get on to the new train, complete with the sheen rarely associated with the Railways, many wonder if they have got onto the wrong train.Like Mohammad Rafiqul. A few minutes after he steps in, the 33-year-old, a veteran of unreserved trains and a labourer in Kochi, realises that all 20 coaches of Antyodaya are unreserved. He sits on a berth and tentatively stretches out his legs. Then, with more abandon, he flings his small bag onto the parallel seat and says with a smile, It doesnt smell of sweat. It smells different.By 8 pm, the train is rumbling through Odisha and all mobile charging points have been taken. Music from mobile phones, ranging from folk songs of Bengal to Bhojpuri film music, compete with the steady chugging of the train. One passenger points to his GPS, the blue dot rushing parallel to the ocean and asks another, You think we can see the sea from here? The sun has set though and the observatory windows  a novelty on unreserved trains  have little to offer.Home-cooked meals are prised open, filling the train with the heady aroma of mustard and spicy fish curries. The lights stay on, all night. But that doesnt seem to bother many  as one passenger puts it, a good meal and a place to stretch your legs is all you need to get some sleep.Much of the journey continues the same way. It isnt until 12.30 on Sunday afternoon that the train reaches Vijayawada, the junction where the most number of passengers get on. Most of them are migrant workers from Chhattisgarh, Bihar and Andhra Pradesh. But the amazement of the passengers as they get to the train and the shared burden of their stories remain the same, helping workers who dont speak the same language to somehow find common ground.Take, for instance, Shaiful Sheikh. The 24-year-old from Mayapur in West Bengal works near Aluva in Kerala. He is engaged in a deep conversation with Hari Shankar Kumar from Jharkhand  about the train, the Narendra Modi governments plans for the poor and how it all connects with demonetisation. When neither Hindi nor Bengali proves to be a language they can converse in, they throw in a few Telugu and Malayalam words.Our stories are all the same. We are all here because of our stomachs, says Kumar.Over the next few hours, there are more stories  of drought, rains coming too late or too early, crops lost to blight, parents dying and leaving behind only debt, of industries moving away or eating up their land, of crooked politicians.It isnt until 1 am on Monday that the train finally fills up. As it pulls into Coimbatore Junction, hundreds fill the compartments. Some lie underneath the seats to catch some sleep, others balance themselves against the new scratch-proof walls of the new train and somehow, manage to fall asleep.At the start of the journey, many had looked around in wonder at the near empty train. Now, they sit stoic, squeezing in to accommodate more people. Isnt this how trains for the poor always are, after all?Pramod Kumar, 21No job yetFrom: Raigarh, ChhattisgarhDestination: Salem, Tamil NaduAfter a bit of coaxing, Kumar reveals the truth: he is fleeing Goa. He simply hated the place. A year ago, says the 21-year-old, he went to Goa on a whim after seeing a photograph in a magazine. I thought itd be nice to get work near the sea, he says . But that place was horrible. I used to work on a fishing boat and it was scary. I didnt know how to swim. I learnt that but what good is a little boat if the weather is bad?, he says, adding that he is now on his way to Salem, Tamil Nadu, where a cousin works.After some negotiation, Ram managed to find a train to Vijayawada from where he will travel to Salem. My cousin said the contractor would give me food and pay me Rs 8,000 or 9,000 a month. Thats better than what I was getting in Goa. Besides, thankfully, theres no sea in Salem, he says with a shudder.In his bag: A GOA T-shirt and some clothesBirender Kumar Ram, 33Juice shop ownerFrom: Karihari, JharkhandDestination: VijaywadaRam moved out of his village when he was in his twenties. My family didnt have any money. I had studied till Class 12, but there was no job in the village. So I started working in a restaurant in Tirupathi and later Hyderabad.He worked his way through different jobs  mostly restaurants, sometimes at shops. I did well because I was educated. The language was a problem, but when your survival depends on it, you can learn almost anything.A couple of years ago, Ram and his friend from his village started a juice shop in Tirupathi. We named it Balaji Juice Shop. It is a good shop on the way to the temple. I save Rs 10,000 a month, he says.Ram says he misses his family  his wife and two children are in Jharkhand  but cant say that about his village. Every time I go back to the village, it seems strange, a little alien.In his bag: A note his son wrote to him, neatly folded in his walletNaresh Sarana, 23Works at ice-making plantFrom: Gossaigaon, AssamDestination: ErnakulamThe 23-year-old has a hard time explaining where his home is. Buxa, in Assam, he says repeatedly. When told Buxa is in West Bengal, he explains patiently, Buxa, the forest. Our home is in the forest that starts from Buxa in West Bengal and comes all the way to lower Assam. My family is from Gossaigaon.The 23-year-old has studied till his Class 10 and now works in Ernakulam at an ice-making plant. He explains that whenever he travels out of home, he stops at Siliguri, a city known for its wholesale Chinese goods market. I picked up a new leather wallet there, he says with a grin.I have been working in Kerala for two years. A friend of mine told me about this job and I get paid Rs 7,500 a fortnight. My family grows a little rice on our field but that is not enough. So my parents depend on my income.In his bag: His new walletNoorwar Mondal, 32Construction workerFrom Mayapur, West BengalDestination: AluvaMondal has been a construction worker in Kerala for three years. Like his ancestors before him, he had worked as a sharecropper, but soon, found that work was hard to come by as were the wages. By 2014, he decided to join the many people from his village and make his way to Kerala.It was easier than I thought because there are so many people from Bengal in Kerala. For instance, my family told me to carry mustard oil with me so that I could make fish curry  mustard oil is hard to find in Kerala.His work is tough but pays well, between Rs 450 and Rs 500 a day, along with overtime. In Bengal, there are too many people and not enough jobs; in Kerala, people are all well educated and dont want to do the work we do, says Mondal, who spends six months with his family  wife and two children  and six months working and saving.In his bag: A bottle of mustard oilMd. Rafiqul, 33No job yetFrom Islampur, West BengalDestination: ErnakulamRafiqul used to work as a compounder in a local hospital in Islampur, a town in West Bengals Murshidabad district. But last year, after his son was born, he decided he needed to get work that paid more. His friends told him about Kerala and how he could find work laying floor tiles. So he packed his bags and took the train, his first trip to Kerala.I am a little worried. Everyone has said that Kerala has good fish. But the fish in Murshidabad is the best in the world. Our Hilsa is the best and there is no one who can cook it the way we do. I cant survive on dosas, he says laughing.And then, on a serious note, he says, My friends told me I can earn almostRs 1,000 a day in Kerala. From Ernakulam, I will meet a friend and we will go together to Thiruvananthapuram. If what they have promised comes true, it will change our lives  at least my sons if not mine, he says.In his bag: A bottle of mustard oilMohammad Isharul Islam, 26Construction workerFrom Islampur, West BengalDestination: ErnakulamIslam has been in Kerala for six years, working as a construction worker. That makes him somewhat of an old hand. So when he talks about his work in Kerala and why he doesnt think the good run will last, people around him pull in closer to hear him speak. Demonetisation was a turning point. Construction work stopped altogether and all of us were stranded, he says, adding that his employers still owe him about Rs 50,000.Still unmarried, he laughs and says that his mother is constantly horrified at the thought of him marrying someone from outside Bengal. The 26-year-old works as a construction worker, laying floor tiles in homes. Its strange working in these big homes and then going back to a cramped room. But at least I can send about Rs 3,000 to my family. But what they really look forward to is the banana chips I take for them, he says.In his bag: A family photographDeepak Dhaori, 29CarpenterFrom Jhargram, West BengalDestination: VijaywadaA carpenter, Dhaori is on his first trip outside Bengal. The 29-year-old is from Chandri, a village in Jhargram, 37 km from Lalgarh, which was the site of the November 2008 clashes between villagers and cadres of the erstwhile Left Front government.Dhaori plans to alight at Vijayawada and take the bus to Secunderabad in Hyderabad. Someone from my village is in Secunderabad and they said they need carpenters. In my village, there is no work and it has been that way for years, he says.Married, with a boy and a girl whom he has left behind, the 29-year-old says that until a decade ago, people in his village used to die due to lack of medical attention and clean drinking water. To be honest, I am scared to go to a new place. There are things, habits you never thought you would give up  like the evening tea with friends. But I had to leave home.In his bag: A new shirtSonu Ram, 40LabourerFrom Jabalpur, MPDestination: CoimbatoreOn his way to Shoranur, a town in Keralas Palakkad district, this is the 40-year-olds first trip outside home. There is no work in Madhya Pradesh. The drought last year wiped out the farms. We lost all our crops. My elder son studied till his Class 8 and then went to Kerala for work, the other is in Class 5. My son said only if both of us work can we support the family.While his son paints houses, he says he is unsure about what he will do  I may have to start by laying bricks.He had taken a train from Jabalpur to Vijayawada, from where they boarded the Antyodaya Express. Asked about the work and his expectations, he says, From what my son has told me, I can make about Rs 15,000 a month and not spend too much because the employers give us food and a place to sleep.In his bag: A list of phone numbers and directions written on a piece of paperRabindra Mali, 27Mill workerFrom Cuttack, OdishaDestination: CoimbatoreThe 27-year-old has been working for over a decade at a spinning mill in Kozhikode. From a traditional fishing family near Cuttack, Rabindra says he has never been to school. When I was 10, I went to Tirupati because I heard you can get work near the temple. I started working in a tea shop and then at a restaurant as a waiter. Later, I got this job in a spinning mill, he says.Rabindra will get off at Coimbatore and take a bus to his factory. I work about 12 hours a day and make Rs 390 a day  thats about Rs 12,000 a month, he says. The company he works for, says Mali, pays him overtime but no food and accommodation. My sister and brother-in-law also live in Kozhikode. He works in a company and she works as a domestic help, he says, adding that he hopes to someday bring his wife and 3-year-old son to the city.In his bag: A sari for his sister and a new shirt for his brother-in-lawMahesh Bharti, 24MasonFrom Jabalpur, MPDestination: CoimbatoreWhen he is not poring over Hindi film magazines, Bharti has people around him hooked with his knowledge of all things Bollywood, passionately discussing everything from Katrina Kaifs love life to Salman Khans troubles with the law.Bharti works as a contract labourer in Shoranur, a town in Palakkad district, and earns about Rs 650 a day. I am going to Coimbatore and from there I will go to Shoranur. Thats where I have been working the past year. Tiles, plaster, wall putty  I do it all, he says with a grin. His parents continue to live in Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh, where they have own some land.In his bag: A few Hindi film magazinesTapash Pappu Maity, 26WaiterFrom KolkataDestination: ErnakulamTapash Maity, or Pappu as he calls himself, worked as a waiter at various outlets of Kwality Walls in Kolkata until three years ago. The 26-year-old married two years ago and now has a year-old son.He says, The job in Kolkata was okay  the money wasnt too good, but it was good, steady work. But the problem was my salary was stuck at Rs 8,000 a month for far too long. In Kerala, I work for Lazza Ice Creams  I serve at their parlours and earn about Rs 24,000 a month.It helps to be from a big city, he says  nothing surprises me. Others, you know, they see women roaming around late at night in malls and get a shock. Not me.In his bag: Photographs of his wife and year-old sonMilan Mondal, 23Construction workerFrom Murshidabad, West BengalDestination: Ernakulam, KeralaWhen he was 12, Mondal borrowed Rs 400 from his parents, saying he was going to Kolkata to see the city, and ran away with an elder cousin.My first job was at a construction site in Kolkata  a club house run by the Left that was being renovated. In the mornings, I would fetch water and in the evenings, when the party people sat down to play cards, Id serve tea and get some bakshish. I had left home with Rs 400; when I went back eight years later, I had Rs 4,000.Mondal has been in Kerala for three years, working at a construction site in Idduki. I earn Rs 6,000 a week, much more than what I earned in Kolkata, he says, distracted as he fiddles with his smartphone. Gadgets are my real love. Tonight, I am going to watch movies on YouTube  old Bengali films. Those stories are from a simpler time.In his bag: SD card with moviesSheikh Hasibul Arinde, 40ElectricianFrom HowrahDestination: CoimbatoreThe 40-year-old is a trained electrician, having earlier worked for a government-run electrical agency in Bengal. He now works as an electrical contractor for Larsen and Toubro, on a project near Coimbatore.I have been working as an electrician for decades now. My father was an electrician at the Kolaghat Power Plant near Kolkata and I learnt from him. But to be able to work in Bengal, you need a licence and for that, you have to pay bribes to the party, he says, adding that he is glad he moved to Coimbatore.My daughter and son are in school in Howrah. I dont want them to become electricians, but I always tell them to see and experience new things. For instance, when I first went to Tamil Nadu, I had a hard time with the language. Not anymore, he says.In his bag: A new shirt that his in-laws gave himAbhishek Sarkar, 29ElectricianFrom Nabadwip, West BengalDestination: CoimbatoreSarkar met Arinde while in Kerala and the two now work together for the same company in Coimbatore. Their friendship, they admit, is rare for these times. He is Muslim, I am Hindu. We live together and eat together. I celebrate his festivals and he does mine. But when we go back home, people give us strange looks. What they dont understand is this: Hindu or Muslim, our problems are the same. God doesnt come into the picture when youre not getting paid, says Sarkar, talking about how demonetisation hit people like him.For almost two months, we didnt get paid. Employers still owe us about Rs 75,000. One of the contractors from Odisha said he would pay us soon; now he doesnt even pick his phone, he says.In his bag: His mother has packed a packet of sandesh from his favorite shopArshad Rahman, 37Labour contractorFrom Kamrup, AssamDestination: Katpadi, Tamil NaduWhen asked what he does, he says, Businessman. I am a labour contractor.I am a migrant, but not a labourer. I arrange for labourers, he says repeatedly. He says he first went to the south around 15 years ago when he got an order to get labourers to work at a Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) in Chennai. My men have made almost all the STPs in Chennai. My labourers are the best, he brags. Talking of how he began his business, he says, There were so many people in the Northeast and East looking for work that I realised it was a great opportunity.Rahman, who says he has worked in several states, including Gujarat, Telangana and Kerala, saves about Rs 30,000 a month. Work has slowed down in Gujarat because all the big projects have already come up. In Kerala, too, it will slow down. Right now, I am going to Katpadi near Vellore (Tamil Nadu) and after that, I may have to go to Telangana.In his bag: A new pair of jeansSheikh Shamim, 29Construction workerFrom Pandua, West BengalDestination: ErnakulamThis is Shamins second trip to Kerala, where he works at a construction site. After spending almost an hour worrying if he was on the right train, he finally settles down.A year ago, a contractor from our village asked me if I wanted work. I said yes, and here I am. It is hard work, but the money is better than anything you get in Bengal, he says.The 29-year-old from Pandua in Hooghly district, who dropped out after Class 3, used to work as a rickshaw driver. With his wife expecting their second child, he says he had to find a way to earn more money. I came at a bad time, though. Within a few months of my coming to Kerala, work dried up because of demonetisation. Contractors said they couldnt pay us anymore, so I went back. This time, I am planning to stay for as long as I can, he says.In his bag: Puffed rice and naaru (sweet made of coconut and jaggery)Sheikh Mantu, 54LabourerFrom Malda, West BengalDestination: ErnakulamThe 54-year-old worked as a bus conductor for close to four decades, but three years ago, after a near-fatal accident, his family said they wouldnt let him to do that work any longer. I was a conductor on the Malda-Kolkata route. I did that for 36 years. But once, our bus met with an accident  the driver was killed and my rib cage was shattered. My family was scared after that. They still call buses vehicles of death.But with his family  wife, three children and an ailing father  to take care of, Mantu had to find some work. There were others from my village working as labourers in Kerala so a year ago, I decided to come with them, he says.The work in Kerala, he says, is strenuous, but the money is good. I do plastering and painting. I used to make about Rs 400 a day, now I make twice that. But to be honest, I didnt think I would have to work at this age.In his bag: A pack of cardsShamwar Hossain, 20Construction workerFrom Mayapur, West BengalDestination: Aluva, KeralaHossain has been to Kerala only once before. He works as a construction worker there, earning Rs 450 a day. I work for a contractor who tells me where to work. The hours are regular in Kerala and pay comes on time. The government is also more sensitive to the needs of the poor. For instance, I am told that they will give me a identity card, he says.Hossains family are sharecroppers, but with agriculture in Nadia, his home district, failing, labour is no longer in demand and his father has been unemployed for five years.I dont plan to go back to Nadia. There are others who miss home. I dont. When I think about home, I think of people suffering because they cant find work and my mother skipping meals to let us to eat. In Kerala, lifes good. I earn well, I work hard and I sleep peacefully at night.In his bag: Four packets of chanachur (a snack of chickpeas, lentils and nuts)Mritunjay, 24CarpenterFrom Kharagpur, West BengalDestination: Katpadi, Tamil NaduMritunjay says never wanted to leave his home in Kharagpur. But with no formal education, the 24-year-old says he couldnt have found a job in his village. There are schools for us Adivasis in Kharagpur, but I never studied. That was a mistake.He learnt carpentry from his uncle in Kharagpur, helping him make tables and chairs for government offices. He had earlier worked in Thane as a labourer but returned to his uncles shop. Not only did they not pay well, he says, but they were cheats and the city is too crowded and people unkind.Mrirtunjay says his uncles friend is a construction worker in Vellore. My uncle said his friend would help me. He even bought me the train ticket. I have been told that I can earn Rs 500 a day and if I do a lot of overtime, over Rs 15,000 a month. Thats almost double of what I was making in Kharagpur.In his bag: Two new gamchasMohammad Firoz, 26MasonFrom: HooghlyDestination: ErnakulamThe 26-year-old first came to Ernakulam in 2008. He knew an uncle in the area, who quickly set him up to work as a bricklayer.Since then, he has progressed to being a wall putty specialist. Initially, I had some trouble with the food in Kerala. Everything is cooked in coconut oil. I dont like that. There are others who will eat just about anything. But that isnt me. I enjoy my food. Luckily, there was good beef in Kerala  that was a life saver.Firoz now earns about Rs 500 a day, plastering walls at a Kendriya Vidyalaya in Ernakulam. Its a government school so we get paid on time. I make aboutRs 3,400 a week, including overtime. That is enough for me to live comfortably  eat beef and fish once in a while whenever I dont feel like eating the food the contractors give me.In his bag: a photograph of his parentsFor all the latest India News, download Indian Express App nowFirst Published on: March 26, 2017 3:26 am"

There would be three vans initially, spread out across Kolkata.AT A time when meat sellers have come under watch in Uttar Pradesh, and now Jharkhand, the West Bengal government is set to get non-vegetarian delicacies to Kolkatas doorsteps through Meat on Wheelz.The initiative has been started by West Bengal Livestock Development Corporation Limited (WBLDCL)s popular brand Haringhata Meat, which also deals in non-conventional meat such as that of quail, duck, turkey and emu. Officials said that apart from taking cooked non-veg delicacies to Kolkata and its suburbs, Meat on Wheelz would also sell frozen packaged items of Haringhata.The scheme was launched by Animal Resources Development Department Minister Swapan Debnath on Monday at the departments headquarters at Salt Lake. There would be three vans initially, spread out across Kolkata. Depending on the success of the pilot project, a fewmore vehicles would be added, including in other district headquarters of the state, an official said.On Tuesday, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee commented about the recent happenings in Uttar Pradesh, where meat sellers went on strike in protest against the crackdown on slaughterhouses. People are afraid & many are scared about differences over caste, creed & religion, she said in a statement.Among the dishes planned on Meat on Wheelz are quail briyani, gandharaj turkey and duck roast.An official said that Haringhata Meats sales had trebled over the past few years, with that of quail, duck and turkey meat doubling in the last one year. In 2014-15, we had sales of Rs 4.35 lakh in frozen and processed meat. By 2015-16 September, it had jumped to Rs 9.58 lakh. If you take into account sales during the Ahare Bangla food festival, we crossed the Rs 10 lakh mark, said the official. Ahare Bangla is an annual food festival organised by the West Bengal government, which saw participation from other countries as well last year.Officials said Haringhata had also tied up with three food courts at shopping malls in Kolkata, one in Siliguri and with different hotel and retail chains.WBLDCL deals primarily with the production, processing and marketing of hygienic meat products of different types, like chicken, pork, chevon (adult goat meat), mutton, duck, quail, emu, vanaraja chicken (chicken breed bred for rural areas) and turkey. The organisation also sells non-meat products like table eggs, duck eggs, quail eggs, pure mustard oil, ghee and honey.The corporation has two modern hygienic meat processing units in Haringhata of Nadia district  one for pork products and the other for chicken, duck, goat and lamb.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

The final nod has to come from environment minister.Civil society groups have been opposing the transgenic crops and have cited that the claims around yield increases and decline in edible oil imports by adoption of this GM mustard were totally unfounded while the benefit claims have no basis or proof presented, and have indeed been discounted by the Government itself in its affidavit to the Supreme Court.We hear that the government is preparing its report card to the nation on three years of Modi Sarkaar. Is this GM mustard Modi governments dangerous gift to the nation, to mark its 3 years in existence?, asked said Yudhvir Singh of Bhartiya Kisan Union and Convenor of Indian Coordination Committee for Farmers Movements (ICCFM).He said that they all would like to remind the government about what BJP had promised in its Manifesto in 2014 with regard to GM technology, and that this GM mustard in no way abides by that commitment.Meanwhile, Chairperson of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Environment & Forests, Science & Technology Renuka Choudhury has written to the Environment Minister that GM mustard should not be approved since the Committee is studying the subject and will give its report soon.Rajesh Krishnan of the Coalition for a GM-Free India said that the nation is waiting to see a responsible and fearless decision from the Environment Minister, and for him to reject the GM mustard application.So far, Bihar, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Delhi governments have written to the Centre against GM mustard approval, and states like Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Haryana, Odisha and West Bengal have stated that they will not allow GM mustard, he said.Kavitha Kuruganti of Alliance for Sustainable & Holistic Agriculture (ASHA) said that adverse environmental health impacts of such crops are showing up in South American countries like Argentina, prompting the medical fraternity there to issue warnings.GM mustard is unneeded, unsafe and is being sought to be brought in fraudulently, with all data hidden from independent scientific scrutiny, said Kuruganti.[8:38 PM, 5/17/2017] +91 95001 02551: The Anti-Corruption Branch, probing tanker scam on Wednesday questioned Delhi CMs private secretary.

He arrived at 11.30 AM for the questioning at the ACB office. He had been asked to bring some files but he didnt get some, an official investigating the matter said.Earlier, The ACB recorded sacked Delhi minister Kapil Mishra's detailed statement who is also a complainant in the case now. Mishra has been asked to join investigation on Thursday. According to the ACB officials, so far no concrete document has been provided to the officials by Kapil Mishra. He has given old documents and a summary letter.The Kejriwal-led AAP government had in June 2015 constituted a fact-finding committee to go into alleged irregularities in procuring some 385 stainless steel water tankers by the DJB. The Delhi government in June 2016 sent a report of the fact-finding committee to Jung following which an FIR was registered in the case."

Far from the networks of seed corporations , farmers here still do agriculture in the traditional way where they are not only cultivators but also field scientists and seed tinkerers Most farmers in the Garhwal and Kumaon hills have never bought commercial seeds. They cultivate their own and share them with other farmers, who repay with their own local seeds or return double the quantity of the borrowed variety from the next crop. This system has preserved seed diversity and quality for centuries.""You will not be able to count the number of seed varieties we have in our village. People come here to borrow and we give away happily,"" said Pushpa Devi, who was tilling the soil for planting vegetables in Jhardargaon near Upli Nagni with a younger woman farmer named Hima Meher.Their village has about 350 varieties of paddy, including dryland ones, 32 of wheat, 220 of kidney beans or rajma, 12 of millets (63 sub-varieties of foxtail millet alone), and 5-7 varieties of each vegetable that grows here.Jhardargaon is home to farmer leader Vijay Jhardari who leads the Beej Bachao Andolan for preserving traditional seed varieties. He and other farmer leaders are now worried as the promised yields of the newly-approved genetically modified (GM) mustard could give the corporations an upper hand in their David-and-Goliath fight.""The hills of Uttarakhand have a culture of mixed cropping. Just like you can't eat the same food every day, the soil doesn't like a monopoly of crops. It wants variety. The crop cycle here is what suits the climate and gives the nutrients to soil and people,"" said Jhardari, adding, ""GM technology will ruin the Himalayan ecology."" Jhardari is a veteran of Chipko Andolan that aimed to save trees in the 1970s. He started Beej Bachao with other Chipko members. When TOI met him, he was preparing for a festival to commemorate the tree-hugging movement. ""We had a slogan for our seed movement: kya hai jungle ke upkar? Mitti, pani aur byar (what are the benefits of forests? Soil, water and air),"" he said.He opposes the intellectual property rights (IPR) corporations' claim on their seeds. ""I would say all patents on seeds should be banned. Seed is a common resource for farmers. If farmers lose access to their seeds, they will lose their independence and dignity."" Satish Dhar, another activist and Dehradun-based farmer, agreed with Jhardari: ""Nature tries to create a seed suited to an area's geography. Local seeds are in harmony with local environment,"" Jhardari said.He also added that, ""Today, seed accounts for 10-15% of a crop are cost. Farmers can't afford it. It comes with a package of herbicides and crop insurance. It's a nexus and the farmer gets trapped.""Beej Bachao members distrust not only corporations but also agricultural universities and national institutions. ""I am not in favour of giving my seeds to the National Gene Bank. Why should we? Will they return those varieties to us when we need them? Will they promise not to share them with companies? I know that they gave some of our millet varieties to leading biscuit companies,"" said Jhardari.Jhardari said G B Pant University of Technology and Agriculture, and Vivekananda Parvatiya Krishi Anusandhan Sanstha in Almora had modified their seed varieties but ""the new varieties they give haven't worked for most, so people avoid them.""Like Jhardargaon in Garhwal, Gallakot village in the state's Kumaon region is also famous for its seed diversity. A steep hike within sight of Ranikhet hills brings you to the farm of 75-year-old Dayanand Joshi who grows several varieties of mandwa, jhungar or koni (millets), amaranth, a number of dals and vegetables. In 1962, he bred a radish variety that can weigh up to 15kg and tastes better than the commercial variety. His attempt to patent it was thwarted by the Protection of Plant Varieties and Farmers Rights Authority (PPFRA). ""They said they don't cover minor crops like radish.""Dayanand with RadishJoshi also cultivates a 100-year-old okra variety. His seeds have travelled to the eastern Himalayas too with visiting farmers from Sikkim and West Bengal. ""It's important for us not to give in to pressures from corporations because we farmers have seeds for all seasons and no matter how badly you sow them, they will come up,"" he said.The National Biodiversity Authority (NBA) and the Uttarakhand Biodiversity Board have not commented so far on how GM crops will affect agro-biodiversity, especially in ecologically sensitive areas like the Himalayas. Off the record, an official told TOI: ""GMOs are prohibited. Communities can take a call. The Cartagena protocol is there, and the state biodiversity board can advise against it.""Farmers want the government to support traditional crops like millets and pulses by including them in the public distribution system (PDS) and the integrated child development services (ICDS). ""Our government promised to supply them in PDS but there is no purchase mechanism, while Karnataka is already doing it,"" said Ajay Rastogi, agriculture expert who works with farmers here. ""The minimum support price (MSP) mechanism is for selected crops and it is based on quantity, not quality. If Jhungar has far more protein than wheat, shouldn't it fetch a higher price?""(The story was produced with support of the Earth Journalism Network and the Arcadia Fund)"
5a0534449855b76bf13c01ad,Why agriculture matters: An irony,http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/why-agriculture-matters-an-irony-4694780/,2017-06-08,"The reason why agriculture cannot be the dominant source of livelihood is that levels of productivity and hence living standards can never approach. The reason why agriculture cannot be the dominant source of livelihood is that levels of productivity and hence living standards can never approach.The reasons that agriculture matters are well-known: it provides sustenance to so many, food to all, and employment to many. In addition to these intrinsic positive reasons to invest in agriculture, there are other instrumental reasons: poor agricultural performance can lead to inflation, political and social disaffection, and restiveness all of which can hold back the economy. There are intrinsic as well as instrumental reasons for prioritising agriculture.But we must be clear and honest about one important link. The Nobel Prize winner, Sir Arthur Lewis, showed that economic development is always and everywhere about getting people out of agriculture and of agriculture becoming over time a less important part of the economy (not in absolute terms but as a share of GDP). But this must happen along with rapid productivity growth, ensuring rising farm incomes and adequate food supplies for the people. The reason why agriculture cannot be the dominant source of livelihood is that levels of productivity and hence living standards can never approach and have historically never approached those in manufacturing and services. That, of course, means that we must get our industrialization and urbanization right for the alternatives toagriculture to become meaningful, prosperous alternatives.When Dr. Ambedkar, famously derided the village as ?a sink of localism, a den of ignorance, narrow mindedness and communalism,? he was perhaps on to a deeper truth an Indian social complement to the Lewisian economic insight that in the long run people need to move and be moved out of agriculture. Dr. Ambedkar was warning about the patronization of agriculture masquerading as a romanticization of rural India.So the irony is this: we must care deeply about farmers and agriculture today because we want there to be fewer but more productive and prosperous farms and farmers tomorrow. In other words, all good and successful development is about facilitating this transition in the context of a prosperous agriculture and of rising productivity in agriculture not least because that will facilitate good urbanization and rising productivity in other sectors of the economy.So, today, I am going to provoke to force us all into collective self-reflection on the state of agriculture and its future. It is easy for me or for anyone  to list 10 or 20 different things that need to be done to improve our agricultural performance: stem the deterioration in agricultural research, educational, and extension institutions, improve resilience, incentivize drip irrigation, etc. But it is as easy to list them as it is perhaps useless. Because for any improvement or reform that all the experts recommend, we have to ask the simple question: ?If that is so obviously good for agriculture why hasnt it happened already? Or, put differently, ?What it is about today that will make these proposals successful when they have demonstratively failed to persuade in the past?Rather, I want to ask a question or tentatively pose a hypothesis: is it possible that we actually love some crops (cereals) and their farmers too much and, for all the pious professions and mythologizing, and other crops and their farmers not enough. To put it more bluntly, perhaps we are now smothering cereals with too much government support and other cropspulses, dairy, oilseeds, livestock, and fruits and vegetablesnot enough?The SuccessesBefore I elaborate on the main themes of my talk today, I would like to take stock of our achievements and shortcomings in agriculture. Given where we began in 1947, Indian agriculture has come a long way. We have achieved food security  at least on the major crops; rural poverty rates have declined substantially; agricultural incomes have risen; nutrition levels have risen.In terms of successes, I would highlight the following: The green revolution transformed Indian agriculture by increasing yields of wheat and rice, especially in Northern and then in Southern India. Credit here goes to international research but perhaps even more so to Indian scientists, agronomists and researchers, extension workers in public institutions that completed the link from technology to actual farm output.The white revolution that transformed the Indian dairy sector, increasing milk production, reducing dependence on imports, creating vibrant and participating institutional structures on agriculture and founding a vibrant consumer goods industry based on diary. Credit here goes, of course, to Dr. Kurien, leader of the Kheda Cooperative movement, and enlightened leadership of the NDDB. In addition to these sectoral successes, there have been, other regional achievements cotton in Gujarat, Maize in Bihar, Sugar in Uttar Pradesh, wheat in Madhya Pradesh, potatoes in West Bengal.Smothering with love: Cereal-CentricityThink of how and how much we support cereal and especially rice production. They are too numerous to exhaustively enumerate. The government helps the farmers through policies that affect the prices of outputs and inputs; through schemes and through institutions. We provide minimum support prices to farmers and the benefits accrue mainly to farmers who produce marketable output and that too mostly in cereals and wheat, which in turn is confined largely to a few States, notably in the North (Punjab and Haryana).We then provide subsidies for power, water, fertilizer (now the second largest subsidy), seeds, credit, we exempt agricultural income from income taxes, and we periodically grant loan waivers. The figure above shows how clearly agricultural incomes in Punjab and Haryana exceed those in the rest of India to get a sense of this biased smothering with love.Smothering with love: Big not Small FarmersThere is a second aspect to this smothering with love: not only does it mainly benefit the cereal farmers, it also tends to favour larger farmers, or at least it does not adequately reach the smaller farmer. Several examples: by definition, the exemption of agricultural income from tax favours those with larger incomes. In fertilizer, we estimated in the Economic Survey that only about one-third of the total subsidy went to small and marginal farmers. On agricultural credit, there is now growing evidence that not all of this goes to farmers. On the loan waiver, it is surprising how little the small and marginal farmer borrow from formal financial institutions (less than 50%) and how much from informal sources, while the large farmer relies on formal sources to the extent of about 75%; on power, we estimated in the Economic Survey that the bottom quintile received about 10% of the total subsidy while the top quintal about 37% because of highly skewed electricity consumption.But is there something as loving too much? The experience of Punjab is perhaps suggestive. Thanks to support, incomes are high and amongst the highest but there is growing evidence that this is proving now to be counter-productive. Punjab has lost most of its earlier agricultural dynamism. Between 1971-72 and 1985-86, agricultural growth was 5.7% percent compared to the All-India number of 2.3 percent. Since 2005-06, its average agricultural growth has declined to 1.6% compared to Indias 3.5%.One can hazard that Punjabs dynamism will only be restored if it weans itself off its agriculture that has taken a toll of its water resources, soil quality, and human health (refer to cancer district). Its fading dynamism may be in part due to the excessive support that its agriculture receives.Loving Too LittleIf we love some crops too much, perhaps we love many of the others too little. I have in mind here pulses, dairy and livestock, fruits and vegetables, and oilseeds. How do we love them too little? In the case of pulses, commendable efforts have been made to increase procurement at MSP (MSP without procurement, it must be emphasized, offers little comfort for farmers) and this Kharif season there was indeed a substantial increase to 2 million (out of a total output of 8.7 million). Despite this, it is estimated that about 60% of the record Tur output was sold at less than MSP, resulting in depressed income. Stock limits and export restrictions kept market prices low; had they been eased the fortunes of farmers would have been better.I think we misunderstand an important economic insight here that we highlighted in the pulses report. Some of the loving-too-little occurs because of the perception of a tension between farmer and powerful middle-class consumer interests. This leads to a response that creates policy volatility and pro-cyclicality, which increases price uncertainty for farmers: so when prices go up, export restrictions are imposed, and when prices decline, import restrictions are imposed and so on. But this perception and the consequent policy action do not adequately recogonize a fundamental alignment of interests. Lower farmer prices today will adversely affect future agricultural supplies (especially in crops that are predominantly produced domestically such as pulses, fruits and vegetables) which will increase consumer prices tomorrow. So, even over reasonable planning and political horizons, what is good for the farmer is good for the consumer.On fruits and vegetables, restrictions on selling imposed via APMCs are perhaps taking a toll. The government has created an electronic common market and the results are awaited. On dairy and livestock, two points are worth emphasizing. Governments have the right to choose their social policies. But in doing so they must be fully aware of the economic costs of these policies. If social policies impede the workings of the livestock market, the impact on the economics of livestock farming could be considerable. These must be costed for appropriate choices to be made.Second, it must be recognized that the economics of livestock farming, and hence the fate and future of this source of livelihood will depend critically on the terminal value of assets, in this case the no-longer-productive livestock. If social policies drive this terminal value precipitously down, private returns could be affected in a manner that could make livestock farming less profitable (and recent research by Anagol, Etang and Karlan (2013)NBER Working paper No. 19437suggests that returns to livestock farming are in any case very low and even negative) . This declining terminal value arises both because of the loss of income from livestock as meat and the additional costs that will arise from having to maintain unproductive livestock. But there is more. It is possible that social policies could affect social returns even more adversely. Stray cattle, and a lot of it, will have to be looked after, otherwise diseases (foot and mouth) could spread, leading to health hazards and social costs.(Let me add as an aside that responding to changing consumer preference for proteins, which Indians under-consume to the detriment of their health, needs both reduced cereal-centricity, and at the same time promotingnot hindering alternative sources of protein from pulses, dairy and livestock). Finally, there is technology that again is especially important for pulses, oil seeds and dairy. Harish Damodaran of the Indian Express has written persuasively about the choices we face on GM. To paraphrase him, it seems that the patronization of farmers masquerading as romanticization is rife.This must be addressed rationally even beyond mustard. If we want farmers to benefit from new technology we must allow them these benefits regardless of the provenance of the technologies just as we do in other sectors. Expropriating property rights retroactively and undermining sanctity of contracts as sought by voices on opposing ends of the ideological spectrum could impede the flow of technology and thus end up hurting not helping farmers. To be sure, we must absolutely ensure that there is no abuse of patent rights or other monopolistic practices but the right instruments must be chosen; moreover, there must always be an underlying cost-benefit analysis but an analysis as farmers themselves would do it rather than as how the analysis might be done for them.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd"

PTI photo Jaitley, Hasmukh Adhia at the GST Council meeting in New Delhi on Sunday. PTI photoThe Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council Sunday revised downward tax rates for 66 items including movie tickets of Rs 100 and below, incense sticks, insulin, school bags, computer printers  133 items were considered for review at the sixteenth meeting of the Council. Relief was also given to small and medium enterprises, with the threshold for composition scheme raised to Rs 75 lakh from the earlier decided level of Rs 50 lakh.The composition scheme, with a flat 1 per cent tax rate for traders, 2 per cent for manufacturers and 5 per cent for restaurants with a cut-off of annual turnover of up to Rs 50 lakh, provides for a simpler method of calculating tax liability for registered dealers with turnover below the compounding cut-off to reduce the administration cost associated with collection of tax from small traders. However, those who opt for the scheme will not be eligible for input tax credit.Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said the revision in GST rates was considered after receiving several representations from trade and industry.The objective was to maintain equivalence to the existing taxation level and, in some cases, the fitment committees recommendation went beyond the equivalence principle. Because some items have been historically charged at a higher rate but today, in the changed economic concept, the burden requires to be reduced. So, after considering the recommendations, the GST Council has reduced the tax levels in 66 out of 133 cases, he said.There were two objectives behind this. One, we tried to maintain revenue neutrality to the extent possible because this can also mean some loss of revenue but it eases the burden on SMEs and small traders, restaurants. And it also reduces the burden on these three categories because these are mass job creators. So that is why, after detailed discussions, this (threshold for composition scheme) was increased to Rs 75 lakh, he said.On the targeted date for GST rollout, officials said July 1 date stays.Irrespective of the date on which it starts, some people will say they are not ready, so they have no option but to get ready, Jaitley said when he was asked about some traders protesting against the July 1 rollout date.West Bengal Finance Minister Amit Mitra said: July 1 looks extremely difficult. But you cannot be doing jugaad for the worlds largest fiscal reform called GST. Small businesses have to fill up spreadsheets which then has to go through a software process to get uplinked so let us be sure, Mahabharat ashuddh nahi ho jayega if you postpone by one month or so.The tax rate on certain packaged food items like pickles, mustard sauce, murabba, ketchup has been reduced to 12 per cent from the earlier decided 18 per cent, while that on cashew nuts has been cut to 5 per cent from 12 per cent.The GST rate for entertainment has been split into two categories, with movie tickets below Rs 100 now proposed to be taxed at 18 per cent, while those above will continue to be taxed at 28 per cent.The Council also exempted childrens picture, drawing books from 12 per cent proposed earlier, while lowering that for computer printers to 18 per cent from 28 per cent.School bags will attract tax of 18 per cent as against 28 per cent proposed earlier. Tax rate on kajal has been lowered to 18 per cent from 28 per cent. The GST rate on cutlery has been reduced to 12 per cent from 18 per cent, while that for some tractor components, plastic beads and plastic tarpaulins has been cut to 18 per cent from 28 per cent.Also, the tax rate for job work for textiles, diamond processing, leather, jewellery and printing was reduced to 5 per cent from 18 per cent. These are items where job workers typically take the work home, and work on textile or diamond processing or jewellery work. Now the normal GST rate for these services is 18 per cent but because in these sectors the rate itself has been reduced, for job work in these sectors the rate has been fixed at 5 per cent, so that outsourcing through job work in these sectors could be encouraged, Jaitley said.The draft rules for accounts and records were also approved at the meeting. The approved version of the rule has done away with the need for a registered person to provide, on demand, account of the audit trail and interlinkages including source document, record layout and explanation for codes used and total number of records in each field along with sample copies of documents as was proposed earlier.The next meeting of the Council will be on June 18, which will take up lottery taxes and e-way bill and any other issue which may come up, Jaitley said.On the issue of review of GST rate on hybrid cars, a detailed paper will be circulated and, after taking comments from states, it will be taken up by the Council later, if necessary, Jaitley said.For all the latest Business News, download Indian Express App"
5a05cfff9855b76bf13c1106,Modified approaches,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170628/jsp/opinion/story_158981.jsp,2017-06-28,"The Central biotech regulator, the Genetic Engineering Approval Committee has recommended the commercial use of genetically modified or GM mustard after much deliberation and several rounds of field trials. It is believed that GM mustard would be beneficial for agricultural growth in the country and would end India's dependence on other countries for the import of edible oil. At present, India imports edible oil worth 11 million dollars, nearly one-third of what the country gains by exporting agricultural commodities. After three years of deliberation, the biotech regulator has agreed to its limited use for commercial purposes from the coming rabi season. GM mustard seeds have been developed in an Indian laboratory and by a group of scientists from the Delhi University, which makes it a truly desi product. The project was funded by two national organizations, the National Dairy Development Board (the largest producer and supplier of the Dhara brand of oil) and the government's department of biotechnology. The idea behind this new project was to make the country self-reliant in mustard oil production. Countries like the United States of America, Brazil, Argentina, China and others are using GM seeds for the production of maize, soya bean, cotton, canola, papaya and paddy. In the US, 72.9 million hectares of land are being used for the production of GM crops. Brazil is using roughly 49 million hectares of land. At present, India is trying out only with BT cotton in 10.8 million hectares. Because of stiff opposition from activists, the introduction of BT brinjal was stalled in 2010. Since 2013, GM mustard has been opposed by activists on the ground that the new seeds can pose serious scientific and technical challenges to farmers, besides causing environmental degradation and health hazards. Activists allege that no attempt has been made to share field trial data with the farmers. The Supreme Court will have to take a call on this contentious issue in the coming months. Before the new seeds cause another spate of farmers' suicides something needs to be done. The GM mustard seeds have been opposed on other counts too. Aruna Rodrigues, an activist, argued that the Centre's preliminary clearance to GM mustard, named Dhara Mustard Hybrid-11 (DMH-11), contravenes a 2013 report by a Supreme Court-appointed technical expert committee. This committee had said, among other things, that herbicide-tolerant crops ought not to be permitted in India. One of the genes in DMH-11, developed by researchers, contains 'bar' that makes it herbicide tolerant. This makes plants resistant to a class of insecticide containing the chemical, glufosinate. After the disastrous consequences of using BT cotton seeds in Vidarbha, Maharashtra and other parts of the country, questions are being raised about the efficacy of GM mustard. Initially, in the 1990s, BT cotton seeds were imported in a clandestine manner bypassing all checks and control by government agencies. The farmers were told by the agents of the wholesale dealers that BT cotton output would ensure a quantum jump in the cotton production. The cost of production of the new crop was three to four times higher, farmers had to borrow money at a high rate of interest from moneylenders. After sowing, they waited, only to find insecticides destroying the cotton fields. The disaster led to a large number of farmers' suicides. In the early 1990s, nearly one thousand farmers committed suicide by consuming pesticide in Maharashtra alone. Why did the farmers use new genetically modified BT cotton seeds of the multinational company called Monsanto in the 1990s? One answer to this question is that they took the risk because they had gained some kind of confidence in using new seeds after the successful introduction of high yielding varieties and various other inputs during the Green Revolution. Moreover, different types of HYV seeds were also introduced by the Indian agricultural research institutes with which farmers had no problems. However, the simple narratives of risk and trust fell apart when BT cotton seeds were introduced: the new seeds gave farmers a nightmare and within a short time cotton cultivation with the new seeds was abandoned in many parts of the country. Other problems aggravated the crises in Maharashtra, like adulterated and spurious inputs, lopsided flow of institutional credits and indebtedness, the mismatch between the expected and actual yield of cotton, the breakdown of the joint family system, ecological factors like soil degradation owing to the excessive use of chemicals and fertilizers. The factors worked in a complicated way in leading to suicides. However, the Green Revolution made scientific knowledge popular among farmers. Agricultural innovations with new HYV seeds has changed the contours of local knowledge about farming in the last five decades. Science made inroads into the world of local knowledge in remote areas in agriculturally backward states like Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan. The triumph of science over traditional techniques of cultivation helped farmers gain trust in new discoveries, especially in seeds, fertilizers and pesticides. Constant interaction between agricultural scientists and farmers made it easier to spread Green Revolution technology. Agricultural scientists made it a point to ensure that farmers became important stakeholders in spreading this in rural areas; frequent field trials by agricultural scientists helped bridge the gap between scientists and farmers. The disaster in Vidarbha has broken the trust that farmers gained after the Green Revolution and it has allowed local knowledge to regain lost ground. Indian agriculture would hardly benefit if scientific knowledge does not percolate down to the villages. Science has an important role to play in augmenting agricultural production and from this point of view new seeds or GM crops can fulfil two primary objectives: first, they can increase food production and second, they can make India self-sufficient in producing edible oil and cotton. In order to fulfil these two broader objectives, science has to reach those who till the land. But this is not happening with GM seeds; farmers are being ignored by the State and by scientists. Before introducing GM mustard, it would be necessary to involve farmers, the main stakeholders, in this new venture. In many parts of India, farmers are well-organized; they are controlled either by unions or by their caste associations. Sometimes they join hands without taking support from unions or caste associations as is the case in the present farmers' agitation in Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra. In West Bengal, the Left Front paid a heavy price for not consulting peasants before land acquisition in Singur and Nandigram. A spontaneous agrarian struggle forced the state government to abandon land acquisition. On a contentious issue like the introduction of GM crops, farmers should get an opportunity to express their opinion. After all they are the main stakeholders, they must be heard."

Anti-GM activists were perturbed in the past that the State was relatively mute to the Centres move. This was attributed to the fact that mustard was not a major crop in Karnataka. The delegation was led by activists Mallesh, Maj. Gen Sudhir Vombatkere (retd) of National Alliance of Peoples Movement, eco-educationist Tanuja, Krishna Prasad of Sahaja Samruddha, and Pushpavathi Amarnath, former Mysuru Zilla Panchayat president.Mr. Siddaramaiah was informed that Bihar, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, and Delhi governments had already written to the Centre opposing the move, while mustard-growing States, including BJP-ruled Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, had also spelt out their stance against commercialisation of GM mustard."

He said there are three berths to be filled in the cabinet and it would be done after holding talks with All India Congress Committee president Sonia Gandhi and vice-president Rahul Gandhi.Speaking to media persons here on Sunday, Siddaramaiah said he has not held talks on cabinet expansion so far and clarified that the delay in cabinet expansion is not because of Ashada, (believed to be an inauspicious time).Asked about the corruption charges against prison officials, he made it clear that government will not tolerate indiscipline in the police force. Expressing displeasure over the officials talking to the media, he said the government has ordered an inquiry into the alleged irregularities and assured that they would act tough if the charges are proved.Siddu to write to Centre against GM mustardSiddaramaiah has promised a delegation of GM-free Karnataka Forum that he will write to the Centre against the approval of genetically modified mustard for commercial cultivation.The group met him on Saturday and briefed him about the potential adverse impacts of GM mustard.Bihar, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal and Delhi governments have already written to the Centre, while a large mustard growing states, including BJP-ruled ones like Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, have spelt out their stand against commercialisation of GM mustard. Kerala went a step further and passed a unanimous resolution in the Assembly against GM mustard. The Karnataka government should also take a decision over GM mustard, said the delegates of the forum.Senior socialist leader Pa Mallesh, who led the delegation, explained that at a time when farm livelihoods were already struggling with an acute crisis, it is completely wrong on the part of the Centre to try and bring in a risky and irreversible technology."
5a0b70419855b76bf13cf4f6,Grappling to survive,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/grappling-to-survive/articleshow/59706793.cms,2017-07-22,"Only six mud-pit akhadas remain in Kolkata, which once used to be a major centre of kushti. Now, there's very little support for the traditional sport, since the focus is on Oympics-rules wrestling reports, straight from the dangal sidelines Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose , Benoy, Badal and Dinesh used to regularly come here, and this place was a regular haunt of freedom fightersNone other than the great Dara Singh used to come here and practice in the mud pits, along with famous pehlwans like Anta Pehlwan, Baru Pehlwan, Bhagwandas Pehlwan and Basantu Pehlwan; this was the meeting place of legendsSuch stories  maybe apocryphal, maybe not, who knows  are common in the dark and dank kushti akhadas of Kolkata, where the smell of sweat on glistening, muscled bodies becomes inseparable from the aroma of freshly dug earth, and where harsh realities are woven with the stuff of legend. Kolkata, even two decades ago, used to be the centre of traditional kushti, with pehlwans from all over the world making a beeline to its akhadas to participate in high-voltage dangals (kushti competitions).Today, only six mud-pit akhadas survive, all located within a two-kilometre radius of Burrabazar. Save for three of these, where mud wrestling still happens, the others are almost gone, save for the one day of the year  Nagpanchami  when all six of them come alive. Traditionally, Nagpanchami is the day when dangals are organized in akhadas all over the country, and the ones here are no exception. From the early hours of July 27, you will get to see a ringside view of pehlwans grappling with and pinning each other down in rare 'dav-pench' grips, that will definitely bring back flashes of the Aamir Khan-starrer that stirred imaginations even as far as distant China. Only, this is not reel life, but as real as it gets.Times have changed, rue practitioners of this traditional sport. Today's generation feels mud-wrestling is a colossal waste of time, an unfashionable option for keeping fit. A large number of akhadas, thus, have turned into gyms where young boys go for weight training. And there's a very tangible class difference: the more money you have, the fancier the gym you go to.The very few senior pehlwans who still cannot do without their morning and evening regimen of mud-wrestling, say that in the heydays of kushti, such class distinctions did not exist. North Kolkata was home to the rich gentry and the young scions of the most powerful families like the Tagores, Debs, Lahas, Mitras and Mullicks got trained under the akhada pehlwans. While pehlwans mostly visited their homes, it was not uncommon to see the nobility in horse-drawn carriages and, later, in motor cars, waiting outside akhadas for training sessions and also competitions. Keeping fit through wrestling was a part of the rich man's daily regimen and there are many stories about Rabindranath himself and his brothers, Swami Vivekananda and, later, Netaji and other freedom fighters being avid wrestlers. Gobor Goho, a traditional wrestler in the first decades of the 20th century in Kolkata, stunned the world when he became the first Asian to win the World Light Heavyweight Championship in the US in 1921. The mud-pit akhada that Goho used was set up by his great-grandfather at Masjidbari Street, which still exists and is maintained by the family.Cotton Street is a nondescript narrow lane, dark and dingy, not comfortable for a four-wheeler. But you will be surprised when you have crossed the threshold of the centuries old building at 126, Cotton Street and come face-to-face with one of the oldest akhadas of the country, maintained by the Yoganand Puri Math. Kushti practice starts here from as early as 4.30am and interestingly, most of those who come for their daily dose of exercise are pehlwans in their late 60s and 70s. Bhagwandas Kewat (72), a pehlwan from Varanasi, is a case in point. He is the seniormost guru here, who will tell you of the many wrestlers he has trained all his life. ""Today, very few akhadas with mud pits are left. It is a dying tradition. Those who are still becoming wrestlers are joining the different clubs where they can learn on mats, following Olympics rules. So we are being forced to send our best boys for training on the mat in clubs,"" he says. Bhagwandas shuttles between Varanasi and Kolkata and is often called to referee in the traditional wrestling circuits of Delhi, Haryana and UP, where mud wrestling competitions are still extremely popular in rural areas.The site is home to hectic activity as the pit is being prepared for the big occasion on Nagpanchami. Ganga mitti is being brought in and mixed with the existing mud that has been turned in to make it supple yet firm, just the right consistency for mud-wrestling, so that one doesn't slip and fall while taking position. There is a ratio of water, milk, red ochre, multani mitti, buttermilk, mustard oil, sandal powder, ghee, neem leaves and flower petals that are mixed into this mud to prepare it for competitions. One sees the 24-year-old Raja Singh, who has joined hands with the others at the akhada to prepare the soil, since pehlwans do this work themselves as labourers are not allowed to enter the ring.Raja is a state-level wrestling champion and trains on the mat at a nearby club at Jorabagan, registered with the West Bengal Olympic Wrestling Association. ""We also have Rohit Singh, who is the national No. 4 now. We are happy that these talented pehlwans have not left mud-wrestling. But since there is no patronage or recognition for us in Bengal, we will not survive very long. Elsewhere in north India, though we are not allowed to send mud wrestlers for state/national championships, there is no dearth of local competitions and adulation that keep us, the traditional pehlwans, alive,"" says aide Manoj Sonkar, the akhada's caretaker.Adjacent to Tarasundari Park, not too far from here, is the Arjun Vyayamshaala, named after the legendary pehlwan Arjun Singh, who was a freedom fighter and was known to have been close to Netaji. Arjun Pehlwan of the Benaras gharana has gone down in history for leading freedom fighters against the Simon Commission in 1928. The akhada was frequented by freedom fighters and Netaji's name features on top of the list along with that of Benoy, Badal and Dinesh. ""We maintain the mud pit ourselves and are all set for Nagpanchami. At least 50 pehlwans have already confirmed participation and we will have drums and desi-style cymbals, along with pipes playing full throttle as the pehlwans go for their choicest dao-pench. In traditional kushti, we have barilla dao, kainchia dao, kanpattiya dao and then the very challenging dhobi pachhad,"" says Hanuman Pehlwan, the guru of the akhada, showing off his 48-inch chest which, he says, was the result of a daily rigorous routine of five hours of kushti.Ask anyone near Machhua who Nandu Paanwala is, and you will be led to this 72-year-old man with a smiling face, lacing one paan after another with lime and supari, as his customers keep swelling around his perch. One look at him will tell you that he is a wrestler, and he is very pleased to talk about kushti, keeping aside paan, his other love. At 4.30am, you will find him wrestling his mate, Jwala Pehlwan, on the banks of the Hooghly at the mud pit of Mullickghat, or the Jagannath Ghat flower market. The Siyaram Akhara has been here for the past 60 years, but before that, it has existed at Burrabazar's Dhakaputty since the late 18th century. The akhada is associated with famous names in pehlwani like Nathmal Parikh and Siyaram Pehlwan, and has seen traditional wrestlers like Bansi Singh of Chhapra, Puransingh of Punjab, Baramdeb Mishra of Gorakhpur come and practice regularly. Jwala Pehlwan stays in rooms adjacent to the akhada on the ghat itself and opens the pit with a daily puja before dawn. He hails from Gorakhpur, which remains one of the country's major kushti hubs. Jwala cannot stand the comparison between traditional and competitive wrestling. ""Mud wrestling is India's original strength. The state and the Centre should have patronized it at the competitive level. Instead, it is just the Olympics-approved mat wrestling that is being promoted. There is no reason to think that mud wrestlers do not have the skill for mat wrestling. There is just a slight difference in technique, because while in mud pits the winner has to pin down the opponent holding his back flat on the mud, in case of mat wrestling the winner has to win points on every move as he advances towards the finish,"" Jwala explains.So is he, an ace mud wrestler, able to perform on the mat? ""Of course I can. Between 1991 and 2000, I was the Bengal champion in the 74kg, 85kg, 82kg and 97kg categories. In the national circuit, I have won against BSF and CRPF,"" says Jwala, who is in his late 60s. ""The idea is to learn the technique on mud, gain strength there and then practise the acquired skill on the mat. I did it myself and made my son do it too,"" he adds. Suraj Kant Tewari has been Bengal champion from the time he competed in the 30kg championship to the time he went on to be 62kg, and ranks fourth nationally.The mud-pit akhadas are crying out for support and recognition that is hard to come by at a time when even competitive wrestling is finding it difficult to get patronage and state support. ""Five years ago, we were promised state recognition that would have got us special grants from the Sports Authority of India (SAI). But it is yet to come,"" rues Asit Saha, former national-level wrestler and secretary of Panchanan Byayam Samity, a 150-year-old club at Jorabagan, which switched over to mat wrestling decades ago, to enter the national and international competition circuit following Olympic norms. Today, young wrestlers who might have started out at traditional akhadas but want to take up career wrestling come to this club to practice and learn the skills required to wrestle on the mat. ""Below our expensive mat, we still have the mud arena. But it is of no use today because we would have also met with a slow death had we not changed,"" Saha says. He belongs to a family of wrestlers that produced names like Sudhir Chandra Saha, the chief coach of the country at the Tokyo Olympics. Saha himself remained a state champion for 14 years uninterrupted and won silver in the national circuit and later trained as a coach from Iran.The club doubles up as the West Bengal Wrestling Association, recognized by SAI, and has won 36 golds in national championships till date, apart from its biggest achievement  sending wrestlers K P Roy and Niranjan Das to the 1948 and 1952 Olympics. ""Mud akhadas are our tradition, but its style is distinctly different from the demands of the Olympics, which had laid out its mat rules way back in 1804. A person trained on the mud pit might have great skills but tends to lose grip on the mat. We have time limits and points attached to specific moves  pinning down the opponent gets you four points, getting him down with knees on the ground gets you two points and 'suplex' gets you a full five. Traditional wrestlers have to get used to the Greco-Roman style,"" he explains. Pehlwans pooh-pooh this, pointing out that they too have their inimitable dao-pench like the barilla dao, kainchia dao, kanpattiya dao and finally the dhobi pachhad, where the winner picks the opponent up and smashes him on the mud.While crisis has hit the mud akhadas of Bengal, the scene is quite different in rural north India, where dangals are organized as weekend entertainment and a lot of money spins around it which, in turn, helps keep both pehlwans and akhadas in good shape. ""I have been scouring akhadas in Haryana and UP to find out new ways to run and maintain our heritage mud akhada,"" says Indroneel Goho, Gobor Goho's grandson. The akhada that this family owns, off Beadon Street, is perhaps the best maintained mud akhada of the city, but Goho rues that though it has been churning out wrestlers, they are not able to enter state- or national-level championships because of lack of mat training.""Perhaps we need to modernize a bit, without breaking off with our heritage/tradition,"" Goho says."

""But, look at the cost and output. Organic vegetables, grains or fruits are not for the poor. It is the rich man's food. After investing so much, the yield is not enough to feed the whole country.""But if technology is used in farming, then the use of pesticides too will reduce, he said. ""GM crops too are pesticide-free. Look at Bt cotton, not only the technology has helped us tackle the problem of bollworms but also increased the yield. The size of flower is increased,"" Sesikeran said.Sesikeran said in every technology there is a risk and we need a plan to manage it. ""The government should have made a risk management plan. If I tell you how harmful the cellular radiation is, will you stop using mobile? No. You may adopt preventive measures. Similarly, such concerns have to be factored in and solutions found instead of banning a technology,"" he said."

Andhra Pradesh is the tenth State to oppose GM mustard. Despite being an important NDA ally, Telugu Desam Party (TDP) government said that several farmer unions in the State have approached it opposing the commercialisation. Bihar, Delhi, Kerala, TN, West Bengal, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka and Odisha have already expressed their reservations on the issue.As this is the first GM food crop that has reached this stage after Bt Brinjal, we would like to share our serious concerns about GM mustard. This has been a subject of serious discussion in the State, and several farmer unions have approached us with objections. The fact that the biosafety data of the three GM mustard lines has not been published and that adequate time has not been given for public response has been a matter of concern, said Naidu in his August 10 letter to Union Environment Minister Harsh Vardhan.Requesting the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change not to approve GM mustard for commercialisation. Naidu said, Further, we would like to state that it is not a practical approach to say that even after approval by the Government of India, each State can decide whether to allow the cultivation of the GM crop because once commercialisation is allowed it would be very difficult for State governments to regulate whether the seed is used in their states.The State has undertaken a large programme to develop natural farming. We believe that this is the best way forward for ensuring better incomes for farmers as well as sustaining soil fertility, crop diversity and cattle wealth. The reality is that genetically modified crops and organic farming cannot be compatible with each other. Allowing GM crops will seriously affect Indias status as a potential giant in organic food production, said Naidu. The State has expressed serious reservations over field trials of GM crops."
5a14c07a9855b76bf13e77ee,Mapping the not-so-normal monsoon,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/mapping-the-not-so-normal-monsoon/article19825298.ece,2017-10-09,"If youre statistically inclined, you may be celebrating the fact that the south-west monsoon for 2017, which is now bowing out, has turned out to be normal for the second consecutive year. But farmers know that there can be many shades of grey to an officially normal monsoon.Another bumper year?India has received a total 841.3 millimetres (mm) of rain in the south-west monsoon season from June 1 to September 30 this year.IMD deems the season normal if the all-India quantum of rain falls within a 10% range of its long-period average of 887.5 mm. The 2017 monsoon fell short of the number only by 5%. In fact, the cumulative rainfall numbers this year arent very different from 2016 when the country recorded 862 mm of rain. This may seem like good news. In 2016-17, India harvested a record crop of cereals (252.7 million tonnes) and managed a quantum jump in its output of both pulses (16.3 million tonnes in 2015 to 22.9 million tonnes in 2016) and oilseeds (25 to 32 million tonnes). This contributed to a significant bump-up in the agriculture leg of the GDP which grew 4.9% in FY17 compared with 0.7% in FY16.But expecting an encore of that impressive performance just because this years monsoon has turned out normal, would be unrealistic. More than the quantum of rainfall that is dumped on the sub-continent during the four critical months, it is the spatial and temporal distribution of rains that make or break crop prospects. On this score, the 2017 monsoon has been quite whimsical.Patchy distributionFor the purposes of measuring the spatial spread of rainfall, the IMD categorises India into 36 meteorological sub-divisions.IMDs wrap-up of the recent monsoon season tells us that in the just-concluded monsoon season, 5 of Indias 36 sub-divisions received excess rains, 25 received normal rains and 6 witnessed deficient rains. Last year, 4 sub-divisions were showered with excess rains, 23 were normal and 9 were deficient.But the devil really lies in the details and the identity of the States that suffered deficient rains really matter to crop prospects. This years monsoon has played truant in some key food-bowl States. For instance, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh and Punjab account for a lions share of kharif rice production. But this years monsoon has been 29% below normal in Uttar Pradesh and 22% short of normal in Punjab. West Bengal alone has enjoyed a near-normal season, as has much of the southern peninsula. Madhya Pradesh, which is a critical growing region for the rabi wheat crop, has seen a deficiency of 20%.Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Maharashtra are similarly critical for pulses output. Of these, while Rajasthan has received excess rains (8% above normal) and Maharashtra has been just about normal, rains playing truant in Madhya Pradesh look set to impact pulses output.While excess rains in Gujarat (19% above normal) could augur well for the groundnut and cotton crops, the patchy show in both Madhya Pradesh and Haryana (26% below normal) cloud the prospects for oilseeds such as soyabean, rapeseed, mustard and sunflower. There have also been wide variations between growing regions within each state, which can have a bearing on crop prospects.Weak endingMonth-wise rainfall patterns during the south-west monsoon also play a big role in deciding cropping area and yield. In 2016, the monsoon got off to a snail-paced start, but picked up pace in the latter half of the season.But this years monsoon has behaved in exactly the opposite fashion. After excess rains of about 4% and 2% against normal seasonal patterns in June and July, the months of August and September have seen all-India rainfall fall 12-13% short of normal levels. Good rains in the months of June and July may have contributed to good sowing and coverage of the kharif crops. But deficit rains in August and September could impact the eventual output by pruning crop yields.It is also important to note that rainfall in the last two months of the south-west monsoon dictate reservoir storage and soil moisture, both of which set the tone for the planting of the winter crops. Though there is much tracking and analysis of Indias south-west monsoon and the kharif crop, the rabi season has been equally important to the countrys agricultural prospects in recent years. Rabi output often matches or even exceeds the kharif output.The rabi season accounts for the whole of Indias wheat and gram harvest, a fourth of the output for coarse cereals and chips in with over a third of the yearly harvest of urad and moong. Oilseeds such as rapeseed and mustard, sunflower and safflower are also predominantly winter crops. Therefore, dry spells in the latter half of this monsoon, taken with deficient rains in key rabi growing regions, can make for less than rosy rabi prospects.All this could explain why the agriculture ministry, in its First Advance Estimates, has painted a somewhat muted picture of crop prospects for FY18. The estimates are based mainly on cropping and sowing patterns and a lot can change on yields and output, as the year progresses. But so far, it appears as if India will have a hard time living up to the 4.9% expansion in agriculture GVA that it so comfortably managed last year."
5a0cf34c9855b76bf13d00b0,"No Money To Take Ailing Father To Kolkata, Son Cycles Him To A Quack",https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/no-money-to-take-ailing-father-to-kolkata-son-cycles-him-to-a-quack-1775557,2017-11-15,"Nitai Mondol's son was asked to take his ailing father to a local healer in West Bengal.In rural West Bengal, dead bodies are often carried wrapped in a blanket or a plastic sheet and put on a flat platform behind the driver's seat of a van rickshaw.So, when on the road from Deganga to Kolkata, a van rickshaw passed by with a body wrapped in a mustard coloured shawl, one almost did the automatic 'pronam' - touch the fingers to the forehead and heart - said a small prayer and moved on.But what was different about this van rickshaw, that passed by about 50 kms from Kolkata, was seated an exhausted looking woman who must have been beautiful at one time. The wife. And then there was a little boy, may be just four years old. A grandson.The man driving the motorised van rickshaw was a strapping youth of about 35.Meet the Mondol family of Malancha Kanimari, Police Station Sandeshkhali in North 24 Parganas, 100 kms from Kolkata.Nitai Mondal, 65 or so, is a fisherman who has tuberculosis of the lung and multiple other ailments and has not been able to work for years.His wife, Gita, 56, is in despair. They had taken him to a premier government-run Kolkata hospital, RG Kar, back in August. His malady was diagnosed, he was given medicine and asked to come back a month later for a check up.Nitai Mondal did not have the wherewithal to do that; nor his four sons and two daughters. But the family could not just sit back and watch him die. So, when friends told him to take Nitai babu to a goonin, or witch doctor, seen as a local healer, at Deganga thakurbari, he jumped to the idea.Or rather cycled to it. Nitai's 35-year-old son Dilip is a van-rickshaw driver. On Tuesday morning at 4 am, he put his father on the back of his motor-driven cycle can along with his mother and young son and headed to their destination, a 50-km ride that he accomplished in a record six hours.The audience with the goonin was brief. Nitai was given jol-tel (water and oil) and an amulet to help him recover. And then the family set off back home. 6 hours, 50 kilometres, with a catheter bag hanging out of Nitai's private parts.""We don't have anymore money to go to Calcutta for treatment,"" said Gita. ""We are already about Rs1 lakh in debt from friends and family. To go to RG Kar Hospital in Kolkata, we will have to hire a taxi, which is impossible. Going in a bus with my husband in his condition is impossible.""""We want my father to live but there is just so much we can do. Only the goonin can help us now,"" said Dilip, the son, resignation in his voice. His son sat listening and staring at his father.The situation couldn't be allowed. So the NDTV team called the police, went to the Deganga police station, organised an ambulance with police help to drop the family to Malancha.Dilip refused to go. He did not want to leave his van rickshaw - his only source of an uncertain income - behind. So Nitai, Gita and the little boy got on the ambulance and left with two civic volunteers that the police were kind enough to send along to ensure they reached safely.Dana Majhi's wife was dead when he carried her body on his back from a hospital in Odisha towards to his home to perform the last rites last year.Besides abject poverty, he is completely removed from all government programs on containing tuberculosis, an issue that the Centre has promised to focus on as well as increase spending, resources and manpower.The state government is a party to the TB eradication programs. There should be a district TB officer to contact Nitai Mondal and ensure his recovery. But that has clearly not happened.The quack's jol-tel, amulet and his belief in them will help Nitai Mondal survive.But both the state and the Centre appear to have failed this frail old man."
