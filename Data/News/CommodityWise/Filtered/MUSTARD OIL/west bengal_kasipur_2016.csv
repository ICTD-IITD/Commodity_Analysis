58f184fca3d24b245e59b03d,"Sea of poppies, hotbed of violence",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/Sea-of-poppies-hotbed-of-violence/articleshow/50661208.cms,2016-01-21,"MALDA: A fortnight after the Kaliachak violence where the police station was vandalised and torched on January 3, cops are convinced the planned attack was instigated by smugglers and illegal traders who thrive in the lawlessness at Kaliachak.While smuggling of fake currency and arms has been a big racket for years, the explosion in poppy cultivation has added to the illegal activities that abound in this place bordering Bangladesh.Grown by local farmers under the watchful eyes of the 'mafia', the poppy fields produce tonnes of opium.For Class VI student Ibrahim of Sahbajpur, carrying a container of concentrated opium resin known as atha (glue) in local parlance across the border fetches Rs 100, a princely sum for people residing in these border lands. Children like Ibrahim and women are used as carriers to smuggle opium across the border. Crossing over to Bangladesh in the morning and returning before sunset is a common practice.Finer products like heroin are carried back from there through Lalgola and Domkal. Around 750-800 gm of resin is required to produce 100 gm of heroin. The riches from the opium trade has reduced poverty.Ismail Sheikh of Golapgunj, a daily labourer till recently, has come into wealth and built a pucca house and bought a motorcycle. How? He took 1 bigha land on contract for a year and sowed poppy. ""Last October, we all took seeds of mustard or wheat but Ismail went for poppy. And we heard that he garnered over Rs 50,000 from the plot,"" said his neighbour Alim.Ismail's isn't the only rags to riches story. Thousands of farmers in Malda, Nadia and Murshidabad have found the short cut to success within three-four months, dumping the uncertainty over ravi crop to welcome offers from some 'foreigners'.Sabiruddin of Rejinagar recounted how the 'foreigner', Lakshman Yadav, met him and offered money to take contract of the land to farm. Yadav, a resident of UP, came here from Lalgola.Sabiruddin took the 1 bigha land from the owner who lives in Kolkata, for Rs 12,000. Yadav gave him this money as well as the seeds. The contract was that Yadav would take away entire resin collected from the poppies leaving the kernel for the farmer. Sabir learnt that the resin costs Rs 25,000 a kg. ""I heard that the gum is used to make intoxicant,"" he remarked.Thousands have similarly fallen to temptation of easy money that has led to the conversion of land along the belt into 'mini Afganistan'.Those who cannot afford to till large land opt for smaller ones even in the backyard. ""With China Silk invading the market, the cultivation of traditional mulberry has become non-viable. Even farming of vegetables with huge expense and little profit is avoided by the farmers,"" observed Binoy Mandal of Ramnagar. Instead, a cottah of poppy cultivation costs Rs 5000-7000, which yields 1 kg of resin that fetches Rs 60,000-70,000."" ""Moreover, the farming is not strenuous.Malda had a shortage of wheat production this year. Against 43,290 hectare of land in which wheat was cultivated last year, 41,145 hectare was used this year.Opium cultivation has a long history in this region. Immediately after the war of Plassey in 1757, East India Company discovered the treasure of opium in adjoining areas. Mainly controlled by the Portugese, the British soon took control of the trading to export opium to Asian and European countries. Apart from being used by the pharmaceutical companies, the opium journeys across the parched plains on a trail beaten by the British, who learnt to enslave China with Indian opium.However, the Indian government after Independence has never given licence to farmers to grow poppy apart from parts in Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan or Madhya Pradesh. But the tradition remained in Bengal. Oblivious of the danger and huge 'potential' lying within, Some farmers used to spray poppy seed in their lands. It is to get poppy seeds (posto) which is a popular cooking ingredient.FACTFILE:Villages thriving on poppy cultivation: Rajarampur, Nasipur, Kedarchandpur,Sarbangapur, Kasipur, Dubsor, Dakatepota, Chandghar in Murshidabad;Kaligunj, Tehatta, Karimnagar in Nadia; Harishchandrapur, Manikchak, Golapgunj, Ramnagar, Shersahi, Sahabazpur in Malda.Land under poppy cultivation: 5 lakh hectarePoppy cultivation unearthed: 15,000 bigha"
5940a0bf7be9e024e4599a08,Sunday story: The Cattlelines,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/sunday-story-the-cattlelines/,2016-01-24,"A cattle market at Omarpur, a little over 8 km from the border with Bangladesh. The haat, one of the larger cattle markets of Murshidabad district, comes alive every Sunday A cattle market at Omarpur, a little over 8 km from the border with Bangladesh. The haat, one of the larger cattle markets of Murshidabad district, comes alive every SundayBorders mean little here  the Padma doesnt think its worth even a pause. So the river flows on, even at Lalgola in West Bengals Murshidabad district, where it is part of the border between India and Bangladesh. The river refuses to pay heed to any man-made creations  border fences or security outposts  dismissing all such attempts with a casual change of direction every year during the monsoon. Over the last year, however, the Padma would have noticed a shift: the cattle smuggling trade between the two countries, much of it over the river and its tributaries, is now down to a trickle.Officers of the Border Security Force (BSF), whose jawans patrol the 915 km stretch of the border that West Bengal shares with Bangladesh, estimate that cattle smuggling has come down by more than 70 per cent since the BJP-led government at the Centre made the issue one of its top priorities. In April last year, Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh instructed BSF personnel deployed along the border to check cattle smuggling.Four months later, the minister touted the drop in figures for cattle smuggling as one of the governments major successes: from about 20-22 lakh cattle that would be smuggled across the border every year, he said, the numbers had come down to 2-2.5 lakh cattle in 2015.Since the NDA government came to power, the BSF has given its men discretionary powers to shoot at cattle smugglers, a strategy that has reportedly contributed to the drop in smuggling. In December 2015, in a written reply to a question in the Rajya Sabha, Minister of State for Home Kiren Rijiju had said, During the current calendar year, 21 cross-border criminals were killed by the BSF along the Bangladesh border, of whom 16 were allegedly cattle smugglers.We are taking different measures to ensure that cattle smuggling is stopped. Over the last year, we brought it to a halt and now weve asked the Centre to provide us with land to construct fences to stop all infiltration, says BSF DIG R PS Jaswal.BSF officers claim their efforts have had a direct result on sale of beef in Bangladesh. Figures available with the cattle haat (market) in Bangladesh show that around 22 lakh cattleheads were sold in 2013, 18 lakh in 2014, but only 4.5 lakh in 2015.But what Delhi sees as smuggling, Dhaka sees as legitimate cross-border trade. So during the November 16-17 Home Secretary-level talks between the two countries, Bangladesh raised the issue of rising prices of beef in that country as a result of the BSF crackdown. Dhaka reportedly also requested Delhi to go easy on cattle smugglers.The BSF has identified 64 Border Outposts (BOPs) along the Bengal-Bangladesh border that are vulnerable to cattle smuggling. Of these, they say, 46 account for 80 per cent of the cattle smuggling cases. Eight of these are in Murshidabad, where the river makes the border particularly hard to sanitise.The BSFs outposts are mostly bamboo sheds where jawans spend the nights. In the mornings, these outposts see a steady stream of people who take their cattle to the other side to graze. The jawans greet the cattle herders, reminding them to be back before sundown.Besides the outposts, new fences have been set up and BSF jawans patrol the river, their twin-engine speed boats rushing past the smaller country boats.But everyday life has a way of looking beyond the jawans, their guns and their speedboats. Umaruddin Ahmed, a farmer in Aurangabad village, says he routinely crosses over with his herd of cattle. Why should the border matter? My sister lives in Bangladesh. My ties with her are more important than anything else. We have documents issued by the state government that prove we live in India. The BSF examines our papers and allows us to walk across, says Ahmed, who has just returned from another visit to his sister. While the younger of his three sons takes care of his 200 sq ft field, he takes care of his cattle, taking them for walks across the border. My cattle like grazing on the other side. Here there are too many cows and not enough space. And of course, I get to chat with my sister, he says.This easy relationship that the villagers share with the border coupled with the Centres push to stop cattle smuggling leave the BSF with an unenviable job. Not only do they have to ensure that every Indian citizen who crosses the boundary is properly identified and returns before sunset, they also have to photograph, tag and count every animal that crosses the border.If someone returns with one animal less, we immediately file a case against him and hand him over to the police. There is no separate section in the Indian Penal Code for cattle smuggling, so we register cases under sections pertaining to cheating, says a senior officer of the BSFs Lalgola unit who spoke on condition of anonymity.The daily ritual of counting cows at checkposts, once in the morning and then again in the evening, is one of the many ways the BSF hopes to counter a trade that has thrived in the area for as long as anyone can remember.Apart from constructing border roads, putting up flood lights and increasing outposts along the border, the BSF has also increased the frequency of its surveillance. On Thursday, the Union Home Minister said a plan had been finalised to complete the fencing of the border.The BSF is now digging trenches and laying iron pipes in them along the barbed wire fences at the border. The trenches and the pipes will make it difficult for the cattle to jump across. This method has been very successful, says IG Sandeep Sulanke, who is in charge of the BSFs South Bengal Frontier.On more than one occasion, however, BSF jawans and officers have found themselves outnumbered and outflanked by the cattle smugglers. In December, we ambushed a big group of smugglers and their cattle. When we fired in the air, the cows, around 200 of them, started running helter-skelter and the smugglers gave us the slip. We were left holding the tails of a few cows. We only managed to round up about 50 cows, says a BSF officer posted at Cooch Behar, the district neighbouring Murshidabad, where the BSF claims cattle smuggling has come down  from a lakh a day to 500  since the land boundary agreement on enclaves made it easier to identify the border.Despite their efforts, many in the BSF feel that given the socio-economic realities of southern Bengal, the demand for beef and the nearly limitless supply of ageing bovines in India, smugglers will soon find a way to hoodwink them.We are doing our best and the situation (of cattle smuggling) is far better now than before, but frankly, we can stop, say, 10 cows. How can we stop a hundred? Theres a constant supply of cows from India and high demand in Bangladesh. With the kind of poverty in these parts and the money thats to be got from smuggling, to many of them, the risk of getting arrested or even dying during a smuggling operation seems worth taking, says a BSF officer who is posted at the BSFs Murshidabad circle headquarters in Behrampore town.In June 2015, the BSF had in its official magazine suggested that the only way to curb cattle smuggling was to legalise the export of over-aged and non-milching animals and promote beef industry in India by allowing the slaughter of unwanted cattle.Its a little before noon and a cattle haat is on at Omarpur, a little over 8 km from Lalgola at the border. The haat, one of the larger cattle haats of Murshidabad district, comes alive every Sunday. Several thousand cows are brought here for sale from across India  particularly Haryana, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Jharkhand. Most of the cows are old and sick, their ribs sticking out, their eyes glazed.Almost all these cows will be smuggled across the border for slaughter, some will make it to the few legal slaughterhouses in the state, says a trader.I have just sold two of my cows for Rs 13,000. They were healthy and fetched a good price. I am going to buy some chicken and vegetables and well have a feast at home today. Its a Sunday after all, says Ibrahim Kazi from Behrampore town, briskly counting the notes.For decades, the smuggling and sale of cattle across the border have provided sustenance to families in Murshidabad, both Hindus and Muslims. The trade has thrived, often as a family profession, with secrets passed down generations: how to evade the BSF, the best routes to transport cattle, how to ensure stealth while crossing the border.The economics of cattle smuggling is what makes the BSFs job tough. For most Indian farmers, a cow past its prime is of little value. Besides, tractors have long replaced bulls and oxen and they are of little use too. So the cattle are sold to traders who supply them to slaughterhouses in India, both legal and illegal. But with beef selling for around Rs 350-Rs 450 a kg in Bangladesh, in comparison to Rs 150 a kg in Bengal, smuggling is far more lucrative.Villages such as Shamsherganj and Lal Kola are seen as the hub of the cattle trade. By day, however, these are just an idyllic expanse of green. Their fields, thick with silt from the Padma, are among the most fertile in the country. But fragmented landholdings have forced villagers to look for livelihood options elsewhere  and its cattle smuggling that most turn to.We grow vegetables and our produce is possibly the best in the state. But we dont earn any profit. The money we earn, which allows us to educate our children, comes from taking cattle to Bangladesh, says Barun Mondal, a farmer at Shamsherganj.However, he claims to have stopped himself. I used to transport cattle from the haats to the collection point. It wasnt thought of as illegal until recently.Ahmed Raza, the headman at Chotokalia hamlet in Shamsherganj, says, Most families here survive because of cattle smuggling. Women roll beedis at home and men tend to their farms. But without the cattle trade, our income will go down by half. There are already families here who can no longer afford to send their children to school. Education is free, but theyd rather have more hands to work on the fields if thats the only source of income, he says.Ranjit, a villager from Omarpur in Murshidabad, who now works for an insurance company, says he smuggled cattle for most of his adult life. You cant do this on your own. You need to be part of a network, says the 42-year-old, adding smugglers usually organise themselves along religious or caste lines. For instance, the Muslim families of Omarpur look out for each other. Similarly, smugglers of the Ghosh community share information with each other, he says.Though he now sells insurance to people in his village, I was very good at smuggling, he says proudly. That makes him qualified to explain the trade and its ways.To begin with, he says, villagers bring their cows to the haats, from where transporters take them to collection points. The transporters avoid the main roads and usually move with not more than two cows at a time. Depending on the distance they cover, they get paid Rs 200-Rs 500 to take the cattle to the collection point, he says.This collection point is usually the home of a villager who is trusted by those in charge of the operation. Here the cows are kept for a few days until there are at least a hundred cows in one village. The smuggler pays for the upkeep of the cows and also pays a few thousands to the person whose house is the collection point, says Ranjit.The third and final part of the operation is the actual crossing of the border. This is done by cattle herders, usually young boys called rakhaals. The cows are fed a mixture of mustard oil and salt, which, smugglers believe, makes them less likely to moo while crossing. At places where the river separates the two countries, the cows are led into the water and forced to cross the river. The rakhaals hold on to the cows tail as they swim across the river to the other side. Smugglers prefer taking at least a hundred cows together because even if the BSF were to interrupt the smuggling operation, there is no way two patrolling officers can stop a hundred charging cows or bulls, he says.The rakhaals choose their time and moment to cross over  they usually do so when theres heavy fog or when its raining. That makes it very difficult for us to see the cows as they move across the border, says a BSF jawan posted at the Murshidabad circle headquarters.The BSF has been filing FIRs against the cattle smugglers they arrest before handing them over to the police. But the police, they say, need to do more. The BSF is limited to the border, but the police can make arrests in the haats. But that doesnt happen, making our job almost impossible, says the officer.So for now, the BSF relies on its meticulous headcount. There is a joke in the BSF now about how we are actually the CSF or the Cattle Security Force. We are following our orders and we are stopping the smuggling of cattle. But as far as national security is concerned, many of us feel that our efforts will be better directed at stopping the flow of fake currency and contraband and not counting cows, says a senior BSF officer.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Instead paint someone's life by choosing a colour based on their birth sign. According to city-based astrologers, colours have their own significance in different birth signs. For instance, pink and cream bring positivity in the life of Taureans and pale shades like off-white and cream calm the jostled nerves of Arians. For Sagittarians, red gives them a high energy.""Colour therapy is a recognized stream of medicine in which the patient suffering from a colour deficiency is advised to gain that colour balance in his system. Holi is the best occasion for natural treatment which ancient Indian scientists designed in consonance with nature. You can select your own colour on Holi and apply on others if you know the birth sign to have the best vibration of nature as well as friendship. Organic dry colours must be used instead of wet,"" said Madan Gupta Spatu, an astrologer.On this day, the scene of 'Holika burning to ashes' is enacted every year to mark the victory of good over evil. Holika was a demon who tried to kill Prahlad, the son of King Hiranyakashyap. The king had won over the kingdom of earth and was very egoistic. His son was a devotee of Lord Vishnu which he did not like and asked his sister to kill Prahlad. However, when she tried to kill him, she was burned to ashes.Holi comes on the conjunction of changing season coupled with religious backgrounds. This is why a day prior to Holi, Holika Dahan is performed where people gather around fire as burning of wood with several herbs purifies the atmosphere and makes it germs and virus-free.Time for Holika Dahan | 4:55pm to 5:31pmAries | Red, pale shades like off-white and cream calm jostled nerves of Arians.

Rajasthan is the second state after Gujarat in the country to switch to full fortification of edible oil to fight vitamin A and D deficiencies. Currently only fortified salt is sold in the state.A team of officials of the Rajasthan State Food and Civil Supplies Corporation, IIHMR University, Jaipur and Fairlab Pvt Ltd Gurgaon was sent to Gujarat to study the Gujarat model. This was done after chief minister Vasundhara Raje's announcement in her last budget.Food and civil supplies minister Hem Singh Bhadana had held a number of meetings with mill owners to iron out the difficulties. They agreed to launch the scheme from April 1 this year, which was then extended to deadline of July 1 to repack the existing stock.Subodh Agarwal, principal secretary in the food and civil supplies department said, ""All the oil mills and repacking units in the state have voluntarily agreed to shift to fortified oil. "" However, he said those units selling their produce outside the state are at the liberty to sell non-fortified oil as well. It would not put any extra burden on the consumers as the cost of fortification per kg of oil is only seven paise, he said.""There are 340 oil mills and repacking units in operation in the state. Out of which 183 mills have agreed fortify the edible oil with vitamin A and D from July 1. These mills were in the process of acquiring the equipment and pre-mix ingredients to shift to full fortification,"" he said.Out of the remaining 157 mills, 134 are mainly mustard oil processing units which sell their produce outside the state like West Bengal, Odisha, Bihar and north eastern states. He said these mills have also agreed to shift towards full fortification.He said all the mills have been asked to furnish affidavit in this direction. He said the rest of the 23 mills are mainly engaged in the processing of ground nut and sesame (til) which are rabi crops and they would also switch to fortification from next year."

Fish ladders are a series of pools built like steps to enable fish to ascend a dam and enable them to migrate upstream over or through a barrier. The ladders will enable the fish to cross the dam and breed further up the river.Bharti is on record as saying once that happens, the fish, considered a delicacy in East India, will be available in the Ganga in regions as far as even the Chambal in MP and UP, as was the case in the past. Indeed, till the time the Farakka barrage was built in 1975, hilsa which only breeds in fresh water travelled hundreds of kilometres inland to breed. The building of the barrage barred their migration.The hilsa is now like a fish out of water in the Ganga. ""Gone are the days when we relished the choicest preparations of hilsa, which is revered as 'machher rani' (queen of fishes), amid monsoon spells. It is a thing of the past. Today, we can't afford this luxury and have to spend Rs 1,200-1,500 for a kg of fish,"" laments Gauri Das (75), a resident of Bengali Tola area in Varanasi.The last time Das bought hilsa was three years ago on a special occasion. Recalling the old days, when it was available in abundance in the markets, she said, ""Dishes like Shorshe Ilish (hilsa cooked in mustard paste) and Bhapa Ilish (steamed hilsa with chilly mustard paste) were common in Bengali households. Today, we are yearning for hilsa."" Those were the days before the Farakka barrage was built and the hilsa travelled long distances upstream.Das was elated at the thought that hilsa could be fished locally in the Ganga waters in the coming days. "" Sotti! Eta hobe?"" (Really! Would it happen?),"" she wondered with her wide open eyes. ""Hilsa is cooked in a number of ways,"" she said, adding that it can be fried, cooked in spicy tomato or ginger-based gravy (jhol), or mustard-based with green chillies (shorshe batar jhal). It can also be cooked with posto, doi (curd), seasonal vegetables, and steamed inside of plantain or butternut squash leaves."

The GM mustard is like a Trojan horse waiting to attack, they said.The Government of India plans to approve GM mustard (three different types) developed by the Delhi University. The application for approval is at an advanced stage of processing by the Indian regulators.The mustard sowing season is fast approaching and the central regulators could take a decision on the matter any day soon. So we urge the Tamil Nadu Chief Minister to look into this. The AIADMK government in its manifesto highlighted that it would not permit GM foods, said Kavitha Kuruganti, Convenor, Alliance for Sustainable and Holistic Agriculture. According to Ms. Kavitha, even neighbouring States should say no to GM mustard or it would enter the Tamil Nadu market.Dhanapal, president of the Cauvery Delta Farmers Association, said that every family in Tamil Nadu consumes a minimum of 5 gm. of mustard per day. So one should be cautious about what they eat. GM mustard would not only impact people but also spoil the soil, he added.T. Vellaiyan, president of the Tamil Nadu Traders Association, asked: When we have ample mustard what is the need for the GM version.Members of the various associations expressed concern that the Centre is processing an application for a GM crop that is herbicide tolerant. According to them, This will increase chemical usage in our farming in addition to displacing poor agricultural labourers from employment. This has direct implications for all consumers with greater toxic residues in our food. It is all the more shocking as the matter is pending in the Supreme Court of India.They also said allowing transgenic mustard will open the flood gates for dozens of other similar crops and jeopardise farmer livelihoods and bio diversity.Mustard is mainly grown in the North-West parts. Rajasthan, U.P. are the major producing States. The Rajasthan output is highly monsoon-dependent. The other important producers are M.P., Haryana, Gujarat, West Bengal and Assam."

Why did you choose Calcutta or did Calcutta choose you? Well, you can say it happened both ways.

I am a friend of Cesare (Bieller) who is my predecessor here, who told me that the place is actually very nice and it was worth coming here. As diplomats we can apply for a new posting and I was lucky enough to get this. Apart from Cesare, did you talk to anyone with a Calcutta connect before arriving here? Yes, I got to talk to some friends of mine who were posted to India. Like Joel Melchiori, who was the consul-general here before Cesare, and he also told me that the city was very pleasant to work in for a tenure. I spoke to other colleagues who had served in India, trying to understand what kind of environment and what kind of challenges I would find in the city. What has been your first impression of Calcutta? When I came in February I was happy to see that everything I was told about the city was actually true. The people of Calcutta are so warm and friendly and welcoming and the social environment is also very friendly, and I would say even hectic. And the food is so good! I play golf and I have discovered that there are two clubs with 18-hole courses. I play at RCGC and it is very nice and really professional. I believe it is the first British golf course opened outside the British Isles, and they tell this with great pride and rightly so. I can confirm that the tradition is well maintained even after two centuries. It is a wonderful place to spend a few hours playing golf. Even the bad things they told me about Calcutta are not so bad after all. Like the weather. Everybody told me that the weather was a negative factor. Of course there are some periods of the year when the weather is not good but, at the end of the day, it is not worse than it was in Vietnam. In fact, it is better. And the good season is really good. In February when I arrived, and a part of March, the weather was really fine. The traffic was another negative factor I was told about, which it can be during some periods of the year, some special days and some special hours but for the rest of the time it is acceptable. I come from Rome - I am not from Rome but being a diplomat we serve in Rome - and I will tell you that traffic in Rome is a negative factor because we spend hours moving from one part of the city to the other. Calcutta is not worse than that. If there is anything negative here it is the quality of the air. It seems to be not so good because of the pollution. It is a factor that should be addressed because it affects the lives of citizens. You said how hectic the social life in Calcutta is, did you expect that? Well not so much. They told me, but I did not expect it. For example the races, it is a very special tradition beautifully preserved, which I like very much. The tradition of clubs is also something very unique to Calcutta, which says many things about the culture of the city. In these beautiful mansions used as clubs you can find an atmosphere that takes you back a hundred years. It is really something special. Another factor that is special to me is the food. I love Bengali food and Indian food. We Italians have our food tradition that is very well known and spread throughout the world, so when we talk about food we want to be sure that what we have on our plate is actually good. And I must tell you that I haven't found anything here in Calcutta that isn't very high level. The local tradition of food and the special dishes is just wonderful. Bengali cuisine uses ingredients like fresh fish and seafood, which is among my favourites, so I am very lucky. Also the spices you use here like mustard for instance, and you fry in mustard oil, which is something very strange for us but it very tasty and I like it so much. I have been in five-star hotels eating Bengali food and it was delicious and I've been to other restaurants in town and it is the same. I noticed the great attention given to the freshness of the ingredients and also the presentation of the food. How are you looking to engage with Calcutta on culture? We hope to be able to organise something special in November when the minister of foreign affairs launches the first week of Italian cuisine worldwide. As I said earlier, we have our food traditions and you have yours. To my understanding, Italian food is very much appreciated in Calcutta. We will also have discussions and exchange of views on local dishes; we will be inviting someone to present some ideas on Italian cuisine to a local audience. We are looking forward to organising other events like concerts and the screening of a silent movie with music at the end of the year. Is education going to be one of your focus areas? Yes. For example, after having this week of Italian cuisine, I would like, if possible, to take it to the next step like trying to bring Italy to the schools here that teach hotel management. We would like to bring in teachers from Italy working in this sector to see if it is possible to arrange some sort of coordination and cooperation. We have many collaborations with institutes here and many students are applying for student visas for Italy to study in universities like Bocconi and Politecnico, both in Milan and Turin. The figures are smaller as compared to other parts of India but they are increasing. We have cooperation in the area of education and research thanks to the centres of excellence in Italy in fields like physics and I see that there is continuous exchange of researchers. This is an important tool for strengthening bilateral relations. In terms of business and trade what are your focus areas? This is a sector where I think we should concentrate more than we have in the past. Bengal has great potential. There is attention towards attracting investors and in improving the business environment. The business summit in January 2017 will be an important event in that regard. I think it is the right move from the state government to attract investors in all sectors but in manufacturing in particular. By the way, Italy has great expertise in the area of small and medium enterprises. The backbone of Italian economy is based on SMEs and this is something that connects Italy and India. SMEs could explore their full potential because they were working in clusters, exchanging ideas, exchanging labour force, exchanging pattern and modes of production which made the SMEs more agile and flexible than the big companies. This is an experience that I think could be replicated over here. West Bengal is a great hub of leather industries and even for Italy that sector is very important. This is a specific area where we can concentrate on strengthening our bilateral cooperation. We would also like to introduce more Italian wines to Calcutta. Wine is an important tradition in Europe and though Calcutta has a love for strong alcohol, especially whisky, many people are becoming more and more interested in tasting wine. So this is another area in which there is scope for cooperation between the two places. I am very happy to hear that Calcuttans are becoming more interested in good wines and I hope that it will be possible to bring more Italian wine labels to the city. Every Calcuttan on a Europe trip stops in Italy but do you have any plans to encourage tourists from Calcutta to spend time in Italy? This year we are having the Jubilee celebrations so it is turning out to be an attraction for a number of people in Calcutta. And there's the ceremonial canonisation of Mother Teresa as well. That is also when we will have the visit of the chief minister (Mamata Banerjee) to Italy. We have already received many applications for visas - pilgrims and tourists travelling to Rome for this special occasion. I am sure that on September 4 we'll see that St. Peter's Square will be crowded and most of the crowd I think will be made up of Calcuttans! My suggestion to people who are interested to travel to Italy is: I understand that most of the people, when they prepare their itinerary they think, 'Okay, 10 days in Europe? Value for money is visiting at least five countries so I can say I visited five countries'. But when you go so wide you cannot go in-depth. And Italy has so many different things to see. The food, as we were saying, is a factor. We are also one of the countries in the world with the most important heritage monuments. We can offer people a chance to enjoy wonderful mountains as many tourists like to go trekking or on walks in the mountains. Also the Alps from the Italian side has wonderful places that can be visited like Trentino-Alto Adige in the north-east of Italy. The landscape is wonderful, nothing less than Switzerland or Austria. For those who are interested we have wonderful beaches as well. If you go to Sardinia you'll see that we have places almost as beautiful as Thailand for swimming and sunbathing. The pleasure of walking around in ancient and historical towns and sunbathing and swimming in the sea on the same day, it is an experience that you cannot get everywhere. Love for food apart, do you see any similarities between Italians and Calcuttans? For Italians family is very important and in India also you have very close-knit large families. In Italy now the families are smaller in size but still the ties in the families are very strong. The other thing of course is that we both have a long and rich history. It is something that brings us closer despite being thousands of kilometres away. Also both Italians and Calcuttans are very happy people. This is a common thing we have which is also a positive thing and something to be proud of. The consulate has moved to a new office (5G, New Road, Alipore), will there be an expansion in the services the consulate provides? Well the idea is that since we now have this location in Alipore we will be using this as a hub for organising events, which would bring together people who love Italy or Italian culture and food. It can be a place where they and even Italians can meet and spend some time together. The Indo-Italian Chamber of Commerce office will also shift to the new premises. This will become the hub of Italy in Calcutta. What is your 'welcome to Calcutta' message for the Italian consul-general? Tell [email protected]"

""Cement manufacturing companies have increased the prices of cement bags up to Rs 370. At the same time, they are supplying cement at rates between Rs 210 and Rs 280 to companies which are engaged in the Centre's works. In West Bengal and Bihar, cement costs around Rs 100 less per bag. How is that possible?"" Gogoi asked.Last week, CM Sarbananda Sonowal held a meeting with representatives of 25 cement companies and asked them to control prices.According to a KMSS survey, the price of a cubic metre of sand has gone up from Rs 1,300 to Rs 1,600 in the city. The same amount of sand would cost around Rs 700 and Rs 980, respectively, three months ago. He added that 2,500 pieces of bricks would cost Rs 15,000 about three months ago. Now the price has increased to Rs 19,000.""Not just construction materials, pulses and mustard oil also cost more. The new government will soon complete 100 days. If we do not see any steps to arrest prices within the 100th day, we will start an agitation,"" Gogoi said."

Other than the overburdened donkey, we see sewing machines and kitchen implements.Ranjeeta Kumaris first solo, Labour of the Unseen  Sujani  Nihilism in the Craft , which is on at Clark House, Colaba, looks at workers who toil endlessly so that our lives function without a hitch. The 33-year-old artist asks the urban milieu to reconsider the dismissal of this labour force  their lives, hopes and ambitions  and the claim that they exist only to increase slum populations and demand pay raises every year. Through videos, installations of borrowed, bartered or found objects and photographs, and a collaboration with her mother, Kaushalya Devi, Kumari shifts the view to what she terms the labour of the unseen.Kumaris impulse comes from her own life-experiences and the views of her Marxist father. Born and raised in Patnas Harijan colony, Kumari was one of the few children with access to education. Growing up with the inequities her community faces, she found herself keenly following the lives of people in the Domkhana, near the Patna College of Arts & Crafts, where she completed her Bachelors in Fine Arts. The Domkhana (colloquially an informal settlement of the untouchable caste, Doms) was filled with cane craftspersons who made objects for religious and ritualistic ceremonies at low prices. However, they were shunned by the very people who used the objects.Motifs of artThese experiences seem to be the crux of what drives the conversation in Labour of the Unseen. The show begins with a series of watercolour paintings of the donkey, bringing to mind the most common words associated with it: labour, transport, lazy, stubborn. The well-executed portraits (one of them even brings to mind Raghu Rais famous portrait of a donkey) set the tone of what is to come: a donkey is often more useful than a horse, but still considered somewhat secondary to the horses beauty and taciturn nature.The motifs the artist uses are fairly self-evident, but at times so removed from urban reality that they throw the viewer off for a minute. Other than the often-overburdened donkey, we see sewing machines, water drums, construction tools and implements from the Indian kitchen. When we visited the show, at least three other people in the gallery at the time could not recall the word for the chakla , the flat circular board on which chapatis are rolled across India.Cultural evolutionsThe donkeys lead us to meditations on the evolution of cultures. The famed Grand Trunk Road, a 2,500-km stretch from Kabul in Afghanistan to Tamralipti in West Bengal during the Mauryan Empire, exists in modern forms and is still in use. It passes Dadri in Uttar Pradesh (most recently in the news for the beef-related murder of Mohammed Akhlaq in 2015), where Kumari completed an MFA at the Shiv Nadar University.Like an archaeologist, Kumari leaves us snapshots of items used by the worker, by the former farmer, by the now-mechanic, without so much as a trace of the person it may belong to.Take the series of photographs and installations around economic activity in Dadri, where she saw tradition clash with industry in an obvious way. Photographs of small mechanical repair shops cover the wall: a series titledTools(2016). Shops now run by those who have given up or lost their access to farmlands or cant survive on income from farming alone due to various inequities.Tools of tradeFurther ahead, another set of photos,Marks on the Land(2016), documents marks left by construction on a patch of land. Each new set of marks (messy tyre treads from trucks mixed with construction dirt moving to cemented order) feels like it is erasing its predecessor, making you wonder: does the cemented patch remember the dirt patch it used to be?And so it goes as you take in the stacks of bindas : or rolled up scraps of cloth and cement bags labourers stack on their heads as ballast when they carry heavy objects. The installation Unseen City (2016) is accompanied by recorded interviews with labourers whom the artist bartered with for their bindas. The artist recounts how she at first tried to make them new ones, but they preferred their own techniques and began to ask for cloth and material to make new ones of their own. Along with the installation are a set of photographs: items of daily use by the labourer: a tiffin, a gamchha , and so on.Farming of the Fundamentalis more direct. It references the Constitution of India, speaking of the inspiration and hope it and the writings of Dr. Ambedkar induced in a person born to a lower caste background.Kumari also speaks of the dislocation and dissonance felt by those who worked on farmlands slowly turning into a township.The video shows us a clay replica of the Constitution, in which she plants mustard seeds. The video documents the growth of the seeds into plants over three months and how they eventually die out. There is a touch of confusion in what the dying out could imply, but imagining the once-bright fields of mustard (and jowar and bajra) makes you think back to a time when your own hometown (or, in my case, Mumbai) used to be a patchwork of farmland surrounding a station and administrative buildings.A few works in between falter: the drawings of the river, while quite exquisite, dont quite lend to the context as well. The chakla , on its own plinth, retelling a conversation between the artist and her mother: is the world your home or is the home your world? It sits with a sari Kumari has block-printed with images of old sewing machines (a lot like the ones seen in theTools) and a sujani (quilt) hand-made by the artist and her mother. The sujani is a reminder of more unseen labour, womens labour, which is seen and registered even less. Together, these three somehow lack the impact ofAcross the Line, a tightly shot video of the artists mothers hands grinding daily masala (turmeric, red chilly powder) on a grindstone. Once again, evidence that speaks to the labourer a lot more than perhaps the chakla, which seems simplistic in response. In some places, the work feels it lacks contextualisation and one wonders if there need to be notes on hand for a better understanding of the work and the spaces it inhabits. However, these are small infractions that a lengthier viewing might address.The show is not just a little victory for the fairly young Shiv Nadar University, with its faculty of contemporary artists, but also a witnessing of thoughts and work from the Indian heartland that throw up challenges to an urban perspective.Labour of the Unseen  Sujani  Nihilism in the Craft will show at Clark House, Colaba, till September 29.The author is a freelance writer"

5920810f7be9e04a516a8bdd,Singur needs 4 more yrs to grow crops,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/576934/singur-needs-4-more-yrs.html,2016-10-20,"Drimi Chaudhuri, Singur, Oct 21, 2016, dhns: 1:16 ISTDespite claims by the West Bengal government that the land at Singur, where the Tata Motors factory previously stood, is cultivable again, farmers believe it will take at least two years to grow crops like potato on the land.The agricultural hamlet in Hooghly district has been traditionally known for its bumper potato harvest.A large section of farmers, who owe the repossession of their land to a Supreme Court verdict, believe the soil will need a lot of churning and tilling to regain its earlier fertility.True to their instincts, developed over years of farming, the land acquired to set up the proposed Nano factory can now grow only crops like mustard, sesame and pulses.Before the factory was set up, a large percentage of land at Singur produced as many as five crops, including potato, rice, cauliflower, jute and variety of pulses.While growing mustard and sesame was an afterthought for most farmers, the current state of the land forced them to grow these crops. On Thursday, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee was present to hand over the physical possession of land, as she distributed the land deeds to farmers on September 14.She also spread mustard seeds as a symbolic measure to restart farming on 997 acres, which was stopped in 2006, when the erstwhile Left Front government acquired the land to help set up the Tata plant.Even though local Trinamool Congress MLA and former agriculture minister, Becharam Manna, claimed the state government is returning the land in a cultivable state, agriculture and soil experts express doubts that after lying fallow for a decade, the land is not likely to retain its fertility. While the plant stood on more than 250 acres of the total acquired land, since the area was low-lying, its height was increased by piling tonnes of sand, fly ash and solid waste.While this process itself would have rendered the land infertile, Manna claimed around 400 acres are ready for cultivation.Mamata handed over 23 plots spread over 6.71 acres on Thursday, with plans to hand over 50 to 60 land plots everyday.The government is also installing 50 mini-deep tube-wells for better irrigation, besides distributing free seeds, fertilisers, and providing a one-time grant of Rs 10,000 to each farmer.Farmers like Ganesh Koley, Naba Kumar Ghosh and Jugal Kishore Ghosh, however, did not seem to share the governments confidence over the lands renewed cultivability. Jugal said that the government decided to start with mustard because crops like mustard, sesame and pulses release nitrogen and help land gain fertility.Weve to grow such crops for a few years till the land regains nutrition. It could take as long as four years for the land to be properly cultivable so that we can grow potato or rice, he said."

58fd756f7be9e06c9371c714,Newsmakers from India that hogged the front pages in 2016,http://www.newindianexpress.com/2016-with-tnie/2016/dec/29/newsmakers-from-india-that-hogged-the-front-pages-in-2016-1554296.html,2016-12-29,"J JayalalithaaAmma, as she was popularly called, created history in the 2016 Assembly election by becoming the first chief minister since MGR in 1984 to have retained power in the state for consecutive terms, since 1989. Her government received attention for its extensive social-welfare agenda that it continued from its previous term, which included several subsidised Amma-branded goods such as canteens, bottled water and salt. Three years into her tenure, she was convicted in a disproportionate assets case, rendering her disqualified to hold office but she returned as chief minister after being acquitted in May 2015. In September 2016, she fell severely ill and, following 75 days of hospitalisation, died on December 5, 2016 from a cardiac arrest.Mamata BanerjeeClose on the heels of Jayalalithaas swearing-in, Mamata Banerjee too assumed charge as Chief Minister of West Bengal for a second term. The oath-taking ceremony, one of the biggest events in West Bengal, was called the coronation of the Queen of Bengal. Massive cutouts of Mamata Banerjee lined the roads leading to the venue. Besides Banerjee, 41 ministers were sworn in, many of whom touched her feet after taking an oath, reflecting a bit of the authoritarian aura of her counterpart in the southern state.Smriti IraniIranis tenure as Human Resources Development minister came to an abrupt end in 2016 after she allegedly courted more controversy than any other minister in the Narendra Modi cabinet. The former TV star bore the brunt of public outrage and the oppositions wrath over her handling of the episode that was blamed for the suicide of Rohith Vemula, a University of Hyderabad Dalit PhD scholar.She was accused of abetting the punishment of Dalit students by writing a series of letters to the University of Hyderabads vice-chancellor, which culminated in Rohith Vemula ending his life. After she was removed from the high-profile HRD ministry, Irani was given the textile portfolio.The infamous JNU row that made student union leader Kanhaiya Kumar a household name also backfired for the feisty leader. The opposition alleged that the HRD ministry had distorted facts in the case against the JNU student leaders who were representatives of Left parties.Kanhaiya KumarThe president of JNU students union was slapped with sedition charges, suspended from the university and arrested. Kumar, along with his fellow students Anirban Bhattacharya and Umar Khalid were charged with raising anti-national slogans at a students march protesting Parliament attack convict Afzal Gurus hanging on the third anniversary of the death. Kumar, who is a member of the All India Students Federation, the student wing of the CPI(M), was remanded to five-day police custody which led to an outcry among the student community, on social media and liberals across the country. Though Kanhaiya Kumar initially emerged a hero, he later drew flak for drawing political mileage from the issue.Rohith VemulaThe suicide of Rohit Vemula, a Dalit PhD scholar at the University of Hyderabad created a nationwide stir. Vemula wrote in his suicide note about his daily struggle against prejudice and discrimination, in the university and in society. Two weeks prior to his suicide Vemula and four of his Dalit friends, all members of the Ambedkar Students Association were suspended by the university following a complaint of assault by an ABVP leader. Vemula and his friends denied the charges. Vemula committed suicide soon after, an episode that drew attention to the plight of Dalit students in universities and also the alleged witch hunt that was pursued by then HRD Minister Smriti Irani in this particular case.Zakir NaikThe popular Islamic missionary and the controversial preacher came into the public eye after the Dhaka restaurant attack in July. He was accused of being the inspiration behind the attacks. Investigators claimed that Zakir Naik played a role in instigating youth to join the terror outfit Islamic State.Irom Chanu SharmilaA constant activist seeking the repeal of the controversial Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA) ended her 16-year-old fast. First introduced to fight the Naga rebellion in the 1950s, AFSPA has been a bone of contention in Jammu and Kashmir in the north and Manipur and other parts of northeast India as well, mainly due to its reported misuse by security forces. Sharmila now plans to take her battles to the political arena and contest in the Manipur elections.Akhilesh Yadav and Shivpal YadavThere have been undercurrents between unclenephew Akhilesh Yadav and Shivpal Yadav ever since Akhilesh was named chief ministerial nominee of the Samajwadi party in the previous Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections, over Shivpal Yadav. However, things took a turn for the worse when SP Chief Mulayam Singh Yadav made Shivpal the partys state unit chief in place of Akhilesh, in an attempt to strike a balance between his son and his brother before the upcoming UP elections.Akhilesh Yadav stripped his uncle of three portfolios. Shivpal Yadav, thereafter, resigned from the state government as well as the post of the chief of Samajwadi party state line. The saga now continues as party chief Mulayam on December 28 released a list of over 300 candidates for the 2017 election, completely disregarding son Akhileshs picks; and Akhilesh restorted a day later by naming 167 candidates of his own to contest under different election symbols.Sri Sri RavishankarSpiritual leader and founder of the Art of Living (AOL) Sri Sri Ravishankar was mired in controversy after the World Cultural Festival hosted by him on the plains of the river Yamuna is alleged to have caused large-scale damage to the fragile eco-system around the water body. Environmentalists from across the country had protested the permission given to the festival to be held on the floodplains of the Yamuna, as they warned that massive temporary constructions for the event would cause an ecological disaster. Pressed for time and construction already having begun full swing when the case reached the National Green Tribunal (NGT), all that was done was to go ahead and give a green signal to the event, after the foundation agreed to pay Rs 5 crore in damages, which was never recovered.Vijay MallyaMallya, who has always been in the news for his flamboyant lifestyle, was in the limelight in 2016 for a wholly different reason  the poor state of his finances. The collapse of Kingfisher Airlines unravelled his business empire. And even as banks were trying to recover the thousands of crores of rupees given to his companies as loan, Mallya was allowed to fly out of the country despite a case being filed by the CBI filed against him for fraud, money laundering, and misappropriation among other charges. The liquor barons escape from the country led to the opposition putting political pressure, resulting in the revocation of Mallyas passport and a non-bailable warrant issued against him. Mallya, however, continues to live in the UK, evading the law in India.Baba RamdevSwadeshi business baron Baba Ramdevs Patanjali products is estimated to be worth over Rs 5,000 crore and the profits surged by almost 150 percent in 2016. The yogis products have been inching close to national brands like Dabur, Marico, Godrej, ITC, Nestle, HUL and P&G. A recent report, however, sparked doubts about the efficacy of his products that are claimed to be completely herbal and in some cases, organic. A court fined Patanjali Rs 11 lakh after it found the company guilty of ""releasing misleading advertisements by selling certain products with its labels although they were being manufactured by some other firm."" The case was filed in November 2012 after samples of products, including edibles like salt, honey, besan (gram flour), mustard oil and jam allegedly failed quality tests in August.Raghuram RajanRBIs 23rd governor, globally respected and credited with bringing down inflation in the country  and for taking several bold economic decisions  stepped down after completing his tenure in September. Rajans outspoken nature, particularly his comments on Prime Minister Narendra Modis pet project Make in India, which he said was better named Make for India, as reports suggest, did not go down well with the government. That, among other reasons, is suspected to have dented his chance at a second term in office, the possibility of which was widely discussed in the media. In a television interview, after announcing his decision not to seek a second term, he said, I was willing perhaps to stay, provided we could reach the right kind of agreement. We didnt. Thats where it ended."
