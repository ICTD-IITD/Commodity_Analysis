The GEAC, in 2017, had recommended the commercial use of genetically modified (GM) mustard in a submission to the environment ministry, following which there has been opposition from anti-GM activists.It is now left to the environment minister to take a call on the matter.""Decision regarding commercial release of genetically modified crops is governed in accordance with the 'Rules for the Manufacture/Use/Import/Export and Storage of Hazardous Microorganisms, Genetically Engineered Organisms or Cells', 1989 under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986,"" Sharma said.""However, no objection certificate from the state department of agriculture is required for conduct of any confined field trial in that particular state,"" he said.Replying to another question, Sharma said that presently, there are 16 trials of GM crops under consideration of the GEAC for various stages of testing.""Some state governments such as Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, and some experts have expressed their reservations over introduction and field trials of genetically modified crops,"" he said.He pointed out that towards enhancing awareness and capacity-building on the matter, the government organises workshops for different stakeholders including state-level functionaries, farmers among others, along with dissemination of knowledge products in various regional languages.""The government has not received any adverse report regarding destruction of local varieties by or health hazards of genetically modified crops.""The government has a well-laid policy regarding genetically modified crops framed under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986,"" he added."
5aeb04cb9855b73f522c5f26,The Beatles’ magical mystery tour of India,http://www.livemint.com/Leisure/ShOyoU6g0Rs5TPKxfOgwxK/The-Beatles-magical-mystery-tour-of-India.html,2018-01-19,"The narrow path leading to the main hall of the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi Ashramor the Chaurasi Kutia Ashram as the locals refer to itin Rishikesh is slippery even when not wet. What was once a paved thoroughfare, used by hundreds of disciples of the globe-trotting Indian ascetic, is today covered with moss that requires visitors to mind every step.Even as the impressive architecture of the buildings along the main walkway is hidden with foliage of plants splitting through the concrete, the giant hall inside, where the Maharishi gave his sermons, is a burst of colour. The hall is airy and spacious with a large platform at one end. Graffiti in all sizes adorn the walls, lending a colourful character to what fans have christened the Beatles Cathedral. While not much signage or information is provided at the ashram, the graffiti has been painted over the years by those who managed to sneak in with cans of spray paint and their love and loyalty for the British band from the small city of Liverpool who won over the world.A black and white hand-painted portrait of the Maharishi dominates the centre of the platform; from here he would address his disciples. Alongside the small flight of three steps leading to the platform, a line is scribbled in red ink: With every mistake we must surely be learning. It is a throwback to While My Guitar Gently Weeps, a song that Beatle George Harrison had written and composed in 1968 as a comment on the tensions and discord gripping the rock band. The scribbled line could well encapsulate a 50-year-old tale.Maharishi Mahesh Yogi and participants of a meditation course pose for a photograph, in February 1968. Photo: Paul SaltzmanA passage to IndiaOn a crispy cool wintry afternoon in February 1968, film-maker and photographer Paul Saltzman sat near John Lennon and Paul McCartney as The Beatles practised two lines they had just composed of a song. Saltzman happened to be present at the ashram in Rishikesh during the bands visit.McCartney, in a white kurta-pyjama, looked at ease in the surroundings. Drummer Ringo Starr hung around in a Nehru jacket and provided rhythm by snapping his fingers while Lennon and McCartney sang and strummed on Martin D-28 acoustic guitars. Sitting near them, Saltzmans eyes followed McCartneys reading from a piece of paper on which was scribbled the refrain: Ob-la-di, Ob-la-da, life goes on, brah, La la, how the life goes on.McCartney told me that those were the only two lines they had so far. The two of them kept singing the chorus and played around with it. But what shone through was the joy infused in their music at that moment, says Saltzman over the phone from Ontario, Canada. John and Paul were working as equals and the four of them (including George Harrison) were like a family of brothers out there in Rishikesh when I met them.Fifty years on, the Rishikesh stint of the Fab Four, as The Beatles were often referred to, stands apart as a cultural signpost, as it marked the entry of Indian music and spirituality in Western mainstream pop culture. The seven-week-long stay at the ashram resulted in The Beatles composing the bulk of the songs for their ninth studio album, The Beatles (more famous as White Album); a phase when, as Lennon described in The Beatles Anthology (2000), he wrote some of his best songs. Over 30 songs were written during their ashram stay, including Back In The USSR, Dear Prudence, Ob-la-di, Ob-la-da, The Continuing Story Of Bungalow Bill, While My Guitar Gently Weeps and Im So Tired. The quiet of the ashram, the daily meditation, healthy lifestyle and vegetarian food allowed their creativity to blossom and it was possibly the most artistic phase of their career, says Saltzman.US-based music critic and author of The Unreleased Beatles: Music And Film (2006) Richie Unterberger considers the Rishikesh trip to be very important to the career of The Beatles. First, because they were away from Beatlemania for the first time in five years and away from a hectic work schedule for the first time since 1960, they had less distractions from songwriting, he says on email. Second, because they only had acoustic instruments with them, many of the songs they wrote in Rishikesh had an acoustic, folky flavour, as you can hear on the White Album tracks like Julia, Dear Prudence, Blackbird and Mother Natures Son. Because they spent a lot of time practising meditation, they might have allowed thoughts buried in their subconscious to surface. As a result, their time in Rishikesh might have been the most prolific in their songwriting career, yielding such an abundance of material that their next album, the White Album, became a double LP and not a single one.Before their 1968 visit to Rishikesh, The Beatles were in India twice. The first, on 8 June 1964, was during a stopover at the Calcutta (now Kolkata) airport en route to Hong Kong. That visit, Beatles fansites remark, passed off uneventfully, with a crowd of girls waiting for them when the plane touched downa phenomenon of screaming fans that they encountered during refuelling stoppages in Beirut, Karachi, Kolkata and Bangkok.The quiet of the ashram, the daily meditation, healthy lifestyle and vegetarian food allowed their creativity to blossom and it was possibly the most artistic phase of their career.- Paul Saltzman, PhotographerAround the time of their second visit, this time a one-day layover in Delhi on 6 July 1966, enormous fame and furious controversies had caught up with the band. Before arriving in Delhi, the band had been troubled by rightwing elements in Japan and roughly booted out of the Philippines for not having attended a breakfast meeting with the then first lady Imelda Marcos at the presidential palace. The band found hordes of fans waiting at the Delhi airport and along the route; fans on scooters gave chase, shouting Hi Beatles, Beatles. The fansite Beatlesbible.com quotes George Harrison as saying, Oh no! Foxes have holes and birds have nests, but Beatles have nowhere to lay their heads. Harrison, nevertheless, found time during the brief stopover to indulge in a passion that had gripped him by thenthe sitar. The band went looking for these at Rikhi Ram and Sons musical instruments shop in Connaught Place. Later, some were sent over to their hotel room for them to try out. The previous year, when The Beatles released their album Rubber Soul, with Harrison playing sitar over the deeply introspective Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown), a sore point was the cheap sitar going slightly off-key. This one bought from India had to be perfect.George Harrison and wife Pattie Boyd in Rishikesh. Photo: Paul SaltzmanThe dark horseIf anybody was steering the band towards India and all that the country possessed, musically and spiritually, it was Harrison. The Quiet One could also have been the one with the most inherently seeking nature. In the mid-1960s, when rock music in the West was seeking new musical frontiers and challenges, a 20-something Harrison discovered the sitar and his guru, sitar maestro Pandit Ravi Shankar, in June 1966 in London. They remained friends till Harrisons death at age 58 in 2001. For some critics, the sitar and his Indian classical music-influenced compositions gave Harrison his own niche in a band where Lennon-McCartney held the creative reins. For others, it was an essential component of Harrisons search for meaning in life.The sitar was part of Harrisons journey and with it he wanted to understand sadhana (meditation) through the highest Indian guru-shishya traditions, says Kolkata-based tabla player and composer Bickram Ghosh, who toured with Ravi Shankar for many years and played on Shankars album Chants Of India (1997), which was produced by Harrison. In 1999, Ghosh got a call from Harrison, asking him to play on the title track of his forthcoming album Brainwashed (released posthumously in 2002). Ghosh spent a week recording with Harrison at his mansion in the UKs Henley-on-Thames. The song turned out to be an apt summary of Harrisons music: a balanced blend of Western rock and Indian music.Norwegian Wood is often considered to be the opening salvo of raga-rock, a musical fusion that flourished in the 1960s and 1970s. Harrisons Indian compositionsWithin You Without You, Love You To with The Beatlesand his single The Inner Light continued the trend. Early in his solo career, Harrison wrote songs like the folky Dehra Dun and the passionate Bangla Desh, which recounts his friend Ravi Shankar approaching Harrison to help the victims of the 1970 cyclone in West Bengal and East Pakistan and the 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War. Harrison was moved enough to singlehandedly organize rock musics first charity show on a massive scale. The Concert for Bangladesh at New Yorks Madison Square Garden in 1971 was a huge hit, helping Harrison raise millions for Unicef. His experience with India was immersive. To that effect, it might not be entirely surprising that the final strains of music ever recorded by Harrison was an over 2-minute section to end the album and song, Brainwashed, where Harrison and his son, Dhani, chant the bhajan Nama Parvathi Pathaye Hara Hara to Ghoshs tabla. Till the day I die, Harrison is known to have told Rolling Stone magazine in 1968, I still believe (Indian music) is the greatest music ever on our level of existence.Indian classical music led Harrison towards Eastern spirituality and religion. He became a life-long adherent of the teachings of Swami Vivekananda and Paramahansa Yogananda. He helped Londons Radha Krishna Temple financially and also produced the single Hare Krishna Mantra. One can say that of The Beatles it appears that only George got India, says Sally Grossman, wife of the late Albert Grossman who managed the likes of Bob Dylan and Janis Joplin, on email from her home in Woodstock, US. Other than vigorously pursuing a five-decade-old interest in the baul music of Bengal, as is documented on Baularchive.com, a scholarly repository of her work and association with India, Sally once hosted George Harrison and his wife Pattie Boyd at their home. They came to stay at our house so as to visit Bob Dylan. We bonded immediately over India. We all knew India had seduced us, entranced us, educated us and broadened our horizons, writes Grossman. It was Boyd who introduced her husband and The Beatles to the Maharishi in 1967, which initiated the Fab Four into the Spiritual Regeneration Movement at Bangor in the UK.The main hall of the ashram, also called the Beatles Cathedral. Photo: Wikimedia CommonsThe global yogiBy the time The Beatles came to Rishikesh in 1968, they were worn out by the strains and stress of fandom. It was already a couple of years since the Beatles had renounced touring, tired and stretched as they were by thousands of screaming teenaged fans at concerts, which often interrupted the actual performance. In director Martin Scorseses documentary film George Harrison: Living In The Material World (2011), there is a dramatic moment when Lennon stops an arena concert to look up at the shrieking girls interrupting the bands performance. Shut up, he says firmly in the footage, Ill kill you. Wild car chases by fans, stalking and the occasional threat of bodily harm were already part of the Beatles experienceclearly the band was at the end of their tether. India, and meditation, possibly, came as an escape hatch to the other side of celebrity.Just prior to their arrival in Rishikesh, Brian Epstein, the bands longtime manager, died. The Beatles were consoled by the Maharishi, who they had met just days before Epsteins death, but were devastated nonetheless.Then there was the issue of drugs. A couple of years back, the band had its first taste of the notorious wonder drug LSD, as Harrison put it the Scorsese film. Widening the minds perception and altering ones consciousness through LSD was a key goal of the 1960s counterculture. It was no different for The Beatles. Even as he dropped acid near the door of a nightclub and took off on an incredible trip across time and space, Harrison was, by then, a student of Ravi Shankar. I had this lingering thought that just stayed with me after that, he says in the movie. And this thought was the yogis of the Himalayas. I had never thought about them...but suddenly this thought was in the back of my consciousness. It was like somebody was whispering to me, you know. The yogis of the Himalayas.It was the Maharishi who impressed upon The Beatles to publicly renounce drugs at a press conference. It was an experience we went through, McCartney is quoted as saying at the press conference in Philip Normans biography, Shout!: The True Story Of The Beatles (2004). Now its over. We dont need it any more. We think were finding new ways of getting there. At that juncture, it would have seemed that all roads, literally, spiritually and metaphorically, converged to get The Beatles down to Rishikesh.The global media followed the band till the barred ashram gate for it ticked the boxes of exoticism, Indian spiritualism, Ganges, Himalayas and the worlds most famous band, says Saltzman. While the Beatles trip triggered the arrival of Indian spirituality and yogic practices in Western consciousness with the sprouting of street corner yoga and meditation studios, the personality of the Maharishi, who had harped on the need for Transcendental Meditation to the Beatles, saw McCartney penning a ditty like The Fool On The Hill in 1967 for the bands Magical Mystery Tour album. On the other hand, Lennon went on to write the wry Sexy Sadie, an acerbic comment on the Maharishi (Sexy Sadie, what have you done/ You made a fool of everyone) and how ignominiously the Rishikesh visit ended for the band when there were allegations of sexual misdemeanour against the Maharishi.Though the allegations were never really proved, the infamy stuck, says Anand Shrivastava, nephew of the Maharishi. Shrivastava is also the vice-president of the New Delhi-headquartered Spiritual Regeneration Movement (SRM) Foundation of India. I dont know what led John Lennon to make the allegation, for the Maharishi was a bal brahmachari who led a pure life. Maybe Lennon was frustrated at something, says Shrivastava, on the phone from the Netherlands, where the Maharishi died in 2008, aged 90.Murals and graffiti on the Beatles ashram walls. Photo: Shamik Bag/MintThe cultural momentThe Maharishis Uttarakhand ashram was closed down by the states forest department in 1990 after its lease expired. It remained shut for 15 years and was opened to public only in 2015.Seekers from the West continue to throng Rishikesh and the ashram, drawn by the prospect of attaining spiritual salvation and helped by The Beatles lore. Take, for instance, Tejasvi Giri who was earlier Deja Cross. An entrepreneur from the US who also helmed multimillion dollar businesses, she renounced everything and came to Rishikesh. She was an eight-year-old growing up in California when she heard about The Beatles tryst with the Maharishi and Indian mysticism, another way of living that was difficult to fathom in a country where, back then, there was no culture of meditation, she says.Today, Giri, 58, is the founder-director of the Rishikesh International Film Festival, which in its second year is organizing a two-day event at the ashram to commemorate the 50th year of The Beatles visit. Beginning 16 March, the commemoration will see displays of photographs, presentations with slide shows, playing of songs and videos, Transcendental Meditation practice by schoolchildren, a ticketed tour of the ashram and a panel discussion centred around consciousness and creativity, among other events. Giri, who has been based in a village outside the touristy zones of Rishikesh, living close to the people, says, Ill be here only to be with the people.Ever since he first visited India and sought the curative powers of meditation at the ashram to overcome an estranged relationship, Saltzman, by his own reckoning, has been to India over 50 times. It wasnt easy for him to gain access to the ashram, where the Beatles along with other musicians like Donovan and Mike Love of the Beach Boys were staying.For the one week he was there, Saltzman slept in a tent pitched outside the ashrams tall periphery wall but was permitted to participate in the ashrams activities during the day. The meditation exercises gave Saltzman an insight into his own mind and soul; his intimate and candid photos of The Beatles gave the world a sneak peek into the bare and unvarnished side of celebrity lives. The 50th anniversary is culturally significant because it marks one of the few times famous celebrities, who were artistically and commercially successful, put their careers on pause to study and investigate a spiritual discipline for their personal enlightenment, explains Unterberger. They did this even knowing they would be ridiculed by much of the media. If their fans were unlikely to ridicule, many were puzzled. It also marked one of the first times that Western pop stars committed to spending time experiencing a non-Western practice and culture that was very different from what they had grown up with and that made their superstardom possible.This year, coinciding with the India release of the special 50th anniversary edition of his photobook, The Beatles In India, by Simon & Schuster, Saltzman will be back in India to complete the filming of his Beatles film, one which will bring in the elements of creativity, meditation, spirituality and love pivoted around Saltzmans stories from 1968.The 50th anniversary is culturally significant because it marks one of the few times famous celebrities, who were artistically and commercially successful, put their careers on pause to study and investigate a spiritual discipline for their personal enlightenment.- Richie Unterberger, Music critic and authorAnd in the endThe Rishikesh stint was possibly the first time in many years that Lennon and McCartney were staying next door to each other. This lead to an burst of creative camaraderie, says Miti Adhikari, who used to be the chief sound engineer at the BBCs Maida Vale Studios in London.Yet, despite the bonhomie, described by Norman as the group mind, Rishikesh, it can be argued, could well have widened the already-existing cracks of disagreement between the band members.An indication to that effect can be found in Lennons song India, India, one of two India-specific songs that he wrote in 1980, about his 1968 sojourn. In it, he sings: Im waiting by the river, but somewhere in my mind, I left my heart in England, with the girl I left behind. This was Yoko Ono, the Japanese avant-garde performance artist he had befriended in 1966. Lennon had travelled with his wife Cynthia to Rishikesh but would sneak out every once in a while to the local post office to collect the postcards that Ono would send him. These would usually consist of one word, Breathe, Norman mentioned to an amused audience at a session on The Beatles in India held at the Jaipur Literature Festival in 2017.Within a year of returning from Rishikesh, Lennon would divorce Cynthia and get together with Yoko Ono. Ono became a fixture at the studio sessions when The Beatles started recording the songs they had composed in Rishikesh for the White Album.Lennons Rishikesh songs cropped up again on The Beatles final record, Abbey Road, in 1969. Mean Mr. Mustard and Polythene Pam were fragments which he later disparaged as a bit of crap I wrote in India. The Beatles would disband in 1970.Whichever way you look at it, the ashram in Rishikesh remains a cultural signpost. Fifty years later, the weather-beaten, moss-covered and mouldy walls stand as mute witness to one of the most iconic moments in popular culture.Also Read:Beatles in India: A new life for John LennonA (far from) comprehensive list of Beatles coversMy sweet lords50 years of Beatles in India: How George Harrison brought Indian classical music to Western popIf you are a Beatles fan, heres the book for you"

I wonder how many people across the subcontinent, including those across post-colonial borders, will wear a touch of sunny yellow, eat a yellow laddoo or rasmalai or fly a kite on their roof with friends and family.Thats the fun cultural part once shared by communities. For Hindus, it remains the pleasant calendar opportunity to offer bright yellow flowers to the Jagadamba or mother goddess in her aspect as Sarasvati, the patron deity of knowledge and the arts. It is also the Hindu custom in many regions to recite the Yakundendu, a short and charming Sanskrit prayer of praise to Sarasvati.Why is yellow the colour of Vasant Panchami? Different regions have different theories. Some say it represents the colour of the mustard flower, others, the golden warmth of the Sun. Celebrating communities across the region appear to agree on the happy palette for the festival  tones of haldi-kumkum or turmeric-vermilion, offset by whites and greens.Beyond the frolic, Basant, as Vasant Panchami is known in West Bengal and parts of the north, is held to be spiritually significant. Just as the Earth awakes again to Spring, the human soul or consciousness is supposed to start shedding its accumulated baggage of negativity.Tradition is quite understanding of and realistic about human nature. It does not expect one to go cold turkey and banish worry, dislike and resentment on the spot. But the festival does seriously ask us to begin the process of renewing self-awareness, so that by the time Holi rolls around, about six weeks later (on March 1 and 2 this year), were ready to symbolically burn the junk inside our heads along with the household junk burnt in the traditional Holi bonfire.If you look closely at the Indian calendar, you will see that under the busy timetable of holy days, theres actually a plan to bond society through many opportunities to interact positively and pleasantly. Like any plan, it can and occasionally will go wrong. But its intentions are good.The biggest and best punya or merit gained on a holy day is when we are friendly and affectionate to all, and dont shortchange those to whom we owe money and manners. So the punya is of two kinds  one gained by doing the good things that build a cordial society and one gained by not doing the bad things that vitiate the atmosphere.Im sure there are many ways to become self-aware and shed negativity, and heres one that I am partial to. When one wakes, think of your chosen deity of whichever creed for two minutes. Be religious about the daily bath and clean, fresh clothes, kind deeds. Think over your day for five minutes at bedtime; say a prayer before sleep. Small steps towards a big result  a happier you.shebaba09@gmail.comThe views expressed are personal"

This year overproduction of paddy also led to a crisis among cultivators. (Express photo by Partha Paul) With farm incomes for crops like paddy coming down, farmers are going for cash crops like mustard and potato in West Bengal Howrah district. This year overproduction of paddy also led to a crisis among cultivators. (Express photo by Partha Paul)A drop in potato production from last years 110 lakh tonne to 80-100 lakh tonne this year is anticipated, but is unlikely to impact the staple crops prices, officials said.Speaking at the 53rd Annual General Meeting of West Bengal Cold Storage Association (WBCSA) in Kolkata on Monday, state Agricultural Marketing Minister Tapan Dasgupta and WBCSA president Patit Paban De shared the view that potato prices would not be hit due to an excess stock of about 9 lakh tonne from last year.Production of potatoes will be lesser in comparison to last year, but it will still be far more than the average consumption of the state. Also, last years stock will help in keeping the price of potatoes in check, said De.The area of cultivation for potatoes has been reduced by five per cent in the state this year. As per sources, the average land allocated for potato cultivation is around 4.6 lakh hectares, but this will be reduced to 4.4 lakh hectares this season.At present, out of 575 cold storage units in the state, 460 are dedicated to storage of potatoes. With a capacity of 70 lakh MT (metric tonne) and enhanced efficiency, these units have adequate space to store the states entire production. However, high crop production across the country severely impacted the market, and despite efforts from all parties involved, the stock of potatoes kept in cold storage could not be fully sold. This despite extending the normal period of storage till December, officials said.Pointing out that the annual consumption of potatoes in the state is around 65 lakh tons, including seeds, De appealed to the state government to encouraging marketing of the crop in neighbouring states and abroad right after the start of the season.We request government authorities to make timely plans for marketing of excess produce to avoid distress sales. Most of the old cold storage units operate with bank loans for various purposes. However, due to insufficient rent recovery, many are unable to repay the loans. We submit a rent revision prayer to the government every year. The current rate is Rs 152 per quintal for North Bengal and Rs 148 per quintal for South Bengal. We will try to bring it to Rs 180 per quintal, he said.When asked about this, Dasgupta told The Indian Express, They havent applied to us yet. However, rent revision depends on the instructions given by Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee We will ensure farmers get their dues. Last year, there was excessive stock, hence they didnt get good money.The minister also said the government is encouraging cold storage owners to turn to solar power.In order to maintain an eco-friendly environment, we are encouraging them to install solar power Solar units will reduce the operating cost. So far, this has been initiated in 10 cold storage units in Midnapore, Bankura, Hooghly, etc he said.However, De pointed out that investing in solar power units was a costly endeavour.To run a cold storage 200 kWh solar unit, Rs 1 crore is necessary. However, in absence of any subsidy for such a huge investment, there is a remote possibility of installing such units using ones own funds.For all the latest Kolkata News, download Indian Express App"

Farmers Still Cold to Nano Plot,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/was-the-singur-protest-for-nothing-farmers-still-cold-to-nano-plot/story-3cHpNuRnbOAuUGlJUmWlPK.html,2018-01-31,"More than a year after West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee gave back to farmers the land on which Tatas Nano car plant was built, a major chunk of the 997.11-acre plot remains uncultivated.Cattle graze on large swathes as weeds run wild. Crops barely cover about 250 acres of the reclaimed land, Hindustan Times found during a recent visit to Singur. My plot of land is unfit for farming, said Amar Santra, a resident of Khaserbheri village that was the epicenter of the two-year-long land agitation that saw the Tata group abandon the plant in 2008. Last year, the monsoon washed away most of the topsoil, baring the remains of a concrete structure several feet below, Santra said. Other farmers, too, had similar complaints.Most of the plot was fit for cultivation, Pradip Majumdar, the chief ministers principal adviser on agriculture, countered.Farming resumed on more than 500 acres within months of the buildings being razed, he said. We have proven it beyond doubt that the land can still yield gold. If there still are some patches with construction remains, well get things right, Majumdar said.Banerjee, who was at the forefront of the stir against land acquisition for the car plant, had in October 2016 sowed potato seeds during the handover in perhaps the first instance of an industrial land being reconverted to farm land in India.But farming is yet to catch up.Of the 56 mini-deep tubewells installed by the state government, only 20 are operational.In November 2017, the Hooghly district magistrate issued a fresh notice, inviting farmers to work in the fields. Only 50 of the 630 applicants turned up till January 8. In Khaserbheri, fields are a favourite hunting ground for scrap-dealers, as iron rods jut out of the ground. In Bajemelia and Gopalnagar villages, acres are still submerged under the water after last years monsoon.According to Beraberi panchayat chief Dipankar Ghosh, nearly a third of the land needed to be worked on. His views were echoed by KGD gram panchayat chief Tapan Bag. Some of those who had sown potato, lentils and mustard during October-November 2016 also farmed the monsoon paddy in 2017. However, after monsoon wrecked havoc, many of them refrained from sowing the winter crop, said Uttam Das, the agriculture coordinator of Gopalnagar gram panchayat.Singur MLA Rabindranath Bhattacharya said he had informed the authorities about the need to redevelop parts of the land. When asked why bulk of the plot had not been cultivated, Majumdar said, There could be other reasons, refusing to elaborate on them.Some locals, though, had the answer. Many farmers turned plumbers, bricklayers, carpenters and mechanics in the 10 years  the land was acquired in 2006 and returned in 2016  they were away from their fields.People like Dipankar Das, who is now a carpenter, are earning a lot more. He would continue with both  farming in the morning and carpentry noon onwards  once his plot was ready, Das said.None will admit this because it will raise questions on why were all so keen to get their land back if they were switching professions anyway, said a 57-year-old resident of Gopalnagar Ghoshpara, whose sons now work in a garment factory in Howrah. He didnt wish to be identified, fearing a backlash.Local politicians and a section of the administration are hopeful that more people will return to till the land when sowing season begins in March and the monthly compensation of Rs 2,000 will wind down. The dole was started by the Banerjee government in 2011 for farmers who refused the compensation in 2006."

Thats when fishing trawlers which venture out on trips return to shore with their catch. Each short trip needs 800 litres of diesel, while long trips require 1,600 litres. Around this time last year, say fishermen, diesel cost stood at Rs 58 a litre.Thus, the jump to over Rs 71 alitre has raised the fuel cost for a short trip by Rs 10,400 and twice for a long one. After each trip, trawlers return with a catch of 1.5 quintals to 2 quintals of Hilsa along with other fish. This alone, say fishermen, will push up the wholesale price of Hilsa by at least Rs 52 a kilogram. This Hilsa then has to be transported to Kolkata markets. This cost will rise as well, courtesy the sky-rocketing diesel prices.Those in the Hilsa trade, from fishermen to retailers, say that all this will push up the retail price of Hilsa by at least Rs 80 a kilogram. Fishermen say, around mid-June last year, the wholesale price of the fish weighing between 500 grams to 600 grams ranged from Rs 500 to Rs 600 a kilogram and the larger variety of Hilsa weighing between 800 grams to 900 grams was priced between Rs 800 to Rs 900 a kilogram. The retail prices ranged from Rs 800 to Rs 900 akilogram for the smaller Hilsa weighing 500 grams to 600 grams and Rs 1,100 to Rs 1,200 a kilogram for the larger variety. West Bengal Fishermens Association secretary Bijon Maity said, The hike of Rs 13 per litre of diesel will have a spiralling effect on the retail price of Hilsa."
