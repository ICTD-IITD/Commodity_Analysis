Sixty three year-old Sumitra Kalapatapu doesn't mind the work if that means well-roasted gourds stuffed with a tangy onion paste; something that will show to the world that Andhra food has more to it than biriyanis and fiery fish curries. Elsewhere, 34-year-old Deeptha Vivekanand is readying to host an authentic 'Mudaliar' meal to dispel the myth that Tamil food comes out of either Brahmin or Chettinad kitchens.Food is increasingly being used to subtly re-affirm cultural identities by a few Bengalureans. Their weapon?Secret stashes of grandma's recipes featuring uniqueness of their homelands or communities from Kashmir to Kerala. The back to the roots theme doesn't end here. These pop-up meals, advertised over social media, can be had at the chefs' homes while listening to the nitty-gritty behind a creamy Sindhi seyal chicken stew, or a spicy Coorgi sesame (elle) chutney or a decadent Parsi sali-per-eeda (potato crisps topped with eggs).""More than 100 people have come home after I began Sumi's Kitchen in March 2014 and 90% were not Telugu.It feels good,"" smiles Kalapatapu, who serves only Telugu Brahmin fare. No garlic or onion, except when it comes to the hardy karelas.Her joy is doubled by the fact that Andhra food is equated with nonvegetarian dishes in popular imagination. ""The food at my home is quite flavourful but isn't available at restaurants in Andhra Pradesh. Maybe it is because most restaurants are owned by communities that eat nonvegetarian food,"" says Kalapatapu.Vivekanand says she used to get really riled up when every morsel of food from the southern states were clubbed under 'south Indian'.Another thorn in the flesh is the popularity of Chettinad cuisine, which has been marketed well by eateries across the country. ""It struck me odd that in Bangalore, which has a strong Mudaliar community (a trading community), there were no restaurants with our food. Somebody has to try, ""she says.Food historian and hospitality industry veteran Suresh Hinduja also has taken it upon himself to be the custodian of Sindhi recipes. ""You might've heard that Sindhi cuisine has become an engendered species. It is forgotten and no restaurant in the country serves it,"" says Hinduja, who does pop-ups at home mainly for close friends.And when in doubt, they all go back to grandmothers or at least their home towns. Hinduja has done extensive research and has ''studied under grandma and mother,"" while Vivekanand got a master list of recipes from her grandmother in Chennai.The final list has been whittled down to vazhakkai vadai (banana fritters), mutton curry with radish, and paal bonda (fried snack in sweet milk).Kalapatapu gets her chillies and papad from Andhra to make the dishes as authentic as possible.Kalapatapu isn't being nostalgic when she says that Bengaluru chillies don't have the bite to give the right piquancy to her pickles. In international food circles, there is a word for what she is trying to say: 'terroir'. The French word literally means `soil' but indicates the taste of a dish created by climate and culture of a region. When food is mixed with heritage, and is able to embody the memories of people and places, it becomes `edible chronotype', writes Michael A Di Giovine in Edible Identities: Food as Cultural Heritage. Sometimes traditions are `invented' for the revitaliza tion of communi ties, he writes.Various regions in European Union have created terroir designations for classes of food while UNESCO has designated several European, Middle Eastern and Latin American cuisines as 'intangible cultural heritage'. While the question of what is authentic remains, to the eager visitors, such meals are quick culinary getaways. ""There was this guy from the north-east happily eating appam and stew at my home. We are all like foreigners in India, looking for some exotica,"" says Tresa Francis, who hosts Syrian Christian meals that belong to her native central Kerala.There is more to this trend that prompts startups like LikeMind and Platehopper to offer platforms to connect home chefs and clients. Food is just the spark, friendship and stories are the real items, says Apratim Buragohain of LikeMind, which hosts chefs like Francis and Vivekanand. If Gen X would've been happy having a blast with friends, millennials want to hang out with those who share their interest. ""Technology is enabling a subtle behavioural change, ""says Buragohain.IT professional Roshni Sen landed at Kalapatapu's to discover Andhra food and celebrate her husband's birthday with a healthy homely meal.She had also hoped to connect with people in a city that has become increasingly distant.First, there was a friendly dog. But what changed the course of the meal was curd. ""While serving food, aunty told me that curd will set fast in Bangalore if I put one dry chilly in the vessel, "" says Sen.Hardly scintillating party topic but it stayed. ""When you are staying in a strange city , you don't get to interact with people of your parents' or aunts' generation. I do miss that, ""she says.That's quite an edible memory."

The average wholesale onion prices, however, remained stable at the market.Sources from Lasalgaon APMC said, ""there were heavy rains in the morning at Lasalgaon. Therefore most of the farmers did not bring their produce for the auction at the market. Presently, the harvest of late kharif onions is in full swing. Moreover, the arrival of summer crop has also started in the market, but in low quantity. Around 15,000-18,000 quintals of onions are auctioned every day at Lasalgaon. But the arrival was low on Friday due to rains.The average wholesale onion price at Lasalgaon was recorded at Rs 700 per quintal on Friday, against the same price on Thursday. The minimum and maximum prices were recorded at Rs 400 and Rs 851 per quintal, respectively. Around 9,000 quintals of onions were auctioned at Lasalgaon on Friday, against 15,000 quintals auctioned on Thursday.Presently the onions arriving in the market if of late kharif crop that have a shelf life of less than 25 days. Hence farmers have no option but to sell the commodity at prevailing market rates. Because of this the average wholesale onion prices have declined by almost 50% from Rs 1,400 per quintal in December to Rs 700 per quintal today due to rise in supply as compared to demand. The arrivals of onions have also increased in Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka. As a result, demand from North India for Lasalgaon's onions has also reduced."

The prices of shallots that hovered around Rs. 18 per kg last month came down suddenly to Rs. 8 in Dindigul on Monday.Regular arrivals from Theni, Andipatti, Dharapuram and Udumalpet were good.With sufficient rainfall at the right time, the yield was high in major shallot production centres in the district now, said onion traders in the whole sale market.The market received 4,500 bags of shallots on Monday, of which the arrival from domestic production centres, especially Iyyalur, Eriyode and Gujiliamparai, was around 2,800 bags.Increase in production and arrivals from neighbouring districts caused a glut in the wholesale market. Exports too did not pick up much in the last one week owing to fresh arrivals of shallots. Exporters preferred matured, completely dry shallots. The shelf life of fresh onions was very short when compared to matured onions, traders added. The farmers were deeply worried over the sudden slump in shallot prices as the existing sale price would not even meet their plucking and transport costs.The traders opined that shallot prices would fall further in the months to come as harvesting would be completed in major production centres in the neighbouring districts.Normally, the wholesale market receives onion in large quantities from Nilakottai, Sengurichi, Gujiliamparai in Dindigul district, and Thuraiyur, Udumalpet and Namakkal, some of the major onion production centres in the State, and from Mysore in Karnataka.Rise in production, huge arrivals from other districts lead to a glut"

Despite this, India exports only 43,000 MT mangoes, which accounts for 0.2 per cent of the total production.Mango growers in the country are planning to increase the volume of export of their produce to the United States this year. Last year, India exported 271 metric tonnes of mangoes to the US. Officials hope the figure will go up to 400 tonnes this year.Succulent Indian mangoes take a circuitous route through the countrys onion belt to head for the US. A sprawling irradiation facility set up in Lasalgaon, located 240 km north of Mumbai and approved by the United States agriculture department, treats these mangoes before they are exported.Till a decade ago, Indian mangoes had been banned from the US market for a period of 17 years over fears that pests would be imported through these mangoes.It was only in March 2006 that the then US President George W Bush during his India visit signed an agreement allowing the import of Indian mangoes to that country.India cultivates mangoes on nearly 2.2 lakh hectares and has production in the range of 19.51 million tonnes. It accounts for nearly 40 per cent of the total mango production in the world. Nearly 30 varieties of mangoes are grown in India, with Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka having the highest production.Despite this, India exports only 43,000 MT mangoes, which accounts for 0.2 per cent of the total production.The major five importing countries of Indian mangoes are UAE, Bangladesh, UK, Saudi Arabia, and Nepal.Interestingly, in spite of the high returns that the US market gives, exports to that country did not look up once the ban on Indian markets was lifted.Officials at Krushi Utpadan Sanrakshan Kendra (KRUSHAK), the irradiation centre, however, said they hoped to export 400 tonnes to the US this year.The US market would fetch an exporter four times the price than to any other country. Last year, the price fetched per tonne of exports was Rs 70,360. In the US, it was Rs 2.55 lakh. It is the fear of maintaining standards that is keeping Indians away from this market. This year, we hope we will reach the 400-tonne mark to the US, said a Maharashtra State Agriculture Management Board official.The irradiation plant set up at a cost of Rs 8 crore in 2002 was initially meant to treat onions. The members of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service of the United States agriculture department had subsequently visited the plant and have a go-ahead for the facilitys compliance for mangoes too.Before 2007, Indian mangoes had for 17 years faced non-trade barriers, such as sanitary and phyto-sanitary (plant health) measures, from the US, which feared pests like fruit flies and weevils could be imported through mangoes.However, this mango quarantine through irradiation has allayed the fears. During irradiation, foods are exposed briefly to a radiant energy source such as gamma rays or electron beams. This not only helps in killing harmful bacteria but also increases the shelf life of the fruit.The facility built by the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre has a processing capacity of 1 tonne every hour and BARC charges Rs 500 to irradiate every tonne of mango.Varieties like Alphonso are too sweet for the palate of Americans. It is Kesar that sells in those markets. A single Kesar fetches close to a dollar. However the packing, quality maintenance and paper work involved puts off most traders from approaching the US market, said Shirish Jain, a Gujarat-based exporter of Indian mangoes.For all the latest Cities News, download Indian Express App"

With rising mercury, the cost of food basket is on the rise too. Due to dwindling supplies in the dry season, vegetable prices have gone up. Some items are costing double or close to it as compared to prices just a week ago.A week's vegetable supply for a family of 3 to 4 now comes for Rs300 to 350, which is more than the minimum wages fixed by the state government for an unskilled labourer at around Rs225 a day.Even as summer is making vegetables costlier, it comes at a time when rates of pulses, especially tur dal, have settled but only on the higher side. There are chances of a further increase in tur prices. Despite fresh supplies, not much respite is expected in the rates of wheat too, say sources in this business. The dry spell in the neighbouring Marathwada region is also having a slight impact on vegetable rates in the city, say a section of traders.Traders at markets like Gokulpeth and Fule market say this is the beginning, and another 20 to 25% increase in vegetable prices is expected in the days to come. A bout of unseasonal rains may make it worse, with rates further shooting up due to supplies being disrupted after that.The rates of almost all the vegetables have gone up by Rs10 a kg on an average over the last week, with Rs40/kg being the average price of any variety. However, there are certain vegetables like beans or lady fingers which have doubled. Brinjals of the smaller variety, which were in the range of Rs5 to 10 a kg are now Rs35 per kg, say traders.Sushil Shambarkar, a trader at Gokulpeth, said large part of the supplies come from other centres during summer since local sources dry up. Prices of beans have touched a high because of supply hitches at Chhindwara in neighbouring Madhya Pradesh, which is the major source. The rates will further go up in the coming weeks, he said.""Nagpur gets its supplies from Jabalpur, Chhindwara, Bhilai, Nashik and even Bangalore, apart from nearby villages. Some vegetables like pumpkin, coriander and cauliflower come from Nanded in Marathwada too. But supplies have entirely dried up this year due to the drought there,"" said Vijay Sonare at Gokulpeth.Nanded and other neighbouring districts contribute 10 to 15% of the total supply in Nagpur, which makes a considerable impact on the local rates, said Adul Sattar, a broker at Fule Market.On the foodgrains side, tur dal rates, which made headlines last year once again spiked by Rs10 a kg. This week tur dal was in the range of Rs132 to Rs115 with the bulk dealers. In neighbourhood stores, it is going at Rs140 to 130 a kg with some branded tur dal priced at Rs250 per kg too. ""The rates have gone up because farm produce markets were closed due to March ending. There is a possibility of some respite in the next week but rates may ultimately firm up, keeping tur dal rates at the same level,"" said Pratap Motwani, secretary of Itwari Wholesale Grain and Seeds Merchants Association.The tur production this year is less than last year, when tur dal was priced at Rs200 a kg, which means rates may further go up, say traders.Wheat prices are ranging from Rs2,500 to 4,000 a quintal depending on the variety. Fresh arrivals were low due to unseasonal rains in parts of Madhya Pradesh. As a result, new supply has not made much an impact in lowering the rates, said Motwani. Rice has been stable at Rs2,750 to 4,600 a quintal, he said.OUR TAKEAt present, not a single vegetable is available at affordable price. Usually in this season, price of potato and onion go down. But this year, we have no relief. The vegetables are becoming more and more out of reach of the common man. We fear that a further increase in the prices of petrol and diesel will affect the vegetable price hike moreAsha Mathur, 38, housewifeOver the past few months, we have witnessed at least 30-40% rise in vegetable prices. At a time when middle class families are already struggling with rocketing prices of cereals, the high vegetable prices are hitting the family budget hard. Lower middle class families are forced to compromise when it comes to providing nutritious diet to kids. The government needs to come up with a solution to provide relief from inflated prices of basic commoditiesManjari Joshi, 40, businesswomanWith summer approaching, prices of vegetables are only going to increase more. It is tougher for vegetarian families as green vegetables are the only source of nutrition for them. Veggies like capsicum, spinach and 'methi' which people usually prefer to eat in summer are also very costly. From cereals, potato, tomato, onion and green veggies  if everything is going to be costly, how does one expect a common man to survive?Purnima Singh, 44, teacherThe demand for fruits and vegetables is more in summer as people prefer drinking fresh juices. Such inflated prices are affecting people from all strata. This year particularly, the costs are too much on a higher side. To beat the price hike, I feel the best solution will be to eliminate selling of vegetables through middlemen. Sellers should directly buy vegetables from farmers. This will prove cost-friendly for customers as well as will be profitable for farmersResmi Umesh, 37, HeadmistressHousewives everywhere are struggling to balance their household budget due to the spiralling inflation. Even vegetables like French beans, capsicum, ladiesfinger, coriander are quite high. If vegetable price was low, it would have at least neutralized the out of reach prices of tur dal and other pulses. The government really needs to bring down the budget of kitchen, especially of basic food itemsSheela Brahmankar, 50, govt employee"

In fact, onion growers had got Rs. 2,500- 5,000 in October-November last year for their monsoon crop.What is ironic is that there are no buyers for a large quantum of produce even at the above price range of Rs. 1,200-1,500. This has resulted in heaps of onion produce remaining unsold at the Raichur Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) yard.We have spent around Rs. 25,000 for cultivating onion on one acre. We got better crop this year both in terms of quality and yield. Unfortunately, there is no good price in the market. Wholesale buyers are asking the crop for a throwaway price. How can we survive? asked Hanumayya, a farmer from Sasivegera village in Deodurg taluk.His produce in 45 bags, each having 50 kg of fine quality onion, has remained unsold at the APMC for the last two days. I have decided to sell the produce at whatever price the buyer asks, he added.Most of the onion growers in the AMPC yard were in a similar condition as onion is a perishable agricultural produce and there was no hope of recovery of price in the immediate future. They were left with no option other than selling their produce at whatever price they get as they cannot take their crop back to their villages incurring additional transportation costs. They sleep beside their onion heaps in open protecting their crop from pigs and cattle.According to the traders, glut in the market caused by heavy imports from Nashik in Maharashtra caused the dip in the price of onion. The traders are heavily importing onion from Nashik. Supply is greater than the demand. This caused the prices to crash, Nagaraj, a trader, said.Chamarasa Malipatil, state president of the Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha, expressed similar views. According to him, the government imported onion from different countries when the onion prices were high in the domestic market.Massive imports, much greater than the required quantity, has caused the glut in the market. Now, domestic farmers have to bear the brunt. Farmers are in a very pathetic condition as they are repeatedly hit hard by problems floods, drought, Bt cotton failure and now price crash,"" he said. He demanded that the government open onion procurement centres at APMCs and purchase the produce directly from farmers offering minimum support price."

The pathos of his surreal situation contrasted with his bathetic observations make you want to laugh and cry at once. The narrator-protagonist is at the intersection of several tragedies, and demonstrates a startling mix of nonchalance, despondence and an unaffected disengagement. In Ashokamitrans delineation, these conflicting emotions dont clash, they somehow all build up into a nuanced culmination.Another arresting trait of Ashokamitrans, seen in full flow in the short stories, is this poetic quality of suggestion. Not for him the clichd short story with a fast-paced plot and a clever denouement; instead, the short stories tend to trail off into quiet endings that leave you looking for more, and then play back in ones memory with a residual heat. Ashokamitran never brings his plot into a full circle, he will inscribe an arc and leave it at that  and his si lences are devastatingly impactful.The anthology Still Bleeding from the Wound mostly features stories set in urban landscapes -Madras, Secunderabad and Bangalore -and they capture the flavours of those cities from two-three decades ago with an ethnographers precision. Extreme emotions like violence (Children), frustration (Liberation), or even horror of the supernatural (The Colours of Evil) are presented with an intense minimalist style that evoke a shudder and empathy in equal measure. Intellectual and political commentary is never made explicitly in the narrative.There are excellent moments of wry humour, I didnt write those letters with regular ink; rather I wrote them with tears No, thats not quite accurate. The letters were intended to bring tears to the readers eyes, so it would be more precise to say that I wrote them with a pen dipped in onion juice(The Colours of Evil). This only heightens the readers involvement with the character, who laughs because the only other alternative is to cry . The existential con cerns of the music teacher who will never be a singer (Evolution) and the has-been politician (Waiting in the Dark) attest to the efficacy of Ashokamitrans gripping aesthetic, free of any figurative language or clever tropes.Ashokamitrans aesthetic universe is unique and does not submit easily to English literary parlance. His reticent style builds up a sustained intensity of feeling. He crafts crisp narratives with near-anthropological insight using the most ordinary characters in quotidian settings. And ironic humour surfaces in the most unexpected corners.Kalyan Ramans sensitive translations have captured these contours most effectively . His keen attention toward changes in register, and a courageous hand in translating certain colloquialisms (e.g. I didnt steal and all in Spinning wheel) are praiseworthy . The choice of retaining several words in the original Tamil to convey the right flavour is admirable, and the glossary is helpful as well. Furthermore, he has been a close observer of Ashokamitrans craft, and is a practiced and experienced hand at rendering the latter into English. Kalyan has succeeded exceptionally in translating Ashokamitran the stories as well as the silences."

But the battle between the Congress vice-president and the Union human resource development minister is far from over. The news is that a 13-year-old boy, Kaushal Shakya, who sold newspapers to make ends meet, has benefited from the war between Rahul and Smriti. In April 2013, Kaushal had a chance encounter with Rahul at a traffic signal in Bhopal. Rahul, dressed in kurta and jeans, was not interested in buying the Hindi daily that had splashed photographs, quotes, blurbs and headlines about him. Instead, he wanted to know more about Kaushal's life. ""Akhbar kyon bechte ho? School kyun nahi jaate? (Why are you selling newspapers? Why don't you go to school?)"", asked Rahul. Kaushal had replied that he goes to a government school, but sells newspaper in his spare time to help his family of five. He added that he wanted to become a doctor, and that his farm-labourer father did not get work on all days. ""Akhbar le lijiye. Aap ki khabar hai (Please buy a newspaper, you are in the news),"" he insisted. The next day, Kantilal Bhuria was sent with an offer to fund Kaushal's education. But in 2014, Bhuria got shunted out and the new state chief, Arun Yadav, claimed that he had no clue about the commitment that had been made to Kaushal, who had been forced to stop his school education. The stage was now set for Irani's intervention. When the Union HRD minister came to know of Kaushal's plight, she swung into action and directed a Kendriya Vidyalaya to admit him and bear the expenses of his education. Rahul, understandably, is upset with Irani winning the honours in this round. Nervous Congressmen in Madhya Pradesh are preparing to offer explanations to their boss. But Kaushal, surely, is not complaining. Strategic delay Many senior politicians would be happy to accept a gubernatorial position. But Najma Heptullah is not among them. There are whispers that Heptullah is quietly resisting moves to send her to Raj Bhavan. She is apparently using informal channels to plead her case. Heptullah, reportedly, wants to spend one more year as a minister. There is a specific reason behind Heptullah's request. Vice-presidential elections are slotted for next year. Given the current electoral college strength of the National Democratic Alliance, it is expected to come up trumps. Sources close to Heptullah are of the opinion that her status as a senior minister would help her exercise greater clout in the impending bargains than as a governor. More news The medium, as the wise ones say, is as important as the message. Soon, all Union ministries are set to have YouTube channels in a bid to promote their achievements and schemes. Some believe that the idea of setting up dedicated platforms on YouTube has come from the top. There is reason to believe the conjecture. Top guns of the government, such as Arun Jaitley, Nitin Gadkari and M Venkaiah Naidu, have already launched their ministries on this popular medium. Other ministers, a little bird tells us, are also conducting trial runs. There is also a proposal to issue TV licences to almost all ministries on the model of the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha TV channels. The Union finance and shipping ministries are all set to launch channels that would beam policies, programmes and speeches of the respective ministers. Once these channels start their operations, instead of the customary press release, ministers or officials would simply call up these dedicated channels to issue news bites. Joint-secretaries, too, would be authorized to participate in debates and discussions on these channels. It is also learnt that the Centre may even provide a special satellite to beam these channels exclusively. If these grand plans do see the light of day, one wonders what is going to happen to the hapless reporters on these specific beats. Still searching Jairam Ramesh, the former Union rural minister, is a worried man. His term in the Upper House is coming to an end in June but the Congress is struggling to find a seat for him. The only state from where Ramesh can get elected is Karnataka. The Congress is in power in that state. But a large section of the state unit is against Ramesh's nomination from Karnataka. The high command has already been intimated that Ramesh, who has represented Andhra Pradesh, cannot be accommodated from the state for the polls. This only means that his search for a safe seat is not yet over. FOOTNOTEFood for thought The India Water Week 2016 was held between April 4-8 at the Vigyan Bhavan and the Pragati Maidan. A large number of experts from India and abroad participated in the event and shared their experiences and expertise in such fields as water management, technical and sociological interventions to achieve water security as well as the creation of assets on a participatory basis. The delegates were served vegetarian food that was devoid of onion and garlic in keeping with the tradition of navratas. The Union minister for water resources, Uma Bharti, was heard recounting with glee how she had personally ensured that vrat (fast)-compliant food is served for the guests. But not everyone was happy with the menu. Some delegates chose to skip their meals so that they could eat what they preferred at the hotels."

The vegetable that made headlines last year when its price touched Rs70 a kg is today selling for just Rs5 a kg in the bulk market. In neighbourhood vegetable markets, the rates are ranging from Rs14 to 16 a kg, less than half the price last April.Hoping to get higher prices like last year, farmers had increased the area under onion cultivation. This has led to a deluge of supply, bringing the prices down. The production has gone up in all onion growing states like Gujarat, Maharashtra and Karnataka. White onions are being sold at Rs5 to 6 in the wholesale market and it is Rs7 to 8 for the red variety, said a source in M/s Afzal Trading Company, a firm based at Kalamna agriculture produce market yard. In a month, the rates have gone down by Rs2 per kg, he said.The current rates are not even enough to meet the production cost for farmers, who need to get at least Rs6 to 7 a kg to break even, sources said.Vijay Rathore, a cultivator from Dhule district, said now farmers have begun holding on to the stock. ""Even I have stored around 200 quintals in a chali (bamboo enclosure used to store onions). I will wait for the rates to go up,"" he said The cost of each chali comes to around Rs25,000, he said.There is a glut in Karnataka too, which is the second major source of supply for traders in Nagpur. B Ravishankar of M/s Ravi Trading Company said the southern crop, which starts in July-August is exhausted by January in the normal course. However, the arrivals are continuing even in April and are expected to last for one more month. This shows that the prices will remain subdued in the near future. In Bangalore, the bulk rates have touched Rs5 a kg, he said.Potatoes, which are traded along with onions, are however getting slightly costlier. The rates opened at Rs600 per 50kg at the start of the season at Mainpuri in UP, a major supply centre. As against this, it was Rs400 last year when the production was relatively low.A trader at M/s Aditya Kumar and Co in Mainpuri said this is because this year the potato growers are holding on to the crop and allowing only limited supplies into the market. So, despite higher output the rates have remained firm.A trader at Ram Aloo Bhandar at Gokulpeth market said potatoes are costing Rs20 a kg and the rates are inching up gradually. At this time of the year, when fresh supply is available, the rates are usually in the range Rs12 to 14 a kg. However, this year the commodity is in shortage at the bulk market, he said."

Bharamagowdra collected, collated and documented his experience as an organic farmer in an agricultural industry that was increasingly becoming dependent on chemical pesticides.The noted farmer passed away three months ago, but not without passing down his knowledge to future generations.His experience with the rich rain-fed black cotton soil in north Karnataka was recorded by the Institute for Cultural Research and Action (ICRA) and subsequently brought out as a book in Kannada DD Bharamagowdra BadukuBesaya, Savayava Krushikana Mahaan Payana (in English: The Organic Farmers Notable Journey).It is a detailed take on the art and science of organic farming that can serve as a manual for farmers,"" said environmentalist Yellappa Reddy at the recent launch of the book.Bharamagowdra was one of the most seasoned farmers of Gadag.He had been through a roller-coaster ride with respect to dealing with chemical and organic farming.His father Byamana Gowdas family grew more than 40 crops with traditional wisdom guiding their 'inter, border and mixed cropping philosophies'.The family is said to have been the foremost in bringing onion and byadgi chilli to that region said V. Gayathri, who transcribed, compiled and edited the newly released book that traces Bharamagowdras relationship with soil.After completing his BSc., Bharamagowdra was inspired by the green revolution and was drawn to chemical-dependant agriculture. The saga of his return to organic farming after seeing his soil go bereft of nutrients is what makes the book a veritable manuscript, says Gayathri.Bharamagowdras association with Institute for Cultural Research and Action started in the 1980s when he used to be in touch with P. Babu, one of the earliest functionaries and promoters of organic farming.He later contributed to ICRAs bimonthly magazine Sahaja Saguvali, which Ms. Gayathri edits.ICRA recorded Bharamagowdras know-how. The project involved meticulously transcribing his oral records. Although I edited the book, I was careful not to disturb his style of dialect and vocabulary so that farmers could relate to his calling, said Ms. Gayathri.The 325-page book in two parts starts with Bharamagowdras early memories, the agricultural practices before the green revolution, the onslaught of fertilizers before the genesis of the organic movement in Karnataka.The second part contains 17 articles detailing the author's experiments in dry land organic agriculture.The ecological vision of Bharamagowdra is significant in the context of climate change and distress in agriculture."

While farmers should get high price for their produce, consumers should get quality produce at a fair price.Kammaradi said, Only 41 per cent of agricultural produce are being sold at Agricultural Produce Marketing Committees (APMCs) in the state, while the rest are being sold at villages to private traders. Even after 60 years, we could not bring at least 60 per cent of the produce under market purview. The market should go to farmers rather than farmers coming to the market. This could bring a large quantity of produce under the market purview.He said the present minimum support price (MSP) prescribed for crops by the Centre was inadequate and did not meet the actual expenses of farmers.The state government should take measures to prevent the sales of agricultural produce below MSP in APMCs by giving statutory status to MSP. Many crops like onion and coconut do not get MSP, he pointed out.Kammaradi told educational institutions to have an official tie-up with KAPC to boost the farming sector.Managing Director of Rashtriya e-Market Services (ReMS) Manoj Rajan, former director of Institute of Development Studies, the University of Mysore, H S Gopala Rao, former director of Madras Institute of Development Studies V K Nagaraj, former vice chancellor of the University of Agricultural Sciences P G Chengappa and former chairman of KAPC S Bisaliah were present."

Water scarcity has affected production, thus affecting inflow into the city. The upward spiral of prices is likely to prevail for at least a month. The quality of vegetables available, however, has largely been unaffected.While tomatoes are selling for as much as Rs 60 per kg in some parts, prices of beans, cluster beans, lemons, green chillies, ginger and garlic too are skyrocketing. French beans are selling for a whopping Rs 150 per kg in many area. Kitchen regulars like ladyfingers, brinjal, cauliflower, bitter gourd and bottle gourd are commanding at least 30% more than their usual rates.Officials of the Agriculture Produce Market Committee attributed the the surge in prices to diminished supply from regions supplying to Pune.Anna Gule, in charge of the fruits and vegetables sub-section, estimates that inflow of vegetables has dropped by almost half. Warning of a further hike in prices, he said, ""Most vegetables reach us from Nashik and Karnataka and the drought and water scarcity is wreaking havoc on the farms. The inflow is unlikely to increase for at least a month, till the monsoon sets in and farmers are able to reap more abundant produce.""Supply of vegetables sourced from within Pune district has not not been affected as much as that from Solapur or Satara, said Amol Tambe, cofounder of a company selling agricultural produce at farm rates in the city. ""Farmers in Solapur are really strapped for water, which is supplied just twice a week. The situation is similar in Satara district, from where Pune gets its beans. There is a sharp drop in output and this demand-supply gap is causing the prices to escalate,"" he said.Prices have gone up more in the last two weeks, said Anup Gupta, a retailer on Sus Road, who admits that his sale has largely remained unaffected. ""Tomato prices have shot up since the week began. Prices of most other vegetables, too, have increased more in the last two weeks.

But, in other places, people are yet to venture out, since they are waiting for a couple of bouts of heavy pre-monsoon showers to start work. In the first fortnight of May, Ballari received an average rainfall of around 24.6 mm as against the average normal rainfall of 22.5 mm. The sowing target for the kharif season in the district is around 3.65 lakh hectares of which 2.09 lakh ha is rain-fed and 1.55 lakh is irrigated.In Haveri and Dharwad district, the situation is not very different. While Agriculture Department officials say the climate is conducive to begin farm activities, not many have completed pre-sowing preparations. Unpredictable climate has delayed the beginning of farm activities, said Basavaraj from Guttal in Haveri.In Raichur district, farm activities have begun thanks to early and good rainfall, and ploughing began last week. Agriculture Department officials said around 40 per cent of the lands in rain-fed areas, particularly in Lingasugur, Deodurg and Raichur taluks, are already prepared for sowing cotton, red gram, bajra and other crops.In the irrigation belt across Sindhanur and Manvi taluks, farmers have prepared their fields for sowing green gram, hoping to harvest it before the transplant of paddy begins.In Chitradurga, however, the majority of the onion farmers have prepared their fields for sowing in anticipation of good rainfall.

Selvaraj, general secretary of Chennai Koyambedu Periyar Market Tomato Merchants Association, says beans sold at Rs.80-100 per kg at Koyambedu wholesale market on Friday. Staple vegetables such as onion (Rs.15-20) and potatoes (Rs. 20) were cheaper than shallots (Rs.40) and tomatoes (Rs.60).The price of beans has been steadily climbing because supply to the Koyambedu wholesale market has fallen drastically. Usually, we get around 10 to 15 lorry-loads everyday, but it has fallen to four-five loads, Mr. Selvaraj says.The seasonal rain in Karnataka and the belts along Hosur that account for the bulk of beans production has damaged the crop.The price of beans may not fall till May-end and after that it will hover around Rs.60, he says.As for tomatoes, he says prices will stabilise in the coming weeks when production picks up in Maharashtra and, within a couple of months, in Theni, Udumalpet and Dindigul."

Meanwhile, as demand from northern states is up, Coimbatore is running low on vegetable stock.All these factors have led to a steady rise in prices since March. Now the prices have reached unprecedented levels. A kg of beans which sold for 40 in April hovers around 90 now. Onion and tomato prices have also increased three fold.

""The price forecasting scheme of centre for agricultural and rural development studies (CARDS), TNAU, has analysed the farmgate prices of small onion prevailed in Dindigul market for the past 13 years. Results revealed that the farmgate price for good quality small onion will be around Rs32-35 per kg during July-August, and touch Rs50 per kg with the onset of monsoon,"" said a press release issued by TNAU.Small onion is one of the most important commercial vegetable crops grown in southern India. It is predominantly cultivated in states such as Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Odisha.In Tamil Nadu, Dindigul, Tirupur, Perambalur, Trichy and Namakkal are the major shallot producing districts. The state faces a tough competition from Karnataka in this segment.The bulb vegetable occupies nearly 75% of the total onion produced in the state with a productivity of 12 tonnes per hectare. The crop is majorly cultivated during May-June and October-November. Major varieties under cultivation are CO 1, CO2 and CO (On) 5. Of these, CO (On) 5 is most preferred for export. Major export destinations include Sri Lanka, Singapore, Malaysia and Gulf countries.Small onion has started arriving at Dindigul market from Mysuru and the flow would continue till July. The demand for small onions harvested from nurseries is high in Dindigul market owing to its size which is bigger than other ruling varieties. This is also used as seed material for the ensuing season. The crop has also started arriving from Udumalpet, Dharapuram, Thuraiyur and Namakkal to the market."

The result is a glut that made the vegetable dirt-cheap this monsoon.In Ratlam mandi, the price dipped to 20 paise a kg four months ago. Frustrated farmers abandoned onions, which were left to rot in quintals on roadsides. Identical onion rate were prevalent in the Neemuch market in mid-April. The state government stepped in, well aware of the role onions can play in politics as much as with the economy. Soaring onion price was a major factor behind the BJPs debacles in the 1998 assembly elections in Delhi, Raj as than and Madhya Pradesh when the party-led NDA ruled the Centre.A cautious chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan announced in early June the procurement of onions at Rs 6 a kg from farmersmany of whom were selling the crop below Rs 1 per kg. Never has the 1956-formed state bought a vegetable, authorities claim.The Madhya Pradesh State Cooperative Marketing Federation (MarkFed) purchased 10.40 lakh quintals of onions from farmers. Already loan-burdened, their woes continued. From remote areas, farmers transported onions to mandis, only to be rejected for poor quality. The state intervened again, and ordered all mandis to buy onions. But it was late.FRETTING FARMERSKallu Kurmi of Newada village in Rehli tehsil of Sagar district has half his onions rotting. Sagar mandi (50 km away) didnt take my produce, he says. Im left with 300 gunny bags of onions.This, despite Union minister for food Ram Vilas Paswan announcing in May the purchase of 15,000 tonnes of the bumper crop. MarkFed bought onions at Rs 6/kg. We did it till end-June, by when rains came and made storing difficult, says its managing director BM Sharma.Former state agriculture director GS Kaushal attributes the farmers plight to administrative shortsightedness .The government should have built storage facilities , he notes .They arent expensive for onions. In the end, traders, middlemen and corporate houses gain, points out Kaushal. The farmers sells onions cheap, the consumer buys it at high prices.OUT OF TUNE?Kausal notes that Maharashtra is the lone state that has worked upon providing storage facility to onion farmers. If Madhya Pradesh could spend more than Rs 60 crore on the purchase of this crop from the farmers, why cant it spend some amount on space to store onions? he asks. Not working in this direction, the expert says, only helps in to create a perpetual situation where farmers get less and consumers pay moremuch to the benefit of the links in between.Madhya Pradesh has not emulated a nearby state, where hoarding of onions beyond a stipulated limit is banned and punishable. The Te lang ana Onion Dealers (Licensing, Storage and Regulation) Order, 2016, warrants license to sell the crop and a minimum retail price for it.In July last year, the central government extended its ban on stockpiling beyond the stipulated amount to curb prices of onion. ICAR 2014-15 data ranks Madhya Pradesh as the third-largest oniongrowing stateafter Maharashtra and Karnataka. The central Indian state produced 28,42,000 tonnes of onion in 1,17,000 hectares of land.POLITICAL SHOTSThe Opposition Congress says the onion fiasco has exposed the government s failure in making agriculture profitable.Deepti Singh, the partys state spokesperson, said the Chouhan government failed to notice the need for stronger onion storage facilities despite knowing that the farmers had gone to sow the seeds in large scale .The laxity turned out to be nightmarish for the common people , she added.The partys MLAs walked out of the state assembly recently, flaying the government for selling onion at Rs 4 per kg when the market price was Rs 10.Party legislator Jaivardhan Singh alleged the government was not paying the farmers money for the onion sit purchased. You bought onion worth Rs 62 crore from 40,000 farmers, but paid them only Rs 23.95 crore, he told treasury benches.Minister of state for cooperatives Vishwas Sarang said the government sold 7,000 quintals of onions in two days. We floated tenders to sell onions, but got quotes as low as 60 paisa to Rs 3.16 per kg. That is why we sold onions at Rs 4/kg, he reasoned. The balance amount will reach farmers in a week or so.TOUGH TO DISPOSERecently, the government asked the district collectors, jail administration and departments running government hostels to buy onions. Some collectors ordered employees to purchase at least 50 kg of onion per head. MarkFed is to sell onions at fair-price shops across the state. There will be open auction, too. As of now, 7000-8000 quintals of onion is being disposed of daily, says Sharma. If onions have brought tears in the eyes of the farmer, the government is equally worriedthough for a different reason. For instance, not long ago, the Chouhan government faced allegations from the Delhi government over rise in the prices of this bulbous vegetable so essential to the cuisine of people of all classes.That was in 2013, when Haroon Yusuf, who was food and civil supplies minister in the Sheila Di ks hit cabinet, attributed the soaring onion rates in the national capital to deliberate hoarding by Madhya Pradesh. The minister went on to claim that it was done at the instance of the Delhi unit of the BJP for political gains ahead of assembly elections. The MP government rubbished the charge, calling it baseless."

The farmers said that the price of onion has been almost stagnant since the harvest of the last summer crop. Onion prices had fallen back then. They have not picked up. The fall in price is mainly due to heavy imports. Our governments are always ready to suffocate domestic farmers to satisfy their imperialist masters, said Amaranna Gudihal, the State secretary of KRRS.The farmers also submitted to the APMC authorities two copies of a memorandum, one addressed to the Chief Minister and the other to the Prime Minister.They have demanded minimum support price of Rs. 3,000 a quintal for A-grade onions, Rs. 2,500 for B-grade onions, and Rs. 2,000 for C-grade onions.Need interventionThe States intervention is required in this time.

But the possibility of both drop in yield and crash in prices is staring at us since several other States are bound to see a glut in production due to good monsoon unlike Karnataka, which is reeling under dry conditions. Agricultural produce from such States is bound to arrive in Karnatakas markets leading to reduction in prices, KAPC Chairman T.N. Prakash Kammaradi, said.Speaking on the sidelines of a workshop organised in association with University of Horticultural Sciences-Bagalkot (UHS-B), he said crops that are bound to be affected by the phenomenon of drop in yield as well as crash in price are paddy and various pulses, including toor dal, Bengal gram and black gram. The commission had written to the government suggesting the need for watching the situation and providing minimum support prices to pulses if their prices dropped drastically, he added. The situation could improve, however, if there was an improvement in rainfall. Pointing out that rainfall was encouraging in the beginning of the monsoon period, he said: Hide-and-seek by monsoon has upset the predictions related to agriculture production.The commission has also decided to write to the State government to take up the issue with the Centre to provide green track facility of unhindered railway connection from the onion belt of Chitradurga to the export hub of Kolkata to help easy transportation of onion whose price is declining.Expressing concern that there was no real-time data related to production of agriculture and horticulture production, he welcomed the suggestion by farmers to set up farm kiosks at every village panchayat to get such a data and to co-ordinate with farmers.Hide-and-seek by monsoon has upset the predictions related to agriculture production T.N.

Many could not even recover the cost of cultivation, say traders.Encouraged by high price it fetched last year, many farmers around Nagpur and Bhandara also went for the crop. This added supplies to the already overflooded market. The farmers at traditional onion growing centres had also increased the area leading to a glut. Many traders and even growers have begun selling bags of onions grown in nearby areas at roadsides around the city, said traders at Kalamna.According to Jaiprakarsh Wasani, the rates were ranging from Rs5 to 8kg. It is a fall of 10% within a week. Fresh crop from Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka has begun arriving while there still is a major backlog of previous season's stock from Maharashtra . There is no chance of prices improving in coming months, though a further reduction could not be predicted, said Wasani.""Farmers have been left with nearly 25% of the carry forward stock. The situation will worsen as fresh crop begins arriving, as there will be a less demand for the old stock,"" he added.A representative of from M/s Afzal Trading Company at Kalamna said there had been overproduction in almost all centres across the country. Lately even farmers around Nagpur have begun growing onions. With hardly any margins left at the current rates, many traders are preferring to sell such locally grown produce out of the market area, he said.There will be hardly any gap in arrivals this years. By Dussehra , onions from Dhule will being reaching the market followed by that from Nashik during the Diwali festival. This ruled out chances of rates firming up, said Wasani."

Unable to transport onions to Tamil Nadu, Karnataka now has more supply than demand, leading to a drastic fall in prices. At the APMC Yard in Yeshwantpur, one of the biggest yards in the state, traders are selling onions for just `1 per kg.Protests over releasing Cauvery water to Tamil Nadu have hit the trade of onions, foodgrains and other essential commodities between the two states.According to traders in the APMC Yard, Tamil Nadu is the main buyer of onion and garlic produced in Karnataka. Tamil Nadu buys 150 to 200 truckloads of onions every day from Karnataka.Paramesh, president of State APMC Yard Workers Union, told Express, Since this is one of the biggest yards in the state, usually, there are 10 to 15 lakh people here every day. But ever since the Cauvery agitation started, the number of people has come down by 30 per cent.According to traders in the market, onion is the worst hit. Onions have a short shelf life. Since the protests started, the onions that were in stock have started to rot. So we are selling them at `1 per kilo. Good quality onions cost `6 to `8 per kg.Nandeesha, a trader at APMC Yard, said, Some of our truck drivers are stuck midway and are forced to throw away the rotting onions.The rice market is also affected to a great extent. According to the traders, Karnataka sends some 200 to 250 truckloads of rice to Tamil Nadu daily.Though we are ready to send the load, the drivers are scared to cross the border. So we are stocking it up and will send it once the situation is normal, rice merchant Shivanna said."

The traders halt and look over the merchandise. A market committee employee calls out the reserve price: 400! Eyes roll, unspoken words seem to pass between the traders. Then the bidding starts: 1! 11! 13! 17! In less than 30 seconds, the auction is over. The farmer gets 17 rupees over the reserve price, Rs.417 per quintal (100 kg). A pittance at any given time, more so now when compared to prices last year.A trader-controlled marketNo matter how united the farmers are, no matter how hard they fight for a better price, they turn into mute spectators in front of the traders when auction begins. The auction is dictated by the traders with money and considerable political clout. Traders decide the price, farmers accept it without protest.The market complex has a huge parking space for the lorries. Sometimes there are up to 1,000 vehicles at a time. The otherwise deserted place comes alive twice a day. The first auction of the day starts at around 10 a.m. and the second at 3 p.m. Depending on the number of vehicles, the auction can stretch from an hour to three hours.Once the rate is fixed, the group of traders moves immediately to the next vehicle. The farmer, left with the price decided by the group, starts collecting the onions he has dropped on the ground. An official from the market committee approaches him with a receipt, bearing the auction rate, traders name and farmers name. With a receipt in hand and onions in the vehicle, the farmer then proceeds to the godown where the weighing process takes place. As per the rules laid down by the market committee, the farmer must get the payment before the end of the day, which is largely followed.After the produce is dropped off at a shed in the complex, the traders take control of it. Workers start segregating the onions according to the quality and the packaging begins. Vehicles are loaded with the produce to be sent off to cities or to different States. Traders then get into a huddle to firm up the retail price of the produce  adding their profits  with nary a concern for the farmer and the price demanded by him. The operation is bloodless and smooth.Barely breaking evenWhile onion is one of the major crops in this belt, farmers also cultivate grapes, soya bean, sugarcane, and ginger. Speaking out against the cartel of traders is not easy when the farmer is dependent largely on the onion crop, as it may result in traders ganging against him (or her) by dropping rates for his produce.Official data from the Lasalgaon Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) says that this years prices  between Rs.500-Rs.800/ql., down from Rs.970-Rs.3,786/ql.  are the lowest in the last five years. This year, Rs.1,020/ql. (in June) was the highest rate given to farmers, compared to Rs.6,326/ql. in 2015-16, and Rs.2,626 in 2014-15.Growing onions costs between Rs.50,000 and Rs.80,000 per acre, and a cultivated acre yields not more than 100 ql. With this years average selling price at Rs.728/ql., an acres worth of onions would get the farmer around Rs.72,800. This sees some farmers barely break even; many lose money.Small wonder that Milind Darade, who owns 13 acres of land, is furious. This is the only industry where producers have no right to decide the price of their product, the onion farmer from Karanjgaon, Nashik district, says. Isnt it cruel? Shouldnt we get angry? The week before The Hindu caught up with him at the Saikheda sub-market committee, Darade was given a humiliating price for his produce: Rs.5/ql., or 5 paisa/kg. If that was not bad enough, Maharashtras Minister for Co-operation, Subhash Deshmukh, said on a live television show that his onions were rotten. Let me give you some information, he says indignantly, this is the onion you eat at a restaurant. Just peel off two layers and you would wonder whether it was really rotten.Darade has preserved the official paper from the market committee with the offered rate; he has laminated it to ensure it doesnt get dog-eared. He says that he was so angry that he refused to sell his onions and brought the load, some 10-11 ql., back to his farm to use as fertiliser. But, he says, When I calmed down, it dawned upon me that I must use it to highlight the plight of onion farmers.Supply-demand mismatchSimplistically put, there was a shortage last year, and this year has seen record onion cultivation. Abundant supply has brought the prices down. The farmers, though, are used to this kind of fluctuation. They dont blame the bumper crop and supply-demand equation; they say its the traders who are conspiring against them and the government has done little  or the wrong things  to help.To understand the current crisis for farmers, we need to step back a little.India has three onion crops a year. Early kharif (the crop sowed in the monsoon) onions come to market between October and December. Onions from the rangda, or late kharif, crop arrive from January to March. The winter or rabi crop is up for sale from April to May. Usually, some parts of the rabi crop are stored for a few months to fill the gap from May to October. Traditionally, prices rise from July to October; official data show that wholesale rates rise by as much as Rs.1,000/ql., even Rs. 1,500, later reflected in the retail market with an increase of Rs.5-Rs.10/kg for consumers.In 2014-15, the onions took a hit following a hailstorm in North Maharashtra which, in turn, affected their storage value. With many rotting, the onions that did make it to market commanded high prices.Then the drought of the summer just past played a role too; many sugarcane farmers switched to the less thirsty onion this year. The onion cultivation area in the State has almost doubled in year 2015-16, says Nanasaheb Patil, Director, National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India Ltd. (NAFED). Farmers hoped that they will get last years rate  close to Rs.3,000-Rs.4,000/ql.  which did not happen, as production increased in huge proportions.India is the worlds second-largest onion producer (after China) with 26.79 per cent of the planets land under onion cultivation and 19.90 per cent of its production. Maharashtra is Indias largest producer, with a 32.45 per cent share of total onion production, and in turn, Nashik district in north Maharashtra accounts for with 41 per cent of the States onion harvest. According to the Directorate General of Commercial Intelligence and Statistics (DGCIS), India produced 203.33 lakh metric tonnes (MT, 1,000 kg) of onions in 2015-16, up from 189.28 lakh MT in 2014-15. Lasalgaon, Asias biggest onion market, received around 32,680 MT in the previous fiscal year. Five months into this year, it has received 10,874 MT.To make matters worse for Maharashtras farmers, other States  notably Gujarat, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka  have reported higher onion yields.Holding on for a better dayAside from the production glut, another important factor was a 40-day strike by traders in July and August, opposing the State governments decision to free agricultural market committees from government regulations. With no outlet for their rabi onions, farmers had no option but to store them and wait for the strike to end. In addition, thanks to the low prices, some farmers are choosing to not bring their onions to the markets, and instead are storing them away hoping an artificial scarcity later in the year will pay off for them.This strategy, however, comes with its own dangers: that of the crop rotting or the onions sprouting. Malti Bodke of Bhuse village points to her rotten onions with disgust. How long can we store them? Its been almost four months. Once the onions start sprouting, they lose weight, and it becomes difficult to get a higher price.The farmers also say that the traders are colluding to cheat them. Its a cartel of traders which decides the rates and once the market reopened, they ensured prices didnt cross Rs.1,000/ql., says Rajaram Fafale, from Maralgoi village.The strike gets blame for the glut. But did trade actually stop? Officials and traders seem to want consumers to believe that, but farmers say it never really stopped. Darade says that opportunistic traders discreetly approached farmers and quoted lowest possible rates. Farmers, thinking it was better to sell, even at a low price, rather than keep them and let them rot, did sell.Three years ago, when the farmers were getting Rs.4,500-Rs.5,000/ql., retail onion prices reached Rs.90/kg., which resulted in protests from the then-opposition parties, as well as consumer organisations, in Delhi, Mumbai and other major cities, accusing the United Progressive Alliance government of failing to protect consumers.The governments first step was to increase the Minimum Export Price (MEP) to $1,150/MT. This made it difficult for Indian exporters to compete in international markets; whatever stock was available was diverted to the domestic market, which brought prices down. By March 2014, when the late kharif crop got to market, prices had dropped to less than Rs.1,000/ql. in the wholesale market, and consumers got theirs at Rs.20-Rs.25/kg.This may have played out well for consumers, but has had other consequences for the industry. There is absolutely no consistency in our approach towards onion exports, says NAFEDs Patil. A look at MEPs between December 2010 and December 2015 bears him out: the figure has fluctuated wildly, dropping to $0 in May 2012, and with a high of $1,150 in November 2013. It only enrages our customers overseas, says Patil. They are left with absolutely no guarantee of quantity and price of onions exported from India. These customers have instead chosen Pakistan, China and Iran, and we have lost guaranteed markets.Patil says that the governments decision to placate enraged urban customers has lost it both its farmers support and its overseas markets. The onion, he says, is no longer an agricultural commodity, it has become a political symbol.An MSP for onions?Assuming the government has to balance the needs of consumers with those of producers, what else could it have done to ensure that farmers get some return on their labour?The National Horticulture Research & Development Foundation (NHRDF) keeps track of potential harvests by collecting information on each district. This year, despite being aware of the possibility of a bumper crop, the government appears to have failed to take any measures to protect farmers. The NHRDFs estimates say the rabi onions should be selling at around Rs.818/ql., which is significantly higher than what farmers are managing to get. If the government chose to use its Price Stabilisation Fund, it could subsidise the crop, paying, say, Rs.500/ql.What the State government has announced this week by way of relief  Rs.100 per quintal, up to a maximum of 200 quintals, or a maximum of Rs.20,000  has, to put it mildly, failed to enthuse farmers. Every farmer The Hindu spoke to called the measure not just inadequate but practically a mockery of their plight.Fafale, who sold 10 ql. at Lasalgaon for Rs. 220/ql., or Rs 2.2/kg., greeted the news with scorn. Now I will get one rupee more. What a relief! he says sarcastically. We arent begging in front of the government. What we are asking is our right. How does this government conclude that this much of money is sufficient as financial aid? Who advises them? Have they bothered to check the ground reality?One of the major demands the farmers have is for the government to introduce a Minimum Support Price (MSP) for onions, as it has for sugarcane. Why dont the officers understand that we are not independent and traders enjoy a free run here? says Darade. Unless an MSP is announced, we cannot be sure of a certain minimum profit. Why this neglect?Western Maharashtra, the States sugar belt, has seen, in recent times, sugarcane farmers agitating for an increased MSP. It became an electoral issue in 2014 when the Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) suffered major defeats in the Assembly polls in the region considered a bastion for both.The Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana (SSS; its name means organisation for farmers self-respect), led by Raju Shetti, which was in the thick of the agitation, is now part of the State government and Shetti is an MP. While the SSS has stage limited protests in the States onion belt demanding an MSP, it has not been able to take the protests to a wider audience. With the Bharatiya Janata Party-Shiv Sena regime, as with the previous Congress-NCP rule, the MSP for onions issue is far from being solved.In the village of Bhuse, Ramdas Bodke, 65, is philosophical. I have seen many seasons and farming has never been easy. We know how to tackle nature. What do we do with man-made problems? We farmers feed the world, but now we wonder whether we will have food cooked at home. He lapses into silence for a minute, and then his tone turns bitter: Did the government discuss its proposal to hike MLA salaries for even a day? The government takes an instant decision to increase the salary of MLAs, but it takes a long time to decide about farmers. This is injustice. But there is no one to give justice to farmers.As for the urban consumers and their agitations, farmers mince no words when the topic comes up for discussion. Turning towards me, one of them asks, You get agitated when prices skyrocket, but have you ever wondered what happens when prices hit rock bottom? Why dont you come out on the streets demanding a fair price for us?I have no answers.Abundant supply has brought prices down. But farmers say traders are conspiring against them and the government has done little to help"

And it's the onion farmers who have been left teary eyed in particular.Despite a bumper crop in Ballari and Pune this year, onion farmers and traders could barely make any profit in the last 10 days. That is because not a single Tamil Nadu registration truck ferrying vegetables from farmers to traders was seen in Karnataka in this period. With excess stock, traders now have no option but to slash prices. Also, the daily wage labourers from Tamil Nadu who usually load and unload trucks across Bengalurus's markets, fled to their native places fearing they could be targeted here.Said Mohammad Idrees Choudhury, general secretary of Russell Market Traders' Association: ""While on one hand prices of onion fell sharply, vegetables like beans, eggplants, cabbages, cauliflowers, carrots, coriander, green chillies and garlic got costlier by Rs 20 to 40 per kg, drilling holes in pockets of customers. However, farmers have promised to get the rates back to normal in a few days.""While the cost of table onions was Rs 40 per kg 15 days ago, there are now available for Rs 20 a kg. Cost of regular onions has fallen from Rs 30 per kg to Rs 10-15 per kg.""In the last 8-10 days, farmers in Karnataka haven't worked at all. Most of them were busy taking part in protests. Also, 70% of the trucks transporting vegetables from farmers to traders and, subsequently, to wholesalers and retailers are from Tamil Nadu. Almost all of them stopped plying during the protest days, leading to complete breakdown of supply. Farmers suffered huge loss as 60% of their vegetables got spoilt due to lack of transport. Only 40% of perishable goods had reached the market,"" he added.Ravi Shankar, an onion merchant from Yeshwanthpur APMC Yard Market, said: ""Usually, we send about 200 to 300 trucks-full of onions to Tamil Nadu for sale. Last week, we didn't get a single customer from there.""Daily wage labourers from Tamil Nadu were the worst-hit of the lot. ""About 99% of labours loading and unloading trucks with vegetables and fruits in Russell Market, City Market, Yeshwanthpur Market and Shivajinagar market are from Tamil Nadu. All of them feared coming to work. As a result, they didn't earn a single rupee for 7 to 10 days,"" said Idrees.Pallani, 35, a labourer from tamil Nadu working in Russell Market for almost 15 years, said, ""We earn Rs 300 to 400 daily depending on the number of trucks we load and unload. We have left our families and children back in Tamil Nadu and need to send 70% of what we earn to them. We use the remaining 30% for ourselves here. For the last 10 days, we haven't earned anything and couldn't even send money home."""

The demand for the vegetables was expected to increase in the coming days. If the arrival remained low, the prices of vegetables were expected to go up further, the sources said.CoimbatorePrices of tomatoes and small onion have gone up in the city as movement of trucks between Karnataka and Tamil Nadu has been hit for the last few days.M. Rajendran, president of Thyagi Kumaran Market Vegetable Merchants Association, said wholesale price of tomatoes used to be Rs. 5 a kg. It has shot up to Rs. 20 a kg now. This is because the main supply to Coimbatore is from Karnataka. In the case of small onion, the wholesale prices have gone up from Rs. 5 - Rs. 10 a kg to Rs. 20 a kg.There is no supply of small onion from Karnataka and the merchants are buying only from Tamil Nadu farmers now, he said.

As truckers are scared to operate vehicles to Tamil Nadu, the worst affected are farmers and traders in the neighbouring state; thousands of tonnes of rice, vegetables, flowers, food products, cosmetics and garments are being transported from Karnataka to Tamil Nadu. Though consumers in Tamil Nadu experience shortages to a certain extent, traders and farmers in Karnataka have incurred huge losses, the trading community says.""We had been receiving around 600 tonnes of Parle and Britannia biscuits from Bangalore. However, ever since violence broke out in Karnataka, the arrival has totally stopped as the truck operations between the two states has been suspended,"" says JJL Gnanaraj, president, Tamil Nadu Chamber of Commerce. This apart, the arrival of flowers, vegetables, fast moving products (FMP) like cosmetics and garments from Karnataka has stopped.

In the retail markets at Nashik, the onions were sold in the range of Rs 10 per kg on Thursday compared with Rs 8 per kg last week.Sources from Lasalgaon APMC told TOI, ""The rise in demand as compared to supply has led to an increase in average wholesale onion prices in the past week. Moreover, the supply of onions, which was in the range of 12,000 to 15,000 quintals a day till two-three weeks back, has declined to 5,000 to 9,000 quintals a day at Lasalgaon.

Moreover, the stock of summer onions with farmers has been exhausted.""When contacted, Lasalgaon APMC chairman Jaydatta Holkar said, ""The average wholesale onion prices had declined to Rs 325 per quintal last month. Although the onion prices have improved to some extent, they are still low. Farmers have already incurred heavy losses due to decline in onion prices.

While onions are selling for for Rs. 2 - Rs. 6 in the wholesale market and averaging Rs. 12 in retail outlets, a kg of tomatoes is going for a relatively high Rs. 25 a kilo.Based on the trading price last season, farmers changed their crop patterns growing more onions and fewer tomatoes, leading to an imbalance in the supply-demand cycle. This, in turn, has affected prices, say traders.The crash in onion prices is the result of glut in the market. Last year at this time, onions were selling at Rs. 60 to Rs. 80 a kg. However, traders say that the high prices onions fetched last year is the precise reason why this year has seen rates plummet. Its a cycle. Following the high prices for onions last year, the acreage of onions has increased many fold this year across regions in Maharashtra, North Karnataka and Chitradurga. We have also seen a good crop across regions and the market is being flooded with onions, resulting in the crashing prices, said Ravi Kumar, of Bangalore Potato and Onion Traders Association, APMC, Yeshwantpur.Cauvery issueThe Cauvery dispute also played a role in this scenario. Tamil Nadu is one of the major buyers of onions from Karnataka. However, owing to Cauvery dispute, the movement of goods was disrupted, taking away a major market, which has further led to the crash, Mr. Kumar added.The situation is so bad that many farmers in North Karnataka are not even harvesting the crop, for that will only add to their losses. Despite having a good yield, several of them are forced to leave the crop as it is and plough the farmland so that it can become manure for the next season in Hubballi and surrounding districts.With tomatoes, the situation is the exact opposite. Following a period of prices that were as low as Rs. 6 a kg in the wholesale market, tomatoes are now selling at Rs. 25 in the wholesale market and Rs. 30 in the retail market.A senior procurement officer with a prominent retail chain in the city said that following the low prices during the last crop, many farmers in Kolar and Devanahalli belt did not grow them this season. Tomato is a three month crop.Muniswamy Gowda, a farmer in Devanahalli, who has planted tomatoes said that the acreage had reduced by more than 70 per cent for the present crop in his area, and has fetched him a good price.Furthermore, the lack of rain and humidity has brought down the quantity of the crop resulting in climbing rates for the available crop, said N.N.

Many, in fact, were hoping for monetary assistance rather than MSP since they have already suffered losses.The situation has been bad, and during October, the Davangere APMC registered a minimum price as low as Rs. 50 per quintal (i.e. 50 paise a kg).Despite several taluks in the State being declared drought hit, in the major onion growing districts in the State irrigation and timely rain at some places helped farmers to get comparatively good yield. However, while untimely rains forced the farmers to harvest it early, simultaneous arrival of onion from Maharashtra created a glut, which, in turn, has been exploited to the core by brokers. In many places there were protests by farmers over the low prices, while at some places onions were simply thrown away or not taken to the market.The State government earlier talked about MSP of Rs. 1,100 a quintal.

Old stock that was harvested in April-May is getting exhausted and there has been an unusual delay in fresh arrivals causing rates to rise.Prices at APMC Vashi spurted from Rs 8-10 on October 28 to Rs 10-12/kg on Monday. The supply crunch is gradually reflected in the retail market. Onions are selling for Rs 14-20/kg compared to the pre-Diwali slab of Rs 12-15.On Monday, the bulb sold for Rs 15 in Apna Bazar in Bandra, while shopkeepers in Andheri Lokhandwala charged Re 1 more. In Colaba, the rate at Sahakari Bhandar was Rs 14.50 for onions sold loose and Rs 13.50/kg for bulk packages of 5 kg. In Mulund, however, shops along L B S Marg sold old onion for an exorbitant Rs 30/kg and the new damp crop for Rs 25.Experts at APMC Vashi said 25% of recent supplies were found to be of inferior quality. The Mumbai market revived from a supply crisis on Monday with substantial arrivals from Hubli in Karnataka, besides Nashik. ""We got 225 truckloads which helped stabilize the rising price. Over 50% of supplies came from Hubli, the rest came from Nashik. Prices will come under control once the new crop hits the market by this month end,"" said Rajendra Shelke, president of the Onion-Potato Traders' Association.After Diwali, there has been a shortfall in supplies at the wholesale market as the old stock is running out. Due to 'heavy rain' in the onion-producing areas with an extended monsoon, the ripening of the kharif crop was reportedly delayed. ""This year, the old stock became wet and the new crop has been delayed. Prices may rise until the fresh crop hits the market,"" said a trader.Consumers have also been feeling the pinch. The season had witnessed the lowest price at Rs 2/kg in wholesale and Rs 8 in retail with a glut that began during the monsoon. ""We enjoyed a few months with afforda-ble prices, but now onions are becoming expensive again,"" said Nitesh Gurav , a consumer.In Lasalgaon, the wholesale price increased by 22% to Rs 825/quintal on Monday compared to Rs 675 last Friday. The arrival of the new crop has started, but in small quantities. At present, 98% of all arrivals are of the summer crop and the remaining 2% of the kharif crop. It will take more than a month for arrival of kharif onions to be regularized. Jaydatta Holkar, Lasalgaon APMC chairman, said, ""Prices had fallen to Rs 300-350/quintal in September because of the rise in supply. Now, more demand than supply has caused rates to rise ; summer stock is getting over."""

Farmers selling onions at the procurement centre will have to produce title deeds and crop authorization certificate issued by the revenue and horticulture officials, as well as voter's ID, Aadhar card and a photocopy of their bank passbook.As per FAQ, the onions should be cleaned and dried, should have a diameter of 30mm and should not be affected by any disease.

He said onion is grown in over five lakh hectares in 10 districts of north Karnataka . But last year, onion was grown in 10 lakh hectares and due to drought in this region the yield was reduced by 50%.The state government, during the cabinet meeting, had announced Rs 1,100 as the support price for every quintal.

Also, they want the limits on withdrawal from the current account to be lifted, for ease of doing business. Supporting this suggestion from Confederation of All India Traders industry body Assocham said: Besides, traders can also be asked to maintain strict stock details with fool-proof system against back-dated transactions and other misuse. Considering the limitations of the Income Tax Departments, the staff of the state governments and other Central departments can be deployed with a provision of strict penalties on any misuse.Umesh Seth, joint treasurer (Delhi), CAIT, said: There is a total shut down of trade. Withdrawals of even up to Rs 50,000 are being rejected (by banks) because of shortage of currency.He added: Also, we cannot do much business with a weekly withdrawal limit of Rs 50,000 from the current account leading to a monthly limit of Rs.2 lakh, as it is not enough to meet our basic monthly expenses like rent, wages and daily incidental expenses.In Karnataka, the Agricultural Produce Market Committee yards in Hubballi, Belagavi and Dharwad were closed on Thursday due to insufficient currency notes.

As per the statements by Minister of State for Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution, Ram Vilas Paswan, the Act was to be fully implemented across India by July 2016. As of now, only five States have fully executed it as per the provisions of the Central Act and the progress in other States has been tardy. The front runners are Punjab, Haryana, Chhattisgarh, Maharashtra and Rajasthan. The Act has been partially implemented in Bihar, Delhi, Himachal Pradesh and Karnataka. Preliminary surveys undertaken in some of these States have revealed positive outcomes in terms of administrative reforms, significant increase in the number of households having ration cards, and improvement in the distribution and consumption of food through fair price shops. A few of them had already initiated reforming the distribution system much before the Act was presented in Parliament. The Act, if fully implemented, is likely to benefit 720 million people through availability of 5 kg per capita per month of subsidised foodgrains (rice, wheat and coarse cereals) at a much lower rate than that in the open market. This would ensure food security and enhance nutritional status.The Odisha studyThe two concepts are interlinked, but nutrition security has a much wider connotation than food security. It encompasses a biological approach, that is, adequate and safe intake of protein, energy, vitamin and minerals along with proper health and social environment. The nutritional aspect of the quantity of grain to be distributed to each person under the Public Distribution System (PDS) is somewhat less researched, though the Act has aimed at attaining this goal. Poor quality of food lacking essential micronutrients and no diet diversity, and unhygienic conditions of storage may come in the way. There are other promising features under the Act, such as free daily meals for children and maternity benefits, including cash for pregnant women, which can combat rampant undernutrition (calorie deficiency) and malnutrition (protein deficiency) across the country. These steps may perhaps complement the existing nutritional programmes such as mid-day meals and Integrated Child Development Services.We present results from a study in rural Odisha on the contribution of PDS towards households intake of foodgrains and the quantum of calorie and protein levels. A primary survey of 385 households was carried out during 2014-15 in three extremely poor districts viz. Koraput and Bolangir in the so-called KBK (most backward) region and Nayagarh in the non-KBK region. While KBK districts follow a universal PDS, non-KBK districts have a targeted one.There is high prevalence of undernutrition and malnutrition in the selected districts. The estimates, adjusted on the basis of age, sex and work as recommended by the nutrient requirements and dietary allowances of Indians drawn up by the Indian Council of Medical Research-National Institute of Nutrition in 2010 reveal the undernourished population to be 50 per cent and the malnourished to be 43 per cent on an average for all the districts together. Calorie and protein deficiency is relatively higher (see graphic), nearly 68 per cent among the Antyodaya Anna Yojana (AAY) households, known to be the poorest of poor. It is much higher in Koraput district at 72 per cent, way above the State average of 60 per cent.Rice is the key staple food in the surveyed areas and acts as a major source of energy intake. The monthly per capita consumption of rice is estimated to be 11.6 kg, of which 33.7 per cent is sourced from the PDS by all beneficiaries. Since AAY households have higher quota and accessibility under the PDS, the contribution is much more at 73.9 per cent. Cereals (wheat and rice) make up 70 per cent of the calorie intake and 66 per cent of the protein intake, though the magnitude varies across districts. More importantly, the contribution of PDS to energy intake among AAY households is double (60 per cent) that of other beneficiaries.Better accessibility to food and hence energy intake of poor people, especially those under AAY, has been made possible due to concerted efforts initiated by the government. Major reforms initiated from 2004-05 that are worth mentioning include abolition of private procurement and storage system, and a greater role for public agencies in controlling diversion of foodgrain from the godown to the millers; proper recording of procurement, storage and distribution of grains across the departments; and distribution of food through self-help groups and gram panchayats and its regular monitoring at the block and ward levels. While revealing their satisfaction with the PDS, the beneficiaries refuted the idea of having a cash transfer system in place of the existing in-kind transfers, primarily due to fear of price hike and inadequate infrastructure i.e. roads, banks, and long distance of market from the village. In fact, the beneficiaries proposed an increase in the coverage of commodities to pulses, onion and potato under the PDS in their respective areas.Replicating Odisha elsewhereThe efforts of the State government in ensuring food security should be replicated in States that are yet to fully implement the Act and reform their respective distribution systems. Many studies have emphasised on dietary diversification to ensure appropriate nutritional intake for large segments of the poor population. This may be an important step to be taken up in States where a revamped PDS is making ground, such as in Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Bihar. Provision has been made under the NFSA to provide one additional coarse cereal viz. millet along with wheat and rice, which can further enhance the nutritional security of the poor households. Though wheat and rice contribute significantly to energy intake, the time has come to increase our focus on coarse cereals and pulses to improvise adequate intake of protein. Serious deliberations are required to make this possible through the PDS, which is going to cater to a sizeable population in the near future. As elicited above, the AAY households have a greater access to PDS but the problem of undernourishment is more serious among them.As a prerequisite, it is imperative to hasten implementation of the NFSA across the country. States should be in a mission mode as availability of foodgrains may not be a problem this year. The Ministry of Agriculture has projected a record production of 270 million tonnes owing to good monsoon and an increase in acreage of foodgrains from 101 million hectares to 105 million hectares. The States must gear up to work on adequate logistics for digitisation of ration cards, computerisation of offtake and delivery of foodgrains, and effective monitoring of fair price shops, possibly through involvement of communities or other feasible ways. This will bring in greater transparency in the system and would go a long way towards raising the nutritional status of Indians.SeemaBathla is Professor and Bal Krishan Negi a Research Scholar at Centre for the Study of Regional Development, JNU, New Delhi.The Antyodaya Anna Yojana households have a greater access to PDS but the problem of undernourishment is more serious among them"

In fact, the historic Bangalore Club proudly claims this butterfly obsessed officer still owes the club `13 from an unpaid bill during one of his visits. The young Lieutenant was a frequent visitor of the Waverly Inn at Whitefield, where he is believed to have stayed on occasion. Rumour has it that during his visits, Churchill courted Rose Hamilton, the daughter of James Hamilton, who was the then owner of the Inn. The Waverly Inn still stands today, though it is now a private residence.Whitefield Arms incorporates this history with colonial themed wooden furniture and outdoor seating that makes for a quiet date night place.The microbrewery fuses Indian with British culinary skills in a menu that serves soups, burgers, salad, dessert and cocktails.The famed Madras pepper borth cooked presented in an Anglicised version is basically dal with an Angrezi tadka served as Mulligatawny soup that keeps it mild and easy on the throat.Their Cheddar Onion Soup is officially the best soup I have had ever, and I have had quite a few good ones. But this rich carmelised onion soup served with a gratinated cheese crouton absolutely won me over. To anyone visiting the place, forget the drinks, this soup is all you need to warm and please you up on a gloomy day. With the starters, while I enjoyed the crispy fried onion, the TWA Chips, Cheese and Gravy, which is basically fries topped with dal makhani, cheese, chopped jalapenos, green chillis and onions isnt exactly the kind of fusion cuisine Id vote for.To the pea lover, the chef does bake a mean Filo Parcel with peas and corn that is served with tomato fenugreek sauce and stir fried vegetables. The filo is buttery and flakes in melting into your mouth, with peas and corn to compliment the creamy crunch. The tomato fenugreek sauce is also used as a base for Pan Seared Vegetable and Yogurt Cakes. The dish is a combination of stuffed grilled galettes with hung curd served with a tomato fenugreek sauce, stir fried vegetables and truffle mushroom rice.Loved the mushroom rice, but the acidity of the yogurt cake and the tomato fenugreek sauce wasnt a pleasing combination, probably a basic potato substance would have lifted this dish. The mini burger is cuteness overload with the size and the miniature stuffing, the taste? Well, still dreaming about the onion soup here.But then, desserts happened. And oh my, all my dreams of an Eclairs fantasy came true. The Sticky Toffee Pudding is a rich cake soaked with a thick sticky toffee sauce topped with vanilla ice cream.The Lemon Meringue Pie is a classic citrus dessert done right, with a creamy toasted meringue.Among cocktails, along with a rather cheery bartender, the Lavelle, Air Mail, Mountbatten and Colonial. Each cocktail has a story to tell, with few in the memory of World War II heroes.My favourite? The Air Mail, this sparkling wine based cocktail wisely mixes Old Monk with honey and lime to make a soothy drink.Two things Id definitely recommend with Whitefield Arms is the Sticky Toffee Pudding and the Cheddar Onion Soup and the Sticky Toffee Pudding. Oh, and also the outside sitting area that resembles the restaurants you come across on a walk through the streets of Paris.(Approximate cost for two people `1,500. Place: Whitefield Arms)"

Now they fear that prices will keep going south.Traders at Azadpur Mandi told The Hindu on Sunday that while all vegetables saw a marginal to medium dip in prices, onions, an important produce, fell by nearly Rs.300 for a 40-kg pack.Hardeep Bhalla, an onion wholesaler at Azadpur Mandi, said a 40-kg pack of onions was selling for Rs. 800 three days ago. He added that from the 180 trucks arriving daily, the number is down to just 100.Businessmen at Azadpur fruits and vegetables wholesale market claimed that dearth of cash has forced others in the supply chain, be it small vendors or middlemen, to either not buy at all or cut down on the quantities they procure. The business in mandis, or at least the onward sale to locals, has been running mostly on credit. While wholesalers understand the compulsion, many middlemen who earlier bought on credit now insist on paying in cash or refuse to buy at all.This puts added pressure on us since we are cash-strapped. Unsold stocks means no hope of payment in the next few days either, said Devesh, who also deals in onions. Stating that he gets his stocks from States like Maharashtra and Karnataka, he said the first signs of reduced supply are visible.However, if supply is limited, the reduced liquidity has forced retail buyers to stay away as well. Which is why Azadpur Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee member Rajender Sharma said consumers may not be affected, at least in the short run, due to the prices these things are being sold.Some cash flow following withdrawal at banks has revived hopes, with small vendors coming to market with Rs.100 notes.All vegetables saw a marginal to medium dip in prices, but onions fell by Rs.300 for 40-kg pack"

Queues outside ATMs were quite long. At some ATMs, people complained of server problems. Compared to the first two days, crowd in the bank has thinned. But I had to wait in a queue for half an hour, Chandrashekar of Puttur, a resident, said.In Mysuru, crowds persisted outside banks and ATMs but relatively thinned in banks. Banks rarely followed the Centres directive to make separate queues for women, senior citizens and the disabled. People having notes of lower denomination made a quick buck by swapping them for a commission. In North Karnataka, people in villages were not affected much when compared to their counterparts in urban areas. Their dependency on cash is less as this is neither harvesting nor sowing season. The only affected farmers were onion growers who faced difficulty in selling their produce. Some banks held note exchange melas in villages. Vijaya Bank held one such mela at Saunish village.In urban areas including Hubballi, the situation has not changed. The situation was no different in Davangere and Shivamogga."

Besides, traders said, there was a lot of confusion and misinformation due to the government changing the norms every other day.Traders pleaTo improve the situation, the traders have suggested they be allowed to accept old currency notes (of Rs.500 and Rs.1000 denominations) with proper KYC (Know Your Customer) forms, with a commitment to deposit the notes in banks on the very same day. Also, they want the limits on withdrawal from the current account to be lifted, for ease of doing business. Supporting this suggestion given by the apex traders body Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT), industry body Assocham said: Besides, traders can also be asked to maintain strict stock details with fool-proof system against back-dated transactions and other misuse. Considering the limitations of the Income Tax Departments, the staff of the state governments and other Central departments can be deployed with a provision of strict penalties on any misuse.Umesh Seth, joint treasurer (Delhi), CAIT, said: There is a total shut down of trade. Withdrawals of even up to Rs 50,000 are being rejected (by banks) because of shortage of currency. Mr. Seth, who is also the joint secretary, Automotive Parts Merchants Association, added: Also, we cannot do much business with a weekly withdrawal limit of Rs 50,000 from the current account leading to a monthly limit of Rs.2 lakh, as it is not enough to meet our basic monthly expenses like rent, wages and daily incidental expenses. For those dealing in high value items, doing business has become virtually impossible. He pointed out that with all the workers waiting in queues before banks to withdraw money or to deposit old notes, many man-hours are being wasted, which, in turn, was a loss to the national economy.In Karnataka, the Agricultural Produce Market Committee yards in Hubballi, Belagavi and Dharwad were closed on Thursday due to lack of sufficient currency notes. Many traders are finding it difficult to pay the farmers for their produce. The main market areas in Bengaluru city were also impacted. APMC yard in Bengaluru is known for its cash payments. Only because of the on-time payment did many farmers prefer Bengaluru. Increasing the current account limit to Rs.50, 000 per week will not help us in any way as we need to pay in lakhs to farmers on a daily basis, said Ravishankar B., Director, Bengaluru Onion & Potato Merchant Association. He added, This is the season when Karnataka onion farmers bring their produce to the market. We need to pay the trucks, farmers and other workers. In the current scenario we are not able to help the farmers and reward them for their work.Business has dropped over 70 per cent as most of the trade is depended on the cash economy. As per the estimates of the Karnataka Hosiery & Garment Association (KHGA), the sector has seen the lowest business in the last couple of years. The association also said the current account weekly withdrawal limit of Rs.50,000 will not help the traders as many small traders need more than Rs.50000 for daily business needs. The government should soon bring Rs. 500 notes to the market to achieve normalcy, said Sajjan Raj Mehta, former president, KHGA.In Kolkata, Anupam Boral, Proprietor of a small firm, Geetanjali Solar Enterprises (GSE), said the shortage of Rs 100 notes is also hurting business. For instance, Boral said he is finding it difficult to get five notes in Rs 100 denomination to buy the papers for the tender floated by the Central Glass Research and Ceramic Institute. Though there is an option of pay order, small businesses like ours are having difficulties in finding people to stand in a long queue on our behalf to get a bank order."" On other practical difficulties that he facing on a daily basis, Boral said, I am also unable to pay my transporters as their bill varies between Rs 800 to Rs 1500. The shortage of Rs 100 rupee is crippling us. Even if I avail the cash credit facility  it comes in five notes of Rs 2000 denomination.""In Coimbatore, there is a lot of confusion and misinformation on cash and withdrawal limits. P.K. Govindaraj, who has a foundry at the SIDCO Industrial Estate at Kurichi in Coimbatore, went to the bank on Thursday morning to draw Rs. 30,000 from his Cash Credit (CC) account, but was in for a shock when he was told that the maximum limit is only Rs. 10,000. He said, I employ 50 people and need Rs. 80,000 a week for their wages and another Rs. 20,000 for payment to vehicles, etc. How can I manage a week with Rs. 10,000?The castings manufactured at the foundry are sold at his shop in Coimbatore city. We usually use the cash from the sales at the shop. But, there are so many restrictions now and I had to draw money from the bank. I have this account for nearly 40 years. We should be allowed to withdraw more, he says. However, another foundry owner in the city was able to draw Rs. 50,000 from his CC account. He had drawn Rs. 10,000 last Friday and was allowed to draw another Rs. 40,000 on Thursday. There is no clarity on the issue. Some banks allowed the industries that have CC account to draw Rs. 50,000 a week and some have not, said V. Sundaram, president of Coimbatore District Small Industries Association.The plight of small scale industrial units in Hyderabad is no different from those in several parts of the country as a result of demonetization. Cash is the predominant mode of transaction for them. Since bank finance to them is limited, the entrepreneurs depend on hand loans and the informal sector  avenues that have hit a roadblock over the last week.Federation of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry leaders Ravindra Modi and V. Anil Reddy counted payment of wages, transportation charges and replacement of machinery spare parts among aspects that get affected immediately. Since customers are not insulated from the cash crunch, there is bound to be pressure on revenue generation cycle.Though there is bound to be impact in the short term, the units need to take into account benefit the demonetization exercise would deliver in the long run, says K.Koteswara Rao, Convenor of All India Forum for Small and Medium Industries. He expected the lending rates to come down and money coming into the system to be used for infrastructure development in the country.(Inputs from Pradeesh Chandran, Indrani Dutta, M.

On Wednesday, traders in Malakpet, one of the largest onion markets in the city, decided to bring down their shutters till November 19, owing to the unavailability of adequate cash to pay transport and labour charges. A representation, stating the same, was submitted to the agricultural marketing department.Till then, traders said, they will clear their old stocks.""We have called for the market to be closed as there is no cash available. It has affected payments made to truck drivers, labourers and tiller carriers that happen only in cash as they do not accept payments in any other form. Right now we are only clearing out our old stocks,"" said Ananth Reddy, president of the Hyderabad Onion Merchants' Association, adding, ""This will have a ripple effect on the onion supply to the city and its peripheral areas.""""We have no choice but to hike the prices to ensure we do not slip into huge losses,"" said Md Aslam, a trader at Begum Bazaar market, where many were seeing selling old stock. ""There are very few lorries that brought onion into the market on Wednesday. So we are selling stock that is two days old,"" he added.Officials of the agricultural marketing department confirmed the dip in number of trucks bringing supplies to the city. ""From the usual 100 trucks, the number has dropped to less than 30,"" said Raja Shekhar, secretary of the market yard. Of 100 trucks bringing in supplies, almost 70 come from Maharashtra, Karnataka and parts of Madhya Pradesh.Given the crisis, Telangana minister for agricultural marketing, T Harish Rao, has now directed officials to ensure that there is enough supply of onions in the city's markets. ""If required, the department officials can also procure stock from markets around the city. We need to make sure that the price of the vegetable is regulated and is sold at Rs 10 per kg,"" he said."

On Thursday, the government slashed the onetime exchange limit for old notes to Rs 2,000 from Rs 4,500, having raised it from Rs 4,000 before that. The weekly withdrawal limit for savings bank account users had been raised to Rs 24,000 from Rs 20,000 with the limit of Rs 10,000 per day being scrapped. As for ATM withdrawals, the limit has been raised to Rs 2,500 from Rs 2,000 earlier but thats only for those that are recalibrated to take the new Rs 500 and Rs 2,000 notes, a process thats taking time  only 10% of the machines have been reprogrammed.While the public position of banks is that the situation has eased, anecdotal evidence seems to suggest that this is true in some parts of the country but not others, especially NCR.On top of that, bankers told ET that they are struggling to keep pace with the sudden changes in regulations. As there arent enough notes to go around, banks have had to impose their own curbs.The government increased the withdrawal limits recently (but) we have to cater to all our customers. Cash is limited, so we have put up signage outside the branch telling customers we can only disburse Rs 15,000 to savings bank holders and Rs 25,000 to current account holders, said a private bank branch manager. One bank executive in New Delhis Connaught Place area said it only issues 50 tokens for withdrawals every day because thats all the cash it gets for such disbursals, which means the money usually runs out in an hour or so.In hindsight, its clear the massive demand for currency exchange hadnt been expected. It was only when realisation daGwned that this route was being employed for largescale money laundering that the window was narrowed to Rs 2,000.In the initial days, there was ambiguity over the Rs 4,000 one-time exchange, which was exploited by people, said the employee of a state-owned bank branch. Now it has been reduced to Rs 2,000 (but) imagine how we will answer (genuine) customers who come at our branches and question us on these changes.The raised withdrawal limits arent of much relief, even for those who hold current accounts and need to pay employees and vendors. Axis Bank is giving half the money and Karnataka Bank is just giving a paltry sum, said an entrepreneur from Salem in Tamil Nadu who runs a garment chain. There is a lot of confusion in our minds because government says we can withdraw Rs 50,000.Lakhamsinh Gadda, who runs a toy shop in Mumbais Jogeshwari area, faced the same issue. I have accounts with two banks. Both told me that I have to wait for some time to get the full amount as they are running out of cash.An executive at a public sector lender based in south India said it had got just Rs 1,000 crore for its 100 branches in the south zone. This amount is too less given we are getting customers of other banks as well to use our ATM facility, he said, adding that the supply of Rs 500 currency notes was severely limited. Maybe once that improves, we will be able to manage the rush. This also shows the limited currency that the RBI has been able to print despite all announcements it has made.Bengaluru, according to this official, is not witnessing the kind of rush being seen in the north. There are long queues but surprisingly more civility, he said.A senior Punjab National Bank official said that staff have been instructed to put the new Rs 500 notes mostly in ATMs. Thats another issue because at the branch counter we are mostly dealing with Rs 100 or Rs 2,000 currency notes, he said. While some mobile apps have sprung up purporting to provide information about which ATMs in any given area have cash, people have taken to tracking the vans that transport currency notes.The need for money is so huge that we have heard that several people are tailing the cash provider vans of SIS and Brinks Arya so that they get cash immediately once its loaded in the ATM, said another banker. ATMs are running out of cash quickly. Once they are recalibrated, Rs 500 and Rs 2,000 notes will be available.Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said 22,500 ATMs (out of 202,000) had been reprogrammed by Thursday to dispense the new notes, along with the old Rs 100 notes. That leaves 90% of the ATM network yet to be calibrated.The governments decision to inject cash into the agricultural markets with higher withdrawal limits for traders and farmers has prompted the main onion market at Lasalgaon, Nashik, to resume operations after about a week. Jaydatta Holkar, chairman of the mandi, said farmers will also be paid through the banking system. Farmers welcomed the move but complained that reaching bank counters or finding functioning ATMs remains a challenge. Elsewhere, things have been getting better, some users said.Mumbai resident Sangita Pereira said she managed to get Rs 10,000 from her Central Bank of India branch in Vikhroli. Seeing the queues at branches, I was going to one ATM after another but didnt manage to get any cash. I stood outside my bank branch yesterday, waited for one hour and got the cash, so its looking much better than what it was two days back.In Pune, queues outside banks have subsided substantially. There was more rush from people who had accounts in other branches or banks."" said Harish Pai, who had just returned from SBI. Now that ATMs are calibrated, the rush is expected to subside over the next few days."

The farmers were told that for onions to be sold, they should be of the best quality with a diameter of 30 mm, along with other criteria. They were informed that they could sell up to 50 quintals of onions if they obtain the card from the Horticulture department after submitting their crop certificate (bele drudhikarana patra), Aadhaar card and bank account details.However, till this day, not even one kilogram of onions has been purchased at the centre.Anasuya, Manager of the Kadur branch of Karnataka Government Marketing Federation, said that no decision has been taken on the distribution of purchased onions.

However, the farmers bring in those onions remaining after the sale of 70% of the crop.

Farmers in Karnataka are realising this as they are unable to get reasonable prices for perishable commodities given the liquidity crunch.Trade in the farming sector happens mainly in cash. Given the cash shortage, farmers are forced to either accept the scrapped notes or sell the produce on credit without any documentation. This makes them vulnerable to cheating. The first few days after demonetisation were particularly bad. Vegetables were sold at throwaway prices as cash-strapped traders stayed away.Take onion, for instance, which can be stored for up to 60 days. There has been a bumper crop in Karnataka this year and APMC yards across the state have been flooded with the produce. The minimum support price (MSP) offered by the government for a quintal of onion is Rs 624, according to farmers.The APMC yard at Yeshwantpur was a picture of utter chaos from November 9 to 12. Onion was sold for as low as Rs 100 and Rs 200 per quintal. Krishnappa, who brought a truckload of onions from Bagalkot, said he saw the commodity being sold at Rs 200 per quintal at the Yeshwantpur yard. Kumar, a farmer from Chitradurga and district secretary of Bharatiya Kisan Sangh (BKS), said demonetisation badly affected the business in the first week.Things are now looking up, he said. Ironically, the BKS is affiliated to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), the BJPs ideological parent.Bharat Shah, a wholesale merchant, said that at least Rs 1.5 crore worth of vegetables and fruits were destroyed in Bengaluru in the last one week because of the liquidity crunch.Both farmers and traders have incurred huge losses. We could not sell these commodities because people didnt have money to even buy them at the lowest possible prices. This is a rare phenomenon, Shah added.N Manjunath, a coconut wholesale dealer, said, Low-denomination notes are either unavailable or soiled. Farmers accept them unwillingly. The day they reject these notes, we will also discard them.Aware of the distress in the farming sector, the Prime Ministers Office (PMO) has directed all states to assess the impact of demonetisation on farmers. Karnatakas Department of Agricultural Marketing has started the work accordingly, a senior officer said."

Business has slumped by 60% with traders warning of dire consequences to the countrys economy if this continues.This markets impact on business is so striking that the Union Home Ministry even dispatched a representative on Thursday to hold closed-door discussions with traders. Top representatives of the 1,980 wholesale traders at the market have requested the Centre to increase the individual daily withdrawal limit from banks for current account holders from Rs 24,000 to Rs 2 lakh per day.Spread over 93 acres, the APMC is not only the biggest in terms of trade volume but also the largest in south India in terms of area, says Bharat Shah, consultant to food grains and pulses merchants in the city.With 11 entry gates leading to the yard, it is a bustling market with tempos, small and big trucks zooming in and out all day and night.

The yard receives an average of 1 lakh bags of onion and 50,000 bags of potato daily. Groups of men are found standing in different spots in the yard, auctioning these items after the trucks arrive with the produce.From a daily turnover of Rs 50 crore, we now have a daily turnover of Rs 18 crore to Rs 20 crore due to the massive cash crunch all around. After the demonetisation move on November 8, our total turnover for the next three days hovered around Rs 5 crore only, said Lahoti. Business has been improving but we are still losing 60 per cent of our business and the Centre has to do something urgently. We requested their representative Anil Kumar, during our meeting on Thursday, to increase the withdrawal limit for current accounts to atleast Rs 2 lakh per day, he added.Traders around his shop concede that the wholesale business sees 90 per cent cash transactions. Representatives of farmers have been camping at the market for a day or two to collect due payment in new currency notes.They will not accept old Rs 500 or Rs 1,000 notes or cheque payments, a trader said. He adds that almost every trader here lost at least Rs 2 to Rs 3 lakh by accepting cheque payments which later bounced. Business is no more done on trust, he added.Speaking of his outlet, Sunil & Co, located in MG Building in the yard, Lahoti said, I have been giving credit only to longstanding customers, whom I trust. I am losing the rest of my business."

This held true at small retailers and vegetable shops in the cities and towns that Express checked out.There are small differences, but all marginal. The perishable commodities  tomato was a common casualty  did witness a downturn, but mostly due to stock clearance sale in the evenings. But the figures may not tell the full story. This is not stability, insist traders, who have been having few visitors and minimal sales. The fall in demand starts at 40-50 per cent and climbs higher for hawkers. Its this decline in demand that is keeping the price steady, a perilous equilibrium.Veterans in the trade who have learnt to look beyond the immediate told Express that the situation could change if cash does not return to the market in the next few weeks and if stocks dry up. What the low demand conceals are stories about farm produce that could not be brought to the market due to supply chain disruption following the cash crunch. In some cases, harvests have been postponed as the price offered is less than what is required to pay the farm hands.Every acre that is not cultivated and every tonne of produce not reaching the market will add up to a sharp decline in supply in the coming months, the period when markets are hoping to stabilise with the expected arrival of currency. If the fears prove to be true, a price inflation may be around the corner.Express does a status check across South India and Odisha on the impact of demonetisation on prices and sales of small retailers and vegetable and fruit shops.KOCHIWhat when the stocks are over?Shibu B STwo weeks into demonetisation of big currency notes, markets have been able to maintain steady prices. Being a consumer state, Kerala depends upon other states for most of the essential commodities. Usually, wholesale dealers stock up goods by October-end, ahead of the Christmas season, explained Ernakulam Broadway Shop Owners Association (BSOA) joint secretary Joseph DSilva. But traders expect prices to go up in the coming month on the basis of the cash flow and arrival of stocks from other states.However, there is a dip in demand. For instance, a retailer who used to buy 500 kg of onion before demonetisation is now buying only half of that quantity, DSilva added. Another reason for the steady prices is that a major chunk of the transactions between wholesale dealers and retailers in Kerala is being done through credit. The major crops produced here like coconut and pineapple and pepper have suffered a drop in its prices, said P Solomon of Pushpa Stores, Ernakulam Broadway.VIJAYAWADASales down to 20 per centS Guru SrikanthMarkets in Vijayawada have gone into a freeze since the demonetisation of Rs 1,000 and Rs 500 currency notes. Merchant associations say business is not even 20 per cent what it used to be at this time of the year. However, there has not been much of an impact on prices of essential commodities. Only volumes have come down. With no money in the market, outstanding payments, outstanding receipts and loans have been affected. The situation has impacted sales, particularly of perishable commodities, said Vakkalagadda Bhaskar Rao, president of Vijayawada Chambers of Commerce and Industry.In the first week after Prime Ministers announcement, prices of vegetables fell by 10-20 per cent in the wholesale market, but rose slightly in the second week. On November 25, they were back to the same level as on November 8. Normally, prices surge when demand is high and/or supply is less. But with demand and supply plummeting, prices have been stable. Simply put, the market has come to a near standstill.BHUBANESWARRise in prices plus drop in salesHemant Kumar RoutUnlike in the southern states, the currency crisis has resulted in a rise in prices of some essential commodities in Bhubaneswar as well as a drop in sales.Prices of pulses and spices have increased by at least 10 per cent and that of wheat and flour by 20-25 per cent. However, there was no significant change in the prices of rice, potatoes, onions, milk, edible oils and poultry products.In consonance with other states, Bhubaneswar markets have witnessed a reduction in prices of fruits and vegetables by 10-15 per cent and 20 per cent, respectively.The arrival of winter produce along with lack of consumer demand is helping to keep vegetables prices low. Some vegetables are now available at 30-50 per cent less.Sudhakar Panda, general secretary of Federation of All Odisha Traders Associations, said the rise in prices of pulses, wheat and spices is due to supply chain kinks  mainly transportation problems  that have arisen due to demonetisation.HYDERABADConsumers tight-fistedJ Deepthi Nandan ReddyBarring a few exceptions, demonetisation has left prices of essential commodities untouched, but prices of perishable goods such as vegetables, fruits have decreased considerably. Vegetables such as tomatoes were in fact dumped in the Hyderabad markets last week as there were few takers. Consumers have either not been able to access small notes of valid currency or having gained access to such notes have been reluctant to part with them.This tight hold on cash has badly affected vegetable and meat sales and prices. For instance, tomatoes sold at Rs 20 per kg before demonetisation are now available for Rs 10. Prices of other vegetables have also dropped as sellers lowered prices to dispose of produce. Buyers have become scarce, said Mohammed Ibrahim, a vegetable vendor at Mehdipatnam in Hyderabad. Further, due to rumours and apprehensions of transport being affected post-demonetisation, the price of salt touched Rs 60 immediately after November 8. However, the situation soon returned to normal.BENGALURUDIp in prices of perishablesAkram MohammedPrices of essential commodities like rice and pulses have not seen much difference in Bengaluru post demonetisation, but prices of perishable commodities like fruits and vegetables are down by 20-30 per cent, according to Bangalore Wholesale Foodgrains and Pulses Merchant Association. Prices of pulses have been more or less stable but volumes are low. There are three issues here. First, sales have come down. Second, perishables are being sold at lower prices since they cannot be stored for a long time. Third, small vendors have been hit really hard.A vegetable trader Kamraj K said he procures two small truckloads of vegetables every day. However, in the last five days, he has cut it to one. Sales are down by 70 per cent across all foods. Bharath Shah, chairman of the food processing and internal trade cell of the Federation of Karnataka Chambers of Commerce and Industry, said, I fear this situation will continue for another six months if we dont bring money back into the market.CHENNAISmaller traders take the hitSushmitha RamakrishnanThe severe shortage in cash has prompted people to tighten their purse strings, bringing less money in the commodity market in Chennai. There is much less supply, as small traders have refrained from buying the usual quantum in a sluggish market. But there is no resultant increase in price due to the lack of demand.The shops in Chennai that Express visited said their sales have been down by half in the aftermath of the demonetisation drive. But that has not had an impact on prices.Even in cases like potatoes where the price is supposed to have an upward revision around this time has not happened.In this currency-driven business, they have no money to procure supplies due to restriction on cash withdrawal. In that, the smaller traders are at a severe disadvantage vis-a-vis the retail chains which have the network to ensure interrupted supply.Thus, while the smaller ones are seeing a fall of 50 per cent and more in sales, the networked shops have had a beneficial time."

Sitting on the sacks of onion Shivashankar was already tired as he had spent two sleepless nights in the open space guarding his onion crop.Umesh Sangolli had a similar story to tell. Although they had reached Hubballi on Tuesday night, their crop was graded on Wednesday afternoon and asked to wait.At Rs. 624 per quintal we can barely meet the expenses we made for cultivating the crop. If it was Rs. 1,000 per quintal it would have helped us, Mr. Umesh said.Shankaragouda Agasinamani and Ningappa Lakkannavar of Shivalli village in Hubballi taluk who had reached the centre on Wednesday were luckier as their crop was graded on Wednesday itself. However they too were waiting for getting their lot number. If everything goes well we will return tonight, Ningappa said.Branch Manager of Karnataka State Cooperative Marketing Federation, Mallikarjun Mallammanavar said that in all 30,100 sacks had arrived in the market in the last three days.Although there were instructions to auction the arrival on Thursday afternoon, it was subsequently cancelled as it became clear that the procurement deadline had been extended by a week. Sources said that the auction was cancelled as it was feared that the auctioned crop might come back to the centre through illegal ways."

Its an investment of Rs 5000 for her, a senior citizen. She makes a small profit on it and she gets by on it.Once she has sold her bag, she goes back to the market to buy another and thus continues her cycle of existence. But things have changed for Ramani since Nov. 8 when Prime Minister Narendra Modis government announced demonetization of high-value currency notes. It resulted in cash being sucked out of the market and buyers have become tight-fisted with the cash they have in hand.Ramani has been stuck with a bag of garlic she bought 25 days ago, for credit from a stockist. I used to sell a bag a day, she said when New Indian Express visited the market yard on Thursday, a month after demonetization kicked in.Her daughter Uma works in the same market as a daily wage worker. She used to make Rs 300 sifting onion at a stockyard. Work has been hard to find in the past one month. I have not been able to make Rs 100 a day. It is a very tough life for me right now, said Uma.The APMC market is said to be south Indias biggest agricultural market. Spread over 93 acres houses 1,980 wholesale shops that employ nearly 2,000 workers and trade in a mind-boggling variety of things Indians need every month: onions, garlic, potatoes, rice, atta, sugar, pulses, chillies, jaggery, coconuts, you name it.One month of demonetisation has left the bustling market wobbling, its business down 60 per cent from Rs 50 crore a day. Nearly 60 per cent of the business used to be done through cash.The markets assistant secretary, B N Krishnappa told New Indian Express, Theres just no cash around. Today (Thursday), our overall turnover was less than Rs 20 crore. We used to do Rs 50 crore.A fortnight ago, when New Indian Express visited the market, the scenario had been similar but today a stoic acceptance of reality has set it. Debit and credit cards are being accepted now and traders said they are contemplating buying card swipe machines shortly.Ramesh Chandra Lahoti, president of the Bangalore Wholesale Foodgrains and Pulses Merchants Association, said retailers not placing big orders because customers are holding on to any money they have. Stocks in the warehouses have dwindled. Its a panic situation, he said.Lahotis own company, Sunil & Co, used to purchase 3,000 bags (50 kg per bag) of sona masuri rice every month. Demand has fallen steeply since November 9 and he bought only 1,400 bags of rice in the last 30 days. He has cut his stock of dals down from 40 tonnes to 20.Perishables like onions and potatoes continue to move but slowly. Purchases are down 40 per cent and mostly on credit, Krishnappa said. The market sources 52,391 quintals of onion per day (over 2.10 lakh bags) from Chitradurga, Bagalkot, Chalakere and Gadag districts at a cost of Rs 4.33 crore per day paid to farmers through the 100 commission agents based here. The quantity of purchases has remained the same in the demonetization month but post-dated cheques with a 45-day credit period are being handed out for about 40 per cent of the produce. The market used to accept 15-day post-dated cheques earlier.The markets Coconut Traders Association president V Manjunath said the coconut business has gone down by 50 per cent. Coconuts arrive in trucks from Tiptur, Kanakpura, Pandavapura, Channapatna, Mysuru and Hassan. His own business is continuing to tick but only because he accepts accepts cheques and demand drafts.  I used to sell a minimum of 10,000 coconuts per day and a maximum of 50,000. In the past one month, my minimum has been 3,000 and the maximum has not crossed 25,000, he said."

Cost of veggies imported from other states, however, has increased 10% to 30% with shortfall in supply because of transportation hassles. Similarly, rate of seasonal fruits imported from other states and countries have increased by 35% to 50%.Wholesale dealer at the galla mandi Manish Rastogi said potatoes are perishable in nature and come from nearby areas like Kannauj. Since these farmers are not able to get their produce transported to other states, they are dumping the crop in the local market, leading to crash in prices by 50%. Similar is the situation with cauliflower, cabbage and other locally grown season vegetables whose prices have gone down by 30%-75%.Prices of onion and peas has gone up 30% and 8%, recently in the past one month because of drop in supply .Onions are imported from Madhya Pradesh and Maha rashtra and peas from Punjab.""Following the currency crisis, transporters are not running their fleets in full strength. As a result, we are not receiving sufficient supply,"" said Ajay Yadav at Chinhat Mandi. This is also responsible for rise in prices of fruits.Price of tomatoes, which are imported from Karnataka, however, has gone down 10%.The reason, say vegetable dealers, is the highly perishable nature of the vegetable.Retailers said they are forced to sell vegetables at low prices because of drop in demand. ""Those who can afford are preferring super markets for cashless purchase. Earlier, they used to come to us to buy fresh vegetables. This has also led to drop in demand,"" said Rehmat Ali, a greengrocer in Dandaiya market. Sale has also dropped because of lack of loose change. ""People give us Rs 2,000 note and we don't have change, so no transaction takes place,"" said Rajendra Prasad at Nishatganj mandi.Vishakha Dubey, a school teacher who had come to buy fruits said first of all you need to carry change loads the purse and then the prices of fruits have shot up as there are not enough Rs 100 notes in the market."

Ilyas sells the onion and garlic he buys from the middlemen.""The middlemen too do not have enough cash, so they are buying only limited produce. We can't expect them to pay us the entire amount,"" he said, adding that his sales have been hit almost by 50%.

A similar fate has befallen shallot farmers of Perambalur district , who produce close to 75,000 tonnes of small onion on 20,000 acres. A cold storage facility built by the state government in 2014 for storing these onions shelling out `1.15 crore has been remaining useless for the simple reason that onions perish if stored in the cold! At the centre of this fiasco and waste of public money is the department of agriculture whose officials have been groping for answers and refusing to come on record.The department of agricultural marketing and agri business in Perambalur district has been well-known for production of small onion (sambar onion) and onion seeds.The seeds produced here are supplied to various parts of the state and neighbouring Karnataka. After harvesting the seeds, the stock is preserved under `Patty' (conventional storage technique) for a few months.As the produce is perishable in nature, the government constructed the onion marketing complex at Chettikulam at a cost of `1.15 crore. This included `11 lakh for establishing cold storage, `22 lakh for refrigeration system and generator for `6.50 lakh.Elixir Engineering company had executed the project and handed over the facility to the agriculture business officials on February 25, 2014. The then chief minister J Jayalalithaa inaugurated the complex on June 26, 2014 which started to function from September 17, 2014.However, the far mers found to their surprise that their produce when stored in the cold was perishing as the structure was technically unfit to preserve shallots. The Centre was forced to transform into a mere auction centre and the farmers returned to their conventional method of storing at their farm land itself.""Usually we don't store onion in refrigerators. Without knowing this basic fact, how can officials spend more than a crore of rupees for such a facility.

Our conventional method of storing was effective for a maximum of six months. We thought that without spending much, we could store our produce. But in reality the produce we kept in cold storage, completely perished"", Mani lamented.A Natesan of Irur village in Perambalur said officials had claimed that onions could be stored upto 10 months in the cold storage, but it couldn't last even a few days.After coming to know that the facility with a capacity of 50 metric tonne was not fit for storing onions the officials rented it out for storing fruits through TANFED. However, as no one come forward to use the cold storage, it was further let out to a farmer for storing horse gram and green gram.As he did not pay his dues, he was asked to vacate and the facility has been lying vacant since June 30 this year.Agriculture department officials refused to respond when contacted by TOI."

Records published by the Nashik-based National Horticulture Research and Development Foundation (NHRDF) showed that 13,56,381.48 metric tonnes (MT) of onions have been exported till September this year. This is a significant rise as compared to the 11,14,418.13 MT export of the vegetable in 2015. Although only about 10 per cent of the onion grown in the country has been exported, the figure is important to keep the price parity in wholesale markets.Watch What Else is Making NewsOver the past several months, onions were being sold at Rs 7 per kg in the Lasalgaon wholesale market here, causing losses to the growers.Last year, the average price of the produce in the same market was Rs 20 per kg. Excess production, especially in Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka, has been cited as the reason for the present glut, which had ensured that the prices remain subdued throughout the year.Earlier this year, the price of the bulb had touched an all-time low at Lasalgaon market as it was being traded at Rs 4.25 per kg  a record low in the last five years. In order to boost the price, the Central government had announced a 6 per cent export subsidy, which had helped in pushing some of the produce out of India.Jagdish Apsunde, an exporter from Nashik, said, at present, the Indian onions have good prices in UAE, Saudi Arabia, Malaysia and Sri Lanka. The minimum export price (MRP) is at zero and arrival of the bulb in the market is good. These two factors have at least ensured steady exports, he said. The export figures this year have surpassed the exports in the last two years.

,,,,,,,58d6c963a3d24b1894a6b23c,Here's why rates of some vegetables are seeing a dip,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/heres-why-rates-of-some-vegetables-are-seeing-a-dip/articleshow/56228798.cms,2016-12-29,"NEW DELHI: Tomato and other vegetables prices, including those of onion and potato, have come down after demonetisation. But the National Horticulture Board , which tracks horticultural produce markets across the country , has found that the fall has more to do with transporters' resistance to pick up the produce from farms than to a poor cash flow at the farmers' end.Ground reports, shared with the board, have noted a pattern where middlemen have been trying to misuse the situation, creating logistical problems, making lifting of produce difficult. This year, because of a bumper crop, the apparent non-cooperation of transporters hasn't yet affected retail vegetable rates as much. While some of the output is perforce being left to rot in the fields, much of it is still making its way to the retail markets, preventing an even steeper fall. The transporter problem, ground reports indicate, is particularly visible in some states such as Karnataka. This state had a bumper tomato crop this year.Though middlemen try to play with the market sentiment after demonetisation, the December, post-harvest fall in prices in one or the other region isn't unusual. Ground reports with the board noted that the transporters' resistance in certain regions needs to be probed.Comparative wholesale price figures of November 9 and December 27 from six major markets show that the fall pattern isn't uniform for all regions. Onion rates have actually risen in Chennai, Kolkata and Nashik.""The fall in the vegetable prices is nothing unusual at this time. We have noticed a steep fall in the wholesale rates of perishable items even in the past when certain regions had bumper crops. We have examples where farmers had to dump their produce because of logistical reasons transport or absence of cold chain"", said A K Singh, managing director of the National Horticulture Board (NHB). ""The current crisis may be attributed to a number of factors, including inadequate storage and absence of processing units closer to the farms,"" Singh said.Agriculture ministry officials too expressed doubts over the role of certain lobbies to create a situation where farmers had to dump their produce. India produces about 170 million metric tonnes of vegetables where the share of potato, onion and tomato together is nearly 50%. Potato accounts for nearly one-fourth of the total production. The government generally intervenes to boost its export after bumper crops. The D-G foreign trade on Tuesday removed the minimum export price on potato."
