Prakash Kammardi. This situation has arisen as there is a bountiful harvest of various crops because of good rains in other States as well as countries. Either the cheap crops from other States are entering our markets or there is no demand for our produce in other markets because of glut in their own areas, he said.It is like rubbing salt into the wound of farmers who have already suffered crop losses owing to serious drought or floods as they may have to not only suffer reduction in yield, but also crash in the prices, notes the The Perspective and Forecasting report by the KAPC.According to the commissions report, what has complicated the matter is the impact of demonetisation. This has prevented the recovery of prices of some crops besides leading to a dip in the price of others owing to poor cash flow in the markets, Dr. Kammardi said.The commissions report has pointed out that the prices of tomato and onion have crashed by 84 per cent and 70 per cent respectively, when compared with the earlier level; and that of copra and arecanut have seen a dip of 47 per cent and 7 per cent respectively after demonetisation.The commission has suggested to the State government to take up the issue with NABARD as well as the Union government to increase the daily money withdrawal limit for farm traders in agricultural produce marketing committees (APMC) in the interest of farmers.Pointing out that the norms related to monetary withdrawal limits from banks were relaxed for tea growers of some areas, Dr. Kammardi sought similar benefit to be extended to APMCs as nearly 41 per cent of the trading of farm produce takes place in these markets.This is one of the worst harvest seasons for farmers in terms of prices in the last several decades. This has resulted owing to glut in production in other States/countries coupled with the impact of demonetisation.T.N. Prakash Kammaradi, Chairman, Karnataka Agriculture Price Commission"

So, notebandias demonetisation is called colloquiallycouldnt have come at a worse time. With money sucked out of the market, there was a tomato glut, and prices crashed by 80%.A 15-kg crate of tomatoes traded this year between Rs 30 and Rs 50 (instead of Rs 700 at its peak), said Kumar. I had no reason to spend on transportation and bring it to the market or wait for the price to pick up. So, I uprooted all my tomato plants in late November to minimise the loss. This is the worst we have seen in my experience.Kolar is the biggest vegetable-growing region in Karnataka, and houses Asias second-largest tomato market. In November, the ruling price of tomatoes in the Kolar market was Rs 3-5 per kg, or 85% lesser than the same time in 2015.Kumars case is echoed across India. The price of tomatoes crashed to 25 paise/kg, The New Indian Express reported on December 10, 2016, which prompted farmers in a Chhattisgarh district to dump nearly 100 tractor-trolleys, or about 45,000 kg, of tomatoes, on a national highway.Similar incidents by frustrated farmers were reported in Nashik, Hyderabad and other key vegetable-growing regions.Worst hit: Southern tomato farmers, western onion farmersTomato farmers in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu were the worst hit since prices fell by 60-85% while onion farmers were the worst hit in Maharashtra and Gujarat, according to an IndiaSpend analysis of vegetable prices in seven Indian citiesAhmedabad, Bengaluru, Chennai, Hyderabad, Delhi, Kolkata and Mumbaibetween November 2015 and November 2016.Source: National Horticulture Board; Negative values indicate rise in pricesThe price of potatoes, which have a shelf life of up to 2-3 months, was stable in places such as Delhi and Chennai, while it rose between 17% and 25% in Bengaluru and Mumbai. The price of potatoes per quintal was Rs 1,086 in November 2015, increasing 27% to Rs 1,376 in November 2016.The price of peas dropped between 15% and 20%, with arrivals increasing in six cities, except Mumbai.The crash in prices was also due to oversupply, the data show. While the prices of tomatoes (hybrid variety) fell by 55-85%, the supply was double and even triple the previous year in parts of India, such as Ahmedabad, Kolkata and Hyderabad, according to data from the National Horticulture Board.In Chennai, for instance, the maximum price a farmer could get per quintal of tomatoes in November 2016 was Rs 760, compared to Rs 4,900 in November 2015, a drop of 85%. The supply to the city was 2,910 metric tonne, an increase of 40% from 2015.In Hyderabad, prices dropped 60% but supply increased 337% in November.Onions were traded anywhere between Rs 650 and Rs 1,500 per quintal in November 2016, compared to Rs 3,027 to Rs 5,600 in 2015.At the Lasalgaon Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) in Nashik, Maharashtra, Indias largest wholesale onion market, onions were sold at between Rs 5 and Rs 7 a kilogram.In the seven cities we analysed data for, supply was 196,400 metric tonne in November 2016, against 186,175 metric tonne in November 2015.The situation worsened in December, as prices fell by another 20-50%, and peas traded at a 10-year low in the Delhi market, according to officials from the horticulture department.Enough rains ensured a good harvest but low pricesThe monsoon rains would subside during September to November, and it would result in lesser yield, indicating lesser supply and higher prices, Bellur Krishna, managing director of the state-owned Horticultural Producers Co-operative Marketing and Processing Society, told IndiaSpend. This year, the rainfall was good in the vegetable-growing regions of Karnataka.This led to good harvest but the prices are also down due to the cash crisis triggered by demonetisation, he said.Kolar, Belagavi, Haveri and Chitradurga, the top vegetable-growing regions in Karnataka, received normal rainfall during the south-west monsoon in 2016.Karnataka declared a drought in 22 districts and some additional talukas in October 2016; the state received Rs 1,782 crore from the central government, IndiaSpend reported on January 10, 2016.The impact of demonetisation could only be to the extent of 20% of the price fall, said Krishna.Demonetisation is expected to hurt agriculture and informal-sector workers, IndiaSpend had reported on November 15, 2016.Around 9.4 million hectares, or 10% of Indias cropped area, is under vegetable cultivation, of which 50% is given to potato, onion and tomato, according to Horticulture Board data.Most of the transactions in fruits and vegetables are in cash, Brajendra Singh, director, National Horticulture Board, told IndiaSpend. So, demonetisation has definitely had some bearing. Arrivals had increased; so, the downturn was obvious.Tomato cultivation is usually routed through market clusters (around cities) and is profitable, Singh said.This time, it was available from local sources, said Singh. The price of tomatoes had gone up to Rs 50 a kg over the last two years. This year, the climate was favourable and resulted in bumper crops. Suddenly, the markets were depressed due to oversupply and because there was no cash.Singh predicted the situation would be normal over the next quarter, and crops would fetch a good price for farmers by the summer of 2017."
58f4d4aa60de470aa339c749,in luring avatars at food court,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170209/jsp/jharkhand/story_134743.jsp,2017-02-09,"A kitchen staff of GoLitti prepares the traditional delicacy at the Dangratoli outlet in Ranchi on Wednesday. (Hardeep Singh) The humble litti of Bihar-Jharkhand is on the roast for bon vivants from across the world. Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), the event manager of the Global Investors' Summit (GIS) in Ranchi, has roped in grub start-up GoLitti for the GIS food court in Hotwar on February 16-17 and the latter hopes to take the desi litti places with its trendy Chinese and Italian range of the traditional atta-sattu preparation. GoLitti - the state's lone branded litti joint that opened shop at Eastern Mall on Dangratoli Road only last month - is the brainchild of three friends, two of them BIT-Mesra alumni and the third a chartered accountant who left a plum job with Goldman Sachs in Bangalore to realise a big dream out of a small dough. Recalling his amazing culinary journey along with school friends and businessmen Kamal Bagla (23) and Sameer Kataruka (24), chartered accountant-turned-food manager Ankush Raj (23) told this newspaper how the inherent desire to make the homemade litti popular like the samosa or momo gave birth to GoLitti. ""A few years ago, when I moved to Delhi for my CA studies, I missed our litti-chokha, which is basically a super healthy baked dough ball stuffed with sattu (chickpea flour) and served with roasted and mashed potatoes, tomatoes, onion, chillies and spices. I shared my cravings with my Bridgeford School pals Kamal and Sameer one day, months later, and all of a sudden we had the idea,"" said Ankush. Raising a brand from a drawing room idea was no easy task. ""But, if there's will, there's a way. I quit Goldman Sachs in September last year and came to Ranchi. My businessmen friends, who are BBA graduates from BIT-Mesra, backed my dream while my mother Rita Sinha (49), a great cook, helped us rediscover litti in many avatars,"" Ankush said. GoLitti was born on January 15 this year, and is already a hot favourite with local residents and visitors alike, which includes representatives of the CII. ""We sell litti under two categories - evergreen and trendy. The first comprises the traditional baked variety along with Jain (no onion and garlic) and ghee-fried. The trendy menu boasts manchurian, schezwan, shashlik, corn, paneer, dahi, matar and mixed vegetable varieties among others,"" Ankush said, adding that officials of CII liked their preparations so much that the invite to join the GIS food court was almost immediate. And all this for just Rs 40 to Rs 95 a plate! ""We wanted to make litti loveable for all and we did it. Nothing pleases us more than when customers exclaim 'wow' after tasting our food. We will open a second joint in Ranchi in April. We are keeping fingers crossed and hoping that the summit will help us take GoLitti global,"" Ankush added."

What's more, it may also be sweeter and better than the current crop.The Directorate of Onion and Garlic Research (DOGR) of the Indian Council of Agriculture Research (ICAR) has developed a new onion variety called 'multiplier onion variety,' which would make this possible.It is presently undergoing tests at multiple locations in Maharashtra, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Gujarat to evaluate its performance in different weather conditions. Scientists said initial findings of the tests are positive and have achieved the desired results so far.They added that the variety is expected to be released nationwide in 2019.Project leader Amar Jeet Gupta of DOGR told TOI, ""There is no special variety of onion for south Indian dishes that has been released at the national level. So far, farmers of Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh are cultivating varieties developed by Tamil Nadu Agriculture University (TNAU). But the yield of these varieties is limited. Hence, we decided to develop the special variety, which can be recommended at national-level for other states farmers to grow it.""The variety, named DOGR-1549-Agg, is the first multiplier onion genotype registered with the ICAR-NBPGR (National Bureau of Plant Genetic Resources) in New Delhi.Commenting on the variety's strength, Gupta said, ""It matures early and is suitable for both Kharif (July-October) and Rabi (October-March) seasons. It has an average yield potential of 22 tonnes to 24 tonnes per hectare."" Gupta added that the variety has six small bulbs per cluster.Presently, farmers in South India are growing TNAU-developed onion variety called CO(On)5, which can grow only in Rabi season and has a yield capacity of 18.9 tonnes per hectare. Each cluster of this variety produces three to five bulbs, Gupta said.TNAU's horticulture department head T Saraswati told TOI, ""This is a positive development for growers as they can get high harvest. Secondly, if this variety is released nationally, states other than the southern ones can also grow it.""When specifically asked about the taste of the newly-developed variety, Gupta said, ""Total Soluble Solids (TSS) is a crucial factor as it defines sugar percentage in the onion. The TSS of CO(On)5 is around 12%, whereas TSS in our variety is between 16% and 22%. Hence, it will be suitable for South Indian dishes."""

The Act makes it mandatory for farmers to sell their produce only to the licensed merchants at the mandis of Agricultural Produce Marketing Committees (APMCs) by paying the commission and other charges.Denotification of fruits and vegetables, according to the Centre, will put an end to a chain of commission agents between the farmers and the consumers, creating a win-win situation for both. Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley made a strong pitch for the denotification and promoting contract farming in his 2017-18 Budget presented recently.But the Karnataka government holds a different view. We have no intention to denotify perishables (from the Act). Even now the farmers are free to sell their produce directly to consumers anywhere, including APMC yards. Moreover, the government will not be in a position to intervene and provide justice to the farmers if the traders refuse to pay judicious price, Additional Secretary to Co-operation department (APMC reforms) R Manoj said.As per the Department of Agriculture Marketing, cost to the supply chain due to handling of fruits and vegetables at APMCs is only 6% of the total cost of the produce. Cost of supply chain include 5% commission and 1% hamali and other handling cost. This cost will be significantly higher in unorganised sector due to involvement of middlemen at multiple levels.Interestingly, the ruling Congress has refused to denotify perishables despite directions from the party vice president Rahul Gandhi to all the Congress-ruled state governments in 2014. Instead, the Karnataka government exempted levy of market fee on farmers (1.5% on fruits and 1% on vegetables) and made a provision for retail sales at APMC yards.Chairman of Food Processing Committee of Federation of Karnataka Chambers of Commerce and Industries Bharat Shah said APMCs help farmers get competitive price to their produce due to the involvement of large number of traders. Besides, the farmers get necessary logistical support such as storage place at APMCs. As far as consumers are concerned, prices of fruits and vegetables are normally the lowest at APMCs compared to other places, he added, opposing the move to denotify perishables."

Onions continue to fetch Rs380-460 per quintal, as against the production cost of Rs 950 per quintal at the Lasalgaon AMPC market , Asia's largest onion market yard. Compared to last year, there has been over-production of 25 lakh metric tonnes of onions.Although only about 10% onions grown in the country have been exported, the figure is important to keep price parity in wholesale markets.Exporters said the central government's decision of giving a 6% export subsidy helped push some of the produce out of India.According to figures from the market committee, a daily supply of 30,000-35,000 tonnes is coming in to the market yard, as against 12,000-15,000 tonnes last year.Due to good rain and increase in area under production, it has been a bumper crop but the prices that slid last December due to demonetisation are struggling to stabilize even now, the fag end of the season.An exporter from Nashik said there was demand for Indian onions abroad and they fetched good prices. UAE, Saudi Arabia and Malaysia are some buyers.Bumper production in states like Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka too has been cited as the reason for the glut, which had ensured that prices remain subdued throughout the year. State government officials said there have also been issues with storage in market yards. The entire dip in price and other losses due to rotting and lack of storage capacity is estimated to be close to Rs 800 crore."

They are more in demand over the Bellary onions, say traders.Over the past few days, small onions are being sold Rs. 30 to Rs. 45 a kg depending on quality at the wholesale outlet at Gandhi Market. The price has gone up by Rs. 15 a kg over the past one month. In the retail market, top quality small onions were being sold at Rs. 50 a kg.Arrivals have come down to just 50 tonnes a day. There is no local supply. Normally we get about 200 tonnes of small onions a day, said A. Thangaraj, general secretary, Tiruchi Onion Commission Mandi Traders Association. Supplies from Dharapuram and Udumalpet met the local demands in the nearby districts, he said.Perambalur and Tiruchi are the major onion producing districts in the State. The crop is raised on over 8,000 hectares in Perambalur district and on about 4,000 hectares in Tiruchi district. However, stocks with onion growers in Perambalur and Thuraiyur are mostly held back as seeds for the next season.The failure of the monsoon has led to the situation. There has been a severe drop in yield and many farmers had not gone for the crop as there was no rain in Perambalur district. In some places, the crops have withered. Even those who managed to raise the crop have reported sharp drop in yield,said R.Raja Chidambaram, state secretary, Tamizhaga Vivasayigal Sangam.Mr.Thangaraj said that the price of small onions is not likely to come down at least for next five to six months as there is no scope for fresh crops in the summer.Meanwhile, the price of Bellary onions, currently ruling at around Rs. 11 a kg at the market, could go up slightly though steadily in the days to come as the short supply of small onions would result in a higher demand for the bigger onion variety, he said."

The annual income of the applicant should not exceed Rs 1.2 lakh to be eligible for a BPL card."

Iskcon , in fact, hinted at politics behind the issue.According to government and Iskcon sources, pressure from the hoteliers' lobby is said to have led to scrapping the deal, as this section felt any move to centralize the system by getting Ikscon alone to supply food would hurt its business immensely. ""Hoteliers were worried that if Iskcon supplies food across the city, then they'd lose a substantial portion of their business at specific high-volume locations,"" said a senior government official. Result: Indira Canteens will now be decentralised, with the government likely to call for tenders at a more local level and have hoteliers in the vicinity bid to supply subsidized food.""Iskcon is committed to supplying hygienic, quality and tasty food. We are happy the government has taken a decision in this regard by inviting tenders. We will move on,"" said an Iskcon spokesperson. However, sources within the society said they were being forced out simply because of logistical issues and politics and that not using onion and garlic was just an ""excuse"".According to Iskcon, its Akshya Patra Foundation supplies to canteens in five other states apart from Karnataka (Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Gujarat, Rajasthan and Odisha) and there too the food served doesn't have onion or garlic. However, those governments are happy with the quality and taste, it said.The organization also points to logistical concerns. Considering the mid-day meal scheme is its primary focus, it'd be difficult to supply three meals a day, it said. ""If we were to supply food for three meals, then the focus would shift from our primary goal of mid-day meal for kids. While politics has been a prime factor, the change in plan (earlier the talk was about supplying one meal a day. Later it changed to three) was also a reason,"" said a member of Iskcon.The government also admitted logistics was a deal-breaker, considering Iskcon may not be able to offer variety and would stick to a certain menu with its centralized kitchen.""With hoteliers, not only will food be available faster, there will be also more variety at the canteens,"" said an official.A ccording to government sources, the canteen contracts will now be packaged for 10 or 15 wards and bids will be called for a single hotelier to supply breakfast, lunch and dinner. The government is expected to consider only those hotels which have large chains or networks in the city. This is to maintain uniformity in hygiene and quality of food. Besides, the government may supply the ingredients through its public distribution system to ease burden on the state exchequer."

The strike is set to enter the fourth day on Monday. While prices of some vegetables have crashed, there's glut of others because they aren't being lifted from the city and its neighbouring villages. Also, some vegetables have become dearer as they aren't being ferried to the city, leading to a shortage.""I got my last delivery of onions three days ago. I was supposed to receive another shipment on Monday, but now that doesn't seem likely,"" said Seyid, 21, a vendor in KR Market . While Seyid continued to sell onions at the same price as before, he said he might be forced to jack up the rates if he doesn't get new stock soon.Pushpa and Venkateshappa get their provisions from the Kalasipalya wholesale market. The couple normally trades in cauliflowers, drumsticks and carrots. ""It's very bad. We last got a delivery two days ago. We haven't been getting anything fresh. The cauliflowers have begun to rot. I usually sell each cauliflower head for Rs 25-30. Now, with everything spoiling, I wouldn't even get Rs 10 for a piece,"" said Pushpa, adding normally she would sell carrots and drumsticks for Rs 15-20 per kilo, but the prices have shot up to Rs 35-40 due to the strike.Pyarejaan, 64, who gets onions from the Yeshwanthpur APMC four times a week, said he hasn't faced any problem so far, but might in a couple of days when he'll run out of stock. Ibraz Khan, a wholesaler in Kalasipalya, gets his produce from Karnataka, Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh. While his prevailing stocks will last for a few days, he says he isn't receiving new shipments.""If there is a shortage of a particular vegetable, the price will rise. But if there is an excess, we'll have to lower the prices substantially,"" he said. ""Since truckers are on strike in south India, I'll have to pay Rs 5,000-15,000 extra to those ferrying potatoes from northern states,"" he added.Ilias, a potato, onion and garlic wholeseller, said that his stock will last only two more days. ""Price per bori (50kg sack) has gone up by Rs 50. Additionally, we were earlier selling onions at Rs 10 per kg; now the price has increased to Rs 15,"" he said.""As of now vans and tempos seem to be doing most of the transporting, something that may not be sustainable in the long run as they aren't equipped for inter-state deliveries,"" he added.Vendors in Russel Market were largely unaware of the ongoing strike and said business is continuing as usual. Aslam Amin, a vendor, said three tempos come from the City Market every day with his stock, and that the strike hasn't disrupted this schedule. ""Our stock will last for another week, so we haven't been affected. However, if the strike continues, we might have a problem,"" said Mushtaq Ahmed, a vendor who gets his vegetables from Yeshwantpur and Kalasipalya markets.Noor, a small-time vendor, gets 10-15 kg of each vegetable every day, but received his last shipment two days ago. ""If this goes on, I won't have anything to sell,"" he said.Truckers are protesting the Centre's move to scrap old vehicles and levy toll on state highways, and are demanding a reduction in third-party premium paid to insurance firms.Not in a mood to relent, truckers intensified their strike on Sunday with nearly 23 lakh vehicles transporting important commodities staying off the roads.G R Shanmugappa, president of the Karnataka State Lorry Owners and Agents Association, said they'd continue their protest till they get a response from the central government and the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA).""Some 23 lakh trucks stayed off the roads on Sunday throughout the south zone. We have also got an assurance from LPG association workers that they'll support us in our protest. There are only three filling stations for the four southern states - in Mangaluru, Vizag and Salem and they have informed us that they'll not go in for filling. We are also in talks with petrol and diesel association workers who have said they will join us from Monday,"" he said.The truckers are protesting high insurance premiums and scrapping of old vehicles. According to Shanmugappa, private insurance companies are hand in glove with central government agencies as well as IRDA to ensure that decisions benefit them alone. ""They do this once a year. Hike the rates and wait for the money to flow in. They earn crores through this. But we'll not give up till we get some respite,"" he said.However, the truckers' leader said they had not interfered with the supply of certain crucial commodities. ""We have not disrupted transportation of some essential commodities like milk, medicines and water because we don't want the public to suffer. However, the supply of wheat flour, corn meal, finger millet and other foodgrains has been affected,"" he said.Commenting on the strike, chief minister Siddaramaiah on Sunday said that he has directed transport minister Ramalinga Reddy to hold meetings with the truckers' association to resolve the issue soon."

Representative imageThe proposed Indira canteens have hit a new hurdle with two major hoteliers associations conveying to the Karnataka government that they cannot supply food for the proposed outlets as it is not feasible for them from the economic point of view.Chief Minister Siddaramaiah had set aside Rs 100 crore in the budget for 2017-18 to establish Indira canteens in the 198 wards of Bengaluru. It is almost designed on the lines of Amma canteens of Tamil Nadu. It is supposed to serve breakfast, lunch and dinner at an affordable price.Initially, the government had been in talks with Iskcon for supply of food to these canteens. The government wants garlic and onion in the food. But, Iskcon expressed its inability to use both in its preparations. Later, the government approached two major hoteliers associations.The hoteliers associations are not interested in the offer made by the government. For them, it is a conflict of interest. Any involvement in running the canteens including supply of food will mean affecting their own business interest, they say. This despite the government stating that it will reimburse the expenses and also ensure the hoteliers make profit.Bruhat Bengaluru Hotels Association, with around 2,000 hotels in BBMP region as its members, was approached by the Food and Civil Supplies Department to supply food to the canteens. The 81-year-old association, which is one of the oldest in Karnataka, has outright rejected the proposal.We have our own problems. Catering is not an easy task. There is shortage of manpower. So, we rejected it, Association President B Chandrashekar Hebbar said.Hebbar said the hoteliers were asked to provide details like quantity and ingredients that will be going into the food preparations and also their rate chart. However, the association did not respond.Karnataka Pradesh Hoteliers and Restaurants Association, which is an umbrella organisation comprising hoteliers associations in all districts, too has rejected the government offer. Its president M Rajendra, like Hebbar, has said it is not financially viable to supply prepared food.Besides, he said the concept of providing subsidised food itself is flawed. Any government should help the poor stand up on their own. They should feel proud that they are earning. They should not be made to depend on any freebies, Rajendra said.Food and Civil Supplies Minister U T Khader said the reason his department approached the hoteliers was to utilise their expertise. We had explained to them that their business will not be affected as the canteens are meant not to wean away their regular customers but for the poor, Khader said.He said the government is not banking only on the hoteliers for supplies. Many NGOs, youth associations and even individuals have come forward showing interest in the scheme. We will talk to them soon."

Petrol and diesel tankers, however, continued to ply although they have supported the strike.The South India Motor Transport Association (SIMTA) has been on strike objecting to the Centres decision to raise third-party insurance premium of vehicles by as much as 50 per cent.Ramesh Chandra Lahoti, president of Bengaluru Wholesale Foodgrains and Pulses Merchants Association, said, Except onion and potato, supply of all other perishable goods has been hit. There is shortage of essentials like sugar, jaggery and pulses.He added, Transactions have been impacted heavily, especially in Yeshwantpur market. Although the protest has extended to other states in the south, there have been no issues in Chennai and Puducherry.Mysuru and Bengaluru are bearing the brunt.Secretary of Akhila Karnataka Federation of Petroleum Traders Ranjith Hegde said, Petrol pumps across the state are open and tankers are plying. We have extended our support symbolically and we totally disagree with the taxes and hike in insurance premium.However, we have innumerable formalities like writing letters to oil companies to be carried out before we join the protest physically. The decision to formally join them will be taken after discussion, he said.Voicing similar opinion, Bhushan Narang, president of Bangalore Petroleum Dealers Association, said, There is no impact on petrol or diesel. Vehicles are moving as usual. As of now, there are no plans to join the protest.Ravindra, a member of SIMTA, said that representatives of central government are likely to call for a meeting on Wednesday to discuss the matter.He said, Petrol and diesel associations are supposed to join the strike from Wednesday. Around 4,000 tankers were off the roads on Tuesday.We will launch an all-India protest on April 8 if our demands are not met."

Jagan Mohan Reddy on Tuesday warned that he would take the fight on behalf of farmers to the doorstep of the Assembly unless Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu takes concrete steps to mitigate their plight.Making an emotional speech to mark the conclusion of his two-day Rythu Deeksha here, Mr. Reddy said his party would raise issues concerning farmers during the short Assembly session to be held during the second week of this month.He said the prices of edible and commercial crops had touched a record low and cited chilli as an example.Mr. Jagan alleged that Mr. Naidu had broken his own record of inflicting misery on farmers for the third consecutive year. Mr. Naidu has always supported contractors. He never hesitates to highlight the costs involved in the construction of the Pattiseema project, Handri-Neeva, Galeru, and the Secretariat citing inflation but has never bothered to raise burning issues such as support price for farm produce and mess charges to students studying in welfare hostels, Mr. Reddy said.The State governments apathy in dealing with issues concerning farmers was evident as banks failed to meet the targets in both the kharif and rabi seasons.Out of the 1.4 lakh accounts of farmers, 40 lakh accounts have become either overdue or non-performing assets (NPA) accounts, said Mr. Reddy.Mass migrationThe YSRC leader said mass migration of farm labour had become a regular phenomenon. The lack of water and scarcity of fodder had forced many farmers to migrate to neighbouring States of Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Kerala.In Kurnool, farmers cultivating onion in nearly 29,000 hectares are forced to sell it at just Rs. 1.50 per kg. Those protesting against the fall in prices are being threatened with police cases, he said.Party leaders Ummareddy Venkateswarlu, Marri Rajasekhar, Ambati Rambabu, Lavu Krishnadevarayulu, MLAs Kodali Nani, Pinnelli Ramakrishna Reddy, and Lella Appireddy were present."

The farmers at the Kurnool Agriculture Market Yard are waiting for buyers keeping their produce in heaps. Buyers are not showing any interest to lift the stocks as farmers are not coming forward for distress sale as yet.Last year, the price offered to farmers was about `13,000 but this year the price has fallen to an all-time low of `1,500 to `2,000 per quintal. The farmers are caught in a bind as they cannot resort to distress sale or they cannot take it back either as they do not know what do with the produce.R Ramakrishna Reddy, a buyer at Kurnool Market Yard said: We would have purchased chilli at a better price but the quality is very poor. He was not sure if the government would pay them subsidy later. We were taken for a ride in the past. The government announced subsidy for onion last year but till date the arrears have not been cleared.Let the government first clear the arrears. Then we will purchase chilli, he added. Farmers at their wits end G Venkateswarlu, a farmer from Remata village said that he had raised chilli in five acres by investing huge amount borrowed from money lenders.After harvesting, he had brought the crop to the market yard but there are no buyers there. He says, To some extent, what the buyers say is true. The quality of chilli we have is poor this time compared to last year as there has been drought in the district for the last three years. There is no groundwater and whatever water we could strike is alkaline and not fit for watering the crop.We are forced to throw away the crop in the garbage as we are not even recovering the money spent on transportation from the farm to the market yard in Kurnool, K Venkataramudu, a farmer from Guduru village stated. He urged the government to help them out by buying their produce or else they are forced to commit suicide.Every day, we are hearing news about farmer suicides from droughthit regions. However, with red chilli prices touching new low, farmers like me may be meeting the same fate, Venkataramudu lamented. Kurnool agriculture market yard secretary A Narayana Murthy said that they will start a special counter to purchase red chilli under subsidy price scheme.Already the government has announced the subsidy scheme and we are waiting for orders. The quality of red chilli is being sold at a minimum rate of `500 per quintal and maximum of `3,000 per quintal, at present, in wholesale market, he added. In Nellore too, problem is same.The mirchi farmers in the district are literally in tears because of the market fluctuations. Though the area of cultivation had increased when compared to the last year, green chillie farmers in upland areas are a distressed lot due to steep fall in prices.On the other hand, red chilli farmers are flooding the Guntur Mirchi Yard to sell their produce at remunerative prices. Farmers buoyed by profits in the previous year, increased area under cultivation in the district. Majority of the farmers in upland mandals such as Vinjamur, Kaligiri, Kondapuram, Jaladanki, Duttalur, Varikuntapadu, Udayagiri and Seetharamapuram had cultivated red chillie. According to sources, 1,150 farmers had cultivated green and red chilli in 3,075 hectares this year.Out of 3,075 hectares, red chilli was raised in 2,104 hectares. Out of 2,104 hectares, red chilli was raised in 329 hectares in Vinjamur, 466 in Kaligiri, 113 in Kondapuram, 84 in Jaladanki, 153 in Duttalur, 21 in Varikuntapadu, 1.2 in Seetharamapuram and 4 hectares in Seetharamapuram mandal. Green chilli growers tense Green chilli, which is chiefly used in curries, is a perishable crop by nature and the growers cannot preserve it in cold storage plants as is the case of red chilli waiting for a favourable market environment. We are issuing cultivation certificates to chilli farmers to sell their produce at remunerative prices under Market Intervention Scheme.The government is initiating steps for price stabilisation by eliminating middlemen in the process of procurement, said Anuradha, a Horticulture official. It may be mentioned here that farmers in Atmakur division had earned `3 lakh to `4 lakh profit per acre last year by selling green chilli in Maharashtra and Karnataka.The farmers invested `1.75 lakh on mirchi cultivation in one hectare this year. According to sources, farmers cultivated green chilli in around 3,200 acres in Anantasagaram, Marripadu and Atmakur mandals this year. In the previous year, green chilli was raised in 2,300 acres of land. I invested `30,000 per acre to harvest the crop. I paid a daily wage of `120 to each labourer"

The price had gone up gradually since then. It was Rs. 120 a kg in grocery shops on Tuesday. The price was same in vegetable chain stores in the city. In Uzhavar Sandhai, it wasRs. 84 a kg. In Gandhi market, which has a number of whole trading houses for onion, the price of onion (first quality) was hovering between Rs. 80 and Rs. 94. Second quality was sold between Rs. 60 and Rs. 70. The price of one bag of small onion (50 kg) was quoted between Rs. 4000 and Rs. 4700 on Tuesday.The prices of onion are shooting up. It had never reached Rs. 100 a kg in wholesale market in Tiruchi. I expect that it will definitely breach Rs. 100 mark this year, said R. Naresh of Rajaganapathy traders in Gandhi market. Tiruchi market receives onion loads from Thuraiyur, Perambalur, Mysuru, Sathiyamangalam, Samjarnagar, Kollegal and Pollachi. On an average, it gets 15 to 20 loads (12 tonnes each load). However, market source said that arrival had come down to just four loads a day.There has been a severe drought in most of the onion growing areas in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. Crop failure had been reported in several areas. The prices are likely to shoot up further in the next few weeks, Mr. Naresh added."

A Horticorp stall in-charge said the prices were in the Rs. 28-Rs. 30 range even a month ago. With no ready stock available, prices were on the way up. However, these will come down in another 15-20 days, he said.The Vegetable and Fruit Promotion Council Keralams daily market prices at Chala was Rs. 80 a kg for wholesale and Rs. 90 a kg for retail as per its website.A vegetable seller in Karamana said shallots were available for Rs. 110 a kg, but the good quality ones were priced at Rs. 120. Shallot prices had crossed Rs. 100 a kg three or four years ago too, but largely went unnoticed because of a simultaneous climb in onion prices.Shallots are mostly cultivated in Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, and Andhra Pradesh. The current price rise is attributed to a fall in production. A friend of mine who exports vegetables said shallots were coming from the fields at Rs. 120 a kg.A vegetable commission agent at Chala said small onion was priced in the Rs. 70-Rs. 105 range depending on quality, though it had touched Rs. 115 some days ago. The current hike in prices was owing to a fall in production, leading to fewer truckloads arriving in the city markets.These are also exported in substantal quantities, he said.Small onion prices would come down in a month, he said, warning that in another month or two onion prices were likely to shoot up."

It seems the State is not keen on taking the financial burden to protect farmers from selling their produce at distress price, Union Agriculture Minister Radha Mohan Singh told a BJP delegation from Odisha.The basic objective of MIS is to provide remunerative prices to farmers in case of glut in production and fall in prices. However, the MIS is implemented on specific request of the State Government willing to share the loss with Central Government on 50:50 basis, Singh said.It has been brought to my notice that Odisha farmers are incurring huge losses due to fall in prices of onion which is being sold at `3-4 a kg. But there is no proposal yet from the State Government for market intervention under MIS, the Union Minister told the delegation.The Uttar Pradesh Government has taken the benefit of the scheme this year to protect potato growing farmers, Singh said and added that Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu had successfully gone for market intervention under MIS last year.Stating that MIS is for procurement of agricultural and horticultural commodities which are generally perishable in nature, the Union Minister said though funds are not allocated to the States, the Centre shares the loss of farmers based on specific proposals received from them.With a bumper harvest of onion this year, the State is staring at a possible crisis of the vegetable due to lack of storage facility. As the Centre expects about six per cent decrease in onion production against last year, it has advised the State Government to take timely ameliorative measures to tackle any potential crisis in onion during the lean season.On the day, the State Government advised the Horticulture Department to give stress on informing farmers to store their produce to meet the demand during crisis time.Though the State Government is giving 50 per cent subject to a maximum of `87,500 for construction of onion storage facility under Horticulture Mission, there are hardly any takers.While a 20-tonne onion storage facility costs about `1.75 lakh, the farmers have to bear the cost to reimburse the subsidy amount later. Most of the onion growers do not have the financial capability to spend such a huge amount, official sources said."

A shortage of cash because of demonetisation. Despite Rs 3.5 lakh crore  enough to build 545 Tehri-sized dams  invested over six decades to 2011, more than half of all farms depend on rains. These are the three factors agitating Indians who depend on farming  90 million families, or 54.6% of Indias 1.2 billion people.As anger sweeps rural Madhya Pradesh after the death of six farmers in police firing, farm protests roil rural Maharashtra -- wholesale markets are shut, produce is being dumped on streets -- and governments of the debt-ridden states struggle to respond to demands for loan waivers, an IndiaSpend analysis and reportage from rural Maharashtra explores why farmers are both angry and desperate.The primary reason farming is unviable in India is that farms are now among the worlds smallest (the global average land-holding size is 5.5 hectares)  too many people are dependent on shrinking farms.Since 1951, the per capita availability of land has declined by 70%, from 0.5 hectares to 0.15 hectares in 2011, and is likely to decline further, according to ministry of agriculture data.Such small and marginal land-holdings, as they are called, now constitute 85% of the number of operational farms in the country, according this 2015-16 report on the state of Indian agriculture.It is hard to use modern machinery on small farms, the owners of which are often too poor to afford farm equipment. Manual labour increases costs, but labour too has been in short supply, as workers migrate to cities. Further, their size and output limits access to loans and institutional credit.Those are the larger issues. Here are the three reasons for the current turmoil, gleaned by IndiaSpends analysts and reporters:1. After back-to-back droughts, a good harvest, but incomes fallAs 2017 rolled in, the news from Indias farms appeared good.After droughts in 2014 and 2015, a good monsoon in 2016 reversed two years of rural economic decline. Indias agricultural growth contracted 0.2% in 2014-15 and grew no more than 1.2% in 2015-16, because of the back-to-back droughts. In 2016-17, the agricultural economy grew 4.1%.Across many states growing pulses, such as Maharashtra, Karnataka, Telangana and Gujarat, markets were flooded with produce, especially tur (pigeon pea), which witnessed the highest growth among all pulses, an important source of protein for a majority of Indians. India is the worlds largest pulses producer.However, an influx of pulses from Myanmar, Tanzania, Mozambique and Malawigrowing 20% over two financial quarters, from September 2016 to March 2017, the Business Standard reported on March 3, 2017caused the price of Indian tur to plunge.From Rs 11,000 per quintal (from December 2015), the price of tur fell 63% to Rs 3,800-4,000 per quintal  20% below the minimum support price (MSP)the price at which government buys farm produceof Rs 5,050 per quintal (including a bonus of Rs 425) since December 2016 as Indiaspend reported on April 12, 2017.The table above explains how production of pulses rose 29%, from 17.15 million tonnes in 2014-15 to 22.14 million tonnes in 2016-17. Tur production increased 50%, from 2.81 million tonnes to 4.23 million tonnes, over the same period.The MSP for tur should be increased to Rs 6,000 per quintal in 2017 and Rs 7,000 per quintal in 2018, a government committee headed by chief economic adviser Arvind Subramanian recommended in September 2016.As on March 2017, the minimum support price for tur was Rs 5,050 per quintal, nearly 20% (18%) lower than the prices recommended by the committee on pulses.As these prices crashed, farmers found it harder to find money to store their produce and prepare for the next season because demonetisationthe withdrawal of 86% of Indias currency, by value, on November 2016 left them starved of cash.2. How demonetisation  and government red tape  left farmers short of cashOn May 18, at around noon, 30-year-old Prashant Lande waited under a harsh summer sun to sell 800 quintals of tur at the Amravati agricultural produce market committee (APMC), 664 km east of Indias financial capital, Mumbai.From Kinhala village in Amravati districts Ashti taluka, in Maharashtras eastern region of Vidharbha, Lande said he refuses to sell his 800 quintals of tur to the government procurement centre, although the state buys tur at a higher rate.At the market, Lande could sell his tur at Rs 3,800 to Rs 4,000 per quintal, while the government buying centre offered Rs 5,050 per quintal.We dont sell to the government centre because the process of selling takes one month  from standing in line for the token to the sale to finally when the payment reaches the account, said Lande. Our fellow farmers who have sold their produce at the procurement centre on March 22, are yet to receive their payments and it is nearly June!It does not help that the effects of demonetisation continue to to be felt across the rural economy.Right after demonetisation, tomato farmers in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, and onion farmers in Maharashtra and Gujarat, were the worst hit as prices fell by 60-85%, IndiaSpend reported on January 18, 2017.With little respite more than six months later, the experiment has aggravated the circumstances leading to the current farmers strike.By now we should have begun preparing our fields for the monsoons, but because of demonetisation and the unavailability of cash, we are still struggling to find money for sowing, said Lande.At such a time, farmers like Lande turn to credit.Up to 57% of farm families in Maharashtra are indebted; the figure for India is 52%, according to the National Sample Survey Organisations 2013 situation assessment survey of farm households, the latest available data.This indebtedness has widespread consequences. More farmers committed suicide in Maharashtra (4,291) in 2015 than any other state, rising 7% from 4,004 in 2014, followed by Karnataka (1,569) and Telangana (1,400), as IndiaSpend previously reported in January 2017.Now, after Uttar Pradeshs new government waived Rs 30,792 crore of farm loans, pressure is building on the governments of Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka to do the same. Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis has been reluctant to do so, but with his governments coalition partner, the Shiv Sena, and other parties preparing for a political agitation, he may find it hard to exercise fiscal prudence.3. In an era of climate change, 52% of Indian farmers without irrigationThe basic problem across most of rural India is that despite the spread of irrigationa sector plagued by unfinished projects and corruption52% of Indias farms still depend on the vagaries of rain, which is becoming increasingly uncertain in an era of climate change.Extreme rainfall events in central India, the core of the monsoon system, are increasing and moderate rainfall is decreasing  as a part of complex changes in local and world weather  according to a clutch of Indian and global studies, as IndiaSpend reported on April 15, 2015.The droughts of 2014 and 2015 in rural Maharashtra were mitigated by the plentiful rains of 2016, but many parts of the state also endured floods. Uncertain weather affects the ability of government extension systems to provide accurate advice to farmers.The government encouraged us to grow more tur in the kharif (July to October) season, since these crops consume less water and are in high demand, said Lande, the Vidarbha farmer. We would not have faced so much loss over the last three years, had there been a proper system of canals.Despite six decades of irrigation, less than 50% (or 66 million hectares of Indias net-cultivated area of 140 million hectares) as irrigated, according to the 2015-16 State of Agriculture report. Groundwater provides water for two-thirds of Indias irrigated land, but those levels are falling from overuse.From the first five year plan (1951-56) to the eleventh (2006 to 2011), the central government has spent a total of Rs 3.51 lakh crore, as we said, on major irrigation and flood control projects characterised by time and cost overruns, shows this 12th Five Year Plan (2012-2017) report.On July 1, 2015, Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY)or the Prime Ministers Farmers Irrigation Programmewith a budget of Rs. 50,000 crores over five years (2015-16 to 2019). The motto of the PMKSY is Har Khet Ko Pani (water to every field) and More crop per drop.In 2015-16, less than a third (Rs 312 crore) of Rs 1,000 crores set aside for micro-irrigation was released, reveals this government report. Of this, upto April 2016, no more than Rs 48.3 crore, or less than 5%, was actually spent, according this micro-irrigation financial progress monitoring report. The government set Rs 1,763 as the 2016-17 micro-irrigation target, but no data on results have been released.The micro-irrigation programme covers an area of 6,51,220 hectares, or 0.46% of net cultivated area.(Salve is an analyst with IndiaSpend.

His family owns a piece of land  about 27 bighas  in Barkheda Path, a village 22 km north of Mandsaur in Madhya Pradesh where they grow soybean, methi (fenugreek) and chana (gram). On June 6, Abhishek went to Mandsaur along with hundreds of others from his village to protest against the falling crop prices that were pushing his family to the brink of desperation. Tragically, he became one of the victims of police firing, taking three bullets on a day when farmer protests across the western belt stretching from Madhya Pradesh to Maharashtra reached a frenzied pitch. He was too young but was keen to join the protest. We grow everything in our 27-bigha land but in the last three years, prices have plunged and ruined us, says Abhisheks father, Dinesh Patidar, 55, tears rolling down his eyes.Price pinch in MalwaBarkheda Path is typical of the villages in this region. With an approximate population of 3,500, 95% of the population is engaged in farming in landholdings that are less than a hectare per family. Abhisheks family members narrate their tale of loss. The last three years have crushed our backbone because prices have plunged, forcing us to sell our produce at rates where we dont even recover our investment, says Dinesh, adding, todays market price for soybean is Rs. 2,500-2,700 per quintal while our cost to produce one quintal is above Rs. 3,000. Not only soybean, prices of onion, gram, methi , vegetables, milk have bottomed while input costs have soared for seeds, fertilizers, labour and transport, he says.Madhya Pradesh consistently boasts of double-digit growth in agriculture  averaging 13.9% during 2010-15  and like many other States, had a bumper harvest following a good monsoon in 2016. Yet as per the National Crime Records Bureau statistics, as many as 1,982 farmers committed suicide in the State in 2016-17. A combination of factors  falling procurement prices because of a glut of produce in the market, a cash crunch due to last years demonetisation policy and the predominance of smaller landholdings which are expensive to maintain  have led to a simmering anger. Like their counterparts in many parts of Maharashtra, farmers in Mandsaur launched an agitation demanding remunerative prices for their onion, soybean and pulses. As thousands of farmers poured onto the streets, stopping traffic, attacking trucks and confronting police, things turned violent and five farmers were killed as a result of police firing and a curfew was imposed across five districts.Farmers from the Mandsaur-Neemuch stretch in the Malwa region, aside from growing soybean and chana, also grow a range of spices and medicinal plants like methi , dhaniya (coriander), jeera (cumin) and ajwain (carom seeds). Yet, farmers in the region claim that prices for these cash crops have been falling for the past few years. We never sold methi below Rs. 4,000 per quintal during the Manmohan Singhs government. But ever since Modi became PM, methi prices have collapsed, says Dinesh, showing methi gunny bags stored in his house.In addition to low prices, what has aggravated the situation is the Central governments demonetisation move late last year that has adversely hit the rural and agrarian economy.  Notebandi has almost finished us in the rural areas. Even after selling our produce, we dont get money in our hands before at least two-three weeks and sometimes even a month, says Lalchand Mali, a farmer from Barkheda Panth.Interestingly, not many farmers in the region are seeking loan waiver as is being claimed in the media. Most of them want better and remunerative prices that cover their costs and provide them income for survival. Believe me, no true farmer would want loan waiver. If the government provides better prices, we will repay our debt. The problem is the government never provides better prices, adds Lalchand, who owns a two-hectare plot in the village.The Maharashtra stirIn the town of Niphad in Maharashtras Nashik district, the main vegetable market, located in a large yard opposite the tehsil office, lies deserted. In a series of godowns that lie adjacent to the yard there is a pink gleam as sunlight filters through to large sacks of onions that are waiting to be transported. In Vittal Sanaps godown, which is nearly packed to capacity with produce, a large truck with a tarpaulin cover has been parked inside for three days even as workers go about their usual task of loading onions into bright red sacks.We had an order for onions to go to Madras (Chennai) a few days back but the truck was accosted on the road before it could get to Nashik and all the onions were dumped on the road, says Sanap. Onions that are left at the mercy of the elements lose their value almost immediately, so for now Sanap is just waiting for things to tide over. The hartal (strike) will have to end soon because there are many farmers who have no choice but to sell their goods even if prices are bad.Onions and other vegetables from godowns like Sanaps go to the Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) market in Nashik from where they are taken to other cities in Maharashtra like Mumbai and Pune as well as to other States in the south like Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, and even Sri Lanka. The APMC market in Nashik is appropriately mammoth  on either side of a dusty road are two large open halls, each the size of a large bus terminus with tall pillars running right through. On June 8, a day after the one-week strike called by farmers in the region officially ended, a small group of women have set up shop to sell vegetables like cabbage, chillies, tomatoes and cucumber. They take up barely a quarter of one hall but as produce is brought in by farmers in smaller trucks, there are murmurs of anger outside with some arguments breaking out as the produce is passed inside. These women are not from Maharashtra, you can tell from their earrings that they are from Rajasthan. These are just small local farmers who want to break the strike, says one of the men. Still, even these small traces of activity raise the suspicion that divisions are beginning to form in what was till now a unified movement in the district.United in adversityAs the major commercial supplier in this region, Nashik may have become the epicentre of the farmers movement but it all started in a village called Puntamba in Ahmednagar district three months ago on April 3, when the villages gram panchayat passed a resolution warning of a Shetkari Sampa (Strike of the Ryots) from June 1. Their charter of demands addressed to Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis included ensuring crop procurement prices at least 50% above production costs, a complete waiver of farm loans, 100% subsidy on drip/sprinkler irrigation systems, and a minimum milk purchase price of Rs. 50.Farmers across the region may find a specific resonance in one or the other of these demands but what seems to have really helped the movement spread from Puntamba across the Nashik-Ahmednagar-Pune stretch of Maharashtra is the language in which the idea of the strike was communicated. Farmers face many hardships but this was the first time Ive seen farmers actually willing to go on strike to and risk everything to see that they are given some recognition, says Abhijit Dige, who owns an eight-acre farm about 60 km from Nashik. Politicians dont know what farmers go through, its not like other businesses. Devendra Fadnavis should come and work in the field for 14 hours a day, work at night in the cold to tend to onion crops, and then maybe hell understand, he says.That same sentiment is echoed by Deepak Rane who has a one-acre farm just off Niphad where he grows cauliflower. The strike should not stop because people dont realise what we go through. I am not able to recover the cost that I bear to treat my crops with chemicals and fertilizers. I work from 6 in the morning; what is it all for? he says.People from all walks of life face hardships but have you ever considered why it is only farmer suicides you have heard of? asks Dinesh Nikam, another trader in Nashik who has refused to take orders for onions and other vegetables because he says he stands in solidarity with the farmers.The illusion of prosperityWhen farm distress was first reported in Maharashtra, it focussed mainly on the prices of tur and arhar dal and the difficulties faced by farmers in the drought-prone Marathwada and Amaravati regions. After two years of consecutive drought, a good monsoon in 2016 brought in a bountiful harvest and the markets were simply swamped with produce. Record harvests were offset by a steep fall in procurement prices for both crops.The plight of those farmers is often referenced by prominent leaders of the movement in Nashik and Ahmednagar though it has to be noted that this region is substantially different. The stretch from Ahmednagar to Nashik, and down to Kolhapur and Sangli where the movement spread is a fairly contiguous belt that is home to relatively more prosperous farmers. The majority of farmers in the region over the past two decades have moved from cultivation of crops like bajra (pearl millet) and jowar (sorghum) to cash crops like grapes and onions. Many have invested in dairy farming (Puntamba, for instance, is home to many dairy farmers).Vegetables, then, are actually only a small part of the produce from this region and while the enduring visual images of the strike may be of vegetables like cauliflower and cabbage being dumped on the road, there are many places where people show us pictures shot on cell phones of roads lined with pomegranates, which is the most recent entry to the crop market here.In Italy, for instance, a village about 10 km from Niphad that was the one of the centres of the agitation, Swarupananda Bhorgade says that about 80% of the village of 5,000-odd farmers is involved in grape farming, sometimes done in rotation with onions. I have been growing grapes for the last 20 years and till about seven or eight years ago I used to sell it for about Rs. 50 a kilo, says Bhorgade. So it was only natural that I planted grapes on every inch of my 15 acres. Now it costs me about Rs. 15 to harvest a kilo of grapes and all I can get on the market is Rs. 9 to Rs. 18 a kilo, he says.Bhorgade attributes this to a number of factors, the most important of which is climate  storms would come unseasonably and the crops would be destroyed. Or there would be hailstorms. This past year, the weather was regular and the crop was good for once but there is no price. You have to take into account how much we have spent on growing these crops and how we will recover it. It costs a lot to invest in crops like grapes and pomegranates, he says, adding that farmers from the region initially tried to rope in their counterparts from Amaravati who grew tur dal but their situation was completely different. They have larger landholdings and their crop is rain-fed. They dont have to spend on irrigation and other chemicals and fertilizer like we do.On June 3, a faction of farmer leaders decided to call off the strike after Mr. Fadnavis announced a partial loan waiver for small and marginal farmers that would come into effect on October 31. In a large meeting on June 8 in Nashik that included about 3,000 farmers and 150 representatives of farmer associations from across the State, that compromise was rejected. The people who met the Chief Minister did so late at night without anybody knowing and the agreement was not along the lines of what we were originally demanding, said Raju Shetti, president of Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana that has taken a major role in advancing the agenda. If the government did not accede to the demand to waive all loans immediately and bump up procurement prices, the meeting decided that the strike would move to a new phase of hartals across district and collectors offices from June 12 and rail rokos  in some areas. As of June 8, the meeting concluded that farmers should be allowed to take their produce to the market in order to meet their minimum needs. Look for Puntamba on that day (June 12), says one of the farmers who attended the meeting. The first rail roko will be there, where it all started."

But what has come as a reprieve was that the prices of essential veggies such as onion and tomato, had stayed below Rs 30 per kg.Summers usually see rise in vegetable prices due to water shortage and decreased arrivals of produce. Traders say that almost all supplies to Chennai are coming from other States and hence the transport cost adds to the vegetable prices. They say the prices have been on the rise for last one week.In the wholesale market at Koyambedu, onion, which was sold at Rs 12 per kg, is now sold at Rs 17. Tomato and potato, which were sold at 15 per kg, are now sold at Rs 25 and beans sold at Rs 60.Sales are dull. When the cost is high, people tend to buy less; they buy something like half kg instead of 1 or 2 kg. But, only when we increase the prices we get decent profit, says Badriswamy, vegetable vendor, Koyambedu.Traders say most of the vegetables and fruits are transported from neighbouring States such as Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka. In such cases, the cost of production and transportation falls on the vendors and traders and as a result, price rise happens and burdens the buyers.This is the case every year. Vegetables and fruits are very essential. Demand will always exist, but sometimes it is not met with sufficient supply. Hence the price rise to which Ive clearly reconciled myself, says Rathna.In Aminjikarai market, prices are at peak. Brinjal is sold at Rs 80 per kg and tomato at Rs 30. A sack of onion, earlier sold at Rs 400, is now sold at Rs 800 and 1 kg onion is sold at 20 kg. Carrots and beans are sold at Rs 70 and Rs 80 per kg, respectively.I buy minimum of all vegetables as the prices are high. My budget for vegetables for a week is Rs 100, says Allabakash."

PTI Photo Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan consoles family members of a deceased farmer, killed in the recent police firing, at village Lodh in Mandsaur district. PTI PhotoThe farmers protests in Madhya Pradesh (MP) and Maharashtra indicate that all is not well on the economic front, especially agriculture. If such unrest could happen in MP, which claims to have registered the fastest agri-GDP growth at 9.7 per cent per year during 2005-06 to 2014-15, then no state is likely to be immune from it.MP has been a showcase for the performance of BJP-ruled states in agriculture. But it now appears that agriculture could be Prime Minister Narendra Modis Achilles heel. The governments poor performance in the sector at the all-India level  testified to by a growth rate of less than 2 per cent per annum during 2014/15 to 2016/17  has to be addressed quickly, and in a sustained manner. Otherwise, the neglect of agriculture may cost the PM heavily in 2019.What has really gone wrong with agriculture during the Modi era? And how can it be fixed? We focus here on prices and farm loans, although agriculture suffers from a number of problems.The current protest in MP seems to have been triggered by the crash in onion prices, but it also drew strength from the news of loan waivers in Uttar Pradesh (UP) and Maharashtra. The seeds of competitive loan waivers were sown by the PM himself  at a rally during the election to the UP assembly, he announced that farmer loans will be waived in the very first meeting of the new UP cabinet, if the BJP were to be voted to power in the state. The new UP Chief Minister, Yogi Adityanath, followed the PMs advice diligently.Farmers in other states have been watching, and the loan waiver could lead to a demand for similar waivers in other states  Haryana, Punjab, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. We wont be surprised if loan waivers cost state treasuries Rs 2,00,000 crore in the months to come, taking state-level deficits closer to 4 per cent of their GDP.What is it that the farmers are demanding? Simply remunerative prices for their farm produce. The BJP had promised in its 2014 election manifesto that if voted to office, the party will ensure 50 per cent margin to farmers over their costs. Where does the Modi government stand on that promise after three years in office, compared to the last three years of the Manmohan Singh government?Graphics by Sarfaraz Graphics by SarfarazWe dug out official data of net margins (the MSP minus cost C2) from the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices reports of the last six years (see Graph 1). The bitter truth is that net margins in most agricultural commodities  paddy, maize, cotton, gram, sugarcane  have actually declined during the Modi regime. Moreover, if one looks at just 2016-17 data, there were negative margins on several commodities: Jowar (-18 per cent), ragi (-20 per cent), sesamum (-14 per cent), sunflower (-13 per cent), groundnut (-4 per cent), moong (-7 per cent) and urad (-4 per cent). With a glut in tur production, market prices fell way below the MSP and the real losses were even higher. Potatoes, onions and tomatoes seem to have met the same fate.No wonder there is widespread unrest amongst farmers. They suffered back-to-back droughts in the first two years of the Modi government, and now, in the third year, despite good rains and bumper harvests, they are suffering due to the collapse in prices. Loan waivers are not a solution: They are band-aids and give temporary breathing space to policymakers.The best way to handle prices is to get the markets right. Remember, prices are determined by the forces of demand and supply, and cost enters through the supply curve. Factoring in only the costs plus pricing without considering the demand side can lead to even greater distortions, and therefore needs to be avoided.But how does one get markets right? Take the case of tur; India had a bumper harvest of tur in the last season. But the government banned its exports, private entities were not allowed to hold stocks and trading in futures had also been banned. No wonder, with bumper harvest on the one hand, and strangulated markets on the other, prices crashed, tumbling way below the MSP, creating misery for farmers and causing unrest.The solution is simple: Abolish all export bans, private stocking limits and restrictions on futures trading in all agri-commodities. This is all the more desirable in commodities whose imports are open at low or zero duties. If this is not done, the government will be forced to buy all commodities whose prices nosedive. This is neither an efficient, nor a feasible policy option.For perishables like onions, potatoes and tomatoes, we need more and better storage facilities, linkages with processing firms, contract farming, opening land lease markets, etc. We need to develop efficient, equitable value chains  like the AMUL model in dairy.But there is one problem on the agri-credit front that needs to be addressed urgently. Farmers need cash immediately after harvests to pay their debts from formal and informal sources. Warehouse receipt systems and giving the farmers advances against their stocks is the way to go.The biggest failure of the RBI and NABARD has been on the financial inclusion front: Even in 2013  the latest information we have  of the total outstanding debt of rural households, 44 per cent came from informal sources (Graph 2). Interest rates in the informal sector hover anywhere from 15-30 per cent.Thus, instead of interest subvention schemes, the government needs to focus on financial inclusion if it wants to address farmers problems on a sustainable basis.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"
5a0510f79855b76bf13bf739,"Agri sector seeking new vigour, fresh leadership",http://www.deccanherald.com/content/618481/agri-sector-seeking-vigour-fresh.html,2017-06-21,"Agri sector seeking new vigour, fresh leadershipDH News Service Jun 21 2017, 2:14 ISTIn January-February, as the election campaigns in Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand were picking up steam, Home Minister Rajnath Singh first broached the topic of farm loan waiver if the BJP came to power. Little had he thought that the issue would gather momentum just five months down the line and force the Narendra Modi government to consider loan waiver for small and marginal farmers.In a way, the demands for farm loan waiver could be BJPs own doing. Maharasthra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, who had been steadfast in his opposition to a loan waiver, admitted that he was forced to announce writing off debts of small and marginal farmers due to immense pressure from the farmers whose expectations had risen manifold following similar moves by Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana.The Congress had already raised the pitch for farm loan waiver with vice president Rahul Gandhi undertaking a month-long kisan yatra across Uttar Pradesh in September last year. Though the yatra did not benefit the Congress politically, it did raise expectations of the farmers. The BJP too responded by mentioning farm loan waiver for small and marginal farmers in its manifesto for Uttar Pradesh.Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in his election rallies, went to the extent of saying that the BJP government in Uttar Pradesh will take a decision on farm loan waiver in its first cabinet meeting. The pressure on the Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath for announcing the loan waiver was telling as he kept delaying the meeting of the cabinet that usually takes place within hours of the new government assuming office. The council of ministers met a couple of times informally as bureaucrats put together proposal for the loan write off for the cabinet to consider in its first meeting.The announcement by the Uttar Pradesh government led to demands for a farm loan waiver from other states such as Maharashtra, Karnataka, Uttarakhand, Tamil Nadu among others. Maharashtra bowed to the demands from farmers and declared a farm loan waiver for needy farmers. The state government put stringent conditions to exclude well-off farmers from the loan waiver scheme to limit its expenditure.As soon as Maharashtra announced its farm loan waiver, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley made it clear that the state government will have to fund the initiative from its own resources and not expect any bailout by the Centre. The Punjab government became the third state to announce a farm loan waiver for small and marginal farmers on June 19, a promise made by the Congress during the poll campaign in the state. In a bid for political one-upmanship, Chief Minister Amarinder Singh also announced loan waiver up to Rs 2 lakh  double than what has been offered by UP and Maharashtra.At the heart of the crisis is absence of remunerative prices for farm produce. In simpler terms, a person dependent only on agriculture as a means of livelihood finds it difficult to make both ends meet as he does not earn enough. As prices of pulses, fruits and vegetables shot up during the past two years due to drought, the government had put in place stringent curbs on exports and stockholding by traders. The same were not eased after a spell of good monsoon led to bumper production.The glut of pulses and onions saw farmers making a beeline to market yards to sell their produce leading to a sharp reduction in procurement prices. In Maharashtra, stagnant milk prices had irked farmers who threw milk on the roads instead of selling it to dairies. In Uttar Pradesh, potato growers threw their produce on roads as wholesale prices dipped on account of better production. Similar was the case with onion growers in Madhya Pradesh.The simmering discontent among farmers in Madhya Pradesh led to protests in Mandsaur where six farmers were killed in police firing on June 6. Things took a political turn as leaders made a beeline to Mandsaur to express solidarity with farmers.Delicate issueIn both Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh, the governments hastily reached out to a section of favourable farmer leaders, agreed to some of their demands and called off the strike. Such handling of a delicate issue further angered the farmers who looked towards leaders such as Shiv Kumar Sharma alias Kakkaji in Madhya Pradesh and Raju Shetti in Maharashtra to take their struggle to a logical conclusion.While Sharma heads the breakaway faction of the RSS-backed Bhartiya Kisan Sangh, Shetti leads the Swabhimani Shetkari Sangathan in Maharashtra. Sharma was thrown out of the BKS following his frequent run-ins with Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan. Shetti, a Lok Sabha member from Hatkanangale near Kolhapur, is part of the NDA but is increasingly disillusioned with Prime Minister Narendra Modis farm policies.Shetti believes that Modi has lost the script when it came to tackling the agrarian distress as the government, instead of addressing pressing issues such as remunerative prices, was busy pursuing soil health cards. His consistent demand  Modi should fulfil the poll promise of implementing the M S Swaminathan Committee Report that has recommended a 50% margin over the cost of cultivation incurred by the farmers.Farmers were already operating on thin margins, which have dipped even further over the last three years. The poll promise on MSP has remained just that  a promise, with neither the agriculture minister nor the prime minister making any reference to it. The much-touted agri-market reforms too have floundered and so has the flagship programme to provide irrigation facilities to every farm. As many as 23 of the 99 delayed irrigation projects were to be completed by March 2017. The government has missed the deadline.On the political front, the strain on the NDA is showing. Modi had run a tight ship since coming to power in 2014, but allies such as Shiv Sena and Shettis Swabhiman Paksha have been growing restless and have raised a banner of revolt. The agriculture sector is desperately seeking new vigour and fresh leadership to pull it out of the crisis."

The social media was taken by storm on Sunday with food aficionados posting pictures of varieties of Biryani and Pulao on their social media handles across India. Amongst cities like Goa, Mumbai, Chennai, Bangalore etc. Indoreans too observed the day by coming together for a potluck supper. Amit Pamnani, a city based Chef who had invited foodies over for a potluck at his residence shares, ""The idea behind the event was to showcase Indian food to the world. Internationally, people celebrate food days like World Cheesecake Day, World French Fries day, World Nutella Day, Cheeseburger Day etc. Similarly, Rushina Munshaw Ghildiyal thought of marking Indian food days to pay tribute to foods, dishes and ingredients that are Indian. Following the suit we are trying to elevate Indian food to the same level. We already had a few food days in the past recently like Pickle Masala Day, where people came together and made pickles together. On Biryani day, we made biryani as per our styles, some were signature recipes of grandmothers and some tasted authentically like Mughlai Biryani.""It was double the celebration as the day was observed on the onset of Eid and Biryani is synonymous to the festival. Food reviewer Belly Kanungo feels, ""The day gave us a chance to soak-in the Eid spirit. Initially, we had thought of having a potluck but eventually it turned out to be an elaborate Eid celebration as we had mutton Biryanis, chicken Biryanis, egg and cheese Pulao, different types of Raitas - veg, cucumber and plain authentic Raita along with some onion salad from eight different kitchens. Each Biryani tasted different from one another. There was dum Biryani which had layers of rice, Masala chicken and toppings of Kesar rice and caramelised onions that tasted absolutely like an authentic Biryani of a Mughlai restaurant. There was mutton and chicken masala pulao-biryani that tasted perfectly like how we Indoris like to eat - full of spices and Masala.""Food aficionado, Rakesh Dawani adds, ""Though, there have been debates on the difference between Biryani and Pulao but one thing is common between both these irresistible dishes that they bind foodies together. The celebration was given a pause with a dollop of Sheer-Khurma.""Indore has been seeing a lot of youngsters choosing to organise potluck dinners on occasions like Easters and even for Iftar. Shivam Anand, a 20 year old engineering student who replicated his grandma's recipe to make egg-pulao for the day is of the opinion, ""It is only because of potluck that we got to savour eight different kinds of Biryanis in a single day. Potlucks are fun and gives us ideas to experiment with different dishes in our kitchens. Indore is known for its food and such sessions are only taking the city forward as like-minded people get to meet under one roof and talk about food.""For Satyajeet David, a city based chef, Biryani means ""Celebrating - The Royal Way"". He shares, ""A day dedicated and celebrated as #PulaoBiryaniDay in India is indeed very inspiring not only for Chefs but all foodies. I appreciate the thought to embark an occasion like this once in a year. It was a memorable experience being a part of this celebration in Indore where we relished different flavours of Biryanis and Pulao. I am looking forward to celebrating this day every year henceforth. We (food Connoisseurs of Indore) are in talking to come up with more such days to celebrate the essence of Indian food."""

After remaining stable till a few weeks ago, tomato prices rapidly increased at Rs 50 per kg in the wholesale markets. Vendors purchase a 25-kg tomato case for Rs 600 and sell native tomatoes at Rs 40 per kg. Tomatoes of higher quality are sold at Rs 50 a kg.However, retailers who buy the same case at Rs 600, sell tomatoes at Rs 65 a kg at Anna Nagar and Kilpauk. The price is high for the past two days. It was at Rs 24 a kg and now it has reached Rs 56. I have cut down on the quantity, says V Nagalakshmi.Supply is less. As tomatoes come from Andhra and Karnataka, the climate there also matters to cultivate crops. Excess rain or heat, both can damage the growth of tomato plants, says Ambedkar V, a vendor.Wholesale markets at Porur and Kilpauk were closed on Friday and those that were open wore a deserted look. With tomato prices on the high, the wholesale price of onion seemed decent. It was sold at Rs 13 a kg in wholesale and Rs 20 a kg in retail.Some retail shops at Anna Nagar sold onion at Rs 80 a kg.Onions and potatoes are being sold at Rs 20 a kg. But Rs 80 is too expensive, says Arjun.V, a wholesaler."

There is no definite cause for the increase, with middlemen at Vashi APMC blaming ambiguous causesfrom November's demonetisation to the farmers' strike in June as well as ""inclement weather"".Contrary to traders' claims there is no visible shortage either. Good quality, robust red tomatoes are available at all markets in Mumbai. Curiously, retail rates are rising even as wholesale rates continue to fall.APMC trader Shyam Yadav said, ""Wholesale rates rose to Rs 55-60 per kg over Friday-Saturday. On Monday, they dropped to Rs 36-40. Let us see what happens tomorrow.""Conversely, retail rates were Rs 35-40 per kg over Friday-Saturday, perhaps due to leftover stocks, which spiralled to Rs 60-80 Monday as retailers charged their pound of flesh. ""I bought half a kilo for Rs 30 to tide over the next two days. But how long can we continue like this?"" said Andheri resident Shaila Grover.Tomato is a household staple without which no meal is complete. Moreover, Shravan observances are set to begin on July 10 for north Indian communities and July 24 for Maharashtrians and Gujaratis. During this time families avoid onion and garlic and rely on tomato.One of the largest middlemen in the tomato trade at APMC Vashi, Javed Memon, cited a slew of reasons which seemed tough to swallow. ""This price increase is an outcome of notebandi. Recently there was also the farmers' strike in Maharashtra. Moreover, I am told the seeds have failed in south India. So this season we are relying on tomatoes from Maharashtra where a heat wave has beset certain growing areas. Also, remember that farmers have not been getting a good rate for their produce since the past year and a half. It is time they made some money.""Asked when customers would get relief, Memon said, ""Don't think of customers. Why think of customers alone, think of the farmer as well."" TOI asked if farmers were getting good rates at present. ""Well, not to their satisfaction. After all, the quality of their tomatoes is poor,"" the middleman said, adding prices would remain high till end-August.Mumbai receives its quota of tomato from cultivated areas in Karnataka, as well as Satara, Sangli and Narayangaon in Pune."

They also raised slogans against the State and Union governments for not completely waiving farm loans.The agitators alleged that the State government has done injustice to a majority of farmers in the State by waiving co-operative loans only up to Rs. 50,000. Farmers who have taken loans above Rs. 50,000 from co-operative and nationalised banks are suffering as they have not received crop loss compensation amount for 2016. They are yet to receive compensation for onion and other crop loss in the last two years, he added.They also demanded that immediate steps should be taken to waive all loans taken by farmers in the State. They said that farmers should be given new loans for agriculture and other purposes. Steps should be taken to fix scientific prices for agriculture produce and seeds and fertilizers should be given free to all farmers, they added.The agitators submitted a memorandum to Chief Minister Siddaramaiah through Deputy Commissioner Srirangaiah and said that the agitation would be intensified if the government fails to take immediate steps to fulfil their demands."

A scene from the Ernakulam market on Tuesday.Thulasi KakkatThere seems to be no respite to the common man as vegetable prices in the district continue to remain largely high, with tomato, onion and carrot being especially costly.At the Ernakulam market, small onion was sold at a wholesale price of Rs. 90 per kg and a retail price of Rs. 100 whereas tomato and carrot were sold at Rs. 52 and Rs. 60 and Rs. 55 and Rs. 60 respectively. Prices were even higher in some other markets.On an average, vegetable prices continue to be 20 per higher than what it was a month ago, though prices of some vegetables have dropped slightly, said K.K. Ashraf, vice-president, Ernakulam Market Stall Owners Association.Price of shallotsThe only relief seems to be the declining trend in the price of shallots after touching a high of Rs. 130 recently, though the ruling retail price of Rs. 100 per kg is a far cry from Rs. 65 in April. Mr. Ashraf expressed the hope that a further softening of onion prices would come about with production catching up in Tamil Nadu, the main supplier to Kerala.However, tomato and carrot prices continued to hold firm with the previous low of Rs. 20 per kg appearing to be from a distant past. Green chilli has also turned a lot spicier with the price soaring to Rs. 60 per kg from Rs. 35.The shortage of tomatoes in North India drove traders from there to the markets in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, which in turn, took a toll on the supply to Kerala. The strike by farmers in Maharashtra didnt help either, Mr. Ashraf said.In the meantime, the Vegetable and Fruit Promotion Council Keralam (VFPCK) which aims at ensuring fair prices for farmers, was on a high over what it claimed consistently good returns for farmers. Farmers continue to auction their crops through 22 farmer markets in the district.Data collected from the wholesale markets in Aluva, Ernakulam and Perumbavoor on a daily basis by the market information centre of the VFPRCK were handed over to farmers to be used as the base price in auctioning their produce.This ensured that farmers got a price, which was even better than the market price, a senior VFPCK official said.Asked whether better price for farmers automatically resulted in higher prices for consumers, the official said that it was beyond the mandate of the VFPCK and had to be addressed by the government through market intervention measures."

Fall in production in neighbouring States owing to climatic factors has led to an increase in prices of many vegetables.Tomato and okra are among the vegetables that have shown a significant increase in recent days. In Chala, tomato costs between Rs. 60 to Rs. 70 a kg, but retail prices elsewhere in the city go up to Rs. 80 a kg.Shallots continue to make homemakers shed tears, with prices ranging from Rs. 80 a kg for wholesale to Rs. 140 in retail shops for the best quality.SeasonalSays a commission agent at Chala: Prices are on the rise owing to a drop in production. This is seasonal. Take onion for instance. As onion prices are low in producer States following bumper production, not many farmers will be inclined to grow onion. Those who do will get a good price next year as prices will increase when supply dwindles. This is also the case with shallots. With less stock availability, prices are bound to shoot up. However, there has been a dip in wholesale prices of shallots, he points out. Though shallots havent been reaching the market from Tamil Nadu, an improvement in climate in the crop-growing areas in Karnataka holds out some hope for a further reduction in prices.Yet there are vegetables such as thadiyan kaya which cost Rs. 35 a kg now. I dont remember it exceeding Rs. 20 a kg in recent times, he says.Another wholesale agent says that following a shortfall in tomato production in some States, traders from there reached Karnataka markets, affecting the supply to Kerala. The prices have shot up this much within a fortnight, says a retail vegetable seller.While cowpea (payar) is available for Rs. 40 a kg at Chala, the nadan variety costs Rs. 90-100.Green chilli has not lost its bite either, with prices hovering around Rs. 60 a kg for wholesale and Rs. 70 for retail.Carrot cost around Rs. 60, though cheaper ones can be had for Rs. 45 a kg, says an agent for a farmers producer company. There are three to four types of carrots and beans available, and prices vary for each. Carrot, from Rs. 54 the day before, has increased to Rs. 62. Beans is priced at Rs. 62.Daily fluctuations too have a role to play, and over the course of a week, prices may show a substantial increase or decrease. For instance, okra that cost Rs. 57 a kg a week ago has dipped to Rs. 36 for wholesale and Rs. 40 for retail. Drumstick price too has come down to Rs. 50 a kg. Indian cucumber though is expensive.One retailer at Chala says good quality carrots are available for less than Rs. 50 a kg. But okra in his shop costs Rs. 50 a kg, though it used to cost less than Rs. 20 a kg a month ago.QualityA couple of retailers say they stock the best quality and hence prices are on the higher side for their veggies. Yet, this argument does not go down well with customers who complain of being fleeced.Price intervention, however, does not work much, say the traders.Prices of vegetables that are expensive now will come down in a month or so, some say. Yet others think the trend will continue till Chingam."

Poor supply from neighbouring States like Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh as well as drought in Tamil Nadu has pushed the prices up and, recently, many retail shops simply dont have any.Small onions, also known as sambhar vengayam in trade lingo, is an inevitable ingredient of Tamil cuisine. S Chandran, the president of the Koyambedu Wholesale Merchants Association, said: The market used to get Rs 40-50 tonnes of small onions per day from Karnataka, but it is now reduced to half. For example, today we received only 20 tonnes which has triggered the rise in price.At the Koyambedu wholesale market, the lowest quality of small onions is sold at Rs 80-90. The price goes up to Rs 100 for a better lot. In Koyambedus retail market, the minimum price is Rs 100 per kg. The price in the T Nagar retail market is between Rs 100-120.The Koyambedu market procures small onions from the Trichy markets which actually gets its supply from Mysore in Karnataka, Thuraiyur and Perambalur in Tamil Nadu.Lack of rainfall has affected the small onion yield in our State forcing us to depend on neighbouring states for supply, said R Jayakumar, a wholesale trader at Koyambedu market. Small onions being our major product of trade, we usually tend to buy at least 5 tonnes per day. But we now limit ourselves to 2 tonnes due to inadequacy in supply and hence the price hike. At normal times, the price of small onions would be as low as Rs 20-30 per kg, he added.We usually get at least 3-4 kg of small onions but with this price, we just have to cut down its usage. If we spend Rs 400 on small onions alone, it will really hit our budget, said a couple who were purchasing at a semi-wholesale small onion shop at Koyambedu market.I just have to replace it with big onions wherever possible, said B Ambika, at the vegetable market in T Nagar, lamenting that sambhar wont be the same without small onions.In contrast to small onions, big onions were available at just Rs 15 per kg at the retail markets of the city."

The official contacted the AP State Red Sanders Anti-Smuggling Task Force (APSRSASTF) officials in Tirupati and passed on the information regarding the seizure of the contraband material.During interrogation, the T.N. police got information that it was a regular feature that some members of the red sanders smuggling network were operating between Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu through Karnataka. Ramanathapuram, the district close to the Sri Lankan coast, remained the ideal destination for the smugglers. The agents would pick up the stocks and facilitate smuggling of the precious wood to some specified locations along the Sri Lankas coast. Small ferries and fishing boats are said to be deployed to finish the deals.In the present case, Balakrishnudu had initially reached Tuticorin to unload the stock before reloading it for Sri Lanka destination. However, due to Coast Guard surveillance he had to reach Ramanathapuram, where he was apprehended. The logs were skilfully arranged beneath the onion bags to avoid detection at inter-State checkposts.Speaking to The Hindu , Circle-Inspector (Organised Crime-TNCID) Rajesh said the consignment was set to reach Sri Lanka. Though it is for the first time that we have made seizures of the red sanders in this case, we have information that regularly the goods [logs] would be coming to various locations in Ramanathapuram district, he said. The Task Force chief Inspector General of Police M. Kantha Rao on receiving information from the TN police directed a team of senior police personnel to follow-up the matter and track the possible exit routes from A.P. towards T.N. coastal districts.The networks links with Sri Lanka will be further probed. On a number of occasions, the Task Force tracked the vehicles with red sanders logs sneaking into Tamil Nadu, and successfully brought back the seized logs to our godowns, he said."

Shalini Rajneesh's post has come at a time the government has been criticised for not doing enough to prevent the disease and prompted one rationalist to describe her advice as ""quackery"". The principal secretary had forwarded the post yesterday citing the jaggery and small onions used in south Indian cuisine as an effective cure for dengue fever. The post, in Kannada, roughly translates to: ""There's nothing to lose with this easy-to-follow cure with no side effects. Take small onions with jaggery to cure dengue."" Rationalists slammed the post that came in the middle of the government's struggle to control the vector-borne disease, with hundreds of cases reported daily. ""This is nothing but quackery, that too propagated by the civil servant responsible for the state's healthcare system,"" scientist and rationalist Narendra Nayak told The Telegraph today after emailing a complaint to health minister Ramesh Kumar urging him to stop officials from spreading such misinformation. ""I just don't understand why educated people in responsible positions spread such unscientific claims. Onions and jaggery don't cure anything. A senior official like her should have been careful about forwarding such material that might encourage gullible people to consult quacks and endanger their lives,"" Nayak added. Nayak listed some previous instances too. ""She (Rajneesh) seems to be in the habit of posting such wrong information as she had earlier put up claims of urine therapy. I have listed all these posts in the complaint,"" he said, likening the opinion to Sangh Parivar's claims about cow-urine therapy. According to the Bangalore municipal corporation, 1,300 dengue cases have been reported so far this year. Rajneesh could not be reached for comment on her post, with aides saying she was ""busy in meetings"". Srinivas Kakkilaya, a doctor involved in the rationalist movement, said the bureaucrat should have initiated action to control breeding of mosquitoes. ""Firstly, dengue is a self-limiting illness, which goes away in three to four days without any treatment in 99.99 per cent cases. In rare cases of complications, the patient might need hospitalisation. So her (Rajneesh's) claim itself is wrong as jaggery and onion cannot cure dengue."" ""By vouching for something totally unscientific and unproven, she has gone against the recommendations of the (Union) health ministry that do not mention anything about jaggery or onion,"" Kakkilaya added. He was alluding to guidelines issued by the National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme."

It was at Rs 26 three months back and Rs 48 a year ago.Sources said arrival of onions at Lasalgaon dropped by almost 50% from 25,000 to 12,000 quintal per day and this has led to rise in average wholesale prices of the kitchen stable.In the case of tomatoes, the prices have sky-rocketed in just two months across cities - in Chennai it has increased five-fold between April and July, by six times in Bangalore and by nine times in Kolkata during the same period. The problem aggravated this year due to rains."

India consumes almost 90 per cent of the home-grown produce, but 10 per cent export is necessary to prevent a price crash.Onion exports from India have recorded a 10-year high in 2016-17, with the country recording export of 34.92 lakh tonnes (lt) of the bulb. The Central governments decision to provide repeated extension to the export subsidy and zero minimum export price (MEP) of the produce has fuelled the exports in the last year or so. Exports of onions play a crucial role in balancing the domestic price of the produce in the wholesale markets. India consumes almost 90 per cent of the home-grown produce, but 10 per cent export is necessary to prevent a price crash. Exports had virtually stopped in 2014 due to the Central governments decision to increase the minimum export price (MEP) in view of the steep increase in onion prices. Due to a glut in the prices of the bulb in 2015, the Central government had again reduced the MEP to zero (0) in December 2015. Also, the Central government had announced a 5 per cent export subsidy for onions to clear the glut in produce.Since 2015, the exports of onions have seen a steady rise and at the end of the financial year 2016-17, 34.92 lt of the bulb was exported out of the country. This was almost three times the exports of the previous year when 11.14 lt of onions was sent to foreign shores. On an average, around 10 lt of onions are exported from the country every year. The United Arab Emirates (UAE), Sri Lanka, Singapore, Malayasia and Russia are major export destinations for Indian onion.Jagdish Apshunde, an exporter from Nashik, said the governments subsidy and the zero MEP has helped increase the export of the bulb. In June, the central government extended the subsidy for three more months to help clear the glut in the domestic markets. Exports, however, had failed to do much to improve the domestic price of onions which has been trading between Rs 5-6 per kg at most of the wholesale markets in the state.Over the last two weeks, prices of onions have seen a spike, with the Lasalgoan market recording an average price of Rs 12 per kg. This price rise, Apshunde said, was temporary and will remain till the Kharif crop arrives early September. Market sources pointed out that the price rise was due to stockists wading in the market in anticipation of a shortage in the future. Agriculture analyst Deepak Chavan said the rise in price is due to fundamental market forces. The outlook for the arrival of Kharif crop  the crop which is to arrive in September  is bleak. Onions from Karnataka start arriving by the end of August and there is a 40 per cent dip in the sowing area there, he said. The dip in sowing, Chavan said, was due to farmers going for other crops due to low prices of onions. While Maharashtra has reported near normal sowing of 10,000 hectares, prices, according to Chavan, would be bullish in the face of a dip in arrival of onionthis year.For all the latest Pune News, download Indian Express App"

They attributed the reasons for the same to shortage in stocks from their suppliers in the neigbouring states. The price has gone from Rs 20 per kg earlier this week to Rs 25 now.""Vegetable suppliers from the neighouring states are slowly running out of their existing onion stock. The rates will continue to remain high until the new crop is harvested there,"" they said.Weather parameters also played spoilsport resulting into loss of fresh stock.""Onions that were en route from Kolhapur and Nashik to Goa got soaked and spoiled on their way to the local markets. Therefore, the increase in rates,"" said vendor, Sadiq Shaikh.Tomato rates that continued to remain high for a large portion of July have considerably lowered this month. From going at Rs 80 per kg until earlier this week, the ripe reds have now come down to Rs 60 per kg. The rates are far lower in wholesale and at the horticulture run outlets across Goa. Tomatoes are sold at Rs 55 per kg at wholesale outlets, while horticulture outlets are selling it at Rs 45 per kg.""The tomato production in Maharashtra and Karnataka, where the tomatoes are sourced from, is slowly normalizing. As the supply is flowing in there, the stocks coming to Goa are also increasing leading to the drop in rates,"" said vendor Mohammad Rafiq.""New crop harvest is also awaited which will further increase the supply of tomatoes to the state,"" said vendor, Mehboob Niralgi.Horticulture officials remained optimistic that both tomato and onion rates will drop post-Ganesh Chaturthi season in Goa.The average wholesale onion price has shot up once again with 81% rise in just 24 hours at the country's largest wholesale onion market at Lasalgaon, Maharashtra, due to rise in demand as compared to supply.The average wholesale onion prices increased by Rs 1,030 per quintal in just a day from Rs 1,270 per quintal on Wednesday to Rs 2,300 per quintal on Thursday (August 3). Agricultural produced market committee (APMC) sources claimed that the price will soar further and could touch Rs 3,000 per quintal within the next fortnight."

(Photo| ANI)LUCKNOW: Pricey tomatoes today spurred a fresh round of protests by Congress workers who parked a cart full of tomatoes in front of the UP Legislative Assembly and sold the kitchen staple at Rs 10 per kg.The party had earlier come up with a ""State Bank of Tomato"" that is being operated from the Youth Congress office here.Tomato prices have hovered around Rs 100 per kg in major cities with supplies being disrupted due to heavy rains.Congress workers led by state secretary Shailendra Tiwari stood in front of the Assembly with a cart full of tomatoes with a banner ""Tamatar ke aaye acche din"" (good days have come for tomatoes) and sold it at Rs 10 per kg per person.""This is our way to protest the soaring tomato price.We are selling it to the common man to show our concern for them. It's ironical that the government has not taken any initiative to open subsidised counters for selling tomatoes or to check its price,"" Tiwari said.The 'tomato bank' has some interesting schemes to offer like providing the commodity on easy loan as also a locker facility, 80 per cent loans on tomatoes and attractive interest rates for depositing tomatoes, especially for the poor.The idea behind the bank is to lodge a protest and to create awareness among the people about the commodity being sold at such high rates.Prices of tomato have shot up about four times since the beginning of June when tomatoes were being sold at about Rs 25 per kg in the Delhi-National Capital Region market.Industry body Assocham had said recently that ""Tomato prices may not immediately ease as flooding in some of the growing states has led to damage to the crop.""Unlike onion and potato, the shelf life of tomato is very short and it needs cold chains and modern warehouses for storage and transportation, it said.Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Madhya Pradesh, West Bengal and Odisha are the major tomato growing states.The country produces around 18 million tonnes of tomatoes."

The rates were Rs 35 per kg two days ago. The supply has increased from 6,900 to 19,900 sacks.The authorities of agriculture produce market committee (APMC) believe that traders may be hoarding onion owing to which supply to APMC is not entering local retail market.The onion is supplied from areas such as Ahmednagar, Nashik, some parts of Pune and Satara. In other markets located at major places, the farmers fetched Rs 2,300 to Rs 2,600 per quintal for onion. Artificial shortage may further increase the price.An official of Kolhapur APMC, requesting anonymity, said, ""The difference between the price and the actual supply shows that the traders are stocking up the produce which may lead to increase in prices. The supply has increased and to reduce the price all the supplied onions should be brought into the retail market. The prices have tripled in last ten days and the initial reason for the increase was the shortage, caused due to increased demand from other places.""In the coming week fluctuations in onion prices will be observed owing to hoarding. The authorities claim that once prices reach the highest level there is a tendency of consumers to buy less. In such a situation the trader cannot hoard for a long time. The supply of onion is expected to increase in the next couple of weeks, after supply from regions of Solapur, Belgaum and some parts of northern Karnataka starts.Consumer activists have made an appeal to the district authorities to scrutinise the stock of traders. According to district officials surprise inspection will be carried out in the next few days, if onion prices do not come down as estimated."

RamakrishnaG._RamakrishnaVegetable prices in the city have soared owing to poor rainfall last month and late arrival of loads from other states and districts. While rates of common vegetables and tubers including tomatoes and potatoes increased by 50% in supermarkets in the city, rythu bazaars too witnessed a 30% hike in prices.On Monday, tomatoes price in a Punjagutta-based hypermart was at Rs. 70 per kilo, while the corresponding price at rythu bazaar was Rs. 60 per kilo. The price of tomatoes in the last week of July was Rs. 50 per kilo. Similarly, baby potato was priced at Rs. 45 per kilo whereas it was Rs. 30 per kilo for the regular variety.Vegetables including ladies fingers and beans were very costly on Monday, with the former priced at Rs. 69 per kilo and the latter Rs. 112 per kg. Onion price, however, was at a constant of Rs. 30 per kilo in supermarkets and rythu bazaars.The weekly budget of most households have gone up, thanks to the price rise even as families tried to minimise spending. In July, there was a sudden price rise which dipped marginally in the last week. But again in August, prices have gone up with essential vegetables costing more than their prices in July, said Venkat Reddy, a resident of Rethibowli, who came to shop at rythu bazaar in Mehdipatnam.Homemakers who manage the household budget said that they have had to make do with lesser vegetables to balance out. We end up buying more tubers than fresh greens. It causes inconvenience to ageing parents who need vegetables more than protein rich tubers, said Vanaja Laxmi of New Mallepalli Colony.Farmers, who brought their produce to the rythu bazar, however, said that their returns declined with consumers buying less than usual.There is a shortage of tomatoes and beans due to poor rains. And then with rains, transportation and storage became a problem, said N. Nagamani, a vegetable seller in Mehdipatnam.Due to fall in prices at the procurement end, several farmers had to dump their produce including rich harvest of tomatoes last month, she said.As the month progresses, the prices are expected to dip as more produce will come from other states including Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh, agriculturists predicted.Usually the month of August is when the prices dip with fresh harvest coming in.

He wished he had stocked up on Saturday, when the price was Rs 10 less. The retailer adviced a dejected Das that it's not too late either as onion prices are likely to go up further.Heavy rain in Nashik and the delayed supply from Karnataka, the country's two major onion baskets, have resulted in a spike in prices. Contributing further to this supply crunch has been panic buying, with consumers stocking up on the crop. Onion prices in the city have either doubled or risen by 60-80% from Rs 18-20 a kg just two weeks ago. In some markets in the city and its fringes, prices have more than doubled, with onions selling for Rs 45-50 a kg.""We mainly depend on the supply from Karnataka at this time of the year. They start sending onions from the first week of July and it continues till September. We need around 2 lakh tonnes for the state but we didn't get any from this southern state still now. This is creating a supply shortage. If we don't get it within a week, the problem will be acute,"" a senior agricultural marketing department official said.In 2014, when some onion-producing states like Maharshtra, Andhra Pradesh and Rajasthan threatened to stop supply of onion, Bengal had started cultivating the crop. At present, the production is enough for four to five months. ""In June, we had nearly 2.5 lakh tonnes of onions but that has been pumped into the market to keep the price under control. In this situation, we need fresh supply from other states. Else, we can't keep the price within limits,"" the official said.When asked about Nashik, the official said, ""Even three years back, nearly 90% of the crop used to come from Nashik but because of their attitude, the government has decided not to depend on imports for onion throughout the year. We now mainly look for onions from them in October, November and December. We could have fallen back on them on an emergency basis but because of incessant rain and flood in some parts of Maharshtra, the supply has been affected,"" the official added.""Onion prices have risen to Rs 40 in our market. We are buying onions at Rs 170 for every 5 kg, or Rs 34 a kg. Add another Rs 2 a kg as cost at our end. Hence, we are making a profit of only Rs 4 a kg,"" said Dilip Mondal, the secretary of the Gariahat Market traders' body.Traders in Lake Market, Behala, Kudghat and Kankurgachi attributed the upward price spiral to woefully inadequate supply. Heavy rain has made transportation of onions from Nashik almost impossible, they said. Very few trucks are entering the city with onion from Maharashtra.""There is a fear that some people might hoard onions and keep them in stock to sell at a higher price during the pujas. We are trying to increase the monitoring system so that individual hoarding of onion can be minimized,"" the official added."

Rain that wreaked havoc in Gujarat and Maharashtra has affected the supply to the city, traders said.Onions were priced at Rs. 40/kg in retail market on Wednesday and this may further go up, note traders.The Koyambedu wholesale market receives only half of the normal onion loads of 65 trucks daily. The city mainly receives its stock from Maharashtra and Gujarat apart from Karnataka.With the floods damaging crops in those States, less than half of the produce is reaching the city. Moreover, stocks from Karnataka are also being diverted to other places in north India like Delhi and Mumbai where the demand is high, traders said.Onions are priced up to Rs. 35 per kg in the wholesale market due to the increasing shortage, said P.Sukumar, joint secretary, Koyambedu Vegetables, Fruits and Flowers Merchants Association. Cabbage, a vegetable that is usually cheap, has become dearer as truck loads are being diverted to north India.Price of tomatoes downThough cost of tomatoes is steadily dipping, it still remains out of reach for many consumers and is priced up to Rs. 68 per kg in retail stores. S. Chandran, a wholesale merchant, said the market has started getting fresh supply of tomatoes from Hosur belt and this has brought down the price. But, we may have to wait till December for the onions to cost less as produce from Andhra Pradesh may arrive only then. Cost of onions may even go up to Rs. 60 a kg in retail market, he said.The supply scenario at Koyambedu wholesale complex is significant as several small markets in Chennai and other places such as Tindivanam, Cuddalore and Vandavasi depend on this wholesale hub for their supply. The sudden surge in prices of vegetables and off-season for weddings have also contributed to dull sales in the market. It may one or two months for sales to pick up, traders said."
5a0f0ba39855b76bf13d5760,‘Onion shortage for 15 more days’,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170812/jsp/odisha/story_166872.jsp,2017-08-12,"Caption There is a hue and cry over shortage of onions in the market. What is your department doing to address the issue? The states requirement of onion per annum is 5.5 lakh tonnes. We produce onion in only four districts  Nuapada, Balangir, Kalahandi and a part of Nabarangpur. We also produce some onion at Puruna Cuttack, which is located between Boudh and Phulbani. Despite all our efforts, the production of onion remains 1.5 lakh tonne per annum. We cannot preserve it for a long time. We have already exhausted our stock. To meet the shortfall of 4.5 lakh tonnes, we have to depend on Nashik in Maharashtra, Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh and also on Madhya Pradesh. But the damage to crops following floods in Maharashtra, onion produced in the interior parts of the state could not come. To check farmer suicides, the Maharashtra government started procuring onion at a higher price. So, only a few options are left for our traders to procure onion at a lower and competitive price. Sometimes our traders have had to buy onion at Rs 24 to Rs 26 a kg. I asked the traders and my department officials to sell onion with a profit margin of just Re 1, which will meet the transportation and preservation costs. How long will the shortage persist? It may take another 15 days. One cant store onion, as it is a perishable commodity. So there can be no hoarding. I have already sent a message to everybody that the government would take strong action if they do any mischief. Now, the businessmen have started cooperating with the department. Is it not an irony that despite the fact that we do not produce sufficient onion, our farmers had to resort to distress sale? Yes, there was distress sale. This was due to the fact that onion from neighbouring Madhya Pradesh where it was selling for Rs 2 per kg flooded our markets. The traders from Madhya Pradesh also asked our farmers to sell the onion at that price. However, we intervened and brought the onion price to Rs 7 per kg. But we cannot preserve it for long. Why dont you implement the Market Intervention System to rescue farmers? For market intervention, there has to be a consensus between the Centre and the state government as the price will be shared in the ratio of 50:50. We have already announced MIS for mung and biri dal. Two days ago, I told the officials that groundnut should be purchased at Rs 42.20 per kg. In the case of onion, they did not agree. Onion cultivation is not confined to Odisha but spread over many states. The governments failure to build a chain of cold storage may be one of the factors that has led to the distress sale... That is a wrong notion. We have nearly 42 cold stores in the private sector across the state. Besides, we have nearly seven cold stores around the capital city. A number of cold storages are there in Berhampur, my hometown. We have 24 cold stores in a bad condition. When the proposal came to me for their repair, I strongly suggested that these units be privatised. Let the private party undertake repairs and do business. The business cannot be run by the government. Every year, we face distress sale of various agricultural produce. How can this problem be solved? Everything is related to demand and supply. If suddenly there is excess supply, the prices will plummet and it becomes difficult to arrest it. Thats the time the government needs to intervene. We are doing so now. In the case of paddy, we have decided whatever the quantity of rice produced in our state, we will procure it from the farmers. Last year, we procured 56 lakh metric tonnes of rice. I have asked the primary agriculture societies to purchase paddy from the sharecroppers. What will you do with so much of surplus rice? Under the food security programme, we are giving 5 kg of rice per head. We will use up 30 lakh metric tonnes of rice under the programme. The rest of the rice will be procured by the Food Corporation of India. We also export rice to Punjab, Haryana, Jharkhand, Bihar and Karnataka. We are the third largest producer of rice in the country. You are part of a ministerial committee that discussed the issue of sharecroppers being given certain rights vis-a-vis the landowners. When will committees report be ready? Nearly 90 per cent landowners give their land to sharecroppers for farming. There is a fear among landowners that if they declare that they are leasing out land for cultivation purpose, their land will be taken away. Keeping this concern in mind, we are now emphasising on real cultivators. But as the issue is a controversial one, we have to secure the interest of the sharecroppers as well as farmers. It will take some more time to resolve the issue. You have staged a came back to the ministry. Earlier, a section of leaders from Ganjam claimed that they had lobbied for your inclusion in the government. Its the prerogative of the chief minister to pick up people for inclusion in the ministry. He also decides who he will use for party work and other purposes. When I was not in the ministry, he had used my services extensively in west Odisha and other parts of the state for the partys work. I never felt for a moment that I was out of favour with Naveen babu. Later, he brought me back to the ministry. Lobbying does not work. BJP national president Amit Shah launched his party programme Mo Booth Sabuthu Majboot (My booth is the strongest) from Ganjam. Your party must have been worried. BJP is a national party and it has formed the government at the Centre. The party has also formed governments in a number of states. Now, they are facing anti-incumbency in Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and other states. They have already lost Punjab and managed to form government in Goa. They are in alliance in Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and some other parts of the country. They are making efforts to enter newer areas. Now, they have set eyes on Odisha, Bengal and some other states. They are making all-out efforts to strengthen their organisational base. But, they will not be successful in Odisha as long as Naveen babu is here. But the anti-establishment factor also works against the BJD. No. We are taking up need-based programmes for development of the people. Naveens image is imprinted in the minds of people. Earlier, you equated Naveen babu as lord Krishna who drives the chariot (state) and Pyari Mohan Mohapatra as Arjun, who shoots the arrows. After Pyari Mohan, who is the Arjun now in the party? After the Mahabharat war was over all the Pandavas started claiming that they had defeated the Kauravas. But one Belalasena said he had seen only a wheel chopping off heads. Similarly, here Naveen babu is Krishna and there is no need for Arjuna as this war is different from the Mahabharat battle. What is the major challenge for the party in 2019? The Congress is almost a spent force. The space vacated by it is now being filled up by the BJP. Many Congress leaders are joining the BJP in the hope of getting a ticket. They are also spreading their network. Despite BJP emerging as a challenge, they will be no match for Naveen babus image and our programmes for the people. What do you consider more important: loyalty to the party leader (Naveen Patnaik) or efficiency at work? Both loyalty and hard work are required to be successful."

Their contention was that the yard barely had any facilities to support trade.Members of the Bangalore Potato and Onion Traders Association said they had learnt through newspaper announcements that the allotees of the new yard and some traders at the Yeswantpur ward had been asked to shift to the Dasanapura yard from Friday morning. They also said farmers who had travelled from Hassan with their produce were asked to take gate passes from Dasanapura before coming to the Yeswantpur ward.Protesting against this, hundreds of farmers and traders slept on the road outside the APMC yard to prevent vehicle movement and even dumped onions and potatoes on the road while shouting slogans against the government. The protest continued for over two hours leaving motorists stranded.Hundreds of vehicles queued up on both sides of the busy Yeswantpur Road that connects the State highway. People who went to the Dasanapura market say there is nothing there. It is 5 km away from the main road and there is not even a police station. Who will go there? Let them put these facilities in place before asking anyone to shift there, said one of the traders.The police rushed to the spot to manage traffic and asked APMC officials to redress the grievances of the protesters. The traders and farmers decided to cancel their plan to call for a bandh on Saturday after talks with the government."
5a0f51649855b76bf13d7e3f,are vegetable prices soaring?,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/are-vegetable-prices-soaring/article19527329.ece,2017-08-20,"What happened in July?July saw a rise in inflation at the wholesale level to 1.88% from 0.9% in June, with the spiralling tomato prices, along with other food items, contributing significantly to this rise. Tomatoes saw a sharp inflation of over 209.5% in July against contraction of 29.4% in June, according to data from the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy. Brinjal registered a rise in inflation to 21.1% in July, from Junes contraction of 3.1%. The prices of tomato, onion and potato have increased in recent months owing to disparity between demand and supply on account of a drop in production because of unfavourable weather, a rise in transport costs, seasonality and supply chain constraints.Why is supply low?While the rise in the retail prices of tomato is being associated with low supply from key growing States, including Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh and Karnataka following heavy rain in a few regions that damaged the crop and hindered transport as well, onion prices have seen a rise on account of low supply from the southern States.The fluctuation in vegetable prices, which is commonly referred to as seasonal, is associated with the economics of demand and supply. The Centre maintains that seasonal fluctuations in market arrivals have hit supplies. The other reasons for the fall in supply are adverse weather conditions and imperfections in marketing channels. However, the clash of interests between the consumer, the producer and the middlemen is a key factor that policy-makers must urgently address.Where is the problem?For years, the consumer, the producer (farmer) and the middleman have had a clash of interest when it comes to agricultural commodities. While the consumer wants to buy a commodity at the lowest price, the producer (farmer) desires to sell the produce at the maximum price. The middleman, on the other hand, wants to maximise profits. Striking a balance among these stakeholders could possibly address the issue of price fluctuation to some extent. Vegetable producers, especially small landholders, depend on intermediaries to sell their produce. As vegetables find their way to the market, the cost of packaging, grading, transporting and fees, besides the margins of the middlemen, are some of the elements that determine the final price the consumer has to bear.Will better storage help?Agricultural commodities with a short shelf-life are prone to price fluctuation and hence require better infrastructure for marketing.Economists like Prof. M.S. Sidhu at Punjab Agricultural University believe that improved transport and upgraded storage infrastructure will keep a check on price volatility. Indias cold storage capacity at present is nearly 3.5 crore tonnes, which is short by 30-40 lakh tonnes, and it needs to be increased. Besides, cold storages need to be upgraded, equipping them to store fruit and vegetables at right temperatures so that they stay fresh.Also, the high cost of transport needs to be addressed. In the case of perishable vegetables, the government could consider promoting low-cost refrigerated trucks and weigh the option of freight subsidy.According to an estimate, there are 7,000-8,000 refrigerated trucks plying in India, mostly transporting pharmaceuticals and dairy products. Transport of perishable vegetables in refrigerated trucks could be one of the options that would help in better supply and availability of the produce.What about the supply chain?The mismanagement in the supply chain is another reason for the huge gap in prices that growers sell perishable agricultural commodities for and what the consumer pays. Creation of co-operative groups and societies are probably an alternative that could assist in minimising the marketing channel. They can work in tandem across the States and supply vegetables from surplus regions to places where the produce is in demand.Most farmers in India have small landholdings. Nearly 85% farmers are small, who have less than 2 hectares. Cultivation has become unviable for these small farmers, but through cooperative groups and societies even a small quantity of crop produced by the farmer can be marketed. This will stabilise prices and benefit consumers.VIKAS VASUDEVA"

Onion prices have seen almost 100 per cent rise in past couple of weeks. Alarmed over the situation, Centre has directed the States to take proper measures including imposing stock limits to control the price surge.Prices of Onion which used to sell at Rs 20 Rs Kg or even at lesser rates have surged to Rs Rs 40 KG and more in Delhi and other cities across the country.Wholesale traders in Delhi claimed that the reason is due to a shortfall in supplies from Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. These regions have seen a deficit in rainfall which affected production in these States. On the contrary, many states like Rajasthan and Gujarat witness excess rain leading to damage of crops, said Surender Goyal, a trader in Azadpur wholesale market in the national capital.Traders claimed currently supply is mainly from Maharashtra.There might be possibility of hoarding or profiteering by the traders in Maharashtra leading to the surge in price. Supply in Delhi and other parts have come down and it will remain low in coming weeks due to heavy rain in Maharashtra these days, added Goyal.Officials of the Consumer Affairs ministry said that hoardings cant be ruled out at this stage to make a profit out of the current situation.Seeing this, states have been told to keep watch on such elements and take proper action accordingly. They can also impose stock limit to avoid hoardings, said an official.Meanwhile, the traders claimed that the situation will remain similar for some days as the new crop will start arriving from September onwards.Supply will start improving only after mid-September and till then price will remain in the range of Rs 30-40 a kg, said another trader.Onion price risePrices of Onion which used to sell at Rs 20 Rs Kg or even at lesser rates have surged to Rs Rs 40 KG and more in Delhi and other cities across the country.Supply has come down due to bad weather in many parts of the country.States have been told to keep watch on hoardings and take proper action accordingly.

Celebrated in honour of Lord Vishnu, it is another occasion for friends and family to share a traditional meal.Taking this tradition to even greater lengths, the landmark 350-year-old Mhamai Kamat house near the old secretariat, Panaji, throws open its doors to over a 1,000 visitors, of every faith.More popularly known as the 'Kongyachem Fest' (for the presence of a unique right-sided conch decorated with precious ornaments in the house), people throng to 'Casa de Camotims Mhamai' not only to witness newborn children being offered in a 'pudve' as thanksgiving to God at the matoli, but to indulge in a traditional 'Mahanaivedya' Saraswat meal on that day, which falls on September 5 this year.""Though the house is over three centuries-old, the Mhamai Kamats have been celebrating Anant Chaturdashi for just 150 years. The Mhamai Kamats consist of 10 families, which are spread out, but congregate here for this festival. During the Portuguese era, the Portuguese governor would always visit us on this day. Previously, invites would go out to people, but in the last 10 years we have stopped issuing printed invites. Instead we put a small advertisement in the paper,"" says ex-director of archives and archeology S K Mhamai.Meals, which are prepared from over 14 traditional vegetables, ranging from 'khatkhatem' to 'moongagatti' and the sweet 'payasam', are cooked by chefs brought all the way from Karnataka. ""These are mostly Saraswat cooks known to us. Meals are cooked in separate, large, copper utensils, maintained by us especially for religious functions, on wood fire. On this day, additional 'chulas' are set up in the spacious family kitchen to prepare meals for the large crowd. One important aspect of preparation is that no onion or garlic (which we consider non-vegetarian) is added to the food. It is a pure Saraswat preparation. Also, as a matter of tradition, we do not take any outside donations of food or otherwise,"" says Mhamai.To prepare for the big day, women of the family, including a large group of maids, clean and dice the vegetables. Cooking commences at noon. Every preparation is then offered to the deity as 'naivedya'.In a deviation from regular practice, on Anant Chaturdashi, no lunch is served to the public at the Mhamai Kamat house. Rather, a large spread is prepared for the evening. For the first batch of people who arrive at around 5pm, servings are on traditional banana leaves on the floor. After this initial serving, a buffet is laid out. Stainless steel plates are specially rented for the occasion.""The house is packed to capacity and queues stretch right outside as well. But no one is ever turned back without a meal. Our door is never locked,"" says Mhamai. ""The cooks are constantly replenishing the food. From the richest to the poorest, everybody partakes of a meal. Serving generally goes on till 12 midnight.""The buffet is a recent development in the last four years due to the paucity of space and helping hands. The most interesting aspect of this occasion is that not only people of different faiths enjoy a meal with us, but they come from as far as Mumbai, Bengaluru and Pune. Throughout the night there are 'bhajans' and prayers offered till 'utar' puja the next day.""Close to the heritage precincts in Mala , the ancestral Mahale house has been observing a similar tradition for over 80 years. ""We have thousands of visitors,"" says Raghuvir Mahale. ""We start at 6am, when people bring offerings of milk, fruit and the like, and puja commences at 8am. Lunch is generally served in a buffet at around 1.30pm or so and goes on till 3-4pm. With the exception of the 'bhats', who are served on traditional banana leaves on the floor in front of the deity, the others eat at the buffet under a pandal outside the house. This is also an occasion to cook traditional vegetables like 'aluchi bhaji' which is a rarity these days.""We, however, do not cook mushroom as it is sometimes considered non-vegetarian. We also do not use onion or garlic in our cooking,"" says Mahale, who believes that such occasions are an opportunity for members of the various faiths that visit to witness the unique tradition of Anant Chaturdashi at both these houses."

The produce is brought to the city from neighbouring districts of Mahbubnagar and nearby states of Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra and Karnataka.The supply is so much that for the first time in the season, the market yard has received more than 27,000 bags on a single day, which has triggered a crash in the wholesale prices.The price was around `60 to `70 per kg a month back, but is started falling for the last one week and on Monday it was hovering around ` 5 to `20 per kg.The opening bids for onion started from `20 per kg (for new and top grade stock), but soon the price plummeted and by noon, it was selling for `5 or `8 per kg, depending on the quality of the stock, said a marketing official from Malakpet Gunj.The cyclical drop and rise of bulb crop might be a good news for households but they have effected farmers and wholesale traders in the capital.The reason can be attributed to steep rise in the production and surplus supply from neighbouring state and recently, the market has started importing onions from Karnataka as well, said J Venkat Reddy, Secretary Grade III, Malakpet Gunj.He said that presently the market is getting Januarys harvest from Maharashtra.It is being said in the marketyard circles that there is no chance that traders are not going to make any profit as the prices may come down again.However, farmers at the citys oldest wholesale market are now struggling to move their produce and get minimum support price from the traders.

Apart from haleem which comes to mind first, another dish in this category is Patthar Ka Gosht, where a heated stone is used to cook pieces of boneless marinated meat. A favourite from the days of Nizam Asaf Jahi VI, this dish is still much sought-after by food lovers on any visit to the city.It is said that late in the 19th century, the Nizam Asaf Jahi VI used to frequently go hunting in the forests. On one such trip, his bawarchis forgot to carry their skewers and shikanjas were required to prepare kebabs and innovated by cooking mutton on a flat granite stone heated by firewood from below. The Nizam developed a liking for the dish, and so this recipe was replicated repeatedly at the royal kitchens. More than a century later, the dish is still popular in many areas in the city.Especially during Numaish, the annual exhibition of Hyderabad, many visitors flock to their favourite Patthar Ka Gosht stalls at the exhibition grounds. However, cooking on a stone is not just a specialty of Hyderabad, it is prevalent in some Arab countries too. In India, Mumbai and Bangalore also have limited availability of street food prepared on heated stone slabs.There are few important aspects of making a perfect Patthar Ka Gosht  selection of a right granite stone is one of them. The stone should not crack under the heat, and it should not be too thick to consume extra heat, instead, it should act as a good conductor. In this recipe, slices of flattened lamb meat are marinated in garlic, ginger, chilli paste, salt and raw papaya for at least four hours and often overnight, so that the meat becomes quite tender. It is then roasted on a stone heated with charcoal below. The end result is often truly a melt in the mouth dish. The proportions of marinade, ghee, the roughness of the stone as well as the timing of flipping the meat over play a role in getting the optimum taste. One of the best places for Patthar Ka Gosht in Hyderabad is Bade Miyan Kababs, a small kiosk midway on upper tank bund near the Ramadasu statue.The shop is owned by Syed Shaji whose great-grandfather Haji Syed Ismail started this business. The outlet uses proprietary spices, and the ghee is used as a medium of cooking on the charcoal heated stone. As per Shaji, the stone used is called pahadi stone and it has to be selected very carefully. The soft Patthar Ka Gosht is served here with a little bit of onion salad and some delectable mint chutney. Rumali roti often becomes a perfect companion too.Bade Miyan has another stall at Forum Mall and sets up a temporary kiosk known as Ismail Restaurant every year at Numaish.

A week ago, the tuber was being sold at `20 to `22 a kg.The essential commodity is going beyond the reach of consumers after witnessing a downward trend for nearly a month due to crackdown on hoarders. Its price has increased at least 60 per cent in the last few days. Traders, however, attributed the price rise to ongoing strike by truckers and rain in producing States like Karnataka and Maharashtra.General secretary of Byabasayee Mahasangha Sudhakar Panda said the wholesale price of onion has risen from `1800 to `2800 per quintal. As there is a huge gap between the demand and supply, the retial price is bound to increase, he said.Panda informed that Odisha is not getting the commodity from Nashik, Bengaluru and Tadepalligudem (Andhra Pradesh) as per demand. While untimely rain damaged the crop in Karnataka, Nashik region was hit by flood.Strike by truck operators demanding inclusion of GST on diesel also compounded the problem. The crisis will continue till the arrival of new crop in November first week, Panda added.Meanwhile, the State Government has warned the traders not to go for hoarding. Food and Consumer Welfare Minister Surya Narayan Patro said the officials have been asked to keep a close watch on hoarders and black-marketers."

(Representational Image) Traders said the shortage of supply was likely to continue till the first month of the next year. (Representational Image)AS THE price of onions witnessed a steep hike in retail markets across the city this week, traders attributed it to a shortage of supply of the vegetable to the Pune Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee (APMC). In one week, the prices have risen from Rs 20 per kilogram to Rs 38 and 40. As per the traders, the price of the commodity is expected to remain high for at least a month, as the supply to the market has dried up. This, the traders said, was because the ongoing showers were creating issues in harvest of the kharif crops.Vilas Bhujbal, a trader at Market Yard, said, The markets should have received kharif crops by now but because of the ongoing showers theres difficulty in harvesting the crops. The stocks from Rabi crops have already dried up. Hence, the supply to the market is going down with every passing day. He added that the price of onions in wholesale market at Pune APMC range from Rs 2,000 to 2,200 per quintal this week. If this continues, the retail rates may even touch Rs 50 by the end of this month, he said.Traders said the shortage of supply was likely to continue till the first month of the next year. Damage of the onion crop is not restricted to Maharashtra, a similar situation is prevailing in neighbouring Karnataka, they added. Changdeo Holkar, former director of the National Agriculture Marketing co-operative Federation, said, In some of the districts, as much as 60 per cent crop has been damaged due to untimely rainfall.

But the country still has some distance to cover in terms of exports as post-harvest wastage of produce in India is high.In 2015, the Modi government started project CHAMAN  acronym for Coordinated Horticulture Assessment and Management using geo-informatics  to prepare a comprehensive horticultural plan. Using remote sensing technology to study soil conditions, land use, weather and cropping patter, the Centre has chosen 185 districts across the country where seven selected crops are being promoted.Once complete, the findings of the project would be shared with all states to give to boost to cultivation of horticultural crops.States put into groupsDifferent states have been divided into different groups to grow banana, mango, citrus fruits, potato, tomato, onion and chilli.Sharing the progress of the project CHAMAN at a press briefing, Mr Singh said the Centre would convene a meeting of the northeastern states by January next year as the report on horticulture development for this region was ready.This sector provides nutrient rich crops to the people and better remunerative prices to the farmers and increases their incomes, Mr. Singh said.Under CHAMAN, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Gujarat and Maharashtra have been identified as the major banana-growing states.

According to market sources, the prices are expected to be within this range for some time as there has been an almost 60 per cent-dip in onion production in the neighbouring Karnataka.In view of the rise in onion prices in retail markets across the country, the central government had urged the state to investigate the cause of the rise. The district deputy registrar was directed to conduct an inquiry in the matter. Accordingly, the district collector of Nashik held a meeting with the traders and representatives of the various market committees and suggested that they forgo the traditional week-long Diwali break, which is supposed to start from Monday. The move aimed at stopping the escalation of onion prices.However, farmer organisations rejected the suggestion, saying that this was intentionally done to reduce the prices. Dipak Pagar, leader of the Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghtana and director of the Nampur wholesale market, meanwhile warned of an agitation by farmers against the anti-farmer policies of the central government.On Monday, the average modal price of trade was Rs 2,300 in Lasalagon market, with 1,500 quintals of onions arriving for trade. In the neighbouring Pimpalgaon market, the average price of trade was Rs 2,425, with 7,500 quintals arriving for auction. Sources attributed the low arrival to the festive season, when farmers normally refrain from coming to the market.The present price trend, Jaydutt Holkar, chairman of the Lasalgaons wholesale market, said the price trend will continue till the new crop arrives. Farmers have the bare minimum stock. However, the price rise is mainly because of the almost 60 per cent-dip reported in the kharif area from Karnataka, he said.

5a1516a49855b76bf13ead82,Food for reform,http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/indian-farmers-food-prices-inflation-indian-economy-food-for-reform-4898307/,2017-10-20,"Price instability at the macro level is caused by supply shocks. (Illustration: C R Sasikumar) Price instability at the macro level is caused by supply shocks. (Illustration: C R Sasikumar)EXTREME volatility in the prices of some food commodities has, in recent years, been hurting producers as well as consumers, while also disrupting certain economic activities. The reason for this appears to be the waning influence of non-price factors (technology, irrigation, extension) in driving growth, and the role of prices having become stronger. There is clear evidence at the global level to show that till mid-2000, the trend in output growth drove price trend (higher growth associated with lower price) but during the last 10 years, price trends have driven output growth. The so-called Cobweb phenomenon is becoming more apparent, leading to a price-production spiral. In this context, it is important to look at the price stabilisation policy and measures adopted by India from time to time, and draw lessons to maintain a stable price environment that benefits both producers as well as consumers.Price instability at the macro-level is caused by supply shocks. Trading and stocking up are the two options to stabilise supply and by extension, prices. India has historically relied heavily on buffer stock to maintain price stability in staple food, though this policy has come under attack from supporters of free trade, who feel stocking up is a costlier option for price stabilisation. Experience, however, shows that it is often trade that is more expensive. Take the case of wheat in which international prices rose sharply when India entered the market to import the crop and augment its domestic supply.It was due to its policy of maintaining buffer stock that India ensured remarkable price stability during the global food crisis, when almost all countries, including the developed ones, faced a steep price rise. Should India then use a similar option to achieve price stability in pulses, which have shown extreme volatility in the last three years?Some gains from the steps taken by the government to create a buffer stock of pulses are already visible. The buffer stock, mainly aimed at stabilising consumer prices, has made it possible to procure pulses. Last year, India recorded an unprecendented 40 per cent increase in total pulses production over the previous year. The increase was 87 per cent for arhar (tur) dal. This kind of spike in production would have led to a serious crash or even a collapse in prices had the government not intervened  the Central agencies procured 14.7 lakh tonnes of kharif pulses. Nevertheless, farm harvest prices of some pulses dropped well below the MSP in 2016-17, but the shortfall was similar to what has been witnessed quite often in the past, even during years of normal growth in production. For instance, the farm harvest price of arhar in 2013-14 was 14 per cent below MSP in Karnataka and 7 per cent in Maharashtra; the two states account for half of the total tur production.In some mandis, farmers received 30 per cent less than the MSP. Similarly, the five states which account for 85 per cent of gram (chickpea) production received 3 to 9 per cent lower farm harvest price than the MSP in 2013-14. This comparison shows that it is not correct to blame the government for inaction in checking prices of pulses falling below the MSP in a year of bumper production.Based on the experience of rice and wheat, the pragmatic approach appears to be to use the buffer stock option along with the trade option to stabilise the price of pulses. The level of buffer stock should be determined by technical considerations and trade opportunities.Regulation and competition in the market also affect price volatility. If there is an Essential Commodities Act with stock limits on traders, it will rule out the possibility of the private sector mopping up more than the normal marketed surplus, forcing prices to go down.When there is a glut, there is a disproportionate price spread between retail and farm. This is particularly true in the case of vegetables. Price spikes are also sometimes created by cartels of traders, especially at the local level. The reason for such price fluctuations is poor market integration across regions/states over time. This year, while onion prices in some markets in Madhya Pradesh dropped below Rs 200 per quintal in the second fortnight of May, the crop was selling at over Rs 700 per quintal in the major markets of neighbouring Uttar Pradesh. By August, the price of onion touched Rs 800 a quintal in the mandis of Madhya Pradesh and close to Rs 2,000 in the wholesale markets in Delhi. Why wasnt onion promptly taken to other states when prices crashed in MP? Why could it not be stored for just two months to take advantage of the large price increase? These questions have been haunting the country for several years and the answers are well known  remove various restrictions under the APMC Act, facilitate private sector participation and investment in agri markets, promote storage, and link the processing industry to the farm through contract farming etc.The Central government has made a lot of effort to persuade states to implement market reforms and adopt a model APMC Act. It has also urged the states to allow direct purchase by the private sector; set up mandis in the private sector; allow farmers to sell directly to consumers; ensure a single trading license; allow electronic trading; and take fruits and vegetables out of the purview of the APMC Act. These reforms have either been completely ignored or adopted partially with considerable dilution by the states. The sufferers are farmers. The failure to establish a competitive market is forcing farmers to ask for higher MSP and expand procurement to all crops to make MSP effective.In conclusion, price volatility and low and unremunerative prices for farm produce can be addressed to a large extent through competitive markets. In most cases, a competitive market will fetch the farmers higher prices than MSPs. This requires carrying out long-pending reforms in the agricultural market. Due to the delay and reluctance on the part of states to implement market reforms, it looks imperative to bring agricultural marketing into the Concurrent or Union list and implement a national-level model market act with all the required reforms. Bringing marketing under the Concurrent or Union list is also justified on the ground that a large proportion of farm produce is sold and consumed outside the states they are produced in. Still, strategic intervention by the government in the form of buffer stock will be needed in a few cases.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

This would improve availability in consuming areas like Delhi as well, thereby, helping moderate prices, the statement said.Till kharif arrivals pick up, trade association informed that there is enough onion stock available from the Rabi crop to meet the domestic demand.Department advised trade associations to be in readiness to import and supply onions in case prices do not moderate as expected because of unscrupulous activities. Such imports will be facilitated, the statement said.To curb rise in onion prices, the government has recently extended by two months till December the ban on holding of stock beyond a prescribed limit.Retail onion prices are ruling at around Rs 50 per kg in the national capital. In other metro cities, rates are ruling in the range of Rs 30-40 per kg, as per the official data.The agriculture ministry has projected 5.8% fall in onion output at 197.13 lakh tonnes in 2016-17 crop year (July-June), as against actual output of 209.31 lakh tonnes last year."

Photo: Pradeep Gaur/MintTwo common threads run through all current discussions on the Indian economy. First, growth has been rapid since economic liberalization was initiated. Second, the benefits of this growth are skewed with reference to peninsular and western India in contrast to eastern and northern India.Having seen how Andhra Pradesh in the mid-1970s and early 1980s was transformed from a backward economy to a relatively modern economy, I am persuaded to believe that there are two categories of markets: feudal markets and modern markets. Or more appropriately, markets in feudal structures and markets in modern societies. The responses of these two markets to external stimulibe it funds and investment or softer skills such as education and healthare different. Feudal markets function on relationships, hierarchy and patronage. Patron-client equations in hierarchical structures set the tone for the functioning of the economy, ruling out the possibility of structural transformation. The approach is anti-change rather than of breaking conventions in sync with economic democracy.These factors inhibit investment. There is inbuilt resistance to innovative methods that upset the apple cart, restricting the claims of equal rights of participation and of resultant gains. Modern markets, on the other hand, function on rules and transparency, and are open to innovative ideas. These factors attract investment with competition ensuring equal rights to all claimants. The implications of feudal markets and their regressive impact have not been addressed enough, perhaps on the assumption that markets are homogeneous, inanimate institutions.Market classification into feudal and modern is based on the conduct of business in these two markets. Cartels are good examples to highlight these differences. They occur in all markets. Firms collaborate to form cartels and fix prices. As a result, consumers are denied the benefit of competition. Game theoretic framework, however, shows that firms follow business strategies that result in identical price structures even in oligopolistic market structures without the need to collaborate or form cartels. In their effort to detect and break cartels, competition authorities instead look for agreements that indicate collaboration. Alternatively, they encourage whistle-blowing with appropriate incentives.In the case of feudal markets, game theoretic modelling is of no relevance. Collaboration is a non-issue. Entry is restricted with complete lack of transparency in all transactions as the Competition Commission discovered in its investigation into the onion trade cartel. Of prime significance in the onion market was the presence of strong kinship bonds among traders cemented over generations. The corollary condition of feudal markets was discernible in the patron-client relationship between peasant farmer and traders with predetermined prices and marketable stocks. The auction markets and bidding mechanisms of modern markets for competition remained a farce in the onion market. What is interesting and significant is that the commission could not break the cartel for want of evidence.Of course, it could be argued that the onion market is a one-off case typical of vegetable mandis. The intent is not to delve into a discussion on cartel busting but to highlight features of feudal markets that deter private foreign investment in modern industry. Hierarchical structures based on personal relationships as seen in the onion market or the denial of equal rights and claims of all participants are hardly conducive for attracting investment. Current data on foreign investment shows that six states and Union territoriesMaharashtra, Delhi, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Telanganagarnered a large portion in 2017.What could be a catalyst? The new narrative currently doing the rounds is of foreign investment flowing into activities pertaining to agriculture in economically backward states. Foreign investment is agnostic but would it usher change in a short time frame? I would root instead for investment in business that disrupts existing structures on a large scale.The Andhra Pradesh experience underlines foreign investment as a catalyst of change. Catching the tail wind of outsourcing, these investments in technology companies led to a chain of events, which, in my view, made the difference. The emergence of a host of services catering to upwardly mobile young people employed in these companies created jobs for low-skilled workers, many from rural areas, and exposed them to modern markets.Digitalization and the spread of smartphones throws up several outreach possibilities. This has demonstrated the innovative and inclusive approach of digital finance. New finance companies are selling customized financial products online to clientele outside structured financial institutions and at minimum risk. In the era of big data, digital sale of data offers unexplored opportunities to farmers. Real-time data on cropping patterns; resistance of new seeds to pests; responses to new varieties of seedits all information sought by international firms engaged in genetically modified seed technology and automation of farm equipment. This data business empowers small farmers. Negotiation with large business houses is now possible, unheard of within the feudal constricts of patron-client relations. The only hitch is resistance to rule-based modern markets ingrained in feudal societies.Geeta Gouri is a former member of the Competition Commission of India."

Photo: Abhijit Bhatlekar/MintMumbai/Delhi: Narayan Ghawat, a 66-year-old paddy farmer in Mila village of Maharashtras Thane district, was mighty impressed with Prime Minister Narendra Modis demonetisation drive when he read about it in newspapers on 9 November 2016. One year later, Ghawat does not quite understand what demonetisation has achieved.I think the objective was good but it has not been achieved. It has not unearthed black money to the extent Modiji said it would, Ghawat says as he awaits his turn at a branch of Thane District Central Co-operative Bank. Ghawat does not have a debit card and does banking the traditional way. Before he withdraws money and leaves the bank, he helps fill up a cheque for a tribal couple, both farm labourers, from his village.Dhondu Mukne, the tribal farm labourer, remembers notebandi, as demonetisation is popularly known, as the period when his daily wages of Rs300 would not be paid in cash at the end of the day. It was paid after some days, Dhondu says. Now, Dhondu says he gets paid his wages in cash at the end of each day he puts in. Dhondu offers little on notebandi other than this impact.Ghawat grows paddy on his 3 acre farm. Extended monsoon rains have damaged his standing paddy crop, causing a nearly 25% drop in productivity compared with the 20 quintals he grew in 2016. He says he will sell the produce at a government-appointed procurement centre.Money will be transferred to my bank account if I sell rice at the government-operated procurement centre. But this would happen even before notebandi. Now even traders have to deposit money directly into farmers accounts if they have purchased farm produce from them. That is not exactly a good thing for farmers because we need some ready cash for day-to-day expenses and agriculture inputs, Ghawat says.One year after Modis demonetisation, the farm sector has somewhat recovered from the immediate impact it causeda cash crunch for buyers of farm produce, disruption in movement and supply chain of commodities leading to a steep rise in the retail prices, and loss of cash wages for millions of farm labourers across the country. But farmers, activists, other farm sector stakeholders like functionaries of the regulated markets, and experts point out the long-term damage demonetisation has done to the farm sector.Demonetisation distorted an already skewed and fragile farm sector across India. It snuffed out cash from a market which is largely cash-driven and which operates mutually on cash flows. It caused an average 20-30% fall in the prices of most commodities, a fall from which no farm produce has yet recovered, and also impacted the consumer goods in rural and semi-rural markets because farmers are the largest component of buyers in these markets, said an agriculture sector expert in Maharashtra who runs a think-tank and who did not wish to be named.In Maharashtra, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, and Telangana, states that are still recovering from the impact of drought, demonetisation contributed to a market-driven crisis by cutting down the margins that the farmers would have realized if cash was not scarce.In Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh, it added fuel to the demand for farm loan waivers which, as in Maharashtra where it has been conceded, puts additional long-term stress on the state finances and takes away capital from productive investment and allocates it to non-productive.Protests in Maharashtra triggered a similar agitation in neighbouring Madhya Pradesh in June. In Mandsaur district, six protestors were killed in the police firing. In Maharashtra, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government blinked and announced a Rs34,022 crore farm loan waiver which is being implemented using online and biometric systems. Maharashtra followed another BJP-ruled state Uttar Pradesh, which had already announced a Rs36,000 crore loan waiver.While the jury is still out on the costs and benefits of demonetisation, farm sector stakeholders see little for farmers to cheer about the disruptive decision. Demonetisation was never an economic decision. It was a political decision which paid off for Modi in the Uttar Pradesh elections. In the short term after 8 November, it only compounded the systemic problems for farmers, says Vidarbha-based farmer and farm activist Vijay Jawandhia. It was in Uttar Pradesh that Modi, while campaigning for the BJP, promised a farm loan waiver, an announcement that predictably had repercussions in other BJP-ruled states.Another Maharashtra-based sector expert and former member of the Commission for Agriculture Costs and Prices (CACP), who requested anonymity, says it is the trading lobby in the farm sector which made the most of demonetisation at the cost of the most vulnerable segmentthe farmers themselves. The commodity traders exploited demonetisation as an opportunity. Since they had cash in old or banned currency, they offered it to farmers who wanted to sell their produce to get some cash. The farmer, who sold his produce to the traders for prices much lower than the market, then stood in the queues to exchange this currency. This way, traders offloaded some of their black money. Traders exploited the cash crunch created by demonetisation to bring down the prices of farm produce to such distress levels that it created a market-driven agrarian crisis in a year of record high yields, the expert said.He said demonetisation had created problems for the farmers on the input side by creating a cash crunch just ahead of the 2017 Rabi season, and the output side by allowing traders to dampen the prices, and also the farm labourers.Despite fears that demonetisation will impact the Rabi crop, overall foodgrain production at 276 million tonnes broke all records in 2016-17. Together with a bumper harvest of horticulture crops like fruits and vegetables, Indias agriculture growth rate shot up to a high of 4.9% during the year, up from a measly 0.7% the year before. The record harvest, coupled with demonetisation pulled down crop prices, especially that of perishable crops and pulses.A senior Maharashtra government official, who did not want to be named, admitted the disruptive nature of demonetisation on the farm sector but pointed out some benefits too. Traders registered across Agricultural Produce Market Committees (APMCs) in Maharashtra started making payments to farmers through real-time gross settlement and national electronic funds transfer systems, he noted. This happened in other states as well after the initial disruption. This change not only reduced the role of middlemen and commission agents but also enabled state governments across India to digitally identify farmers, the official said.Jaydatta Holkar, president of the Lasalgaon APMC in Maharashtras Nashik district, Indias largest regulated onion market, agreed with the observation but said the change was not necessarily good for farmers. Earlier since the transactions were cash-based, both farmers and traders had enough cash and the cash flow kept the economy running. Traders would raise soft loans to pay off farmers and repay the loans when the commodities moved further in the wholesale and retail market. But the cash crunch disrupted this flow and led to drop in the prices. Another fallout of digital transfers of money is that the farmers who would come to the APMC market from smaller places would spend some of the cash they received in the local consumer market. For instance, the onion growers who sold their produce in Lasalgaon would spend some of that money in the local Lasalgaon market that same day. This is not possible with digital money and the consumer markets have suffered due to farmers withdrawal, Holkar said.Sunil Golya, a farmer in Madhya Pradeshs Harda district and founder member of Aam Kisan Union in Madhya Pradesh, said APMCs in Madhya Pradesh too had started making RTGS/NEFT payment to farmers. But if this was such a good change, why is it that chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan recently announced that traders could pay up to Rs50,000 in cash to farmers for procurement and the balance through RTGS? This means the Madhya Pradesh government has in a way admitted that the cash crunch created by demonetisation was not beneficial to farmers, Golya said.In addition to the other negative consequences like a fall in the procurement prices and cash crunch, demonetisation had also directly impacted the value of a big asset that the farmers held, Golya said. Demonetisation has drastically reduced the price of agricultural land, an asset that the farmer banks on to leverage in times of crisis. In Harda district only, an acre of irrigated land was fetching around Rs12 lakh before demonetisation but the prices are down to Rs5.5-6 lakh since November 2016, he said.With an average 20% fall in the remunerative prices and land prices getting halved, farmers in Madhya Pradesh, despite contributing to the states record high 20% agriculture growth, did not have surplus income and demonetisation was a factor in it, he added."

Manimegalai, a home maker from Puliyakulam whose family budget is dependent only on her husbands income, increase in the price of some of the vegetables has led to changes in the daily expenditure.The weekly Uzhavar Santhai used to be a boon for mid and low income families. Now, farmers who sell vegetables directly have also increased prices citing changes in retail market. Hike in the price of coconut has forced us to replace thengai chutney with sambar or thakkali chutney . Luckily, price of tomato has not increased as much as it shot up in July, said Ms. Manimegalai. Quoting some of her neighbours, she said families are buying vegetables in bulk and storing them in refrigerator when prices are low.A vendor from a neighbourhood grocery store near Sivaram Nagar said that sale of vegetables has come down as as she was, with no option left, already selling them at a few paise/rupee higher than the price of vegetables at bigger retail stores.For vegetable buyers in the city, prices of small onions, coconuts, and tomatoes have shot up during the last few days, making many reluctant to buy these. Even in the weekly markets, the prices are high. I have stopped buying small onions, says Jothimani, a resident of Ramanathapuram.Prices of small onions is expected to hover around Rs. 120-140 for another two to three months and prices of tomatoes will come down in a fortnight, said M.R. Palanisamy, Deputy Director of Agriculture Marketing here.According to M. Rajendran, president of Thyagi Kumaran Market Vegetable Merchants Association, small onion prices might touch Rs. 200 a kg in the retail market. This is mainly because of drought last year and recent heavy unseasonal rains in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. Farmers are not benefiting from the price rise.The wholesale price of small onions is about Rs. 140. If we used to get 2,000 bags of small onions in the market a day, it has dwindled to 200 bags now. Coconut prices are up because trees dried in Pollachi area and many have cut down the trees because of drought earlier this year. It will take another three months for arrivals to pick up.Prices of most of the vegetables are above Rs. 50 a kg. It will take one or two months for the prices to stabilise. Farmers who cultivated small onions on about 950 hectares in Thondamuthur area saw a bumper crop this season. They did not get a good price last month.Traders and farmers who had stored small onions were getting good prices now, said trade and official sources.The prices were between Rs. 60 and Rs. 100 last week and increased to Rs. 115 to Rs. 120 now in the wholesale market.The retail price at Uzhavar Santhai on Wednesday was between Rs. 130 and Rs. 135. Bulk buying by the traders for exporting to Middle-East countries might also be a reason for the price rise, said Mr. Palanisamy.However, the prices of country tomato which was just about Rs. 30-a-kg last week has increased to Rs. 35- 38 per kg in Uzhavar Santhais on Wednesday. The prices of tomato is expected to come down in a fortnight, when farmers in Madukkarai block will begin harvest. Tomato was cultivated in 370 hectares in Madukkarai block and 80 hectare in other blocks in Coimbatore district, he said.Farmers Association (Tamilaga Vivasayeegal Sangam) secretary P. Kandasamy said farmers decided when to sell produce based on their needs than on market price.Most often the market intelligence reports were of little help to them as they did not, so far, factor in movement of produce from other States to the city.Having seen prices crash in local markets due to arrival of vegetables from other States, the local farmers had begun taking their needs into account to sell produce.The Government should ensure farmers get a stable price throughout the season, Mr. Rajendran said.(with inputs from R.

The purchase price of onion is Rs. 40 a kg, plus 5% tax. Despite the spiralling prices, we are selling onions at our outlets with a wafer-thing profit margin. Even the price of tomatoes has remained on the higher side, with the selling price hovering around Rs. 40 a kg, he said.Datta, manager at a HOPCOMS procurement centre, said there has been a drop in supply of onions from the major onion markets in north Karnataka and Maharashtra. This is following a fall in production owing to untimely rains.We have no agreement with the farmers on onion procurement. Therefore, we procure them directly from the wholesale dealers at the APMC [yard]. We pay them according to the days market rate with tax, he said.A cashier at a grocery shop in I Block of Ramakrishna Nagar said customers keep asking why the prices have skyrocketed and why they have not stabilised even after so many days."

According to the agriculture ministry, planting of (2017-18) kharif onions is 29% lowered than last year.Data from the National Horticulture Board shows that arrival of onions in major wholesale markets in October fell 17% compared to the year before.Domestic supplies are also tight as India exported 0.79 million tonnes of onions between April and August this year, show numbers from the Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority.In 2016-17, India exported 2.4 million tonnes of fresh onions, about a tenth of its estimated production of 21.7 million tonnes during the year."

Even shallot prices have doubled; they range from Rs 160 to Rs 170 in the open market. Such a steep hike has not been witnessed in many years, say some farmers from North Karnataka, which is a major onion-producing region.On an average, Bengaluru markets receive 80 to 100 truckloads of onions daily. Now only 20 to 25 truckloads of onions are being supplied from Hubballi and parts of Andhra Pradesh, which is one-fourth of the daily requirement, according to an office-bearer of the Bangalore Onion Traders Association . As a result, a kg of onion which was available at Rs 30-40 just a week ago now costs Rs 70. And in another one week, it may cross Rs 80, fear traders.In the wholesale market, onion prices are up by 25% in the past five days at Hubballi APMC, Asia's largest wholesale market for onions. Modal prices have been hovering at Rs 3,000-Rs 5,000 per quintal depending of the onion quality, due to a delay in arrival of the fresh kharif harvest.North Karnataka districts, including Dharwad, Gadag, Koppal, Belagavi and Raichur, were meeting 75 per cent of Karnataka's onion demand.

Vishwanath said the price rise was owing to a fall in supply.The production season for onions is over in the State and we have been procuring the vegetable from Nasik. But, owing to heavy rain in Nasik, farmers have been unable to harvest the crop and supply it to Karnataka, resulting in price rise. The situation should return to normal in a week to 10 days, he said.In retail chains, onion was selling at Rs. 50 on Thursday. But, the price is likely to increase on Friday and will be on a par with the HOPCOM rates, said a senior official from a retail chain.In the Bengaluru APMC market, supply of onion has trickled down to less than 30% of normal during this time of the year, said Ravishankar B. of Bengaluru Onion and Potato Merchants Association.As against an average of 2.5 lakh sacks during November, we got less than 50,000 sacks this month, he said.The fall in supply is also attributed to massive crop loss during the recent spells of heavy rain in September-October.This year sowing was delayed by over month. Instead of sowing in June, most farmers in the Chitradurga-Hubballi-Belagavi belt sowed onion in the second half of August.But the first sowing was ruined, as heavy rain led to water stagnation in the farms.There was massive crop loss in the second sowing as well owing to rain, bringing down the yield to less than half, he said.Onion harvest season in Karnataka starts from September and the crop floods the local markets till December. However, this year, the crop from Karnataka has almost stopped reaching the markets and now Karnataka is dependant on other States.There is hope that supply will stabilise by the new year when Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh harvest it. A good yield in these States is likely to ensure onion rates below Rs. 40 by new year.This year, sowing of onions was delayed by a month due to delayed monsoons.

Vishwanath said the price rise was owing to a fall in supply.The production season for onions is over in the State and we have been procuring the vegetable from Nasik. But, owing to heavy rain in Nasik, farmers have been unable to harvest the crop and supply it to Karnataka, resulting in price rise. The situation should return to normal in a week to 10 days, he said.In retail chains, onion was selling at Rs. 50 on Thursday.But, the price is likely to increase on Friday and will be on a par with the HOPCOM rates, said a senior official from a retail chain.In the Bengaluru APMC market, supply of onion has trickled down to less than 30% of normal during this time of the year, said Ravishankar B. of Bengaluru Onion and Potato Merchants Association.As against an average of 2.5 lakh sacks during November, we got less than 50,000 sacks this month, he said.The fall in supply is also attributed to massive crop loss during the recent spells of heavy rain in September-October.This year, sowing of onions was delayed by a month due to delayed monsoons. Instead of sowing in June, most farmers in the Chitradurga-Hubballi-Belagavi belt sowed in the second half of August.

Further price drop is expected as the effects of increased Minimum Export Price (MEP) and arrival of imported onions are set to kick in the market.Since June, onion prices had seen a steady rise with the wholesale market at Lasalgaon in Nashik recording average trade price of over Rs 3,000 per quintal. Drought in Karnataka and the late arrival of the kharif crop in Maharashtra were cited as the causes for the price rise. The stored rabi onion was feeding the market with Maharashtra being the only state with ample storage of onions. Onions from Maharashtra were feeding the markets and subsequently prices had crossed the Rs 3,500 per quintal mark in the wholesale markets. Retail prices had touched Rs 80 per kg.MEP and imports follow indirect tactics adopted by the government for the last two months to control onion prices. Income tax raids were conducted on traders in Nashik to look for stored onions. Reports had come in of traders being threatened by officials from the Ministry of Consumer Affairs to not raise the price in the wholesale markets. Talk of the possible raising of MEP and imports has been doing the rounds since September with traders terming this as sentiment doctoring to get the prices down. MEP has been zero since December 24, 2015 to boost exports and reduce the then glut in the market. Besides imposing an MEP of $850 per tonne, the central government has also floated tenders for importing 2,000 MT of onions. Both these moves, the government hopes, will bring down the onion prices in retail markets.This has not gone down well with the farmers. Santosh Goarde, an onion grower from the village in Talki in Niphad taluka of Nashik, said the governments move comes at a time when growers are being hounded by the power distribution companies to pay up their bills or face disconnection.The discom is demanding one time payment at a time farmers have no ready cash. When the prices were just getting right offsetting the losses of the last 18 months, the government took steps to stop it, he said. Deepak Chavan, an agro commodity analyst felt the crop has had its top run and prices will taper off slowly. Post December 15, the arrival of fresh onion will pick up momentum and prices will drop further, he said.For all the latest Pune News, download Indian Express App"

Traders said tomatoes cost Rs. 40 per kg due to shortage in supply, while onions were at Rs. 35 per kg. Rising prices of both vegetables over the past four weeks has inconvenienced both consumers and sellers alike, traders said.Officials at the APMC said both crops were hit by unseasonal rain, pushing the wholesale prices of tomato to between Rs. 30 and Rs. 40 per kg, and to between Rs. 50 and Rs. 60 in retail outlets. Onion prices, too, went up, selling in retail for Rs. 50 to Rs. 60, depending on quality and location. With the onion crop severely hit in Karnataka, the neighbouring State is depending almost completely on supply from Nashik. Of the 300 trucks of onions entering Bengaluru APMC, over 250 are from Nashik.Ashok Walunj, former director, onion and potato division, APMC, said supply has improved since Wednesday. Around 245 trucks of onion arrived on Thursday and Friday, pushing prices down. Were expecting a fresh stock of onions on Monday. This will bring down the rates further. Within a weeks time, rates will regularise to Rs. 15 to Rs. 20.Tomato, which usually costs between Rs. 18 to Rs. 25 per kg, was being sold at Rs. 45 per kg at the APMC on Friday. Shankar Pingle, former director, vegetables division, APMC, said. Usually, the tomato season starts by mid-October, bring prices down. This time, the tomato crop has been affected by rains in Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh in September. During the same time last year, tomatoes cost Rs. 10 to Rs. 15 per kg.Anil Rai, who is among the top tomato dealers in the market, said, On an average, 100 trucks would come to the APMC, each bearing 10 tonnes of tomatoes. This would be distributed across Mumbai Metropolitan Region. However, no supply at all from Karnataka has affected us the most. Whatever is coming to the market is from nearby districts including Nashik, Pune and Satara, but it isnt enough. As per APMC records, the vegetables division received around 40 vehicles of tomatoes on Friday.Mr. Rai added that as the tomato crop cycle is of 90 days, farmers have sown again and this produce is expected in the next 15 to 20 days. This will bring down rates further."

The price was in the upward direction as growers have been exporting their produce to Bengaluru. In the Hubballi retail market, the price of onion was about to cross Rs 70 per kg.Rachappa Gadagin, a farmer in Dambal village, Gadag district, said that where he gets a better price in Bengaluru. ""We need to pay commission in the local market, which is higher than the transportation charges required to send the produce to Bengaluru. We have to pay Rs 140 per quintal as transportation charges while the commission crosses Rs 170 in the local markets. So, we are all transporting our produce to Yeshwantpur market in Bengaluru,"" he explained.Nasir Hussain Attar, an onion trader in Hubballi APMC , noted that the supply from local farmers is very low in Hubballi.""As there were no rains in the beginning of the season, many farmers opted for traditional crops. The recent heavy rains destroyed onion crops. So we are depending on arrivals from neighbouring districts like Bagalkot , Belagavi and even Maharashtra,"" he stated.Another trader Suryakant Habib predicted that the arrival from Maharashtra will increase from Monday. ""Once it starts, the price will automatically come down. However, onion sowing has decreased all over the nation due to drought. Moreover, onion growers turned to other crops as prices crashed to Rs 300-500 per quintal last year. These aspects are expected to maintain average price for onion in the market,"" he said.Gonibasappa Korlahalli, president, Karnataka State Onion Growers Association, said: ""Price was in upward direction till this week and now it is coming down slowly. Cyclone in neighbouring states, arrival from Maharashtra is the reason for the decrease of price. However, there is hope of retaining average price as North Karnataka has grown small onion more this year. There is big demand for this small onion, which is tastier than its bigger counterparts from Malaysia, Singapore and Pakistan. As Maharashtra has grown bigger onion, its arrival cannot compete with our produce,"" he said.Umesha Pujar, who runs an eatery in Vidyanagar, said that he had to replace onions, which cost Rs 7-8 per piece, with cabbage."

5b2e93039855b72640116345,Make MSP legally binding,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/667222/make-msp-legally-binding.html,2017-12-12,"For over two weeks last month, farmers in Chhattisgarh's Durg district dumped tomatoes on to the streets. In just one village, Parsuli, an estimated 100 quintals was either fed to cattle or left to rot in the crop fields. After a relatively better marketing season that lasted till the first week of January, retail prices plunged.Far away, farmers in Erode district in Tamil Nadu were a worried lot after the retail price of cabbage crashed. From Rs 12/kg last year, it dropped to as low as Re 1 per kg. In Chhattisgarh, too, tomato prices crashed, leaving farmers in the lurch.Not fetching more than Rs 2 per kg, farmers simply abandoned the tomato harvest. The deplorable price they get in the market is not even enough to meet the plucking and harvesting cost.This is primarily because of higher production. Whether it is cabbage, tomato, potato, onions or any other crop, the higher the production, lower is the price. A higher production enables middlemen to form cartels and manipulate prices, often to the extent of exploitation.T Rajaganesh, a farmer in Erode district, asks: ""Farmers spend at least Rs 45,000 per acre a month to cultivate cabbage. Add to it the cost of labour, maintenance and fertiliser, and the cost shoots up to more than Rs 50,000 a month.Since it takes almost three months to yield, we have to spend at least Rs 1.5 lakh per acre before harvesting. How can we realise a profit with a farmgate price of Rs 1 per kg?""In the case of tomato too, average cost of production is about Rs 90,000-1 lakh per acre for small farmers. For the big farms, the production cost is a little higher, at Rs 1.25 lakh per acre.Till the first week of January, when I travelled to meet tomato farmers in Durg, the prices were much better - about Rs 1,000 per crate of 25 kg. But, with the advent of tomato crop from Karnataka, the supplies swelled, and prices slumped.Now, let's take the case of chana. According to news reports, chana prices are ruling at about Rs 3,600 per quintal, against the Minimum Support Price (MSP) of Rs 4,400 per quintal, a drop of 20% in the retail price.With production expected to increase to 10 million tonnes this year (from 9.33 million tonnes last year), prices are expected to dip with arrivals picking up. Even wheat price has remained below MSP by 6-8% in Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh, where early crop harvest hit the mandis.In February last week, market price for tur dal was ruling at Rs 4,500 per quintal, against the procurement price of Rs 5,500 at Tandur market in Telangana.Meanwhile, reports of tomato being dumped on the streets in Chhattisgarh poured in again in early March. This is the third year in a row when tomato prices have crashed to Re 1 per kg. In fact, this is the third year in a row when prices of almost all agricultural commodities have crashed across the country.Karnataka modelAfter two years of drought in 2014 and 2015, production picked up after a favourable monsoon in 2016 and 2017. While the increase in production has brought cheers to the government, the drop in prices has added to the misery of farmers.It is here that I see the relevance of a very timely suggestion made by Dr TN Prakash, chairman of the Karnataka Agricultural Prices Commission. He has called for making the Minimum Support Price of crops to be legally binding. He said: ""Consumers have legal protection if produce is sold above MRP and can approach the courts. But, even after 70 years of Independence, farmers don't have similar protection.""For the third year in a row, prices of almost all commodities are at 20-45% lower than MSP in various parts of the country. At times of glut, traders ruthlessly exploit farmers. Even the introduction of the Unified Market Platform in Karnataka, which led to the expansion of 585 eNAM (National Agricultural Market) throughout the country, farmers have not gained.The concept of model price, which is based on the average of the day's trading, is in reality a distress price and needs to be dispensed with. eNAM in reality is a nationwide platform being created to make it profitable for spot trading.In addition to 23 crops for which MSP is announced every year, state governments must work out MSP for highly perishable commodities like tomato, potato, onion and other vegetables.Many states already have a Farmers' Commission, which has more or less become retiring rooms for political appointees.The immediate need is to convert them into State Agricultural Prices Commission, with the mandate to provide higher income to farmers, similar to that in Karnataka. If Karnataka can ensure procurement of 14 crops at prices much higher than the MSP announced by the Centre, I see no reason why other states cannot."

While warming of a status quo till end of January, officials of the Telangana states agricultural marketing department attribute the abnormal price rise to the excessive rains in onion-growing states such as Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka and West Bengal.They predict a price correction by February.Late rainfall in September and October damaged the onion kharif crop in Telangana also. Due to this, the supplies are now coming in only from Maharashtra, said Padma Harsha , deputy director of department.Predictably, J Ananthaiah, selection grade secretary, agricultural market committee at Malakpet , said that the daily procurements have dropped from nearly 40,000 bags per day to 10,000-15,000 onions bags per day, thus pushing the rates northwards.The steep jump in costs has adversely impacted traders in other markets whove stopped selling onions. We cannot purchase onions at such a rise price. Hence, we are clearing our old stock. If the situation continues, we may be forced to keep our shops shut, said Mohammed Abid , a vegetable vendor at the Erragadda Rhythu Bazaar.Not just onions, prices of other vegetables such as tomato, cabbage, carrot too have registered a more than 200 per cent rise in price rise as compared to the last winter season. While one kg of tomato cost 8 in December 2016, the price has now shot to 26 per kg. The price of carrot has increased from 16 to 50 per kg.Onions and tomato are basic vegetables. With the price rise, we are now forced to purchase these vegetables in lesser quantities, said Vijayalaxmi, a housewife from Kokapet. The steep rise in cost of vegetables has driven inflation to an eight-month high of 3.93 per cent."
