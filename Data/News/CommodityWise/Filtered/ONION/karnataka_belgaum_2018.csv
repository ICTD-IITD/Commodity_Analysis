In Chennai, the price is ruling at Rs 45/kg, as per the official data. A similar trend prevails in small cities as well.""It is a temporary phase. Traders are taking advantage of the temporary ups and downs. But the fundamentals are strong,"" Agriculture Secretary S K Pattanayak told PTI.Though the onion crop is estimated to be slightly lower in the 2017-18 crop year (July-June) but the total production would be sufficient to meet the domestic requirement, he said.As per the Agriculture Ministry's data, the country's onion production is estimated to decline by 4.5 per cent to 21.4 million tonnes in the 2017-18 crop year due to lower acreage as against 22.4 million tonnes last year.Pattanayak said the prices of onion will get corrected with the increase in arrival of the crop in the coming days.Nasik-based National Horticultural Research And Development Foundation (NHRDF) acting Director P K Gupta said, ""The arrival of the Kharif onion is less at present and therefore prices are under pressure. The arrivals are expected to improve by end of the month and the prices will accordingly get corrected."" The kharif onion output is expected to be lower as acreage was down by 20-25 per cent because of less rains during the sowing period in key growing states Maharashtra, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, he said.Once the kharif arrival and later rabi onion crop hits the market, the retail price situation will automatically improve, he added."

Those who braved the early morning chill to head to the Koyambedu wholesale market on Friday, part from of course retail merchants, came away with bagas of vegetables, most of them for a scarcely believable Rs 10 per kg and below.With truckloads of vegetables flooding the market, the cost of vegetables has crashed. Chandran , president of Koyambedu Market Licensed Merchants Association said brinjal, beans, cabbage, ladies finger (okra), broad beans and tomato sold for less than Rs 10 per kilogram.The arrival of trucks with these vegetables has increased by 25% from the average 100 to 125 vehicles. So, this has reflected in a significant drop , he said.While one kilogram of onion cost anything between Rs 30/kg and Rs 40/kg, potato and yam sold for Rs 15/kg to Rs 20/kg and Rs 20/kg to Rs 25/kg.The wholesale market received 450 trucks of vegetables and about 50 vehicles more to meet the demand for Pongal from different parts of Tamil Nadu , Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka The situation in the retail markets, however, was different, with residents in many areas saying prices were much higher.Responding to this, Chandran said retail traders would factor in a minimum a profit margin of Rs 10 for every kilogram of vegetables to meet the expenses incurred in transporting the goods to respective places."

When politicians trade barbs and innuendo on social networking sites, it translates to business as usual. The key is to inform voters, not rabble-rouse or flood them with babble. Politicians not only need to broadcast their views, but also listen to their voters. And that should be done intelligently.BENGALURU: The Congress on Monday distanced itself from its social media head Divya Spandanas controversial tweet that made a derogatory and personal attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi , soon after she came under flak.Divya alias Ramya, former Mandya MP, had on Sunday taken a dig at Modi, wondering if he was on pot (cannabis), a putdown which invited sharp criticism. The actor-turned-politicians swipe came following Modis comment at a rally here, during which he said farmers were his top priority and described TOP as tomato, onion and potato. Is this what happens when youre on POT? she tweeted.Reacting to the pot jibe, chief minister Siddaramaiah said he is not aware of the tweet, but character assassination of any individual was not right.I have countered Modis allegations point-by-point against our government, but refrained from making any personal attack.

The farms floor is iridescent-green and spongy as you walk it. Its actually a month-old black gram or channa crop. Ram risks losing this bucolic haven measuring 3.72 hectares to his creditors.A loan of Rs 3 lakh taken on Kisan Credit Card from the Punjab National Banks Badalwas branch in Sikar district turned into a Rs 4.5 lakh monster after repeated defaults.It was like a noose around my neck, he says, showing off a notice issued on February 9, 2017 from a local official in Dhod tehsil to auction his land to the highest bidder. An auction fee of 5% was also added to the outstanding. Then, the bidding took place.One-third of the total land holding  which is Rams share in the family property -- was auctioned at Rs 18 lakh to the highest bidder, Nandlal Chawla from a neighbouring town.Just as the auction proceedings were being closed, Ram showed up to pay the debt. He had collected the outstanding by begging and borrowing from everyone he could ask for help. Effectively, that was a loan to repay another loan. At the behest of local elders, the auction was reversed, he says.Ram isnt off the hook yet. Now, I worry about paying all these creditors who helped me save my land from Punjab National Bank, he says.Farmers in many states have got into precisely these sorts of debt traps  a generic problem caused by high costs of cultivation and falling returns from agriculture. In state after state, governments have succumbed to pressure and waived off farm loans or are considering doing so. Maharashtra, Punjab, Madhya Pradesh, and Karnataka have waived off loans, or partially written off loans, or part of the interests.On February 12, Rajasthan announced it would partially write off loans owed by small and marginal farmers worth Rs 8000 crore. Its decision was forced by an 11-day protest by farmers in Sikar, 200 km from capital Jaipur from September 1-13 2017, last year.History shows that an agitation launched from Sikar never fails. It has always spelt trouble for governments. It is a revolutionary place, says Amra Ram, the leader of All-India Kisan Sabha, who led the agitation. The siege was intense. Highways were blocked. Traders shuttered shops and transactions in the Sikar farmers market ground to a halt. Thousands from all over the politically influential Shekhawati region  comprising the three big districts of Churu, Sikar and Jhunjhunu  joined in. Amra Ram says the loan waiver will cover only 2% of the farmers caught in debt traps.In 2000, the Kisan Sabha forced the government to release more power to farms. In 2015, it forced the then government to roll back electricity tariff hike after a 15-day protest, just like it forced the current government to defer a decision to raise rural electrify prices in 2016.What made last years agitation successful was that everybody joined us, even local DJs, with their fan following, says Ram Ratan, a prominent farm leader from Sikar. DJs bring to mind hip jockeys in city nightclubs, but in the Shekhawati region, they are local Jat youth who play ear-numbing music in local marriages, religious festivals, birthdays and other rural events from atop specially modified pickup trucks. When harvests are good, they make good money. When onion prices crashed in Sikar  the biggest growing district in Rajasthan  even DJs were without business.The Rajasthan governments loan waiver, limited to small and marginal farmers, is a follow up on an agreement it had signed with protesting Sikar farmers.It promises to pay off Rs 50,000 of each small farmers total outstanding on short-duration loans taken from cooperative banks. The first test of whether this has managed to placate farmers took place on February 22. The main farmers body that staged the massive agitation last year, forcing the government to accept its demands, called for a similar agitation on that day. It believed the waiver wasnt enough because it takes care of just 1 of its 11 demands. Its major demands were a total loan waiver, not partial, of all categories of farmers and a complete freeing up of cattle trade in the state.Despite a loan waiver, hundreds of farmers blocked the Bikaner-Agra national highway 52 near Sikar town on Thursday. Two days ago, the government arrested the national secretary of Kisan Sabha, Amra Ram and his colleague Pema Ram, to pre-empt the protests. Our leaders were arrested when they were on a padyatra (protest march) in Jaipur, Ratan, their colleague said.With elections due later this year in the state, the government is watching the farm sector closely.We need to understand that Rajasthan is neither Gujarat, nor Maharashtra. Rajasthans economy is mostly about tourism, mines and agriculture. I dont think disruption from policies such as the Goods and Services Tax is an issue here unlike in Gujarat, which is a textile hub, says Prof. Sanjay Lodha of Udaipurs Mohanlal Sukhadia University. The plight of farmers is because they havent been getting good prices, Lodha says.Just a few years ago, things were smooth-sailing. The rough patch in Rajasthans agriculture began roughly four years ago. Incredibly, a fracking boom in faraway US -- which saw a surge in natural gas production to offset rising oil prices -- brought prosperity to Rajasthans poorest farmers.Fracking is a method of extracting shale gas by pumping high-pressured gas into the ground, which requires a processed powder called guar gum made from guar (cluster beans). Rajasthan is Indias largest gaur producer, with a share of 84% in national output. At its peak, the total export value of Indias guar gum  most of it from Rajasthan  rose to Rs 21,287 crore from about Rs 121 crore in 2003-04. In 2016-17, this came down to just Rs 3,106.62, an 85% fall.The boom ended but farmers got used to better lifestyles. They bought cars, tractors and jewellery. The boom was over in 2012-13. What followed were two years of drought beginning 2014-15. Farmers were already in distress. They got angry when they heard the government was going to increase power tariffs, says retired bureaucrat Shankarlal Choudhury.The pastoral economy has also been hit by self-styled cow vigilantes.Laxman Singh, a livestock farmer in Dujod village, says income from cattle trade has dwindled because of cow vigilantism. Milch cattle were like ATMs. If I need money, I just sell them. Theres hardly any buyer now, he said. The government has tried to do its bit. Agriculture minister Prabhulal Saini says the government procured pulses, soyabean and peanuts worth Rs 2,800 crore at minimum support prices.Rajasthan has also promised 6 months of free cow feed to cow shelters worth Rs 50 crore and help set up biogas plants in 25 identified large gaushalas with a subsidy of Rs 40 lakh for each. It is banking on these measures ahead of the crucial poll that will decide the fate of the Vasundhara Raje-led government.The farmers are still unhappy lot. There are stuck on a demand for a total loan waiver. Ratan says he and others have forcibly put off auctioning of 122 land-holdings in Sikar, none of which will be benefit from the current loan waiver because they arent small farmers."

Grocery shop owners in the city cashed in on the huge demand by selling the small onion variety for Rs. 150 a kg in May, June and July last year. In fact, the government had to step in and sell them in farm fresh outlets at cost price in order to stabilise the market rate.This time of the year, however, it is a different story. The prices of shallot have crashed in Tiruchi market due to copious influx from major onion production centres. They are now for the taking for Rs. 18 and Rs. 24 per kg.On Wednesday, a kg of high quality onion sold at Rs. 24 and the Mysore variety at Rs. 18.Traders attribute heavy arrivals from production centres to the steep drop in prices. Besides being sourced from Thuraiyur, Perambalur, Chettikulam and neighbouring areas in Tiruchi and Perambalur districts, Tiruchi market also gets onion from Theni, Cumbum and Palladam. The supply from these areas is at an average level. But it is the arrival from Mysore, Samraj Nagar and Kollekal in Karnataka that has pushed down the prices. The traders from Karnataka are diverting additional loads to Tiruchi beyond the actual demand.On an average, the market receives 15 to 20 loads (12 tonnes each) daily. But it has increased to 25 to 30 loads during the last two weeks.Onion production in the State seems to be on average scale. But heavy arrival of shallot from Karnataka is the main reason for the price slash, says P. Chandru, a wholesale trader at Gandhi Market.Traders say there are chances of the prices coming down further in the days to come."

They came in a fleet of lumbering tractors, around 80,000 peasants, cattle, hay to be used as bedding and foodgrains to see them through an unrelenting protest.It was the scene of a spectacular rural takeover of Delhi. Tens of thousands of farmers erected tents, slept, cooked food and ate in the open as well as defecated there, laying siege to the Boat Club lawns, a stones throw from Parliament. They vowed to not budge until their demands for higher sugarcane prices and a waiver of electricity charges were met.Tikaits Bhartiya Kisan Union successfully extracted key concessions from the then Rajiv Gandhi-led government.Farm protests have seldom been so strong, but in Maharashtra in March, 35,000 farmers walked 180 km on a long march to reach Mumbai from the states Nashik district seeking loan waivers  a turnout not seen since the days of Tikaits agitation.Farm loan waivers have now become the new rallying point for farmers movement because there are just losses, losses everywhere, says Amra Ram, a leader of the All-India Kisan Sabha, the organisation that led the long march.Under the NDA government, farmers havent fared too well due to a combination of factors, including two successive droughts and a slump in global food prices. This has led farmers groups and lobbies to re-energise themselves around two key demands  loan waivers and profitable prices.Dont call it a protest. Ours is a political movement of farmers, says Kedar Sirohi, the Indore-based social-media savvy leader of the Aam Kisan Union (General Farmers Union).Before Tikait, there was another tall peasant leader in Chaudhary Charan Singh, a former chief minister of Uttar Pradesh (UP). His biographer Paul Brass, a professor at the University of Washington, writes in An Indian Political Life that Charan Singh was devoted throughout his political career to the interests of the peasantry.According to Brass, Singh, a known detractor of Nehru, sowed the seeds of a strong farmers lobby in north India by first dissenting against the Congress 1959 Nagpur Resolution on Agriculture, which advocated collectivisation and a cooperative model for the farm sector.The Nagpur Resolution was the most significant agrarian programme formulated by the Congress since the abolition of zamindari in several States, wrote Walter Hauser in a January 1959 piece in The Economic and Political Weekly, analysing Singhs role. Singh contended that cooperatives will lead to bigness and that this, with mechanized agriculture, would result in a decrease in per capita production rather than an increase, Hauser writes.Building on his peasant support base, Charan Singh went on to become prime minister.Read: Agriculture not always a dead end: Here are young, successful farmers who made the cutThe green revolution of 1960s saw farmers prosper and emerge as a class of bullock capitalists, a term coined by American political scientists Lloyd I. Rudolph and Susan Rudolph to describe the empowered Indian agrarian class. Bullock capitalists were well-to-do enough to raise their voice politically, but werent fully capitalist farmers, the Rudolphs logic went.This was followed by the rise of powerful farmer organisations. These included Rajya Ryot Sangha in Karnataka, the Bharatiya Kisan Union in UP and Punjab as well as the Tamil Nadu Agriculturists Association in Tamil Nadu and the Shetkari Sanghatana in Maharashtra.A new era of social-media-enabled farm movement has now taken over.As it heads into a crucial general election due next year, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has promised a slew of measures to quell farmer protests, including prices that are at least 50% over production costs.The Congress has promised a fresh loan waiver if voted to power like the one it announced in 2008 (and which played a part in its return to power in 2009).The BJP-ruled states of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, UP and Congress-ruled Punjab have already announced loan waivers, forced by protests.Maharashtra (also ruled by the BJP) did so too.Loan waivers are a pressing demand because the single biggest cause of agrarian distress is indebtedness. Farmers take loans to buy inputs such as seeds and irrigation machinery. Many of these farmers get into debt traps when crops fail or prices fall.The Situation Assessment Surveys of the National Sample Survey Organisation (NSSO, 2013) has reconfirmed the situation analysed in 2003 by the NSSOs 59th round of indebtedness of farm households. It showed that 52% of farm households in India are in debt.Loan waivers could have a bearing on the combined fiscal deficit of states. According to India Ratings and Research, farm debt waivers announced by five states together are likely to widen the combined fiscal deficit of states by ?107700 crore. Bankers have argued against farm loan waivers because they are no panacea and could affect credit growth.According to Reserve Bank of India data, bad loans in agriculture have increased by ?11,400-crore in 2017 to over ?60,000 crore, a jump of 23%, from 2016.From 2012-13, the year before the BJP government took office, till 2016-17, bad loans in the agriculture sector have increased 142.74%. The biggest defaults were during in 2016-17, suggesting a worsening of agrarian distress.RBI data further shows that compared to 20.83% defaults by corporate borrowers, defaults by farmers stood at only 6% of their total outstanding.This shows that farmers dont willfully default. Why dont they catch the bigger thieves? asks Ram of the All India Kisan Sabha.Agricultural economist AV Manjunatha of the Bangalore-based Institute of Social and Economic Change, who carried out an all-India study on farmer suicides, says farmers in real distress do need some sort of system to report distress. They also need facilities to negotiate loan restructuring. These could be adopted as policy solutions, he said.A new phase of farmers mobilisation has put both state and central governments on a tight leash. Reforms in markets and other structural measures for a better farming future dont appeal as much as loan waivers.They put my land on notice for auction. Its the only thing I have. Only a loan waiver can save me, says Tulchha Ram, an onion grower from Rajasthan Sikars district."

Moreover, the farmers of Rasipuram and Vennanthur too have been supplying the small onion to Salem markets.At present, the wholesale markets in the city have been receiving about 20 tonnes of small onion per day. The wholesale price of small onion has been ranging between Rs. 7 and Rs. 14 per kg. The retail price in the uzhavar santhais ranged between Rs. 15 and Rs. 20.The wholesale markets have also been receiving Bellary onion from Karnataka and Maharashtra.With the arrival of more stock of small onion and Bellary onion, their price was expected to go down further in the days to come, he said."

With the peak summer days round the corner, the cost of several vegetables is slowly on the rise.Traders at the Koyambedu wholesale market noted that the prices of vegetables were steadily increasing since the last week of March. While some vegetables are costlier by up to 40 % compared to last month, most of them are priced at least 20 % more. However, many merchants reported brisk sales due to the festive season.Beans, broad beans and tomatoes are among the costly vegetables this season. While one kg of beans is sold for nearly Rs. 55 depending on the quality, broad beans are priced at Rs. 50 a kg in the wholesale market. These vegetables are sold for Rs. 65-Rs. 70 a kg at the retail market.Some residents like Sivagami B., a resident of Anna Nagar, use green vegetables from their home garden more often to deal with runaway increase in prices.According to wholesale traders at Koyambedu, the citys hub of perishable goods, some staple vegetables such as potato, onion and small onions remain affordable. Drumsticks are among the few seasonal vegetables that are cheaper.P. Sukumar, treasurer, Koyambedu Vegetables, Fruits and Flowers Merchants Welfare Association, said the prices of vegetables begin to increase in April as yield would be less due to depleting groundwater sources. Even vegetables like chayote (chow chow) that are priced within Rs. 15 a kg are costly as the market did not receive its share from Karnataka. The demand for cucumber and lime has also pushed the prices up this week.The Koyambedu market receives 320 truckloads of produce daily, which is nearly 80 trucks less compared to March.We dont expect a steep hike like last March as there is sporadic rainfall across the State now and also in Karnataka. Vegetables were at least 50% costly than usual during May and June last year, he said."

The farmers are apparently betting big on floriculture in view of growing demand for cut flowers in the country and abroad.The farmers, who used to cultivate capsicum, British cucumber, onion shallots etc, are diversifying to floriculture with a view to improve their earnings. The farmers in the district used to cultivate capsicum and other exotic vegetables in 37 acre. The farmers used to earn Rs. 8 lakh to Rs. 10 lakh per acre when capsicum was being cultivated. But, of late, they found that prices of capsicum would fall if there was a bumper crop in neighbouring Karnataka.Farmers like Akbar Basha felt that floriculture is an alternative way to tide over the problem and switched over to cultivation of cut roses. He began cultivation of hybrid roses in 2.17 acre land. Thanks to the poly house technique employed for floriculture, now, 10 to 15 acre is under hybrid roses and gerberas are being cultivated.Integrated pack housesWhen contacted, Deputy Director (Horticulture) B.A. Subba Rayudu says the floriculture is picking up in places like Penugonda and Konduru village in Lepakshi mandal of the district. The firms like Kusalav Organics have also began cultivation of the roses. The farmers are setting up integrated pack houses which include cold rooms, grading and packing facilities. Rose bud nets were also being used to ensure that the flower blossoms after reaching the destination, he says.Mr. Rayudu says that the government was giving a subsidy of Rs. 12 lakh per acre to construct the poly houses. Each farmer may spend between Rs. 34 lakh and Rs. 35 lakh per acre to develop the poly house.The farmers were harvesting about 2 lakh flowers per acre. They get around Rs. 8 lakh to Rs. 10 lakh per acre. Each flower costs at least Rs. 5, he explains."

Petrol , too, has reached an all-time high of Rs 78.91 a litre in Kolkata and is inching towards breaching the Rs-80-a-litre mark, but it is the hike in diesel price that has the transport sector more worried.I have tracked diesel prices since the last three decades and not seen anything like this, West Bengal Petroleum Dealers Association president Tushar Kanti Sen said. On Sunday, diesel price in the city increased 26 paise to hit Rs 70.12 per litre.This may have a direct impact on inflation in the short term, economist Abhirup Sarkar said. The worry is that the price of essentials may see a sudden spike, he added.Economists fears are not unfounded. Bus operators have barely waited for the panchayat poll results to be declared before pressing for a hike in fares again.Truck operators have called an emergency meeting for an imminent strike as they will be hit the hardest by the diesel price hike. Subhas Bose, general secretary of West Bengal Truck Operators Welfare Association, said: All India Motor Congress is scheduled go for an indefinite strike from June. But we might need to call the strike much earlier.Tapan Bandyopadhyay of the Joint Council of Bus Syndicates said, Operating buses have become completely unviable. If the government does not raise fares immediately, the private bus trade will go into a coma. Fares were last revised in September 2014 when diesel price was Rs 54/lt. Now, the situation is such that we dont even need to call a strike for our demands, he added.The diesel price hike is expected to have a direct impact on the prices of food items. Bengal imports coconut from Kerala, medicines from Mumbai, onion from Nasik and textile from Gujarat and Punjab . The fare for a 12-wheel trucks Kolkata-Mumbai round trip is Rs 1.5 lakh. The diesel price rise this May alone will increase that amount by Rs 12,000. It will obviously have a ripple effect on everything, said Bose.Oil PSUs are estimated to have lost about Rs 500 crore on absorbing higher cost resulting from the spike in international oil rates and fall in rupee against the US dollar during the nearly-three-week hiatus because of the Karnataka assembly polls. The bad news is that diesel prices will travel north further to match current international prices. The benchmark international diesel rates during this period have climbed from US$ 84.68 per barrel to US$ 90.28 per barrel. Also, the rupee has weakened to Rs 67.27 per US dollar from Rs 66.62, making imports costlier, explained transport economist Tarit Dasgupta.There is also a strong demand for bringing petrol and diesel under the purview of GST. This would have reduced the fuel price considerably. But the governments have treated fuel price as the biggest source of revenue. This is why a number of cess and taxes are imposed on the fuel to make it costlier than what it should be, said a logistics farm official."

Where is profit? I think I will not even earn the cost of cultivation, he said in dismay.Onion farmers in the district have been facing the same problem for the last three years as they are unable to get any profit from their produce in the open market.With the hope of getting some profits at least this year, farmers cultivated onion in over 2,950 hectares of land during the rabi season, while they had cultivated the crop on 2,651 hectares of land during the kharif season.Though onion is arriving in the APMC yards, owing to falling prices farmers are unable to earn any profit.The prices have come down to Rs. 600 a quintal in the open market, while in retail it is being sold at Rs. 15-Rs. 20 a kg.At this rate, farmers will not recover even the cost of cultivation. Surely, lower prices will make consumers happy but certainly not the cultivators who have been incurring loss for the last three years, said Arvind Kulkarni, district general secretary of Akhanda Karnataka Raita Sangha.Meanwhile, officials of the Horticulture Department also said that a specific policy should have been framed to help onion farmers.When cultivation dips, prices shoot up causing inconvenience to consumers and when prices fall, it becomes a burden for farmers. There is no middle way where consumers and farmers can both be kept happy, the officials said."

(Express photo by Arul Horizon) The increased arrival has subdued the price of onions, which are trading at Rs 6-7 per kg in mandis. (Express photo by Arul Horizon)The central government has announced a 5 per cent incentive on onion exports to boost the roots flagging prices, said Pasha Patel, chairman of the state governments committee for agricultural prices. Patel said he had met Union Minister of commerce Suresh Prabhu to discuss the matter. The minister has agreed to extend 5 per cent incentive for onion under the Merchandise Export from India Scheme, Patel told The Indian Express on Thursday.Onion prices have crashed in the wholesale markets of Maharashtra due to the bumper crop in the state. This year, Maharashtra reported plantation of over 3.5 lakh hectares of land, instead of the usual 3 lakh hectares. The increased arrival has subdued the price of onions, which are trading at Rs 6-7 per kg in mandis. The price drop comes after an eight month bull run for the bulb in wholesale markets. From June last year till early March, average prices of the bulb hovered between Rs 25 per kg and 30 per kg.The price rise was mainly due to the drought in Karnataka, which had resulted in the failure of Karnatakas rabi crop last year. Rabi or summer onion is planted late December and harvested post March-April. This onion is the only one which is amenable for storage and feeds the market from April till September before the arrival of kharif onions. Farmers in Maharashtra store these onions moisture proof storage structures called kanda chawls and offload them when prices are right.Last year, due to the scarcity of onions, prices were high. The government took several steps to reduce the prices, such as importing at least 20,000 tonnes of onion while income tax officials raided the premises of seven traders who were allegedly storing onions. Also, the Minimum Export Price (MEP), which was kept at zero since December 2015, was raised to $850 per tonne. Between April 2017 and February 2018, the country had seen exports of 21,35,421.57 tonnes of the bulb  a record high.Since March, onion prices have been on the wane as arrival has increased in wholesale markets. The governments decision to free exports by removing the MEP slab in February had failed to boost the market sentiments. Similarly, the decision of Nafed to wade in the market and procure 25,000 tonnes of the bulb at Maharashtras Lasalgoan mandi had failed to firm up the prices. It is expected that the price of the bulb will increase in the days to come. Agri-commodity analyst Dipak Chavan also welcomed the move, saying this will be beneficial for domestic markets. Our currency is at an all time low, so this incentive will have a positive effect on the markets and firm up the prices, he said.For all the latest Pune News, download Indian Express App"
5b1374ed9855b7624637765f,Handling perception is Modi’s biggest challenge,http://www.newindianexpress.com/prabhu-chawla/column/2018/may/27/handling-perception-is-modis-biggest-challenge-1819883.html,2018-05-27,"Prabhu Chawla ByReformist US President Franklin D Roosevelt once said: The future lies with those political leaders who realize that the great public is interested more in government than in politics. As India wades into the election battlefield next year, it will be governance that decides the mandate and not mudslinging. Indian voters have usually voted out non-performing leaders to bring in ones who promised better governance or Achche Din. Last week, almost the entire Opposition descended on Bengaluru to forge the blueprint of an alliance which will try to dislodge Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2019.They had little in common except a venomous dislike for him. The optics of Mamata Banerjee and Mayawati, Sitaram Yechury and Siddaramaiah, Sonia Gandhi and Sharad Pawar, Rahul Gandhi and Akhilesh Yadav and others preening on a festive stage erected as a launching pad for HD Kumaraswamys ascension to the chief ministership of Karnataka was a political anagram spelling a warning to Modi. Beware! Our phalanx is ready to demolish your juggernaut.Not one of them put forth an alternative agenda for governance, and refrained from attacking each other, as they had done before arriving in Bengaluru and did soon after landing back home. But the message from Bengaluru was loud and clear: Battle 2019 would be fought between the Mighty Dozen and Crafty Modi. Once again, history is repeating itself.In 1977, it was Indira vs the Rest. In 1989, it was Rajiv vs United Enemies. The choices were between one opportunistic coalition and an unprincipled alliance. In 2018, Modi finds himself in the unenviable position of facing the entire regiment of Opposition leaders who cannot individually defeat him in nearly any major state. Rajiv Gandhis Congress was trounced by his own former minister VP Singh, who launched the Janata Dal from Bengaluru in 1988, supported by the BJP and the Communists. For Modi, 2019 is a greater challenge than 2014, when he was pitted against a defamed government and tainted leadership. Since then he has almost fulfilled his promise of achieving a Congress-mukt Bharat. What next?Though the Congress is just a ghost now, the BJP and its partners rule 22 states while regional satraps control the remaining states where the BJP is weak; some of them were once part of the NDA. The challenge for the Congress and other non-BJP Opposition parties is to snatch Lok Sabha seats away from the saffron sultan. Analysis of data shows that the electorate rejects over 65 per cent of sitting lawmakers in every state in every poll.This means the probability of sitting BJP MPs losing is higher than that of Opposition legislators, who together hold only 225 seats in the current Parliament. Hence, the Opposition has joined hands to take advantage of the anti-incumbency factor in Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Haryana and other states where the BJP has been in power for one or more than two terms. Various opinion polls also indicate its vote share may shrink.While Modi remains the voters top choice, his personal popularity has shown a significant fall. However, it is not impossible for him to win a second mandate by making a course correction in the next nine months. Having created an admirable climate of economic stability and GDP growth, the prime minister will need to convince the voters that he has provided a government which works by adopting the Mantra of Reform, Perform and Transform. For that he must:*Improve perception. Modis promise of delivering Maximum Governance with Minimum Government seduced peoples high expectations. He correctly thought of right-sizing or downsizing the government. But four years later, its mass has bloated further. There are more secretaries and higher level officials now than in 2014. Bureaucracy is like a wildfire that has spread in favourable winds across the corridors of power. Taking advantage of the PMs trust in honest officers, babus have created innumerable tribunals, commissions and expert groups to accommodate retired colleagues.*Tame inflation: Modi had promised to reduce prices and provide more employment. Though the job market has shown recovery, it is less than expected. The wholesale price index is either stagnant or stuck, though within tolerable limits. Yet the perception created by the record spurt in petroleum product prices should be a major concern.The BJP made gas prices one of its major election issues in 2014. In 2018, consumers are paying more to fill fuel tanks, though the average cost of imported crude is down 40 per cent. Public perception that the government is squeezing the middle class is gaining ground. Modi should perhaps note that the BJP lost many elections in the late 1990s due to a rise in onion prices. Any hike in petroleum prices devastates the domestic budgets of the middle and lower classes. It has a spiralling effect on the cost of other goods and services. Providing affordable housing to the middle class is still a dream. Healthcare costs are exorbitant and the quality has plummeted in most of India.*Increase his Indian footprint. Modi has left his imprint on international diplomacy through inimitable Modihuplomacy. During the past four years he has travelled to a record number of countries and exhibited his popularity and innovative skills to numerous global leaders. But now he needs to reconnect himself with the electorate more. The BJP has wrested all the states from the Congress thanks to his magnetism. Modi is bigger than the BJP; the voters plump for him and not for his party. His domestic travel should be aimed at connecting with his core constituency and not just official events.Former deputy prime minister LK Advanis political relevance may have diminished in New India, but Modi should take his cue from a statement he made after the 2004 Lok Sabha elections, that the BJP lost because it had ignored its core constituencythe middle class and the committed Sangh Parivaris.*Forget Rahul and Sonia Gandhi. The prime minister is committing the cardinal mistake of attacking the Gandhi Parivar more frequently than politically required.Both mother and son had almost hit the political bottom after the Congress won just 44 seats in 2014 and lost in all the states it ruled between 2014 and 2018. Gandhi bashing paid dividends in 2014 since they remote-controlled the Manmohan Singh government and were punished by the electorate. Double jeopardy does not work. Indira Gandhi was defeated in 1977 for imposing the Emergency, but staged a triumphant return in 1980. The Atal Bihari Vajpayee-led NDA lost in 2004 despite an admirable performance.During the run-up to the 2019 elections, Modis oratorical skills and charisma would face the real test. He will have to convince India that he is not a leader who makes promises which are forgotten soon after the election, and that he has actually delivered more than what was promised in 2014."

This price is recovered from the farmers. At present, transport charges range between Rs 10 and 40 per kg, depending on the distance. This price is recovered from the farmers.As fuel prices rise by the day, experts have hinted that a similar upward trend is likely to be seen in the prices of everyday essentials. Prices of vegetables, which have remained steady throughout the summer, might see a 20-25 per cent rise if fuel price rise continues.At Pune and Pimpris wholesale markets, most of the vegetables have remained between the price range of Rs 10 and 40 per kg. A glut in production, as a result of almost 10 per cent increase in the area of production across the state, has resulted in the collapse of prices.Vegetables such as green peas, cauliflower, cabbage, carrot, et cetera are mostly trading in the range of Rs 10-15 per kg, which, traders said, is because of healthy arrivals. Tomato, in most wholesale markets, is trading at Rs 5-8 per kg, while in the retail markets the prices are about Rs 10-15 per kg. Onion prices, too, are at an all-time low, as a production glut has tilted the demand-supply ratio. However, as diesel prices are touching an all-time high, traders fear an imminent rise in the prices of vegetables.Vilas Bhujbal, president of the Traders and Commission Agents Association of Punes Gultekdi market, said the transporters have not taken the decision to increase prices as they were hopeful of a quick correction in the prices. However, if the present trend continues, a sharp increase in prices is likely, he said. Transporters act as a conduit between farmers and wholesale markets like Pune, to ferry perishable commodities like vegetables. Normally, these are village-level entrepreneurs who charge farmers per crate or per kg to transport their ware. For a market like Pune, transporters bring produce from neighbouring districts as well as from states like Karnataka, Kerala etc.At present, transport charges range between Rs 10 and 40 per kg, depending on the distance. This price is recovered from the farmers. Bhujbal said if fuel prices continue to rise, the transport charges may increase by 10-15 per cent immediately. This will effect the prices in the wholesale markets and, subsequently, the retail customer will get vegetables at a higher rate, he said. However, many growers said transporters have already effected a rise at their end.Deepak Bhise, president of the Tomato Growers Association of Junnar taluka in Pune district, said wholesale prices have but collapsed. As farmers, we have to use diesel for our tractors, our machines run on diesel. So, this is pinching us hard, he said.For all the latest Pune News, download Indian Express App"

K. Bellubbi, has held the Union government responsible for their state.Addressing presspersons here on Tuesday, he said that while onion prices have dipped to Rs. 800 per quintal in the market, prices never went below Rs. 1,500 per quintal during 10 years of the UPA government when Sharad Pawar was the Union Agriculture Minister.But today, the prices have gone too low in the market that the onion farmers are either dumping the commodity on the road or simply leaving it in their farms itself as they are unable to recover price of even transportation to the market let alone cost of cultivation, Mr. Bellubbi said.Claiming that a farmer is spending around Rs. 1,200 on producing each quintal of onion, he demanded that the Centre come to the rescue of farmers by announcing a Minimum Support of Price of Rs. 2,000 per quintal.Of that, the Centre should pay Rs. 1,800 while the State government could add Rs. 200 in the MSP for the farmers. This would help the farmers to earn some profit, he said.Mr. Bellubbi accused the Union government of only rendering lip services by doing nothing really for the welfare of farmers.In the last four years, Mr. Modi has only talked about farmers issues but never took any decision to help. They are upset and angry to the extent that if BJP national president, Amit Shah goes to meet the farmers, they would not hesitate even to thrash him, he said.He said that even the Pejawar seer has also expressed his unhappiness against the Modi government for not meeting promises such as bringing back black money from foreign banks. Stating that he would give a fortnight to the Union government to meet the demand of announcing Rs. 2,000 per quintal MSP for farmers, he said that the protest would be intensified if the demand is not met. Later in the day, he along with the party workers staged a protest by dumping onion on the road at M.G. Circle."

It can be consumed raw, cooked, dried or roasted. Besides being used as a food, it has a variety of medicinal properties too.Onions have been known to mankind since prehistoric times and have found mention in religious books like The Bible and The Koran. The medicinal properties of the herb have been described by the early Ayurveda exponents like Charak (in Charak Samhita) and Sushruta.In Chinese medicine, Onions have been used to treat cough, bacterial infection and breathing problems. Ancient Americans used wild Onions to treat cold, cough, asthma and to repel insects. In modern medicine, it is used to lower blood sugar, tackle cardiovascular problems, prevent hair loss, urinary disorders, tooth ache etc.In India, the largest Onion-producing state is Maharashtra, all though it is also grown widely in Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Bihar and Andhra Pradesh.In Bengal the production of Onions is not encouraging. The total cultivable area for Onions here is 0.3 lakh ha and production is 5.4 lakh tonnes whereas in Maharashtra the total cultivable land is 5.2 lakh ha and production is 65.3 lakh tonnes.However, realising the importance of Onions, Bengal has now started research and development at various agricultural science centres and universities to try and increase production.A full-grown bulbCultivationClimate and soil: The Onion is basically a cool season crop. But it can be grown under a wide range of climatic conditions such as tropical, sub-tropical and temperate climates. The best performance can be expected in mild weather, without extreme cold, heat or excessive rainfall.In order to meet consumers rising demand, to minimise import from other states and to stabilise the price of Onions, Bengal is now cultivating the herb during rainy season (kharif) as well as during rabi season. For this, various new varieties of Onions are being developed.Onions can be grown in all types of soil such as sandy loam, silt loam, clay loam and heavy soil. But the best soil for it is sandy loam with good drainage and moisture-holding capacity. It cannot be grown in alkaline or low lying marshy land.Varieties: Onions can be broadly divided into two groups  Common Onion and Multiplier Onion. The Common Onion group includes the typical bulb Onion whereas the multiplier Onion forms smaller bulbs. In this article we shall focus on growing Common Onions.It is important to select the right variety of Onion as per the season. Varieties suitable in the kharif season are Bhima Dark Red, Bhima Super, Bhima Raj, Bhima Red and Bhima Shubhra. For the rabi season Bhima Shakti, Bhima Kiran and Bhima Light are more suitable.Planting: Common Onions can be grown by raising seedlings in a nursery bed, by broadcasting (sprinkling seeds) or drilling seeds directly in the field. It can also be grown by planting bulbs directly in the field. As Onions are mainly planted using the transplanting method, production of healthy seedlings require a well-maintained nursery. This will ensure better seedlings.Prepare a nursery bed of 3m length and 0.6m breadth and raise it to a height of 15-25cm. Spare a distance of 70cm between the beds as you would need it eventually for deweeding. Generally a well-drained, fertile, loam to sandy loam, loose and friable soil, rich in organic matter is preferred for such a nursery bed.Onions, peeled and choppedSeeds are sown in lines, 4-5cm apart, in rabi, and 5-7cm apart in kharif settings. Sowing should not be done more than 2-3cm deep and after sowing, the beds should be mulched with dry grass or straw to maintain and preserve the required soil moisture.As and when there is lack of moisture in the bed, water it using a sprinkling can. After germination, the mulching material should be removed and when required, the nursery should be protected from heavy rains during kharif season.To protect seedlings from direct sun rays, partial shade should be provided. The seedlings will be ready for transplanting in six to seven weeks in kharif and eight to nine weeks in rabi seasons. Two to three days before uprooting the seedlings, ensure light irrigation. Onions can also be grown by direct seeding.In the next edition we shall discuss methods of irrigation and harvesting the herb. Onions are prone to attacks by weeds and so weed management shall be discussed too. To be continued"

KarthikeyanThe prices of shallots (small onion) shot up in the wholesale onion market in Dindigul  one of the biggest in the State  on Friday due to poor arrivals and slump in production.Continuous rain in major shallot producing centres in Karantaka has damaged the standing crop, leading to a fall in production.The wholesale price of shallot shot up to Rs. 50 a kg from Rs. 20 a kg in the last 48 hours. In retail markets, the price of shallot hovers around Rs. 60 to Rs. 65 a kg, depending on quality and size. The arrivals slumped to less than half of normal quantity, said traders.Any short supply automatically leads to a jump in the price of shallots, said V. Rajendran, a wholesale trader. If the trend continues, the price will go up further.Arrivals from Theni, Pollachi, Coimbatore, and Mysuru in Karnataka is almost nil due to heavy downpour during the last week. At present, onion farmers at Sengurichi, Gujiliamparai, Vedasandur and Iyyalur in Dindigul district and Thuraiyur in Tiruchi district alone are supplying to the wholesale market.Normally, the market gets regular supplies from Andipatti and Cumbum in Theni district, Udumalpet in Tirupur district, Tiruchi and Mysuru in Karnataka. Now, the entire market is dependent on arrivals from nearby villages.Several areas of Mysuru, Kollegal and adjoining places in Karnataka, which are popular for shallot cultivation, have been receiving heavy rain this month.At present, Dindigul market receives less than 2,000 bags, each weighing 80 kg, a day against 5,000 bags last week. Arrivals are around 5,000 to 8,000 bags a day and three to four truckloads during peak season.Several godowns in the wholesale market are empty. Exporters too have stayed away due to high procurement price. Above all, the fresh shallots are wet and, hence, they have limited shelf life and unfit for exports. However, traders hope to sell them domestically.Heavy rain in western parts of the region will certainly affect arrivals to the market in the days come, they fear. Increase in arrivals of domestically grown shallot alone will stabilise supply and price, they say."

5ce76762e8e3fc56af419304,BUAT agriculture scientists introduce high-yielding variety of onion,http://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2018/oct/30/buat-agriculture-scientists-introduce-high-yielding-variety-of-onion-1891683.html,2018-10-30,"Namita Bajpai ByExpress News ServiceLUCKNOW: There is a new ray of hope for the vegetable farmers of water deficient Bundelkhand region of Uttar Pradesh as an agriculture scientist of Banda University of Agriculture and Technology (BUAT) has introduced a rapidly growing and high-yielding variety of onion.This could also be counted as a step towards doubling the income of the farmers till 2022. The new variety is virtuous enough to help the farmers improve earnings as it has smaller gestation and a longer preservation period than any other regular variety of onion.It may be recalled that the agriculture scientists of BUAT had developed a dark red variety of onion which had proved to be a boon for onion growers of Bundelkhand region. Associate Professor, BUAT, Dr RK Singh calls this new variety Line-883. ""The crop of this variety gets ready in 83 days instead of 110-1120 days taken by regular onion varieties,"" said Dr Singh.He added that the yield is almost 20 per cent higher than the regular onion crop with 300-350 quintal per hectare as against 250-280 for normal varieties. ""We have tried to address the preservation issues as well. Usually, onion stays just for a month and gets sprouted at normal temperature but Line-833 can be preserved for over two and a half months without sprouting both at normal temperature and cold storage.Dr Singh has been conducting his experiments with the seeds of Line-833 in Bundelkhand region for the last two years.Before this, he had actually started his research on the new variety while being in Nasik National Horticulture Research and Development Foundation (NHRDF) a decade ago. Elaborating on its positives, Dr Singh explained that it took lesser time to grow as compared to the regular varieties. ""This is ready within 80-85 days against traditional 100-110 days of onion crop. Moreover, its level of endurance and resistance to disease is much higher than other onion varieties,"" he said.On his decision to introduce this variety to Bundelkhand onion growers, Dr Singh said was best-suited option for them as Bundelkhand was water deficient and the new variety grew to require a lesser amount of water while giving best results in Kharif season.However, he added that its seeds were used by over 400 farmers of different regions and states, including Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Bihar, Jharkhand Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan and Karnataka, on trial basis with exemplary results. Moreover, 15 farmers of Banda district have used the seed of Line 833 and got very good output, said BUAT authorities endorsing the variety. Explaining the technical aspect involved,Dr Singh claimed that in Bundelkhand region the sulphur content in the soil was higher than normal. ""Sulphur increases the activity of soil. For Line-833 sulphur rich soil is best suited so it will give outstanding results and can be a boon for Bundelkhand framers,"" said Dr Singh."
5ce735c7e8e3fc56af417ec4,onion prices are fluctuating,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/onion-prices-are-fluctuating/article25416194.ece,2018-11-04,"What is the problem?Onion prices peaked in mid-October in parts of the country on account of squeezed supplies from the key bulb-growing States, bringing to the fore the recurring price volatility of this vegetable which the country witnesses almost every alternate season.The wholesale onion prices at the Lasalgaon Agricultural Produce Market Committee  the countrys largest wholesale onion market in Maharasthra  ruled Rs. 22-23 a kg in mid-October on tight supplies as supply had dropped. Consequently, the retail prices jumped, and in the national capital New Delhi, the price hit Rs. 40 a kg, before the Union government reviewed the price and availability of onion and asked the Delhi government to make onion available through its public distribution system outlets as was done in 2015 when prices had spiked.Has supply dropped?Government data show production of onion has fallen marginally during the 2017-18 crop year that ended June 30. The third advance estimates say onion output is likely to be around 22 million tonnes during the reported period, lower than 22.4 million tonnes in 2016-17. However, compared to the average production of the past five years, it is about 12% higher.Traders point out that the supply of onions in the Lasalgaon market mainly dropped owing to a drought-like situation in parts of Maharashtra, where the onions Kharif crop is likely to be lower. However, they are hopeful that as the arrival from neighbouring Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh has started picking up, prices will moderate. Jaydutta Holkar, chairman of the Lasalgaon APMC, says supplies are gradually rising, and on October 31, the average wholesale price of the onion was around Rs. 10-11 a kg. Onion price surged only for a couple of days in mid-October but later as the arrival increased the price has dropped. However, those selling in the retail have kept the price up only to derive more profit..., he says.Traders and the government hope prices will moderate in the coming days as the supply is expected to improve as soon as the harvest begins in the onion-growing areas of Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Rajasthan.Why this recurring volatility?In India, onion prices are extremely volatile. While the production in the country over the years has been rising, sharp price spikes are experienced almost every alternate year. The key reasons for severe and frequent price shocks are attributed by agriculture experts to production fluctuations and changes in the nature of demand.The growth in onion production has risen from below 5.5 million tonnes till 2002-03 to nearly 20 million tonnes in recent years. Experts point out that the annual growth rate of above 13% in onion production since 2000-01 is phenomenal and no other food crop in the country shows this type of growth in the recent years.However, domestic and overseas demand for onion seems to be outpacing growth in supply, points out Professor Ramesh Chand, a member of the NITI Aayog. He says the per capita demand of onion has increased from 4 kg in 2002-03 to more than 13 kg in recent years. This growth in per capita demand for onion reflects a mind-boggling change in preference of Indian consumers for onion. It also implies that the effect of spikes in onion price on household budgets is getting heavier. It looks strange that increased availability is associated with the increase in price volatility rather than providing flexibility to absorb small shocks in supply, he says.What is in store?The price trends of onion over the years show that high prices prevail only for a few months and the excessive volatility can be managed through appropriate mechanisms. Professor Chand says a multi-pronged strategy involving technology, extension, public stocks, and market intelligence is needed to address excessive volatility. Stocking by public sector parastatal like the NAFED will also keep a check on exploitation and market manipulation by private trade, besides price stabilisation, he adds.Vikas Vasudeva"

In other parts of the State, farmers are being forced to sell their crop for Rs. 1/kg.Distressed, the farmers in Bagalkot district recently protested by throwing onions on the road and staging rasta roko. Similar agitations were held by farmers in Hubballi. The Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha, which also held a protest in Bengaluru on Monday, has demanded that the government announce a minimum support price (MSP) and open centres across the State for the purchase of onions.

One of these, say some traders, is the recent cyclone that hit southern parts of the country. They say that since huge quantities of onion are being transported to Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Kerala from Karnataka, the transportation was hit owing to the cyclone in these regions. The onion which was supposed to go out of the State, remained in Karnataka. Due to this, the prices dropped significantly.Other traders say that production being higher than the requirement has also led to a sharp decline in the market price.According to sources, while a quintal of onion was being sold at around Rs. 2,000 till a fortnight ago, it is now being sold at around Rs. 1,200 per quintal.The traders at Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) here say that the lower quality of onion which was actually sold for at least Rs. 800 per quintal, is now going for Rs. 300 per quintal.The traders and the farmers both admit that sharp decline in the market price results in loss only to farmers as they are the final stakeholders.Meanwhile, other traders believe that the situation is temporary as the market will pick up within a fortnight and prices will be stable enough to help get a better price for the farmers."

While Madhya Pradesh has introduced it only for foodgrains and oil seeds, Haryana has taken it up on an experimental basis for perishables.Notification issuedGoing by the volumes, Karnataka is the first State implementing the new system in a full-fledged manner for perishable commodity like onion, said Karnataka Agricultural Price Commission chairman T.N. Prakash Kammaradi. As per the KAPCs recommendations, the Karnataka government issued a notification on November 27 announcing the scheme for onion in the markets of Gadag, Bagalkot, Dharwad, and Belagavi districts from November 28 to December 12. Under the new system, the government has fixed the support price level for onion at Rs. 700 a quintal and the Price Deficiency Payment level at Rs. 200. This means that farmers get cash benefit of Rs. 200 if the onion price rules around Rs. 500 in the market. As the maximum benefit level is fixed at Rs. 200. The scheme is expected to cost Rs. 50 crore to Rs. 75 crore, which would be used from a revolving fund.The Price Deficiency Payment system is being implemented with 16 conditions that include getting verification regarding crop details from a committee of top officers at the entrance of the APMC, selling only to registered traders, verification of the quantum of produce by officials of weights and measurements, keeping track of onion-laden vehicles that go out of the APMC yards, and noting down their destinations, etc.According to Dr. Kammaradi, the new system is one of the options for quick response during price crash. It will take a minimum of one month under the conventional market intervention scheme of direct procurement by government as various clearances will have to be obtained. But it is possible to begin the scheme within a day under the Price Deficiency Payment method because the State has already introduced a digitalised system of collecting real-time data of arrivals and prices in markets, he said.Also, under the conventional direct procurement scheme, disposing the procured crop is an issue as it has to be stored till there is a demand for it in the market.Bailing out farmersOnion price has crashed in wholesale marketsPrice Deficiency Payment system will apply to markets in Gadag, Bagalkot, Dharwad, and Belagavi districts from November 28 to December 12"

Maruthi, Joint Director, State Mid Day Meal Scheme, maintained that not including onion and garlic in the meals is a violation of the memorandum of understanding signed between the government and Akshaya Patra.In a statement on Tuesday, the foundation said in its defence: It is our constant endeavour to contribute to the governments efforts in promoting good health and nutrition among children.Speaking to The Hindu , Kulashekara Chaitanya Dasa, senior executive, ISKCON, said, The MHRD has set some regulatory norms in serving food to children, which the Akshaya Patra Foundation has been meeting. The food needs to be nutritious, balanced and have the necessary calorific value. Our meals meet these criteria. All the quality measures and controls are in place. We substitute onion and garlic with other equally nutritious vegetables.Ready to rectify where necessaryStating that the government cannot dictate what ingredients should go into meals, he said, The government can do a comparative study of the food prepared by Akshaya Patra and other NGOs, and tell us what is lacking. We are ready to rectify them. But, they cannot tell us what to put in the food.However, Mr. Maruthi said, As per the MoU, all the mid-day meal providers must include onion and garlic in the food on all days, except Thursday. He added that officials of the Karnataka Food Commission had inspected many schools served by Akshaya Patra and found that children where not eating enough due to lack of taste. A notice was sent to the Foundation in mid-November asking Akshaya Patra to abide by the MoU, he added.The MHRD has set some regulatory norms...

And this despite the Centre allocating large sums for several schemes to boost farmer incomes. So what went wrong? TOI takes a look at the stress points hurting the sector.Two successive years of drought (2014, 2015) have taken a toll on the farm sector. The government has allocated significant funds for the sector but slow implementation of projects has not eased the pain. Drought in Maharashtra, Gujarat and Karnataka have also added to farmers woes.Prices have collapsed for farm commodities. Low international prices have meant exports have been hit while imports have hurt prices at home. For example, there was a bumper production of pulses in 2016-17 but imports of nearly 6.6 million tonnes arrived, compounding the problem. In 2017-18, another 5.6 million tonnes flowed in, depressing domestic prices further. The government delayed imposing tariffs on imports, which heightened the problem of prices for farmers. According to a Niti Aayog paper, on average, farmers do not realise remunerative prices due to limited reach of the minimum support prices (MSP) and an agricultural marketing system that delivers only a small fraction of the final price to the actual farmer.The Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana was launched in 2016 to provide insurance and financial support to farmers in the event of failure of any crops due to natural calamities, pests and diseases. It was also meant to stabilise the income of farmers and ensure they remain in farming. But the scheme has seen lower enrolments due to a string of factors, including high premiums and lack of innovation by insurance firms.Irrigation is crucial for the farm sector, where large tracts of land still depend on monsoon rains. The Centre launched the Rs 40,000-crore Long-Term Irrigation Fund, operated by the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (Nabard). Under this programme, 99 large irrigation projects were to be completed by December 2019 but the progress so far has been limited. Experts say a number of factors, including bureaucratic delays and slow implementation by states, have hurt progress for this crucial input.According to a Niti Aayog document, farm sector development has ignored the potential of marketing. Archaic laws still hobble the sector. Access of farmers to well-developed markets remains an issue although several initiatives have been launched to develop an electronic market place. Reforms to the APMC Act have been slow and most states have dragged their feet on it. Experts suggest an entity such as the GST Council to bring together states and the Centre to jointly take decisions to reform the sector and provide better access to markets for farmers. According to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the combination of market regulations and infrastructure deficiencies leads to a price depressing effect on the sector.Introduction of latest technology has been limited due to a number of reasons. Access to modern technology could act as a boost to productivity through improved variety of seeds, farm implements and farming technology. According to a Niti Aayog paper, there has been no real technological breakthrough in recent times.Large gaps in storage, cold chains and limited connectivity have added to the woes of farmers. It has also added to the significant post-harvest losses of fruit and vegetables, estimated at 4% to 16% of the total output, according to the OECD.This has meant that there is little incentives for farmers to diversify. According to an OECD document, share of high-value sectors in food processing is low with fruit, vegetable and meat products accounting for 5% and 8% of the total value of output compared to cerealbased products at 21% and oilseeds at 18%A government-appointed panel had recommended that FCI hand over all procurement operations of wheat, paddy and rice to states that have gained sufficient experience in this regard and have created reasonable infrastructure for procurement. These states are Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh. It had suggested a complete overhaul of FCI and recommended that farmers be given direct cash subsidy (of about Rs 7000/ha) and fertiliser sector deregulated. The panel had said direct cash subsidy to farmers will go a long way to help those who take loans from money lenders at exorbitant interest rates to buy fertilisers or other inputs, thus relieving some distress in the agrarian sector. The report has been put in cold storage.The share of the farm sector in GDP has declined from 29% in 1990 to about 17% in 2016, but it remains a major source of employment. According to OECD data, 85% of operational land holdings are less than 2 hectares and account for 45% of the total cropped area. Only 5% of farmers work on land holding larger than 4 hectares, according to the Agricultural Census, 2016. Productivity lags other Asian economies such as China, Vietnam and Thailand and average yields are low compared to other global producers. Wheat and rice yields are nearly 3 times lower than world yields while those for mango, banana, onion or potato are between 2 and 7 times lower than the highest yields achieved globally, according to the OECD."

The Telegraph file picturePublic health experts on Thursday wrote to the Centre seeking termination of the contracts of a non-government agency that they said provided midday meals to schoolchildren across 12 states but kept eggs, onion and garlic off the menu for religious reasons.The agency their letter to the Union human resource development ministry referred to is Akshay Patra, which provides midday meals to over 1.76 million children in 14,700 schools.The Jan Swasthya Abhiyan (Peoples Health Movement) and the Right to Food Campaign have expressed concern that the agencys decision to keep eggs out of its meals reflects a religious diktat.In their letter, they have highlighted that the ministrys guidelines on midday meals, issued last year, specify that no organisation supplying the meals should use the programme to propagate any religious practice.The health groups have argued that the inclusion of eggs can help children from the economically disadvantaged communities, who on average show a higher prevalence of under-nutrition and stunting than children from non-disadvantaged communities.The practice of keeping eggs out uses a religious preference to deny a high-nutrition-value food to children who would otherwise eat them, Sylvia Karpagam, a public health physician in Bangalore and member of the Abhiyan, told The Telegraph.Akshay Patra, in a statement emailed to this newspaper, said its freshly cooked meals are in compliance with the nutrition norms prescribed by the HRD ministry.A spokesperson for the agency declined to comment on the issue of eggs, onion or garlic.In their letter, the health experts have cited the nutritional constituents of eggs and stressed that the National Institute of Nutrition, Hyderabad, recommends at least three eggs a week for children. Parents, civil society and children in several states have demanded eggs, the letter said.What were fighting for is the right of local communities to exercise their own food choices, said Vandana Prasad, a paediatrician, community health expert and member of the Abhiyan and the Public Health Resource Network.Members of the Abhiyan and the Right to Food Campaign said the immediate provocation for the letter was the agencys refusal to introduce onion and garlic in its midday meals as demanded by the Karnataka government.They said the standoff between the agency and the Karnataka government highlighted the position of rights-based campaigns that midday meals should be locally prepared and culturally relevant, and not provided by agencies that limit food on the basis of religious beliefs."

Nashik farmers will boycott it,"" said Sanjay Sathe, the onion farmer who had sent the PMO a money order of Rs 1,064, his earnings from the sale of 750 quintals of onions.The farmers demanded at least Rs 800 per quintal for all onion growers. ""Moreover, the grant should continue till the average wholesale onion prices crosses Rs 1,000 per quintal in the wholesale market,"" a farmer said.The state cabinet on Thursday approved a Rs 150 crore budget to enable the payment of Rs 200 per quintal. ""The decision will be applicable in the case of all onions sold between November 1 and December 15 in all the APMC markets except Navi Mumbai. The maximum relief will be given on 200 quintals of onion sold for a farmer, which means the distressed farmer will at least get Rs 40,000 amount in their account,"" said a senior official from the marketing department.Onion farmers have been protesting since November over the low price their produce has been fetching.The average rate of kharif onions in the market was between Rs 750 and Rs 850, compared to between Rs 2,200 and Rs 2,300 last year.Several reasons have been given for the crash, from hoarding of summer onions to reduced demand from nearby states like MP and Karnataka. In the 45 days from November 1 to December 15, 75 lakh quintals of onion were brought to AMPCs across the state. Farmers who sent these onions are eligible for relief.The farmer fraternity said not many had sold onions between November 1 and December 15 since the prices were crashing. A farmer from Ahmednagar district , Shreyas Abhale, had sent a money order of Rs 6 to CM Devendra Fadnavis after selling 2,657 kg of onions at a rate of Rs 1 per kg at the Sangamner wholesale market. He had said that after adjusting market expenses, he was left with only Rs 6.In a related development, over 300 onion farmers staged a three-hour sit-in agitation at the Nampur Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) in Satana taluka of the district on Thursday. The farmers were unhappy that the traders were not giving them sale receipt after buying the produce at a paltry amount of Rs 1 per kg."

ShutterstockThe slump in onion prices is turning out to be a major concern for the Narendra Modi-government, which has doubled the export incentives to 10 per cent to boost shipments and ensure better returns for farmers.The government on Friday increased the export incentives under the Merchandise Exports from India Scheme (MEIS) to 10 per cent from the existing 5 per cent in the interests of farmers, an official statement said.This will result in better prices for onions in the domestic market. Wholesale prices of onions are subdued at present because of the increase in the arrival of the fresh crop at the mandis, it said.Rewards under the scheme are payable as a percentage of realised free-on-board value and an MEIS duty credit scrip can be transferred or used for payment of a number of duties, including the basic customs duty.In recent weeks, farmers have been blocking highways and dumping onions as the prices have slumped to about Rs 1 per kg in the wholesale markets even though it takes around Rs 8 to produce a kg of the bulb crop. Maharashtra produces more than 30 per cent of the countrys annual onion crop, followed by Karnataka. Onion is usually cultivated four times a year  early kharif, kharif, early rabi and rabi.Onions comprise less than one per cent in terms of value of the countrys agricultural production."
