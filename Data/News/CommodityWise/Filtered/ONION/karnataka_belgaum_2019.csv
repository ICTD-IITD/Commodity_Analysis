Track live election results , the big trends and fastest updates on counting day with India's largest news network.NEW DELHI: At the time when indications are that the Centre is devising a financial package to quickly address the issue of farm distress, the agriculture ministry has stepped up efforts to roll out some new measures. It includes setting up 24 clusters for tomatoes, onions and potatoes (TOP) and initiating an exercise to have an exclusive ""trade map"" for these three high priority produce.The idea behind the move is to enhance value realisation of these perishable horticultural produce by farmers. It will happen through targeted interventions and linking the farmers with both domestic and international markets.""The TOP's trade map, being prepared by the ministry, will have all the details (varieties, price trend, buyers, sellers and processors) which may help in price and demand forecasting. We have been in touch with experts in Scotland, Russia and other countries to compile round the year data on buyers and producers,"" said an official.He said such basic moves would directly help lakhs of farmers in the exclusive TOP clusters in Maharashtra , Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Gujarat , Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and West Bengal ""Tomato, onion and potato clusters will be set up for agricultural processing under the TOP scheme. Focus on price and demand forecasting will enable farmers to choose which crop to sow in order to maximise benefit,"" said Union agriculture minister Radha Mohan Singh.He told TOI on Monday that these efforts and all the other measures, taken by the government in the past over four years, would go a long way in addressing farmers' concerns. ""The success of the government's plan and policies is reflected in record production of food-grains and horticultural produce in 2017-18,"" said Singh.The government is meanwhile, working on various proposals to extend financial help to farmers. Such proposals include waiving off interest for farmers who repay crop loans on time to providing income support for meeting input costs and lowering premium of existing crop insurance schemes.The TOP had got the government's focus when it announced 'Operation Greens' with an outlay of Rs 500 crore in its 2018-19 budget. It's aim is to stabilise supply of tomatoes, onions and potatoes and ensure their availability throughout the country round the year without price volatility.""Exclusive clusters for TOP, on the other hand, will help farmers in realising better prices through its linkages with markets,"" said A K Singh, deputy director general, Horticultural Science and Crop Science Divisions of the ICAR.He said, ""Increase in processing capabilities and setting up of a market intelligence network under the scheme to collect and collate real-time data on demand and supply will help farmers in a big way.""At present, farmers have to dump their produce on the streets or sell it at throwaway prices in case of bumper production as they don't have access to adequate processing facilities.

2019-01-05,"Fall Armyworm, an invasive pest, has destroyed about 15,303 hectares of maize crop in the district, Collector K.Rajamani said here on Friday. He said a report had been sent to the government in this regard.The crop has been raised on 15,379 ha in eight taluks, including Pullampadi, Manachanallur, Thuraiyur, Uppilliyapuram and Vaiyampattai, and the pest has destroyed almost the entire cultivated area. Fall armyworm ( Spodoptera frugiperda) was first reported in the country a few months back in Karnataka and Telangana, following which the Indian Council for Agricultural Research sounded an alert. The pest spreads fast and attacks have been reported in Karur and Tiruchi districts. Farmers in Tiruchi district have been demanding compensation for the damage.Speaking at the monthly farmers grievance day meeting, Mr. Rajamani said based on demand from farmers, steps were being taken to get compensation from the government as a special case.A sum of Rs. 1 crore had been released as an initial allotment to the district for being disbursed as compensation to farmers whose coconut trees were damaged during Cyclone Gaja. The compensation had been disbursed to 1,121 farmers in Tiruverumbur, Srirangam, Manapparai and Marungapuri taluks. The government also made an initial allotment of Rs. 1.68 crore for being disbursed as compensation to farmers whose horticultural crops were damaged in the cyclone. The money would be deposited in the bank accounts of the affected farmers within the next few months.Agriculture crops on about 228 hectares and horticulture crops on 2,331 ha had been damaged in the cyclone and the district administration sought Rs. 2.21 crore to be disbursed as compensation for damaged agricultural crops and Rs. 3.41 crore for damaged horticultural crops.Steps would be taken to get the remaining sum and disburse the compensation to all affected farmers soon, he added.Speaking on the issue, R. Raja Chidambaram, State secretary, Tamizhaga Vivasayigal Sangam, sought adequate compensation for maize farmers, whose crops have been damaged by the pest attack, and small onion (shallots) growers whose crops have been damaged due to frost. As per an earlier announcement by the Union government, compensation can be given to all crops if the loss was more than 33%, he said.P. Viswanathan, president, Tamizhaga Eri Mattrum Attru Pasana Vivasayigal Sangam, demanded sanction of Rs. 25,000 an acre for farmers whose maize and small onion crops have been damaged.Earlier, a cross-section of the farmers staged a demonstration in front of the Collectors Office condemning Karnatakas attempts to build a dam across the Cauvery at Mekedatu.Responding to a plea from Puliyur A.Nagarajan, president, Farmers Wing of Tamil Maanila Congress, Mr. Rajamani said that a causeway would be built soon across the Kollidam river at Mukkombu to enable villagers and farm workers on the North bank of the river to cross over.He also disclosed that Annawari certificates would be issued to farmers in cyclone affected areas by tahsildars to enable them get their bank loans rescheduled.

2019-01-06,"The Karnataka governments midday meal programme in schools has run into controversy with one of its NGO partners in the mammoth welfare exercise, International Society for Krishna Consciousnesss subsidiary Akshaya Patra Foundation (APF), refusing to include onion and garlic in cooking.Following this, the State government has not yet signed the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to continue the programme with APF that supplies food to 4.49 lakh students in government and government-aided schools through its centralised kitchens in several cities.In Bengaluru alone, it provides meals to 1.83 lakh students across 1,212 schools.In November, the Department of Primary and Secondary Education directed the foundation to include onion and garlic in the noon meal and start supplying hot milk instead of cold milk to the students. While the foundation has started supplying hot milk to some schools on a pilot basis, it has categorically said it will not add onion and garlic.Why does it matter?An official of the State Food Commission said it had received complaints about students skipping the midday meals as they did not like the taste of the food without onion and garlic, which are an integral part of the food culture among most communities.Children skipping meals is worrying because malnutrition is a serious issue. According to the National Family Health Survey 4 (NFHS) data for Karnataka (2015-2016), 36.2% of the children below the age of five are stunted, while 26.1% are wasted. The survey also reveals that 10.5% of the children were severely wasted, while 35.2% are underweight.The Central Food Technological Research Institute has sent a report to the Department based on its earlier research findings that both onion and garlic were found to enhance the bioaccessibility of iron and zinc from grain.But the institute has stated that during its survey across 270 schools in Mysuru district between January and May 2017, it found the average calorific value of the meals supplied by the APF was more than a school-cooked meal. The APF has said in a statement that its cooked meals are in compliance with the nutritional norms prescribed by the Ministry of Human Resource Development.What is the governments stand?Principal Secretary S.R. Umashankar said a final call would be taken after considering the feedback from students and teachers. The APF has had a series of meeting with several stakeholders, including officials of the State Food Commission and the Education Department. The government will have to either accept the dietary norms of APF or make alternative arrangements for supplying food.Are health activists worried?Around 145 health activists, experts and citizens, who are part of the Right to Food Campaign and the Jan Swasthya Abhiyan, have written to the Ministry of Human Resource Development and the Chief Minister, stating that children are eating less as they find the food bland.Sylvia Karpagam, a public health doctor and researcher who is one of the signatories, argued for cooking culturally appropriate food in de-centralised kitchens.Activists have also demanded that eggs be served as part of the midday meals as it is a good source of protein. They want the contract with the APF terminated, and meals prepared by self-help groups and other community-based organisations in accordance with nutritional norms and cultural practices, using fresh local produce.Veena Shatrugna, a clinical nutritionist and former Ddeputy Director of the National Institute of Nutrition, said, Normally, phytates and oxalates found in vegetarian diets precipitate iron and zinc and prevent their absorption from the gut. Onion and garlic appear to enhance absorption of these minerals. This is significant, she pointed out, because around 50% to 70% of children in India are anaemic.Tanu Kulkarni
