Hence, there was no scope for onion export. In fact, it almost like an unannounced ban on onion export. Moreover, the scarcity of onions was also one of the major reasons that led to decline in onion export during the first half of the current financial year.""Patil said, ""The unseasonal rain and hail had badly damaged the summer onion crop during February and March that led to scarcity of onions. The lack of export quality of onions also led to decline in exports.""There is no harvest of onions during April to mid-October. The summer crop, which is harvested in February and March and has a shelf life of six months, caters to the market until arrival of fresh kharif crop by mid-October. But the damage of crops led to scarcity of onions leading to a decline in onion export.The onion prices had increased a lot during August and September. An average wholesale onion prices had recorded an all-time high of Rs 5,700 a quintal at Lasalgaon APMC on August 22. The central government had immediately hiked the MEP of onions from 425 US dollars to 700 US dollars per tonne.Patil added, ""The supply of Kharif onion crop has increased at the mandis. The government has removed the MEP of onions so there is scope for export of onions in next three months. Around 3 lakh tonnes of onions are expected to be exported during the last quarter (Jan-March) of the current financial year."""

Marathi was his favourite subject at school. However, his schooling came to an abrupt halt two years ago, when he was diagnosed with leprosy. Since then, physiotherapy and mild electric shocks became part of his daily regimen. The plaster on his left hand is changed every alternate day.I am used to the electric shocks now, he says with a grin. There was another rude shock in store for him when his father passed away last Diwali. I had gone home for the festival. After fathers demise, my mothers visits became less frequent. My brothers come to meet me sometimes. They ask me when I would return home, he says.Despite the adversities, Yogesh has a reason to be excited about. After two years of treatment at the Vimala Dermatological Centre in Andheri, June will see him resume school in Boisar, reunite with his siblings and friends and reclaim his old life.While he cant forget those early, confusing days when the first signs of leprosy began to manifest  a tingling sensation in his hands which soon lost all sensation  he is looking forward to living life on his terms again. Now, I can write easily. At the Centre, we pass time playing ludo and carrom. I am able to hold the striker and flick it too, he says.Fear and loathingLeprosy, a disease mostly prevalent in Asia and Africa, has long been looked upon with disgust and fear due to the physical degeneration and deformities. The number of cases has come down, but leprosy of the mind is still there. It is a visible disease. India has the highest number of leprosy patients followed by Brazil. Acceptability of leprosy patients should improve. The disease is non-contagious, non-hereditary and completely curable, says Narayan Iyer, CEO and national coordinator at NGO Indian Development Foundation. The Vimala Centre is one of its projects.The centre mostly admits patients at an acute stage of deformity or ulceration, entailing in-house treatment of up to six months or longer. Several patients treated here over the years are leading fulfilling lives despite all odds, but societal stigma clings on.Misconceptions about the disease are rife, points out Mr Iyer. In certain parts of the country, when patients die and are buried, their bodies are exhumed and left out in the open as the disease regarded as evil. Thats the level of superstition.Sandeep Gupta (name changed), 52, still lives with it, nearly 40 years after being cured. While his day job provides for his wife and 12-year-old daughter, he recalls how he fled to another metro in the 1970s to protect his Mumbai-based joint family from the humiliation they would face on his account.There is a saying that goes: chand me daag hona chahiye, khandaan me daag nahi hona chahiye (the moon can have dark spots, but the family cannot be blemished), Mr Gupta says.Before leprosy, I had small pox, so my leprotic condition was not visible. Although some relatives knew about it, they kept it confidential and were supportive. However, they were happy when I left for the familys sake. Though I have returned to Mumbai, I dont stay with my brothers. You can care for your family from afar. Those who love their families, leave, he adds. While working among others like him in Mumbais slums, he found his uncle, aunt, mother and sister among them.He says there are many, even those from educated and well-to-do families, who have left home. The revulsion and discrimination by people leave deep scars, he adds. People will walk at a distance. Sometimes, as I have experienced myself, people on the bus will get up if you sit next to them. Awareness programmes have made a big difference in changing antiquated attitudes, but our society has a long way to go. If people dont treat us like human beings, they should at least not repudiate us and react as if they have seen a devil. This hurts the most. This is against humanity. Transgenders, leprosy patients and widows are neglected. The society only knows to break their hearts, Mr Gupta says.The local heroBeyond the grey-blue compound walls of Vimala Centre, few would know that Ganpat Vaidya, 72, who totters on his walker with clawed hands and legs bearing marks of acute ulcers, is known as a hero for his fastidiousness about personal hygiene. He dismisses the sobriquet as bhankas (nonsense), but his printed blue shirt and clean white trousers spell a certain lifestyle.I wash my clothes, he says, adding he dislikes any attempt to help him with the MCR (Micro Cellular Rubber) footwear. He can hold a chapati, but needs a spoon for rice. Movement is slow and difficult and he needs to be helped to bed. Memories of earlier life elude Mr Vaidya, and poor eyesight ensures can hardly make sense of the present. The whole day, I just sit around. I cannot go out, he says.Ironically, his hands were once the most exercised part of his body. Mr Vaidya was an artisan, who crafted gold jewellery at a shop owned by his cousin. While working the metal, he realised at one point that he couldnt feel the occasional burns. When he applied a hot onion to a boil on the sole of his foot, he felt nothing. His legs began to swell and then his fingers, but again, there was no sensation.At the centre, Mr Vaidya makes brooms and sometimes does a bit of sweeping. After his brother died, he has no immediate family, and his nephews never visit. No one comes. If it was not for Sister, I dont know where I would be, he says, unable to hold back tears.A life less ordinarySister Bertilla Capra, a 77-year-old Italian nun from the Missionary Sisters of the Immaculate is the driving force at the centre. For the last 45 years, she has made India her home, treating and caring for leprosy patients.A nurse by profession, she has also trained as a mid-wife. Sister Bertilla came to Andhra Pradesh in 1972 after undergoing a 40-day special training for leprosy care in Spain. After working in the southern State for nearly a decade, she came to Mumbai in 1981 and has stayed in the city since then.She thinks Indian leprosy patients have a spiritual approach to the disease, which helps them cope better with it. They are willing to accept their situation as they think it is part of their spiritual culture. They are ready to tolerate it as an act of god. They dont show their suffering or lament about their condition. They edify you for the help, she says.In a blow to leprosy patients under her care, the Indian government has recently decided to not extend her visa, citing a change in rules. She is currently on a provisional visa that expires on February 4. The Union government has conveyed their decision through two letters, the latest on December 23.It is a blow I never expected. No reason was given for the decision. If I were young I would have said bye bye. But I am 77. The people here have become a part of my life. It would be difficult for me to be separated from the people here, she says.The sense of hurt at this sudden turn of events is palpable. The service I do here gives me happiness. I have spent my life with the patients here. I am happy to live with them. This satisfaction is not easy to remove from my life and my heart, Sister Bertilla says.Sister Bertilla was granted a residential visa from 1970 to 1990, and then five-year multiple-entry visas for the next two decades till 2010. Then, the rules changed again and she had to extend her visa every year. She has just returned from a trip to Delhi, where she sought help from heads of Catholic bodies and government officials.Unravelled tiesThe mention of Sister Bertilla is enough to evoke emotional reactions from patients at the Centre. She cared for me much more than my family ever did. I had nowhere to go, so she kept me here. In this place, they do not snub you, says Kalavati Mhatre, as tears well up in her eyes. After spending 35 years here, this sprightly 60-year-old is perhaps one of centres oldest residents, and her energy is contagious as she smiles and hugs everyone who comes to meet her.She prominently wears all the signs of a Maharashtrian Hindu married woman  green and gold bangles on both wrists, a mangalsutra and red tikli (dot)  but there has been no sign of her husband or her two daughters and son, or her grandchildren.Since my children were little when I got this disease, they were never brought to the centre. My husband visited a couple of times and then stopped coming. A relative who used to visit passed away recently. No one has come to see me in all these years. The only memory I have of my children is from when they were little. I dont know how they look now, she says.Before leprosy took over her life, Ms Mhatre worked the fields in her hometown of Uran. Those days are a distant memory now, and she has learnt to take her familys apathy in her stride and move on.Earlier, I would miss them and cry a lot, but Sister told me to forget my children. She said I had other children to take care of, the ones who were admitted here. I have never thought of going back to Uran. If my family does not ask after me, why should I bother? This centre is my family. Sister Tessy is my mother as well as my daughter, she says, pointing to a nun who has just walked into the room.Apart from clawed fingers, Ms Mhatre has developed the foot drop syndrome  a muscular weakness or paralysis which makes it difficult to lift the front part of the foot and toes. Her mutilated feet are swaddled in bandages, which have to be changed every alternate day after applying ointment. This effectively rules out walking.Creating familyA deep sense of desolation engulfs elderly patients, for whom turning back the clock to a time with family and friends is difficult. For the younger ones, like Sona Sharma, rehabilitation in society is easy and less traumatic.Distanced from her family in Andhra Pradesh, Ms Sharma created one of her own. The 30-year-old is a proud mother of a seven-month-old baby and lives in a room on Madh Island with her husband Rajkumar, a leprosy survivor who works as a security guard at the centre.In 2010, after she had spent five years at the Centre, Sister Bertilla asked Ms Sharma if she would like to marry Rajkumar. The wedding took place at a Ram temple in Versova, and Sister Bertilla arranged for a room for the young couple to help them begin their married life.Everything has turned out well only because of her blessings. Otherwise,where would I be? she says. Each morning, she leaves her baby in her sisters care, takes an auto and then a ferry to reach the centre by 8 am, where she works fulltime as a cleaner. On occasion, her hands attract odd glances. They look at my hands, but never say anything, she adds.Together, the couple make Rs 15,000 a month. With regular physiotherapy, Ms Sharma can hold and lift most things, but not small objects like a needle. Earlier, she would ask her family members to visit her. When they did not come, I stopped calling them, she says. Though she never went to school, she vows to give a different life to her son. We will educate our boy. We wont let him be like us, she says.A new beginningIts Friday  a day for skin OPD at Vimala Centre. Long queues stretch in front of the office and clinic. Some patients will be given medicines and sent home, while some may have to be admitted if diagnosed with acute leprosy.When we started in 1980, India had 40 lakh cases. Due to the countrywide awareness programmes by the government, reporting of cases went up, says Mr Iyer.According to data with the government-run National Leprosy Eradication Programme, 1,25,785 new cases were detected in India in 2014-2015. In Maharashtra, 16,415 new cases were detected in the same year.Christmas and New Year decorations from celebrations a few days ago are still intact, and long strips of crepe paper run through the trees in the compound, while the stars and baubles remind you of the festive cheer that had enveloped this place. After all, deformed bodies need not extend to the spirit.Indians dont show their suffering or lament about their condition. They edify you for the helpSister Bertilla CapraVimala CentreThe centre mostly admits patients at an acute stage, entailing in-house treatment of 6 months or longer"

Express Lasalgaon, Asias largest onion market, has seen a steady fall in the prices in the last few days. ExpressOVER A month after the central government decided to slash the minimum export price (MEP) of onion to zero, prices of the bulb have started hitting rock bottom across major market yards in the state. Increased arrival and limited avenues for sales has pushed the prices down. Market watchers say it would continue to remain so for the next fortnight or so.On Saturday, the modal price fetched by the bulb at the Lasalgaon market  the largest onion market in the state  was Rs 1100 per quintal. A total of 20,940 quintals of onions arrived at the market. A year ago on January 30, 2015, the modal price at Lasalgaon was Rs 1375 per quintal and 16,269 quintals arrived at the market.Manmad, another major onion market in Nashik district, saw 12,000 quintals of onions arriving and the modal price of the commodity was Rs 950 per quintal. The market at Manmad a year back had seen 11,472 quintals of onions arrive and the modal price of the bulb was Rs 1275 per quintal. In accordance with the trend at the wholesale markets, the retail markets have also seen a price correction of onion.Vishnu Salve, president of the Pimpri Vegetable Market, said the price of onion over the last few weeks had been between Rs 10-15 per kg. The arrival has increased, so prices have fallen, he said.The dip in the prices of onion comes at a time when the arrival of the late kharif crop is in full swing across market committees in the state and the country. Harvested between December and January, the late kharif crop feeds the market till the arrival of the rabi onion in March  April. This year, the state has seen a record sowing of onion on over 3 lakh hectares and the productivity is also supposed to be record breaking.Last month, the central government had decided to reduce the Minimum Export Price (MEP) of onions to zero to stop the price slide. December had seen the MEP being corrected twice before that. The central government had reduced the MEP to $400.However, the price slide now shows that slashing of MEP to 0 has no effect on the market. Nanasaheb Patil, chairman of the Lasalgaon Market committee, said that the governments decision came too late. There were reports of record sowing and a bumper crop was expected. MEP should have been reduced right at the start of the season. With arrival slated to remain high over the next fortnight, we do not expect any price rise in the markets, he said. Patil also said that the size of area of sowing rabi onions had increased. In Ahmednagar, Patil said, many farmers had decided to grow onions instead of cane. Water being a scarce commodity, onion cultivation has more appeal for farmers than cane. The summer crop of onion would be good this time, he said.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

The harvest of kharif crops is in full swing that has led to rise arrivals of onions in the market. This is the reason the onion prices have declined from Rs 2,300 per quintal in November to Rs 950 per quintal today.""The official said""The shelf life of kharif onions is less than a month and they gets rotten thereafter. Hence, farmers can't store kharif onions and have no option but sell the commodity in the market at the prevailing market rates. The rainy seasons delayed by two months that also delayed the onion plantation. The onion plantation in the district was at the same time after revival of monsoon in September last year. Hence, the harvest of onions also taking place at the same time. The rise in arrivals of onions has led to decline in average wholesale onion prices at Lasalgaon.""The minimum and maximum prices at Lasalgaon were recorded at Rs 500 and Rs 1,282 per quintal on Saturday. Around 15,000 quintals of onions were auctioned at Lasalgaon on Saturday.The average wholesale onion prices had skyrocketed to all time high of Rs 5,700 per quintal on August 22 due to scarcity of onions. The onion prices in retail market of Mumbai and Delhi had touched Rs 100 per kg in the last week of August, while it had touched Rs 80 per kg in Nashik's retial market. But the prices reversed after arrival of Kharif crop increased from November onwards."

Patil, who is also on the board of directors of NAFED, said it was a welcome move as last year NAFED had taken the decision to procure onions only in March and the procurement process started in May.The prices are down this year causing great distress to farmers. The decision of bodies like NAFED to increase their procurement will hopefully help in stabilising and increasing the price of onions in the coming months, he said.Prices of the bulb at the Lasalgaon Market over the last few days have been dwindling with excess arrival plaguing the market.On Thursday, the modal price fetched at the Lasalgaon market was Rs 900 per quintal with 16,000 quintals of the bulb arriving at the market.Last year, on the same day, 22,793 quintals of onion had arrived at the market and the modal price of the bulb was Rs 1,470 per quintal. Over the last month or so, prices have dipped by over Rs 300 per quintal. The failure of the government to reduce the Minimum Export Price (MEP) in time, Patil said, has resulted in the current scenario.Harvest of rabi onions will start in the next 15 days. In all probability, NAFED will start procuring onion only in March or April. Last year, the modal price was above Rs 16 and so procurement had become costly. However, this year the prices are subdued and the increased procurement will increase the price and stop slide for rabi onions, he said.Maharashtra produces around 60 per cent of the rabi onions in the country which feeds the markets till September- October as this is the only onion which can be stored.However, the present slide, Dipak Chavan, commodity analyst with Farm Features services, said, will take a toll on the total onion production in the county. Around 20-30 per cent of rabi onion is sown in the North Indian states and the sowing activity happens quite late. The price slide in the commodity will certainly effect that sowing, he said.Chavan also said that even in rabi onions many farmers have gone for the short duration one which would be hitting the markets soon as they are perishable.The area under cultivation for non-perishable rabi onion has been hit and the effects would be be seen later during the year, he concluded.For all the latest Cities News, download Indian Express App"

Of the total 133 hectares (332 acres) land, the wine park had been developed on 83 hectares (208 acres). As only five wineries became operational in the wine park, the industries had demanded the government to allow food processing units on the remaining 50 hectares (125 acres).During an industrial exhibition in April last year, Nashik-based industrial associations had approached state industries minister Subhash Desai with their demand. Desai too had given positive response to the industrial associations. Accordingly, the MIDC gave approval in September for allowing industries to set up food processing units at Vinchur.Now, the MIDC is in the process of developing infrastructure such as roads, water supply and streetlights among others and is also conducting a survey for the purpose. The infrastructure is expected to be developed within the next six months."

Despite this, India exports only 43,000 MT mangoes, which accounts for 0.2 per cent of the total production.Mango growers in the country are planning to increase the volume of export of their produce to the United States this year. Last year, India exported 271 metric tonnes of mangoes to the US. Officials hope the figure will go up to 400 tonnes this year.Succulent Indian mangoes take a circuitous route through the countrys onion belt to head for the US. A sprawling irradiation facility set up in Lasalgaon, located 240 km north of Mumbai and approved by the United States agriculture department, treats these mangoes before they are exported.Till a decade ago, Indian mangoes had been banned from the US market for a period of 17 years over fears that pests would be imported through these mangoes.It was only in March 2006 that the then US President George W Bush during his India visit signed an agreement allowing the import of Indian mangoes to that country.India cultivates mangoes on nearly 2.2 lakh hectares and has production in the range of 19.51 million tonnes. It accounts for nearly 40 per cent of the total mango production in the world. Nearly 30 varieties of mangoes are grown in India, with Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka having the highest production.Despite this, India exports only 43,000 MT mangoes, which accounts for 0.2 per cent of the total production.The major five importing countries of Indian mangoes are UAE, Bangladesh, UK, Saudi Arabia, and Nepal.Interestingly, in spite of the high returns that the US market gives, exports to that country did not look up once the ban on Indian markets was lifted.Officials at Krushi Utpadan Sanrakshan Kendra (KRUSHAK), the irradiation centre, however, said they hoped to export 400 tonnes to the US this year.The US market would fetch an exporter four times the price than to any other country. Last year, the price fetched per tonne of exports was Rs 70,360. In the US, it was Rs 2.55 lakh. It is the fear of maintaining standards that is keeping Indians away from this market. This year, we hope we will reach the 400-tonne mark to the US, said a Maharashtra State Agriculture Management Board official.The irradiation plant set up at a cost of Rs 8 crore in 2002 was initially meant to treat onions. The members of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service of the United States agriculture department had subsequently visited the plant and have a go-ahead for the facilitys compliance for mangoes too.Before 2007, Indian mangoes had for 17 years faced non-trade barriers, such as sanitary and phyto-sanitary (plant health) measures, from the US, which feared pests like fruit flies and weevils could be imported through mangoes.However, this mango quarantine through irradiation has allayed the fears. During irradiation, foods are exposed briefly to a radiant energy source such as gamma rays or electron beams. This not only helps in killing harmful bacteria but also increases the shelf life of the fruit.The facility built by the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre has a processing capacity of 1 tonne every hour and BARC charges Rs 500 to irradiate every tonne of mango.Varieties like Alphonso are too sweet for the palate of Americans. It is Kesar that sells in those markets. A single Kesar fetches close to a dollar. However the packing, quality maintenance and paper work involved puts off most traders from approaching the US market, said Shirish Jain, a Gujarat-based exporter of Indian mangoes.For all the latest Cities News, download Indian Express App"

Drought, in a sense, has only added to the miseries of rural producers who are simultaneously battling the effects of a global commodity crash which has hit agricultural exports and farm prices.This time it has been a most unusual drought. Even with three consecutive bad crops (kharif 2014, rabi 2015, kharif 2015) and a fourth not-so-great one (thankfully, theres been no big damage from unseasonal rains/hail unlike in March 2015), the annual consumer food price inflation is only 5.3 per cent.In the past, droughts invariably fuelled speculation and hoarding by unscrupulous traders. This time were hardly feeling it in the cities. Barring sugar, where the price increase in recent weeks is more of a correction from unhealthy lows, consumers arent paying all that more for what they are eating compared to a year ago. No ones talking much about onion prices, either. Even arhar dal is selling cheaper than when it consumed the BJP in Bihars assembly elections during October-November; the same goes for urad, moong or masur.Simply put, this is a drought essentially of farmers and rural producers. And since it isnt really pinching urban consumers, politicians even in Maharashtra  where the drought is most acute  have found it more important to discuss whether not chanting Bharat mata ki jai amounts to treason. Incidentally, Asaduddin Owaisis defiant speech that set off this most-important debate was made at Latur in the droughts epicenter of Marathwada!For farmers, the current crisis isnt just of production loss from drought. It is also one of low price realisations. Farmers in Maharashtra are today selling cow milk at Rs 15-16 per litre, compared to Rs 25-26 a year ago.This, despite a severe fodder shortage that would also means higher production costs. In most crops  whether cotton, rubber, basmati, guarseed or even potatoes, apples, kinnow and pineapples  producer realisations are below what they were a couple of years ago. The only reason nobodys talking about onion these days is because the bulb is being sold in Maharashtras Lasalgaon market at below Rs 7/kg, as against Rs 12 last March and Rs 45-plus in early-September when pyaaz was grabbing all the headlines.Drought, in a sense, has only added to the miseries of rural producers who are simultaneously battling the effects of a global commodity crash which has hit agricultural exports and farm prices. That, in turn, also explains why urban consumers arent particularly feeling the heat of the drought: they have been shielded mainly by low global prices. Compare this to the situation in 2007 when international prices were on the boil and we had food riots everywhere, including in places like West Bengal.Right now, the drought is not about agriculture: The current rabi crop  whatever has been planted  is close to being harvested, if it has not already. The more immediate concern, instead, is about drinking water. With two-and-a-half months to go for the monsoon to arrive in the most parched areas and the countrys major reservoirs barely 25 per cent full, meeting peak summer drinking water requirements is going to be a challenge. It will be even more in Marathwada where reservoir water levels are down to 5 per cent of full storage capacity.The one consolation we have is global climate models pointing to a weakening of El Nino, which was the main cause of the 2015 drought. The 2015-16 El Nino was one of the longest, starting around February last. It is even now in a strong phase and is expected to enter neutral zone only towards May, according to the latest forecast of the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Since there is usually a two-month or so lag between its effects translating into actual rainfall, one cannot rule out a delay in the monsoon even if turns out normal.The NOAA is also giving a 50 per cent probability of a La Nina  El Ninos opposite, which is beneficial for the Indian monsoon  developing from August. But that again would deliver good rains not earlier than in the second half of the monsoon. A delayed, but good, monsoon is what seems most likely now. And that would mean a minimum three-month wait before things finally look up.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

Chairman of the Lasalgaon Market Committee Nanasaheb Patil said the government agencies, including NAFED, aim to buy 15,000 metric tonne onions this season.Onion prices over the last few months have been going down due to excess production of late kharif crop. In June last year, prices of the bulb had breached the Rs 50 per kg price in wholesale with its repercussions being felt across the country. The central government had increased the Minimum Export Price (MEP) of the product in order to control the prices. Over-production of late kharif onions had sent the prices down.Although the government had reduced the MEP to zero, subsequently, price of the bulb had failed to increase. The modal price of onion at the Lasalgaon market over the last few days has been hovering around Rs 7 per kg.Patil said despite the initial scare, area and productivity of rabi onions have been good. Due to the drought, many people had uprooted their cane crops and gone for onion cultivation, especially in Ahmednagar, he said.Estimates state that the production of rabi onions would be 15-20 per cent more of the normal produce this season. Rabi onions it might be recalled are the only onions which can be stored and fed the market till the next kharif onions get ready.In view of the constant slide of the prices, NAFED had decided to increase its target of buying from Lasalgaon. Along with NAFED, other government agencies like Maharashtra State Agricultural Marketing Board (MSAMB), will also participate in the purchase which will see a buffer stock being created. This will have a stabilising effect on the market, he said.The total quantum of the purchase he said would be around 15,000 metric tonnes. The state agriculture department has also taken steps to increase storage facility at the farm level also.NAFED in the past had floated tenders for construction of an air-conditioned storage facility for onion at Niphad. Although tenders were floated, Patil said the government is yet to give permission for the same.

Earlier, the GI tag was awarded to Kolhapuri chappals, Kolhapuri jaggery, Mahabaleshwar's strawberries, Nashik's grapes, Jalgaon's brinjals and Nagpur's oranges .A geographical indication (GI) is a name or a sign used on products which corresponds to a specific geographical location or origin like a town, a region, or a country. A community's intellectual property is attached to that particular product.""It took 2-3 years to get GIs for these products. The tag for these products means that their uniqueness has been verified by an expert committee of the Government of India,"" Ganesh Hingmire, chairman of Pune-based Great Mission Group Consultancy (GMGC), which has been instrumental in securing these certificates.Scoring a GI for a product helps the community in getting a premium price like the northeast India's Darjeeling tea. The GI creates a distinct identity of the product, assures the buyers of quality, brings reputation to the product and creates an international market for the products.Vengurla's cashew got a GI for its scientifically proven nutritional value and because its vitamin C content is five times more than that of an orange.Ajara's ghansal rice has been proven to be better than Basmati. The elongation ratio of ghansal rice is many times more than Basmati. Sindhudurg-Ratnagiri's kokum is naturally rich in hydroxycitric acid helpful in weight-loss tablets. Lasalgaon's onion has the highest sulphur percentage.India is a heavy consumer of beans (rajma) and 90% of it is imported. The rest mostly comes from Waghya's ghevda. Mangalveda's jowar and Navapur's tur are nature's gifts and tribal products, respectively. Navpur's tur is famous for its fragrance and pleasant taste.Since most of these are agricultural products are from villages, an immediate export market is created and it helps create an international demand for them, experts said.These products have been given GI's for either their nutritional, or scientific importance for which they will now be recognized at the national level.The ultimate beneficiaries of this process are the farmers who will now have to get themselves registered as authorized users to be able to avail of the benefits, Hingmire said.Another seven products were accepted for GI certification and their names were published in the official journal no. 78, 79 and 80 by the Union government.""Certificates to these will be issued in a month's time,"" said Hingmire. These products are Sangli's raisins, Waigaon's turmeric, Jalna's sweet orange, Beed's custard apple, Solapur's pomegranate, Purandar-Saswad's fig and Jalgaon's bharit brinjal."

In fact, onion growers had got Rs. 2,500- 5,000 in October-November last year for their monsoon crop.What is ironic is that there are no buyers for a large quantum of produce even at the above price range of Rs. 1,200-1,500. This has resulted in heaps of onion produce remaining unsold at the Raichur Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) yard.We have spent around Rs. 25,000 for cultivating onion on one acre. We got better crop this year both in terms of quality and yield. Unfortunately, there is no good price in the market. Wholesale buyers are asking the crop for a throwaway price. How can we survive? asked Hanumayya, a farmer from Sasivegera village in Deodurg taluk.His produce in 45 bags, each having 50 kg of fine quality onion, has remained unsold at the APMC for the last two days. I have decided to sell the produce at whatever price the buyer asks, he added.Most of the onion growers in the AMPC yard were in a similar condition as onion is a perishable agricultural produce and there was no hope of recovery of price in the immediate future. They were left with no option other than selling their produce at whatever price they get as they cannot take their crop back to their villages incurring additional transportation costs. They sleep beside their onion heaps in open protecting their crop from pigs and cattle.According to the traders, glut in the market caused by heavy imports from Nashik in Maharashtra caused the dip in the price of onion. The traders are heavily importing onion from Nashik. Supply is greater than the demand. This caused the prices to crash, Nagaraj, a trader, said.Chamarasa Malipatil, state president of the Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha, expressed similar views. According to him, the government imported onion from different countries when the onion prices were high in the domestic market.Massive imports, much greater than the required quantity, has caused the glut in the market. Now, domestic farmers have to bear the brunt. Farmers are in a very pathetic condition as they are repeatedly hit hard by problems floods, drought, Bt cotton failure and now price crash,"" he said. He demanded that the government open onion procurement centres at APMCs and purchase the produce directly from farmers offering minimum support price."

Shipments from MP and Rajasthan may be needed to make up for the supply shortfall from Maharashtra, which was hitherto the biggest onion supplier to Gujarat.Officials said the increase in production will give end-users some relief, as prices will not touch the Rs 100 per kg mark. Rajesh Patel, a farmer in Mahuva, said: ""Last year, we got good prices but it was the cold storage owners who really raked in the moolah. This year, we are expecting a good price for onions as the crop in other states is not as good as expected."" He further said that this year, the acreage sown with onion in Gujarat was higher than last year and this led to the increased production.However, according to farmers, the yield per hectare has gone down dramatically. Patel said this was because of the scanty rains last monsoon. Ghyanshyam Patel, a trader and a member of Mahuva APMC, says: ""We will depend on Rajasthan and MP and if we get adequate supplies from there, retail prices will be around Rs 50-60. Gujarat too saw increased production over the last few years, but this is not enough to bring prices down to the levels seen in 2013-14."""

Thanks to bumper crop with an average yield of 70-80 quintal per acre.""On Wednesday, small onions in Neemuch mandi sold between Rs 20 and Rs 30 per quintal, which translates into 20 to 30 paisa per kg. Better quality bigger onions are going for Rs 300 to Rs 650 per quintal,"" said Bhartendra Singh Chundawat, an onion farmer from Amlikheda village in Neemuch district. ""Onion seeds cost Rs 2,000 to Rs 2,500 per kg and an acre of land requires 4 kg of seeds. Add to this labour, pesticide, chemical sprays, and cutting. During harvesting a labourer charges Rs 150 per day. Overall we spend Rs 25,000 per acre to grow onions, but the market price today is devastating,"" he said.According to Bhartendra Singh, the prices have fallen drastically because of a bumper crop this year. But farmers don't seem to be benefitting from the high yield. ""When there is no supply in the market, onions sell for Rs 80 a kg. Now that there is a bumper crop, the supply far exceeds the present market demand,"" he added. Ratlam district mandi is getting an average 5,000 to 8,000 sacks of onions every day. A sack contains 50 kg of the vegetable. Mandsaur is getting an average 2,000 to 3,000 sacks while Neemuch gets an average of 3,000 to 4,000 sacks of the product daily.Speaking to TOI, two licenced traders in the Mandsaur mandi, Narendra Jain and Jethanand Hotwani, said onions sold for Rs 40 per kg or at Rs 4000 per quintal during the corresponding period last year. ""The crop from Madhya Pradesh has a market in Nasik, Malegaon, Hyderabad and Delhi. But this time Maharashtra too has had a bumper onion yield and there is no demand for onions from there,"" Narendra said. ""Traders are expecting some demand from West Bengal and Bihar. But the order for supply will come only if they have exhausted the supplies from their local mandis,"" said Hotwani.Senior journalist in Mandsaur, Ghamshyam Balwal, who has been following the onion story said, ""Farmers are bringing onions in huge quantities, but they don't know what to do with it. The prices are low and therefore selling would mean a huge loss. Storage is a problem and taking it back to the village would mean spending on additional transportation and adding further to cost of production. Some farmers have dumped their onions at the mandi and left. There are others who are not bringing their crops to the market. They are feeding it to the cattle in the village."""

The previous record was 194 lakh tonnes in 2013-14.""Onion production is going to be a record at 203 lakh tonnes this year. Better prices during the kharif (summer) season encouraged farmers to bring more area under onion in the rabi (winter) season,"" National Horticultural Research and Development Foundation (NHRDF) Director R P Gupta told PTI.Favourable climatic conditions have also encouraged the rabi crop prospects and yields are expected to be better than last year, he said, adding unlike last year, there were no unseasonal rains and hailstorm this time.Onion has been grown in 12 lakh hectare this year, slightly higher than 11.73 lakh hectare last year.Stating that rabi onion crop condition is good at present, the NHRDF chief said total rabi output is estimated to be higher by 15-20 per cent as compared to year ago.""The harvesting of rabi crop started in Maharashtra, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh. It is only rabi onion which is stored for use in lean season. Farmers and traders have started storage of onion,"" Gupta said.Around 45 lakh tonnes of expected to be stored in the current year due to availability of good quality of onion bulb in the market, he added.On prices, Gupta said farmers are getting an average Rs 8 per kg in Lasalgaon in Maharashtra, Asia's biggest wholesale market for onion and earning minimum 20 per cent profit over the cost of production.Nearly 60 per cent of India's annual output comes from the rabi season, while the kharif and late-kharif sowing seasons contribute 20 per cent each.Rabi onion is grown in almost all states, but major growing states are Maharashtra, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, West Bengal, Bihar, Rajasthan, Odisha, and Uttar Pradesh."

The vegetable that made headlines last year when its price touched Rs70 a kg is today selling for just Rs5 a kg in the bulk market. In neighbourhood vegetable markets, the rates are ranging from Rs14 to 16 a kg, less than half the price last April.Hoping to get higher prices like last year, farmers had increased the area under onion cultivation. This has led to a deluge of supply, bringing the prices down. The production has gone up in all onion growing states like Gujarat, Maharashtra and Karnataka. White onions are being sold at Rs5 to 6 in the wholesale market and it is Rs7 to 8 for the red variety, said a source in M/s Afzal Trading Company, a firm based at Kalamna agriculture produce market yard. In a month, the rates have gone down by Rs2 per kg, he said.The current rates are not even enough to meet the production cost for farmers, who need to get at least Rs6 to 7 a kg to break even, sources said.Vijay Rathore, a cultivator from Dhule district, said now farmers have begun holding on to the stock. ""Even I have stored around 200 quintals in a chali (bamboo enclosure used to store onions). I will wait for the rates to go up,"" he said The cost of each chali comes to around Rs25,000, he said.There is a glut in Karnataka too, which is the second major source of supply for traders in Nagpur. B Ravishankar of M/s Ravi Trading Company said the southern crop, which starts in July-August is exhausted by January in the normal course. However, the arrivals are continuing even in April and are expected to last for one more month. This shows that the prices will remain subdued in the near future. In Bangalore, the bulk rates have touched Rs5 a kg, he said.Potatoes, which are traded along with onions, are however getting slightly costlier. The rates opened at Rs600 per 50kg at the start of the season at Mainpuri in UP, a major supply centre. As against this, it was Rs400 last year when the production was relatively low.A trader at M/s Aditya Kumar and Co in Mainpuri said this is because this year the potato growers are holding on to the crop and allowing only limited supplies into the market. So, despite higher output the rates have remained firm.A trader at Ram Aloo Bhandar at Gokulpeth market said potatoes are costing Rs20 a kg and the rates are inching up gradually. At this time of the year, when fresh supply is available, the rates are usually in the range Rs12 to 14 a kg. However, this year the commodity is in shortage at the bulk market, he said."

Onions are selling now for Rs 15-Rs 12 per kilo in the retail market. Last summer, the bulb was selling for Rs 100-Rs 80 per kilo, the resultant upset to family budgets giving a whole new meaning to the term onion tears. But now, fresh onions are abundantly found in the wholesale market at Pandra and retail markets across the capital, thanks to cheap exports from Nashik in Maharashtra and Bengal, as well as Jharkhand's own domestic rabi crop in Ranchi, Gumla, Ramgarh, Hazaribagh and Latehar districts as some leftover kharif stock. Retailers at Lalpur, Kutchery and Daily Market said onions were being sold between Rs 15 and Rs 12 per kilo in April, down from Rs 18-Rs 25 per kilo last month. ""We have a lot of onions since late March, as fresh rabi stocks started coming. We also have leftover kharif stocks,"" said vegetable vendor Sameer Mahto in Lalpur. Agreeing, Jharkhand State Agricultural Marketing Board marketing director Ajit Kumar Singh said the rate of onions had declined drastically in the last few weeks. ""Wholesale rate of onion is Rs 1,000-Rs 1300 a quintal while retail price is Rs 12-Rs 13 per kilo. In Jharkhand, onion comes from Nashik and Bengal as well as districts here that grow it. The future looks bright for the state."" Dr K.K. Jha, a horticulture scientist of Birsa Agricultural University agreed. ""In Jharkhand, farmers in Bero and Mandar in Ranchi, as well as some blocks in Hazaribagh, Gumla, Latehar and Ramgarh are growing onions. The total area across the state right now is around 1,000 hectares, but this time, rabi production was quite good at around 4,000 to 5,000 tonnes."" Asked, Ram Akbal Choudhary, an onion wholesaler at Pandra, said they were trading domestic onions from Ramgarh on an average everyday. ""We sell Ramgarh onions at Rs 8 per kilo to retailers, slightly cheaper than the ones from Bengal and Nashik in Maharashtra, which we peg at Rs 8.50 and Rs 9 per kilo,"" he said. ""Earlier, from Ranchi, we used to send onions to Ramgarh, Gumla and Latehar. But now, we stopped sending them onions as local production seems quite high in these districts.

Homemakers are already happy with the onion windfall. Lalpur-based Neelam Sinha, who stocked 5kg of onions, said the price was unbelievable and the quality so good that she couldn't help it.

Patna at present is enjoying a surplus of a different sort - fresh and cheap onions, a potent cooler in summer. Arhar dal - the most popular of the pulses consumed in Bihar - is, however, pinching residents' pockets. Onion is selling in the retail markets at Rs 15-18 per kg against last summer's range of Rs 70-80 per kg. Families shed tears of pungency, as residents struggled to fit their household budgets around the much-needed onion bite. The story's quite different this year because of better yield than last year and expecting fresh Rabi stocks. ""Last year, onions were a luxury,"" said 62-year-old Shanti. ""But this year's onion windfall has made me more than happy. The price and quality are so unbelievably good that I have bought 5kg of onions at Rs 18 a kilo. But dal, now that's a completely different story."" "" Arhar dal is burning holes in our pockets as it is sold at Rs 150-180 per kg these days. Just around two months ago, the pulse rate was around Rs 120-150. Last year, we were crying over onion prices, this time around, arhar dal is making us shed tears,"" added Shanti. The pulses rate started climbing since last October with prices touching Rs 200 per kg. The current surge has been a national phenomenon, said Sudhanshu Kumar, a farmer in Samastipur district. ""As vegetable supplies have been hit this year by the scorching summer, it has led the pulses demand to surge. The government needs to manage supplies to keep a tab on the prices."" In Bihar, arhar dal is produced in Sheikhpura, Lakhisarai, Munger, Darbhanga, Madhubani and Samastipur but the demand for it is mostly met with supply from other states. Onion prices have fallen since last April because of good yield, said wholesalers at Digha Ghat, Anta Ghat and Mithapur where rates were around Rs 70-80 a kg last year - an almost 500 per cent difference. ""The supply of onions has been quite good since late March as fresh stocks started coming,"" said Ranjit Kumar, a wholesaler at the Mithapur vegetable market. Bihar is one of the top 10 onion producing states in the country and is mainly cultivated in Nalanda, Sheikhpura and Patna among few other districts. It is normally cultivated during winter and harvested before the arrival of summer. ""Comparatively, warmer winter has led to a positive impact on the overall yield of onion in Bihar,"" said Anil Jha, an expert in the state agriculture department. Sanjay Priyadarshi, deputy secretary, agriculture, said: ""Last year, onion availability was hit because of low supply from Nashik, Maharashtra, but this year, the state's Rabi onion yield has been quite good. So onion prices have come down."""

(Express Photo: Partha Sarathi Biswas) Vishwanath Nagare, a farmer from a village near Lasalgaon, with his stored rabi onion crop. (Express Photo: Partha Sarathi Biswas)Its roughly a month since Vishwanath Nagare harvested his rabi onion crop, but he is yet to take it to the market.Prices are now just Rs 800 per quintal. I wont sell until they at least cross Rs 1,000, says this farmer from Sarole Thadi, a village in Nashik districts Niphad taluka just about 18 km Lasalgaon that houses Indias largest wholesale onion market.Last year, Nagare, who grows onion in one out of his total five-acre holding, realised an average rate of Rs 1,300 per quintal. But he could sell only six tonnes, as the crop itself suffered damage from unseasonal rains in March. This time, he has produced 11 tonnes, but prices are lower: If they dont improve soon, I will lose money yet again.There are many farmers like Nagare, who are unable to fathom the wild fluctuation in onion prices over the last year and more. Between April and September, the average modal price  the rate at which the maximum number of trades happen  in Lasalgaon soared from Rs 1,093 to Rs 4,130 per quintal. For a brief period, during the third week of August, they even hit Rs 5,000-5,000/quintal levels. That was, of course, the time when pyaaz was all over the newspapers and TV channels. The price spiral was partly a result of Indias onion output dropping to 189.28 lakh tonnes (lt) in 2014-15, from the preceding years 194.02 lt, and also average monthly exports of over one lt per month during January-July 2015.Share This Article Related Article Demonetisation on the ground: Onion growers suffer labour pangsDemonetisation on the ground: Onion growers suffer labour pangs As onion prices plunge to decade low, farmers take to sit-insAs onion prices plunge to decade low, farmers take to sit-ins As onion prices dip, Maharashtra government declares Re 1/kg as subsidyAs onion prices dip, Maharashtra government declares Re 1/kg as subsidy Price crash: Onions bring tears, this time to farmersPrice crash: Onions bring tears, this time to farmers The Failing Fields: From mango to sugar, its a bitter storyThe Failing Fields: From mango to sugar, its a bitter story Onion growers in tearsBut since December  with the arrival of the 2015-16 kharif and late-kharif crops  prices have been on a downward slope, falling below Rs 1,000 per quintal by early February. The new rabi onion crop hitting the market after harvesting during March-May has taken prices even lower; they fell to Rs 600 per quintal levels in mid-March, before recovering a tad thereafter. The resultant distress to farmers is hardly making headlines.What farmers here are unable to comprehend is how prices have crashed, that too in the midst of a drought of the kind Maharashtra is currently seeing. Rabi onion area in the state, in fact, has dipped to around 1,90,000 hectares this year, as against over 3,42,000 hectares in 2014-15. According to Nanasaheb Patil, chairman of Lasalgaons agriculture produce market committee, the decline would have steeper but for some extra area being sown under the crop in Ahmednagar and Aurangabad. Towards November-end, water from the Gangapur dam in Nashik was released for Marathwada. As this water passed through Ahmednagar and Aurangabad, farmers along the canal uprooted their ratoon sugarcane and planted onion in its place, he points out.The sugar commissionerates data shows a 40 per cent acreage reduction under ratoon cane  which grows from the stubble of the harvested plant crop  this time in Maharashtra. Kashinath Sanap from Baktarpur village of Ahmednagars Kopargaon taluka is among those who decided to divert four acres of his cane area to onion. There was no water to sustain a 12-month ratoon cane crop. So, I went for rabi onion, he says. But he, too, is disappointed that the crop is selling in Kopargaon at below Rs 700 per quintal.Patil believes that the Lasalgaon market is now witnessing a heavy influx of onions from Ahmednagar and Aurangabad  which is also the reason for prices plunging. These farmers, unlike the ones in the traditional onion belt of Nashik, Pune and Dhule, have no facilities for on-field storage. So, they have no option but sell at the earliest, he notes.Farmers in the main onion belt have the capacity to hold back their crop a little longer. But even they, Patil admits, cannot expect prices to go up much, especially with onion acreages in other states like Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and Rajasthan rising significantly. The Nashik-based National Horticultural Research & Development Foundation (NHRDF) has estimated this years rabi onion crop to be 15-20 per cent higher, with overall production for 2015-16 pegged at 203 lt.Rabi onions have longer shelf life and are amenable to storage. NHRDF has projected that around 45 lt of rabi onions would be stored by farmers and traders in the current marketing season due to availability of good quality bulbs. This is more than the 40 lt from last years rain and hail-damaged crop.Farmers in Nashik, Pune and Dhule alone have constructed storage capacities aggregating some 14 lt. Such on-farm structures, typically of 25-30 tonnes capacity and costing a couple of lakhs, have been built through special subsidies from NABARD and the state agriculture department. But farmers hopes of making money from stored onions, this time, have been dashed by crashing prices, for which they largely blame theCentres move to impose minimum export price (MEP) restrictions on onion. During the price surge in August, the MEP was hiked to $700 per tonne, putting a virtual halt on shipments.As domestic prices went into free fall, the MEP was eventually scrapped on December 23. But for farmers, who were harvesting their kharif onions, it was too late.Omprakash Raka, a trader-cum-exporter from Nashik, recalls that till about 6-7 years back, NAFED used to have monthly meetings with all concerned stakeholders to take regular stock of the onion supply position. These interactions allowed informed decisions, including that on MEP, to be taken. But that practice has been replaced by fixing of MEPs in an ad hoc manner, he claims. The main beneficiaries of Indias MEP restrictions have been exporters in China, Egypt and Pakistan. They have all reported good crops this year, even as India is struggling to regain its lost market share from these players.The Centre has now directed NAFED and other state agencies to procure 15,000 tonnes. NAFED is expected to start procurement from April 18, with the Maharashtra State Agricultural Marketing Board and others to wade in towards May. This, it is hoped, would help push up realisations above Rs 1,000 per quintal. But unlike last year, the chances of any price spiral seem remote.While that may be good news for urban consumers, for Maharashtras farmers this would translate into yet another cycle of losses. Santosh Gorade from Takli village in Niphad taluka has stored around 6.5 tonnes of his produce in anticipation of higher prices. He sums up the situation best: Temperatures here have already crossed 40 degrees Celsius. If they continue at this level, the bulbs will start rotting, forcing us to go for distress sale. There was no acche din for us last year and we dont see it this season as well.WATCH INDIAN EXPRESS VIDEOS HEREFor all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Interactions with farmers, retailers and consumers indicate that a big chunk of vegetables arriving in markets across the City might show chemical contamination if tested.Puroshottam Gowda, a farmer from Ballari opines that the share of such vegetables could be as high as 75%. Most of the vegetables are grown near Kengeri and surrounding areas. The farmers grow greens, tomato, cabbage and other vegetables using water from a sewage treatment plant. The water is supposed to be purified but at most places, the plants do not work. This is unfortunate.""However, RV Gopi, President, Wholesale Vegetables and Fruits Traders Merchant Association, does not agree. According to him, drainage water was earlier being used by vegetable growers in Kengeri, Gollahalli and Varthur. But now, says he, most of the farmers have stopped vegetable farming there due to encroachment of lakes and rapid urbanisation.Sellers and middlemen at Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) Yard, Yeshwantpur admit that the quality of fruits and vegetables has come down because of bad water quality and pollution.Yet, there are many others who deny using dirty water to grow greens. Suresh, a wholesale onion and potato merchant from APMC contends that most of his produce comes from Maharashtra and Chitradurga region. He says the farmers there depend on borewell water and tap water to grow vegetables and not drainage.Hoskote-based farmer Chandra Gowda claims he uses borewell water for vegetable farming. But he has seen a few farmers using water from polluted lakes in his locality.Environmentalists suggest that reducing pollution at water source points and increasing awareness among public on the dangers of consuming food with high heavy metal contamination could be helpful. But consumers say they are helpless. Despite knowing the harmful effects of chemical contamination, they have no choice but to buy the fruits and vegetables from the markets.Says Sheela Kumar, a resident of Hennur: Today, everything from water to air to soil is contaminated. I try washing fruits and vegetables with running water as many times as possible and boil them properly before consuming them. We cannot avoid consuming them. Taking precautionary measures is the best available option.Malini Parmar, a resident of Bellandur and an active member of Kasa Muktha Bellandur, informs that BBMP had conducted a drive in her locality to seize plastics. The Palike personnel confiscated boxes filled with artificial colouring content from vegetable farmers. These were used to add colour to peas.Parmar sees a way out in using organic vegetables. She explains, The best way to avoid consumption of harmful produce is by buying organic produce. Though it is expensive, it is worth as it keeps me and my family healthy. Apart from sewage effluents inside the lake, garbage is also being burnt and dumped there. I see ashes floating atop Bellandur lake due to burning of waste.Malleswaram resident Sampath Kumar agrees that organic vegetables could be an option only if people can afford them. Not everyone can buy organic stuff, he points out."

Picture by Hardeep Singh Ranchi, May 26: The JMM and the Congress today launched blistering attacks on the BJP-led government that completed two years in power at the Centre. Leading the offensive, the state's principal Opposition party JMM called the Narendra Modi government a "" dholpitwa"" (one who beats his own drum), who had failed on every front - domestic as well as diplomatic - during the first two years in office. ""There is no control on the inflation, the price rise has severely hit the poor and middle class while bad loans have pushed the banks on the verge of collapse,"" said JMM working president Hemant Soren during a news meet at his Kanke Road residence in Ranchi today. ""Farmers in Maharashtra are forced to sell onion at throwaway prices; our relations with neighbouring countries like Nepal have deteriorated; but the BJP government has been busy making announcements and launching new projects over the past two years. It is a dholpitwa sarkar,"" Hemant added. The Congress today held a news conference and a rally to highlight the failures of the Modi government. AICC spokesperson Rita Bahuguna, who arrived here from Lucknow to lead the attack, said that the BJP government's achievements included only polarisation of masses on religious and communal lines and prosecution of students on the name of law and order. She also accused the BJP of protecting the interests of corporates, defaulters and fugitives like Vijay Malaya and Lalit Modi. ""The country had never faced such a bad situation... even essential commodities are out of poor people's reach. Fuel prices have dropped by 54 per cent in international markets, but the country has witnessed only 16 per cent decrease. Where has the rest of the money gone?' Bahuguna asked. While defaulters like Vijay Malya were allowed to safely escape the country, poor farmers were being harassed on the name of loan recovery. ""Modi had promised good days for farmers, but they are being forced to work as daily wage labourers. Water crisis and drought are forcing farmers to commit suicide in different parts of the country. But PM has no time to visit aggrieved people,"" she said. Around 1,000 Congress workers, led by former Union minister Subodh Kant Sahay and party spokesperson Lal Kishore Nath Shahdeo, took out a protest march from Albert Ekka Chowk to Raj Bhavan around noon. Later, a Congress delegation submitted a memorandum to governor Droupadi Murmu, pointing out failures of the Modi government in the Centre and the Raghubar Das government in the state. ""The Das government started with a bang, and within a year and half ended up in a whimper. The local residents' policy announced by the government has disappointed people,"" Sahay said. Rajya Sabha polls Senior JMM leader Hemant Soren today said that the party was considering fielding its own candidate for the upcoming Rajya Sabha poll. ""At this juncture, I can only say that the party may stake its claim on the seat. But a final decision will be taken by the party,"" said the Leader of the Opposition in the state Assembly. Congress nominee Dhiraj Prasad Sahu has already expressed his wish to contest the Upper House seat for the second consecutive term. JMM has altogether 19 MLAs, Congress seven and JDU has two legislators, besides other smaller parties and Independents. One needs 28 first preference votes to win a Rajya Sabha seat in Jharkhand. It is still not clear whether the BJP will contest for only one seat or will go for both, the elections for which are scheduled for June 11."

The all-India onion production figure has touched 203.15 lakh metric tonnes (MT), the highest in recent years, which is in excess of the average consumption of 144 lakh MT. Prices at Lasalgaon market in Nashik, the largest onion market in the state, have dropped to Rs 750 per quintal on average from last years Rs 5,500 to Rs 6,000 per quintal.This essentially means a farmer is selling one kg of good quality onions at Rs 7.5 in the wholesale market, a price too low to even compensate the production cost. The state is one of the largest producers of onions in the country, contributing to almost 40 per cent of total production.Essentially, the farmers got their math wrong. Buoyed by onion prices last year, many farmers took to onion cultivation. The area under onion cultivation in the state almost doubled in the 2015 rabi season. Farmers hoped they would get the 2015 rate, which did not happen as the produce quantity shot up, said Nanasaheb Patil, chairman, Lasalgaon Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC).A major reasons for the rise in onion prices last year was hailstorm-induced damage to the crop. Though production was satisfactory last year, the natural calamity had reduced the keeping quality (shelf life) of the crop. So the produce that was harvested faced damages and prices went up, said Mr. Patil.The drought too pushed up onion farming. There was water scarcity and sensing that, even sugarcane farmers turned to onion cultivation in many parts of the state, said Deepak Chavan, a Pune-based agriculture commodity analyst. A similar trend was witnesses in other parts of the country, he said.The vicious cycleAccording to Mr. Chavan, while the drought has already affected lakhs of farmers in the state, the continued drop in prices and the governments inability to extend fair prices to farmers will hit more of them hard. Due to this drop, next year, farmers will not opt for onions and then it will lead to an increase in prices. This is a cyclical process that has been going on for years. It should be stopped in the interest of both farmers and consumers, he said.There is a similar increase in onion production in Pakistan and China and has brought in restrictions on export of the Indian crop, said onion trader Sanjay Pingle from the Vashi APMC.According to a National Horticulture Research & Development Foundation report, the arrival of onion increased in almost all the markets of major rabi onion-producing states. The harvesting of rabi onion will continue till May 2016. Farmers and traders started storing good quality onions from April 2016, and it is expected to continue till May-end. Around 45 lakh MT or even more is expected to be stored in the current year due to the availability of good quality and the prevailing low rates. Onion prices are expected to remain the same till May/June 2016, the report stated.Systemic failureFarmers say the government failed to see this coming. Farmers have been agitating since December 2015, but no one bothered to listen to them. Adding onion to the essential commodities list has ensured that traders do not stock, making matters worse. Our policies are always consumer-centric, but what about the producers? Mr. Patil said.Last year, onion prices had shot up after the crop was damaged by hail, reducing shelf life"

The aim behind creating a buffer stock is to stabilise the prices in the domestic market in case of scarcity of onions.The Union government had set a target of creating buffer stock of 15,000 tonnes through central agencies like Nafed and the Small Farmers' Agribusiness Consortium (SFAC) by June-end to control the rise in onion prices expected from August to October due to scarcity.Speaking to TOI, a source from Nafed said, ""We started procuring onions for the central government under the Price Stabilisation Fund (PSF). The government had given a target of procuring 10,000 tonnes of onions, but we have decided to buy only 5,000 tonnes due to lack of storage facility. Last year, we had procured 2,500 tonnes of onions. We have decided to increase the target gradually every year,"" adding that the federation would procure the remaining 1,000 tonnes by the second week of June.""""We have procured 4,000 tonnes at Rs 3.22 crore from Lasalgaon, Pimpalgaon and Kalwan Agriculture Produce Market Committees (APMCs). The average onion procurement price is Rs 805 per quintal,"" the source added.Nafed has procured 1,800 tonnes from the Lasalgaon mandi, 1,600 tonnes from Pimpalgaon and 600 tonnes at Kalwan mandi.The onions are being stored at two of Nafed's facilities at Pimpalgaon and Lasalgaon that have a total capacity of 4,000 tonnes. Nafed has also got storage facilities on lease with total capacity of 1,900 tonnes, including 1,000 tonnes storage capacity at Pimpalgaon, 500 tonnes at Lasalgaon and 400 tonnes in Kalwan.Last year, the average wholesale prices had sky-rocketed due to scarcity of onions. The average wholesale onion prices had recorded an all-time high of Rs 5,700 per quintal on August 22 due to decline in supply as compared to demand. The retail prices had touched Rs 100 per kg in Mumbai, Delhi and other major cities of the country, while they had touched Rs 80 per kg in Nashik's retail market. Even though the Centre had created a buffer stock of 12,000 tonnes through Nafed and SFAC, it still had to import onions to meet the domestic requirement."

(Express Photo: Narendra Vaskar) The Vashi mandi, situated 35 km from the Mumbai main city. (Express Photo: Narendra Vaskar)Spread over 70 hectares land off the Old Mumbai-Pune highway, its a place where more than Rs 10,000 crore worth of fruits, vegetables and other farm produce gets traded annually. But right now, its also the scene of a prabodhan, a mass awakening campaign by traders and commission agents that could gather pace in the days ahead.The Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) at Vashi, barely 35 km from the main Mumbai city, is one of Maharashtras 305 regulated mandis where produce is first traded before being taken for consumption elsewhere. While the smallest of these may have a yearly turnover of below Rs 25 lakh, the Vashi APMC is the largest and also a terminal market receiving daily over 2,000 trucks that ferry produce from both within and outside Maharashtra. Last year alone, this mandi saw arrivals of 8,93,444 tonnes of onions and potatoes, 5,64,056 tonnes of other vegetables and 6,63,831 tonnes of fruits.Currently, though, a single factor is uniting the market players operating in regulated mandis across Maharashtra irrespective of size: The state governments move to delist fruits and vegetables (F&V) from the purview of the APMC Act. This, if it happens as was done by the Delhi government in September 2014, would dispense with the requirement for all F&V to be brought to mandis and sold through licensed market agents charging commission fees. Such fees in the Vashi APMC amount to 6.5 per cent of the purchase price of onions and potatoes, 8 per cent for other vegetables and 10 per cent for fruits.Watch Video: Whats making newsThe notification delisting F&V will be issued in the next few days. The issue has been pending since long and we have decided to go ahead taking into account the interest of farmers, said Chandrakant Patil, Maharashtras minister for cooperation.This isnt the first attempt at a significant agricultural marketing reform. In 2012, Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil, who was agriculture minister in the previous Congress-NCP regime, had announced the intent at delisting horticultural produce from the state APMC Acts purview. A final decision, however, could not be taken following strong trader protests.The possibility of the reform going through is seen to be higher under the present BJP-Shiv Sena dispensation. A major reason for it is that the APMCs  like sugar and various other rural-based cooperatives  are largely controlled by the NCP and Congress. The ruling alliance partners have little presence in APMC boards that are supposed to have elected directors representing all stakeholders, including farmers, traders and mandi labourers. The Vashi APMC is now under a state government-appointed administrator, with the earlier board of directors superseded for alleged malpractices.The total turnover of APMCs in Maharashtra is roughly Rs 50,000 crore. Delisting of F&V may bring this down by Rs 10,000 crore. But even this neednt be the case, as we have seen in Delhi, where business at Azadpur mandi has not suffered after delisting. We are only giving farmers an option, which includes supplying directly to processors or supermarkets. Theres nothing stopping them from continuing to sell through APMCs, pointed out Patil.F&V contribute over Rs 3,000 crore to the Vashi APMCs yearly turnover of Rs 10,000-12,000 crore.APMCs were originally established with a view to prevent exploitation of farmers by intermediaries, who compelled them to dispose of their produce at the farmgate at very low prices. By mandating all farm produce to be brought to regulated market yards and sold through auctions, the APMC mechanism was meant to ensure fair prices to farmers. But in many cases, these bodies have themselves become dens for cartelisation by traders, who control prices and charge hefty commission fees on produce transactions.An extreme case that surfaced recently was of Devidas Maruti Parbhane. This farmer from Vadgaon Rasai, a village in Pune districts Shirur taluka, supplied one tonne of onions early this month at the local market yard under the Pune APMCs jurisdiction. The price he got  a little more than Rs 1.5 per kg  was itself very low. But adding insult to injury was the various cuts imposed on top of this.A scrutiny of Parbhanes patti (trade slip) by The Indian Express revealed his total revenues from the sale of one tonne of onions at Rs 1,523.20. The total cuts even on this meager amount added up to Rs 1,522.20. That included commission fees of Rs 91.30, hamali or labour charges of Rs 59, bharai or filling-in-bags charges of Rs 18.55, tolai or loading charges of Rs 33.30, and transport charges of Rs 1,320 (as the kutcha patti issued in Shirur was billed for delivery at Pune). Parbhane, at the end of it, was left with a net earning of Re 1: When after the auction, the trader handed me a Re 1 coin, I was flabbergasted. Maybe, he should not have taken the trouble to pay me even that!Traders, however, dismiss these as one-off incidents, while claiming that delisting of F&V would ultimately hurt even farmers. The produce brought by farmers is not uniform, which is what processors want. The APMCs are tuned to handle variety. Here, we have 50-55 varieties of vegetables and 25-30 varieties of fruits arriving on a daily basis. Such variety will disappear once delisting happens. Moreover, instead of a centralised marketplace, youll have small and medium vehicles carrying farm produce and creating traffic mayhem in Mumbai, warned Rajendra Shelke, a leading onion and potato commission agent at the Vashi APMC.Besides, the APMC system guarantees that the farmer is paid for his produce, which wouldnt be the case if he were to sell directly? The proposed reform looks good on paper, but it will only spell doom for the farmer and end up completely destroying the agrarian economy, he added.Sanjay Pansare, who represents traders at the Vashi APMCs fruit market, justified the high commission rates on grounds that the goods being handled here were perishable and prone to quality deterioration. Only around a quarter of the produce brought to the market is eventually of the best quality; the rest falls between medium and bad. The losses borne by traders on this count have to, therefore, be made up through higher commission fees. Since 2002, the Maharashtra government has been issuing marketing licenses to various entities for procuring directly from the farmgate. Besides, 34 private markets have been allowed to be set up. But despite this, an estimated 75 per cent of annual arrivals of F&V in the state still take place in APMCs. The proportions are lower at 46 per cent for cotton and 25-30 per cent in oilseeds and foodgrains.Delisting F&V from the purview of the APMC ActThis isnt the first attempt at a significant agricultural marketing reform. In 2012, Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil, who was agriculture minister in the previous Congress-NCP regime, had announced the intent at delisting horticultural produce from the state APMC Acts purview.

Photo: Rajendra Singh HajeriThe prices of onion, which have fallen flat, have shattered the hopes of farmers of earning a profit this year.Vijayapura district, third in the State in producing onion, has been witnessing a sharp fall in the onion prices which has caused severe dismay among the onion farmers here.The farmers said that they are facing double whammy. On one hand, the Union Government has imposed export duty owing to which the traders are not willing to export and on the other hand, the local market is being proliferated with onions from outside. The import of onions from Maharashtra is like rubbing salt on our wounds, said Somanath Biradar, one of the major onion producers.He said that looking at the last years rate where the farmers fetched around Rs. 2,500 per quintal, many farmers, having irrigation facility, cultivated onion this summer.But fluctuating weather and difficulty in export have hit the farmers hard, he said.Mr. Biradar said that since onion is a perishable item, the farmers cant store it for long to wait for hike in the price.The climatic condition is completely adverse to onion as even the cold wind makes onion start to rot. Thus, in the present condition, the farmers cant store the onion for more than a fortnight. Therefore, they are forced to sell the onion at any given price in the market, he said.Saluddin Bagwan, one of the wholesale onion traders said that in open market, the onion is sold at Rs. 6 to Rs.12 kilograms. Last year, the same onion was sold at Rs. 25 per kg which is good price for farmers, he said.He said that despite having good market for Vijayapura onion in States such as Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, the traders are reluctant to buy.The onion is cultivated on around 12,000 hectares in the district with the average annual production around 2.5 lakh tonnes. Meanwhile, the farmers are demanding the State government to open onion procurement centres to help them."

Lethargy and mismanagement by the State government, problems of a mismatch in demand-supply, and rigidity in the supply chain, owing to a narrow stock limit, were further compounded by the extended two-year drought in the State.Maharashtra, somehow, failed to put a finger on the pulses crisis. Not only did the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-headed government in the State miss a few tricks, it moved slowly and clumsily in intervening to stem the prices during the peak crisis period between March and October, 2015.The governments mismanagement even spurred action by the Prime Ministers Office which had to intervene to correct the misinterpretation of central orders. On October 28, 2015, Joint Secretary to Prime Minister, Anurag Jain, wrote to Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis: Stock limit shall apply to any stock held by dealers after the first sale by importer.The limit was for wholesale traders to maintain less than 5,000 quintals of pulse stock in Mumbai; 3,500 quintals in other areas, and 1/9th of last three years crushing dal stocks with millers.Meanwhile, between April 10 last year and April 11 this year, the prices jumped by 60.35% for tur, 83.55% for urad, and 43.57% for gram.The State has so far shown little urgency in lifting the un-milled pulses from the Centres buffer stock (at Rs. 66 per kg, to be sold in the retail market at Rs. 120 per kg). With a prospective shortfall of 13,00,000 metric tonnes this year, the State failed to lift two instalments from the buffer stock totalling 17,000 tonnes. This stock is now gathering dust at Food Corporation of India (FCI) godowns at Latur, Akola, Jalgaon, Udgir and Yavatmal. The mismanagement of the crisis did not end with this. In October 2015, the government misinterpreted central directives and lifted the stock limit on pulses at 4 p.m. on October 19. This was followed by midnight raids on consignments at ports and seizure of nearly 74,846 tonnes of pulses from alleged hoarders.Traders, importers and millers claim the States reaction delivered a disastrous signal to the market, which reacted with a further price hike. All the government did was, paint the entire trading community as hoarders and black marketers. The government must facilitate trade instead of trying to micro regulate it during a crisis such as this, said Prem Kogta, president of the Jalgaon Dal Mill Owners Association.Not a single action was taken against the big corporate retail chains found selling pulses at higher rates, while importers and traders working on wholesale prices  that remained lower than retail prices all through 2015  faced the brunt. Chains like Big Bazaar, Reliance Fresh did not face any music at all while the importers and miller were hounded, said Navin Bhai, former secretary of Grain Rice and Wholesale Merchants Association (Mumbai).The seized stock was later returned to the same traders who had faced government action under the Essential Commodities Act, and the stock limit was scalede back until September 30, 2016. Unable to control the crisis, the State appointed a Price Monitoring Committee on December 28 last year to regulate the rates of 27 essential commodities, including onion and potato. The committee suggested introduction of a Price Control Act to ensure traders prepare a rate chart, and sell pulses at fixed prices. The punishment for violation was proposed as jail term of three months or one year.The Bill is currently pending approval by President Pranab Mukherjee. The trigger for the draft Bill was hoarding and profiteering by traders. It cannot be denied that traders are creating artificial shortages to jack up prices, there is an urgent need for a Bill to control prices, the Act will allow traders to appeal to Divisional Commissioners, a Cabinet note of April, 2016 reads.Historical mismatchIn 1956, India was producing 120 lakh tonnes of pulses for a population of 42 crore.In 2015-2016, production of pulses is estimated at 17.06 million tonnes, while the demand for it stands at 23.5 million tonnes.Our population kept increasing but the pulse production remained static. The per capita consumption dropped to 40 gm per person from 68 gm in the 1950s, the yield too dipped to about eight quintal an acre from 12 quintal. Slowly, the farmers abandoned pulses because its yield was three times less than wheat, and when the governments minimum support price too supported wheat, that was the end of pulse production in India. The successive governments did not make any long term plans. It (crisis) has now exploded, explained Sunil Baltewa, executive member of the New Delhi Grind Merchants Association.Buffer stockThe fears of buffer stock going waste were raised at a meeting of the State price monitoring committee on pulses on April 21 this year. Members of the committee revealed that the government is yet to chalk out a plan to transport 7,367.5 tonnes of tur, urad and chana to the milling units due to disagreement of prices. The government has no clue where the milling and polishing of the naked grain is going to be carried out or what will be the recovery percentage millers are going to charge. All this, while a huge stock is lying at the FCI godowns. This government is just lethargic, said Nitin Kalantari, manufacturer of Pistol Dal, a popular brand in Marathwada.A senior FCI official said they had started procuring pulses since January  tur at Rs 8,900 per quintal, urad at Rs. 4,800 per quintal and chana at Rs. 10,800 per quintal. But we do not yet have information on what the State wants to do with this stock, whether they want to distribute it through PDS or auction it directly into the market. We do not have any experience of distribution or transportation, said G.S. Rajasekhar, general manager, FCI (Maharashtra).Consumer, the fall guyThe ultimate impact of the pulse crisis is being felt by the average consumer, who is forced to cut down on his daily consumption. On an average, a single family in Maharashtra consumes 200 gm of tur daily, which goes up during the festive season.Low-income homes are either cutting down on consumption or trying to substitute tur with moong which has more amount of nutrient value. Earlier, when tur was around Rs. 100/Rs. 120, I used to buy two to three kg per month for my family, but now prices have increased to about Rs. 200/ Rs. 220. We have cut our consumption to 1-1.5 kg. The prices of vegetables are also high, it is becoming hard to manage kitchen, said Balkrishna D. Kadam, 53, a security guard who lives with his family of five in a chawl at Grant Road. Mr. Kadams monthly income is Rs. 8,000.The retail prices of tur and moong are touching Rs. 160 and Rs. 175 per kg. The all-India retail prices have hovered around Rs. 200 through June, only to settle at Rs. 198 per kg on June 21. I only cook dal once a week now. I now cook more dishes using potatoes, since even other vegetables are getting costly. I cant disturb the family budget, as it will now cost me Rs. 800 to Rs. 820 for the same consumption. I dont want to compromise with my childrens education or medical requirement of the family, said Ms. Kanchan Jalandariya, 42, a Grant Road resident.(With inputs from Sourabh Jain, Aditya Jain)"

Traders, brokers and workers have declared yet another indefinite strike, this time to protest against the government's decision to allow farmers to sell in the open market.Of the 600 truckloads of regular vegetable supply, only 100 arrived at the APMC on Monday . The shortage pushed wholesale prices to an all-time high, hitting the retail market hard. Some traders blamed heavy rain in Nashik for the shortfall. Others like Vashi trader Narendra Shelke claimed, ""Fearing losses due to the upcoming strike, farmers from Pune, Nashik, Satara, Sangli and Solapur stopped supplies to the APMC on Monday . Hardly 50 truckloads of outstation supplies and an equal number from across Maharashtra could reach the Vashi market, which pushed prices through the roof.""It is not clear what farmers will do with this pending stock of fresh vegetables, especially since it spoils easily during the monsoon. Logic dictates that they would despatch the produce quickly before the bandh begins and cut their losses.Consumers are furious that middlemen should continue their strike plan despite the dire situation.

In the 250-km-odd distance that the crop moves from villages near Nashik to your local sabziwala in Mumbai, the cost of one kg of onion goes up by close to 400% yes, from Rs 4/kg which a Lasalgaon farmer earns to Rs 18-20/kg which a consumer pays. That's the extent of commissions extracted by middlemen in the food chain.And it's not just the onion trade that sees such artificial inflation. Potato, tomato, green chilly, okra, you name it and pretty much everything in the market goes through a 50-100% increase in prices as it changes hands from one intermediary to the next (see graphic). The irony is that the farmer is the one who gets the lowest prices.So when the Devendra Fadnavis government decided on June 28 to allow growers to sell their produce straight to retail chains and other direct sellers, that's the rent-seeking system that it tried to dismantle. In one fell swoop, it did away with the monopoly of the Agricultural Produce Marketing Companies (APMCs) in every district which manage the marketyards where auctions are held by wholesalers and commissions earned on every transaction.Direct marketer Mahesh Shelke who runs Krushjeevan Agro, an enterprise in which farmers themselves are investors, says, ""Direct marketing companies and farmer producer organizations like ours have gained immense responsibility with the revised rules. More retailers will approach us to source vegetables in order to avoid paying commission to APMC . We know exactly which grower has how many hectares of farmland, what he grows and the quality and quantity of produce. Farmers will get a better price while retailers and consumers will not be burdened by commission either.""The agro economy still works in a way that leaves farmers at the mercy of local agents who decide which crops to grow and when. In the absence of cold chains and storage facilities, growers have to coordinate with them at harvest time. Demand and supply determine farmgate prices; in case of a bumper crop, the farmer has to strike a deal with the agent before he harvests the produce. Since he usually lacks storage space and as the crop is often highly perishable, like say tomato or okra, the agent fixes a suitable price and day on which the crop is picked and transported to the market. For his efforts he ends up earning an approximately 30-100% commission.The agent next strikes a deal with a local trader or ends up hoarding in the event of a dip in prices. In case of vegetables with a longer shelf life, say onion, potato or green chilly, margins tend to be smaller because risk of loss is lower. However, if it is a more perishable commodity such as tomato or okra, the intermediary has less elbow room to negotiate. But if he has control over supplies of a particular produce or stocks from a particular region, he can demand a higher price.Eventually, a deal is made and the goods reach the APMC where wholesalers earn a commission by arranging an auction for the trader. Retailers pick up the produce and wholesalers earn a fixed fee ranging from 6.5% for potato and onion to 8% for other vegetables and 10% for fruits. Now it is this stage of the food chain that the government has specifically sought to do away with.Henceforth, farmers or their agents or even the traders can sell directly to any agency or seller that they want to without paying commissions. But in case a retailer wishes to use the APMC to buy goods, he would have to pay the commission instead. Now this may in turn get passed on to consumers. Wholesalers and retailers have called a meeting with traders on Saturday to discuss the matter.Subhash Deshmukh, minister for cooperation and marketing said to TOI, ""There is some confusion over payment of tax (commission) but it is between the traders and retailers and not at the government level. That they have to sort out. If need be the government will intervene."""

That Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis has stood his ground against the powerful lobby of middlemen, who shut shop in protest, is even more commendable. The problem with the present regime, under which produce has to be sold through Agricultural Produce Market Committees, is that farmers seldom benefit from price movements; traders rake in the upside that consumers are forced to shell out. When onion prices soar, for instance, it is usually traceable to APMC mandis in Nashik. This reform could help check household food expenditure by cutting out high intermediary costs to an extent. But an even more critical objective is to make Indian agriculture a sustainable economic activity. Maharashtras move is pertinent as acute indebtedness among farmers in the State has become almost systemic over the past decade. If the Central government wants to double farmers incomes in five years (not an easy task even over a decade, going by official data from 2003 to 2013), several interventions are necessary, including better irrigation facilities, and the freedom to sell output where farmers get the best price. Fruits and vegetables are a good place to start dismantling monopolies of the sort that Indian industry was freed from 25 years ago. Despite a substantially lower acreage than crops such as cereals and pulses, they contribute a quarter of farm sector incomes. Estimates vary, but there is no denying that a significant chunk of horticultural produce just rots. That wouldnt be the case if farmers could sell easily to food processing units, or even directly to consumers via e-commerce channels.Breaking the stranglehold of APMCs must be accompanied with easier access to credit and market information services, for which farmers often rely on their captive buyers; there also needs to be a greater push for cooperative groups so that marginal and small farmers have adequate negotiating heft in a free market. Healthy competition among private traders and processing units, government procurement agencies and cooperative farmer-producer groups would improve price discovery from farm to fork. Going ahead, Maharashtra and other States also need to back the Centres ambitious plan unveiled this April to create an e-National Agriculture Market for 25 major crops. BJP-ruled or not, States must wrestle with vested interests and create more choices for the farmer and the consumer. Though seven States had already implemented the Centres June 2014 advisory to allow farmers to sell their horticultural produce anywhere instead of through APMCs, Maharashtras initiative is crucial as it has a larger agrarian economy with a greater impact on national food market dynamics."

We have, in turn, decided to meet the minister of state for co-operatives, marketing and textiles on the issue.""""We will decide about whether to start issuing licences to new traders only after the meet,"" he added.Meanwhile, the Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana, an association of farmers, staged a demonstration in front of the office of the traders' association in Pimpalgaon in protest against traders not calling off the strike when their counterparts from other state APMCs have already called off the stir and resumed auction of vegetables and other agri produce.According to the traders, open auction is held in the district APMCs and the produce are also auctioned loose. The traders have to spend more on grading and packaging of the produce. On the contrary, open auction is not held in other state APMCs and the produce is auctioned. Since auction in the district APMCs is more transparent, there should be a uniform norm for all APMCs across the state.There are a total of 15 APMCs in Nashik district. Traders from 14 APMCs, barring Nashik, have been on strike since July 9 against government's decision of delisting vegetables and fruits from the APMC Act and levying 6% commission on purchasers or traders, instead of farmers. On July 13, all state APMCs, except the district APMCs, had called off strike following a meeting with the state government in Mumbai. On July 14, the Nashik APMC called off the strike."

If early reports from both the directorate of horticulture as well as the Nashik-based National Horticulture Research and Development Foundation (NHRDF) are indicative, the kharif crop of onion seems to be heading south, which would result in a shortage in the market later on.Watch Video: Whats making newsThe July onion crop report prepared by NHRDF states that for the current kharif season (2016-17), farmers have lifted seed for about 10,000 hectares (Ha) area. Sowing of seed started after the onset of rains in Maharashtra. Even after good rains during the last 15 days, farmers are not preferring onion crop due to low prices prevailing in the markets, the report said.Around 1 lakh Ha of farm land is taken up in Maharashtra for Kharif onions. Last year had seen just 35,000 Ha of land under onion cultivation due to drought.

The UPA had left government in a serious state and it is but natural that any contesting candidate before election would say that if I come to power, I will try to bring inflation down. No one should have any objection to that.""Insisting that the Modi government had reduced inflation and kept it under control, the Finance Minister said he expects it to reduce further with a ""good"" monsoon.He acknowledged that high prices of pulses is a concern and said steps are being taken to address this by narrowing the mismatch between demand and supply.Noting that India has the highest production along with highest consumption of pulses, he said while the demand is for 23 million tonnes, the production was 17 million tonnes, leaving a gap of six million tonnes.The output of pulses is expected to go up to 20 million tonnes this crop year, Jaitley said, adding steps are also being taken by the Food Ministry to create a buffer of 20 lakh tonnes of pulses to keep the prices under control.He also criticised Gandhi for asking the Prime Minister to set a date by when the prices will come down, saying issues are settled through policies rather than giving dates.The government is working on policies to encourage farmers to produce more and India is moving towards self sufficiency in pulses produce, he said.""You are talking about a government which left behind double digit inflation and today we have a situation where steps have been taken in each sector to contain inflation. Any form of bluster is not a substitute for statistics. These are backed by hard facts,"" Jaitley said.Jaitley said the monthly statistics shows the pulses inflation is coming down and asked Rahul Gandhi not to look for corruption angle in the rise of prices of pulses, which he said occurred due to rise in costs globally besides two consecutive years of drought.""Even today the corruption scandals that emerge are those of UPAs and not NDA... We have contained inflation despite having two years of drought. Good monsoon helps economy and with good monsoon this year, I expect that the prices of will come down,"" Jaitley said.He said the UPA had left the economy in a dire state, with Consumer Price Index (CPI) and food inflation at double digit, WPI inflation around 6-7 per cent and growth prospects were limited.He cautioned UPA against indulging in ""back of envelop calculations"" regarding economic data stating it will only be ""misleading"".Taking a jibe at Gandhi for quoting market prices of essential commodities, Jaitley said in a lighter vein, ""everybody in this House seems to be claiming to go to market everyday"".He said in 2012-13 and 2013-14, which were the last two years of UPA regime, were marked by increasing prices and inflation data looked grim.The NDA government has brought down inflation and for 18 straight months, the country has witnessed negative WPI inflation, the Finance Minister said.Giving reply to members' concerns on how the government has utilised the gains on account of drop in crude oil prices, Jaitley said the gains have been utilised in three ways -- to help oil PSUs to reduce their losses on account of subsidy, to invest in infrastructure and benefit common people by enabling them to shell out less money in buying petroleum products.He said 42 per cent of the gains due to fall in global crude oil prices is shared with the states with the Centre retaining 58 per cent of the share.""It is because of these policies to shore up public investment that for two years in a row that India has emerged as the fastest growing economy. It is mainly because of public inbvestment and foreign investment that we are growing at a respectable rate, but we are not satisfied as we have greater potential,"" Jaitley said.""When the going is good, economies grow, but it is only when the going is challenging then the real challenge arises,"" he said.Countering Gandhi's remark that the UPA government had waived off farm loans, Jaitley said the NDA government's policies are not one-time and are instead more sustainable towards building rural infrastructure, irrigation facility and sanitation for upliftment of poor.""All these steps taken by the government will propel India to better economy,"" he said.Jaitley said July is the month when, due to seasonal factors, food inflation usually sees an upward trend and after the new crop comes, prices would fall.Terming as ""new economic equation"" Gandhi's remarks that prices of pulses should come down when MSPs are hiked, Jaitley said inflation is a matter of demand-supply mismatch.""This equation I have heard for the first time. The situation is that MSP of pulses is raised but production did not increase and there was two consecutive years of rainfall shortage,"" he said, adding this year rain Gods have been kind enough.He said there is demand for 23 MT of pulses this year while the output is 17 MT. The remaining 6 MT would be procured from Myanmar, Mozambique and Tanzania.The acreage data for the new crop year shows that the output will go up to 20 million tonnes and the government is working towards increasing the buffer stock to 20 lakh tonnes.With regard to sugar prices, Jaitley said the current price is reeling around Rs 33-34/kg and the government is working to lower it by Rs 1-2/ kg to ensure right price to consumers and better returns to farmers.He said sugar price had come down to Rs 22-23/kg and farmers were not able to get their cost back and sugar mills were on the verge of closing down. The total dues of farmers from mills have been brought down from Rs 27,000 crore to Rs 1,800 crore.When prices started going up to Rs 40 per kg, the government brought in export restriction and that cooled prices, the Finance Minister said.As regards onion prices, Jaitley said prices were lower till 3-4 months back and the Centre had to purchase 20,000 tonnes extra produce from farmers.Tomato prices, he assured, will come down after the monsoon season.Jaitley said the UPA government policies had led to a situation where global publications were talking about policy paralysis and exit of 'I' from BRICS grouping.""Private investment was weak, the state of economy was such that banking system's ability to support growth had come down,"" he said, adding that back of envelop calculations not necessarily forms part of good economic policies.Defending the move to hike excise duty on petrol and diesel when global crude oil prices were falling, Jaitley said at a time when global growth was witnessing slowdown and banks had limited capacity to lend, the government had no other option than to garner as much resources as possible to stabilise the economy.When oil prices slumped in the second half of 2014 and 2015, the government hiked excise duty on petrol and diesel nine times to mop up additional revenues that helped it meet ts revenue and fiscal deficit targets. In all, it raised excise duty on petrol by Rs 11.77 a litre and that on diesel by Rs 13.47 a litre.Participating in the debate, Saugata Ray (TMC) said the government's economic policies are based on two parameters-- windfall from crude prices and cess pool.He said the Finance Minister failed to provide a clear roadmap as to how it plans to bring down prices and instead he pinned his hope on good monsoon. He wanted to know why the government acts only after the prices have moved up.He said the Prime Minister, who had been meeting world leaders including US President Barack Obama and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, did not hold a single meeting on price rise.Hukmdev Narayan Yadav (BJP) said the opposition is frustrated with the government as it is taking several steps to bring back black money and hence they are trying to raise the matter of price rise in the House.B Mahtab (BJD) said both the Congress-led UPA and BJP-led NDA have failed to tame the demon of inflation.""Prise rise is symptom and inflation is disease"", he said, adding unless the government deals with inflation it would not be possible to contain inflation.Mahtab added that the government should deal with the supply side issues to contain inflation which has been adversely affecting the large section of population.Apparently referring to RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan, he said the person who has been trying to deal with inflation is now going back to Chicago because someone in the ruling dispensation has asserted that he was not a nationalist.Tariq Anwar (NCP) said before coming to power NDA leaders promised to bring down inflation but have nothing to contain price rise.Describing Jaitley's intervention during the debate as ""disappointing"", Anwar said people have no choice but to bear the burden of rising prices.Taking a dig at Modi's initiative to provide cooking gas to poor, he said, now the people have gas but nothing to cook as essential kitchen items are beyond his reach.He wanted to know why the government always fails to take advance action to deal with rising prices.Jayadev Galla (TDP) suggested that central government should have a separate budget for agriculture sector though it could very well merge railway budget with the general budget.He further said that government should consider including pulses in the ambit of the Food Security Act and increase food subsidy to 10 per cent of the GDP from a little of two per cent presently.BJP member Poonam Mahajan blamed the previous UPA governments for the price rise situation and said whenever Congress was in power inflation has gone up.Taking a swipe at Rahul Gandhi, she wondered how the 'yuvraj' (prince) did not know about the price situation when UPA was in power from 2004-2014.She said one day Rahul is having tea here and another day at Kalavati's home, which she termed as ""political tourism"".Gandhi had visited the home of Kalavati Bandurkar, the Vidarbha farmer widow in 2008, and had also mentioned about her in Parliament.Mahajan described Prime Minister Narendra Modi as 'Loh purush' (Iron Man)' and said the ""sleeping beauty who sleeps here is questioning the 'Iron Man',"" an apparent reference to the Congress Vice President.She said Congress had played politics with the slogan of 'Gharibi Hataao (eradicate poverty)' for a long time.Referring to her home state Maharashtra, she claimed that a large number of farmers committed suicide during the time of Congress governments.Shrirang Appa Barne (Shiv Sena) said the government has not been able to control the price situation even though efforts are being made. The government's priority should be to control price rise, which is affecting poor people the most, he added.Dharmendra Yadav (SP) said farmers have not received any benefit from price rise, adding that there does not seem to be much difference between Congress and BJP governments as under both of them farmers have been weakened.Jayprakash Narayan Yadav (RJD) cautioned that the ""tsunami of price rise"" is a bad signal for the government.Stating that mere use of sophisticated words cannot help in controlling price rise, A P Jithender Reddy (TRS) said lot of people are feeling the pinch. He also urged the government to ""bailout people"" from the clutches of inflation.M Rajamohan Reddy (YSR Cong) urged the government to put in place a comprehensive food pricing and management policy.Kaushalendra Kumar (JD-U), Riti Pathak and Uday Pratap Singh (both BJP) also spoke."

On an average, 2 lakh hectares come under kharif onion production, annually, in these three states and that includes 1 lakh hectares in Maharashtra alone.This year, a reduction of around 40 per cent in onion sowing area in the state would subsequently result in a dip in production in the months to come. The monsoon has picked up across the country, but lack of rainfall in June seems to be the major reason for this dip.In Maharashtra, the state government had issued advisories to the farmers and asked them not to start sowing till soil moisture content was 30-40 per cent. This, many say, has resulted in a drastic drop in the sowing area.Also high prices of maize, soyabean, pulses and vegetables has seen farmers using their farmland to grow these crops, instead of onions. Area under pulse production, in fact, has grown by 46 per cent in the state and many onion farmers have opted to grow pulses due to the good prices.Over the past five to six months, the onion trade has been going through a sustained slump with prices at an all-time low. This, despite a long period of drought which had actually seen a reduction in onion area at least in Maharashtra. Over the last month or so, onion trade in the Nashik district has been in the doldrums due to the ongoing strife between traders and the market committee.However, chances of an immediate price rise seems to be remote given the carry forward stock of onion the country has to deal with.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Moreover, onion plantation is yet to commence in the district. Onion plants are being created in nurseries, but its plantation has not yet started. Hence, it is clear that the harvest of kharif onions will be delayed by over a month, which may affect the supply in future thereby leading to scarcity.""The scarcity of onions resulted in sky-rocketing of the prices last year.

The decline is being attributed to the farmers' unwillingness to participate in the onion auction in gunny bags.The daily arrival of onions, which was around 12,000 quintals a day on an average at Lasalgaon before the strike of traders (July 9), has declined to the range of 2,500-3,000 quintals a day after the APMC resumed auction in gunny bags on insistence of the traders. Farmers, in turn, have to incur an additional expense of Rs 70 per quintal for each gunny bag. They have, therefore, demanded that the APMCstart with the onion auction in loose like before.In retail markets, onions prices have already increased to Rs 15 per kg against Rs 10 in the past few days due to decline in supply. The retail onion prices may increase further if the supply does not improved.Speaking to TOI, an official from Lasalgaon APMC said, ""Earlier, the daily onion auction at the Lasalgaon APMC was over 12,000 quintals per day. But it has declined to the range of 2,000-3,000 quintals after poor response from farmers to auction of onions in gunny bags. Only 10,840 quintals of onions were auctioned at the Lasalgaon APMC during the past four working days from Tuesday to Saturday (August 3 to 6), against the earlier onion auctions of over 12,000 quintals per day at Lasalgaon.""The average wholesale onion prices at Lasalgaon have already declined in the range of Rs 700-800 per quintal. The production cost for growing onions is Rs 1,000 per quintal and farmers suffer losses if they get prices to their produce below that. At this juncture, onion they simply cannot afford to incur additional cost of gunny bags.Presently, summer crops of onions are arriving in the market, harvested in March and April. Onions are already four months old get spoiled during rainy season. Moreover, farmers also require money to sow the Kharif crop, which has a shelf life of six-seven months. Farmers prefer storing this crop with the hope of getting better prices.According to sources, the supply of onions in the market has been affected as farmers are not bringing their onions for auction in protest against gunny bags. The farmers, who require money to manage expense of kharif crop, are bringing their produce to the APMC only."

On July 9, the traders had gone on an indefinite strike in protest against the government's decision. The onion trades called off strike on July 26 and started auction in gunny bags, instead of open bidding in loose or unpacked format.Onion auction in gunny bags incurs additional expenses of Rs 70 per quintal onion to farmers. Earlier, the farmers would pay 6% commission to agents, who facilitate accounts and payment between traders and farmers.

Heavy rain and insufficient storage facilities hastened the process.Officials in the marketing department say this translated into a loss of about Rs 100 crore to the farmers.The state government issued several notices to APMC members and traders to resume auctions. However, the traders added a new riderthey would buy onions only if they were packed in gunny bags. Currently, onions are sold in large trolleys, and using gunny bags would mean an additional cost of Rs 100 per bag, which was not feasible for the already loss-making farmer.""The traders' strike and addition of unreasonable riders for procurement has caused severe losses to the farmers. In fact the quantum of rotten onions is going up every day,"" said an official.Officials added that the price of onion this year has been very lowfarmers are forced to sell their produce at Rs 2 per kg, which doesn't even meet their cost of production.""The auction has resumed from tomorrow.

The result is a glut that made the vegetable dirt-cheap this monsoon.In Ratlam mandi, the price dipped to 20 paise a kg four months ago. Frustrated farmers abandoned onions, which were left to rot in quintals on roadsides. Identical onion rate were prevalent in the Neemuch market in mid-April. The state government stepped in, well aware of the role onions can play in politics as much as with the economy. Soaring onion price was a major factor behind the BJPs debacles in the 1998 assembly elections in Delhi, Raj as than and Madhya Pradesh when the party-led NDA ruled the Centre.A cautious chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan announced in early June the procurement of onions at Rs 6 a kg from farmersmany of whom were selling the crop below Rs 1 per kg. Never has the 1956-formed state bought a vegetable, authorities claim.The Madhya Pradesh State Cooperative Marketing Federation (MarkFed) purchased 10.40 lakh quintals of onions from farmers. Already loan-burdened, their woes continued. From remote areas, farmers transported onions to mandis, only to be rejected for poor quality. The state intervened again, and ordered all mandis to buy onions. But it was late.FRETTING FARMERSKallu Kurmi of Newada village in Rehli tehsil of Sagar district has half his onions rotting. Sagar mandi (50 km away) didnt take my produce, he says. Im left with 300 gunny bags of onions.This, despite Union minister for food Ram Vilas Paswan announcing in May the purchase of 15,000 tonnes of the bumper crop. MarkFed bought onions at Rs 6/kg. We did it till end-June, by when rains came and made storing difficult, says its managing director BM Sharma.Former state agriculture director GS Kaushal attributes the farmers plight to administrative shortsightedness .The government should have built storage facilities , he notes .They arent expensive for onions. In the end, traders, middlemen and corporate houses gain, points out Kaushal. The farmers sells onions cheap, the consumer buys it at high prices.OUT OF TUNE?Kausal notes that Maharashtra is the lone state that has worked upon providing storage facility to onion farmers. If Madhya Pradesh could spend more than Rs 60 crore on the purchase of this crop from the farmers, why cant it spend some amount on space to store onions? he asks. Not working in this direction, the expert says, only helps in to create a perpetual situation where farmers get less and consumers pay moremuch to the benefit of the links in between.Madhya Pradesh has not emulated a nearby state, where hoarding of onions beyond a stipulated limit is banned and punishable. The Te lang ana Onion Dealers (Licensing, Storage and Regulation) Order, 2016, warrants license to sell the crop and a minimum retail price for it.In July last year, the central government extended its ban on stockpiling beyond the stipulated amount to curb prices of onion. ICAR 2014-15 data ranks Madhya Pradesh as the third-largest oniongrowing stateafter Maharashtra and Karnataka. The central Indian state produced 28,42,000 tonnes of onion in 1,17,000 hectares of land.POLITICAL SHOTSThe Opposition Congress says the onion fiasco has exposed the government s failure in making agriculture profitable.Deepti Singh, the partys state spokesperson, said the Chouhan government failed to notice the need for stronger onion storage facilities despite knowing that the farmers had gone to sow the seeds in large scale .The laxity turned out to be nightmarish for the common people , she added.The partys MLAs walked out of the state assembly recently, flaying the government for selling onion at Rs 4 per kg when the market price was Rs 10.Party legislator Jaivardhan Singh alleged the government was not paying the farmers money for the onion sit purchased. You bought onion worth Rs 62 crore from 40,000 farmers, but paid them only Rs 23.95 crore, he told treasury benches.Minister of state for cooperatives Vishwas Sarang said the government sold 7,000 quintals of onions in two days. We floated tenders to sell onions, but got quotes as low as 60 paisa to Rs 3.16 per kg. That is why we sold onions at Rs 4/kg, he reasoned. The balance amount will reach farmers in a week or so.TOUGH TO DISPOSERecently, the government asked the district collectors, jail administration and departments running government hostels to buy onions. Some collectors ordered employees to purchase at least 50 kg of onion per head. MarkFed is to sell onions at fair-price shops across the state. There will be open auction, too. As of now, 7000-8000 quintals of onion is being disposed of daily, says Sharma. If onions have brought tears in the eyes of the farmer, the government is equally worriedthough for a different reason. For instance, not long ago, the Chouhan government faced allegations from the Delhi government over rise in the prices of this bulbous vegetable so essential to the cuisine of people of all classes.That was in 2013, when Haroon Yusuf, who was food and civil supplies minister in the Sheila Di ks hit cabinet, attributed the soaring onion rates in the national capital to deliberate hoarding by Madhya Pradesh. The minister went on to claim that it was done at the instance of the Delhi unit of the BJP for political gains ahead of assembly elections. The MP government rubbished the charge, calling it baseless."

The trader fixes the price of the produce through bid. The APMC does not have any control over the prices fixed through the auction process. The APMC can take action only in connection to commodities that have minimum support price, which is not applicable for onions.Activist Giridhar Patil told TOI, ""I think both, the state government and the traders, are accountable for the present situation. The state government delisted vegetables and fruits from the APMC Act despite not having a parallel market for farmers to sell their produce in place. Traders went on strike but the government did not take any action. Farmers, who had onions in storage, could not sell their produce for almost a month.""He added, ""The heavy rain and floods damaged the stored onions. Traders sold onions stored with them at the rate of Rs 1,000-1,200 per quintal last month when they were strike. Now, they have brought down onion prices at the time when farmers have huge stock of onions.""Deepak Pagar, president of Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana, blamed the traders for the current decline in onion prices. ""Traders are bidding low prices during auction. We have been demanding the state government to introduce Minimum Support Price (MSP) of Rs 2,000 per quintal for onions. The government increases Minimum Export Price (MEP) of onions when onion prices go up, but it did not take any measures when onion prices crash.""Nanasaheb Patil, director of National Agricultural Co-operative Marketing Federation of India Ltd (Nafed), said ""There has been excess onion production this summer. Large quantity of good quality onions are arriving in the market and traders are not showing any interest in buying medium or poor quality onions. The government had recently decided to procure onions from farmers through Nafed, but there has been no progress in this connection.""Sohanlal Bhandari, president of Nashik District Onion Traders' Association, said, ""The rise in supply compared to demand has led to decline in onion prices. There are still 10 lakh quintals of onions in storage in Maharashtra, including 2 lakh quintals in Nashik district. The country's annual demand is 1.75 crore tonnes and onions production was 2 crore tonnes. There was excess onion production of 25 lakh tonnes of onions this year. This is the reason onion prices have declined.""Bhandari added, ""The state government has already delisted vegetables and fruits from APMC Act. Hence, farmers can sell their produce anywhere even though they get minimum price offer from traders. It is not mandatory to farmers to sell their produce in APMCs as per the new norms."""

""It is a fact that the farmers are being compelled to sell even good quality onions for Rs 550-600 per quintal - which is much below the production cost.

The reason: the state government ignored repeated warnings about falling rate of onions due to surplus production.Nashik contributes to at least 70% of the onion production in the state. The surplus stock is rotting due to rainfall and poor storage facility, causing heavy losses to the farmers.Surplus production in most onion growing states, including Maharashtra, has led to drop in onion prices. According to the data from Lasalgaon APMC, till August 24 this year, the market received 1.6 lakh quintals of onion as against 60,000 quintals during the same period last year. At present, the rate of buying onions at the APMC is Rs 4-7 per kg, depending on the quality and grade. The Lasalgaon APMC sets the trend for onion prices in the country.The new harvest of onion is set to hit the market in October. Officials from the Lasalgaon APMC market, which gets at least 50% of Nashik's onion produce, said that the prices have dropped as most onion producing states like Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan have had a bumper crop. However, Maharashtra government didn't pay attention to the warnings by industry experts and no market intervention was made to stabilize the falling prices.""Last year, onion farmers got a good price and so the area under cultivation increased, and so did the yield. We had written to the government, seeking intervention, but didn't get any response,"" said Nanasaheb Patil, chairman of National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation.The state government's decision to buy onions from the farmers at market rate too will not help stabilise the market, experts said.""If the government buys at the same rate as the traders, what difference does it make?

The root causes should be investigated, and action must be taken against those who involved, Pawar said, reacting to a query on his take on demand for scrapping The SC and the ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, considering the Kopardi incident.The NCP chief was quick to add that the probe was on and therefore it would be inappropriate on his part to comment further. A 15-year-old girl was brutally raped on July 13, allegedly by three men, before throttling her at Kopardi village in Ahmednagar.Aurangabad and a few other cities recently witnessed huge rallies of members of the Maratha community to protest the Kopardi rape-murder incident. The demand for scrapping the Atrocities Act was raised during these marches.On Saturday, while addressing the foundation day of Yashwantrao Chavan Pratishthan here, Pawar had appealed for not politicising incidents of rape. There should be no political aspirations while dealing with rape incidents, he had said.Talking about crashing onion prices, Pawar blamed the state government for its inaction in resolving the issue. He said the state government was reluctant to buy onions from farmers under the Centre's market intervention scheme.""I was part of a meeting which was held in Delhi recently to resolve the onion crisis in Maharashtra... It was resolved that the NAFED should purchase onions from farmers and financial loss or profit would be shared in ratio of 50:50 by the Centre and the state. However, the state government has not consented for the same in writing, causing delay,"" Pawar said.Highlighting that farmers practising rainfed agriculture are mainly onion producers, the former Union agricultural minister sought immediate intervention from the government to resolve the issue of dwindling prices.Touching upon other issues, Pawar said it was wrong on the part of the government to delay release of water from Jayakwadi dam towards Majalgaon dam and other needy areas.""The government should not play with the lives of farmers. Please do not destroy farmers,"" he said.Referring to the recent arrests of a few persons from Marathwada for allegedly having terror links, the NCP chief said a group of people from non-political Muslim organisations have met him recently on the matter."

What we are asking is our right. How does this government decide that this much of money is sufficient as financial aid? Have they bothered to check ground reality? said Rajaram Fafale of Maralgoi village in Nashik district when The Hindu sought his reaction.Mr. Fafale was at Lasalgaon onion market with his 10 quintal onions, for which he received Rs. 220 per quintal or Rs. 2.2 per kilogram. Now I will get one rupee more per kg. What a relief, he said, with a touch of sarcasm.He is not alone in this outburst. Be it Bhanudas Kanade of Lauki or Milind Darade of Kopargaon, the fall in onion prices has hit farmers hard. People are outraged when prices go high. They think we make a windfall out of it. First of all, we get nothing; traders and middlemen do. Secondly, shouldn't the outrage be visible when prices hit rock bottom? asked Mr. Kanade.Mr. Darade made headlines a week ago after he sold his crop for 5 paisa per kilogram. He has laminated the receipt to show it to everyone. Why can't we get Minimum Support Price for onions? he asked.One of the major demands of farmers is an MSP for onions, like in the case of sugarcane. This, according to them, will ensure that their produce is not sold below a certain price.Nanasaheb Patil, a director with NAFED, said, When prices go up, the government increases export duty to stop export of onions. It makes us lose international customers due to random decisions. At times like this when production is in excess and prices have fallen, we are left with no international customer.(With PTI inputs)"

Her design was chosen as the best face of the national handloom brand run by the ministry of textiles from over 1,660 designers across India for its unique eco-friendly production and use of handloom fabrics and dyes.""It is by far the highest honor I have received in my career,"" said the former alumini of the national institute of fashion technology (NIFT), Mumbai.Her work focuses on using sustainable clothing fabrics like the khadi , organic cotton and ikat while utilizing natural dyes to colour the same. ""When I select any material for my designs, right from the fabric to the buttons and other accessories, I ask myself if it is eco-friendly. The accessories I use are handcrafted and made of sea shells, coconut shells, wood or terracotta. Since my raw material is handwoven and handcrafted, it takes fairly long to be produced,"" she said.Having an urge to contribute to society in her own way, she decided to focus on sustainable clothing. ""The philosophy behind my clothing line is to create 'Fashion with a conscience'; clothing that creates social improvement and environment awareness"".Under the brand 'Ninoshka', she created collections comprising of pure natural and organic fabrics and the use of natural dyes such as pomegranate, indigo, lac, marigold, onion peels, hibiscus, rose etc to give it a more natural and eco- friendly feel.Her collections also comprise techniques such as tie and dye, bandhani and shibori, and printing methods like Ajrak and Kalamkari.For this she works closely with rural artisans thus her garments mostly comprise of handloom fabrics such as Ikat, Khadi and Chanderi. Sharing her thoughts on the use of such products, she said, ""Handloom fabrics are created by human hands. It takes months, sometimes years to weave a few meters of fabric. For example, a Paithani saree of Maharashtra can take up to 18 to 24 months to weave depending on the complexity of the weave. In rare cases, it may even take three years to weave one saree. A Himroo fabric may take up to a week to weave just three inches of fabric. Khadi fabric is handwoven using yarn that is handspun. Ikat is another beautiful hand woven fabric wherein the yarn is first tied, then dyed and then woven to produce breathtaking designs. It is a painstaking process. By purchasing a product made of handloom, you are not only supporting a weaver, you are supporting his entire family; perhaps the entire community of weavers. You are supporting an age-old craft.""Asked what would she recommend people to wear for the Goan climate, she said, ""One can experiment with a variety of handloom fabrics such as khadi and malkha. Cottons can be worn in every season. Light weight cottons that dry quickly can be worn in the monsoons, whereas thicker, heavier cottons can be worn in winters. Linen is the most hygienic fabric and great for Goan summers. For a festive look, one can experiment with cotton silks and chanderis."""

Hence, we are of the view that the government needs to export onions through central agencies,"" said Nanasaheb Patil , director of the National Agricultural Co-operative Marketing Federation of India Ltd (NAFED).At present, the onion arriving in the market is the summer crop, harvested in March and April. The summer crop has a shelf life of six to seven months. Hence, farmers prefer storing onions with a hope of getting a better price. Onions arriving in the market are of four months old and the produce has started sprouting and rotting.Farmers have huge stocks, but the prices have declined significantly and they are unable to manage even a production cost. Now, fall has been in the range of Rs 200 to Rs 600 per quintal.R P Gupta, former director of Horticulture Research and Development Foundation (NHRDF), said, ""There had been an excess production this year. The onions arriving in the market are from the storage of farmers. The quality of onion has also deteriorated. The poor quality fruit is sold in the price range of Rs 200 to Rs 300 per quintal, while good quality onions are fetching Rs 600-Rs 700 per quintal. Moreover, the arrival of fresh Kharif crop has already started in Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. Hence, the average wholesale onion prices are expected to be at the same range for the next few weeks.""On the last working day on Friday (Sept 9), the average wholesale onion price was recorded at Rs 425 per quintal. The minimum and maximum prices were recorded at Rs 100 and Rs 632 per quintal, respectively at Lasalgaon APMC. The market was closed upto Monday (Sept 12) due to holidays. The market will reopen after three-day holidays on Tuesday."

After touching over Rs70 a kg last year, onion prices have come down to Rs10 to 14 a kg at vegetable markets. The bulk dealers at Kalamna agriculture produce market committee (APMC) yard are quoting rates in the range of Rs5 to 10kg.This is reported to be the worst ever glut in onions with prices touching rock bottom. Last month, government declared a bonus of Rs100/quintal for onion growers. Sources in the business say that the current rates were lowest in 3-4 years and have left the onion growers bleeding. Many could not even recover the cost of cultivation, say traders.Encouraged by high price it fetched last year, many farmers around Nagpur and Bhandara also went for the crop. This added supplies to the already overflooded market. The farmers at traditional onion growing centres had also increased the area leading to a glut. Many traders and even growers have begun selling bags of onions grown in nearby areas at roadsides around the city, said traders at Kalamna.According to Jaiprakarsh Wasani, the rates were ranging from Rs5 to 8kg. It is a fall of 10% within a week. Fresh crop from Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka has begun arriving while there still is a major backlog of previous season's stock from Maharashtra . There is no chance of prices improving in coming months, though a further reduction could not be predicted, said Wasani.""Farmers have been left with nearly 25% of the carry forward stock. The situation will worsen as fresh crop begins arriving, as there will be a less demand for the old stock,"" he added.A representative of from M/s Afzal Trading Company at Kalamna said there had been overproduction in almost all centres across the country. Lately even farmers around Nagpur have begun growing onions. With hardly any margins left at the current rates, many traders are preferring to sell such locally grown produce out of the market area, he said.There will be hardly any gap in arrivals this years. By Dussehra , onions from Dhule will being reaching the market followed by that from Nashik during the Diwali festival. This ruled out chances of rates firming up, said Wasani."

The procurement was done through the National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India Ltd (Nafed) and the Small Farmers' Agribusiness Consortium. ""Only 4,000 tonnes have been sent to Delhi and most of the stock has rotted. We have asked other states for their requirement, but not many have responded which has led to the deterioration of stocks,"" said a Nafed source.The buffer stock was to be used to stabilize onion prices in domestic market in case of scarcity and released if prices increased. The buffer stock was kept in storage centres at various places at Pimpalgaon, Lasalgaon and Kalwan. ""The wholesale rate of onion has slipped by 30% this week. It's less than Rs 400 per quintal now. The season is coming to an end but the government hasn't done anything to control the onion crisis in the last 5 months,"" said Jaydutta Holkar, from the Lasalgaon APMC market.The state government's decision to give a Rs 100 grant per quintal to onion farmers hasn't worked out yet, since the Centre, which is supposed to foot half the bill, has not approved the scheme.""Even as the state has announced the scheme, it was later found out that the central government doesn't have such a scheme and they will need to table the proposal in the Cabinet.

The traders halt and look over the merchandise. A market committee employee calls out the reserve price: 400! Eyes roll, unspoken words seem to pass between the traders. Then the bidding starts: 1! 11! 13! 17! In less than 30 seconds, the auction is over. The farmer gets 17 rupees over the reserve price, Rs.417 per quintal (100 kg). A pittance at any given time, more so now when compared to prices last year.A trader-controlled marketNo matter how united the farmers are, no matter how hard they fight for a better price, they turn into mute spectators in front of the traders when auction begins. The auction is dictated by the traders with money and considerable political clout. Traders decide the price, farmers accept it without protest.The market complex has a huge parking space for the lorries. Sometimes there are up to 1,000 vehicles at a time. The otherwise deserted place comes alive twice a day. The first auction of the day starts at around 10 a.m. and the second at 3 p.m. Depending on the number of vehicles, the auction can stretch from an hour to three hours.Once the rate is fixed, the group of traders moves immediately to the next vehicle. The farmer, left with the price decided by the group, starts collecting the onions he has dropped on the ground. An official from the market committee approaches him with a receipt, bearing the auction rate, traders name and farmers name. With a receipt in hand and onions in the vehicle, the farmer then proceeds to the godown where the weighing process takes place. As per the rules laid down by the market committee, the farmer must get the payment before the end of the day, which is largely followed.After the produce is dropped off at a shed in the complex, the traders take control of it. Workers start segregating the onions according to the quality and the packaging begins. Vehicles are loaded with the produce to be sent off to cities or to different States. Traders then get into a huddle to firm up the retail price of the produce  adding their profits  with nary a concern for the farmer and the price demanded by him. The operation is bloodless and smooth.Barely breaking evenWhile onion is one of the major crops in this belt, farmers also cultivate grapes, soya bean, sugarcane, and ginger. Speaking out against the cartel of traders is not easy when the farmer is dependent largely on the onion crop, as it may result in traders ganging against him (or her) by dropping rates for his produce.Official data from the Lasalgaon Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) says that this years prices  between Rs.500-Rs.800/ql., down from Rs.970-Rs.3,786/ql.  are the lowest in the last five years. This year, Rs.1,020/ql. (in June) was the highest rate given to farmers, compared to Rs.6,326/ql. in 2015-16, and Rs.2,626 in 2014-15.Growing onions costs between Rs.50,000 and Rs.80,000 per acre, and a cultivated acre yields not more than 100 ql. With this years average selling price at Rs.728/ql., an acres worth of onions would get the farmer around Rs.72,800. This sees some farmers barely break even; many lose money.Small wonder that Milind Darade, who owns 13 acres of land, is furious. This is the only industry where producers have no right to decide the price of their product, the onion farmer from Karanjgaon, Nashik district, says. Isnt it cruel? Shouldnt we get angry? The week before The Hindu caught up with him at the Saikheda sub-market committee, Darade was given a humiliating price for his produce: Rs.5/ql., or 5 paisa/kg. If that was not bad enough, Maharashtras Minister for Co-operation, Subhash Deshmukh, said on a live television show that his onions were rotten. Let me give you some information, he says indignantly, this is the onion you eat at a restaurant. Just peel off two layers and you would wonder whether it was really rotten.Darade has preserved the official paper from the market committee with the offered rate; he has laminated it to ensure it doesnt get dog-eared. He says that he was so angry that he refused to sell his onions and brought the load, some 10-11 ql., back to his farm to use as fertiliser. But, he says, When I calmed down, it dawned upon me that I must use it to highlight the plight of onion farmers.Supply-demand mismatchSimplistically put, there was a shortage last year, and this year has seen record onion cultivation. Abundant supply has brought the prices down. The farmers, though, are used to this kind of fluctuation. They dont blame the bumper crop and supply-demand equation; they say its the traders who are conspiring against them and the government has done little  or the wrong things  to help.To understand the current crisis for farmers, we need to step back a little.India has three onion crops a year. Early kharif (the crop sowed in the monsoon) onions come to market between October and December. Onions from the rangda, or late kharif, crop arrive from January to March. The winter or rabi crop is up for sale from April to May. Usually, some parts of the rabi crop are stored for a few months to fill the gap from May to October. Traditionally, prices rise from July to October; official data show that wholesale rates rise by as much as Rs.1,000/ql., even Rs. 1,500, later reflected in the retail market with an increase of Rs.5-Rs.10/kg for consumers.In 2014-15, the onions took a hit following a hailstorm in North Maharashtra which, in turn, affected their storage value. With many rotting, the onions that did make it to market commanded high prices.Then the drought of the summer just past played a role too; many sugarcane farmers switched to the less thirsty onion this year. The onion cultivation area in the State has almost doubled in year 2015-16, says Nanasaheb Patil, Director, National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India Ltd. (NAFED). Farmers hoped that they will get last years rate  close to Rs.3,000-Rs.4,000/ql.  which did not happen, as production increased in huge proportions.India is the worlds second-largest onion producer (after China) with 26.79 per cent of the planets land under onion cultivation and 19.90 per cent of its production. Maharashtra is Indias largest producer, with a 32.45 per cent share of total onion production, and in turn, Nashik district in north Maharashtra accounts for with 41 per cent of the States onion harvest. According to the Directorate General of Commercial Intelligence and Statistics (DGCIS), India produced 203.33 lakh metric tonnes (MT, 1,000 kg) of onions in 2015-16, up from 189.28 lakh MT in 2014-15. Lasalgaon, Asias biggest onion market, received around 32,680 MT in the previous fiscal year. Five months into this year, it has received 10,874 MT.To make matters worse for Maharashtras farmers, other States  notably Gujarat, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka  have reported higher onion yields.Holding on for a better dayAside from the production glut, another important factor was a 40-day strike by traders in July and August, opposing the State governments decision to free agricultural market committees from government regulations. With no outlet for their rabi onions, farmers had no option but to store them and wait for the strike to end. In addition, thanks to the low prices, some farmers are choosing to not bring their onions to the markets, and instead are storing them away hoping an artificial scarcity later in the year will pay off for them.This strategy, however, comes with its own dangers: that of the crop rotting or the onions sprouting. Malti Bodke of Bhuse village points to her rotten onions with disgust. How long can we store them? Its been almost four months. Once the onions start sprouting, they lose weight, and it becomes difficult to get a higher price.The farmers also say that the traders are colluding to cheat them. Its a cartel of traders which decides the rates and once the market reopened, they ensured prices didnt cross Rs.1,000/ql., says Rajaram Fafale, from Maralgoi village.The strike gets blame for the glut. But did trade actually stop? Officials and traders seem to want consumers to believe that, but farmers say it never really stopped. Darade says that opportunistic traders discreetly approached farmers and quoted lowest possible rates. Farmers, thinking it was better to sell, even at a low price, rather than keep them and let them rot, did sell.Three years ago, when the farmers were getting Rs.4,500-Rs.5,000/ql., retail onion prices reached Rs.90/kg., which resulted in protests from the then-opposition parties, as well as consumer organisations, in Delhi, Mumbai and other major cities, accusing the United Progressive Alliance government of failing to protect consumers.The governments first step was to increase the Minimum Export Price (MEP) to $1,150/MT. This made it difficult for Indian exporters to compete in international markets; whatever stock was available was diverted to the domestic market, which brought prices down. By March 2014, when the late kharif crop got to market, prices had dropped to less than Rs.1,000/ql. in the wholesale market, and consumers got theirs at Rs.20-Rs.25/kg.This may have played out well for consumers, but has had other consequences for the industry. There is absolutely no consistency in our approach towards onion exports, says NAFEDs Patil. A look at MEPs between December 2010 and December 2015 bears him out: the figure has fluctuated wildly, dropping to $0 in May 2012, and with a high of $1,150 in November 2013. It only enrages our customers overseas, says Patil. They are left with absolutely no guarantee of quantity and price of onions exported from India. These customers have instead chosen Pakistan, China and Iran, and we have lost guaranteed markets.Patil says that the governments decision to placate enraged urban customers has lost it both its farmers support and its overseas markets. The onion, he says, is no longer an agricultural commodity, it has become a political symbol.An MSP for onions?Assuming the government has to balance the needs of consumers with those of producers, what else could it have done to ensure that farmers get some return on their labour?The National Horticulture Research & Development Foundation (NHRDF) keeps track of potential harvests by collecting information on each district. This year, despite being aware of the possibility of a bumper crop, the government appears to have failed to take any measures to protect farmers. The NHRDFs estimates say the rabi onions should be selling at around Rs.818/ql., which is significantly higher than what farmers are managing to get. If the government chose to use its Price Stabilisation Fund, it could subsidise the crop, paying, say, Rs.500/ql.What the State government has announced this week by way of relief  Rs.100 per quintal, up to a maximum of 200 quintals, or a maximum of Rs.20,000  has, to put it mildly, failed to enthuse farmers. Every farmer The Hindu spoke to called the measure not just inadequate but practically a mockery of their plight.Fafale, who sold 10 ql. at Lasalgaon for Rs. 220/ql., or Rs 2.2/kg., greeted the news with scorn. Now I will get one rupee more. What a relief! he says sarcastically. We arent begging in front of the government. What we are asking is our right. How does this government conclude that this much of money is sufficient as financial aid? Who advises them? Have they bothered to check the ground reality?One of the major demands the farmers have is for the government to introduce a Minimum Support Price (MSP) for onions, as it has for sugarcane. Why dont the officers understand that we are not independent and traders enjoy a free run here? says Darade. Unless an MSP is announced, we cannot be sure of a certain minimum profit. Why this neglect?Western Maharashtra, the States sugar belt, has seen, in recent times, sugarcane farmers agitating for an increased MSP. It became an electoral issue in 2014 when the Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) suffered major defeats in the Assembly polls in the region considered a bastion for both.The Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana (SSS; its name means organisation for farmers self-respect), led by Raju Shetti, which was in the thick of the agitation, is now part of the State government and Shetti is an MP. While the SSS has stage limited protests in the States onion belt demanding an MSP, it has not been able to take the protests to a wider audience. With the Bharatiya Janata Party-Shiv Sena regime, as with the previous Congress-NCP rule, the MSP for onions issue is far from being solved.In the village of Bhuse, Ramdas Bodke, 65, is philosophical. I have seen many seasons and farming has never been easy. We know how to tackle nature. What do we do with man-made problems? We farmers feed the world, but now we wonder whether we will have food cooked at home. He lapses into silence for a minute, and then his tone turns bitter: Did the government discuss its proposal to hike MLA salaries for even a day? The government takes an instant decision to increase the salary of MLAs, but it takes a long time to decide about farmers. This is injustice. But there is no one to give justice to farmers.As for the urban consumers and their agitations, farmers mince no words when the topic comes up for discussion. Turning towards me, one of them asks, You get agitated when prices skyrocket, but have you ever wondered what happens when prices hit rock bottom? Why dont you come out on the streets demanding a fair price for us?I have no answers.Abundant supply has brought prices down. But farmers say traders are conspiring against them and the government has done little to help"

Despite their desperate attempt to get a last glimpse of him, the coffin remained sealed and his relatives inconsolable.As the pall bearers moved ahead to lift the coffin kept in the open space outside the house where Sandeep used to play as a child and grew up as a teen, his relatives tried to prevent them.The coffin was finally brought to the cremation ground in the Vaikunth Rath, followed by over 2,000 people - young and old alike who have several stories of their favourite hero to share. But most remained silent as their voices choked to utter even a few words.At the cremation ground, the atmosphere was all about grief and anger as over 10,000 people gathered on the banks of the Dev River shouting slogans such as Vande Mataram and Bharat Mata Ki Jai. All this while the Indian Army prepared to salute the departed soul at 11.20pm.A long silence swept over the crowd as the soldiers fired three rounds in the air. No sooner had the echoes of the gunshots fallen silent than the air reverberated with a deafening cry of Sandeep Thok amar rahe. And as Yogesh got ready to light the pyre, their father Somnath said, ""Stop it. The government has to take some strong action to stop jawans from being sacrificed.""But by then, the pyre was lit and the fire and smoke had enveloped the grief and anger in the air.Martyr Sepoy Sandeep Somnath Thok, the 24-year-old resident of Khadangali village, Sinnar taluka, killed in Uri Sector of Jammu on Sunday morning attack by terrorists, was laid to rest amidst angry family members still struggling to come to terms with the death of their beloved son.After the body wrapped in the coffin and draped in tricolor reached home at around 9.45 pm, the parents and the relatives tried their best to get the glimpse of Sandeep. The coffin was sealed and the parents cherished the glamorous face of Sandeep smiling through many of his photos in the house and the ones that were kept near the coffin kept on the trolley of the tractor.Parents, brother and two sisters, relatives and friends were inconsolable.As the pall bearers moved ahead to lift the coffin in the open space outside the house in the farm - where Sandeep played during his childhood and toiled during his teens - the family members tried to resist them from taking the body.Later the body was shifted in the Vaikunth Rath, which - followed by about 2,000 people - tracked the route to the cremation ground. It was the last ride for Sandeep, even as the young and the old - who had seen him jumping, playing, teasing and helping colleagues, relatives and all during all these times, lost control over themselves.At the cremation ground the atmosphere was highly charged with over 10,000 people gathered on bank of Dev River in Sinnar taluka, shouted 'Vande Mataram', 'Bharat Mata Ki Jay' and 'Pakistan Murdabad'. As Sandeep was being carried and army prepared to salute the departed Jawan at 11. 20 pm the crowd went dead silent.Three rounds were fired. After the salute a loud cry of 'Sandeep Thok amar rahe' pierced through the atmosphere and equally thunderous from the crowd that went on as the pyre was prepared, coffin laid and the elder brother of Sandeep, Yogesh Thok lit the pyre.The only thing that Sandeep's father said, ""Stop it. (Govt should) Take some strong action (against Patkistan) to stop it (jawans being sacrificed) at once"", as the crowd began to disperse.Amid slogans in his praise by thousands of emotional villagers and family members, the mortal remains of Army jawan Sandip Somnath Thok, who was martyred in the Uri terror attack, were consigned to flames at his native place here.The body of 24-year-old Sandip, who is survived by parents, elder brother Yogesh and two married sisters, was yesterday brought to Ojhar Airport in Nashik district in an IAF plane from Srinagar and then taken to his native Khadangli village by road last night.His parents, relatives and villagers broke down on seeing the valiant soldier's body.A procession was also taken out in the village as state Rural Development Minister Dadaji Bhuse, District Collector Radhakrishnan B, Sub-Divisional Officer Mahesh Patil, Tehsildar Manoj Khairnar and others paid rich tributes to the martyr.Sandip, whose father Somnath is an onion farmer, had joined the Army in 2014 after repeated attempts. Ten youths from the village are serving in the armed forces.The jawan was bid farewell amid chants of 'Bharat Mata Ki Jai' and 'Sandeep Thok Amar Rahein' by grief-stricken villagers as his mortal remains were cremated late last night with full military honours.Besides Sandip, three other bravehearts from Maharashtra -- Chandrakant Shankar Galande from Satara, Vikas Janardhan Kulmethe (27) from Yavatmal district and Panjab alias Vikas Janrao Uike (26) from Amravati -- were among the 18 jawans killed in the Uri terror attack.Heavily armed militants, suspected to be from Pakistan-based JeM, had on Sunday stormed an Army base at Uri in Kashmir, killing 18 jawans.

Express At present, Nashiks Lasalgaon is the largest onion market in the country. ExpressIn what can be termed as the second phase of agricultural reforms in Maharashtra, the state government has decided to start a terminal market in Aurangabad. Maharashtra Minister of Cooperation Subhash Deshmukh Thursday announced that the state government would also establish the first-ever special commodities market for onions at Solapur soon. By definition, terminal markets sit at the top of the markets and has special facilities for grading and separating of agricultural commodities. Such terminal markets are expected to cater to export, domestic, wholesale as well as retail markets.Termed as zero garbage market, the basic difference between normal markets and these markets is that the latter are called zero garbage markets  no wastage  as goods enter the market sorted and graded.The terminal market in Sambhajinagar (Aurangabad) would be constructed in a private-public-participation (PPP) mode and would be established over 50 acres of the market committee, he said. Deshumkh said the tender process and bidding would start soon and the project would be completed at war footing.On paper, export-oriented terminal markets bring in good handling and business practices in the field of agricultural goods. With its insistence on grading and packing, wastage is minimised. These markets are mostly run on the hub-and-spoke model and executed in a public-private-partnership mode. The proposed market in Aurangabad would be the fourth such market being planned in the state. A few years ago, the state government had planned for three such markets in Mumbai, Nagpur and Nashik but none of the projects has seen the light of the day.All three previous markets had faced land issues which had acted as the major impediment towards them being set up.The Mumbai market was to be set up over 100 acres and was budgeted at Rs 250 crore. However, the land allocated to the market was confiscated by the revenue officials on grounds of legal technicalities and the matter is pending before the Thane additional collector.Similarly, the Nashik market was to be set up over 60 acres at a cost of Rs 60 crore and the Nagpur market was to be set up over 100 acres at Rs 50 crore. Both Nashik and Nagpur faced issues over land and failed to take off.Special commodities market is a market which caters to a single commodity (in the case of the one being planned at Solapur, it is onion) and provides various infrastructure and technology to promote both export and domestic trade.Nashiks Lasalgaon market is the largest onion market in the country, Deshmukh said, adding the Solapur district also had a strong onion growing belt and the government wished to develop the same. Annually, Solapur market sees a trade of over 45 lakh tonnes in onions.Dilip Mane, the chairman of the Solapur Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC), however, expressed doubts about the viability of the project. The existing trade itself is in jeopardy any new market will find it difficult to take off, he said.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

But as 150 truckloads of onion from Bailhongal, Vijayapura, Bagalkot and Dharwad arrived at the market a short while later, the prices nosedived to Rs 100-600 per quintal.Angry farmers blocked the market gates in protest, but APMC secretary Srinivas assured them that the prices would be fixed as per the quality of the produce.Farmers from Belagavi and the surrounding districts prefer the APMC here as they get good prices for their produce and the payment is made accurately.The trading is carried out after the produce is weighed. This helps farmers calculate the amount they would get for their produce.Chetan Patil, a trader, said he was yet to exhaust the stock he had procured from onion growers in Maharashtra during the previous season, and was hence unable to purchase the fresh produce from North Karnataka in the current season.The onion from Maharashtra has a longer shelf life than the one from Karnataka, and traders can stock the produce in large quantity. But the onion from Karnataka is preferred for export, Patil said."

(Express Photo: Nirmal Harindran) Sangharsh Dongre with his father Tau Trimbak Dongre at their farm in Adhegaon village, Solapur. (Express Photo: Nirmal Harindran)Sangharsh Trimbak Dongre completed his Bachelor of Engineering from the S K N Sinhgad College of Engineering at Pandharpur in Maharashtras Solapur district in 2015. His family, which farms 12 acres at Adhegaon, a village in the rain shadow Mohol taluka of Solapur, spent Rs 7 lakh for his four-year undergraduate degree in mechanical engineering.More than a year later, the 24-year-old is yet to find a job and has gone back to farming. His sole consolation: Only one out of the 189 who passed out of my batch has managed to land a job at Tata Motors. The next batch, too, has graduated this year and they are all jobless like us.Watch what else is making newsSangharsh was among the lakhs of aspirant educated rural youth from the Maratha community who took part at a rally in Solapur on September 21. Such mammoth rallies have been taking place in towns and cities across Maharashtra all through this month. A central demand in these protests  by peaceful, but angry young men and women  has been reservation quotas for Marathas in government jobs and educational institutions.At the heart of the unrest is an agrarian crisis stalking Maharashtras rural countryside, stemming from shrinking landholdings over time and magnified by the back-to-back droughts and price crash  whether ofsugarcane, cotton and soybean or onion and milk  over the last two years. Coupled with the overall bleak jobs scenario and inability to cope with the high cost of education in private professional colleges, it has stoked discontent amongst the community that is being reflected in the spontaneous street actions now.Sangharshs engineering education  as of many others from his background who saw investment in higher professional studies as a passport for a future beyond agriculture  was financed largely by a loan of Rs 4 lakh from the State Bank of India. His younger brother, Vinayak, is doing his first year of BHMS (Bachelor of Homeopathic Medicine & Surgery) at Sataras Sawkar Homeopathic Medical College, yet another private educational trust institution. The annual expenditure, at Rs 1.10 lakh, is lower than the Rs 1.50 lakh or so incurred for Sangharshs degree, though the course here is of four-and-a-half years followed by one year of internship.We chose BHMS because admission to a regular medicine (MBBS) course would have entailed donation of Rs 15-20 lakh on top of annual fees of Rs 4-5 lakh. Also, we decided not to go for any loan and fund from our own incomes and savings, says Sangharsh. That hasnt been easy for the family of four  including his father Tau Trimbak Dongre and mother Savita  exclusively reliant on agriculture.Till 2012, Sangharshs father grew sugarcane before shifting to pomegranate due to uncertain availability of irrigation water. Our average net yearly income has been Rs 2.5-3 lakh. The last two years have been particularly bad because of the monsoon totally failing. Although pomegranate requires less water compared to sugarcane, we have had to use tanker water for irrigation even in this case, complains Sangharsh.The familys agricultural woes, combined with the zero returns from investment in an engineering degree, have been an obvious source of frustration. All through this difficult period, Sangharsh has kept touch with his erstwhile college colleagues through a WhatsApp group, which they use to exchange notes and information on prospective job openings. Hes also part of a separate 250-member group linked to the ongoing pan-Maharashtra Maratha protests.Sangharsh relates to both the key demands expressed in the protests: Scrapping the SC & ST Prevention of Atrocities Act (which is used to harass ordinary farmers like my father), and reservations for Marathas in government educational institutions (how can we afford expensive private education with the meagre income generated from our farms?).At every rally  from Pune, Ahmednagar and Solapur to Aurangabad, Jalna, Beed, Latur, Nanded, Hingoli, Buldhana and Amravati  the emotive plank that has united rural Marathas is reservation. The Maratha Kranti Morcha (MKM), the organisation spearheading the massive muk or silent marches, has sought to highlight the economic backwardness of the community, even though it is considered socially forward by virtue of owning much of the agricultural land in Maharashtra.We constitute a third of the states population, but three-fourths of our people are still engaged in farming where incomes are uncertain. Investment in education is the only way to secure the future of our children. That is, however, beyond the means of most rural households, points out Sachin Gaikwad, an MKM activist and sports director at the Brahmdevdada Mane Institute of Technology in Solapur.Bhanumati Pawar, who was present at the rally in Nanded where the women outnumbered men, is most concerned about the high cost of private education. If my son gets admission in any private engineering college, the minimum fees would be Rs 1.5 lakh a year. If he can secure a seat through quota in a government institution, our financial burden will reduce considerably, observes this 45-year-old, who cultivates 10 acres at a village in the outskirts of Nanded.The irony is that many of the private education institutions dotting the state are promoted by Maratha politicians, mainly from the Opposition Congress and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP). Prominent names include D Y Patil, Patangrao Kadam, Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil, Rajesh Tope and Balasaheb Thorat, each of them controlling education trusts or deemed universities running a chain of engineering, medical, pharmacy, management and other professional course colleges.These institutions were originally the offshoots of cooperative sugar mills, dairies and banks that came up across rural Maharashtra from the mid-fifties to the eighties. The founders were mostly grassroots Maratha leaders, who used the cooperatives both as vehicles for development of their regions and also for furthering their political interests. Education was an extension activity, which unfortunately degenerated into a money-making business. The public trusts that many of these leaders created effectively become private family-controlled institutions, admits a former NCP minister, who himself controls one such cooperative-cum-educational empire near Pune.The politically dominant Maratha leaders well-versed with agricultural issues are themselves responsible for the backwardness of our community, alleges Ashok Prataprao Patil, a farmer from Chakur in Latur district.According to official data, Maharashtra has 19 government and government-aided engineering institutions with an annual student intake capacity of 6,097. On the other hand, there are as many as 348 such unaided (private) institutions with an aggregate intake capacity of 1,47,770. The picture is practically the same in every other technical stream, barring medicine where the private sector has comparatively less presence.The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party-Shiv Sena administration has been sympathetic to the Marathas demand for reservations both in education and jobs. Chief minister Devendra Fadnavis has declared his governments commitment to grant reservation to the community, while noting that the students from rural areas are restless, as they cannot afford the higher fees in private colleges.At the same time, though, Fadnavis has drawn attention to the fact that even a 16 per cent quota in government engineering institutions would translate into just over 900 seats. Equal, if not more, emphasis should be laid on skill development and providing new avenues for employment in rural-based industries. The state government is working on a scheme for skill development linked to the setting up of district-level hubs for textile, food-processing and allied industries. The proposed project also aims at roping in private partners for training of rural youth, who can find employment in the units that would come up in these hubs.That, of course, is a more durable solution to a problem with both short- and long-term implications.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

They rose to Rs 850-900 during April-June, which would have just about covered his inputs costs, but not theexpected returns from storing the crop harvested in March.But then came the shocker. Prices, which should have gone up in the lean season, actually started falling. For the current month, the modal price  the rate at which most sales have taken place  at the Lasalgaon market has averaged Rs 421 per quintal, below even the Rs 706, Rs 829 and Rs 844 levels for the preceding three months. Ushir realised a mere Rs 210 per quintal for the five quintals that he sold last in late-August. Worse, after all that, he still has 80 quintals left to sell.Ushir has, since Tuesday morning, been on a fast unto death at the office of the Nashik district collector. He has been joined by 100 other farmers, who are doing a sit-in to draw attention to the plight of growers in this onion belt.Popat Ushir (second from left) sitting on a fast unto death at the Nashik collector office. (Express Photo: Partha Sarathi Biswas) Popat Ushir (second from left) sitting on a fast unto death at the Nashik collector office. (Express Photo: Partha Sarathi Biswas)We will continue this agitation till two of our demands  a minimum support price of Rs 1,950 per quintal for onion and a subsidy of Rs 500 per quintal to farmers against their sales till rates stabilise in the open market  are met, said Santosh Gorade. This farmer, from Takali Vinchur in Niphad taluka, had stored 140 quintals from his 1.5 acres, more than half of which got rotten. The balance crop he sold mostly at Rs 250-300 per quintal, while realising a maximum rate of Rs 459 in July.This has never happened  prices in August-September being lower than in April, pointed out Bhaskar Gavali from Bramhangaon Vinchur, a village in Niphad. Farmers like him stock the rabi season onions harvested from end-March in sheds  basically on-farm structures constructed on raised platforms to prevent direct contact of the bulbs with the soil. Rabi onions, unlike the kharif (arrivals during October-November) and late-kharif (January-March) crops, are amenable to storage because of their lower moisture content. A dry, heat-protected and well-ventilated environment ensures no sprouting or rotting, while allowing farmers to realise better prices during the off-season before the kharif crops arrival.The kharif and late-kharif crops make up roughly a fifth each of Indias total onion production, with the remaining 60 per cent coming from the rabi season.Last year, the average modal price at Lasalgaon  a benchmark rate-setting market for the country  rising from Rs 1,093 per quintal in April to Rs 1,198 in May, Rs 1,554 in June and Rs 2,118 per quintal before scaling stratospheric heights of Rs 4,100-plus in August-September. It led to the Centre imposing a minimum export price (MEP) of$ 700 per tonne on August 23. As a result, exports ground to a halt. By the time the MEP was removed on December 23, prices had crashed to Rs 1,000 per quintal. And with the high prices in August-September inducing farmers to plant more area, the countrys onion production rose by 11 per cent to an estimated 210 lakh tonnes in 2015-16. Prices, then, fell instead of rising in the off-season.The average modal price for this month (Rs 421/quintal) is the lowest for September in a decade. And with the kharif crop from the South starting to arrive, prices may go still lower, predicted Jaydutt Holkar, chairman of the Lasalgaon Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC).The brunt of it is being borne by farmers. The present price will not cover even transport cost to the mandi. It is better from us to simply discard the crop and plough it back to the field, stated Gavali, who had stored 180 quintals of rabi onions from 1.2 acres, hoping for a minimum price of Rs 1,200 per quintal. Instead, the maximum rate he has realised over the last six months is Rs 850.The Centre has responded by announcing a 5 per cent export subsidy on onions, with the Maharashtra government also providing a Rs 100 per quintal grant to all farmers who sold the bulb in APMC mandis from July 1 to August 31. This will hardly help, as the markets in Nashik operated for only 24 days during this period due to the APMC traders strike. In any case, what was the point allowing just a two-month window when it is the stored onion crop that is arriving? asked Holkar.About 20,000 farmers are estimated to have sold nearly 3 lakh quintals in the Lasalgaon market during the two months, making them eligible for payments of Rs 3 crore. Back in 2008, the Maharashtra government had declared a similar subsidy of Rs 50 per quintal following a glut. However, the subsidy was given for January-March and 16,288 farmers received Rs 6.75 crore for the 13.5 lakh quintals sold during the full three-month period then.Farmers this time deserved at least Rs 500 per quintal subsidy and these should have covered sales during June-August, added Holkar.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

While onions are selling for for Rs. 2 - Rs. 6 in the wholesale market and averaging Rs. 12 in retail outlets, a kg of tomatoes is going for a relatively high Rs. 25 a kilo.Based on the trading price last season, farmers changed their crop patterns growing more onions and fewer tomatoes, leading to an imbalance in the supply-demand cycle. This, in turn, has affected prices, say traders.The crash in onion prices is the result of glut in the market. Last year at this time, onions were selling at Rs. 60 to Rs. 80 a kg. However, traders say that the high prices onions fetched last year is the precise reason why this year has seen rates plummet. Its a cycle. Following the high prices for onions last year, the acreage of onions has increased many fold this year across regions in Maharashtra, North Karnataka and Chitradurga. We have also seen a good crop across regions and the market is being flooded with onions, resulting in the crashing prices, said Ravi Kumar, of Bangalore Potato and Onion Traders Association, APMC, Yeshwantpur.Cauvery issueThe Cauvery dispute also played a role in this scenario. Tamil Nadu is one of the major buyers of onions from Karnataka. However, owing to Cauvery dispute, the movement of goods was disrupted, taking away a major market, which has further led to the crash, Mr. Kumar added.The situation is so bad that many farmers in North Karnataka are not even harvesting the crop, for that will only add to their losses. Despite having a good yield, several of them are forced to leave the crop as it is and plough the farmland so that it can become manure for the next season in Hubballi and surrounding districts.With tomatoes, the situation is the exact opposite. Following a period of prices that were as low as Rs. 6 a kg in the wholesale market, tomatoes are now selling at Rs. 25 in the wholesale market and Rs. 30 in the retail market.A senior procurement officer with a prominent retail chain in the city said that following the low prices during the last crop, many farmers in Kolar and Devanahalli belt did not grow them this season. Tomato is a three month crop.Muniswamy Gowda, a farmer in Devanahalli, who has planted tomatoes said that the acreage had reduced by more than 70 per cent for the present crop in his area, and has fetched him a good price.Furthermore, the lack of rain and humidity has brought down the quantity of the crop resulting in climbing rates for the available crop, said N.N. Sriram, a tomato cultivator in Kolar."

In Nashik's retail markets, onions were sold at Rs 10 per kg.

(Express Photo: Narayan Pawle) Flooded fields below the bridge connecting Latur to Renapur in Maharashtra. (Express Photo: Narayan Pawle)Through much of September, Sopan Garje of Dadegaon village in Beed districts Ashti taluka, was quite a content man. President of a farmer-producer company, a festive Diwali seemed around the corner for his group of farmers cultivating nearly 1,000 acres of moong (green gram) and urad (black gram).But towards end-September, the water body not far from their village adjoining the Kada Medium Irrigation Project suddenly filled up to 40 per cent capacity, after having been practically bone dry for months. I knew something was wrong, says this progressive farmer in his 40s, who uses every available agro-met service to plan his cropping schedule.WATCH VIDEO|Fortunately, it was raining heavily in just the five-km area around the Kada project, covering Dadegaon and nearby villages. Garjes group managed to harvest their urad and moong crops in the nick of time. But just a few days later, his own onion crop got washed away. Other group members similarly saw their soyabean crops suffer severe damage from the torrential rains through the first week of October. Small patches of bajra (pearl millet) and cotton were also destroyed.Shock after repeated tragedies is how Amol Jadhav, a local journalist and a farmer himself from Kaij in Beed, describes the latest setback. After consecutive drought years that crippled the rural economyof Marathwada  impoverishing even relatively better-off agricultural households  it is the excess rains from the withdrawing southwest monsoon that has caused heavy losses for many farmers of the region this time.Marathwada received 824.8 mm of rainfall during June-September, over a fifth higher than its normal quota of 682.9 mm for the four-month monsoon season. And it hasnt stooped raining even after September 30. During October 1-12, Latur district has recorded 200 per cent excess precipitation, with these at 197 per cent for Hingoli, 172 per cent for Nanded, 171 per cent for Beed and 159 per cent for Osmanabad. The regions other three districts  Jalna (111 per cent), Parbhani (104 per cent) and Aurangabad (73 per cent)  have also registered above-normal rains so far this month, even if not to the same extent.In all, out of the 76 talukas in the Marathwada region, 23 have already received more than 125 per cent of their total average annual rainfall quota. And significant part of these rains have come since the last week of September  just when the standing kharif crop has been due for harvesting or closer to maturity. The contrast with the situation just a few months back  when the Maharashtra government pressed in a record number of water tankers for the parched regions villages and towns  couldnt have been starker. This time, an estimated 3,800 villages of Marathwada have been affected by excess rains, as opposed to its 9,000 villages that were declared drought-hit earlier in the year.According to initial estimates made by district collectors, crops worth more than Rs 500 crore have been damaged in Latur, Beed and Osmanabad alone. That figure is likely to go up with more detailed village-level surveys. An early assessment has pegged the total crop loss across Marathwada at 9,15,431 hectares, out of the 49 lakh hectares area that was planted to crops during the current kharif season. Latur has been the worst hit, accounting for nearly 3,94,000 hectares of the regions total affected farmland. In Beed, as much as 3,68,000 hectares out of the districts 7,98,000 hectares of agricultural land have officially sustained crop damage.Soyabean has been almost wiped out. Out of the 2,40,000 hectares that was sown under the crop, approximately 2,05,000 hectares has been washed away or damaged, said Beed district collector Naval Kishore Ram. Soyabean, which has become increasingly popular among Marathwadas farmers over the past decade, is a light plant particularly prone to losses from either water-logging or extreme dryness.Besides soyabean, another one lakh hectares under Bt cotton has also been affected in Beed. Areas such Patoda and Majalgaon with fields on the banks of the Sindphana and Bindusara  tributaries of the Godavari  are reported to have suffered damage extending to all crops, including soyabean, cotton, tur (pigeon-pea), moong and urad.While soyabean has been the worst-affected, farmers say that even the cotton bolls have been soaked and damaged, while tur in many places has witnessed sprouting of the grains. An assessment of damage from fungal infections is also still underway.The India Meteorological Departments rainfall map depicting the south monsoons performance for the whole season has shown only four sub-divisions in the country to have received excess rains this time. Marathwada is among the four  a rare occurrence for a region that has experienced deficit monsoon in three out of the preceding four years.This year, it has rained so much that six of the 18 floodgates on the Dhanegaon dam across the Manjara River had to be opened. Farmlands across one km of either bank in Beeds Kaij and Ambajogai talukas and in several places of Latur are still water-logged. The same Dhanegaon dam ran dry early this summer, necessitating a dramatic supply of drinking water to Latur city via railway wagons. Latur municipality, then, was in a position to supply water only once a month.But wouldnt these excess rains be of help at least in the coming rabi season? Garje isnt optimistic even about that: One in every four or five farmers is facing problems of severe erosion of their soils from the latest rains. That will make field preparation for the next crop challenging. In some areas, the flooded farmland is too soggy for farmers to even enter the fields for any kind of land preparation for sowing, according to Garje.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

APMC sources said the increase in prices could be linked to higher yield in onion growing areas in Maharashtra and Karnataka, particularly in Chikkamagaluru district.The yield of onion has been high on account of average rainfall. Had the rains been good, the yield would have been poor, an APMC official said.Retail price of onion (per kg)August and September: Rs. 15 to Rs. 20October: Rs. 10Wholesale price of onion (per quintal)August: Rs. 500 toRs. 1,300September: Rs. 200 to Rs. 1,400October: Rs. 200 toRs. 900"

About 29,715 hectares was under kharif cultivation till October 20, as against 40,000 hectares in the corresponding period last year Consistent rain has ruined large tracts of the stored summer onion crop, and delayed the kharif sowing in Nashik district. The harvest will not be ready and less than the usual quantity will arrive in November. Nashik district contribu tes nearly 80% of the state's share in the onion market.Any scarcity in November here will have a cascading effect on the prices in the wholesale and retail markets till the year-end across the country .While the average wholesale onion prices were at an all-time high of Rs 5,700 a quintal on August 22, 2015, farmers were selling the produce at a wholesale rate of Re 1 per kg at Lasalgaon last month.Over the past few days, onion farmers have been bringing in the last remaining stock of the summer stock stored with them.The average wholesale rates at Lasalgaon have remained in the range of Rs 650 to Rs 550 a quintal.Once the farmers run out of the stock, onion scarcity in the market is likely to send the prices spirally during the festive season. The BJP government's efforts to cushion this price hike have failed miserably .An official from Lasalgaon Sahakari Kharedi Vikri Sangh, a sub-agency of the National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India Ltd, said the arrival of the new kharif crop is expected in the first week of December.""A scarcity is expected in the last week of October and the whole of November. The average wholesale prices have already started increasing and it may rise by Rs 1,500 per quintal in the next two-three weeks,"" the official added.Problems started up with a delay in the onset of the monsoon, this year. Growers had to put off the kharif plantation by one-and-a-half months.The bulk 85% plantation for the kharif season was done in September instead of the usual July-August.Since harvesting is possible in three to four months, the crop will be harvest-ready only by November-end instead of mid-October.The normal area under onion cultivation in Nashik district is spread across 70,000 hectare.About 40,000 hectare is under the long-lasting summer crop and the remaining under kharif and late kharif onion cultivation.The summer crop also has a better yield than the kharif cultivation. As against 18 tonne a hectare yield for the summer crop, the farmers can look forward to just 15 tonne a hectare from the kharif cultivation.Officials said acreage under kharif and late kharif onion cropping has seen a 25% decline over the last year because of delayed rains and waterlogged fields.At present, onion markets in Nashik district, including Lasalgaon Agriculture Produce Market Committee, are receiving the summer crop harvested in March and April which has a shelf life of fourand-a-half months.The little stock with farmers will be exhausted in 15 days, an agronomist from a government research agency said.Lasalgaon APMC chair Lasalgaon APMC chairman Jaydatta Holkar said, ""The summer stock is already five months old. Its quality has already been affected due to the heavy rainfall and high humidity . As such, farmers have very little stock and hence November may be see a severe shortfall.""The crunch coming around Diwali may hit the BJP government. The average wholesale onion prices had touched Rs 3,200 a quintal in 1998. The soaring rates had led to a poll debacle for the BJP in three states.Last year, the government imported onions after prices shot up in the retail markets in August. This time, the Centre procured 17,000 metric tonnes in May through Nafed and Small Farmers' Agribusiness Consortium under the price stability fund.However, 50% of the buffer stock stored in Nafed's godowns and other leased storage facilities in Lasalgaon, Pimpalgaon and Kalwan in the district has gone waste.""Around 40% of the onion buffer stock was sold in Delhi, Orissa and other states. Now, the remaining 10% stock has to be sold within next 15 days,"" a source told TOI."

While the State had sought aid at Rs. 11 a kg, the Centre expressed its ability to procure only 1 lakh tonne.Addressing presspersons here, Law and Parliamentary Affairs Minister T.B. Jayachandra, who also heads the State Cabinet committee on agricultural crops, said Karnataka Marketing Federation would procure the commodity under the market intervention scheme. A sum of Rs. 50 crore had been released for the purpose.Procurement would commence from November 2 in 10 districts  Dharwad, Gadag, Davangere, Chitradurga, Ballari, Chikkamagaluru, Haveri, Vijayapura, Raichur, and Koppal  from the agricultural produce marketing committees (APMCs).Although the announcement has come as a succour for onion growers in distress, many of them are feeling let down as they were expecting a higher MSP. Many, in fact, were hoping for monetary assistance rather than MSP since they have already suffered losses.The situation has been bad, and during October, the Davangere APMC registered a minimum price as low as Rs. 50 per quintal (i.e. 50 paise a kg).Despite several taluks in the State being declared drought hit, in the major onion growing districts in the State irrigation and timely rain at some places helped farmers to get comparatively good yield. However, while untimely rains forced the farmers to harvest it early, simultaneous arrival of onion from Maharashtra created a glut, which, in turn, has been exploited to the core by brokers. In many places there were protests by farmers over the low prices, while at some places onions were simply thrown away or not taken to the market.The State government earlier talked about MSP of Rs. 1,100 a quintal. It has been brought down since the Centre refused to share the burden. What is the revolving fund for agriculture meant for? N.H. Konaraddi, Navalgund MLA, sought to know."

Despite this, for seven months now, the district agriculture office at Nashik has not accepted applications from onion farmers who want to avail government subsidy to build scientific storage units for their produce. Also, at least 2,100 farmers from Nashik who had applied for money under the subsidy scheme in 2015-16 have still not received it. And yet, the state government has earmarked Rs 5 crore under the scheme for 2016-17. The problem: the state has stipulated that these funds are to be disbursed only to new applicants, and the Nashik office has been told it should not accept any new applications until all earlier applicants receive their funds. A proposal to disburse the funds for this year to the 2,100 applicants from last year has not yet received a response.Maharashtra is responsible for 25-30 per cent of the total onion production in the country and 80-85 per cent of its exports. In this, Nashik contributes at least 50 per cent of the states onion output.The problem of rotting onions, and price fluctuations, is caused due to the lack of proper storage facilities available to farmers. Those which are available are unscientific and end up causing harm to the stored crop. In such spaces, the onion crop undergoes physiological loss in weight, rotting and sprouting.Thus, many farmers dump their entire harvest in the market, causing a glut. This causes wide price fluctuations creating unrest among consumers as well as farmers. As a solution, the Maharashtra State Agricultural Marketing Board had formulated a subsidy scheme for scientific onion storage. Under this scheme, at least 25 per cent of the construction cost of a scientific storage unit with capacity between 5-50 metric tonnes would be borne by the state government. The idea is that this would encourage farmers in setting up scientific onion storage systems, minimize storage losses and quality deterioration of the produce and help farmers fetch better prices.Last year in Nashik district, a total of 4,307 farmers had applied to get support under the scheme. Of these, 2,264 applicants were given help from the available funds creating 49,500 metric tonnes of scientific storage space. However, 2,100 applicants could not get the money due to lack of funds. The district agriculture office was told that until the funds are not disbursed for the 2,100 applicants, no new applications should be accepted by their office.The state government has earmarked Rs 5 crore under the scheme for 2016-17. It has stipulated that the money should be disbursed only to new applicants. District level officials said they have approached the state government to allow the funds to be given to the 2,100 applicants. We have moved a proposal seeking distribution of this years funds to last years applicants who have not received funds. However, we are yet to receive a response, said a district-level agriculture officer.Farmers say they have been left in the lurch by the authorities. We are asked to upgrade the way we undertake agriculture and when we do it, the government delays in helping out the farmers. If this is the way we look at this sector, I am afraid not many people will be interested in pursuing this profession in the long run, said Nilesh Patil, an onion farmer from Dindori.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

The Union central government has decided to make provision for dry port in Wardha and Jalna. If land is made available at Nashik, then we will give Rs 500 crore fund for dry port here,"" he said, while addressing a horticulture conference in Yashwantrao Chavan Maharashtra Open University.The government has decided to convert 111 rivers into waterways. Research, innovation, entrepreneurship, technology and quality of products will be the prime factors for agriculture development in future. ""It is essential to remove the weak points in the chain of agriculture production by studying these factors. Agriculture colleges should also consider the needs of local agriculture while deciding research,"" he said.He suggested that farmers should turn towards business to get profit from horticulture and advised use of solar energy for cold storage and pre-cooling plant for fruits. ""Since there is huge demand for organic fruits in the world, it is necessary to reduce the use of inorganic manure and pesticides. Farmers will also benefit from the use of bioenergy,"" Gadkari said.Irrigation has to be increased to 60% in stateThe union minister said it was necessary to increase the area under irrigation in the state from current 18.6% to at least 60% for overall development of farmers.""Only 15-20% rainwater is arrested in dams. It is necessary to establish channels to conserve water in rural areas and use drip irrigation to increase the yield. Since past two years, Jalyukta Shivar is being implemented successfully,"" Gadkari said.BJP leader Pandurang Phundkar said the state leads in grape export and 90% of it is from Nashik district. ""We will take grapes from here to the world after getting suggestions from Grape Growers Association of Nashik . We will also try to give the pending grant to onion growers at the earliest,"" he said.Minister of state for agriculture and horticulture marketing and textiles, Sadabhau Khot , said research in agriculture should be taken to the farmers. ""New generation is not interested in farming, hence agriculture field is lagging behind. Climate change, availability of water, production cost have also affected agriculture.

Old stock that was harvested in April-May is getting exhausted and there has been an unusual delay in fresh arrivals causing rates to rise.Prices at APMC Vashi spurted from Rs 8-10 on October 28 to Rs 10-12/kg on Monday. The supply crunch is gradually reflected in the retail market. Onions are selling for Rs 14-20/kg compared to the pre-Diwali slab of Rs 12-15.On Monday, the bulb sold for Rs 15 in Apna Bazar in Bandra, while shopkeepers in Andheri Lokhandwala charged Re 1 more. In Colaba, the rate at Sahakari Bhandar was Rs 14.50 for onions sold loose and Rs 13.50/kg for bulk packages of 5 kg. In Mulund, however, shops along L B S Marg sold old onion for an exorbitant Rs 30/kg and the new damp crop for Rs 25.Experts at APMC Vashi said 25% of recent supplies were found to be of inferior quality. The Mumbai market revived from a supply crisis on Monday with substantial arrivals from Hubli in Karnataka, besides Nashik. ""We got 225 truckloads which helped stabilize the rising price. Over 50% of supplies came from Hubli, the rest came from Nashik. Prices will come under control once the new crop hits the market by this month end,"" said Rajendra Shelke, president of the Onion-Potato Traders' Association.After Diwali, there has been a shortfall in supplies at the wholesale market as the old stock is running out. Due to 'heavy rain' in the onion-producing areas with an extended monsoon, the ripening of the kharif crop was reportedly delayed. ""This year, the old stock became wet and the new crop has been delayed. Prices may rise until the fresh crop hits the market,"" said a trader.Consumers have also been feeling the pinch. The season had witnessed the lowest price at Rs 2/kg in wholesale and Rs 8 in retail with a glut that began during the monsoon. ""We enjoyed a few months with afforda-ble prices, but now onions are becoming expensive again,"" said Nitesh Gurav , a consumer.In Lasalgaon, the wholesale price increased by 22% to Rs 825/quintal on Monday compared to Rs 675 last Friday. The arrival of the new crop has started, but in small quantities. At present, 98% of all arrivals are of the summer crop and the remaining 2% of the kharif crop. It will take more than a month for arrival of kharif onions to be regularized. Jaydatta Holkar, Lasalgaon APMC chairman, said, ""Prices had fallen to Rs 300-350/quintal in September because of the rise in supply.

As per the statements by Minister of State for Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution, Ram Vilas Paswan, the Act was to be fully implemented across India by July 2016. As of now, only five States have fully executed it as per the provisions of the Central Act and the progress in other States has been tardy. The front runners are Punjab, Haryana, Chhattisgarh, Maharashtra and Rajasthan. The Act has been partially implemented in Bihar, Delhi, Himachal Pradesh and Karnataka. Preliminary surveys undertaken in some of these States have revealed positive outcomes in terms of administrative reforms, significant increase in the number of households having ration cards, and improvement in the distribution and consumption of food through fair price shops. A few of them had already initiated reforming the distribution system much before the Act was presented in Parliament. The Act, if fully implemented, is likely to benefit 720 million people through availability of 5 kg per capita per month of subsidised foodgrains (rice, wheat and coarse cereals) at a much lower rate than that in the open market. This would ensure food security and enhance nutritional status.The Odisha studyThe two concepts are interlinked, but nutrition security has a much wider connotation than food security. It encompasses a biological approach, that is, adequate and safe intake of protein, energy, vitamin and minerals along with proper health and social environment. The nutritional aspect of the quantity of grain to be distributed to each person under the Public Distribution System (PDS) is somewhat less researched, though the Act has aimed at attaining this goal. Poor quality of food lacking essential micronutrients and no diet diversity, and unhygienic conditions of storage may come in the way. There are other promising features under the Act, such as free daily meals for children and maternity benefits, including cash for pregnant women, which can combat rampant undernutrition (calorie deficiency) and malnutrition (protein deficiency) across the country. These steps may perhaps complement the existing nutritional programmes such as mid-day meals and Integrated Child Development Services.We present results from a study in rural Odisha on the contribution of PDS towards households intake of foodgrains and the quantum of calorie and protein levels. A primary survey of 385 households was carried out during 2014-15 in three extremely poor districts viz. Koraput and Bolangir in the so-called KBK (most backward) region and Nayagarh in the non-KBK region. While KBK districts follow a universal PDS, non-KBK districts have a targeted one.There is high prevalence of undernutrition and malnutrition in the selected districts. The estimates, adjusted on the basis of age, sex and work as recommended by the nutrient requirements and dietary allowances of Indians drawn up by the Indian Council of Medical Research-National Institute of Nutrition in 2010 reveal the undernourished population to be 50 per cent and the malnourished to be 43 per cent on an average for all the districts together. Calorie and protein deficiency is relatively higher (see graphic), nearly 68 per cent among the Antyodaya Anna Yojana (AAY) households, known to be the poorest of poor. It is much higher in Koraput district at 72 per cent, way above the State average of 60 per cent.Rice is the key staple food in the surveyed areas and acts as a major source of energy intake. The monthly per capita consumption of rice is estimated to be 11.6 kg, of which 33.7 per cent is sourced from the PDS by all beneficiaries. Since AAY households have higher quota and accessibility under the PDS, the contribution is much more at 73.9 per cent. Cereals (wheat and rice) make up 70 per cent of the calorie intake and 66 per cent of the protein intake, though the magnitude varies across districts. More importantly, the contribution of PDS to energy intake among AAY households is double (60 per cent) that of other beneficiaries.Better accessibility to food and hence energy intake of poor people, especially those under AAY, has been made possible due to concerted efforts initiated by the government. Major reforms initiated from 2004-05 that are worth mentioning include abolition of private procurement and storage system, and a greater role for public agencies in controlling diversion of foodgrain from the godown to the millers; proper recording of procurement, storage and distribution of grains across the departments; and distribution of food through self-help groups and gram panchayats and its regular monitoring at the block and ward levels. While revealing their satisfaction with the PDS, the beneficiaries refuted the idea of having a cash transfer system in place of the existing in-kind transfers, primarily due to fear of price hike and inadequate infrastructure i.e. roads, banks, and long distance of market from the village. In fact, the beneficiaries proposed an increase in the coverage of commodities to pulses, onion and potato under the PDS in their respective areas.Replicating Odisha elsewhereThe efforts of the State government in ensuring food security should be replicated in States that are yet to fully implement the Act and reform their respective distribution systems. Many studies have emphasised on dietary diversification to ensure appropriate nutritional intake for large segments of the poor population. This may be an important step to be taken up in States where a revamped PDS is making ground, such as in Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Bihar. Provision has been made under the NFSA to provide one additional coarse cereal viz. millet along with wheat and rice, which can further enhance the nutritional security of the poor households. Though wheat and rice contribute significantly to energy intake, the time has come to increase our focus on coarse cereals and pulses to improvise adequate intake of protein. Serious deliberations are required to make this possible through the PDS, which is going to cater to a sizeable population in the near future. As elicited above, the AAY households have a greater access to PDS but the problem of undernourishment is more serious among them.As a prerequisite, it is imperative to hasten implementation of the NFSA across the country. States should be in a mission mode as availability of foodgrains may not be a problem this year. The Ministry of Agriculture has projected a record production of 270 million tonnes owing to good monsoon and an increase in acreage of foodgrains from 101 million hectares to 105 million hectares. The States must gear up to work on adequate logistics for digitisation of ration cards, computerisation of offtake and delivery of foodgrains, and effective monitoring of fair price shops, possibly through involvement of communities or other feasible ways. This will bring in greater transparency in the system and would go a long way towards raising the nutritional status of Indians.SeemaBathla is Professor and Bal Krishan Negi a Research Scholar at Centre for the Study of Regional Development, JNU, New Delhi.The Antyodaya Anna Yojana households have a greater access to PDS but the problem of undernourishment is more serious among them"

Harish Rao has warned traders against creating artificial scarcity of onion in the name of demonetisation of higher denomination currency notes and said that steps were being taken to ensure ample supply from within the State and nearby areas.He said that onion would be directly purchased from farmers by the Marketing Department and made available to consumers across the State at Rs. 10 per kg. At a meeting held here on Tuesday to take stock of the situation arising out of marketing transactions coming to a standstill following demonetisation of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes, he directed the Marketing Department officials to procure onion directly from farmers in Kollapur, Alampur and other areas and bring it to Malakper market and Rythu Bazaars.Representatives of onion traders explained to the Minister that they were incurring an expenditure of about Rs. 50,000 per lorry load of onions, including transportation and handling (hamali) charges from Maharashtra and other areas and it was not possible for them to make payment due to demonetisation of notes.The Minister directed the officials to procure onion directly from farmers at Rs. 8 per kg by forming special teams and make it available to consumers at Rs. 10 per kg. Since Malakpet market was congested, he suggested the officials to bring the onion procured from farmers to the new market yard set up close to the outer ring road near Patancheru.On bringing amendments to the Marketing Act, he decided to hold a meeting with the experts from NALSAR and ASCI within a week. Further, he wanted the officials to inspect cotton ginning mills from Adilabad to Khammam."

But PM Narendra Modis decision to demonetize Rs500 and Rs1,000 banknotes has changed it all.After the announcement, the shortage of smaller denomination currency led to a sharp fall in prices of fruits and vegetables. The traders have now asked farmers to not bring their produce owing to the drop in prices and lack of currency.We are stuck in a difficult situation. On the one hand, the vegetable produce in the farm is ready for cutting. But we cant go ahead with it as there is no point taking it to the agriculture produce market committee (APMC). Traders say they dont have the cash to purchase our vegetables, said another farmer Madhukar Gogawale, who produces bitter gourd, tomato and bottle gourd on his 14-acre farm.With the halt in supply of money from buyers to farmers, the rural economy has taken a hit.The number of vehicles supplying vegetables to Pune APMC came down by 40% on Tuesday, compared to the previous week, claim sources from the Maharashtra State Agriculture Marketing Board (MSAMB).The problem, farmers feel, may aggravate further with the district central cooperative banks not being allowed to exchange the higher currency by smaller denominations notes. These banks, considered to be the backbone of rural economy, have been barred from carrying out transactions, as many of them have not completed the know-your-customer formalities by taking PAN and other details.In Nashik, many onion growers did not bring their produce to APMCs on Sunday and Monday, as there was not enough cash with traders. Jaydatta Holkar, chairman at APMC, Nashik, said, We have stopped buying onions for the past two days.Our vegetable produce is not getting good price despite demand. Neither can we exchange old currency from the district central cooperative bank, nor can we withdraw money from our accounts. It is a really tough time, said Ramesh Kondhe, another farmer from Khed Shivapur."

(Express Photo: Pavan Khengre) The market yard of the wholesale agricultural produce mandi at Pune wears a deserted look post-demonetisation. (Express Photo: Pavan Khengre)The last one week and more has brought nothing but bad news for Vasant Pimpale. This farmer from Pargaon Tarfe Ale, a village in Pune districts Junnar taluka, has already lost 11 tonnes of green chilli grown on eight out of his 15-acres holding. The loss hasnt been courtesy drought, flood or hail, but because of a disaster totally man-made.Till early this month, I used to dispatch roughly two tonnes of vegetables (including cabbage, cauliflower and brinjal) every day to the Vashi wholesale market in Navi Mumbai. But after November 8, I am unable to send even 800 kg, as the traders have told me that there is no demand, says Pimpale, who has had to endure the loss of his chilli crop, which has turned from green to red, simply for lack of buyers. And hes clear what has been behind his tale of misfortune: the Narendra Modi governments decision to demonetise Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 denomination currency notes.Watch What Else is Making NewsSince November 8, the day demonetisation happened, prices of green chilli at Vashi have fallen from around Rs 14 to Rs 3 per kg, while similarly dropping from Rs 13 to Rs 4 for cauliflower and from Rs 26 to Rs 12 for brinjal. The market for our produce has all but collapsed, complains Pimpale, who is among the many farmers in rural Maharashtra to have been impacted by the virtual disappearance of cash from the system.The bulk of them have operational bank accounts, but sell their entire produce for cash to traders who are now strapped for currency. With the mandis in Nashik, Lasalgaon, Manchar, Manmad and other produce market towns officially closed and even the terminal market at Vashi registering steep drop in trading volumes, farmers  particularly those growing perishables like vegetables and flowers that cannot remain in or outside fields too long after maturity  are the hardest hit.Shriram Gadve, a farmer from Arvi near Narayangaon and also president of the Vegetable Growers Association of India, estimates that Junnar  the taluka where his village, too, falls  alone has some 40,000 acres under vegetable cultivation. 95 per cent of growers in this belt sell to the Vashi terminal market that is about 160 km away, while the rest dispose of their produce in nearby mandis such as Narayangaon and Manchar. The ones selling at Vashi do it through hundekaris.The hundekaris are essentially local farmers, acting as conduits between growers, organised into groups, and traders sitting at Vashi. They aggregate the growers produce and arrange for its transport against a one per cent commission on the final price. While the traders in Vashi issue pattis (purchase slips) in the name of individual farmers, the entire payment after deducting transport cost and labour charges is made to the hundekaris. The hundekari may receive the payment either in cash or even through bank account transfer. But he pays the farmers belonging to his group entirely in cash.The pattis are sent to farmers a day after sale takes place, while payments happen on a weekly basis. We pay in cash after withdrawing the money from our own account. The farmers selling directly in local markets, too, transact wholly in cash, explains Sachin Gadve, a five-acre farmer from Arvi who is also a hundekari for 60 growers. Since demonetisation, the traders in Vashi have told us to send less quantities, as they are finding to it difficult to offload the produce further to retailers selling to the final consumer, he adds.Its very simple. The household end-buyer has no cash to purchase from the feriwala (hawker/retailer), who, in turn, sources from us. Everybody down the chain to the farmer has naturally been affected, points out Rajendra Shelke, president of the Onion Potato Commission Agents and Traders Union at the Vashi market, which, on an average day, receives 700-800 truckloads of vegetables and 100-115 of onions and potatoes. On Wednesday, these numbers were down to 300 and 40 trucks, respectively. Our whole business is done in cash. Today, we are neither able to sell the produce nor in a position to pay farmers, he notes.The situation is no different in other markets. Daily vegetable arrivals at Punes agriculture produce market committee mandi, which used to be around 200 truckloads, has dropped to 80. In most suburban markets, there has been no trading at all for the last one week. Jaydutt Holkar, chairman of the Lasalgaon market committee, has written a letter to the Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, seeking permission for transactions in mandis using the now-withdrawn Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes. 90 per cent of the business was, in any case, being done in these so-called high-value notes. If they have permitted petrol pumps to accept these, why cannot the same be allowed for agricultural produce in regulated markets such as ours? he asks.What makes matters worse is that no immediate end to the troubles seems to be in sight, at least for farmers. Hardly a week before demonetisation, Abhay Gadve, a five-acre farmer also from Arvi, had sent a two-tonne consignment of vegetables to Vashi and realised a net value of Rs 25,000 lakh after all the deductions. In my latest patti, all that I got was Rs10,000 for the same quantity. The traders have sent out signals that there could be further reductions, unless cash returns to the system. If I sell at the rate they are quoting, even recovering input costs would be impossible. Theres a lot of cauliflower, cabbage, green chilli, onion, brinjal and coriander at this moment in the Junnar vegetable belt that is ready to be harvested. All this will be lost because of demonetisation. And we are stuck, since bank transfer is also not possible, avers Gadve.But its not just collapse of demand and prices. The cash crunch on account of demonetisation has also affected farmers ahead of plantings for the rabi season. We normally start operations from the first week of November, during which time seeds, fertilisers and other inputs are procured. Since there is no cash, sowing of chana (chickpea), wheat and garlic is likely to be delayed by more than a fortnight. At the current rate, we may not even have plantings at all, fears Deepak Bhise, president of the Junnar Taluka Tomato Growers Association.Pimpale, the farmer from Pargaon Tarfe Ale village who also manages a farm input shop at Narayangaon, informs that he does daily business of Rs 2-3 lakh during this otherwise busy season. Currently, I am hardly doing Rs 25,000-30,000. Farmers dont have the cash, they are not used to paying through swipe cards or cheques, and I am in no position to accept the withdrawn currency notes. If cash isnt injected into the system, we really dont know what to do, he sums up the situation.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

On Wednesday, traders in Malakpet, one of the largest onion markets in the city, decided to bring down their shutters till November 19, owing to the unavailability of adequate cash to pay transport and labour charges. A representation, stating the same, was submitted to the agricultural marketing department.Till then, traders said, they will clear their old stocks.""We have called for the market to be closed as there is no cash available. It has affected payments made to truck drivers, labourers and tiller carriers that happen only in cash as they do not accept payments in any other form. Right now we are only clearing out our old stocks,"" said Ananth Reddy, president of the Hyderabad Onion Merchants' Association, adding, ""This will have a ripple effect on the onion supply to the city and its peripheral areas.""""We have no choice but to hike the prices to ensure we do not slip into huge losses,"" said Md Aslam, a trader at Begum Bazaar market, where many were seeing selling old stock. ""There are very few lorries that brought onion into the market on Wednesday. So we are selling stock that is two days old,"" he added.Officials of the agricultural marketing department confirmed the dip in number of trucks bringing supplies to the city. ""From the usual 100 trucks, the number has dropped to less than 30,"" said Raja Shekhar, secretary of the market yard. Of 100 trucks bringing in supplies, almost 70 come from Maharashtra, Karnataka and parts of Madhya Pradesh.Given the crisis, Telangana minister for agricultural marketing, T Harish Rao, has now directed officials to ensure that there is enough supply of onions in the city's markets. ""If required, the department officials can also procure stock from markets around the city. We need to make sure that the price of the vegetable is regulated and is sold at Rs 10 per kg,"" he said."

Barring a few minor transactions at the APMC yard, the demonetization of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes has seen business at the agriculture market coming to a juddering halt.The agents have had a hard time making payments to farmers, transport vehicles, porters among others. The closure of the market in Belagavi follows a similar move in Hubballi, and other districts in Maharashtra. On Wednesday, the onion bags that were brought into the market numbered just 300, while about 1,000 to 1,500 bags of potato arrived, while there was no sign of sweet potatoes. Wednesday, which is a market day, usually sees as many 250 to 300 loads of onion hauled in. However, local farmers who brought potato left home empty handed, since there were no buyers.Local buyers, who supply onions and potatoes to hotels and retail stores in the district, were seen purchasing the stock that left over from Saturday, only on the condition of getting Rs 100 and the new Rs 2,000 in exchange.A truck driver from Davanagere, Noorullah said, ""The commission agent has paid me using the demonetized notes, with which I can only refuel my lorry. But, I will have to use my money at hotels and mills.""Balappa Hulaji, a farmer from Mannikeri village, who had brought potatoes to the market said that he couldn't store the onions for long since they did not have cold storage. ""If it is not brought to the market, they will undergo decay. I will get my payment later, but I can at least sell my potatoes here,"" he said.President of the traders' association, Manohar Mungari said, ""The Market may resume from the next week, once the new currency notes are in circulation.""Secretary, APMC, BM Shrinivas said that there were no transactions at the market on Wednesday, since the agents' association called off the auction."

And this had to be procured by Agricultural Marketing Department from neighbouring Maharashtra.Bogged down by shortsupply , traders had on Wednesday called for a closure of the market till November 19.""I am sitting on old stock of 40 kg but I am not able to find buyers since the increase in prices,"" said another vendor M Dhalapathi, who has been operating in the market for the last five years.The plight of lorry drivers bringing in stock was as bad.""Drivers and labourers obviously can't be paid in cheques.We need cash at every step of the way , at toll gates or octroi posts,"" said Nukala Bhaskar Reddy , president, Telangana Lorry Owners' Association.

On Thursday, the government slashed the onetime exchange limit for old notes to Rs 2,000 from Rs 4,500, having raised it from Rs 4,000 before that. The weekly withdrawal limit for savings bank account users had been raised to Rs 24,000 from Rs 20,000 with the limit of Rs 10,000 per day being scrapped. As for ATM withdrawals, the limit has been raised to Rs 2,500 from Rs 2,000 earlier but thats only for those that are recalibrated to take the new Rs 500 and Rs 2,000 notes, a process thats taking time  only 10% of the machines have been reprogrammed.While the public position of banks is that the situation has eased, anecdotal evidence seems to suggest that this is true in some parts of the country but not others, especially NCR.On top of that, bankers told ET that they are struggling to keep pace with the sudden changes in regulations. As there arent enough notes to go around, banks have had to impose their own curbs.The government increased the withdrawal limits recently (but) we have to cater to all our customers. Cash is limited, so we have put up signage outside the branch telling customers we can only disburse Rs 15,000 to savings bank holders and Rs 25,000 to current account holders, said a private bank branch manager. One bank executive in New Delhis Connaught Place area said it only issues 50 tokens for withdrawals every day because thats all the cash it gets for such disbursals, which means the money usually runs out in an hour or so.In hindsight, its clear the massive demand for currency exchange hadnt been expected. It was only when realisation daGwned that this route was being employed for largescale money laundering that the window was narrowed to Rs 2,000.In the initial days, there was ambiguity over the Rs 4,000 one-time exchange, which was exploited by people, said the employee of a state-owned bank branch. Now it has been reduced to Rs 2,000 (but) imagine how we will answer (genuine) customers who come at our branches and question us on these changes.The raised withdrawal limits arent of much relief, even for those who hold current accounts and need to pay employees and vendors. Axis Bank is giving half the money and Karnataka Bank is just giving a paltry sum, said an entrepreneur from Salem in Tamil Nadu who runs a garment chain. There is a lot of confusion in our minds because government says we can withdraw Rs 50,000.Lakhamsinh Gadda, who runs a toy shop in Mumbais Jogeshwari area, faced the same issue. I have accounts with two banks. Both told me that I have to wait for some time to get the full amount as they are running out of cash.An executive at a public sector lender based in south India said it had got just Rs 1,000 crore for its 100 branches in the south zone. This amount is too less given we are getting customers of other banks as well to use our ATM facility, he said, adding that the supply of Rs 500 currency notes was severely limited. Maybe once that improves, we will be able to manage the rush. This also shows the limited currency that the RBI has been able to print despite all announcements it has made.Bengaluru, according to this official, is not witnessing the kind of rush being seen in the north. There are long queues but surprisingly more civility, he said.A senior Punjab National Bank official said that staff have been instructed to put the new Rs 500 notes mostly in ATMs. Thats another issue because at the branch counter we are mostly dealing with Rs 100 or Rs 2,000 currency notes, he said. While some mobile apps have sprung up purporting to provide information about which ATMs in any given area have cash, people have taken to tracking the vans that transport currency notes.The need for money is so huge that we have heard that several people are tailing the cash provider vans of SIS and Brinks Arya so that they get cash immediately once its loaded in the ATM, said another banker. ATMs are running out of cash quickly. Once they are recalibrated, Rs 500 and Rs 2,000 notes will be available.Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said 22,500 ATMs (out of 202,000) had been reprogrammed by Thursday to dispense the new notes, along with the old Rs 100 notes. That leaves 90% of the ATM network yet to be calibrated.The governments decision to inject cash into the agricultural markets with higher withdrawal limits for traders and farmers has prompted the main onion market at Lasalgaon, Nashik, to resume operations after about a week. Jaydatta Holkar, chairman of the mandi, said farmers will also be paid through the banking system. Farmers welcomed the move but complained that reaching bank counters or finding functioning ATMs remains a challenge. Elsewhere, things have been getting better, some users said.Mumbai resident Sangita Pereira said she managed to get Rs 10,000 from her Central Bank of India branch in Vikhroli. Seeing the queues at branches, I was going to one ATM after another but didnt manage to get any cash. I stood outside my bank branch yesterday, waited for one hour and got the cash, so its looking much better than what it was two days back.In Pune, queues outside banks have subsided substantially. There was more rush from people who had accounts in other branches or banks."" said Harish Pai, who had just returned from SBI. Now that ATMs are calibrated, the rush is expected to subside over the next few days."

On Thursday, along with Marketing Director Laxmi Bai, he visited Malakpet wholesale market and inspected the onion market transactions.He met the traders and commission agents of the market. The Secretary said the onion farmers produce was collected from their farm and transported to the market. Later, the produce is procured by the Marketing department at a reasonable price of `8 per kg and the same will be sold to consumers at Rs 10 per kg through Rythu bazaars.Parthasarathi said the government considered the interests of both the farmers and the consumers. The Secretary has instructed the marketing department officials to speak to local traders and commission agents and keep the agriculture market committees (AMC) open so that the transactions are done as usual.The Agriculture Secretary also instructed the officials concerned to pay the farmers through cheque, online transfer, Real-time gross settlement (RGTS) after the transaction. He said the onion production was noted more in Jogulambha and Wanaparthy districts.In August and September 2015 onion seeds were distributed to farmers at 75 per cent subsidy which led to onions being planted on 9,000 acres. As a result, there was no major shortage of onions in the state, he said. He said that the market price for onion has gone down due to the supply of stock from Maharashtra."

It is the second largest wholesale onion market in the country after Lasalgaon.A senior official from a nationalised bank said, ""There had been shortage of cash on Sunday, but we refilled the cash at ATMs on Monday. Almost all our ATMs were operational on Monday. The currency notes with denominations of Rs 2,000 and Rs 100 are being uploaded in the ATMs.""He added, ""Few bank branches issued new currency notes of Rs 500, but they were very few in number. The banks need to issue new notes of Rs 500 at large to overcome shortage of change. Use of debit and credit cards has also increased at large as retailers and wholesalers have started giving these facilities to the customers. The businesses are also improving gradually,"" said Prafulla Sancheti, president, Nashik City Traders' Federation (NCTF).Contract labourers to get bank accountsAll nationalised and private banks have decided to open bank accounts of contract labourers from Tuesday. Every bank has been given a target to open at least 3,000 such accounts.The decision comes after the directive of the Centre making payment of contract and casual labourers through bank accounts. Ashok Chavan, lead manager of Bank of Maharashtra, said, ""We had meeting on the issue on Monday. It has been decided that each bank will take up the initiative and will open at least 3,000 bank accounts of contract and casual labourers."""

(Express Photo: Mayur Bargaje) Farm labourers harvesting late-kharif onions at a field near Nashik. (Express Photo: Mayur Bargaje)Its already a bit late in the season, but three out of Nandu Awatis seven-acres holding are yet to see any rabi onion plantings. The 42-year-old from Ambegaon, a village in Yeola taluka of Maharashtras Nashik district, had sown onion seeds in his nursery by mid-October and begun transplanting the germinated seedlings from these towards the month-end. By November first week, he had finished transplanting in four acres, when disaster struck in the form of demonetisation of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 currency notes. That was on November 8.I had to abruptly stop, as there was no cash to pay labourers and they werent ready to take the old notes lying with me. Nor are the new Rs 2,000 notes of any use, because people know you cant buy daily essentials and get proper change with these, observes Awati. He, like many other onion growers, was looking at a bumper crop on the back of good monsoon rains this time. Last two years, we suffered from drought. The year, we have enough water, but this cash crunch has upset all our calculations, he points out.Watch what else is making news:Onion cultivation is a highly cash- and labour-intensive affair. Transplanting of rabi season onion  which has to be done within a month of sowing  starts from October-end and continues for the next two months. In some pockets, transplantation extends to even mid-January, though anything beyond December tends to severely impact yields. Around 60 per cent of transplantation happens between November 15 and December 15, and this is when labour demand is really high. On an average, about 40 farm hands are required to undertake transplantation operations over an acre in a single day. It costs about Rs 7,000 per acre, and may go up to Rs 8,000 if the labourers are not locally sourced. Harvesting labour also costs the same amount. Out of our total cultivation cost of Rs 40,000 per acre, Rs 14,000-15,000 is for labour, with expenses on fertilisers, pesticides and other inputs making up the rest, informs Awati. According to Santosh Gorade, a farmer from Takali Vinchur in Nashiks Niphad taluka, growing onions require twice as much labour as maize, moong (green gram) or wheat. Gorade managed to complete transplantation in two of his four acres land, when the sudden cash crunch forced him to suspend operations. The labourers in my field included 16 who were from various villages in Ratnagiri district. I had to tell all of them to leave, after they were half-way through their job. They were obviously not going to accept the withdrawn notes, he notes.Maharashtra produces roughly 30 per cent of Indias annual onion output of 185-195 lakh tonnes. Almost 60 per cent of it is from the rabi crop, which, depending upon the time of transplanting, gets harvested from end-February to mid-May. Rabi onions, especially from Maharashtra, are amenable to storage unlike the kharif (October-November harvesting) and late-kharif (December-January) crops. The stored rabi crop is what feeds the market during the April-September period, till the kharif onions are ready for harvesting.For farmers in Maharashtras onion belt  mainly Nashik, Ahmednagar, Pune and Dhule districts  the acute shortage of Rs 100 and Rs 500 notes to pay labour has affected transplanting operations. Data from the state agriculture department as on November 25 shows only 1.46 lakh hectares (lh) being planted to rabi onions. Last year, at this time, 2 lh had already been covered and overall acreage touched 2.5 lh, despite widespread drought conditions. The current years shortfall appears to be largely due to the inability to pay farm labour. Apart from local labour, the onion belt also engages farms hands from the Konkan region. They mostly comprise smallholder farmers, who, after harvesting paddy from their own fields in October, come to Nashik for transplanting of onion.Farmers like Awati and Gorade were keen to plant onions this rabi also because prices have recovered from their lows. The modal price of onion  the rate at which majority of trades happen  at Nashiks Lasalgaon wholesale market has risen from Rs 417 per quintal in September to Rs 587 in October and Rs 872 in November. Demonetisation has seemingly not just wrecked farmers plans, but also raised the possibility of prices climbing on account of lower rabi plantings. Deepak Chavan, director of Farm Features Private Limited, a Pune-based commodity research firm, believes that there will be significant price correction after March. Low mandi prices till a couple of months ago had already prompted farmers to switch to maize, wheat and chana (chickpea). The cash crunch post-demonetisation will only exacerbate the trend, he adds.While Chavan sees up to a quarter of the rabi onion area this time being diverted to less labour-intensive crops, Nanasaheb Patil, director of Lasalgaons agriculture produce market committee, thinks otherwise. His take is that the onion belt farmers have no real competing alternative cash crop. Yes, absence of ready cash to pay labour is an issue, but farmers will find a way out of this, including by involving family members and neighbours in transplanting and harvesting operations, claims Patil. But he, too, admits that the total rabi onion area in Maharashtra will barely match the 2015 level  which itself was below the average of 3 lh  notwithstanding the abundant water availability.If Gorade and Awati are bemoaning the sudden stop to their rabi onion transplantation operations, the situation is worse for Rambhau Gangurde, a farmer from Dighwad village of Nashiks Chandwad taluka. He is stuck with five acres of his late-kharif onions still to be harvested. In the normal course, I would have harvested it from the coming week, allowing me to also grow rabi onions in three acres. But with the cash crunch, both harvesting of my existing crop and transplantation of rabi onions look a tall order, he complains.But the worst hit are farm labourers, who, without any forewarning, have seen all work opportunities drying up. Sharad Borade and his two brothers eke out a living working for daily wages at others fields. Residents of Takali Vinchur, the same village to which Gorade belongs, they have now decided to travel 63 km to Malegaon, a city in Nashik district. Farmers here have no cash to pay us. So, we have no option but to look for work away from home, says Borade, who isnt sure, though, whether things are any better in Malegaon. This withdrawal of notes, we are told, is good for us in the long run. I, too, hope the present hardships are temporary, he sums up the situation.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

Instead, the cabbage took a tad longer and by the time a deal was made the agriculture market was reeling under a cash crunch that slashed prices of all farm produce.When Gunjal, a farmer from Khandgaon village in Ahmednagar district finally sold his cabbage, he got only Rs 6,000 for the entire acre of produce instead of Rs 80,000, the market price he could have got earlier.On the heels of three consecutive droughts and unseasonal rains, Gunjal and his family was counting on this cabbage field to make some headway in 2016. ``The money I would have got from the cabbage would have gone into planting of pomegranates in this season, paying back one installment of loan, running the house and paying labourers. Now, I have been left with half a field of cabbage that even the trader did not bother to take and will have to plough over it, said Gunjal, whose family including two other brothers owns 16 acres of land, where they grow vegetables, sugarcane and fodder crops.Like Gunjal, lakhs of farmers in rural Maharashtra are facing the brunt due to demonetization as the cash crunch has led to a drop in prices of farm produce. Majority of agriculture markets in the state that have so far been dealing solely in cash, were working at only 50 % or less of their capacities this month.With the district co-operative banks, where a majority of farmers have their transactions, not getting enough cash from the state banks, currency has only a notional value even for the relatively well to do sugar cane farmers, as they cannot withdraw money from their accounts. The result is that the entire cycle of transactions in the farm sector from commissioning agents to landless labourers, has been disrupted.`` My farm labourers have to be paid weekly in cash. I owe them Rs 20,000 already. I have had to let go of sowing in this rabi season because there was no money in hand. I lost 60 per cent of my last onion produce in the rains. The remaining 40 per cent or 100 quintals I brought to the market but traders have no money to pay me,  said Namdeo Karade, farmer from Ahmednagar in Western Maharashtra. ``I have sold my entire produce on trust to a trader; he will pay me when the cash is handy in a couple of days. I have never been paid in cheque before, what if it bounces?At the Sangamners APMC, traders and agents owe farmers like Karade nearly Rs 5.72 crore in the last 15 days. At the Ahmednagar APMC, that makes a profit of Rs 9.4 crore, nearly Rs 12.10 crore is pending in payments to farmers in the 14 days from November 8 to November 26.``We are functioning at 50 per cent of our capacity.. the cash crunch has slashed all prices especially of fruits, vegetables by 30 to 40 per cent. But, cheque payments have slowly started with 35 to 40 per cent of payments being done in cheques. It is going to be slow but the shift can be made as all farmers do have bank accounts. The problem is that clearance of cheques can take as much as 10 days, said Abhay Bhise, secretary of Ahmednagar APMC.By the time the shift to cheque payments is 100 per cent and farmers can actually get their hands on their hard earned cash, the rabi sowing season will be over. In this shift, many a small farmer, will be hit so badly that it will take him another year to recover, that too only if the monsoons are good.Rajaram Akolkar for instance is among those, who says, survival will be difficult. Akolkar drove on his motorcycle 53 kms from the drought prone Pathardi taluka to come to APMC in Ahmednagar, carrying with him one quintal of lemons, seeking a better price. He was however offered only Rs 8 for a kilo of lemons and he can return home with Rs 800, but this pricely sum includes one old Rs 500 note.`` I have no choice but to accept Rs 800 being offered to me, including one old Rs 500 note, stand in a queue to deposit the money and withdraw it. I have a Jan Dhan account in a nationalized bank but the branch is away from my village and will cost me one days work. I need the cash now, he asked. After demonetization, Akolkar was forced to abandon his 200 bags of onions in local market at Pathardi, for the lack of buyers. In APMCs, farmers like Akolkar sitting on gunny bags of produce from ginger to carrots, hunting for buyers and finally abandoning produce is not uncommon.READ MOREProtest against demonetisation in Mumbai: Congress leader calls Centre anti-poorDemonetisation effect: Fewer property registrations in Maharashtra"

(Source: File) Cash crunch has totally spoiled the business of fruit and vegetable vendors. (Source: File)A month after the withdrawal of high-denomination notes, agricultural remains one of the sectors hit hardest by demonetisation, as it grapples with major losses. While some farmers have incurred a loss as high as 60-70 per cent, rabi sowing has also taken a hit due to the cash crunch.The business of fruits and vegetables  from the farmers field to the consumers table  has always been cash-intensive, with barely any use of alternative modes of payment.As cash runs dry in rural areas, this business chain has all but collapsed, with little hope of a speedy revival. Shirram Gadve, president of the Vegetables Growers Association of India (VGAI), said the price of vegetables has dropped by almost 60 per cent across wholesale markets. Whatever sale is happening right now, it is distress sale, and thats causing major loss to the farmers, he said.Annually, the wholesale markets register trade of around Rs 1 lakh crore in the sale of fruits and vegetables. In fact, the months of November and December usually witness 10-12 per cent more consumption of vegetables than other months, due to easy availability and better prices.On an average, an acre worth of vegetables during this month fetches us Rs 1 lakh, but this year we have received only Rs 30,000 for that its such a loss, said Gadve. The onion trade also had seen losses, according to trade analysts, of around Rs 50 crore, as cash transactions have all but stopped. The poultry industry has also registered losses worth Rs 100 crore in Maharashtra.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

Photo: S SudarshanS SudarshanChief Minister Devendra Fadnavis on Friday made a detailed defense of his governments stand on reservation, saying it is committed to providing reservation to communities in the State. Several, including the majority Marathas, are agitating for reservation. His explanation, however, did not go down well with the Opposition, which staged a walk-out in protest.Speaking in the Legislative Assembly, he said that historically, the Marathas were given reservation during the rule of Shahu Maharaj, and later, the British. In 1965, this reservation was abruptly removed without giving any concrete reasons. This demand [for reservation] had been on for a long time, but the Mandal Commission deliberately denied reservation to the Marathas, calling them a progressive community. Its decision was never contested. Whenever this comes under judicial scrutiny, the court cites the [reports by] Mandal, Bapat and Khatri commission- which had denied reservation to the Marathas.He also alleged suspicious behaviour by previous governments, citing the appointment of Ravsaheb Kasabe on the Bapat Committee, which had resulted in the stalling of reservation to the Marathas, as an example.Blaming the Prithviraj Chavan government for letting errors enter the ordinance on Maratha reservation, Mr. Fadnavis also claimed the Rane Committee on Maratha reservation was never placed on record in court by the Congress-NCP regime. Arguments in the case, he said, were completed under the previous government.He said, Reservation is a constitutional provision and it should be given after fulfilling all constitutional procedures, or it wont withstand judicial scrutiny. Everyone tells us about reservation in Tamil Nadu, but Tamil Nadu did not have to face two judgements which bar reservation from crossing 50 per cent, and also allow judicial review of the Ninth Schedule.Maratha reservation was struck down by the court because the government could not show extraordinary circumstances needed to justify reservation, Mr. Fadnavis said. He added that his government has been studying the issue for some time now, and has taken advice from experts.We have also appointed two committees: the Tawade committee and one under the chief secretary. Senior lawyer Harish Salve has agreed to fight this case on our behalf without charging a fee. We have also collected all proofs of social and economic backwardness through scientific methods and a comprehensive affidavit, covering all the issues, has been submitted, he said.Mr. Fadnavis said all conditions imposed by the court have been fulfilled. It took some time because we did not want to go without complete preparation .Our government thinks Marathas need the reservation and they should get it. It is our commitment and we are ready to do every single thing required.He said the Khopardi gang-rape, which triggered the Maratha unrest, has been given to a fast track court for trial and senior lawyer Ujjwal Nikam has been appointed public prosecutor. The government wants death penalty for the culprits, he added.The CM also launched an attack on the Congress and the NCP, accusing them of remembering reservation demands only after losing 42 of the States 48 Lok Sabha seats in the 2014 general elections.Wont dilute or scrap Atrocities Act: CMAllaying fears of the Dalit community, Mr. Fadnavis ruled out any dilution or scrapping of The Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989. The Atrocities Act was brought to give justice to the section which faced exploitation for thousands of years, and this Act is needed even today. This Act cannot be diluted, so forget about scrapping it. But there are allegations of its misuse. Anyone who misuses the Act cannot be a follower of Dr. Ambedkar. If you look at the complaints, the section is not at fault but the action is. We will form a House committee with 40 per cent SC/ ST members to see if its misuse could be stopped. But there wont be a review of the Act.Mr. Fadnavis also said there will be no changes made to OBC reservation.While admitting that he had promised reservation for the Dhangar community within 15 days of coming to power in 2014, he hadnt been informed about the complete scenario.The Tata Institute of Social Sciences has been assigned a research proposal, which will be sent along with the recommendation of reservation. Its a constitutional process and we are fulfilling all our commitments towards this cause, he said. Mr. Fadnavis added his government was not opposed to reservation for Muslims. We wont go against the court order if it upholds it [Muslim reservation].The Chief Minister said there will beno changes madeto OBC reservationin Maharashtra"

However, since I did not have enough cash to pay him, I paid Rs 10,000 and told him to take the balance amount from me later,"" he said.While most of the transporters are accepting old banknotes, agents dread the time (December 15) when officials at the national highways stop accepting the old notes. Ilyas sells the onion and garlic he buys from the middlemen.""The middlemen too do not have enough cash, so they are buying only limited produce. We can't expect them to pay us the entire amount,"" he said, adding that his sales have been hit almost by 50%. Holding a torn 1,000-rupee note, he rues that a middleman, who wished to pay him in old notes, tore up the note out of frustration.

If we don't have money, how can we pay our labourers, farmer, and transporter? said Metharam Kriplani, president of Chamber of Azadpur Fruit and Vegetable Traders.Some market players said tax authorities have raided big traders in Azadpur, a major regional hub. Others said sellers were reluctantly accepting Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes from large buyers.For how long can you run a business in debt? Even paying half amount to farmers for their sale of produce is not solving the problem as it is leading to poor supplies and lowering the purchasing power of traders. The market will crash, said Mukesh Tiwari, past chairman of Ghazipur mandi. The solution is to install card machines, said Balkrishan Sharma, who buys vegetables worth Rs 1-2 lakh a day for 50-100 vegetable vendors.Kriplani, an apple trader, said prices have fallen in the past four days from Rs 30 to Rs 20 a kg. Its a big loss for farmers. Further, the business is down by 30%-40%.Agricultural markets look deserted and offer ample parking space and very few trucks. Onion trader Abid Ali of Abdul Alin and Company said the number of trucks from Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Karnataka, where the harvest was going on, has fallen. With lack of buyers  small street vendors, shopkeepers and aggregators for hotels and restaurants  the sale has crashed. Onion price in mandis is in the range of Rs 5-Rs 10 a kg, while in retail, it is selling at Rs 30/kg.Tuntun Bhagat, who retails vegetables in east Delhi, said. The first two days, I gave credit to regular customers, but since I didnt have the money, I couldnt get supplies. On Saturday, I stood in line for five hours and today I have been able to comake a purchase.With potato harvest season beginning in Punjab and Himachal, farmers and aggregators like Bilal from Una are not happy.

Excess production, especially in Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka, has been cited as the reason for the present glut, which had ensured that the prices remain subdued throughout the year.Earlier this year, the price of the bulb had touched an all-time low at Lasalgaon market as it was being traded at Rs 4.25 per kg  a record low in the last five years. In order to boost the price, the Central government had announced a 6 per cent export subsidy, which had helped in pushing some of the produce out of India.Jagdish Apsunde, an exporter from Nashik, said, at present, the Indian onions have good prices in UAE, Saudi Arabia, Malaysia and Sri Lanka. The minimum export price (MRP) is at zero and arrival of the bulb in the market is good. These two factors have at least ensured steady exports, he said. The export figures this year have surpassed the exports in the last two years. Apsunde said the Centre has been forthwith in settling subsidy claims, which has also helped exports.Nanasaheb Patil, director of Lasalgaons wholesale market, said steady exports have helped in holding the local prices. However, I feel the prices of onion at the wholesale markets will come down as soon as the bumper arrival of late kharif crop happens, he said.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

The onions arriving in the market at present are of the new kharif crop and their arrivals has increased at large. The daily arrival of onions at Lasalgaon is in the range of 18,000 to 25,000 quintals a day.""He added, ""This has led to decline in average wholesale onion prices by 27%. The price trend of onions is expected to be downward at least for next two-three weeks.""When contacted, Lasalgaon APMC chairman Jaydatta Holkar said, ""The rise in supply as compared to demand is the major reason that has led to onion prices declining to Rs 650 per quintal. The arrival of new kharif crop has increased at Lasalgaon at large, but demand is comparatively low.""The minimum and maximum prices were recorded at Rs 400 and Rs 840 per quintal, respectively, on Wednesday. Around 18,500 quintals of onions were auctioned at Lasalgaon on Wednesday.The supply of onions was comparatively low in November as the stock of summer onions had exhausted to some extent and the arrival of fresh kharif onions was also marginal.Onion auction had also been affected at Lasalgaon after the demonetisation. There was no onion auction for almost 10 days at Lasalgaon APMC last month due to non-availability of valid currency notes. Traders were also unable to make payment in cash due to cash crunch.Finally, the auction had begun after traders decided to make payment through cheques. The demonetisation had overall affected the onion auction and also reduced the demand."

(Express Photo: Gopal Kateshiya) Groundnut auction in progress at Gujarats Gondal APMC. (Express Photo: Gopal Kateshiya)AT 6 AM, theres still time for the auctions, but farmers have already filled a giant shed in this towns old APMC (agriculture produce market committee) yard with their fresh harvested vegetables. About half-an-hour later, a freshly shaven Ghanshyam Pokar, the auctioneer for Shree Patel Group, a leading commission agency-cum-trading firm here, arrives and is immediately surrounded by buyers that include vegetable vendors. The auction, then, begins with bids as low as Re 1 per kg, before settling at Rs 2 for brinjal. In almost all others  cabbage, cauliflower, red/green chilli, carrot, radish, lemon, spring onion and ginger  the prices dont exceed Rs 10/kg. By 8 AM, when Pokar has finally wound up, the entire produce in the shed has been auctioned off.Bakul Savaliya, a farmer from the outskirts of Gondal  40 km from Rajkot city and housing Saurashtras, and one of Gujarats, biggest APMC  doesnt hide his disappointment. The 50 kg of carrots that he brought fetched a mere Rs 4 per kg. Ive been coming here for the last 10 days and prices have never crossed Rs 8. At these rates, can I recover anything other than my own labour of digging out the carrots, cleaning and lugging them here? asks this 34-year-old who has grown the vegetable on his 20-bigha holding (six bigha make a hectare).Ramji Jamod, another farmer from Jamwadi, a village five km from Gondal, is similarly bitter about his 15 kg of green chillies grossing just Rs 150 at Rs 10/kg. He has reasons to be so: It is biting cold, especially when I have to ride my bike and be here by 5 AM to find enough space for unloading the produce. And at the end, what am I getting?Dhiru and Ashok Mer with their groundnut crop. (Express Photo: Gopal Kateshiya) Dhiru and Ashok Mer with their groundnut crop. (Express Photo: Gopal Kateshiya)Jamods sole consolation is that he has started getting payment in hard cash. After Notebandi  the NDA governments November 8 announcement scrapping the legal tender status of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 denomination currency notes  the Gondal APMC was closed for a couple of days.I tried hawking the vegetables myself, but found it too time-consuming and so returned to selling through the Shree Patel Group. They first did not pay anything for a whole week. Then, they paid Rs 7,000 in the old notes, of which I am still carrying Rs 4,000. But for the last two weeks, they have been paying in valid currency notes, says Jamod. While he attributes the fall in prices to notebandi, Pokar  whose firm earns a 6 per cent commission, charged on the price paid by the buyer, on top of a 0.7 per cent APMC user charge  blames it equally on the spike in arrivals from a good crop this time.The Class III-pass Jamod tills 50 bigha land taken on a three-year lease, costing Rs 80,000 annually. Paying it isnt an issue. My problem today is finding hard currency. The five quintals of kapas (raw unginned cotton) that I sold fetched me Rs 25,625, but the entire payment was through cheque. Since there was no cash, I had to borrow Rs 6,000 for paying the cotton pickers. I now need labour for picking the residual groundnut pods in the soil. As Im not sure when the cheque can be encashed, it looks we (wife and three children included) will have to do the job ourselves, he complains.Jamod, during the kharif (post-monsoon) season, had planted groundnuts in 30 bigha, cotton in 15 bigha and vegetables  mainly chillies and val papdi (broad beans)  in his remaining five bigha. He is yet to sell his 40 quintals of harvested groundnuts, waiting for prices to improve. Vegetable sales are keeping his family going for the time being.I have sold Rs 25,000 worth of produce so far. But I have also been spending Rs 2,500 per week on pesticides alone, apart from irrigating the standing chilly using tanker water. I have already purchased seven tanker loads, each costing Rs 1,500, notes Jamod. Given the acute water shortage, he has even resorted to harvesting tender green chillies. The ones that are half-ripe, he is allowing to further ripen, before harvesting, sun-drying and finally taking to the market.Meanwhile, in the Gondal APMCs new yard, Gujarats largest market for groundnut, the auctions start at 8:30 AM. On Monday  which saw arrivals of 16,043 bags of 35 kg each  the bids ranged from Rs 3,200 to Rs 4,305 per quintal. The average rate, at Rs 3,700 per quintal, was well below the Centres minimum support price of Rs 4,220.Among the 100-odd farmers waiting for their produce to go under the hammer is 35-year-old Dhiru Mer, who belongs to Kundani village in Rajkot districts Jasdan taluka. Although Jasdan has an APMC, he prefers travelling 80 km and paying Rs 2,000 to the trucker to sell at the Gondal yard, where prices are better. The auctioneer Hansraj Sardhara declares Mers two separate piles of groundnut sold at Rs 3,780 and Rs 4,055 per quintal. But Kishor Rajapara, who has placed the higher bid, is ready to pay Mer Rs 80,000 only through cheque. I feel bad, but we ourselves are being paid by cheque and banks are allowing us to make weekly withdraw of just Rs 50,000, states this trader. Mer picks out a Rs 20 note from his pocket, swearing he has nothing else  not even money to buy lunch.December is the peak season for groundnut arrivals. Normally, at this time, these would be one lakh bags daily, whereas we are hardly getting 15 per cent of that. Only farmers with debts to clear or having special family obligations are coming to sell, admits Jayantibhai S Dhol, chairman of the Gondal APMC.There is a dearth of buyers, too. The only ones active are the oil mills and even they arent stocking up. Farmers come to me every day demanding cash. But I am unable to oblige, because theres nobody to pay me by cash. I am issuing over 50 cheques daily, while running out of leaves every second day. There are many cases of delayed clearances and even bouncing of cheques, observes Haresh Vadodariya, a commission agent and also a director of the APMC.The cash crunch, post-demonetisation, has also slowed down rabi (winter) season plantings. Jayantibhai Hadwani, who cultivates 18 bigha in Navagam village of Junagadh districts Vanthali taluka, got 40 kg of coriander seeds from a fellow farmer, but had to spend four days in bank queues to deposit his old notes and withdraw new currency. On Monday, the 50-year-olds son lined up before the State Bank of Indias branch at Shapur, a nearby village, only to return empty-handed. Hadwani himself is owed Rs 15,000 by other farmers who had hired his tractor and thresher.Sagar Makadiya, a farmer from Khadpipli village in Junagadhs Mendarda taluka, has harvested 34 quintals of groundnut from eight of his familys 10 bighas. He does not want to sell at the current rates, but was forced to borrow Rs 5,000 to pay labourers for picking up the residual groundnut pods and prepare his field for sowing coriander. The coriander seeds and fertilisers, too, he purchased on credit. Last week, Makadiyas father sold three quintals of kapas from the remaining two bighas at Rs 5,140 per quintal. The trader who bought issued a cheque for Rs 16,000, which bounced, as the bank found that his fathers name had been spelt differently. So, Makadiyas father has gone back to the trader, requesting for a fresh cheque for the same amount.The worst-hit, though, are agricultural labourers. Six families from Nandurbar district of Maharashtra are currently camping in Khadpipli. Farmers here owe us over Rs 8,000. We want to return home, but the pending dues are holding us back, informs Sanjaya Nahade, who is one of those awaiting payment from equally cash-strapped farmers.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"
,,,,,,,58d927a9a3d24b224f2429c1,Farmers in Tears as Onion Prices Crash across MP,http://www.hindustantimes.com/indore/farmers-in-tears-as-onion-prices-crash-across-mp/story-SUXGaSi72DO4fHAYqEgxNL.html,2016-12-24,"For the second time this year the onion farmers of Mandsaur-Neemuch belt are being forced to sell onions at as low as Rs 1 per kg and many are abandoning their onion produce in the mandis to be consumed by cattle and the main culprit appears to be demonetisation, say those associated with the trade.Prices are holding at around Rs 6 per kg in Indore and neighbouring places at present, though for how long is debateable. According to state horticulture department, Madhya Pradesh is the second highest onion producer in the country with 2.65 million tonnes (2015-16), in 1,13,754 hectares, the highest being Maharashtra. Across the country, onion cultivation is spread across three seasons -- kharif, late kharif and rabi.In April, prices crashed to 20 paise per kg in RatlamWhen the rabi crop hit the market in April, prices crashed to 20 paise per kg in Ratlam and the situation was no better in Mandsaur and Neemuch, forcing the government to go in for purchase of onion at Rs 6 per kg. On Thursday, many farmers left their onion crop in Neemuch mandi when they were offered prices around Rs 1 per kg and in Mandsaur irate farmers stopped the bidding process for two hours when the opening bid for onion was Rs 1.50 per kg. The prices are hovering around the same level on Friday also. As of now, Markfed officials have ruled out any plan to purchase onions as they did in May this year.While excessive sowing by farmers in the rabi season (winter crop) was attributed as the main reason for the crash in prices in April, the Kharif sowing of onion has been 12 per cent lower this year compared to 2015. Kharif is the monsoon crop and at present those who had sown late are coming to the market with their produce.Explaining the impact of demonetisation, a mandi official who did not want to be identified said, all the small traders who used to bring in supply from small farmers in the hinterland have vanished due to shortage of cash and big traders appeared to have formed a cartel. The small traders used to act as counter-balance. Also small farmers are selling their produce at their nearest smaller mandi where prices are always 20 to 30 per cent less than bigger mandis. Due to swift communication in this technological age, the big traders are sourcing their produce from smaller mandis, which is leading to pressure on prices in the bigger mandis.Most traders prefer cash for which they do not pay taxesLack of cash has meant more cashless transaction which can come under the scrutiny of the taxman. The same mandi board official said, Most traders prefer cash for which they do not pay taxes, but now with cheque payment not only do they have to pay 7 per cent to 8 per cent tax, if they increase their turnover too much, they will invite attention of the tax authorities, so they are limiting their purchase.MP Kisan Ayog president Bansilal Gujar admits that demonetisation has had some effect on the prices, but he also attributes other factors too. Overall there is shortage of cash and while earlier one trader used to lend cash to another trader for the day (on a day when huge quantity of grains come to the market, the grain trader used to take money from say the onion trader) but this practice has come to a halt as there is not enough cash, Gujar says. He also attributes lack of communication between government department officials and farmers on what they should sow and how much. He also blames herd mentality of the farmers of sowing whatever his neighbour is doing for the problems.MP Horticulture director Satyanand said that local factors at the mandi could be responsible for the crash in prices of onion in Mandsaur-Neemuch as there is no spike in supply during this time of year. The rabi crop will arrive from February 2017, he said.State has increased storage capacity of onions by almost 50%Satyanand said that after Rabi glut the state has increased storage capacity of onions by almost 50 percent, but in Neemuch and Mandsaur they are yet to meet the target. Onions have to be stored in special storehouses and not in cold storages. Last year we have 80,000 store houses in the state, now it has increased to 1,20,000, with capacity ranging from 25 tonnes to 50 tonnes.Local mandi authorities in Neemuch and Mandsaur were unwilling to come on record for the reason behind the crash in prices. Neemuch mandi secretary R S Baghe said, I do not want to comment on this matter.Farmer woesFarmer Ramnarayan said that he was planning to buy a water pump from the proceeds of the onion crop, but when I reached here I came to know that the prices have crashed to Re 1 per kg.Farmer Lalaram Bhatt of Diken village was in tears after hearing the news of crash in onion prices. We are already facing cash shortage problems due to demonetization and this crash in onion prices is a double blow. At these prices, we wont be able to pay even for transport, he said.Farmer Prem Patidar said that input cost for producing onion crop on one Bigha land is about Rs 20,000. The production from one Bigha is about 5,000 quintal and today we are getting Rs 5,000 for this crop.Markfed bought 10.4 lakh quintal of onionsAfter onion prices crashed in April 2016, the Madhya Pradesh Marketing Cooperative Federation bought 10.4 lakh quintal of onions. It sold 1.46 lakh quintal of onions at PDS shops while 7.52 lakh quintals of onions were damaged. The government spent an additional Rs 90 a quintal to dispose the rotten onions, according to a Markfed official"

We have suffered losses around Rs 50 crore after demonetisation.""He added, ""We get grain from Central Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, and Gujarat, but suppliers are facing problems in paying the farmers. Farmers are not ready to accept payments through cheques and lower demand from locals have also added to the tension. The government does not want small traders to survive.""Another city-based trader Vivek Shetye said, ""I supply grain to Ratnagiri, Sindhudurg and Goa. But the demand from this region has reduced after demonetisation. The business has gone down by 40% and outstanding payments are also piling up. Best part is that there is no clarification from government side."""

As 2016 comes to a close, we analysed the status of these five problems, and challenges that will continue in 2017.1. Agriculture recovers, but benefits uncertain after demonetisationOver the fiscal year 2016-17, agriculturewhich employs more than 700 million peoplewill grow by 4%, estimated CRISIL, a research agency.Recovering from twoand some places even threeconsecutive drought years, agriculture, for the first time since 2013, saw a growth of above 3% in the second quarter of 2016-17, over the same period in 2015-16.Record summer crop production of rice, at 93.8 million tonnes, and pulses, at 8.7 million tonnes, is estimated in 2016-17, according to advance estimates by the agriculture ministry.Source: Key Economic Indicators, Office of the Economic AdvisorBut the withdrawal of old Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes in November 2016 has been a setback to the rural economyon which 800 million people, or 65% of Indias population, dependlargely driven by cash.Vehicles entering a rural market yard in Maharashtra dropped, onion prices halved in the biggest onion market in the country, the fishing economy in Goa faced roadblocks, and flower farmers in Madhya Pradesh lost business, as IndiaSpends visit to these regions revealed.Read | Farmers forced to dump their produce as note ban turns bumper crop worthlessSimilar reports from Uttar Pradesh, Odisha and other parts of the country appear to have dampened the bright agricultural prospects of 2016. But there is hope that cash pressures will ease in the long term, and the rural economy will be back to normal, according to a Livemint report.2. Good monsoon; India signs climate change agreement; India has half of the worlds 20 cities with the most toxic airFrom a severe drought in 11 states in June just before the arrival of the monsoon, Indiabarring Punjab, Haryana, Gujarat and Keralareceived normal rains in 2016. Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra received 20% more rain than normal.Overall, rainfall patterns have become more irregular over the last decade. Extreme rainfall events in central India, the core of the monsoon system, are increasing and moderate rainfall is decreasingas a part of complex changes in local and world weatheraccording to a clutch of Indian and global studies, as IndiaSpend reported in January 2016.Read | 116 farmers committed suicide in 2016; 10 states reeling under droughtIn 2016, India ratified the Paris Agreement, under which countries agreed to take steps to limit the rise of the earths temperature to under two degrees Celsius by the year 2100.India also signed a legally binding international agreement, starting 2028, to phase down the production and consumption of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs)gases that can have global warming potential up to 12,000 times more than carbon dioxide (CO2)as IndiaSpend reported in October 2016.Still, India will have to do more to prepare itself for the effects of climate change in the future. Between 2030 and 2050, a study, conducted by the University of Oxford, projected 136,000 climate-related deaths in India, according to an answer given by the environment ministry in the Lok Sabha (lower house of Parliament).Even as CO2 concentration levels in the world breached 400 parts per million, levels that will last our lifetime, thick smog engulfed the nations capital and other northern states, with the concentration of toxic particles reaching up to 45 times above safe levels set by the World Health Organization (WHO).Between 2011 and 2015, in a comparison of megacities with a population above 14 million, Delhis ambient air-pollution levels were worse than Beijing and Shanghai, according to an IndiaSpend analysis of 2016 WHO data. Indian cities make-up half of the worlds 20 most toxic cities, according to data from the WHO.3. India still home to 40 million stunted children, largest number in the worldEven with declining child undernourishment rates, India is home to over 40 million stunted children under five, more than any other country in the world, IndiaSpend reported in January 2016. Stunting refers to low height for age.Read | Children of hunger: Wasted young lives in the heart of IndiaIndia ranks 120 out of 130 countries in prevalence of wasting (15.1%), or low weight for height, according to the 2016 Global Nutrition Report, which ranks countries from lowest to highest prevalence.At current rates of decline in malnutrition, Indiacurrently lagging behind several poorer African countrieswill achieve the current stunting rates of Ghana or Togo by 2030, and that of China by 2055, stated the report.India also does poorly on indicators that could help reduce malnutrition.For instance, there is a link between improved health of the mother and lower stunting prevalence in children under five, IndiaSpend reported in January 2016. States such as Goa and Kerala, with 99% of institutional deliveries, had amongst the lowest levels of stunting in the country. But Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, states that have some of the highest levels of stunting, have just about 65% institutional deliveries.Improved sanitation also impacts the health of children, as seen in the state of Mizoram, which reported a 13% decline in wasting prevalence and 5% decline in underweight children in ten years, when there was a 10% improvement in household access to a toilet, IndiaSpend reported in January 2016. Still, there are 93.1 million households in rural India without access to a toilet.4. Education budget rose 4.8%, but millions are dropping out before secondary schoolLast year, we wrote about how India had reduced its education budget, even though the country has 282 million illiterate peopleequivalent to the population of Indonesiaand 18% of those who went to school were unable to complete secondary school.Read | Secondary education will empower India in the 21st centuryFor the financial year 2016-17, the central government budgeted Rs 72,394 crore on school education, higher education and adult literacy programmesa rise of 4.8% over 2015-16.Still, the 2016-17 budget amount is 12.5% less than the 2014-15 budget estimate, according to budget data. The government spent 16% less than the original budgeted amount of Rs 82,771 crore in 2014-15.Source: Union Budget, Ministry of FinanceFurther, challenges of retaining students in school remain, putting Indias large working population860 million by 2020at risk, IndiaSpend reported in May 2016.Net enrolment in primary education, the number of primary age school children enrolled in school, as a proportion of the total primary school age population, remained constant: 87.3% in 2015-16 compared to 87.4% in 2014-15, according to District Information System for Education data.Enrolment in secondary schools rose slightly, from 48.5% to 51.3%, which suggests that many students drop out before secondary schoolthat is, grade nine.Even fewer32.3%enrolled in higher secondaryclass 11 or its equivalentin 2015-16.5. Growth likely to be muted; opinion dividedTrade and growth forecasts for 2016 were lower than that of 2015, while declining wholesale inflation was not being passed to consumers, IndiaSpend had reported in December 2015.The move to demonetise Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes, announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, on November 8, 2016, is likely to slow down economic activity in 2017, but some experts say claims are exaggerated.Gross value added (GVA) growth for the financial year 2016-17 has been revised to 7.1% from the earlier estimate of 7.6% due to demonetisation, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said in its fifth bi-monthly monetary policy statement issued on December 7, 2016. Demonetisation is expected to affect cash-intensive sectors such as retail and transportation and reduce demand due to adverse wealth effects.Ambit Capital, a financial services firm, slashed its growth projection for the current year by 330 basis points to 3.5, BloombergQuint reported on December 19, 2016.Now heres the other side: Economists are talking nonsense on GDP decline, Aditya Puri, managing director of HDFC Bank, told Business Standard on November 30, 2016.Consumer inflation is expected to remain in single digits (5% in December 2016-March 2017 quarter), but there is a risk it could increase, the RBI said, due to volatility in global crude oil prices, increased turbulence in financial markets and the effects of demonetisation.This story first appeared on Indiaspend.
