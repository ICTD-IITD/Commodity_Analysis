Looking at the daily arrivals, it looks productivity is higher even though the acreage was lower, a senior agriculture ministry official said.Around 20% of the countrys total onion output is grown during the kharif season. Since the kharif onion cannot be stored, farmers sell off the produce in domestic as well as overseas markets.The arrival of quality onions has boosted exports in the last few weeks. About 13,56,381 tonnes of onions have been shipped abroad in the April-September period of this fiscal.The government is still assessing onion production figures for the 2016-17 crop year (July-June). Last year, the countrys onion output was higher at 20.99 million tonnes. Maharashtra contributes more than a quarter of the countrys overall output."

So, notebandias demonetisation is called colloquiallycouldnt have come at a worse time. With money sucked out of the market, there was a tomato glut, and prices crashed by 80%.A 15-kg crate of tomatoes traded this year between Rs 30 and Rs 50 (instead of Rs 700 at its peak), said Kumar. I had no reason to spend on transportation and bring it to the market or wait for the price to pick up. So, I uprooted all my tomato plants in late November to minimise the loss. This is the worst we have seen in my experience.Kolar is the biggest vegetable-growing region in Karnataka, and houses Asias second-largest tomato market. In November, the ruling price of tomatoes in the Kolar market was Rs 3-5 per kg, or 85% lesser than the same time in 2015.Kumars case is echoed across India. The price of tomatoes crashed to 25 paise/kg, The New Indian Express reported on December 10, 2016, which prompted farmers in a Chhattisgarh district to dump nearly 100 tractor-trolleys, or about 45,000 kg, of tomatoes, on a national highway.Similar incidents by frustrated farmers were reported in Nashik, Hyderabad and other key vegetable-growing regions.Worst hit: Southern tomato farmers, western onion farmersTomato farmers in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu were the worst hit since prices fell by 60-85% while onion farmers were the worst hit in Maharashtra and Gujarat, according to an IndiaSpend analysis of vegetable prices in seven Indian citiesAhmedabad, Bengaluru, Chennai, Hyderabad, Delhi, Kolkata and Mumbaibetween November 2015 and November 2016.Source: National Horticulture Board; Negative values indicate rise in pricesThe price of potatoes, which have a shelf life of up to 2-3 months, was stable in places such as Delhi and Chennai, while it rose between 17% and 25% in Bengaluru and Mumbai. The price of potatoes per quintal was Rs 1,086 in November 2015, increasing 27% to Rs 1,376 in November 2016.The price of peas dropped between 15% and 20%, with arrivals increasing in six cities, except Mumbai.The crash in prices was also due to oversupply, the data show. While the prices of tomatoes (hybrid variety) fell by 55-85%, the supply was double and even triple the previous year in parts of India, such as Ahmedabad, Kolkata and Hyderabad, according to data from the National Horticulture Board.In Chennai, for instance, the maximum price a farmer could get per quintal of tomatoes in November 2016 was Rs 760, compared to Rs 4,900 in November 2015, a drop of 85%. The supply to the city was 2,910 metric tonne, an increase of 40% from 2015.In Hyderabad, prices dropped 60% but supply increased 337% in November.Onions were traded anywhere between Rs 650 and Rs 1,500 per quintal in November 2016, compared to Rs 3,027 to Rs 5,600 in 2015.At the Lasalgaon Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) in Nashik, Maharashtra, Indias largest wholesale onion market, onions were sold at between Rs 5 and Rs 7 a kilogram.In the seven cities we analysed data for, supply was 196,400 metric tonne in November 2016, against 186,175 metric tonne in November 2015.The situation worsened in December, as prices fell by another 20-50%, and peas traded at a 10-year low in the Delhi market, according to officials from the horticulture department.Enough rains ensured a good harvest but low pricesThe monsoon rains would subside during September to November, and it would result in lesser yield, indicating lesser supply and higher prices, Bellur Krishna, managing director of the state-owned Horticultural Producers Co-operative Marketing and Processing Society, told IndiaSpend. This year, the rainfall was good in the vegetable-growing regions of Karnataka.This led to good harvest but the prices are also down due to the cash crisis triggered by demonetisation, he said.Kolar, Belagavi, Haveri and Chitradurga, the top vegetable-growing regions in Karnataka, received normal rainfall during the south-west monsoon in 2016.Karnataka declared a drought in 22 districts and some additional talukas in October 2016; the state received Rs 1,782 crore from the central government, IndiaSpend reported on January 10, 2016.The impact of demonetisation could only be to the extent of 20% of the price fall, said Krishna.Demonetisation is expected to hurt agriculture and informal-sector workers, IndiaSpend had reported on November 15, 2016.Around 9.4 million hectares, or 10% of Indias cropped area, is under vegetable cultivation, of which 50% is given to potato, onion and tomato, according to Horticulture Board data.Most of the transactions in fruits and vegetables are in cash, Brajendra Singh, director, National Horticulture Board, told IndiaSpend. So, demonetisation has definitely had some bearing. Arrivals had increased; so, the downturn was obvious.Tomato cultivation is usually routed through market clusters (around cities) and is profitable, Singh said.This time, it was available from local sources, said Singh. The price of tomatoes had gone up to Rs 50 a kg over the last two years. This year, the climate was favourable and resulted in bumper crops. Suddenly, the markets were depressed due to oversupply and because there was no cash.Singh predicted the situation would be normal over the next quarter, and crops would fetch a good price for farmers by the summer of 2017."

In a bid to match the demand and supply, the union government is planning to export most of the onions.The onion export of the country has increased to 16.43 lakh metric tonnes in the first seven months (April-October) of 2016-17 financial year, against 5.07 lakh metric tonnes in the corresponding period last financial year. This has not benefited the farmers as the wholesale onion prices have declined due to a rise in arrival of the produce while they are yet to manage their production cost. Due to this reason, the government has asked NAFED to export onions so that prices will get stabilised.The production of onions this year has been around 25 lakh metric tonnes. The minimum export price (MEP) of onions is zero and the government has introduced 5% subsidy (MEIS) for onion exporters from August 26, which will be in effect up to March 31. The export has not increased though.It costs farmers around Rs 950 per quintal for growing onions and they incur losses if they get a price below that. The average wholesale onion price at the country's largest wholesale market, Lasalgaon Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC), has declined to the range of Rs 500-550 per quintal, putting farmers in huge losses. While the daily arrival of onions is around 15,000 quintals a day at Lasalgaon, it has increased to the range of 30-35,000 quintals a day now.A NAFED source said, ""We have just conducted a survey at the Lasalgaon APMC to check the possibility of onion exports. We are mulling to export 30 metric tonne of onion a day. It is a part of the government policy to export maximum onions and stabilise the wholesale onion prices so that farmers will not incur losses. The money required for the export is to be used under the PSF."""

The minimum and maximum wholesale onion prices were recorded at Rs 251 and Rs 588 per quintal respectively on Tuesday. Around 25,000 quintals of onions were auctioned at Lasalgaon the same day.An APMC official said that the harvest of the highly perishable kharif crop is in full swing and it is highly perishable. ""Summer crop is stored for around six months, but the shelf life or kharif onions are less than one month. Farmers have no option, but to sell the commodity at the prevailing market rates. Currently, there have been huge arrivals in the market and it is almost double in the range from 25,000 to 35,000 quintals a day,"" the official said.Daily arrival is around 15,000 quintal a day and now stands at 25,000 to 35,000 quintal a day. Onion prices have continued to drop even after the government extended 5% Merchandise Exports from India Scheme (MEIS) subsidy for onion exporters up to March 31 because of the rise in arrival of onions. In the city's retail market, onions are being sold in the range of Rs 10 to Rs 15 a kg.Nanasaheb Patil, National Agricultural Co-operative Marketing Federation of India Ltd (NAFED) director, said, ""The production cost to grow onions is around Rs 950 a quintal and farmers incur losses if they get prices below that. The government has extended a 5% subsidy for onion exporters up to March 31, but the average wholesale onion prices have continued to decline. The rise in arrival of the crop as compared to the demand has led to the drop in wholesale onion prices.""He added that though the government has extended subsidy benefits to onion exporters, the export is not taking place as needed. So, wholesale onion prices have continued to decline in the past one month.Patil said that the government needs to make efforts to increase onion exports through central agencies like NAFED and Small Farmers' Agribusiness Consortium (SFAC). ""Such agencies should be given targets of 5 lakh metric tonne each under the Price Stability Funds (PSF) to stabilise onion prices in domestic markets,"" he said."

It takes about Rs 950 to produce a quintal of onions.Lasalgaon, the largest onion market in the country , is witnessing a glut. It is receiving 40,000 quintals of red onions daily against an average 12,000-15,000 quintals every day . The bumper crop has resulted in traders demanding more railway wagons to transport onions to other parts of the state and country.On Monday too, the rate was ranging from Rs 330 to Rs 600, depending on the quality and size of the crop. At the moment, stocks enough for four days' business are piled up at Lasalgaon and will require at least 40 rakes to transport. The traders have got only get 15 wagons so far.""There has been a close to four times jump in the amount of crop that comes to the market yard.But there has not been any increase in the transportation facilities despite writing to the government,"" said Jaydutta Holkar, chairman of the Lasalgaon APMC. If the traders were to use road transport, they would require 200 trucks per day , as they can carry only 20 tonnes each. They are also more expensive than the railway wagons.The situation outside the farmers bringing truckloads of produce and not finding even a place to park.""The shelf life of these red onions is one month and currently, it is peak harvest season.Farmers are being forced to accept whatever price as the shelf life is so low and they cannot afford storage costs,"" said an APMC official.This year, the onion crop has been unrewarding for farmers because of high production.Huge losses were also reported due to the four-day traders' strike at Lasalgaon in August 2016.The summer onion crop, whose season ended in October, also fetched low prices. Lack of proper storage facilities and a skewed supply-demand ratio meant that farmers recorded a cumulative loss of 20 lakh tonnes of the summer crop.The state decision to give Rs 100 per quintal to farmers hasn't worked out yet since the Centre, supposed to foot half the bill, has not approved the scheme."
58f57f577be9e01a357a1cd1,Monsoon failure dips prices of turmeric in Erode markets,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/coimbatore/monsoon-failure-dips-prices-of-turmeric-in-erode-markets/articleshow/57175753.cms,2017-02-16,"Cleared/AliCoimbatore: The monsoon failure has begun to wreak havoc on prices of newly harvested kitchen essentials. While turmeric prices are showing signs of falling despite the harvest season setting in, prices of small and big onions have risen by 30% in the last two weeks. Farmers attribute the change in prices to the fall in quality of the turmeric yield and drop in the quantity of the small onion yield.Turmeric farmers in Erode say the acreage under full-fledged cultivation of the spice had fallen from 10,000 hectares in 2015-'16 to less than 7,000 hectares in 2016 because of the complete failure of the southwest and northeast monsoons. The lack of rainfall and moisture led to the yield of the crop falling by almost 50%, says P K Deivasigamani, secretary of the Turmeric Farmers Association of India.The present situation would naturally create a short supply of turmeric in the market thereby fall in price of the spice. In Perundurai wholesale market, the price of turmeric on Tuesday fell from Rs 8,500 to Rs 8,000 per quintal. ""Good quality turmeric coming in from Mysore is still selling at Rs 8,500 and Rs 8,700 a quintal in Erode market,"" says general secretary of the Federation of All Trade and Industries' Association, Erode, V K Rajamanickam.""However, the prices are dropping in most markets because they are being flooded with stored turmeric harvested as long as two years ago. Their quality is not good,"" he said.The turmeric harvest season in the western region, especially in Erode which is considered as one of the largest turmeric producing districts in the country, begins immediately post-Pongal. However, this year due to the drought that prevailed throughout 2016, the harvest was postponed by most farmers.""There are a lot of farmers who despite the drought sowed turmeric in at least half their land. But they are unable to harvest it because the crop has not even matured and has even begun drying up. So they can't cut it,"" says Raja Manickam. ""The yield is very low,"" he adds.Agriculture marketing experts believe that the drop in cultivation and yield of turmeric in Erode will lead to the turmeric yield in Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra setting the price trend for the spice.""Usually the yield and prices in Erode set the trend for turmeric pricing across the country, but this year since the rain was better in Maharashtra and central India leading to their yield being better, they would become the bigger market players. Their produce will even start flowing into western region markets,"" says Rajamanickam.On the other hand, shoppers saw the prices of both small and big onions go up by almost 30%. ""The price of small onions, which were around Rs 18 to Rs 20/kg around 10 days ago at Raja Street vegetable market, went up to Rs 30 in Uzhavar Sandhais and all retail shops,"" said a housewife in R S Puram, S Saraswathi. ""The price of big onions too which were around Rs 15/kg went up to Rs 20 last week,"" she said.Onion wholesalers say the prices went up because the supply had begun falling over the past 10 days or so. ""Usually 3,000 sacks of small onion are unloaded at MGR Market every day, but the number has fallen to 2,000 sacks. So farmers have begun charging Rs 15 to Rs 18/ kg as the wholesale rate, so the prices have gone up in the retail market,"" said D Sivaraj, a wholesaler at T K Market."

(File Photo)NCP MP Supriya Sule has alleged that Maharashtra governments anti-farmer policies and failure to provide adequate remunerative prices for agricultural produce have broken the backbone of farmers. Because of the anti-farmer policies of the government and not providing adequate remunerative prices for their agricultural produce like onion, soyabean and pulses, the backbone of the farmers has been broken, Sule said.Watch What Else Is Making NewsShe was addressing public meetings at Yeola and Atgaon here yesterday ahead of the elections to Nashik Municipal Corporation, panchayat samiti and zilla parishad.Criticising the demonetisation move, the NCP leader said that, The Modi government at the Centre took votes in 2014 and notes in 2017.The farmers were destroyed, she said while alleging that the government has also forgotten its assurance of giving adequate support prices for their agricultural produce.Earlier, we welcomed Prime Minister Modis demonetisation move, but in an attempt to pull out blackmoney (from the system), the government caused hardships to the common man, Sule said.The government even kept an eye on gold ornaments of women, she said.During her visit to Yeola, Sule met farmer Krishna Dongare, who had set ablaze the onion crop on 2.5 acres of his land on Tuesday out of frustration, after the prices crashed.I have spent Rs three lakh on the onion crop in my field, but traders have stopped buying the produce in auctions. Farmers are staging road blockades in the district demanding better prices. The demand was also hit by the demonetisation. If I sold my crop today, I would get only Rs 60,000, Dongare had earlier said.Sule said the burnt onions will be presented to Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis and Shiv Sena president Uddhav Thackeray.According to traders, onion prices fell to around Rs 100-150 per quintal at some places for past several days and farmers were not recovering even the input costs.The APMC centres in the district, including those at Mungse and Zodge, have stopped auctions of onion, as it is not possible to send the crop to markets across the country due to shortage of railway wagons, the traders had said.NCPs women state chief Chitra Wagh, MLC from Nashik Jayawant Jadhav and some local leaders were present during Sules public meetings.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

NCP leaders like Dhananjay Munde and Supriya Sule have been campaigning in Beed and Marathwada respectively, where ZP elections will be held.For the BJP, which stands fourth in terms of its presence in ZPs, the elections are of major importance to achieve its dream if a Congress-free State. The party had allotted districts to a State minister for managing the campaign, and has presented Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis as its star campaigner with development as its agenda. The civic polls are important to leaders like Pankaja Munde and State party chief Raosaheb Danve in their home districts of Beed and Jalna respectively.The Shiv Sena, meanwhile, has focussed on Mumbai and Thane, leaving rest of the State to local leaders.The NCPs Nawab Malik said the party is aiming at big wins in the first phase, and continue the trend in the remaining phases.

Dilip Kagda A day after her visit to Nashik, Sule tweeted about the destruction of standing crop of onions by farmers due to low prices. Dilip KagdaOnion prices have become a political issue in the wake of Nashik local body elections. A day after NCP MP Supriya Sule raked up the issue of low onion prices, the Shiv Sena also has followed suit. Hovering between Rs 4 and 5 per kg, onion growers in Nashik have been complaining of losses over the last two years. Despite a steady increase in export, onion prices have remained low. With the late Kharif onion peaking in the markets, chances of any price correction appear dim in the days to come. In view of the low prices, the Central government has also increased the window to avail export subsidy. In view of the bumper arrival of onions, there has been no price corrections till date.Watch what else is making news:A day after her visit to Nashik, Sule tweeted about the destruction of standing crop of onions by farmers due to low prices. Sules tweet comes at a time when NCP is trying to keep control of the Nashik Zilla Parishad. The long incarceration of the former leader Chhagan Bhujbal over alleged charges of corruption has weakened the party in Nashik. Both Shiv Sena and BJP are trying hard to wrestle the local body from NCP.Nashiks rural areas have been worst hit due to demonetisation with onion sowing taking a dip in need for cash. Onion being a cash and labour intensive crop, sowing for the all-important Rabi onion has been lesser than expected. Low price realisation has weaned off some of the farmers away from onion to crops like corn. Unrest among its members had also resulted in Swabhimani Shetkari leader MP Raju Shetti to announce support for Shiv Sena in the local body elections. Santosh Gorade district youth president of the outfit said that a large number of party functionaries were on the verge of resigning in March. The state government has not done anything to help us. As onion growers we could not be blind to the pains of the growers and yet remain mute, he said. Shettis announcement of support toShiv Sena, Gorade said helped them change their mind. The BJP will not be able to make any effect in the rural areas, people are against them, he said. Jaydutt Holkar, the chairman of Lasalgaon market committee has recently joined Shiv Sena, while Nanasaheb Patil a director of the committee had joined BJP.

She added, In an attempt to pull out black money, the government caused hardships to the common man.During her visit to Yeola, Ms. Sule met farmer Krishna Dongare, who had set ablaze his onion crop on a 2.5 acre land on Tuesday, after the prices crashed.Earlier, Mr. Dongare had said, I have spent Rs. 3 lakh on the onion crop in my field, but traders have stopped buying the produce in auctions.He added, Farmers are staging road blockades in the district, demanding better prices. The demand was also hit by the demonetisation. If I had sold my crop today, I would have got only Rs. 60,000.

The farmers have had a bumper crop this year, in comparison to the last three years.The provision for a new rake comes after the meeting between the and district administration of railway officials, where the former demanded for more rakes to supply onions.Unlike the existing system where all the onion laden goods trains head to Fatuha (Fatwa) junction in Bihar for unloading, the harvest will now be taken to Sitapur, Ranipatra, Dankuni and Malda. The rakes usually carry onion from Niphad, Kherwadi, Manmad, Lasalgaon, Dhule, Chalisgaon, Nandgaon and Nashik.An official of the Bhusawal Division of Central Railways said that it has been decided that the number of rakes to carry onions will only be four from now.""We will have the rakes as ordered by the minister, but it is likely that if the turnaround time takes longer, then the situation will be difficult,"" a railway official said.The onion merchants have welcome the move of the Central Railways. An onion merchant, Sohanlal Bhandari said, ""Since the Railways are now ready to take the onions to other destinations, we have decided to book the goods for different places instead of just focussing on Fatuha.""The new rake will enhance the carrying capacity of the onions by 30%."

What's more, it may also be sweeter and better than the current crop.The Directorate of Onion and Garlic Research (DOGR) of the Indian Council of Agriculture Research (ICAR) has developed a new onion variety called 'multiplier onion variety,' which would make this possible.It is presently undergoing tests at multiple locations in Maharashtra, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Gujarat to evaluate its performance in different weather conditions. Scientists said initial findings of the tests are positive and have achieved the desired results so far.They added that the variety is expected to be released nationwide in 2019.Project leader Amar Jeet Gupta of DOGR told TOI, ""There is no special variety of onion for south Indian dishes that has been released at the national level. So far, farmers of Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh are cultivating varieties developed by Tamil Nadu Agriculture University (TNAU). But the yield of these varieties is limited. Hence, we decided to develop the special variety, which can be recommended at national-level for other states farmers to grow it.""The variety, named DOGR-1549-Agg, is the first multiplier onion genotype registered with the ICAR-NBPGR (National Bureau of Plant Genetic Resources) in New Delhi.Commenting on the variety's strength, Gupta said, ""It matures early and is suitable for both Kharif (July-October) and Rabi (October-March) seasons. It has an average yield potential of 22 tonnes to 24 tonnes per hectare."" Gupta added that the variety has six small bulbs per cluster.Presently, farmers in South India are growing TNAU-developed onion variety called CO(On)5, which can grow only in Rabi season and has a yield capacity of 18.9 tonnes per hectare. Each cluster of this variety produces three to five bulbs, Gupta said.TNAU's horticulture department head T Saraswati told TOI, ""This is a positive development for growers as they can get high harvest. Secondly, if this variety is released nationally, states other than the southern ones can also grow it.""When specifically asked about the taste of the newly-developed variety, Gupta said, ""Total Soluble Solids (TSS) is a crucial factor as it defines sugar percentage in the onion. The TSS of CO(On)5 is around 12%, whereas TSS in our variety is between 16% and 22%. Hence, it will be suitable for South Indian dishes."""

Cost of production for a quintal is Rs 950. Prices were the highest in 2013, with farmers fetching Rs 1,424 a quintal.Officials said the dip in price is due to bumper production in the state.

The research presents a microcosmic example of how indiscriminate digging of farm ponds has accelerated the rate of groundwater extraction.The scheme was launched in December 2014 by Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis-led State government with an objective to harvest rainwater and enhance groundwater levels. However, the project has run into stormy weather for its haphazard and unscientific implementation, undue reliance on machinery, lack of transparency and public participation.Amruta Pradhan, a researcher with the SANDRP, said, While the government is taking credit for providing a small scale irrigation facility at the farmers doorstep, it is reluctant to take the responsibility of their unsustainable use. Majority of the scheme work has been implemented unscientifically. While one can see water as of now, it does not mean groundwater recharge has taken place.Ms. Pradhan dismissed the usefulness of plastic-lined farm ponds, remarking they were just another layer of exploitative unsustainable infrastructure, which would only help accelerate the process of groundwater depletion.Besides borewells, Pravara river (a tributary of Godavari river) is a major water source to the Hiwargaon village. Almost 80% of its ponds are dependent on groundwater, with most of them dug between 2012 and 2015 with the help of subsidies offered under the National Horticulture Mission (NHM).The 300-odd ponds in the village are the main source of sustenance for the pomegranate-dependent agro economy. The arrival of ponds has led many farmers to shift to horticulture, with pomegranate cash-crop rapidly supplanting the traditional horsegram (bajra), wheat, pulses and onion crops.Issues with the schemeMost farmers in the village, as in Westerns Maharashtra's horticultural belt, swear by the farm ponds, unmindful, however, of the consequences of groundwater depletion owing to their unregulated construction and digging.The SANDRP study revealed that none of the farm ponds in Hiwargaon had inlets and outlets or any other arrangement for excess rainwater inflow that was envisioned in the scheme. Instead of digging the ponds in a low-lying area, many of them are dug on the highest points of the farms.It further noted that soil conservation is the key to groundwater recharge, but it has been omitted in the scheme.Water conservationist Vijay Anna Borade said, Any programme claiming to deal with recharging groundwater has to pay attention to the soil. If soil is conserved, groundwater is automatically recharged. In the Jalyukt Shivar works, soil, fine sand and all the medium which hold the water and percolate it have been scrapped. If the rocks are exposed, then how is the recharge supposed to take place?He added that the works under the scheme appeared to hold water, but would not recharge it.Another problem with the farm ponds is that they expose the groundwater to losses through evaporation, something that may not become immediately apparent.Ponds for allAccording to data, around 13,950 ponds were dug between 2014 and 2016 under the NHM, the JSY and the Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana, while nearly 24,700 more were under construction under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) in 2016-17.Till date, a staggering 1.6 lakh-odd applications have been received by local authorities under the Magel Tyala Shet Tale (Farm Pond on Demand scheme) ever since Mr. Fadnavis launched it in February 2016.Ms. Pradhan said, The Jalyukt Shivar programme and its ancillaries are a quick fix that have failed. The government has not taken into account the massive amount of work that goes into involving people in carrying out watershed works. The Fadnavis government has also paid [little consideration] to the educative process regarding judicious use of water.While local authorities said they are aware of the concerns engendered by the indiscriminate digging of farm ponds, they find regulation impossible.The sub-divisional officer of Sangamner said, Once the farmer constructs the pond, it is impossible for us to tell him not to use it for groundwater storage. Authorities said they were attempting to initiate dialogue with farmers in a bid to impress on them the judicious use of farm ponds."

He added that the total cost of the area that had not been handed over to MHADA was around Rs. 6,000 crore.Mr. Waikar said, The matter will be probed transparently by SIT. He also assured the Assembly that action would be taken against developers of projects where no work had been done in the last eight to ten years.As per the rules, the developer must hand over the area under which redevelopment has taken place to MHADA.

In spite of heavy rains and a spurt in farm productivity, the scourge of suicides continues to spread. The highest number of suicides was in Beed (23), hometown of rural minister Pankaja Munde, followed by Nanded (22), Osmanabad (19), Aurangabad (18), Jalna (14), Parbhani and Hingoli (8 each) and Latur (5). Of the 117 cases, financial aid was provided to 46 families of the deceased. But 13 were denied relief and 58 proposals are still being processed.Head of a state-level task force on farmer welfare, Kishore Tiwari, said while the government had taken various measures, the results were not visible. ""We'll have to redraft our strategy to halt farmer suicides,"" Tiwari said. ""We will have to provide remunerative prices for agriculture produce, along with market intervention. A plan needs to be worked out to provide education to farmers' children and financial assistance for healthcare.""In 2016, production of tur, tomato, onion and most vegetables doubled and even tripled but farm gate prices dipped. Onion was sold for Rs 460 per quintal as against the production cost of Rs 950. Tur farmers were paid less than the minimum support price (MSP) in wholesale markets. The MSP for tur was Rs 5,050 and traders were purchasing it at Rs 4200-4400 per quintal.However, a comparison with figures for the previous year show a marginal decline in toll. According to data, 3,052 farmers ended their lives in 2016, of which 1,053 cases were from Aurangabad, which falls in Marathwada region. The 117 cases recorded in 2017, if seen against the average bi-monthly rate for the previous year, indicates a slight downturn. Incidentally, the same trend is visible for 2015 and 2016. Against a total of 3,052 farmers who killed themselves in 2016, the toll was higher at 3,228 in 2015, which was a drought year.Leader of opposition Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil said over the last two and half years, 9,000 farmers have killed themselves. ""We demand that Fadnavis declare a total loan waiver to protect the farmers' lives."" Patil led an opposition delegation recently which called on Governor Vidyasagar Rao to press for their demand."

Onions continue to fetch Rs380-460 per quintal, as against the production cost of Rs 950 per quintal at the Lasalgaon AMPC market , Asia's largest onion market yard. Compared to last year, there has been over-production of 25 lakh metric tonnes of onions.Although only about 10% onions grown in the country have been exported, the figure is important to keep price parity in wholesale markets.Exporters said the central government's decision of giving a 6% export subsidy helped push some of the produce out of India.According to figures from the market committee, a daily supply of 30,000-35,000 tonnes is coming in to the market yard, as against 12,000-15,000 tonnes last year.Due to good rain and increase in area under production, it has been a bumper crop but the prices that slid last December due to demonetisation are struggling to stabilize even now, the fag end of the season.An exporter from Nashik said there was demand for Indian onions abroad and they fetched good prices. UAE, Saudi Arabia and Malaysia are some buyers.Bumper production in states like Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka too has been cited as the reason for the glut, which had ensured that prices remain subdued throughout the year. State government officials said there have also been issues with storage in market yards. The entire dip in price and other losses due to rotting and lack of storage capacity is estimated to be close to Rs 800 crore."

(Photo: Partha Sarathi Biswas) Beekeeper Dinkar Patil (centre) with pomegranate farmers of Agoti village in Maharashtras Pune district. (Photo: Partha Sarathi Biswas)As Dhananjay Takle moves around the fruit-laden trees in his three-acre pomegranate farm, he cant but recall the scene just over five months back. This farmer from Agoti village in Indapur taluka of Pune district had a real scare when the same 1,000-odd trees werent setting fruit, despite good flowering.Watch What Else Is Making NewsI had planted pomegranate for the first time and invested around Rs 6 lakh in inputs, including labour. The trees started flowering towards September-end. But the flowers, instead of developing into fruits, were simply dropping, he notes. Consultation with other farmers in his village revealed that the flower drop had to do with the lack of pollination. There werent enough honey bees and other pollinating insects in and around his fields to transfer pollen from the stamen (male organ) of one flower to the stigma (female part) of the other. The result: No fertilisation and fruit formation.Takle, then, followed the advice of his fellow-farmers: Take beehive boxes, each containing a colony of 20,000-30,000 insects, on hire and install them in the field, as some of them had done earlier. I contacted Dinkar Patil, a bee keeper from Latur, who rented out three boxes for my orchard. By early November, 90 per cent of the trees started bearing fruits and I hope to harvest around 20 tonnes of pomegranate in the next 15 days. Without those bees, all my hard work would have gone waste, he says.The importance of honeybees to agriculture  more specifically, the role that the tiny-winged insects play in pollination  is too well-known to require elaboration. Not as well recognised a reality, however, is the destruction of beehives that the indiscriminate usage of pesticides have wrought and, in turn, contributed to a not-insignificant agricultural crisis. Theres no better proof of that than farmers like Takle today having to hire beehive boxes to aid in pollination.Highly cross-pollinated crops like onion, cotton, oilseeds and most fruits and vegetables depend entirely on winged insects that, during their flights to collect nectar, also transport pollen from one flower to another. Honeybees are best suited to perform this function. Our experiments have shown an average 30 per cent increase in crop yields  from 17-19 per cent for cotton to 48 per cent in sunflower and 150-170 per cent in lychees  if honeybees are artificially introduced in the fields during the flowering stage even in normal conditions, informs Laxmi Rao, assistant director of the Pune based Central Bee Research and Training Institute (CBRTI).Not for nothing, then, that as pollinator insect populations have seen reduction  linked to factors from widespread pesticide application and mono-cropping to climate change  it has spawned a business of artificial introduction of beehive boxes. In Maharashtra, there are professional beekeepers now charging farmers anywhere from Rs 1,000 to Rs 3,000 for renting out boxes for a month.Dinkar Patil has doing this for the last 15 years. Proprietor of the Latur-based Patil Bee Keepers, he was initially supplying beehive boxes to companies producing onion and vegetable seeds. But in recent years, he has noticed an increasing demand from even farmers for his pollination services. Much of it is from pomegranate, oilseeds and mustard growers, who have reported sharp dip in the natural bee numbers in their areas. The demand-supply gap is huge, because I myself get queries for 5,000 beehive boxes a year, but am in a position to fulfill barely a fifth of these. There were orders for around 500 boxes from pomegranate farmers in Indapur alone last year, but I could provide only 50, claims Patil, who owns and rents out 700 boxes round the year.A beehive box placed in a pomegranate orchard. (Photo: Partha Sarathi Biswas) A beehive box placed in a pomegranate orchard. (Photo: Partha Sarathi Biswas)Beekeeping, promoted as a cottage industry by the Khadi and Village Industries Commission, has so far focused mainly on honey. But now, a new demand avenue has opened up for beekeepers  in the form of pollinators-on-hire services. The beehive boxes are kept for a month or so during the flowering season. Once fruit-setting happens, the boxes are removed and taken to the field of the next crop whose flowering is due. Since flowering happens for different crops all through the year, barring the peak summer and monsoon months, there is a steady demand for the services offered by the likes of Patil.Patil maintains colonies of Apis mellifera or European honeybees that normally travel within an area of four square-km area to collect nectar and pollinate flowers. On the other hand, Vipin Mahajan, another beekeeper from Talegaon Dabhade, a town in Punes Mawal taluka, employs Apis trigona bees. The former species require regular supplementary feeding of concentrated sugar solution to ensure no starvation, but the bees dont migrate and farmers only need to install one box per acre.The trigona bees require less maintenance, but the requirement is three boxes per acre. Also, mellifera beehives can survive for three years, whereas trigona hives need to be re-populated every year.According to CBRTIs Rao, the lack of trained bee breeders is a major concern. This is even more so in a scenario where the destruction of the natural habitat for bee populations is already impacting pollination in major crops. There can be no second Green Revolution without conservation of honey bees. Farmers need to be sensitised about the importance of the winged visitors to their fields, she points out.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Representational Image.This summer, tomato prices might see a spike as tomato plantations in Maharashtra have seen a sharp drop in output. Lack of ready cash with growers and an infestation of white flies is being attributed to the drop, which has affected the entire state. As against the 34,500 hectares of plantation used to cultivate tomato during summer, this year the state has seen 31,012 hectares of farmland used for the crop. The dip in area is significant in the tomato-growing districts of Pune, Nashik, Satara and Sangli.Watch What Else Is Making NewsDeepak Bhise, president of the Tomato Growers Federation of Narayangaon in Junnar taluka of Pune district, claimed that demonetisation was to be blamed for the dip in cultivation area as farmers didnt have enough cash. Tomato is a cash-intensive crop as farmers require costly inputs on an average, an acre of crop would require Rs 70,000 as input cost, he said.Currently, demonetisation and a sharp fall in prices of almost all farm produces have shaken the economics of rural areas, making farmers wary of heavy investments. Bhise, who normally plants five acres of tomatoes, has only planted three acres of the crop this year. Another reason for lesser cultivation is the apparent infestation of white flies in tomato-growing areas. Increase in onion acreage in the last few years has increased the prevalence of white flies in these areas. This pest destroys tomato crop, so many farmers have not opted for tomato this season, he said.According to traders at the wholesale markets, lesser agricultural area for tomatoes would result in an increase in the price of the vegetable in the days to come.In June last year, tomato prices had crossed the Rs 70 per kg mark in retail markets in many parts of the state, as a severe drought had destroyed the rabi crop. This year, lesser cultivation may also result in a spike in prices.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

The strike is set to enter the fourth day on Monday. While prices of some vegetables have crashed, there's glut of others because they aren't being lifted from the city and its neighbouring villages. Also, some vegetables have become dearer as they aren't being ferried to the city, leading to a shortage.""I got my last delivery of onions three days ago. I was supposed to receive another shipment on Monday, but now that doesn't seem likely,"" said Seyid, 21, a vendor in KR Market . While Seyid continued to sell onions at the same price as before, he said he might be forced to jack up the rates if he doesn't get new stock soon.Pushpa and Venkateshappa get their provisions from the Kalasipalya wholesale market. The couple normally trades in cauliflowers, drumsticks and carrots. ""It's very bad. We last got a delivery two days ago. We haven't been getting anything fresh. The cauliflowers have begun to rot. I usually sell each cauliflower head for Rs 25-30. Now, with everything spoiling, I wouldn't even get Rs 10 for a piece,"" said Pushpa, adding normally she would sell carrots and drumsticks for Rs 15-20 per kilo, but the prices have shot up to Rs 35-40 due to the strike.Pyarejaan, 64, who gets onions from the Yeshwanthpur APMC four times a week, said he hasn't faced any problem so far, but might in a couple of days when he'll run out of stock. Ibraz Khan, a wholesaler in Kalasipalya, gets his produce from Karnataka, Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh. While his prevailing stocks will last for a few days, he says he isn't receiving new shipments.""If there is a shortage of a particular vegetable, the price will rise. But if there is an excess, we'll have to lower the prices substantially,"" he said. ""Since truckers are on strike in south India, I'll have to pay Rs 5,000-15,000 extra to those ferrying potatoes from northern states,"" he added.Ilias, a potato, onion and garlic wholeseller, said that his stock will last only two more days. ""Price per bori (50kg sack) has gone up by Rs 50. Additionally, we were earlier selling onions at Rs 10 per kg; now the price has increased to Rs 15,"" he said.""As of now vans and tempos seem to be doing most of the transporting, something that may not be sustainable in the long run as they aren't equipped for inter-state deliveries,"" he added.Vendors in Russel Market were largely unaware of the ongoing strike and said business is continuing as usual. Aslam Amin, a vendor, said three tempos come from the City Market every day with his stock, and that the strike hasn't disrupted this schedule. ""Our stock will last for another week, so we haven't been affected. However, if the strike continues, we might have a problem,"" said Mushtaq Ahmed, a vendor who gets his vegetables from Yeshwantpur and Kalasipalya markets.Noor, a small-time vendor, gets 10-15 kg of each vegetable every day, but received his last shipment two days ago. ""If this goes on, I won't have anything to sell,"" he said.Truckers are protesting the Centre's move to scrap old vehicles and levy toll on state highways, and are demanding a reduction in third-party premium paid to insurance firms.Not in a mood to relent, truckers intensified their strike on Sunday with nearly 23 lakh vehicles transporting important commodities staying off the roads.G R Shanmugappa, president of the Karnataka State Lorry Owners and Agents Association, said they'd continue their protest till they get a response from the central government and the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA).""Some 23 lakh trucks stayed off the roads on Sunday throughout the south zone. We have also got an assurance from LPG association workers that they'll support us in our protest. There are only three filling stations for the four southern states - in Mangaluru, Vizag and Salem and they have informed us that they'll not go in for filling. We are also in talks with petrol and diesel association workers who have said they will join us from Monday,"" he said.The truckers are protesting high insurance premiums and scrapping of old vehicles. According to Shanmugappa, private insurance companies are hand in glove with central government agencies as well as IRDA to ensure that decisions benefit them alone. ""They do this once a year. Hike the rates and wait for the money to flow in. They earn crores through this. But we'll not give up till we get some respite,"" he said.However, the truckers' leader said they had not interfered with the supply of certain crucial commodities. ""We have not disrupted transportation of some essential commodities like milk, medicines and water because we don't want the public to suffer. However, the supply of wheat flour, corn meal, finger millet and other foodgrains has been affected,"" he said.Commenting on the strike, chief minister Siddaramaiah on Sunday said that he has directed transport minister Ramalinga Reddy to hold meetings with the truckers' association to resolve the issue soon."

(File Photo) As against the 3 lakh odd hectares which was sown for Rabi onions this year Maharashtra has seen only about 2.2 lakh hectares of onion plantation for the current year. (File Photo)As onion exports from India clocks an all time high, the central government has decided to extend the 5 per cent subsidy on the produce till end of August. This would be the second time that the central government has increased the window of the subsidy to stabilise onion prices in the last six months in the wholesale markets.With a glut in onions due to increased acreage, the central government had reduced the minimum export price (MEP) to zero in December 2015. However, as prices failed to recover last year the government had announced a 5 per cent export subsidy under the Merchandise Export from India Scheme (MEIS).Initially, the subsidy was supposed to be till March end but has been extended to August end of this year.Onion exports from India witnessed a steady rise with the year 2016 clocking the highest ever exports in the last 10 years. Total of 23,99,822.48 metric tonnes (MT) of the bulb was exported last year as against 11,14,418.13 mt of exports recorded in the year 2015. Singapore, Malaysia, UAE, Sri Lanka and Philippines have emerged as major export destinations for Indian onions. Khariff, late Khariff and now Rabi onions are going off shore.However, the steady export has not done much good to the wholesale price of onions. Prices at Lasalgaon market in Nashik district continued to hover between Rs 5-6 per kg much to the distress of the farmers.The state government had announced a special scheme to compensate for losses encountered by growers at the rate of Rs 1 per kg. In view of the low prices the crucial Rabi area has seen an alarming decrease.As against the 3 lakh odd hectares which was sown for Rabi onions this year Maharashtra has seen only about 2.2 lakh hectares of onion plantation for the current year. Rabi onion feeds the market between March to October and is the only produce which can be stored.Jagdish Apshunde, an onion exporter from Nashik wholesale market, reasoned that the glut due to bumper production of the last two years has not led to price rise. However now that people will be storing their onions, there are chances of a slight price hike in the near future, he said.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Hence, we want to try this smart and new idea of going on strike to awaken the government, which is not ready to take any farmer centric policy decision , said Yogesh Rayate, a grape farmer from Nashik district.He said he has been waiting for about a decade for the government to allow import of African grape varieties, which could reduce the production cost by half and have better acceptability in the international market.Having spent Rs 70,000 as primary expenses on a two-acre brinjal plot, Rayate has been asking anyone and everyone to take the brinjals for free as the price in the local market has dropped to just about Rs 2.5 per kg. About 40-50 villages from Nifad and Chandvad talukas have contacted me for joining the agitation, said Rayate.Farmers have demanded complete loan waiver, supply of free electricity to farms, implementation of the recommendations of the Swaminathan Committee Report, full subsidy for micro irrigation systems and a minimum price of Rs 50 per litre for milk.The Lasalgaon agriculture produce market committee, the largest in Asia for onions, had organised a meeting to take guidance from Dhanajay Jadhav from Puntamba village of Ahmednagar district, where the first resolution to go on strike was passed on April 3. Since then, the leaderless movement appears to have spread like wildfire, with about 70 villages having passed the resolution to join the strike.The agitating farmers have decided to submit their resolutions en masse to the government on May 1, when it is mandatory for all the village panchayats to organise gram sabhas. Villages in vicinity of Lasalgaon have decided to join the agitation as onion prices have fallen to about half the cost of production. Our teams will spread out from April 22 to different parts of the state to explain the demands to the villagers, said Jadhav.Farmers have decided to involve the cooperative dairies, which they claim have agreed to refuse sale of liquid milk and instead process it into various milk products from June 1."

Picture shows MPCC president Ashok Chavan at a Sangharsh Yatra rally.PTIPTIAmidst demands of farm loan waiver in Maharashtra, the State government has announced Advanced Farming  Enriched Farmer scheme, with an aim to increase farmers income by cutting production cost and increasing the output.The scheme will be launched in the upcoming kharif season. Under the initiative, the government has declared each tehsil in the State as a unit where planning will be done for agri-development. The major tasks that would be undertaken are: raising production of major crops (up to the level of its genetic yield potential), diversification of crops, introducing marketing techniques, uniting farmers through farm producers companies and making them financially stable.According to a government resolution published last week, each tehsil, under the scheme, will be given a production target for crops. The target would be planned keeping in mind that farmers, after selling their produce, receive more money than the loan they have obtained. For farmers who are already receiving more money than the loan obtained, the target is 20% more than their present production.Additionally, the government will also spend 60% of the fund available for mechanisation of farming on tractors, power tillers, transplanters, and machines for polishing, grading, and packing the produce. The grants will be deposited in farmers bank accounts linked to Aadhar.The government has also announced that it would increase grants for construction of green houses, onion shades, and shade nets, among others. A farmer outreach campaign will also be launched from May 25 to June 8, to inform farmers about the techniques to be used in agriculture ahead of the kharif season.The Opposition has been aggressively demanding farm loan waiver since the beginning of the Budget Session of the State Assembly in March. The major Opposition parties  the Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP)  are presently touring the State under Sangharsh Yatra to press for their demand.Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis has said that while his government wants to waive off the loan, a decision effecting the same will be taken only at the right time and not based on the Oppositions demands. He has also said the State government would invest more in agriculture rather than announcing a loan waiver. State Finance Minister Sudhir Mungantiwar, in his Budget speech last month, had also said that the government aims to double farmers income by 2022."

However, it has skyrocketed to Rs 68 to Rs 70 in the city in the past one week, forcing people to restrict their usage of small onion.""The cost of onion is as scorching as the summer heat. At the present price it is not affordable in a middle class family. So, I have limited the usage,"" said a house maker Y Bhuvana in Shanmuganagar.Terming as unprecedented, onion traders said they expected a further hike in prices if the drought situation remains unchanged in Tamil Nadu . Perambalur district, Namakkal, Thuraiyur in Trichy district are the major suppliers of small onion to Trichy and several other places in Tamil Nadu. Traders said that the severe drought has affected production and eventually escalated the price of the small onion.The fall in supply is visible at Gandhi Market , the wholesale vegetable market in Trichy. It currently receives only 100 tonnes of small onions daily against the 300 tonnes it used to receive two months ago.Out of the100 tonnes, 50 tonnes are brought from near Sathiyamangalam and from Tholudhur near Ulundurpettai respectively.""The price of Rs 2,000 for a 50 kg sack of onion was a good one earlier. Now, the price for the same quantity is Rs 3000. If there is no good rain, there will be no change in the price for the next two months after which it may go up even further,"" general secretary of Trichy onion traders association A Thangaraj told ToI on Saturday.He said that the major suppliers in Perambalur and Thuraiyur have been able to send negligible quantities of onion only. ""Those who stored them in the cold storage are supplying to the market,"" he said.""Rain alone can be the saviour of farmers including those cultivating onion. A heavy rain will boost the water storage and ground water level so that they can be utilised for onion irrigation which requires as much quantity of water as paddy. Otherwise, the farmers will be at stake and the price will be high,"" said an onion farmer and Perambalur district secretary of Tamilaga Vivasayigal Sangam V Neelakantan.Traders said that the supply of Bellary onion from Pune in Maharashtra has helped them meet the demand to some extent. The traders sell the onion for Rs 10 per kg to vendors who price it at Rs 15 per kg."

The construction of the Super Expressway will make the farmers lose their irrigated land in the area. Hearing the farmers grievance, MSRDC MD R Mopalwar promised to look at other alternatives to save their land.Our discussion with them has yielded a positive response. We have suggested them an alternative alignment that will go over mountains and forest land. This will not only save our land but will also save them a lot of money. With our homes and wells, the cost of our land will be much higher. There will be no loss of tree cover as there arent many trees there; it is mainly exposed rock. We are not against the construction of the highway, but we will not let them take away our irrigated land, said Kokate. The alternative alignment suggested by the farmers goes very close to the Kalsubai Harishchandragad Wildlife Sanctuary and thus declared unfeasible by MSRDC.If we are to change our route, we will be entering the buffer zone of the sanctuary and we will not get the permissions for that. Today, we are outside Kalsubai by exactly 100 metres. We instead suggested that we will make an elevated road on that stretch. This will reduce our footprints to the least possible and we will require only half the land. They have 60 wells in these lands and elevated road will protect the wells also. We will continue our discussions with them and examine what best we can do for them, said Mopalwar.Of the 21,000 hectares required to build the Mumbai-Nagpur Expressway, 399 hectares is forest land, 17,499 hectares is agricultural land and 2,922 hectares is unused land. In the 710-km stretch around eight kilometres will pass through irrigated land. The Sinnar-Igatpuri farmers will together be losing around 46 hectares of land together. On this land, farmers grow grapes, pomegranates and vegetables like onion and potatoes among other crops. Their lives and family depend on this land.The construction of this highway has wreaked havoc in our lives. We constantly live in the fear of losing our land and our familys peace is lost. It is a mental torture. Farmers have begun carrying poison in their pockets now, says Shantaram Dhokne, a grape farmer from the area. Like other farmers, they too complain of pressure from officials to surrender their land. The measurement surveys are conducted with intense police presence and on our slightest protest we are lathicharged. Cases have been filed against 42 people in our villages to prevent them from protesting, says Namdeo Arote.There are many dams in our area. Only when the water from these dams reach all the fields will there be true development and not by constructing these highways, said Kero Pawar. The Rs 30,000-crore project will pass through Nagpur, Buldhana, Amravati, Wardha, Washim, Thane, Aurangabad, Akola, Bhiwandi and Nashik districts and will cut down the travel time between Nagpur and Mumbai by half.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

The farmers at the Kurnool Agriculture Market Yard are waiting for buyers keeping their produce in heaps. Buyers are not showing any interest to lift the stocks as farmers are not coming forward for distress sale as yet.Last year, the price offered to farmers was about `13,000 but this year the price has fallen to an all-time low of `1,500 to `2,000 per quintal. The farmers are caught in a bind as they cannot resort to distress sale or they cannot take it back either as they do not know what do with the produce.R Ramakrishna Reddy, a buyer at Kurnool Market Yard said: We would have purchased chilli at a better price but the quality is very poor. He was not sure if the government would pay them subsidy later. We were taken for a ride in the past. The government announced subsidy for onion last year but till date the arrears have not been cleared.Let the government first clear the arrears. Then we will purchase chilli, he added. Farmers at their wits end G Venkateswarlu, a farmer from Remata village said that he had raised chilli in five acres by investing huge amount borrowed from money lenders.After harvesting, he had brought the crop to the market yard but there are no buyers there. He says, To some extent, what the buyers say is true. The quality of chilli we have is poor this time compared to last year as there has been drought in the district for the last three years. There is no groundwater and whatever water we could strike is alkaline and not fit for watering the crop.We are forced to throw away the crop in the garbage as we are not even recovering the money spent on transportation from the farm to the market yard in Kurnool, K Venkataramudu, a farmer from Guduru village stated. He urged the government to help them out by buying their produce or else they are forced to commit suicide.Every day, we are hearing news about farmer suicides from droughthit regions. However, with red chilli prices touching new low, farmers like me may be meeting the same fate, Venkataramudu lamented. Kurnool agriculture market yard secretary A Narayana Murthy said that they will start a special counter to purchase red chilli under subsidy price scheme.Already the government has announced the subsidy scheme and we are waiting for orders. The quality of red chilli is being sold at a minimum rate of `500 per quintal and maximum of `3,000 per quintal, at present, in wholesale market, he added. In Nellore too, problem is same.The mirchi farmers in the district are literally in tears because of the market fluctuations. Though the area of cultivation had increased when compared to the last year, green chillie farmers in upland areas are a distressed lot due to steep fall in prices.On the other hand, red chilli farmers are flooding the Guntur Mirchi Yard to sell their produce at remunerative prices. Farmers buoyed by profits in the previous year, increased area under cultivation in the district. Majority of the farmers in upland mandals such as Vinjamur, Kaligiri, Kondapuram, Jaladanki, Duttalur, Varikuntapadu, Udayagiri and Seetharamapuram had cultivated red chillie. According to sources, 1,150 farmers had cultivated green and red chilli in 3,075 hectares this year.Out of 3,075 hectares, red chilli was raised in 2,104 hectares. Out of 2,104 hectares, red chilli was raised in 329 hectares in Vinjamur, 466 in Kaligiri, 113 in Kondapuram, 84 in Jaladanki, 153 in Duttalur, 21 in Varikuntapadu, 1.2 in Seetharamapuram and 4 hectares in Seetharamapuram mandal. Green chilli growers tense Green chilli, which is chiefly used in curries, is a perishable crop by nature and the growers cannot preserve it in cold storage plants as is the case of red chilli waiting for a favourable market environment. We are issuing cultivation certificates to chilli farmers to sell their produce at remunerative prices under Market Intervention Scheme.The government is initiating steps for price stabilisation by eliminating middlemen in the process of procurement, said Anuradha, a Horticulture official. It may be mentioned here that farmers in Atmakur division had earned `3 lakh to `4 lakh profit per acre last year by selling green chilli in Maharashtra and Karnataka.The farmers invested `1.75 lakh on mirchi cultivation in one hectare this year. According to sources, farmers cultivated green chilli in around 3,200 acres in Anantasagaram, Marripadu and Atmakur mandals this year. In the previous year, green chilli was raised in 2,300 acres of land. I invested `30,000 per acre to harvest the crop. I paid a daily wage of `120 to each labourer"

If required, we will write to the Centre to procure onions from farmers through Nafed, Patro said.Politics over onion took centre-stage after BJP took up the issue with Union Agriculture Minister Radha Mohan Singh seeking his intervention.Singh had advised the State Government to take recourse to market intervention scheme (MIS) to provide remunerative prices to farmers. As implementation of the scheme needs approval of the Centre, which shares 50 per cent of the burden, the State Government has to make specific request for market intervention.Since there was no proposal from Odisha Government for market intervention to check distress sale of onion, Singh told a BJP delegation that the State may not be keen to take the financial burden to protect the farmers.Accusing the Centre of maintaining double standards, BJD spokesperson Pratap Dev told reporters that on the one hand, it said there is bumper harvest of onion while on the other, it advised the State to maintain buffer stock to meet possible crisis of the edible bulb during monsoon season.Even if distress of sale of onion in the State is true, this is not Odisha specific. Even farmers in BJP-ruled States like Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh are selling onions at much lower price, Deb added."

(Source: PTI Photo) Ahmednagar: Farmers spilling milk on the road during their state-wide strike over various demands at a village in Ahmednagar, Maharashtra on Thursday. (Source: PTI Photo)Day one of the farmers strike in Maharashtra saw supplies of fruits, vegetables and milk being hit in major cities like Mumbai and Pune. While members of Kisan Kranti, the umbrella organisation of farmers which spearheads this unique strike, maintained that theirs was an apolitical movement, Sadashiv Khot, minister of state for agriculture and marketing, said the protest was politically motivated and was being fomented by people who have failed in their political career.Farmers across Maharashtra had decided to go on strike from June 1 as repeated talks with the state government had failed to resolve the stalemate. Yogesh Rayate, state level coordinator of Kisan Kranti said complete loan waiver of the farmers and implementation of the Swaminathan Committees recommendation about fixing of agricultural produce were their main demands. As the state government failed to respond to our demands, we had no other option but to go on strike, he said. In response, farmers across the state took to stopping vehicles of fruits, vegetables and milk towards urban areas. A call was also given to farmers not to provide milks to dairies and not to sell their agricultural produce in the wholesale markets.As a result of the call, wholesale markets in Mumbai and Pune reported a sharp dip in arrival of fruits and vegetables on Thursday while markets in Nashik, Aurangabad and Ahmednagar were completely closed. Rajendra Shelke, president of the potato and onion sellers in the Vashi wholesale market in Mumbai, said there was a dip of 35 per cent in the arrival of vegetables. Dilip Khaire, chairman of the administrative board of Pune wholesale market, said there was a dip of 50 per cent in arrivals.The onion market of Lasalagon in Nashik district was completely closed as not a single farmer came to sell his produce. Vashi traders maintained that in case the supply continues to get hit, the rise in the prices of commodities could not be ruled out. Stray incidents of violence were reported from Nashik, Ahmednagar and Pune where farmers took to damaging milk-carrying tankers as well as vandalising trucks carrying vegetables. In many areas, farmers emptied milk containers and dumped vegetables on the road. Police had reportedly taken action against some protesters in Nashik, Aurangabad etc.Dairies across the state had reported a dip in procurement of milk as farmers refused to provide milk and at places stopped milk tankers. R S Sodhi, managing director of the Gujarat Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation (GCMMF)  the proprietor of Amul  said their milk procurement was hit in Maharashtra. Amul sells around 19 lakh litres of milk per day in the state and Mumbai is one of the major markets of the brand. We procure around 10 lakh litres from the state and the procurement was less today.In many places, the tankers were stopped, he said. Sodhi said while they were able to deliver milk on Thursday, if the strike continues, milk shortage could not be ruled out. Kolhapur-based Warna Cooperative Dairys milk tanker was attacked allegedly on Wednesday night near Satra, when it was transporting milk to Mumbai. B B Bhandari, general manager (transport) of the dairy, said they supply around 2.5 lakh litres of milk to Mumbai and procurement of the same was hit. We shall be transporting milk under police protection to Mumbai, but procurement has been hit, he said.An unfazed Khot said the state government will be able to ensure smooth supply of milk and vegetables to the urban areas. The people who are behind this strike are failed politicians who do not want the farmers to prosper, he said. Khot said the government was ready to talk and the on-going strike was not the solution. Rayate and other Kisan Kranti members, however, refuted Khots charges.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Narendra Vaskar Navi Mumbai was among a handful of APMCs where the strike had little impact on Thursday. Narendra VaskarMAJOR Agricultural Produce Market Committees (APMCs) shut operations on Thursday after farmers decided to stop supplying their produce as a mark of protest against the government for not acceding to their demand for a crop loan waiver. On the first day of the strike, there were reports of farmers turning violent and clashing with police while trying to stop vegetable-laden vehicles from entering local markets.In Yeola, Nashik district, the state police launched tear gas and fired rubber bullets to disperse a stone-pelting mob. One person and five policemen were injured.The incident took place near Jalal toll booth where protesting farmers reportedly stopped over 100 vehicles carrying vegetables and threw the produce on the road.The mob allegedly first burned down a vehicle over rumours that it was carrying beef. After that, the protesters started searching each vehicle that passed through the stretch and threw items found in those on the road. Some of the protesters also looted vehicles that were carrying oil and ghee, after which the State Reserve Police Force was called in. The mob then pelted the police with stones and five policemen were injured.The police used tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse the mob. One youth, 35-year-old Yashwant Jadhav, was injured in police action and five of our men were injured due to stone-pelting by the locals, Nashik S P Ankush Shinde said.Incidents of violence also took place in areas like Niphad in Nashik district and Kopargaon, in Ahmednagar district. In several other incidents across Maharashtra, farmers blocked roads and vandalised vehicles ferrying vegetables.In places like Satara and Shirdi, farmers demanding a Minimum Support Price of Rs 50 per litre of milk threw milk on the streets as a mark of protest.The state-wide protest, however, did not have an immediate impact on major cities like Mumbai, where major APMCs like Vashi operated as usual. But local traders said that the situation is likely to deteriorate from tomorrow as the intensity of the protest increases.We received close to 550-600 vegetable-laden vehicles in the market on Thursday that is close to the normal inflow of produce. However, we are apprehending that things will go bad from Friday as the agitation picks up. The market usually remains closed on Sundays and the city may end up feeling the pinch of the strike from the beginning of the new week, Ashok Shinde, a trader at the Vashi APMC, said.Vegetable vendors at Borivali and Ville Parle (East) markets are worried fearing a rise in supply prices from Friday. Although the supply prices have not increased yet, we apprehend the trouble to start tomorrow with a shortage in supply and rise in prices of vegetables, said Ashok Kumar, a vendor at Borivali market.The Vile Parle (East) market seemed more affected, with supply prices already having increased by Rs 10-15 on Thursday, according to vegetable vendor Ram Vinay. Although the prices have not increased, less vegetables were supplied to us.On Friday, the supply will be even less, said Ghanshyam Kandu, another vendor.In Nashik district, all 12 APMCs remained empty with farmers refraining from bringing their produce to the market. Nashik supplies a bulk of the fresh vegetables that come to Mumbai. The total turnover of these 12 APMCs is around Rs 23 crore per day, which came to a grinding halt. The APMC remained open but hardly any farmer came in with their produce, said Vilas Shinde, a trader from Nashik APMC.In Ahmednagar district, there were reports of milk and vegetables being thrown on the streets by farmers. In Pune APMC, too, supply of vegetables was affected. We generally get 1,100 vehicles in the market every day. On Thursday, we received only 725. The number will go down. Prices shot up by 10-20 per cent in the market and it will go on if the condition prevails, Vilas Bhujbal, a trader in Pune APMC, said.Farmers have stopped sending their produce to markets across the state as part of a protest to seek loan waiver from the state government.Some of the major demands of the farmers are that the state should clear the 7/12 extracts that are property documents of farmers from all liabilities.The farmers are seeking interest-free loans, a pension scheme for farmers over 60 years, uninterrupted power supply and a minimum support price of Rs 50 per litre of milk.Nearly 99 per cent of the farmers from our village did not send their produce to the markets. This is a do-or-die situation for us. We do not get proper price for our produce. We have a situation where onion gets sold at Rs 2 per kg. How can the farmers afford to sell at this price? Going on strike hurts us financially but we hope that this temporary hardship will provide us long term relief, Zakir Mulani, a farmer from Akluj in Solapur district, said.As tonnes of perishable goods like vegetables and milk were on the line, some farmers found ingenious ways of preserving their produce to use them once the strike ends. Some farmers in Ahmednagar turned their milk into khoya and basundi for future use. Big land owners in Nashik district opened up their cold storage units for stocking up the produce of local farmers.Although there was solidarity amongst the farmers and traders, instances of protesting farmers been beaten up by the public were reported.In Aurangabad, APMC farmers who were trying to implement the strike were assaulted by local traders opposed to the move. Around 20 per cent farmers did not take part in the strike and brought their produce to the market. We were requesting them not to do so when we were assaulted by local traders, Jayaji Suryavanshi, an activist from Aurangabad said.For all the latest Mumbai News, download Indian Express App"

Maharashtra Farmers' Protest Explained",http://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/why-are-milk-vans-onion-trucks-being-emptied-on-roads-maharashtra-farmers-protest-explained/story-jBn2fivHIlWPunCw513lYO.html,2017-06-01,"Spilling milk, emptying onion trucks  this is the first time farmers from Maharashtra are seen in an aggressive avatar.THE DEMANDDistressed over falling prices of agricultural produce and other issues, farmers have demanded a loan waiver.During 2016-17, banks had disbursed farm loan worth Rs 40,000 crore to the states 13.7 million farmers. The loan disbursement has been 80% of the overall agriculture credit target which was set at Rs 51,000 crore for the fiscal.Bank of Maharashtra, the largest public sector lender in the state, has seen sharp rise in its NPA from 9.55% in 2015-16 to 13.26% in 2016-17. Part of the reason, bankers say, was also demonetisation when recovery almost came to a halt.As the UP government waived farm loan worth Rs36,369 crore, Maharashtra has been under pressure to do something similar.Chief minister Devendra Fadnavis earlier said the cost of extending the loan waiver to 31 lakh farmers is Rs30,500 crore and if the government decided to bear it, that would mean depriving other sections of society from their social schemes.The CM said rather than giving loan waivers, the state will focus on sustainable growth of agriculture. Due to impressive agricultural growth  12.5% this year from the negative growth rate last year  the collective income of farmers grew by Rs 40,000 crore.When asked to scrap infrastructure projects to avail funds to waive the farm loan, the CM had said the international funding agencies fund the infrastructure projects, but there was no provision of funding the loan waiver to the farmers.POLITICAL PRESSURE FROM ALLIESShiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray recently gave a veiled threat of pulling out of the government if his demand to waive off farmers loan is not accepted. Addressing the farmers, Thackeray said his party would give unconditional support to the government if it grants a farm loan waiver. Give a loan waiver and all the Sena ministers will vacate their seats and will give unconditional outside support. If the waiver is announced, we will ensure the government completes its full term, Thackeray said.NDA ally Swabhimani Paksha, headed by farmers leader Raju Shetti, will go no holds barred against Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government over loan waiver for distressed farmers. Accusing the government of deceiving farmers, Shetti said he was repenting his decision of supporting the government, which had adopted a Mar Jawaan, Mar Kisaan (Die Youth, Die Farmer) policy. The farmers who elected this government will eliminate it. The jawans being martyred at the border are from farmer families and in villages, farmers are killing themselves. The government is following a Mar Jawaan, Mar Kisaan policy, he said, adding farmers are against the Mumbai-Nagpur expressway for which their land will be acquired.FARMERS STRATEGYWhile farmers want a loan waiver, the state government has sought time for deliberation. The strike is the farmers way of creating shortage of milk and vegetable supplies to putting pressure on the government to give in to their demands."

As many as 42 cases of looting and violence were registered against the protesters. A group of over 500 stopped a truck carrying onions near Kotru phata at Niphad tehsil on the Nashik-Aurangabad highway on Friday morning and emptied half of the consignment on the road. Milk cans were being spilled on many highways. The local police and the quick response team (QRT) commandos were forced to conduct a lathi charge, following which the farmers dispersed and the road was cleared for the vehicles. Reports have also emerged of instances of violence resulting in the imposition of section 144 in Nashik.Among the cities where APMCs have been forced to shut as farmers continue their strike are Pune, Nashik, Mumbai and Thane. Lasalgaon APMC, which is the largest onion supplier in the country has been shut for the last two days. Over 25,000 quintals of onions had arrived in the market yard on May 31.Because there was no transaction in the Lasalgaon market yard on Thursday and Friday , not a single truck of onion was received by the Mumbai APMC.The data provided by Ma harashtra State Market Committee Cooperative Federation (MSMCCF) showed that markets were closed largely in Nashik, Pune and Latur divisions with full support from farmers. President of MSMCCF Dilip Mohite told TOI that the arrivals were just 10-15 per cent and there was a 90 per cent shortage overall. ""The overall shortfall will increase further as the strike intensifies,'said Mohite.

Sandeep Gidde (34), an MBA, is a Sangli farmer who also works as an event manager hosting agri-exhibitions. And 47-year old Dhananjay Dhorde has a Bachelor's degree and owns a 15-acre farm in Aurangabad.Younger, educated farmers like them form the backbone of Kisan Kranti, the group spearheading the strike which has crippled vegetable and milk supply chains across large parts of the state. The apolitical, leaderless agitation has drawn support from 37 smaller groups. But its core members are between 30 and 50 years old. Few have participated in previous agitations even though they come from farming families.""Our fathers did `rasta-rokos' and hunger strikes but it led nowhere. So we decided to do something different. If you don't pinch the nose, the mouth won't open,"" says Rayate. Significantly , the Opposition's `Sangharsh Yatra' just two months ago created barely a ripple.Besides small meetings, the use of social media including Whatsaspp and Facebook helped the movement reach out to other groups, guided by Gidde's event management skills. ""I knew how to reach out to large groups of people effectively and what posts could go viral,"" he says.What drew the Kisan Kranti together was the devastating crash in prices of key crops like onions, tomatoes and tur dal over the last year. The issue touched a chord among farmers across districts.The price crash had pushed even prosperous farmers like Rayate deeper into debt. ""Grapes which cost Rs 25 per kilo to grow, fetch a price of Rs 10. Last month brinjals were selling at Rs 25 for 20 kg. It cost more to transport them to the mandi,"" he said.The final catalyst was a gram sabha meeting in Ahmednagar's Puntamba village in April where villagers initially considered boycotting sowing. Later they decided to boycott agricultural markets instead. ""They realized its only when urban food markets are affected that there will be pressure on the government,"" says G Patil, an agro-markets expert who is part of Kisan Kranti.The movement spread to the onion belt of Nashik and the milk producing regions of western Maharashtra including Sangli, Satara and Solapur. Marathwada's districts, mainly Aurangabad, also joined.The discontent among farmers in the north Maharashtra belt had escalated with the state's decontrol of agricultural markets last year, says Patil. ""Traders called a strike for a monthand-a-half and onion prices crashed to 5 paise,"" says Patil. Later, the glut in the onion, tomato and tur crop kept prices low. Farmers ended up dumping their tomato and onion crop. By November, demonetisation added to the crisis.Activists recall a similar agitation led by farmer leader Sharad Joshi in 1982 but this one has created greater impact. ""The idea spread so fast because its time has come,"" says Patil. ""The new generation of farmers are more aware.They understand issues like import subsidies and the fact that crops are sometimes imported at a higher price than domestic rates.""Kisan Kranti has also drawn professionals including lawyers and social workers, whom they rely on for advice.""We have drawn up committees for different tasks: legal advice, meetings with the government, administration and publicity ,"" says Gidde."

The vegetable and onion auctions at all district APMCs could not take place on Thursday and Friday because of the ongoing stir.Vendors had procured vegetables from farmers a day before the strike and sold it the next day on Thursday, at higher rates. However, there was no auction in the district APMCs because of which most of the vegetable markets ran dry. Some vendors sold vegetables, but they had a few varieties with limited quantity.""Nashik APMC is the major location, where vegetables are auctioned in the district. Of the total auction, around 5% or 30 tonne of vegetables are supplied to the city. But, there has been no auction of vegetables in the first two days of the strike,"" Arun Kale, secretary of the Nashik APMC said.Punam Belgaonkar, an employee at a private firm, said, ""On Thursday, I went to buy vegetables, but there were only a few vendors selling only a few vegetables. The stock was not fresh and I bought it at double the normal price.""Another citizen, Gorakh Pagar said he had stocked up on vegetables as he was aware of the strike.

Dhananjay Jadhav, Dhananjay Dhorde, Sandeep Gidde, Kamal Sawant and Shantaram Kunjir formed the core committee of Kisan Kranti who were empowered to talk with the state government on behalf of the farmers.Since the last few months, villages across Maharashtra had seen Gram Sabhas passing resolutions to participate in the strike which would also translate into farmers refraining from agriculture. The movement had also called for a Maharashtra wide bandh barring Mumbai on Monday. Due to the strike, prices of vegetables spiralled and milk procurement has been hit.R S Sodhi, managing director of the Gujarat Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation (GCCMMF) which markets dairy and dairy products under the brand Amul, said procurement in Maharashtra has been severely hit.Milk carrying vehicles to Mumbai are being transported under police protection from Gujarat. As the strike entered its second day, the core committee had left for Mumbai late Friday night to meet the chief minister. After a marathon meeting, Fadnavis along with the core committee members except Dhorde had called off the strike early on Saturday morning. Gidde who spoke to The Indian Express early on Saturday morning said around 70 per cent of their demands including loan waivers to marginal farmers, passing of a legislation to penalise traders trading under Minimum Support Price (MSP) were agreed upon by the government. In view of this, we decided to the call off the strike, he said.However, the decision did not go down well with farmers who claimed they were not consulted by the core committee before taking the decision. As the day progressed, the core committee members started becoming the target of attack by farmers at various districts who were clearly not happy with the decision. By evening, committees in various districts announced that the strike would continue with farmers in Nashik, Ahmednagar, Western Maharashtra, Vidarbha joining in. As the anger among farmers spread, the core committee members came under increasing fire and soon all of them were unreachable for comments.Minister of State for Agriculture Sadabhau Khot, who has been the governments face for negotiation, came under severe criticism with farmers burning his effigy in Nashik. Reports have also come in of lathicharge on farmers in parts of Nashik and Ahmednagar.Amruta Pawar, member of the state committee, said the core committee had erred in taking the decision without consulting anyone. Pawar, who hails from Nashik, said that the protesting farmers in Puntambe had decided to oust the core committee and continue with the strike. In Nashik we decided to continue the strike, she said.Pawar said they had contacted leaders of organisations that have supported the strike in Nashik on Sunday to discuss the course of action. This is going to be an open air meeting so everyone can see what is happening, she said.Meanwhile, on Saturday, Swabhimani Paksha MP Raju Shetti and farmer leader Raghunath Patil who have considerable clout in Western Maharashtra announced the continuation of the strike. Shetti and Patil have decided to call a meeting on June 8 to discuss the matter.The apparent leaderless farmers strike has come at the back of the Maratha Morcha which saw lakhs thronging the streets. Puntambe, which is in the heart of onion and grapes belt, is just about two hours from Satana where the farmer leader Sharad Joshi had started his public movement for better onion prices.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Deepak Joshi At the APMC market in Kalyan on Saturday. Deepak JoshiThere has been a split in the ranks of farmers over the decision to withdraw their agitation after a meeting with Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis late on Friday night.A large chunk of farmers criticised the delegation which met the CM and claimed that the strike will continue. The backlash against leaders who were part of the delegation which announced the withdrawal of the strike has been so strong that many of them were forced to make a clarification that the strike has not been called off yet.If farmers think I have made a mistake, then I seek forgiveness from them. If they feel that the strike should continue then I am with them, said Jayaji Suryavanshi, member of the Kisan Kranti Morcha.Suryavanshi seemed to have drawn the maximum ire from farmers who burned his effigies. Visuals of the chief minister speaking into his ears during the marathon four-hour meeting on Friday created a perception that he had struck a deal with the government.This is a decision taken by children of farmers and not by politicians. We have told the state government that if it does not stay true to its promise in the next four months, we will not allow the government to function, Suryavanshi had said soon after the core committee meeting with the CM in which the withdrawal had been announced. However, the backlash the decision received seems to have made many leaders including Suryavanshi rethink their position.Many local farmers were unhappy that the committee decided to take a decision without taking into confidence farmers from across the state.The committee should have heard what the government had to say and then come back and shared the details with farmers. They, however, announced the withdrawal of the strike without any concrete assurances from the state or taking people into confidence. For us they are not a core committee but a chor (thieves) committee and we will continue with the agitation, Bhausaheb Shinde, a farmer from Puntamba in Ahmednagar district, which had become the epicentre of the agitation, said.The Maharashtra Kisan Sabha has also criticised the decision to end the strike.The CM has spun a web around farmers. He has not given any clear assurance. If others want, they can withdraw from the agitation but the Maharashtra Kisan Sabha will continue with its agitation till we receive loan waiver for farmers, said a leader of the Maharashtra Kisan Sabha.Ajit Navale, general secretary of the Kisan Sabha, said, The chief minister did not give a clear answer to any of our demands. The new October 31 deadline that has been declared is a farce the 4-person committee will only announce its findings that day. No concrete decision regarding the waiver of loans or implementation of the Swaminathan report has been taken.Fadnavis has said that the commission shall look into waiving of loans of farmers who have smaller lands. What about Vidarbha or Marathwada, where most farmers have 10 to 15 acres of land, said Navale.The Baliraja Shetkari Sanghatna also criticised the withdrawal and claimed that the government was attempting to create a rift between farmers.I was first invited to a meeting with the CM but was detained by the Pune rural police at Dehu Road police station. I was allowed to go only after the announcement of the strike being called off. This is an attempt to create a rift between farmers, Sanjay Patil Ghanekar, leader of the Baliraja Shetkari Sanghatna, said.Meanwhile, farmers in Nashik held a meeting on Saturday and decided to continue with their agitation including a state-wide bandh on June 5. The farmers meeting also heckled senior BJP leaders including Dindori MP Harishchandra Chavan and BJP MLAs from Nashik Balasaheb Sanap and Devyani Pharande when they tried to attend the meeting, forcing them to leave.In spite of the strike being called off, protests continued in areas like Dindori where women farmers blocked traffic on Kalwan Dindori road. In Saigaon near Yeola in Nashik district, onion and milk were thrown on the road. Similar agitations took place in Jalgaon and Parbhani as well.The decision to call off the strike seems to have had no impact on prices of vegetables which have kept on shooting up in cities like Mumbai.

Only then will we get a clear picture on when prices can stabilise, Naresh Kor, a trader from Vashi APMC said.Lok Sabha MP Raju Shetti said the people who negotiated with the government were novices and he would hold a meeting of all farmer leaders and groups in Nashik next week to chart out the course of action. The Shiv Sena also criticised the state government and claimed that the state, rather than trying to find a solution, had tried to create a rift between farmers.Rather than trying to sort out the problem, the government seems to have tried to create a rift between farmers. They are just prolonging taking a decision. This is nothing but running away from the problem.

APMC markets were open, but not a single farmer went with his produce.Nashik, called the kitchen of Mumbai as nearly 40% of essentials to the city are supplied from there, has made heavy losses, as all APMC markets in the district, including Lasalgaon, the largest onion supplier in the country , remained idle for the last five days.""On an average Lasalgaon alone carries out transactions worth Rs 2.5 crore every day and other APMC markets in Nashik carry out business worth Rs 15-20 crore each day ,"" said an APMC chairman.

However, state government officials said the losses would not be so high. After the government decided to delist vegetables and fruits from the APMC Act, the officials said, not many are coming to the markets but are getting sold directly in open market."

Sources said that senior ministers discussed the issue of farmers agitations in MP and Maharashtra. The BJP chief Amit Shah was also learnt to have spoken to the MP chief minister over phone.Concerns in the government and the party appear to be more for the reason that the farmers agitation has come at a time when the NDA is in the midst of a campaign to drum up support for achievements of three years of the Modi government. Incidentally, MP along with Rajsthan and Chattisgarh will to the Assembly elections in the later parts of the next year.The MP government had already accepted most of the demands of farmers on June 4. Farmers in the state have never resorted to violence. There are reports that criminal gangs and anti-social elements got involved in the agitation with the support of local Congress leader. What we are witnessing in parts of the state is nothing but the criminal-political motive of the Congress getting exposed, said BJP leader GVL Narsimha Rao.With the Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi heading to Mandsaur on Thursday, a long drawn political slugfest over the status of farmers in the state seems to be on the card. Incidentally, officials in the Central government had been noting for a while that the farmers were not able to sell the crops of pulses at the Minimum Support Price (MSP), besides the bumper onion crop having led the cultivators to resort to distress sale.But BJP leaders cannot agree that the situations of farmers are distressing. MP has been registering 20 per cent plus agricultural growth, while the state has emerged as number two in wheat productions. The state has also been the best performer in spreading irrigation facilities. The state government had ensured farm loan at one per cent interest, added Rao."

Farmers are demanding loan waivers and remunerative prices for all crops, many of them encouraged by Uttar Pradeshs decision to write off loans given to small farmers. The governments of Maharashtra and Punjab, where the protests are spreading, have rightly resisted because loan waivers only offer relief that is usually exhausted in two farming seasons.The cardinal malaise lies in successive governments treating agriculture as a source of votes and not an engine of growth. That kept the rural-urban wage gap wide at 45%, almost four times that of China, and shrunk the share of farming in GDP to under 14%, although more than half of Indias 1.25 billion people still depend on it.To be sure, India is reforming parts of its economy. But not farming. If farmers are to escape poverty, farming needs to become more like manufacturing: Teched up operations, free as far as possible from imponderables, churning out quality produce that fetch the right price.For this, things need to change. The old, labour-intensive methods must give way to technology for efficiency and higher yield; Pricing and subsidy mechanism must be overhauled; and, most importantly, India must look at fewer people farming.For far too long, farming has been at the mercy of nature, especially the June-September monsoon rain. The use of technology is patchy, and only one-tenth of every rupee the government spends on rural areas goes to improving productivity  which is why farmers in India grow 46% less rice an acre than their Chinese counterparts.Our farm subsidy policy encourages the production of only low-value staples, such as rice and wheat, and the output of fruits and vegetables  that more Indians are eating and farmers producing  is not covered by the governments minimum support price. Much of the farm distress sweeping India now stemmed from a glut of potatoes, onion and tomatoes.Worse, the monopoly of traders over local agricultural markets is perpetuated by law, which bars farmers from selling directly to consumers. This kills any chance of farmers getting a fair price, lining the pockets of commission agents instead.In the past, a single season of dry spell was enough to send the economy into recession. Now failed monsoons trigger localised distress. Thats an improvement. Still, far too many farm households remain too poor. And unless the rural economy is unshackled from a time and policy warp, our dream of double-digit economic growth will remain just that: A dream."

The party has not taken any such decision. But any spontaneous reaction from the public cannot be ruled out, said BJD spokesperson Pratap Keshari Deb.While the BJP is tom-tomming its achievement in farm sector, two of the BJP-ruled States, including Maharashtra, are facing serious agitation from farmers which speaks volumes, Deb said, making a veiled attack on the BJP.The BJP is making wild allegations against our Government over distress sale of onion. Why is distress sale of onion there in Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh? Deb wondered.The agriculture sector is still limping with just 1.7 per cent average annual growth during the last three years of Modi Government and most of the farmers are struggling for survival.The 1.7 per cent agricultural growth in the last three years (2014-2017) of the NDA Government is much lower than the 3.6 per cent in the last three years of Manmohan Singh Government, Deb said.Besides, the BJP owes an explanation to the people about the Prime Ministers promise to double the income of farmers which is still a distant dream, he added."

A strong critic of Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje after the BJP served him notices for anti-party activities, Tiwari said as a well-wisher of the state government, he has warned the leadership that the situation can turn ugly any day.Farmers in Rajasthan are the worst affected in the country. Nearly 22 per cent farmers have left farming. They are forced to sell onion at Rs 2 per kg, garlic at Rs 5 per kg and mustard at Rs 500, less than the MSP, Tiwari said. There are water issues and farmers are protesting everyday, he claimed.The senior leader also opposed the Rajasthan Special Investment Region (SIR) Bill, 2016. The Bill is a conspiracy to acquire lands of peasants to let corporates flourish. I had opposed it in the assembly for 50 minutes, but it was still passed, he said.He said the SIR notification will allow the state government to acquire land in any part of the state to announce it as a special investment region. Whether it is pasture land, khatedari land of a farmer or residential scheme in any village or town, it can be acquired through SIR. To facilitate corporate house, large chunks of land can be acquired in Alwar, Neemrana and Bhiwadi, he said.He accused the government of strangulating farmers for industries through SIR.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"
593c72507be9e00ed19a35ba,Why a bountiful harvest drove farmers to despair and anger,http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/why-a-bountiful-harvest-drove-farmers-to-despair-and-anger/story-Z4Tv0RSb49s9ANWv2OIP7L.html,2017-06-08,"A plentiful harvest in 2016 and imports drive some prices down 63%. A shortage of cash because of demonetisation. Despite Rs 3.5 lakh crore  enough to build 545 Tehri-sized dams  invested over six decades to 2011, more than half of all farms depend on rains. These are the three factors agitating Indians who depend on farming  90 million families, or 54.6% of Indias 1.2 billion people.As anger sweeps rural Madhya Pradesh after the death of six farmers in police firing, farm protests roil rural Maharashtra -- wholesale markets are shut, produce is being dumped on streets -- and governments of the debt-ridden states struggle to respond to demands for loan waivers, an IndiaSpend analysis and reportage from rural Maharashtra explores why farmers are both angry and desperate.The primary reason farming is unviable in India is that farms are now among the worlds smallest (the global average land-holding size is 5.5 hectares)  too many people are dependent on shrinking farms.Since 1951, the per capita availability of land has declined by 70%, from 0.5 hectares to 0.15 hectares in 2011, and is likely to decline further, according to ministry of agriculture data.Such small and marginal land-holdings, as they are called, now constitute 85% of the number of operational farms in the country, according this 2015-16 report on the state of Indian agriculture.It is hard to use modern machinery on small farms, the owners of which are often too poor to afford farm equipment. Manual labour increases costs, but labour too has been in short supply, as workers migrate to cities. Further, their size and output limits access to loans and institutional credit.Those are the larger issues. Here are the three reasons for the current turmoil, gleaned by IndiaSpends analysts and reporters:1. After back-to-back droughts, a good harvest, but incomes fallAs 2017 rolled in, the news from Indias farms appeared good.After droughts in 2014 and 2015, a good monsoon in 2016 reversed two years of rural economic decline. Indias agricultural growth contracted 0.2% in 2014-15 and grew no more than 1.2% in 2015-16, because of the back-to-back droughts. In 2016-17, the agricultural economy grew 4.1%.Across many states growing pulses, such as Maharashtra, Karnataka, Telangana and Gujarat, markets were flooded with produce, especially tur (pigeon pea), which witnessed the highest growth among all pulses, an important source of protein for a majority of Indians. India is the worlds largest pulses producer.However, an influx of pulses from Myanmar, Tanzania, Mozambique and Malawigrowing 20% over two financial quarters, from September 2016 to March 2017, the Business Standard reported on March 3, 2017caused the price of Indian tur to plunge.From Rs 11,000 per quintal (from December 2015), the price of tur fell 63% to Rs 3,800-4,000 per quintal  20% below the minimum support price (MSP)the price at which government buys farm produceof Rs 5,050 per quintal (including a bonus of Rs 425) since December 2016 as Indiaspend reported on April 12, 2017.The table above explains how production of pulses rose 29%, from 17.15 million tonnes in 2014-15 to 22.14 million tonnes in 2016-17. Tur production increased 50%, from 2.81 million tonnes to 4.23 million tonnes, over the same period.The MSP for tur should be increased to Rs 6,000 per quintal in 2017 and Rs 7,000 per quintal in 2018, a government committee headed by chief economic adviser Arvind Subramanian recommended in September 2016.As on March 2017, the minimum support price for tur was Rs 5,050 per quintal, nearly 20% (18%) lower than the prices recommended by the committee on pulses.As these prices crashed, farmers found it harder to find money to store their produce and prepare for the next season because demonetisationthe withdrawal of 86% of Indias currency, by value, on November 2016 left them starved of cash.2. How demonetisation  and government red tape  left farmers short of cashOn May 18, at around noon, 30-year-old Prashant Lande waited under a harsh summer sun to sell 800 quintals of tur at the Amravati agricultural produce market committee (APMC), 664 km east of Indias financial capital, Mumbai.From Kinhala village in Amravati districts Ashti taluka, in Maharashtras eastern region of Vidharbha, Lande said he refuses to sell his 800 quintals of tur to the government procurement centre, although the state buys tur at a higher rate.At the market, Lande could sell his tur at Rs 3,800 to Rs 4,000 per quintal, while the government buying centre offered Rs 5,050 per quintal.We dont sell to the government centre because the process of selling takes one month  from standing in line for the token to the sale to finally when the payment reaches the account, said Lande. Our fellow farmers who have sold their produce at the procurement centre on March 22, are yet to receive their payments and it is nearly June!It does not help that the effects of demonetisation continue to to be felt across the rural economy.Right after demonetisation, tomato farmers in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, and onion farmers in Maharashtra and Gujarat, were the worst hit as prices fell by 60-85%, IndiaSpend reported on January 18, 2017.With little respite more than six months later, the experiment has aggravated the circumstances leading to the current farmers strike.By now we should have begun preparing our fields for the monsoons, but because of demonetisation and the unavailability of cash, we are still struggling to find money for sowing, said Lande.At such a time, farmers like Lande turn to credit.Up to 57% of farm families in Maharashtra are indebted; the figure for India is 52%, according to the National Sample Survey Organisations 2013 situation assessment survey of farm households, the latest available data.This indebtedness has widespread consequences. More farmers committed suicide in Maharashtra (4,291) in 2015 than any other state, rising 7% from 4,004 in 2014, followed by Karnataka (1,569) and Telangana (1,400), as IndiaSpend previously reported in January 2017.Now, after Uttar Pradeshs new government waived Rs 30,792 crore of farm loans, pressure is building on the governments of Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka to do the same. Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis has been reluctant to do so, but with his governments coalition partner, the Shiv Sena, and other parties preparing for a political agitation, he may find it hard to exercise fiscal prudence.3. In an era of climate change, 52% of Indian farmers without irrigationThe basic problem across most of rural India is that despite the spread of irrigationa sector plagued by unfinished projects and corruption52% of Indias farms still depend on the vagaries of rain, which is becoming increasingly uncertain in an era of climate change.Extreme rainfall events in central India, the core of the monsoon system, are increasing and moderate rainfall is decreasing  as a part of complex changes in local and world weather  according to a clutch of Indian and global studies, as IndiaSpend reported on April 15, 2015.The droughts of 2014 and 2015 in rural Maharashtra were mitigated by the plentiful rains of 2016, but many parts of the state also endured floods. Uncertain weather affects the ability of government extension systems to provide accurate advice to farmers.The government encouraged us to grow more tur in the kharif (July to October) season, since these crops consume less water and are in high demand, said Lande, the Vidarbha farmer. We would not have faced so much loss over the last three years, had there been a proper system of canals.Despite six decades of irrigation, less than 50% (or 66 million hectares of Indias net-cultivated area of 140 million hectares) as irrigated, according to the 2015-16 State of Agriculture report. Groundwater provides water for two-thirds of Indias irrigated land, but those levels are falling from overuse.From the first five year plan (1951-56) to the eleventh (2006 to 2011), the central government has spent a total of Rs 3.51 lakh crore, as we said, on major irrigation and flood control projects characterised by time and cost overruns, shows this 12th Five Year Plan (2012-2017) report.On July 1, 2015, Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY)or the Prime Ministers Farmers Irrigation Programmewith a budget of Rs. 50,000 crores over five years (2015-16 to 2019). The motto of the PMKSY is Har Khet Ko Pani (water to every field) and More crop per drop.In 2015-16, less than a third (Rs 312 crore) of Rs 1,000 crores set aside for micro-irrigation was released, reveals this government report. Of this, upto April 2016, no more than Rs 48.3 crore, or less than 5%, was actually spent, according this micro-irrigation financial progress monitoring report. The government set Rs 1,763 as the 2016-17 micro-irrigation target, but no data on results have been released.The micro-irrigation programme covers an area of 6,51,220 hectares, or 0.46% of net cultivated area.(Salve is an analyst with IndiaSpend.

Long queues were also seen outside petrol pumps.However, the agitation reached the doorsteps of Bhopal as incidents of arson and stone-pelting were witnessed in Fanda area, about 20 kms from the state capital.Police baton-charged the protesters and arrested at least 27 of them in the area.""Some unidentified persons set a truck on fire near a spot where Congress workers were protesting. Then some men hurled stones at the policemen present there,"" Deputy Inspector General of Police (DIG) Raman Singh Sikarwar told PTI.The SP said the police will not let their guard down and strict action will be taken against those who try to violate prohibitory orders under CrPC 144 which bans assembly of more than four persons. Special permission will be required for weddings or other functions .At least 156 people have been arrested and 40 cases registered in connection with violence during the farmers agitation here.The SP said police is trying to identify the culprits by going through the video clips of the incidents of violence.The Centre had rushed 1,100 personnel of the RAF to the violence-hit state.Two companies of the RAF, each comprising 100 personnel, were deployed in Pipliamandi in Mandsaur, where five farmers were killed in police firing on Tuesday. Two RAF companies were deployed along the highway. Contingents of the CRPF have also been deployed.In Bhopal, a visibly-upset chief minister told a hurriedly-convened press conference this evening that ensuring people's safety was his 'Rajdharma' and that he was not flint-hearted.He said the agitation has gone ""anarchic"" and appealed to the farmers to come to the negotiating table.""I will sit on indefinite fast from 11 am tomorrow at Dussehra Maidan for restoration of peace,"" he said on Friday.""I will be available at the Dussehra Maidan. I welcome all farmers to come there for resolving the impasse peacefully through an amicable dialogue with me. I won't sit in my office at Mantralaya (secretariat)...(but sit at) Dussehra Maiden and do all work from there,"" he added.Chouhan said anyone trying to ignite the flames of violence would not be spared.""I am deeply saddened that stones are being placed in the hands of young people aged 18, 21 and 22 by some persons during attempts to stage road blockades. It is painful that these young people are our own and the elements leading them are also our own,"" he said.Chouhan, who has been the chief minister for the last 11 -and-a-half years, said that whenever farmers were in distress due to loss of crops following a natural calamity, he had rushed to them and comforted and helped them.The state government has started buying onion for Rs 8 per kg from the farmers, while Moong and Urad pulses too will be bought at Minimum Support Price (MSP), the CM said.A commission will be set up to work out the cost of production of farm produce and a Rs 1,000 crore fund will be created to help farmers when prices crash, the CM reiterated."
5a0439229855b76bf13bcf9d,Why a problem of plenty is hurting farmers,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/616449/why-problem-plenty-hurting-farmers.html,2017-06-09,"Soutik Biswas, International New York Times, Jun 10 2017, 0:07 ISTFarmers are on the boil again in India. In Maharashtra, they have been on strike for a week in some seven districts now, spilling milk on the streets, shutting down markets, protesting on the roads and attacking vegetable trucks. In neighbouring Madhya Pradesh, curfew has been imposed after five farmers were killed in clashes with the police on Tuesday. Last month, farmers in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh staged protests and burnt their red chilli crop.The farmers are demanding waivers on farm loans and higher prices for their crops. For decades now, farming in India has been blighted by drought, small plot sizes, a depleting water table, declining productivity and lack of modernisation.Half of its people work in farms, but farming contributes only 15% to the countrys GDP. Put simply, farms employ a lot of people but produce too little. Crop failures trigger farm suicides with alarming frequency. The present unrest is, however, rooted in a problem of plenty. In Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh, the farmers are on the streets because a bumper harvest fuelled by a robust monsoon has led to a crop glut. Prices of onions, grapes, soya-bean, fenugreek and red chilli, for example, have nosedived.In most places, the governments have been less than swift in paying the farmer more for the crops  the government sets prices for farming and procures crops from farmers to incentivise production and ensure income support. So why has a bumper crop led to a crisis in farming? Some believe that the price crash is the result of Indias controversial withdrawal of high-value notes  popularly called demonetisation  late last year.The ban, surprisingly, did not hurt planting as farmers begged and borrowed from their kin and social networks to pay for fertilisers, pesticides and labour, Harish Damodaran, rural affairs and agriculture editor at The Indian Express newspaper told me.So more land was actually cropped, and bountiful rains led to a bumper crop. But traders, Damodaran believes, possibly did not have enough cash to pick up the surplus crop.Although the chronic cash shortage has passed, there is still a liquidity problem. I have been talking to traders who say theres not enough cash, which remains the main medium of credit in villages. I suspect the price crash has been caused by a lack of cash.A prominent trader in Lasangaon, Asias biggest onion market, in Maharashtra, a state which accounts for a third of Indias annual production, told me that concerns over shortage of cash leading to crop price crashes were exaggerated. There has been a good crop for sure, but a lot of traders have picked up crop, paying cash, issuing cheques and using net banking. Some of the glut and wastage has been due to the ongoing strike, when trucks of vegetables have been attacked on the highways, Manoj Kumar Jain said.Still others believe the main reason for the ongoing crisis is actually rooted in Indias chronic failure of coping with surplus harvests because of lack of adequate food storage and processing capacity. If the rains are good, you end up with a glut of crops and prices crash. The glut only highlights the inefficiencies of the farming value chain and hits farmers, said Ashok Gulati, an agriculturespecialist at the Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations.Take onions, for example. The vegetable is 85% water and loses weight quickly.In Lasangaon, traders buy the crop from farmers and store the onions on concrete in tarpaulin-covered sheds. If the weather stays right, 3-5% of the stored crop is wasted in storage. But if the mercury soars, more onions dry up, lose weight and 25-30% of the stored crop could be wasted.In a modern cold storage, however, onions can be stored in wooden boxes at 4 degrees. Crop wastage is less than 5%. Storage costs about a rupee for every kg of onion a month.So the government needs to make sure  or even subsidise  to keep the vegetable affordable to consumers once it reaches the retail market. We need to make the supply storage chain so efficient that the customer, farmer and the storage owner are happy. Unfortunately India hasnt been able to make that happen, Gulati said. For one, India just doesnt have enough cold storages.There are some 7,000 of them, mostly stocking potatoes in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh. Resultantly, fruits and vegetables perish very quickly. Unless India hoards food effectively, a bumper crop can easily spell doom for farmers.Secondly, theres not enough processing of food happening to ensure that crops dont perish or go waste. Take onions, again. One way to dampen volatility in onion prices is to dehydrate the bulb and make these processed onions more widely available. Currently, less than 5% of Indias fruit and vegetables is processed.Regressive methodThirdly, farmers in India plant for new harvest looking back at crop prices in the previous year. If the crop prices were healthy, they sow more of the same, hoping for still better prices.If the rains are good, a crop glut can happen easily, and lead to extraordinary fall in prices. Farmers hold on to the crops for a while, and then begin distress sales.You need to allow future prices through contract farming, not cropping based on last years prices, says Gulati. Clearly, farming policies in India need a radical overhaul. Punjab, Indias granary, is a perfect example.At a time when India does not suffer food shortages, water-guzzling wheat and rice comprise 80% of its cropped area and deplete groundwater. Rising production of cereals has meant that government has been giving paltry rises to the farmers while buying paddy and wheat, eroding their profitability.They (the policies) are distorting the choices that farmers make  those who should be finding ways to grow vegetables, which grow more expensive every year, are instead growing wheat we no longer need, says Mihir Sharma, author of Restart: The Last Chance for the Indian Economy.But the best that the governments here do is to quickly raise crop buying prices and alleviate the farmers suffering.Faced with a crop glut at home, the newly appointed BJP government in Uttar Pradesh was smart enough to promptly raise the procurement price of potatoes  and announce a controversial farm loan waiver  and quell a simmering farmers revolt .The government in Madhya Pradesh, ruled by the same party, failed to act in time. Now it says it will pay more to buy off the surplus onions. The more things change, the more they remain the same."
5a05e6e49855b76bf13c1c20,Fault lines in the fields,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/fault-lines-in-the-fields/article18952749.ece,2017-06-10,"Abhishek Patidar, 19, had just passed his Class 11 exam this year with dreams of becoming a doctor. His family owns a piece of land  about 27 bighas  in Barkheda Path, a village 22 km north of Mandsaur in Madhya Pradesh where they grow soybean, methi (fenugreek) and chana (gram). On June 6, Abhishek went to Mandsaur along with hundreds of others from his village to protest against the falling crop prices that were pushing his family to the brink of desperation. Tragically, he became one of the victims of police firing, taking three bullets on a day when farmer protests across the western belt stretching from Madhya Pradesh to Maharashtra reached a frenzied pitch. He was too young but was keen to join the protest. We grow everything in our 27-bigha land but in the last three years, prices have plunged and ruined us, says Abhisheks father, Dinesh Patidar, 55, tears rolling down his eyes.Price pinch in MalwaBarkheda Path is typical of the villages in this region. With an approximate population of 3,500, 95% of the population is engaged in farming in landholdings that are less than a hectare per family. Abhisheks family members narrate their tale of loss. The last three years have crushed our backbone because prices have plunged, forcing us to sell our produce at rates where we dont even recover our investment, says Dinesh, adding, todays market price for soybean is Rs. 2,500-2,700 per quintal while our cost to produce one quintal is above Rs. 3,000. Not only soybean, prices of onion, gram, methi , vegetables, milk have bottomed while input costs have soared for seeds, fertilizers, labour and transport, he says.Madhya Pradesh consistently boasts of double-digit growth in agriculture  averaging 13.9% during 2010-15  and like many other States, had a bumper harvest following a good monsoon in 2016. Yet as per the National Crime Records Bureau statistics, as many as 1,982 farmers committed suicide in the State in 2016-17. A combination of factors  falling procurement prices because of a glut of produce in the market, a cash crunch due to last years demonetisation policy and the predominance of smaller landholdings which are expensive to maintain  have led to a simmering anger. Like their counterparts in many parts of Maharashtra, farmers in Mandsaur launched an agitation demanding remunerative prices for their onion, soybean and pulses. As thousands of farmers poured onto the streets, stopping traffic, attacking trucks and confronting police, things turned violent and five farmers were killed as a result of police firing and a curfew was imposed across five districts.Farmers from the Mandsaur-Neemuch stretch in the Malwa region, aside from growing soybean and chana, also grow a range of spices and medicinal plants like methi , dhaniya (coriander), jeera (cumin) and ajwain (carom seeds). Yet, farmers in the region claim that prices for these cash crops have been falling for the past few years. We never sold methi below Rs. 4,000 per quintal during the Manmohan Singhs government. But ever since Modi became PM, methi prices have collapsed, says Dinesh, showing methi gunny bags stored in his house.In addition to low prices, what has aggravated the situation is the Central governments demonetisation move late last year that has adversely hit the rural and agrarian economy.  Notebandi has almost finished us in the rural areas. Even after selling our produce, we dont get money in our hands before at least two-three weeks and sometimes even a month, says Lalchand Mali, a farmer from Barkheda Panth.Interestingly, not many farmers in the region are seeking loan waiver as is being claimed in the media. Most of them want better and remunerative prices that cover their costs and provide them income for survival. Believe me, no true farmer would want loan waiver. If the government provides better prices, we will repay our debt. The problem is the government never provides better prices, adds Lalchand, who owns a two-hectare plot in the village.The Maharashtra stirIn the town of Niphad in Maharashtras Nashik district, the main vegetable market, located in a large yard opposite the tehsil office, lies deserted. In a series of godowns that lie adjacent to the yard there is a pink gleam as sunlight filters through to large sacks of onions that are waiting to be transported. In Vittal Sanaps godown, which is nearly packed to capacity with produce, a large truck with a tarpaulin cover has been parked inside for three days even as workers go about their usual task of loading onions into bright red sacks.We had an order for onions to go to Madras (Chennai) a few days back but the truck was accosted on the road before it could get to Nashik and all the onions were dumped on the road, says Sanap. Onions that are left at the mercy of the elements lose their value almost immediately, so for now Sanap is just waiting for things to tide over. The hartal (strike) will have to end soon because there are many farmers who have no choice but to sell their goods even if prices are bad.Onions and other vegetables from godowns like Sanaps go to the Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) market in Nashik from where they are taken to other cities in Maharashtra like Mumbai and Pune as well as to other States in the south like Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, and even Sri Lanka. The APMC market in Nashik is appropriately mammoth  on either side of a dusty road are two large open halls, each the size of a large bus terminus with tall pillars running right through. On June 8, a day after the one-week strike called by farmers in the region officially ended, a small group of women have set up shop to sell vegetables like cabbage, chillies, tomatoes and cucumber. They take up barely a quarter of one hall but as produce is brought in by farmers in smaller trucks, there are murmurs of anger outside with some arguments breaking out as the produce is passed inside. These women are not from Maharashtra, you can tell from their earrings that they are from Rajasthan. These are just small local farmers who want to break the strike, says one of the men. Still, even these small traces of activity raise the suspicion that divisions are beginning to form in what was till now a unified movement in the district.United in adversityAs the major commercial supplier in this region, Nashik may have become the epicentre of the farmers movement but it all started in a village called Puntamba in Ahmednagar district three months ago on April 3, when the villages gram panchayat passed a resolution warning of a Shetkari Sampa (Strike of the Ryots) from June 1. Their charter of demands addressed to Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis included ensuring crop procurement prices at least 50% above production costs, a complete waiver of farm loans, 100% subsidy on drip/sprinkler irrigation systems, and a minimum milk purchase price of Rs. 50.Farmers across the region may find a specific resonance in one or the other of these demands but what seems to have really helped the movement spread from Puntamba across the Nashik-Ahmednagar-Pune stretch of Maharashtra is the language in which the idea of the strike was communicated. Farmers face many hardships but this was the first time Ive seen farmers actually willing to go on strike to and risk everything to see that they are given some recognition, says Abhijit Dige, who owns an eight-acre farm about 60 km from Nashik. Politicians dont know what farmers go through, its not like other businesses. Devendra Fadnavis should come and work in the field for 14 hours a day, work at night in the cold to tend to onion crops, and then maybe hell understand, he says.That same sentiment is echoed by Deepak Rane who has a one-acre farm just off Niphad where he grows cauliflower. The strike should not stop because people dont realise what we go through. I am not able to recover the cost that I bear to treat my crops with chemicals and fertilizers. I work from 6 in the morning; what is it all for? he says.People from all walks of life face hardships but have you ever considered why it is only farmer suicides you have heard of? asks Dinesh Nikam, another trader in Nashik who has refused to take orders for onions and other vegetables because he says he stands in solidarity with the farmers.The illusion of prosperityWhen farm distress was first reported in Maharashtra, it focussed mainly on the prices of tur and arhar dal and the difficulties faced by farmers in the drought-prone Marathwada and Amaravati regions. After two years of consecutive drought, a good monsoon in 2016 brought in a bountiful harvest and the markets were simply swamped with produce. Record harvests were offset by a steep fall in procurement prices for both crops.The plight of those farmers is often referenced by prominent leaders of the movement in Nashik and Ahmednagar though it has to be noted that this region is substantially different. The stretch from Ahmednagar to Nashik, and down to Kolhapur and Sangli where the movement spread is a fairly contiguous belt that is home to relatively more prosperous farmers. The majority of farmers in the region over the past two decades have moved from cultivation of crops like bajra (pearl millet) and jowar (sorghum) to cash crops like grapes and onions. Many have invested in dairy farming (Puntamba, for instance, is home to many dairy farmers).Vegetables, then, are actually only a small part of the produce from this region and while the enduring visual images of the strike may be of vegetables like cauliflower and cabbage being dumped on the road, there are many places where people show us pictures shot on cell phones of roads lined with pomegranates, which is the most recent entry to the crop market here.In Italy, for instance, a village about 10 km from Niphad that was the one of the centres of the agitation, Swarupananda Bhorgade says that about 80% of the village of 5,000-odd farmers is involved in grape farming, sometimes done in rotation with onions. I have been growing grapes for the last 20 years and till about seven or eight years ago I used to sell it for about Rs. 50 a kilo, says Bhorgade. So it was only natural that I planted grapes on every inch of my 15 acres. Now it costs me about Rs. 15 to harvest a kilo of grapes and all I can get on the market is Rs. 9 to Rs. 18 a kilo, he says.Bhorgade attributes this to a number of factors, the most important of which is climate  storms would come unseasonably and the crops would be destroyed. Or there would be hailstorms. This past year, the weather was regular and the crop was good for once but there is no price. You have to take into account how much we have spent on growing these crops and how we will recover it. It costs a lot to invest in crops like grapes and pomegranates, he says, adding that farmers from the region initially tried to rope in their counterparts from Amaravati who grew tur dal but their situation was completely different. They have larger landholdings and their crop is rain-fed. They dont have to spend on irrigation and other chemicals and fertilizer like we do.On June 3, a faction of farmer leaders decided to call off the strike after Mr. Fadnavis announced a partial loan waiver for small and marginal farmers that would come into effect on October 31. In a large meeting on June 8 in Nashik that included about 3,000 farmers and 150 representatives of farmer associations from across the State, that compromise was rejected. The people who met the Chief Minister did so late at night without anybody knowing and the agreement was not along the lines of what we were originally demanding, said Raju Shetti, president of Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana that has taken a major role in advancing the agenda. If the government did not accede to the demand to waive all loans immediately and bump up procurement prices, the meeting decided that the strike would move to a new phase of hartals across district and collectors offices from June 12 and rail rokos  in some areas. As of June 8, the meeting concluded that farmers should be allowed to take their produce to the market in order to meet their minimum needs. Look for Puntamba on that day (June 12), says one of the farmers who attended the meeting. The first rail roko will be there, where it all started."

PTIWRAPPING UP a week that saw violent protests by farmers in Madhya Pradesh demanding better price for their produce, resulting in death of six farmers in police firing in Mandsaur, Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan on Saturday began a fast on Bhopals Dussehra Maidan to calm frayed tempers and assured farmers that his government would give them profitable prices. Both the Opposition Congress and Shiv Sena, a BJP ally at the Centre and in Maharashtra, criticised Chouhan for going on indefinite fast instead of addressing the issue.No violence was reported from any part of the state, including Mandsaur, the epicentre of the agitation, on Saturday. Curfew was lifted in Mandsaur town, though night curfew will continue in Pipliamandi, where five farmers were killed in police firing on Tuesday. Chouhan, who met small groups of farmers, said that he realises a bumper crop production sent prices crashing, and that the state government stands firm with farmers.We are going to buy farm produce and give profitable prices for it. We have already bought a huge quantity of onions at minimum support price (MSP) of Rs 8 per kg. Each onion of farmers will be bought We are going to buy different varieties of pulses at MSP, PTI quoted Chouhan as saying. BJP general secretary Kailash Vijaywargiya met Chouhan and told him that farmers were at times unable to reap the benefits of welfare schemes due to shortcomings of the bureaucracy.In Delhi, Congress spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said, Shivraj Singh Chouhans fast is a dramait is a shamnothing but a pretence. He should answer why a case of murder has not been filed in the death of five farmers in MP.

On screen were reports of doctors striking work across the state in protest against the growing violence against them. Patil, upset by the dip in onion prices, threw an idea at his friends that evening, one that would take Maharashtra by storm. Why cant we strike work like the doctors have? By then, Dr Sanjay Dhanvate, managing director of Puntambas Asha Kiran Paraplegic Center, was already thinking along the same lines. The states farmers had tried everything from fasts to railway blockades  with little success. A strike would be the ultimate weapon  farmers would not grow or trade in agri commodities, he says.On April 3, the Puntamba Gram Sabha unanimously passed an eight-point charter of demands threatening a strike from June 1 if they were not met. A single village on strike would hardly be news, so over the next few days we asked almost 200 villages to pass similar resolutions, says Dhorde Patil, who was once associated with Anna Hazares India Against Corruption movement. With Nashik and Ahmednagar villages leading the way, over 2,000 gram panchayats passed resolutions of a Shetkari Sampa or farmers strike on May 1, Maharashtra Day. Incidentally, it was local BJP leader Dhananjay Jadhav who took the lead in Puntamba. A meeting was held in Pune on May 11 to form a core committee to spearhead the movement. Some villagers had reservations about the speed at which things were moving, but we followed Jadhavs lead anyway, says Suhas Wadane, a villager.At the Pune meeting, additional power centres emerged. There was the Karad-based event manager Sandeep Gidde, Kamal Sawant of the Bhumata Sanghatana and Shantaram Kunjir of the Maratha Seva Sangh. This core committee then began to travel across the state to spread the word of the plans for June 1, Dhanvate says. Simultaneously, Raju Shetti of the Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana party, an ally of the ruling BJP, had begun to openly express his unhappiness with the Maharashtra governments intransigence on a farm loan waiver. By mid-May, even as Dhanvate and 20 villagers prepared to meet Fadnavis, Shetti was planning a padyatra from Pune to Mumbai. At their meeting with the CM, Dhanvate and team were willing to reverse the strike call. But new leaders had emerged and several organisations decided to continue, admits Dhanvate.Days later, Shettis padyatra began, more or less independent of the other organisations. But the thousands of farmers who attended Shettis rallies along his route didnt really see the two struggles as separate. The demands were the same. Shettis yatra, which he labelled as his Atmaklesh Yatra  a self-professed repentance for supporting the BJP  should have set off alarm bells, but senior government sources say the administration failed to recognise its seriousness as for one, Shettis own party colleague, Maharashtra minister of state for agriculture Sadashiv Khot, had conspicuously stayed away.Once the strike kicked in and the urban centres began to feel the pinch, with supplies squeezed, the core committee was called for a marathon discussion with Fadnavis in Mumbai on June 2. The committee and the CM announced the withdrawal of the strike before dawn on June 3, with the government agreeing to the Rs 30,000 crore loan waiver. But by then the movement had acquired a life of its own. Those in Nashik and elsewhere too refused to call off the strike  the assurances were not in line with their demands.The core committee became the target of farmers ire. Giddes proximity to Khot, and the fact that top negotiator Jayajirao Suryavanshi had stayed back at Khots bungalow, incensed farmers who saw it as a betrayal. In Puntamba, where it all began, Jadhavs ties with the BJP led villagers to declare that the government was trying to sabotage the movement. While Suryavanshi eventually had to apologise, Jadhav is still to return to Puntamba even though the strike was called off on June 8.There was also a new core committee, with major political players in lead roles. Apart from Shetti, independent MLA Bacchu Kadu, president of the Kisan Sabha, Ajit Newale, veteran Shetkari Sanghatana leader Ragunath Patil and others were now picked to head the movement. It was this committees first meeting on Thursday that ended the strike, but with the new ultimatum that the state should hold talks by Monday, June 12. A strikingly similar chain of events unfolded in Madhya Pradesh. When Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan called the Bharatiya Kisan Sangh (BKS) for talks four days after the farmers stir began on June 1, he was confident. The BKS, the largest farmers organisation in the state, is allied to the RSS and has in the past helped the Shivraj regime. In 2012, when angry farmers engaged in arson and beat up government and police officials in Bareli in Raisen district, the RSS simply sacked then BKS chief Shivkumar Sharma. The government slapped a slew of cases against Sharma while the RSS installed new leaders.This time, seated next to the CM at the Ujjain Circuit House on June 5, BKS general secretary Shivkant Dixit announced that the strike had been called off, and that the state government had agreed to buy onions at Rs 8 a kg. But the gamble backfired. Farmers felt betrayed  the BKS wasnt originally in the picture and appeared to have jumped on to the bandwagon only to derail the strike. As farmers bodies continued their protests, the government detained two office-bearers of the Bharatiya Kisan Union, a little-known organisation that claimed to have started the protests. Officials believed the situation had been tackled effectively. But here too, the agitation had acquired a life of its own. When the five farmers were killed in Mandsaur on Tuesday, June 6, Chouhan, despite his pro-farmer image, studiously avoided the historical town in the Malwa region even three days after the incident.The situation was bad due to low prices, and got worse after demonetisation, concedes BJP MLA from Mandsaur Yashpal Singh Sisodiya. He says the violence was a fallout of a combination of factors  falling prices, demonetisation, difficulty in getting loans form cooperatives, anger against local policemen, involvement of anti-social elements and even liquor mafia and infiltration of the movement by criminals. According to Sisodiya, the police took on the liquor mafia after a local journalist was shot dead near Pipliya Mandi last month. Police had rounded up nearly 50 people, angering them, the MLA says.Mandsaurs Lok Sabha MP, Sudhir Gupta of the BJP, terms the violence as a conspiracy hatched by the Congress. While admitting there are issues with bank transactions and poor prices for produce, the escalation of violence, he says, was politically motivated. Some BJP leaders say the government failed to anticipate the scale of the protest, as was the case, they say, when Hardik Patels Patidar movement hit Gujarat. Hardik, however, has limited support in MP, where his community already enjoys OBC status.He is desperate to come to Mandsaur but I have persuaded him against doing so. Im not sure if his presence will help or aggravate the situation, claims the state chief of the Patidar Samaj, Mahendra Patidar, who was among the very few people allowed access to one or two families of the victims of Tuesdays firing. Meanwhile, in both states, the farmers demands include a total farm loan waiver and adherence to the MSP regime. Neither government has so far come out with final announcements.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

This phenomenon gave rise to violent protests by farmers in Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan.The death of six farmers in clashes with the police in Madhya Pradeshs Mandsaur district brought the farm crisis into national focus, uniting the Opposition against the National Democratic Alliance government. The Centre, for its part, reiterated its promise of doubling farmers income by 2020.The indicators of how farm produce prices crashed this year became clear on Monday, when the Consumer Price Index (CPI) was released. One can understand the reasons for farm distress in a bumper crop year by comparing CPI prices with the latest wholesale prices of pulses and vegetables in agricultural markets.The index showed that vegetable prices fell by about 13.5% in May, as compared to the corresponding month last year. The dip in the price of pulses was even higher, at 19.5%. This led to an overall deflation of 1.05% in food prices for the first time since 2012.The fall was higher in wholesale markets, where farmers offload their produce, with pulses and vegetables selling at nearly two-thirds (or 63%) of last years price. It was a sad year for farmers despite having a bumper crop after two tough years (of drought), observed T Haque, former head of the Commission for Agriculture Costs and Prices (CACP).MANDI REPORT Main produce of each state suffered as prices crashedMain produce of each state suffered as prices crashedIn many states, the farmers have not even been able to recover the input costs, he said, adding that it was the responsibility of both the Centre and the states to ensure that agriculturists are provided with a price cushion.Highs and lowsIndias farm sector production grew by 8% this year, the highest ever.According to agriculture ministry data, the production of pulses amounted to 22.14 million tones  50% higher than 2014-15. Horticultural products, for their part, witnessed a growth of over 40%.However, the high production caused an unprecedented glut in farm markets already loaded with imported food items  including pulses. The government imposed 10% duty on these items in May, after prices crashed.In 2015-16, the Centre had allowed the import of pulses such as pigeon peas (tur dal) and lentils (mosur) to check rising prices even as the Opposition accused it of failing to control food inflation. The resultant glut in the market caused prices to come crashing, and the dip was as low as 80% for commodities such as onions and pigeon peas.I could not find a buyer for my produce for two whole days, said Mandsaur farmer Rakesh Patidar, who was finally left with no option but to sell his onions for Re 1 per kg in mid-May.Many farmers like Rakesh started growing onions after their prices skyrocketed in 2014, leading to a significant increase in its area under cultivation. Pigeon peas witnessed a similar trend in 2015 owing to crop failure.It seems like farmers were not looking at anything else, said a senior agriculture ministry functionary on the record production of onion and pigeon peas. They thought onions and pigeon peas would fetch them a good price, but they lost money instead.Farmers in Madhya Pradeshs violence-hit Malwa region, who have been growing onions since 2015, are now witnessing a dip in prices for the second year in a row. The situation is similar in many parts of Maharashtra, where the state government has now announced loan waivers.India is not the only country to have witnessed a steep fall in prices of pulses and vegetables this year. According to agriculture ministry officials, there has been an over 50% dip in prices across the globe due to a demand crunch. However, unlike India, farmers in other countries have the requisite infrastructure to store their produce and sell when prices stabilise."

Onion was being sold for just Rs 1 in Madhya Pradesh till the state government stepped in to buy, potato is still being sold for 80 paise in Haryana and pigeon pea (tur dal) is fetching no more than Rs 40 in Maharashtra.The glut and plunging prices is the sum total of the crisis staring at farmers across the length and breath of the country. Last week, matters came to a head after farmers protest in Mandsaur of Madhya Pradesh turned violent, resulting in six deaths.Like everywhere else, Mandsaur farmers were agitating after they were forced to sell onions at just Rs1 a kg. The prices are well below what they fetched in 2016: Onion for Rs 1 as against Rs 7, turmeric for Rs 50, half the price in 2016, soya bean at 33% lesser than the rate in 2016 and so on.Farmers blame their plight on demonetisation and the failure of the government to impose adequate import duty on time.Farm economy runs on cash and traders say they have no money to give us. We are forced to sell the produce at whatever price they (traders) are offering, said Jasbir Mamumajra, a sunflower grower from Yamunanagar in Haryana, who blamed demonetisation for his woes.Most of the agriculture trade used to run on cash, mostly unaccounted money, and on credit. With cash being sucked out, the traders have less liquid asset to take risks. In some places they are seeking a commission of up to 2% to make payment in cash.A farm trader in Indias food bowl of Punjab, Devinder Singh, agrees, saying note-bandhi has disturbed the trade cycle. Entire trade shifted to no-credit system. It has hit us hard, he said.An agriculture expert with Bihar government, Anil Kumar Jha, said input costs such as labour, fertilisers and pesticides have gone up significantly this year. This added to the miseries of farmers, already facing cash crisis due to demonetisation.Maharashtra farmers, who were first to protest after prices of pigeon pea (tur dal) fell, blamed the Centre for not imposing high import duty on pulses.The production cost of the tur per quintal is more than Rs5,000 for farmers. With the Union government allowing the import of lentil at Rs 3,700 a quintal, the farmers are not likely to recover their cost, said Vijay Jawandhia, farm activist and Shetkari Sangathana leader.Same was the complaint by farmers in Haryana, who have been forced to sell sunflower at Rs 2,500 per quintal as against the minimum support price of Rs 3,950 even though the cost of seeds have increased by almost 50% in 2016.We could have been saved had the government increased import duty on edible (palm) oil, said Balwinder Singh, a Karnal-based farmer. However, state government officials blamed poor quality for the low price.In Asias largest grain market in Khanna, Punjab, the prices of maize have plummeted with traders like Sanjeev Kumar saying the farmers are bearing the brunt. In Uttar Pradesh, farmers sold wheat at less than the minimum support price, saying government agencies were not willing to buy the produce because of the record production this year.Wholesale traders in Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh said the prices of onion, tomato and potato have crashed.The per quintal wholesale prices of the onion in Maharashtra was down to Rs 600-800 from Rs 1,000-1,250 in 2016. Potato in Haryana was sold at Rs 80 a quintal on Tuesday. Farmers sold onion for Rs 1 in Madhya Pradesh after which the government announced a procurement price of Rs 8 per kilogram.P Chengal Reddy, founder-chairman of the Consortium of Indian Farmers Associations (CIFA), said: The Centre takes into consideration the average production of past three years and not the current years production cost, in deciding the MSP. If it continues, time is not far when farmers across the country will revolt, he said.(With inputs from state bureaus)"

""Who organises meeting with farmers in AC hall? While we have to sell our farms due to financial crisis, the CM invites select farmers to his programme.

They are seeking higher support price for their produce and waiver of loans.Onion output from the crop sown during late kharif (summer) season of the 2016-17 crop year has been higher which led to huge arrivals in mandis and fall in prices.The official said the price drop was because the onion coming into the mandis was of 'table' variety and not stored due to low shelf life.Excess supply amid low demand led to crash in prices, which has hit farmers revenues. Also, the scale of arrival is so much that farmers are not able to grade the crop on the basis of size, traders said.Grading of onions would have helped MP farmers fetch better prices in Delhi and other markets, a trader said, adding that better support to growers is the need of the hour to handle problem of plenty in the state.Madhya Pradesh produces about 26-28 LT onions annually.

It is the culmination of the acute distress in the farm sector that many observers have written and spoken about in the last two years. Two years of drought in many states was the main cause. The governments cannot be blamed for the occurrence of drought, but governments are solely responsible for the mismanagement of the consequences of drought. Apart from the natural calamity of drought, there were man-made calamities, and this column is about how the two have brought about the explosive situation in the country.The bulk of farmers in India have no choice but to do farming. Land is the only asset they have, farming is the only skill they possess, and unless they grow food many of them will face starvation. Agriculture, despite its declining share in total output (GDP), is also the largest employer. In Indias economy, the agriculture sector has primacy.The Price of NeglectUnfortunately, the NDA government lost sight of this basic truth. The agriculture portfolio is the Cinderella of this government. The Minister of Agriculture, unchanged since May 2014, is a political lightweight with little clout within the government. (How many of you can name Mr Sharad Pawars successor?). The minister has been neither seen nor heard by most people. The only memorable statement on agriculture that I can recall was when he repeated the Prime Ministers promise to double farmers income in 6 years and when asked if they had meant real income or nominal income, there was deafening silence.On the other hand, the government erred grievously on the issue of minimum support prices (MSP). In its manifesto and in the election campaign, the BJP had unequivocally promised that it would implement the M S Swaminathan Committees recommendation that MSP should be cost plus 50 per cent. In government, the BJP not only reneged on its promise, it dealt a body blow to farmers by denying them even a reasonable increase in MSP in its first three years. The numbers speak for themselves:The ostensible reason for denying a fair MSP was that higher MSP fueled inflation, which is partly true, but to lean in favour of inflation control against the interest of Indias farmer-producers was the height of folly. Some inflation is inevitable, and the government and the RBI must use other instruments to moderate inflation rather than reduce the farming community to penury.Errors galoreThe second grave error was demonetisation. Mr Harish Damodaran has convincingly demonstrated how demonetisation has crippled the post-harvest agricultural economy (see The Crops of Wrath, Indian Express, June 12, 2017). Agricultural products are bought and sold largely in cash. Demonetisation dried up liquidity and prices have crashed. According to Mr Damodaran, never before have prices of tomato, potato and onion crashed at the same time. Same is the situation with soyabean, arhar, garlic, methi (fenugreek) and grapes. Saying that farmers have resorted to fire sales, Mr Damodarans conclusion is, We have entered deflation territory in farm produce, whose proximate trigger clearly has been demonetisation.The third error was when the Prime Minister announced, on behalf of the yet-to-be-elected Uttar Pradesh government, that all farm loans in UP will be waived if the BJP formed the government. More likely, it was just an election promise in a state that the BJP perhaps did not expect to win, but it was an unequivocal promise that has returned to haunt the BJP in several states. Farm loan waivers are neither intrinsically good nor bad. As Dr M S Swaminathan said a few days ago, Loan waivers, though temporarily necessary, do not provide for a secure long term credit system (emphasis supplied). When farmers do not get a fair and reasonable price and are unable to repay their loans, they demand a loan waiver. The holder of the highest political office promised a total loan waiver, why blame the farmers for demanding that the promise be implemented?In February 2008, the fiscal situation was excellent, growth had found a new momentum, and a one-time loan forgiveness to small and medium farmers was justified. The central government was confident it could fund the waiver and so it went ahead and announced it. In 2017, however, every prudent norm was turned on its head. The Prime Minister promised a loan waiver on behalf of an yet-to-be-elected state government, no one seems to have examined the capacity of UP to bear the burden, and no one seems to have factored the fallout in other states. Having mounted a tiger, the BJP does not know how to dismount it. Meanwhile, the tiger is galloping through Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Punjab, Haryana, Maharashtra and Gujarat.Jobless youth angryThe last straw was jobless growth. Young men can find no work on farms or off farms. Micro, small and medium businesses are not offering new jobs. Tier 2, 3 and 4 towns are full of jobless youth and their anger has turned against the central government. The BJP will not admit its mistakes. Nor will any BJP leader tell the Prime Minister that mistakes were made. Will the Prime Minister pull a rabbit out of the hat? Wait and see.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

PTI Photo Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan consoles family members of a deceased farmer, killed in the recent police firing, at village Lodh in Mandsaur district. PTI PhotoThe farmers protests in Madhya Pradesh (MP) and Maharashtra indicate that all is not well on the economic front, especially agriculture. If such unrest could happen in MP, which claims to have registered the fastest agri-GDP growth at 9.7 per cent per year during 2005-06 to 2014-15, then no state is likely to be immune from it.MP has been a showcase for the performance of BJP-ruled states in agriculture. But it now appears that agriculture could be Prime Minister Narendra Modis Achilles heel. The governments poor performance in the sector at the all-India level  testified to by a growth rate of less than 2 per cent per annum during 2014/15 to 2016/17  has to be addressed quickly, and in a sustained manner. Otherwise, the neglect of agriculture may cost the PM heavily in 2019.What has really gone wrong with agriculture during the Modi era? And how can it be fixed? We focus here on prices and farm loans, although agriculture suffers from a number of problems.The current protest in MP seems to have been triggered by the crash in onion prices, but it also drew strength from the news of loan waivers in Uttar Pradesh (UP) and Maharashtra. The seeds of competitive loan waivers were sown by the PM himself  at a rally during the election to the UP assembly, he announced that farmer loans will be waived in the very first meeting of the new UP cabinet, if the BJP were to be voted to power in the state. The new UP Chief Minister, Yogi Adityanath, followed the PMs advice diligently.Farmers in other states have been watching, and the loan waiver could lead to a demand for similar waivers in other states  Haryana, Punjab, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. We wont be surprised if loan waivers cost state treasuries Rs 2,00,000 crore in the months to come, taking state-level deficits closer to 4 per cent of their GDP.What is it that the farmers are demanding? Simply remunerative prices for their farm produce. The BJP had promised in its 2014 election manifesto that if voted to office, the party will ensure 50 per cent margin to farmers over their costs. Where does the Modi government stand on that promise after three years in office, compared to the last three years of the Manmohan Singh government?Graphics by Sarfaraz Graphics by SarfarazWe dug out official data of net margins (the MSP minus cost C2) from the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices reports of the last six years (see Graph 1). The bitter truth is that net margins in most agricultural commodities  paddy, maize, cotton, gram, sugarcane  have actually declined during the Modi regime. Moreover, if one looks at just 2016-17 data, there were negative margins on several commodities: Jowar (-18 per cent), ragi (-20 per cent), sesamum (-14 per cent), sunflower (-13 per cent), groundnut (-4 per cent), moong (-7 per cent) and urad (-4 per cent). With a glut in tur production, market prices fell way below the MSP and the real losses were even higher. Potatoes, onions and tomatoes seem to have met the same fate.No wonder there is widespread unrest amongst farmers. They suffered back-to-back droughts in the first two years of the Modi government, and now, in the third year, despite good rains and bumper harvests, they are suffering due to the collapse in prices. Loan waivers are not a solution: They are band-aids and give temporary breathing space to policymakers.The best way to handle prices is to get the markets right. Remember, prices are determined by the forces of demand and supply, and cost enters through the supply curve. Factoring in only the costs plus pricing without considering the demand side can lead to even greater distortions, and therefore needs to be avoided.But how does one get markets right? Take the case of tur; India had a bumper harvest of tur in the last season. But the government banned its exports, private entities were not allowed to hold stocks and trading in futures had also been banned. No wonder, with bumper harvest on the one hand, and strangulated markets on the other, prices crashed, tumbling way below the MSP, creating misery for farmers and causing unrest.The solution is simple: Abolish all export bans, private stocking limits and restrictions on futures trading in all agri-commodities. This is all the more desirable in commodities whose imports are open at low or zero duties. If this is not done, the government will be forced to buy all commodities whose prices nosedive. This is neither an efficient, nor a feasible policy option.For perishables like onions, potatoes and tomatoes, we need more and better storage facilities, linkages with processing firms, contract farming, opening land lease markets, etc. We need to develop efficient, equitable value chains  like the AMUL model in dairy.But there is one problem on the agri-credit front that needs to be addressed urgently. Farmers need cash immediately after harvests to pay their debts from formal and informal sources. Warehouse receipt systems and giving the farmers advances against their stocks is the way to go.The biggest failure of the RBI and NABARD has been on the financial inclusion front: Even in 2013  the latest information we have  of the total outstanding debt of rural households, 44 per cent came from informal sources (Graph 2). Interest rates in the informal sector hover anywhere from 15-30 per cent.Thus, instead of interest subvention schemes, the government needs to focus on financial inclusion if it wants to address farmers problems on a sustainable basis.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

The average wholesale onion price, which was around Rs 450 per quintal last month, has now settled at Rs 550 for every 100 kg.Onion auction could not take place for almost 11 days as farmers did not bring their produce at the Lasalgaon APMC. But it started from July 12 after the state government announced farm loan waiver to marginal farmers.Speaking to TOI, an official from APMC said, ""The average wholesale onion price has increased by 22% in eight days due to rise in demand as compared to supply. The supply is in the range from 15,000 to 25,000 quintal a day.""He added, ""The average wholesale onion price is expected to increase by another 15-20% from next week. The demand may increase after Ramzan is over.""Meanwhile, the minimum and maximum prices at Lasalgaon were recorded at Rs 250 and Rs 670 per quintal, respectively. Around 16,000 quintal of onions were auctioned at Lasalgaon on Tuesday.Currently, there is no fresh harvest and the onions arriving in the market are summer crop from the storage of farmers. The summer crop has a shelf life of six months and farmers prefer storing onions.They bring their produce to the market as per their requirement. The summer crop caters to the market until the arrival of fresh kharif crop by mid-October."

Little had he thought that the issue would gather momentum just five months down the line and force the Narendra Modi government to consider loan waiver for small and marginal farmers.In a way, the demands for farm loan waiver could be BJPs own doing. Maharasthra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, who had been steadfast in his opposition to a loan waiver, admitted that he was forced to announce writing off debts of small and marginal farmers due to immense pressure from the farmers whose expectations had risen manifold following similar moves by Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana.The Congress had already raised the pitch for farm loan waiver with vice president Rahul Gandhi undertaking a month-long kisan yatra across Uttar Pradesh in September last year. Though the yatra did not benefit the Congress politically, it did raise expectations of the farmers. The BJP too responded by mentioning farm loan waiver for small and marginal farmers in its manifesto for Uttar Pradesh.Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in his election rallies, went to the extent of saying that the BJP government in Uttar Pradesh will take a decision on farm loan waiver in its first cabinet meeting. The pressure on the Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath for announcing the loan waiver was telling as he kept delaying the meeting of the cabinet that usually takes place within hours of the new government assuming office. The council of ministers met a couple of times informally as bureaucrats put together proposal for the loan write off for the cabinet to consider in its first meeting.The announcement by the Uttar Pradesh government led to demands for a farm loan waiver from other states such as Maharashtra, Karnataka, Uttarakhand, Tamil Nadu among others. Maharashtra bowed to the demands from farmers and declared a farm loan waiver for needy farmers. The state government put stringent conditions to exclude well-off farmers from the loan waiver scheme to limit its expenditure.As soon as Maharashtra announced its farm loan waiver, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley made it clear that the state government will have to fund the initiative from its own resources and not expect any bailout by the Centre. The Punjab government became the third state to announce a farm loan waiver for small and marginal farmers on June 19, a promise made by the Congress during the poll campaign in the state. In a bid for political one-upmanship, Chief Minister Amarinder Singh also announced loan waiver up to Rs 2 lakh  double than what has been offered by UP and Maharashtra.At the heart of the crisis is absence of remunerative prices for farm produce. In simpler terms, a person dependent only on agriculture as a means of livelihood finds it difficult to make both ends meet as he does not earn enough. As prices of pulses, fruits and vegetables shot up during the past two years due to drought, the government had put in place stringent curbs on exports and stockholding by traders. The same were not eased after a spell of good monsoon led to bumper production.The glut of pulses and onions saw farmers making a beeline to market yards to sell their produce leading to a sharp reduction in procurement prices. In Maharashtra, stagnant milk prices had irked farmers who threw milk on the roads instead of selling it to dairies. In Uttar Pradesh, potato growers threw their produce on roads as wholesale prices dipped on account of better production. Similar was the case with onion growers in Madhya Pradesh.The simmering discontent among farmers in Madhya Pradesh led to protests in Mandsaur where six farmers were killed in police firing on June 6. Things took a political turn as leaders made a beeline to Mandsaur to express solidarity with farmers.Delicate issueIn both Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh, the governments hastily reached out to a section of favourable farmer leaders, agreed to some of their demands and called off the strike. Such handling of a delicate issue further angered the farmers who looked towards leaders such as Shiv Kumar Sharma alias Kakkaji in Madhya Pradesh and Raju Shetti in Maharashtra to take their struggle to a logical conclusion.While Sharma heads the breakaway faction of the RSS-backed Bhartiya Kisan Sangh, Shetti leads the Swabhimani Shetkari Sangathan in Maharashtra. Sharma was thrown out of the BKS following his frequent run-ins with Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan. Shetti, a Lok Sabha member from Hatkanangale near Kolhapur, is part of the NDA but is increasingly disillusioned with Prime Minister Narendra Modis farm policies.Shetti believes that Modi has lost the script when it came to tackling the agrarian distress as the government, instead of addressing pressing issues such as remunerative prices, was busy pursuing soil health cards. His consistent demand  Modi should fulfil the poll promise of implementing the M S Swaminathan Committee Report that has recommended a 50% margin over the cost of cultivation incurred by the farmers.Farmers were already operating on thin margins, which have dipped even further over the last three years. The poll promise on MSP has remained just that  a promise, with neither the agriculture minister nor the prime minister making any reference to it. The much-touted agri-market reforms too have floundered and so has the flagship programme to provide irrigation facilities to every farm. As many as 23 of the 99 delayed irrigation projects were to be completed by March 2017. The government has missed the deadline.On the political front, the strain on the NDA is showing. Modi had run a tight ship since coming to power in 2014, but allies such as Shiv Sena and Shettis Swabhiman Paksha have been growing restless and have raised a banner of revolt. The agriculture sector is desperately seeking new vigour and fresh leadership to pull it out of the crisis."

(PTI Photo, File) Nagpur: Farmers throwing vegetables on a road during a protest as part of the Maharashtra bandh over various demands in Nagpur, Maharashtra on Monday. (PTI Photo, File)A HUNDRED years after Mahatma Gandhi led a movement of indigo growers against their oppressor landlords in Bihars Champaran district, farmers of Maharashtra launched an unprecedented strike early this month. But unlike the Champaran Satyagraha, this was a movement led by farmers themselves. It started with farmers from Puntamba, a sleepy village in Ahmednagar district, deciding at a Gram Sabha meeting in April to stop supply of all produce to cities from June 1. That resolution was subsequently adopted by farmers in villages across Maharashtra, culminating in a stunningly successful strike lasting almost 11 days.The striking farmers not only shut down wholesale produce markets and blocked highways to prevent delivery trucks from reaching urban centres, but also even dumped milk and vegetables on the streets. The Maharashtra government was, then, forced to constitute a Cabinet subcommittee of five ministers to hold consultations on the main demands that included a complete waiver of institutional farm loans and remunerative crop prices based on theM S Swaminathan reports formula of 50 per cent returns over cost. These demands were accepted in principle, following which the strike was called off. The collective might of farmers had clearly triumphed over the all-powerful state.The Maharashtra farmers agitation was remarkable for not only its seeming spontaneity and absence of any towering leader, but also it happening in an above-normal rainfall and bumper agricultural harvest year. Such protests one would have normally expected in the event of losses from drought, especially of the kind seen in 2014-15 and 2015-16.But as the accompanying table shows, the Maharashtra government infused around Rs 20,939 crore during the two consecutive drought years through time-honoured relief measures such as crop loss compensation, insurance claims and labour payments under MGNREGA. In addition, rescheduling of crop loans and reduced interest on these  plus the state governments ambitious Jalyukta Shivar programme of water and soil conservation in 25,000 drought-prone villages  turned out to be significant interventions.The trigger for the current farmers agitation has not been any natural calamity-driven distress, which was, on the whole, deftly handled by the state government. Instead, it has primarily been prices.A bumper crop resulting from good rains had ignited hopes among farmers of setting-off their losses from previous years. But what they encountered was a price crash across crops  from cereals and pulses to vegetables and fruits.Take pulses, where the Centre, in a bid to promote their cultivation to bridge domestic shortages, raised the minimum support price for tur (pigeon-pea) from Rs 4,625 to Rs 5,050 per quintal. Farmers obliged by increasing production, but the government failed to honour its promise. Far from getting the promised rate, farmers had to dump tur for as low as Rs 3,000 per quintal. Even during peak summer, they realised hardly Rs 5 per kg for tomatoes, onions and other vegetables.In short, farmers suffered more with record production on the back of good rains than when there was crop failure from drought.A second trigger for the stir was the crop loan waiver announcement by a newly-elected government in Uttar Pradesh, which took place around the same time prices were crashing. Farmer organisations admit that waiving loans cannot be a real solution, but say that it will have a soothing effect in the present context. At the least, it will bring many farmers back into the formal credit system. Also, if there can be a farm loan waiver in UP, then why not in Maharashtra?What is clear from the above is that the risk of price fluctuation in agricultural commodities isnt covered by any of the existing government relief mechanisms. The need of the hour is a framework that insulates farmers from the shocks of not just natural calamities, but also market price crashes. And loan waiver cannot provide any sustainable solution.That said, the Maharashtra farmers agitation  and the state government having to eventually concede to an unconditional loan waiver  is a game-changer, simply for showing how even an otherwise unorganised class can successfully express and negotiate demands. Organised labour unions, not to speak of industry associations like FICCI and CII, are known for constantly engaging in promoting and protecting the interests of their members. Farmers have had no such arrangements for collective lobbying. In this case, though, ordinary farmers under the most lugubrious conditions stood firm on their demands, resisting attempts to divide and weaken their ranks.The following elements may have contributed to the invisible glue of emotional unity among Maharashtras farmers: * Insensitive statements against farmers by some responsible public figures even amidst tumbling crop prices. Similar statements from top bankers (and also the financial regulator) against loan waivers and the possible adverse impact on repayment culture would only have further fuelled resentment among farmers.* The photos/videos of farmers ploughing back their onion and tomato crops because of not being able to afford the additional cost of harvesting. These images went viral on social media and were exchanged by farmers with one another. n Drying up of credit post-demonetisation from cooperatives, the lifeline of farmers in Maharashtra. They were, then, compelled to approach commercial banks and moneylenders for credit on far less favourable terms.* A spike in suicides, including in northern Maharashtra, the countrys top onion and grape producer. The latter belt has been the epicentre of the strike. The losses to its farmers have been more, as they grow a host of cash crops entailing higher investment and also exhibiting greater sensitivity to price crashes. These farmers are generally more well-off, educated and combative. They, not surprisingly, provided the leadership for the movement.* A sustained public debate on farm debt waiver in the last two years, amidst talk of loan write-offs for big corporates. The Oppositions Sangharsh Yatra and also a ruling coalition partners Atmakalesh Yatra marches in support of loan waiver would only have created the perfect pitch for the farmers strike.These elements established a common chord of angst amongst lakhs of farmers, culminating in a state-wide agitation. This is a classic example of collective behaviour driven by group dynamics that leads people to engage in unthinkable acts under unusual circumstances, as was propounded by the American social scientist Robert E Park. And nobody could have imagined that the success of Maharashtras farmer strike would pave the way for similar demands elsewhere, including in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

He stressed upon the need to buy pulses, onion and coarse cereals before the rainy season and assured farmers that their crops will be bought by the Centre and the state government. Paswan assured that the Centre will provide all support to the state government.The western Madhya Pradesh recently witnessed a major farmers agitation for loan waiver and remunerative prices. The protest intensified after the death of five persons in police firing in Mandsaur district on June 6.Besides, the number of debt-ridden farmers who have ended their lives in the state in the last fortnight has reached 22 as yet another debt-burdened peasant has allegedly committed suicide in Chhatarpur.In MP, there is a bumper crop production. The growth of agriculture sector is more than 20 per cent. Whether its fruits and vegetables or foodgrains, there has been a bumper production in the state. This is a reason for happiness for us. But at the same time prices have fallen due to bumper harvest which is a problem for farmers, Chouhan told reporters.The Chief Minister said he has requested the Union food minister to buy pulses through the Food Corporation of India (FCI) in the state at MSP so that procurement of all crops arriving in the mandies could be procured before rainy season. Chouhan also demanded that the Centre should buy coarse cereals at MSP.Responding to these demands, Paswan said: MP is a state which is producing bumper crop. The state government faces problem because of this as sometimes prices goes below MSP. I have discussed this issue with Agriculture Minister. We are taking steps and will take more to solve this problem.Chouhan said the state government is also procuring onion and pulses. The state has procured 3.2 lakh tonnes of onion out of 32 lakh tonnes production. The Chief Minister complemented the Centre for Aadhaar-seeding of ration cards to eliminate bogus cards.However, he demanded that distribution of foodgrains should be permitted in some genuine cases where there is a problem in verification of beneficiary because of poor internet connectivity or biometrics.The Food Minister has assured me that he will provide all support to the state, Chouhan said. Madhya Pradesh produces about 26-28 lakh tonnes onions annually. It is the second largest producer after Maharashtra.Wholesale prices of onion have fallen sharply below Rs 6 per kg in the state as the crop production during late kharif season of the 2016-17 crop year (July-June) was higher.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

There are a few unresolved issues, which will be discussed and sorted later. Also, the government must address the others demands made by the farmers without wasting time, Pawar.The NCP chief insisted that the BJP government must implement recommendations of Swaminathan Commission to rid farmers across India of their financial woes.The BJP had promised this in its election manifesto, while Narendra Modi had assured it in all his election rallies, Pawar said.Pointing out that it has been two years since the state formed an Agriculture Price Commission, Pawar said the commission will ensure implementation of minimum support price to farmers.He also drew attention to the plight of onion and tur farmers across Maharashtra. Pawar said onion farmers were facing hardships as the price bottomed because of a bumper crop, while the government had stopped purchasing tur.We need to export both the items and farmers needed financial assistance to do so. The decision to waive farm loan will backfire if the state fails to address this issue in time, he said.BOXSymbolic electionSharad Pawar described the upcoming election between NDA nominee Ramnath Kovind and Opposition nominee Meira Kumar as symbolic. He said the electoral arithmetic was in favour of the NDA candidate and the outcome was a forgone conclusion. But it is democracy and we need to fight the election, he added. Pawar also clarified that he was never interested in the post."

Dr. Ajit Navale, member of the committee, said, The scheme has an upper limit of Rs. 1.5 lakh. So if a farmer has an outstanding loan above it, he would not benefit from it. It is not in line with our demand of blanket loan waiver. A meeting will be held in Nashik on July 9 and the committee will launch a Sangharsh Yatra (protest campaign) against the government, which will end on July 23. Dr. Navale said, We will hold a State-wide agitation on July 26 as our demands have not been addressed by the government.Meanwhile, National Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar said on Sunday that the farm loan waiver announced by the Devendra Fadnavis-led Bharatiya Janata Party government was not wholly satisfactory. However, Mr. Pawar said his party would support the Maharashtra government and play a constructive role in providing relief to debt-ridden farmers.The Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Krishi Sanman Yojana will write off debt up to Rs. 1.5 lakh per farmer (from the previous ceiling of Rs. 1 lakh). The scheme is expected to benefit 89 lakh farmers: 40 lakh will become debt-free; the remaining 49 lakh will be provided relief. Mr. Pawar said, This is the governments first step towards alleviating debt-ridden farmers. It is too soon for us [the NCP] to say whether it is effective or not but the ground reality is that a section of farmer leaders are already dissatisfied with the governments proposals.The NCP chief said that the government had written off-debts up to Rs. 1.5 lakh for the period between April 1, 2012 and June 2016. It ought to have done so till June 2017, Mr. Pawar said.He said that the partys second and long-term demand would be to seek the implementation of the recommendations of the M.S. Swaminathan Committee to make agriculture viable and stable. Mr. Pawar said, It is high time the Centre seriously considers implementing it. The government was aware that there would be a record production of tur dal this year, yet it did not lift the ban on the export of pulses.Shiv Sena president Uddhav Thackeray during his tour in Nashik district said the loan waiver put forward by its coalition ally was unsatisfactory. He said, The farm loan waiver is historic, but it is not satisfactory.

He also requested Jaitley to increase the cap on the states open market borrowing by Rs15,000 crore, over and above the existing limit of Rs35,000 crore, putting the state government in a position to raise funds for the waiver.According to information, Jaitley asked Mungantiwar to deal with the RBI for the loans and staggered repayment.The state government will have to deal with the RBI for the loans at a lower rate and their deferred schedule of the repayment. With permission to borrow and additional Rs15,000 crore, we can manage to raise Rs34,000 crore, Mungantiwar told HT.The state plans to shift the old loans that have been borrowed at a high rate of interest of about 10.5% to 7.5% to save about Rs40,000 crore on its outstanding loan of Rs75,000 crore from open market borrowings. The state has also requested the Centre for the waiver of the pre-clousure charges on the payment of the outstanding loans.Mungantiwar also requested Jaitley to extend the permission to export onions by three months to ensure rates in the domestic market do not fall on the backdrop of the bumper crop. Maharashtra farmers have produced 2.05 lakh metric tonnes of onion and the production is 25% more than the average. Similar rise in the production in other parts of the country has resulted in the fall in procurement rate of onion. The extension to the export permission by three months will prove beneficial to farmers in getting good procurement rate. Jaitley has assured us to positively consider the demand, Muntantiwar said.Meanwhile, the state government on Wednesday began the procedure to waive off loans by issuing government resolution (GR) notifying the eligibility of the loan waiver. The notification stated farmers who have restructured their loans between April 1, 2012 and 2015-16 and have become defaulters till June 30, 2016 will be eligible for the waiver of up to Rs1.50 lakh per farmer. It has also clarified farmers seeking the benefit of a one-time settlement of their outstanding more than the waiver limit of Rs1.50 lakh, will have to first pay of the remaining amount to seek the benefit.It has reiterated that except Class-IV employees, the families of the government servants, legislators, ex legislators, corporators and the members of cooperative sugar factories, district cooperative banks, cooperative milk unions will not be eligible for the loan waiver. The government has defined the family of farmers as husband, wife and children below 18 years. This means the nuclear families of the farmers will be separately entitled for the waiver.Read more:Farm loan waiver: Maharashtra to seek Centres help to raise 34,022 crore from banksMaharashtra readies game plan for farm loan waiver"

(Source: Express photo by Partha Sarathi Biswas) Grape farmer Santosh Gorade at his vineyard in Niphad near Nashik, Maharashtra. (Source: Express photo by Partha Sarathi Biswas)Last kharif, the Nashik District Central Cooperative Bank (NDCCB) disbursed Rs 1,608.55 crore of crop loans during April-June, exceeding its target of Rs 1,257.18 crore. This season, however, it has given out a mere Rs 61.41 crore as on June 27, way below even a lower target of Rs 1,101.05 crore.NDCCB could be an extreme case of a beleaguered cooperative bank. But across Maharashtra, total kharif crop loan disbursements by DCCBs have been just Rs 5,707.42 crore from April to June 27 this year. That is barely 55 per cent of the Rs 10,451.77 crore lent out during April-June 2016.The above collapse of cooperative credit is an ongoing story of Maharashtras agriculture, at a time when waiver of past loans is whats grabbing the headlines. And its effects are being felt right now in the fields, as kharif agricultural operations gather pace with the state receiving 13 per cent above-normal monsoon rains so far.For Santosh Garade, between May and the month almost ending, there should have been at least four rounds of pruning (removal of thread-like tendrils growing from the main branches) at his four-acre vineyard. But this grape farmer from Takli village in Nashik districts Niphad taluka hasnt managed to do a single pruning  necessary for the crops proper flowering from September-October, followed by fruit development and harvesting towards February-March.The beleaguered Nashik District Central Cooperative Bank. (Source: Express photo by Partha Sarathi Biswas) The beleaguered Nashik District Central Cooperative Bank. (Source: Express photo by Partha Sarathi Biswas)My total investment requirement during May-July, for six rounds of pruning along with application of fertiliser, fungicide and micronutrients, is about Rs 50,000 per acre. I am unable to raise that working capital today from either NDCCB or Bank of Maharashtra. And I have no money of my own left, says Gorade.The 34-year-old suffered huge losses from his 2016-17 grape and onion crops grown on four acres and two acres, respectively. The 70-quintals average yield from onions, which fetched Rs 300 per quintal, did not cover his cultivation cost of Rs 35,000 per acre. Gorades vineyard, likewise, yielded 60 quintals of grapes per acre. At Rs 15/kg, there was no way his investment of Rs 2 lakh per acre could even be recovered, leave alone generate a return.The credit crunch that farmers like Gorade are experiencing  that too, in what looks to be a good monsoon year  comes even as the Maharashtra government has come out with a Rs 34,022-crore loan waiver scheme. The Devendra Fadnavis administrations decision to waive individual farm loans of up to Rs 1.5 lakh taken from cooperative and commercial banks  plus the direction given to extend Rs 10,000 in cash as an immediate advance  does not radically alter the picture.The loan waiver is of no use to me, as I have outstanding dues of Rs 4 lakh with the Bank of Maharashtra, notes Gorade. Nor does a Rs 10,000 cash loan help somebody growing a crop entailing much more investment than bajra (pearl millet) or soyabean. Gorade is, moreover, not eligible to receive this special loan, since the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is yet to give the nod for extending it to defaulting farmers.Gorade is planning to mortgage his tractor to obtain credit from private moneylenders. If I am a defaulter with Bank of Maharashtra and the NDCCB has no money to lend, what option does a farmer like me have? My immediate priority is to somehow ensure a decent grape crop and hope for better prices. In 2014-15 and 2015-16, I realised Rs 60-70 per kg, but both were drought years. Last years crop was good, but prices crashed, he adds.In the neighbouring village of Kotamgaon in Niphad, Sanjay More has mortgaged his wifes jewellery to borrow money for sowing soyabean and maize on his two acres. More has an outstanding loan of Rs 70,000 from the NDCCB. The Rs 1.5 lakh waiver should technically make him free from institutional debts. But the problem is that the NDCCB itself has no money to lend now. In the last two years, I have taken loans totalling Rs 1 lakh from moneylenders. I have had to knock at their doors this time as well. The loan waiver has no meaning for me, he points out. Like Gorade, Mores hopes are pinned on a good crop  and better prices.For most Maharashtra farmers, drying up of institutional finance for kharif farming operations is whats really hurting, even while political and media attention is on loan waivers. At the start of every crop season, farmers avail of short-term crop loans from commercial and cooperative banks. These are extended at a subsidised interest rate of 7 per cent interest, and go towards purchase of seed fertiliser and pesticides, and also paying for labour.For the current kharif season, Maharashtra has set a crop loan target of Rs 40,547.20 crore, of which Rs 24,985.01 crore is to come from commercial banks, Rs 13,108.38 crore from DCCBs and the balance Rs 2,453.82 crore from regional rural banks. The cooperatives are the ones that reach out to small and marginal farmers, with their average loan size being much less compared to that of scheduled commercial banks.The current credit crunch is largely about DCCBs  their inability to lend, particularly after demonetisation. Just three days after the November 8 decision to withdraw all existing Rs 500 and Rs 1000 denomination currency, these banks were barred by the RBI from both accepting and exchanging the outlawed notes. The official reason given was that they did not have fool-proof KYC (know-your-customer) verification systems in place, making them potential avenues for illicit cash deposits.As a result, the DCCBs in Maharashtra alone were saddled with Rs 4,311.79 crore of old notes deposited during the three days, which they couldnt exchange for new re-monetised currency. The NDCCB alone had Rs 342.60 crore of such notes. If we could neither exchange the old notes nor earn interest on those deposits, from where was the money to come for disbursal of fresh crop loans?, asks Narendra Darade, chairman of the bank. The DCCBs were further hit because of farmers not being able to repay loans following the price crash across crops  for which, too, Darade laid the blame on demonetisation. On June 20, the Union government finally announced that cooperative banks would be allowed to exchange the demonetised notes with the RBI. But the latter is yet to issue directions to DCCBs on the modalities of such exchange.The ultimate loser from all this has been the farmer, who suffered from low prices following demonetisation. Now, he is suffering from an unprecedented credit crunch even in a normal monsoon year.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

SIVA SARAVANANUnion Minister for Railways Suresh Prabhakar Prabhu on Sunday said that the three Dedicated Freight Corridors (DFC) planned by the Railways will provide logistics support for the Make in India campaign. One of the DFCs will have connectivity to the south aiding freight movement from southern States and two of the three DFCs will be completed in the next three years.The southern States will significantly benefit from the DFC. In a way, DFCs will completely criss-cross the country boosting freight movement. If Make in India has to succeed, we will have to develop a huge backbone of infrastructure for the logistics, said Mr. Prabhu at the launch of various passenger amenities for Coimbatore, Thudiyalur, Periyanaickenpalayam and Tirupur railway stations.Once DFC is a reality, it would reduce traffic on passenger train networks, increasing speed and inclusion of new services.Stating that income from freight was on a declining trend in the last two years, Mr. Prabhu said that freight rates will be reduced soon. Of the 10 products that are the mainstay of Railways income, two-third comes from the freight.According to the Minister, the Railways also plans to introduce services to benefit farmers. The Railways, with the support of Container Corporation of India, helped farmers transport onion from Maharashtra. He hinted Railways plans to start cold storage chains in stations to support farmers for transporting agriculture produces.Mr. Prabhu said that increasing the speed of trains will be a priority. As part of this, Rs. 18,000 core will be spent to increase speed of trains to 200 kmph on important lines such as Bombay-Delhi and Delhi-Kolkata. Increasing speed of services between Bengaluru and Chennai is also under consideration.Only 42 % of railway lines are currently electrified which will be doubled in the next five years. All meter gauges will be converted into broad gauges. Increasing speed, augmenting capacity and bringing in new avenues of growth are areas Railways currently working on, said Mr. Prabhu.The budget allocation for Tamil Nadu increased in the last three years. Now, Tamil Nadu is getting a share of 170 % more than what the State was getting three years ago. While the share was only Rs. 878 crore from 2009-10 to 2013-14, it has gone up to Rs. . 2,300 crore now. In a matter of three years, a change of Government at the Centre made the result, said Mr. Prabhu."

There is no definite cause for the increase, with middlemen at Vashi APMC blaming ambiguous causesfrom November's demonetisation to the farmers' strike in June as well as ""inclement weather"".Contrary to traders' claims there is no visible shortage either. Good quality, robust red tomatoes are available at all markets in Mumbai. Curiously, retail rates are rising even as wholesale rates continue to fall.APMC trader Shyam Yadav said, ""Wholesale rates rose to Rs 55-60 per kg over Friday-Saturday. On Monday, they dropped to Rs 36-40. Let us see what happens tomorrow.""Conversely, retail rates were Rs 35-40 per kg over Friday-Saturday, perhaps due to leftover stocks, which spiralled to Rs 60-80 Monday as retailers charged their pound of flesh. ""I bought half a kilo for Rs 30 to tide over the next two days. But how long can we continue like this?"" said Andheri resident Shaila Grover.Tomato is a household staple without which no meal is complete. Moreover, Shravan observances are set to begin on July 10 for north Indian communities and July 24 for Maharashtrians and Gujaratis. During this time families avoid onion and garlic and rely on tomato.One of the largest middlemen in the tomato trade at APMC Vashi, Javed Memon, cited a slew of reasons which seemed tough to swallow. ""This price increase is an outcome of notebandi. Recently there was also the farmers' strike in Maharashtra. Moreover, I am told the seeds have failed in south India. So this season we are relying on tomatoes from Maharashtra where a heat wave has beset certain growing areas. Also, remember that farmers have not been getting a good rate for their produce since the past year and a half. It is time they made some money.""Asked when customers would get relief, Memon said, ""Don't think of customers. Why think of customers alone, think of the farmer as well."" TOI asked if farmers were getting good rates at present. ""Well, not to their satisfaction. After all, the quality of their tomatoes is poor,"" the middleman said, adding prices would remain high till end-August.Mumbai receives its quota of tomato from cultivated areas in Karnataka, as well as Satara, Sangli and Narayangaon in Pune."

Prices may increase as demand rises.Prices of several other vegetables have touched Rs 100 per kg or are nearing that mark.Brinjal's price has crossed Rs 50 per kg. Prices of ladyfingers, cluster beans, and green beans have gone past the Rs 50 per kg threshold in the retail market.""Prices of vegetables are skyrocketing because of heavy rains in the city,"" said Deepak Patel, the secretary of the APMC. ""Whenever there is a long spell of rain in the state, prices increase.""He said that prices usually stabilize when water recedes from fields.He said that the state was banking on tomatoes from Maharashtra and the south because rain has washed away around 25% of crops. But steady demand was increasing prices, he said.Sources in the APMC said that the demand for the tomatoes will increase as the shravan month begins in a week for North Indians, and by the end of the month for Gujaratis and Maharashtrians. During shravan, people avoid onion and garlic and hence the demand for tomatoes and other vegetables shoots up.It is worth recalling that farmers in the state did not receive good prices for their produce earlier this year; they were forced to throw away the produce on the roads. However, Radheshyam Marwadi, a trader in Memnagar , said that prices are likely to dip later this month. But they will increase again in August and September."

The farmers have been seeking loan waiver and better prices for their crops.""The MEIS (Merchandise Exports from India Scheme) benefit for export of onions, fresh or chilled, is extended up to September 30 this year,"" the Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) said in a notification.Wholesale prices fell by an average of Rs 5.50 per kg at Lasalgaon (Maharashtra) in June, Asia's biggest onion market, during last month from an average of Rs 8.50 per kg in the year-ago period.Maharashtra is the top onion producer in the country.At present, the arrival of 2017-18 kharif (summer) onion is in full swing, not only in Maharashtra but also in other states like Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Gujarat.It may be noted that 20 per cent of the country's total onion output is grown during the kharif season.Since the kharif onion cannot be stored, farmers sell off the produce in domestic as well as overseas markets.The arrival of quality onions has boosted exports in the last few weeks.

In the first phase MahaFPC, the consortium of FPCs in Maharashtra, are planning to venture in the Azadpur mandi in Delhi to sell onions.The FPC movement in Maharashtra has seen much action over the last year or so. Working under the banner of MahaFPC, the FPCs had purchased more than 25,000 MT of tur last year. The FPCs had opened village-level purchase centres and had purchased the produce on behalf of the Small Farmers Agri business Consortium (SFAC).Yogesh Thorat, managing director of MahaFPC, had said that purchases by the MahaFPC had helped stabilise tur prices in the local wholesale markets.MahaFPCs move to enter traditional markets comes at a time when the state government is encouraging farmer and FPCs to explore alternate markets or to go for retail markets. Asked about their decision to go for the traditional wholesale markets, Thorat said it would be easier to be part of the wholesale chain rather than the retail markets. Onion, Thorat said, was a classic example of a produce from Maharashtra which fetches better returns in Delhi market than the local markets. We aim to directly sell the onions from Maharashtra in Delhis markets, bypassing the various intermediaries, he said.In the first phase, Thorat said, MahaFPC will be concentrating on onions and slowly venture into other fresh fruits and vegetables. On an average, the Azadpur market sees the arrival of around 100-115 trucks of onions and in the next two years, we aim to corner at least 20 per cent of the arrival, he said. The wholesale trade in Azadpur and other places is mostly controlled by traders who purchase produce mostly in Maharashtra.The ground level procurement, sorting and grading will be done by the FPCs, while MahaFPC will act as facility coordinator. A Nashik-based FPC will be venturing into the trade of onion with Thorat hoping to start the process by the end of this month. We are hopeful that we will get the grant from the state government for the same, he said.For all the latest Pune News, download Indian Express App"

A scene from the Ernakulam market on Tuesday.Thulasi KakkatThere seems to be no respite to the common man as vegetable prices in the district continue to remain largely high, with tomato, onion and carrot being especially costly.At the Ernakulam market, small onion was sold at a wholesale price of Rs. 90 per kg and a retail price of Rs. 100 whereas tomato and carrot were sold at Rs. 52 and Rs. 60 and Rs. 55 and Rs. 60 respectively. Prices were even higher in some other markets.On an average, vegetable prices continue to be 20 per higher than what it was a month ago, though prices of some vegetables have dropped slightly, said K.K. Ashraf, vice-president, Ernakulam Market Stall Owners Association.Price of shallotsThe only relief seems to be the declining trend in the price of shallots after touching a high of Rs. 130 recently, though the ruling retail price of Rs. 100 per kg is a far cry from Rs. 65 in April. Mr. Ashraf expressed the hope that a further softening of onion prices would come about with production catching up in Tamil Nadu, the main supplier to Kerala.However, tomato and carrot prices continued to hold firm with the previous low of Rs. 20 per kg appearing to be from a distant past. Green chilli has also turned a lot spicier with the price soaring to Rs. 60 per kg from Rs. 35.The shortage of tomatoes in North India drove traders from there to the markets in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, which in turn, took a toll on the supply to Kerala. The strike by farmers in Maharashtra didnt help either, Mr. Ashraf said.In the meantime, the Vegetable and Fruit Promotion Council Keralam (VFPCK) which aims at ensuring fair prices for farmers, was on a high over what it claimed consistently good returns for farmers. Farmers continue to auction their crops through 22 farmer markets in the district.Data collected from the wholesale markets in Aluva, Ernakulam and Perumbavoor on a daily basis by the market information centre of the VFPRCK were handed over to farmers to be used as the base price in auctioning their produce.This ensured that farmers got a price, which was even better than the market price, a senior VFPCK official said.Asked whether better price for farmers automatically resulted in higher prices for consumers, the official said that it was beyond the mandate of the VFPCK and had to be addressed by the government through market intervention measures."

Hailing from the US, my Indian food experience was limited by both ignorance of the various dishes, and price point. Indian food in the U.S. is priced relatively high and often altered to better suit our bland-preferring palates. Adding to that was my general anxiety in asking what exactly an item such as palak paneer is.To celebrate my introduction to the local cuisine, a colleague took me on a mini-food tour. On our way to the first stop of the day, a vendor on a bicycle pulled up beside us with a rusty metal pot sitting on his back seat. She called him over and asked me if I wanted to try some. Inside the pot was a whitish fluid sloshing around, with no protection from the old pot. I asked what it was, and she responded with a word I fail to recollect. A sip of the drink and I got a slight cucumber taste. Its a drink made from curd, she said. I immediately gave the rest of the drink to her.We arrived at Murugan Idli Shop, Besant Nagar in time for lunch. Employees were still placing seats at tables in the far room, so we sat by the front window. Two sheets of banana leaf were placed on our table. Then the food came.A server ladled three globs of chutney onto our leaf, followed by two idli cakes  one plain and one covered in what I would discover to be a red spicy powder surely taken from the center of an active volcano. My colleague also ordered sweet pongal  essentially a kind of rice pudding  to help comfort my buring taste buds. The different chutneys  orange, white and brown  added a savoury, slightly spicy flavor that also helped mask the red powder. The idli itself was surprisingly soft and paired well with the chutney. The meal ended with a hefty serving of onion dosa, which I would describe as a sort of onion flapjack, but Ive never been a fan of onion dishes.Hours later, the two of us stopped at GSS Restaurant for some dinner. I was once again unaware of what exactly she would order. The first dish placed on our table contained what I would describe as six egg-shaped bread pouches filled with potato and onion, and two small bowls of broth. This, I was told, was pani puri. I immediately made the connection between the dish and soup dumplings, a Chinese delicacy which contains soup.On my first attempt to eat the pani puri, the shell cracked and spilled soup down my face. My second attempt was better, and the food was simple but delicious. Afterwards, we were served pav bhaji, a fast food dish originating from Maharashtra, India. The dish had vegetable curry served with two bread rolls still stuck to each other, and a side bowl filled with carrots and onion slices. It was as simple a dish as they come, but once again delicious without the overwhelming spices Id encountered multiple times already.Since then, Ive branched out and tried new dishes, from the simpler aloo methi to Indian Subway (the main takeaway where nearly every sandwich is spicy). Ive tasted the sour drink restaurants call buttermilk, despite the major difference with the substance I knew back home.Most likely my favorite discovery so far is the childrens drink, rose milk. When I read that item on a menu, my first question was why anyone would make a drink out of roses, or how you would even milk a rose. I was shocked to find that rose milk is actually surprisingly sweet and tastes very similar to strawberry milk. Lets just say if you want to get to know me better, lets have a chat over a cup of rose."

There has been no permanent mechanism of MSP in the state.Apart from loan waiver, farmers organisations have been demanding passage of a farmers security Act and implementation of the recommendations of the MS Swaminathan Commission.People who are supporting farmers demands will gather at Gandhi Circle in Jaipur on Sunday and observe a one-day fast, Jat said. Farmers will wear black bands to show solidarity.RSS-affiliated Bharatiya Kisan Sangh (BKS) had started a mahapadao (sit-in) on June 15, but called off the agitation on June 19 after holding talks with the state government.That government assured BKS that a law would be brought in to make buying of farmers produce below MSP a punishable offence. A committee will study the laws in Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat. Electronic weighing machines, the government said, will be installed in all mandis in six months.The government did not give any assurance on farm loan waiver. Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Punjab have waived farmers loans.Holding talks with BKS representatives and assurances given to them was an eyewash, Jat said, adding that 26 associations would support the July 9 protest.Last month, farmers restricted milk, grain and vegetable supply in several districts of Rajasthan after the Kisan Mahapanchayat called a bandh to support the farmers agitation in Madhya Pradesh. Meetings were held to condole the deaths of farmers killed in police firing in Mandsaur in MP.."

A man on horseback stands guard, watching from a distance. Deer that destroy crops is just one more headache for the farmers of Puntamba, a village that played a major role in mobilising the recent farmers strike in Maharashtra, when tillers decided to let their produce perish rather than sell them at a loss.Puntambas other problem has been delinquent rains. If it does not rain for another eight to 10 days, our present crop will be in trouble, says Balasaheb Chavan, a local farmer.Mr. Chavan points to a third problem: erratic power supply. For the most part, their fields get power only at night. But it is neither easy nor safe to work in the fields in the dark. There are snakes around our village. Working in the dead of the night is not easy, he says.Parallel workWith agriculture proving a loss-making proposition, Mr. Chavan says that villagers keep their households running through parallel work. The better off try their hands at small businesses. The poorer ones become blue-collar workers.Another farmer, Vilas Dhanaute, says he has just returned from the market after selling 9.5 quintals of his onion produce. He produces a slip to show that he only got a rate of Rs. 2 per kg.He explains the math. I spent Rs. 600 on transporting the onions to the market, Rs. 450 on labour, and Rs. 900 on the sacks required. Just taking the onions to the market cost me about Rs. 1,950. I earned Rs. 200 on each of the 9.5 quintals I sold, or Rs. 1,900 for the whole lot, he says. Over all, I ended up making a loss of Rs. 50.Asked why sell at all if they suffer a loss, Mr. Dhanaute says, What do we do with these quintals of produce then? We cant let them rot in our village. He points to a large tent-like storage structure next to the fields, where much of his onions still lies. He says he would have to sell them all in the coming days, but is doing it a few quintals at a time in the hope that prices rise.In early June, farmers from this village, located 15 km from Shirdi, decided not to sell their produce. This set in motion a strike that spread across Maharashtra.Farmers in the village, however, seem resigned to a bleak future for farming."

Despite huge production of onion in the state, consumers continue to get it at a rate of Rs 10 to 20 per kg in the market.Owing to big mismanagement in storage of onions, several hundred tonnes of bulbs has already been buried across the state after it started making lives of people miserable due to its bad smell. Dumping the rotten onions itself requires huge efforts on the part of the government. Black decomposed onion bulbs could be seen littered along 6 kms stretch of a highway on Chattarpur-Jhansi road.Officials requisitioned trucks to remove them from the roadside. This year 32 lakh metric tonnes of onion production took place in the state. With just about 10% capacity to store the produce in the state, the government spent more than Rs 600 crore in purchasing the onion from farmers.Government sources said there is no estimate of how much onion purchased from farmers has been destroyed.Amidst all this, a 50-kg sack of onion was sold in Bhopal mandi on Monday at a price of Rs 300 to Rs 400, depending upon the quality. The bigger bulbs and those pink in colour fetch a better price. Abdool Raqib, president of the wholesalers association of onion and potatoes, said: "" After flooding the mandis a few days back, onions have disappeared now as major quantity of the commodity has been exhausted from the local markets and has been transported outside the state. Those who have the capacity to hold it back, are likely to sell it at premium rates in the coming months. The effect will be felt by the month-end"".Wholesalers from Maharashtra Delhi and even from Kolkatta purchased onions from Madhya Pradesh at a rate of Rs 2 a kg and transported it to bigger cities. Besides, the government started diverting the onion to district headquarters by trains and trucksto be sold at fair price shops. In the meantime, onions began to rot at two places  mandis where the farmers unloaded them for a price of Rs 8 a kg and then at railway stations where it was dumped due to lack of proper transportion, government sources said.In Manasa village of Dhar district, mountains of onion were formed when hundreds of dumpers started bringing the produce, only to be destroyed for want of storage. Additional district magistrate of Dhar DK Nagendra told TOI,""We have buried 15,000 to 18,000 metric tonnes of onion. About 100 metric tonne is still stored and some of it may also be destroyed. The district administration has a target of selling 1200 metric tonnes from fair price shops"", he said. More than 600 kms away from Dhar, mounds of onion could be seen littered all along the stretch of highways. Before dumping more than 18,000 quintal of onion in trenches created by digging of murram (red clay) on Naugaon-Harpalpur road, the onion was littered on the roadside, Mangailal Yadav , a resident of Kukrel village said. After the villagers complained of foul smell, it was buried. For some days, students of Khushipura primary school stopped attending classes because of the stench of decaying onion bulbs. Latto Prasad Shriwas, headmaster of a primary school, had complained after which the onion was removed. BB Gangale, sub divisional magistrate at Naugaon, said: "" About 18000 quintal was dumped in the mine area. This was the same onion that was lying at Harpalpur railway station creating trouble to passengers. Five special trains loaded with onion had dumped the produce at Chhatrpur's Harpalpur railway station""."

(Above and three-column image below) Pictures show the Sardar wholesale agricultural market, in Surat, Gujarat.R.V. MoorthyR_V_MoorthyIt is past noon and the Sardar wholesale agricultural market in Surat is bustling with activity. Trucks drive in every minute and so do lorries smaller in size. Farmers arrive in these with loads of agricultural produce to sell. The place has multiple rows of platforms interspersed with streets and parking spots. Each platform is dedicated to different kinds of produce: onion, fruits, vegetables, etc. Things move with clockwork precision. Daily-wage labourers offload the sacks of farm produce from trucks, dumping them in huge heaps on the floor of the platforms. A different set of merchants buys this grain and transports it from here, to be sold in towns nearby. The merchants registered here who act as conduits for the sale take a 6% commission on the produce sold. The rest goes to the farmer, and is delivered in cash on the second or fourth day.This correspondent  who accompanied the ongoing yatra of farmers organisations from Madhya Pradesh to Delhi through parts of Maharashtra and Gujarat  took a detour to talk to people at this wholesale market to make sense of agricultural marketing operations.Ebb and flow of pricesThe place is a market seeing daily fluctuations of prices, based on demand and supply. If a greater quantity of a crop comes to the market on a given day and fewer merchants land up to buy it, the price falls. If more merchants come and there is dearth of a commodity, the price rises. Farmers benefit from a higher price and return disappointed if the prices are low. The prices fluctuate even within a day. To sell for a good price is like being lucky in a draw of lots.Rakesh Bhambre and Sunil Sonone, who have driven down in a rented truck from Daswel village of the Baglan taluka in Nashik district of Maharashtra, have had a hectic day. They arrived here at 2 a.m. Through the morning, they have sold their onions, which were harvested in April, and have managed to get a price of Rs. 6-7 per kg, which is not bad. They will now head back to their village in a bit. The merchant will send them the money for their produce in cash two days from now, which another truck coming from their village will deliver to them.The two Nashik farmers say they engage only in farming and have no side work to do. Their annual calendar is hectic. In June/July and October, they sow sugar cane, which requires a lot of water and takes close to nine months to be ready. This year isnt a good one for sugar cane, they fear, as it isnt raining yet. They sow onion in August and also in November. They have brought the harvest of their November crop of onion here, they say. The advantage with onion is that it can also be stored for four-five months.They also sow tomato in June and July, and the crop takes two months to be ready.The agricultural process requires a variety of expenses. They need to buy seeds, fertilisers, pesticides and machines on hire for harvesting. They have to pay the bills for power consumed while watering their fields. They also need to hire labour for various operations, from preparing the fields, taking care of the crop to loading the produce on to trucks. Labour charges range from Rs. 70-100 a day.These expenses  varying for different crops  are facilitated both by the money they get by selling their previous produce in the market and by borrowing from cooperative banks, nationalised banks and regional rural banks at an interest of around 7%. Sometimes, they have to borrow from private merchants too, at a higher rate of interest on a monthly basis. Most farmers are under debt of a few lakhs, and sometimes borrow from one lender to pay another. A good crop and remunerative prices  a matter of chance  can lead to better incomes. A slump in prices of a crop or erratic monsoon can lead to loss.The variegated world of farmersThis year, farmers in Nimaad region of Madhya Pradesh and in adjoining parts of Maharashtra  like Nashik and Ahmednagar  are still awaiting rains. If it does not rain for another week, they say, their crops will be damaged. Villages, of course, have farmers of varying means. The richer ones have more land  perhaps 20 acres  and can try three or four kinds of crops in their fields. If one fails, they believe the other will not. The smaller farmers find it harder to get by.The truck in which Bhambre and Sonone brought their produce to Surat has been hired from a bigger farmer of their village, who owns trucks and hires them out.These two farmers  each owning 7-8 acres of land  however spend the year in farming, both with their family labour and hired daily wagers. The poorest in villages own no land of their own, and work on the fields of others.The wealthier farmers have also diversified into related occupations and other businesses as an additional cushion, as farming is not very lucrative and yields and prices are unpredictable. The poorest in the agricultural world either work others fields or do additional work as rickshaw pullers, construction workers, etc., sometimes becoming poor migrants. Hours before reaching the Surat market, this correspondent visited Koribhartna village near Surat, where daily wagers were working the fields of a richer farmer where okra was being grown. Dinesh, a daily-wage labourer of the village with no land of his own, said he works through the year at a daily wage of Rs. 100. He gets one or the other agricultural work through the year, he says, but adds that the money he earns is not enough for maintaining his family well.Pandane village in Nashik district is situated close to a dam from where it gets what villagers complain is sand-laced water. Pradip Shivaji Chitte, whose joint family has 7.5-acres of land, of which he works on just 2.5, has opened a small shop dealing in seeds, fertilisers and pesticides. He rented this shop two months ago in a bid to diversify beyond farming. I invested Rs. 1 lakh in this; some of my friends also contributed, he says. But till now, I am just being able to break even. Chitte says he is under Rs. 16-lakh debt and practises grape farming in the village. In our village, half the farming is grape farming; the rest is of all other crops, he says.Just preparing the fields for the crops entails a labour charge of Rs. 20,000 per acre, he claims. The fields are prepared from September and the harvest comes only by January, before which the crop requires a lot of care. The total expense, including labour, fertilisers and pesticides, comes to Rs. 1.6-1.7 lakh per acre. The selling of the produce begins from January and it sells at about Rs. 18-25 per kg. If one subtracts the expense borne from the selling price per acre, the profit is Rs. 45,000-50,000. This is the annual income for growing grapes per acre. Chitte says bigger farmers aiming at exports prepare their fields a month earlier  they also get higher prices when they sell their produce, he adds.Farmers in the Nimaad region of Madhya Pradesh also grow hybrid crops like Bt cotton.The same is the case in neighbouring districts of Maharashtra like Nashik. Jagdish Patidar, who came to Barwani for a day from Maheshwar in Madhya Pradesh to take part in the ongoing rally of farmers organisations, says he too grows Bt cotton, which requires more supply of water and higher input costs. What they look for is higher prices for their produce.Bt cotton costs more but is high yield and therefore more lucrative for farmers. When a new variety that is advertised as high yield comes, farmers will take to it for profits, says Lakhwinder Singh, an agriculture expert at Punjabi University, Patiala. Many farmers also took to it as it was advertised as resistant to bollworm, a pest that affected cotton. However, Singh cautions, the pest resistance is only for three-four years.Agitations and farmers yatraThe ongoing farmers agitations are demanding state support for making farming more lucrative. They demand that the M.S. Swaminathan Committees recommendation  that the government-announced minimum support price (MSP) should be 1.5-times the cost of production  be implemented. They are also demanding farm loan waiver, as many farmers are under large debt. However, a loan waiver does not ease the burden of loans taken from private parties.Till July 14, a Kisan Mukti Yatra involving several farmers organisations has been moving through Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Gujarat and Rajasthan, addressing villagers and articulating these demands. The participants argue that while input costs for farming have been rising, the rise in MSP has been sluggish.Swaraj Abhiyan leader and academic Yogendra Yadav, Narmada Bachao Andolan leader Medha Patkar, Maharashtra farmer leader Raju Shetti, the All India Kisan Sabha, Kisan Sangharsh Morcha, Bhartiya Kisan Union of Punjab, and other organisations are taking part in the yatra, which will converge on Jantar Mantar in Delhi on July 18. It began in Madhya Pradesh, with the farmers leaders being detained for a few hours by the police, and passed through Indore, Barwani  visiting village Barda, which is in the submergence zone of the Sardar Sarovar dam  Nashik, Vyara and Surat in Gujarat, Bhilwara and Jaipur in Rajasthan, among other places. There are regular halts to interact with people, with crowds varying from a few hundred to a few thousand turning up.The yatra comes close on the heels of the deaths of six farmers in police action in Mandsaur, Madhya Pradesh, and a strike by Maharashtra farmers early in June, when they decided to let their farm produce and milk perish but not sell it in the absence of lucrative prices. The strike was broken in 48 hours after talks with the Maharashtra government, which made a few announcements: loan waivers for small and debt-ridden farmers; a Bill to criminalise buying produce at rates below the MSP; the setting up of a State Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices on the lines of the Centre to look into MSP issues. The State government also offered to subsidise farmers power bills, hike milk prices and set up cold storage chains for preserving the produce.Making farming sustainableThe journey shows one thing  that farming, which sustains more than half of Indias population even if many of them also do other things on the side for supplementary income, is not a lucrative proposition. Farmlands have become smaller over generations and, except for large farmers, many do not find it rewarding but find themselves ill-trained for other occupations, says Patidar, the farmer from Maheshwar. Farmers, however, do have an emotional attachment to farming.Their fortunes depend on many things: rains, prevailing prices, and how indebted they become. Lakhwinder Singh says that the answer to the agrarian unease is either subsidies on input costs or higher prices. He says farmers need to spend not just on farming but also on services like education and health. Unless their expenses go down or incomes go up, discontent is expected, he adds. Everything from health and education to seeds that were public services once are private services now. Farmers get into this loop of rising costs of living, he explains.In Punjab, the government purchases all wheat and rice crops at the MSP. This, being scientifically calculated, can enable farmers to have some incomes that make agriculture meaningful. But the same procurement guarantee applies neither to all crops nor to all States, which makes farming less lucrative as an occupation, says Lakhwinder Singh.Farmers in Madhya Pradesh say that government procurement centres are opened late, often a month and a half after a crop is ready. But farmers cannot store it all in their fields near their homes. They try to sell their crop soon after harvest to merchants, and often get prices below the MSP. If government centres were to start as soon as the harvest came, we would get better prices, says Patidar.The troubles dont end here. Patidar says not all the produce is bought by these centres; it may be rejected on grounds of quality. Suraj, a young farmer from Naraula village in Barwani district, says that there is much paperwork in these centres to ascertain the quantity of land on which the crop was sown, the yield, and to verify that the produce indeed belongs to the farmer who brought it.Unless there is a procurement guarantee and the farmer can count on the government to purchase his produce, the MSP has little meaning on the ground, says former Maharashtra State Planning Commission member and economist H.M. Desarda. Lakhwinder Singh adds that if the government undertakes to purchase all major crops at the MSP, farmers will be better off.But will this not push prices of farm produce bought by consumers upward? Lakhwinder Singh disagrees. He says the large number of middlemen in the supply chain do not anyway let vegetable and grain prices reflect the prices at which farmers are selling them. The long-term answer to farmers indebtedness, he adds, is a rise in their incomes.It may become a heated debate politically, but an answer to non-remunerative farming may take longer to come.Unless there is a procurement guarantee and the farmer can count on the government to purchase his produce, the MSP has little meaning on the ground,H.M.

Gomathi of Periyar Nagar in Erode. Dependence on non-vegetarian food has increased in the past one month from weekly once to thrice. We have to work on cost cutting measures for a balanced budget, she says.From tomatoes and small onions to even the fresh greens, prices of most vegetables are up across the region. It is the result of a combination of factors, say farmers, traders, and officials. Failure of monsoon last year and demonetisation had an impact on sowing, they say.Dharmapuri, Salem, Namakkal, Coimbatore and the Nilgiris are among the main horticulture crop growing centres in the State.Over 3,500 hectares are under tomato crop in the blocks of Mecheri, Kaadayampatti, Omalur, Pethanayakkanpalayam, Attur in Salem district. Small onion is raised in more than 4,000 hectares in Namakkal district and about 700 hectares in the Kolathur, Vazhappadi and Gangavalli blocks in Salem district.Repeated failure of monsoon resulted in standing crops withering in many parts, leading to fall in the arrival in the uzhavar santhais and open markets, say officials in Salem and Namakkal.Three kg of tomato was priced at Rs. 10 in May and now it is Rs. 60 - Rs. 64 a kg. During the peak season period, the uzhavar santhais used to receive about seven tonnes of tomatoes every day. Currently, about five tonnes of tomatoes reach the market.Following the commencement of small onion harvesting season in Salem District, there has been reasonable increase in the arrival of onion stock from the villages. The price of small onion which stood at more than Rs. 100 per kg last month, has come down. The price of good quality small onion stood at Rs. 84 and the second quality onion at Rs. 80 at the Salem Uzhavar Santhai on Sunday. The prices of tomatoes and small onions are expected to stabilise in the Salem wholesale markets once arrivals start from the nearby cultivation pockets.The shortage of rainfall and demonetisation seem to have played into the cropping area in Dharmapuri and Krishnagiri districts. Bathalahalli is the largest wholesale market that attracts traders from across the State and sends vegetables to Kerala too. The general fall in production of vegetables in Thally, Denkanikottai, Hosur and Rayakottai  whose farmers are the largest suppliers of cabbage, tomatoes, beans, carrots, beets, is one of the reasons for the price rise. The supply has fallen, but the demand has increased, say traders.President of Traders Association of Bathalahalli market Raja Reddy says the number of trucks loading vegetables is between 80 to 100 tonne on any day and it has remained almost the same, subject to availability of vegetables. The price of most vegetables range from Rs. 50 to Rs. 60 per kg. Beans has been going at Rs. 50 per kg for the last 6 months, he says. This year, tomato cultivation fell significantly. Its price at the market is Rs. 70 per kg, he adds. Normally, June- August witness a rise in tomato prices largely coinciding with the fall in the vegetables production in other growing regions of Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh.The 70-day crop was hit right when demonetisation came. Farmers, who were already mid-way into the crop and awaiting harvest, were hit. To cut down on costs, the area of cultivation was also reduced, says a Rayakottai-based farmer.In the Nilgiris, though the prices of vegetables such as potatoes and tomatoes remains extremely high, English vegetables such as broccoli, carrots, beans and beetroot, which are produced in large quantities in the Nilgiris, have not seen a steep hike in prices.According to Raja Mohammed, a wholesale vegetable supplier, the wholesale rate of broccoli currently is Rs. 130 per kg., while carrots are sold for anywhere between Rs. 35-40 per kg. depending on the quality and freshness of the produce. Beetroot is also selling for between Rs. 28 to Rs. 35 per kg., which is the usual price that these vegetables are sold for during this season.The price of English vegetables increase only during the wedding season, when they are purchased in large quantities for feasts, he says. Though the prices of vegetables such as tomatoes and potatoes are still high, there has not been a major demand for cheaper alternatives, said other vegetable sellers in the Ooty Municipal Market.(With inputs from Syed Muthahar Saqaf in Salem, P.V.

The programme is funded by the State Government with support from the Centres Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana (National Agriculture Development Scheme).AVRDC, a wing of the World Vegetable Centre, has given a new alternative to the farmers of the State by promoting onion production during the wet summer or kharif season, a practice that was never considered possible because of waterlogging problems, said sources in the Horticulture department.The programme is guided by Arshad Ahmad Pal, post-harvest specialist and Principal Investigator in the World Vegetable Centre's South Asia regional office in Telengana.Piloted in the six districts in 2016, the programme was a big success with the farmers getting a yield of about 17 tonnes per hectare (ha) compared to 12 tonnes during rabi season, the sources said.The farmers are now keen on expanding kharif onion production, the sources said adding, the government is contemplating to roll out the programme to other districts after successful completion of the project next year.Onions are grown in winter season in the State and farmers sell their crop right after the harvest due to lack of storage facility.

There has been no MEP for the past 19 months. ""The Centre is keeping a close watch on onion prices in wholesale markets,"" a government source told TOI.Members of the Lasalgaon Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) have attributed the price spurt to short supply on account of a lull in harvest. ""Harvest of fresh kharif crop will begin only in mid-October. Currently, the onions arriving in the market are from old stocks. This is the crop harvested in March and April,"" said an APMC official. Lasalgaon in Nashik is the country's biggest wholesale onion market.The official said the district's farmers, who are in financial trouble, preferred to store onions in the hope of getting better prices. He said that, in June, Lasalgaon received between 22,000 and 30,000 quintals of onions per day.Over the past two weeks, the supply is 12,000-20,000 quintals. ""This indicates that farmers have already sold the onions they had stored and they may have limited stocks now.

Lack of carriage has hit supply, and in turn, the cost,"" said Arvind, a wholesale vegetable dealer of Dubagga.""Also, because of monsoon, the transportation time has increased from three to five days, which turns onions stale. More than 30% of them are discarded because of poor quality,"" said Sheraz Sadiq, another vendor.With seasonal vegetables already selling at a relatively high price because of heavy rains in the producing states, the overall cost of raw vegetables has sky-rocketed in the city.Housewife Shruti Singh said, ""Because of vegetables getting costlier, especially onions and tomatoes , the cost of each meal has gone up. Cooking chicken is cheaper than preparing a vegetarian dinner. Worst part is that though vegetables can be replaced by meat, there is no substitute for onions.""Bank employee Ritika Sharma said she has resorted to buying vegetables from wholesale market even though she has to buy a week's quota in advance. ""Shopping from mandi costs a little less than from street vendors, so I go to Dubagga mandi and buy whatever I want all at once,"" she said.Though the cost of tomato has dropped in wholesale markets in the past few days, it continues to sell at Rs 100-120 per kg in the city. ""For the past three days, tomatoes are selling at Rs 60-65 per kg in the wholesale market. Price dropped because supply is getting back to normal,"" said Rizwan, wholesale trader."

The price was hovering around Rs 10 a week ago. In fact, the price started increasing in the last five days. It touched Rs 19 per kg in the wholesale market and crossed Rs 22 in the retail market. Market analysts say the prices will hit Rs 25-27 by this weekend.""Onion that was sold for Rs 9-12 per kg in the wholesale market five days ago saw a steep rise on Sunday.

As Kurnool farmers cultivate the crop from August till November, the yield is supposed to arrive either in November-end or December. The wholesale market of Jnanapuram in the city imports 10 lorries every day of 40 tonnes each. Around 400 tonnes of onions are imported from Maharashtra this season alone and another 10 loads every week by Anakapalli traders, sources said.With the farmers in Maharashtra staging protests demanding the government for loan waiver, traders started stocking up huge quantities of onions which led to shortfall in supplies.A trader at Anakapalli S Seetharam said: ""We don't have any proper facility to store onions in huge quantity. The government should focus on this urgently.""On condition of anonymity, one of the farmers in MVP Raitu Bazaar who has been bringing onions from the wholesale market, said that they have been getting third grade onions and selling it for Rs 12 now. The entire market has been getting 20 bags. He says there will not be any respite for the prices till the end of November as the yield of various crops would come in next two to three months and Karthika masam would also see the prices soar.Thankfully, in a respite to consumers, tomato prices which touched Rs 100 in the retail markets due to insufficient yield till July 26, have now come down to Rs. 55.Not only onions, the prices of brinjal, cucumber, drumsticks, capsicum, beans, and others have also gone up in five days. One of the wholesale vendors in the Jnanapuram market K Nayudu attributes this to lack of yield."

The Maitree stores will sell the vegetable without keeping profit, Principal Secretary, Food Supplies and Consumer Welfare Department, Pradipta Mohapatra told this paper.After a meeting with representatives of the Mahasangh (Federation of All Odisha Traders Associations) at the State Secretariat, Mohapatra attributed the sudden price rise of onion to rising cost of the vegetable at source.Odisha being a consuming state largely depends on Nashik in Maharashtra, a major onion market of the country, to meet its requirement of the edible bulb. Rise in the price of the vegetable from `8-a-kg to `15 in source market has its cascading effect on the consuming states, said Mahasangha general secretary Shakti Samanta Mishra.Holding Madhya Pradesh government responsible for the spurt in the prices in major onion mandis of Maharashtra, Mishra said large scale procurement of onion from farmers and damage of the vegetable due to poor storage facility has further accentuated the crisis.Though the country had bumper rabi harvest of onion, large scale damage of kharif crop and traders meeting their export commitments had its effect on the domestic market, Mishra added.He, however, said there is no disruption in the supply of onion to the State which is receiving 1,600 to 2,500 tonnes daily. There has been a fall in supply from Kurnool in Andhra Pradesh due to rains. The average requirement of onion in the city is about 200 to 250 tonnes.We have agreed to the State Government proposal for supplying onion to the fair price shops in the Twin City of Cuttack and Bhubaneswar in the first phase. If the situation persists, the vegetable will be supplied to other Maitree shops in rest of the districts at wholesale price, he added.The wholesale price of onion at Aiginia mandi is about `16-18-a-kg. The ideal price of the vegetable in retail markets of the city is `20 to `22-a-kg, Mishra said."

India consumes almost 90 per cent of the home-grown produce, but 10 per cent export is necessary to prevent a price crash.Onion exports from India have recorded a 10-year high in 2016-17, with the country recording export of 34.92 lakh tonnes (lt) of the bulb. The Central governments decision to provide repeated extension to the export subsidy and zero minimum export price (MEP) of the produce has fuelled the exports in the last year or so. Exports of onions play a crucial role in balancing the domestic price of the produce in the wholesale markets. India consumes almost 90 per cent of the home-grown produce, but 10 per cent export is necessary to prevent a price crash. Exports had virtually stopped in 2014 due to the Central governments decision to increase the minimum export price (MEP) in view of the steep increase in onion prices. Due to a glut in the prices of the bulb in 2015, the Central government had again reduced the MEP to zero (0) in December 2015. Also, the Central government had announced a 5 per cent export subsidy for onions to clear the glut in produce.Since 2015, the exports of onions have seen a steady rise and at the end of the financial year 2016-17, 34.92 lt of the bulb was exported out of the country. This was almost three times the exports of the previous year when 11.14 lt of onions was sent to foreign shores. On an average, around 10 lt of onions are exported from the country every year. The United Arab Emirates (UAE), Sri Lanka, Singapore, Malayasia and Russia are major export destinations for Indian onion.Jagdish Apshunde, an exporter from Nashik, said the governments subsidy and the zero MEP has helped increase the export of the bulb. In June, the central government extended the subsidy for three more months to help clear the glut in the domestic markets. Exports, however, had failed to do much to improve the domestic price of onions which has been trading between Rs 5-6 per kg at most of the wholesale markets in the state.Over the last two weeks, prices of onions have seen a spike, with the Lasalgoan market recording an average price of Rs 12 per kg. This price rise, Apshunde said, was temporary and will remain till the Kharif crop arrives early September. Market sources pointed out that the price rise was due to stockists wading in the market in anticipation of a shortage in the future. Agriculture analyst Deepak Chavan said the rise in price is due to fundamental market forces. The outlook for the arrival of Kharif crop  the crop which is to arrive in September  is bleak. Onions from Karnataka start arriving by the end of August and there is a 40 per cent dip in the sowing area there, he said. The dip in sowing, Chavan said, was due to farmers going for other crops due to low prices of onions. While Maharashtra has reported near normal sowing of 10,000 hectares, prices, according to Chavan, would be bullish in the face of a dip in arrival of onionthis year.For all the latest Pune News, download Indian Express App"

The price has shot up to Rs. 26 a kg in the wholesale market here over the past one week.Wholesale traders at the Gandhi Market, which caters to retail traders in several neighbouring districts, attributed the hike to the sharp fall in arrivals from Maharashtra and also due to heavy rainfall in Gujarat and Rajasthan.The retail price of the onion is higher by at least Rs. 5 a kg. Just about a week back, it was being sold at Rs. 13 a kg in the wholesale market.Wholesale traders say that the market was getting about 10 truck loads of Bellary onions from Maharashtra, accounting for just about 200 tonnes a day.

Thangaraj, General Secretary, Tiruchi Onion Commission Mandi Traders Association.Mr. Thangaraj said that the arrivals had come down over the past 10 days.

5a00cc4d9855b76bf13a48ee,Address it fast,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/626785/address-fast.html,2017-08-06,"Address it fastSudhirendar Sharma, Aug 8 2017, 9:26 ISTFrom being thrown on the streets in Mandsaur to being protected by the police in Mumbai in the past few weeks, tomato has turned out to be the truly red-faced farm commodity in last few weeks.Tomato has joined onion and pulses as the latest victim of price fluctuations that has left farmers and consumers fuming. While farmers were forced to sell tomato at less than Rs 5 per kg, consumers are compelled to buy it at Rs 100 per kg.Price distortions of farm commodities are a continuing phenomenon, as farmers lack control over pricing their own produce. More shocking is the fact that at the receiving end are 30% of rural households who cultivate 82% of arable land in the country.With most landholdings being less than one hectare, the capacity of small holders to bear loss on their produce is anything but suicidal. One farmer suicide every 40 minutes in the country reflects a systemic failure.The crisis amplifies when a previous year high price for a particular crop entices farmers to expand cultivation of the said crop in the following year. Farmers in Andhra Pradesh were shocked when tomatoes fetched Rs 551 per quintal in June this year compared to Rs 3,015 per quintal during the same month last year.Neither was there a drop in consumption of tomatoes nor was there an unexpected glut in the market. And, yet price plummeted like never before. Despite fertilisers and power subsidies, cost of cultivation has been on the increase each year. With farmers not making profit on their small produce (on an average farmers keep 25% produce for home consumption), about 52% of agricultural households are in debt.Average household debt is Rs 47,000. This is unlikely to change as annual income of median farmers is merely Rs 20,000 or just Rs 1,666 per month as per Economic Survey of 2016. That the middlemen and traders are milking large share of the profit is no breaking news. Shocking is the fact that in addition to farmers and consumers bearing the brunt, the state too is at the receiving end of price distortions.Having purchased 8.76 lakh tonnes of onion at a support price of Rs 8 per kg during last five weeks, the Madhya Pradesh State Cooperative Marketing Federation is now forced to sell the same at Rs 2 per kg via the public distribution system.Price distortions have caught the government by surprise too. To avoid onion stocks from rotting over, the Madhya Pradesh State Civil Supplies Corporation could fetch only Rs 2-3 per kg in the open market.One reason for the glut in onion had to do with the Federation purchasing it at a high price which encouraged the farmers from Maharashtra and Gujarat to unload their produce in Madhya Pradesh. However, the cumulative loss to the exchequer in this transaction alone is worth Rs 900 crore.What is true for tomato and onion is equally true for other commodities including pulses. Having stocked two million tonnes of pulses during last two years, crash in market price of pulses has left the National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation (Nafed) high and dry.All this lends credence to the argument that farmers get no more than 25% of the price that consumers pay, and the minimum support price in the best of circumstances benefits only 6% farmers.Under such conditions, does the governments stated objective of doubling farmers income by 2022 hold any ground? Far from taking the price distortion issue head on, the Niti Aayog instead contends that without additional income from non-farm sources, farmers will not be able to cross income of Rs 18,000 per month even after the doubling efforts.The condition demands a mix of soft and hard options to pull farmers out from the current distress. The soft options include liberalisation of contract farming, direct purchase by processors and bulk buyers, direct sale by farmers to end users etc.The hard options include shifting of the workforce to non-agricultural occupations, an inclusion of supplementary sources of income, modernisation of farming and marketing practices, reforms in land lease and better price realisation.It is clear that none of the options proposed by the Niti Aayog can rid agriculture from prevailing price distortions. If farmers are not assured of remunerative prices for their produce, their interest in farming will wane further.Allow exportsA recent World Bank supported study on Price Distortions in Indian Agriculture by the Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations (ICRIER) suggests a ban on export bans on agriculture commodities to help farmers.The report draws reference to lost opportunity on account of export restrictions on wheat during 2007-2011 subsequent to the lifting of the trade ban wheat exports had touched a high of $5 billion in 2012.The question that begs an answer is whether or not exports directly benefit farmers? Exports do contribute to overall agriculture economics, but do not constitute direct benefit to farmers who are often at the mercy of the unending chain of middlemen.Since farmers income is unlikely to be doubled under the business-as-usual scenario, farmers would need direct cash incentives, in addition to input subsidies, to stay in the business of farming.Improving input efficiency (fertiliser and water) will help farmers make choice of crops to be grown. Crop advisories based on price trends of last few years, transit storage facilities at cluster level, and promotion of cooperative farming can enhance bargaining power of farmers.(Sharma writes on development issues)"

The retailer adviced a dejected Das that it's not too late either as onion prices are likely to go up further.Heavy rain in Nashik and the delayed supply from Karnataka, the country's two major onion baskets, have resulted in a spike in prices. Contributing further to this supply crunch has been panic buying, with consumers stocking up on the crop. Onion prices in the city have either doubled or risen by 60-80% from Rs 18-20 a kg just two weeks ago. In some markets in the city and its fringes, prices have more than doubled, with onions selling for Rs 45-50 a kg.""We mainly depend on the supply from Karnataka at this time of the year. They start sending onions from the first week of July and it continues till September. We need around 2 lakh tonnes for the state but we didn't get any from this southern state still now.

If we don't get it within a week, the problem will be acute,"" a senior agricultural marketing department official said.In 2014, when some onion-producing states like Maharshtra, Andhra Pradesh and Rajasthan threatened to stop supply of onion, Bengal had started cultivating the crop.

We now mainly look for onions from them in October, November and December. We could have fallen back on them on an emergency basis but because of incessant rain and flood in some parts of Maharshtra, the supply has been affected,"" the official added.""Onion prices have risen to Rs 40 in our market.

Heavy rain has made transportation of onions from Nashik almost impossible, they said.

It had said that the sellers should not charge more than Re 1 above the purchase price. ""There has been crop failure in Madhya Pradesh, while the crop has not been harvested in Andhra Pradesh. So it is not just Odisha, the entire country is depending on Maharashra at the moment. This crisis is not specific to Odisha. The entire country is facing the problem. At some places, onion is selling at Rs 35 a kg,"" said Patro. The minisyer said the purchase price at the source point was now between Rs 26,000 and Rs 27,000 a quintal. ""After taking the transport cost into account, the selling price in Odisha comes to around Rs 30 per kg,"" he said, adding that he had asked his department officials to sell onion at the government outlets at a price not above Rs 30 a kg. The rise in onion prices following the soaring price of tomato has hit the consumers hard. Last week, tomato was selling at between Rs 80 and Rs 100 a kg in the retail market. ""We have no role to play in the rise in onion price. The price of onion has increased at the source points,"" said secretary of Odisha Byabasayee Mahasangha Sudhakar Panda. Traders apprehend that the current high prices would continue till November. ""The winter crop from Nashik will reach the state in November. Besides, onions grown in various parts of the state will also enter the market in the winter and only then will the price stabilise,"" said Panda. Both farmers and traders said the state was suffering because of the lack of adequate cold storages. The state had witnessed distress sale of onions in March. However, the state government had attributed distress sale to over-production."

The tuber, which was sold at `14 a kg a month back, now costs `30.Even as the State Government fixed the upper limit of onion at `17 a kg last week and opened Maitri shops (model fair price outlets) to sell it across the State to unburden the consumers, the retailers flout the order with impunity reportedly for lack of enforcement.General secretary of Odisha Byabasayee Mahasangha Sudhakar Panda said, they are unable to supply onion at `16 a kg to Maitri shops as the supply price soared by `8 to `10. The price may escalate further due to scanty supply from the source States, he said.Odisha largely depends on Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh for onions. The supply came down drastically as the crop was ruined in Andhra due to lack of rain during kharif season and onions worth around `100 crore was damaged in floods in MP last month.Now, we completely depend on Nashik where the onion was priced at `2,500 to `2,600 per quintal on Tuesday. What can we do if the product is high priced at the source? We are managing since we had booked the commodity at less price a fortnight back, Panda said.Though Odisha, which consumes around 1500 tonne onion daily, stands second in the country after Maharashtra in area under onion cultivation, the productivity of the crop is very less compared to other major onion producing States.Panda said Odisha produces nearly 1.2 lakh tonne onion every year. But, it fails to utilise it within the State as a major share is diverted to Raipur. He, however, claimed that the price here is less compared to other States where the edible tuber is being sold at more than `40 a kg.Both the State Government and the Centre have to intervene to check the price rise. The Centre has to hold talks with vested interest traders in Nashik to regulate the onion price, he added."

Rain that wreaked havoc in Gujarat and Maharashtra has affected the supply to the city, traders said.Onions were priced at Rs. 40/kg in retail market on Wednesday and this may further go up, note traders.The Koyambedu wholesale market receives only half of the normal onion loads of 65 trucks daily. The city mainly receives its stock from Maharashtra and Gujarat apart from Karnataka.With the floods damaging crops in those States, less than half of the produce is reaching the city. Moreover, stocks from Karnataka are also being diverted to other places in north India like Delhi and Mumbai where the demand is high, traders said.Onions are priced up to Rs. 35 per kg in the wholesale market due to the increasing shortage, said P.Sukumar, joint secretary, Koyambedu Vegetables, Fruits and Flowers Merchants Association. Cabbage, a vegetable that is usually cheap, has become dearer as truck loads are being diverted to north India.Price of tomatoes downThough cost of tomatoes is steadily dipping, it still remains out of reach for many consumers and is priced up to Rs. 68 per kg in retail stores. S. Chandran, a wholesale merchant, said the market has started getting fresh supply of tomatoes from Hosur belt and this has brought down the price. But, we may have to wait till December for the onions to cost less as produce from Andhra Pradesh may arrive only then. Cost of onions may even go up to Rs. 60 a kg in retail market, he said.The supply scenario at Koyambedu wholesale complex is significant as several small markets in Chennai and other places such as Tindivanam, Cuddalore and Vandavasi depend on this wholesale hub for their supply. The sudden surge in prices of vegetables and off-season for weddings have also contributed to dull sales in the market. It may one or two months for sales to pick up, traders said."
5a0f0ba39855b76bf13d5760,‘Onion shortage for 15 more days’,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170812/jsp/odisha/story_166872.jsp,2017-08-12,"Caption There is a hue and cry over shortage of onions in the market. What is your department doing to address the issue? The states requirement of onion per annum is 5.5 lakh tonnes. We produce onion in only four districts  Nuapada, Balangir, Kalahandi and a part of Nabarangpur. We also produce some onion at Puruna Cuttack, which is located between Boudh and Phulbani. Despite all our efforts, the production of onion remains 1.5 lakh tonne per annum. We cannot preserve it for a long time. We have already exhausted our stock. To meet the shortfall of 4.5 lakh tonnes, we have to depend on Nashik in Maharashtra, Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh and also on Madhya Pradesh. But the damage to crops following floods in Maharashtra, onion produced in the interior parts of the state could not come. To check farmer suicides, the Maharashtra government started procuring onion at a higher price. So, only a few options are left for our traders to procure onion at a lower and competitive price. Sometimes our traders have had to buy onion at Rs 24 to Rs 26 a kg. I asked the traders and my department officials to sell onion with a profit margin of just Re 1, which will meet the transportation and preservation costs. How long will the shortage persist? It may take another 15 days. One cant store onion, as it is a perishable commodity. So there can be no hoarding. I have already sent a message to everybody that the government would take strong action if they do any mischief. Now, the businessmen have started cooperating with the department. Is it not an irony that despite the fact that we do not produce sufficient onion, our farmers had to resort to distress sale? Yes, there was distress sale. This was due to the fact that onion from neighbouring Madhya Pradesh where it was selling for Rs 2 per kg flooded our markets. The traders from Madhya Pradesh also asked our farmers to sell the onion at that price. However, we intervened and brought the onion price to Rs 7 per kg. But we cannot preserve it for long. Why dont you implement the Market Intervention System to rescue farmers? For market intervention, there has to be a consensus between the Centre and the state government as the price will be shared in the ratio of 50:50. We have already announced MIS for mung and biri dal. Two days ago, I told the officials that groundnut should be purchased at Rs 42.20 per kg. In the case of onion, they did not agree. Onion cultivation is not confined to Odisha but spread over many states. The governments failure to build a chain of cold storage may be one of the factors that has led to the distress sale... That is a wrong notion. We have nearly 42 cold stores in the private sector across the state. Besides, we have nearly seven cold stores around the capital city. A number of cold storages are there in Berhampur, my hometown. We have 24 cold stores in a bad condition. When the proposal came to me for their repair, I strongly suggested that these units be privatised. Let the private party undertake repairs and do business. The business cannot be run by the government. Every year, we face distress sale of various agricultural produce. How can this problem be solved? Everything is related to demand and supply. If suddenly there is excess supply, the prices will plummet and it becomes difficult to arrest it. Thats the time the government needs to intervene. We are doing so now. In the case of paddy, we have decided whatever the quantity of rice produced in our state, we will procure it from the farmers. Last year, we procured 56 lakh metric tonnes of rice. I have asked the primary agriculture societies to purchase paddy from the sharecroppers. What will you do with so much of surplus rice? Under the food security programme, we are giving 5 kg of rice per head. We will use up 30 lakh metric tonnes of rice under the programme. The rest of the rice will be procured by the Food Corporation of India. We also export rice to Punjab, Haryana, Jharkhand, Bihar and Karnataka. We are the third largest producer of rice in the country. You are part of a ministerial committee that discussed the issue of sharecroppers being given certain rights vis-a-vis the landowners. When will committees report be ready? Nearly 90 per cent landowners give their land to sharecroppers for farming. There is a fear among landowners that if they declare that they are leasing out land for cultivation purpose, their land will be taken away. Keeping this concern in mind, we are now emphasising on real cultivators. But as the issue is a controversial one, we have to secure the interest of the sharecroppers as well as farmers. It will take some more time to resolve the issue. You have staged a came back to the ministry. Earlier, a section of leaders from Ganjam claimed that they had lobbied for your inclusion in the government. Its the prerogative of the chief minister to pick up people for inclusion in the ministry. He also decides who he will use for party work and other purposes. When I was not in the ministry, he had used my services extensively in west Odisha and other parts of the state for the partys work. I never felt for a moment that I was out of favour with Naveen babu. Later, he brought me back to the ministry. Lobbying does not work. BJP national president Amit Shah launched his party programme Mo Booth Sabuthu Majboot (My booth is the strongest) from Ganjam. Your party must have been worried. BJP is a national party and it has formed the government at the Centre. The party has also formed governments in a number of states. Now, they are facing anti-incumbency in Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and other states. They have already lost Punjab and managed to form government in Goa. They are in alliance in Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and some other parts of the country. They are making efforts to enter newer areas. Now, they have set eyes on Odisha, Bengal and some other states. They are making all-out efforts to strengthen their organisational base. But, they will not be successful in Odisha as long as Naveen babu is here. But the anti-establishment factor also works against the BJD. No. We are taking up need-based programmes for development of the people. Naveens image is imprinted in the minds of people. Earlier, you equated Naveen babu as lord Krishna who drives the chariot (state) and Pyari Mohan Mohapatra as Arjun, who shoots the arrows. After Pyari Mohan, who is the Arjun now in the party? After the Mahabharat war was over all the Pandavas started claiming that they had defeated the Kauravas. But one Belalasena said he had seen only a wheel chopping off heads. Similarly, here Naveen babu is Krishna and there is no need for Arjuna as this war is different from the Mahabharat battle. What is the major challenge for the party in 2019? The Congress is almost a spent force. The space vacated by it is now being filled up by the BJP. Many Congress leaders are joining the BJP in the hope of getting a ticket. They are also spreading their network. Despite BJP emerging as a challenge, they will be no match for Naveen babus image and our programmes for the people. What do you consider more important: loyalty to the party leader (Naveen Patnaik) or efficiency at work? Both loyalty and hard work are required to be successful."

The hike in onion prices is burning a gaping hole in the pockets of middle class, which is forcing many to cut down consumption of onion. Prices in the wholesale and retail markets have more than doubled in just one week and are expected to increase more in the coming days.Onion prices in the city are ruling anywhere between `40 and `50 per kilo on Friday, as against `10 to `15 per kilo last week. Rythu Bazaars are selling them for `28 per kilo.Last time it was tomatoes and now it is onions, both are essential ingredients. With the rise in the prices we are forced to increase our monthly vegetable budget, Y Sujatha Reddy, a homemaker from Mehdipatnam, said. As per the data maintained by onion wholesale market in Malakpet, the city has a supply of nearly 12,000 bags ie 6,000 quintals per day. And the sudden increase in the prices can be attributed to low production and supply from Maharashtra and other neighbouring states.Almost 90 per cent supply comes from Maharashtra and 10 per cent from erstwhile Mahbubnagar district and some parts of Kurnool in Andhra Pradesh, said J Ananthaiah, selection grade officer at Malakpet wholesale market.And if wholesalers are to be believed, big traders in Maharashtra are deliberately holding up the stock for weeks in cold storage, which is resulting in the huge hike. To get more profit, traders are holding the stock and creating an artificial scarcity.Actually, compared to past years, production of onion is very high in Maharashtra this year, said a wholesale dealer in Malakpet. Meanwhile, prices of tomatoes have come down drastically compared to last few months. On Friday, tomatoes were being sold at between `43 and `50 per kilo as against `90 per kilo in July."

The Kurnool Agricultural Marketyard supplies onions to Vijayawada, Chittoor and other parts of the State and one of the reasons being cited by traders in different parts of the State for the rising prices is supply shortage from Kurnool. But the ground situation in the Kurnool Agricultural Market Yard is different.Officials and wholesale merchants Express spoke to said there were enough stocks in the marketyard to meet the demand and blamed retail stores, traders and middlemen for the sudden spurt in prices. The wholesale price of onion in the marketyard was `2,020 per quintal on Saturday. In other words it is about `20.20 a kg. However, retailers are cashing in on the demand to make a killing. They have hiked the prices so as to double their margin of profit.We have sufficient arrivals. The rates here in the market are decreasing at the moment compared to last week. Last week, the price was `3,300 per quintal and today, it is `2,020. What the retailers are doing is defaming the market, Katta Sekhar, one of the directors of the marketyard committee and an onion trader himself, told Express.He clarified that there was no possibility of a hike in prices at the Kurnool marketyard in the near future. These are all speculations. An average of 30 trucks come here everyday. It is true that the weather has destroyed nearly 50 per cent of the crop, but that has not affected the market drastically in anyway, he explained, accusing the retailers of creating an artificial shortage.The marketyard secretary G Sivaramakrishna Sastry said that on Saturday alone, as many as 360 tonnes of onions arrived in the market. As per the directions of state government, the Kurnool marketyard exported 20 tonnes to Vijayawada and 10 to Chittoor. Nearly 20 lorries of onion load are sent to Odisha, West Bengal and other states from here regularly. Even now, the exports to other states are continuing from the Kurnool marketyard. According to official records, onion crop was sown in 9,000 hectares in the district this time. The district produces nearly 14 lakh quintals of onions.However, there are vendors who offer a different take. A wholesale vegetable vendor Hanumantharao Chowdary said that in the past few days, onion has entered the race of cash crops. Onion prices hit the roof due to rains as the crop has been damaged. Anticipating the trend to continue, retailers may resort to hoarding and create a crisis situation, resulting in the demand going up and, subsequently, the prices, he explained. Chowdary felt that if the government restricts exports to other states it may help in curbing the artificial shortage. Current wholesale price is `20.20 a kg, whereas in retail it is `35 to `40.Prices touch Rs 30 in ChittoorTirupati: For the last one week, onion prices have been going up. On Saturday, onions were selling between H24 and H32 kg depending on the quality. In the district headquarters of Chittoor, the price has shot up to H30 a kg.In Tirupati also the price touched H30 mark. Merchants in Madanapalli, Chittor, Tirupati, Srikalahasthi and Pileru, who have contacts with suppliers in other stats, are getting the stocks without much difficulty. At least there is no scarcity as of now in the district. Assistant Director Marketing K Indumathi said that there is no problem in getting onions."

He added that by the end of this month, Kurnool stock will come and prices will come down.The consumers are worried that the prices will rise in next few days. Onion shops at rythu bazar experienced huge rush on Saturday. However, the rythu bazar officials are giving only three kilos per head.

The exorbitant prices are forcing them to cut down the consumption of onions.Jyothi Kshatriya, a homemaker, said: No matter what the price is, we will buy onions as it is a significant ingredient in any recipe. But, the prices will certainly affect the quantity. The consumers believe that the traders are deliberately holding up the stock to create artificial scarcity, despite there was good production in Maharashtra.No stock boards at Nellore rythu bazarsNellore:Onion prices are soaring in Nellore too just as in other parts of the State. What is causing concern among the consumers is the rate at which the price is spiking. It has almost doubled in the last couple of days. If the price hovered around R20-R25 a kg a few days back, it is now hovering around R40 a kg.Onions were being sold for Rs 40 per kg at retail shops for the last two days. We have reduced the usage of onions in our day-to-day cooking. We purchased a little quantity only for specific dishes, says N Ramadevi, a resident of Ramesh Reddy Nagar. Consumers like her are pointing accusing fingers at onion traders, alleging that the latter have been hoarding onions in huge quantities to create artificial scarcity.

The situation is almost the same in both wholesale and retail. The best quality of onions, which was available at about Rs14-Rs15 per kg in retail markets of the city's posh areas, has now touched the Rs50 mark. However, in certain markets like Vastrapur and Vejalpur, onion was available at Rs40, which was still three times higher than its prices a fortnight ago.Explaining the shortage of onions, officials said that against the requirement of about 8-10 truckloads of onions each day, the city was getting only one or two truckloads. Each truck carries about 10 tonnes of onions.Officials said that the prices of onion at the end of July was around Rs6 to Rs7 per kg in the wholesale market, and it has increased to Rs27.50 per kg. Interestingly during the same period last year, the prices of onions ranged between Rs6 to Rs8 per kg.Deepak Patel, secretary of APMC , Ahmedabad, said, ""Last year, many farmers in Maharashtra and even Gujarat did not get adequate prices against their onion crops, and hence they didn't go for onion farming this year. This has led to a shortage of the vegetable.""Patel said it was difficult to make any prediction about the next season, but prices will most likely continue to rise. ""In Shravan, people refrain from using garlic and onion in Gujarat, but once Shravan is over, there will be a spike in demand accompanied by increase in prices,"" Patel said, adding, ""We expect onion prices to stabilize by last week of October or the first week of November, when the new crop arrives.""An office-bearer of APMC, Ahmedabad said that it was not just onion prices, but all vegetable prices have increased. Brinjals, according to quality, cost between Rs40 and Rs100 per kg in wholesale. At this time last year, tomatoes cost about one-fifth of what they cost now. Officials said vegetables in the retail market usually cost double or more than those in the wholesale market.APMC officials said that a good sign was that in the last couple of days prices had stabilized to a certain extent. Tomato, which had crossed the Rs80 mark was now down to Rs50 in the wholesale market, and has plateaued out, hopefully."

5a0f51649855b76bf13d7e3f,are vegetable prices soaring?,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/are-vegetable-prices-soaring/article19527329.ece,2017-08-20,"What happened in July?July saw a rise in inflation at the wholesale level to 1.88% from 0.9% in June, with the spiralling tomato prices, along with other food items, contributing significantly to this rise. Tomatoes saw a sharp inflation of over 209.5% in July against contraction of 29.4% in June, according to data from the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy. Brinjal registered a rise in inflation to 21.1% in July, from Junes contraction of 3.1%. The prices of tomato, onion and potato have increased in recent months owing to disparity between demand and supply on account of a drop in production because of unfavourable weather, a rise in transport costs, seasonality and supply chain constraints.Why is supply low?While the rise in the retail prices of tomato is being associated with low supply from key growing States, including Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh and Karnataka following heavy rain in a few regions that damaged the crop and hindered transport as well, onion prices have seen a rise on account of low supply from the southern States.The fluctuation in vegetable prices, which is commonly referred to as seasonal, is associated with the economics of demand and supply. The Centre maintains that seasonal fluctuations in market arrivals have hit supplies. The other reasons for the fall in supply are adverse weather conditions and imperfections in marketing channels. However, the clash of interests between the consumer, the producer and the middlemen is a key factor that policy-makers must urgently address.Where is the problem?For years, the consumer, the producer (farmer) and the middleman have had a clash of interest when it comes to agricultural commodities. While the consumer wants to buy a commodity at the lowest price, the producer (farmer) desires to sell the produce at the maximum price. The middleman, on the other hand, wants to maximise profits. Striking a balance among these stakeholders could possibly address the issue of price fluctuation to some extent. Vegetable producers, especially small landholders, depend on intermediaries to sell their produce. As vegetables find their way to the market, the cost of packaging, grading, transporting and fees, besides the margins of the middlemen, are some of the elements that determine the final price the consumer has to bear.Will better storage help?Agricultural commodities with a short shelf-life are prone to price fluctuation and hence require better infrastructure for marketing.Economists like Prof. M.S. Sidhu at Punjab Agricultural University believe that improved transport and upgraded storage infrastructure will keep a check on price volatility. Indias cold storage capacity at present is nearly 3.5 crore tonnes, which is short by 30-40 lakh tonnes, and it needs to be increased. Besides, cold storages need to be upgraded, equipping them to store fruit and vegetables at right temperatures so that they stay fresh.Also, the high cost of transport needs to be addressed. In the case of perishable vegetables, the government could consider promoting low-cost refrigerated trucks and weigh the option of freight subsidy.According to an estimate, there are 7,000-8,000 refrigerated trucks plying in India, mostly transporting pharmaceuticals and dairy products. Transport of perishable vegetables in refrigerated trucks could be one of the options that would help in better supply and availability of the produce.What about the supply chain?The mismanagement in the supply chain is another reason for the huge gap in prices that growers sell perishable agricultural commodities for and what the consumer pays. Creation of co-operative groups and societies are probably an alternative that could assist in minimising the marketing channel. They can work in tandem across the States and supply vegetables from surplus regions to places where the produce is in demand.Most farmers in India have small landholdings. Nearly 85% farmers are small, who have less than 2 hectares. Cultivation has become unviable for these small farmers, but through cooperative groups and societies even a small quantity of crop produced by the farmer can be marketed. This will stabilise prices and benefit consumers.VIKAS VASUDEVA"

Onion prices have seen almost 100 per cent rise in past couple of weeks. Alarmed over the situation, Centre has directed the States to take proper measures including imposing stock limits to control the price surge.Prices of Onion which used to sell at Rs 20 Rs Kg or even at lesser rates have surged to Rs Rs 40 KG and more in Delhi and other cities across the country.Wholesale traders in Delhi claimed that the reason is due to a shortfall in supplies from Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh.

On the contrary, many states like Rajasthan and Gujarat witness excess rain leading to damage of crops, said Surender Goyal, a trader in Azadpur wholesale market in the national capital.Traders claimed currently supply is mainly from Maharashtra.There might be possibility of hoarding or profiteering by the traders in Maharashtra leading to the surge in price. Supply in Delhi and other parts have come down and it will remain low in coming weeks due to heavy rain in Maharashtra these days, added Goyal.Officials of the Consumer Affairs ministry said that hoardings cant be ruled out at this stage to make a profit out of the current situation.Seeing this, states have been told to keep watch on such elements and take proper action accordingly. They can also impose stock limit to avoid hoardings, said an official.Meanwhile, the traders claimed that the situation will remain similar for some days as the new crop will start arriving from September onwards.Supply will start improving only after mid-September and till then price will remain in the range of Rs 30-40 a kg, said another trader.Onion price risePrices of Onion which used to sell at Rs 20 Rs Kg or even at lesser rates have surged to Rs Rs 40 KG and more in Delhi and other cities across the country.Supply has come down due to bad weather in many parts of the country.States have been told to keep watch on hoardings and take proper action accordingly.

The truck owner was trying to change a flat tyre when the ill fated state transport corporation bus rammed into it. Around 20 passengers sustained severe injuries in the accident.Widening of Nashik-Pune Highway into a four-lane road is incomplete near Narayangaon, which might have lead to the accident, local sources said.While speaking at a function at Pune on Sunday Union transport minister Niton Gadkari had blamed the officials from his own department for causing delays in highway repairs.The accident at Narayangaon was the second accident within hours of Gadkari's public admonition of the officials. Earlier in the day another MSRTC bus had rammed into a truck near Shindewadi on Pune-Satara highway.

The Centre will extend all help to those willing entrepreneurs towards establishing and expanding food processing industries that will provide value addition to the varied agriculture produce in the country, Union Minister for Food Processing Industries Harsimrat Kaur Badal said.Inaugurating a common food processing incubation centre for shallots at Chettikulam in Perambalur district through video conferencing from New Delhi, Ms. Badal pointed out that the facility got up under the joint auspices of the Indian Institute of Food Processing Technology (IIFPT) and the State Government would now help shallot growers avoid loss due to price variations and post harvest damages.Stating that the new facility would go a long way in helping farmers realise Prime Minister Narendra Modis dream of doubling the per capita agricultural income by 2022, Ms. Badal said that shallot growers suffered a lot due to climate, economic and market conditions in the absence of positive solutions to address their grouse. What is grown on the fields must fetch the farmers a profitable return. This facility will now show the way for onion growers not just in Tamil Nadu but also to those in Maharashtra and elsewhere in the country to get the benefits of proper value addition, she insisted.Stressing that agricultural produce must be supplemented with value addition, the Union Minister said that farmers must not just remain producers but should move ahead to become food processors and that would increase their income manifold. The Ministry of Food Processing Industries was extending all help to such agri entrepreneurs and investors through the flagship Scheme for Agro-Marine Processing and Development of Agro Processing Clusters (SAMPADA) that rains a host of benefits including sizeable subsidies, Ms. Badal underlined.In particular, she invited the farmer producer companies and food processing entrepreneurs to participate in the upcoming World Food India fair in New Delhi between November 3 and 5 where a world of opportunities awaited them.Perambalur District Collector V. Santha observed that shallots were grown on over 8,000 hectares and the production levels touched 70,000 tonnes. Stakeholders would stand to gain in times of glut when they could have a stable return while they could also benefit from the value added products they could generate through the technology dissemination by the Common Facilitation Centre.IIFPT Director C. Anandharamakrishnan said four value added shallots products were available through the centre for the farmers group to produce. The peeled onion, onion flakes, onion powder and onion paste were poised to get the farmers remarkable returns in the international and domestic markets. The IIFPT has developed onion peeler, stem and root cutter and solar assisted curing cum storage unit especially for the Chettikulam Centre. The measures would help extending the shelf life of peeled onion and other products to get better returns to the producer group, he said.Head, Department of Technology Dissemination, IIFPT, A. Amudhasurabi explained the salient features of the centre and sketched the development initiatives of the IIFPT for the benefit of farmers."

A week ago, the tuber was being sold at `20 to `22 a kg.The essential commodity is going beyond the reach of consumers after witnessing a downward trend for nearly a month due to crackdown on hoarders. Its price has increased at least 60 per cent in the last few days. Traders, however, attributed the price rise to ongoing strike by truckers and rain in producing States like Karnataka and Maharashtra.General secretary of Byabasayee Mahasangha Sudhakar Panda said the wholesale price of onion has risen from `1800 to `2800 per quintal. As there is a huge gap between the demand and supply, the retial price is bound to increase, he said.Panda informed that Odisha is not getting the commodity from Nashik, Bengaluru and Tadepalligudem (Andhra Pradesh) as per demand. While untimely rain damaged the crop in Karnataka, Nashik region was hit by flood.Strike by truck operators demanding inclusion of GST on diesel also compounded the problem. The crisis will continue till the arrival of new crop in November first week, Panda added.Meanwhile, the State Government has warned the traders not to go for hoarding. Food and Consumer Welfare Minister Surya Narayan Patro said the officials have been asked to keep a close watch on hoarders and black-marketers."

The increase in onion price at the wholesale market in Nashik, Maharashtra, has apparently led to the hike in price here.The wholesale price of onion has jumped to `3,500 per quintal. It is being sold at a rate of `40 per kg in the city as 10 per cent of the total 50 kg onions in a gunny bag often get damaged, a retailer, Harihar Barik, said. Three weeks back, onion was available for `20 per kg. Later, the price kept increasing by `4 to `5 every 4 to 5 days till it doubled, sources said.The price wouldnt turn moderate for one month, till the new onions hit the market. Even as the price has shot up, Rourkela city administration is yet to take any step towards moderating the hike.The Food Supplies and Consumer Welfare (FS&CW) department sent instructions on Thursday evening to monitor the situation. The officials will start verification of stocks with local wholesalers from Friday onwards, Rourkela-based Assistant Civil Supplies Officer (ACSO) and Market Intelligence Officer R C Tudu said. The ACSO, however, attributed the rise in onion price to hike in wholesale price at the source point in Nashik. There is no shortage of onion supply, Tudu added.Meanwhile, locals have cut down on their onion consumption. I have stopped using onions for all the dishes cooked in my home due to the price hike, said Sangeeta Singh, a housewife.Earlier, the onion price had touched `28 per kg towards the end of July. The city administration had swung into action in the first week of August and sold onions at no-profit-no-loss basis at 37 fair price shops across Rourkela Municipal Corporation (RMC) limits and captive township of Rourkela Steel Plant (RSP).The citys daily requirement for onion is about 130 quintals. It has four to five big wholesalers and about six mid-size wholesalers, who, along with a dozen traders of Birmitrapur, Sundargarh, Rajgangpur, Lahunipara and Bisra across Sundargarh district procure bulk quantities of onion from Nasik."

(Representational Image) Traders said the shortage of supply was likely to continue till the first month of the next year. (Representational Image)AS THE price of onions witnessed a steep hike in retail markets across the city this week, traders attributed it to a shortage of supply of the vegetable to the Pune Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee (APMC). In one week, the prices have risen from Rs 20 per kilogram to Rs 38 and 40. As per the traders, the price of the commodity is expected to remain high for at least a month, as the supply to the market has dried up. This, the traders said, was because the ongoing showers were creating issues in harvest of the kharif crops.Vilas Bhujbal, a trader at Market Yard, said, The markets should have received kharif crops by now but because of the ongoing showers theres difficulty in harvesting the crops. The stocks from Rabi crops have already dried up. Hence, the supply to the market is going down with every passing day. He added that the price of onions in wholesale market at Pune APMC range from Rs 2,000 to 2,200 per quintal this week. If this continues, the retail rates may even touch Rs 50 by the end of this month, he said.Traders said the shortage of supply was likely to continue till the first month of the next year. Damage of the onion crop is not restricted to Maharashtra, a similar situation is prevailing in neighbouring Karnataka, they added. Changdeo Holkar, former director of the National Agriculture Marketing co-operative Federation, said, In some of the districts, as much as 60 per cent crop has been damaged due to untimely rainfall. Farmers whose crops survived may get a great return this time. That is, if the government doesnt intervene.For all the latest Pune News, download Indian Express App"
5a14d10a9855b76bf13e82ef,A plate of goodness,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/a-plate-of-goodness/article19874354.ece,2017-10-17,"Food is an integral and essential part of all our celebrations in life. Be it child birth, marriage, festival or death, a set of special dishes are served in a thali. Over the years, it has become an essential part of every occasion. The salivary glands know the usual suspects and start working beforehand. But with changing demographies and increasing demand to consume cuisines of different cultures, thali is losing its purity and original charm. An element of shock and awe has crept into the ritual.Now Chef Kunal Kapur is rediscovering these traditional thalis through Utsav: Thalis of India on Living Foodz channel. Thali is unique to Indian cuisines and is found nowhere in the world. The bigger purpose of serving a thali is to have a complete nutritious and wholesome meal including vegetables, lentils, dry and gravy dishes. It is aesthetic and pleasing because of the play of colours and textures, says Kapur during a conversation in Delhi. Excerpts:What prompted you to take this journey?It is about discovering people, culture, food and beliefs through thalis. Usually they are associated with taglines like Punjabi or Gujarati, vegetarian or non-vegetarian with the word unlimited added to them. That is not what is being explored. What we are discovering are thalis, typically done in various communities, on special occasions and festivals like Holi, Deepavali It endeavours to explain what goes into making a thali and why only certain dishes make the cut .What would be special for Deepavali?On Deepavali, a typical baniya thali will serve lots of sweets  five to six varieties like ghiye ki burfi, pista ki lauj and a number of snacks like chaat, samosas, kachoris. In the main menu, dals and mooli ke kofte are served. The number of sweets in the thali reflect the social status of the family.A Punjabi thali on Deepavali will be sumptuous and vegetarian with many dishes prepared with potato and badis and will include parantha and kulchas, and kheer for dessert.What do thalis tell us about a particular culture or community?Somewhere the thali stands for nutrition, at other places signifying a belief and for some it has medicinal value. The Chettiar community were predominantly vegetarian. Being traders they travelled a lot, specially to South East Asia and over a period they started eating meat. So the Chettinad thali has non-vegetarian dishes and has a lot of spices from that region like kalpasi which is found in Malaysia and Thailand.Thalis tell us about the belief of the people. Varanasi thali is satvik without onions and garlic and is prepared fresh and has no canned ingredients. It is not too spicy and neither tamsik nor rajsik, nor heavy to ensure that it does not make one lazy or aggressive. The spirituality of the city comes through this thali.The Bodo thali is simple comprising local produce like pork and rice. It includes jute leaves which is more bitter than karela. The reason for its inclusion is the geography of the place. Thick with vegetation, people face lot of insect bites and are prone to become sick. So their thali includes ingredients with medicinal properties like jute leaves. Likewise, the Malwani thali has a strong presence of seafood because of the regions proximity to sea.How are thalis associated with places of worship?The belief system of a community flows into its food. In Udupi, there is a Krishna math and all Udupi residents are Krishna bhakts. They are strict vegetarians. No one is allowed inside the math kitchen. While everyone is served in a plate there, devotees seeking a favour from the deity are served food on ground. They eat like this, till their wish is granted.Are thalis under threat?As we are moving ahead, lots of our dishes are dying away, like pickles. Thalis too are vanishing as it is difficult to procure and prepare with most opting for what is offered by eateries. The show is trying to bring about an awareness regarding thalis and documenting them for future research and study. It definitely adds to ones knowledge. I did not know that in a Kashmiri Pandit thali no garlic or onion is used yet it has meat dishes.As a reputed chef, what are your takeaways from this journey?I have added vastly to my knowledge about local and regional cuisines. In Udupi, I tasted mattu gulla huli. It is sambar made out of green brinjals which comes from a particular village in the region, Mattu. It was tasty and the brinjal which had soaked the entire flavour of sambar did not disintegrate.I learnt how to make rice beer in Bodo which is consumed by men and women after a certain age. Since their thali has beer, it has no desserts. I had never heard of bichhu booty ka saag. A local saag grown in Kumaon, its leaves have a lot of thorns and sting like a scorpions bite. Made with care, it tastes out of the world.I discovered new styles of cooking. A small community called Pathare Prabhu in Maharashtra uses thande tel ka tadka for pomfret fish dish. This entails using oil along with other condiments but it is not heated. What is unique about them, is that there is no restaurant serving their food. Interestingly, they prepare and serve thalis with eight to 20 items, and is high on seafood on festivals and when the son-in-law is visiting their home. All this learning has become part of my kitchen vocabulary. I will take elements from these and tweak my dishes accordingly. I found rosella leaves or gongura grow in plenty in the north east and it can be used as salad leaves.(The show airs every Monday and Tuesday at 8 p.m.)Somewhere the thali stands for nutrition, at other places signifying a belief and for some it has medicinal value"

But the country still has some distance to cover in terms of exports as post-harvest wastage of produce in India is high.In 2015, the Modi government started project CHAMAN  acronym for Coordinated Horticulture Assessment and Management using geo-informatics  to prepare a comprehensive horticultural plan. Using remote sensing technology to study soil conditions, land use, weather and cropping patter, the Centre has chosen 185 districts across the country where seven selected crops are being promoted.Once complete, the findings of the project would be shared with all states to give to boost to cultivation of horticultural crops.States put into groupsDifferent states have been divided into different groups to grow banana, mango, citrus fruits, potato, tomato, onion and chilli.Sharing the progress of the project CHAMAN at a press briefing, Mr Singh said the Centre would convene a meeting of the northeastern states by January next year as the report on horticulture development for this region was ready.This sector provides nutrient rich crops to the people and better remunerative prices to the farmers and increases their incomes, Mr. Singh said.Under CHAMAN, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Gujarat and Maharashtra have been identified as the major banana-growing states. Mango cultivation is being promoted in Andhra, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka and Telangana, while onion is the focus for Maharashtra, Gujarat, Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh."

According to market sources, the prices are expected to be within this range for some time as there has been an almost 60 per cent-dip in onion production in the neighbouring Karnataka.In view of the rise in onion prices in retail markets across the country, the central government had urged the state to investigate the cause of the rise. The district deputy registrar was directed to conduct an inquiry in the matter. Accordingly, the district collector of Nashik held a meeting with the traders and representatives of the various market committees and suggested that they forgo the traditional week-long Diwali break, which is supposed to start from Monday. The move aimed at stopping the escalation of onion prices.However, farmer organisations rejected the suggestion, saying that this was intentionally done to reduce the prices. Dipak Pagar, leader of the Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghtana and director of the Nampur wholesale market, meanwhile warned of an agitation by farmers against the anti-farmer policies of the central government.On Monday, the average modal price of trade was Rs 2,300 in Lasalagon market, with 1,500 quintals of onions arriving for trade. In the neighbouring Pimpalgaon market, the average price of trade was Rs 2,425, with 7,500 quintals arriving for auction. Sources attributed the low arrival to the festive season, when farmers normally refrain from coming to the market.The present price trend, Jaydutt Holkar, chairman of the Lasalgaons wholesale market, said the price trend will continue till the new crop arrives. Farmers have the bare minimum stock. However, the price rise is mainly because of the almost 60 per cent-dip reported in the kharif area from Karnataka, he said. Maharashtras kharif onion, Holkar said, will start arriving post Diwali and, till then, the price rise is expected to continue.For all the latest Pune News, download Indian Express App"

(Illustration: C R Sasikumar) Price instability at the macro level is caused by supply shocks. (Illustration: C R Sasikumar)EXTREME volatility in the prices of some food commodities has, in recent years, been hurting producers as well as consumers, while also disrupting certain economic activities. The reason for this appears to be the waning influence of non-price factors (technology, irrigation, extension) in driving growth, and the role of prices having become stronger. There is clear evidence at the global level to show that till mid-2000, the trend in output growth drove price trend (higher growth associated with lower price) but during the last 10 years, price trends have driven output growth. The so-called Cobweb phenomenon is becoming more apparent, leading to a price-production spiral. In this context, it is important to look at the price stabilisation policy and measures adopted by India from time to time, and draw lessons to maintain a stable price environment that benefits both producers as well as consumers.Price instability at the macro-level is caused by supply shocks. Trading and stocking up are the two options to stabilise supply and by extension, prices. India has historically relied heavily on buffer stock to maintain price stability in staple food, though this policy has come under attack from supporters of free trade, who feel stocking up is a costlier option for price stabilisation. Experience, however, shows that it is often trade that is more expensive. Take the case of wheat in which international prices rose sharply when India entered the market to import the crop and augment its domestic supply.It was due to its policy of maintaining buffer stock that India ensured remarkable price stability during the global food crisis, when almost all countries, including the developed ones, faced a steep price rise. Should India then use a similar option to achieve price stability in pulses, which have shown extreme volatility in the last three years?Some gains from the steps taken by the government to create a buffer stock of pulses are already visible. The buffer stock, mainly aimed at stabilising consumer prices, has made it possible to procure pulses. Last year, India recorded an unprecendented 40 per cent increase in total pulses production over the previous year. The increase was 87 per cent for arhar (tur) dal. This kind of spike in production would have led to a serious crash or even a collapse in prices had the government not intervened  the Central agencies procured 14.7 lakh tonnes of kharif pulses. Nevertheless, farm harvest prices of some pulses dropped well below the MSP in 2016-17, but the shortfall was similar to what has been witnessed quite often in the past, even during years of normal growth in production. For instance, the farm harvest price of arhar in 2013-14 was 14 per cent below MSP in Karnataka and 7 per cent in Maharashtra; the two states account for half of the total tur production.In some mandis, farmers received 30 per cent less than the MSP. Similarly, the five states which account for 85 per cent of gram (chickpea) production received 3 to 9 per cent lower farm harvest price than the MSP in 2013-14. This comparison shows that it is not correct to blame the government for inaction in checking prices of pulses falling below the MSP in a year of bumper production.Based on the experience of rice and wheat, the pragmatic approach appears to be to use the buffer stock option along with the trade option to stabilise the price of pulses. The level of buffer stock should be determined by technical considerations and trade opportunities.Regulation and competition in the market also affect price volatility. If there is an Essential Commodities Act with stock limits on traders, it will rule out the possibility of the private sector mopping up more than the normal marketed surplus, forcing prices to go down.When there is a glut, there is a disproportionate price spread between retail and farm. This is particularly true in the case of vegetables. Price spikes are also sometimes created by cartels of traders, especially at the local level. The reason for such price fluctuations is poor market integration across regions/states over time. This year, while onion prices in some markets in Madhya Pradesh dropped below Rs 200 per quintal in the second fortnight of May, the crop was selling at over Rs 700 per quintal in the major markets of neighbouring Uttar Pradesh. By August, the price of onion touched Rs 800 a quintal in the mandis of Madhya Pradesh and close to Rs 2,000 in the wholesale markets in Delhi. Why wasnt onion promptly taken to other states when prices crashed in MP? Why could it not be stored for just two months to take advantage of the large price increase? These questions have been haunting the country for several years and the answers are well known  remove various restrictions under the APMC Act, facilitate private sector participation and investment in agri markets, promote storage, and link the processing industry to the farm through contract farming etc.The Central government has made a lot of effort to persuade states to implement market reforms and adopt a model APMC Act. It has also urged the states to allow direct purchase by the private sector; set up mandis in the private sector; allow farmers to sell directly to consumers; ensure a single trading license; allow electronic trading; and take fruits and vegetables out of the purview of the APMC Act. These reforms have either been completely ignored or adopted partially with considerable dilution by the states. The sufferers are farmers. The failure to establish a competitive market is forcing farmers to ask for higher MSP and expand procurement to all crops to make MSP effective.In conclusion, price volatility and low and unremunerative prices for farm produce can be addressed to a large extent through competitive markets. In most cases, a competitive market will fetch the farmers higher prices than MSPs. This requires carrying out long-pending reforms in the agricultural market. Due to the delay and reluctance on the part of states to implement market reforms, it looks imperative to bring agricultural marketing into the Concurrent or Union list and implement a national-level model market act with all the required reforms. Bringing marketing under the Concurrent or Union list is also justified on the ground that a large proportion of farm produce is sold and consumed outside the states they are produced in. Still, strategic intervention by the government in the form of buffer stock will be needed in a few cases.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

This would improve availability in consuming areas like Delhi as well, thereby, helping moderate prices, the statement said.Till kharif arrivals pick up, trade association informed that there is enough onion stock available from the Rabi crop to meet the domestic demand.Department advised trade associations to be in readiness to import and supply onions in case prices do not moderate as expected because of unscrupulous activities. Such imports will be facilitated, the statement said.To curb rise in onion prices, the government has recently extended by two months till December the ban on holding of stock beyond a prescribed limit.Retail onion prices are ruling at around Rs 50 per kg in the national capital. In other metro cities, rates are ruling in the range of Rs 30-40 per kg, as per the official data.The agriculture ministry has projected 5.8% fall in onion output at 197.13 lakh tonnes in 2016-17 crop year (July-June), as against actual output of 209.31 lakh tonnes last year."

Photo: Pradeep Gaur/MintTwo common threads run through all current discussions on the Indian economy. First, growth has been rapid since economic liberalization was initiated. Second, the benefits of this growth are skewed with reference to peninsular and western India in contrast to eastern and northern India.Having seen how Andhra Pradesh in the mid-1970s and early 1980s was transformed from a backward economy to a relatively modern economy, I am persuaded to believe that there are two categories of markets: feudal markets and modern markets. Or more appropriately, markets in feudal structures and markets in modern societies. The responses of these two markets to external stimulibe it funds and investment or softer skills such as education and healthare different. Feudal markets function on relationships, hierarchy and patronage. Patron-client equations in hierarchical structures set the tone for the functioning of the economy, ruling out the possibility of structural transformation. The approach is anti-change rather than of breaking conventions in sync with economic democracy.These factors inhibit investment. There is inbuilt resistance to innovative methods that upset the apple cart, restricting the claims of equal rights of participation and of resultant gains. Modern markets, on the other hand, function on rules and transparency, and are open to innovative ideas. These factors attract investment with competition ensuring equal rights to all claimants. The implications of feudal markets and their regressive impact have not been addressed enough, perhaps on the assumption that markets are homogeneous, inanimate institutions.Market classification into feudal and modern is based on the conduct of business in these two markets. Cartels are good examples to highlight these differences. They occur in all markets. Firms collaborate to form cartels and fix prices. As a result, consumers are denied the benefit of competition. Game theoretic framework, however, shows that firms follow business strategies that result in identical price structures even in oligopolistic market structures without the need to collaborate or form cartels. In their effort to detect and break cartels, competition authorities instead look for agreements that indicate collaboration. Alternatively, they encourage whistle-blowing with appropriate incentives.In the case of feudal markets, game theoretic modelling is of no relevance. Collaboration is a non-issue. Entry is restricted with complete lack of transparency in all transactions as the Competition Commission discovered in its investigation into the onion trade cartel. Of prime significance in the onion market was the presence of strong kinship bonds among traders cemented over generations. The corollary condition of feudal markets was discernible in the patron-client relationship between peasant farmer and traders with predetermined prices and marketable stocks. The auction markets and bidding mechanisms of modern markets for competition remained a farce in the onion market. What is interesting and significant is that the commission could not break the cartel for want of evidence.Of course, it could be argued that the onion market is a one-off case typical of vegetable mandis. The intent is not to delve into a discussion on cartel busting but to highlight features of feudal markets that deter private foreign investment in modern industry. Hierarchical structures based on personal relationships as seen in the onion market or the denial of equal rights and claims of all participants are hardly conducive for attracting investment. Current data on foreign investment shows that six states and Union territoriesMaharashtra, Delhi, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Telanganagarnered a large portion in 2017.What could be a catalyst? The new narrative currently doing the rounds is of foreign investment flowing into activities pertaining to agriculture in economically backward states. Foreign investment is agnostic but would it usher change in a short time frame? I would root instead for investment in business that disrupts existing structures on a large scale.The Andhra Pradesh experience underlines foreign investment as a catalyst of change. Catching the tail wind of outsourcing, these investments in technology companies led to a chain of events, which, in my view, made the difference. The emergence of a host of services catering to upwardly mobile young people employed in these companies created jobs for low-skilled workers, many from rural areas, and exposed them to modern markets.Digitalization and the spread of smartphones throws up several outreach possibilities. This has demonstrated the innovative and inclusive approach of digital finance. New finance companies are selling customized financial products online to clientele outside structured financial institutions and at minimum risk. In the era of big data, digital sale of data offers unexplored opportunities to farmers. Real-time data on cropping patterns; resistance of new seeds to pests; responses to new varieties of seedits all information sought by international firms engaged in genetically modified seed technology and automation of farm equipment. This data business empowers small farmers. Negotiation with large business houses is now possible, unheard of within the feudal constricts of patron-client relations. The only hitch is resistance to rule-based modern markets ingrained in feudal societies.Geeta Gouri is a former member of the Competition Commission of India."

Onion prices have crashed.The government insisting on cash being replaced by cheque and digital payments is working against farmers and in favour of traders, the IndiaSpend survey shows. With slow digital infrastructure, cheques take 3-4 weeks to cash, delaying the buying of seed and fresh sowing operations. Often, the cheques bounce.On the night of November 8 last year, the government declared a war on the cash economy and black money. What happened, in fact, was a reasonably robust economy slowed down, and many small and medium enterprises (SMEs) got wiped out. The poor and the marginalised lost their jobs and had to spend days in queues at banks to draw a few rupees of their own hard-earned money.Little black money recoveredOn the first anniversary of notebandi, the PM is still in an aggressive mood threatening to crackdown on benami assets. There is still support for his bold move to root out the parallel economy that was funding terrorism and corruption. Some even said stone-pelting in the Kashmir Valley disappeared after the Rs 500-per-day per stone-pelter could not be sustained after the evaporation of illegal money stashes!But beyond the rhetoric, was the government able to unearth large stashes of black or unaccounted money?A Reserve Bank (RBI) report in end-August this year showed that of the Rs 15.44 lakh crore of demonetised notes circulating in November 2016, 99.96 percent or Rs 15.28 lakh crore was returned, leaving just Rs 16,000 crore unaccounted for. The government was expecting around Rs 3 lakh crore of dirty money not coming back to the system; but black money operators, traders and criminals employed armies of mules to deposit their stashes under benami names, money that became legal when withdrawn from the banks.The learning: unaccounted income is not stored in cash and under mattresses. An analysis of IT records shows that only six per cent of unaccounted wealth is kept in cash, while the bulk is parked in real estate, or abroad in a variety of instruments.Digital blunderDemonetisation was also an attempt to move towards a cashless, digital economy, but that is not easy for an economy that runs on cash. There was an initial spike in digital transactions. From November to December 2016, mobile banking and other digital payments went up from 9.6 lakh to 10.4 lakh transactions; but once more cash became available, by February 2017, digital transactions fell 16.7 percent to 8.08 lakh. A cashless economy needs a high level of digital infrastructure and financial education; and India will take some time before getting there.Pain on the groundOn the other hand, demonetisation triggered a slowdown and job losses that has meant unending pain for the common man and an embarrassment for the government. India showed a robust 7- 7.9 per cent robust gross domestic product (GDP) growth in the three quarters till the end of calendar year 2016, making it the fastest growing economy even ahead of China. Post-demonetisation, GDP growth fell to 6.1 per cent for the January-March 2017 quarter, and then further down to 5.7 per cent for the April-June quarter, making our growth rate slip behind China.Translated into real terms, it is estimated that businesses suffered losses of Rs 1.28 lakh crore for the first 50 days of demonetisation, and approximately 15 lakh people lost their jobs in the first four months after November 8.With hindsight, it is clear the government did not have its ear to the ground. The Prime Minister ignored the advice of Raghuram Rajan, former RBI governor who retired in September last year. Chief Economic Advisor Arvind Subramanian remained silent and was believed to have also been against the big bang reform. Perhaps, some convinced the PM that a Robin Hood attack on black money was easy to muddle through; and it would give him rich political benefits.Events have proved demonetisation was an economic disaster; but the jury is still out on whether the people perceive it so, and will punish the ruling party in the upcoming 2019 Lok Sabha elections.[The author can be contacted at gurbir1@gmail.com]"

Photo: Abhijit Bhatlekar/MintMumbai/Delhi: Narayan Ghawat, a 66-year-old paddy farmer in Mila village of Maharashtras Thane district, was mighty impressed with Prime Minister Narendra Modis demonetisation drive when he read about it in newspapers on 9 November 2016. One year later, Ghawat does not quite understand what demonetisation has achieved.I think the objective was good but it has not been achieved. It has not unearthed black money to the extent Modiji said it would, Ghawat says as he awaits his turn at a branch of Thane District Central Co-operative Bank. Ghawat does not have a debit card and does banking the traditional way. Before he withdraws money and leaves the bank, he helps fill up a cheque for a tribal couple, both farm labourers, from his village.Dhondu Mukne, the tribal farm labourer, remembers notebandi, as demonetisation is popularly known, as the period when his daily wages of Rs300 would not be paid in cash at the end of the day. It was paid after some days, Dhondu says. Now, Dhondu says he gets paid his wages in cash at the end of each day he puts in. Dhondu offers little on notebandi other than this impact.Ghawat grows paddy on his 3 acre farm. Extended monsoon rains have damaged his standing paddy crop, causing a nearly 25% drop in productivity compared with the 20 quintals he grew in 2016. He says he will sell the produce at a government-appointed procurement centre.Money will be transferred to my bank account if I sell rice at the government-operated procurement centre. But this would happen even before notebandi. Now even traders have to deposit money directly into farmers accounts if they have purchased farm produce from them. That is not exactly a good thing for farmers because we need some ready cash for day-to-day expenses and agriculture inputs, Ghawat says.One year after Modis demonetisation, the farm sector has somewhat recovered from the immediate impact it causeda cash crunch for buyers of farm produce, disruption in movement and supply chain of commodities leading to a steep rise in the retail prices, and loss of cash wages for millions of farm labourers across the country. But farmers, activists, other farm sector stakeholders like functionaries of the regulated markets, and experts point out the long-term damage demonetisation has done to the farm sector.Demonetisation distorted an already skewed and fragile farm sector across India. It snuffed out cash from a market which is largely cash-driven and which operates mutually on cash flows. It caused an average 20-30% fall in the prices of most commodities, a fall from which no farm produce has yet recovered, and also impacted the consumer goods in rural and semi-rural markets because farmers are the largest component of buyers in these markets, said an agriculture sector expert in Maharashtra who runs a think-tank and who did not wish to be named.In Maharashtra, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, and Telangana, states that are still recovering from the impact of drought, demonetisation contributed to a market-driven crisis by cutting down the margins that the farmers would have realized if cash was not scarce.In Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh, it added fuel to the demand for farm loan waivers which, as in Maharashtra where it has been conceded, puts additional long-term stress on the state finances and takes away capital from productive investment and allocates it to non-productive.Protests in Maharashtra triggered a similar agitation in neighbouring Madhya Pradesh in June. In Mandsaur district, six protestors were killed in the police firing. In Maharashtra, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government blinked and announced a Rs34,022 crore farm loan waiver which is being implemented using online and biometric systems. Maharashtra followed another BJP-ruled state Uttar Pradesh, which had already announced a Rs36,000 crore loan waiver.While the jury is still out on the costs and benefits of demonetisation, farm sector stakeholders see little for farmers to cheer about the disruptive decision. Demonetisation was never an economic decision. It was a political decision which paid off for Modi in the Uttar Pradesh elections. In the short term after 8 November, it only compounded the systemic problems for farmers, says Vidarbha-based farmer and farm activist Vijay Jawandhia. It was in Uttar Pradesh that Modi, while campaigning for the BJP, promised a farm loan waiver, an announcement that predictably had repercussions in other BJP-ruled states.Another Maharashtra-based sector expert and former member of the Commission for Agriculture Costs and Prices (CACP), who requested anonymity, says it is the trading lobby in the farm sector which made the most of demonetisation at the cost of the most vulnerable segmentthe farmers themselves. The commodity traders exploited demonetisation as an opportunity. Since they had cash in old or banned currency, they offered it to farmers who wanted to sell their produce to get some cash. The farmer, who sold his produce to the traders for prices much lower than the market, then stood in the queues to exchange this currency. This way, traders offloaded some of their black money. Traders exploited the cash crunch created by demonetisation to bring down the prices of farm produce to such distress levels that it created a market-driven agrarian crisis in a year of record high yields, the expert said.He said demonetisation had created problems for the farmers on the input side by creating a cash crunch just ahead of the 2017 Rabi season, and the output side by allowing traders to dampen the prices, and also the farm labourers.Despite fears that demonetisation will impact the Rabi crop, overall foodgrain production at 276 million tonnes broke all records in 2016-17. Together with a bumper harvest of horticulture crops like fruits and vegetables, Indias agriculture growth rate shot up to a high of 4.9% during the year, up from a measly 0.7% the year before. The record harvest, coupled with demonetisation pulled down crop prices, especially that of perishable crops and pulses.A senior Maharashtra government official, who did not want to be named, admitted the disruptive nature of demonetisation on the farm sector but pointed out some benefits too. Traders registered across Agricultural Produce Market Committees (APMCs) in Maharashtra started making payments to farmers through real-time gross settlement and national electronic funds transfer systems, he noted. This happened in other states as well after the initial disruption. This change not only reduced the role of middlemen and commission agents but also enabled state governments across India to digitally identify farmers, the official said.Jaydatta Holkar, president of the Lasalgaon APMC in Maharashtras Nashik district, Indias largest regulated onion market, agreed with the observation but said the change was not necessarily good for farmers. Earlier since the transactions were cash-based, both farmers and traders had enough cash and the cash flow kept the economy running. Traders would raise soft loans to pay off farmers and repay the loans when the commodities moved further in the wholesale and retail market. But the cash crunch disrupted this flow and led to drop in the prices. Another fallout of digital transfers of money is that the farmers who would come to the APMC market from smaller places would spend some of the cash they received in the local consumer market. For instance, the onion growers who sold their produce in Lasalgaon would spend some of that money in the local Lasalgaon market that same day. This is not possible with digital money and the consumer markets have suffered due to farmers withdrawal, Holkar said.Sunil Golya, a farmer in Madhya Pradeshs Harda district and founder member of Aam Kisan Union in Madhya Pradesh, said APMCs in Madhya Pradesh too had started making RTGS/NEFT payment to farmers. But if this was such a good change, why is it that chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan recently announced that traders could pay up to Rs50,000 in cash to farmers for procurement and the balance through RTGS? This means the Madhya Pradesh government has in a way admitted that the cash crunch created by demonetisation was not beneficial to farmers, Golya said.In addition to the other negative consequences like a fall in the procurement prices and cash crunch, demonetisation had also directly impacted the value of a big asset that the farmers held, Golya said. Demonetisation has drastically reduced the price of agricultural land, an asset that the farmer banks on to leverage in times of crisis. In Harda district only, an acre of irrigated land was fetching around Rs12 lakh before demonetisation but the prices are down to Rs5.5-6 lakh since November 2016, he said.With an average 20% fall in the remunerative prices and land prices getting halved, farmers in Madhya Pradesh, despite contributing to the states record high 20% agriculture growth, did not have surplus income and demonetisation was a factor in it, he added."

With onions selling at `40 per kg, the consumers are now feeling the pinch after prices of different vegetables soared between `40 and `100 per kg.In such a scenario, officials of the Food Supplies and Consumer Welfare (FS&CW) department have once again linked the price rise to the problem of limited supply at the source point in Nashik in Maharashtra. There are no reports of hoarding of onions by local wholesalers. We are monitoring the situation. If needed, onions will be sold through Government fair price shops, Sundargarh Civil Supplies Officer (CSO) A Barik said. In July, when onion prices had jumped to `28 per kg, the department had opened 37 fair price shops across the city.If onions were not enough to bring tears to the eyes of locals, vegetables added to their woes. While green peas were sold at `100 per kg, capsicum and carrot were priced at `80 per kg at the markets across Rourkela on Sunday, sources said. Pointed gourd, cauliflower, bean and seam were priced at `60 per kg each. Tomatoes and spinach were priced at `50 per kg, while brinjal, plantain, ladys finger, ridge-gourd and bitter-gourd sold at `40 per kg. Ginger and garlic were selling at `100 and 60 per kg, respectively, sources said, adding that the price of green chilli came as a surprise at `80 to `100 per kg.Amid the soaring prices, sweet potatoes, cow-pea, pumpkin, radish, papaya, cucumber and some local varieties of greens were available for `20 to `30 per kg. Potatoes came as a major relief, selling at `10 per kg, sources added. Usually, by this time of the year, vegetable prices should have decreased. The crisis can be attributed to the lack of locally-grown vegetables in the markets. I hope the arrival of new vegetables to Rourkela city from Nuagaon, Bisra block, Kuarnmunda and Lathikata blocks of the district besides from adjacent pockets of neighbouring Jharkhand will bring down prices, a local vendor, Subal Barik, said."

The purchase price of onion is Rs. 40 a kg, plus 5% tax. Despite the spiralling prices, we are selling onions at our outlets with a wafer-thing profit margin. Even the price of tomatoes has remained on the higher side, with the selling price hovering around Rs. 40 a kg, he said.Datta, manager at a HOPCOMS procurement centre, said there has been a drop in supply of onions from the major onion markets in north Karnataka and Maharashtra. This is following a fall in production owing to untimely rains.We have no agreement with the farmers on onion procurement. Therefore, we procure them directly from the wholesale dealers at the APMC [yard].

(File Photo) One of the prime reasons behind high volatility in onion prices stems from a lack of storage facilities that have not kept pace with rising production. (File Photo)Onions are, once again, in the news. Last week, retail prices touched Rs 50/kg in several markets, and wholesale prices touched Rs 30/kg in major onion markets like Lasalgaon in Maharashtra. This is not the first time that onion prices have spiked. Almost every alternate year, this roller-coaster of boom and bust in onion prices happens (see Graph). But 2017 is interesting as it saw record low prices in May-June when farmers sold onions at around Rs 2/kg in several mandis in Madhya Pradesh. This has led to grief and anger among farmers.The situation became precarious when farmers protested and police fired at them, resulting in some unfortunate deaths. The MP chief minister realised the sensitivity of the incident and quickly announced a decision to procure onions at Rs 800/quintal and state agencies procured 8.76 lakh tonnes. But in the absence of ample storage capacity in the state, onions had to be quickly disposed of through the PDS and open market operations at almost one-fifth the cost. The whole operation caused a loss of Rs 785 crore to the MP government.However, the more unusual aspect of the onion situation was that only a few months later, in August 2017, prices started shooting up (see Graph) resulting in a visit by officers of the Union Ministry of Consumer Affairs to Lasalgaon, income tax raids on traders in September and the suspension of trading in Lasalgaon APMC for about a month. The prices then fell for some time but they have been rising since Diwali, prompting the government to announce the import of onions by the MMTC to bring down domestic prices.This is not the first year when government action has been so ad-hoc and puzzling within a few months. In previous years, too, we have seen the government fix the minimum export price, ban exports of onions, and even a study by the Competition Commission of India. The lesson: Income tax raids proved futile in keeping the lid on onion prices even for a few months. We need better policies.So, what is it that causes high volatility in onion prices and what could be the way out? In order to respond to these questions, one may first note that India produced 21.7 MMT of onions, which is about 20 per cent of global production in 2016-17, second only to China. India also exported 2.4 MMT in 2016-17, up from 1.2 MMT in 2014-15. About 60 per cent of onion production is in the rabi season, sown in December-January and harvested in April-May. This is the onion which is stored by farmers and traders and it meets export as well as domestic demand till the arrival of the kharif onion crop, which is sown in May-June and harvested in October-November. The late kharif crop is sown in August-September and harvested in January-February. Kharif and late kharif crops produce about 20 per cent each of the annual production. Kharif onion is of rather poor quality and cannot be stored for very long. The prices tend to rise in October-November when rabi onion stocks are almost depleted and kharif onion is yet to hit the market, or if the kharif crop is damaged, as is the case this year.One of the prime reasons behind high volatility in onion prices stems from a lack of storage facilities that have not kept pace with rising production. Also, the traditional storage practices incur losses as high as 40 per cent. While Maharashtra used the Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana and National Horticulture Mission and created 42,282 low-cost onion storage structures with a capacity of 9.65 lakh tonnes, there is hardly any storage facility in MP. No wonder, MP farmers suffered most in a bumper onion crop year. However, modern cold storages, as being set up by Allround India, a subsidiary of Allround Holland, and other such companies, can bring down wastage within the 10-15 per cent range.So, the first policy action has to be to promote modern cold storages and develop a system akin to that of the warehouse receipt system for farmers. While a bulk of the storage has to be undertaken by the private sector, the state can do some stocking under a price stabilisation fund. They can hire the services of specialised private sector agencies to carry out such operations on the governments behalf.Second, use trade policy for price stabilisation. In case of a bumper crop, promote exports and in case of a deficit crop, encourage imports. This has to be done well in advance  as soon as one comes to know the advance estimates of production.Third, encourage the setting up of onion dehydrating units and promote demand for dehydrated onions amongst large consumers (restaurants, fast food chains, army, hospitals, etc). Gujarat has already emerged as the main centre for dehydration units with 85 out of 100 units located there, while Maharashtra has just five units. Dehydrated onions are being exported to Japan, Europe, Russia, US and some African countries. The Ministry of Food Processing and state governments can encourage entrepreneurs to avail grants for setting up onion dehydration and processing units. A subsidy of up to 35 per cent with a cap of Rs 5 crore is available to such units. However, the budget of the Ministry of Food Processing for this scheme is just Rs 95 crore. And MP, in its budget for 2017-18, has provided just Rs 7 crore as grants to food processing units. This needs to go up manifold if we are serious about encouraging food processing and stabilising prices even of fresh onions.Thus, instead of raiding traders or banning exports et al, the Centre and the states would do better if they promote investment in scientific storage and processing facilities, and use trade policy more judiciously.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

According to the agriculture ministry, planting of (2017-18) kharif onions is 29% lowered than last year.Data from the National Horticulture Board shows that arrival of onions in major wholesale markets in October fell 17% compared to the year before.Domestic supplies are also tight as India exported 0.79 million tonnes of onions between April and August this year, show numbers from the Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority.In 2016-17, India exported 2.4 million tonnes of fresh onions, about a tenth of its estimated production of 21.7 million tonnes during the year."

This Hindustan Unilever action follows similar announcements by FMCG majors like Dabur, Godrej Consumer and ITC, and comes in the backdrop of the scathing critique from the government that it had done its bit to lower tax rates for many items of everyday use, but companies and service providers had not extended these tax cuts to consumers. It even threatened companies with action, and asked them to take corrective and informative steps.Tell me more: On 10 November, the government took out 178 item headings from the 28% category, leaving 50 items in that GST bracket.23What is it? The points margin that Valtteri Bottas of Mercedes needs over Sebastian Vettel of Ferrari in the last race of the 2017 Formula 1 season this weekend to finish second in the drivers championship. Effectively, Bottas would have to win and Vettel would have to score no points.Why is it important? If Bottas does manage to overtake Vettel, this will be the fourth consecutive season in which Mercedes would have finished one and two in the F1 drivers championship. It would also be a blow to Ferrari, which was leading the drivers title race till seven races ago, but saw its prospects implode after a series of driver and team errors.Tell me more: Lewis Hamilton clinched the championship two races ago, in Mexico, for the fourth title of his career.

A kg of good quality onions now costs Rs 65-Rs 70 in Bengaluru's retail markets Decreased supply and increasing demand have sent the prices of onions and shallots (small onions) soaring, say farmers and traders. Even shallot prices have doubled; they range from Rs 160 to Rs 170 in the open market. Such a steep hike has not been witnessed in many years, say some farmers from North Karnataka, which is a major onion-producing region.On an average, Bengaluru markets receive 80 to 100 truckloads of onions daily. Now only 20 to 25 truckloads of onions are being supplied from Hubballi and parts of Andhra Pradesh, which is one-fourth of the daily requirement, according to an office-bearer of the Bangalore Onion Traders Association . As a result, a kg of onion which was available at Rs 30-40 just a week ago now costs Rs 70. And in another one week, it may cross Rs 80, fear traders.In the wholesale market, onion prices are up by 25% in the past five days at Hubballi APMC, Asia's largest wholesale market for onions. Modal prices have been hovering at Rs 3,000-Rs 5,000 per quintal depending of the onion quality, due to a delay in arrival of the fresh kharif harvest.North Karnataka districts, including Dharwad, Gadag, Koppal, Belagavi and Raichur, were meeting 75 per cent of Karnataka's onion demand. The state gets the remaining 25 per cent from Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra.""Normal supply of onion is possible only after farmers take up rabi cultivation and after resumption of road communication, which may take another one or two months,'' said Wahab Mulla, general secretary, Onion and Potato Merchants Association M K Patil, a senior horticulture officer said the prices of onions are expected to stabilize as the Centre has decided to impose a minimum export price (MEP) of $850 per tonne on onions to increase domestic supply and check rising costs. They have also asked public sector body Minerals and Metals Trading Corporation (MMTC) to import 2,000 tonnes of onions in order to check prices in local markets.Market sources expect a further increase in onion prices as the supply from North Karnataka is unlikely to be resumed soon. Other vegetables whose prices have shot up during the past couple of days include carrot, coriander leaves, cauliflower, cabbage, beans and tomato."

But these days she is faced with a tough choice, whether to add onions to the food items or not. That's because the price of onions is steadily climbing the charts and has reached Rs 50/kg in the retail market, up by Rs 10 from last week. And if market insiders are to be believed, the cost could go up further.The spike in onion prices, along with the rise in the cost of vegetables are burning a hole in the pocket of the common people. Even the state government's assurance to deal with the price rise by importing onions from neighbouring states have failed to yield results.""Usually I require around 2-3 kg of onions every week to cook food for my family of five. After the price rise I am trying to manage with 1kg. I am finding it very difficult to cook non-veg food,"" said Pati, a housewife.""For the past two months onions are being sold at Rs 40 per kg and above. Last week it suddenly increased to Rs 46 and today it has gone up to Rs 50 per kg. How can a family manage with such stiff hike of essential commodities?"" asked Manisha Behera, another homemaker.On october 28, food supplies and consumer welfare minister Surya Narayan Patro had said that the prices would come down within one week after the new harvest.""The new harvest will arrive in the next one week after which the situation is likely to improve. I have also requested the Maharashtra government to supply onions to us first as our consumers are facing inconvenience,"" Patro had said.On Thursday, when asked about the prevailing situation, Patro said: ""Now procurement of all agriculture products will be made through e-procurement. So once fresh procurement orders are placed the prices are likely to drop.""Traders said the main reason behind the hike in onion prices was the loss of crop due to bad weather and the cost being high in the source states. ""On Thursday wholesale price at Nasik mandi was Rs 4,200 to Rs 4,500 per quintal. After adding transportation cost, the price in Odisha will be more than Rs 5,000 per quintal,"" said Sameer Das , a wholesale trader at Unit-I market.The prices of vegetables too are moving up. Tomato has been selling at Rs 60 per kg, broad beans at Rs 80/kg, okra for Rs 60/kg, drumsticks at Rs 200/kg and green peas for Rs 100/kg.

Vishwanath said the price rise was owing to a fall in supply.The production season for onions is over in the State and we have been procuring the vegetable from Nasik. But, owing to heavy rain in Nasik, farmers have been unable to harvest the crop and supply it to Karnataka, resulting in price rise. The situation should return to normal in a week to 10 days, he said.In retail chains, onion was selling at Rs. 50 on Thursday. But, the price is likely to increase on Friday and will be on a par with the HOPCOM rates, said a senior official from a retail chain.In the Bengaluru APMC market, supply of onion has trickled down to less than 30% of normal during this time of the year, said Ravishankar B. of Bengaluru Onion and Potato Merchants Association.As against an average of 2.5 lakh sacks during November, we got less than 50,000 sacks this month, he said.The fall in supply is also attributed to massive crop loss during the recent spells of heavy rain in September-October.This year sowing was delayed by over month. Instead of sowing in June, most farmers in the Chitradurga-Hubballi-Belagavi belt sowed onion in the second half of August.But the first sowing was ruined, as heavy rain led to water stagnation in the farms.There was massive crop loss in the second sowing as well owing to rain, bringing down the yield to less than half, he said.Onion harvest season in Karnataka starts from September and the crop floods the local markets till December. However, this year, the crop from Karnataka has almost stopped reaching the markets and now Karnataka is dependant on other States.There is hope that supply will stabilise by the new year when Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh harvest it. A good yield in these States is likely to ensure onion rates below Rs. 40 by new year.This year, sowing of onions was delayed by a month due to delayed monsoons. Instead of sowing in June, most farmers in the Chitradurga-Hubballi-Belagavi belt sowed in the second half of August.

Express file Officials say the move will free the markets from political interference and allow for better implementation of schemes. Express fileFive major wholesale markets in the state, including Punes, are likely to see a major change in the way their board of directors are elected. Instead of elections to pick the board, the state government is likely to appoint senior officials as directors to run these markets. These five markets  the wholesale markets of Vashi, Nashik, Kolhapur and Nagpur, besides Pune  receive around 30 per cent of the commodities arriving from other states and have substantially large turnovers. Vashis is the largest wholesale market in the state and, besides Maharashtra, records arrivals from Gujarat, among other states. The move to appoint senior officials as directors is part of the new model Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) Act circulated by the central government in March this year. The Act specifies markets with more than 30 per cent arrival from other states as markets of national importance.State governments have been asked to give their suggestions and objections to it and adopt it as they deem fit. The Act has numerous other provisions to improve the performance of wholesale markets and help farmers realise better value for their produce. The government has formed a special committee headed by the director (marketing) to study the matter and submit a report. The report, it is learnt, is in its final stages after which it will be put before the Cabinet for approval.APMCs for long have been the hub of politics. In Maharashtra, the Congress and NCP have traditionally controlled these markets with the ruling BJP having a thin presence in them. Earlier, the state government had mooted the concept of expert directors, who would be political appointees on these boards. Majority of those appointed, it is said, were close to the BJP. The present move, many say, is another government move to wrestle control of these markets.Officials say the move will free the markets from political interference and allow for better implementation of schemes. Meanwhile, most traders say the move will not affect the functioning of the markets. Rajendra Shelke, president of the Vashi markets onion and potato traders, said trade would go on unhindered. This is purely a political move and will achieve nothing substantial, he said.Jagdish Apshunde, a director of the Nashik market, however, said the move will have its pros and cons. An upright officer will be able to run the markets better but if power is concentrated in the hands of a corrupt officer, the market will go for a toss, he said.For all the latest Pune News, download Indian Express App"

Further price drop is expected as the effects of increased Minimum Export Price (MEP) and arrival of imported onions are set to kick in the market.Since June, onion prices had seen a steady rise with the wholesale market at Lasalgaon in Nashik recording average trade price of over Rs 3,000 per quintal. Drought in Karnataka and the late arrival of the kharif crop in Maharashtra were cited as the causes for the price rise. The stored rabi onion was feeding the market with Maharashtra being the only state with ample storage of onions. Onions from Maharashtra were feeding the markets and subsequently prices had crossed the Rs 3,500 per quintal mark in the wholesale markets. Retail prices had touched Rs 80 per kg.MEP and imports follow indirect tactics adopted by the government for the last two months to control onion prices. Income tax raids were conducted on traders in Nashik to look for stored onions. Reports had come in of traders being threatened by officials from the Ministry of Consumer Affairs to not raise the price in the wholesale markets. Talk of the possible raising of MEP and imports has been doing the rounds since September with traders terming this as sentiment doctoring to get the prices down. MEP has been zero since December 24, 2015 to boost exports and reduce the then glut in the market. Besides imposing an MEP of $850 per tonne, the central government has also floated tenders for importing 2,000 MT of onions. Both these moves, the government hopes, will bring down the onion prices in retail markets.This has not gone down well with the farmers. Santosh Goarde, an onion grower from the village in Talki in Niphad taluka of Nashik, said the governments move comes at a time when growers are being hounded by the power distribution companies to pay up their bills or face disconnection.The discom is demanding one time payment at a time farmers have no ready cash. When the prices were just getting right offsetting the losses of the last 18 months, the government took steps to stop it, he said.

Wholesale prices of onions have soared up to Rs. 40 per kg against the selling price of Rs. 15- Rs. 20 per kg last year. The prices are still in control in comparison to last week, when the bulb was retailed at Rs. 80 per kg in many parts of the city.Fuctuations all weekWe dont know what the exact reason is but supply from Nashik has been very low for weeks, said 18-year-old Mohammad Saddam, a vegetable retailer based in east Delhis Kalyanpuri who procures his supply from Ghazipur.Mohan Kumar, a wholesale trader, said fluctuations of around Rs. 5 were being registered in onion prices on a daily basis since the beginning of the current week.On Thursday, the price per kg was Rs. 55 and on Friday it is Rs. 50. Hopefully the trend will continue and we will be able to procure the stock. We will be able to pass it forward at a reasonable profit margin, which is currently at its lowest per quintal, he said.Suchetna Khanna, a housewife, complained that her budget had gone haywire due to daily fluctuations in onion prices.I bought just 1 kg onions at the beginning of this week because that was all I could afford at these prices but the bulbs went bad over the next two days.

There has been significantly lower planting by farmers this year. Heavy rain compounded the problem. Some of the produce we received was wet and spoils faster but we sell it anyway.Traders pointed out that they saw more customers in the mandi due to limited supply and soaring retail prices outside but were quick to complain about the instability of the supply and the rates.Farmers in my village cried last year because the produce did not sell and what sold went for ridiculously low prices. Hence, they unanimously decided to produce a bare minimum this year. This must be the plight of the farmers across the rest of the country, said Munga Lal, a trader at the Mandi.He blamed the governments anti-farmer policies for the unpredictable vegetable prices.I purchased onions for Rs. 50 per kg some days ago. The prices have suddenly dropped now and I am forced to sell the same produce at Rs. 40 per kg.

On Sunday, about 450 quintals of onions reached Visakhapatnam from Kurnool.RequirementThe approximate requirement of onions in 13 rythu bazaars across the district is 450 to 500 quintals a day.

While warming of a status quo till end of January, officials of the Telangana states agricultural marketing department attribute the abnormal price rise to the excessive rains in onion-growing states such as Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka and West Bengal.They predict a price correction by February.Late rainfall in September and October damaged the onion kharif crop in Telangana also.

We cannot purchase onions at such a rise price. Hence, we are clearing our old stock.

The agriculture ministry thinks so and is hunting for commercially viable proposals in 12 pre-identified areas.The Narendra Modi governments Startup India scheme, which has a Rs10,000 crore war chest managed by the Small Industries Development Bank of India (Sidbi), is seeking to incubate farm-solution startups through a contest called Agriculture Grand Challenge.I urge young entrepreneurs to participate in our newly launched Agriculture Grand Challenge and join forces to make agrarian sector technologically sound and commercially viable, farm minister Radha Mohan Singh said. The idea is to enable entrepreneurship and innovation, he said.A handful of startups for the rural economy are already a part of the growing ecosystem. India has more than 19,000 startups, led by consumer Internet and financial services apps, according to the Economic Survey 2015-16.From 220 in 2014, the number of startups funded in the first 10 months of 2017 stood at 482, according to data from Tracxn.As of December 2015, eight Indian startups belonged to the so-called Unicorn category, a club of ventures valued at $1 billion or more. Yet, fewer than 10% of these cater to the farm or social sector, according to Tracxn.A government document, which Hindustan Times has reviewed, states that private-sector startups could offer viable interventions in an array of areas, notably linking farmers to markets and offering extension services. It seeks to rev up an emerging niche area thats being dubbed as farming as a service, or FAAS.Proposals are being invited for simplified, sensor-based quick testing of soil samples as well as real-time assaying and grading of food commodities in electronically linked eNAM markets. The government has linked 470 mandis electronically but many of them lack crucial infrastructure: food labs to test samples being brought to these markets. The prospective app should preferably enable sample tests under two minutes to promote online trade.The government is interested in apps to connect food processors with agripreneurs and growers, an official said. To help price discovery, the ministry is looking at price forecast apps for pulses, oilseeds, potato, onion and tomato at the time of sowing since these crop are vulnerable to price volatility.According to the document, the success of the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana, Indias main farm insurance scheme, depends on accurate yield estimates at village and farm levels for which it wants to incubate digital technologies.Another priority area is custom hiring of farm machinery and cheaper disposal of crop residue that has become a major reason for pollution in the national capital from neighbouring states during winters.Under the programme, commercially viable ideas will be incubated at the governments expense for three months. The last date for applications is January 15, 2018.Given the high penetration of Internet-enabled mobile phones, this is a good idea that can drive down cultivation costs, said Ashok Duggal, one of the promoters of VentureIndia Labs.A crop of startups aimed at harnessing the rural economy has made inroads already. AgroStar, a Pune-based mobile-commerce firm, directly sells farm inputs to farmers in Maharashtra and has raised more than $4 million.
