The wholesale rate of tomato is around Rs 10/kg and its available at Rs 15-20 in retail market, Choithram Sabjimandi Kalyan Sangh secretary Nikhil Hardiya told TOI.He said that as crops supply is expected to reduce, tomatos rate is likely to go up in next month. Wholesale rate of potato is still below Rs 10/kg as good production of the crop and farmers disinterest to keep it in the cold-storage for longtime are stated to be the reasons behind the low-price.Potato is being sold at Rs 7-8 in Choithram wholesale vegetable market while the retail price hovers around Rs 15/kg, Aaloo Pyaaj Vyapari Sangh, Indore vice-president Vijay Garg told TOI.He said that a few weeks ago, potatos wholesale price had hit a new low of the season as the rate had gone down to Rs 1/kg.Quality of the crop, which was sold around Rs 1/kg, was however not as good as what is available in the market. Most of the potato crop, sold earlier, was deteriorating in the cold-storage and to avoid further loss, the farmers sold it at the minimum rate, Garg said.Wholesale rate of garlic has also witnessed a downtrend in recent past.Excess production of the crop is the main reason behind the reduced rate Garg said. Unlike these crops, the rate of another vital commodity i.e. onion has however witnessed a rise.Few weeks ago, the wholesale rate of onion was around Rs 25/kg while the retail price was between Rs 40-45. The crop is now being sold at Rs 30-35/kg in wholesale market while the retail rate is around Rs 50-60/kg Garg said."

But the drop in wholesale onion market is likely to reflect in retail markets in the next few days.""The arrival of late Kharif onion has picked up in Gujarat at large. Moreover, the arrival of early summer crop has also started in onion belts of Pune and Ahmednagar . As a result, the demand for Nashik's onion has reduced to some exten,"" said onion trader Manoj Jain."
5aeaa9fe9855b7179ad6d366,Onion price up at Rs 50-60/kg; government says will cool down soon,http://www.newindianexpress.com/business/2018/jan/11/onion-price-up-at-rs-50-60kg-government-says-will-cool-down-soon-1750736.html,2018-01-11,"By PTINEW DELHI: Retail onion price have risen to Rs 50-60/kg in some parts of the country but the government said it is a ""temporary phase"" and the rates will cool down by the month-end with improved arrival of the kharif crop.Onion is being sold at over Rs 50/kg in the national capital, Mumbai and Kolkata, respectively. In Chennai, the price is ruling at Rs 45/kg, as per the official data. A similar trend prevails in small cities as well.""It is a temporary phase. Traders are taking advantage of the temporary ups and downs. But the fundamentals are strong,"" Agriculture Secretary S K Pattanayak told PTI.Though the onion crop is estimated to be slightly lower in the 2017-18 crop year (July-June) but the total production would be sufficient to meet the domestic requirement, he said.As per the Agriculture Ministry's data, the country's onion production is estimated to decline by 4.5 per cent to 21.4 million tonnes in the 2017-18 crop year due to lower acreage as against 22.4 million tonnes last year.Pattanayak said the prices of onion will get corrected with the increase in arrival of the crop in the coming days.Nasik-based National Horticultural Research And Development Foundation (NHRDF) acting Director P K Gupta said, ""The arrival of the Kharif onion is less at present and therefore prices are under pressure. The arrivals are expected to improve by end of the month and the prices will accordingly get corrected."" The kharif onion output is expected to be lower as acreage was down by 20-25 per cent because of less rains during the sowing period in key growing states Maharashtra, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, he said.Once the kharif arrival and later rabi onion crop hits the market, the retail price situation will automatically improve, he added."
5aeaaffd9855b7179ad6d888,Blame it on Govt for onion price hike,http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/odisha/2018/jan/12/blame-it-on-govt-for-onion-price-hike-1751593.html,2018-01-12,"By Express News ServiceBHUBANESWAR: Even as the wholesale price of onion in major vegetable mandis of the State remained stable at Rs 3,500 per quintal for over a week, the retail prices stayed firmly above Rs 50 a kg, thanks to inertia of the enforcement agencies of the Food Supplies and Consumer Welfare department.We fail to understand why retailers are selling onion at Rs 50 a kg when they buy it at Rs 35 a kg from the mandi. What is surprising is that the consumers are not protesting when the Government machinery has failed to control the soaring price by cracking down on unscrupulous traders, general secretary of Odisha Byabasai Mahasangha Sudhakar Panda said. Since the Government is keeping a tab on the prices of essential commodities on daily basis, it is their look out to ensure that commodities are made available to the consumers at reasonable prices at retails points.The market intelligence wing of the Food Supplies and Consumer Welfare department has the responsibility to impose stock limits on onion and crack down on hoarding. But nothing is happening for obvious reasons, he rued.Ideally, onion should be sold at Rs 40 a kg in the retail market as a margin of Rs 5 per kg is enough for the retailers to make a good profit, said Shakti Shankar Mishra, seceratry of the Aeiginia Potato Merchants Association.The source price of onion, Nasik in Maharashtra being the major supplier of the vegetable, is ruling high due to shortfall in production in Andhra Pradesh and Karanatak, the two other States which also meet Odishas demand. The onion production has fallen short by 8 to 10 per cent due to unseasonal rains in major producing States including Karanataka and Andhra Pradesh. The production of the vegetable this year is about 22 million tonne as against 24 million tonne last year, Panda said adding, the prices will cool down after arrival of the new harvest.While the daily requirement of edible bulb in the State is about 1,500 tonnes, there is a short supply of about 200-300 tonnes. Bhubaneswar, one of the major mandis of the State, is getting a normal supply of about 150 tonne every day, Mishra said."
5b2d6aea9855b723c6f45f7d,Onion prices crash by 50% at Lasalgaon,https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/mumbai/onion-prices-crash-by-50-at-lasalgaon-5046923/,2018-02-01,"Retail onion prices in most major cities in India were hovering between Rs 40-50 per kg during the later part of 2017 as well as during the start of the new year. Retail onion prices in most major cities in India were hovering between Rs 40-50 per kg during the later part of 2017 as well as during the start of the new year.From Rs 3,150 per quintal at the start of the month, onion prices in Lasalgaon, Indias largest wholesale onion market, have come down by nearly 50 per cent to sell at Rs 1,650 per quintal on Wednesday.The steep fall in prices, which has affected farmers, is being blamed on the glut in the market from major onion producing centres as well as the $ 700 Minimum Export Price stipulated by the government which has made exports unviable.Retail onion prices in most major cities in India were hovering between Rs 40-50 per kg during the later part of 2017 as well as during the start of the new year. The government, in order to regulate the domestic market, decided to set up a Minimum Export Price of $ 850 per tonne to ensure that the bulk of the crop was diverted to the domestic market.However, with an increased supply in the domestic market, prices began to flounder. During the start of January, the modal price for onion in Lasalgaon was Rs 3,150 per quintal. It has since been on the decline and hit its lowest mark for the month on Wednesday.While this price is substantially higher than the Rs 600 per quintal witnessed during the same period last year, farmers had been complaining that the government was trying to regulate prices when they had a chance to earn money.Earlier this month, a delegation from the Lasalgaon Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) had met Minister for Marketing Subhash Deshmukh asking him to lobby with the centre for removal of MEP. Their contention was that the MEP, which is the benchmark price below which no shipments can take place, and is meant to increase domestic supplies, was making exports unviable and would pinch farmers as excess production of onion would hit the local markets this year.The Central government on January 10 brought down the MEP to $ 700. Farmers, however, continue to be angry.The government has moved in when it is our time to make some money, Keshav Kakad, an onion farmer from Niphad, said.Maharashtra, which contributes nearly 35 per cent of the total onion in the country, harvests onions thrice a year from October to May. The kharif and the late kharif crop called Pol and Rangda is harvested from December to March. However its yield and storage quality are not very good, forcing farmers to dispose the crop quickly, creating a huge glut in the market in January and February. The high-quality rabi product marked by a higher yield and longer storage capacity is harvested in April -May and can be sold at a relatively easy pace till October.Due to seasonal variation in production the months of October, November, December and January are known to be the time when onion prices reach a high, while in March, April, May and June, the prices dip. However, due to the recent climatic changes in Maharashtra, prices appear to have been thrown out of gear. The farmers and traders of Lasalgaon believe that the rule of free market should be applicable with demand and supply dynamics determining the prices of agricultural commodities.For all the latest Mumbai News, download Indian Express App"
5aeae8af9855b73f522c4a90,Budget 2018: Jaitley Promises Farmers 50% Returns over Cultivation Costs,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/budget-2018-jaitley-promises-farmers-50-returns-over-cultivation-costs/story-C5oo7V5HT9c9vRjF5CrNlM.html,2018-02-02,"Kicking off with a burst of announcements for the farm sector, finance minister Arun Jaitley on Thursday said the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government would deliver on its promise of ensuring 50% returns for farmers, seeking to address rural angst due to collapsing prices.In his budget speech, Jaitley said federally determined minimum support prices (MSPs) for summer-sown (kharif) crops this year would be set at 1.5 times the cost of cultivation, which translates to 50% returns.This has been a key demand by protesting farmers in several agriculturally developed states, such as Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh.Jaitley surprised critics by declaring that his government had already adhered to this pricing benchmark for most crops in the ongoing rabi-sown (winter) season. He said this would be henceforth applied for the rest of crops. The government has decided to keep MSP for the all unannounced crops of kharif at least at one and half times of their production cost, he said.The finance minister did not announce any specific price-deficit payment scheme to compensate farmers directly for market losses when prices dip below MSPs, as was widely anticipated. Such a scheme is already being implemented in Madhya Pradesh. He, instead, said that Niti Ayog would soon come out with a foolproof mechanism on how to compensate farmers when prices crash.The budget announcement comes amid a rough patch in the agriculture sector, forecast to grow just 2.1% in 2017-18, as against 4.9% in the previous year. The announcement of 50% returns over costs set off a flurry of debate on the fine print, with farm leaders wondering which of the two measures of cultivation costs  the so-called C2 or A2 + FL  the government would adopt. Jaitley did not specify the measure that will be used.C2 is a more comprehensive measure of a farmers cultivation costs, which includes imputed rental value of land, depreciation and interests on capital. These are not part of the A2+FL, a narrower measure that includes input costs and imputed value of only family labour.The crux of the battle on prices boils down to the governments definition on cost of productionThe government seems to have chosen a lower cost measure so that it can declare that it is already providing cost + 50% in this rabi, said Kiran Vissa of the Rythu Swarajya Vedika, part of a platform of farmer organisations. He said when PM Narendra Modi had promised 50% returns in his election campaign, MSPs were already giving higher returns than under Modis tenure.In 2007, the MS Swaminathan Committee had recommended 50% returns for crops, which the BJPs 2014 poll manifesto adopted. In the para containing the specific recommendation, the Swaminathan report said MSP should be 50% over costs of cultivation, not specifying which measure. But in its annexure, the report used C2 costs to calculate net farmer returns.Economist Ashok Gulati told HT that for rabi crops, the MSP was closer towards 50% of costs. In wheat, it is in the region of 44%-45%, but in other crops it is just 20%-30%. The real challenge is for kharif crops. In paddy, MSPs and returns are not more than 10%-12%, he said. If the government actually sets MSPs at 1.5 times the C2 costs, then it would also mean a huge jump in the food subsidy bill and make Indias produce expensive in the exports market, he said.The budget announced a new scheme called Operation Greens to promote value addition for tomato, onion and potato. This would be similar to Operation Flood that revolutionsed the dairy sector, Jaitley said. Two funds to boost fisheries and animal husbandry were allotted Rs10,000.The budget also set a target of Rs11 lakh crore for agriculture credit in 2018-19, a 10% rise. Jaitley said 22,000 new and existing rural marketplaces would be developed to give farmers access to buyers. Tenant farmers would be made eligible for farm loans under a new policy, he said, adding a liberalised farm-exports regime was in the works. Various ministries will have Rs14.34 lakh crore in all to create rural jobs and infrastructure.With a view to boost food processing, which can improve commodity prices, allocation to the food processing ministry was being doubled from Rs715 crore in 2017-18 to Rs1,400 crore in 2018-19, Jaitley said."

While consumers will feel the pinch, farmers will fetch good prices.The average wholesale onion prices increased to Rs 2,075 per quintal on Monday as against Rs 1,451 per quintal on Friday. The minimum and maximum prices were recorded at Rs 1,000 and Rs 2,200 per quintal on Monday. Around 15,000 quintals was auctioned at Lasalgaon on the day.The Centre had imposed an MEP of $850 a tonne on November 23 last year following the rise in wholesale prices. The average wholesale prices had hit Rs 70 per kg in retail markets of metro cities like Mumbai and Delhi. After MEP was imposed, they had dropped by almost 50% in just a month from Rs 3,550 per quintal on January 5 to Rs 1,450 a quintal on February 2."
5aeacfcd9855b73f522c38e7,Low demand and ample supply: Chances of price recovery bleak for tur growers,http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/mumbai/low-demand-and-ample-supply-chances-of-price-recovery-bleak-for-tur-growers-5070634/,2018-02-20,"Tur continues to trade much below the government declared Minimum Support Price (MSP) of Rs 5,400 per quintal. (Photo for representation) Tur continues to trade much below the government declared Minimum Support Price (MSP) of Rs 5,400 per quintal. (Photo for representation)There is no respite for tur growers from the vicious cycle of low prices this year as the pulse continues to trade much below the government declared Minimum Support Price (MSP) of Rs 5,400 per quintal. Huge carry-forward stock and absence of price parity in the export market, analysts said, would almost kill any chances of prices firming up later in the year. Like tur, chana whose harvest has started also faces a dim price prospect because of a bumper crop.Tur, a major kharif crop in the arid regions of Marathwada and Vidarbha, had slid way below its MSP last year because of a bumper yield. While the central and state government had waded in the procure tur at the MSP, the process was riddled with allegations of corruption at various levels. The price of the pulse has been well below MSP levels even before it started arriving in the markets. This despite a 20 per cent reduction in area of tur in the state for the kharif season of 2017-18.Maharashtra has reported 12.19 lakh hectares of tur cultivation in 2017-18 as compared to 15.32 lakh hectares in 2016-17. State government estimates say Maharashtra will produce around 9.83 lakh tonnes of tur this year. In view of the continuing low prices, Nafed through its agencies  the Maharashtra State Cooperative Marketing Federation and the Vidarbha Cooperative Marketing Federation (VCMF)  has started more than 180 procurement centres.Till about last week, the State Cooperative Marketing Federation had reported procurement of over 1 lakh quintals of tur. This year, the state is set to see more than 4.8 lakh tonnes of procurement under the Price Support Scheme (PSS). However, prices in the wholesale markets continue to be much lower than the declared MSP. At Laturs wholesale market, which sets the national trend for the pulse, the price is hovering between Rs 4,385-4,400 a quintal.Trade sources said chances of prices rising in the future were remote as the country has already 9 lakh tonnes of tur procured last year. To add to this stock, around 80,000 quintals of imported tur is lying unutilised in the godowns of importers. The state marketing federation has over 1 lakh tonnes of tur it procured last year. This the government is now releasing into the market for milling and offloading the daal in the open market.Traders said this would keep prices low in the months to come. Chances of export, market sources said, are dim given the Indian produce lacks price parity in the international market. Nitin Kalantri, CEO of Latur-based Kalantri Foods, called for steps to increase the demand for pulses. The government should include pulses in the mid-day meals and also take up campaigns to increase consumption of pulses by people, he said.An increase in demand will create newer avenues for the commodity and thus help firm up prices in the wholesale market. Similarly agro-analyst Deepak Chavan called for a five-point programme to increase consumption of pulses and help farmers get assured returns. Chavan suggested the inclusion of the old stock in the public distribution system as well as other government-run schemes like mid-day meals. Chavan too called for a campaign to help increase the consumption of pulses among the general public.At the farm gate-level, the government should take up projects to build small pulses godowns which will allow the farmer to store his produce, he said. Such on-field storage structures, Chavan said, has helped onion growers in Nashik to store their produce and offload it at better prices. Banks should provide finance for such structures, he said.For all the latest Mumbai News, download Indian Express App IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd"
5b2d54ba9855b723c6f45a30,Farmers across 100 villages grapple with crop diseases,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/farmers-across-100-villages-grapple-with-crop-diseases/articleshow/63020464.cms,2018-02-22,"PUNE: The recent, untimely rain and hail has not just destroyed crops but is causing an attack of various pests and diseases on the states rabi harvest.A report of the state agriculture department said over 100 villages had reported diseases on crops, particularly wheat, ragi, jowar, grams, maize and sugar cane, causing loss to farmers.The report, which is based on the agricultural situation in Maharashtra till February 16, stated that several divisions, including Nashik, Pune, and Aurangabad, experienced thunderstorm and unseasonal rain recently. Pests like Gram pod borer or Helicoverpa and other diseases have struck the gram crop in as many as 11 villages across Dhule, Nandurbar, and Jalgaon. The incidence of pests and diseases on gram has also crossed the economic threshold level (ETL) here. Crops like wheat, gram, jowar, maize have been affected by diseases and pests in this division.An economic threshold is the insects population level or extent of crop damage at which the value of the crop destroyed exceeds the cost of controlling the pest.In Pune division, gram crop in 32 villages across Ahmednagar and Solapur has been attacked by such pests currently. Here too, the incidence has crossed the economic threshold level. Crops such as wheat, gram, sugar cane and maize are expected to cause financial losses to growers due to pest attacks, the report said.Various rabi crops in as many as 19 villages in Latur, seven in Amravati and 41 in Nagpur, among others, are facing a similar situation due to the rain and hailstorm, with the incidence of pests and diseases crossing the threshold at these locations as well.Director of MAHA Farmers Producer Company Limited Amit Naphade , told TOI that whenever there is a variation in weather  sudden change from cold to warm, unseasonal rain, or no rain in the monsoon months  the incidence of pests and diseases on crops increases.Such changes are ideal for pests and diseases to flourish, since the crops weaken at these times and become susceptible to pest attacks. Most districts in Vidarbha, Marathwada, and some in north Maharashtra, are facing increased pest attacks following the recent unseasonal rain, with between 30% and 60% wheat crop getting destroyed not just because of rain but pest attack and diseases, said Naphde.Farmer Purushottam Mangte Patil from Vyala village in Balapur district of Akola said that had the unseasonal rain and hail not affected the region, crop health and production would have been 100% this rabi season. But now, various pests are hounding the crops, he said.Buldhana farmer Milind Pachpande said that between 25% to 50% of onion crop in his field is facing pest attacks. The onion crop is close to rotting in many areas, he said."

The farms floor is iridescent-green and spongy as you walk it. Its actually a month-old black gram or channa crop. Ram risks losing this bucolic haven measuring 3.72 hectares to his creditors.A loan of Rs 3 lakh taken on Kisan Credit Card from the Punjab National Banks Badalwas branch in Sikar district turned into a Rs 4.5 lakh monster after repeated defaults.It was like a noose around my neck, he says, showing off a notice issued on February 9, 2017 from a local official in Dhod tehsil to auction his land to the highest bidder. An auction fee of 5% was also added to the outstanding. Then, the bidding took place.One-third of the total land holding  which is Rams share in the family property -- was auctioned at Rs 18 lakh to the highest bidder, Nandlal Chawla from a neighbouring town.Just as the auction proceedings were being closed, Ram showed up to pay the debt. He had collected the outstanding by begging and borrowing from everyone he could ask for help. Effectively, that was a loan to repay another loan. At the behest of local elders, the auction was reversed, he says.Ram isnt off the hook yet. Now, I worry about paying all these creditors who helped me save my land from Punjab National Bank, he says.Farmers in many states have got into precisely these sorts of debt traps  a generic problem caused by high costs of cultivation and falling returns from agriculture. In state after state, governments have succumbed to pressure and waived off farm loans or are considering doing so. Maharashtra, Punjab, Madhya Pradesh, and Karnataka have waived off loans, or partially written off loans, or part of the interests.On February 12, Rajasthan announced it would partially write off loans owed by small and marginal farmers worth Rs 8000 crore. Its decision was forced by an 11-day protest by farmers in Sikar, 200 km from capital Jaipur from September 1-13 2017, last year.History shows that an agitation launched from Sikar never fails. It has always spelt trouble for governments. It is a revolutionary place, says Amra Ram, the leader of All-India Kisan Sabha, who led the agitation. The siege was intense. Highways were blocked. Traders shuttered shops and transactions in the Sikar farmers market ground to a halt. Thousands from all over the politically influential Shekhawati region  comprising the three big districts of Churu, Sikar and Jhunjhunu  joined in. Amra Ram says the loan waiver will cover only 2% of the farmers caught in debt traps.In 2000, the Kisan Sabha forced the government to release more power to farms. In 2015, it forced the then government to roll back electricity tariff hike after a 15-day protest, just like it forced the current government to defer a decision to raise rural electrify prices in 2016.What made last years agitation successful was that everybody joined us, even local DJs, with their fan following, says Ram Ratan, a prominent farm leader from Sikar. DJs bring to mind hip jockeys in city nightclubs, but in the Shekhawati region, they are local Jat youth who play ear-numbing music in local marriages, religious festivals, birthdays and other rural events from atop specially modified pickup trucks. When harvests are good, they make good money. When onion prices crashed in Sikar  the biggest growing district in Rajasthan  even DJs were without business.The Rajasthan governments loan waiver, limited to small and marginal farmers, is a follow up on an agreement it had signed with protesting Sikar farmers.It promises to pay off Rs 50,000 of each small farmers total outstanding on short-duration loans taken from cooperative banks. The first test of whether this has managed to placate farmers took place on February 22. The main farmers body that staged the massive agitation last year, forcing the government to accept its demands, called for a similar agitation on that day. It believed the waiver wasnt enough because it takes care of just 1 of its 11 demands. Its major demands were a total loan waiver, not partial, of all categories of farmers and a complete freeing up of cattle trade in the state.Despite a loan waiver, hundreds of farmers blocked the Bikaner-Agra national highway 52 near Sikar town on Thursday. Two days ago, the government arrested the national secretary of Kisan Sabha, Amra Ram and his colleague Pema Ram, to pre-empt the protests. Our leaders were arrested when they were on a padyatra (protest march) in Jaipur, Ratan, their colleague said.With elections due later this year in the state, the government is watching the farm sector closely.We need to understand that Rajasthan is neither Gujarat, nor Maharashtra. Rajasthans economy is mostly about tourism, mines and agriculture. I dont think disruption from policies such as the Goods and Services Tax is an issue here unlike in Gujarat, which is a textile hub, says Prof. Sanjay Lodha of Udaipurs Mohanlal Sukhadia University. The plight of farmers is because they havent been getting good prices, Lodha says.Just a few years ago, things were smooth-sailing. The rough patch in Rajasthans agriculture began roughly four years ago. Incredibly, a fracking boom in faraway US -- which saw a surge in natural gas production to offset rising oil prices -- brought prosperity to Rajasthans poorest farmers.Fracking is a method of extracting shale gas by pumping high-pressured gas into the ground, which requires a processed powder called guar gum made from guar (cluster beans). Rajasthan is Indias largest gaur producer, with a share of 84% in national output. At its peak, the total export value of Indias guar gum  most of it from Rajasthan  rose to Rs 21,287 crore from about Rs 121 crore in 2003-04. In 2016-17, this came down to just Rs 3,106.62, an 85% fall.The boom ended but farmers got used to better lifestyles. They bought cars, tractors and jewellery. The boom was over in 2012-13. What followed were two years of drought beginning 2014-15. Farmers were already in distress. They got angry when they heard the government was going to increase power tariffs, says retired bureaucrat Shankarlal Choudhury.The pastoral economy has also been hit by self-styled cow vigilantes.Laxman Singh, a livestock farmer in Dujod village, says income from cattle trade has dwindled because of cow vigilantism. Milch cattle were like ATMs. If I need money, I just sell them. Theres hardly any buyer now, he said. The government has tried to do its bit. Agriculture minister Prabhulal Saini says the government procured pulses, soyabean and peanuts worth Rs 2,800 crore at minimum support prices.Rajasthan has also promised 6 months of free cow feed to cow shelters worth Rs 50 crore and help set up biogas plants in 25 identified large gaushalas with a subsidy of Rs 40 lakh for each. It is banking on these measures ahead of the crucial poll that will decide the fate of the Vasundhara Raje-led government.The farmers are still unhappy lot. There are stuck on a demand for a total loan waiver.

Onion price on Monday nearly halved to Rs 150-170 per 20kg from Saturdays rate of Rs 350-300 per 20kg. Farmers refused to sell their produce at such a low rate.The average daily arrival in Bhavnagar market is 1.5 lakh bags (50kg each). During the November to April season, an average of 25 lakh bags to 30 lakh bags come for auction at the marketing yard. This season, onion was cultivated in 24,800 hectare against 27,000 hectare last year.D S Royla, secretary of Bhavnagar marketing yard, said, One of the main reasons for the drastic fall is heavy influx of onions from Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh in the domestic market. Earlier, onions from Gujarat were going to southern and northern states but now southern states get onions from Maharashtra, while northern states are covered by the onions from Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan.According to market yard authorities, on Saturday, there were 1 lakh unsold bags and on Monday 80,000 more bags arrived for auction creating an imbalance in demand and supply. G Ramani , former secretary of Mahuva market yard in Bhavnagar, said, Sudden arrival of huge stock in the market led to drastic fall. Till last week, because of marriage season farmers did not get labourers to bring the commodity to the market yard. Also, with the Holi festival during the weekend followed by marriage season again, farmers want to sell off their produce to get more cash ahead of the festival. This has led to fall in prices.However, former chairman of Bhavnagar Market Yard Bhikhabhai Zazadia feels the fall was a mere correction in prices. The price was very high even after the season started in November. Price of Rs 300 to 400 per 20kg is the price for Diwali season. When the new season starts in November, price falls, but this year it remained high till February. So, there was a sudden fall which was bound to happen.Farmers, however, disagreed with Zazadias argument. Ramji Mangukia, a farmer of Tana village of Shihor Taluka in Bhavnagar, said, Considering the input cost of seeds, pesticides and labour we cant afford to sell onions at this low price. He had come with 98 bags (20kg each) of onion.Deepak Malani, chairman of Amreli APMC, said, Even white onion price was down because of fall in export demand. There are few dehydration plants which have the monopoly in deciding price of white onions as it is mainly for export, while red onions are for local consumption."

There is demand for 20 tonnes per day in Kaleswara Rao market, and we only received seven tonnes till the third week of February.Arrival of onion from Kurnool has increased recently, and prices are falling, he said.

Green chillies cost only Rs 15 a kg, she said.Officials of agriculture marketing department said the fall in veggie prices is because of huge supply from local yards.

The arrival of summer onions has increased to 40% of the total arrivals. Also, there has been an increase in arrival of onions in other markets. This has led to a drop in demand from Nashik .The price trend is expected to be downwards for the next two-three weeks considering the huge arrival of onions. Farmers cant store kharif crop as its shelf life is less than a month. Hence, the prices are expected to drop to Rs 750 per quintal, said an APMC official.The minimum and maximum wholesale prices were Rs 700 and Rs 1,080 per quintal, respectively, on Wednesday, when around 20,000 quintals of onions were auctioned.The drop in the wholesale prices reflected in the retail market where the prices have dropped from Rs 40 a kg to Rs 20 a kg in a month.In a bid to stop the fall in prices, the Union government had removed the minimum export price on onion last month. However, the prices continued to decline.Meanwhile, the harvest of summer onions is expected to pick up in the next two weeks. The late kharif harvest is expected to continue till Mach-end while summer harvest till April-end."

Onion prices have recorded a correction at a time when the central government has announced a special initiative for the crop along with tomato and potato.Onion prices have dipped again in the wholesale markets with the bulb trading below Rs 1,000 per quintal. A bumper crop in Maharashtra as well as early arrival of rabi onions in the wholesale markets of states like Gujarat and Rajasthan led to a steep price correction which traders say is likely to remain for the rest of the season. On Wednesday, the average price of onions at Lasalagon wholesale market in Nashik was Rs 788 per quintal  one third of the price it fetched in January. Onion prices have been showing a downward trend since the beginning of March. In most wholesale markets, average traded price was below Rs 1,000 per quintal.This is in sharp contrast to the price trend a few weeks back when prices were hovering between Rs 1,500-2,000 per quintal. Prices had crossed the Rs 3,000 mark in November, December and January which spiked the prices in the retail markets as well. The eight-month bull run, farmers had said, had come after almost a 15 month slump which saw farmers selling onions at throw away prices of Rs 300-5,00 quintals. The price slump is due a bumper summer or rabi crop which has started arriving in the markets. Maharashtra has reported around 3.5 lakh hectares under summer onion this year as against the 3 lakh hectares last year. Also onion crop area has increased in neighbouring states of Rajasthan, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh. Maharashtra accounts for almost 60 per cent of the summer crop.Farmers normally store their produce in moisture and heat proof structures called Kanda chawl to dispose them of later in the season. Rabi onions normally feed the market from March till the arrival of the new kharif crop later in September.Jaydutt Holkar, chairman of Lasalgaons wholesale market, said that the bumper arrivals have brought down prices. Arrival is huge and thus prices have come down. We fear prices might go down further in view of the good crop expected, he said.Onion prices have recorded a correction at a time when the central government has announced a special initiative for the crop along with tomato and potato. Under Operation Green, the government wishes to re-construct the success in the dairy sector under Operation Flood. However, as prices come down, traders say exports have also taken a hit despite nil minimum export price (MEP).

Nearly 20,000 tons of white onion is lying at farmers end.White onion is dehydrated and exported in European countries. Out of the nearly 100 dehydration plants in Mahuva, 70 are in dysfunctional condition. Currently, farmers get Rs 60 to 70 per 20 kg, however, their production cost is Rs 140. According to farmers, they are booking losses in the prices for the last three years as a result of which the production this year has reduced by 25% compared to last year. This year, the production of white onion is nearly 45,000 ton, which was 60,000 ton last year.Chairman of Mahua market yard Ghanshyam Patel said, White onion is only exported and there is very little domestic consumption. The owners of dehydration plants compete with each other and sell onions at lowest price in the international market, which is US $900 to US $1200 per ton. However, the onions from other countries fetch between US $1,500 and US $1,800. We want government to fix minimum export price (MEP) for onion for the benefit of farmers.India exports 40% of worlds requirement of onion and its the second biggest exporter of onion after America, which sends out 45% of its produce. The export business of onion is centralized in Mahuva and white onion of Nashik also come to dehydration plants here.Former president of All India Dehydration Vegetables Association Vitthal Koradia said, We export 50,000 to 60,000 tons per year, but since last 2-3 years, we have over stocked because the prices are low. Last years stock is also lying in the cold storage and nearly 25,000 tons is unsold for which we are searching market. Our 70% plants are non-functional because they have no capacity to bear more loss.Traders wants government to implement pre-Goods and Service Tax (GST) policy for export. Before the implementation of GST, we used to get 7% transportation assistance, which has now been reduced to 3%. As a result, the transportation cost is increased. Traders who have huge stock are also paying interest on finance, rent and electricity bill of cold storage. We are also facing tough competition from China and America."

(Image used for representational purpose)A little over a month since the Union Budget declared a special Operation Green for tomato, onion and potato growers, prices of at least the first two produces seem to be touching an all-time low in the state. With wholesale prices of both the commodities going down to single digits, most farmers are staring at major agrarian distress. In Maharashtra, the wholesale markets of Junnar in Pune and Pimpalgaon in Nashik are major hubs of tomato trade.On Friday, the Pimpalgaons market had recorded the arrival of 695 crates of tomatoes, and the average traded price per crate was Rs 61. With a crate containing 20 kg of tomato, the average price per kg works out to be Rs 3 at the wholesale markets. Similarly, at the Narayangaon wholesale market, 6,330 crates of the produce had arrived, and the average traded price of a crate was Rs 60, which also translates to Rs 3 per kg. Junnar is normally the hub of summer tomatoes, while Pimpalgaon mostly gets the the winter crop.Onions, which till recently, were trading above the Rs 20 per kg mark, has also started trading below the Rs 10 per kg at most wholesale markets. At Lasalgaons wholesale market in Nashiks Niphad taluka, the average traded price of onion was Rs 7.54 per kg, with the market recording the arrival of 15,140 quintals of the bulb. Just about a month ago, onions were trading at Rs 15.50 per kg at this market, a steady fall of over 50 per cent.Maharashtra has seen a 10-15 per cent rise in area under cultivation for both onions and tomatoes. Shriram Ghadhave, president of the Vegetable Growers Association of India (VGAI), attributed this growth to the good rainfall received in the state last year. As against the 2.5 lakh hectares of tomato area, this year, we have about 3 lakh hectares under the crop. Even places like Beed, Aurangabad and Parbhani, which normally do not see cultivation of summer tomatoes, have planted the crop, he said.A similar situation has resulted in the steep price fall in case of onions also.

The farmers demanded crop loan waiver and purchase of crops at minimum support price, among others. The state government later waived farm loans up to Rs 50,000, and started the process to procure crops at MSP.Sikar district is a hub of onion cultivation in Rajasthan and this year the production is expected to be about 4.50 to 5 lakh metric tonnes as against states total output of 12.80 lakh metric tonnes. There are about 50,000 onion growers in the region.With farmers not getting reasonable prices for onion, many of them have dumped the produce at Sikar mandi as they await buyers, AIKS leaders said.As against the price of Rs 10-12 per kg two weeks ago, the farmers are now getting Rs 3-4 per kg at the krishi upaj mandi, AIKS leader Amra Ram said. At times, there are no buyers at even these prices. The input cost for growing onions is about Rs 8 per kg.Officials said prices crash whenever there is a glut in the market and will pick up soon. This year the onion cultivation area in Sikar district is estimated at 13,000 to 14,000 hectares while the yield is 350 quintals per hectare. The prices crash whenever there is a glut, but will recover when the supply to other states pick up, said B S Yadav, Sikar assistant director, horticulture.Onion production in Rajasthan in 2017-18 has been estimated at 1.28 million tonnes. The state contributes about 6% of Indias onion production estimated at 21.4 million tonnes in 2017-18.Only a few days ago, onions were selling at Rs 10 kg and then fell to Rs 7, and now to Rs 5. We are not able to recover our input cost that is about Rs 8 per kg, said Satyajit Bithare, a farmer in Rasidpura village.The governments move to build an exclusive onion mandi at Rasidpura village in Sikar has been delayed. The other major onion hub in the state is Nagaur where the onion prices have also crashed.Prices at Maharashtras Lasalgaon mandi near Nashik, have also crashed with rising arrivals, but are ruling higher than what the farmers are getting in Sikar.Prices rose after last August, with delay in kharif crop arrivals and estimates of lower production in 2017-18 by one million tonne.

Rajasthan farmers are facing financial difficulties as they are not getting fair price for their produce  gram, mustard, wheat and garlic.In the last four years, the BJP government in Rajasthan stopped additional bonus to farmers on purchase of wheat, started by the previous Congress government, Gehlot said. Our government in 2012-13 for the first time gave Rs 100 per quintal bonus to farmers on purchase of wheat; for this, a grant of Rs 200 crore was given. In 2013-14, additional bonus of Rs 150 per quintal was given on wheat purchase.There has been a bumper production of gram in Kota division, which the farmers want to sell on support price, Gehlot said. In the absence of adequate arrangements to purchase gram on support price, farmers have to sell gram at Rs 3500 per quintal and mustard at Rs 3600 per quintal. The support price of gram is Rs 4400 and of mustard is Rs 4000.Farmers who sold moong (green gram) on support price are waiting for payment and making rounds of the Rajasthan state cooperative federation and banks, Gehlot alleged.After Maharashtra, Rajasthan produces maximum onion. Farmers are already in debt and fall in prices of onion and garlic has added to their worry. In view of farmers interest, the state government should purchase onion on fair price, Gehlot said."
5aeaa5309855b73f522c19c4,2019 polls will be fought on farmers’ issues: Maharashtra MP Raju Shetti,http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/mumbai/2019-polls-will-be-fought-on-farmers-issues-swabhimani-pakhsha-mp-raju-shetti-5119014/,2018-04-01,"The Bills, which will be introduced as Private Members Bills by Swabhimani Pakhsha MP Raju Shetti (above) and CPI(M) MP K K Ragesh. The Bills, which will be introduced as Private Members Bills by Swabhimani Pakhsha MP Raju Shetti (above) and CPI(M) MP K K Ragesh.Earlier this week, leaders from more than 30 major opposition parties had assembled in the national capital, at the invitation of the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee (AIKSCC), to deliberate over two Bills that the committee had prepared. The Bills, which will be introduced as Private Members Bills by Swabhimani Pakhsha MP Raju Shetti and CPI(M) MP K K Ragesh, call for a complete loan waiver for farmers and farmers right to guaranteed remunerative minimum support price for agricultural produce.Both the Bills came about after deliberation between 193 farmers organisations. Shetti, a two-time MP from Kolhapurs Hatkhanagale constituency, spoke to Partha Sarathi Biswas about ongoing efforts towards building a farmers vote bankWhat is the significance of the whole opposition coming together for farmers causes, and is this the first time such a mobilisation has happened?Attempts to create a political consensus around agrarian issues have been made in the past, but such efforts were not successful. The creation of a vote bank, or even political dialogue, around the subject is difficult for many reasons. In India, the fragmentation of farmers is myriad, and it is difficult for them to come together. Taking advantage of this, political parties have, so far, refused to address farmers as a single unit or a vote bank, and instead, kept them divided on the lines of caste, creed and region, among others.For the political leadership, the angst of the consumer is more important than the distress of the farmer for the simple reason that the former is united. For example, if prices of onions cross a certain threshold, then consumers from Kashmir to Kanyakumari will be united, but the same will not be the case if wholesale prices of onions fall. Then, only the onion grower would become vocal. This lack of cohesion between the growers is a major hurdle for the formation of a farmers vote bank, or for political parties to take up agrarian issues at the national level. So, this would be the first time that all farmers leaders have come together on the same platform and compelled political parties to listen. In the run-up to the 2014 general elections, issues like black money and corruption were on the agenda, but the 2019 elections will be fought on farmers issues.How was this unity achieved? What were the common causes that made the farmers unite?Under the banner of AIKSCC, farmers leaders have been working towards getting all farmers together on common issues. The task was challenging, given the deep and often rigid differences. Our committee had representation from groups who were opposed to globalisation, as well as from groups that welcomed it. During discussions, two points emerged on which all of us agreed: The demand for complete loan waiver for farmers and the implementation of the M S Swaminathan Commissions recommendations, which assured remunerations equal to 1.5 times the production cost. During discussions, farmer leaders came to the conclusion that the present indebtedness was due to poor prices. So, till remunerative returns are assured, we will not be free of the vicious cycle of unending loans. The incidents of farmers being shot dead at Mandsaur, Madhya Pradesh, had also acted as a clarion call for all farmers leaders to forget their differences and join forces. We understood that if we remained fragmented, we would not be able to get justice for our cause.Our demand for loan waiver is based on facts. Recently, the government has announced the Seventh Pay Commission, and government servants were to get arrears as well. In our case, the farmers are in debt as they have not been able to get remunerative prices. The recommendations of the Swaminathan Commission were given in 2005, but not a single government has implemented them. So, farmers are asking for a complete loan waiver.Why were only opposition leaders invited for the discussions? What is the next step?Our movement is for farmers, and we will go with any political party which assures us of meeting our two main demands. In a democratic set up, the present day opposition party is the future government, and thus, we need to maintain a dialogue with them to ensure our demands are met. The present government has, unfortunately, let farmers down, and we cannot believe them till they directly implement our suggestions.How will you keep the momentum of the movement going till the elections?In Maharashtra, I will soon embark on a state-wide yatra to raise awareness amongst farmers. With prices of each and every commodity at an all-time low, we will be talking to farmers and telling them not to get disheartened. We will tell our farmers that we are trying to create a viable alternative to the BJP, and that they should support us. At this hour of need, we will tell them to be with us and not to take the extreme step of committing suicide.Farmers leaders have realised that while we are not strong enough to form a government, we can play the crucial role of a pivot, and swing the balance of power. All our efforts will now be directed towards strengthening that role.For all the latest Mumbai News, download Indian Express App"

They came in a fleet of lumbering tractors, around 80,000 peasants, cattle, hay to be used as bedding and foodgrains to see them through an unrelenting protest.It was the scene of a spectacular rural takeover of Delhi. Tens of thousands of farmers erected tents, slept, cooked food and ate in the open as well as defecated there, laying siege to the Boat Club lawns, a stones throw from Parliament. They vowed to not budge until their demands for higher sugarcane prices and a waiver of electricity charges were met.Tikaits Bhartiya Kisan Union successfully extracted key concessions from the then Rajiv Gandhi-led government.Farm protests have seldom been so strong, but in Maharashtra in March, 35,000 farmers walked 180 km on a long march to reach Mumbai from the states Nashik district seeking loan waivers  a turnout not seen since the days of Tikaits agitation.Farm loan waivers have now become the new rallying point for farmers movement because there are just losses, losses everywhere, says Amra Ram, a leader of the All-India Kisan Sabha, the organisation that led the long march.Under the NDA government, farmers havent fared too well due to a combination of factors, including two successive droughts and a slump in global food prices. This has led farmers groups and lobbies to re-energise themselves around two key demands  loan waivers and profitable prices.Dont call it a protest. Ours is a political movement of farmers, says Kedar Sirohi, the Indore-based social-media savvy leader of the Aam Kisan Union (General Farmers Union).Before Tikait, there was another tall peasant leader in Chaudhary Charan Singh, a former chief minister of Uttar Pradesh (UP). His biographer Paul Brass, a professor at the University of Washington, writes in An Indian Political Life that Charan Singh was devoted throughout his political career to the interests of the peasantry.According to Brass, Singh, a known detractor of Nehru, sowed the seeds of a strong farmers lobby in north India by first dissenting against the Congress 1959 Nagpur Resolution on Agriculture, which advocated collectivisation and a cooperative model for the farm sector.The Nagpur Resolution was the most significant agrarian programme formulated by the Congress since the abolition of zamindari in several States, wrote Walter Hauser in a January 1959 piece in The Economic and Political Weekly, analysing Singhs role. Singh contended that cooperatives will lead to bigness and that this, with mechanized agriculture, would result in a decrease in per capita production rather than an increase, Hauser writes.Building on his peasant support base, Charan Singh went on to become prime minister.Read: Agriculture not always a dead end: Here are young, successful farmers who made the cutThe green revolution of 1960s saw farmers prosper and emerge as a class of bullock capitalists, a term coined by American political scientists Lloyd I. Rudolph and Susan Rudolph to describe the empowered Indian agrarian class. Bullock capitalists were well-to-do enough to raise their voice politically, but werent fully capitalist farmers, the Rudolphs logic went.This was followed by the rise of powerful farmer organisations. These included Rajya Ryot Sangha in Karnataka, the Bharatiya Kisan Union in UP and Punjab as well as the Tamil Nadu Agriculturists Association in Tamil Nadu and the Shetkari Sanghatana in Maharashtra.A new era of social-media-enabled farm movement has now taken over.As it heads into a crucial general election due next year, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has promised a slew of measures to quell farmer protests, including prices that are at least 50% over production costs.The Congress has promised a fresh loan waiver if voted to power like the one it announced in 2008 (and which played a part in its return to power in 2009).The BJP-ruled states of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, UP and Congress-ruled Punjab have already announced loan waivers, forced by protests.Maharashtra (also ruled by the BJP) did so too.Loan waivers are a pressing demand because the single biggest cause of agrarian distress is indebtedness. Farmers take loans to buy inputs such as seeds and irrigation machinery. Many of these farmers get into debt traps when crops fail or prices fall.The Situation Assessment Surveys of the National Sample Survey Organisation (NSSO, 2013) has reconfirmed the situation analysed in 2003 by the NSSOs 59th round of indebtedness of farm households. It showed that 52% of farm households in India are in debt.Loan waivers could have a bearing on the combined fiscal deficit of states. According to India Ratings and Research, farm debt waivers announced by five states together are likely to widen the combined fiscal deficit of states by ?107700 crore. Bankers have argued against farm loan waivers because they are no panacea and could affect credit growth.According to Reserve Bank of India data, bad loans in agriculture have increased by ?11,400-crore in 2017 to over ?60,000 crore, a jump of 23%, from 2016.From 2012-13, the year before the BJP government took office, till 2016-17, bad loans in the agriculture sector have increased 142.74%. The biggest defaults were during in 2016-17, suggesting a worsening of agrarian distress.RBI data further shows that compared to 20.83% defaults by corporate borrowers, defaults by farmers stood at only 6% of their total outstanding.This shows that farmers dont willfully default. Why dont they catch the bigger thieves? asks Ram of the All India Kisan Sabha.Agricultural economist AV Manjunatha of the Bangalore-based Institute of Social and Economic Change, who carried out an all-India study on farmer suicides, says farmers in real distress do need some sort of system to report distress. They also need facilities to negotiate loan restructuring. These could be adopted as policy solutions, he said.A new phase of farmers mobilisation has put both state and central governments on a tight leash. Reforms in markets and other structural measures for a better farming future dont appeal as much as loan waivers.They put my land on notice for auction. Its the only thing I have. Only a loan waiver can save me, says Tulchha Ram, an onion grower from Rajasthan Sikars district."

I will put up a shop, sell tea or lease out my land, but I wont farm anymore, said Khandbahale, who owns three acres of land.In June last year, Khandbahale was one of the thousands of farmers in Maharashtra who took to the streets to protest against the agrarian crisis the state is battling. One of the central demands of the protesters was a complete loan waiver.As supply of vegetables and milk to the cities stopped, the two-day strike forced chief minister Devendra Fadnavis to announce a farm loan waiver worth Rs 34,000 crore, a demand he had resisted since 2014.Less than a year after the strike and the waiver  up to Rs 1.50 lakh per family  farmers remain unimpressed. In Nasik and Ahmednagar districts, which bore the brunt of the protests, farmers say the waiver hasnt helped ease their struggle.Bowing to pressure The Maharashtra govt announced a loan waiver last June. Farmers say it hasnt helped ease their struggle so far Rs 34,000 cr farm loan waiver was announced by the state government after protests by farmers in June 2017 Rs 1.5 lakh per family cap has been put on the loan waiver. This includes principal and interest amount, crop loans as well as mid-term loans from 2009 to June 2016 The scheme had three components  besides the Rs 1.5 lakh waiver, it offered a one-time settlement option for those whose loans were farm loan waiver was announced by the state government after protests by farmers in June 2017per family cap has been put on the loan waiver.

Out of these, 3.038 million have applied for a full waiver and remaining for the incentive cash amount. Another Rs 10,000 crore has been budgeted for the waiver.Khandbahale owes Rs 8.5 lakh to a bank in Nasik. He can benefit from the Rs 1.5 lakh waiver only after he pays the remaining amount he owes. I dont have Rs 7 lakh in hand, why would I keep incurring more debt if I had the money? I may have to sell off some of my land to make that last payment to the bank. We dont need waivers. We can repay our loans if we get assured prices for our produce, he said.In Putamba village of Ahmednagar district, ground zero of the last years strike, farmers remain disaffected.The loan waiver helps banks more than us. So, the government should stop pretending they have done something big for farmers. If they want to help, then they should increase minimum support prices (MSP), procure the produce from us, said Salim Shaikh, an onion farmer from the village, who may not be able to take advantage of the waiver. This year, his income from soyabean and onion has been minimal. He owes a nationalised bank Rs 3.5 lakh he borrowed as a mid-term loan and Rs 2 lakh as a crop loanThe governments list of beneficiaries shows Maharashtra has 1 million farmers like Khandbahale and Shaikh who owe more than Rs 1.50 lakh to banks. Such farmers have been offered a one-time settlement (OTS)pay off the remaining amount to the bank and get a Rs 1.50 lakh waiver. Not many farmers are in a position to take up this offer.Shaikhs neighbour Rajendra Dhakchaule, a marginal farmer with just two acres of cultivable land, can repay most of his Rs 1.70 lakh debt with the waiver. But his worries dont end with this.I had taken a loan of Rs 3.5 lakh for a tractor and under pressure collected money from a money lender to pay off this loan. I may get some respite due to the loan waiver but thats fleeting help. The ground situation for farmers like me is unsustainable, he says, breaking down.This year, the Dhakchaules spent Rs 56,000 to cultivate onion over an acre of land, but the family of six may not recover even the cultivation costs as onion prices have dropped to Rs 700 per quintal from Rs 3000 per quintal this January. This is an eight-month low for onions.In neighbouring Pimpalgaon village, Vijay Waghchowre, a marginal farmer who owns four acres of land, is still waiting for confirmation of the waiver from his bank.The waiver may help us marginally this year. But I still owe another Rs 2 lakh to a moneylender. If the government wants to help farmers, let it give us subsidies or offer assured prices for our produce.The BJP-led state government is counting on the goodwill of marginal farmers like Dhakchaule to help it tide over the rural discontent.The directives of the chief minister were to ensure a system whereby the loan waiver would be transparent, inclusive and swift. We were careful to learn from the mistakes of the past loan waiver, said Kaustubh Dhavse, officer on special duty at the chief ministers office, who was involved in devising the online system for the loan waiver. There had been connivance at the level of banks, government and farmers earlier to give benefits to ineligible farmers. In our case, there is no room for such connivance because the online system does not allow for it. The waiver has offered benefit to maximum genuine farmers.Goodwill for the government isnt visible on the ground.A section of farmers leaders is continuing protests for a complete loan waiver. This month, as nearly 30,000 largely tribal cultivators marched from Nasik to Mumbai, the leaders put the demand back on their agenda. This was despite a majority of the protestors demanding their rights over forest lands and not a waiver as they have no access to banks.As a temporary relief to farmers to overcome the current distress, a complete loan waiver is essential. Thats why we continue to flag it whenever possible. A hike in MSP is one of our main demands and the state has failed to deliver on that too, said Ajit Navale, general secretary of the All India Kisan Sabha, involved in both the farmers protests.The loan waiver has a limited scope. Consider this, the total crop loan debt on the states farmers is Rs 1.13 lakh crore; the government so far has spent only Rs 13,580 crore on the loan waiver, he said."

The price of small onion skyrocketed to Rs. 180 per kg in the retail markets in Salem district by last year end.The district experienced widespread rainfall a few months ago and the farmers taking advantage of the same raised onion crop in a larger area. With the harvest season in full swing, the wholesale markets of Leigh Bazar and Shevvaipet Paul Market, and the eleven uzhavar santhais in the district have been receiving bulk stock of small onion from the villages in the last few days.According to S. A. Anand, a wholesale onion trader of Paul Market, the markets in Salem district have been receiving bulk stock of small onion from Chitradurga, Davanagere and Kollegal in Karnataka. Moreover, the farmers of Rasipuram and Vennanthur too have been supplying the small onion to Salem markets.At present, the wholesale markets in the city have been receiving about 20 tonnes of small onion per day. The wholesale price of small onion has been ranging between Rs. 7 and Rs. 14 per kg. The retail price in the uzhavar santhais ranged between Rs. 15 and Rs. 20.The wholesale markets have also been receiving Bellary onion from Karnataka and Maharashtra.With the arrival of more stock of small onion and Bellary onion, their price was expected to go down further in the days to come, he said."

Venkatram Reddy. But, he said the farmers were impatient and sold off the produce.Mr. Reddy said the farmers could take up storage of onion in fields in naturally ventilated godowns made of sticks to allow air pass through freely.The higher grade onion which was big in size arrived from Lasalgaon where the climate and alluvial soil was conducive to the crop. Also, the water used for irrigating the crop had less electro conductivity and balanced chloride and flouride. The farmers there were professionals in growing and storing onion.In Telangana, there is gravel soil and varying temperatures in areas where the crop was grown.

5b1b443e9855b76d57038bf9,Here’s how night soil improved yield,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/heres-how-night-soil-improved-yield/articleshow/64039638.cms,2018-05-05,"Sometime in November last year, a tempo drove into the Directorate of Onion and Garlic Research (DOGR) campus on Pune-Nashik Highway. To the surprise of researchers at this centre, it was carrying sacks filled with a kind of manure that they had never worked with before. Over the next few weeks, this substance was tested for efficacy; eventually, four six square metre plots were readied on this massive campus, with the idea of growing onions using different manures available with the institute, including the one that had just arrived.A good hundred days later, on Friday, May 4, 2018, the researchers harvested the plots to find startling results. The newly acquired manure had given the highest yield of the lot, beating both organic compost and chemical fertiliser. The material that won is night soil  or human faeces  excavated from two separate toilet pits in Ambegaon and Khed.The plot with organic manure gave an output of 18.22 kg, while the one enriched by chemical fertiliser generated 24.7 kg of onions. Another plot  which contained a mix of fertiliser, organic manure and night soil  gave out 21.81kg. But the plot pumped with only night soil plot yielded 26.87 kg of onions, beating all the other three. Boosted by the success of this newfound material, the premier research institute run by the Central government will now carry out several tests on soil, onions and the manure itself, to ensure that it is safe in all aspects for further usage.The idea, according to Dr Major Singh, director of DOGR, came from Ayush Prasad, an IAS officer who is posted as sub-divisional magistrate in Khed, located 50 km from Pune. The bureaucrat was posted in Osmanabad during his first stint, which was when he thought of the idea of making use of human waste.In Osmanabad, we were faced with the challenge of building toilets under the governments open defecation free (ODF) programme. While we were convincing people to build toilets, yet another issue was at hand  making them use the loos that were already completed. There was also some inertia among locals about using toilets, said the 29-year-old bureaucrat. Prasad explained that faced with multiple challenges, he came up with the idea of incentivising the use of toilets, by utilising the night soil collected in pits connected to the latrines. However, he had no way to formalise the plan back then.In October 2017, when he was transferred to Khed, Prasad got in touch with DOGR scientists, who carry out extensive research on onion and garlic crops. He had already teamed up with Jayant Deshpande, state coordinator of UNICEF, who had done extensive research on the subject as well. First, Prasad got the district administration to identify toilet pits that were full and needed to be emptied. Next, he got the night soil picked up and delivered to DOGR, where scientists picked it up for tests.Ayush Prasad (second from left) is spearheading the effortScientists at DOGR explained that while this was their first experiment with night soil  and also that of any government body in the country  the results are very encouraging. This is very first time in India that scientific research is being done with night soil. Its yield seems to be far better than other manures. In the next few weeks, we will carry out further tests to ensure that the produce is safe for consumption, as also test the soil for the effect the manure has on it, among other checks, said Dr Singh. His team members, Dr Amar Jeet Gupta and Dr A Thangasamy, are equally confident that the night soil is by far the best manure they have come across so far.While scientists at DOGR are back at work to establish that the produce grown using night soil is safe for consumption, the state coordinator for UNICEF has already compiled data to start collecting the manure from toilets across the state. From the data we have compiled so far, there are around 1.44 crore toilet pits in Maharashtra, most of which have been dug up to build toilets under the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan. It takes around seven years for a pit to get filled up if the toilet is used by a family of five. Going by this, we will be able to take out night soil from 5,636 pits every day. A single pit gives out some 70 kg of manure. This way, we will be able to generate 1,400 tonnes of night soil every year, said Deshpande.Deshpande explained that the process of getting night soil is quite simple. Once a pit is full, most families start using the second pit built along with the toilet. The full pit needs to lie idle for about a year, and get exposed to the atmosphere for a few days after that. Nature takes care of the rest. What you end up getting after all this is fine material that resembles tea powder. It has no foul stench, as most would think. All one has to do is use it as any manure on crops, Deshpande elaborated.With everything looking good so far, Prasad has already pinned his hopes on commercially exploiting this material, which is readily available in droves. Since he also holds charge of the tribal development department for Pune district, Prasad feels that the new manure will generate employment for the underprivileged. We are working on the idea of forming selfhelp groups that can identify pits in their areas. The pits can be emptied and manure packaged after some basic treatment, said Prasad, who on Friday presented the concept to Adhalrao Patil, a Member of Parliament (MP) from Shirur.Prasad believes that once the material gets a green light from DOGR, it will not only help the government promote the use of toilets under the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, but will also arrest the degradation of soil and ground water due to rampant use of chemical fertilisers. It will further address the issue of faecal management that the government is working on next, under the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, as all the pits will get emptied and the material in them will get used entirely. Most importantly, if we can restrict the use of chemical fertilisers and use night soil instead, we will end up saving a lot of foreign exchange that goes in purchasing fuel to manufacture them, said Prasad.MP Patil, who saw that night soil harvest was the best as compared to other manures, has asked Prasad and his team to make a detailed presentation. I can take it up in the Parliamentary standing committee, of which I am a member, which can then make representations to the agriculture ministry. I am certain that the concept will succeed. The only challenge I foresee is getting public participation, considering the stigma around the night soil. But, we can always work on this, Patil concluded."

(Express) Over thee crore toilets have been constructed across the country. (Express)As crores of toilet blocks are constructed across India as part of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, making toilet usage a sustainable solution in the long run has been a challenge for authorities. There have been several reports about the newly-constructed toilets being used for other purposes, including for storing grains. Now, a pilot project in Pune aims to resolve this issue, by offering an incentive to local residents to use the toilets.Explaining the project, Assistant Collector of Khed taluka, Ayush Prasad, said it was based on harvesting the decomposed night soil from twin pit toilets and using it as manure. In rural areas, the Abhiyan promotes construction of twin pit toilets, which allow complete decomposition of night soil into manure. Our project will involve commercial usage of this manure and paying the householder to harvest the same, he said.In the preliminary stage, the manure was tested in a field owned by the Rajgurunagar-based Directorate of Onion and Garlic Research and the results showed a nine-fold increase in yields. Scientists of the Indian Council of Agriculture Research (ICAR) are now trying to devise means to improve the quality of the manure, said Prasad.Under the project, a farmer producer company will be entrusted with the work of harvesting the manure, treating it and selling it to floriculturists. Surveys are being undertaken to identify twin pit toilets that were constructed and in use between 2010-2013. In the first phase, we will harvest the manure from these pits, said Prasad. The pilot project is expected to be rolled out in October.Jayant Deshpande, state sanitation consultant of UNICEF, said the scheme will incentivise the usage of toilets. If a monetary incentive is provided, the households will continue using the toilets and take care of its upkeep, he said.Under the flagship programme of the central government, district administrations provide both household as well as community toilets in urban and rural areas.Government figures reveal that the total number of toilets constructed across the nation is more than 3 crore. Maharashtra was recently declared open-defecation free (ODF), with almost 70 per cent toilet usage being reported. The National Rural Sanitation Survey has put the toilet usage across the country at around 93.4 per cent.For all the latest Pune News, download Indian Express App"

The prices have decreased from Rs 1,700 a quintal on February 21 to Rs 600 per quintal on May 21.In the retail market, onions are being sold at Rs 10 to Rs 12 per kg following the fall in wholesale prices.The minimum and maximum prices at Lasalgaon APMC on Monday were Rs 400 and Rs 861 per quintal, respectively, when around 8,000 quintals of onions were auctioned.The harvest of summer onions is in full swing and that has led to rise in supply. Also, the demand for onions have reduced because of the ongoing holy month of Ramzan. All this has led to decline in prices, APMC officials said.Usually, farmers prefer storing summer onions, as it has a shelf life of five to six months, with a hope of getting better price later. But there is a vast section of farmers who need money and are bringing their produce to the APMCs, the official added.Jaydatta Holkar, chairman of Lasalgaon APMC, said, Onions with inferior quality or which cant be stored are being brought to the APMCs. The poor quality onions are fetching low rates. This is the major reason behind the fall in prices.Holkar said the wholesale prices would either prevail at the present rate or will slide further till June 15, after which the prices would increase.Last month, the central government roped in the National Agricultural Co-operative Marketing Federation of India Ltd to procure onions in a bid to stabilise prices. But the prices continued to drop."

(Express photo by Arul Horizon)The central government has announced a 5 per cent incentive on onion exports to boost the roots flagging prices, said Pasha Patel, chairman of the state governments committee for agricultural prices. Patel said he had met Union Minister of commerce Suresh Prabhu to discuss the matter. The minister has agreed to extend 5 per cent incentive for onion under the Merchandise Export from India Scheme, Patel told The Indian Express on Thursday.Onion prices have crashed in the wholesale markets of Maharashtra due to the bumper crop in the state. This year, Maharashtra reported plantation of over 3.5 lakh hectares of land, instead of the usual 3 lakh hectares. The increased arrival has subdued the price of onions, which are trading at Rs 6-7 per kg in mandis. The price drop comes after an eight month bull run for the bulb in wholesale markets. From June last year till early March, average prices of the bulb hovered between Rs 25 per kg and 30 per kg.The price rise was mainly due to the drought in Karnataka, which had resulted in the failure of Karnatakas rabi crop last year. Rabi or summer onion is planted late December and harvested post March-April. This onion is the only one which is amenable for storage and feeds the market from April till September before the arrival of kharif onions. Farmers in Maharashtra store these onions moisture proof storage structures called kanda chawls and offload them when prices are right.Last year, due to the scarcity of onions, prices were high. The government took several steps to reduce the prices, such as importing at least 20,000 tonnes of onion while income tax officials raided the premises of seven traders who were allegedly storing onions. Also, the Minimum Export Price (MEP), which was kept at zero since December 2015, was raised to $850 per tonne. Between April 2017 and February 2018, the country had seen exports of 21,35,421.57 tonnes of the bulb  a record high.Since March, onion prices have been on the wane as arrival has increased in wholesale markets. The governments decision to free exports by removing the MEP slab in February had failed to boost the market sentiments. Similarly, the decision of Nafed to wade in the market and procure 25,000 tonnes of the bulb at Maharashtras Lasalgoan mandi had failed to firm up the prices. It is expected that the price of the bulb will increase in the days to come. Agri-commodity analyst Dipak Chavan also welcomed the move, saying this will be beneficial for domestic markets. Our currency is at an all time low, so this incentive will have a positive effect on the markets and firm up the prices, he said.For all the latest Pune News, download Indian Express App"

As India wades into the election battlefield next year, it will be governance that decides the mandate and not mudslinging. Indian voters have usually voted out non-performing leaders to bring in ones who promised better governance or Achche Din. Last week, almost the entire Opposition descended on Bengaluru to forge the blueprint of an alliance which will try to dislodge Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2019.They had little in common except a venomous dislike for him. The optics of Mamata Banerjee and Mayawati, Sitaram Yechury and Siddaramaiah, Sonia Gandhi and Sharad Pawar, Rahul Gandhi and Akhilesh Yadav and others preening on a festive stage erected as a launching pad for HD Kumaraswamys ascension to the chief ministership of Karnataka was a political anagram spelling a warning to Modi. Beware! Our phalanx is ready to demolish your juggernaut.Not one of them put forth an alternative agenda for governance, and refrained from attacking each other, as they had done before arriving in Bengaluru and did soon after landing back home. But the message from Bengaluru was loud and clear: Battle 2019 would be fought between the Mighty Dozen and Crafty Modi. Once again, history is repeating itself.In 1977, it was Indira vs the Rest. In 1989, it was Rajiv vs United Enemies. The choices were between one opportunistic coalition and an unprincipled alliance. In 2018, Modi finds himself in the unenviable position of facing the entire regiment of Opposition leaders who cannot individually defeat him in nearly any major state. Rajiv Gandhis Congress was trounced by his own former minister VP Singh, who launched the Janata Dal from Bengaluru in 1988, supported by the BJP and the Communists. For Modi, 2019 is a greater challenge than 2014, when he was pitted against a defamed government and tainted leadership. Since then he has almost fulfilled his promise of achieving a Congress-mukt Bharat. What next?Though the Congress is just a ghost now, the BJP and its partners rule 22 states while regional satraps control the remaining states where the BJP is weak; some of them were once part of the NDA. The challenge for the Congress and other non-BJP Opposition parties is to snatch Lok Sabha seats away from the saffron sultan. Analysis of data shows that the electorate rejects over 65 per cent of sitting lawmakers in every state in every poll.This means the probability of sitting BJP MPs losing is higher than that of Opposition legislators, who together hold only 225 seats in the current Parliament. Hence, the Opposition has joined hands to take advantage of the anti-incumbency factor in Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Haryana and other states where the BJP has been in power for one or more than two terms. Various opinion polls also indicate its vote share may shrink.While Modi remains the voters top choice, his personal popularity has shown a significant fall. However, it is not impossible for him to win a second mandate by making a course correction in the next nine months. Having created an admirable climate of economic stability and GDP growth, the prime minister will need to convince the voters that he has provided a government which works by adopting the Mantra of Reform, Perform and Transform. For that he must:*Improve perception. Modis promise of delivering Maximum Governance with Minimum Government seduced peoples high expectations. He correctly thought of right-sizing or downsizing the government. But four years later, its mass has bloated further. There are more secretaries and higher level officials now than in 2014. Bureaucracy is like a wildfire that has spread in favourable winds across the corridors of power. Taking advantage of the PMs trust in honest officers, babus have created innumerable tribunals, commissions and expert groups to accommodate retired colleagues.*Tame inflation: Modi had promised to reduce prices and provide more employment. Though the job market has shown recovery, it is less than expected. The wholesale price index is either stagnant or stuck, though within tolerable limits. Yet the perception created by the record spurt in petroleum product prices should be a major concern.The BJP made gas prices one of its major election issues in 2014. In 2018, consumers are paying more to fill fuel tanks, though the average cost of imported crude is down 40 per cent. Public perception that the government is squeezing the middle class is gaining ground. Modi should perhaps note that the BJP lost many elections in the late 1990s due to a rise in onion prices. Any hike in petroleum prices devastates the domestic budgets of the middle and lower classes. It has a spiralling effect on the cost of other goods and services. Providing affordable housing to the middle class is still a dream. Healthcare costs are exorbitant and the quality has plummeted in most of India.*Increase his Indian footprint. Modi has left his imprint on international diplomacy through inimitable Modihuplomacy. During the past four years he has travelled to a record number of countries and exhibited his popularity and innovative skills to numerous global leaders. But now he needs to reconnect himself with the electorate more. The BJP has wrested all the states from the Congress thanks to his magnetism. Modi is bigger than the BJP; the voters plump for him and not for his party. His domestic travel should be aimed at connecting with his core constituency and not just official events.Former deputy prime minister LK Advanis political relevance may have diminished in New India, but Modi should take his cue from a statement he made after the 2004 Lok Sabha elections, that the BJP lost because it had ignored its core constituencythe middle class and the committed Sangh Parivaris.*Forget Rahul and Sonia Gandhi. The prime minister is committing the cardinal mistake of attacking the Gandhi Parivar more frequently than politically required.Both mother and son had almost hit the political bottom after the Congress won just 44 seats in 2014 and lost in all the states it ruled between 2014 and 2018. Gandhi bashing paid dividends in 2014 since they remote-controlled the Manmohan Singh government and were punished by the electorate. Double jeopardy does not work. Indira Gandhi was defeated in 1977 for imposing the Emergency, but staged a triumphant return in 1980. The Atal Bihari Vajpayee-led NDA lost in 2004 despite an admirable performance.During the run-up to the 2019 elections, Modis oratorical skills and charisma would face the real test. He will have to convince India that he is not a leader who makes promises which are forgotten soon after the election, and that he has actually delivered more than what was promised in 2014."

Many are also selling them within the villages, said Balbir Singh Rajewal, president of the Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU). Today is only the first day, so urban markets are still able to sell what was supplied earlier. Wait and see; by day after tomorrow, prices will shoot up in cities.Ramandeep Sangh Mann, a farmer leader associated with the KEM  an umbrella body of 62 farmer groups  said, According to local reports, 40% of milk supply in Punjab is affected.Extending support to the farmers campaign, Punjab Minister Navjot Singh Sidhu visited Patto village in Fatehgarh Sahib and purchased milk and vegetables directly from a farmer.In Haryana, arrival of farm produce at urban centres was down by 70 to 80%, BKU leader Rakesh Bains told The Hindu .Mr. Bains said implementing the Swaminathan Commissions recommendation on Minimum Support Price (MSP) for crops, complete farm loan waiver and fixation of minimum income for farmers are the key demands that the government should address immediately.We also want the government to fix MSP for milk and vegetables, he added.Supplies hit in RajasthanAlthough the agitation did not affect normal life in Rajasthan, supply of milk, vegetables and other farm produce was hit in Sriganganagar, Hanumangarh and Jhunjhunu districts.We will continue this for the next 10 days and the protest will intensify, said Santveer Singh, a member of the core committee of RKMM in Rajasthan. He said protests were held in Bikaner, Sikar and Nagaur.As the strike began, police in Mandsaur in Madhya Pradesh have kept a close vigil as the anniversary of the June 6 farmers agitation approaches.

The construction work was taken up in 2015 and was completed a few months ago, S Vellayappan, president, Trichy Wholesale Onion Traders Association, said.The land was said to be bought by the association in the 1990s. While only 78 wholesale onion traders are functioning in the corporation-run shops on the Sub Jail Road in Gandhi Market, the private market has 101 shops with facilities to stock large and small onions. Though the market is spacious and furnished with basic amenities, the approach road merging with Chennai-Trichy bypass apparently has a narrow entry which could cause a bottleneck on the stretch. Close to 145 heavy vehicles, including from Maharashtra, Perambalur, Namakkal, and Thuraiyur, will come to the facility to trade large and small onions. The market will supply onions to as many as 10 central districts here.After state ministers Vellamandi N Natarajan and S Valarmathi opened the facility in the presence of traders representatives on Sunday, wholesale onion traders said that around 78 wholesale onion traders operating from Gandhi market for now will be relocated to the private market in a months time. With the market being opened, the public has sought the traffic police department to ensure that heavy vehicles are not parked over the Chennai-Trichy NH service road causing bottleneck at the Palpannai junction where two national highways merge."

According to market sources, the retail onion prices are likely to increase to Rs 20/kg in a couple of days if the auction continues to take the hit due to the strike.The crash in the wholesale onion prices and farmers strike have altogether led to a drop in supply at Lasalgaon APMC, said Jaydatta Holkar, chairman of the APMC.Earlier, the average wholesale onion prices had crashed by almost 65% from Rs 1,700 a quintal on February 21 to Rs 600 per quintal on May 18.A farmer spends Rs 900 for a quintal on onions as cost of cultivation and if the produce fetches anything below this means huge loss.Presently, onions arriving in the market are of summer crop, having a shelf life of five months. Harvesting of summer onions was over in April and most of the farmers have stored their produce with the hope of getting better prices. The onions stored by farmers cater to the market until the arrival of fresh kharif crop in the second half of October."

It can be consumed raw, cooked, dried or roasted. Besides being used as a food, it has a variety of medicinal properties too.Onions have been known to mankind since prehistoric times and have found mention in religious books like The Bible and The Koran. The medicinal properties of the herb have been described by the early Ayurveda exponents like Charak (in Charak Samhita) and Sushruta.In Chinese medicine, Onions have been used to treat cough, bacterial infection and breathing problems. Ancient Americans used wild Onions to treat cold, cough, asthma and to repel insects. In modern medicine, it is used to lower blood sugar, tackle cardiovascular problems, prevent hair loss, urinary disorders, tooth ache etc.In India, the largest Onion-producing state is Maharashtra, all though it is also grown widely in Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Bihar and Andhra Pradesh.In Bengal the production of Onions is not encouraging. The total cultivable area for Onions here is 0.3 lakh ha and production is 5.4 lakh tonnes whereas in Maharashtra the total cultivable land is 5.2 lakh ha and production is 65.3 lakh tonnes.However, realising the importance of Onions, Bengal has now started research and development at various agricultural science centres and universities to try and increase production.A full-grown bulbCultivationClimate and soil: The Onion is basically a cool season crop. But it can be grown under a wide range of climatic conditions such as tropical, sub-tropical and temperate climates. The best performance can be expected in mild weather, without extreme cold, heat or excessive rainfall.In order to meet consumers rising demand, to minimise import from other states and to stabilise the price of Onions, Bengal is now cultivating the herb during rainy season (kharif) as well as during rabi season. For this, various new varieties of Onions are being developed.Onions can be grown in all types of soil such as sandy loam, silt loam, clay loam and heavy soil. But the best soil for it is sandy loam with good drainage and moisture-holding capacity. It cannot be grown in alkaline or low lying marshy land.Varieties: Onions can be broadly divided into two groups  Common Onion and Multiplier Onion. The Common Onion group includes the typical bulb Onion whereas the multiplier Onion forms smaller bulbs. In this article we shall focus on growing Common Onions.It is important to select the right variety of Onion as per the season. Varieties suitable in the kharif season are Bhima Dark Red, Bhima Super, Bhima Raj, Bhima Red and Bhima Shubhra. For the rabi season Bhima Shakti, Bhima Kiran and Bhima Light are more suitable.Planting: Common Onions can be grown by raising seedlings in a nursery bed, by broadcasting (sprinkling seeds) or drilling seeds directly in the field. It can also be grown by planting bulbs directly in the field. As Onions are mainly planted using the transplanting method, production of healthy seedlings require a well-maintained nursery. This will ensure better seedlings.Prepare a nursery bed of 3m length and 0.6m breadth and raise it to a height of 15-25cm. Spare a distance of 70cm between the beds as you would need it eventually for deweeding. Generally a well-drained, fertile, loam to sandy loam, loose and friable soil, rich in organic matter is preferred for such a nursery bed.Onions, peeled and choppedSeeds are sown in lines, 4-5cm apart, in rabi, and 5-7cm apart in kharif settings. Sowing should not be done more than 2-3cm deep and after sowing, the beds should be mulched with dry grass or straw to maintain and preserve the required soil moisture.As and when there is lack of moisture in the bed, water it using a sprinkling can. After germination, the mulching material should be removed and when required, the nursery should be protected from heavy rains during kharif season.To protect seedlings from direct sun rays, partial shade should be provided. The seedlings will be ready for transplanting in six to seven weeks in kharif and eight to nine weeks in rabi seasons. Two to three days before uprooting the seedlings, ensure light irrigation. Onions can also be grown by direct seeding.In the next edition we shall discuss methods of irrigation and harvesting the herb. Onions are prone to attacks by weeds and so weed management shall be discussed too. To be continued"

The government's fiscal deficit target for the current financial year, at 3.3 percent of GDP, is already under pressure due to high oil prices.""With funding under stress, the government can't widen the scope of agri purchases,"" said Sanjay Mookim, India equity strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. ""And even if it does, there is no storage available and you can't build storage in two-three months.""The ministries of agriculture and food did not immediately respond to requests for comment.The government said its limited purchases could cost it Rs 150 billion this year, although industry officials say it is difficult to estimate actual spending, which depends on the quantity procured.MSPs typically dictate crops that most farmers opt for, often leading to a glut of certain commodities, millions of tonnes of which have to be sold into a depressed local market at well below the cost of production, sparking angry farmer protests across the country.""What's the use of a hike when we did not even get last year's MSP?"" asked Purshotam Sontakke from a village in Wardha district in Maharashtra, who sold soybean at Rs 2,700 per 100 kg in 2017, 11 percent below the state-set price.A crash in farm commodity prices over the past few months has led to a waning of PM Modi's popularity in the countryside - where more than two-thirds of India's 1.3 billion people live - prompting the premier to invite a group of farmers to his residence last week and promise MSPs at 1.5 times of input cost.He called the latest hike historic and said he was committed to do more for farmers. His stated goal is to double farmer's income by 2022.LACK OF STORAGEState agencies bought only 71 million tonnes of wheat and rice in 2017/18 out of 210 million tonnes produced. In the same year, the country produced hundreds of millions of tonnes of oilseeds and horticulture crops like onion and potatoes, which are not typically procured by the government.The food ministry told parliament in March that the peak storage demand for food grains like rice and wheat was 60 million tonnes for the central pool, compared with a capacity of 73.5 million tonnes, 17 percent of which was open storage covered by plastic or other material.The ministry says on its website that the government will add more storage capacity by 2020.""Higher MSPs are welcome but there is inadequate public procurement at MSP, except in the case of wheat and rice,"" said M.S. Swaminathan, an renowned agriculture scientist.""This is clear from the experience of farmers who cultivated more pulses, on the expectation of procurement but were let down by a crash in market prices.""ELECTION PLEDGEDuring election campaigning in 2014, PM Modi promised steep hikes in MSPs and the doubling of farmers' income soon after becoming prime minister.But double-digit food inflation and a higher fiscal deficit forced him to raise MSPs only by low single digits over the past four years. This year's hefty hike marked a major shift in the government's approach.But Harish Galipelli, head of commodities and currencies at Inditrade Derivatives & Commodities in Mumbai, said farmers sold below MSP even last year and were likely to do so again given piles of grains and sugar lying in private warehouses.The below-MSP rates, however, are as much as 30 percent higher than global prices for some commodities like pulses, making exports uncompetitive, Galipelli added.The latest hike will only widen the difference and hit India's farm exports, which fell to $33 billion in 2016/17 from $42.6 billion in 2013/14, said the India head of a global trading firm who declined to be named citing company policy.""The glut will only increase in the country with higher MSPs,"" he said.

This year, due to the carry forward stock and tough competition in international market, onion dehydration plants are also not giving the farmers adequate prices.Mahua Market Yard in Bhavnagar district is the biggest trading centre for white onion after Lasalgaon in Nashik. Nearly 90% white onion grown by farmers in Bhavnagar and some parts of Amreli is exported.In 2016-17, nearly 60,000 tonnes white onion was produced, which reduced to 45,000 tonnes in 2017-18. This year, the yield is expected to remain between 30,000 to 35,000 tonnes.Former president of All India Dehydration Vegetables Association, Vitthal Koradia, said, Last year, farmers got Rs 100 per 20 kg, but this year, the price will be nearly Rs 160 per 20 kg. But still they would be booking losess as the production cost is around Rs 140 per 20 kg. We have last years 10,000 tonne stock. Ten dehydration plants have declared bankruptcy because they had purchased huge quantity of stock from farmers in previous years but they didnt get the expected price in the international market.Farmers said that the dehydration unit owners are selling their produce at cheaper rates in the international market to remain in the competition. As a result, they are unwilling to give the farmers adequate price.There are 100 such plants in Mahua and nearly 50 plants are dysfunctional for the want of orders. India exports 40% of worlds requirement of onion and is the second biggest exporter of onion after America, which sends out 45% of its produce.According to farmers, their production cost is Rs 140 per 20 kg and since last two years, they are booking losses.Himmat Patel, a farmer from Talaja, said, This year, the yield is expected to reduce because area under sowing was much less due to last years experience. Moreover, irrigation water is also not available. Farmers cant afford to book more losses now and government should intervene.Farmers who didnt sow white onions also didnt sow red onions instead.D S Royla, secretary of Bhavnagar Marketing Yard said, This year, production of red onion is expected fall by 25% because of non-availability of irrigation water. However, its early to say that it would result in price rise in the retail market because we dont have proper figures of the crop in other states."

This was double the price of Rs 12 for a kg of onions a week ago.Onion supply also dropped by over 1,000 quintal at Market Yard on Wednesday, with the prices going up by Rs 2 per kg. On Tuesday, onion prices in the wholesale market were Rs 6-Rs 17 per kg. Within a day, the prices rose to Rs 8-Rs 18 for a kg.Wholesalers feared that the prices might increase to Rs 2,000-Rs 3,000 from the current rates of Rs 800-Rs 1,800 for a quintal.An Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) official told TOI that onion supplies decreased on Wednesday than what it was during the previous four days.He said, Several factors are leading to the decrease in supply. During Diwali , onion stock drops as the new crop does not reach the markets. Besides, onions have not yet reached the harvest stage in many fields. Another reason may be water scarcity in various districts because of less rainfall this monsoon.The official said the stock of old onions, which reached the market around April, was also dwindling. We need both the old and the new crops as the demand is high during this period. Besides, use of chemical-based fertilizers farmers by the farmers in soil for years are also affected the quality of the crops, he said.The biggest onion market in Lasalgaon of Nashik district is also reporting dipping stocks over the last eight days, with just 10,000 quintal being the average supply per day. Nashiks kharif onion production is set to plummet drastically by about seven lakh tonnes or 78% following drought-like conditions in parts of the district. Over 60% of the total kharif onion acreage of 52,517 hectares in the district has dried up, with scanty rain this monsoon.Indersen, a vegetable vendor in Koregaon Park, said hoarding of onions by middlemen was triggering an artificial shortage and price rise.Yakub Pathan, a retailer in Wakad, said the stock of old onions was down to 50%. The retailers prefer to buy old onions because the new crop tends to rot fast, he said."

Interestingly, the same produce is being sold at Rs. 22 and Rs. 18 respectively in the retail market.An increase in the arrival of stocks from the Rayalaseema region, particularly from Kurnool district, is said be reason behind the drop in the wholesale price, which is expected to take a further plunge in the coming weeks, as harvesting is in progress in Maharashtra.

Only middlemen are being benefited from this price fall, as the end users are paying much higher than what farmers are getting in return for heir produce, he pointed out."
5ce76762e8e3fc56af419304,BUAT agriculture scientists introduce high-yielding variety of onion,http://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2018/oct/30/buat-agriculture-scientists-introduce-high-yielding-variety-of-onion-1891683.html,2018-10-30,"Namita Bajpai ByExpress News ServiceLUCKNOW: There is a new ray of hope for the vegetable farmers of water deficient Bundelkhand region of Uttar Pradesh as an agriculture scientist of Banda University of Agriculture and Technology (BUAT) has introduced a rapidly growing and high-yielding variety of onion.This could also be counted as a step towards doubling the income of the farmers till 2022. The new variety is virtuous enough to help the farmers improve earnings as it has smaller gestation and a longer preservation period than any other regular variety of onion.It may be recalled that the agriculture scientists of BUAT had developed a dark red variety of onion which had proved to be a boon for onion growers of Bundelkhand region. Associate Professor, BUAT, Dr RK Singh calls this new variety Line-883. ""The crop of this variety gets ready in 83 days instead of 110-1120 days taken by regular onion varieties,"" said Dr Singh.He added that the yield is almost 20 per cent higher than the regular onion crop with 300-350 quintal per hectare as against 250-280 for normal varieties. ""We have tried to address the preservation issues as well. Usually, onion stays just for a month and gets sprouted at normal temperature but Line-833 can be preserved for over two and a half months without sprouting both at normal temperature and cold storage.Dr Singh has been conducting his experiments with the seeds of Line-833 in Bundelkhand region for the last two years.Before this, he had actually started his research on the new variety while being in Nasik National Horticulture Research and Development Foundation (NHRDF) a decade ago. Elaborating on its positives, Dr Singh explained that it took lesser time to grow as compared to the regular varieties. ""This is ready within 80-85 days against traditional 100-110 days of onion crop. Moreover, its level of endurance and resistance to disease is much higher than other onion varieties,"" he said.On his decision to introduce this variety to Bundelkhand onion growers, Dr Singh said was best-suited option for them as Bundelkhand was water deficient and the new variety grew to require a lesser amount of water while giving best results in Kharif season.However, he added that its seeds were used by over 400 farmers of different regions and states, including Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Bihar, Jharkhand Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan and Karnataka, on trial basis with exemplary results. Moreover, 15 farmers of Banda district have used the seed of Line 833 and got very good output, said BUAT authorities endorsing the variety. Explaining the technical aspect involved,Dr Singh claimed that in Bundelkhand region the sulphur content in the soil was higher than normal. ""Sulphur increases the activity of soil. For Line-833 sulphur rich soil is best suited so it will give outstanding results and can be a boon for Bundelkhand framers,"" said Dr Singh."
5ce735c7e8e3fc56af417ec4,onion prices are fluctuating,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/onion-prices-are-fluctuating/article25416194.ece,2018-11-04,"What is the problem?Onion prices peaked in mid-October in parts of the country on account of squeezed supplies from the key bulb-growing States, bringing to the fore the recurring price volatility of this vegetable which the country witnesses almost every alternate season.The wholesale onion prices at the Lasalgaon Agricultural Produce Market Committee  the countrys largest wholesale onion market in Maharasthra  ruled Rs. 22-23 a kg in mid-October on tight supplies as supply had dropped. Consequently, the retail prices jumped, and in the national capital New Delhi, the price hit Rs. 40 a kg, before the Union government reviewed the price and availability of onion and asked the Delhi government to make onion available through its public distribution system outlets as was done in 2015 when prices had spiked.Has supply dropped?Government data show production of onion has fallen marginally during the 2017-18 crop year that ended June 30. The third advance estimates say onion output is likely to be around 22 million tonnes during the reported period, lower than 22.4 million tonnes in 2016-17. However, compared to the average production of the past five years, it is about 12% higher.Traders point out that the supply of onions in the Lasalgaon market mainly dropped owing to a drought-like situation in parts of Maharashtra, where the onions Kharif crop is likely to be lower. However, they are hopeful that as the arrival from neighbouring Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh has started picking up, prices will moderate. Jaydutta Holkar, chairman of the Lasalgaon APMC, says supplies are gradually rising, and on October 31, the average wholesale price of the onion was around Rs. 10-11 a kg. Onion price surged only for a couple of days in mid-October but later as the arrival increased the price has dropped. However, those selling in the retail have kept the price up only to derive more profit..., he says.Traders and the government hope prices will moderate in the coming days as the supply is expected to improve as soon as the harvest begins in the onion-growing areas of Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Rajasthan.Why this recurring volatility?In India, onion prices are extremely volatile. While the production in the country over the years has been rising, sharp price spikes are experienced almost every alternate year. The key reasons for severe and frequent price shocks are attributed by agriculture experts to production fluctuations and changes in the nature of demand.The growth in onion production has risen from below 5.5 million tonnes till 2002-03 to nearly 20 million tonnes in recent years. Experts point out that the annual growth rate of above 13% in onion production since 2000-01 is phenomenal and no other food crop in the country shows this type of growth in the recent years.However, domestic and overseas demand for onion seems to be outpacing growth in supply, points out Professor Ramesh Chand, a member of the NITI Aayog. He says the per capita demand of onion has increased from 4 kg in 2002-03 to more than 13 kg in recent years. This growth in per capita demand for onion reflects a mind-boggling change in preference of Indian consumers for onion. It also implies that the effect of spikes in onion price on household budgets is getting heavier. It looks strange that increased availability is associated with the increase in price volatility rather than providing flexibility to absorb small shocks in supply, he says.What is in store?The price trends of onion over the years show that high prices prevail only for a few months and the excessive volatility can be managed through appropriate mechanisms. Professor Chand says a multi-pronged strategy involving technology, extension, public stocks, and market intelligence is needed to address excessive volatility. Stocking by public sector parastatal like the NAFED will also keep a check on exploitation and market manipulation by private trade, besides price stabilisation, he adds.Vikas Vasudeva"

Three days ago, premium quality onions were being bought from farmers in the range of Rs. 12 to 15 per kg, but their prices also crashed to below Rs. 10, by Monday. In other parts of the State, farmers are being forced to sell their crop for Rs. 1/kg.Distressed, the farmers in Bagalkot district recently protested by throwing onions on the road and staging rasta roko. Similar agitations were held by farmers in Hubballi. The Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha, which also held a protest in Bengaluru on Monday, has demanded that the government announce a minimum support price (MSP) and open centres across the State for the purchase of onions. We spend more on transporting onions from the farm to the market than what we get, said Hanumanthappa, an onion farmer from Amingad, Raichur district, who had come to Bengaluru on Monday to protest.Basavaraj, another onion grower from Chitradurga, felt the government must announce an MSP and buy their stock. Last year, onions got good price as a kg went up to Rs. 30 in the wholesale market. We were expecting a similar situation this year, especially after Deepavali. But, we have now incurred huge losses, he said.According to Ravi Kumar from the Onion and Potato Traders Association, Bengaluru, there has been a glut of onions in markets across the country leading to crashing prices. Supply has far outmatched demand for onions in the market. In the last two weeks, markets in Alwar, Rajasthan; Ahmednagar, Maharashtra; and Belagavi, Karnataka have been shut down for days, and they havent bought onions as the existing stock is still unsold, he said.Why the glutWith a bumper onion crop this year, crops from Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh have flooded the market, while the harvest season in the State has yet to end.To add to this, onions from Pakistan and Afghanistan have flooded Punjab and Delhi markets.We dont see the situation improving till the harvest season for the crop is over and stocks are cleared. In fact, we foresee a further drop in prices, said a procurement official from a prominent retail chain in Bengaluru.One kg of onion is still being sold at Rs. 20/kg in the retail market and the prices are expected to crash this week."

Waivers dont reach many due to lack of documents and Aadhaar-seeded bank accounts.Punjabs example has shown that tenant, small and marginal farmers dont get the benefit of loan waivers. Many farmers dont have land titles and necessary conditions for the direct benefit transfer of government aid. Similar cases have been reported from UP as well, said an agricultural expert who drafted the roadmap for Punjab on loan waiver.Tenant farmers till 34% of the total cultivable land in Andhra, 25% in Punjab, 21% in Bihar, 17% in Odisha, 14% in Bengal and 15% in Haryana. The number of tenant farmers has risen in recent years owing to migration of people from rural to urban areas, said a senior official of NITI Aayog.While political outfits compete to win the hearts of farmers, reforms which could have addressed their woes skip the agenda of governance.NITI Aayog reached out to all state governments with the model land leasing law, which could have provided recognition to tenant farmers to access benefits and loans. Yet, only MP and Uttarakhand could adopt the legislation so far, the official added.ALSO READ | Onion farmer from Maharashtra sends meagre earnings to PMOIronically, tenant farmers face the fury of weather in times of unseasonal rains and hailstorm while the compensation cheques announced by the government reach people living in cities as land-holdings are in their names in official records, the NITI Aayog official added.In the absence of lease documents acceptable in government records, tenant farmers continue to be out of the formal credit access and farm subsidies, and access loans from moneylenders at exorbitant rates, said the official. While the farmers are the backbone of Indian agriculture, it seems nobody is really bothered about their problems, he added."

On October 16, onion prices touched Rs 21 per kg.Traders said prices were dampened due to a sudden jump in supplies in local market from Maharashtra and producing centres around Indore like Khandwa.Maharashtra is one of the leading suppliers of onions to Indore.The daily supply of onions has dropped to about 50,000 bags (1 bag weighs 60 kg) as against 1 lakh bags around a month ago at Choithram mandi.Radheshyam Kushwah, an onion dealer said, This is the season when new onion comes and also remains in demand. But supplies have been very limited since past a week. There are stocks of old onions but demand for that is very less.Traders said prices for old onions have also slipped to about Rs 3 per kg to Rs 7 per kg.They said onion prices are unlikely to improve in coming week because production is high and supplies are also abundant from producing centres.Goud said, We are using onions from stocks but that is not going to last long also the demand in the market is for new ones."

And this despite the Centre allocating large sums for several schemes to boost farmer incomes. So what went wrong? TOI takes a look at the stress points hurting the sector.Two successive years of drought (2014, 2015) have taken a toll on the farm sector. The government has allocated significant funds for the sector but slow implementation of projects has not eased the pain. Drought in Maharashtra, Gujarat and Karnataka have also added to farmers woes.Prices have collapsed for farm commodities. Low international prices have meant exports have been hit while imports have hurt prices at home. For example, there was a bumper production of pulses in 2016-17 but imports of nearly 6.6 million tonnes arrived, compounding the problem. In 2017-18, another 5.6 million tonnes flowed in, depressing domestic prices further. The government delayed imposing tariffs on imports, which heightened the problem of prices for farmers. According to a Niti Aayog paper, on average, farmers do not realise remunerative prices due to limited reach of the minimum support prices (MSP) and an agricultural marketing system that delivers only a small fraction of the final price to the actual farmer.The Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana was launched in 2016 to provide insurance and financial support to farmers in the event of failure of any crops due to natural calamities, pests and diseases. It was also meant to stabilise the income of farmers and ensure they remain in farming. But the scheme has seen lower enrolments due to a string of factors, including high premiums and lack of innovation by insurance firms.Irrigation is crucial for the farm sector, where large tracts of land still depend on monsoon rains. The Centre launched the Rs 40,000-crore Long-Term Irrigation Fund, operated by the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (Nabard). Under this programme, 99 large irrigation projects were to be completed by December 2019 but the progress so far has been limited. Experts say a number of factors, including bureaucratic delays and slow implementation by states, have hurt progress for this crucial input.According to a Niti Aayog document, farm sector development has ignored the potential of marketing. Archaic laws still hobble the sector. Access of farmers to well-developed markets remains an issue although several initiatives have been launched to develop an electronic market place. Reforms to the APMC Act have been slow and most states have dragged their feet on it. Experts suggest an entity such as the GST Council to bring together states and the Centre to jointly take decisions to reform the sector and provide better access to markets for farmers. According to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the combination of market regulations and infrastructure deficiencies leads to a price depressing effect on the sector.Introduction of latest technology has been limited due to a number of reasons. Access to modern technology could act as a boost to productivity through improved variety of seeds, farm implements and farming technology. According to a Niti Aayog paper, there has been no real technological breakthrough in recent times.Large gaps in storage, cold chains and limited connectivity have added to the woes of farmers. It has also added to the significant post-harvest losses of fruit and vegetables, estimated at 4% to 16% of the total output, according to the OECD.This has meant that there is little incentives for farmers to diversify. According to an OECD document, share of high-value sectors in food processing is low with fruit, vegetable and meat products accounting for 5% and 8% of the total value of output compared to cerealbased products at 21% and oilseeds at 18%A government-appointed panel had recommended that FCI hand over all procurement operations of wheat, paddy and rice to states that have gained sufficient experience in this regard and have created reasonable infrastructure for procurement. These states are Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh. It had suggested a complete overhaul of FCI and recommended that farmers be given direct cash subsidy (of about Rs 7000/ha) and fertiliser sector deregulated. The panel had said direct cash subsidy to farmers will go a long way to help those who take loans from money lenders at exorbitant interest rates to buy fertilisers or other inputs, thus relieving some distress in the agrarian sector. The report has been put in cold storage.The share of the farm sector in GDP has declined from 29% in 1990 to about 17% in 2016, but it remains a major source of employment. According to OECD data, 85% of operational land holdings are less than 2 hectares and account for 45% of the total cropped area. Only 5% of farmers work on land holding larger than 4 hectares, according to the Agricultural Census, 2016. Productivity lags other Asian economies such as China, Vietnam and Thailand and average yields are low compared to other global producers. Wheat and rice yields are nearly 3 times lower than world yields while those for mango, banana, onion or potato are between 2 and 7 times lower than the highest yields achieved globally, according to the OECD."

It wasnt blood. But Bandu Markad said it wasnt any different for him. The farmer was in distress and he had just squished the pomegranates that he had grown under tremendous hardships, which included getting water in the drought-prone district.Markad had reason to curse his luck. When he took the yield from his 1,200 trees to the market, he got a price of Rs 10 per kilo. Days ago, it was Rs 80. A video of Markad in tears and beating pomegranates to pulp soon went viral. Moved, people sent him money. At the end of five days, he had about Rs 2 lakh in his account.One could call Markad fortunate. But across the country, a range of issues from debt to low prices for their produce have forced farmers to take desperate measures. Many killed themselves, destroying the lives they left behind. A month after BJPs Devendra Fadnavis took over as CM of Maharashtra in 2014, he said tackling the agrarian crisis would be his top priority. He drafted a special action plan to check suicides in 14 of the worst-hit districts. In 2017, 2,917 suicides were reported, while in the current year, up to October 31, 2,223 farmers have ended their lives.On March 12 this year, thousands of farmers from Maharashtra reached Mumbai after covering 180 km on foot to highlight their plight. On November 30, those in north and central India trooped into Delhi  among them prominent leaders from Opposition parties, indicating the significance the issue has acquired on the national political stage  to articulate their anguish.In the sullen crowd were men like Mohanlal Nagda of Rewli-Devli village in Neemuch district of MP.Nagda had for long avoided looking at the big pile of onions rotting away in a corner of his farm. It invariably brought tears to his eyes. Harvested on his 2-acre land, all 100 quintals of his onion yield now lies dumped. He knows he wont recover the cost if he tries to sell it.The mandi is only 10km away. But Id rather not take my produce there, he said. He quickly did the math. The onions are harvested, but to cut them I must spend Rs 15,000 at Rs 150 per quintal. Transporting it to the mandi will cost Rs 2,500 more at Rs 500 per trolley. I need to spend another Rs 1,500 on loading, unloading and mandi expenses, Nagda told TOI. At Rs 2 per kg, all Id get is Rs 20,000. So, I preferred dumping them, however much it hurts. I spent around Rs 40,000 on cultivation alone. The produce is already decaying. It terrifies me.Maharashtra has declared drought in 151 talukas across 26 districts in the wake of a deficient monsoon. The dry spell has affected an estimated 60% of the 1.6 crore farmers in the state. Due to below average rainfall during sowing season, the output has been hit too. Several areas reported over 70% crop loss and the state sought relief of Rs 7,962 crore from the Centre.But respite looks remote for large chunks. A Nashik farmer recently sent a money order of Rs 1,064 to the PMs office. It was what hed got after selling 750 kg of onion after a crash in prices. It doesnt help that Maharashtra  like many other states  hasnt been able to break cartelisation by wholesale traders and middlemen in market yards to ensure fair pricing. Even implementation of minimum support price (MSP) has not been achieved by the state. Moreover, farmers across India are forced to sell their produce at low rates because the infrastructure to store and process it is lacking.Acting on a report that finances, lack of assistance for healthcare and poor crop output were among the reasons for farm distress, Fadnavis proposed last year that agricultural loans should be waived and farmers can avail fresh aid from financial institutions. In June 2017, the CM announced a loan waiver scheme for 89 lakh farmers; loans amounting to Rs 32,000 crore were to be waived. So far, loans worth Rs 17,000 crore owed by 40 lakh farmers have been waived, while Rs 25,000 crore has been sanctioned for 50 lakh farmers as fresh aid. A raft of schemes has also been drafted to tackle agrarian distress, but implementation is slow owing to lack of coordination and supervision at different levels.Far away in Punjab, farmers are on the warpath over implementation of the Swaminathan Commission recommendations on fixing of MSP of rabi and kharif crops. They also want a complete farm loan waiver, not the partial one okayed by the Amarinder Singh government.Seven farm organisations in Punjab have decided to raise both issues and hold protests on December 18. The organisations have decided on round-the-clock protests outside banks from January 1 to January 5. These groups had earlier stopped the supply of milk and vegetables to urban areas in the state, leading to clashes with milkmen and a lot of produce literally going down the drain.Its a similar story but a different crop in UP. Owing to a bumper harvest this year, potato farmers say they are ruined as the price per 50kg sack has fallen to as low as Rs 20. Cold storages are full of unsold potato. Rakesh Kumar, owner of Mangla Mata cold storage in Badaun, said, Storages in the region have a total capacity of 30 lakh sacks. Of these, 20% are potatoes, but no farmer is coming to fetch them right now because of falling prices. I have already thrown 7,000 sacks while 10,000 more are still here. Selling the produce at villages for Rs 20 per 50 kg sack does not even recover the cost of transportation.Mahendra Swaroop, state president, Cold Storage Association, UP, said, Huge quantities of potato are stuck. District magistrates do not let us dump our produce anywhere as it stinks badly. Haalat kharab ho gayi sab ki."

Lasalgaon APMC is the centre for Niphad.The PMO had sought a report from authorities to know the ground reality and verify Mr. Sathes claim of getting Rs. 1.41 per kg rate. Accordingly, the office of Nashik district deputy registrar of the State cooperation department prepared the report, which said that the Lasalgaon APMC clarified that the onions were of medium to low quality and blackish. They were harvested in summer and fetched Rs. 151 per quintal rate.However, Jaydutt Holkar, chairman of Lasalgaon APMC, said the report was false. Every farmer, irrespective of quality of onions, is getting lower rates due to increased supply to markets in our region, he said."
5ce58f58e8e3fc56af40d276,Turn of Punjab's potato farmers to lose sleep over low prices,http://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2018/dec/17/after-maharashtra-punjab-farmers-losing-sleep-over-low-prices-1912613.html,2018-12-17,"Harpreet Bajwa ByExpress News ServiceCHANDIGARH: Not just onion farmers in Maharashtra, but also those in Punjab, growing potato, too are staring at a bleak future as prices of the crop have crashed.A potato grower, Pawanjot Singh of Dhogri village near Jalandhar, who tilled 250 acres, said, A farmer spends between Rs 9 and Rs 12 to produce a kg of potato. It includes Rs 6- Rs 8 production cost and Rs 3-Rs 4 for harvesting, packaging, cold storage and transportation. The fresh crop, which has hit the market, is being sold for Rs4 per kg. So we are not being able to recover the production cost. The implementation of GST has also bumped up the costs.More than 90 per cent of the potato crop in the state is grown in the Doaba region, which comprises Jalandhar, Kapurthala, Hoshiarpur and Nawanshahr districts. Potato is grown on around 85,000 hectares, and it produces 2.2 million tonnes of the crop.Singh said that retailers are earning from the crop, but farmers are failing to recover the production cost. It is estimated that around 10 lakh bags of potatoes from the previous year are lying in 500 cold storages in the state (each bag has 50 kg). Now, they have been given for free as cattle feed, said Singh, who has 12,000 bags lying in his store. He added that as the crop this year has been infected with blight disease the production is expected to fall. Also, farmers are spending Rs 5,000 extra to save the crop.Jang Bahandur Sangha, Secretary General of Confederation of Potato Seed Farmers, said, Punjab supplies 75 per cent of shed potato (potato seed) to other states. But most states have already sown their crops. Hence, we suspect that our potato seeds will not be sold and there will be no liquidity with the farmers.Potatoes from India are exported to the Middle East, Sri Lanka and Russia. Exporting potatoes are costly as it involves freight charges. The US and the European Union does not allow potato imports and for last two years Pakistan, too, has banned it, said Sangha. The state government has asked the Centre for permission to export potato to Russia, the USA, Iran and Sri Lanka."

The waiver was announced in August but my name was not on the list till November. I have two loans of Rs 2.5 lakh in total but was only eligible for a waiver of Rs 25,000. I went to the BDO and was told I would not even get that money. Instead, I could take Rs 25,000 worth of fertilisers. I told myself, at least I am getting something, Khan said.Formulas to waive farm loans are not uniform across states. Rajasthan, for instance, calculates waivers based on amount of crop damaged, size of land holdings and harvest volume. Others have fixed limits for the amount to be waived.Khan is among thousands around the country who have been stumped by the fine print in waiver schemes. Many farmers across India who TOI spoke to said the hastily put together and poorly executed approach will not solve systemic problems.Waivers cannot be a longterm solution. If the government gives minimum support price according to the market rate, that will be the biggest remedy, Khan added.In Wasadi village of Aurangabad in Maharashtra, Balwant Patilba Nikam, a marginal farmer with less than an acre, explained his situation. I received Rs 12,000 as protsahan (encouragement) from the state government in the runup to loan waivers. Under protsahan, small loans of up to Rs 15,000 are waived. My loan was Rs 12,000. But I needed money for production in the next season, and I ended up taking another loan. The government has to help us out of the debt trap. Partial waivers or small loans waivers alone wont help. The government should help us look at alternatives like poultry farming in addition to cultivation, Nikam said.More than 1,500 km away, in Thiruppurambiam village of Thanjavur district in Tamil Nadu, 55-year-old V Anandan said he hadnt gained much from the waiver or the AIADMK governments process.Sometimes, farmers say, the loan process itself is faulty. I spent Rs 1.25 lakh to grow paddy on my 4.5 acres. According to the norms, and my eligibility, the cooperative society should have given me Rs 1.02 lakh as loan. But they sanctioned Rs 25,000, which was waived by the government. I had to bear the rest of the production cost. In future, if I do not have the money for the sowing season, I will have to apply for another loan, Anandan said.The Swaminathan Committee in 2004 had recommended farmers be allowed to fix the price for their produce on their own (cost of production plus 50% as profit), keeping local factors in mind. Waiving loans wont help, particularly when the loan is only a fraction of our expenses, Anandan added.Pandit Kerba Patil, 46, who has a farm in Kolhapur, Maharashtra, had taken a loan of Rs 1.5 lakh three years ago. Floods destroyed his crop.I could not pay the instalments on time. This continued for two years and the interest went on increasing. Ultimately, I had a debt of Rs 2.5 lakh, he said.When the state government announced the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Shetkari Sanman Yojana in 2017, Patil managed to get Rs 1.5 lakh, his original loan amount, waived. But now, Patil must clear the accrued interest of Rs 1 lakh before getting fresh loans. I have been farming since I was 6 years old. Being debt-ridden for the first time was harrowing, he said.In UPs Ujhaiya Fakirpur village of Mainpuri district, two Dalit brothers Upendra and Bablu, faced a similar dilemma. They had taken a loan of Rs 2 lakh in 2013, but even after a waiver of Rs 1 lakh in 2017, they had to pay Rs 1.8 lakh.Upendra said, When we heard about the loan waiver, we contacted our village lekhpal. Months later, we were informed Rs 1 lakh has been waived from the principal amount. But when we reached our bank, the manager said we had to pay the interest of Rs 80,000. So we paid Rs 1.8 lakh in total.Others have had their loans waived and carry a clean slate, but they too say waivers are not the longterm solution. One of them, Mubarik Ali, in Guleli (Bareilly), had borrowed Rs 1 lakh on his Kisan Credit Card, against which he had repaid Rs 20,000. The outstanding amount has been waived and paid directly to the bank. It was impossible to get another loan till the earlier one was repaid, so this has been a relief. However, the government must focus on three things: crop insurance, better irrigation and subsidised seed and fertilisers. It will reduce our cost. If the entire crop is insured, there will be no need for a waiver at all, Ali said.Farmers are also compelled to take loans, even when they dont want to, as their produce does not get proper prices, said Nivrutti Nyaharkar in Vahegaoin village, Nashik. Nyaharkar, an onion grower, had borrowed Rs 1 lakh six years ago. Within seven months, he was to pay Rs 1.32 lakh. Despite my willingness to repay I could not, as my produce wasnt getting good prices. Moreover, input costs kept increasing. For two years, bad weather affected the harvest, Nyaharkar added. Thankfully, my loan was waived off. But next year ... I may face the same set of problems again.(With reports from Shoeb Khan in Ajmer, Vincent Arockiaraj in Trichy, Syed Rizwanullah in Aurangabad, Rahul Gayakwad in Kolhapur, Priyangi Agarwal in Bareilly, Arvind Chauhan in Mainpuri and Tushar Pawar in Nashik)"

The government is yet to appoint a full-time secretary for the agriculture department, one of the most crucial in the upcoming general and Assembly elections.Both the departments are working very well. None of the schemes are being derailed, no funding has been stopped. It is true that the department does not have an independent minister and secretary. But there has been no dearth of funding for farmer-related projects, said a senior minister. When asked about the cabinet expansion or re-division of cabinet portfolios, he refused to comment saying the Chief Minister has the authority to take the call.Maharashtra was in the middle of controversy recently after a farmer named Sanjay Sathe sent Rs. 1,064 earned from selling onions to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to highlight the low returns on the crop. Following record-break onion production, farmers have been complaining of low returns on the sale of their produce. Up to July, the State has recorded 1,417 farmer suicides. Despite the Chief Ministers assurances, the farm loan waiver scheme announced in June 2017, is yet to reach its target.This government is not serious about the agrarian sector and the 50% of the population which is dependent on farm sector. It is shameful to not have an independent minister and secretary for this department, said Congress spokesperson Sachin Sawant."

Each farmer will get a subsidy of Rs. 200 per quintal, up to 200 quintals of their onion produce.The subsidy is applicable to farmers who have sold produce between November 1 and December 15 this year in the agriculture produce market committees. The decision will not be applicable to the Mumbai APMC. Altogether, Rs. 150 crore will be directly transferred to farmers bank accounts.The Opposition, meanwhile, termed the package as a mockery of the plight of the farmers. This amount comes down to Rs. 2 per kilogram. Will the government explain the logic behind providing such little help to farmers? Nationalist Congress Party State president Jayant Patil said.Onion production in the State takes place in three seasons: kharif, late kharif and rabi. According to government officials, the onion produced in kharif and late kharif seasons cannot be stored for too long, compared to that produced in rabi season.While the total onion production in the State till now is estimated to be around 75 lakh quintal, the agriculture market committees received around 41.23 lakh quintal onion in November.With such a huge supply, the prices have naturally dropped. The onion belt of the State, especially north Maharashtra, is suffering. Todays decision will help to bring relief to farmers, an official said.Last week, as a mark of protest, an onion farmer in Nashik had sent his paltry earnings to the Prime Ministers Office. The PMO had asked for a report from the State government."

Nashik farmers will boycott it,"" said Sanjay Sathe, the onion farmer who had sent the PMO a money order of Rs 1,064, his earnings from the sale of 750 quintals of onions.The farmers demanded at least Rs 800 per quintal for all onion growers. ""Moreover, the grant should continue till the average wholesale onion prices crosses Rs 1,000 per quintal in the wholesale market,"" a farmer said.The state cabinet on Thursday approved a Rs 150 crore budget to enable the payment of Rs 200 per quintal. ""The decision will be applicable in the case of all onions sold between November 1 and December 15 in all the APMC markets except Navi Mumbai. The maximum relief will be given on 200 quintals of onion sold for a farmer, which means the distressed farmer will at least get Rs 40,000 amount in their account,"" said a senior official from the marketing department.Onion farmers have been protesting since November over the low price their produce has been fetching.The average rate of kharif onions in the market was between Rs 750 and Rs 850, compared to between Rs 2,200 and Rs 2,300 last year.Several reasons have been given for the crash, from hoarding of summer onions to reduced demand from nearby states like MP and Karnataka. In the 45 days from November 1 to December 15, 75 lakh quintals of onion were brought to AMPCs across the state. Farmers who sent these onions are eligible for relief.The farmer fraternity said not many had sold onions between November 1 and December 15 since the prices were crashing. A farmer from Ahmednagar district , Shreyas Abhale, had sent a money order of Rs 6 to CM Devendra Fadnavis after selling 2,657 kg of onions at a rate of Rs 1 per kg at the Sangamner wholesale market. He had said that after adjusting market expenses, he was left with only Rs 6.In a related development, over 300 onion farmers staged a three-hour sit-in agitation at the Nampur Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) in Satana taluka of the district on Thursday. The farmers were unhappy that the traders were not giving them sale receipt after buying the produce at a paltry amount of Rs 1 per kg."

He later ploughed the field with a tractor.At the Vinchur sub-market of the Lasalgaon Agriculture Produce Market Committee, which is the countrys largest wholesale market for onions, Maruti Gund was offered Rs 191 per quintal on Wednesday. Upset with the low price, he took the crop back to his farm and ploughed over it.He also tried to sell the produce in the wholesale markets of Ahmednagar and Pune, but he had to spend a lot in transport. When the onion prices started crashing, I sold 47 quintals in Ahmednagar and got Rs 300 per quintal. But I had to spend Rs 200 per quintal on transport, gunny bags, labour cost and other expenses. In the end, I was left with Rs 100 per quintal, he said.Gund then sold 25 quintals of onions in the wholesale market at Pune, but got the rate of Rs 290 per quintal. The quality of summer onions I sold there was very good but nevertheless I got a paltry rate, he added.After all these efforts, he decided to again go to the nearest APMC. He still had over 50 quintals of onions in storage. After I got just Rs 190 a quintal, I took 30 quintals and dumped them on my farmland. At least, I will have good manure and I would not have to spend on fertiliser for the next crop, said Gund.He added that he will similarly be dumping the remaining 20 quintals of onions on his farm. When asked, Gund said, Government should compensate the losses or give grant considering the base rate of Rs 2,000 per quintal to farmers. It should compensate the losses of onion farmers, who have sold or yet to sell, accordingly.On governments ex-gratia of Rs 200 per quintal for onion farmers, he said, We feel it is a mockery of farmers. This will not solve a problem of farmers and we will also not accept the ex-gratia amount. We feel it is a mockery to farmers, he said."

ShutterstockThe slump in onion prices is turning out to be a major concern for the Narendra Modi-government, which has doubled the export incentives to 10 per cent to boost shipments and ensure better returns for farmers.The government on Friday increased the export incentives under the Merchandise Exports from India Scheme (MEIS) to 10 per cent from the existing 5 per cent in the interests of farmers, an official statement said.This will result in better prices for onions in the domestic market. Wholesale prices of onions are subdued at present because of the increase in the arrival of the fresh crop at the mandis, it said.Rewards under the scheme are payable as a percentage of realised free-on-board value and an MEIS duty credit scrip can be transferred or used for payment of a number of duties, including the basic customs duty.In recent weeks, farmers have been blocking highways and dumping onions as the prices have slumped to about Rs 1 per kg in the wholesale markets even though it takes around Rs 8 to produce a kg of the bulb crop. Maharashtra produces more than 30 per cent of the countrys annual onion crop, followed by Karnataka. Onion is usually cultivated four times a year  early kharif, kharif, early rabi and rabi.Onions comprise less than one per cent in terms of value of the countrys agricultural production."
