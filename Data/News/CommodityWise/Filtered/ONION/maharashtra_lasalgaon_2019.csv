It includes setting up 24 clusters for tomatoes, onions and potatoes (TOP) and initiating an exercise to have an exclusive ""trade map"" for these three high priority produce.The idea behind the move is to enhance value realisation of these perishable horticultural produce by farmers. It will happen through targeted interventions and linking the farmers with both domestic and international markets.""The TOP's trade map, being prepared by the ministry, will have all the details (varieties, price trend, buyers, sellers and processors) which may help in price and demand forecasting. We have been in touch with experts in Scotland, Russia and other countries to compile round the year data on buyers and producers,"" said an official.He said such basic moves would directly help lakhs of farmers in the exclusive TOP clusters in Maharashtra , Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Gujarat , Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and West Bengal ""Tomato, onion and potato clusters will be set up for agricultural processing under the TOP scheme. Focus on price and demand forecasting will enable farmers to choose which crop to sow in order to maximise benefit,"" said Union agriculture minister Radha Mohan Singh.He told TOI on Monday that these efforts and all the other measures, taken by the government in the past over four years, would go a long way in addressing farmers' concerns. ""The success of the government's plan and policies is reflected in record production of food-grains and horticultural produce in 2017-18,"" said Singh.The government is meanwhile, working on various proposals to extend financial help to farmers. Such proposals include waiving off interest for farmers who repay crop loans on time to providing income support for meeting input costs and lowering premium of existing crop insurance schemes.The TOP had got the government's focus when it announced 'Operation Greens' with an outlay of Rs 500 crore in its 2018-19 budget. It's aim is to stabilise supply of tomatoes, onions and potatoes and ensure their availability throughout the country round the year without price volatility.""Exclusive clusters for TOP, on the other hand, will help farmers in realising better prices through its linkages with markets,"" said A K Singh, deputy director general, Horticultural Science and Crop Science Divisions of the ICAR.He said, ""Increase in processing capabilities and setting up of a market intelligence network under the scheme to collect and collate real-time data on demand and supply will help farmers in a big way.""At present, farmers have to dump their produce on the streets or sell it at throwaway prices in case of bumper production as they don't have access to adequate processing facilities.

The produce reaching the market is not getting sold or getting low price from traders, who still have stock to clear.Nashik traders send onions to New Delhi, Bihar and other states in North India, West Bengal, and the North East states. They prefer to transport by rail rather than road as it is cost effective and quick. While it costs Rs 5 per kg to transport onions by road, it costs only Rs 2.5 per kg by the Railways.The traders claimed that at present, they are getting one rake (each with 40 wagons) once in two-three days, though they have sought three rakes a day, considering the huge supply of onions from farmers. A delegation of Nashik traders led by the chairman of the state agriculture commission, Pasha Patel, discussed the issue with Union road transport minister Nitin Gadkari a couple of days back.Railway is an effective means of transportation. About 1,600 tonnes of onions may be transported at a time through one rake. While there is demand of three rakes a day, onion traders are getting only one rake after every two-three days, Patel said. He claimed that during their meeting, Gadkari spoke to railway minister Piyush Goyal , who has assured them that more rakes would be sent. The railway minister has assured Gadkari that immediate steps would be taken to increase the rakes in Nashik, said Patel.According to him, traders do not buy fresh onions from farmers till their stock is cleared. Hence, there is need to increase the transport of onions by rail and adequate rakes must be made available for the purpose, Patel added.About 2 lakh quintals of onions are auctioned a day in district APMCs during peak period. Sohanlal Bhandari, president of Nashik district onion traders association, said that recently, there was huge arrivals of onions in Agriculture Produce Market Committees. Ideally, Nashik traders need 20 rakes a week, he said. Recently, we had urged the railway administration to provide us more rakes, but it did not. This affected our despatch of onions during the peak period. We want railway administration to provide rakes as per our demand, said Bhandari.A railway official, requesting anonymity, told TOI that they had provided rakes whenever they got a demand. He claimed that the railways had provided 700 wagons from Niphad and Kherwadi stations in the past one month. Jaydatta Holkar, chairman Lasalgaon APMC, which is the largest wholesale onion market in the country, said that wholesale onion prices may increase by Rs 200 per quintal if traders are able to despatch their consignments by rail on regular basis.Availability of rakes on regular basis will help traders to increase onion procurement and that may result into rise in wholesale onion prices by at least Rs 200 per quintal from the present level, said Holkar.
