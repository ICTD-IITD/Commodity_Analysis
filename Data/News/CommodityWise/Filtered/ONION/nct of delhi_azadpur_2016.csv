Photo: Sushil Kumar Verma: After having to deal with repeated spikes in the prices of onions during the last fiscal, there is finally a huge respite for people. Wholesale rates of the edible bulb have crashed to as low as Rs 4.5 per kilo in the Capital owing to a glut of supplies from Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra.Bumper harvestThe bumper harvest this year, however, has left farmers in tears with reports suggesting that prices have fallen to an all-time-low of Rs. 30 paise per kg at Madhya Pradeshs mandi in Neemuch district.There has been surplus onion production across the country this time, and the demand is relatively low. The farmers are badly hit as they spend at least Rs. 12 per kg in the entire process of producing the crop, excluding their labour cost, said Rajender Sharma, member of Azadpur, Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC).In Delhi, which primarily relies on these two states among a few others for onions, the situation is equally grim.

The poor-quality and the smaller ones are being bought by traders at Rs.3.5 per kg, a jump of Re.1 from April. The retail prices in the city range between Rs.19 per kg and Rs. 21 per kg.When compared to the data of onion prices at Azadpur Mandi in the previous year, then its the lowest this month. On May 25 last year, the rates were Rs. 18.50 per kg. In August 2015, the rates jumped to a staggering Rs. 53 per kg, and the average cost itself was Rs. 39. In January, too, the price was as high as Rs. 17 per kg.The reason for the constant fall in prices is the bumper harvest of onions this year. Demand of this staple kitchen commodity remains almost the same throughout the year, except on occasions like Navratri where it only decreases. But, we have a huge surplus of onion produce this time which is far more than the average consumption, said Rajender Sharma, member of Azadpur, Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC).Monsoon dampenerAnother cause for further decline in prices of the edible bulb is the impending monsoons. According to traders of Azadpur mandi, touted to be Asias largest wholesale fruits and vegetables market, poor to medium quality onions cover almost 70 per cent of the total daily arrival of the vegetable.Rains are going to come in about 15 days, so we are not left with much time to do away with the poor-quality onions. Otherwise, the rains will rot them and they would have to be thrown away, he added.For farmers, the situation is a nightmare. The farmers are badly hit as they spend at least Rs. 12 per kg in the entire process of producing the crop, excluding their labour cost, which alone amounts to about Rs.13,000, said another member of APMC.The reason for the constant fall in prices is the bumper harvest of onions this year"

(Express Photo: Narendra Vaskar) The Vashi mandi, situated 35 km from the Mumbai main city. (Express Photo: Narendra Vaskar)Spread over 70 hectares land off the Old Mumbai-Pune highway, its a place where more than Rs 10,000 crore worth of fruits, vegetables and other farm produce gets traded annually. But right now, its also the scene of a prabodhan, a mass awakening campaign by traders and commission agents that could gather pace in the days ahead.The Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) at Vashi, barely 35 km from the main Mumbai city, is one of Maharashtras 305 regulated mandis where produce is first traded before being taken for consumption elsewhere. While the smallest of these may have a yearly turnover of below Rs 25 lakh, the Vashi APMC is the largest and also a terminal market receiving daily over 2,000 trucks that ferry produce from both within and outside Maharashtra. Last year alone, this mandi saw arrivals of 8,93,444 tonnes of onions and potatoes, 5,64,056 tonnes of other vegetables and 6,63,831 tonnes of fruits.Currently, though, a single factor is uniting the market players operating in regulated mandis across Maharashtra irrespective of size: The state governments move to delist fruits and vegetables (F&V) from the purview of the APMC Act. This, if it happens as was done by the Delhi government in September 2014, would dispense with the requirement for all F&V to be brought to mandis and sold through licensed market agents charging commission fees. Such fees in the Vashi APMC amount to 6.5 per cent of the purchase price of onions and potatoes, 8 per cent for other vegetables and 10 per cent for fruits.Watch Video: Whats making newsThe notification delisting F&V will be issued in the next few days. The issue has been pending since long and we have decided to go ahead taking into account the interest of farmers, said Chandrakant Patil, Maharashtras minister for cooperation.This isnt the first attempt at a significant agricultural marketing reform. In 2012, Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil, who was agriculture minister in the previous Congress-NCP regime, had announced the intent at delisting horticultural produce from the state APMC Acts purview. A final decision, however, could not be taken following strong trader protests.The possibility of the reform going through is seen to be higher under the present BJP-Shiv Sena dispensation. A major reason for it is that the APMCs  like sugar and various other rural-based cooperatives  are largely controlled by the NCP and Congress. The ruling alliance partners have little presence in APMC boards that are supposed to have elected directors representing all stakeholders, including farmers, traders and mandi labourers. The Vashi APMC is now under a state government-appointed administrator, with the earlier board of directors superseded for alleged malpractices.The total turnover of APMCs in Maharashtra is roughly Rs 50,000 crore. Delisting of F&V may bring this down by Rs 10,000 crore. But even this neednt be the case, as we have seen in Delhi, where business at Azadpur mandi has not suffered after delisting. We are only giving farmers an option, which includes supplying directly to processors or supermarkets. Theres nothing stopping them from continuing to sell through APMCs, pointed out Patil.F&V contribute over Rs 3,000 crore to the Vashi APMCs yearly turnover of Rs 10,000-12,000 crore.APMCs were originally established with a view to prevent exploitation of farmers by intermediaries, who compelled them to dispose of their produce at the farmgate at very low prices. By mandating all farm produce to be brought to regulated market yards and sold through auctions, the APMC mechanism was meant to ensure fair prices to farmers. But in many cases, these bodies have themselves become dens for cartelisation by traders, who control prices and charge hefty commission fees on produce transactions.An extreme case that surfaced recently was of Devidas Maruti Parbhane. This farmer from Vadgaon Rasai, a village in Pune districts Shirur taluka, supplied one tonne of onions early this month at the local market yard under the Pune APMCs jurisdiction. The price he got  a little more than Rs 1.5 per kg  was itself very low. But adding insult to injury was the various cuts imposed on top of this.A scrutiny of Parbhanes patti (trade slip) by The Indian Express revealed his total revenues from the sale of one tonne of onions at Rs 1,523.20. The total cuts even on this meager amount added up to Rs 1,522.20. That included commission fees of Rs 91.30, hamali or labour charges of Rs 59, bharai or filling-in-bags charges of Rs 18.55, tolai or loading charges of Rs 33.30, and transport charges of Rs 1,320 (as the kutcha patti issued in Shirur was billed for delivery at Pune). Parbhane, at the end of it, was left with a net earning of Re 1: When after the auction, the trader handed me a Re 1 coin, I was flabbergasted. Maybe, he should not have taken the trouble to pay me even that!Traders, however, dismiss these as one-off incidents, while claiming that delisting of F&V would ultimately hurt even farmers. The produce brought by farmers is not uniform, which is what processors want. The APMCs are tuned to handle variety. Here, we have 50-55 varieties of vegetables and 25-30 varieties of fruits arriving on a daily basis. Such variety will disappear once delisting happens. Moreover, instead of a centralised marketplace, youll have small and medium vehicles carrying farm produce and creating traffic mayhem in Mumbai, warned Rajendra Shelke, a leading onion and potato commission agent at the Vashi APMC.Besides, the APMC system guarantees that the farmer is paid for his produce, which wouldnt be the case if he were to sell directly? The proposed reform looks good on paper, but it will only spell doom for the farmer and end up completely destroying the agrarian economy, he added.Sanjay Pansare, who represents traders at the Vashi APMCs fruit market, justified the high commission rates on grounds that the goods being handled here were perishable and prone to quality deterioration. Only around a quarter of the produce brought to the market is eventually of the best quality; the rest falls between medium and bad. The losses borne by traders on this count have to, therefore, be made up through higher commission fees. Since 2002, the Maharashtra government has been issuing marketing licenses to various entities for procuring directly from the farmgate. Besides, 34 private markets have been allowed to be set up. But despite this, an estimated 75 per cent of annual arrivals of F&V in the state still take place in APMCs. The proportions are lower at 46 per cent for cotton and 25-30 per cent in oilseeds and foodgrains.Delisting F&V from the purview of the APMC ActThis isnt the first attempt at a significant agricultural marketing reform. In 2012, Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil, who was agriculture minister in the previous Congress-NCP regime, had announced the intent at delisting horticultural produce from the state APMC Acts purview. A final decision, however, could not be taken following strong trader protests APMCs were originally established with a view to prevent exploitation of farmers by intermediaries, who compelled them to dispose of their produce at the farmgate at very low prices.

Now they fear that prices will keep going south.Traders at Azadpur Mandi told The Hindu on Sunday that while all vegetables saw a marginal to medium dip in prices, onions, an important produce, fell by nearly Rs.300 for a 40-kg pack.Hardeep Bhalla, an onion wholesaler at Azadpur Mandi, said a 40-kg pack of onions was selling for Rs. 800 three days ago. He added that from the 180 trucks arriving daily, the number is down to just 100.Businessmen at Azadpur fruits and vegetables wholesale market claimed that dearth of cash has forced others in the supply chain, be it small vendors or middlemen, to either not buy at all or cut down on the quantities they procure. The business in mandis, or at least the onward sale to locals, has been running mostly on credit. While wholesalers understand the compulsion, many middlemen who earlier bought on credit now insist on paying in cash or refuse to buy at all.This puts added pressure on us since we are cash-strapped. Unsold stocks means no hope of payment in the next few days either, said Devesh, who also deals in onions. Stating that he gets his stocks from States like Maharashtra and Karnataka, he said the first signs of reduced supply are visible.However, if supply is limited, the reduced liquidity has forced retail buyers to stay away as well. Which is why Azadpur Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee member Rajender Sharma said consumers may not be affected, at least in the short run, due to the prices these things are being sold.Some cash flow following withdrawal at banks has revived hopes, with small vendors coming to market with Rs.100 notes.All vegetables saw a marginal to medium dip in prices, but onions fell by Rs.300 for 40-kg pack"

Suthar says he used to buy at least five kilos of each vegetable daily. Now, I cant buy more than two kilos. I dont have cashcant give change to my customers, he said.Shahzad Ali, a commission agent at the Navin Anaj Mandi in Ghaziabad, used to sell 200-300 quintals of rice daily. His current sales stand at 30-40 quintals.Traders, both retail and wholesale, in Delhi-NCR are feeling the pinch of Centres demonetisation move. Though prices of essential commodities such as wheat, rice, pulses and vegetables have remained stable so far but traders warned that they may increase if the current situation continues to prevail.Wholesalers in Delhi-NCR mandis say that the supply of grains and vegetables has also been hit because transporters have not been able to pay truck drivers. In fact, the entire supply chain which includes from the main wholesaler at the top to the loader at the mandi at the bottom, have been hit due to lack of cash inflow.Azadpur Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee member Rajender Sharma said,We are taking goods from farmers mostly on credit. The vendors and middlemen are also buying from us on credit. This has ensured that the supply we get is less and the quantity being sold is lesser. We cant get a lot and also sell little, too, on credit. The situation wont improve unless the currency chaos gets stabilised, Sharma said.At Khandsa Mandi, the largest wholesale fruit and vegetables market in Gurgaon, the number of trucks bringing onion have come down from 10 to four since last week. The supply of tomato has also been hit.Inderjeet Thakran, president, Gurgaon sabzi mandi, said farmers have refused sell for lack of cash and it might lead to price rise. We dont have buyers even when the supply has reduced drastically, he said. Vegetables were piling up at Khandsa Mandi on Wednesday as retailers did not turn up. The supply has come down by half as trucks remain stranded in several parts of the country, Thakran said.Read: No old currency please, Ghaziabad man adds note to daughters wedding cardTruck operators in Delhi-NCR said nearly half of their 4.5 lakh vehicles have come to a standstill. The All India Motor Transport Congress (AIMTC) said about two lakh trucks have not reached Delhi-NCR with supplies in last few days.In some cases, traders are managing transactions through credit and receipts since Friday but non-payment of dues is having a cascading effect. The retailers are not paying wholesalers who are further not able to pay to suppliers and farmers. And, if perishable items like fruits and vegetables are not picked up by retailers, it would cause losses to wholesalers.At Navin Anaj Mandi in Govindpuram, Ghaziabad, the inflow of supply trucks has gone down by at least 60%. We are also not accepting old notes for Mandi Shulk (2% market charge on traders sale) since November 8. Arrival has reduced to 30-40%. Some traders might be taking the old notes but the majority is accepting the other denomination, said Rajesh Yadav, secretary, Mandi Samiti.Farmers are also hit hard. A group of farmers said they are finding it difficult to arrange fertilizer even as the time is ripe to sow wheat.The shops and other markets where we go to purchase fertilizer are now demanding new notes. We have none left now. If in the next 10 days the fields are now provided fertilizer, wheat crop will be affected, said Nooran, a farmer from Piplehda village in Masuri.(Gulam Jeelani, Rashpal in Gurgaon, Peeyush Khandelwal in Ghaziabad and Ritam Halder in New Delhi)"

Like about 100 other agents, Ilyas buys vegetable produce from mandis in Maharashtra Karnataka , Rajasthan, etc, from where it is transported on trucks to Noida.""A consignment was coming from Kota and I had to pay the driver Rs 30,000. However, since I did not have enough cash to pay him, I paid Rs 10,000 and told him to take the balance amount from me later,"" he said.While most of the transporters are accepting old banknotes, agents dread the time (December 15) when officials at the national highways stop accepting the old notes. Ilyas sells the onion and garlic he buys from the middlemen.""The middlemen too do not have enough cash, so they are buying only limited produce. We can't expect them to pay us the entire amount,"" he said, adding that his sales have been hit almost by 50%. Holding a torn 1,000-rupee note, he rues that a middleman, who wished to pay him in old notes, tore up the note out of frustration. ""I understand that the customers cannot purchase the produce even if they want to,"" he said.""Earlier, if I would buy produce worth Rs 1 lakh, now I have deliberately cut down my purchase to almost half since the 500-and 1,000-rupee notes were demonetised,"" he told TOI.While some agents have started using cheques for payment to sellers, most of them cannot use the facility since they hold accounts in bank branches in their native districts.The mandi also has a lot of agents buying fruit from Delhi's Azadpur mandi . Unlike onion and potatoes, fruits are more prone to deterioration and discolouration.Manoj Kumar, a helper with one of the agents, said that many middlemen have limited their purchase post-demonetisation.Most of the labourers working for the middlemen have not been paid their wages for more than a week."

If we don't have money, how can we pay our labourers, farmer, and transporter? said Metharam Kriplani, president of Chamber of Azadpur Fruit and Vegetable Traders.Some market players said tax authorities have raided big traders in Azadpur, a major regional hub. Others said sellers were reluctantly accepting Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes from large buyers.For how long can you run a business in debt? Even paying half amount to farmers for their sale of produce is not solving the problem as it is leading to poor supplies and lowering the purchasing power of traders. The market will crash, said Mukesh Tiwari, past chairman of Ghazipur mandi. The solution is to install card machines, said Balkrishan Sharma, who buys vegetables worth Rs 1-2 lakh a day for 50-100 vegetable vendors.Kriplani, an apple trader, said prices have fallen in the past four days from Rs 30 to Rs 20 a kg. Its a big loss for farmers. Further, the business is down by 30%-40%.Agricultural markets look deserted and offer ample parking space and very few trucks. Onion trader Abid Ali of Abdul Alin and Company said the number of trucks from Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Karnataka, where the harvest was going on, has fallen. With lack of buyers  small street vendors, shopkeepers and aggregators for hotels and restaurants  the sale has crashed. Onion price in mandis is in the range of Rs 5-Rs 10 a kg, while in retail, it is selling at Rs 30/kg.Tuntun Bhagat, who retails vegetables in east Delhi, said. The first two days, I gave credit to regular customers, but since I didnt have the money, I couldnt get supplies. On Saturday, I stood in line for five hours and today I have been able to comake a purchase.With potato harvest season beginning in Punjab and Himachal, farmers and aggregators like Bilal from Una are not happy. We are not getting good rates. Then there is fight over notes.Surjit Mandal had brought banana and colocasia plant (arbi) from Meerut to the Ghazipur mandi. I took a Rs 4,000 loan to come here expecting to earn Rs 8,000-Rs 9,000. But therere no buyers, he said.Farmers are delaying payments to labourers who cut the produce, gunny bag sellers, transporters and mandi workers. Those who trust me are giving me their service. I am also trusting the babu who said he will pay me half for my produce and rest after a month, said Iqbal from Shamli.The babu Iqbal was referring to is Mukesh Dhingra, a trader in Ghazipur, who has a huge pile of cauliflower and hardly any buyer. Ani Kumar, who trades capsicum, has even asked farmers not to send produce as he did not have money."
