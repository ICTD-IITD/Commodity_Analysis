In the first phase MahaFPC, the consortium of FPCs in Maharashtra, are planning to venture in the Azadpur mandi in Delhi to sell onions.The FPC movement in Maharashtra has seen much action over the last year or so. Working under the banner of MahaFPC, the FPCs had purchased more than 25,000 MT of tur last year. The FPCs had opened village-level purchase centres and had purchased the produce on behalf of the Small Farmers Agri business Consortium (SFAC).Yogesh Thorat, managing director of MahaFPC, had said that purchases by the MahaFPC had helped stabilise tur prices in the local wholesale markets.MahaFPCs move to enter traditional markets comes at a time when the state government is encouraging farmer and FPCs to explore alternate markets or to go for retail markets. Asked about their decision to go for the traditional wholesale markets, Thorat said it would be easier to be part of the wholesale chain rather than the retail markets. Onion, Thorat said, was a classic example of a produce from Maharashtra which fetches better returns in Delhi market than the local markets. We aim to directly sell the onions from Maharashtra in Delhis markets, bypassing the various intermediaries, he said.In the first phase, Thorat said, MahaFPC will be concentrating on onions and slowly venture into other fresh fruits and vegetables. On an average, the Azadpur market sees the arrival of around 100-115 trucks of onions and in the next two years, we aim to corner at least 20 per cent of the arrival, he said. The wholesale trade in Azadpur and other places is mostly controlled by traders who purchase produce mostly in Maharashtra.The ground level procurement, sorting and grading will be done by the FPCs, while MahaFPC will act as facility coordinator. A Nashik-based FPC will be venturing into the trade of onion with Thorat hoping to start the process by the end of this month. We are hopeful that we will get the grant from the state government for the same, he said.For all the latest Pune News, download Indian Express App"
5a0d8dd69855b76bf13d01a4,Vendors warn of acute shortage of tomatoes,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/vendors-warn-of-acute-shortage-of-tomatoes/articleshow/59763290.cms,2017-07-26,"NEW DELHI: While tomato prices are threatening to go up even further in Delhi, having already touched Rs 100 per kg this season, vendors in the Azadpur Mandi warn of an acute shortage of this vegetable in the next few days. The reason they cite is illegal occupation of some sheds in the wholesale market because of which several tomato traders have been sitting on a dharna.""We have been protesting for the past six days and met labour minister Gopal Rai on Tuesday, asking that the illegal occupation of our sheds be stopped. However, we have been given no assurances and on Friday, we will go on strike,"" said Anil Malhotra, general secretary of the vegetable traders' association.On Tuesday, about 2,000-2,500 tonnes of tomatoes arrived at the mandi against a normal arrival of about 12,000-16,000 tonnes. Sources said there was a country-wide shortage of tomatoes due to heavy rain in several states and only produce from Himachal Pradesh was reaching Delhi. ""Tomatoes sold for Rs 70-80 per kg in the mandi on Tuesday, which means that in the retail market, one can expect prices to rise to Rs 110 or even Rs 120 in the coming two-three days,"" warn a trader.While the shortfall was expected, the agitation by tomato traders has resulted in an even lesser arrival of tomatoes, said Metha Ram Kriplani, another trader. ""On July 20, APMC issued notices to companies that have illegally occupied seven tomato sheds and two sheds of mausambi. That is a clear acknowledgement that their occupation of the said sheds is illegal. Despite that, no action has been taken against them till now,"" said Kriplani. ""We want our sheds back and want action against officials who have colluded with the encroachers. Unless the encroachment is removed, we will continue with our strike on Friday.""Minister Rai said that he met representatives of both camps on Tuesday and the best solution that he had for this problem was to reallocate the sheds. ""If one camp is claiming that the other has occupied sheds illegally, then this is how sheds have been occupied in the mandi for years. I have spoken to officials as well and now the allotment will be on the basis on payment of market fees. Space will be allocated in proportion to market fees paid. The same exercise had to be carried out with the potato and onion traders as well,"" he added."
5a0971d49855b76bf13cbab5,Tomato traders stick to strike plan despite government word,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/tomato-traders-stick-to-strike-plan-despite-government-word/articleshow/59782075.cms,2017-07-27,"NEW DELHI: A section of the tomato traders at Azadpur Mandi is persisting with its decision to go on a strike from Monday even as the government announced that there would be fresh allotment of tomato sheds.The city is facing an acute shortage of the vegetable, resulting in retail prices crossing Rs 100 per kg. Traders have warned of a further increase in price if their protests continue.Two sections of growers, each accusing the other of having occupied the sheds illegally, have been sitting on dharnas at the wholesale market for a week. The Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) had issued a notice to one section on July 20, saying ""it has come to our notice that the following firms have illegally put up their boards at some tomato sheds even as they have no permission from APMC Azadpur, nor has there been any change made by the Tomato Traders Association"". The notice gives them three days after its receipt to remove their boards.""If APMC has issued them notices for illegal occupation , why is the government bent upon reallocation of sheds. We stand by our decision to go on a strike from Monday because we believe that vested interests have prevailed upon the government to take this decision,"" said Metharam Kriplani , a trader.The notice issued by the government, after meetings with both sets of traders on Tuesday, says that fresh allotments of tomato sheds will be made on the basis of the market fee received from individual commission agents in the past three financial years  2014-15, 2015-16 and 2016-17. ""This will be done on the pattern of allotment made for potato and onion trade,"" said a senior government official."

The protest is against the government's decision to reallocate tomato sheds with a section of traders blaming another group of illegal occupation of these facilities.""About 85-90% of the mandi is likely to be shut. Some commission agents may continue to operate but almost everyone has promised to join in. We informed growers about Monday's strike last week. Trucks that were due to arrive at the mandi on Sunday night or early Monday won't come,"" said Metha Ram Kriplani, a vegetable trader.Last week, after meeting both groups that have been blaming each other of encroachment, development minister Gopal Rai had announced that the reallocation would be done based on the market fees submitted by traders over the past three years.""There is a cartel that needs to be broken. The government had earlier seen a similar problem with onion and potato traders and was successful in breaking those,"" said a senior official. As far as Monday's strike is concerned, he said, it is being done by a small section of traders and the government is not anticipating any severe disruption.The section of traders that has called the strike said the agricultural produce marketing committee (APMC) had sent a notice to the other side, saying they should vacate seven tomato and three mausambi sheds that they had illegally occupied. ""If there was a genuine misunderstanding, why would APMC issue them the notice? It is a clear proof that even the government found those traders in the wrong. In that case, why is there a reallocation of sheds?"" asked a trader.The strike, if it is as severe as traders claim it would be, may impact availability of fruits and vegetables and their price. The city is already witnessing a sharp rise in prices of tomatoes and onions due to reduced supply during the monsoon."

Onion prices have touched Rs 40 per kg over the last couple of days, rising from the earlier rate of Rs 30 per kg.Food and civil supplies minister Imran Hussain directed the department to conduct surprise inspections in major wholesale markets of Delhi to check hoarding. ""The minister has directed the department to carry out intense inspections of wholesale markets such as Azadpur Mandi, Okhla Mandi, Ghazipur Mandi, Keshopur Mandi. He has also asked for inspections at retail markets as well,"" said a government official.""Since fruits and vegetables arrive at the wholesale markets at night, usually around 3am, and the sale takes place early in next morning, the teams will be carrying out inspections between 3am and 7am. They will also visit go-downs of the commission agents, wholesellers and retailers to check for hoarding,"" the official added."

Onion prices have seen almost 100 per cent rise in past couple of weeks. Alarmed over the situation, Centre has directed the States to take proper measures including imposing stock limits to control the price surge.Prices of Onion which used to sell at Rs 20 Rs Kg or even at lesser rates have surged to Rs Rs 40 KG and more in Delhi and other cities across the country.Wholesale traders in Delhi claimed that the reason is due to a shortfall in supplies from Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. These regions have seen a deficit in rainfall which affected production in these States. On the contrary, many states like Rajasthan and Gujarat witness excess rain leading to damage of crops, said Surender Goyal, a trader in Azadpur wholesale market in the national capital.Traders claimed currently supply is mainly from Maharashtra.There might be possibility of hoarding or profiteering by the traders in Maharashtra leading to the surge in price. Supply in Delhi and other parts have come down and it will remain low in coming weeks due to heavy rain in Maharashtra these days, added Goyal.Officials of the Consumer Affairs ministry said that hoardings cant be ruled out at this stage to make a profit out of the current situation.Seeing this, states have been told to keep watch on such elements and take proper action accordingly. They can also impose stock limit to avoid hoardings, said an official.Meanwhile, the traders claimed that the situation will remain similar for some days as the new crop will start arriving from September onwards.Supply will start improving only after mid-September and till then price will remain in the range of Rs 30-40 a kg, said another trader.Onion price risePrices of Onion which used to sell at Rs 20 Rs Kg or even at lesser rates have surged to Rs Rs 40 KG and more in Delhi and other cities across the country.Supply has come down due to bad weather in many parts of the country.States have been told to keep watch on hoardings and take proper action accordingly.

However, Delhi is getting roughly half its supply (or a little less) from Nashik and if the strike continues into the next week, we will probably see a rise in wholesale prices by Rs 5-6 per kg. In the retail market, this amounts to nothing. Furthermore, if supply from Nashik does come down, then supply from Rajasthan and UP will automatically go up,"" said Metharam Kriplani from the Azadpur Mandi Delhi gets about 100 trucks of onion every day , which could go up to a maximum of 150.At present, about 50 trucks are coming from Nashik, while the remaining are coming from Rajasthan."
