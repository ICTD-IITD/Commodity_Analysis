Despite this, India exports only 43,000 MT mangoes, which accounts for 0.2 per cent of the total production.Mango growers in the country are planning to increase the volume of export of their produce to the United States this year. Last year, India exported 271 metric tonnes of mangoes to the US. Officials hope the figure will go up to 400 tonnes this year.Succulent Indian mangoes take a circuitous route through the countrys onion belt to head for the US. A sprawling irradiation facility set up in Lasalgaon, located 240 km north of Mumbai and approved by the United States agriculture department, treats these mangoes before they are exported.Till a decade ago, Indian mangoes had been banned from the US market for a period of 17 years over fears that pests would be imported through these mangoes.It was only in March 2006 that the then US President George W Bush during his India visit signed an agreement allowing the import of Indian mangoes to that country.India cultivates mangoes on nearly 2.2 lakh hectares and has production in the range of 19.51 million tonnes. It accounts for nearly 40 per cent of the total mango production in the world. Nearly 30 varieties of mangoes are grown in India, with Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka having the highest production.Despite this, India exports only 43,000 MT mangoes, which accounts for 0.2 per cent of the total production.The major five importing countries of Indian mangoes are UAE, Bangladesh, UK, Saudi Arabia, and Nepal.Interestingly, in spite of the high returns that the US market gives, exports to that country did not look up once the ban on Indian markets was lifted.Officials at Krushi Utpadan Sanrakshan Kendra (KRUSHAK), the irradiation centre, however, said they hoped to export 400 tonnes to the US this year.The US market would fetch an exporter four times the price than to any other country. Last year, the price fetched per tonne of exports was Rs 70,360. In the US, it was Rs 2.55 lakh. It is the fear of maintaining standards that is keeping Indians away from this market. This year, we hope we will reach the 400-tonne mark to the US, said a Maharashtra State Agriculture Management Board official.The irradiation plant set up at a cost of Rs 8 crore in 2002 was initially meant to treat onions. The members of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service of the United States agriculture department had subsequently visited the plant and have a go-ahead for the facilitys compliance for mangoes too.Before 2007, Indian mangoes had for 17 years faced non-trade barriers, such as sanitary and phyto-sanitary (plant health) measures, from the US, which feared pests like fruit flies and weevils could be imported through mangoes.However, this mango quarantine through irradiation has allayed the fears. During irradiation, foods are exposed briefly to a radiant energy source such as gamma rays or electron beams. This not only helps in killing harmful bacteria but also increases the shelf life of the fruit.The facility built by the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre has a processing capacity of 1 tonne every hour and BARC charges Rs 500 to irradiate every tonne of mango.Varieties like Alphonso are too sweet for the palate of Americans. It is Kesar that sells in those markets. A single Kesar fetches close to a dollar. However the packing, quality maintenance and paper work involved puts off most traders from approaching the US market, said Shirish Jain, a Gujarat-based exporter of Indian mangoes.For all the latest Cities News, download Indian Express App"

The previous record was 194 lakh tonnes in 2013-14.""Onion production is going to be a record at 203 lakh tonnes this year. Better prices during the kharif (summer) season encouraged farmers to bring more area under onion in the rabi (winter) season,"" National Horticultural Research and Development Foundation (NHRDF) Director R P Gupta told PTI.Favourable climatic conditions have also encouraged the rabi crop prospects and yields are expected to be better than last year, he said, adding unlike last year, there were no unseasonal rains and hailstorm this time.Onion has been grown in 12 lakh hectare this year, slightly higher than 11.73 lakh hectare last year.Stating that rabi onion crop condition is good at present, the NHRDF chief said total rabi output is estimated to be higher by 15-20 per cent as compared to year ago.""The harvesting of rabi crop started in Maharashtra, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh. It is only rabi onion which is stored for use in lean season. Farmers and traders have started storage of onion,"" Gupta said.Around 45 lakh tonnes of expected to be stored in the current year due to availability of good quality of onion bulb in the market, he added.On prices, Gupta said farmers are getting an average Rs 8 per kg in Lasalgaon in Maharashtra, Asia's biggest wholesale market for onion and earning minimum 20 per cent profit over the cost of production.Nearly 60 per cent of India's annual output comes from the rabi season, while the kharif and late-kharif sowing seasons contribute 20 per cent each.Rabi onion is grown in almost all states, but major growing states are Maharashtra, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, West Bengal, Bihar, Rajasthan, Odisha, and Uttar Pradesh."

Picture by Prashant Mitra Onion prices may have fallen drastically in Ranchi, but potato is now acting pricey. The staple, which used to cost around Rs 10-12 a kilo till a fortnight ago, is now available between Rs 16 and Rs 20. Wholesale traders said potato prices were high this year due to poor production in different parts of the country and they might escalate further. ""We are selling potatoes to local traders in the range between Rs 1,500 and Rs 1,600 per quintal because of poor production of potatoes this year in states such as Bengal and Uttar Pradesh. There is the threat of another spurt in prices,"" S. Lal, a trader in Chaibasa, told The Telegraph. Kesto Mahto, who sells potato, onion, garlic at the local Kokar market near Distillery Bridge, said: ""What can we do when we get the potatoes at higher rates from the wholesale markets? In the summers, potatoes also start rotting soon."" Not surprisingly, Ranchi residents are dismayed with the prices of the essential commodity. ""If the rate goes beyond Rs 20 per kg, we will reduce potato consumption. After all, potatoes are not healthy for diabetic and obese people,"" said Anita Jain, a resident on Lake Road area. No step to check the prices has yet been taken by the Jharkhand Agriculture Marketing Board, as no directives have been issued to the wholesale traders so far regarding price control or stock maintenance. Asked, managing director of the board Rajkumar said he had returned from Bengal recently and needed to find out whether any circular had been issued. This summer is also spelling bad news for vegetable budgets. As the mercury soars, vegetable production falls while marriage season keeps demand on the higher side. Most veggies such as cauliflower, cabbage, pointed gourd (parwal), bottle gourd (lauki) sell for around Rs 20-Rs 30 per kg. Capsicum and coriander leaves cost a whopping Rs 60 per kg. ""These prices won't fall before July,"" said a vegetable dealer."

Prime Minister Narendra Modi will kickstart the celebrations in Uttar Pradesh on May 26.At a meeting of all its MLAs, MPs and office-bearers from Maharashtra, the BJP on Monday finalised the programme which will be rolled out between May 26 and June 15. Two Union Cabinet Ministers also attended the meeting. The programmes will be in sync with those across the country.The BJP state unit chief Raosaheb Danve, said at least 26 central Ministers will travel across the State, and hold meetings and rallies during this time to highlight the governments achievements.We have completed two years in the Centre and must tell all about our achievements. This is the party program and entire State will be covered, he said.Asked about the drought conditions prevailing in the state, Mr. Danve said all 123 MLAs and 23 MPs had been assigned drought-affected tehsils to supervise the relief works. They all have done excellent work and have presented their reports to the party. Celebrations do not mean party will deter from the relief activities, he said.Meanwhile, the Opposition said it was unethical to go ahead with the celebrations. First of all they have done nothing in the last two years. They have to keep on blowing their trumpet, said Nawab Malik, chief spokesperson, Nationalist Congress Party.The celebrations will be rolled out at a time when the water levels in all dams, especially those in Marathwada, are at their lowest; the state is witnessing high number of farmer suicides; onion farmers are protesting over falling prices; and several Ministers are facing graft charges."

His party has other plans in UP,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/folk-theorem/modi-talks-of-samvedana-his-party-has-other-plans-in-up/,2016-06-19,"On Thursday, June 16, Uttar Pradesh BJP MLA Sangeet Som said he would organise a march  padayatra  to reassure people that the state would not turn into Kashmir. The implication was obvious.For those who came in late, heres the backdrop to Soms activism. Last week, Hukum Singh, who won a seat in Parliament from Kairana, UP, for the BJP in 2014, created a flap. He claimed 346 Hindu families had left this town because of persecution by Muslims.Media soon showed this claim was bogus: among the people on Singhs list, many had died of natural causes, most had migrated for better opportunities, jobs and schooling elsewhere. Hukum Singh was asked why he had forgotten to list Muslim families who had also left town. A slightly contrite Singh then said his list wasnt about Hindus and Muslims, but the menace of extortion. That claim, too, doesnt stand up to scrutiny: on Wednesday, TOI cited reports by district officials and police records that say only three families left Kairana fearing extortion.At first glance, this looks like a farrago of half-truths and lies, but theres a pattern to it.Kairana is a part of Shamli district, which borders Muzaffarnagar. Between August and September 2013, around six months before Lok Sabha elections, both were rocked by riots. Victims: 52 Muslims, 10 Hindus dead; over 50,000 driven out of home. Hukum Singh was accused of rioting; Sangeet Som was principal accused.The UP BJP believes its Lok Sabha sweep  71 of 80 seats  was due to what we politely call polarization. Once again, elections are due in UP next summer. The flare-up in Kairana bears an uncanny resemblance to events of 2013 in Muzaffarnagar and Shamli. The BJP believes the formula that won it 2014 can be repeated in 2017.See the pattern?But heres the biggest contradiction: this sabre-rattling crashes headlong into another BJP narrative, laid down by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has cultivated the image of a statesman overseas.Modi addressed the BJPs national executive  around 200 top leaders  in Allahabad recently. There, he took the high road of development. He said power was about great responsibility to get things done.And indeed, theres much on the table. For six months, November 2015 to April 2016, industrial production has shrunk every month, bar February this year. Indias economy is largely driven by investment. When investment grows, demand for capital goods soars. When this shrinks, its an ominous portent. For the last six months capital goods has fallen; in April by a horrifying 26%.Exports have shrunk, for the 18th month in a row, as have imports, showing India losing market share overseas and a lack of appetite for imported stuff  machinery to macaroni  at home. Services comprise over half our economy now. This slowed to a six-month low in May, the latest numbers.A growing economy needs to move things around. The real heavy lifting of stuff like fertilizer, coal, cement and iron ore is done on railways. Analysts look at rail freight figures to judge which way the economys core is, well, moving. Compared to a year ago, rail freight growth shrank 13.5%, an all-time low. The biggest falls were in fertilizer, coal and cement.After two years of drought, monsoons  which impact around 600 million livelihoods in our vast hinterland  are again patchy. I bought onion a couple of months ago at Rs 40 per kg. Today, its around Rs 100. I know now why consumer inflation has flared up.Yet, official statisticians put up heroic numbers at which the economy is supposed to be galloping. Taking their cue, Moodys  remember those guys who rated junk US subprime bonds as excellent?  says India will grow 7.5% this year. Well, good luck.But Modi must be sensing something of what the rest of India is feeling. Which probably explains why he felt compelled to tell his colleagues to pull themselves  and the economy  up by their bootstraps. He spoke about seven cardinal values party leaders and workers should follow. Among those, he listed saiyam (restraint), samvedana (sensitivity) and samvad (dialogue).These are laudable sentiments, if only the rest of the party were to listen. Modi talks of development and sensitivity. Sangeet Som, Hukum Singh and others light communal fires in UP.Clearly, there are two parallel narratives in the BJP today. These two stories, it hopes, will converge at the ballot box in UP next summer. But, as Euclid of Alexandria taught us in geometry, parallel lines never meet, except at infinity  which is impossible to grasp."

Fearing that the stock will remain unsold, traders lured buyers by even offering them Re 1/ kg.Even as traders opined that the wholesale price will remain unchanged for the next couple of weeks, retailers expressed inability to drop the price further as they have to pay 8% commission when buying from APMC Sanket Jadhav, a retailer, said, ""Though the purchase price has dipped, transportation charges remain the same. Besides, there's a risk relating to poor quality as farmers released the staple in glut due to lack of storage facility. We get more damaged onions.""""Taking a cue from last year's production crunch and high market price, we cultivated more land and reaped rich harvest. But the expenditure per kg has been Rs 10, while the selling price has dropped to record low. We have incurred heavy losses,"" said Pandurang Gulve, a Solapur farmer.The Mumbai market receives supplies from Lasalgaon, Junnar, Pune and Nashik within the state and from Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh to cater to the demand of 2.5 crore consumers.""With the state offering 5% subsidy to boost export, prices will soon stabilize as excess production has led to demand-supply disparity. Farmers should not flood the market as transp-ort and packing charges cost th-em dear,"" said Rajaram Dhondkar, deputy secretary, APMC."

Even if we give them a, it will be of no use as dhaba owners and mechanics may not have enough change to give them while the drivers are on their way to deliver a consignment,"" said Bakshi.""As over 80% of the commodities are supplied in the country by trucks rather than trains, it may cause shortage of commodities, including vegetables and pulses. It can lead to spiralling prices, causing panic among citizens. To resolve the issue, we will conduct a meeting soon to suggest ways for ensuring movement of trucks. The suggestions will be sent to the PM,"" Bakshi added.Saras Wadhwa, a transporter from Bareilly, said, ""Another problem is that traders need labourers to load and unload consignments. However, if the traders too lack sufficient money in low denominations to pay wages of labourers, the latter refuse to do it, forcing loaded trucks to be stranded.""""Eatables, including rice, sugar and mustard oil are transported from Bareilly to Gujarat and other states, which send onion and refined oil here. If the problem is not sorted soon, it can create scarcity of commodities across the country,"" Wadhwa added.Virendra Gupta, managing committee member of All India Motor Transport Congress said, ""The situation in Agra is critical. It will worsen in the coming days if the government does not allow transport service operators to withdraw at least Rs 35,000 every day, as in addition to fuel and toll, we have to pay for a driver's food, his salary, vehicle maintenance expenses ."""

(Express Photo) At the dhaba in Jullena. (Express Photo)More than a week after demonetisation was announced, Shanu is in a dilemma. Owner of a roadside eatery at Jullena in Jamia Nagar, Shanu has a hard choice to make every time a customer says he will pay later.I have to turn a lot of loyal customers away because they dont have cash. I feel guilty not feeding them, but what do I do? I cant give them food on credit. I also have to get my supplies and pay my workers every day, he said.WATCH VIDEOFor 13 years, Shanu has served affordable lunch and dinner to at least 200 people every day. Anyone can eat unlimited food  daal, sabzi, chapatis, rice and onion and radish salad for Rs 40. Its the most affordable meal for a whole section of society outside their homes, he said.But for the last couple of days, things have been shaky. My business has come down by half. Before November 9, I used to make at least Rs 10,000 per day, now it is hard to make even Rs 4,500, he said.Of the Rs 4,500, Shanu spends almost Rs 500-600 to pay his four-member staff  two cooks, one cleaner and one waiter. A third of the earnings are spent on supplies for the next day. He also has to pay rent and for cooking gas. At the end of the month, I save around Rs 10,000. I dont think Ill be able to save that much this month, said Shanu, a father of three and the familys only earning member. I dont know how Ill pay school fees for my children this month.The dhaba mostly caters to daily wage labourers and rickshaw pullers whose families dont live in the capital.WATCH VIDEO: How Demonetisation Impacts Rural PopulationMoinuddin, a 40-year-old carpenter from Azamgarh, Uttar Pradesh, ate at the dhaba on credit on Wednesday, but was turned away on Thursday. I understand why the dhaba cant give me food on credit anymore. Everyone is short on cash right now. The dhaba also needs money to run the business, he said.I feel bad sending people away, knowing they might sleep hungry. But if I keep giving food on credit, my business will close in three days, Shanu said.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

As 2016 comes to a close, we analysed the status of these five problems, and challenges that will continue in 2017.1. Agriculture recovers, but benefits uncertain after demonetisationOver the fiscal year 2016-17, agriculturewhich employs more than 700 million peoplewill grow by 4%, estimated CRISIL, a research agency.Recovering from twoand some places even threeconsecutive drought years, agriculture, for the first time since 2013, saw a growth of above 3% in the second quarter of 2016-17, over the same period in 2015-16.Record summer crop production of rice, at 93.8 million tonnes, and pulses, at 8.7 million tonnes, is estimated in 2016-17, according to advance estimates by the agriculture ministry.Source: Key Economic Indicators, Office of the Economic AdvisorBut the withdrawal of old Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes in November 2016 has been a setback to the rural economyon which 800 million people, or 65% of Indias population, dependlargely driven by cash.Vehicles entering a rural market yard in Maharashtra dropped, onion prices halved in the biggest onion market in the country, the fishing economy in Goa faced roadblocks, and flower farmers in Madhya Pradesh lost business, as IndiaSpends visit to these regions revealed.Read | Farmers forced to dump their produce as note ban turns bumper crop worthlessSimilar reports from Uttar Pradesh, Odisha and other parts of the country appear to have dampened the bright agricultural prospects of 2016. But there is hope that cash pressures will ease in the long term, and the rural economy will be back to normal, according to a Livemint report.2. Good monsoon; India signs climate change agreement; India has half of the worlds 20 cities with the most toxic airFrom a severe drought in 11 states in June just before the arrival of the monsoon, Indiabarring Punjab, Haryana, Gujarat and Keralareceived normal rains in 2016. Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra received 20% more rain than normal.Overall, rainfall patterns have become more irregular over the last decade. Extreme rainfall events in central India, the core of the monsoon system, are increasing and moderate rainfall is decreasingas a part of complex changes in local and world weatheraccording to a clutch of Indian and global studies, as IndiaSpend reported in January 2016.Read | 116 farmers committed suicide in 2016; 10 states reeling under droughtIn 2016, India ratified the Paris Agreement, under which countries agreed to take steps to limit the rise of the earths temperature to under two degrees Celsius by the year 2100.India also signed a legally binding international agreement, starting 2028, to phase down the production and consumption of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs)gases that can have global warming potential up to 12,000 times more than carbon dioxide (CO2)as IndiaSpend reported in October 2016.Still, India will have to do more to prepare itself for the effects of climate change in the future. Between 2030 and 2050, a study, conducted by the University of Oxford, projected 136,000 climate-related deaths in India, according to an answer given by the environment ministry in the Lok Sabha (lower house of Parliament).Even as CO2 concentration levels in the world breached 400 parts per million, levels that will last our lifetime, thick smog engulfed the nations capital and other northern states, with the concentration of toxic particles reaching up to 45 times above safe levels set by the World Health Organization (WHO).Between 2011 and 2015, in a comparison of megacities with a population above 14 million, Delhis ambient air-pollution levels were worse than Beijing and Shanghai, according to an IndiaSpend analysis of 2016 WHO data. Indian cities make-up half of the worlds 20 most toxic cities, according to data from the WHO.3. India still home to 40 million stunted children, largest number in the worldEven with declining child undernourishment rates, India is home to over 40 million stunted children under five, more than any other country in the world, IndiaSpend reported in January 2016. Stunting refers to low height for age.Read | Children of hunger: Wasted young lives in the heart of IndiaIndia ranks 120 out of 130 countries in prevalence of wasting (15.1%), or low weight for height, according to the 2016 Global Nutrition Report, which ranks countries from lowest to highest prevalence.At current rates of decline in malnutrition, Indiacurrently lagging behind several poorer African countrieswill achieve the current stunting rates of Ghana or Togo by 2030, and that of China by 2055, stated the report.India also does poorly on indicators that could help reduce malnutrition.For instance, there is a link between improved health of the mother and lower stunting prevalence in children under five, IndiaSpend reported in January 2016. States such as Goa and Kerala, with 99% of institutional deliveries, had amongst the lowest levels of stunting in the country. But Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, states that have some of the highest levels of stunting, have just about 65% institutional deliveries.Improved sanitation also impacts the health of children, as seen in the state of Mizoram, which reported a 13% decline in wasting prevalence and 5% decline in underweight children in ten years, when there was a 10% improvement in household access to a toilet, IndiaSpend reported in January 2016. Still, there are 93.1 million households in rural India without access to a toilet.4.
