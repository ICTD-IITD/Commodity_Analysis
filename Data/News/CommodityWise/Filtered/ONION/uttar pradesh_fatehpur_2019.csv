It includes setting up 24 clusters for tomatoes, onions and potatoes (TOP) and initiating an exercise to have an exclusive ""trade map"" for these three high priority produce.The idea behind the move is to enhance value realisation of these perishable horticultural produce by farmers. It will happen through targeted interventions and linking the farmers with both domestic and international markets.""The TOP's trade map, being prepared by the ministry, will have all the details (varieties, price trend, buyers, sellers and processors) which may help in price and demand forecasting. We have been in touch with experts in Scotland, Russia and other countries to compile round the year data on buyers and producers,"" said an official.He said such basic moves would directly help lakhs of farmers in the exclusive TOP clusters in Maharashtra , Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Gujarat , Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and West Bengal ""Tomato, onion and potato clusters will be set up for agricultural processing under the TOP scheme. Focus on price and demand forecasting will enable farmers to choose which crop to sow in order to maximise benefit,"" said Union agriculture minister Radha Mohan Singh.He told TOI on Monday that these efforts and all the other measures, taken by the government in the past over four years, would go a long way in addressing farmers' concerns. ""The success of the government's plan and policies is reflected in record production of food-grains and horticultural produce in 2017-18,"" said Singh.The government is meanwhile, working on various proposals to extend financial help to farmers. Such proposals include waiving off interest for farmers who repay crop loans on time to providing income support for meeting input costs and lowering premium of existing crop insurance schemes.The TOP had got the government's focus when it announced 'Operation Greens' with an outlay of Rs 500 crore in its 2018-19 budget. It's aim is to stabilise supply of tomatoes, onions and potatoes and ensure their availability throughout the country round the year without price volatility.""Exclusive clusters for TOP, on the other hand, will help farmers in realising better prices through its linkages with markets,"" said A K Singh, deputy director general, Horticultural Science and Crop Science Divisions of the ICAR.He said, ""Increase in processing capabilities and setting up of a market intelligence network under the scheme to collect and collate real-time data on demand and supply will help farmers in a big way.""At present, farmers have to dump their produce on the streets or sell it at throwaway prices in case of bumper production as they don't have access to adequate processing facilities.
