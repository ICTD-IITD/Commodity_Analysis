They came in a fleet of lumbering tractors, around 80,000 peasants, cattle, hay to be used as bedding and foodgrains to see them through an unrelenting protest.It was the scene of a spectacular rural takeover of Delhi. Tens of thousands of farmers erected tents, slept, cooked food and ate in the open as well as defecated there, laying siege to the Boat Club lawns, a stones throw from Parliament. They vowed to not budge until their demands for higher sugarcane prices and a waiver of electricity charges were met.Tikaits Bhartiya Kisan Union successfully extracted key concessions from the then Rajiv Gandhi-led government.Farm protests have seldom been so strong, but in Maharashtra in March, 35,000 farmers walked 180 km on a long march to reach Mumbai from the states Nashik district seeking loan waivers  a turnout not seen since the days of Tikaits agitation.Farm loan waivers have now become the new rallying point for farmers movement because there are just losses, losses everywhere, says Amra Ram, a leader of the All-India Kisan Sabha, the organisation that led the long march.Under the NDA government, farmers havent fared too well due to a combination of factors, including two successive droughts and a slump in global food prices. This has led farmers groups and lobbies to re-energise themselves around two key demands  loan waivers and profitable prices.Dont call it a protest. Ours is a political movement of farmers, says Kedar Sirohi, the Indore-based social-media savvy leader of the Aam Kisan Union (General Farmers Union).Before Tikait, there was another tall peasant leader in Chaudhary Charan Singh, a former chief minister of Uttar Pradesh (UP). His biographer Paul Brass, a professor at the University of Washington, writes in An Indian Political Life that Charan Singh was devoted throughout his political career to the interests of the peasantry.According to Brass, Singh, a known detractor of Nehru, sowed the seeds of a strong farmers lobby in north India by first dissenting against the Congress 1959 Nagpur Resolution on Agriculture, which advocated collectivisation and a cooperative model for the farm sector.The Nagpur Resolution was the most significant agrarian programme formulated by the Congress since the abolition of zamindari in several States, wrote Walter Hauser in a January 1959 piece in The Economic and Political Weekly, analysing Singhs role. Singh contended that cooperatives will lead to bigness and that this, with mechanized agriculture, would result in a decrease in per capita production rather than an increase, Hauser writes.Building on his peasant support base, Charan Singh went on to become prime minister.Read: Agriculture not always a dead end: Here are young, successful farmers who made the cutThe green revolution of 1960s saw farmers prosper and emerge as a class of bullock capitalists, a term coined by American political scientists Lloyd I. Rudolph and Susan Rudolph to describe the empowered Indian agrarian class. Bullock capitalists were well-to-do enough to raise their voice politically, but werent fully capitalist farmers, the Rudolphs logic went.This was followed by the rise of powerful farmer organisations. These included Rajya Ryot Sangha in Karnataka, the Bharatiya Kisan Union in UP and Punjab as well as the Tamil Nadu Agriculturists Association in Tamil Nadu and the Shetkari Sanghatana in Maharashtra.A new era of social-media-enabled farm movement has now taken over.As it heads into a crucial general election due next year, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has promised a slew of measures to quell farmer protests, including prices that are at least 50% over production costs.The Congress has promised a fresh loan waiver if voted to power like the one it announced in 2008 (and which played a part in its return to power in 2009).The BJP-ruled states of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, UP and Congress-ruled Punjab have already announced loan waivers, forced by protests.Maharashtra (also ruled by the BJP) did so too.Loan waivers are a pressing demand because the single biggest cause of agrarian distress is indebtedness. Farmers take loans to buy inputs such as seeds and irrigation machinery. Many of these farmers get into debt traps when crops fail or prices fall.The Situation Assessment Surveys of the National Sample Survey Organisation (NSSO, 2013) has reconfirmed the situation analysed in 2003 by the NSSOs 59th round of indebtedness of farm households. It showed that 52% of farm households in India are in debt.Loan waivers could have a bearing on the combined fiscal deficit of states. According to India Ratings and Research, farm debt waivers announced by five states together are likely to widen the combined fiscal deficit of states by ?107700 crore. Bankers have argued against farm loan waivers because they are no panacea and could affect credit growth.According to Reserve Bank of India data, bad loans in agriculture have increased by ?11,400-crore in 2017 to over ?60,000 crore, a jump of 23%, from 2016.From 2012-13, the year before the BJP government took office, till 2016-17, bad loans in the agriculture sector have increased 142.74%. The biggest defaults were during in 2016-17, suggesting a worsening of agrarian distress.RBI data further shows that compared to 20.83% defaults by corporate borrowers, defaults by farmers stood at only 6% of their total outstanding.This shows that farmers dont willfully default. Why dont they catch the bigger thieves? asks Ram of the All India Kisan Sabha.Agricultural economist AV Manjunatha of the Bangalore-based Institute of Social and Economic Change, who carried out an all-India study on farmer suicides, says farmers in real distress do need some sort of system to report distress. They also need facilities to negotiate loan restructuring. These could be adopted as policy solutions, he said.A new phase of farmers mobilisation has put both state and central governments on a tight leash. Reforms in markets and other structural measures for a better farming future dont appeal as much as loan waivers.They put my land on notice for auction. Its the only thing I have. Only a loan waiver can save me, says Tulchha Ram, an onion grower from Rajasthan Sikars district."

As India wades into the election battlefield next year, it will be governance that decides the mandate and not mudslinging. Indian voters have usually voted out non-performing leaders to bring in ones who promised better governance or Achche Din. Last week, almost the entire Opposition descended on Bengaluru to forge the blueprint of an alliance which will try to dislodge Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2019.They had little in common except a venomous dislike for him. The optics of Mamata Banerjee and Mayawati, Sitaram Yechury and Siddaramaiah, Sonia Gandhi and Sharad Pawar, Rahul Gandhi and Akhilesh Yadav and others preening on a festive stage erected as a launching pad for HD Kumaraswamys ascension to the chief ministership of Karnataka was a political anagram spelling a warning to Modi. Beware! Our phalanx is ready to demolish your juggernaut.Not one of them put forth an alternative agenda for governance, and refrained from attacking each other, as they had done before arriving in Bengaluru and did soon after landing back home. But the message from Bengaluru was loud and clear: Battle 2019 would be fought between the Mighty Dozen and Crafty Modi. Once again, history is repeating itself.In 1977, it was Indira vs the Rest. In 1989, it was Rajiv vs United Enemies. The choices were between one opportunistic coalition and an unprincipled alliance. In 2018, Modi finds himself in the unenviable position of facing the entire regiment of Opposition leaders who cannot individually defeat him in nearly any major state. Rajiv Gandhis Congress was trounced by his own former minister VP Singh, who launched the Janata Dal from Bengaluru in 1988, supported by the BJP and the Communists. For Modi, 2019 is a greater challenge than 2014, when he was pitted against a defamed government and tainted leadership. Since then he has almost fulfilled his promise of achieving a Congress-mukt Bharat. What next?Though the Congress is just a ghost now, the BJP and its partners rule 22 states while regional satraps control the remaining states where the BJP is weak; some of them were once part of the NDA. The challenge for the Congress and other non-BJP Opposition parties is to snatch Lok Sabha seats away from the saffron sultan. Analysis of data shows that the electorate rejects over 65 per cent of sitting lawmakers in every state in every poll.This means the probability of sitting BJP MPs losing is higher than that of Opposition legislators, who together hold only 225 seats in the current Parliament. Hence, the Opposition has joined hands to take advantage of the anti-incumbency factor in Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Haryana and other states where the BJP has been in power for one or more than two terms. Various opinion polls also indicate its vote share may shrink.While Modi remains the voters top choice, his personal popularity has shown a significant fall. However, it is not impossible for him to win a second mandate by making a course correction in the next nine months. Having created an admirable climate of economic stability and GDP growth, the prime minister will need to convince the voters that he has provided a government which works by adopting the Mantra of Reform, Perform and Transform. For that he must:*Improve perception. Modis promise of delivering Maximum Governance with Minimum Government seduced peoples high expectations. He correctly thought of right-sizing or downsizing the government. But four years later, its mass has bloated further. There are more secretaries and higher level officials now than in 2014. Bureaucracy is like a wildfire that has spread in favourable winds across the corridors of power. Taking advantage of the PMs trust in honest officers, babus have created innumerable tribunals, commissions and expert groups to accommodate retired colleagues.*Tame inflation: Modi had promised to reduce prices and provide more employment. Though the job market has shown recovery, it is less than expected. The wholesale price index is either stagnant or stuck, though within tolerable limits. Yet the perception created by the record spurt in petroleum product prices should be a major concern.The BJP made gas prices one of its major election issues in 2014. In 2018, consumers are paying more to fill fuel tanks, though the average cost of imported crude is down 40 per cent. Public perception that the government is squeezing the middle class is gaining ground. Modi should perhaps note that the BJP lost many elections in the late 1990s due to a rise in onion prices. Any hike in petroleum prices devastates the domestic budgets of the middle and lower classes. It has a spiralling effect on the cost of other goods and services. Providing affordable housing to the middle class is still a dream. Healthcare costs are exorbitant and the quality has plummeted in most of India.*Increase his Indian footprint. Modi has left his imprint on international diplomacy through inimitable Modihuplomacy. During the past four years he has travelled to a record number of countries and exhibited his popularity and innovative skills to numerous global leaders. But now he needs to reconnect himself with the electorate more. The BJP has wrested all the states from the Congress thanks to his magnetism. Modi is bigger than the BJP; the voters plump for him and not for his party. His domestic travel should be aimed at connecting with his core constituency and not just official events.Former deputy prime minister LK Advanis political relevance may have diminished in New India, but Modi should take his cue from a statement he made after the 2004 Lok Sabha elections, that the BJP lost because it had ignored its core constituencythe middle class and the committed Sangh Parivaris.*Forget Rahul and Sonia Gandhi. The prime minister is committing the cardinal mistake of attacking the Gandhi Parivar more frequently than politically required.Both mother and son had almost hit the political bottom after the Congress won just 44 seats in 2014 and lost in all the states it ruled between 2014 and 2018. Gandhi bashing paid dividends in 2014 since they remote-controlled the Manmohan Singh government and were punished by the electorate. Double jeopardy does not work. Indira Gandhi was defeated in 1977 for imposing the Emergency, but staged a triumphant return in 1980. The Atal Bihari Vajpayee-led NDA lost in 2004 despite an admirable performance.During the run-up to the 2019 elections, Modis oratorical skills and charisma would face the real test. He will have to convince India that he is not a leader who makes promises which are forgotten soon after the election, and that he has actually delivered more than what was promised in 2014."

Many are also selling them within the villages, said Balbir Singh Rajewal, president of the Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU). Today is only the first day, so urban markets are still able to sell what was supplied earlier. Wait and see; by day after tomorrow, prices will shoot up in cities.Ramandeep Sangh Mann, a farmer leader associated with the KEM  an umbrella body of 62 farmer groups  said, According to local reports, 40% of milk supply in Punjab is affected.Extending support to the farmers campaign, Punjab Minister Navjot Singh Sidhu visited Patto village in Fatehgarh Sahib and purchased milk and vegetables directly from a farmer.In Haryana, arrival of farm produce at urban centres was down by 70 to 80%, BKU leader Rakesh Bains told The Hindu .Mr. Bains said implementing the Swaminathan Commissions recommendation on Minimum Support Price (MSP) for crops, complete farm loan waiver and fixation of minimum income for farmers are the key demands that the government should address immediately.We also want the government to fix MSP for milk and vegetables, he added.Supplies hit in RajasthanAlthough the agitation did not affect normal life in Rajasthan, supply of milk, vegetables and other farm produce was hit in Sriganganagar, Hanumangarh and Jhunjhunu districts.We will continue this for the next 10 days and the protest will intensify, said Santveer Singh, a member of the core committee of RKMM in Rajasthan. He said protests were held in Bikaner, Sikar and Nagaur.As the strike began, police in Mandsaur in Madhya Pradesh have kept a close vigil as the anniversary of the June 6 farmers agitation approaches. Six farmers were killed in police firing during protests last year.In adjacent Neemuch, again there has been not shortage of vegetables and milk although the markets were shut there. Farmers also stayed away from the grain market in Neemuch.Nashik shuts downPolice detained three protesters in Saikheda in Nashik, the nerve centre of the farmers agitations earlier this year. At Khamkheda village in Deola tehsil, tomato farmers threw their produce on the roads.The strike had a strong impact on business at Nashiks main Lasalgaon Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC)  the countrys largest onion market, with sources stating that the price of onions was likely to rise sharply.In Khed Shivapur, farmers condemned the apathy of the Devendra Fadnavis-led BJP government by spilling thousands of litres of milk along the Pune-Bengaluru highway.However, business was largely unaffected in most of the major wholesale markets in Mumbai and Pune.(With inputs from Vikas Vasudeva, Shoumojit Banerjee and PTI)"

5ce76762e8e3fc56af419304,BUAT agriculture scientists introduce high-yielding variety of onion,http://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2018/oct/30/buat-agriculture-scientists-introduce-high-yielding-variety-of-onion-1891683.html,2018-10-30,"Namita Bajpai ByExpress News ServiceLUCKNOW: There is a new ray of hope for the vegetable farmers of water deficient Bundelkhand region of Uttar Pradesh as an agriculture scientist of Banda University of Agriculture and Technology (BUAT) has introduced a rapidly growing and high-yielding variety of onion.This could also be counted as a step towards doubling the income of the farmers till 2022. The new variety is virtuous enough to help the farmers improve earnings as it has smaller gestation and a longer preservation period than any other regular variety of onion.It may be recalled that the agriculture scientists of BUAT had developed a dark red variety of onion which had proved to be a boon for onion growers of Bundelkhand region. Associate Professor, BUAT, Dr RK Singh calls this new variety Line-883. ""The crop of this variety gets ready in 83 days instead of 110-1120 days taken by regular onion varieties,"" said Dr Singh.He added that the yield is almost 20 per cent higher than the regular onion crop with 300-350 quintal per hectare as against 250-280 for normal varieties. ""We have tried to address the preservation issues as well. Usually, onion stays just for a month and gets sprouted at normal temperature but Line-833 can be preserved for over two and a half months without sprouting both at normal temperature and cold storage.Dr Singh has been conducting his experiments with the seeds of Line-833 in Bundelkhand region for the last two years.Before this, he had actually started his research on the new variety while being in Nasik National Horticulture Research and Development Foundation (NHRDF) a decade ago. Elaborating on its positives, Dr Singh explained that it took lesser time to grow as compared to the regular varieties. ""This is ready within 80-85 days against traditional 100-110 days of onion crop. Moreover, its level of endurance and resistance to disease is much higher than other onion varieties,"" he said.On his decision to introduce this variety to Bundelkhand onion growers, Dr Singh said was best-suited option for them as Bundelkhand was water deficient and the new variety grew to require a lesser amount of water while giving best results in Kharif season.However, he added that its seeds were used by over 400 farmers of different regions and states, including Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Bihar, Jharkhand Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan and Karnataka, on trial basis with exemplary results. Moreover, 15 farmers of Banda district have used the seed of Line 833 and got very good output, said BUAT authorities endorsing the variety. Explaining the technical aspect involved,Dr Singh claimed that in Bundelkhand region the sulphur content in the soil was higher than normal. ""Sulphur increases the activity of soil. For Line-833 sulphur rich soil is best suited so it will give outstanding results and can be a boon for Bundelkhand framers,"" said Dr Singh."
5ce5c99ae8e3fc56af40ef46,Well-being of society at root of rigorous rituals,https://www.telegraphindia.com/states/bihar/well-being-of-society-at-root-of-rigorous-rituals/cid/1674931,2018-12-11,"Modern day Chhath has emerged as the most revered and popular community festival of Bihar, in which all strata of society participate with equal zeal and sincerity though with many new manifestations and amendments. But the worship of the Sun God, which constitutes the essence of the festival, has been prevalent in the Magadh region and in other parts of Bihar for millennia.Though the role of fire got minimised in Aryavarta (present day Uttar Pradesh) after the Later Vedic Phase (1000-600 BC), its use increased further east, in the Bihar region, from 600 BC onwards as new settlements emerged in Magadh.The pre-historic settlements of the hilly and the jungle terrain of South Bihar regions and Northern Jharkhand were the source of the sustenance for nature worshippers, including the followers of the sun/fire cult. In recent times, more than 42 rock shelters/cave settlements belonging to the pre-historic as well as early historic period have been deciphered in the districts of Nawada, Jamui, Giridih and Jamui.The Taradih excavations of Bodhgaya have unearthed artefacts since the Neolithic period. Several fire pits have been found which also justify the worship of fire/sun god as continuity since pre-historic times.The Aryanisation of the Magadh region, since 600 BC, superimposed the Rig Vedic (1500-1000 BC) concept over the local tradition of the sun/fire cult in the area.The first manifestation of the Sun God in the Mahabodhi pillars of Bodhgaya in the art form during the Saka-Kushan period is thus natural. As such, we also find Sun God appearing on Kushan coins during AD 200-300.The rapid march of the Magadh Empire during 600 BC and the subsequent rapid urbanisation of the Magadh region further regenerated and popularised the local prehistoric sun/fire cult among the urban gentry and the ruling elite of Magadh region.LINK BETWEEN WORSHIP OF SUN GOD AND MOTHER GODDESSWorship of the Mother Goddess is associated with the fertility cult, which had its origins in primitive agricultural societies of the world. Discovery of idols of Mother Goddess in various matured forms at the sites of the Indus Valley Civilisation prove beyond doubt that the worship of Mother Goddess has been popular in India from pre-historic times.The Mahabodhi Pillars of the Saka-Kushan times have revealed two distinct images carved out of stone: (i) The Sun God and (ii) The Primordial Mother Goddess.While the image of the Sun God was conceived during the Rig Vedic phase, the Primordial Mother Goddess was still in the pristine form, as the River Goddess and was conceived from the folk traditions of Aryavarta.With the evolution and the advancement of the agrarian economy in Aryavarta, the worship of Mother Goddess emerged as the most popular form of worship in the folk tradition.The River Goddess slowly evolved in the mindset of the village communities of Aryavarta during the Late Vedic Phase (1000-600 BC). The concept of the River Goddess of Aryavarta travelled far and wide during 600 BC to AD 300 from Northwest India to Eastern India in the Indo-Gangetic belt and was popular among the people of the time in general and the village communities in particular. The Mahabodhi Pillar depicts the River Goddess as sitting on a ghata (vase or kalash) and black-clouds representing two elephants are pouring water on her head by their trunks, signifying heavy downpour during rainy season. Later, the River Goddess has been identified as the Gaja Lakshmi form of Goddess Lakshmi in the Brahmanical pantheon but it also survived in its pristine form, in the folk tradition of Magadh (in particular) and Bihar (in general) in the form of Chhath Puja.Interestingly, the most significant utensils used on the occasion of Chhath Puja are a holy pot (kalash) and the chaturmukh dwip. The kalash signifies the Mother Earth or Mother Goddess, which proves beyond doubt the inter linkage between the Sun God (male divinity) and the Mother Goddess (female divinity).The Chhath Puja is directly rooted to the well being of the agricultural society as the worship of the Sun God is directly related to the harvesting season of two major crops of Bihar: kharif and rabi. The harvesting time of kharif crops is the month of Kartik (October-November); and that of rabi is Chaitra (March-April).The present form of Chhath Puja was conceived during the medieval period. The various aspects of Chhath Puja got crystallised with the stabilisation of the medieval period as we can see the devotees urge the Sun God to provide them good health, male progeny and wealth (good harvest and monetary gain), a general urge for all classes of the agrarian feudal society of the central Gangetic plain of Bihar.THE SIGNIFICANCE OF COCONUT, PAAN AND BANANASSeasonal fruits and vegetables (of the Bihar eco-system) are needed for Chhath Puja, but the only exception is coconut which is known as Kanchan Phal. It signifies that coconut is resistant to rotting for months due to its sclerenchymatous outer cover and can be safely transported from one part of the country to another. In the ancient and the medieval period coconut (but not the green coconut) was very much part of Bihars dietary supplement.Significantly, betel leaf (paan) and bananas had been brought from the Southeast Asian eco-system in the ancient period, probably by Brahmin and Buddhist monks, but both had been internalised in the cultural traditions of India. Both paan and bananas predate the medieval Chhath Puja traditions and are essential part of the rituals.Of late, pineapples and oranges have also become a part of the Chhath Puja offerings.Orange is unknown in the wild state, it is assumed to have originated in southern China, northeastern India, and perhaps southeastern Asia from ancient times but now, it is available in the market due to the availability of rapid communication. Similarly, pineapples, a fruit of the eco-system of northeastern states, are now readily available in Bihar during the Dala Chhath of Kartik.The use of some of todays common fruits, vegetables and pulses is not seen in use by devotees due to their origin from other eco-systems like potatoes (Latin America), onion (Central Asia), apples (Central Asia), lentil (Central Asia), cauliflower (Syria and Europe), cabbage (Mediterranean countries) among others. Instead, the local edibles are in use e.g. sweet potato, singhara, pomelo, Bengal gram (chana dal) and turmeric saplings.Jaggery (gur) from sugarcane is the traditional sweetener of Indian cultural tradition and is an essential part of Chhath Puja festivities.But now some devotees also use sugar crystals, popularised by the British who opened sugar mills in north Bihar and elsewhere during the early decades of the 20th century.The author is a research writer and freelance journalist.
