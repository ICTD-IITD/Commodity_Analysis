Besides, horticulture production also showed continuous increase unlike foodgrain output which reported a decline in 2014-15 as compared to 2013-14.The figures are part of the horticultural statistics, released by the agriculture ministry on Thursday. The report - Horticultural Statistics at a Glance 2015 - shows that while Maharashtra tops the list of states in terms of leading fruit-producing states, West Bengal is at top in terms of vegetable production in 2013-14.Similarly, Tamil Nadu is the top flower producing state while Gujarat is the leading spices producing state. Tamil Nadu is also at the top in the list of plantation-producing states in the same year.Horticultural crops comprise of fruits, vegetables, plantation crops, flowers, spices and aromatics, while the foodgrains basket contains wheat, rice, coarse cereals, oil seeds and pulses.Noting the consumption pattern, the publication said that the nutritional intake from fruits and vegetables is higher among urban population than that of rural population.Releasing the first issue of such detailed compilation, comprising district-wise statistics of horticultural output in the country, agriculture minister Radha Mohan Singh said, ""The data would help policy planners, farmers and other stakeholders"".The publication notes that India has witnessed voluminous increase in horticulture production over the last few years. ""Significant progress has been made in area expansion resulting in higher production"", it says.Data show that fruits and vegetables account for nearly 90% of the total horticulture production in India which is, at present, the second largest producer of fruits and vegetables in the world. The country is, in fact, the leader in several horticultural crops including mango, banana, papaya, cashew nut, areca nut, potato and lady's finger.On the export front, the report notes that grapes occupy the premier position with 107.3 thousand tonnes worth Rs 1,08,649 lakh of exports, followed by banana and mango. Even exports of fresh vegetables have been on the rise.The publication presents a comprehensive picture of the Indian horticulture sector by using statistical data across states, districts and time periods, covering diverse aspects such as area, production, productivity, growth trends, percentage share and value of output for major horticultural crops.Other aspects covered are outlays and expenditure under horticultural activities, monthly series of prices and arrivals over past year in respect of onion, potato and tomato; inputs for horticultural crops; exports and imports; infrastructure availability and India's position in world scenario of horticulture production."

There is one about a few farmers in a nearby village, who sold their land to a corporate and bought the chaar bangle waali car (referring to the Audi logo). Another one concerns a farmer near the Jamnagar district, who sold his land, bought a bike, and even hired a driver to take him around town.If you were willing to listen, farmers in Dholera will tell you more: of those who sold their land for a good price, refurbished their houses and bought shiny new Altos and Scorpios.So why wouldnt they do so too? Because if you lost your land, you would only end up as someones slave. Those who sold their land to the companies are now doing majoori (manual labour) on other peoples farms, or working in factories. The farmer who was once a malik (owner), is now taking a dabba (lunch box) and going to work every day, says Roop Sang Bhai of Sarasla village in Dholera.Labourers work on Togubha Dilubha Chudasma's land holding where they earn Rs 200 per day. (Saumya Khandelwal/ HT Photo)Money cannot be eaten, residents of Sarasla insist. The cars are standing stationary, the bike chauffeurs have turned unaffordable, and the promised jobs either didnt come, or didnt pay well, they lament. Villages nearby are full of those who have been ruined after selling their land to industries. The khet (fields) has always given us enough to eat. So why should we give it away? asks Roop Sang, echoing the sentiment of the group in the Sarasla cotton field.In the 22 villages of Dholera, the site for the Dholera Special Investment Region (DSIR), its a question that farmers want to pose to the authority in charge of acquiring land for this project.Like the rest of the country, in the town of Dholera too, land has become the flash point of conflict between its owners and the government. But what makes Dholera different  and a test case for alternative models of acquiring land for industry  is the state governments land pooling policy, as opposed to the contentious one on acquisition.Announced in 2007, the ambitious DSIR project was pitched as a global manufacturing and trading hub, with a smart city and an international airport to boot. It is the first industrial node  there are 24 planned along the Delhi Mumbai Industrial Corridor  that was taken up for development. Touted to be PM Narendra Modis pet project (the CM of Gujarat when it was announced) the DSIR didnt see much activity until last year, when the project received a sanction of Rs 2,784 crore from the central government.Watch | Farmers explain the problem in DholeraThe funds, or the lack thereof, however, seem to be not the only hurdle that the project is up against. In December 2015, the state High Court ordered a status quo on land acquisition in the DSIR, in response to a petition by a group of farmers under the aegis of the NGO Gujarat Khedut Samaj (GKS) and a local organization, Bhal Bachao Samiti, who are contesting the governments land pooling policy on grounds that it limits the powers of the Panchayat.Its a conflict that DSIR Development Authority (DSIRDA) planners were only hoping to avoid. With the Land Acquisition and Rehabilitation and Resettlement (LARR) Act, 2013, turning into the proverbial political hot potato and the messy processes of acquisition leading to a face-off between the owners and the government (or, the corporate) in several projects across the country, the alternative of pooling held much promise, policy experts and planners argued.A Smart City hoarding in Dholera. (Saumya Khandelwal/ HT Photo)Land pooling -- at least on paper -- offers the new module of partnership between the owner and the developer. Here, the owner does not lose his property, as opposed to land acquisition, where the sale of land implies loss of all rights for the original owner.Typically, after acquisition, a change in land use (from agricultural to commercial) leads to a rise in the price of the land, often creating enough ground for discontent and resentment among the original owners. For instance, in places such as Gurgaon and Faridabad, where the state government acquired land and transferred it to private developers, theres widespread discontent among land owners who lament that while the developers made huge gains off the land, the farmers were left with a compensation that was incommensurate with the market price of the property anyway.In pooling, however, the premise is that the owners are willing partners who give up their land, and accrue the benefits of development. After the industries come in, roads, schools and hospitals are built up, the owner gets a portion of their land, the price of which has gone up now. The owner can either sell it, or build something of his own on it. Gujarat has always had a progressive policy of acquisition, where farmers get a share in the benefits of industrial development, says noted economist Yoginder K Alagh.So what went wrong in Dholera? The answer lies in the Gujarat SIR Act, 2009, under which the state government can take 50% of the farmers land without compensation, and return the other half at a different site after readjustment. The logic here is that after development of the site, the price of the farmers land would increase, and he would be a direct beneficiary of it. We are only taking barren land anyway, and also planning to give compensation for the 50% land that we are deducting, a senior official from the DSIRDA says.Bhagwanbhai has sold his land holdings and distributed the proceeds from the sale among his children. (Saumya Khandelwal/ HT Photo)But farmers in Dholera are far from convinced. The best quality of wheat in the country, the Bhaliya, grows here; if it rains moderately, theres good cotton too. We also grow gram and cumin here. How can they say its barren? says Bhagwanbhai, 65, a resident of Sarasla village.The draft Environmental Impact Assessment report for the DSIR maintains the authoritys position on the fertility of the land in the region -- about 40% of land in Dholera is classified asagricultural fallow land, and only 7% is crop land, the report states.However, activists such as Sagar Rabari of GKS refute this claim: More than 60% of land in Dholera is fertile. Agricultural yield in the region amounts to 600-700 kg wheat per acre, and 400-500 per acre in cotton. Here, agriculture is still a profitable enterprise, he insists.Sagar Rabari of Khedut Samaj  Gujarat talks about farmer issues in Ahmedabad. (Saumya Khandelwal/ HT Photo)Farmers in the region second his opinion, and add that if the state government resolved the water scarcity issue, they could plan multiple crops on the same land and enhance their yield by two-fold. The fact that there has been a delay in making that a possibility the delay in the completion of the canal network that will deliver the waters of the Narmada to their fields  is also being perceived by the farmers as a ploy by the government to ensure that they would not hold on to their land.Resistance to the project is further complicated by the mess of land records in the region, an issue that plagues several regions in the country. Take the case of Faljibhai Nagjibhai Bauliya , 38, of Haibatpur village, who claims to have 96 acres of land, of which not even one half is finds mention in the computerised land records of the area.On a crisp cotton sheet spread on a wooden cot in his home in the village of Haibatpur, Faljibhai spreads out a stack of sepia-toned documents to substantiate his claim: land that his father received from the state in 1968 is still not in the computerised land records of the village.The talathi (village revenue secretary) wouldnt do it until we paid up, says Faljibhai.The mess of records can be traced to land reforms in the state, where landless families such as those of Faljibhais father received land under several schemes such as the Land Ceiling Act, the state tenancy law and the central governments Santhani scheme (where government wastelands were redistributed to the landless), explains GKS Sagar.However, he explains that the names of the new owners never made it to the records because of illiteracy, fragmentation of landholdings through the years and corrupt officials.Now, with the DSIRDA planning to take their land for the project, farmers such as Faljibhai are only left wondering how the planners would allot them their rightful share of land after deduction.Armed with information on the SIR Act by NGOs such as GKS, those such as Faljibhai argue that the policy doesnt seem to be working in their favour.For instance, Dholeras farmers argue that shifting to a new plot would imply fresh investments be made on farm infrastructure such as tubewells, and brings with it the question of viability of agriculture in a new place. Some villagers from nearby areas have told us that the new plots for us are being craved out of the saline area near the sea. We are not even educated enough to do much else; if agriculture fails, what are we going to do? asks Faljibhai.The fear of being given fallow and saline plots is predominant among the farmers of Dholera, who trace it to the emergence of real estate brokers in the area. These brokers deal in the sale and purchase of land, often a murky process involving the rich and powerful in the region, and beyond.Faljibhai shows documents of his land which are not acknowledged in the computer records of the authorities. (Saumya Khandelwal/ HT Photo)It is in this trade and its underlying skewed power equations that farmers such as Faljibhai feel they might lose out. Playing in real estate is not for farmers like us; its for the dalaals (middlemen), he says.Land pooling as a scheme rests on the logic that owners can become entrepreneurs in their own right, but residents of Dholera point to the clause in the SIR Act stating that aside of the development charge that they would have to pay on the new plot, they would need permission from the authority to build something. The new plots that would be given to the farmers would be in specific zones such as IT, entertainment, recreation sports, and if the farmer wanted to build a structure that didnt fall in the zone of his new plot, he would need permission from the development authority.The official from the DSIRDA told HT that in light of the resistance to the project, the authority is willing to negotiate with the farmers and even pay compensation in the lieu of the land deducted to address their concerns: This project will increase job opportunities for the locals, and ensure that they benefit from the development of the region.But in the cotton fields of Sarasla, farmers say that for them, development implied better irrigation facilities for a robust yield.  We dont want the industries at the cost of our livelihood. We will resist this acquisition of our land. Jaan de denge par zameen nahi (we will give up our lives, but not the land), says Roop Sang, as the group standing in his cotton field nods in agreement.But Bhagwanbhai, who is landless now and depends on the trade in cattle feed procured from the fields, stops to correct them: Jaan bhi mat do, aur zameen bhi mat do (Dont give your lives, or your land), he tells them."

Data released by the state's agriculture department shows a 39% drop in land cultivated for rabi crop this season in Saurashtra.Overall, rabi sowing is down by 1.65 lakh hectares or 14% of the 33.68 lakh hectares cultivated in 2015. North Gujarat, which relies on Narmada canals, has witnessed only a slight increase in rabi sowing - from 10.58 lakh hectares to 10.82 lakh hectares.Region-wise, sowing was poorest in Saurashtra, at only 60.68% of fields cultivated for rabi crops as compared to 2015. In Saurashtra, instead of 9.04 lakh hectares usually tilled during rabi season, this year, only 5.50 lakh hectares have been used for rabi crop cultivation. The reason, said officials, is the shortage of water in dams. Officials of the agriculture department said that usually water in the check dams lasts till early December. But this year, due to erratic rains, farmers were forced to withdraw water during August and September leaving check dams empty by mid-October.Crop choice, observed officials, have also changed and there was a 100% increase in sowing of fennel seeds, while both potato and onion - essential for the kitchen - witnessed increase in sowing. This year, 11.24 lakh hectares of land have been used for potato crops, against the 8.16 lakh hectares used on an average."

The state has received only 650 mm rainfall this season, which is 81.57% of the 797 mm of average seasonal rainfall.Water in the 202 dams of the state was only 41% against the total storage capacity of 15763.76 MCM. The water in the 137 dams in Saurashtra was only 20% of 2526.59 MCM.Besides the drop in cultivation of arable land, market forces have also ushered in major changes in crop choices in the state.Cultivation of wheat in areas without irrigation has dropped by 69%.The usual area tilled for wheat every year in areas with little or no irrigation is 63,900 hectares. Sowing of cumin seed also fell by 16%, while garlic sowing fell by 59% of normal sowing. Garlic sowing, however, has been on the decline for some time, said sources in the agriculture department.On the other hand, sowing of onion and potato was up by 18% and 37.7%, respectively .While onion was sowed in 5.32 lakh hectares against the average sowing of 4.49 lakh hectare, the sowing of potato was in 11.24 lakh hectares against the average sowing of 8.16 lakh hectares.The biggest shift in crop choice was in the case of fennel whose cultivation went up by 201%. The usual sowing area of fennel in Gujarat was 2.26 lakh hectares, which has gone up to 4.55 lakh hectares this year.The sowing in Saurashtra was in 5.49 lakh hectares against the average sowing of 9.04 lakh hectares, 60.89% of normal sowing.For the past few years, sowing in Saurashtra was almost at 100%, according to the sources, but this year, due to inadequate rainfall, and the water scarcity in dams, the sowing dropped.North Gujarat fared only a little better with 86.84 % of usually cultivated land put to plough. The normal sowing area in north Gujarat is 10.86 lakh hectares.Garlic may become scarcePeople may have to be ready to face a crisis in garlic supply as the sowing of garlic which is usually was over an area of 1.92 lakh hectares was done in an area of 80,000 hectares. Sources said that for the last few year garlic farming in the state has been on the wane."

Out all day, when she returned home to change in to fresh clothes, she was aghast to see her body turn blue!No. She did not suffer any heat stroke. Nor did she have any allergies to hot or humid climes back home. As a matter of fact, it was the colour of her peacock blue bandhani top that had run all over her and despite taking what she calls a hot soapy shower, she could not get rid of her blues completely.Next, she had a nasty, red rash. She first thought that it must have been due to prickly heat but it was not. A doctor friend told her that the dye of her top had something in it and had affected her skin. He told her that these dyes could be poisonous. So much so that these dyes also affect the dyers in the villages where it is made, with many artisans having their hands and fingers damaged. This shocked Shailini, who claims that now she was turning red and blue. Not because of dye but with anger!The incident made Shailini, the niece of Indumati Chamanlal, a freedom fighter and Gujarats first textile minister, think. Ironically, it was Chamanlal who had set up Khadi Mandir, Indias first khadi store, in Ahmedabad in the 1950s, where Shailini had spent most of her formative years working in the outlet. She thought about the clothes we buy and wear, their manufacturing process, the people involved and what their characteristics are.A trained career architect, travelling between India and England, Shailini was closely involved with various aspects of green, energy efficient and sustainable built environment projects. Her passion was about conservation and heritage support of buildings, people and places. Having committed equal time for paid and community-based voluntary work all through her career, she had been involved with research and work on initiating action programs for village level groups, artisans and international communities.My experience of turning blue and red had remained with me. When I returned from England to Ahmedabad a decade ago, my first project was to build a house for my family and myself. That experience of finding our roots again and experimenting at grounding took me closer to my personal heritage. It took me beyond architecture and I became very passionate about handcrafted fabrics, Shailini says.The other strength Shailini had was that having lived in England and in India, she had been exposed to both sides of international textiles change - from the producer side and from the buyer/consumer side. Influenced profoundly by her aunt Indumatiben Chamanlal and close family association with Mahatma Gandhi and Indias Freedom Struggle, Shailini was influenced by the ethical, moral and social values the freedom movement had generated.Polluting industryWhen she began her tryst with the textile industry, she knew that this industry is the second biggest employer in the world but had become one of the most polluting and exploitative industries. Many times the buying houses, distributors and mills show very high profit margins for their shareholders but the people lower down the supply chain are overlooked. The workers are exploited by very low wages and they work in questionable health and safety conditions. The farmers become victims of buying agents and get paid very little. Many times greed and apathy play a larger role, she says.So in 2007, she began her journey by setting up MORALFIBRE - the fabric made using almost no electricity and no harmful chemicals. One that is almost Carbon Neutral and allergy-free.Generally the manufacturerer of the cloth use about 600 to 800 chemicals; many of them harmful to the body.Her endeavour was to be able to source and sell a fabric that uses more of natural materials that are not harmful to the body and the environment, reducing the chances of allergies and illnesses caused by skin contact and fumes of the harmful substances from the fabric. This also protects the health of the artisans too.Today, the MORALFIBRE cloth is made of biodegradable materials, using finite energy and resources so that it makes less negative impact on the environment. Unlike other industrially manufactured woven and knitted ones, these hand crafted fabrics making involve hand spinning and hand weaving using people energy instead and has far-reaching economic and social benefits to the artisans living in remote villages.The primary source of raw material too remains certified organic cotton and non-certified cotton sourced from local farmers from the Saurashtra region and within 450 km radius of Ahmedabad. Natural alternatives such as natural spinning oils that biodegrade easily are used to facilitate spinning; potato starch is used for sizing. A good boiling wash removes the cotton wax. Fabrics are natural, greige (unfinished woven or knitted fabric that hasn't been bleached or dyed. It can be used for upholstery, window treatments, clothes and more) and white, yarn dyed and fabric dyed with azo free dyes.The weaving is single yarn, double yarns, plain or twisted. The prints are mainly hand block printed by local artisans in Indo- Western and contemporary styles. All this is done by over 3,000 artisans from various cooperatives in the region.For marketing, MORALFIBRE acts more as a web-based social enterprise, using the world-wide optic fibre network to connect producers to the buyers. On one hand it works locally with co-operatives by creating work opportunities in fabric production, processing, dying, printing and tailoring. On the other, they approach buyers and potential buyers through networks, mainly in a B2B wholesale marketplace spread internationally across the UK, the US, Australia and many EU countries, over the internet.Though the venture has been making a few ripples in the world fashion industry, the big bang break came last year when the fabrics were used by Warner Brothers in their Hollywood production and Hugh Jackman-starrer Pan. Currently into clothing, Shailini now plans to soon launch a range of garments that too will be sold only online."

As compared to the price of Rs5-6 per kg in 2015, local farmers are currently fetching Rs10 per kg in the wholesale markets, thanks to lower production in other states.Top potato growing states -Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal -have seen production decline by 5% and 15%, respectively, due to unfavourable weather conditions. Although the yield in Gujarat, too, has dipped by 10% this year, unlike other major states Gujarat has registered an increase in potato production on account of higher acreage. In fact, the potato output has galloped substantially over the last two years.The potato production in an area of one lakh hectare was around 35 lakh tonnes as against 31 lakh tonnes of 2015 and 23 lakh tonnes in 2014.Agriculture minister, Babubhai Bokhiriya, said, ""There is low potato production in the country, barring Gujarat, and hence the farmers are getting good prices. The other reason being that the state has, in the last one year, increased its cold storage capacity, which has led to better storage facilities, and hence the farmers expecting a higher price later are storing their produce, rather than selling on spot,"" he said.""Last year, there was a glut in the market. The supply is higher this year, but the excess output has been absorbed by increase in storage capacity providing a much needed cushion to the farmers. The prices would have fallen this year, too, had there been a rise in potato production across the country,"" said Ashish Guru, president, Gujarat Cold Storage Association.The cold storage capacity in Gujarat saw addition of approximately 6.25 lakh tonnes (1.25 crore bags of 50 kg each). Currently, the capacity is 22.50 lakh tonnes, while the annual consumption of potato in the state is 20 lakh tonnes. The lower output in other states kept the prices of vegetable firm, and farmers in Gujarat are able to reap the benefits due to availability of cold storages. ""The wholesale prices had plummeted to Rs 5-6 per kg in Gujarat last year due to glut in the market. However, the prices have remained at Rs 10-13 per kg in 2016 much to the relief of farmers,"" Guru added.Gujarat has over 420 cold storages located mainly in Banaskantha, Sabarkantha and Kheda. Gujarat potatoes are supplied to Maharashtra and states in south India, and are exported to Sri Lanka, Vietnam and Mauritius."

The vegetable that made headlines last year when its price touched Rs70 a kg is today selling for just Rs5 a kg in the bulk market. In neighbourhood vegetable markets, the rates are ranging from Rs14 to 16 a kg, less than half the price last April.Hoping to get higher prices like last year, farmers had increased the area under onion cultivation. This has led to a deluge of supply, bringing the prices down. The production has gone up in all onion growing states like Gujarat, Maharashtra and Karnataka. White onions are being sold at Rs5 to 6 in the wholesale market and it is Rs7 to 8 for the red variety, said a source in M/s Afzal Trading Company, a firm based at Kalamna agriculture produce market yard. In a month, the rates have gone down by Rs2 per kg, he said.The current rates are not even enough to meet the production cost for farmers, who need to get at least Rs6 to 7 a kg to break even, sources said.Vijay Rathore, a cultivator from Dhule district, said now farmers have begun holding on to the stock. ""Even I have stored around 200 quintals in a chali (bamboo enclosure used to store onions). I will wait for the rates to go up,"" he said The cost of each chali comes to around Rs25,000, he said.There is a glut in Karnataka too, which is the second major source of supply for traders in Nagpur. B Ravishankar of M/s Ravi Trading Company said the southern crop, which starts in July-August is exhausted by January in the normal course. However, the arrivals are continuing even in April and are expected to last for one more month. This shows that the prices will remain subdued in the near future. In Bangalore, the bulk rates have touched Rs5 a kg, he said.Potatoes, which are traded along with onions, are however getting slightly costlier. The rates opened at Rs600 per 50kg at the start of the season at Mainpuri in UP, a major supply centre. As against this, it was Rs400 last year when the production was relatively low.A trader at M/s Aditya Kumar and Co in Mainpuri said this is because this year the potato growers are holding on to the crop and allowing only limited supplies into the market. So, despite higher output the rates have remained firm.A trader at Ram Aloo Bhandar at Gokulpeth market said potatoes are costing Rs20 a kg and the rates are inching up gradually. At this time of the year, when fresh supply is available, the rates are usually in the range Rs12 to 14 a kg. However, this year the commodity is in shortage at the bulk market, he said."

Bengaluru-born Mukundan and his four co-founders were exploring the Internet of Things space, the idea of connecting ordinary objects to send and receive data. They considered telemedicine, but decided against it since many MNCs were in the business.That's when one of the founders pointed to the problems in dairy management, inclcuding that milk stored in regular containers become non-consumable after a few hours. His uncle was an organic dairy farmer in Tiptur, a town 150km north west of Bengaluru, and had trouble managing his cattle and the supply chain. They liked the idea so Mukundan, now 41, and the team spent the next eight months at the dairy farm and also visited farms in Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab and Odisha. Their company, Stellapps, used their learnings to develop automated dairy solutions, and now works with milk cooperative societies such as Aavin, Milma and Tirumala. Its products are in 250 farms and are used by three lakh dairy farmers.Agriculture in India is a $370 billion sector, but there is little application of technology to improve productivity and lift millions out of poverty . Now, a clutch of entrepreneurs is looking out of their city offices to the countryside to change this.Bengaluru-based Flybird Agri Innovations places sensors in the soil to detect moisture content and control irrigation. It's installed sensors in 45 villages in Karnataka to help farmers in the drought-hit state optimize irrigation. The company is supported by Chennai-based Villgro, a social impact fund backed by Dell Foundation.Most companies faced resistance when they first set up their equipment. ""Our work exposed the malpractices of middlemen,"" says Mukundan, who is now recruiting sales people in Delhi and Gujarat.The company is looking to expand to allied sectors such as fisheries where perishabil ity is high. Despite the need for technological intervention, there's not much funding coming to startups in this sector.Funding for Indian agriculture startups declined to $56 million in 2015 from $123 million the year before, according to data from Tracxn, a startup activity tracking platform. In 2015, also a drought year, just 20 agriculture-related startups raised money , but $6 billion was invested overall in tech startups that year. Agriculture startups attracted less than 1% of the total.""The agri funds in the country are mostly early stage investors, and the startups struggle to raise subsequent rounds of funding, thus prolonging their scale up,"" says Hemendra Mathur, an investor in agri businesses and former managing director of SEAF India Investment Advisory .While overall inflation has been under control, food inflation is growing at 7%, indicating a mismatch of supply and demand. India imported corn after 16 years, and it has turned from an exporter to an importer of soya. ""The inflation translates into an additional `70,000 crore opportunity.The propensity for consumption is also going up. Droughts are an opportunity to develop various seeds and processes that help reduce water consumption without affecting productivity ,"" says Mathur.Investors tend to view agriculture as a risky proposition. ""Most investors don't understand agriculture. The strong gov ernment intervention in the sector along with the vagaries of nature accentuate the business risks associated with startups in the space,"" says Srikrishna Ramamoorthy , partner at Unitus Seed Fund, an India-focussed fund supported by Gates Foundation that invests in social impact enterprises. It has invested in agri startup Villfarm and is looking for more opportunities. Ramamoorthy says most small farmers are not willing to try technology , and even the large farmers find the equipment too expensive.""Very often, it is not whether the technology is available. The problem is whether there are India-specific solutions,"" says Mark Kahn, founding partner of Omnivore Partners, an agriculture technology focused fund. It is backed by diversified agri-business firm Godrej Agrovet, SIDBI and SBI among other financial institutions. It has invested in Stellapps and Ecozen, a micro cold storage facility that works on solar power and can be installed even in small farms.In a country where more than half of the population still survives on agriculture, fruit and vegetables worth $2 billion are wasted because of lack of supply chain management and cold storage facilities.""The big cold storage products of the west are not affordable for many Indians,"" says Kahn. He has investments in 11 agriculture startups, including Skymet, which analyses weather patterns and predicts risk in agriculture for every season.Kahn was earlier head of business strategy and mergers and acquisitions at Godrej Agrovet and found that most agritechnology startups struggle to raise funding. He convinced Godrej to anchor a fund to support more firms and thus Omnivores was founded in 2011 with a corpus of Rs 260 crore.The same year also saw the establishment of the SONG Fund by Thomas Hyland, a US citizen who came to India and travelled around the country in trains for a year. He then went on to do a management degree from ISB, Hyderabad, and established Song, backed by US billionaire George Soros, Omidyar Network and Google Capital. ""For a country of India's size, there are not enough startups that focus on technologies that addresses the lower middle class and bottom-of-pyramid solutions,"" says Hyland, who has since started a second fund Aspada.These funds work with the startups for several months before committing to investments. Hyland, for instance, worked with Pune-based SV Agri for eight months before investing. SV works with potato farmers in Maharashtra and Gujarat to improve productivity by providing better seeds, as well as working on supply chain and processing.It supplies potatoes to ITC, Marico and Pepsico for chips. ""Not many big companies or startups want to do backward integration when it comes to agriculture because they don't want to get their hands dirty ,"" says Hemant Gaur, founder of SV Agri.Rohtash Mal, a former CEO of tractor firm Escorts, has established EM3, which provides farm machinery vehicles on demand. ""Only 10% of the country's farmers can afford farm machinery and ours is a pay-per-use model. We wanted to reach 90% of the farmers,"" says Mal, who has 15 centres in MP , Bihar and eastern UP . The price is based on the farmhold area measured using satellites. Each centre sends machinery to a 20km radius and Mal says 95% of his customers come back.""Government policies treat agriculture as a poverty alleviation method rather than a means to enhance productivity and raise incomes, and this keeps entrepreneurs out,"" says Mal.Mathur says that funds like Omnivore, Villgro and Aspada give him hope, and entrepreneurs are trying to start agri businesses. ""The slowdown in e-commerce and the entrepreneurial energy will spur a new wave in rural and agricultural innovation,"" he says."

Patidars, Jats and Gujjars feel that communities that first managed to board the reservation train are uniting to keep them out. State governments would be perfectly happy to include them in the reserved category if they were not worried about the electoral backlash. Other Backward Classes (OBC) classification for Jats brings a similar demand from Rajputs; Scheduled Tribes (ST) classification for Gujjars brings about protests from the powerful Meena community unwilling to share the ST classification. Gujarat seems to have found a novel way to address these demands: be so inclusive that hardly anyone is left to protest. A 10 per cent quota for the economically backward among upper castes that is, those with family incomes of less than Rs.6 lakh per annum (p.a.)  spreads the net so wide that the excluded group is minuscule.Data on incomeSince income data are hard to come by, let us look at three different sources of data to derive estimates of those with incomes above Rs.6 lakh p.a. First, data on income tax filers in 2012-13 show that only 13 per cent of individual returns have incomes higher than Rs.5.5 lakh p.a.; once we take into account people who do not file the returns at all, this forms about 3.5 per cent of total individuals in the country aged 18 and above. Since incomes may be hidden on tax returns, we must look to alternative data. The National Sample Survey Organisation (NSSO) collects information on consumption expenditure, not incomes. If we apply household savings rate of about 25 per cent, a Rs.6 lakh income p.a. cut-off would result in a cut-off of about Rs.4.5 lakh consumption. NSSO data (2011-12) show that less than 1 per cent of the population falls in this category. A third source of data is the India Human Development Survey (IHDS) of 2011-12, organised by the National Council of Applied Economic Research (NCAER) and University of Maryland. It collects data for both income and expenditure. It shows that less than 2 per cent of the population had household consumption of Rs.4.5 lakh p.a. and about 2.5 per cent had incomes of Rs.6 lakh p.a. in 2011-12. This suggests that whatever statistics we use, a Rs.6 lakh p.a. cut-off will exclude less than 5 per cent of the population from being eligible for reservations if the Gujarat example is followed nationwide.These statistics should calm the passions around this new wrinkle in the battle for reservation in Gujarat. Appeasement tactics used by the Gujarat government are mostly ineffective; they will neither reduce options for middle-income Indians nor will they really expand benefits for the poor among forward castes.Can we devise a narrower band that might really benefit the poor among groups currently ineligible for reservations? Here, our spectacular failure in identifying the poor for issuing Below Poverty Line (BPL) cards gives us reason to be wary. The IHDS survey found that in 2011-12, only 50 per cent of the poor had a BPL card while nearly a third of the non-poor had BPL cards. Almost all observers agree that identifying the poor is a difficult task resulting in errors of both inclusion and exclusion. This is particularly the case when incomes are growing rapidly and a household that is poor in one year may well climb out of poverty the following year. So focussing on just the poor among the general category may be more difficult than we anticipate.Moreover, the demands for expansion of reservation have little to do with the poor among the so-called general category. Most of these demands are emerging from angry young men  many of them with college education  among agriculturalist communities that have historically held considerable political clout (for instance, the Navnirman movement of the 1970s, which the Gujarat government is acutely aware of).Future of reservationIn order to get out of this quagmire, we need to think of the immediate concerns of educated youth and the broader future of reservation in India. What fuels the anger of young men from agricultural communities? As they see it, investing in education has got them only minor monetary benefits. With massive growth in private and distance education programmes of questionable quality, most college graduates today lack the skills for high-paying private sector jobs. They may well be qualified for lower-level clerical or support positions, but for these jobs salaries are far lower in the private sector than the public sector. The ratio of government salary to private sector salary for a college graduate has consistently increased; the IHDS data show that in 2004-05, a college graduate earned 62 paisa in the private sector for each rupee in the public sector; by 2011-12 it had dropped to 57 paisa. With implementation of the Seventh Pay Commission, this difference will grow. Not surprisingly, competition for government jobs is fierce. As Prabhat Mittal, Secretary, Government of Uttar Pradesh, noted, in 2015 nearly 2.3 million applications were received for 368 low-ranking positions in the State government. Is it surprising that frustrated young men try to beat this insane competition by demanding inclusion in the reserved category? If government salaries were more on a par with the salaries of the private sector, it is possible that this strident demand may subside. If current initiatives for increasing employability and creating more manufacturing jobs succeed, this will also reduce the pressure.A longer-term solution, however, requires re-evaluation of the fundamental nature of Indias reservation regime. Affirmative action to make space for communities that have historically been subject to discrimination fits well with the Indian ethos of creating a level playing field and is part of the Indian Constitution. But the patchwork implementation, particularly for the OBC classification that is currently in place, makes little sense and leaves room for powerful lobbies to unite around demands for inclusion.One of the ways of dismantling the quota raj is to ensure that the reserved category certificate is not a currency that is hoarded by groups who no longer need it. This involves periodic recertification into the reserved category. Unfortunately, the current system has an established, if imperfect, procedure for notification of new groups into the reserved category but not for moving groups out of the reserved category. A first step towards establishing such a process may be to ensure that we collect data on caste/tribe affiliation along with data on basic demographic and housing characteristics in the 2021 population census. This would allow us to move past the exclusive reliance on the 1931 census and obtain information on the current socio-economic conditions of all castes and communities in India.Frankly, I have never understood the resistance from the Office of the Registrar General and Census Commissioner of India (ORGI) for collecting caste data in national population census. If the colonial census could do this in 1931, why cant we do it today? Collecting data on thousands of castes is difficult, but it is by no means impossible. Perhaps, the collection of data on caste is a hot potato that the ORGI hopes someone else will handle. But surely national interest demands that this caution be put aside to develop a long-term solution to an issue that has gained such visibility. While we are destined for periodic eruptions of demand for reservations by groups like the Jats, without timely and accurate data we have no way of developing a rational system for responding to these demands.Sonalde Desai is Senior Fellow, NCAER, and Professor of Sociology, University of Maryland. Views are personal.If government salarieswere more on a par with the salaries of the private sector, it is possible that this demand may subside"

It is unwashed clothes piling up over a week that has got her goat. Kundalia, located 30 km from Pakistan, is one of the 52 drought-hit villages of Banaskantha. Residents here are univocally furious with the state government for depriving them of Narmada water like those in the rest of the 1114 drought-hit villages. But what particularly annoys this expectant mother is that a water tanker, ""which turns up once in three days and at no fixed time"", dictates how and when she should go about her domestic chores.It's been three hours since her family members called for the tanker and it has not arrived yet. She says that sometimes the tanker does not turn up for days and her family goes without a bath for an entire week. ""If the driver feels like it, he will oblige. As such, the tanker supplies water for about 45 mins which is not enough for the village,"" she says. Of the 2,500 families in Kundalia, only 600 live in pucca houses. The rest live in tents on their farms. As farming is out of question, the menfolk work as labourers and take up carpentry and plumbery in Deesa, the nearest town.""We get paid Rs 100 to Rs 200 a day. We would not be at the mercy of others if the government just gave us water to irrigate our fields. We can then grow bajra, jeeru, matth and moong,"" says Samthabhai Suthar, 40. Soon, a tanker arrives, honking continuously, and parks itself near a dirty cattle trough. Balancing metal pots on their heads, the womenfolk rush to the spot. They queue up to fill water from the tanker tube while the thirsty cattle lap up water from the trough. A war of words breaks out inevitably because everybody is in a hurry.Sometimes, a ""miracle"" happens, as one of them puts it  The village school receives a trickle of water from the Deesa pipeline and the women queue up there. Prakash Goswami, 22, a resident, says, ""Women walk down four km daily to fetch water. At times, they are forced to return without a drop because 10,000 litres of water provided by the tanker is not enough for the village. A family of six needs at least 200 litres daily. The village has a huge water tank, but the stored water turns saline since this is a desert area."" Water seems to be the single most deciding factor that determines their future  in Kundalia, education is a privilege for boys alone as the families do not allow girls to attend school because ""who will go and fetch water then?""The village has seen about two to three divorce cases in the recent past because of the water issue. ""Our neighbours have left the village and moved to Ahmedabad. Some time ago, their daughter-inlaw left them because she was tired of making daily trips for water,"" he says, adding, ""That is what happens when you go looking for girls from another village. They cannot adjust to our circumstances."" During the wedding season or festivities, the village orders for food and water from Tharad taluka. Interestingly, one or two shops in the village sell local soft drink brands, but water is too much to ask for. ""A water tanker is hardly seen here, but the soft-drink vans always do the rounds and ensure the shops have enough supply,"" says Lalji Rajput, 22, who works in a diamond polishing unit nearby.Villagers can diss the state government as much as they want but sarpanch Karsan Rajput gives the administration a clean chit. ""A lot of people here live on the farms here and they break the pipelines supplying water from the Deesa outlet. Since we are a village at the farthest end of Banaskantha, we do not receive water. It is not the government's fault,"" he says. ""How is it not the government's fault? If people are resorting to such illegal ways, surely some action can be taken. Why can't they ensure us a steady supply of water like it does for the rest of the world?"" asks Prakash.Around 5 km ahead of Kundalia is Radha Nesda, the first village of Gujarat that is entirely powered by solar energy. Almost every mud house ('bhunga') here is fitted with solar panels. Recently, the state government also allocated 1,407 hectares of land here to Gujarat Power Corporation to set up a 750 MW ultra-mega solar plant. So while the villagers are thankful for the power supply, they complain about being sidelined by the government when it comes to paani. Around 350 families and livestock live in this arid region. Valiben Mavabhai, 55, a resident, says she has lost count of the cattle that died due to perennial water scarcity in the region.Villagers survive on the water found in the small wells ('virda') they dig on their farms. If they are lucky, the water is sweet, but it doesn't remain so beyond 10 days. So they abandon that well and dig another. ""We survive on the virda as long as it lasts. Once the water turns saline, we dig another. This has been going on for decades now. We have more or less accepted the fact that we will never get water. The tankers only provide water to the Border Security Forces,"" she says. Every morning, she leaves home with her husband for Deesa to look for work and the couple returns by night. Bajri no rotlo, batata nu shaak and chhas is the staple food of this region. ""Usually we get paid Rs 100- 200 a day. If we get lucky, we buy onions on the way and make dungli nu shaak,"" she says.The hardships faced by the villagers of Suigam, around 35 km from Kundalia, are no different. The only silver lining is the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act project that has them busy these days. On Friday, ahead of CM Anandiben Patel's visit to Suigam, around 300 villagers were out in Jodiya digging earthen bunds for rain water harvesting. The bunds, a 100-day project, can store water for two months during monsoon. They were provided Banas Dairy buttermilk packets by MNREGA officials. A water tanker was also parked here for these workers.""This is all a show. Just because the CM is visiting today, you see a water tanker parked here. Otherwise, you will never see one in our village,"" says Talabhai Parmar, 30. While MNREGA's Deputy DPC P M Gorecha hailed the bund project as a blessing for the villagers battling acute water scarcity, the latter feel doubly cheated. ""It usually rains here in July. By then the bunds will be ready to store water and the 1,435 families that live here will be benefited. Besides, we are providing employment to the villagers and also creating assets for them,"" he said. But sarpanch Ramsinh Rajput is not excited about the project. ""Firstly, we would not have to be part of such a project if we they simply give us water from the Narmada canal. Secondly, the MNREGA labour charges are a pittance. We get paid only Rs 178 per head for the work whereas the same work for a private contractor will earn us Rs 300,"" complains sarpanch Ramsinh Rajput, who has a debt of Rs 4 lakh. He claims he has been submitting memorandum seeking Narmada water to the state government for the past seven years, but to no avail.""It would be nice if agricultural loans were given to us at 1% interest rate instead of 7%. We find it difficult to sustain ourselves,"" says Rajput, adding, ""We spend Rs 200 every day on fodder for cattle and they produce just 3 litre of milk daily. If there is regular water supply, we can feed them green fodder and they can produce 6-7 litres of milk."" He along with others from the village go to Deesa to work on potato plantations or construction of roads and buildings.Only 100 families in Suigam get water from the Deesa pipeline, which is released to a common livestock trough here for 20 minutes to an hour every third day. Villagers come walking from as far as six km and queue up here in the afternoon. The tankers supply water to the villagers only once in three days. Asked how they were coping with the water crisis Maniben Bhurabhai, 30, says, ""How does anyone care about us? If you go without taking bath for a week and walk down six kms with three pots on your head, you'll now how we are coping up."""

You are heading to D.C. to bond with a lame duck president. That is a wasteful exercise, and I will tell you why.The New York Times has carried an article today portraying you and President Obama as an odd couple; how great he is and how tarnished you are. But ignoring your alleged record in Gujarat for a second, let us understand what Obamas record is.The New York Times portrays Obama as a fervent protector of minorities, code words for blacks. But blacks continue to be slaughtered by Americas mostly white police, which often gets away scot-free. America is more racially polarized today than when Obama came into office. His own polarizing lecturing is the principal reason why so many whites are plumping for Donald Trump.Obama continues to take civilian lives, in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq, Libya, and Syria. He has droned Pakistan and Afghanistan to death, way more than George W. Bush ever did. Now W. was a real friend of India. I met him just before he became president, and he promised me that he would treat India at the same level as China. In one year after entering office, he had ushered in a landmark nuclear deal with Manmohan Singh. He then personally coerced China to agree to the deal.Obama says that he will enable Indias entry into the nuclear suppliers group, but it is an empty offer, because he knows that China will block the deal, and everyone knows that he will not be able to budge China. His foreign policy is in shambles. The minute he discovered oil in the U.S., he signed an agreement with the Iranians, spurning and scaring the hell out of Americas long-standing allies, the Israelis and the Arabs. If Trump comes into office, quite possibly the first thing he will do is to rescind the deal with Iran.Obama left Iraq because the Iraqi government would not let him have his version of AFSPA. He thus enabled the creation of ISIS. He abandoned Muammar Gaddafi, who had become Americas and W.s friend by destroying all his weapons of mass destruction. North Korea and Iran got a valuable lesson: never stop creating nukes and toxins. Today, Libya is a playground for ISIS. In Syria, Obama promised to bomb Assad if he used chemical weapons. He did, and he didnt. Nobody believed the word of the US president anymore.In Afghanistan, he carelessly set an artificial deadline for the withdrawal of his troops, thereby emboldening the Taliban and Pakistan to wait him out. He first told India to keep her hands off Afghanistan, and then when the Pakistanis started troubling him, asked India to get involved in Afghanistan. Then when the Pakistanis started playing ball with him, he cut India out of the post-US negotiations in Afghanistan.This is a man whose senior advisers didnt know where Tunisia and Egypt were on the map when the Arab Spring broke out. Despite his horrendous human rights record, W. bonded easily with Manmohan Singh, Karzai of Afghanistan, Mubarak of Egypt, Blair of England. Obama by contrast is a loner. He has few friends in D.C. He can hardly call any world leader a firm friend. Would you ever tell him that the people of India dearly love him, as Manmohan told W. Yes, many in India mocked Manmohan then, but W. gave us the nuclear deal. What has Obama given us?Mr Modi, you are better off spending your time in D.C. bonding with Trump and Hillary. If they are out of town, go and meet them there. Obama will not get you a permanent seat on the UN Security Council. He well knows that China will block that as well, so his promises are just empty rhetoric.Today, India is flooded with American goods, from cars to potato chips to everything. America has become our number one arms supplier, whereas anyone with institutional memory of the army will tell you that the Americans will be the first ones to cut off spare parts if India gets into war. What good are arms without spares, especially in wartime? Russia and France have never betrayed us like that.Mr Modi, please honor your publicly-pledged Rafale deal with France. In many cases, Russian and French arms are superior to Americas. When the Chinese came out with their stealth fighter, the American media scoffed at it until they discovered that it was better in many ways than their own stealth fighter.A big problem has arisen in India today. Many of your senior bureaucrats, politicians, and military personnel have offspring settled in the US. They visit the country often and are completely enamored by it. I overheard a conversation between a former cabinet secretary and his friend at the Delhi Golf Club. The friend obviously lived in the States, and invited the retired bureaucrat to visit him there. The bureaucrat said that he was going to the US anyway to meet his family. The friend said, come spend a week with me and completely relax yourself. I laughed. As if the retired bureaucrat was working ever so hard in India.Mr Modi, these are the people who are misleading you into a strategic partnership with the US. There is nothing strategic nor partnership about it. This is all empty rhetoric with no substance. If the US can abandon Israel for Iran, when Jewish people have so much influence in America, then what are we.American media seems oblivious to the poor human rights record of its own leaders. The millions of Muslim civilians that W. and his cohorts have killed and displaced in Iraq and Afghanistan. The tens of thousands of civilian deaths that Obama has caused in Pakistan, Afghanistan, Libya and Syria. And then American media portrays Third World leaders as killers and kings of corruption. The white man loves to feel good about himself by painting the dark man black.So Mr Modi, play your cards right. Even your detractors have been stunned by the awards and the warmth that you have received in Saudi Arabia and Afghanistan. Obviously spending most of your time overseas has taught you something about the world. Obama hasnt learned a whit about the world in eight years in office. Jettison him, as well as Indian bureaucrats, et al who are trying to mislead you to frame foreign policy so that they can keep visiting their families in the US. Russia, France, and Israel are our time-tested friends. In comparison to the US, hardly any Indians live in these countries. But that doesnt make them any less than the US."

Mamata's support is important because the BJP doesn't have the numbers to ensure the safe passage of the Bill in the Rajya Sabha.According to experts, the switch-over from VAT (value added tax) to GST is likely to benefit consuming states like West Bengal more than producing states such as Gujarat. Mitra has been holding a series of meetings with the state finance ministers to arrive at a golden mean. One of the major issues coming in the way of a seamless rollout of the GST is the proposed 1% extra GST on producing states. The Congress has opposed it as the proposal has come from Gujarat. Besides, there are other issues like some states have demanded that percentage of revenue-neutral rate of GST should be put into amendment.Union finance minister Arun Jaitley and state FM Amit Mitra will be pushing hard for a consensus by bringing in some amendments over the tax proposal to reach a consensus to marry the polarities between states and political parties. Other than the economic considerations, GST has also become a political hot potato with the Narendra Modi government trying to gain confidence of the India Inc through this major tax reform. On Tuesday, Mitra will be placing the seventh GST draft in the meeting where as many as 20 state finance ministers will be present. When contacted, state FM and chairman of GST panel, Amit Mitra said, ""With Mamata Banerjee taking charge for the second term, such a national event on a significant reform agenda in city makes us proud.""With the Bengal chief minister taking a lead role among states to introduce GST, Kolkata has been chosen the venue of the meeting. This is the first time that a national-level tax reform meeting is being held in the city, a state official said. Even the VAT panel led by former state finance minister Asim Dasgupta didn't ever have a meeting in Kolkata.While giving a push to the GST initiative at the meeting of the chambers, the Bengal chief minister held that the micro, small and medium industrial units in Bengal will gain out of the unified tax procedure, bringing relief to a whole lot of people engaged in this sector."

Along with people from other states, you also see foreigners travelling to Ahmedabad quite frequently. So the restaurants have started including items that these people can easily relate to along with enjoying some new tastes,"" says restaurateur Abhay Mangaldas.Praveen Purohit, city based restaurateur feels that items like mini idli, Mexican tacos , nachos, spring rolls et al are there to fulfill the demand. He says, ""Not only our guests come from different parts of the globe, they also have good knowledge about food and are open to try something different. So we make it a point to include a few items that suit their taste buds as well. Another major reason is that majority of people find the thali too sweet for their taste, be it dal/kadhi or even the sabzi. So, we started infusing elements that balance out their taste.""While the city's population is going multicultural, there are many new thali places that are coming up at newer and posher locations, says Dilip Thakkar, founder of one of the Gujarati thali dining halls in the city. ""Initially, dining halls and restaurants serving authentic Gujarati thali were restricted to areas like Ashram Road, Usmanpura, Navrangpura and certain areas in the walled city. But now these restaurants have expanded to newer areas. And infrastructural cost goes up when you expand your business to a more expensive locality. To break even, or to make profit, you need more attractive dishes, which then amounts to the addition of popular and exotic dishes.""I love to indulge in fusion food. I have also been to restaurants and dining halls, where there are lot of items that are not there in the traditional Gujarati thali. Although, I wouldn't mind indulging in such a fusion thali occasionally, I still prefer the authentic Gujarati thali that has all the elements of Gujarat.Eating out means trying out something different or maybe a different version of your favourite cuisine. I have had Gujarati thali that had starters like samosa and manchurain and I think this inclusion is great as foodies from various parts of the world can relate to such items. They can relish the authentic Gujarati tastes whilst still having something that they love to indulge in.I love gorging on the authentic Gujarati thali, as it has many different textures and tastes. Although I'm not fond of fusion food, I would prefer if varied varieties of the same dish that are made in different parts of Gujarat are included instead of including different dishes that are not even a part of the traditional thali."

At her new home 15 km away, with nothing much to do, the 15-year-old spends time watching television. Ghar Ki Lakshmi Betiyaan, a soap celebrating daughters, and Sapne Suhane Ladakpan Ke are her favourite shows, she says.Two years ago, Priyankas family was among the 27 Dalit families who were forced to move to Sodapur from Ghada, both villages in the Deesa taluka of Banaskantha, the potato capital of Gujarat. All of them victims of untouchability, now refugees in their own state, which saw Dalit anger boiling over last month following the public flogging in Una of youths for skinning dead cattle.On Sunday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that it was our duty to protect and respect the poor and Dalit people of our country. For the Dalit families of Sodapur, these words come as cold comfort.At the entrance to Deesa, near the Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) building, a huge potato installation welcomes you. Deesa is also where Canadian food giant McCain sources its potatoes from. Large potato cold storages dot the way to Sodapur. On one side of the road that cuts through the village, stand rows of shacks covered with asbestos and lined with tarpaulin. This is the home of the Dalits from Ghada. Across the road, lives the rest of the village.The practice of extreme untouchability, the Dalits claim, led to the murder of one of them nine years ago, forcing them to first sit in protest outside the local revenue officials office for five years after which they came to Sodapur, leaving behind 100 bighas of land where they grew potatoes, castor, wheat, groundnut, bajra and rapeseed.Priyankas sister Savita, 20, is married in Dhaneri village, which is a happier village, but says this is home, where her parents and siblings live.Savita came home for her delivery and a week ago, gave birth to a daughter. The newborn lies on a charpoy, wrapped in a white cloth, flies hovering over. I have to keep it completely wrapped even in this hot weather, she says. The buffalo tied outside belongs to her grandmother Puriben who brought it from her brothers house to source milk for Savita.All the girls gave up studying when we left Ghada. What do we do? Here, we have to take them across the busy road and fetch them back, which is not possible, says Savita.Watch Video: Whats making newsAn orange cycle stands in the corner against a wall, one of the government freebies handed out to Savitas brother, who freelances as a mason, at a Garib Kalyan Mela.Even the boys gave up school. Dashrath, 18, dropped out in Class V, and is now a labourer, as his younger brother who dropped out in Class VII. They didnt let us sit together. They never played with us, says Dashrath, about his upper-caste darbar (OBC) classmates in Ghada.Talbiben weeps at the mention of Ramesh, her eldest son among five children. Her husband Devjibhai is too traumatised to put together the story of what happened.Their 22-year-old son was fairly educated and worked as an insurance agent. But he had dared to enter a temple nine years ago, breaking the rules of Ghada. And paid for it. They ran a tractor over him out of revenge. The police were also from their community and did not heed our pleas to consider it murder, alleges Devjibhai.Bhurabhai Parmar, the leader of this Dalit group, says, We protested outside the mamlatdars office for five years. Finally, the mamlatdar and other government officials came to escort us here two years ago, but have not yet built us homes.Babarsinh Vaghela, sarpanch of Ghada at the time the Dalit families left, denies allegations of discrimination and describes Rameshs death as an accident.There was an accident in which the boy died. We tried hard to strike a compromise between the Dalits and the upper castes but they just did not listen. Finally, after the 12th-day ceremony of Rameshs death, they left the village, he says.There is no untouchability in our village, says Vaghela, who was the sarpanch till 2010.But the Dalits allege that discrimination hit them every minute back in Ghada. We could not go with uncovered heads before upper castes, could not wear pants, footwear or any gold. There were two buses to Deesa, at 9 am and 12 noon, from our village. If we got a seat and a darbar got on board in the packed bus, we had to vacate, says Bhurabhai.They had to send separate vessels for their children to have midday meals. Our children were made to sit separately in the anganwadi, too, he says.The worst was when an upper-caste death occurred. We would have to carry the body, collect the firewood and do all the rituals for 12 days for free. Ramesh opposed all these discriminatory practices. His murder was the last straw that provoked us to leave, says Bhurabhai.The few Ghada children who go to school in Sodapur are happier. Ashwin, who studies at the Bhakotar primary school in Class VIII, says everyone eats and studies together.The Ghada Dalits are also grateful to the sarpanch of Sodapur, Amarsinh Dansinh Rajput, who got a resolution passed in the gram panchayat to let them stay.But only I know what I went through to get this done, says Rajput, from the only Rajput family in Sodapur which has a large population of Brahmins, Patels and other OBCs.I needed five signatures in the sabha of nine members. I cajoled and convinced them to endorse it. But later, I got booked in two criminal cases and went to jail for 10 days. In one case, a Patel accused me of loot and I paid Rs 2.65 lakh for a compromise, claims Rajput.He continues to stand by the Dalits, who now total 35 families in this village. There was a police inspector here who was a friend and he asked me if I could give some land to the Ghada Dalits and I agreed. I allotted them two bighas, says Rajput.All of the Sodapur resettlers have EPIC cards and all of them are registered under the Mahatma Gandhi Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MNREGA) since 2014, but they say none of them have got any work or wages under it. It is all on paper. We work as labourers  masons or farmers, says Bhurabhai.They are upset with the government for not building them homes, and point to half-built houses on one side of the land assigned to them. They gave us only Rs 45,000 per home of which we spent Rs 10,000 on the landfill itself, says Kaliben, one of the Dalits who moved to Sodapur.Banaskantha collector Jenu Devan says, They were given homes under the Dr Ambedkar Awas Yojana covering two installments, one of which was given. They will get the rest of the installment only after completion of their homes. This is as per the guidelines of the scheme.According to Devan, since the exodus was the result of an accident to Ramesh, it was not considered as migration. Migration is declared by the state government when conditions in the native place are not conducive to return and there is no scope of compromise with the upper castes.While Devan says that one of the Dalit families returned to Ghada, sarpanch Vaghela claims that five families have come back from Sodapur.Kaliben, meanwhile, settles down with three other women to mourn the drowning of her infant grandson in a water tank, a month ago.

The anticipated ""recompense"" in the form of a Raj Bhavan posting did not come. The former Gujarat chief minister, who demitted office early this month, did not figure among the quartet appointed as governors today, with BJP sources hinting at several reasons for her absence from the list. The four who made it are Najma Heptullah, a former Union minister who has been assigned Manipur; V.P. Singh Badnore, a former Rajya Sabha MP from Rajasthan who goes to Punjab; Banwarilal Purohit, a former BJP MP from Nagpur and owner of the multi-edition newspaper The Hitavada, who moves to Assam; and Jagdish Mukhi, a Delhi BJP leader who will take charge in Andaman and Nicobar as lieutenant governor. Mukhi, a former professor, had aspired to be projected as the BJP's chief minister candidate in the last Delhi elections but was beaten to it by Kiran Bedi, who has since moved to Puducherry as the Union territory's lieutenant governor. After Anandiben left office as Gujarat's chief minister, BJP circles had expected her to be ""recompensed"" with a gubernatorial post. Sources said there were three reasons why she was not on the list. One, Anandiben had ""refused"" to leave Gujarat that votes in December 2017. She had publicly said so just before resigning as chief minister. A Gujarat BJP source, who made it clear that he was not aligned either with Anandiben or her adversary, party president Amit Shah, claimed the former chief minister was ""lobbying"" for her daughter Anar's induction into the party ""in lieu"" of her forfeiting her post. Anar, who describes herself as a ""social worker"" and an ""entrepreneur"", is alleged to have used the clout she derived from her mother's position to help her business associates set up a company on land near the Gir lion sanctuary, purportedly in contravention of established rules. The case, highlighted in sections of the media, became a hot potato for the BJP after the Congress gunned for Anandiben. It was believed to have precipitated her exit. ""In these circumstances, there is no way that Shah or the Prime Minister will facilitate Anar's entry into the BJP,"" the source said. Although Anandiben is considered a close political associate of Narendra Modi, sources said the Prime Minister had apparently taken a ""grim"" view of the Anar controversy. Since her departure, Anandiben, not exactly known to court publicity, has reportedly kept herself in the news. On August 15, she hoisted the flag at the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation's headquarters. Tomorrow, on ""Rakshabandhan"", she is scheduled to host a get-together at a school in her Assembly constituency, Ghatlodiya, in Ahmedabad. Two, Anandiben would have to resign as an MLA if she becomes a governor. A by-election will have to be held in her constituency within six months. Sources said the BJP fears that if it loses Ghatlodiya or even retains it by a margin lower than what Anandiben had secured in 2012, it could scale down the morale of party cadres in the run-up to the state polls. Three, the governors of two large states, Tamil Nadu and Madhya Pradesh, are due to retire by end-August. Both K. Rosaiah (Tamil Nadu) and Ram Naresh Yadav (Madhya Pradesh) were appointed in 2011 by the then UPA government. Sources said it was ""possible"" Anandiben might be sent to one of these states, after BJP leaders take into account the political factors, especially the by-election and the fear that her seat might go to the Opposition."

The lemon prices has seen a sharp increase in the last few days. Earlier, the lemon was available for Rs80 per kilogram, now it costs Rs150 to Rs200 per kilogram.APMC Surat secretary Nilesh Thorat told TOI, ""Every day more than 60 trucks arrive at the market yard from Chaklasi, Deesa, Anand, Kheda and Prantij. The transporters have hiked the tariff due to heavy traffic jam on NH-8 near Bharuch. This has led to hike in retail prices of vegetables in the city. There is a short supply of potatoes and lemons. Most of the transporters are not willing to come to Surat due to heavy traffic jam on NH8.""Rasik Patel, a vegetable wholesaler at APMC, said, ""If the trucks have to reach Surat early in the morning, they have to start from their destination a day earlier, due to heavy jam on NH8 near Bharuch. The transporters are demanding more money and we have no other option. We pass on the hike to the customers."""

(Source: Twitter/@BJP4India) BJP President Amit Shah. (Source: Twitter/@BJP4India)The BJP will certainly go to the people on the issue of surgical strikes in PoK, BJP president Amit Shah said today lashing out at Rahul Gandhi over his dalali barb at Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Yesterday, wrapping up his UP kisan yatra in the capital, Gandhi had accused Modi of hiding behind the blood of soldiers and added: Unki aap dalali kar rahe ho. (You are cashing in on their sacrifice). This morning, Gandhi tweeted: I fully support the surgical strikes and I have said so unequivocallybut I will not support using the Indian Army in political posters and propaganda all across the country.By his khoon ki dalali comment, Rahul has insulted the Army, the martyrs and 125 crore Indians, Shah said.Dalali is what Congress did from Bofors to Embraer, from 2G to coal. Dalali involves some goods, what does he think this is about? Can one put a price to the blood of jawans?The morale of the very Army that risked their lives to destroy terror camps has been broken by him. I do not know what he was trying to achieve but the government, BJP and the people are standing firmly behind the Indian Army, Shah said accusing both Gandhi and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal of politicising the Army.The question is why you (Congress) are not happy, enthusiastic and proud of this, Shah said. It shows there is some fundamental flaw in youInstead of joining people in their happiness, the Congress party is with Pakistan in its despair.The BJP will certainly go to the people on the issue of surgical strikes, Shah said in reply to a question whether the strikes would feature in the BJP campaign in next years Assembly elections in Punjab and Uttar Pradesh.Zaroor jayenge, he said. I said at the very beginning that if some tehsil president had put up some posters (a reference to posters celebrating the strikes) that should not be taken into account. But we will go to the public because Army morale needs to be boosted and this achievement of the Army needs to be lauded. It was the achievement of the Army and the political will of Narendra Modi. Government was careful from the first day not to politicisethat is why the briefing was done by the DGMO and not by a political functionary, Shah said.Rahul Gandhis clarification in the morning did not cut much ice, Shah said claiming that BJP had kept all its poll promises  from securing the countrys borders and not allowing anybody to get away with beheading our jawans to one rank, one pension.Suggesting that those casting doubts on the authenticity of the strikes are anti-India leaders, Shah said, The whole country, BJP and its government are standing firmly behind the Army. We do not trust the anti-India rhetoric of leaders, we trust the bullets of our Army men.Gandhi, he said, should concentrate on potato factory, a swipe at this comments to farmers that they want potato factories. Shah also appeared to dismiss demands for releasing video evidence, saying who is seeking them.Shah brushed aside Pakistans denial. Then what was the special Pak Parliament session all about, he asked, and why is the Pak Prime Minister who comes to Islamabad only 3-4 times a month camping in Islamabad.As for Kejriwals remarks that India should counter Paks denial propaganda, he said that there is no doubt who is benefiting from his comments because Pakistanis are making him trend on twitter. The reference was to the hashtag PakStandsWithKejriwal that began trending on Thursday.Shah said Congress and Rahul Gandhi dislike Modi and recalled expressions like maut ke saudagar, (merchant of death) and zeher ki kheti (sowing poison) used by his mother and Congress chief Sonia Gandhi against Modi. The BJP won a two-thirds majority in Gujarat after maut ke saudagar and a majority after zeher ki kheti comments, Shah said, wondering how the latest statement will play out.He lauded the media for what he called its support of the government on its stand on Pakistan.Investigative journalists have dug out the truth from across the border, he said.

As per the statements by Minister of State for Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution, Ram Vilas Paswan, the Act was to be fully implemented across India by July 2016. As of now, only five States have fully executed it as per the provisions of the Central Act and the progress in other States has been tardy. The front runners are Punjab, Haryana, Chhattisgarh, Maharashtra and Rajasthan. The Act has been partially implemented in Bihar, Delhi, Himachal Pradesh and Karnataka. Preliminary surveys undertaken in some of these States have revealed positive outcomes in terms of administrative reforms, significant increase in the number of households having ration cards, and improvement in the distribution and consumption of food through fair price shops. A few of them had already initiated reforming the distribution system much before the Act was presented in Parliament. The Act, if fully implemented, is likely to benefit 720 million people through availability of 5 kg per capita per month of subsidised foodgrains (rice, wheat and coarse cereals) at a much lower rate than that in the open market. This would ensure food security and enhance nutritional status.The Odisha studyThe two concepts are interlinked, but nutrition security has a much wider connotation than food security. It encompasses a biological approach, that is, adequate and safe intake of protein, energy, vitamin and minerals along with proper health and social environment. The nutritional aspect of the quantity of grain to be distributed to each person under the Public Distribution System (PDS) is somewhat less researched, though the Act has aimed at attaining this goal. Poor quality of food lacking essential micronutrients and no diet diversity, and unhygienic conditions of storage may come in the way. There are other promising features under the Act, such as free daily meals for children and maternity benefits, including cash for pregnant women, which can combat rampant undernutrition (calorie deficiency) and malnutrition (protein deficiency) across the country. These steps may perhaps complement the existing nutritional programmes such as mid-day meals and Integrated Child Development Services.We present results from a study in rural Odisha on the contribution of PDS towards households intake of foodgrains and the quantum of calorie and protein levels. A primary survey of 385 households was carried out during 2014-15 in three extremely poor districts viz. Koraput and Bolangir in the so-called KBK (most backward) region and Nayagarh in the non-KBK region. While KBK districts follow a universal PDS, non-KBK districts have a targeted one.There is high prevalence of undernutrition and malnutrition in the selected districts. The estimates, adjusted on the basis of age, sex and work as recommended by the nutrient requirements and dietary allowances of Indians drawn up by the Indian Council of Medical Research-National Institute of Nutrition in 2010 reveal the undernourished population to be 50 per cent and the malnourished to be 43 per cent on an average for all the districts together. Calorie and protein deficiency is relatively higher (see graphic), nearly 68 per cent among the Antyodaya Anna Yojana (AAY) households, known to be the poorest of poor. It is much higher in Koraput district at 72 per cent, way above the State average of 60 per cent.Rice is the key staple food in the surveyed areas and acts as a major source of energy intake. The monthly per capita consumption of rice is estimated to be 11.6 kg, of which 33.7 per cent is sourced from the PDS by all beneficiaries. Since AAY households have higher quota and accessibility under the PDS, the contribution is much more at 73.9 per cent. Cereals (wheat and rice) make up 70 per cent of the calorie intake and 66 per cent of the protein intake, though the magnitude varies across districts. More importantly, the contribution of PDS to energy intake among AAY households is double (60 per cent) that of other beneficiaries.Better accessibility to food and hence energy intake of poor people, especially those under AAY, has been made possible due to concerted efforts initiated by the government. Major reforms initiated from 2004-05 that are worth mentioning include abolition of private procurement and storage system, and a greater role for public agencies in controlling diversion of foodgrain from the godown to the millers; proper recording of procurement, storage and distribution of grains across the departments; and distribution of food through self-help groups and gram panchayats and its regular monitoring at the block and ward levels. While revealing their satisfaction with the PDS, the beneficiaries refuted the idea of having a cash transfer system in place of the existing in-kind transfers, primarily due to fear of price hike and inadequate infrastructure i.e. roads, banks, and long distance of market from the village. In fact, the beneficiaries proposed an increase in the coverage of commodities to pulses, onion and potato under the PDS in their respective areas.Replicating Odisha elsewhereThe efforts of the State government in ensuring food security should be replicated in States that are yet to fully implement the Act and reform their respective distribution systems. Many studies have emphasised on dietary diversification to ensure appropriate nutritional intake for large segments of the poor population. This may be an important step to be taken up in States where a revamped PDS is making ground, such as in Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Bihar. Provision has been made under the NFSA to provide one additional coarse cereal viz. millet along with wheat and rice, which can further enhance the nutritional security of the poor households. Though wheat and rice contribute significantly to energy intake, the time has come to increase our focus on coarse cereals and pulses to improvise adequate intake of protein. Serious deliberations are required to make this possible through the PDS, which is going to cater to a sizeable population in the near future. As elicited above, the AAY households have a greater access to PDS but the problem of undernourishment is more serious among them.As a prerequisite, it is imperative to hasten implementation of the NFSA across the country. States should be in a mission mode as availability of foodgrains may not be a problem this year. The Ministry of Agriculture has projected a record production of 270 million tonnes owing to good monsoon and an increase in acreage of foodgrains from 101 million hectares to 105 million hectares. The States must gear up to work on adequate logistics for digitisation of ration cards, computerisation of offtake and delivery of foodgrains, and effective monitoring of fair price shops, possibly through involvement of communities or other feasible ways. This will bring in greater transparency in the system and would go a long way towards raising the nutritional status of Indians.SeemaBathla is Professor and Bal Krishan Negi a Research Scholar at Centre for the Study of Regional Development, JNU, New Delhi.The Antyodaya Anna Yojana households have a greater access to PDS but the problem of undernourishment is more serious among them"

Prices for the early variety of potato that is already available in the market too have come down, from Rs 20 per kg in wholesale market to Rs 10-12 per kg.Shortage of new currency notes has hit potato farmers in Punjab, who are now struggling to sell their stock of potato seeds. At the peak of the potato sowing season, the lack of new notes in the market is preventing potential buyers from purchasing supplies.There are buyers but they do not have the new currency. We have been sending our trucks to other states, but there are no labourers to unload the stock. There is no money to pay them, said Jaswinder Singh Sangha, general secretary of the Jalandhar Potato Growers Association. Most of the traders are small businessmen and they prefer purchasing the stock with cash, he added. The potato farmers of Punjab are also the primary suppliers of potato seeds across the country.The rates of potato seeds too have crashed over the past one week, from Rs 1,800 per 50 kg to Rs 1,000- 1,200 for the same amount.Watch What Else is Making NewsPrices for the early variety of potato that is already available in the market too have come down, from Rs 20 per kg in wholesale market to Rs 10-12 per kg.After 1984 riots, which also happened in November, this is the first time we are facing such a crisis. Trucks are ready with the supplies, but transporters do not have cash to send them to other states, said Sangha.Punjab has around 560 cold storage units which dispatch about 1.1 million tonnes (mt) of potato seeds to other states, while 0.4 mt is used by potato growers within Punjab. So far not even 40 per cent of the seed stock has been sold, said farmers.The potato planting season begins in early October and lasts till November 25 across the country. In Punjab, the seeds are sown in October itself, and the first batch of the vegetable arrives in the market by mid-November. In the other states, the potato seeds are only sown in November.Punjab, which produces about 2.2 mt of potatoes a year, supplies the seeds of the vegetable to farmers in Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat etc. Punjab meets around 63 per cent of the annual potato seed demand of the country.Apart from the small amount of seeds used in Punjab in October, most of the stock has been lying in cold storage units.Said Raghbir Singh, president of the JPGA, Several traders who had come to Punjab last week to buy the potato seeds returned empty-handed. The farmers here were not willing to accept the scrapped currency notes.We do not know how to tide over this situation. The government should have had adequate stock of new currency notes. The seed supply season lasts only for three weeks. We are bound to incur heavy losses, said Satnam Singh, a potato grower.Doaba region, where potato seeds are grown on around 90,000 hectares, is considered the potato seed bowl of the country.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

The farmers have not been paid for their paddy and cash has been sucked out of circulation. Sowing of wheat is 50 per cent of what it normally is every year, and 40 per cent of the potato crop is lying unsold.The demonetisation of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 came bang in the middle of the potato season, mid-October to end-November. Some five lakh quintals of potatoes and potato seeds are supplied from Punjab to other states. But due to the sudden demonetisation of high-value currency, almost 40 per cent of the crop has been frozen in cold storage, explains Jang Bahadur Singh, secretary-general of the Confederation of Potato Seed Farmers of Punjab.And of the 60 per cent thats been dispatched, to states like UP, Bihar, West Bengal, Karnataka, Assam and Gujarat, a third of it is lying unsold in those states. As for the two-thirds that has reached the local markets, agents are saying they cant pay until they see some cash.Money rotation has stopped and we are unable to pay for labour here, says Jang Bahadur Singh. It has also become difficult for farmers to buy seeds and fertilisers.Omkar Singh, a farmer who has 18 acres in Gurdaspur, is as broke as his farmhands. I have a credit limit of Rs 10 lakh crop with my agriculture society, but I cannot clear my debts as I have no money. I have not been paid by the government agencies that procured my paddy. All money flow has stopped, he says.Omkar Singh went to pay off his debt with the little cash he had. But they refused to take his old notes. Now I am stuck. I cannot buy seed for the wheat crop, fertilisers, pesticides. My sowing has been delayed, adds Omkar Singh.Farmer Avtar Singh of Gurdaspur describes the full circle of his frustration: I have exhausted my crop credit limit and have to pay it back. My bank wont give me my money. The procurement agencies have not paid me for my paddy. And the credit society charges me 11.5 per cent interest on my loan while I stand in queue. I cant buy fertilisers, seeds or pesticides for the wheat crop. What should I do? ''Another Gurdaspur farmer, Manjit Singh, says he has sown just two acres of his ten. It took him four days to purchase wheat seed from the market. Dealers werent accepting old currency. And half of November is gone, he says.Balbir Singh Rajewal, president of Bhartiya Kisan Union, Punjab, says farmers have been the worst hit. In the districts of Fazilka, Ferozepur, Amritsar, Gurdaspur and Sangrur, sowing of wheat is less than 50 per cent and a little better in Patiala, Ludhiana, Jalandhar.However, Punjabs director of agriculture, J S Bains, says the sowing figures are not as bad as they are being bandied about. Yes sowing has been affected. Normally, 95 per cent sowing is done by November 15. This year, 70 per cent sowing has been done till date. Out of 17 lakh quintals of seeds required for the crop, some 12 lakh quintals have already been purchased by famers, he says.Not just farmers, Punjabs traders have taken a hit too. We used to sell 100 mobile phones per day but we are barely selling one or two now, says Jagmohan Singh, who runs a mobile phone shop in Gurdaspur. No one has any money.Punjab Congress president Captain Amarinder Singh says the RBI orders prohibiting cooperative banks from exchanging/accepting old Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes are to blame for the state of affairs in rural Punjab.The state has 12,673 villages, and farmers deposit their earnings into cooperative banks, which have not been allowed to exchange old notes."

The Chandni Chowk boy already has five years of work experience with chef Manish Mehrotra, and is the name behind the citys molecular gastronomy destination Masala Library and Delhis Farzi Caf.Now executive chef at Tresind, a modern Indian restaurant in Dubai, Saini was at the Four Seasons Hotel, Mumbai, last week as part of Cellar Doors pop-up. When we tell him that he looks younger than his age in pictures, he smiles, I have put on a bit of weight.Mumbai pop-upIt was during a meal at Tresind last year that included a wagyu kebab served with a chimichuri, that convinced the Cellar Door team that Saini was the right fit for their Mumbai pop-up. They clubbed the pop-up with an invitation to take part in the Food With Benefits event held at Atul Kocchars NRI recently.Each dish was unique, something I had never tried before, which was exciting, says Cellar Doors Nachiket Shetye. His partner Mangal Dalal adds, Contemporary food in India has become a very casual street food affair without the finesse. Saini stitches a story with his dishes. Saini, too, was itching to showcase dishes in Mumbai. We are pretty well-known in Dubai, but in India, not many know of our work. I know Mangal and Nachiket well, and it was a right fit of ideas, he says.Saini owes his expertise to Mehrotra. Whatever I am today is because of him. He is strict in the kitchen when it comes to quality, precision and following procedure: he will make you cry. Saini was selected as a trainee in his kitchen right after culinary school. At the end of five years with Indian Accent, Saini was promoted to sous chef. Itching to experiment with molecular gastronomy, he moved on to set up Masala Library in Mumbai in 2013. I always had the ambition to do something of my own, and many of my ideas didnt make it to the Indian Accent menu, as the chef believed the guests were not yet ready to accept them. Saini then set up Zorawar Kalras vision of a molecular gastronomy fine dining as well as Farzi Caf with friend and chef Saurabh Udinia.Sainis route to Dubai, however, went via New York, when he won a competition by Vermilion, a Latin American and Indian fusion restaurant in Chicago. He gave up his role at Farzi Caf and took up the offer to run their New York restaurant. Not all went well. Back in India, I was used to working with 20 chefs, and here was a mere team of three chefs, two of them being Mexicans who didnt understand a word of English. How was I to cook Indian food with them? I left within two months, he says.It was a regular customer at Masala Library who opened the next door. In 2014, Bhupendra Nath was setting up a modern Indian restaurant in Dubai and I took the chance to head the kitchen there. Dubai suits me best: there is a perfect mix of East and West, with a decent Indian crown, and Europeans and Arabs who love good food.Saini says molecular gastronomy goes deeper than the eye can see. I work with molecular gastronomy only when I am convinced it will enhance my dish. His creation of wild mushroom chai is still a bestseller at Masala Library. I have added it on my Tresind menu too. It is a consomm of dark mushroom, simmered in the oven for a few good hours. We served it as a tea set, the milk powder is actually an absorbent that turns to truffle oil when it hits water, and the tea leaves are dehydrated mushrooms. When you mix it all, it is the most comforting soup ever, he says, serving us what looks like a green balloon. We shuck it into our mouths like an oyster, but the burst of flavours are pudina, tamarind and chaat masala. Its a pani puri gubara with some crunchy boondi and weve been transported to Chandni Chowk. Sainis expertise shows off more in the false samosa. Its a samosa filling in a potato canola, with an ash of freeze dried chutney. It comes in a mini ash-tray, looks like a cigar, and has a bed of ash too. Yet, it tastes like the good old samosa.Since we are on the topic of chaat, in comes life is short eat dessert first, a jalebi on a bed of chaat. I recommend eating this with your hands, he smiles, and we follow suit. The cracker jalebi adds the sweet element to the otherwise tangy and spicy papdi chaat laden with a yogurt mousse. While jalebi and fafda and jalebi and samosa are a staple breakfast option in Gujarat and north India, clubbing it with chaat is a smart idea.Pullinji, a south Indian ginger and tamarind stir-fried prawns, is a dish that wins our attention with its glazed palm sugar crust, and curry-leaf flavoured tuile.Whats new?Earlier this year, in September, Saini launched his second eatery, Carnival by Tresind, a post-modern Indian restaurant in Dubai. Vineet Bhatia started the modern Indian cuisine at his London restaurant Zaika 20 years ago. What is life after modern India? It isnt more science, but in fact, goes back in time to traditional recipes without losing its fine dining avatar. My pop-up menu includes dishes from both the restaurants, says Saini, pointing to the table that has around 20 bowls of masalas: mustard oil, brown onions from Lucknow, farsan, papad churi from Rajasthan, kesar and red onions from Kashmir, and even south Indian curry leaves tempering. All these will go into the pot of khichdi we have cooked for over eight hours, he says.Saini is greatly influenced by street food. I grew up in Chandni Chowk, he laughs. From Mumbai, he loves the tava pulao, the lesser known street food that has even made it to his Dubai menu. We wonder if chef Mehrotra has tried his food now? He has come to all my restaurants, but his visit to Tresind and Carnival by Tresind is pending. Till date, I shiver out of respect when I am serving him."

Potato growers say there are no buyers and that they are yet to receive full payments even for the stocks they have already supplied to other states before and after the demonetisation.Also, they say, the government announcement allowing farmers to purchase seed with old currency notes came quite late when the potato sowing season in other states was almost about to end.In Punjab, potato planting season is from September-end till early October while in other states, it is between October 25 and November 25.In every cold store, around 10,000 to 12,000 bags of 50 kg each have been lying. Now, we do not know where to go and what to do, said Jaswinder Singh Sangha, general secretary of the Jalandhar Potato Growers Association. I have got 22,000 packets of government certified seed in my own cold store but there is no taker.Sangha said Punjab farmers were selling potato seeds at Rs 30-35/kg to the traders from other states before the announcement of the demonetisation on November 8, but after that, buyers simply vanished.The government has put us in a big trouble and it should compensate us now, said Sangha.Now we are planning to throw this potato seed either on roads or to distribute it to the poor as there is no taker. We cannot afford to keep these in cold stores where we have to pay rent and also for next crop which will start coming in February we have to empty our stores, said Raghbir Singh, the president of JPGA.Meanwhile, the rate of table potato has been hovering between Rs 800 and 1000 per quintal in wholesale market.Punjabs potato farmers are the main seed supplier of the crop across the country. The state produces about 2.2 metric tonnes, out of which 1.5 MT comprises seed potatoes only. Currently, Punjab supplies about 1.1 MT of potato seed to other states like Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and other potato producing state and meets around 63 per cent of the seed demand of the country every year.Doaba region, where potato seed is grown on 90,000 hectares of area, is the home of potato seed for the entire country. Jalandhar too has big potato producers.The sowing takes place in early-October and harvesting towards February-March, after which the produce is put in cold stores. Yields of seed potatoes, at 8-10 tonnes per acre, are below the 12-14 tonnes for normal table potatoes. But while the latter sell at Rs 1,000-1,200 per quintal, seed potatoes fetch rates that range from Rs 2,500-3,500 for branded and Rs 1,800-2,000 for unbranded material.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

IMD to issue ‘customised’ weather advisories to help farmers",http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/pune/rain-sunshine-or-drought-imd-to-issue-customised-weather-advisories-to-help-farmers-4409240/,2016-12-04,"Better access to satellite data and improved forecasting models will help the IMD issue more accurate advisories Better access to satellite data and improved forecasting models will help the IMD issue more accurate advisoriesThe Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) will soon be able to deliver custom-made, weather-based crop advisories, in association with grass-root level organisations that will act as a bridge between the department and the farmers.Watch what else is in the newsDr Nabansu Chattopadhyay, deputy director-general, AgriMet department, IMD, said the move will help them customise their advisories for the benefit of farmers, rather than issuing district or block-level weather advisories.Since 2008, the AgriMet department has been issuing district-level weather forecasts for farmers. These advisories, which include information on temperature, rainfall, relative humidity, cloudiness and wind speed, are issued for a span of five days.Based on these parameters, the AgriMet field units issue specific crop-based advisories for the district, intended to help farmers plan their agricultural activities.However, the district-level forecast is not always sufficient to meet the requirements of individual farmers, given the wide variation in the above five parameters a single district can experience, said Chattopadhyay.For example, while areas like Maval and Mulshi may experience excess rainfall, Baramati and Shirur often have to face drought-like situation. Small and marginal land holders, who comprise about 80 per cent of the cultivators in the country, were the worst hit by the vagaries of nature.A recent study by the National Council of Applied Economic Research (NCAER) has shown that proper advisories can increase production by 25 per cent, said the IMD official. Better access to satellite data as well as newer and improved forecasting models would now enable IMD to customise their advisories, said Chattopadhyay.In order to understand the specific needs of farmers, we intend to tie up with grass-root level organisations. These organisations will help us build bridges with the local community and help us receive feedback from farmers, he said.The advisories will not only include five climatic parameters, they would also include details on how to improve productivity by fighting diseases or pest attacks. Citing an example from West Bengal, Chattopadhyay said farmers from the state had asked for prior information to fight diseases and pests which tend to attack the potato crop.This project is part of a global initiative which would be funded by agencies like the UNDP, World Bank etc. While the accuracy of district-level forecasts seem to have increased in the last few years, a recent study by IMD scientists pointed to certain shortcomings. The model had failed to determine the temperature in hilly areas accurately and the accuracy of the prediction was lesser for northeastern regions.While the weather predictions were 60-80 per cent accurate for states such as Maharashtra and Gujarat, they had varied between 40-50 per cent for Haryana. The study had shown that weather predictions for states such as Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh required improvement in accuracy levels.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

In 2015, potato sowing was conducted over 5.19 lakh hectares till December 5. This year, however, 10.17 lakh hectares have been sown by the same date. Consequently, a bumper potato crop is expected.Currently, Gujarat ranks fifth in the country in production of potato. Officials said potato production in the state has been rising steadily. While 23 lakh tonnes had come to the market in 2014, in 2015, that amount went up to 31 lakh tonnes, and to 35 lakh tonnes in 2016.Sowing of the crop picked up over last month, said officials, who reported that at least 5.51 lakh hectares had been sown in the last 20 days alone. If the trend continues, sowing will cross 12 lakh hectares - so far the highest area used to cultivate potato in Gujarat in any year.Mavjibhai Desai, chairman of the Deesa APMC attributes the exponential growth of potato farming to a number of reasons. ""This year, sowing has gone up with Narmada water reaching the northern parts of the state,"" said Desai, adding, ""The big increase in storage facilities has also drawn the attention of farmers to the cultivation of potato.""Desai said that in 2015-16 the top potato growing states - Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal - had seen their production decline by 5% and 15%, respectively, due to unfavourable weather conditions. However, unlike other potato-growing states, Gujarat had registered an increase in potato production due to higher acreage.Better prices have also attracted farmers to potato cultivation, hold officials in the agriculture department, who said farmers received a good price last year for their yields, and this year, as compared to 2015, potato seed is cheaper and more easily available.In 2015-16, cold storage capacity went up by 6.25 lakh tonnes, with the current capacity at 22.5 lakh tonnes, said agriculture department officials. Gujarat has over 420 cold storages located mainly in Banaskantha, Sabarkantha and Kheda.Potatoes from Gujarat are sent to Maharashtra and states in South India, and are also exported to Sri Lanka, Vietnam, and Mauritius."

Cumin needs more water than coriander.""With less water available, farmers are shifting to coriander from cumin. Saurashtra has less water available this year because it received less rainfall this monsoon,"" said Mahesh Vadodaria , secretary of APMC Gondal, which is among the few market yards prominent for its coriander trade.Saurashtra's 138 dams have just 1,078.25 million cubic metres of water, which is about 42.50% of the 2,537.07 MCM capacity.However, this is still 86 MCM greater than last year.

Picture by Surajit Roy Dec. 15: From murder to disenchantment to skewering questions, seemingly unconnected events in the past 24 hours in places far apart from one another have brought to the fore the unintended consequences of demonetisation in the country. Over 100 factory owners in Amritsar have handed over keys of their units to the district administration in a symbolic protest that stood out in sharp contrast with the public pronouncements of support for demonetisation from most of corporate India. ""The problem is very simple. We cannot run our units any more. Let the government do it,"" said Amit Dalmiya, who runs a textile processing unit in Amritsar. ""If Modiji can run the country, he can also run the industry... it is a question of survival and the situation has gone beyond us,"" Krishna Kumar Sharma, the president of the Amritsar Textile Processor Association, told The Telegraph this evening. One industrialist who sought anonymity indicated his political choice. Without naming anyone, he said: "" Pehli baar to aadmi par bharosa hota hi hai... baad mein pata chalta hai.... (The first time you do trust a man... then realisation dawns). They did not go into demonetisation with full planning."" On Wednesday, the industrialists handed over the keys to the additional deputy commissioner, Tajinderpal Singh Sandhu. Amritsar is home to around 60 textile processing units on which another 700-800 embroidery, knitting and weaving units are dependent. ""At this moment our units are running at 20 per cent of the optimum capacity.... The labour strength had to be halved because of the prevailing economic situation,"" said Sharma. The units have been hit badly because of sudden cancellation of bulk orders since the demonetisation drive started. ""If a person manages to withdraw Rs 2,000 from an ATM, he will buy food and not clothes,"" said an industrialist. A contract worker with HDFC Bank was stabbed to death in Gujarat by three people with whom he had allegedly struck a deal to exchange notes. Rajesh Bhilariya, 27, was called today afternoon to a village in Junagadh where he was allegedly supposed to accept Rs 9 lakh in old notes and hand over new ones, police inspector Ashok Tilva said. Rajesh worked as a "" mitra"" or ""correspondent"" (effectively rural agents) of the bank. Police said Rajesh had reached the spot with his cousin. But the three would-be cash recipients snatched the bag with the new notes and tried to escape. When Rajesh tried to stop them, he was stabbed, the police said. An SBI branch and an adjoining ATM kiosk were ransacked in Malda today after hundreds of account holders seeking cash for family weddings, potato cultivation and travel were told each could withdraw no more than Rs 3,000. The account holders had queued up at the Balupur branch in Ratua, around 50km from Malda, from daybreak. The SBI branch, with 3,500 account holders, is the sole bank in the area. Saidul Sheikh, who was in the queue, said the bank staff initially offered only Rs 1,000 when depositors demanded the weekly quota of Rs 24,000. The amount was then raised to Rs 2,000 and then Rs 3,000. The trouble broke out around noon. The bank employees and officers fled. Mushref Miyan, a trader, said he was becoming increasingly nervous. ""My daughter's wedding is on Sunday. The Prime Minister had said we could draw Rs 24,000 each week. I have about Rs 80,000 in my account. But the bank is offering Rs 1,000 and I am really feeling frustrated. The people erupted today,"" he said. Subol Pal, a farmer, said he needed Rs 40,000 immediately. ""I am not being able to start my potato and vegetable cultivation as I need to invest Rs 40,000. The cash crisis is affecting hundreds of farmers like me,"" Pal said. Ankan Paul, the manager of the Balupur SBI branch, said: ""We are helpless. We are distributing whatever cash we are being sent. The bank was shut down after the violence."" Arun Kumar Sinha, the SBI regional manager, said that things were expected to normalise after tomorrow. BJP parliamentarians and party office bearers have told Amit Shah that the government needs to ensure adequate flow of cash in banks to check discontent among the people despite continued support for demonetisation. ""The public mood is still in favour of the government on demonetisation but people are facing hardships due to the shortage of cash. The government has to increase the cash flow to keep the people favourable,"" one MP from eastern Uttar Pradesh was quoted as having told a meeting on Wednesday evening. Concerned by the feedback, the BJP leadership had called separate meetings of party MPs and office bearers on Wednesday and Thursday. The Supreme Court today took note of growing instances of new currency notes being funnelled out of banks and asked the Centre ""you are not able to secure it?"" The court also grilled the government on withdrawing exemptions granted to hospitals and pharmacies for accepting the demonetised notes. The apex court underscored that although the government claimed that it had infused new currency worth Rs 5 lakh crore into the system, the ground reality was that people were not able to get even the promised Rs 24,000 per week.

Chandrachud, attorney-general Mukul Rohatgi said certain bank officials were diverting the money. ""Bank managers had done this fraud.... The Government of India can't sit in every bank and monitor. We are having raids every day."" The submission invited a repartee from Justice Thakur and triggered titters in the courtroom: ""So your Rs 5 lakh crore has gone this way. You are not able to secure it?"" When the attorney-general contended that there had been no complaint or protests from the common man on withdrawal of exemptions, Justice Thakur asked: ""You expect all people to come here? Please tell us what is your apprehension? What is wrong in exempting government hospitals? How can it be misused in government hospitals?"""

Angered over throwaway prices for potatoes, farmers in Gujarat's potato bowl Deesa have started giving a burial to the vegetables. Huge pits have been dug and large quantity of potatoes are being dumped inside with the prices crashing to a record low.Babulal Solanki, general secretary, Potato Growers Association of Banaskantha , said, ""No one is willing to buy the potato even at Rs 60 or Rs 50 for a sack of 50kg. Before demonetization, we were getting Rs 250 per bag.""""Now, we are getting proceeds in the invalid Rs 1,000 and Rs 500 notes which farmers are not in a position to encash. Farmers need money in small denominations for daily transactions. Buyers from Mumbai, Surat and other places are not prepared to buy potatoes in new currency. As a result, the prices have crashed and growers are cashless. It's simply not affordable as the rent for cold storage is Rs 112 per bag,"" said Solanki.Ganpat Kachhwa, general secretary, Gujarat Cold Storage Owners Association , said, ""At present, we have about 20 lakh potato bags in Banaskantha alone while similar quantity is lying at other cold storages in Vijapur, Dehgam, Modasa and other small places.""""The influx of new crop is expected in February. Since the period of taking back the load was in November 2016, we want to dispose the present stock even free of cost,"" Kachhwa said.The potatoes are being given to the cattle sheds and gaushalas for free in order to vacate the old stock. Farmers themselves are bearing the transportation cost too, said Popat Mali , a potato farmer in Deesa.Last year, the production was 2.84 crore bags of potatoes in Banaskantha while this year it is likely to increase further, he added."

On an average, the cost of production for potato is Rs. 7 to Rs. 8 per kg, but the farmer is getting way below it, Jaswinder Singh Sangha, general secretary, Jalandhar Potato Growers Association, told The Hindu .Same time last year, farmers were getting around Rs. 600 per 50 kg, he said.The new season potato crop from the Kandi belt, including Hoshiarpur and neighbouring districts of Punjab and also Una district in Himachal Pradesh, has started arriving in the markets but farmers are finding it difficult to sell their crop in the absence of buyers.Since demonetisation, traders are facing cash crunch, resulting in a drop in bulk orders from big markets like Delhi. In local markets there are a fewer buyers and hence farmers are getting a far lower price, Mr. Sangha said, adding that the potato grower had earlier suffered losses due to drop in sale of seeds and now again when the fresh crop has reached the market.Potato growers from Punjab on Wednesday wrote a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, asking him to waive off their crop loans.Clash with peak seasonWhile we appreciate the governments [demonetisation] move, we have suffered huge losses. Potato seed farming business accounts for nearly Rs. 1,500 crore annually, but this year we are estimating a loss to the tune of Rs. 800-900 crore, he said, adding that demonetisation had clashed with the peak season of potato seed when it is supplied nationwide.Notably, Punjab produces quality potato seed, which is distributed across the country, including in West Bengal, Gujarat, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Odisha. Potato seed is supplied from the first week of November to mid-December every year. In neighbouring Haryana, the situation is no different as farmers are forced to sell potato at a dismal price on account of poor demand."
