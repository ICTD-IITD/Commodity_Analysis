When they returned, Sonu was weak and admitted to a hospital.Wadwis son survived and made a full recovery but about 400 other children died from malnutrition-linked illnesses in Palghar between April and November 2016 -- a rising trend that campaigners put down to an annual pattern of migration for work.In the last three years, malnutrition has claimed the lives of about 1,600 children in Palghar, a tribal region battling high unemployment and poverty, with national headlines over child deaths prompting government action to address the problem.Read: Maharashtra tribals dont eat wheat, barter it for salt, oil, says studyKhoch lies 150 km from Indias commercial capital Mumbai and close to the border with Gujarat, one of the countrys most prosperous states, but unemployment is forcing parents to move to cities to find work to feed their children.Palghars problem of malnutrition is shocking because of its proximity to Mumbai, but it is migration to Mumbai that is at the root of this problem, said Milind Thatte, founder of Vayam, a movement for tribal development.People from Palghar migrate to Mumbai for work, but the cost of living there is very high. They dont eat to save money.Villagers start leaving Palghar in December for the Mumbai satellite towns of Thane and Bhiwandi where they often work 12-hour shifts at construction sites or road building projects.Once the monsoon season halts construction, workers return to villages in July for a jobless spell until October, when the start of the harvest provides daily work on farmland.Locals refer to September as starvation month, when many people are unemployed and childrens deaths peak.The end of the harvest in December again signals the end of the villagers home stay.We have no work now, but we will leave soon. We are waiting for the seth (the construction site contractor) to come and take us, Wadwi said.BOTTOM OF THE LADDERNamdev Savara, a member of the Kathkari tribe, has devoted an entire wall of his one-room hut in Khoch to colourful depictions of Indian gods and goddesses.So when his son, Ishwar - which means the supreme lord in Hindi - died in September, he hung a black and white picture of the child on this wall of worship.Savara said he will not leave Khoch in 2017 and he will work on a local road construction project with his wife. The couple will stay close to their two other children who go to school.According to government data about 39% of Indian children suffer from chronic undernutrition and around 42.5% are underweight.In Palghar, malnutrition most affects the Kathkari tribe -- a one time forest community which is among the lowest in the pecking order of the Indian caste system.Most children who died this year due to malnutrition-linked illnesses were from the Kathkari community, said Nidhi Chaudhari, who heads the Palghar local government office.Vivek Pandit, an activist who has represented the area in the Maharashtra state assembly, said Kathkari people dont have land and are handpicked for their ability to do strenuous work.They work at construction sites, break stones for road construction or at brick kilns, Pandit said.Employers usually prefer to hire Kathkari couples as they coordinate better and are cheaper than two men, with men paid around 200 rupees daily and women anywhere between 50 and 100 rupees.The migrant workers survive on rice and the occasional dish of potato and onions, saving their money for the jobless months.WEAK AND VULNERABLEDoctors said children suffer due to irregular feeding patterns when both parents work long hours.The parents priority is not their childs health but to earn their daily wages, said Ramdas Marad, superintendent at the Palghar sub-district hospital that runs at twice its capacity in the monsoon months between June and September.Children are more vulnerable to disease such as pneumonia or respiratory infections during this time as they are weak and their immunities are compromised.The government is drawing up a list of Kathkari tribe members to ensure they benefit from the government schemes for jobs and education, among the others that they are eligible for.The government has even started a new road project in Khoch to attempt to slow migration, but only a handful of people who have bank accounts are so far eligible.Savara is among them but his decision to stay in Khoch this year is an anomaly in the village where migration began last month.Many, such as Wadwi, even committed to leave in September, when a contractor visited families and bought promises of migration against an advance payment.I know my child was malnourished when we migrated last year. But what will I feed him if I dont work? she said."

Some have even approached us to supply maize in bulk.""Bangarmau has half a dozen big flour and maize mills, a dozen rice mills, large cold storage for potatoes and numerous mandis for green vegetables and fruit. The launch of the expressway in November facilitated farmers, mill and mandi owners significantly as they are able to transport their produce to man dis of Gorakhpur, Delhi and Lucknow in almost half the time it used to take earlier.Mandi owner Jameel Ahmad said, ""Once the eway is opened for trucks, we would be able to supply potatoes and muskmelon in bulk to Lucknow in less than two hours. Even supply to Mahewa mandi of Gorakhpur, which took six hours, will now take only four hours.""Shopkeepers said the expressway can help them reach more markets in Delhi, Haryana and Punjab as now they are directly connected to Agra. Maize mill owner Sanjeev Kumar said, ""Earlier, the trucks took two days to reach Delhi as they had to halt at Agra after travelling from Bangarmau for one full night.They reached Delhi after another night's journey but now they will reach in only a day as they will join the Yamuna Expressway from Agra. Freight charges have reduced to almost half to benefit entrepreneurs as well as farmers.""The e-way has also solved the problem of transporting perishable commodities on time as trucks carrying fruit and vegetables to mandis of other cities will reach in almost half the time. Singh added that UP government has proposed many cold storage for potatoes along the e-way like in Kannauj and Safipur. This will help farmers sell potatoes at profitable rates and prevent rotting.There is a big demand in Delhi and Haryana."""

Her clothes were found here. Express Photo by Gopal Kateshiya The trench in which the girl spent 34 days. Her clothes were found here. Express Photo by Gopal KateshiyaThe pit, partially shaded by babool trees and on the edge of a cotton farm, is lined with saris and other womens clothes, empty wrappers of potato wafers, snacks and biscuits, broken bangles, and tin sheets stripped from cans of edible oil and sticks which were used to cover the trench. Some distance away, visible from the pit, is a clearing in the fields, strewn with polythene bags of the kind used to pack illegal country liquor, and more clothes, as well as firewood, a blackened oil tin that may have been used to heat water, a toothbrush, and a toothpaste.It was in this pit  around 5 ft deep, 7 ft long and 4 ft wide  in a village in Morbi districts Wankaner taluka that a 15-year-old was kept confined for more than a month. If she stood up and craned her neck, she could see the clearing where she was taken to and allegedly raped most nights.Eight people have been arrested since the girl was rescued, including the 18-year-old accused of raping her and his father and other relatives. Last month, she underwent an abortion. On December 29, the girls family left their home and are now living by the roadside, claiming threats from the accused.The two families are neighbours and distant relatives from the same community, Devipujaks, who are mostly landless labourers. The girls family is better off of the two.Watch What Else Is Making NewsIn their defence, the accuseds family is calling it an affair gone wrong. In her statement, the girl has told police, Naresh forced himself on me inside the pit the same night that I was kidnapped. Later, he would pull me out of the pit at night, rape me and push me back in the pit before daybreak. He would tie my hands and legs, gag me and threaten me with a knife, asking me not to yell or to try escape.Before leaving, he would allegedly cover the pit with the tin sheets, leaving just a small gap for her to breathe.The eldest among six siblings, the girl has studied till Class VII and would help her parents till their 12-bigha land. Her mother says she dropped out since there werent many girls in her class.The girl says she had gone out of her home to relieve herself late on the night of November 10 when Naresh kidnapped her. She told police that eight men pushed her into a rickshaw, took her to the isolated farm taken on lease by Nareshs family, around 2 km away, and shoved her in the trench. Nareshs father, who usually drives a rickshaw, had taken the field on an annual lease of Rs 5,000 and planted cotton.The land belonging to the girls family is located close by. They searched for her for five days before registering a police complaint on November 25.A dupatta finally gave away the pit. Nareshs younger brother Pavlo spotted it in the field and told his father Jayanti it was mine. He knew I was missing. Naresh and Jayanti feared that being a child, Pavlo would spread the word. Therefore, they had no option but to inform my family that I was in their field, says the girl, her voice cracking.The date was December 13  34 days after she went missing  remembers her grandfather.Naresh was booked for kidnapping, rape, illegal confinement and under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act as the victim is a minor. Police also arrested his elder brother Haresh, 20, father Jayanti, 45, uncles Chatur and Devkaran, and three other relatives, Avcharan, Chana and Kishor, after the girl said they had helped Naresh kidnap her. The clothes the girl was wearing on the day of her kidnapping were among the items seized from the pit.After a medical examination showed she was pregnant, the POCSO court allowed an abortion. Police have taken samples of the foetus and sent them for DNA tests.The grandfather says that due to the long confinement, the girl has suffered physically and mentally. When we rescued her, her eyes had sunk in. She was so gaunt She cant sleep well even now, she is afraid still, he says.The grandmother accuses the 18-year-olds family of being bootleggers prone to violence, and says they threatened to abduct two more girls of the family following the police case. We are terrified to go back to our village, she says. The family has handed over their land to a fellow villager to till, and has written to Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani seeking aid.While police took nine more people into preventive custody following the girls familys complaint of threats, they are out on bail.Morbi SP Jaypalsinh Rathore says they are ready to offer all help. There is a witness protection system. If the girls family approaches us, we shall provide them protection. But we are hearing about threats to them through the media.In his statement to police, Naresh has said he and the girl were involved in an affair for three years. On the night of the incident, she told me on the phone that she would die if I did not elope with her. I agreed.The 18-year-old, who was taking computer lessons in Rajkot after failing in his Class XII examinations, claims he had bought her a phone and it was through this that they stayed in touch.While the girls family denies this, and police say they have not recovered any such phone, Nareshs mother Radha shows a mobile with 2G connection, claiming it was the phone her son had given the girl. Radha says he confessed to her about the affair and gave the phone before his arrest.The girl was besotted with my son and that is why he failed his Class XII exam last year There is a bagful of love letters she wrote to my son, Radha says, showing a smart phone reportedly belonging to her son with photos of the two.She also questions the girls claim that she had gone out of her home to relieve herself when she was kidnapped. There is a toilet at her home. Why did she go out at night? The toilet is located adjacent to the girls house, and can only be accessed from outside.Nareshs sister Neeta claims the girls family was aware of their affair. The younger sister delivered her love letters to Naresh. Her aunt knew about the phone calls between them, she says.Radha adds that they too fear reprisal from the girls side as all the men in the family are now behind bars.However, she admits that none of it absolves Nareshs crime, and says they had no idea about it. For a month, he kept her in the trench and we all were in the dark.Naresh would spend the day at home and leave for our field in the evening, saying he would guard the crop against nilgai at night. Since we were all busy with the wedding of my elder son Haresh, nobody went to the field for weeks. His father went there two days after the wedding and found the girl there. Immediately, he called up her grandfather, Radha says.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"
58ff1c877be9e041361628f2,"Thanks to note ban, farm sector may not see 'acche din'",http://www.deccanherald.com/content/594489/thanks-note-ban-farm-sector.html,2017-02-02,"Sagar Kulkarni, Feb 3, 2017, DHNS 8:48 ISTDateline: New DelhiDays after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced scrapping of high value currency notes, Agriculture Ministry officials were eagerly awaiting the details about sowing for rabi crops across the country. The government was facing all round criticism for having announced the note ban at a time when the agriculture sector was witnessing an upswing on the back of a better monsoon after two consecutive drought years.The sudden withdrawal of legal tender of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 currency notes had left the farmers devoid of any cash to buy seeds or fertilisers. But as the figures trickled in, there was a sense of cheer as the sowing operations appeared unaffected.Up to November 11, rabi sowing was completed on 14.6 million hectare area  5.7% lower than normal crop coverage and the gap declined steadily. During the week ending January 20, 2017 sown area under rabi crops was 628.34 lakh hectares, which was 6.07% more than last year's acreage of 592.36 lakh hectares.Agriculture Minister Radhamohan Singh has been issuing statements on how demonetisation had not affected rabi sowing to counter the campaign by opposition leaders on note-ban leading to agrarian distress.Experts have been sceptical about the government's gung-ho approach vis-a-vis the rabi sowing numbers, particularly the comparison with the previous year's acreage which was low because of severe drought. Though the government speaks glowingly about demonetisation not affecting farm activity, the numbers tell a different story. According to the data released by the Agriculture Ministry, rabi sowing in 2013-14 had touched 670 lakh hectares and leading to a bumper harvest of 263 million tonnes.Economist Pronab Sen was categorical. Rabi sowing looks big on the small base of last year, he said. Sen, India's first chief statistician, also said the government could have pushed for implementation of demonetisation in January this year as the seven-week gap would have helped farmers make purchases of seeds and fertilisers for sowing of the winter crop.According to Sen, delaying note ban by a few weeks would have helped farmers sell their kharif crop, prices of which had already fallen drastically on account of good harvest. The wholesale markets, which usually deal in cash, had a tough time lifting the farm produce and the maximum impact was felt by those dealing in fruits and vegetables.Farmers in Punjab and Uttar Pradesh dumped their potato crop on the roads in Ambala and Lucknow, respectively, as they had no cash to pay for transportation of the farm produce to wholesale markets. In Gujarat's Surat, farmers threw vegetables and milk on the streets as they had no access to cash after the government kept out the district central cooperative banks out of the demonetisation process.Prices of fruits and vegetables dropped in wholesale markets post-demonetisation as did the market arrivals. Prices of banana, apple, tomato, cabbage were lower in the range of 4% to 9% in November when compared with the rates in October, making it clear that farmers were affected to some extent.Government analysts say that the prices of tomatoes crashed in December because of glut in the market due to bumper crop. But they admit that it would be difficult to ascertain how much fall was because of the glut and how much due to disruption due to demonetisation.Cash crunch in rural areas had turned acute as the cooperative banks as well as primary cooperative credit societies too were kept out of cash exchange affecting purchase of quality seeds and fertilisers by farmers.There were reports about slowdown in farm activity such as timely spraying of pesticides or application of fertiliser for want of labour. Many farmers were unable to make cash payments to farm labourers who were forced to return to their home towns. Cotton trade nosedived as mills were unable to make cash payments to farmers who supply bales.Quiet acceptanceThere is quiet acceptance of this fact within the government circles as productivity may take a hit this year. Also, farmers have bought far less amount of fertilisers this rabi season when compared with the previous two drought years. One set of estimates peg the sale of fertilisers to be nearly 7.5% lower than the previous year.This means that despite high acreage achieved during the sowing phase may not reflect in the farm output this rabi season. According to a study by Ramesh Chand, Member, Niti Aayog, a 1% increase/decrease in fertiliser use result in 0.1% increase/decrease in agriculture GDP and about 0.14% increase/decrease in crop output.If the current trend in the shortfall in fertiliser consumption continued till the end of the rabi season, it could lead to a more than 1% decline in production. As a result, the rate of growth in farmers income is also expected to dip due to the drop, though Chand still pegs it at 5.8% in real terms for 2016-17.Indias farm sector was looking set for some good times after two consecutive drought years that had slowed down growth and even witnessed a contraction of 0.2% in 2014-15. The normal monsoon had cheered the farmers who had reaped a better kharif harvest and were keen to follow up with even better returns in the winter crop cycle.Ratings agencies had forecast 4% growth for 2016-17 over the previous year which was certainly brighter given the meagre growth in the past couple of years. The sector had barely witnessed growth since 2011. In 2012-13, the farm sector grew by 1.5%, followed by 4.2% in 2013-14, -0.2% in 2014-15 and 1.2% in 2015-16. At a time when things were looking up, the demonetisation decision has pushed the long desired achhe din for agriculture in the realm of uncertainty."

What can be more shameful than befriending those who tried to murder one's father?... They cannot be pardoned.""Kya raajneeti itni gir gayi hai ke kursi ke moh mein iss prakaar ke kaand kiye jaaye (has politics degraded to such an extent that for the love of power such a thing would be done)?""Recalling the incident, Modi said, ""Fed up of attacks by Mulayam Singh as Leader of the Opposition in Vidhan Parishad, Congress got shots fired at him on March 4, 1984 but he scraped through...I want to tell Akhilesh that he should have remembered this incident before sitting in the lap of Congress.""He went on to add, ""Akhileshji ko abhi anubhav kum hain, Congress wale kitne chatur hain inko samajh nahi aata...Mulayam ji ko toh pata tha (Akhilesh has less experience. He does not understand how cunning Congress people are. Mulayam knew about it).""On March 4, 1984, Mulayam Singh's car was fired at by some persons while he was on his way from Etawah to Lucknow and the name of a strong Congress leader had figured in the case.Hitting out at Congress, Modi said the party was running a three-legged race with one leg tied to Bahujan Samaj Party and another to Samajwadi Party.""During the first press conference after the alliance, Akhilesh had attacked Mayawati but when Congress vice president was asked about her, he said he had nothing to say against her,"" the Prime Minister said.Rahul had said, ""I personally respect Mayawati. Though BSP ruled in Uttar Pradesh and made some mistakes, my respect for her is intact"".This had prompted BJP to dub BSP as a hidden partner of Congress-Samajwadi Party.""They cannot win this race as BJP, which is running on two legs, will pip them to the post,"" Modi told the rally today.On the state of affairs in Uttar Pradesh, Modi said the abbreviation of UP may be read as ""up"", but everything is ""down"" in the state.""The only thing up in UP is corruption, law and order, riots, atrocities on women, unemployment, poverty, mortality rate of mother and child, migration...and Akhilesh says 'kaam bolta hai' (work speaks)...it is not kaam but karname (misdeeds) which are speaking for him,"" Modi said.Claiming that the Centre has taken important steps for the welfare of farmers, the Prime Minister said his party has promised in its manifesto that onion and potato will be bought at Minimum Support Price and will not allow the potato growers to die.""BJP manifesto promises loan waiver of small farmers...As an MP from the state, I promise that it will be my responsibility that this promise is fulfilled in the first meeting of the BJP government,"" said Modi, who represents Varanasi constituency in the Lok Sabha.Addressing the gathering in this region having a large number of potato growers, Modi said in the last (Lok Sabha) elections the ""bahu"" (Dimple Yadav) of Samajwadi Party had promised to set up chips-making unit here which did not come through, but she won the poll.""Will you not seek a reply from her or not,"" the Prime Minister asked in his typical question-answer style of establishing direct rapport with the public.""The SP government (in UP) is anti-poor,"" he said, adding that while he himself as no home or vehicle of his own, SP leaders have large fleets of vehicles.""What kind of samajwad (socialism) is this? It is nothing but betrayal of poor. Scams are being reported even in orphanages in UP,"" Modi said.He contended that central assistance for foodgrains was not reaching the poor in UP as the state government was not interested in accepting it.He also took a dig at Rahul Gandhi saying, ""the Congress leader seeking vote from you is not aware that potato is grown in the field and not in factory...He (Rahul) took out a kisan yatra and talked about setting up potato factory.""Claiming that people of the country have hailed note ban, he said this is proved by BJP's victories in Panchayat polls in Odisha, Municipal elections in Chandigarh and Gujarat and Vidhan Parishad poll in UP.Congratulating ISRO scientists, he said they have hit a century by launching a record 104 satellites at one go.Modi also cited the decision of his government to slash prices for coronary stents for heart patients.""The stents will be sold at Rs 8,000 against Rs 45,000 earlier. Congress had failed to revise the prices for years,"" he said.Modi said opposition played all types of games in the last three months raking up issues like demonetisation and surgical strike.Referring to anomalies in recruitments in UP, Modi said police recruitment in Uttar Pradesh is driven by caste-based decisions.""We have removed interview requirement from the recruitment process in Class III and Class IV categories in central government. Around one lakh people were recruited in Railways without an interview,"" he said.There are plans for recruitment in BSF and CISF which will be done in a fair and honest manner to give jobs to the deserving candidates, Modi added.Promising to continue the fight against black money and corruption, he appealed to people of Kannuj to vote for BJP on February 19 in the third phase of polling."

Union agriculture ministry's 'District-wise Estimation of Production and Area of Fruits, Vegetables and Crops in India' has revealed that Banaskantha has produced 17.10 lakh MT of potatoes, which is 9% of the total production in the country. Gujarat is followed by Agra which has produced 15.84 lakh MT of potatoes. Recently, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had lauded the farmers of Deesa for their potato yield and their progressive agricultural practices.The McAloo Tikki burger, French fries, and potato wedges  among the most beloved fast food items  all contain the delicious 'grown in Gujarat' element. Potatoes for these menu toppers come from farms of Deesa of Banaskantha district. Potatoes are sourced from farmers by McCain Foods , a Canadian multi-national. Apart from McCain, a soft drink company and a local potato chip giant have contract farming deals for potatoes in the region, which have given high returns to the farmers.According to the data, the area of sowing was the highest in Muzaffarpur in Bihar, while Banaskantha was ranked third in the country on this count with a sowing area of 52,800 hectares.In Muzaffarpur, sowing took up 85,500 hectares. However, when it comes to production, Banaskantha was leading the chart.Rajesh Shah, a farmer in Deesa, said: ""We have adapted drip irrigation and with the availability of water, the per hectare productivity has increased."" He said five years ago, the yield was around 20 tonnes per hectare. ""But for the past two years, it has increased to over 28 tonnes per hectare."" Ashish Guru , the president of the Gujarat Cold Storage Association , said: ""Climate in Banskantha is conducive to growing the crop. Besides, farmers here are open to changes."" He said that the district has perhaps the highest number of drip-irrigation users. ""This has not only improved the yield has also improved the quality of the crop,"" he saidThe cold storage capacity in Gujarat was boosted by approximately 6.25 lakh tonnes (1.25 crore bags of 50kg each). Currently, the capacity is 22.50 lakh tonnes. This also spurred the production of potatoes."

Interestingly, unlike in the jallikattu agitation held in Marina, leaders of various political parties have started flocking to the venue after the tenth day, perhaps after testing the waters. MDMK general secretary Vaiko, leaders of People's Welfare Front and TNCC chief S Thirunavukarasar were among those who called on the protesters on Tuesday expressing their concern at the possible impact of the project on the environment.As per the resolutions passed at the protest committee meeting on Monday, protesters held black flags in their hands on Tuesday at Neduvasal. Villagers from Neduvasal West and Aandavarayapuram joined the protest along with hundreds of farmers, students and youths who came from various districts. Meanwhile, residents of 70 surrounding villages including Neduvasal (East and West), Karukakuruchi, Kottaikadu, Vadakadu, Aandavarayapuram, Pullanviduthi and Vaanakkankadu hoisted black flag atop their houses to showcase their resistance. As many as 500 members from the jamath committee in Pudukkottai also expressed their solidarity with the protesters by staying put for a whole day at the venue.Address the gathering, MDMK general secretary Vaiko said that development of the country at the cost of Tamil Nadu was not acceptable and people would protest against the hydrocarbon project. ""Nigeria bore the brunt of hydrocarbon and people opposed it after sensing catastrophe. Now it's our turn. If the union government wants the project, they may have it in Gujarat. I urge chief minister Edapadi K Palanisamy to take strong exception to the project"", Vaiko added.Leaders of People's Welfare Front (PWF) Thol Thirumavalavan, G Ramakrishnan and R Mutharasan, Tamil Nadu Congress Committee president S Thirunavukarasar and director V Gowthaman who also addressed the gathering said that the Centre should not compel farmers to accept the project. Otherwise they warned of holding a statewide protest. While addressing a protest organized by PWF at Alangudi in Pudukkottai district, the leaders asked the union government to respect the people's feelings and revoke the project.Meanwhile, college students from Mannar Sarfoji in Thanjavur skipped their classes and staged a demonstration raising slogans against the hydrocarbon project. As usual, Neduvasal villagers prepared and served tasty sambar rice with potato curry, roasted green chilli and pickle to the protesters. As announced, traders will down their shutters across the district on Wednesday in support of the ongoing protest."

So, we dumped about 500 quintals of potatoes on the main chowk in Kartarpur on the Jalandhar-Amritsar National Highway, said Harmeet Singh Kadian, State president of the Bhartiya Kisan Union.The trouble began in November when farmers from Bihar, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Gujarat cancelled their orders for potato seeds from Punjab because demonetisation ensured they could not pay for it.Usually, Punjab farmers sell around 200 quintals of potato seed at the rate of `3,000 per quintal. This time, the losses are estimated at Rs 1,500 crore. Many farmers, who waited for the prices to stabilise, left their crops standing in the field. But then the new crop came in February, adding to the standing stock and a lot of unsold potatoes already kept in cold storage.Post-demonetisation and the coming of the new crop, there has been a crash in potato prices. Now, potatoes are selling at Rs 1.50 to Rs 2 per kg compared to Rs 8 to Rs 10 per kg earlier, said J S Sangha, Jalandhar Potato Growers Association general secretary.Farmers should dump the potato outside banks if the government doesnt support them in anyway. The crop dumped yesterday was just a trailer. We will dump the whole crop across the State, as storing it in cold storage costs us much more.In an attempt to resolve the crisis, the Punjab government is now trying to export the crop to Russia and Iran."

BSP chief Mayawati during an election rally.Time: 12.45 pmPlace: Inter College ground, Jagatpur, VaranasiMayawatis rally was scheduled for 1 pm, but her audience had started to come in from 10 am. Thousands of them, mostly from the eight assembly segments that make up the Prime Ministers Lok Sabha constituency, all voting in the final phase of the elections on March 8.They came on three wheelers, buses and tempos, and filled the venue in a slow, orderly fashion. Many said they were given food and transport by local village leaders.The election rallies of the BSP leader are like no other in Uttar Pradesh. They are attended by those at the very bottom of the caste and economic pyramid, and are filled with vivid images of the inequalities that lie at the heart of her Dalit politics. Of the 25,000-plus people  including over 8,000 women  at Saturdays rally, perhaps not even a hundred could be called middle class or upper class.The women were in brightly coloured synthetic saris  mostly made in Surat  paired with plastic or synthetic rubber shoes, sandals or chappals. All, old and young, wore metal jewellery with a fake silver or gold shine. Some, both men and women, munched on chana or moongfali in 50-paise packets, or a fried mixture that cost Re 1. There was drinking water  not clean  in loose plastic bags, and a vendor sold colourful icecream of a brand called Madhu. There were no public toilets anywhere near the venue.Over an hour past the scheduled time, there is no sign of Behen Kumari Mayawati. But there are no complaints, no restlessness, not even a murmur in the huge crowd. From the stage, slogans reverberate: Chalo chalein sarkar banayein, haathi wala button dabayein, BSP ki kya pehchaan, neela jhanda, haathi nishaan.Ravita (on right) at Mayawatis rally. (Express photo) Ravita (on right) at Mayawatis rally. (Express photo)It is 30 degrees, and directly in the sun sits Ravita Kumari, a 23-year-old mother of two children. She has come to listen to Mayawati with Jeevati Devi, Nirmala and Phoolmati from Jagdishpur. He husband Chhotelal, she says, has studied computtery, and has a mobile shop.Asked if she didnt feel warm in her synthetic sari, Ravita said, Hum chhoti jaat hain, suti (cotton) bahut mehenga hai.How much money does your husband give you every month?Kuchho nahin (Nothing). Rs 5 for Lifebuoy soap, a small tikiya. I use Clinic shampoo once a year. I spend Rs 2 on sindoor every month. The gold bangles Ravita wears are for Rs 70, her ring costs Rs 10, her sari Rs 150. The family has a cow, she says, which gives three litres of milk every day. But the cow eats a lot  khaati bahut hai. The family buys 500 kilos or more of bhusa every year for her.Ravitas monthly household budget is Rs 500  thats all that they have left after paying her elder sons Rs-600 school fees. I dont have Ujjawala gas (the Prime Ministers ambitious scheme to provide LPG connections to BPL households) or a toilet at home. Dont ask me why. Our village elders never keep our name in the list (for cooking gas connections). If Mayawatis government comes, we will have more money, she says.As of now, Ravitas ration card gets her 8 kg of rice and 12 kg of wheat for free, and her husband manages another 25 kg of chaawal every month. In our colony, there is no voltage, the fan hardly moves, and bulbs are like dots of light. My biceps pain because I have to draw groundwater daily. The water pump does not work properly, and the thakur in our village doesnt allow us to enter his farm to get water.(Express photo) (Express photo)There are hundreds of women like her at the rally venue, Ravita says. Except old women, all of them work on the thakurs farm, but get no money. The thakur only gives them 6 kilos of wheat every day. Those who work on potato farms are allowed to take a few kilos home. But these are green potatoes, and not of good quality. Landowners never pay us cash.Suddenly, Ravita is distracted. A chopper has appeared in the sky. The crowd rises as one. Ravita is with them, clapping.Mayawati climbs on to the stage. Ravitas eyes are moist, her face is glowing with joy. Kaisi hai? Achchi hai na? she asks.Mayawati ignores the BSP leaders on the stage and starts reading her long speech. Two parties are holding roadshows in Varanasi to occupy the second and third places in this election, she says. Narendra Modi can pray at as many temples as he likes, but he is not going to get results. This is because, she says, the BJP will never be united while I have united the Dalits, and Muslims have added to their heft.Have you got even one rupee in your accounts? Did you get a job after Modi became PM? Has even a rupee of farmers debt been removed so far? Its time to send Narendra Modi back to Gujarat, she says to huge applause.Modi ne chamchon (cronies) ko khadaa kar phoolon ki varsha karaai. He is not going to get the blessings of even his cronies. They dont show it, but they are very unhappy with him. Modis party is daagi-baagion ki party. Many men in the crowd laugh heartily.Mayawati then goes back many years, and starts to read out the history of V P Singhs government, and how the BJP, pursuing its anti-Mandal politics, had forced him to resign. Ravita and Jeevati have begun to doze, and some women start to leave. Other women in blue saris, lathis in hand, tell them to remain seated. They follow the order.On the stage, Mayawati says she has come to know from reliable sources that if the BJP comes to power, it will abolish reservation. Akhilesh Yadav is no better, she says  he is Modis nephew, because Modi considers Mulayam Singh Yadav his elder brother. The chief minister is Sa-pa (Samajwadi Party) ka babua, who doesnt know what he is talking. Now, SP ke babua ko bhabhi (Dimple Yadav) bhi nahin bachaa sakti.As Mayawatis chopper leaves, the crowd starts to move out as it had come in  in a slow, orderly fashion. Ravita comes running to this correspondent. Are you going to get me Ujjawala gas? she asks.And then, coming closer, says, Mere pati ko naukri dilwaye, mujhe gas nahin chahiye.For all the latest Elections News, download Indian Express App"

Giving an example, he said in the sale of potato chips, the farmer is ignored whereas being the grower of the crop, he should be an important factor in this chain.The state government is following the concept of peri-urban agriculture, as he had seen in Beijing, where farmers' output meets the needs of adjoining cities.""Agricultural products, being perishable, have a short life. Therefore, the farmers must cultivate need based crops in areas adjoining cities. Emphasis is being laid on bringing 25 per cent of the cultivable area under horticulture. Apart from a modern vegetable mandi, a flower mandi is also being developed,"" he added.The minister said in milk production, Haryana is next to Gujarat and Punjab. ""But as Haryana has potential to do better, it can excel in this field by promoting dairy farming as a profession and adopting some new means,"" he said.Referring to organic farming, he cited the example of Sikkim which is now an 'Organic State' and has been honoured by the Prime Minister.Dhankar said the 400 gaushalas in Haryana can contribute towards promotion of organic farming.The concept of climate-smart agriculture or risk agriculture has already been adopted in some countries to meet the challenge posed by climate change. For instance, Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana is an initiative to meet such challenges, he added.To a question, he said the state government is keen to set up a processing unit for horticulture crops and a mandi of frozen products to facilitate the sale of agri products in off season."

In addition to that, the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbhandak Committee (SGPC) has decided to directly purchase potatoes from the farmers.Khuswant Singh, (45), of Moosapur village in Jalandhar, committed suicide after he suffered a loss in his potato crop, and was in debt of Rs 20 lakh, including cultivating his crop on leased land. The Punjab government has also instructed the education department that schools should directly buy potatoes from farmers at Rs 5 per kg for the mid-day meal scheme in government schools across the state to boost their sales.The meeting in this regard was held between BKU representatives and Kahan Singh Pannu, Managing Director of PAIC, in which all the details were given to farmer leaders. Corporation officials are in talks with Russia, Iran and Sri Lanka to finalise the deal soon, in a bid to resolve the crisis. Meanwhile, Tamil Nadu has agreed to the Punjab Governments request to keep five lakh bags of potatoes in its cold storage.Many farmers, who waited for the prices to stabilise, left their crops standing in the field. However, the new crop came in February, adding to the standing stock and a lot of unsold potatoes already kept in cold storage.The State government has sent the case to the Election Commission of India to sanction Rs 5 crore so that it could buy the first lot of potatoes after the mode of conduct is in place.All the Deputy Commissioners in the State have been directed to buy the crop directly from farmers at Rs 500 and send it to prison departments and schools for the mid-day meal scheme.Meanwhile, Chief Secretary of SGPC Harcharan Singh said, we would be buying the potatoes directly from the farmers as we have told the managers of the gurdwaras and other institutions under the SGPC control to do the same. Presently our institutions are buying potatoes from the open market at Rs 8 per kg on an average. I have also discussed this matter with Punjab Agro Industries Corporation officials.Unable to sell their produce, angry farmers in the Doaba region had on Wednesday dumped 500 quintals of potato on the road, causing a traffic jam on the Jalandhar-Amritsar National Highway.The trouble began in November when farmers from Bihar, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Gujarat cancelled their orders for potato seeds from Punjab because demonetisation had greatly affected them."

(PTI Photo) Representational Image. (PTI Photo)This has been a terrible year for potato farmers, with prices everywhere  from Agra and Farrukhabad in Uttar Pradesh to Burdwan in West Bengal  crashing to well below Rs 4 per kg levels. But about 10,000 growers in West Bengal have managed to realise an extra Rs 5 or so per kg, by supplying to the global snack and beverage giant PepsiCo under a contract farming initiative.Watch What Else Is Making NewsAt current rates of Rs 3.40-3.80 per kg for normal potatoes, farmers are grossing Rs 170-190 from every 50-kg sack that doesnt even cover production costs. However, some of us who have entered into collaborative farming with PepsiCo are being paid Rs 8.40 per kg. That works out to an extra Rs 230-250, compared to what we would have got by selling a sack of regular potatoes, points out Shantinath Nandi.This four-bigha (one acre) farmer from Anandapur village in Hooghly districts Goghat block under Arambag subdivision has been growing process-grade potatoes for PepsiCo for the last six years. He produces between 90 and 110 sacks of the tuber from each bigha, which gives Rs 42,000 at Rs 8.40 per kg. After deducting costs of Rs 22,000-25,000, it leaves a profit of Rs 17,000-20,000 per bigha or Rs 170-200 a sack. Had Nandi been growing ordinary table-grade potatoes, his total revenue itself would have been just Rs 170-190, not enough to take care of even cultivation costs of over Rs 200 per sack or Rs 4 per kg.The process-grade potato varieties such as Atlantic, FC3 and FC5, which PepsiCo is promoting, contain 20 per cent dry matter and 80 per cent water. Table varieties have about 85 per cent water. The lower dry matter content makes them less suitable for processing, as the extra water adds to dehydration and energy costs. Normal potatoes also have higher accumulation of reducing sugars. These, when fried, are subjected to certain enzymatic reactions, leading to their blackening. The resultant chips or fries tend to acquire a dark brownish colour, whereas ideally they should possess a light yellow hue.Shantinath Nandi, Asim Chowdhury and other farmers at Anandapur are among the many who have taken to cultivating process-grade potatoes for PepsiCo, under an arrangement where the Indian subsidiary of the American multinational undertakes to purchase their entire produce at a fixed price announced a month before planting.All they have to do is to grow the potatoes for us, says Jaideep Bhatia, director-agro at PepsiCo India.The maker of Lays and Uncle Chipps potato chips brands does contract cultivation  collaborative farming is the term it prefers to use  in Punjab, West Bengal, Maharashtra, Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh. In West Bengal, its direct farm sourcing operations are spread across nine districts: Hooghly, Howrah, Burdwan, West Midnapore, Birbhum, Bankura, Jalpaiguri, Cooch Behar and Alipurduar.In 2010, our procurement was 39,998 tonnes from West Bengal. This year, we will do 72,250 tonnes. This programme is a big success for us, claims Bhatia. He adds that PepsiCo not only provides farmers with disease-free true potato seeds produced from its laboratory in Punjab, but also tractor-drawn planters and other equipment, crop protection and extension services, cold storage and insurance facilitation.Ive been working with this company for the last 5-6 years and there is certainly increased interest among growers for this kind of cultivation, notes Chandicharan Mondal, a potato aggregator, who has brought 200-odd farmers under PepsiCos programme.But the quantities being procured by PepsiCo and other food processing majors are only a fraction of the 10 million tonnes annual potato production of West Bengal alone. While contract cultivation of processing-grade potatoes is useful, there are limits to how much these can replace the normal aloo used in day-to-day meals and table preparations. And to that extent, the woes of growers cannot be wished away.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

The proposed systems biggest advantage is that it can track actual purchases by the final buyer.Buoyed by its landslide win in the recent Uttar Pradesh assembly elections, the Narendra Modi government has decided to fast-track the implementation of the direct benefit transfer (DBT) system for payment of fertiliser subsidy to farmers.From the coming kharif season, beginning June, the Rs 70,000-crore fertiliser subsidy budgeted for 2017-18 will be disbursed to companies based on actual sales to farmers captured on point-of-sale (POS) machines installed at nearly two lakh retail points across India.This would be a significant change from the current system, where firms are paid the subsidy on receipt of their fertiliser at the railhead point or any approved godown of a district. Prior to this, till October 2012, they were getting the subsidy on despatch of material from their respective factories.From kharif 2017 onwards, we are moving to disbursal of subsidy only after sale to the farmer takes place. The farmers identity will be verified through Aadhaar-based biometric authentication, voter ID or Kisan Credit Card. The sale transaction as well as buyer details would be captured in the POS machine installed at the retailers end and connected with a central server, a Department of Fertilisers official told The Indian Express.The proposed subsidy-post-sale system  as opposed to after receipt-at-district or despatch-from-plant  is already being implemented as a pilot scheme in 17 districts. They include UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanaths home district of Gorakhpur; Kishanganj and Begusarai (Bihar); Dhanbad (Jharkhand); Hoshangabad (Madhya Pradesh); Pali (Rajasthan); Nashik and Raigad (Maharashtra); Narmada (Gujarat); Krishna and West Godavari (Andhra Pradesh); Ranga Reddy (Telangana); Tumkur (Karnataka); Thrissur (Kerala); Karnal and Kurukshetra (Haryana); and, Una (Himachal Pradesh).We will have a nationwide roll-out of this system from June 1. Fertiliser companies have been given a deadline of May 31 for procurement and installation of POS machines at all the 1.98 lakh-odd registered outlets selling to farmers. All transactions thereafter will have to be done through POS machines in order to be able to claim subsidy, the official said.The proposed systems biggest advantage is that it can track actual purchases by the final buyer. A farmer growing wheat or paddy may apply up to three 50-kg bags of urea, one bag of di-ammonium phosphate (DAP) and half-a-bag of muriate of potash (MOP) per acre. That requirement could be more  say, three bags urea and 1.5 bags each of DAP and MOP per acre  for potato and sugarcane.But under the new system, it is possible to record transactions at individual farmer-level. If someone is buying 200 bags of urea, that person is more likely to be a plywood or particle board manufacturer than a farmer. Either way, he isnt deserving of subsidy.Neem-coating has already helped check illegal diversion of a highly-subsidised fertiliser towards non-agricultural use. The linking of subsidy payment to data generated at retail sale point leaves virtually no scope for diversion that is always possible from the godown or rail rake point, the official said. Nor can fertilisers be smuggled from border areas to Bangladesh or Nepal, since there will be no POS machines there for recording sales and claiming subsidy.The fertiliser industry has cautiously welcomed the proposed reform. I want this to succeed, as it is an important first step that should culminate in the subsidy being transferred directly to farmers bank accounts, which is what DBT is ultimately about, said Suresh Krishnan, managing director, Zuari Global Ltd, a leading urea and phosphatic fertiliser marketer.The industrys main apprehension is on the preparedness of retailers to accurately record not just farmers details and quantities purchased, but also the company/unit supplying the material in each case. The fact that fertiliser sales are also concentrated over just few months (June-August and October-December) of the year only complicates matters further. Add to this the possibility of the POS device not working due to network connectivity or signal strength problems, it could be a recipe for chaos during the peak agricultural season.We are also concerned over timely subsidy payment. As it is, the industry is owed Rs 40,000 crore of unpaid subsidy bills carried forward each year, entailing an annual interest outgo of Rs 4,000 crore for which there is no reimbursement. If payment of subsidy will now happen only after actual sale of material to the farmer, it will add to our working capital costs, said Satish Chander, director-general, Fertiliser Association of India.Under the proposed system, payment of subsidy is to be based on weekly settlement of claims from actual sales data captured on POS machines. The industry will be happy if it really happens that way. We have supported this scheme, so much so that the entire cost of procuring and installing the two lakh POS devices (about Rs 400 crore) is being borne by us. We only want that it should lead to the implementation of DBT in the true sense of the subsidy going directly to the farmers, said Chander.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

However, the situation might change, if the strike continues, warn experts.As many as three lakh lorries in the State went off the roads from Thursday pressing for their demands which include withdrawal of the Centres order increasing the third-party insurance and high toll tax collection on State highways. Though the lorry owners association has exempted essential services like milk, medicines, water and petrol from the purview of the stir, some sections of petrol tank operators have joined the stir across the State on Saturday.""Of the total 1,500 petrol tankers, only 500 were operated on the third day of the stir. Already the petroleum sales have dipped by 60 per cent from Monday, the petrol tankers association has also decided to join the stir in a full-fledged manner. If this happens, the petroleum users across the State might face a serious problem, said Andhra Pradesh Federation of Petroleum Dealers (APFPD) president R Gopala Krishna.Speaking to Express, Rythu Bazar estate officer M Ramesh Babu said that indefinite lorry strike has no impact on the vegetable prices. Most of the vegetables are procured from the nearby villages across the city through auto rickshaws and APSRTC buses. Moreover, the vegetable prices are slashed by Rs 5 on each variety as this is the harvesting season for all the horticulture crops, he said.Veggies turn dearer as arrivals declineThe prices of vegetables also remained stable in Visakhapatnam, Guntur and Rajamahendravaram, but the situation was different in Kurnool. The strike has created artificial scarcity of essential commodities, especially vegetables and their prices are going skyward.As Kurnool city depends on vegetable imports from places like Delhi, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Telangana and other places, the supply constraints due to lorry strike burnt holes in the pockets of consumers.Kurnool imports potato and ginger from Delhi, Agra, Gujarat and nearly 100 tonnes arrives every day to the local markets. Because of strike, potato prices have doubled from Rs 15 to Rs 30 per kg, while ginger too saw similar price hike from Rs 25 to Rs 50 per kg. Tomatoes which were regular imports from Kadapa, Chittoor and Mahabubnagar districts also had its prices doubled from Rs 15 per kg."

(Source: Express photo by Vishal Srivastav)KEEPING A key poll promise of the BJP, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, at the first meeting of his cabinet on Tuesday, announced his governments decision to waive loans of Rs 36,359 crore taken by about 94 lakh small and marginal farmers in the state. The waiver amount includes Rs 5,630 crore loans of 7 lakh farmers whose accounts were declared non-performing assets (NPAs) by banks. In its Lok Kalyan Sankalp document 2017 for the assembly elections, the BJP had promised to waive crop loans of small and marginal farmers. During the poll campaign, Prime Minister Narendra Modi too had promised loan waiver of farmers if his party were to come to power in the state.According to government records, out of 2.30 crore farmers in the state, 1.85 crore are marginal and 0.30 crore are small farmers. The cabinet on Tuesday decided to waive outstanding crop loans adding up to Rs 30,729 crore taken by about 86.68 lakh small and marginal farmers till March 31, 2016, up to a maximum limit of Rs 1 lakh per farmer. In addition, the state government will also settle the dues of 7 lakh farmers with NPAs under a one time settlement scheme.All farmers with land holdings of less than one hectare, or 2.5 acres, will be considered marginal farmers, while those with land holdings of 1-2 hectares will be considered small farmers. The farmers were unable to repay the loans due to crop failure caused by hailstorm, drought and floods. Cabinet Minister Siddharth Nath Singh said the state government would bear the cost of the loan waiver and no financial support would be sought from the Centre. He said the state would raise the funds through the Kisan Raahat Bond.Finance Minister Rajesh Agrawal said farmers who have paid their loans will not benefit from the scheme. An eight-member committee, under the chairmanship of the chief secretary, has been set up to finalise the modalities of the scheme. Meanwhile, the cabinet also decided that illegal slaughterhouses would not be allowed to operate. Singh said the cabinet was informed that 26 such slaughterhouses had been shut down so far. The cabinet also approved the proposal regarding formation of anti-Romeo squads at police stations.The government also decided to draft a new industrial policy to increase investment in the state. A group of ministers led by Deputy Chief Minister Dinesh Sharma will visit several states like Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Maharahstra to study their industrial policies. Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya will head another committee of ministers to look into illegal mining. The committee is expected to hand in its report within a week.With the state recording a bumper wheat crop, the cabinet decided to open 5,000 wheat procurement centres across the state. While about 40 lakh metric tonnes of wheat will be procured in the first stage, the total target will be about 80 lakh metric tonnes. Along with the minimum support price (MSP) of Rs 1,625, farmers will be paid Rs 10 per quintal for transportation and loading. The cabinet also decided to set up a three-member committee to look into the steps that need to be taken to provide relief to potato farmers.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

PTI PhotoDelivering on BJP's poll promise to small and marginal farmers, the Yogi Adityanath cabinet today decided to waive their crop loans up to Rs 1 lakh, totalling a staggering Rs 36,359 crore, at its very first meeting.The move will benefit over 2.15 crore farmers, besides 7 lakh others who had secured loans which turned into non- performing assets (NPAs).The Yogi Adityanath cabinet decided to float Kisan Rahat Bonds for raising Rs 36,359 crore required for waiving loans of small and marginal farmers who form 92.5 per cent of the total 2.30 lakh farmers in the state.The decision comes a fortnight after Adityanath took over the reins of the state on March 19 after BJP and its allies stormed to power in the 403-member Assembly capturing 325 seats, an over three-fourth majority.Briefing mediapersons after a 90-minute meeting of the cabinet, senior minister Siddharth Nath Singh and Srikant Sharma said Rs 30,729 crore was required for waiving loans of small and marginal farmers.Besides, there were about 7 lakh other farmers who had taken loans which turned into non-performing assets ((NPAs). In order to bring them back into the mainstream, their outstanding dues of Rs 5,630 crore have also been written off.The loan waiver promise was made by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and state party president Keshav Prasad Maurya and it is the duty of the government to fulfil the promise made in BJP's 'sankalp patra' (manifesto) and the Yogi government was moving ahead in this direction, the two ministers said.In the past, farmers in the state had suffered because of successive drought and hailstorm.Singh said Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act mandated that no state can allow its fiscal deficit to grow beyond three per cent of its GDP. Hence, funds for meeting the expenditure on loan waiver would be raised through Kisan Rahat Bonds.Taking into account the problems faced by potato growers, who face immense hardship in case of bumper crops, the cabinet decided to set up a three-member committe headed by Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya to see how they can get adequate remuneration for their produce.The ministers said the committee will also look at how to help the potato growers.The ministers said the cabinet also decided to raise by Rs 10 per quintal the minimum support price for wheat procurement as loading and unloading charges. The MSP for wheat it Rs 1,680 per quintal.A target of 80 lakh metric tonnes of wheat procurement has been fixed for this season and, in the first phase, half of it will be procured, they said. The ministers said instructions have been issued to ensure direct procurement from farmers and that they should not be harassed.In order to check illegal mining, the cabinet decided to constitute a group of ministers. The GoM headed by Maurya will give its report in a week.The ministers said the cabinet also took up the issue of investments in UP for setting up industries so the youth get better employment opportunities in the state itself.For this, a five-member GoM headed by another Deputy Chief Minister Dinesh Sharma has been constituted. It would visit other states and study their industrial policies.The GoM will study the policies of BJP-ruled states like Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh among others for preparing an industrial policy for UP for enhanced investment through a single window system."

They have lodged a complaint at the Deccan Gymkhana police station and even moved the consumer forum.Kaustubh Dighe and Mohit Gaurav (both 22) study law at a city-based college. Kaustubh belongs to Vadodara, Gujarat, while Mohit is from Uttar Pradesh. A peeved Kaustubh told Pune Mirror, ""As I am a Gujarati Brahmin, I do not eat non-veg food. I never expected this kind of an experience at such a prominent restaurant, that too, during Navaratra, I was served a non-veg dish with pork. In fact, the restaurant served us the bill as well for the dish, which we hadn't even ordered. Both of us are law students, so we wanted to take legal recourse. We contacted student activist Pranay Ajmera and he suggested that we approach the consumer forum and file a complaint."" Both filed a complaint with the consumer forum on Monday.According to the police complaint, ""They went to the German Bakery Wunderbar on March 30 (Thursday). They ordered veg lasagna and hot chocolate for dinner, but were served a German Potato and Bacon Salad instead, by the restaurant's waiter. After having a bite, Dighe realised that the dish was not vegetarian. Soon after, a waiter came to their table again and served their original order. When they asked the waiter about the previous dish, he replied that it was non-veg and that they were served the wrong dish.""Shocked, they dialled 100 and called the police. ""The police took us to the Deccan police station and we lodged a complaint. The cops also called the restaurant manager and asked him to clarify the matter,"" Kaustubh said. Friend Mohit added, ""When we asked the manager, Gaurav Baraskar, about the issue, he misbehaved with us and replied arrogantly. That's when we called the police. When we asked Baraskar to give us a written apology, all he wrote was that the order was wrongly served.""When Mirror contacted Gaurav Baraskar, he said, ""I was not present in the restaurant at that time. A new waiter had served them a non-veg dish by mistake. The police called me and I gave them my statement."" According to the Deccan police, ""The manager apologised in front of us, but both the complainants said they will file a complaint to the consumer forum as well.""But, the owner of the restaurant, Vijay Shewale , who also happens to be a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) corporator, dismissed the charges, saying, ""This cannot happen in the restaurant. Youths often make such allegations if they don't want to pay the bill. This might also be the Opposition's ploy to malign my image.""The German Bakery Wunderbar had opened in December 2014. The cafe that also has a bar, serves health food and continental snacks."
593ba9007be9e0066b6f608a,Rahul farmer salvo,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170406/jsp/nation/story_144836.jsp,2017-04-06,"New Delhi, April 5: Rahul Gandhi today asked the BJP ""not to play politics with farmers"" by waiving loans in Uttar Pradesh alone as agrarian distress was a national crisis and the Centre should come up with a ""national"" response. Although Rahul described the Uttar Pradesh government's decision as a ""step in the right direction"", he alleged inaction by the Narendra Modi government by tweeting: ""I am happy the BJP has finally been forced to see reason. But let's not play politics with our farmers who are suffering across the country."" Contending that the Congress has always supported loan waivers for farmers in distress, Rahul said in another tweet: ""The Central Government must have a national response to the widespread distress and not discriminate amongst states."" In the context of Uttar Pradesh too, he said the relief was only ""partial"". The waivers apply to harvest loans up to Rs 1 lakh. Rahul had petitioned Prime Minister Modi seeking loan waivers for farmers of Uttar Pradesh and Punjab before the recent elections in these states. Although he has often demanded a national policy to provide such financial relief, the demand letters he submitted to the government were from the farmers of Uttar Pradesh and Punjab. The Uttar Pradesh decision is bound to have repercussions and the Congress appears to have fuelled the discontent with Rahul's response. Sharad Pawar has criticised the selective relief and exhorted the farmers of Maharashtra to intensify their agitation and ""make the life of the government miserable"". Devendra Fadnavis, the chief minister of Maharashtra which has witnessed the maximum number of suicides in recent times, was compelled to issue a statement that his BJP-led government was examining the issue of loan waivers. The Congress has also pointed to the drought in the southern states and asked the Centre not to address the agrarian crisis according to pressures of political exigencies. Rahul had recently joined the farmers of Tamil Nadu who have been protesting at Delhi's Jantar Mantar for more than 20 days. The Congress is also planning to raise the issues of farmers in Gujarat, which goes to the polls later this year. The Prime Minister had made a public commitment to waive loans of farmers in Uttar Pradesh and, at the state's first cabinet meeting yesterday, the promise has been partially fulfilled. The Yogi Adityanath government decided to waive loans worth Rs 30,700 crore while the total outstanding debt of farmers is Rs 92,241 crore. In Congress-ruled Punjab, an expert committee has been set up to prepare a proposal. The Congress, aware that Punjab's finances are in a mess, expects the Centre to step in. Chief minister Amarinder Singh has already met the Prime Minister seeking assistance for fulfilling the loan-waiver promise. Congress spokesperson Rajeev Gowda said the agrarian distress was the outcome of the policies of the Centre and a national scheme was needed to ameliorate the farmers' plight. Congress communications chief Randeep Surjewala described the Uttar Pradesh government's decision as a ""mirage"" that skipped the need for addressing the real crisis. ""There are 2.33 crore farmers in UP, of which 2.15 crore are marginal farmers. The proposal will cover barely 86 lakh farmers. The government should have waived the total debt, including term loans. Nothing was done for sugarcane and potato farmers,"" Surjewala said."

In the last 15 days, prices of many vegetables have more than doubled barring that of potato and onion.In retail markets and shops in Satellite area, except potatoes and onions, no other vegetable is available at rates below Rs 50 per kg. While in Agriculture Produce Market Committee, (APMC), Ahmedabad, brinjal is selling somewhere between Rs8-Rs16 per kg in wholesale, the same is selling in retail at Rs 60 per kg in city localities.The prices of vegetables at APMC have gone up by around 15%, while in retail the prices have almost doubled. Officials from APMC said that all vegetables, except potatoes and onions, are in short supply.According to Gujarat agriculture department, the sowing of vegetables, which was normally done across 1.24 lakh hectares was done only across 82,000 hectares. The department however claims that the sowing of vegetable was around 9,000 hectares more than that in last year.Prices of several vegetables had crossed the Rs 100 mark in retail market in 2016, but had eased after demonetization.Agriculture minister, Chiman Sapariya, however, said, ""The shortfall in sowing has no relation with demonetization. The sowing was delayed because there was less rainfall in 2016, and hence farmers moved away from vegetable to crops that needed less water.""""We hope that prices will likely come down within the next fortnight when the summer crop starts to arrive. The prices are generally on the higher side during this period,"" said D M Patel, secretary, APMC, Ahmedabad.Patel said, ""During demonetization, bulk buyers were away from the market. As a result, farmers were forced to sell their produce at throwaway prices. But now the market has stabilized.""APMC officials said that supply of potato to the APMC each day was 370 kg more than what is normal at this time of the year, and the supply of onion is 415 kg more than expected, daily."

On Tuesday the government decided to purvchase potatoes directly from farmers in a bid to cut wastage and provide maximum monetary benefit. UP is the largest producer of potato in the country and Agra was the largest potato producing district in the country for many years till Gujarats Banaskantha displaced it this year.One of the biggest problems faced by the agriculture sector is large-scale losses of crops after the harvesting period. Farmers toil in the rain and sun only to see their hard work being wasted due to shortage of storage facilities across the country. As per a 2015 study commissioned by the ministry of food processing, quantitative harvest and post-harvest losses of fruits and vegetables ranges between 6.70% to 15.88% for fruits and from 4.58% to 12.44% in vegetables. The reasons range from sorting/grading and packaging to transportation and storage channels.In a first, UP govt to purchase potatoes from farmers directly https://t.co/U941AArind  TOI Lucknow News (@TOILucknow) April 12, 2017As per data available from parliament, India has 32 million cold stores (Bulk & distribution hubs) but requires additional 3 million more. As far as reefer trucks are concerned, India needs around 62,000 units compared to the current number of less than 10,000. If we look at the larger picture, almost 8679 tonnes of food grain was damaged across FCI godowns in 2016-17 as compared to 3115 tonnes for the previous year of 2015-16.

When a food festival is held at Thekkeppuram, there is no question of authenticity as this is where most of Kozhikodes traditional cuisine is originated.The Thekkeppuram Food Fest 2017 that began at the M.S. Aboo Haji Hall on Pallikkandi Road at Kallai on Wednesday is a coming together of expert cooks from 40 residents associations in the region that spreads between Valiyangadi and Kothi Bridge. Here we find mostly home-makers coming up with authentic homely recipes to tease the palates of food buffs in the city.Traditional snacks such as kadukka nirachathu, meen pathiri, irachi pathiri, jeeraka pathiri, unnakkaya, kumbilappam, undaputtu, chemmeen pidi, chattippathiri, chippiyappam, athishaya pathiri, chemmeen meshappoo and muttamaala are trademarks of this region. However, enterprising cooks here have largely experimented and improvised on various food items to create their own recipes.

By 2015-16, the number of such villages more than doubled to 1,137, according to the data tabled by the state government in the recently-concluded Budget session of the Assembly.The maximum number of villages covered by water tankers were in Banaskantha. In this district of north Gujarat, 459 villages were provided with tanker water during 2011-16.Banaskantha was followed by Bharuch in South Gujarat with 406 villages getting water through tankers. River Narmada passes through this district.The other districts where sizeable number of villages received drinking water by tankers were Kutch (330 villages), Junagadh (335), Rajkot (302) and Dahod (231). In fact, all the 231 villages in the predominantly tribal district of Dahod were provided water through tankers during 2015-16.This year too, at the very onset of summer, the Gujarat government has announced that it would be providing drinking water to 102 villages using 72 water tankers. On Thursday, the government announced that it would be providing water tanker services to these 102 villages in districts of Kutch, Surendranagar, Porbandar, Dwarka, Jamnagar, Junagadh, Amreli, Patan and Banaskantha.The use of water tankers to supply drinking water has always been a political hot potato in Gujarat, which over the years has developed an elaborate water-grid that is largely based on River Narmada. This water grid has a 2,727-km bulk water pipeline managed by the state-run Gujarat Water Infrastructure Limited (GWIL) and an additional 1,20,000 km pipeline for supplying drinking water under the Gujarat Water Supply and Sewerage Board (GWSSB).The implementation of the water supply scheme in Gujarat is based on Narmada canal and executed under two different programmes  Sardar Sarovar Canal Based Project (SSCB) and Sujalam Sufalam Yojana (SSY).The state has also taken up bulk pipeline packages under Mahi and Narmada bulk water transmission pipeline projects. By the end of October 2016, the work on bulk pipelines of 2,727 km has been completed and commissioned.Water tankers are used mostly in special cases and on humanitarian grounds. Most of the villages that are covered with tankers are either located in remote areas or might have reported some technical problem or breakdown regarding water supply, said Tushar Dholakia, member secretary, (GWSSB), a statutory body set up by the state government for development, regulation and control of drinking water sector in the state.State government officials said that tankers were usually used as the last resort in villages where other sources of underground water were unavailable largely due to salinity ingress. Tankers were also used in places that have difficult geographical terrain (or on a gradient), sources said.According to the latest edition of Socio-Economic Review (2016-17), at present 12,000 villages are connected to this water grid under the Rural Regional Water Supply Scheme. Apart from this, The Government of Gujarat has formulated, sanctioned and implemented a master plan amounting to Rs 13,990 crore for the Sardar Sarovar Canal-based drinking water supply project covering 9,633 villages and 131 urban centres.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

(Source: PTI Photo) Ahmednagar: Farmers spilling milk on the road during their state-wide strike over various demands at a village in Ahmednagar, Maharashtra on Thursday. (Source: PTI Photo)Day one of the farmers strike in Maharashtra saw supplies of fruits, vegetables and milk being hit in major cities like Mumbai and Pune. While members of Kisan Kranti, the umbrella organisation of farmers which spearheads this unique strike, maintained that theirs was an apolitical movement, Sadashiv Khot, minister of state for agriculture and marketing, said the protest was politically motivated and was being fomented by people who have failed in their political career.Farmers across Maharashtra had decided to go on strike from June 1 as repeated talks with the state government had failed to resolve the stalemate. Yogesh Rayate, state level coordinator of Kisan Kranti said complete loan waiver of the farmers and implementation of the Swaminathan Committees recommendation about fixing of agricultural produce were their main demands. As the state government failed to respond to our demands, we had no other option but to go on strike, he said. In response, farmers across the state took to stopping vehicles of fruits, vegetables and milk towards urban areas. A call was also given to farmers not to provide milks to dairies and not to sell their agricultural produce in the wholesale markets.As a result of the call, wholesale markets in Mumbai and Pune reported a sharp dip in arrival of fruits and vegetables on Thursday while markets in Nashik, Aurangabad and Ahmednagar were completely closed. Rajendra Shelke, president of the potato and onion sellers in the Vashi wholesale market in Mumbai, said there was a dip of 35 per cent in the arrival of vegetables. Dilip Khaire, chairman of the administrative board of Pune wholesale market, said there was a dip of 50 per cent in arrivals.The onion market of Lasalagon in Nashik district was completely closed as not a single farmer came to sell his produce. Vashi traders maintained that in case the supply continues to get hit, the rise in the prices of commodities could not be ruled out. Stray incidents of violence were reported from Nashik, Ahmednagar and Pune where farmers took to damaging milk-carrying tankers as well as vandalising trucks carrying vegetables. In many areas, farmers emptied milk containers and dumped vegetables on the road. Police had reportedly taken action against some protesters in Nashik, Aurangabad etc.Dairies across the state had reported a dip in procurement of milk as farmers refused to provide milk and at places stopped milk tankers. R S Sodhi, managing director of the Gujarat Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation (GCMMF)  the proprietor of Amul  said their milk procurement was hit in Maharashtra. Amul sells around 19 lakh litres of milk per day in the state and Mumbai is one of the major markets of the brand. We procure around 10 lakh litres from the state and the procurement was less today.In many places, the tankers were stopped, he said. Sodhi said while they were able to deliver milk on Thursday, if the strike continues, milk shortage could not be ruled out. Kolhapur-based Warna Cooperative Dairys milk tanker was attacked allegedly on Wednesday night near Satra, when it was transporting milk to Mumbai. B B Bhandari, general manager (transport) of the dairy, said they supply around 2.5 lakh litres of milk to Mumbai and procurement of the same was hit. We shall be transporting milk under police protection to Mumbai, but procurement has been hit, he said.An unfazed Khot said the state government will be able to ensure smooth supply of milk and vegetables to the urban areas. The people who are behind this strike are failed politicians who do not want the farmers to prosper, he said. Khot said the government was ready to talk and the on-going strike was not the solution. Rayate and other Kisan Kranti members, however, refuted Khots charges.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Apart from the natural calamity of drought, there were man-made calamities, and this column is about how the two have brought about the explosive situation in the country.Farmers agitations are spreading across many states. It is the culmination of the acute distress in the farm sector that many observers have written and spoken about in the last two years. Two years of drought in many states was the main cause. The governments cannot be blamed for the occurrence of drought, but governments are solely responsible for the mismanagement of the consequences of drought. Apart from the natural calamity of drought, there were man-made calamities, and this column is about how the two have brought about the explosive situation in the country.The bulk of farmers in India have no choice but to do farming. Land is the only asset they have, farming is the only skill they possess, and unless they grow food many of them will face starvation. Agriculture, despite its declining share in total output (GDP), is also the largest employer. In Indias economy, the agriculture sector has primacy.The Price of NeglectUnfortunately, the NDA government lost sight of this basic truth. The agriculture portfolio is the Cinderella of this government. The Minister of Agriculture, unchanged since May 2014, is a political lightweight with little clout within the government. (How many of you can name Mr Sharad Pawars successor?). The minister has been neither seen nor heard by most people. The only memorable statement on agriculture that I can recall was when he repeated the Prime Ministers promise to double farmers income in 6 years and when asked if they had meant real income or nominal income, there was deafening silence.On the other hand, the government erred grievously on the issue of minimum support prices (MSP). In its manifesto and in the election campaign, the BJP had unequivocally promised that it would implement the M S Swaminathan Committees recommendation that MSP should be cost plus 50 per cent. In government, the BJP not only reneged on its promise, it dealt a body blow to farmers by denying them even a reasonable increase in MSP in its first three years. The numbers speak for themselves:The ostensible reason for denying a fair MSP was that higher MSP fueled inflation, which is partly true, but to lean in favour of inflation control against the interest of Indias farmer-producers was the height of folly. Some inflation is inevitable, and the government and the RBI must use other instruments to moderate inflation rather than reduce the farming community to penury.Errors galoreThe second grave error was demonetisation. Mr Harish Damodaran has convincingly demonstrated how demonetisation has crippled the post-harvest agricultural economy (see The Crops of Wrath, Indian Express, June 12, 2017). Agricultural products are bought and sold largely in cash. Demonetisation dried up liquidity and prices have crashed. According to Mr Damodaran, never before have prices of tomato, potato and onion crashed at the same time. Same is the situation with soyabean, arhar, garlic, methi (fenugreek) and grapes. Saying that farmers have resorted to fire sales, Mr Damodarans conclusion is, We have entered deflation territory in farm produce, whose proximate trigger clearly has been demonetisation.The third error was when the Prime Minister announced, on behalf of the yet-to-be-elected Uttar Pradesh government, that all farm loans in UP will be waived if the BJP formed the government. More likely, it was just an election promise in a state that the BJP perhaps did not expect to win, but it was an unequivocal promise that has returned to haunt the BJP in several states. Farm loan waivers are neither intrinsically good nor bad. As Dr M S Swaminathan said a few days ago, Loan waivers, though temporarily necessary, do not provide for a secure long term credit system (emphasis supplied). When farmers do not get a fair and reasonable price and are unable to repay their loans, they demand a loan waiver. The holder of the highest political office promised a total loan waiver, why blame the farmers for demanding that the promise be implemented?In February 2008, the fiscal situation was excellent, growth had found a new momentum, and a one-time loan forgiveness to small and medium farmers was justified. The central government was confident it could fund the waiver and so it went ahead and announced it. In 2017, however, every prudent norm was turned on its head. The Prime Minister promised a loan waiver on behalf of an yet-to-be-elected state government, no one seems to have examined the capacity of UP to bear the burden, and no one seems to have factored the fallout in other states. Having mounted a tiger, the BJP does not know how to dismount it. Meanwhile, the tiger is galloping through Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Punjab, Haryana, Maharashtra and Gujarat.Jobless youth angryThe last straw was jobless growth. Young men can find no work on farms or off farms. Micro, small and medium businesses are not offering new jobs. Tier 2, 3 and 4 towns are full of jobless youth and their anger has turned against the central government. The BJP will not admit its mistakes. Nor will any BJP leader tell the Prime Minister that mistakes were made. Will the Prime Minister pull a rabbit out of the hat? Wait and see.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

The violent agitation that erupted in the Malwa belt of Madhya Pradesh, resulting in the death of five farmers in police firing, has now spread to Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Gujarat and Chhattisgarh. The demand for farm loan waiver, accompanied by higher crop prices, is now gaining momentum.More than 3.18 lakh farmers have committed suicide in the past 21 years. Every 41 minutes a farmer commits suicide in the country. While I agree that farmer suicides are a symptom of a bigger malaise that afflicts agriculture, policymakers have failed to take the massive death toll as a sign of terrible economic depravity that plagued the rural landscape. How long could we expect farmers to take the hit silently? It had to happen one day, and no one knew what will trigger it.For nearly three decades, more so after the economic reforms were ushered in, agriculture has been a victim of neglect and apathy. Following the World Banks prescription of moving 400 million people from the rural to the urban areas by the year 2015, successive governments deliberately created conditions to turn farming unviable, thereby forcing an increasing number of farmers to abandon agriculture and migrate to cities. To keep food inflation under control, farmers have been routinely paid less, not even to cover the cost of production, thereby driving them against the wall.With each passing year, the crisis worsened. The 2016 Economic Survey tells us that the average annual income of a farming family in 17 states, roughly half the country, is a mere Rs 20,000 or less than Rs 1,700 a month. Such a dismal income, merely enough for subsistence, was the outcome of economic policies over the years. I shudder to think how these farming families must be surviving all these years. After all, it is not even possible to rear a cow in less than Rs 1,700 a month.But I doubt if such details mean anything to mainline economists and policymakers. With the markets crashing after every harvest, and with the government reluctant to save farmers by ensuring that they get at least the Minimum Support Price (MSP), farmers are pushed deeper and deeper into a never-ending cycle of debt. Even the MSP is often less than the cost of production. In Maharashtra, the production cost of tur dal has been worked out at Rs 6,240 per quintal. The MSP was Rs 5,050 per quintal, but the price at which farmers were able to sell tur, and that too after waiting for nearly a week in the mandis, was between Rs 3,500 and Rs 4,200 per quintal.Take another case. A farmer in Haryana toils hard for three months, putting all his labour to reap a bountiful harvest of potato only to find the prices crashing, thereby forcing him to sell 40 quintals of potato for just 9 paise a kg. The shock often turns fatal. But the fact remains that the government has rarely come to his rescue. Compare this with the fall in stock markets, and the finance minister promises to monitor the crisis on an hourly basis, holding a press conference to assuage the investors. Have we ever seen the finance minister or the agriculture minister monitoring the deplorable condition when farm prices crash?The poor farmer has been left to live in indebtedness, which keeps multiplying with every passing year. The crisis is compounded by the denial of a rightful income to farmers for their produce. To keep food inflation under control, it is the farmers who have paid the price. In reality, it is the farmers who have been subsidising the nation all these years. Successive governments have therefore deliberately kept agriculture impoverished. An estimated 58% of the farmers go to bed hungry every night.After Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath announced a farm loan waiver worth Rs 36,359 crore, which will benefit 92 lakh small and marginal farmers, Maharashtra announced a loan waiver worth Rs 30,500 crore. Punjab is expected to take over at least Rs 30,000 crore of the bad loans. Though I am not in favour of loan waivers but in a deplorable situation that agriculture has been pushed into, a waiver is a short-term relief.It is an emergency measure to bail out millions of small and marginal farmers in distress. IndiaSpend estimates a total of Rs 3.1 lakh crore of farm loan that needs to be waived. This is still far less than the Rs 4 lakh crore bailout package that the telecom industry alone is seeking. Another Rs 1.7 lakh crore of bad debt is what the steel industry hopes will be written off.Holistic approachLoan waiver must be followed by policies that ensure loans dont pile up again. A tinkering here and there is not going to address the crisis. It needs a holistic approach and a paradigm shift in economic thinking.To begin with:The effort should be to make farming economically viable.The Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices, which works out the MSP for crops, should be directed to factor in four allowances being paid to farmers  house allowance, medical allowance, educational allowance and travel allowance. So far, MSP only covers the cost of production. Government employees get a total of 108 allowances.Since MSP benefits only 6% of the farmers, it needs to be understood that the demand for providing 50% profit over MSP will benefit only these 6% farmers. For the remaining, who are dependent on the exploitative markets, the need is to set up a National Farmers Income Commission, with the mandate to provide a minimum assured monthly income package of Rs 18,000 per farmer family.Public sector investments must come in urgently for constructing Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee mandis and also for storage godowns. At present, there are only 7,700 APMC mandis. What India needs is 42,000 mandis for every 5 km radius. And like in Brazil, where it is mandatory for a market yard to procure anything a farmer brings, APMC mandis should be equipped to do the same.(The writer is a commentator on issues relating to farmers and agriculture)"

The committee also has the agriculture minister Chiman Sapariya, health minister Shankar Chaudhary, minister of state for agriculture Vallabh Vaghasiya and irrigation minister Nanu Vanani.Patel said the committee decided that the government should also provide assistance to farmers who have restored their potato and onion produce in cold storages. Apart from this, the farmer will get Rs 1 per kg for exporting the produce from the state.Officials said that if a farmer sells 300 quintals of the crop in Gujarat he will get Rs 30,000 as subsidy. If he sells the same amount outside Gujarat, he will get an additional export subsidy of Rs 30,000.Ashish Guru, president of the Gujarat Cold Storage Association, said, ""This subsidy will be come as a major relief for farmers who decided to stock their crop for lack of a good price. This subsidy will help farmers to at least make good their storage cost.Sources said that the subside was announced keeping in view the election scheduled for later this year. Many farmers who had failed to get remunerative prices for their crops had earlier this month thrown their produce on the streets."

I am a farmer, have never done anything else, but its not sustainable any longer, Gurmukh clears his throat. The price of potato, the crop he grew on part of the land hes leased, has crashed. It means more debt for he has to pay a rent of Rs 40,000 for an acre though his potato crop has fetched him only Rs 25,000.Read the story hereWomen prisoners in Hyderabad to run petrol pumpK Gopal Reddy is serving a life sentence, but for all practical purposes he is a free man during the day.

This staple item is selling for Rs 70-80 in most parts of the city as well as Thane and Navi Mumbai.Citizens have been tweeting to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and chief minister Devendra Fadnavis to take action. The holy month of Shravan began in north India on Monday. The fasting season according to the Maharashtrian and Gujarati calendar starts July 24. As families abstain from non-vegetarian food during this time, consumption of tomato rises.Traders have no explanation for the increase other than ""unseasonal rain"". They say the situation will continue through August. This is bewildering given that farmers were dumping produce in the streets as tomato rates crashed to Re 1 per kg a few weeks ago.In Andheri market, vendor Umar said, ""We are selling good quality fruit for Rs 100 because we are purchasing for Rs 75 in the wholesale market. This stock comes from Bangalore. The crop in Maharashtra has failed due to excessive rain."" Last week, the largest trader in APMC had cited a slew of reasons including ""demonetisation, farmers' strike and bad weather"".On Monday, buyers in Thane market, Bandra and Andheri restricted themselves to purchasing half a kg. Others chose to avoid tomato. ""The greengrocer cheekily asked me why I did not want to buy tomato since I had bought other vegetables. I retorted that at Rs 80 per kg, he was welcome to keep his produce,"" said Shiuli Banerjee of Malad.Kitchens are forced to explore alternatives. Borivli housewife Rosemary Fernandes recommended that households try vinegar while Maya Mirchandani of Andheri recommended thickening the gravy with sour curd or tamarind pulp. Banerjee suggested lime juice and kokum to add sourness, and gravies thickened with potato and cornflour to tide over the crisis.Prices of onion-tomato have maintained a steady average of Rs 15-20 per kg since 2014. In previous years, the country had seen a biannual spike in rates from March-May and October-December as traders cited ""seasonal shortages"" owing to the vagaries of monsoon. This inexplicable spike has brought consumers' worst fears back to haunt them."

Under the scheme, the premium to be paid by farmers is kept low and the claims are fully settled.Responding to a question in the Rajya Sabha, Singh said the settlement of claims during the two years preceding 2016-17 remained higher because of bad weather (drought). But claims in 2016-17 were less on account of good rains.""If States feel they are burdened to pay their share of premium to private insurers (during good monsoon period when claims are normally less), then we have asked them to set up their own insurance firms to implement the scheme,"" he said, adding that Punjab and Gujarat have evinced interest in this.Replying to another query on the coverage of the PMFBY, the Minister said efforts were being made to bring more farmers under the scheme. Earlier, only loanee farmers were eligible for the crop insurance, now non-loanee farmers are also allowed. Last year, the crop insurance coverage was 30 per cent and it will be increased to 40 per cent this year, he added.Replying to another question on action taken to improve farmers' plight and reduce the number of farmers' suicide, the Minister said the government has revamped the old farm schemes and launched some new initiatives to reduce the cost of production and increase income.Admitting that farmers are in distress because of good production year, the Minister said the government is lending support to farmers through various market interventions to ensure support price to their produce. Farm produce like tur and potato are being procured under the central schemes -- Price Support Scheme (PPS) and the Price Stablisation Fund (PSF) to protect the interest of farmers, he added."

There are hardly any buyers for our crop. Since demonetisation, traders are facing cash crunch, resulting in drop of bulk orders from big markets like Delhi and other major cities, Jaswinder Singh Sangha, general secretary, Jalandhar Potato Growers Association, told The Hindu.He said that potato growers have kept the eatables and seed potatoes in cold storage since the last crop season in anticipation of selling the produce at a better price later.But now there are fewer buyers and poor prices. The crop is still lying and now when the new season crop will hit the market (in next few months) the loss of growers would only aggravate, he added.Facing hardships due to demonetisation, the potato seed growers from Punjab have demanded an immediate freight subsidy so that the growers can transport their crop to other States and fetch some returns.Also, the growers have urged the State government to waive crop loans of potato growers besides asking the State agencies to intervene and generate markets at the national and international level.Punjab produces quality potato seed, which is distributed across the country including West Bengal, Gujarat, Karnataka, UP , MP and Odisha. Potato seed is usually supplied from last week of October to mid-December every year."

The late rains will benefit planting of rabi crops such as wheat and chana, Pattanayak said on Thursday.""We are expecting a very good rabi season, so that should make up for all the minuses which has been ascribed for kharif,"" he said. The season's total rainfall for the country is 5% below normal, but it will not make any impact on planting that will begin in a fortnight, he said.Most parts of northwest and central India received deficit rainfall, but farmers in Punjab and Haryana have access to canal irrigation that helps them plant even if rainfall is scanty.Pattanayak attributed his confidence on rabi harvest to an extended monsoon. ""It (Monsoon) is now in withdrawal phase but still not complete, as we are expecting four days of very good rain in some parts of south India,"" he said. ""That is the region where rainfall has been deficit."" A drought assessment report prepared by Mahalanobis Crop Forecast Centre under the agriculture ministry had said that as of August end more than 225 districts in 17 states had less than normal rainfall.Pattanayak, however, said, ""We have to read Mahalanobis data with actual field situation to get a clear picture.""He said the 5% deficit in monsoon rains for the season would not make any impact on food security and food production. ""The occasional dip in vegetables will be there depending on local and seasonal condition, but we are quite comfortable in onion and potato production,"" Pattanayak said.Mahalanobis data is largely dependent on satellite-based remote sensing indices, rainfall data, soil moisture estimates, crop sown area and irrigation statistics, which are used for drought warning and assessment.""We are in a very good position as far as agriculture sector is concerned, contrary to the popular impression that is being carried out that we had a deficit rainfall,"" Pattanayak said. ""This monsoon, deficit has been only 5% for the country and in parts  south peninsular, north-west and central MP  it has been more than 5%.

5a14d10a9855b76bf13e82ef,A plate of goodness,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/a-plate-of-goodness/article19874354.ece,2017-10-17,"Food is an integral and essential part of all our celebrations in life. Be it child birth, marriage, festival or death, a set of special dishes are served in a thali. Over the years, it has become an essential part of every occasion. The salivary glands know the usual suspects and start working beforehand. But with changing demographies and increasing demand to consume cuisines of different cultures, thali is losing its purity and original charm. An element of shock and awe has crept into the ritual.Now Chef Kunal Kapur is rediscovering these traditional thalis through Utsav: Thalis of India on Living Foodz channel. Thali is unique to Indian cuisines and is found nowhere in the world. The bigger purpose of serving a thali is to have a complete nutritious and wholesome meal including vegetables, lentils, dry and gravy dishes. It is aesthetic and pleasing because of the play of colours and textures, says Kapur during a conversation in Delhi. Excerpts:What prompted you to take this journey?It is about discovering people, culture, food and beliefs through thalis. Usually they are associated with taglines like Punjabi or Gujarati, vegetarian or non-vegetarian with the word unlimited added to them. That is not what is being explored. What we are discovering are thalis, typically done in various communities, on special occasions and festivals like Holi, Deepavali It endeavours to explain what goes into making a thali and why only certain dishes make the cut .What would be special for Deepavali?On Deepavali, a typical baniya thali will serve lots of sweets  five to six varieties like ghiye ki burfi, pista ki lauj and a number of snacks like chaat, samosas, kachoris. In the main menu, dals and mooli ke kofte are served. The number of sweets in the thali reflect the social status of the family.A Punjabi thali on Deepavali will be sumptuous and vegetarian with many dishes prepared with potato and badis and will include parantha and kulchas, and kheer for dessert.What do thalis tell us about a particular culture or community?Somewhere the thali stands for nutrition, at other places signifying a belief and for some it has medicinal value. The Chettiar community were predominantly vegetarian. Being traders they travelled a lot, specially to South East Asia and over a period they started eating meat. So the Chettinad thali has non-vegetarian dishes and has a lot of spices from that region like kalpasi which is found in Malaysia and Thailand.Thalis tell us about the belief of the people. Varanasi thali is satvik without onions and garlic and is prepared fresh and has no canned ingredients. It is not too spicy and neither tamsik nor rajsik, nor heavy to ensure that it does not make one lazy or aggressive. The spirituality of the city comes through this thali.The Bodo thali is simple comprising local produce like pork and rice. It includes jute leaves which is more bitter than karela. The reason for its inclusion is the geography of the place. Thick with vegetation, people face lot of insect bites and are prone to become sick. So their thali includes ingredients with medicinal properties like jute leaves. Likewise, the Malwani thali has a strong presence of seafood because of the regions proximity to sea.How are thalis associated with places of worship?The belief system of a community flows into its food. In Udupi, there is a Krishna math and all Udupi residents are Krishna bhakts. They are strict vegetarians. No one is allowed inside the math kitchen. While everyone is served in a plate there, devotees seeking a favour from the deity are served food on ground. They eat like this, till their wish is granted.Are thalis under threat?As we are moving ahead, lots of our dishes are dying away, like pickles. Thalis too are vanishing as it is difficult to procure and prepare with most opting for what is offered by eateries. The show is trying to bring about an awareness regarding thalis and documenting them for future research and study. It definitely adds to ones knowledge. I did not know that in a Kashmiri Pandit thali no garlic or onion is used yet it has meat dishes.As a reputed chef, what are your takeaways from this journey?I have added vastly to my knowledge about local and regional cuisines. In Udupi, I tasted mattu gulla huli. It is sambar made out of green brinjals which comes from a particular village in the region, Mattu. It was tasty and the brinjal which had soaked the entire flavour of sambar did not disintegrate.I learnt how to make rice beer in Bodo which is consumed by men and women after a certain age. Since their thali has beer, it has no desserts. I had never heard of bichhu booty ka saag. A local saag grown in Kumaon, its leaves have a lot of thorns and sting like a scorpions bite. Made with care, it tastes out of the world.I discovered new styles of cooking. A small community called Pathare Prabhu in Maharashtra uses thande tel ka tadka for pomfret fish dish. This entails using oil along with other condiments but it is not heated. What is unique about them, is that there is no restaurant serving their food. Interestingly, they prepare and serve thalis with eight to 20 items, and is high on seafood on festivals and when the son-in-law is visiting their home. All this learning has become part of my kitchen vocabulary. I will take elements from these and tweak my dishes accordingly. I found rosella leaves or gongura grow in plenty in the north east and it can be used as salad leaves.(The show airs every Monday and Tuesday at 8 p.m.)Somewhere the thali stands for nutrition, at other places signifying a belief and for some it has medicinal value"

Photo: Pradeep Gaur/MintNew Delhi: When Prime Minister Narendra Modi voided almost all of Indias cash last year, Kuldeep Mishras savings were turned into worthless paper. The vegetable wholesaler was forced to spend hours in bank queues and his business suffered for a month.Still, he voted for Modi in state elections soon after and plans to do so again in a national poll due 2019.Wealthy people had black money and it all came out, Mishra said in a market in Sahibabad in Uttar Pradesh, one of Indias poorest states, using the local term for cash stashed away to avoid taxes. We have never had a better prime minister than Modi.Mishra, 49, says sales rebounded in a month, though official data show Indias expansion slowed to a three-year low in April-June, more than six months since the shock cash ban. Growth has also been affected by the disruptive roll out of a new sales tax, yet voters like Mishra are expected to vault Modi to power in his home state of Gujarat next month.Theres no single reason for Modis enduring popularity. While critics point to the Hindu nationalist agenda of his Bharatiya Janata Party as key to its electoral success, others say demonetisation fortified Modis reputation as an authoritative leader and undermined the oppositions attempt to paint him as a suit-boot government that favours the business elite over the poor by moving to make it easier to buy farmers land and hire and fire factory workers.While many accept that the move has dampened consumption, they believe it has dampened conspicuous consumption that was fuelled by black money and tax evasion, said Reshmi Khurana, Singapore-based South Asia head for Kroll Inc., a risk management firm that advises foreign investors. It did boost his image in the sense that hes being seen as decisive and willing to take bold action, even if it ruffles the feathers of entrenched stakeholders.The view is echoed by Vinod Kumar Gupta, a businessman in Uttar Pradeshs Ghaziabad district, who said Modi has the courage to take bold decisions. He has become a stronger leader, hes making India stronger, said Gupta, 73. His commitment to the nation is not doubted.Key testGujarat will be a key test, where voters will be called on to weigh Modis personal popularity against his policies, which have disrupted Indias vast informal economy that mainly deals in cash and creates the largest number of jobs. While India lacks adequate employment data, surveys suggest that Modis far from creating the 10 million jobs a year needed to keep up with his young and rapidly expanding workforce.The election in Gujarat, held on 9 and 18 December will follow the 9 December vote in the Himalayan state of Himachal Pradesh, which Modi is expected to wrest from the main opposition Congress party. The positive opinion polls are partly flattered by the fact that the Congress party and its leader Rahul Gandhi have failed to offer a compelling alternative.Rahul Gandhi is not very strong, he doesnt speak well and he lacks knowledge, said Shamshad Mohammed, a potato seller who said demonetisation pummeled the economy without stopping corruption.Though viewed as a landmark anti-graft move by the masses, many businesses viewed demonetization as an ineffective way to tackle endemic corruption, said Krolls Khurana. Modis also facing stinging criticism from within his own party, with a former BJP finance minister saying the government has made a mess of the economy.Aware of this change in mood, Modi has been countering with emotional and combative speeches, defending demonetization and himself as a champion of the poor. In a series of speeches last month, he said the Congress party tried to stall Gujarats growth during the years that he headed the state, from 2001 to 2014.He packaged demonetisation as a pro-poor and anti-rich move by projecting that he was going to take away black money from the rich and distribute it to the poor, said Arati Jerath, a New Delhi-based author and political analyst. As economic distress set in, his stature has diminished.She reckons Modi is benefiting from a lack of credible data to assess the full impact of demonetisation on the informal economy and the Gujarat elections will reveal sentiment on the ground.Milan Vaishnav, director of the South Asia program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said that any upside to demonetization will come only in the long-term, through greater digitization of the economy, shrinking of the informal sector, and a wider tax base.Back in Uttar Pradesh, several old men sitting in the shade near tethered water buffaloes said demonetisations harmful impact was over. Discussing the previous evenings news that India had moved up the World Banks ease of doing business ranking, they said they would continue voting for the BJP.Its not that all of Modis policies are good, said Mahendra Singh, 76, a retired factory worker. But well give him another chance in 2019. Bloomberg"

Regional director, International Potato Centre Peru, Mohinder S Kadiyan said, the centre is working in many parts of India and the objective is to encourage farmers for growing potatoes so that they become economically independent.He said that the farmer who grows more potatoes will be awarded. Agronomist Dr Sushma Arya said this is third project in Nachna area in three years. Earlier the project was carried out in Didhu area.Farmers had grown potatoes and the yield and quality was good.Scientists informed that the quality of potatoes grown here is better than Gujarat and Punjab.

Today, cotton fetches Rs. 800 to Rs. 900 per 20 kg, while our production cost is almost Rs. 1,000, if we include labour and input costs, he says.Farm distress is emerging as one of the important factors in the Assembly elections in Gujarat. The State is the largest producer of cotton and groundnut, which take up the largest cultivation area. In the current year, cotton has been cultivated on 26.41 lakh hectares and the expected production is 1.25 crore bales. Groundnut has been grown on 16 lakh hectares and 26 lakh tonnes is expected.Paresh Ujaria, a farmer with about 1.5 hectare of land and local Youth Congress activist, says farmers in the cotton belt are in distress. The prices of seeds, pesticides, fertilizers, power and labour have gone up. Today, one labourer charges Rs. 300 a day, while prices of our produce have stagnated for the past several years, making farming a loss-making proposition, he says.Babubhai Vasoya, a 52-year-old farmer at Thebachda village near Rajkot, echoes the same sentiments. I want to ask Modi [Prime Minister Narendra Modi] where is the Rs. 1,500 [per 20 kg] for cotton that he promised in 2014? In 2017, we are not getting what we used to get in 2011-12, when cotton price was Rs. 1,200 to Rs. 1,300 per 20 kg, Mr. Vasoya says.Gauravsinh Jadeja of the village says farm distress is sweeping across the region. Similar is the situation in every district of Saurashtra. You go to Jamnagar, Amreli, Bhavnagar, Botad and you will see poor farmers crying for better prices for their produce, he says.In North Gujarat, farmers face a similar predicament as they are not realising remunerative prices for potato, a major crop in Banaskantha, Patan and Gandhinagar.Farmers are forced to sell potato at Rs. 2 to Rs. 3 a kg against their production cost of Rs. 5 and cold storage costs. They need at least Rs. 10 a kg to make a little profit, says Ramanbhai Patel, a farmer and cold storage owner from Deesa in Banaskantha."

Express file Officials say the move will free the markets from political interference and allow for better implementation of schemes. Express fileFive major wholesale markets in the state, including Punes, are likely to see a major change in the way their board of directors are elected. Instead of elections to pick the board, the state government is likely to appoint senior officials as directors to run these markets. These five markets  the wholesale markets of Vashi, Nashik, Kolhapur and Nagpur, besides Pune  receive around 30 per cent of the commodities arriving from other states and have substantially large turnovers. Vashis is the largest wholesale market in the state and, besides Maharashtra, records arrivals from Gujarat, among other states. The move to appoint senior officials as directors is part of the new model Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) Act circulated by the central government in March this year. The Act specifies markets with more than 30 per cent arrival from other states as markets of national importance.State governments have been asked to give their suggestions and objections to it and adopt it as they deem fit. The Act has numerous other provisions to improve the performance of wholesale markets and help farmers realise better value for their produce. The government has formed a special committee headed by the director (marketing) to study the matter and submit a report. The report, it is learnt, is in its final stages after which it will be put before the Cabinet for approval.APMCs for long have been the hub of politics. In Maharashtra, the Congress and NCP have traditionally controlled these markets with the ruling BJP having a thin presence in them. Earlier, the state government had mooted the concept of expert directors, who would be political appointees on these boards. Majority of those appointed, it is said, were close to the BJP. The present move, many say, is another government move to wrestle control of these markets.Officials say the move will free the markets from political interference and allow for better implementation of schemes. Meanwhile, most traders say the move will not affect the functioning of the markets. Rajendra Shelke, president of the Vashi markets onion and potato traders, said trade would go on unhindered. This is purely a political move and will achieve nothing substantial, he said.Jagdish Apshunde, a director of the Nashik market, however, said the move will have its pros and cons. An upright officer will be able to run the markets better but if power is concentrated in the hands of a corrupt officer, the market will go for a toss, he said.For all the latest Pune News, download Indian Express App"

It was an issue of hot debate in newspapers and media yesterday that a meeting between former Pakistan high commissioner, former minister of external affairs of Pakistan, former vice president Hamid Ansari and former PM Manmohan Singh was held at Mani Shankar Aiyar's house. The meeting had run for three hours and the next day he called me ""Neech (low-born), the prime minister said.This is an issue of serious concern that when Pakistan has become a sensitive issue for the country then what was the reason to hold a secret meeting with Pakistan when the polls are being held in Gujarat. Former director general of Pakistan army Arshad Rafiq has insisted that Ahmed Patel should be made CM of Gujarat. Former army director general intervenes in Gujarat election. They held meeting with Pakistanis at Mani Shankars house and on the very next day of that meeting, Gujarat, backward community of Gujarat, Modi and poor people of Gujarat were insulted. Is it not an issue of concern for the country? Congress must answer what suspicious activities they are doing. They must answer the country, added Modi.PM Modi, who had to cut short his speech due to bad throat apologised before the public and affirmed that he would return soon to talk to the people of Palanpur. The prime minister was campaigning for BJP candidates: Lalji Prajapati from Palanpur, Mavji Desai from Dhanera, Shashikant Pandya from Deesa, Mavjibhai from Danta and Vijay Chakravarti from Vadgam.He asserted that the BJP had been defeated only in these five seats of North Gujarat in 2012 state assembly polls and asked the people to not only win the constituencies but also each and every polling booths.In 2012, entire Gujarat was with Modi, but only these five assembly seats in Banaskantha did not remain with the BJP. Are you in aguish with that or not? Do you want to settle the score this time or not? In these five assembly seats, whether there are Congress candidates or any devious person whoever is brought by them, I want to win all the polling booths in these seats. I want that the lotus must bloom (BJP symbol) in all the polling booths. If lotus blooms in all the polling booths then no power of the world can defeat the BJP, said Modi.Taking a jibe at Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi , PM Modi said, This region, which was infamous for its dust-storm, has now become famous in the entire country for its potato cultivation. You people know potatoes are cultivated in farms with hard labour in farms, but that fellow (Rahul Gandhi) says potatoes are grown in factories. Bring him here and make him understand that potatoes farming need hard labour.""When you shout Modi..Modi who do you see- the Prime Minister or Aapna Narendrabhai (our Narendra bhai). If you see Aapna Narendra bhai, that it means you still remember me and if you see the Prime Minister, then it means I am forgotten.
