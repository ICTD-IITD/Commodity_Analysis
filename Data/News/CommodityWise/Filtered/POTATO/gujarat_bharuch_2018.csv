He said farmers were no longer willing to grow the crop.Replying to him, the Minister said the Rabi crop saw a 1% decline in area sown this year but the actual figures would be known later as sowing was still going on. He expressed confidence that the overall area was likely to remain the same.Mr. Jhakhar was joined by other colleagues who wanted to know the steps the government had taken to help the growers. Mr. Singh said no minimum support price had been fixed but the Centre and the States resorted to the market intervention scheme (MIS) to ensure that farmers could recover their input costs in case of glut.BJP member from Amreli (Gujarat) Narayanbhai Kacchadiya highlighted the plight of the cotton growers because of inadequate prices. Pointing out that the farmer actually got about Rs. 900 against Rs. 1,200 for production for 20 kg, he wanted to know the steps taken to help the farmer.The Minister replied that the government was trying to ensure better prices and was committed to ensuring minimum support prices."

Industry players opine that bumper production could further put market prices under pressure as the government is only procuring quality groundnuts. On the other hand, oil millers, oilseed expellers and exporters are treading cautious in purchasing the commodity as they see Rs 800 per 20 kg as viable price for profitable business. The government is paying MSP of Rs 900 per 20 kg.PALANPUR: Potato growers in north Gujarat are feeding huge quantities of tubers to cattle in gau shalas in Banaskantha. With prices falling to Rs two to Rs six per 20 kg and fresh arrivals expected from January 17, the farmers who stocked their produce are now selling the crop in distress. TNN P6The groundnut production for 2017-18 is higher by 2.5 lakh metric tonnes than 2016-17. Off late, the number of farmers coming to mandis to sell their groundnut crop at market rates has decreased as the state government is paying MSP of Rs 900 per 20 kg. However, delay in payment has been the major concern and hence the farmers are forced to sell of their produce at a lower price. In the APMC, Rajkot, the price range was Rs 650 to Rs 850 on Friday, which was lower than the MSP, secretary, Agriculture Produce Market Committee , Rajkot, B R Tejani said.A secretary of another APMC said the MSP of Rs 900 per 20 kg is not acceptable to the traders and hence they are refusing to buy at prices at par with MSP. Further, the quality of groundnut has also taken a beating this year.Director Agriculture B M Modi admitted that the government was only purchasing quality groundnut as there are set norms for purchase of crop at MSP and hence only those groundnut which complies with the norms was purchased by the government. Agriculture minister R C Faldu was not available for his comment. Amid bumper production, procurement at MSP was hampered due to finance issues earlier and now shortage of bags has adversely affected groundnut purchase at MSP.The new government in state had taken the issue very seriously soon after taking the charge. Even in the first cabinet meeting decision were taken to purchase groundnut at MSP.In order to ensure MSP for farmers and supply to industry players, Gujarat government should follow Bhavantar Bhugtan Yojna or price deficit finance scheme adopted by Madhya Pradesh government for soyabean procurement, whereby farmers sell commodity in open market and government pays farmers the differential amount between rates in mandis and MSP. This way, the industry gets supply, farmers get MSP price and the state government does not have to bother about storage of the commodity, executive director, the Solvent Extractors Association of India, BV Mehta said."

With prices falling to Rs 2 to Rs 6 per 20 kg and fresh arrivals expected from January 17, the farmers who stocked their produce are now selling the crop in distress.President of Cold Storage Owners Association Ganpat Kachhwa said, We will have 20 lakh bags (each containing 50 kg) lying the 200 cold storages around Deesa. By January 15, the fresh arrival of potatoes would commence. We have no space to accommodate the new arrivals.District agricultural officer, (Banaskantha), P K Patel said the area under potato cultivation has increased from 66,170 hectare last year to 78,089 hectare in 2017.Deesa has about 70 per cent of the total products in the state besides Kheda, Mehsana and Sabarkantha districts.A potato farmer in Deesa Babu Mali said, We are ready to sell a 50 kg bag for Rs 40. But there are no buyers. This has been the situation for the last three years.Mali said farmers are not even able to recover the transportation costs.Kachhwa said they are expecting at least 5 crore bags of fresh produce as the atmosphere for potato growing was very congenial.This is only going to cause a glut and aggravate our problem, member of Akhil Bhartiya Kisan Sanghs executive committee Magan Patel said."
5b148d9d9855b72ada07d130,15% increase in potato production expected,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/15-increase-in-potato-production-expected/articleshow/62397878.cms,2018-01-07,"AHMEDABAD/PALANPUR: Farmers and traders in Banaskantha are expecting a bumper potato crop. Though the acreage sown increased by 17%, output is expected to rise by 15% from last year.In Gujarat in 2017, potato production was 17.10 lakh metric tonnes (MT), making up nine per cent of the countrys output. If market sources are to be believed, this figure will cross 19 lakh MT this year. After groundnut, the government will face a huge task to handle potato farmer, keeping in mind that in 2017 farmers were forced to dump potatoes in the streets, because they were getting meagre prices, an officer at APMC Deesa said.Fearing that farmers will not get remunerative prices this year too, Deesa APMC chairman Mavjibhai Desai wrote to the state government and met the new agriculture minister, R C Faldu With the area sown increasing we are expecting a bumper crop this year too. I have asked the state government to work out an action plan to bail out farmers who may not get proper prices for their produce. I even met Faldu. Desai said that the new crop has started trickling in but will be in full flow in 15 days.The price of new potatoes was around Rs 6 a kg at Deesa market, while old potatoes, which had been kept in cold storage is Rs 2 a kg. Satish Mali, the owner of a cold storage in Banaskantha, said the new crop is while there is still stock in cold storage. He said he still has 200 tons of old potatoes and the farmers or traders are not answering his the calls. We pay Rs 100 as loan for a 50kg bag to farmers, to meet packing, labour and transportation expenses. When the produce is sold the loan is recovered along with rent. A farmer incurs a cost of Rs 5 per kg to put potatoes in cold storage. Presently, they cant even recoup their input costs, so they dont turn up to claim their stored stock. We are just getting Rs 1.5 per kg against the input cost of Rs 5 at the moment.Kalubhai Ratnabhai, a farmer, says, Last year I got Rs 4 per kg and was expecting the price to rise further. I didnt sell my crop and am now not even getting a price that will match my storage cost, leave aside other input costs. If potatoes are in cold storage after October, that person is required to pay Rs 2.6 per kg. He further said that he opted to sow grow potatoes this year too, as it is cheaper, in terms of input cost, than others crops.Mavjibhai Patel, a trader from Deesa, said he had stored about 5,000 50-kg bags and in the last month he only got an average of Rs 3 per kg. He said that this was lower than what he paid the farmers."

The plan never took shape.In 2015, then chief minister Akhilesh Yadav had announced at a programme that least one vodka brewing factory would be set up in Kannauj and Farukkhabad districts each, which will ensure remunerative prices to farmers.While Akhilesh has represented Kannauj in Lok Sabha for two terms, his wife Dimple Yadav is serving her second term from the same constituency. Kannauj is part of UPs potato belt, along with Farrukahabad, Etawah, Mainpuri and Aligarh, stretching up to Meerut.With 31% production, UP is the largest producer of potato in the country and more than 8 lakh farmers plant potato every year, with production increasing every year.UP produces nearly 46 lakh million tonnes of potato a year in nearly 5 lakh hectares of area. Farmers, however, have no other platform except local mandis to sell their produce and trade some portion outside the state.Demonetisation and souring relationship with Pakistan have further dealt a blow to potato growers who were earlier able to get cash in hand by trading it off to other states and Pakistan.Unlike the adjoining states of Punjab and Haryana and far off Gujarat and Maharashstra, Uttar Pradesh does not have major food processing units to process.This leads to distress selling by growers in local markets at low prices and frequently dump produce on streets in anguish.Official records of the horticulture department reveal that the food processing industry in Uttar Pradesh is at the bottom as compared to any other state.While potato prices have touched an all-time low in the past two years, there was none to educate farmers to shift to other cash crops.Glut in the market in the past two years has resulted in farmers getting into distress, said RK Singh, senior scientist at Central Institute of Potato Research, Shimla.Farm crisis would not be solved unless the state government makes efforts for a food processing industry. Unfortunately, it has not developed in the state, said SK Shukla, principal scientist at the Central Institute of Subtropical Horticulture in Lucknow.Potato growers keep their produce dumped in cold storages for months as they cannot even afford the rent.If we collect the potato from cold storage and take it to the market, it would cost us Rs 30 a kg while potato is already available at Rs 5 to Rs 10 a kg in the market. This does not make economic sense, said Naresh Dixit, a regular potato grower in Unnao."

SSNNL blamed the limited water availability in the dam and poor monsoon in catchment areas of the neighbouring Madhya Pradesh.Hitting back at the Gujarat government for unilaterally deciding to stop the flow of Narmada water for irrigating summer crops in the state, a farmers body on Saturday said the move will adversely hit thousands of farmers in north and central Gujarat districts. Gujarat Khedut Samaj has claimed that the water meant for irrigation was being diverted for industrial use during the summer season.The organisations secretary, Sagar Rabari, has also threatened to take legal steps against the state governments decision. We feel that the move to cut Narmada water for the farmers is a kind of revenge taken by the state government after the BJP suffered heavy electoral losses in the rural areas in the just concluded state assembly elections, Rabari said.The Gujarat Khedut Samaj said while the industries  who are last in the ladder of Narmada project beneficiaries  will continue to get water throughout the upcoming summer season, it is farmers who will bear the brunt of the state governments decision.On Friday, the state government-run Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Limited (SSNNL) issued a circular alerting farmers not to take up the cultivation of summer crops as Narmada waters meant for irrigation will be available only till March 15, 2018. SSNNL blamed the limited water availability in the dam and poor monsoon in catchment areas of the neighbouring Madhya Pradesh.The Narmada dam had overflowed on July 27, 2017, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi had attended a ceremony where he dedicated the project to the nation after radial gates were installed on top of the dam. Where has all the water from the dam gone? The state government should provide answers, says Rabari. He claimed that the water level in the Narmada dam stood at 118 metres on December 31, 2017.Secondly, the Narmada project was designed to be a drinking water project where water allocation to industries was the last priority. So, if the farmers are not going to get water, then will the supply of Narmada water to industries be stopped? Rabari added.The representatives from the organisation claimed that the SSNL was non-transparent with regard to how much water it was currently supplying to farmers, how much was kept for drinking purpose and how much was being supplied to industries. We are not sure how many farmers will be affected by the state governments decision, but those in Mehsana, Surendranagar, Patan, Botad and Bhavnagar growing crops like bajra, jowar, watermelons, sweet potato and fodder will be affected, Rabari said, alleging that the state government, faced with water deficit, was diverting precious water meant for irrigation to industries in Sanand, Vagra, Kutch, Jamnagar and other industrial estates operated by the GIDCs.The government is already supplying more than the 0.2 million acre feet water of the Narmada meant for the industries, he said, adding that the demand for water from industries in Gujarat had surpassed the water allocation way back in 2014.There are three distinguished agriculture seasons in Gujarat  kharif, rabi and the summer season. Out of the 125 lakh hectares of gross cropped area, 70 per cent is cultivated under kharif crops, 25 per cent under rabi and only five per cent under summer crops.According to the figures sourced from the agriculture department of Gujarat, over 8.3 lakh hectares of land was sown under summer crop in May 2017 which largely included crops like bajra, groundnut, sesame, sugarcane and vegetables. Most of the summer crops are sown in north and central Gujarat districts.Meanwhile, the Gujarat Congress has also criticised the move of the state government to stop Narmada waters for summer crop irrigation. Manish Doshi, the party spokesperson, said that due to the incomplete canal network, the government was forced to divert the excess water during the monsoon to the sea.The benefits of closing the radial gates and generating hydro power will go to the neighbouring states. The real deal for Gujarat in this project is the water of the river, he said.Before the elections, the state government organised a Narmada Mahotsav and went around the state talking about how the project has benefited the farmers. Now, just a month after the completion of polls, waters meant for irrigation have been stopped. This will adversely affect the farmers, Doshi said. He added that the government should, in turn, impose a cut on supply of water to industries and divert it for irrigation.For all the latest Ahmedabad News, download Indian Express App"

The Congress was prompt in releasing the pictures of Mr. Gandhi, a red tika smeared on his forehead, performing the Khichdi daan , with saffron and yellow threads tied to his wrist.Followed by party workers and leaders, Mr. Gandhis cavalcade travelled all the way from the Lucknow airport, where he received a grand reception, to Amethi, passing through pockets of Rae Bareli. He had a stopover at a dhaba at Nighohan where he savoured hot pakoras and tea in kullad-pots in the company of Congress leaders, including PCC president Raj Babbar.Before leaving for Amethi, he addressed a nukkad sabha at Salon, criticising the Modi government over the plight of potato farmers, the GST, unemployment and step motherly treatment meted out to Amethi and Rae Bareli. He accused Mr. Modi and Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath of failure to keep promises."

He promised the people of his constituency to revive the food park project soon after returning to power at the centre.Earlier, the Congress chief was given a grand welcome by the party workers along his way to Amethi.

Whether it is pertaining to the Rs 15 lakh in the bank accounts of people or giving a remunerative price to the farmers or construction of roads..., Gandhi said at a public meeting in Salon.He was referring to Modis poll promise to deposit Rs 15 lakh in the bank account of every citizen by cracking down on black money, if voted to power.He alleged that a step-motherly treatment was being meted out to Rae Bareli, his mother, Sonia Gandhis parliamentary constituency, and Amethi. He promised to restore the mega food park in Rae Bareli and other development projects once Congress was voted back to power.Farmers are not getting remunerative price for their produce. They grow potato and mint but had been denied remunerative price. Farmers were committing suicide and throwing away their potato, he said.Rahul Gandhi went to Hanuman temple situated on the borders of Rae Bareli with Lucknow. Rahul also donated khichri on the occasion of Makar Sankranti. He also stopped for a cup of tea at Nigoha near Rae Bareli.Modi and Yogi for giving long speeches - Both of them believed in putting people against each other. They can not claim of launching a scheme that may have benefited the people.Had the food park -- scrapped by the Modi government -- been set up in Amethi, farmers in Rae Bareli, Amethi and other districts would have been benefitted, he told a gathering in nearby Pratapgarh.They are meting out a step-motherly treatment to you. They snatch away whatever development plan comes here and hurt you, said Gandhi.The 47-year-old called upon people to gear up for Uttar Pradesh polls and the Lok Sabha election due in 2019.The Congress had tied up with the Samajwadi Party for the 2017 UP election but was wiped out, with the BJP storming to power with a brute majority.Gujarat, where his party put up an impressive show but couldnt dislodge the ruling BJP, also found a mention in Gandhis address.Illustrating the alleged failure of the Modi model of development, he said. Ninety per cent universities in Gujarat are in private hands. A youth told me that students need to pay Rs 15 lakh to get admission there. he said.POSTER WARA poster war seems to have erupted ahead of Congress chief visit.

5aeb05309855b73f522c5f7f,From Dalit Activist to Gujarat MLA: Tracking Jignesh Mevani's Journey,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-depth-jignesh-mevani-s-journey-from-a-dalit-activist-to-vadgam-mla/story-T9N0QvSF6jVaah8tjKPlQI.html,2018-01-20,"Jignesh Mevani, underdressed for the chilly morning at Delhis Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) campus, walks tiredly into a dhaba. Hands in pockets, he squints at the freshly prepared potato curry, looks away, and stares through a cloud of misty breath. My body is going to give up, he says.Mevani is exhausted. Eighteen days after winning the assembly election from north Gujarats Vadgam constituency, the 36-year-old is in Delhi for a short visit  he is giving interviews, participating in television news shows and posing for pictures. He is upset about not being able to return the dozens of phone calls hes been getting. He is worried about his meetings in Ahmedabad where he was supposed to be.But his eyes brighten when a student, who takes some time to register that it is indeed Mevani sitting next to him, asks him about his plans for Vadgam. Wolfing down his food, Mevani says, You come to Vadgam after one year and see for yourself. We are going to transform the constituency. I will invite experts from various fields including RTI, health, education, social justice, research, to contribute in making Vadgam a model constituency. He means what hes just said. For Jignesh Mevani now belongs to the people. He appears for the momentto be symbolic of the disenchantment brewing in Gujarati society. He is the rare Dalit leader who has developed a massive following within his own community and outside. At a time when dissent is difficult, Mevani does not miss an opportunity to criticise the government. He won an election in his maiden attempt, without joining any political party. Now he will have to work within the official framework of governance, make the bureaucrats see his vision, continue from where his predecessor left off, and still make sure that he doesnt let his people down.But in the JNU campus, despite talking enthusiastically to the student about his plans for Vadgam, he seems tired, as if he doesnt really want the students to recognise him, as if all he wants is a few quiet moments of anonymity.JIGNESH AND VAN GOGHMevani wouldnt mind the title Vincent Van Gogh 2.0 for himself. He left a stunning impact on my soul, says Mevani of the late Dutch painter, considered one of the greatest artists of all time. His passion was mind boggling. I derive my zeal from him.He first read about the artist while doing a Bachelors in English Literature at HK Arts College, Ahmedabad, an institution that shaped his worldview to a large extent. That was where he met two people who would influence his thoughts and actions in ways he could not imagine. Saumya Joshi, then associate professor, English, was a dramatist. I was impressed as hell to see how Saumyas plays depicted the concerns of the marginalised, says Mevani. He exposed me to the arts, literature and theatre.Sanjay Bhave, also a faculty member in the English department, introduced him to the stalwarts of social activism in Gujarat. Bhave saheb glamourised them. I used to think, life toh aisa hona chahiye, where you can look beyond just a salary. Pagaar toh mil hi jaayegi. (Everyone works for a salary. The actual aim should be changing peoples lives).During his college years, Mevani was never seen as Jignesh, that Dalit lad.It was an extension of how he was raised in a middle-class joint family in Ahmedabads Medhaninagar area. While he was aware of his identity, it was not a topic of discussion at the dining table in the Mevani household. His mother retired from the BSNL as a clerk and his father was with the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation. Over the newspaper, Papa and I used to discuss general issues. Our debates were not about the problems of our community, he says.Mevani got a PG Diploma in Journalism from Ahmedabads Bhavans College and shifted to Mumbai where he worked for a news magazine Abhiyaan for three years.With his fans at the JNU campus, New Delhi in the first week of January. The youth, specially students, are impressed by his aggression and oratory. (Vipin Kumar/HT PHOTO)He returned in 2008 and began working with the civil rights organisation Jan Sangharsh Manch (JSM) run by the activist-lawyer Mukul Sinha, one of the people he had idolised during college. Jignesh used to call him kaka (uncle), recalls Mukul Sinhas wife, Nirjari Sinha. (Mukul Sinha died in 2014). He worked with us on the rights of sanitation workers and security guards. He was unsure about his career. Mukul asked him to pursue law, she recounts. So Mevani went on to do an LLB from Gujarat University.In the years to come, Mukul Sinha would become one of the three kakas who Mevani would revere and through whose work he would come face to face with the ground reality of Gujarat. The other two were activist-lawyer Girish Patel and the Gandhian activist, the late Chunni Bhai Vaidya, who worked for land reforms and the creation of sustainable rural economies. It was at Mukul kakas office where, for the first time, I understood atrocity in the real sense of the term. When I heard stories of undertrials in POTA, I was not able to sleep for many nights, he says.Mevani remained true to the spirit of Van Gogh in his passion for whatever he had set his mind on, a passion that could border on obsession. He submerged himself in the cases he fought, the academic exercises he undertook, and the causes he felt for. While analysing the works of Gujarati poet Mareez, also known as the Ghalib of Gujarat, he went to the extent of tracing people for whom Mareez used to ghost-write. To understand the life of freedom fighters, he travelled to Rajguru Nagar in Pune, the birthplace of Shivaram Rajguru, Sanjay Bhave remembers Mevanis obsessive streak.After studying the history of the Dalit community, Mevani concluded that their poor socio-economic condition was partly because a majority of them they did not own land.On July 11, 2016, Mevani was a member of the AAP and working as a lawyer with the JSM when cow vigilantes thrashed four Dalit men on the allegation of skinning a dead cow in Una, a city in Gujarats Gir Somnath district, 350 km from Ahmedabad.The Una case, which became symbolic of Dalit atrocities throughout the country, was the turning point that Mevani had unknowingly been prepping for. He went full throttle. Along with his friends, Mevani formed the Rashtriya Dalit Adhikar Manch (RDAM) which conducted a Dalit mahasabha in Ahmedabad on July 31.Jignesh Mevani with Balasaheb Ambedkar, Prashant Dhotha, Radhika Vemula and Umar Khalid at the 'Elgar Parishad' to commemorate 200th anniversary of Koregaon-Bhima battle at Shaniwarwada, Pune. (Rahul Raut/HT PHOTO)It was followed by a 10-day march on foot from Ahmedabad to Una which culminated on Independence Day. Gaaye nu puchhdu taame rakho, aamne amaari jameen aapo (You keep the cows tail, give us our land), Mevani hopped from village to village, repeating the slogan in every public meeting where Dalits took a vow that they would not henceforth lift the carcasses of dead cows.During lunch breaks, the RDAM members would review Mevanis speeches  was the audience relating to him or not; why was the crowd in a particular gathering smaller than expected; should he modify the content to suit local sensibilities; what was the extent of media coverage of the rallies.In hindsight, Mevani says, the Una incident catapulting him to the national stage was a lot about timing. Dalits have faced far worse brutalities than what we saw in Una. But the outcry in the Una case was unmatched. Certain things resonate at certain points. This was one of them, he says.THE MANDATEThe Vadgam election had dimensions of a David vs Goliath contest.On November 27, seventeen days before polling in Vadgam, Mevani announced, through a Facebook post, that he would be in the fray. Far from being wise, the last-moment decision verged on the insane. I was confused, he explains. We had no money or concrete organisation. At the same time I realised that I was at my best as an activist. I had caught the peoples imagination. My campaign would get massive media coverage due to which my opponent would appear diminished. So I jumped into it.On the one hand, there was the formidable electoral machinery of the BJP, oiled by the party president Amit Shah at the helm. The party had ruled Gujarat for 22 years and was looking to win at least 150 out of 182 assembly seats. On the other side was Mevani, a novice, self-proclaimed agitator, who was out to expose the socio-economic conditions of farmers, Scheduled Castes and minorities.Ironically, Mevanis image became his biggest stumbling block in the election. Dalits, comprising 16% of Vadgam population, could relate to his agenda. But the predominant Chaudhary community was not comfortable with his approach. They presumed that with Jignesh as an MLA, they would be routinely booked under the Atrocities Act because Dalits worked in their farms and factories, says Sagar Rabari, 50, a social activist and general secretary of Gujarat Khedut Samaj, who helped Mevani devise his election strategy. I had to act as Jigneshs guarantor, says Rabari.Supporters at a public meeting during Jignesh Mevanis election campaign in Vadgam, Gujarat, on December 10, 2017. This was Mevanis first election. (Kunal Patil/HT PHOTO)A lot, however, was going in Mevanis favour. The AAP and the Congress withdrew their candidates so that voters had a choice between Mevani and the BJP. Crowdfunding platform crowdnewsing.com raised Rs 20.5 lakh for his campaign. By the time of the election, Mevani had polished his oratory skills, having spoken at multiple forums in the one year period since the Una incident. Four teams were canvassing for himhis aides from Ahmedabad, activists and volunteers from Delhi, the local communities in Vadgam, and the Congress cadre.In retrospect, Mevani admits that he spent more time convincing people why they should vote the BJP out than talking about the change he intended to bring. We didnt elaborate on what we would do. My positive campaign was inbuilt in my image. I believe that I got 4,000 votes only on my credibility, he says.The BJP claimed that Mevani was an outsider; that he had accepted funding from the Social Democratic Party of India, a political wing of Popular Front of India (PFI), which has been accused of terror links (Mevani denied the charges); and that he was using Muslims for votes. The last charge stemmed from Mevanis interview published in the Forward Press, which quoted him saying that his first girlfriend was a Muslim.Mevanis victory was a vindication for his supporters not just in Gujarat but across the nation. At the all-India level, the anti-right forces are in search of some spark. They have found that in Jignesh. His position in Gujarat is reinforced with his national position, says Ahmedabad-based sociologist Ghanshyam Shah. If Muslims wanted someone whose hand they could hold, they have found that person.VADGAM IN WAITINGThe people who have been part of his journey so far or who have monitored his trajectory seem to know where he is faltering and the pitfalls that lie in his way forward as an MLA.He should watch his words. The radicalism he shows at times makes him vulnerable. Else the government will file cases against him and he will find himself entangled in legal battles, Sanjay Bhave echoes a concern shared by almost all of Mevanis well-wishers. Now he should rise above Modi-bashing and talk about concrete issues, he adds.He will have to cut down on travel and concentrate on his constituency. Now people have expectations from Jignesh Mevani, the MLA. He has to deliver. He cant continue to only be an orator, says Nirjari Sinha.Ghanshyam Shah suggests that Mevani should have a panoramic view of society and politics and move ahead accordingly. Currently, all the information he is getting is from the media. For long-term politics, he should have a group or a think tank which dispassionately reflects on the ground situation.Mevani says that the one criticism he has got the mostthat he should be less aggressive  is not unwarranted. I agree with this, he says. But the problem is that I wont remain who I am if I start working on this. This is who I am.About the charge that he over-travels, he says, Me going to various states energises the youth and Dalit groups. I should keep doing that but not at the cost of Vadgam.THE JUBILATIONIt will be some weeks before Mevani overcomes the euphoria of the resounding win that caught his aides and the country by surprise.Mevani is still getting used to being addressed as MLA saheb. I bought 10 new kurtas, all of different colours. I like wearing them with folded sleeves, with a wrist watch on my left hand. I flash the victory sign like a neta (politician) does. I am quite enjoying this. His eyes sparkle. But the feeling has not sunk in as yet.Mevani underplays the congratulatory phone calls and the meeting with the Congress party president Rahul Gandhi before the election. He describes it as a Hi, hello meeting. He is still getting accustomed to his new role  learning how to greet people, how to listen to them, how to become a leader his followers can admire and look up to.Like the bunch of students who surround him at the dhaba in JNU, vying for selfies with him, cautioning him, in awe of him, and waiting for him to prove them right. Responding to each one of them, Mevani seems like a leader at the start of an eventful and uncertain voyage. I am also a brand now, a force to reckon with, he says in a matter-of-fact tone."
5aeaff709855b73f522c5afb,From Dalit activist to Gujarat MLA: Tracking Jignesh Mevani's journey,http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-depth-jignesh-mevani-s-journey-from-a-dalit-activist-to-vadgam-mla/story-T9N0QvSF6jVaah8tjKPlQI.html,2018-01-20,"Jignesh Mevani, underdressed for the chilly morning at Delhis Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) campus, walks tiredly into a dhaba. Hands in pockets, he squints at the freshly prepared potato curry, looks away, and stares through a cloud of misty breath. My body is going to give up, he says.Mevani is exhausted. Eighteen days after winning the assembly election from north Gujarats Vadgam constituency, the 36-year-old is in Delhi for a short visit  he is giving interviews, participating in television news shows and posing for pictures. He is upset about not being able to return the dozens of phone calls hes been getting. He is worried about his meetings in Ahmedabad where he was supposed to be.But his eyes brighten when a student, who takes some time to register that it is indeed Mevani sitting next to him, asks him about his plans for Vadgam. Wolfing down his food, Mevani says, You come to Vadgam after one year and see for yourself. We are going to transform the constituency. I will invite experts from various fields including RTI, health, education, social justice, research, to contribute in making Vadgam a model constituency. He means what hes just said. For Jignesh Mevani now belongs to the people. He appears for the momentto be symbolic of the disenchantment brewing in Gujarati society. He is the rare Dalit leader who has developed a massive following within his own community and outside. At a time when dissent is difficult, Mevani does not miss an opportunity to criticise the government. He won an election in his maiden attempt, without joining any political party. Now he will have to work within the official framework of governance, make the bureaucrats see his vision, continue from where his predecessor left off, and still make sure that he doesnt let his people down.But in the JNU campus, despite talking enthusiastically to the student about his plans for Vadgam, he seems tired, as if he doesnt really want the students to recognise him, as if all he wants is a few quiet moments of anonymity.JIGNESH AND VAN GOGHMevani wouldnt mind the title Vincent Van Gogh 2.0 for himself. He left a stunning impact on my soul, says Mevani of the late Dutch painter, considered one of the greatest artists of all time. His passion was mind boggling. I derive my zeal from him.He first read about the artist while doing a Bachelors in English Literature at HK Arts College, Ahmedabad, an institution that shaped his worldview to a large extent. That was where he met two people who would influence his thoughts and actions in ways he could not imagine. Saumya Joshi, then associate professor, English, was a dramatist. I was impressed as hell to see how Saumyas plays depicted the concerns of the marginalised, says Mevani. He exposed me to the arts, literature and theatre.Sanjay Bhave, also a faculty member in the English department, introduced him to the stalwarts of social activism in Gujarat. Bhave saheb glamourised them. I used to think, life toh aisa hona chahiye, where you can look beyond just a salary. Pagaar toh mil hi jaayegi. (Everyone works for a salary. The actual aim should be changing peoples lives).During his college years, Mevani was never seen as Jignesh, that Dalit lad.It was an extension of how he was raised in a middle-class joint family in Ahmedabads Medhaninagar area. While he was aware of his identity, it was not a topic of discussion at the dining table in the Mevani household. His mother retired from the BSNL as a clerk and his father was with the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation. Over the newspaper, Papa and I used to discuss general issues. Our debates were not about the problems of our community, he says.Mevani got a PG Diploma in Journalism from Ahmedabads Bhavans College and shifted to Mumbai where he worked for a news magazine Abhiyaan for three years.With his fans at the JNU campus, New Delhi in the first week of January. The youth, specially students, are impressed by his aggression and oratory. (Vipin Kumar/HT PHOTO)He returned in 2008 and began working with the civil rights organisation Jan Sangharsh Manch (JSM) run by the activist-lawyer Mukul Sinha, one of the people he had idolised during college. Jignesh used to call him kaka (uncle), recalls Mukul Sinhas wife, Nirjari Sinha. (Mukul Sinha died in 2014). He worked with us on the rights of sanitation workers and security guards. He was unsure about his career. Mukul asked him to pursue law, she recounts. So Mevani went on to do an LLB from Gujarat University.In the years to come, Mukul Sinha would become one of the three kakas who Mevani would revere and through whose work he would come face to face with the ground reality of Gujarat. The other two were activist-lawyer Girish Patel and the Gandhian activist, the late Chunni Bhai Vaidya, who worked for land reforms and the creation of sustainable rural economies. It was at Mukul kakas office where, for the first time, I understood atrocity in the real sense of the term. When I heard stories of undertrials in POTA, I was not able to sleep for many nights, he says.Mevani remained true to the spirit of Van Gogh in his passion for whatever he had set his mind on, a passion that could border on obsession. He submerged himself in the cases he fought, the academic exercises he undertook, and the causes he felt for. While analysing the works of Gujarati poet Mareez, also known as the Ghalib of Gujarat, he went to the extent of tracing people for whom Mareez used to ghost-write. To understand the life of freedom fighters, he travelled to Rajguru Nagar in Pune, the birthplace of Shivaram Rajguru, Sanjay Bhave remembers Mevanis obsessive streak.After studying the history of the Dalit community, Mevani concluded that their poor socio-economic condition was partly because a majority of them they did not own land.On July 11, 2016, Mevani was a member of the AAP and working as a lawyer with the JSM when cow vigilantes thrashed four Dalit men on the allegation of skinning a dead cow in Una, a city in Gujarats Gir Somnath district, 350 km from Ahmedabad.The Una case, which became symbolic of Dalit atrocities throughout the country, was the turning point that Mevani had unknowingly been prepping for. He went full throttle. Along with his friends, Mevani formed the Rashtriya Dalit Adhikar Manch (RDAM) which conducted a Dalit mahasabha in Ahmedabad on July 31.Jignesh Mevani with Balasaheb Ambedkar, Prashant Dhotha, Radhika Vemula and Umar Khalid at the 'Elgar Parishad' to commemorate 200th anniversary of Koregaon-Bhima battle at Shaniwarwada, Pune. (Rahul Raut/HT PHOTO)It was followed by a 10-day march on foot from Ahmedabad to Una which culminated on Independence Day. Gaaye nu puchhdu taame rakho, aamne amaari jameen aapo (You keep the cows tail, give us our land), Mevani hopped from village to village, repeating the slogan in every public meeting where Dalits took a vow that they would not henceforth lift the carcasses of dead cows.During lunch breaks, the RDAM members would review Mevanis speeches  was the audience relating to him or not; why was the crowd in a particular gathering smaller than expected; should he modify the content to suit local sensibilities; what was the extent of media coverage of the rallies.In hindsight, Mevani says, the Una incident catapulting him to the national stage was a lot about timing. Dalits have faced far worse brutalities than what we saw in Una. But the outcry in the Una case was unmatched. Certain things resonate at certain points. This was one of them, he says.THE MANDATEThe Vadgam election had dimensions of a David vs Goliath contest.On November 27, seventeen days before polling in Vadgam, Mevani announced, through a Facebook post, that he would be in the fray. Far from being wise, the last-moment decision verged on the insane. I was confused, he explains. We had no money or concrete organisation. At the same time I realised that I was at my best as an activist. I had caught the peoples imagination. My campaign would get massive media coverage due to which my opponent would appear diminished. So I jumped into it.On the one hand, there was the formidable electoral machinery of the BJP, oiled by the party president Amit Shah at the helm. The party had ruled Gujarat for 22 years and was looking to win at least 150 out of 182 assembly seats.

5b2f4f589855b70eb7de7e7a,"Budget 2018: Why record harvests, government spending not enough for farmers",http://www.newindianexpress.com/business/2018/jan/27/budget-2018-why-record-harvests-government-spending-not-enough-for-farmers-1764050.html,2018-01-27,"Shreehari Paliath ByExpress News ServiceINDIASPEND: Indian farms produced record harvests in 2017, and the governments agricultural budget rose 111 per cent over four years to 2017-18. Yet, prices crashed, 8,007 farmers committed suicide in 2015, unpaid agricultural loans rose 20 per cent between 2016 and 2017, and 600 million Indians who depend on agriculture are struggling to get by.This is the situation that faces the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government as it heads into its last full budget before general elections in 2019, at a time when Prime Minister Narendra Modi has promised doubling of farm incomes by 2022.The agriculture sector will not just watch how much money is set aside in the 2018-19 budget but also how it is used, as the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) also tries to woo disaffected farmers before upcoming Assembly elections in eight states  Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan and the northeastern states of Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, and Tripura.Agriculture is the governments top priority, finance minister Arun Jaitley said on January 15, 2018, admitting that farmers were not getting the right price for their produce. That is an acknowledgement that record harvests and government spending are not significantly improving Indias agricultural crisis.Record harvest, falling incomeIndia has seen a decline in the proportion of cultivators  as the census calls farmers who own or rent land  from 50 per cent in 1951 to 24 per cent in 2011, as IndiaSpend reported on August 8, 2014. Yet, nearly half of Indias population, or about 600 million people, still depend on agriculture.India harvested a record 276 million tonnes  all-time highs were reported for rice, wheat, pulses, tur (pigeon pea), urad (black gram) and coarse cereals  4.01 per cent higher than the previous record in 2013-14, according to the fourth advance estimates for the rabi (winter) and kharif (monsoon) crops for 2016-17.Similarly, horticulture output was a record, nearly 300 million tonnes, or 4.8 per cent more than 2015-16, with potatoes  now experiencing a glut, leading to unrest among potato farmers in Uttar Pradesh  recording an 11 per cent rise over the previous year.Over a decade ending 2014-15, Indias agriculture sector grew at 4 per annum compared to 2.6 per annum the previous decade, according to the 2017 Dalwai Committee report that explored how farm incomes could be doubled, as Prime Minister Narendra Modi promised in 2016and IndiaSpend reported on March 30, 2016, as being unlikely.An indicator of growing problems in Indias agricultural economy is a drop in the growth of gross value added (GVA)  a measure of income to farmers before their produce is sold  to 2.1 per cent in 2017-18 from 4.9 per cent the previous year, according to the first advance estimates of national income 2017-18.The slowdown could be witnessed in Indias agricultural exports, which dipped to Rs 2.1 lakh crore, after growing more than five times over a decade ending 2014, while agricultural imports grew five times over the decade to 2015-16, Down To Earth reported on January 11, 2018.An agricultural slowdown has evident political implications: 49 per cent of landowning farmers voted for the BJP in 2014, Mint reported on December 20, 2017. A reminder came in December 2017 from Gujarat, where the BJP won by the narrowest margin in 22 years, winning fewer rural seats (43) than the Congress (62).Further evidence of farm distress is evident in rising agricultural loan defaults, loan waivers by state governments and farm suicides.Defaults, distress & suicidesAlongside record foodgrain and horticultural output in 2016-17, many Indian states were swept by farm agitations demanding higher prices for their produce from government and farm-loans waivers.One example is tur dal. After the monsoon of 2017, imports and a record harvest caused a glut that led to a fall in minimum support price (MSP)  the price at which the government purchases crops from farmers leading to unrest and stress in rural Karnataka, Maharashtra, Telangana, and Gujarat, IndiaSpend reported on June 8, 2017.A similar glut in potatoes crashed prices in Uttar Pradesh (UP), prompting farmers to dump produce on roads statewide, The Hindu reported on January 13, 2018. Such situations spur agrarian unrest. India witnessed an almost eight-fold increase in agrarian riots between 2014 and 2016, Mint reported on December 20, 2017. In July 2017, five farmers were killed in police firing during a protest seeking farm-loan waivers and higher produce prices, the Hindustan Times reported on July 17, 2017.As distress grew, so did farmer suicides, which increased 42 per cent in 2015 over the previous year, IndiaSpend reported on January 2, 2017. Indebtedness was a major reason for farmer suicides. Nearly four in ten of 8,007 Indian farmers who committed suicide in 2015 were in debt, compared to two in ten in 2014; more rural households went into debt over 11 years; and the average rural household had borrowed Rs 1.03 lakh, according to a January 2018 IndiaSpend analysis of government data.Nearly 70 per cent of Indias 90 million agricultural households spend more than they earn on average each month, IndiaSpend reported on June 21, 2017.In 2017, with farmers in eight states demanding loan waivers, Indias potential cumulative loan waiver was Rs 3.1 lakh crore ($49.1 billion), or 2.6 per cent of Indias gross domestic product in 2016-17, almost equal to Indias defence budget of Rs 3.6 lakh crore ($53.5 billion) for 2017-18.The loan write-offs caused non-performing assets (NPA)  or bad debts  related to agriculture to increase three-fold over three years to 2012-13, according to a 2017 report commissioned by the government.A major reason for persistent farm distress and the debt-and-death cycle is that 52 per cent of Indias farms depends on increasingly erratic monsoon rains.Despite normal monsoon, 8 states drought-affectedAlthough 2017 was classified as a normal monsoon, eight states were declared drought-affected, The Economic Times reported on April 6, 2017, revealing the vulnerability of Indias farms to uncertain rainfall in an era of climate change. Despite spending Rs 3.51 lakh croreequivalent to the farm-loan waivers demanded in 2017over 67 years, no more than 48 per cent of nearly 201 million hectares of farmland is irrigated.The government intended to invest about Rs 50,000 crore over five years to 2019-20 through the Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojanathe Prime Ministers Irrigation Programmeto reach its target of water for every farm.But the programme was modified to revive 99 moribund small and medium irrigation projects in 2016-17, Down to Earth reported on January 19, 2018.As production rises, so will the demand for water for irrigation, estimated to grow from 910 billion cubic meter in 2015 to 1,072 billion cubic meter in 2050. Irrigation requires more water than drinking water, industry and energy needs. Over a decade to 2011, water available per capita fell 15 per cent, IndiaSpend reported on August 2, 2017.Without a long-term budgetary plan, planning for sustainable groundwater management and conjunctive use using ground and surface water  India will face a water shortage.As the water crisis grows, programmes like the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana  Prime Ministers Crop Insurance Programme  started in 2016 to insure farmers and provide financial support after natural calamities, pest or disease outbreaks, could be redundant.As excessive extraction of groundwater makes water scarce for agriculture, it may be outside the ambit of schemes like PMFBY to provide farmers insurance against crop failure.There is a need to ensure that farm production is linked to various markets for farmers to recover full value of the quantity produced. This will incentivise the farmer to adopt improved farm technology and management practices for higher productivity, according to the Dalwai Committee report. This requires better storage and warehousing facilities.Better storage will reduce foodgrain wastageAbout 60,000 tonnes of foodgrain was wasted between 2011-16 in warehouses run by the state-owned Food Corporation of India (FCI). This means the grain either rots or is eaten by rodents and other animals.FCI stocks classified as damaged dropped from 18,847 tonnes to 8,776 tonnes over two years to 2016-17, according to this August 8, 2017, government response to the Lok Sabha, the lower house of Parliament. That is still 731 truckloads  using a 12-tonne truck  of wasted foodgrain every year.Indias cold-storage capacity for fruits and vegetables increased by 8 per cent to 346 lakh metric tonnes over three years to 2017. This should allow farmers to reduce time to market and ensure better quality.(Paliath is an analyst with IndiaSpend, a data-driven, public-interest journalism non-profit)"

Spandana is in charge of social media outreach for the Congress.The BJP wasn't happy with her comment, assuming she was referring to a hallucinogenic plant.""Most people of the country and our party members won't even know what you are referring to (including PM himself) but your Leader will connect with it instantly. While you have insulted people of India with your atrocious comment, your leader will be proud of you!!"", said BJP leader GVL Narasimha Rao.The BJP's Amit Malviya , its IT maven, also tweeted about Spandana's comment. He wondered whether Congress president Rahul Gandhi would suspend her like he did senior leader Mani Shankar Aiyar. The Congress suspended Aiyar from the party for using the word ""neech"" in a comment aimed at PM Modi during the Gujarat Assembly polls.Malviya, though, didn't 'tag' Spandana on Twitter, and the latter wondered if it was because those who follow him on the microblogging site would see her videos about PM Modi.""You didn't want to tag me cos you didn't want people to watch the Modi video pinned on my timeline?"" she said.Spandana also wondered - a mite disingenuously - what all the fuss was about, saying ""POT"" merely meant ""Potato, Onion, Tomato"".""Come on! Be a sport- And hey, POT = Potato ?? Onion Tomato ?? what were you thinking? ??,"" she tweeted.The BJP was not mollified. Its IT wing head Malviya said more than 3,500 farmers have committed suicide in Karnataka, the highest for any state in India, but ""speaking for them is being on 'POT'... Congress keeps it classy, again"".PM Modi used the word acronym ""TOP"" when talking about the Union Budget 2018's 'Operation Green'.""Farmers producing fruits and vegetables are our 'TOP' priority. 'TOP' means 'Tomato, Onion and Potato'. We have launched 'Operation Green' in interest of these farmers. 'Operation Green' would be beneficial for farmers just like the Amul model was successful in dairy,"" the PM said yesterday.(With inputs from PTI)"

When politicians trade barbs and innuendo on social networking sites, it translates to business as usual. The key is to inform voters, not rabble-rouse or flood them with babble. Politicians not only need to broadcast their views, but also listen to their voters. And that should be done intelligently.BENGALURU: The Congress on Monday distanced itself from its social media head Divya Spandanas controversial tweet that made a derogatory and personal attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi , soon after she came under flak.Divya alias Ramya, former Mandya MP, had on Sunday taken a dig at Modi, wondering if he was on pot (cannabis), a putdown which invited sharp criticism. The actor-turned-politicians swipe came following Modis comment at a rally here, during which he said farmers were his top priority and described TOP as tomato, onion and potato. Is this what happens when youre on POT? she tweeted.Reacting to the pot jibe, chief minister Siddaramaiah said he is not aware of the tweet, but character assassination of any individual was not right.I have countered Modis allegations point-by-point against our government, but refrained from making any personal attack. He may be our political rival, but I will not speak disrespectfully of the PM personally. We are in a federal structure. We have accepted the Constitution. We have to run the government in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution. We cant go against it. We are not the BJP to go against the Constitution, he said.Hitting out at Ramya, BJPs IT cell head Amit Malviya tweeted: In Karnataka, more than 3,500 farmers have committed suicide under @ siddaramaiahs watch, highest for any state in India but speaking for them is being on POT...Congress keeps it classy, again...And in another tweet: Will Rahul Gandhi maintain silence on Divya Spandanas comment while he sacked Mani Shankar Aiyar just because his jibe came close to Gujarat election and Karnataka is still some months away? Or sacrificing his close aide, responsible for his rise as a leader, takes some courage?To this Ramya replied: Single Meaning plz ! Share it with those who have understood. If TOP means Tomato Onion Pakoda sorry Potato for @narendramodi, POT can also mean Potato Onion & Tomato for @divyaspandana Think Good!!!"

The PM on Sunday said in an address in the state that farmers are his ""TOP"" priority, and explained that by ""TOP"", he meant ""tomato, onion and potato"".Ergo, the Karnataka Congress today tweeted asking him questions on unemployment, using similar acronyms and giving new expansions to existing ones.""Mr. Modi, isn't your TOP priority to create Jobs? But your government is NDA - Not Doing Anything!"", tweeted the Congress party's Karnataka unit.NDA is, of course, a reference to the government at the Centre. It actually stands for 'National Democratic Alliance' and is a coalition of parties headed by the BJP About Modi's ""TOP"" comment, the Karnataka Congress got into a smidgen of trouble yesterday and on Sunday.What happened was that the Congress social media head and Karnataka unit member Divya Spandana asked referring to Modi's comment, ""Is this what happens when you're on POT?""The BJP wasn't happy with her comment, assuming she was referring to a hallucinogenic plant.""Most people of the country and our party members won't even know what you are referring to (including PM himself) but your Leader will connect with it instantly. While you have insulted people of India with your atrocious comment, your leader will be proud of you!!"", said BJP leader GVL Narasimha Rao.The BJP's Amit Malviya, its IT maven, also tweeted about Spandana's comment. He wondered whether Congress president Rahul Gandhi would suspend her like he did senior leader Mani Shankar Aiyar. The Congress suspended Aiyar from the party for using the word ""neech"" in a comment aimed at PM Modi during the Gujarat Assembly polls.Spandana then wondered - a mite disingenuously - what all the fuss was about, saying ""POT"" merely meant ""Potato, Onion, Tomato"".""Come on! Be a sport- And hey, POT = Potato ?? Onion Tomato ?? what were you thinking? ??,"" she tweeted.The BJP was not mollified. Its IT wing head Malviya said more than 3,500 farmers have committed suicide in Karnataka, the highest for any state in India, but ""speaking for them is being on 'POT'...

(Express Photo/Avinash Nair) Desraji Thakor at his house in Khariya village. (Express Photo/Avinash Nair)Last July, a flash flood had swept away his life, killing 17 members of his family and destroying his cotton crop in Khariya village of Banaskantha district of north Gujarat. This year, 70-year-old Desraji Thakor is battling for survival. Water, the abundance of which had played havoc in his life six months ago, the same water  now its scarcity  has made Thakors life miserable again.Struggling to reap his first crop after the devastating flood of last year, a desperate Thakor family has to draw water from the adjacent Narmada Main Canal using a diesel pump, an act outlawed by the government. Last month, farmers were warned by the Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Limited (SSNNL) against illegal lifting of water from the canal, and some of them were even issued notices.Read | As Gujarat gets NCA nod, CM says crisis avertedWe have sown wheat and castor on six bighas. This is our very first crop after the last years flood. Last year, we had sown cotton at the beginning of the Kharif season, but the flood washed it away. We could not sow anything later in the year as our land was full of mud and slush, says Thakor, resting on his cot under the shade of a neem tree in his backyard and surrounded by the remains of his houses that were swept away by the flood.Banaskantha, the potato capital of the country, reaps harvest round the year  kharif, rabi and summer crops  because of its fertile land, and has the highest harvest of summer crops. This rabi season, farmers in the district have sown crop in over 5.71 lakh hectares, the highest among all the 33 districts of the state. Most of the farmers in the district have sown mustard in over 1.57 lakh hectares, followed by wheat in 74,000 hectares with canal irrigation facilities and cumin in 70,500 hectares. But at the beginning of this year, the BJP government said that it will not be able to provide Narmada waters for irrigation after March 15, citing very low rainfall in the catchment area of the Sardar Sarovar Dam, and warned farmers against sowing summer crops.Read | Gujarat in fix as Sardar Sarovar water level at alarming lowWe spent at least three months cleaning our farmland and making it cultivable. Now, when we are in the middle of the Rabi season, we hear that the government has disallowed lifting of water from the Narmada Main Canal. How will our crops survive, asks Desrajis nephew Pradhan as he joins him on the cot.We spend at least Rs 1,000 on diesel, every time we irrigate our fields. This is the only way, we can irrigate our fields as our borewells were damaged in the floods, adds Pradhan who is hopeful that the state government will not act harshly against the farmers of the village, which was one of the worst-affected areas during last years monsoon.The political allegiance of the Khariya village can be gauged by the BJP flags fluttering on most of the rooftops. In the recently concluded Assembly elections, distribution of Rs 1,500 crore of flood relief had become a major political issue in the district as parties pitched for votes.In the adjoining farmland, 33-year-old Mehraj Desai has just finished watering his mustard crop that he has sown in two of the three bighas he owns. My one bigha of land is not yet suitable for cultivation. You can see, nothing grows in this patch of land, says Desai pointing to an area where the rich loamy soil has been swept away.For farmers like Desai, who are still in the process of rebuilding their homes destroyed in the flood, the Narmada Main Canal, which cuts through the Khariya village, carrying water to Rajasthan is the only source of irrigation.Our families cannot survive by reaping just one crop in a year. We will have to go for the summer crop as well, says Desai who plans to sow bajra in an adjoining piece of land once the rabi crop is harvested.According to the the agriculture department figures, over 8.3 lakh hectares of land was sown under summer crop in May 2017, which largely included crops like Bajra, groundnut, sesame, sugarcane and vegetables. Last year, most of the summer crops were sown in Banaskantha, Patan and Mehsana districts.The situation of the families living on western side of the Narmada Main canal  that breached at several places last year, compounding the flood-situation - is even worse.Shravan Vaghela and two of his brothers, whose 22 bighas of land was completely inundated after the canal got breached, live in tents on a piece of land that resembles a dried-up riverbed. Six months after the floods, the damaged wall of the canal has been rebuilt, but the Vaghela family has managed to rebuild only one of the three houses that once stood at a corner of their farm.We cannot starve to death, and so we have sown wheat in one bigha of land that we have managed to cultivate using water from the canal. The rest is full of sand and gravel. It will take several months to restore them, says Vaghela as children play cricket in an empty plot of land behind the rebuilt house.Not a single government official came to inquire about our condition after the floods, but now officials from the Narmada Nigam (Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Ltd) come in droves to tell us to remove our diesel pumps which we use to irrigate a small portion of our land. Isnt this unfair? asks Vaghela whose borewell still lies buried in two-feet of sand. Nearby, the work of repairing the damaged canal is still underway.Read more from The Indian Express series, Narmada Rationing the Lifeline, here.For all the latest Ahmedabad News, download Indian Express App"

The model contract law, a copy of which has been reviewed by Hindustan Times, follows the Model Agricultural Produce and Livestock Marketing (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2018.Conceived in the 1960s, APMC regulations require farmers to sell to licenced middlemen only in notified markets, usually in the same area as the farmer, rather than directly to buyers elsewhere.These rules were meant to protect farmers from being forced into distress selling. Over time, they have spawned layers of intermediaries, stretching the farm-to-fork supply chain. This results in a large price spread, meaning fragmentation of profit share because of the presence of too many middlemen.Usually, farmers get the lowest share of profit. APMCs have also become hubs for cartels that rig the system to offer lower prices to farmers while driving up prices for consumers. India has about 6,800 such public-sector markets.The revised Model Agricultural Produce and Livestock Contract Farming (Promotion & Facilitation) Act, 2018, now set to be released to states, allows firms to sign advance contracts with farmers to grow a chosen crop or its specific variety with a buy-back assurance at an agreed price, giving cultivators a ready market without the oversight of the APMC system.A model law isnt presented in Parliament, but is instead sent to states for passage since the Centre cannot bring laws to regulate agriculture marketing, which falls in the states domain.To work around APMC markets, the budget for fiscal 2019 has also proposed to develop 22,000 new or existing private rural markets.The revised provisions of the model contract law state that businesses and farmers can enter into contracts for any crop, livestock breed or poultry of their choice. The earlier version, released for public scrutiny on January 23, restricted contract farming to only those crops that are allowed by states.The model law provides for dispute settlement at the level of the tehsil, or local administrative unit. It does away with an earlier provision that disputes could be taken for appeal to a decree court. Instead, the parties can escalate it to a three-member local authority, comprising an independent farmer, a corporate representative and a domain expert, all unrelated to the contracting parties. The law seeks to protect the farmers lands and their title. No business can build permanent structures on a farmers land or seize land. Registrations of contracts will be completely online, the model law says. The earlier version provided for physical contracts.Technological advancement with better agricultural practices makes contract farmers more technically and economically efficient, according to a 2016 post-doctoral study on contract farming in Punjab by Nivedita Sharma of the New Delhi-based Jawaharlal Nehru University.In most cases of contract farming, the sponsor, or the contracting firm, also directly provides most inputs, such as seeds and fertilizer, as well as credit and technical skills to the farmers with whom it enters into a deal. This lowers the market risk for farmers.Several states did reform markets and gave direct marketing licences to various kinds of corporate buyers like Tata, Mahindra and Godrej, said R Ravikanth, an analyst with commodity trading firm Comtrade.We dont support contract farming because it is another form of exploitation. Why isnt there a provision that all produce will be contracted above minimum support prices? said Pema Ram, a leader of the All India Kisan Sabha.Most of these licences are not in use, Ravikanth added, because it is difficult to coordinate with a large number of small farmers. Current examples of contract farming include PepsiCo Inc. for tomato in Punjab, SABMiller Plc. for barley and McCain Foods Ltd for potato in Gujarat."

Bridges primarily consist of two formats  sticks and triangles. While most players in the category operate in sticks, the triangular format is pioneered by Mad Angles, inspired by the traditional Gujarati snack khakra. The four broad sub-segments of the salty snacks industry are Indian namkeens (Rs 9,500 crore), potato chips (Rs 5,500 crore), extruded (Rs 4,300 crore) and bridges. PepsiCo and ITC compete in almost all segments of salty snacks. Besides, they also compete in juices.According to industry sources quoting Nielsen data for February and March 2018 in the bridges segment, ITC Bingo, with a share of just over 30%, has overtaken PepsiCos Kurkure by a small margin. ITC has displayed consistency in being a leader in this subset for three months (January, February and March) this year.However, according to Nielsen's moving annual total data quoted for March 2018, quoted by these industry sources, PepsiCo has a higher value share of about 31% as compared to ITCs share of about 30%. MAT data is relied upon by the FMCG industry to get a picture of the rolling yearly sum. However, any event such as a change in leadership  no matter how minor  in a particular month indicates a turning point for a brand.ITC divisional CEO (foods) Hemant Malik said, ITC Bingo is today the market leader in the bridges segment. The category has become a lot more challenging with the expansion of various smaller and regional players. However, ITC Bingo has been steadily growing in the segment and has maintained a very high share vis--vis competition. Tedhe Medhe has been the growth driver for ITC in the bridges segment. The brand continues to grow in double digits every year.PepsiCo India, however, believes the data relating to a subset does not represent a correct picture. In our view, the understanding of the category is important. The bridges category appears outdated and does not hold relevance given the evolution of the snacks market and consumer preferences. PepsiCo looks at the broader extruded segment and so does Nielsen (that includes sub-categories like collet, puffs, triangle-shaped chips and others) where bridges is only a subset. Hence, it is not a like-to-like comparison, said the PepsiCo India spokesperson.In extruded snacks, PepsiCo India has a higher share of 26% (MAT data for March 2018), while ITC is at around 21%. The PepsiCo India spokesperson said considering that salty snacks is a very complex category  with multiple segments and sub-segments operating within it  different manufacturers and brands may assess their performance based on classifications best suited for them in the market. This is done by taking into account factors such as presence of branded products in a segment, average selling price of segment or sub-segment.PepsiCo India, which extended its portfolio with the launch of Kurkure Trangles , is the market leader in salty snacks, which is also the fastest growing category in overall snacks. Our flagship brand Kurkure is growing at a healthy double-digit and we aim to double our volumes on the brand in the next five years on account of regionalisation and innovation, the spokesperson added. ITC, on the other hand, has utilised its in-house culinary expertise of ITC hotels chefs to understand the needs of variety-seeking consumers in different geographies. ITC has a widespread distribution network that plays a critical role in ensuring product availability across the length and breadth of the country. Strong distribution growth is also a key driver for Tedhe Medhes business growth. In the last one year, ITC has added over 2.9 lakh retailers in the bridges segment, said Malik."

Three months on, they have some reason to cheer. Wholesale potato prices now range from Rs 9 to Rs 22 a kilogram and are not expected to slide anytime soon. As demand rises, market experts feel prices will rise further, by up to 60%.One reason is that the quantity of potatoes in cold storage is currently 20% less than last year. Officials said that potatoes are currently commanding higher prices than onions and tomatoes. The wholesale price of onions currently ranges between Rs 3.50 and Rs 9 per kilogram, while tomatoes are selling for between Rs 6 and Rs 9 a kilogram.Potato prices have been rising for a fortnight and market officials believe they will climb further. We are seeing wide fluctuations in the wholesale market. Any tightening of supply will raise prices further, says Deepak Patel , secretary of the Ahmedabad Agricultural Produce Market Committee.Market officials met traders who said prices will not rise if demand remains at the same level, Patel said.Ashish Guru, president of the Gujarat Cold Storage Association , says, There are at least one crore 50-kg bags fewer at cold storages in Gujarat compared to 2017. Further, Uttar Pradesh, a major potato producing state, has registered a fall in production. Farmers have not been getting remunerative prices for their produce and have hence moved away potato to more lucrative crops.Guru said the Gujarat government last year gave Rs 40 as subsidy to potato farmers. Only 4.09 crore 50-kg bags have been stored this year. The number was 5.10 crore bags in 2017. Cold storage capacity in the state is 5.75 crore bags.Guru said the drop in potato production this year has brought some relief to farmers at the cost of higher prices for consumers.According to potato traders, farmers in major potato producing states collectively reduced the acreage sown with the tuber last year by 5% to 7%, after two straight years of gluts in the market. The reduced acreage has led to a 10% to 20% fall in potato output."

The ban was imposed following detection of Nematode virus in the potato samples of districts, including Una, Kullu and Shimla . According to agriculture minister and Lahaul-Spiti MLA, Dr Ram La Markanda, no virus was detected in Lahaul-Spiti potatoes and, therefore,ban should be lifted for their region.

Let Karam (trade) follow Dharam (religion). Our only wish is that Wagah is opened for trade. It holds immense potential for Punjab and for other neighbouring states as well as for Pakistani Punjab, said Rupinder Singh Sachdeva, chairman of Punjab chapter of PHD Chamber of Commerce.Industry sources said that due to restrictions only a few items can be sent through land route. Importers and exporters on both sides have to send or receive items through sea route. First industrialists from Punjab send products through Kandla (Gujarat) or Nhava Sheva (Maharashtra) ports to Dubai from where these are sent to Karachi port and then to Punjab in Pakistan. What can reach there just by covering 40-50 km covers thousands of kilometres. It would not only help the business thrive but the environmental impact would also be good with things reaching there through very short route, he added.An exhibition and trade fair is being organized by the chamber from December 6 to 10 at Amritsar. It was started in 2005, when Captain Amarinder Singh was the chief minister. This is the 13th edition of the fair,Sachdeva said.However, earlier exchange of business delegations was better. For the last three years, both the countries are not giving visas easily. This time also we are getting only 4-5 exhibitors directly who have SAARC visas and others would be holding their stalls through their local contacts or dealers. The businessmen from there now have stopped applying for visas as the wait for visa was being made torturous, Sachdeva revealed.Echoing similar sentiments Chamber of Industry and Commercial Undertakings (CICU) president Upkar Singh Ahuja, whose unit at Ludhiana manufactures auto components, farm machinery and bicycle components, said that there was immense potential of trade with Pakistan. We have been demanding for the last 20 years that trade with Pakistan should be opened, he said.Trade with Pakistan holds key to huge markets further and Punjab cen benefit from it immensely, said Hand Tools Manufacturing Association secretary Ashwani Vitcor.Farmers also raise voiceIf export of potatoes is allowed to Pakistan then all the growers can be saved, said Jalandhar Potato Growers Association general secretary Jaswinder Singh Sangha.

Yashpal was arrested from his home in Mahisagar on Wednesday night by Mahisagar police and handed over to the Gandhinagar police. Nilesh Patel, a coaching centre owner, and two other key accused are still on the run, said a police official.According to the police, despite strict warning and a watch kept by bouncers of the Delhi-based gang, Yashpal managed to sneak out of the hideout with a hand-written answer key in a potato wafer packet.SP, Gandhinagar, Mayur Chavda said the gang members have been identified and they would be arrested soon. A group of 28 candidates were taken to Delhi by Nilesh Patel to memorise the answer key of the question paper set for the Lok Rakshak Dal (LRD) recruitment. The key was leaked probably by a mole in the printing press located in South India. The group was asked not to take with them any written material.The candidates were first driven to Gurugram in four vehicles and from there in other vehicles. The vehicles were driven for about hour and half in the dark through several roads to avoid the route being tracked by the candidates. They were then taken in groups of four to five each to different locations, some of which were auto garages, makeshift metal sheds and under-construction houses, said Chavda.On directions of Nilesh Patel and Indravadan, Yashpalsinh tore the piece of paper given to each candidate by the gang to practice the answers and copied the answers. He then hid it in a wafer packet. Yashpalsinh was frisked by the bouncers when he was leaving the venue but they couldnt detect the paper in the wafer packet, added Chavda.Yashpal flew back to Vadodara on the ticket booked by Rajendra Vaghela and Indravadan. He gave the handwritten answer key of the LRD exam paper to Indravadan, who used to work initially as a medical representative and then as a distributor, Chavda said.Indravadan allegedly sold the answer key to several candidates for Rs 5 lakh each in Vadodara and nearby areas.

And this despite the Centre allocating large sums for several schemes to boost farmer incomes. So what went wrong? TOI takes a look at the stress points hurting the sector.Two successive years of drought (2014, 2015) have taken a toll on the farm sector. The government has allocated significant funds for the sector but slow implementation of projects has not eased the pain. Drought in Maharashtra, Gujarat and Karnataka have also added to farmers woes.Prices have collapsed for farm commodities. Low international prices have meant exports have been hit while imports have hurt prices at home. For example, there was a bumper production of pulses in 2016-17 but imports of nearly 6.6 million tonnes arrived, compounding the problem. In 2017-18, another 5.6 million tonnes flowed in, depressing domestic prices further. The government delayed imposing tariffs on imports, which heightened the problem of prices for farmers. According to a Niti Aayog paper, on average, farmers do not realise remunerative prices due to limited reach of the minimum support prices (MSP) and an agricultural marketing system that delivers only a small fraction of the final price to the actual farmer.The Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana was launched in 2016 to provide insurance and financial support to farmers in the event of failure of any crops due to natural calamities, pests and diseases. It was also meant to stabilise the income of farmers and ensure they remain in farming. But the scheme has seen lower enrolments due to a string of factors, including high premiums and lack of innovation by insurance firms.Irrigation is crucial for the farm sector, where large tracts of land still depend on monsoon rains. The Centre launched the Rs 40,000-crore Long-Term Irrigation Fund, operated by the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (Nabard). Under this programme, 99 large irrigation projects were to be completed by December 2019 but the progress so far has been limited. Experts say a number of factors, including bureaucratic delays and slow implementation by states, have hurt progress for this crucial input.According to a Niti Aayog document, farm sector development has ignored the potential of marketing. Archaic laws still hobble the sector. Access of farmers to well-developed markets remains an issue although several initiatives have been launched to develop an electronic market place. Reforms to the APMC Act have been slow and most states have dragged their feet on it. Experts suggest an entity such as the GST Council to bring together states and the Centre to jointly take decisions to reform the sector and provide better access to markets for farmers. According to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the combination of market regulations and infrastructure deficiencies leads to a price depressing effect on the sector.Introduction of latest technology has been limited due to a number of reasons. Access to modern technology could act as a boost to productivity through improved variety of seeds, farm implements and farming technology. According to a Niti Aayog paper, there has been no real technological breakthrough in recent times.Large gaps in storage, cold chains and limited connectivity have added to the woes of farmers. It has also added to the significant post-harvest losses of fruit and vegetables, estimated at 4% to 16% of the total output, according to the OECD.This has meant that there is little incentives for farmers to diversify. According to an OECD document, share of high-value sectors in food processing is low with fruit, vegetable and meat products accounting for 5% and 8% of the total value of output compared to cerealbased products at 21% and oilseeds at 18%A government-appointed panel had recommended that FCI hand over all procurement operations of wheat, paddy and rice to states that have gained sufficient experience in this regard and have created reasonable infrastructure for procurement. These states are Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh. It had suggested a complete overhaul of FCI and recommended that farmers be given direct cash subsidy (of about Rs 7000/ha) and fertiliser sector deregulated. The panel had said direct cash subsidy to farmers will go a long way to help those who take loans from money lenders at exorbitant interest rates to buy fertilisers or other inputs, thus relieving some distress in the agrarian sector. The report has been put in cold storage.The share of the farm sector in GDP has declined from 29% in 1990 to about 17% in 2016, but it remains a major source of employment. According to OECD data, 85% of operational land holdings are less than 2 hectares and account for 45% of the total cropped area. Only 5% of farmers work on land holding larger than 4 hectares, according to the Agricultural Census, 2016. Productivity lags other Asian economies such as China, Vietnam and Thailand and average yields are low compared to other global producers. Wheat and rice yields are nearly 3 times lower than world yields while those for mango, banana, onion or potato are between 2 and 7 times lower than the highest yields achieved globally, according to the OECD."

Over 130 food stalls from 26 states are spread, rather randomly, across the complex.You can end up gorging on the regular and the familiar  pao bhaji, masala dosa, aaloo tikki, chholey bhature, pizza, momo, chowmein, honey chilly potato  and miss out on the joy of being surprised.How about Jaipurs tandoori chai? Watching it being prepared and served is a fascinating experience. Or, eating pathar ka gosht, chunks of chicken cooked on stone.Theres much more, if your palate enjoys the thrill of the unusual. At stall 43, you can wolf down Malabar snacks such as meat pathiri (fried pastry filled with chicken), chicken cutlet and chicken cake, which looks and feels more like a quiche. Then theres kilikoodu (birds nest), a famous iftaar dish of the region, which wasnt available in the evening but stall owner Mohd Ali of Calicut promised to serve it during the weekend.To counter the general perception that street food is unhygienic, National Association of Street vendors of India (NASVI) organised a day-long programme on hygiene and cleanliness.About 500 vendors attended the training conducted by FSSAI. At the festival, all vendors and cooks wore plastic gloves.One of them was Sanjiv Gupta, who makes uncommon omelettes, some as large as an eight-inch pizza. His cheese-chicken omelette (Rs 240) is a complete meal. Setting up a stall at a food festival like this establishes your identity, makes you known to a wider group of people, says Gupta, who owns a stall in Dwarka-7.Some years back, litti-chokha used to be a top draw in the Bihar pavilion at the annual trade fair because it wasnt readily available in the capital. That was then. Now Bihars most well-known dish is served both in modest pushcarts and swish restaurants across the city. But Devi Prasad of Patnas Kanker Bagh colony has come up with a sizzling non-vegetarian variation of what was once a poor mans staple: chicken-litti. In Prasads concoction, the litti and the chicken are not offered separately but sloshed together in a fierce curry on a hotplate and served for Rs 180 at stall 55. I sell one quintal of chicken every day between 4pm and 9.30pm in Patna, he says.Patori, served with kadhi, is a popular snack in Nagpur. Prakash Vyas (stall 78), who has brought the dish to the festival, explains what makes it different, if not special. Patori is a deep-fried pastry stuffed with coriander leaves, peanuts and sesame seeds. Its a rare dish that serves coriander leaves as a stuffing rather than as a chutney, says Vyas.An Afghan stall provides international flavour. Mantoo, the Afghan variation of the momo, is topped with curd and split chickpea lentil (chana dal). It is on offer along with kabuli, the traditional Afghan pilaf served with raisins.An interesting sidelight is Bapus Thali, four items that Mahatma Gandhi loved to eat. For Gandhi, food was about fulfilling a need, not satiating a desire. One should eat not in order to please the palate, but to keep the body going, he once said. At the festival, theres a small exhibition outlining his philosophy of nutrition. To summarise it in five simple points, it goes: Eat to live, raw is good, eat more greens, whole grain is good and chewing is essential. Between 1 and 3 pm, you can sample Bapus thali for Rs 60. It comprises four dishes: Gujarati snack muthiya, sprouts cutlet, millet khichadi and ragi-teesi laddoo, with jaggery as a sweetener."
