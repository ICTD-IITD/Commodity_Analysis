As potato farmers are staring at heavy losses due to drop in demand and prices, the state government held a high-powered meeting to help them deal with the slump.The CM, who chaired the meeting, suggested that inmates in all the state jails should be fed potatoes. Another idea was to serve potatoes to schoolchildren, under the government-run midday meal programme, to add to their calorie intake. The state authorities discussed the issue after leaders of farmers unions had sought their help.Low-key affairAfter the state assembly polls, Punjab deputy chief minister Sukhbir Singh Badal and his wife, Union food processing minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal, made their first visit to Amritsar on Saturday and attended the monthly bhog ceremony of akhand path at the Golden Temple.Unlike their previous trips, their outing remained low profile this time. Whenever the deputy CM was in the holy city earlier, the administrative top brass of the district used to be in attendance besides the entire local Akali leadership. However, neither any senior official nor any prominent local leader of the Shiromani Akali Dal accompanied the couple this time. The duo also showed less interest in talking to reporters.Beyond promisesIn the high-stakes poll battle for the Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee, the Shiromani Akali Dal (Badal), in its manifesto released last week, went overboard in making promises. The promises ranged from more schools and dispensaries to free education to more Sikh children.The party also listed promises it made and fulfilled. But one section titled Jo nahee kaha si, oho vee kita (What was not promised, but still accomplished) caught everyones attention. It included rescue operations carried out after Nepal earthquake and floods in Kashmir, and help given to farmers of Pehowa in Haryana to get their lands back from the state government.Foolproof formulaHaryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattars supporters in his assembly constituency of Karnal were upset over the indifference of district authorities to their genuine demands. But they have now found a way to get themselves heard.The formula, according to a local leader of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), is to invite the CM to their residence. Once officials of the district administration find out about the CMs visit, they take their demands seriously and take no time in completing all pending works, he said. The roads get repaired and painted, potholes are filled up and other issues taken care of.Chinks in Chautala clan?The much-hyped Jal Yudh (war for water) of the opposition Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) in Haryana, which ended with the arrest of its leaders, including Abhay Chautala, on Thursday was seen as the launching pad of Abhays son Arjun Chautala into politics.It was the first state-level programme in which Arjun had actively participated and went to jail along with other senior leaders of the party. However, the absence of family members of Abhays elder brother Ajay Chautala, who is in jail in teachers recruitment case, was the talking point throughout the day-long protest.Neither Ajays MLA wife Naina Chautala, nor their two sons, Hisar MP Dushyant and Digvijay, were seen at the rally. Dushyant told reporters on Sunday that he and his brother were abroad as per a pre-decided programme.Preparing for poetic politicsHimachal Pradesh chief minister Virbhadra Singh will present the general budget for financial year 2017-18 on March 10. The CM holds the finance portfolio and his budget speech lasted two hours last year. But it may be even longer this time.Officers of the finance department are making extra efforts to create a record of sorts in the state assembly, trying to incorporate just about everything.A special officer has been deputed to incorporate couplets and quotations. The officer has sent a message on WhatsApp to his friends, asking them to send best of Urdu couplets that can be used to hit out at the opposition.AAPs hilly dreamsThe Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) lacks an organisational setup in Himachal Pradesh, but its supporters showed a lot of enthusiasm during the assembly elections in neighbouring Punjab.A number of its supporters had travelled to Punjab and spent there a month, canvassing for the party candidates. On their return, they are not only eagerly awaiting the poll results, but also visiting different villages and looking for prospective candidates, hoping that the party may enter the fray in the hill state, where the elections are due later this year.(Contributed by Gurpreet Singh Nibber, Surjit Singh, Rajesh Moudgil, Neeraj Mohan and Gaurav Bisht)"

The proposed systems biggest advantage is that it can track actual purchases by the final buyer.Buoyed by its landslide win in the recent Uttar Pradesh assembly elections, the Narendra Modi government has decided to fast-track the implementation of the direct benefit transfer (DBT) system for payment of fertiliser subsidy to farmers.From the coming kharif season, beginning June, the Rs 70,000-crore fertiliser subsidy budgeted for 2017-18 will be disbursed to companies based on actual sales to farmers captured on point-of-sale (POS) machines installed at nearly two lakh retail points across India.This would be a significant change from the current system, where firms are paid the subsidy on receipt of their fertiliser at the railhead point or any approved godown of a district. Prior to this, till October 2012, they were getting the subsidy on despatch of material from their respective factories.From kharif 2017 onwards, we are moving to disbursal of subsidy only after sale to the farmer takes place. The farmers identity will be verified through Aadhaar-based biometric authentication, voter ID or Kisan Credit Card. The sale transaction as well as buyer details would be captured in the POS machine installed at the retailers end and connected with a central server, a Department of Fertilisers official told The Indian Express.The proposed subsidy-post-sale system  as opposed to after receipt-at-district or despatch-from-plant  is already being implemented as a pilot scheme in 17 districts. They include UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanaths home district of Gorakhpur; Kishanganj and Begusarai (Bihar); Dhanbad (Jharkhand); Hoshangabad (Madhya Pradesh); Pali (Rajasthan); Nashik and Raigad (Maharashtra); Narmada (Gujarat); Krishna and West Godavari (Andhra Pradesh); Ranga Reddy (Telangana); Tumkur (Karnataka); Thrissur (Kerala); Karnal and Kurukshetra (Haryana); and, Una (Himachal Pradesh).We will have a nationwide roll-out of this system from June 1. Fertiliser companies have been given a deadline of May 31 for procurement and installation of POS machines at all the 1.98 lakh-odd registered outlets selling to farmers. All transactions thereafter will have to be done through POS machines in order to be able to claim subsidy, the official said.The proposed systems biggest advantage is that it can track actual purchases by the final buyer. A farmer growing wheat or paddy may apply up to three 50-kg bags of urea, one bag of di-ammonium phosphate (DAP) and half-a-bag of muriate of potash (MOP) per acre. That requirement could be more  say, three bags urea and 1.5 bags each of DAP and MOP per acre  for potato and sugarcane.But under the new system, it is possible to record transactions at individual farmer-level. If someone is buying 200 bags of urea, that person is more likely to be a plywood or particle board manufacturer than a farmer. Either way, he isnt deserving of subsidy.Neem-coating has already helped check illegal diversion of a highly-subsidised fertiliser towards non-agricultural use. The linking of subsidy payment to data generated at retail sale point leaves virtually no scope for diversion that is always possible from the godown or rail rake point, the official said. Nor can fertilisers be smuggled from border areas to Bangladesh or Nepal, since there will be no POS machines there for recording sales and claiming subsidy.The fertiliser industry has cautiously welcomed the proposed reform. I want this to succeed, as it is an important first step that should culminate in the subsidy being transferred directly to farmers bank accounts, which is what DBT is ultimately about, said Suresh Krishnan, managing director, Zuari Global Ltd, a leading urea and phosphatic fertiliser marketer.The industrys main apprehension is on the preparedness of retailers to accurately record not just farmers details and quantities purchased, but also the company/unit supplying the material in each case. The fact that fertiliser sales are also concentrated over just few months (June-August and October-December) of the year only complicates matters further. Add to this the possibility of the POS device not working due to network connectivity or signal strength problems, it could be a recipe for chaos during the peak agricultural season.We are also concerned over timely subsidy payment. As it is, the industry is owed Rs 40,000 crore of unpaid subsidy bills carried forward each year, entailing an annual interest outgo of Rs 4,000 crore for which there is no reimbursement. If payment of subsidy will now happen only after actual sale of material to the farmer, it will add to our working capital costs, said Satish Chander, director-general, Fertiliser Association of India.Under the proposed system, payment of subsidy is to be based on weekly settlement of claims from actual sales data captured on POS machines. The industry will be happy if it really happens that way. We have supported this scheme, so much so that the entire cost of procuring and installing the two lakh POS devices (about Rs 400 crore) is being borne by us. We only want that it should lead to the implementation of DBT in the true sense of the subsidy going directly to the farmers, said Chander.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Rohtang pass received over 20cm snow. The traffic on Manali-Keylong highway remained interrupted. Peaks of Kullu, Lahaul-Spiti, Kangra and Kinnaur were seen wearing a white mantle. While Keylong recorded minimum temperature of 2.6 degrees in the last 24 hours, Manali was cold at 6.2 degrees Celsius.Snowfall came as surprise for farmers of Lahaul, where vegetable crops worth lakhs of rupees are likely to get damaged. With the melting of snow and higher temperature, they had started cultivating cabbage, cauliflower, broccoli, peas, potato and many other varieties. Dinesh, a farmer from Shansha village of Lahaul, said that, ""Cabbage and peas have been damaged after snowfall. I shall have to cultivate it again. Farmers have suffered huge losses."" Another farmer Prem from Jahlama village said he had cultivated peas, cauliflower and lilium (flower) on five bighas,which has rotten after the snowfall.According to the meteorological centre, Shimla, the minimum temperate at many places in Himachal was below the normal temperature at this time of the year. There is prediction of more snowfall on high hills in the next few days."

The UNI canteen on Rafi Marg was a particular favourite of mine. We used to live in the building next to that of the news agency, so breakfast often meant a plate of idli with sambar and chutney at UNIs open air canteen. Some afternoons I used to stroll down there for a plate of lemon rice or curd rice, pickle on the side, and evenings meant a plate of besan coated potato fries or a crisp vada.The PTI canteen, on the side of the road from where we lived, was not that exciting. I did go there now and then, and had a dosa or some upma, but the fare at the UNI canteen, we all agreed, was far better.Then, of course, we moved out of Rafi Marg. The last time I went to the UNI canteen some years ago, I found that it was not being run by the rotund Swamy we were familiar with, but somebody from Himachal Pradesh. And my last visit to the old PTI canteen (James canteen, it was called) would have been sometime in the late eighties.Actually, I did go there a few days ago, but this time it was to a brand new canteen that has just opened up in PTI. Apparently, its not a canteen, but a caf  PTI news caf. It is on the ground floor of the PTI building on Parliament Street. It caters to the news service housed in the same building, but is open to the public, too, from 8 in the morning till 10 at night.I found a lot of office-goers from the neighbourhood when I went there around lunch time. We had thought wed have a special thaali (Rs. 100) with a plate of chicken (Rs. 100), but it was a Tuesday, so I was told by the man at the counter that there was no chicken on the menu. So we had the special thaali and a plate of idli.I must say it was rather nice. The helpings are large, and the thaali consisted of two tandoori lachcha parathas, paneer, kadhi pakori, bhindi, raita, salad and rice. The parathas were excellent  crispy on the outside, and soft within. The pakori was prepared with spinach and besan, and was pretty good. The paneer, in a light tomato-based gravy, was mildly spicy, while the bhindi, a bit too mashy, reminded me of home. The idli was soft, the sambar was fresh and the coconut-dal chutney wasnt bad either.I am told the evening snacks there are excellent  the samosa is crisp and flaky, and the stuffing of potatoes is tasty without being overly spiced. The aloo bonda, again, has a nice crisp casing, and a stuffing of spiced, mashed aloo. The samosa and bonda are for Rs. 12 a piece, and come with coriander chutney.The menu is a comprehensive one, and has dishes such as chholey bhaturey, rajma chawal and chicken biryani on it. But there was no chicken that day, as I said, and chholey bhaturey and rajma chawal werent a part of the days menu, a helpful gentleman at the counter informed me.I saw that the menu listed moong dal halwa. So I rushed to get some, only to be told that there were no desserts that day. But I suppose since it has just started, they will face some teething trouble. And the lunchtime crowd can get a bit chaotic.Like old Arnie, I shall return. But I will make sure that its not on a Tuesday."

5a0d8dd69855b76bf13d01a4,Vendors warn of acute shortage of tomatoes,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/vendors-warn-of-acute-shortage-of-tomatoes/articleshow/59763290.cms,2017-07-26,"NEW DELHI: While tomato prices are threatening to go up even further in Delhi, having already touched Rs 100 per kg this season, vendors in the Azadpur Mandi warn of an acute shortage of this vegetable in the next few days. The reason they cite is illegal occupation of some sheds in the wholesale market because of which several tomato traders have been sitting on a dharna.""We have been protesting for the past six days and met labour minister Gopal Rai on Tuesday, asking that the illegal occupation of our sheds be stopped. However, we have been given no assurances and on Friday, we will go on strike,"" said Anil Malhotra, general secretary of the vegetable traders' association.On Tuesday, about 2,000-2,500 tonnes of tomatoes arrived at the mandi against a normal arrival of about 12,000-16,000 tonnes. Sources said there was a country-wide shortage of tomatoes due to heavy rain in several states and only produce from Himachal Pradesh was reaching Delhi. ""Tomatoes sold for Rs 70-80 per kg in the mandi on Tuesday, which means that in the retail market, one can expect prices to rise to Rs 110 or even Rs 120 in the coming two-three days,"" warn a trader.While the shortfall was expected, the agitation by tomato traders has resulted in an even lesser arrival of tomatoes, said Metha Ram Kriplani, another trader. ""On July 20, APMC issued notices to companies that have illegally occupied seven tomato sheds and two sheds of mausambi. That is a clear acknowledgement that their occupation of the said sheds is illegal. Despite that, no action has been taken against them till now,"" said Kriplani. ""We want our sheds back and want action against officials who have colluded with the encroachers. Unless the encroachment is removed, we will continue with our strike on Friday.""Minister Rai said that he met representatives of both camps on Tuesday and the best solution that he had for this problem was to reallocate the sheds. ""If one camp is claiming that the other has occupied sheds illegally, then this is how sheds have been occupied in the mandi for years. I have spoken to officials as well and now the allotment will be on the basis on payment of market fees. Space will be allocated in proportion to market fees paid. The same exercise had to be carried out with the potato and onion traders as well,"" he added."
5a0f51649855b76bf13d7e3f,are vegetable prices soaring?,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/are-vegetable-prices-soaring/article19527329.ece,2017-08-20,"What happened in July?July saw a rise in inflation at the wholesale level to 1.88% from 0.9% in June, with the spiralling tomato prices, along with other food items, contributing significantly to this rise. Tomatoes saw a sharp inflation of over 209.5% in July against contraction of 29.4% in June, according to data from the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy. Brinjal registered a rise in inflation to 21.1% in July, from Junes contraction of 3.1%. The prices of tomato, onion and potato have increased in recent months owing to disparity between demand and supply on account of a drop in production because of unfavourable weather, a rise in transport costs, seasonality and supply chain constraints.Why is supply low?While the rise in the retail prices of tomato is being associated with low supply from key growing States, including Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh and Karnataka following heavy rain in a few regions that damaged the crop and hindered transport as well, onion prices have seen a rise on account of low supply from the southern States.The fluctuation in vegetable prices, which is commonly referred to as seasonal, is associated with the economics of demand and supply. The Centre maintains that seasonal fluctuations in market arrivals have hit supplies. The other reasons for the fall in supply are adverse weather conditions and imperfections in marketing channels. However, the clash of interests between the consumer, the producer and the middlemen is a key factor that policy-makers must urgently address.Where is the problem?For years, the consumer, the producer (farmer) and the middleman have had a clash of interest when it comes to agricultural commodities. While the consumer wants to buy a commodity at the lowest price, the producer (farmer) desires to sell the produce at the maximum price. The middleman, on the other hand, wants to maximise profits. Striking a balance among these stakeholders could possibly address the issue of price fluctuation to some extent. Vegetable producers, especially small landholders, depend on intermediaries to sell their produce. As vegetables find their way to the market, the cost of packaging, grading, transporting and fees, besides the margins of the middlemen, are some of the elements that determine the final price the consumer has to bear.Will better storage help?Agricultural commodities with a short shelf-life are prone to price fluctuation and hence require better infrastructure for marketing.Economists like Prof. M.S. Sidhu at Punjab Agricultural University believe that improved transport and upgraded storage infrastructure will keep a check on price volatility. Indias cold storage capacity at present is nearly 3.5 crore tonnes, which is short by 30-40 lakh tonnes, and it needs to be increased. Besides, cold storages need to be upgraded, equipping them to store fruit and vegetables at right temperatures so that they stay fresh.Also, the high cost of transport needs to be addressed. In the case of perishable vegetables, the government could consider promoting low-cost refrigerated trucks and weigh the option of freight subsidy.According to an estimate, there are 7,000-8,000 refrigerated trucks plying in India, mostly transporting pharmaceuticals and dairy products. Transport of perishable vegetables in refrigerated trucks could be one of the options that would help in better supply and availability of the produce.What about the supply chain?The mismanagement in the supply chain is another reason for the huge gap in prices that growers sell perishable agricultural commodities for and what the consumer pays. Creation of co-operative groups and societies are probably an alternative that could assist in minimising the marketing channel. They can work in tandem across the States and supply vegetables from surplus regions to places where the produce is in demand.Most farmers in India have small landholdings. Nearly 85% farmers are small, who have less than 2 hectares. Cultivation has become unviable for these small farmers, but through cooperative groups and societies even a small quantity of crop produced by the farmer can be marketed. This will stabilise prices and benefit consumers.VIKAS VASUDEVA"
5a1546da9855b76bf13ecd46,Narendra Modi’s popularity endures despite economic strife from demonetisation,http://www.livemint.com/Politics/4lRcRWkcPglpSkHHremL0M/Narendra-Modis-popularity-endures-despite-economic-strife-f.html,2017-11-07,"Gujarat will be a key test, where voters will be called on to weigh Prime Minister Narendra Modis personal popularity against his policies. Photo: Pradeep Gaur/MintNew Delhi: When Prime Minister Narendra Modi voided almost all of Indias cash last year, Kuldeep Mishras savings were turned into worthless paper. The vegetable wholesaler was forced to spend hours in bank queues and his business suffered for a month.Still, he voted for Modi in state elections soon after and plans to do so again in a national poll due 2019.Wealthy people had black money and it all came out, Mishra said in a market in Sahibabad in Uttar Pradesh, one of Indias poorest states, using the local term for cash stashed away to avoid taxes. We have never had a better prime minister than Modi.Mishra, 49, says sales rebounded in a month, though official data show Indias expansion slowed to a three-year low in April-June, more than six months since the shock cash ban. Growth has also been affected by the disruptive roll out of a new sales tax, yet voters like Mishra are expected to vault Modi to power in his home state of Gujarat next month.Theres no single reason for Modis enduring popularity. While critics point to the Hindu nationalist agenda of his Bharatiya Janata Party as key to its electoral success, others say demonetisation fortified Modis reputation as an authoritative leader and undermined the oppositions attempt to paint him as a suit-boot government that favours the business elite over the poor by moving to make it easier to buy farmers land and hire and fire factory workers.While many accept that the move has dampened consumption, they believe it has dampened conspicuous consumption that was fuelled by black money and tax evasion, said Reshmi Khurana, Singapore-based South Asia head for Kroll Inc., a risk management firm that advises foreign investors. It did boost his image in the sense that hes being seen as decisive and willing to take bold action, even if it ruffles the feathers of entrenched stakeholders.The view is echoed by Vinod Kumar Gupta, a businessman in Uttar Pradeshs Ghaziabad district, who said Modi has the courage to take bold decisions. He has become a stronger leader, hes making India stronger, said Gupta, 73. His commitment to the nation is not doubted.Key testGujarat will be a key test, where voters will be called on to weigh Modis personal popularity against his policies, which have disrupted Indias vast informal economy that mainly deals in cash and creates the largest number of jobs. While India lacks adequate employment data, surveys suggest that Modis far from creating the 10 million jobs a year needed to keep up with his young and rapidly expanding workforce.The election in Gujarat, held on 9 and 18 December will follow the 9 December vote in the Himalayan state of Himachal Pradesh, which Modi is expected to wrest from the main opposition Congress party. The positive opinion polls are partly flattered by the fact that the Congress party and its leader Rahul Gandhi have failed to offer a compelling alternative.Rahul Gandhi is not very strong, he doesnt speak well and he lacks knowledge, said Shamshad Mohammed, a potato seller who said demonetisation pummeled the economy without stopping corruption.Though viewed as a landmark anti-graft move by the masses, many businesses viewed demonetization as an ineffective way to tackle endemic corruption, said Krolls Khurana. Modis also facing stinging criticism from within his own party, with a former BJP finance minister saying the government has made a mess of the economy.Aware of this change in mood, Modi has been countering with emotional and combative speeches, defending demonetization and himself as a champion of the poor. In a series of speeches last month, he said the Congress party tried to stall Gujarats growth during the years that he headed the state, from 2001 to 2014.He packaged demonetisation as a pro-poor and anti-rich move by projecting that he was going to take away black money from the rich and distribute it to the poor, said Arati Jerath, a New Delhi-based author and political analyst. As economic distress set in, his stature has diminished.She reckons Modi is benefiting from a lack of credible data to assess the full impact of demonetisation on the informal economy and the Gujarat elections will reveal sentiment on the ground.Milan Vaishnav, director of the South Asia program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said that any upside to demonetization will come only in the long-term, through greater digitization of the economy, shrinking of the informal sector, and a wider tax base.Back in Uttar Pradesh, several old men sitting in the shade near tethered water buffaloes said demonetisations harmful impact was over. Discussing the previous evenings news that India had moved up the World Banks ease of doing business ranking, they said they would continue voting for the BJP.Its not that all of Modis policies are good, said Mahendra Singh, 76, a retired factory worker. But well give him another chance in 2019. Bloomberg"
