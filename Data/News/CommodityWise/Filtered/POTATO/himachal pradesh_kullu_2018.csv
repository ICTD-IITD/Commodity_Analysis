Rain upto 22.6 mm was recorded in various parts of Chandigarh. The temperature dropped till 18Celsius from a maximum of 33.7C on Sunday.Humidity between 50-70% is expected in the region on Monday. The Indian Meteorological Department said more rain on Monday was unlikely although isolated spells of light rain will be experienced throughout the week. The in-charge of IMD Chandigarh, Suresh Paul, said, The temperature is also set to fall and the maximum temperature of the day will come down to 30C.This rainfall and drop in temperature was also seen in Chandigarh last year. In fact, last year on this date, the temperature ranged between 32.5C and 16.6C, which is lesser than the 33.7C to 18C recorded by IMD on Monday.The weather turned pleasant following the rain, which lasted for around one hour. The sky however, remained overcast.It was quite dark when we were leaving for school on Monday morning. The rain came soon after. It was very pleasant, Jaskaran, a Class 10 student of a private school, told IANS.Not so merry for farmersDoaba Continuing strong winds and rain from late Sunday night to Monday morning lashed parts of north India, adding to farmers woes and delaying harvesting of rabi crops.Agriculture experts in the region said such sudden change in weather was indeed worrisome for the farmers as it brought down the standing wheat crop in several places.Heavy rain continued in most part of Doaba region on Monday morning. If the rain continues for the next few hours, about 10% of the wheat crop could face yield loss, the experts added.I have asked the field officers to report from their areas to know about the exact damage to the crop. In most of the areas, crop have been flattened and it will delay harvesting, agriculture officer from Doaba Naresh Gulati said.A farmer from Jalandhar, Amanveer Singh, said most of the crop on his two acre land was down following rain and hail. Such weather will reduce the yield by two to three quintal per acre. The crop was ready for harvesting and the losses will be huge, said another farmer Hardev Singh from Kapurthala.Majha Although the weather remained cloudy in Majha on Sunday night with wind and showers reported from some areas, the sun shone in the morning on Monday.However, there were some reports of damage o crops from the areaFor Monday, the maximum temperature will remain at 36Celsius and the minimum at 22Celsius. However, it is expected to fall by four or five degrees on Tuesday with moderate or heavy rain, as per the forecast of meteorological department.An agriculture expert, Dr Partap Singh, said rains are harmful not only for wheat, but also for vegetables and potato crop as dry weather and high temperature is the present requirement.He said the farmers should not water wheat crop as rain is forecast from Tuesday to Thursday this week.Patiala The agriculture department has rushed its teams to different areas to access damage to crops.Not only the standing crop, but even wheat yield unloaded at purchasing centres will also suffer an increase in moisture level due to the rains. Chief agriculture officer Arvinder Singh said farmers cannot harvest the crop till the fields get dry.Hail batters apple orchards in HimachalShimla In the last 24 hours, rainfall, thunderstorm accompanied by hail battered the cash crops in parts of Himachal Pradesh.Capital town Shimla, apple growing districts  Shimla, Mandi, Kullu  have been receiving rain, accompanied by sleet, hails, thunderstorm, high velocity winds, for the last 24 hours, causing damage to apple blooms in many areas. Kotkhai is one of the worst affected regions in the state.In the last one week, it is the third time that hail has pounded apple orchards in the region, said NR Thakur, an apple grower of Kullu district.In lower and mid hills, apple is at the blooming stage and low temperature, rain and hailstorm are going to harm the crop and impact the fruit adversely, said horticulture expert SP Bhardwaj.Parts of the state received light to moderate rain while heavy rain lashed some villages in the state.Heavy rainfall also partially damaged three houses in Jajaid village of Shimla district. There are also reports of minor damages to apple orchards and houses due to the current weather.Meanwhile, Shimla meteorological centre has predicted more rain in the next 24 hours. Till now, 5mm rainfall was recorded across the state. Light to moderate rains accompanied by hailstorm is likely in the next six to eight hours in parts of the state, said Shimla meteorological centre director Manmohan Singh. He said the day temperature has decreased by four to five degrees at various places.About the effect of rainfall on wheat, Manmohan said, The rainfall is likely to delay the wheat crop harvesting in low regions. Over mid-hill rainfall is beneficial because wheat is in the stage of milky to dough. However, in lower hills, it will have a negative effect as the crop is already mature.(with agency inputs)(to be updated)"

Two persons have been arrested so far.ADG (Narcotics) Varun Kapoor said, Use of codine laced cough syrup is prevalent in the North East, where it is used as a substitute for hard drugs, but this is the first time that we have come to know that Madhya Pradesh and especially Indore has become the transportation hub for these drugs.Officials said they seized these bottles from a truck being used for transporting the bottles and also from a godown in Lasudia area of Indore where it had been stored. These syrups had been sourced from a factory in Solan, Himachal Pradesh, then stored in the godown in Indore, from where it was being transported to North East.The cough syrups had been cleverly hidden behind sacks of onion and potato in the truck seized by the narcotics wing on April 9. Initially the police arrested the truck driver Mohanlal Pathak (54) resident of Indore. On the basis of information provided by him, police arrested Ranjan Shukla (29) also resident of Indore, who had loaded the truck from the godown. However, another crucial link, Manish Bhaskar, owner of Anmol Medical Store, who had rented the godown in his name is absconding.ADG Kapoor says that the investigations are still in a preliminary stage, but from the interrogation of the two accused we have come to know that smuggling had been going on for the past two years from Indore which is a major pharmaceutical manufacturing and transportation hub."

Follow us to track latest news, live updates, news analysis and cutting-edge data analytics. Track live election results , the big trends and fastest updates on counting day with India's largest news network.COIMBATORE: The Indian Council of Agricultural Research ( ICAR ) decision to shut down the Central Potato Research Institute at Muthorai in Udhagamandalam has sent shock waves among the scientific and agricultural research community in the region.The institute, which is known for its pivotal role in developing potato varieties resistant to cyst nematodes and white blight, is the only research institute for this staple vegetable in South India.The institute was founded in 1957 to serve the potato growing region in the hill station. The centre is known for its work in constantly developing pest-resistant varieties of potatoes. We are continuing to do so. A variety which does not get affected by pests will automatically provide a high yield, head of the institute Venkatasalam said.When crops get affected by pests like late blight and nematodes, it eats away almost 80% to 90% of their yield, he said. If they shut down this cesntre, this whole region will become sick again, he said.The centre, which has 12 permanent staff and around 60 to 70 contractual staff, is working on projects for quality seed production, different cropping systems and crop production.The institute is equipped with a hi-tech laboratory, seed production and multiplication facilities and 45 acres of land. We do not know what ICARs plans are regarding the institute and 12 research scientists, said another senior scientist. The only institutes from where farmers can get good quality seeds of resistant varieties are Jalandhar and Ooty . If they close this institute down, then Jalandhar will be the only option left and those seeds may not be well suited for the South Indian region, said Venkatasalam.The seeds we breed in this institute are more suited for this region, he added.Senior horticulture officer in Coimbatore Uma said even today with sale of potato seeds from Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand being banned because of the nematode problem, it is the potato research centre in Ooty that is being looked to for guidance because they have been dealing with the problem from 1961. They had advocated kufri giridari, a nematode resistant variety.During a review meeting conducted by the ICAR in October, they had reportedly taken a decision to ensure each crop had only one research centre and shut institutes studying crops which were not preferred, like tobacco.The regional centres included CPRI in Muthorai, Ooty. The decisions taken at the meeting came out through WhatsApp and reached us. But it is official. But we do not know the time frame, confirmed Venkatasalam."
