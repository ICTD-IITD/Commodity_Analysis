Last week, Bharatiya Janata Party minister Chandrakant Patil, who is public works department minister, had said that the APMC must ensure that farmers get proper price for their agricultural produce.Explaining the rationale behind putting up the proposal to the cabinet, industries minister Desai said: ""It is natural for the APMC or traders to oppose the move, but we thought of farmers and direct consumers. So, we will not back off,"" said Desai, expressing hope that the proposed draft is discussed and cleared within two or three weeks, so that it can be implemented.He also said that housing societies or residents can order vegetables or fruits directly from farmers as it be a mutually beneficial move. ""Consumers will get fresh farm produce while farmers will get a better price,"" said Desai.The Union government has proposed de-listing of fruits and vegetables, especially potato and onion, from the APMC regulation, which has been accepted by three statesMadhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka.After meeting APMC traders, Patil said they will consider traders' side and APMC should not lose out. He raised doubt that direct selling would eliminate cheating of farmers."

A good yield was expected this year but heavy rains induced by westerly disturbances flattened the wheat crop less than a month before harvest in Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh.The damage can be up to 50% in several districts of Haryana, Punjab, northern Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh, an agriculture ministry official said, adding that state governments had been asked to submit reports.Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal ordered divisional commissioner A Anbarasu to assess the damage to crops in the Capital. Have asked Div Commissioner to assess damage to crops of farmers in Delhi due to unseasonal rains (sic), Kejriwal tweeted.The governments of Madhya Pradesh, Haryana and Rajasthan also instructed officials to assess the loss.In 2015, the Centre gave states about Rs 8,000 crore for crop losses due to unseasonal rains.In Madhya Pradesh, protesting farmers took a tractor trolley full of hailstones to the office of the SDM, Banda in Sagar district and a chakka jam protest was held on NH-86 near Banda on the Sagar-Chatarpur road to draw the administrations attention towards damage to crops.In Rohtak, Ram Chander, a Dalit farmer who had taken two acres of land on contract for Rs 25,000, said rain and thunderstorm had almost completely destroyed his wheat crop. There is not much left, he said, crying for government help.Farmer Kundan Lal Jatav of Ghatla village in Rajasthans Alwar district said with tears in his eyes that rain and hail ruined his entire mustard crop on seven bighas of land.The government needs about 62 million tonnes of grains, including wheat and rice, to ensure steady supply of food items under the national food security law. Good crops in 2014 had ensured adequate stocks but crop damage in two consecutive years can exert a burden on the buffer maintained by the Food Corporation of India.Experts say the government might not have enough buffer stocks to sell in the market to keep wheat prices under check.Apart from wheat, officials admit, there has been extensive damage to mustard, potato and peas in these states. The showers have withered the flowering of mangoes in Uttar Pradesh and apple, pears and apricots in Himachal Pradesh.Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi raised the issue in the Lok Sabha and asked the government to assess the crop damage and provide adequate compensation to the affected farmers.After the hailstorm and heavy rains, farmers of northern India are in distress. The government must act to give relief to farmers affected by crop damage, Gandhi said in the Lok Sabha.(With inputs from Jaipur, Chandigarh, Bhopal and Meerut)"

With rising mercury, the cost of food basket is on the rise too. Due to dwindling supplies in the dry season, vegetable prices have gone up. Some items are costing double or close to it as compared to prices just a week ago.A week's vegetable supply for a family of 3 to 4 now comes for Rs300 to 350, which is more than the minimum wages fixed by the state government for an unskilled labourer at around Rs225 a day.Even as summer is making vegetables costlier, it comes at a time when rates of pulses, especially tur dal, have settled but only on the higher side. There are chances of a further increase in tur prices. Despite fresh supplies, not much respite is expected in the rates of wheat too, say sources in this business. The dry spell in the neighbouring Marathwada region is also having a slight impact on vegetable rates in the city, say a section of traders.Traders at markets like Gokulpeth and Fule market say this is the beginning, and another 20 to 25% increase in vegetable prices is expected in the days to come. A bout of unseasonal rains may make it worse, with rates further shooting up due to supplies being disrupted after that.The rates of almost all the vegetables have gone up by Rs10 a kg on an average over the last week, with Rs40/kg being the average price of any variety. However, there are certain vegetables like beans or lady fingers which have doubled. Brinjals of the smaller variety, which were in the range of Rs5 to 10 a kg are now Rs35 per kg, say traders.Sushil Shambarkar, a trader at Gokulpeth, said large part of the supplies come from other centres during summer since local sources dry up. Prices of beans have touched a high because of supply hitches at Chhindwara in neighbouring Madhya Pradesh, which is the major source. The rates will further go up in the coming weeks, he said.""Nagpur gets its supplies from Jabalpur, Chhindwara, Bhilai, Nashik and even Bangalore, apart from nearby villages. Some vegetables like pumpkin, coriander and cauliflower come from Nanded in Marathwada too. But supplies have entirely dried up this year due to the drought there,"" said Vijay Sonare at Gokulpeth.Nanded and other neighbouring districts contribute 10 to 15% of the total supply in Nagpur, which makes a considerable impact on the local rates, said Adul Sattar, a broker at Fule Market.On the foodgrains side, tur dal rates, which made headlines last year once again spiked by Rs10 a kg. This week tur dal was in the range of Rs132 to Rs115 with the bulk dealers. In neighbourhood stores, it is going at Rs140 to 130 a kg with some branded tur dal priced at Rs250 per kg too. ""The rates have gone up because farm produce markets were closed due to March ending. There is a possibility of some respite in the next week but rates may ultimately firm up, keeping tur dal rates at the same level,"" said Pratap Motwani, secretary of Itwari Wholesale Grain and Seeds Merchants Association.The tur production this year is less than last year, when tur dal was priced at Rs200 a kg, which means rates may further go up, say traders.Wheat prices are ranging from Rs2,500 to 4,000 a quintal depending on the variety. Fresh arrivals were low due to unseasonal rains in parts of Madhya Pradesh. As a result, new supply has not made much an impact in lowering the rates, said Motwani. Rice has been stable at Rs2,750 to 4,600 a quintal, he said.OUR TAKEAt present, not a single vegetable is available at affordable price. Usually in this season, price of potato and onion go down. But this year, we have no relief. The vegetables are becoming more and more out of reach of the common man. We fear that a further increase in the prices of petrol and diesel will affect the vegetable price hike moreAsha Mathur, 38, housewifeOver the past few months, we have witnessed at least 30-40% rise in vegetable prices. At a time when middle class families are already struggling with rocketing prices of cereals, the high vegetable prices are hitting the family budget hard. Lower middle class families are forced to compromise when it comes to providing nutritious diet to kids. The government needs to come up with a solution to provide relief from inflated prices of basic commoditiesManjari Joshi, 40, businesswomanWith summer approaching, prices of vegetables are only going to increase more. It is tougher for vegetarian families as green vegetables are the only source of nutrition for them. Veggies like capsicum, spinach and 'methi' which people usually prefer to eat in summer are also very costly. From cereals, potato, tomato, onion and green veggies  if everything is going to be costly, how does one expect a common man to survive?Purnima Singh, 44, teacherThe demand for fruits and vegetables is more in summer as people prefer drinking fresh juices. Such inflated prices are affecting people from all strata. This year particularly, the costs are too much on a higher side. To beat the price hike, I feel the best solution will be to eliminate selling of vegetables through middlemen. Sellers should directly buy vegetables from farmers. This will prove cost-friendly for customers as well as will be profitable for farmersResmi Umesh, 37, HeadmistressHousewives everywhere are struggling to balance their household budget due to the spiralling inflation. Even vegetables like French beans, capsicum, ladiesfinger, coriander are quite high. If vegetable price was low, it would have at least neutralized the out of reach prices of tur dal and other pulses. The government really needs to bring down the budget of kitchen, especially of basic food itemsSheela Brahmankar, 50, govt employee"
,,,,,,,58f5d0fb7be9e01a17ca11ee,Why agri startups are blossoming,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/Why-agri-startups-are-blossoming/articleshow/51962194.cms,2016-04-24,"When Ranjith Mukundan quit his job at Wipro in 2011 after 15 years, farming wasn't on his mind. Bengaluru-born Mukundan and his four co-founders were exploring the Internet of Things space, the idea of connecting ordinary objects to send and receive data. They considered telemedicine, but decided against it since many MNCs were in the business.That's when one of the founders pointed to the problems in dairy management, inclcuding that milk stored in regular containers become non-consumable after a few hours. His uncle was an organic dairy farmer in Tiptur, a town 150km north west of Bengaluru, and had trouble managing his cattle and the supply chain. They liked the idea so Mukundan, now 41, and the team spent the next eight months at the dairy farm and also visited farms in Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab and Odisha. Their company, Stellapps, used their learnings to develop automated dairy solutions, and now works with milk cooperative societies such as Aavin, Milma and Tirumala. Its products are in 250 farms and are used by three lakh dairy farmers.Agriculture in India is a $370 billion sector, but there is little application of technology to improve productivity and lift millions out of poverty . Now, a clutch of entrepreneurs is looking out of their city offices to the countryside to change this.Bengaluru-based Flybird Agri Innovations places sensors in the soil to detect moisture content and control irrigation. It's installed sensors in 45 villages in Karnataka to help farmers in the drought-hit state optimize irrigation. The company is supported by Chennai-based Villgro, a social impact fund backed by Dell Foundation.Most companies faced resistance when they first set up their equipment. ""Our work exposed the malpractices of middlemen,"" says Mukundan, who is now recruiting sales people in Delhi and Gujarat.The company is looking to expand to allied sectors such as fisheries where perishabil ity is high. Despite the need for technological intervention, there's not much funding coming to startups in this sector.Funding for Indian agriculture startups declined to $56 million in 2015 from $123 million the year before, according to data from Tracxn, a startup activity tracking platform. In 2015, also a drought year, just 20 agriculture-related startups raised money , but $6 billion was invested overall in tech startups that year. Agriculture startups attracted less than 1% of the total.""The agri funds in the country are mostly early stage investors, and the startups struggle to raise subsequent rounds of funding, thus prolonging their scale up,"" says Hemendra Mathur, an investor in agri businesses and former managing director of SEAF India Investment Advisory .While overall inflation has been under control, food inflation is growing at 7%, indicating a mismatch of supply and demand. India imported corn after 16 years, and it has turned from an exporter to an importer of soya. ""The inflation translates into an additional `70,000 crore opportunity.The propensity for consumption is also going up. Droughts are an opportunity to develop various seeds and processes that help reduce water consumption without affecting productivity ,"" says Mathur.Investors tend to view agriculture as a risky proposition. ""Most investors don't understand agriculture. The strong gov ernment intervention in the sector along with the vagaries of nature accentuate the business risks associated with startups in the space,"" says Srikrishna Ramamoorthy , partner at Unitus Seed Fund, an India-focussed fund supported by Gates Foundation that invests in social impact enterprises. It has invested in agri startup Villfarm and is looking for more opportunities. Ramamoorthy says most small farmers are not willing to try technology , and even the large farmers find the equipment too expensive.""Very often, it is not whether the technology is available. The problem is whether there are India-specific solutions,"" says Mark Kahn, founding partner of Omnivore Partners, an agriculture technology focused fund. It is backed by diversified agri-business firm Godrej Agrovet, SIDBI and SBI among other financial institutions. It has invested in Stellapps and Ecozen, a micro cold storage facility that works on solar power and can be installed even in small farms.In a country where more than half of the population still survives on agriculture, fruit and vegetables worth $2 billion are wasted because of lack of supply chain management and cold storage facilities.""The big cold storage products of the west are not affordable for many Indians,"" says Kahn. He has investments in 11 agriculture startups, including Skymet, which analyses weather patterns and predicts risk in agriculture for every season.Kahn was earlier head of business strategy and mergers and acquisitions at Godrej Agrovet and found that most agritechnology startups struggle to raise funding. He convinced Godrej to anchor a fund to support more firms and thus Omnivores was founded in 2011 with a corpus of Rs 260 crore.The same year also saw the establishment of the SONG Fund by Thomas Hyland, a US citizen who came to India and travelled around the country in trains for a year. He then went on to do a management degree from ISB, Hyderabad, and established Song, backed by US billionaire George Soros, Omidyar Network and Google Capital. ""For a country of India's size, there are not enough startups that focus on technologies that addresses the lower middle class and bottom-of-pyramid solutions,"" says Hyland, who has since started a second fund Aspada.These funds work with the startups for several months before committing to investments. Hyland, for instance, worked with Pune-based SV Agri for eight months before investing. SV works with potato farmers in Maharashtra and Gujarat to improve productivity by providing better seeds, as well as working on supply chain and processing.It supplies potatoes to ITC, Marico and Pepsico for chips. ""Not many big companies or startups want to do backward integration when it comes to agriculture because they don't want to get their hands dirty ,"" says Hemant Gaur, founder of SV Agri.Rohtash Mal, a former CEO of tractor firm Escorts, has established EM3, which provides farm machinery vehicles on demand. ""Only 10% of the country's farmers can afford farm machinery and ours is a pay-per-use model. We wanted to reach 90% of the farmers,"" says Mal, who has 15 centres in MP , Bihar and eastern UP . The price is based on the farmhold area measured using satellites. Each centre sends machinery to a 20km radius and Mal says 95% of his customers come back.""Government policies treat agriculture as a poverty alleviation method rather than a means to enhance productivity and raise incomes, and this keeps entrepreneurs out,"" says Mal.Mathur says that funds like Omnivore, Villgro and Aspada give him hope, and entrepreneurs are trying to start agri businesses. ""The slowdown in e-commerce and the entrepreneurial energy will spur a new wave in rural and agricultural innovation,"" he says."

The objective of this fund is to control price volatility, thereby protecting interest of farmers and consumers.Pulses and potatoThe fund is being used for creating buffer stock of pulses and potato also.We are aiming to buy 15,000 tonnes of onion this year. So far, nodal agencies Nafed and SFAC have procured 1,500 tonnes and 800 tonnes, respectively, Food Minister Ram Vilas Paswan told reporters.The storage quality onion has been purchased directly from farmers in the price range of Rs 8.50-9 per kg. The stock would be kept at Lasalgoan, he said.With onion prices ruling lower at Rs 2-3 per kg in Maharashtra, these two agencies are buying onion in the state to ensure support price to onion growers, he said adding that onion will also be procured from other growing states like Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh.The arrival of rabi (winter) crop of onion has began and and cooperative firm NAFED will buy in total 10,000 tonnes, while the Small Farmers Agribusiness Consortium (SFAC) will procure 5,000 tonnes.Hiring of godownsOn storage of onions, Mr Paswan said that onion procured from Maharashtra is being stored at Nasik and the nodal agencies have been asked to explore hiring of godowns in other States and even state governments have been told in this regard.A team has been sent to Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh to explore godowns for storage of onions, he added.Last year, the government procured 8,000 tonnes of onion but only after retail prices went through the roof.Import plansThis time, the Consumer Affairs Ministry has been asked to prepare timely import plans for pulses and onions. It has also been asked to intervene in the market on time so that consumers are not affected by price rise.Onion production is estimated to be increase to 20.33 million tonnes in 2015-16 from 18.92 million tonnes in the previous year, as per the Agriculture Ministry data.At present, retail price of onion is ruling at Rs 20 per kg in the national capital.

(Express photo by Neeraj Priyadarshi) Former Union HRD minister Kapil Sibal (right) with Chief of Bureau Maneesh Chhibber at The Indian Express office in Delhi. (Express photo by Neeraj Priyadarshi)Why Kapil Sibal?Kapil Sibal held the important portfolios of HRD and Telecom in the UPA government. The changes in education system brought in under him are now being examined by the Smriti Irani-led ministry. He remains one of the leading lights of the Congress and was recently nominated by the party, that is looking for strong voices in Parliament, for a Rajya Sabha ticket. A legal eagle, Sibal has returned to a successful practice and is leading the Gandhi familys defence in the National Herald caseKAPIL SIBAL: My biggest worry for the country is that an aspirational India finds itself in great difficulty. When we talk about our demographic advantage, the young people in this country find the education system not fully aligned to the market. Also, when they get out of the university, they cant get jobs. And remember there are about 12 million people who move out of the university into the job market every year. The maximum job creation was in 2009, with 1.2 million jobs as opposed to the 12 million required, and there has been a constant decline after that. So I wonder what those 12 million will do. Whatever you do in life, if its disengaged, its a perilous journey not just for them individually but for the nation. I think political parties must get together because remember, there is no quick fix to this.It must start from the education system; from the schools. But the education system cannot be tweaked unless you have teachers. Teachers dont come from the air unless you have institutions to teach. Having done that, you move up the school ladder and go to the universities. What is the kind of teaching you must have in your university? What kind of a market interface must you have with the educational system? Where are the jobs being created? Where in future will jobs be created? Then align the education system to that opportunity within the economy, and you will have a purposive India. I dont see that happening; I dont see political parties discussing this.WATCH: Idea Exchange With Kapil SibalI only see angst, a sense of destruction through verbal abuse, allegations without proof, (talk of) a Congress-mukt Bharat, as if that will save this country from the impediments ahead. Thats my greatest worry, and unless you fix this, there is nothing else that will be fixed.MANEESH CHHIBBER: The Modi government has completed two years and we all saw what happened at India Gate. So the impression that one got was that we are growing as a nation.I would love the nation to grow; I have no problem with that. I just have a problem with the statistics that he (PM Modi) has churned up. One of the statistics that he gave was of new ration cards  three crore. It is only 66 lakh. Then he said my Jan-Dhan (Pradhan Mantri Jan-Dhan Yojana), in the first 100 days, saw 21 crore accounts. The fact is 8.6 crore. He said we have given new LPG cylinders to crores of people, but actually its only 45 lakh. So if the Prime Minister of India, at India Gate, talks of statistics which are incorrect, then how do you trust our leaders?The Central Statistical Organisation is also giving out data which economists are now questioning. So you may tom-tom about yourself but the fact of the matter is what is on the ground, and we all see that.MANEESH CHHIBBER: The aam aadmi seems to be buying these statistics.If dal is Rs 200 (a kilogram), then how is he buying these statistics? His income has not increased. If vegetables are as expensive as they are now, and if one tonne of potato sells for one rupee, then what statistics are we talking about? And whats the feel-good factor on the ground? What worries me is that you may have a wonderful advertising campaign but the fact of the matter is that when the voter thinks about himself, hell ask the question to himself at the right time  Has my life improved?. For the last 17 months, exports have been on the decline; imports are on the decline. So whats on the up? Modi. Nothing else is on the up.MANEESH CHHIBBER: So how does the Congress party plan to expose the government?I think we must take this message to the people. I think the media also needs to investigate this at the same time. When he (PM Modi) gives a statistic for example he said in America that India is a $9 trillion economy, when were just about near 2 trillion. Now the press did not pick it up. So how do we deal with this? They repeat the same statistics. He goes to Kerala and compares us with Somalia. Of course he got some flak for that, but I think every time he makes a statement, for him its an election rally speech You dont act like the Prime Minister of India; you act as if youre an RSS pracharak. You spew venom and you give statistics thinking that its the next election. And then suddenly, one of them goes and has food at a Dalits house when hes not even a Dalit. You should remember Modis tweet on a previous occasion about this.COOMI KAPOOR: Why has the Congress not been able to capitalise on the failures of the Modi government? And the Congresss own position has come down in the last two years. It has lost its stronghold in Kerala, in Bengal, in AssamSince when did a government in Kerala win a second term? Thats the pattern. As far as Assam is concerned, were deeply disappointed about that, but how many chief ministers have got a fourth term in the history of this country? Hardly any. Our vote percentage in Assam is 31 per cent. I think where we might have gone wrong is with the alliances. In West Bengal, we have emerged actually as an alternative to the TMC, because in our alliance we have gained much more and were now leading the Opposition there. The DMK, I think, was a great disappointment because there the pattern also is the AIADMK and DMK. We could have won. I think again, if we had made some alliances, we might well have succeeded. But if you look at it overall, the BJP fought 696 (Assembly) seats (in all) and got 64, and we fought 335 and got 135.AMBREEN KHAN: Sonia Gandhi said the Prime Minister behaves like a Shahenshah. What does that imply?I think Arun Shourie put it very well in the course of his interview  narcissism, megalomania, trying to control the government, a statue at Madame Tussauds. They give you an indication of the persona of the Prime Minister. Giving out statistics without regard to the truth and basically concentrating everything in the PMO, not allowing his ministers the kind of freedom that was allowed during the UPA government these are personal traits of character wearing a name-printed striped suite and then auctioning it off. These are all very significant characteristics of a man who basically is in love with himself, which is not a bad thing, but in politics it may not sometimes succeed for a long period of time.LIZ MATHEW: Regional parties have been successful in keeping out the BJP to an extent. But why has the BJP managed to defeat the Congress so easily?If you go back to analyse the decline of the Congress party, I think we go back several years, to the compromises that we made with regional parties by sharing seats What happens in politics is that the moment you compromise for sharing of seats, then your entire cadre shifts from one party to the other, and thats the genesis of the decline of our regional presence.We did it in Uttar Pradesh, and see the consequences of it. We have not done it in Odisha but there the Congress has been a weak force for a long time. Luckily, we are now the alternative in West Bengal. I dont think we made a mistake because, had we gone with the TMC, we would have landed in a much worse position.SHALINI NAIR: The Prime Minister often raises the point that governance under the NDA, unlike the Congress regime, has been corruption-free.What are the charges of corruption against the Congress party during the UPA regime? It started in 2010-11 with the telecom issue. What was the corruption there? We did not sell the spectrum because the policy was not to sell. It may be right, it may be wrong, the Supreme Court ultimately said it was wrong, so you auction it. What is the result of that auction? That the very telecom sector which bought 5 Megahertz of spectrum at an administered price of Rs1,680 crore buys it for Rs 45,000 crore and that goes to the consolidated fund of India. Now, you will not call this a scam, because all this money has gone to the Government of India, which should have gone to the sector, so the result is that, by calling it a scam, and by reversing the policy, you have, in fact, destroyed the sector. The same with coal, nobody wants a coal mine anymore.RITIKA CHOPRA: In a recent interview, Smriti Irani said that during her predecessors regime, education had become a political akhada, states wouldnt see eye to eye, whereas she has achieved consensus.I dont want to react to what Smriti Irani says. I think the people of this country know how the education department is being run. Did we appoint RSS people or Congress-minded people as vice-chancellors of universities? Did we appoint people of a particular ideology as directors of IIT? Was there a controversy about the Prime Ministers degree? What about the corruption in Madhya Pradesh, the Vyapam scam? Is that not the BJP?AMITABH SINHA: As a former HRD minister, what is your opinion on Smriti Iranis tenure so far?Im not worried about individuals, Im worried about the change of textbooks, Im worried about the effacing of history, Im worried about a Vedic board being created. See, these are real worries. You tell Ramdev that you can have a private Vedic board in India so that our children get aligned to that ideology as they grow up. Im worried about that. Im not worried about Smriti Irani, Im worried about what she symbolises.LIZ MATHEW: After the rout in the recent state elections, some in the Congress have talked about surgery and changes in the party. What do you think is the way forward?Surgery of a political party will not change the future of India. We need to do a lot of things within the Congress party, but thats not enough. We are here for the nation, we are not here for the Congress. We are presenting an alternative, right? That may be an unacceptable alternative, to that extent we need to change, to provide a wholly acceptable alternative, and people who have voted against us, we must bring them back to our fold, to say that this is the only party that recognises the needs, the aspirations, and the pain of every Indian.SHEELA BHATT: Sonia Gandhi called the charges against Robert Vadra a conspiracy. But why make it political?Who says dont investigate? But you leak the email to the media, then you have the media play it up, that is what Mrs Gandhi is talking about. Your intentions are not to investigate in a fair manner, your intention is to besmirch the name, to have another way of saying you want to have a Congress-mukt Bharat. Who is stopping your investigation? Did we say dont investigate? Why dont they agree to an SIT under the Supreme Court? In all these allegations, have you found a single case where a Congress person has been convicted? This is all media stuff. You get something, you leak something, then you give a spin to it, then the Finance Minister writes a blog, then his people go up on television, then you create an atmosphere, and then you say he is corrupt. And when it comes to you, that piece of paper that names family members of the Chief Minister of Chhattisgarh and the money trail, then thats irrelevant.COOMI KAPOOR: Some people see similarities between Narendra Modi and Donald Trump. What is your opinion?Let Donald Trump fight the election then I will give you my opinion. But you have my opinion of Modi anyway.MANEESH CHHIBBER: Why is the Congress party always defending Robert Vadra and his alleged wrongdoings?The point is that he happens to be associated with a person who is part of the family of the Congress leadership. So when you make an allegation against him, in a sense you are making an allegation against the Congress party. If the Congress party does not respond, then you would say that the Congress party has accepted it. Fact of the matter is, if you make a false allegation, the person is entitled to say it is false.AFRAZ ALAM: This whole wave of admiration for Modis work has only increased in the last two years. Even if the people start rethinking about their decision to choose Modi, what is the alternative?You must know that there is an army out there, which is funded by a particular political party, which has enormous presence in the social media to serve a particular purpose. That army whenever I say something will attack me within two minutes, then they will praise Modi. It is a self-serving army which is part of the narcissism that I talked about. There is a lot of trolling against Modi today I bet that in the next two years, you will have an alternative. An alternative that will be far more compassionate, far more acceptable, far more inclusive and far less obsessed with himself or herself.ANANT GOENKA: Do you agree then there is a need for an internal organisational change in the Congress?There is no dispute that reform is needed. You ask us about the big idea, but Modi did not come with any big idea. It was lies, lies and damn lies. He was selling a dream and a person who looks forward to the next day for survival will buy a dream. So people of this country bought a dream.AMBREEN KHAN : So who will be able to sell the big dream in Uttar Pradesh?We should go back to the people of this country and say, We will not tell you lies, we will try and tell you what the reality is, believe us and give us a chance. All these guys have fooled you by telling lies, we will not do that. I think it is time for us to tell this to the people of our country.MANEESH CHHIBBER: We saw what happened in Uttarakhand and Arunachal Pradesh. What is your partys take on it?I think we need an amendment in the defection law. We should have a new law which says two things: first, that you are free to defect, but if you defect, you will not get a public position for the next five years. Even if you succeed in an election, you will not get a public position or ministerial post in the next five years. If you defect in the middle of your term, you will not be entitled to stand for elections in the middle of that term. If you do that, then this buying of people, horse-trading and all these shenanigans will stop. We should take off our political hat and think of the future of India. You cannot have a future that is bright when you have a party in power at the Centre destroying constitutionally elected governments in this completely amoral fashion. The other grave concern I have is (regarding) the investigating agencies, whether it is the NIA, CBI or Enforcement Directorate. These have by and large become tools in the hands of the dispensation which is in power.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

IAF has shot off a communique to state forest department to get rid of this innocuous enemy.Speaking to TOI, divisional forest officer, Gwalior, Vikram Singh Parihar, said, ""There are around 70 of them inside the airbase. IAF wants us to shift them to some other location. We have already had a meeting with them and another meeting will be held in next few days for remedial measures."" Forest department recommended IAF to raise height of their boundary wall to 8 feet or go for chain fencing. ""It's not easy to capture these animals given its herd size. Initially we advised air force officials to use chain link fencing or raise boundary wall,"" said the DFO.There had been several communications between IAF and state forest department on this matter in last four years. A letter was also sent on May 21 this year reporting the blue bull menace.Though there had been instances of blue bulls venturing onto the runway, posing a threat to the fighter jets during take-off and landing, defence spokesman Group Captain B B Pande told TOI that the menace is limited to the domestic area of Maharajpur airbase.""The technical (working) and operational area is completely free of blue bulls, but there are many in the domestic area. We have written to forest department to remove them from our premises for safety of people living there and have also assured them cooperation in operations,"" said Group Captain Pande. The only solution is to chase them out, he said.Forest department had been expressing helplessness, stating that rules allow killing or translocation of antelopes only if they damage crops. IAF had also carried out an aerial survey to find out the number of wild animals around the air base that led to mishaps in the past. Blue bulls also pose danger to movement of aircraft, but also vehicular traffic within the campus. Two persons on a two-wheeler were injured by bluebulls in the IAF premises a few days ago, said sources.A portion of IAF's Maharajpur airstrip is shared by Airports Authority of India (AAI) for parking planes. Blue bulls, said sources, move across the runway to the adjacent farm land of Central Potato Research Centre (CPRC), located close to the boundary wall of the airstrip. CPRC has farm area of 179.5 ha and is primarily engaged in seed production.This centre has two research programmes, including development of low-input technology for potato production and to work on stem necrosis diseases of potato. The bulls jump across the boundary wall to reach the farm. In 2003, IAF had come up with an unusual idea to check the menace at their Bakshi-ka-Talab air base on outskirts of Lucknow by using tiger excreta, obtained from the Lucknow Zoo. They littered it around the runaway after being informed that smell of tiger droppings will keep blue bulls away, but to no avail."

The anticipated ""recompense"" in the form of a Raj Bhavan posting did not come. The former Gujarat chief minister, who demitted office early this month, did not figure among the quartet appointed as governors today, with BJP sources hinting at several reasons for her absence from the list. The four who made it are Najma Heptullah, a former Union minister who has been assigned Manipur; V.P. Singh Badnore, a former Rajya Sabha MP from Rajasthan who goes to Punjab; Banwarilal Purohit, a former BJP MP from Nagpur and owner of the multi-edition newspaper The Hitavada, who moves to Assam; and Jagdish Mukhi, a Delhi BJP leader who will take charge in Andaman and Nicobar as lieutenant governor. Mukhi, a former professor, had aspired to be projected as the BJP's chief minister candidate in the last Delhi elections but was beaten to it by Kiran Bedi, who has since moved to Puducherry as the Union territory's lieutenant governor. After Anandiben left office as Gujarat's chief minister, BJP circles had expected her to be ""recompensed"" with a gubernatorial post. Sources said there were three reasons why she was not on the list. One, Anandiben had ""refused"" to leave Gujarat that votes in December 2017. She had publicly said so just before resigning as chief minister. A Gujarat BJP source, who made it clear that he was not aligned either with Anandiben or her adversary, party president Amit Shah, claimed the former chief minister was ""lobbying"" for her daughter Anar's induction into the party ""in lieu"" of her forfeiting her post. Anar, who describes herself as a ""social worker"" and an ""entrepreneur"", is alleged to have used the clout she derived from her mother's position to help her business associates set up a company on land near the Gir lion sanctuary, purportedly in contravention of established rules. The case, highlighted in sections of the media, became a hot potato for the BJP after the Congress gunned for Anandiben. It was believed to have precipitated her exit. ""In these circumstances, there is no way that Shah or the Prime Minister will facilitate Anar's entry into the BJP,"" the source said. Although Anandiben is considered a close political associate of Narendra Modi, sources said the Prime Minister had apparently taken a ""grim"" view of the Anar controversy. Since her departure, Anandiben, not exactly known to court publicity, has reportedly kept herself in the news. On August 15, she hoisted the flag at the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation's headquarters. Tomorrow, on ""Rakshabandhan"", she is scheduled to host a get-together at a school in her Assembly constituency, Ghatlodiya, in Ahmedabad. Two, Anandiben would have to resign as an MLA if she becomes a governor. A by-election will have to be held in her constituency within six months. Sources said the BJP fears that if it loses Ghatlodiya or even retains it by a margin lower than what Anandiben had secured in 2012, it could scale down the morale of party cadres in the run-up to the state polls. Three, the governors of two large states, Tamil Nadu and Madhya Pradesh, are due to retire by end-August. Both K. Rosaiah (Tamil Nadu) and Ram Naresh Yadav (Madhya Pradesh) were appointed in 2011 by the then UPA government. Sources said it was ""possible"" Anandiben might be sent to one of these states, after BJP leaders take into account the political factors, especially the by-election and the fear that her seat might go to the Opposition."

Contrary to belief in some quarters, agriculture is not a dying business. We have home-delivery in Bengaluru as of now and will soon expand to other cities . We also export and have access to 45 organic product outlets abroad.On 3.5 acres, he even offers experimental farming to his consumers so that they know how back2basics grows its vegetables.From fast-moving to farmN Balasubramanian, who graduated from the Institute of Rural Management Anand in 1989 and worked with the National Dairy Development Board, Godrej and some other food-related MNCs, always wanted to help small and marginal farmers. After having helped his friend Raj Seelam since 2004 in his Hyderabad-based organic products venture Sresta, he quit his lucrative job in the FMCG sector and joined Srestas start-up 24 Mantra Organic in 2010 as its CEO.We now have a network of 32,000 farmers producing 90 crops across 1.70 lakh acres in 15 States. We plan to expand to 1 lakh farmers and 5 lakh acres in the next five years.Explaining Srestas business model, he said the firm is not into contract farming. It helps farmers grow organic produce and pays market price for the produce. It currently markets across 145 cities in India, and has tied up with retail majors. It also has access to about 1,000 stores in 45 States in the US and has a presence in Singapore, Dubai and Mauritius.One-stop shopIndore-based Raman Singh Saluja has a slightly different story to narrate. For three years from 1995, he was into wind energy; moved to exporting potato and pulses to West and South Asia before he realised the gaps in supply chain in agriculture. This prompted him to start a web portal and supply-chain initiative called Gram Mandi.com but gave it up in 2000 due to APMC (Agricultural Produce Market Committee) laws and poor web connectivity. He then returned to his family business of metal trading before finally, founding a start-up in 2010.His rural solutions company Gramco Infratech offers farmers end-to-end services under one roof  from sowing to marketing end products, except selling machines. It helps farmers with seeds, fertilisers, bio-fertilisers, chemicals, water solubles, and warehousing. The company also has access to 250 acres of contract farming for soyabean and wheat in Madhya Pradesh. Farmers are free to market their products.We recently tied up with a fertiliser major. In the next three years, we plan to expand to 10,000 to 15,000 acres of contract farming.From growing organic produce to offering farming services, these professionals fill the gap in the sector"

As per the statements by Minister of State for Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution, Ram Vilas Paswan, the Act was to be fully implemented across India by July 2016. As of now, only five States have fully executed it as per the provisions of the Central Act and the progress in other States has been tardy. The front runners are Punjab, Haryana, Chhattisgarh, Maharashtra and Rajasthan. The Act has been partially implemented in Bihar, Delhi, Himachal Pradesh and Karnataka. Preliminary surveys undertaken in some of these States have revealed positive outcomes in terms of administrative reforms, significant increase in the number of households having ration cards, and improvement in the distribution and consumption of food through fair price shops. A few of them had already initiated reforming the distribution system much before the Act was presented in Parliament. The Act, if fully implemented, is likely to benefit 720 million people through availability of 5 kg per capita per month of subsidised foodgrains (rice, wheat and coarse cereals) at a much lower rate than that in the open market. This would ensure food security and enhance nutritional status.The Odisha studyThe two concepts are interlinked, but nutrition security has a much wider connotation than food security. It encompasses a biological approach, that is, adequate and safe intake of protein, energy, vitamin and minerals along with proper health and social environment. The nutritional aspect of the quantity of grain to be distributed to each person under the Public Distribution System (PDS) is somewhat less researched, though the Act has aimed at attaining this goal. Poor quality of food lacking essential micronutrients and no diet diversity, and unhygienic conditions of storage may come in the way. There are other promising features under the Act, such as free daily meals for children and maternity benefits, including cash for pregnant women, which can combat rampant undernutrition (calorie deficiency) and malnutrition (protein deficiency) across the country. These steps may perhaps complement the existing nutritional programmes such as mid-day meals and Integrated Child Development Services.We present results from a study in rural Odisha on the contribution of PDS towards households intake of foodgrains and the quantum of calorie and protein levels. A primary survey of 385 households was carried out during 2014-15 in three extremely poor districts viz. Koraput and Bolangir in the so-called KBK (most backward) region and Nayagarh in the non-KBK region. While KBK districts follow a universal PDS, non-KBK districts have a targeted one.There is high prevalence of undernutrition and malnutrition in the selected districts. The estimates, adjusted on the basis of age, sex and work as recommended by the nutrient requirements and dietary allowances of Indians drawn up by the Indian Council of Medical Research-National Institute of Nutrition in 2010 reveal the undernourished population to be 50 per cent and the malnourished to be 43 per cent on an average for all the districts together. Calorie and protein deficiency is relatively higher (see graphic), nearly 68 per cent among the Antyodaya Anna Yojana (AAY) households, known to be the poorest of poor. It is much higher in Koraput district at 72 per cent, way above the State average of 60 per cent.Rice is the key staple food in the surveyed areas and acts as a major source of energy intake. The monthly per capita consumption of rice is estimated to be 11.6 kg, of which 33.7 per cent is sourced from the PDS by all beneficiaries. Since AAY households have higher quota and accessibility under the PDS, the contribution is much more at 73.9 per cent. Cereals (wheat and rice) make up 70 per cent of the calorie intake and 66 per cent of the protein intake, though the magnitude varies across districts. More importantly, the contribution of PDS to energy intake among AAY households is double (60 per cent) that of other beneficiaries.Better accessibility to food and hence energy intake of poor people, especially those under AAY, has been made possible due to concerted efforts initiated by the government. Major reforms initiated from 2004-05 that are worth mentioning include abolition of private procurement and storage system, and a greater role for public agencies in controlling diversion of foodgrain from the godown to the millers; proper recording of procurement, storage and distribution of grains across the departments; and distribution of food through self-help groups and gram panchayats and its regular monitoring at the block and ward levels. While revealing their satisfaction with the PDS, the beneficiaries refuted the idea of having a cash transfer system in place of the existing in-kind transfers, primarily due to fear of price hike and inadequate infrastructure i.e. roads, banks, and long distance of market from the village. In fact, the beneficiaries proposed an increase in the coverage of commodities to pulses, onion and potato under the PDS in their respective areas.Replicating Odisha elsewhereThe efforts of the State government in ensuring food security should be replicated in States that are yet to fully implement the Act and reform their respective distribution systems. Many studies have emphasised on dietary diversification to ensure appropriate nutritional intake for large segments of the poor population. This may be an important step to be taken up in States where a revamped PDS is making ground, such as in Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Bihar. Provision has been made under the NFSA to provide one additional coarse cereal viz. millet along with wheat and rice, which can further enhance the nutritional security of the poor households. Though wheat and rice contribute significantly to energy intake, the time has come to increase our focus on coarse cereals and pulses to improvise adequate intake of protein. Serious deliberations are required to make this possible through the PDS, which is going to cater to a sizeable population in the near future. As elicited above, the AAY households have a greater access to PDS but the problem of undernourishment is more serious among them.As a prerequisite, it is imperative to hasten implementation of the NFSA across the country. States should be in a mission mode as availability of foodgrains may not be a problem this year. The Ministry of Agriculture has projected a record production of 270 million tonnes owing to good monsoon and an increase in acreage of foodgrains from 101 million hectares to 105 million hectares. The States must gear up to work on adequate logistics for digitisation of ration cards, computerisation of offtake and delivery of foodgrains, and effective monitoring of fair price shops, possibly through involvement of communities or other feasible ways. This will bring in greater transparency in the system and would go a long way towards raising the nutritional status of Indians.SeemaBathla is Professor and Bal Krishan Negi a Research Scholar at Centre for the Study of Regional Development, JNU, New Delhi.The Antyodaya Anna Yojana households have a greater access to PDS but the problem of undernourishment is more serious among them"

At the peak of the potato sowing season, the lack of new notes in the market is preventing potential buyers from purchasing supplies.There are buyers but they do not have the new currency. We have been sending our trucks to other states, but there are no labourers to unload the stock. There is no money to pay them, said Jaswinder Singh Sangha, general secretary of the Jalandhar Potato Growers Association. Most of the traders are small businessmen and they prefer purchasing the stock with cash, he added. The potato farmers of Punjab are also the primary suppliers of potato seeds across the country.The rates of potato seeds too have crashed over the past one week, from Rs 1,800 per 50 kg to Rs 1,000- 1,200 for the same amount.Watch What Else is Making NewsPrices for the early variety of potato that is already available in the market too have come down, from Rs 20 per kg in wholesale market to Rs 10-12 per kg.After 1984 riots, which also happened in November, this is the first time we are facing such a crisis. Trucks are ready with the supplies, but transporters do not have cash to send them to other states, said Sangha.Punjab has around 560 cold storage units which dispatch about 1.1 million tonnes (mt) of potato seeds to other states, while 0.4 mt is used by potato growers within Punjab. So far not even 40 per cent of the seed stock has been sold, said farmers.The potato planting season begins in early October and lasts till November 25 across the country. In Punjab, the seeds are sown in October itself, and the first batch of the vegetable arrives in the market by mid-November. In the other states, the potato seeds are only sown in November.Punjab, which produces about 2.2 mt of potatoes a year, supplies the seeds of the vegetable to farmers in Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat etc. Punjab meets around 63 per cent of the annual potato seed demand of the country.Apart from the small amount of seeds used in Punjab in October, most of the stock has been lying in cold storage units.Said Raghbir Singh, president of the JPGA, Several traders who had come to Punjab last week to buy the potato seeds returned empty-handed. The farmers here were not willing to accept the scrapped currency notes.We do not know how to tide over this situation. The government should have had adequate stock of new currency notes. The seed supply season lasts only for three weeks.

But we have to make immediate payments to labourers and also need cash for purchasing diesel and to pay EMIs for our tractor loans. However, traders are exploiting us, said Bherulal Patidar, a farmer. He had brought dollar chana to the mandi.Farmers Afzal Patel and Jaiprakash Choudhary also made similar allegations.Traders, however, refuted the allegations. A trader Dinesh said they were compelled to make payment in cheques as withdrawal limit for the registered traders is increased to just Rs 50,000.With that meager amount we cannot buy chana in cash, he said.Krishi upaj mandi secretary G K Choudhary said that he would inquire into the complaints and take action if needed.Businesses at some of the major wholesale markets in MP including Choithram mandi in Indore and red chilli mandi in Khargone is limping along due to severe cash crunch following scrapping of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes.To tide over the situation, the farmers say, transactions are increasingly being done partly in demonetised currencies and partly in new notes, besides credit.In most cases, payments are being made half in new currency notes and half in old currency notes. Lots of commodities are also being supplied on credit, Mukesh Patidar, a farmer, said.Traders at Choithram mandi say business there is down by about 50 percent since the Union governments demonetisation announcement and that is without counting severely hit potato-onion trade.To keep the vegetable supply chain running, the commission agents, who act as a link between farmers and wholesale traders, are dealing in both scrapped notes and credit.While affluent farmers always supply goods on credit, the small farmers need cash for their daily requirements. Today, there is shortage of new currency notes and not all farmers accept cheques, a commission agent, who did not wish to be named, told HT.The potato and onion market in Choithram mandi has been closed for the past one week and is expected to reopen on Monday.Farmers in Bedia in Khargone district, the red chili hub of Madhya Pradesh, are also facing similar problems. The commission agents are offering about Rs 1,000 per quintal more if farmers accept old currency notes, said Krishanpal Singh, a farmer.However, Khargone mandi secretary V K Choudhary said that payments are now being made by cheques and any complaint of exploitation of farmers will be dealt with strictly."

Politicians and analysts alike are worried about the short-term costs to the economy, especially the effects on the poor and on the agricultural economy. Former PM Manmohan Singh believes that the cost to the economy may be as much as a two per cent drop in GDP growth rate this year; he also described demonetisation as organised loot, legalised plunder of the common people.Let me first put down the agreements shared by both supporters and critics of de-monetisation (hereafter DM). The known knowns are three. First, that DM was a bold, radical and unprecedented move  there is no template with which to analyse the short-run effects of DM. Second, that implementation could have been possibly much better. A known unknown is the fact that secrecy was of the essence for DM to have any chance of success. And it deserves emphasis that the ministry of finance has never had such an open mind to criticism from the public, and has actually implemented some improvements (like the indelible ink requirement for exchange of cash). Third, and possibly most importantly, no one believes (including myself) that DM will do much to stop the creation of future black money. There will be a mild deterrent effect, but one whose amplitude will fade in a few years  unless accompanied by additional economic reforms.Many believe that besides the inconvenience, the short-run costs to the economy are considerable and will even feed into significant negative effects over the next few years. Politicians (especially of the Mamata and Kejriwal kind, though the Congress is not too far behind) have shouted themselves hoarse as to the costs the poor are paying because of DM. Some brokerage firms (especially the small ones) see this as their Andy Warhol moment; a few days of fame (later ignominy?) can be garnered by making forecasts that are out of the ballpark, if not out of the universe  one brokerage/investment firm has forecast that over the next five months, GDP will register a rate of -2 per cent. The economy grew at 7.5 per cent for seven months (April-October) and will need to grow at -2 per cent to register the Ambit Capital forecast of 3.5 per cent for this fiscal year. (As comparison, the Lehman crisis quarters, 2008 Q4 and 2009 Q1, registered a growth rate of 1.9 per cent and 0.8 per cent respectively).Some other forecasts are equally dire; we see newspaper headlines that the important rabi crop is in trouble, deep trouble, because of DM. The rural economy is primarily cash-dependent and a Times of India (November 24) front page story stated that job losses (among poor daily wage labourers) were mounting and prices of essential vegetables had dropped significantly between November 16-22. For example, potato prices were down 25 per cent, onion prices were halved, and tomato prices were down only 11 per cent (see table for all-India actual estimates).When poor people lose their jobs, and when land is idle, and/or produce is unmarketed, there could be riots in the streets. There are two short-run indicators of how the public is feeling  by-elections held on November 19, after the earthquake, and the pattern of food prices since November 8.Surprisingly, the voting public is not that angry with the BJP. In by-elections in five constituencies (Lok Sabha and Assembly) across four states in which the BJP was a contender (Madhya Pradesh, Assam, Arunachal Pradesh and Tripura), the BJP did about as well as the previous election. In three assembly constituencies (Nepanagar, MP, Baithalangso, Assam and Barjala, Tripura), the BJP did much better than previously. This is not supportive of the great DM negativity observed among the media and politicians.The DM-induced cash crunch was expected to considerably slow down the sowing for the rabi crop. Fortunately, and surprisingly, this has not happened. As of November 18, 241.7 million hectares (Mha) had been planted in 2016/17  compared to 243.4 Mha in the previous year. But shouldnt the acreage be more, given that this year was a much better rainfall year than the previous two years? No, because acreage varies little for individual crops, and responds to changes in relative prices. Acreage under pulses and oilseeds has increased significantly, under wheat, it has stayed the same. Furthermore, yield (output) is most affected by rainfall, so a decline is unlikely to be much affected by DM.One important source of information about the effects of DM is the pattern of food prices subsequent to November 8. The DM-induced cash crunch is expected to have two short-run effects on food output and consumption. The first is demand destruction in urban and rural India as consumers just dont have the cash to buy food  this would suggest that food prices should decline. If supply is really affected (supply destruction), then we should expect prices to shoot up. It is impossible to identify which effect is dominant.But attempt to infer we must. Hence, the presentation of detailed price pattern data for food items. For the last six years, the average November price change is reported for identical days across the years. The per cent change reported is between the average price observed across about 15-25 cities in India for each item, that is, brinjal, potatoes, apples, grapes, milk, etc. The data is collected daily. We have taken the median price for each day and each item. The average price for November 1-8 is the reference price; the per cent change reported is between the average median price between November 9-24 and this reference price. (If means are used rather than the median, there is little difference in the results).The reader can make her own inference; all the relevant data is provided. The conclusion we reach is that the net effect of the supply and demand destruction is very little on the price of food observed in urban markets.Let us look at the average change in vegetable and fruit prices. Vegetable prices have fallen by 4.3 per cent, but November is generally a time when vegetable prices decline. In 2011, despite healthy double digit inflation, vegetable prices fell 7.9 per cent; last year, vegetable prices were up 2.8 per cent. Fruit prices (a discretionary luxury food item) show a marginal increase of one per cent; overall food (with consumption weights as in the CPI) prices are down just 0.6 per cent in November.The strong result is that there is no juice for inference about destruction in the rural food economy. This result is not surprising for most agricultural experts  but the noise politicians dont want to hear that which is not convenient to their political ideology.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

Potato growers say there are no buyers and that they are yet to receive full payments even for the stocks they have already supplied to other states before and after the demonetisation.Also, they say, the government announcement allowing farmers to purchase seed with old currency notes came quite late when the potato sowing season in other states was almost about to end.In Punjab, potato planting season is from September-end till early October while in other states, it is between October 25 and November 25.In every cold store, around 10,000 to 12,000 bags of 50 kg each have been lying. Now, we do not know where to go and what to do, said Jaswinder Singh Sangha, general secretary of the Jalandhar Potato Growers Association. I have got 22,000 packets of government certified seed in my own cold store but there is no taker.Sangha said Punjab farmers were selling potato seeds at Rs 30-35/kg to the traders from other states before the announcement of the demonetisation on November 8, but after that, buyers simply vanished.The government has put us in a big trouble and it should compensate us now, said Sangha.Now we are planning to throw this potato seed either on roads or to distribute it to the poor as there is no taker. We cannot afford to keep these in cold stores where we have to pay rent and also for next crop which will start coming in February we have to empty our stores, said Raghbir Singh, the president of JPGA.Meanwhile, the rate of table potato has been hovering between Rs 800 and 1000 per quintal in wholesale market.Punjabs potato farmers are the main seed supplier of the crop across the country. The state produces about 2.2 metric tonnes, out of which 1.5 MT comprises seed potatoes only. Currently, Punjab supplies about 1.1 MT of potato seed to other states like Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and other potato producing state and meets around 63 per cent of the seed demand of the country every year.Doaba region, where potato seed is grown on 90,000 hectares of area, is the home of potato seed for the entire country. Jalandhar too has big potato producers.The sowing takes place in early-October and harvesting towards February-March, after which the produce is put in cold stores. Yields of seed potatoes, at 8-10 tonnes per acre, are below the 12-14 tonnes for normal table potatoes. But while the latter sell at Rs 1,000-1,200 per quintal, seed potatoes fetch rates that range from Rs 2,500-3,500 for branded and Rs 1,800-2,000 for unbranded material.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

Acreage under traditional crops and vegetables is expected to go up this season due to favourable weather condition.Farmers have sown vegetables, including potato and garlic on 30,000 hectares in Indore district as against the target of 22,000 hectares.A top agriculture department official said, ""Sowing of winter crops in the district has almost been completed. Acreage under rabi crops are seen higher this year and most of the expansion is seen in the area under potato and garlic.""Industry experts said that better remuneration and timely arrival of winter this year have helped in expanding acreage under vegetables.The agriculture department official said, ""Last year farmers had earned profit in garlic and potato farming, which has resulted in expansion of acreage this year. Besides, winter arrived on expected date that boosted farming activities resulting in good yields."" Wheat and chana are the top traditional winter sown crops of the district. Madhya Pradesh is the top producer of chana, while it ranks fourth in terms of wheat production in the country.The target of rabi sowing in the district is 2.25 lakh hectares, which includes chana, wheat and vegetables.Another agriculture department official said, ""Sowing is progressing well and acreage for chana is seen higher this season as prices are very high and overall weather is favourable.""Last year, farmers had sown rabi crops under 2.22 lakh hectares in the district.

Export of potatoes used for making snacks has increased in the last few years and will grow further with rising demand, experts at the International exhibition of cold chain expo said on Friday.The claims about good prospects for potatoes came at a time when a strong protest was held here by farmers who claim that potato prices have come down to Re 1 per kg. Manohar Shardiya, managing director of a cold storage said, ""With a rise in the snacks industry, demand for potato is growing rapidly in the state. Malwa potatoes are preferred for exports because of its high quality and taste. Top quality potatoes are exported while average and inferior ones are sent to local markets for consumption.""According to data from the agriculture department, farmers have sown vegetables that include potato and garlic on 30,000 hectares in the region this rabi season as against the target of 22,000 hectares.With disposable income in the country on the rise, the snacks industry is growing at a rate of over 10 per cent per annum according to experts.""Rapid growth of the snacks industry is boasting of a high demand for potatoes. The need for cold storages has also gone up so that produce can be stored longer and quality can be maintained,"" Shardiya said.With the upgrading of technology and rising production, the trend for multi-commodity cold storage chambers is rising in the country. Of 65 cold storages in Indore district, 40 are multi-commodity cold units.There are 210 cold storages in Madhya Pradesh Hansmukh Jain Gandhi, president, MP cold chain Industries Association said, ""The state has great potential to become a hub for cold storages due to its demographic advantage and high production of fruits and vegetables. Production of potatoes, cabbage, carrots and fruit such as oranges have grown in the past few years.""However, experts said that the state should improve its technology and farmers should get connected with the market for better opportunities. Pawanexh Kohli, CEO and chief advisor, National Centre for Cold chain Development said the state has the potential to build more cold storages but the selling radius for farmers should be expanded so that they can connect with their own choice of markets."

The new potato crop starts arriving in January in the mandis.Experts HT spoke to were of similar views. The fall in potato prices is more due to seasonal reasons. The production is expected to be more while the impact of demonetisation is limited, said agriculture expert Sachin Bondriya. The potato yield this year is expected to be about 250-300 quintal per acre, about 25% more than last year due to favourable conditions.Manohar Umrao Singh, a farmer who grows potatoes on the outskirts of Indore, said he was watching the prices closely. My crop will be ready in about a months time. However, old potatoes from cold storages have flooded the market and led to price crash.Madhya Pradesh has 210 cold storages, of which 65 are in Indore district.Farmers in Malwa region have been encouraged to grow more potatoes as they are increasingly finding a ready market in food-processing industries and export market in the Gulf. Potatoes grown in Malwa are preferred for exports because of its high quality and taste. While top-quality potatoes are exported, the remaining are sold in local markets.According to data from the agriculture department, farmers have sown vegetables, including potato and garlic, on 30,000 hectares in the region this rabi season, an increase of more than 30% over last year."

These five firms have combined sales of nearly Rs 3,700 crore, that is higher than Nestle's Maggi , and a few of these firms are larger than Kellogg 's in India.What about the multinationals?GSK Consumer posted negative sales growth in 2015-16 while Pepsi-Co's food division and Mondelez both grew 4%. Experts and company insiders attributed local players' growth to lower price points, increased distribution and conversion from unorganised market.""We have kept our overhead costs low so that our products remain affordable,"" said Chandu Virani, promoter of Balaji Wafers that posted a 14% sales growth last fiscal at Rs 1,440 crore. ""Also, bringing healthier variants and expanding in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh helped,"" he said.On an average, regional snack brands offer 30% higher volume than multinational rivals at similar price points, especially in highest selling price points of Rs 5 and Rs 10.According to market researcher Euromonitor, sweet and savoury snacks have grown by 26%, highest within packaged food segment between 2010 and 2015. About four years ago, packaged namkeen had replaced western snacks such as potato chips and finger sticks as the largest segment within branded salty snacks market.""Domestic manufacturers are increasing their distribution and penetration into rural India and have launched smaller packs at lower price points,"" Euromonitor said in a recent report.The research firm expects the salty snacks segment to surpass biscuits with sales of nearly Rs 35,801 crore by 2020, up from Rs 19,151 crore in 2015.Funding from private equity funds helped domestic snacking firms to expand their reach and market their products more aggressively, experts said.""There has been an impetus on brand building and geographical expansion by these regional firms. Their variants launches have been faster compared to large food companies,"" said Devendra Chawla, president, food & FMCG, at the country's leading retailer Future Group.Prataap Snacks, maker of Yellow Diamond chips, was backed by Sequoia and has filed papers for an initial public offering (IPO) to raise Rs 400 crore.The company, which clocked 35% growth in sales last year at.`758 crore, recently roped in actor Salman Khan to promote its brand. Nearly two years ago, private equity fund Lighthouse Funds had invested Rs 125 crore in Bikaji Foods while WestBridge Capital Partners picked up a 25% stake in DFM Foods that sellssnack foods under the brand Crax.It may be difficult for these domestic players to maintain their growth momentum though as larger rivals are entering their turf with similar pricing and products. Parle Products, ITC and PepsiCo have all launched similar range as smaller regional players in the past few years.""No doubt, regional brands offer better value for money. But as we enter their region and expand our portfolio, their growth rate might taper off,"" said B Krishna Rao, deputy marketing manager at Parle Products."

On an average, the cost of production for potato is Rs. 7 to Rs. 8 per kg, but the farmer is getting way below it, Jaswinder Singh Sangha, general secretary, Jalandhar Potato Growers Association, told The Hindu .Same time last year, farmers were getting around Rs. 600 per 50 kg, he said.The new season potato crop from the Kandi belt, including Hoshiarpur and neighbouring districts of Punjab and also Una district in Himachal Pradesh, has started arriving in the markets but farmers are finding it difficult to sell their crop in the absence of buyers.Since demonetisation, traders are facing cash crunch, resulting in a drop in bulk orders from big markets like Delhi. In local markets there are a fewer buyers and hence farmers are getting a far lower price, Mr. Sangha said, adding that the potato grower had earlier suffered losses due to drop in sale of seeds and now again when the fresh crop has reached the market.Potato growers from Punjab on Wednesday wrote a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, asking him to waive off their crop loans.Clash with peak seasonWhile we appreciate the governments [demonetisation] move, we have suffered huge losses. Potato seed farming business accounts for nearly Rs. 1,500 crore annually, but this year we are estimating a loss to the tune of Rs. 800-900 crore, he said, adding that demonetisation had clashed with the peak season of potato seed when it is supplied nationwide.Notably, Punjab produces quality potato seed, which is distributed across the country, including in West Bengal, Gujarat, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Odisha. Potato seed is supplied from the first week of November to mid-December every year. In neighbouring Haryana, the situation is no different as farmers are forced to sell potato at a dismal price on account of poor demand."
