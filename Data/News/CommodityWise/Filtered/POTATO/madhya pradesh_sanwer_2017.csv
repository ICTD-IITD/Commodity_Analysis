The proposed systems biggest advantage is that it can track actual purchases by the final buyer.Buoyed by its landslide win in the recent Uttar Pradesh assembly elections, the Narendra Modi government has decided to fast-track the implementation of the direct benefit transfer (DBT) system for payment of fertiliser subsidy to farmers.From the coming kharif season, beginning June, the Rs 70,000-crore fertiliser subsidy budgeted for 2017-18 will be disbursed to companies based on actual sales to farmers captured on point-of-sale (POS) machines installed at nearly two lakh retail points across India.This would be a significant change from the current system, where firms are paid the subsidy on receipt of their fertiliser at the railhead point or any approved godown of a district. Prior to this, till October 2012, they were getting the subsidy on despatch of material from their respective factories.From kharif 2017 onwards, we are moving to disbursal of subsidy only after sale to the farmer takes place. The farmers identity will be verified through Aadhaar-based biometric authentication, voter ID or Kisan Credit Card. The sale transaction as well as buyer details would be captured in the POS machine installed at the retailers end and connected with a central server, a Department of Fertilisers official told The Indian Express.The proposed subsidy-post-sale system  as opposed to after receipt-at-district or despatch-from-plant  is already being implemented as a pilot scheme in 17 districts. They include UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanaths home district of Gorakhpur; Kishanganj and Begusarai (Bihar); Dhanbad (Jharkhand); Hoshangabad (Madhya Pradesh); Pali (Rajasthan); Nashik and Raigad (Maharashtra); Narmada (Gujarat); Krishna and West Godavari (Andhra Pradesh); Ranga Reddy (Telangana); Tumkur (Karnataka); Thrissur (Kerala); Karnal and Kurukshetra (Haryana); and, Una (Himachal Pradesh).We will have a nationwide roll-out of this system from June 1. Fertiliser companies have been given a deadline of May 31 for procurement and installation of POS machines at all the 1.98 lakh-odd registered outlets selling to farmers. All transactions thereafter will have to be done through POS machines in order to be able to claim subsidy, the official said.The proposed systems biggest advantage is that it can track actual purchases by the final buyer. A farmer growing wheat or paddy may apply up to three 50-kg bags of urea, one bag of di-ammonium phosphate (DAP) and half-a-bag of muriate of potash (MOP) per acre. That requirement could be more  say, three bags urea and 1.5 bags each of DAP and MOP per acre  for potato and sugarcane.But under the new system, it is possible to record transactions at individual farmer-level. If someone is buying 200 bags of urea, that person is more likely to be a plywood or particle board manufacturer than a farmer. Either way, he isnt deserving of subsidy.Neem-coating has already helped check illegal diversion of a highly-subsidised fertiliser towards non-agricultural use. The linking of subsidy payment to data generated at retail sale point leaves virtually no scope for diversion that is always possible from the godown or rail rake point, the official said. Nor can fertilisers be smuggled from border areas to Bangladesh or Nepal, since there will be no POS machines there for recording sales and claiming subsidy.The fertiliser industry has cautiously welcomed the proposed reform. I want this to succeed, as it is an important first step that should culminate in the subsidy being transferred directly to farmers bank accounts, which is what DBT is ultimately about, said Suresh Krishnan, managing director, Zuari Global Ltd, a leading urea and phosphatic fertiliser marketer.The industrys main apprehension is on the preparedness of retailers to accurately record not just farmers details and quantities purchased, but also the company/unit supplying the material in each case. The fact that fertiliser sales are also concentrated over just few months (June-August and October-December) of the year only complicates matters further. Add to this the possibility of the POS device not working due to network connectivity or signal strength problems, it could be a recipe for chaos during the peak agricultural season.We are also concerned over timely subsidy payment. As it is, the industry is owed Rs 40,000 crore of unpaid subsidy bills carried forward each year, entailing an annual interest outgo of Rs 4,000 crore for which there is no reimbursement. If payment of subsidy will now happen only after actual sale of material to the farmer, it will add to our working capital costs, said Satish Chander, director-general, Fertiliser Association of India.Under the proposed system, payment of subsidy is to be based on weekly settlement of claims from actual sales data captured on POS machines. The industry will be happy if it really happens that way. We have supported this scheme, so much so that the entire cost of procuring and installing the two lakh POS devices (about Rs 400 crore) is being borne by us. We only want that it should lead to the implementation of DBT in the true sense of the subsidy going directly to the farmers, said Chander.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

So far I have sent two bulk orders via Mumbai port to Sri Lanka and Mauritius.""According to MP cold chain industries association, about 65 per cent space in the cold storages is occupied with potatoes along with carrots, coriander, turmeric, jagerry and other vegetables.Traders said that availability of potatoes in the market is sufficient this year due to higher production. February to March is the peak harvesting season for potatoes and other rabi crops.MP cold chain industries association president Hansmukh Jain Gandhi said, ""In anticipation of higher prices, farmers have stocked huge volume of potatoes in cold storages to increase their shelf life.""Indore has maximum number of cold storage units in Madhya Pradesh. There are 75 cold storages in the Indore district, while there are a total 210 cold storages in state.Farmers keep potatoes in cold storages to increase their shelf life and usually take them out when prices go up in the retail market.A cold storage owner Rajiv Tuteja said, ""Prices of potatoes are likely to rule high this year because overseas demands are good. We expect potato prices to rise between Rs 12 and Rs 15 per kg from the current price of Rs 6 per kg."""

About 92.5% of the states farmers fall in the small and marginal categories.Besides, the cabinet also decided to write off Rs 5,630 crore in non-performing assets (NPAs) of 700,000 farmers.The twin waivers  among nine decisions the cabinet took  would together cost the government Rs 36,359 crore.The cash-strapped government would float farmer relief bonds, called Kisan Rahat Bond, to generated funds to implement the loan waiver.The BJP had promised loan waiver to marginal farmers in its poll manifesto. Prime Minister Narendra Modi and chief minister Adityanath had said the decision would be taken at the first meeting of the state cabinet.State minister Siddharth Nath Singh told reporters the decision was in accordance with Prime Minister Modis announcement to provide relief to farmers.Its a coincidence that the cabinet took nine decisions on the occasion of Ram Navami, which marks the end of the nine-day Navratra festival, he said.Bundelkhand Kisan Union national president FK Dharma welcomed the loan weaver and said this was the first step towards easing out a major crisis faced by farmers.But Samajwadi Party president and former chief minister Akhilesh Yadav was not impressed.A promise of complete loan waiver was made to the farmers, he said.

It will give an additional Rs 10 a quintal to farmers cover transport and loading expenses.A three-member committee of ministers will find ways to ensure potato growers got remunerative prices for their produce.The government also decided to go ahead with its crackdown on the states illegal slaughterhouses, another poll promise of the BJP that won a landslide victory in the assembly elections. The Yogi government took charge a fortnight ago.The action against unauthorised abattoirs would strictly follow Supreme Court and National Green Tribunal directives and guidelines.The cabinet blamed rival political parties of spreading canard against the governments move to set up anti-Romeo police squads to check growing instances of harassment of women in public places.Allegations mounted that Uttar Pradesh has been turned into a nanny state by the BJP government, as reports emerged that these anti-Romeo teams were harassing men arbitrarily  even brothers dropping sisters at exam halls or men giving a lift to their woman colleagues.The cabinet decided that policemen wouldnt be spared if complaints of harassment were received.The government will form two groups of ministers (GoM)  each headed by deputy chief ministers Dinesh Sharma and Keshav Prasad Maurya.The Sharma-led group will visit Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and other states to study and recommend a new industrial policy for Uttar Pradesh.The second GoM under Maurya would submit a report in a week on measures to check illegal mining in the state."

(Source: Express photo by Vishal Srivastav)KEEPING A key poll promise of the BJP, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, at the first meeting of his cabinet on Tuesday, announced his governments decision to waive loans of Rs 36,359 crore taken by about 94 lakh small and marginal farmers in the state. The waiver amount includes Rs 5,630 crore loans of 7 lakh farmers whose accounts were declared non-performing assets (NPAs) by banks. In its Lok Kalyan Sankalp document 2017 for the assembly elections, the BJP had promised to waive crop loans of small and marginal farmers. During the poll campaign, Prime Minister Narendra Modi too had promised loan waiver of farmers if his party were to come to power in the state.According to government records, out of 2.30 crore farmers in the state, 1.85 crore are marginal and 0.30 crore are small farmers. The cabinet on Tuesday decided to waive outstanding crop loans adding up to Rs 30,729 crore taken by about 86.68 lakh small and marginal farmers till March 31, 2016, up to a maximum limit of Rs 1 lakh per farmer. In addition, the state government will also settle the dues of 7 lakh farmers with NPAs under a one time settlement scheme.All farmers with land holdings of less than one hectare, or 2.5 acres, will be considered marginal farmers, while those with land holdings of 1-2 hectares will be considered small farmers. The farmers were unable to repay the loans due to crop failure caused by hailstorm, drought and floods. Cabinet Minister Siddharth Nath Singh said the state government would bear the cost of the loan waiver and no financial support would be sought from the Centre. He said the state would raise the funds through the Kisan Raahat Bond.Finance Minister Rajesh Agrawal said farmers who have paid their loans will not benefit from the scheme. An eight-member committee, under the chairmanship of the chief secretary, has been set up to finalise the modalities of the scheme. Meanwhile, the cabinet also decided that illegal slaughterhouses would not be allowed to operate. Singh said the cabinet was informed that 26 such slaughterhouses had been shut down so far. The cabinet also approved the proposal regarding formation of anti-Romeo squads at police stations.The government also decided to draft a new industrial policy to increase investment in the state. A group of ministers led by Deputy Chief Minister Dinesh Sharma will visit several states like Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Maharahstra to study their industrial policies. Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya will head another committee of ministers to look into illegal mining. The committee is expected to hand in its report within a week.With the state recording a bumper wheat crop, the cabinet decided to open 5,000 wheat procurement centres across the state. While about 40 lakh metric tonnes of wheat will be procured in the first stage, the total target will be about 80 lakh metric tonnes. Along with the minimum support price (MSP) of Rs 1,625, farmers will be paid Rs 10 per quintal for transportation and loading. The cabinet also decided to set up a three-member committee to look into the steps that need to be taken to provide relief to potato farmers.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

PTI PhotoDelivering on BJP's poll promise to small and marginal farmers, the Yogi Adityanath cabinet today decided to waive their crop loans up to Rs 1 lakh, totalling a staggering Rs 36,359 crore, at its very first meeting.The move will benefit over 2.15 crore farmers, besides 7 lakh others who had secured loans which turned into non- performing assets (NPAs).The Yogi Adityanath cabinet decided to float Kisan Rahat Bonds for raising Rs 36,359 crore required for waiving loans of small and marginal farmers who form 92.5 per cent of the total 2.30 lakh farmers in the state.The decision comes a fortnight after Adityanath took over the reins of the state on March 19 after BJP and its allies stormed to power in the 403-member Assembly capturing 325 seats, an over three-fourth majority.Briefing mediapersons after a 90-minute meeting of the cabinet, senior minister Siddharth Nath Singh and Srikant Sharma said Rs 30,729 crore was required for waiving loans of small and marginal farmers.Besides, there were about 7 lakh other farmers who had taken loans which turned into non-performing assets ((NPAs). In order to bring them back into the mainstream, their outstanding dues of Rs 5,630 crore have also been written off.The loan waiver promise was made by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and state party president Keshav Prasad Maurya and it is the duty of the government to fulfil the promise made in BJP's 'sankalp patra' (manifesto) and the Yogi government was moving ahead in this direction, the two ministers said.In the past, farmers in the state had suffered because of successive drought and hailstorm.Singh said Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act mandated that no state can allow its fiscal deficit to grow beyond three per cent of its GDP. Hence, funds for meeting the expenditure on loan waiver would be raised through Kisan Rahat Bonds.Taking into account the problems faced by potato growers, who face immense hardship in case of bumper crops, the cabinet decided to set up a three-member committe headed by Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya to see how they can get adequate remuneration for their produce.The ministers said the committee will also look at how to help the potato growers.The ministers said the cabinet also decided to raise by Rs 10 per quintal the minimum support price for wheat procurement as loading and unloading charges. The MSP for wheat it Rs 1,680 per quintal.A target of 80 lakh metric tonnes of wheat procurement has been fixed for this season and, in the first phase, half of it will be procured, they said. The ministers said instructions have been issued to ensure direct procurement from farmers and that they should not be harassed.In order to check illegal mining, the cabinet decided to constitute a group of ministers. The GoM headed by Maurya will give its report in a week.The ministers said the cabinet also took up the issue of investments in UP for setting up industries so the youth get better employment opportunities in the state itself.For this, a five-member GoM headed by another Deputy Chief Minister Dinesh Sharma has been constituted. It would visit other states and study their industrial policies.The GoM will study the policies of BJP-ruled states like Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh among others for preparing an industrial policy for UP for enhanced investment through a single window system."

With his elder brother without a job, Arup was sustaining the family.I got the news yesterday but couldnt gather the courage to break it to my mother. She came to know of it today, after relatives started coming in. She has been inconsolable, said Animesh, the elder son. Arup had been planning to visit for a cousins wedding in July.

It has been the second year of a bumper onion crop with no buyers, forcing the government to announce a belated decision to procure the onions for Rs 8 per kilogram.Farmers are angry because the government neither made arrangements to procure the crop on time nor intervened to ensure a reasonable price.

Experts say crop failure rate in the rain-fed regions is high.The state governments zero percent interest loan benefitted some farmers. But farmers in general were not able to claim benefits again as they were not able to repay the short-term loan. This, local government officials say, pushed farmers to local money-lenders, a reason for farmers to demand loan waiver.The governments bid to improve horticulture and food processing is mainly confined to paper, leading to farmers not getting benefits, much like farm owners in Punjab and Haryana."

We have full sympathy for them and also want meet the affected families. But we are feeling helpless due to the attitude of the BJP government,"" she said.""Farmers in Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Haryana have been protesting as they want a fair price. But the administration in these BJP governed states fired bullets and attacked them with sticks,"" Mayawati alleged.However, the ruling BJP said the Adityanath government was sensitive to the farmers' cause and blamed opposition parties for fuelling unrest among the cultivators.""Our government is with the farmers. This government is sensitive and stands with farmers...The first cabinet meeting of our government decided to waive farmers' loans and many more sops are on the anvil,"" BJP spokesperson Shalabh Mani Tripathi said."
5a0494419855b76bf13bdf22,Farmers’ ire not about loans alone,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/farmers-ire-not-about-loans-alone/articleshow/59078066.cms,2017-06-09,"The farmers'agitation in MP, and before that in Maharashtra, has pushed a simmering agrarian crisis into the spotlight.Earlier, the newly elected UP government announced a loan waver for small and marginal farmers, Maharashtra government said it was exploring the possibility. The Centre itself had announced that it would strive to double farmers' incomes by 2022. All these were raising expectations of farmers, especially after enjoying a good monsoon and record harvest in 2016-17, after two consecutive years of drought.Yet why are farmers - the lifeline of India - angry and resentful?One of the key factors fuelling agrarian anger is that good year or bad year, they are unable to earn enough. There is always a mismatch between their cost of production and what they get in the mandis. A quick comparison of cost of production and farm harvest prices as data collected by the agriculture ministry reveals the mismatch for 2014-15, the last year for which such information is available.In several states, for several widely cultivated produce like paddy and wheat, prices at which farmers are selling their harvest are actually lower than what they spent in cultivating the crop. In Madhya Pradesh, the epicenter of current agitation, paddy was fetching 15% less than cost of production while wheat was giving them just 2% profit.MP has emerged as a major player on the national scene exhibiting an agricultural growth rate of 9.7% between 2005-06 and 2014-15 compared to 3.6% for India as a whole. Share of agriculture in MP's gross state domestic product has increased from 25% to over 30% in this period. Area under vegetables and fruits has increased by 78% since 2010-11. According to a study done by Ashok Gulati and his colleagues at ICRIER, expanded irrigation, strong procurement system for wheat and bonus over its minimum support price and expansion of all-weather roads to connect farmers to markets have led to this boom in agriculture.Yet, after enjoying the boom for several years, the state's farmers have ended up in the same trap that has been haunting their brethren in other states. The reason why farmers don't get suitable margins is because of their input costs  water, diesel, fertiliser, etc. For cultivating wheat in MP, Rs 1,241.34 were spent on fertilisers per hectare in 2004-05 which has more than doubled to Rs 2,695.27 per hectare in 2014-15. Similarly, cost of seeds used in one hectare increased from Rs 998 in 2004-05 to Rs 2,653 in 2014-15. Even cost of irrigation has jumped from Rs 1,961.50 to Rs 2,599.55 in this period. These and other costs like labour, agricultural machinery hiring charges, pesticides, rents, have all gone up while prices that farmers get have lagged behind.As recently reported, support prices may be higher than what farmers get but getting payments is so difficult that farmers often have to sell to traders at lower prices. This dire situation is also causing mounting indebtedness of farmers with over half of agricultural households in debt as per an NSSO survey for 2012-13. MP was reported to have 46% debt ridden farmers.Should farmers diversify to get more value for their crops? This would appear to be a way out except that even in those cases, farmers' margins plummet after some time. UP's potato farmers were getting a measly 5% profit, while in Punjab, cotton farmers have suffered enormous losses of as much as 20%."

Onion was being sold for just Rs 1 in Madhya Pradesh till the state government stepped in to buy, potato is still being sold for 80 paise in Haryana and pigeon pea (tur dal) is fetching no more than Rs 40 in Maharashtra.The glut and plunging prices is the sum total of the crisis staring at farmers across the length and breath of the country. Last week, matters came to a head after farmers protest in Mandsaur of Madhya Pradesh turned violent, resulting in six deaths.Like everywhere else, Mandsaur farmers were agitating after they were forced to sell onions at just Rs1 a kg. The prices are well below what they fetched in 2016: Onion for Rs 1 as against Rs 7, turmeric for Rs 50, half the price in 2016, soya bean at 33% lesser than the rate in 2016 and so on.Farmers blame their plight on demonetisation and the failure of the government to impose adequate import duty on time.Farm economy runs on cash and traders say they have no money to give us. We are forced to sell the produce at whatever price they (traders) are offering, said Jasbir Mamumajra, a sunflower grower from Yamunanagar in Haryana, who blamed demonetisation for his woes.Most of the agriculture trade used to run on cash, mostly unaccounted money, and on credit. With cash being sucked out, the traders have less liquid asset to take risks. In some places they are seeking a commission of up to 2% to make payment in cash.A farm trader in Indias food bowl of Punjab, Devinder Singh, agrees, saying note-bandhi has disturbed the trade cycle. Entire trade shifted to no-credit system. It has hit us hard, he said.An agriculture expert with Bihar government, Anil Kumar Jha, said input costs such as labour, fertilisers and pesticides have gone up significantly this year. This added to the miseries of farmers, already facing cash crisis due to demonetisation.Maharashtra farmers, who were first to protest after prices of pigeon pea (tur dal) fell, blamed the Centre for not imposing high import duty on pulses.The production cost of the tur per quintal is more than Rs5,000 for farmers. With the Union government allowing the import of lentil at Rs 3,700 a quintal, the farmers are not likely to recover their cost, said Vijay Jawandhia, farm activist and Shetkari Sangathana leader.Same was the complaint by farmers in Haryana, who have been forced to sell sunflower at Rs 2,500 per quintal as against the minimum support price of Rs 3,950 even though the cost of seeds have increased by almost 50% in 2016.We could have been saved had the government increased import duty on edible (palm) oil, said Balwinder Singh, a Karnal-based farmer. However, state government officials blamed poor quality for the low price.In Asias largest grain market in Khanna, Punjab, the prices of maize have plummeted with traders like Sanjeev Kumar saying the farmers are bearing the brunt. In Uttar Pradesh, farmers sold wheat at less than the minimum support price, saying government agencies were not willing to buy the produce because of the record production this year.Wholesale traders in Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh said the prices of onion, tomato and potato have crashed.The per quintal wholesale prices of the onion in Maharashtra was down to Rs 600-800 from Rs 1,000-1,250 in 2016. Potato in Haryana was sold at Rs 80 a quintal on Tuesday. Farmers sold onion for Rs 1 in Madhya Pradesh after which the government announced a procurement price of Rs 8 per kilogram.P Chengal Reddy, founder-chairman of the Consortium of Indian Farmers Associations (CIFA), said: The Centre takes into consideration the average production of past three years and not the current years production cost, in deciding the MSP. If it continues, time is not far when farmers across the country will revolt, he said.(With inputs from state bureaus)"
5a038f4b9855b76bf13b7f6b,5 Farmer Suicides In 2 Weeks Despite Uttar Pradesh's Loan Waiver Scheme,http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/5-farmer-suicides-in-2-weeks-despite-uttar-pradeshs-loan-waiver-scheme-1712789,2017-06-15,"Farmer Shiv Kumar's family said he had lost money on a substandard crop.There have been five instances of farmers suicides across Uttar Pradesh last two weeks. In all five instances, the families of those who killed themselves said the farmers were under heavy debt - from government institutions and private money lenders. Two of the suicides have happened in Kanpur district, and one each in Mahoba, Banda and Kaushambhi. The government has ordered inquiries into the suicides.The spate of suicides come after the state's BJP government, led by Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, waived off loans to the tune of Rs 35,000 crores in April. The waiver was part of the BJP's promises in the run-up to the state assembly elections. However, there is confusion among farmers over which loans are covered by the scheme, and which are not.""This government does not have a framework. They did not say whether there would be a limit or a condition to the waiver"", said Samajwadi Party's Basudev Yadav, who was sent by former Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav to visit the Dwivedi family in Kaushambhi.The state's deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya hit back at the Samajwadi Party.""SP is doing vendetta politics. We are committed towards working for the farmers and the loan was waived in the first cabinet meeting,"" the minister said.At Kaushambhi's Bakhtiyara village, 60-year-old Ram Babu Dwivedi committed suicide on Wednesday morning. The potato farmer recently received a loan recovery notice from a local cooperative. He had accumulated over seven lakh rupees as loan from government banks and crop worth 300 quintal rotted away in his fields.""I used to ask him about the loans but he would always say that he would take care of it,"" said Devendra, Ram Babu's son.Yesterday, a farmer in Kanpur, Shiv Kumar, died at a Kanpur hospital. He had consumed pesticide three days ago.His family has said Mr Kumar had lost money on a substandard crop after taking a loan of a loan of 70,000 rupees. His meagre earnings supported his wife, and four young daughters.""In his condition, 60 - 70 thousand rupees was no less than 6-7 lakh rupees,"" said his younger brother Ravi Shankar, also a farmer.Neighbouring Madhya Pradesh has been witnessing violent protests by farmers who are demanding loan waivers and better prices for their crops. The protests abated this week after the government announced some relief this week and paid a compensation of Rs 1 crore to the families of each of the six farmers killed in Mandsaur on June 6. Prohibitory orders have been lifted from Ratlam today - a day after they were lifted from the epicentre of the protests in Mandsaur."

Most of these farmers claimed to be followers of Brahmeshwar Singh or Mukhiya, who headed the banned, upper caste militia Ranvir Sena in the state.""The condition of farmers in Bihar is quite bad and soon there would be cases of farmers' suicide in Bihar as well, if the government won't act. We blame Nitish Kumar as well as Narendra Modi for our plight as both are doing nothing to help us financially and in other ways. Both are thugs,"" said Vivek Sharma, state convenor of the farmers' body staging the dharna.The agitating farmers also took a dig at Nitish for organising Kisan Samagam programme at S K Memorial by ignoring their plight. ""Who organises meeting with farmers in AC hall? While we have to sell our farms due to financial crisis, the CM invites select farmers to his programme. Such programmes are just aimed at deceiving the common people and ignoring serious issues,"" said Awadhesh Nandan Sharma , district president of the farmers' outfit.Earlier this week, Nitish had slammed the Narendra Modi-led NDA government at the Centre for its failure to resolve the nationwide farmers' protest. ""Farmers are in a bad condition, but the central government is indifferent to them. The government's failure to enforce MSP for farm produces has forced the farmers to protest. The country has been facing an agrarian crisis due to the low price of farm produces,"" Nitish had said on the sidelines of his Lok Samvad programme on Monday.In Friday's protest, the farmers demanded minimum support price of Rs 50 per litre for milk, Rs 100 per kilogram for pulses, Rs 3,000 per quintal for paddy and Rs 4,000 per quintal for wheat.""RJD chief Lalu Prasad never fails to term himself garibo ka neta, but he never supports milkmen, his traditional vote base,"" said Vivek."

Apart from the natural calamity of drought, there were man-made calamities, and this column is about how the two have brought about the explosive situation in the country.Farmers agitations are spreading across many states. It is the culmination of the acute distress in the farm sector that many observers have written and spoken about in the last two years. Two years of drought in many states was the main cause. The governments cannot be blamed for the occurrence of drought, but governments are solely responsible for the mismanagement of the consequences of drought. Apart from the natural calamity of drought, there were man-made calamities, and this column is about how the two have brought about the explosive situation in the country.The bulk of farmers in India have no choice but to do farming. Land is the only asset they have, farming is the only skill they possess, and unless they grow food many of them will face starvation. Agriculture, despite its declining share in total output (GDP), is also the largest employer. In Indias economy, the agriculture sector has primacy.The Price of NeglectUnfortunately, the NDA government lost sight of this basic truth. The agriculture portfolio is the Cinderella of this government. The Minister of Agriculture, unchanged since May 2014, is a political lightweight with little clout within the government. (How many of you can name Mr Sharad Pawars successor?). The minister has been neither seen nor heard by most people. The only memorable statement on agriculture that I can recall was when he repeated the Prime Ministers promise to double farmers income in 6 years and when asked if they had meant real income or nominal income, there was deafening silence.On the other hand, the government erred grievously on the issue of minimum support prices (MSP). In its manifesto and in the election campaign, the BJP had unequivocally promised that it would implement the M S Swaminathan Committees recommendation that MSP should be cost plus 50 per cent. In government, the BJP not only reneged on its promise, it dealt a body blow to farmers by denying them even a reasonable increase in MSP in its first three years. The numbers speak for themselves:The ostensible reason for denying a fair MSP was that higher MSP fueled inflation, which is partly true, but to lean in favour of inflation control against the interest of Indias farmer-producers was the height of folly. Some inflation is inevitable, and the government and the RBI must use other instruments to moderate inflation rather than reduce the farming community to penury.Errors galoreThe second grave error was demonetisation. Mr Harish Damodaran has convincingly demonstrated how demonetisation has crippled the post-harvest agricultural economy (see The Crops of Wrath, Indian Express, June 12, 2017). Agricultural products are bought and sold largely in cash. Demonetisation dried up liquidity and prices have crashed. According to Mr Damodaran, never before have prices of tomato, potato and onion crashed at the same time. Same is the situation with soyabean, arhar, garlic, methi (fenugreek) and grapes. Saying that farmers have resorted to fire sales, Mr Damodarans conclusion is, We have entered deflation territory in farm produce, whose proximate trigger clearly has been demonetisation.The third error was when the Prime Minister announced, on behalf of the yet-to-be-elected Uttar Pradesh government, that all farm loans in UP will be waived if the BJP formed the government. More likely, it was just an election promise in a state that the BJP perhaps did not expect to win, but it was an unequivocal promise that has returned to haunt the BJP in several states. Farm loan waivers are neither intrinsically good nor bad. As Dr M S Swaminathan said a few days ago, Loan waivers, though temporarily necessary, do not provide for a secure long term credit system (emphasis supplied). When farmers do not get a fair and reasonable price and are unable to repay their loans, they demand a loan waiver. The holder of the highest political office promised a total loan waiver, why blame the farmers for demanding that the promise be implemented?In February 2008, the fiscal situation was excellent, growth had found a new momentum, and a one-time loan forgiveness to small and medium farmers was justified. The central government was confident it could fund the waiver and so it went ahead and announced it. In 2017, however, every prudent norm was turned on its head. The Prime Minister promised a loan waiver on behalf of an yet-to-be-elected state government, no one seems to have examined the capacity of UP to bear the burden, and no one seems to have factored the fallout in other states. Having mounted a tiger, the BJP does not know how to dismount it. Meanwhile, the tiger is galloping through Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Punjab, Haryana, Maharashtra and Gujarat.Jobless youth angryThe last straw was jobless growth. Young men can find no work on farms or off farms. Micro, small and medium businesses are not offering new jobs. Tier 2, 3 and 4 towns are full of jobless youth and their anger has turned against the central government. The BJP will not admit its mistakes. Nor will any BJP leader tell the Prime Minister that mistakes were made. Will the Prime Minister pull a rabbit out of the hat?

5a05169b9855b76bf13bf9e6,Farm protest rages across India,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/617965/farm-protest-rages-across-india.html,2017-06-18,"Devinder Sharma, Jun 18 2017, 1:06 ISTAgrarian crisis: Only a holistic, pragmatic policy can end the tragedy unfolding in rural areas since decadesFarmers anger is spilling over. The violent agitation that erupted in the Malwa belt of Madhya Pradesh, resulting in the death of five farmers in police firing, has now spread to Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Gujarat and Chhattisgarh. The demand for farm loan waiver, accompanied by higher crop prices, is now gaining momentum.More than 3.18 lakh farmers have committed suicide in the past 21 years. Every 41 minutes a farmer commits suicide in the country. While I agree that farmer suicides are a symptom of a bigger malaise that afflicts agriculture, policymakers have failed to take the massive death toll as a sign of terrible economic depravity that plagued the rural landscape. How long could we expect farmers to take the hit silently? It had to happen one day, and no one knew what will trigger it.For nearly three decades, more so after the economic reforms were ushered in, agriculture has been a victim of neglect and apathy. Following the World Banks prescription of moving 400 million people from the rural to the urban areas by the year 2015, successive governments deliberately created conditions to turn farming unviable, thereby forcing an increasing number of farmers to abandon agriculture and migrate to cities. To keep food inflation under control, farmers have been routinely paid less, not even to cover the cost of production, thereby driving them against the wall.With each passing year, the crisis worsened. The 2016 Economic Survey tells us that the average annual income of a farming family in 17 states, roughly half the country, is a mere Rs 20,000 or less than Rs 1,700 a month. Such a dismal income, merely enough for subsistence, was the outcome of economic policies over the years. I shudder to think how these farming families must be surviving all these years. After all, it is not even possible to rear a cow in less than Rs 1,700 a month.But I doubt if such details mean anything to mainline economists and policymakers. With the markets crashing after every harvest, and with the government reluctant to save farmers by ensuring that they get at least the Minimum Support Price (MSP), farmers are pushed deeper and deeper into a never-ending cycle of debt. Even the MSP is often less than the cost of production. In Maharashtra, the production cost of tur dal has been worked out at Rs 6,240 per quintal. The MSP was Rs 5,050 per quintal, but the price at which farmers were able to sell tur, and that too after waiting for nearly a week in the mandis, was between Rs 3,500 and Rs 4,200 per quintal.Take another case. A farmer in Haryana toils hard for three months, putting all his labour to reap a bountiful harvest of potato only to find the prices crashing, thereby forcing him to sell 40 quintals of potato for just 9 paise a kg. The shock often turns fatal. But the fact remains that the government has rarely come to his rescue. Compare this with the fall in stock markets, and the finance minister promises to monitor the crisis on an hourly basis, holding a press conference to assuage the investors. Have we ever seen the finance minister or the agriculture minister monitoring the deplorable condition when farm prices crash?The poor farmer has been left to live in indebtedness, which keeps multiplying with every passing year. The crisis is compounded by the denial of a rightful income to farmers for their produce. To keep food inflation under control, it is the farmers who have paid the price. In reality, it is the farmers who have been subsidising the nation all these years. Successive governments have therefore deliberately kept agriculture impoverished. An estimated 58% of the farmers go to bed hungry every night.After Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath announced a farm loan waiver worth Rs 36,359 crore, which will benefit 92 lakh small and marginal farmers, Maharashtra announced a loan waiver worth Rs 30,500 crore. Punjab is expected to take over at least Rs 30,000 crore of the bad loans. Though I am not in favour of loan waivers but in a deplorable situation that agriculture has been pushed into, a waiver is a short-term relief.It is an emergency measure to bail out millions of small and marginal farmers in distress. IndiaSpend estimates a total of Rs 3.1 lakh crore of farm loan that needs to be waived. This is still far less than the Rs 4 lakh crore bailout package that the telecom industry alone is seeking. Another Rs 1.7 lakh crore of bad debt is what the steel industry hopes will be written off.Holistic approachLoan waiver must be followed by policies that ensure loans dont pile up again. A tinkering here and there is not going to address the crisis. It needs a holistic approach and a paradigm shift in economic thinking.To begin with:The effort should be to make farming economically viable.The Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices, which works out the MSP for crops, should be directed to factor in four allowances being paid to farmers  house allowance, medical allowance, educational allowance and travel allowance. So far, MSP only covers the cost of production. Government employees get a total of 108 allowances.Since MSP benefits only 6% of the farmers, it needs to be understood that the demand for providing 50% profit over MSP will benefit only these 6% farmers. For the remaining, who are dependent on the exploitative markets, the need is to set up a National Farmers Income Commission, with the mandate to provide a minimum assured monthly income package of Rs 18,000 per farmer family.Public sector investments must come in urgently for constructing Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee mandis and also for storage godowns. At present, there are only 7,700 APMC mandis. What India needs is 42,000 mandis for every 5 km radius. And like in Brazil, where it is mandatory for a market yard to procure anything a farmer brings, APMC mandis should be equipped to do the same.(The writer is a commentator on issues relating to farmers and agriculture)"

Farmers say there is no point selling the produce as they are not even able to get back their investment due to the low price. It is estimated that around 6 crore sacks of 50 kg each, totaling 30 lakh ton, are stored in Agra region alone. State horticulture department has now appealed to farmers not to hoard the tuber. Recently government determined minimum support price for procurement of potato at the rate of Rs 487 per quintal, but farmers said it is too low to benefit them.There are around 240 cold storage units in Agra. All of them are completely filled with potatoes, with farmers refusing to take them out till the prices become better.According to horticulture department officials, In August the potato crop of Karnataka will hit the market. This may result in a sudden fall in the price of the stored potatoes. Therefore farmers in the state have been advised to continue selling the stored produce to avoid even worse losses.Potato is a major crop in the district, cultivated in around 72,000 hectares of land. Agra division, which includes Agra, Firozabad, Mathura and Mainpuri, is one of the major producers of the tuber, which is supplied to states including Maharashtra, West Bengal, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Delhi, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh.District horticulture officer Anita Singh said, ""The current potato prices are much lower than in previous years. In the near future, there is no significant scope for increase in potato prices. To avoid major losses, farmers should slowly continue to sell their produce. Depending on quality, the present market rate of potato is Rs 300 to 600 per quintal whereas it should be between Rs 800 and Rs 1,000 per quintal.""According to department officials, increased in production of potato and a stop on supply to Pakistan and some other neigbouring countries is one of the reasons behind the drop in prices.Rakesh Goyal, secretary of Agra Cold Storage Association said, ""Compared to previous years, this time around 12% more potato came for storage. But due to low prices, few farmers are taking away their produce.""According to market experts, till June 20 around 25% of the produce should have been sold. But business has witnessed fall of 12%.Khandoli farmer Sharvan Singh said, ""Government has turned farmers into a joke. The minimum support price is not reasonable at all. It doesn't even pay for the investment we made in the crop.""Agra Potato Business Association general secretary Aamir Bhai said, ""Ever since demonetization, business has continued to be derailed. Farmers will be forced to throw their produce on the roads, but the government does not seem to be concerned.""Farmer Gyan Singh Sikarwar said, ""Next year I will not produce potato at any cost. I am thinking of sowing some other crop but that needs money too. I already have a pending loan of Rs 5,000 and banks have told us we will not get further loan till the previous ones are waived by the government."""

At 70, he is old and frail. He speaks, but is not easy to always comprehend. He walks slowly. But it is not just about himself that he is anxious. He is more concerned about the well-being of his family comprising three sons, their wives and 10 grand children.If one person falls sick, we are in trouble. There is no money, says Lal, a farmer in Barabankis Tindwani village. Though just 20 kilometres from Lucknow, if you go by the lack of infrastructure and housing, the state of roads and power, the village could be anywhere in the remote interiors of UP.Lal has a loan of Rs 70,000, taken in 2015, and displays his Kisan Credit Card. He is also a potential beneficiary of the UP governments loan waiver. Even as he waits to see whether his loan will indeed get written off as assured by Yogi Adityanath, the states new chief minister, he is already thinking of the next loan that he will likely be forced to take.The fact that he may have to take another loan underlines the limitations of a loan waiver: it at best can be a temporary relief and is not a solution to the problem of low income farmers plagued by recurrent losses.The economics of investmentLal, for example, has 6 bighas, an acre and a half, of land. The single-most important challenge for him, every season, is finding the resources to invest.Take the economics of potato farming.For an acre of land, Lal - like other potato farmers in Tindwani and elsewhere - has to first buy 20 sacks of seeds, with each sack containing 50 kg. Each kg costs around Rs 24. And so the total cost for seeds is Rs 24,000.He then has to buy fertilisers of different kinds - a 5 kilo pack of zinc sulphate for Rs 300, two packs of urea for Rs 330 each, and five sacks of DAP (Diammonium Phosphate) for Rs 1150 each. The total cost of fertilisers comes to Rs 6710.Lal then has to till and level the land, for which he hires a tractor for Rs 500 per hour. Ten times, for two hours each, the tractor works on preparing the soil and land. Lal shells out another Rs 10,000 for it.He then sows the seeds, for which he has to hire the tractor again, which costs him Rs 2000.The farmers of Tindwani depend on pumps, run on diesel, for irrigation. Engines (which includes diesel rates) can be rented at  150 per hour; every acre requires at least four hours of irrigation; and it has to be irrigated seven times. The total cost for Lal on this head works out to Rs 4200.The next step is the use of pesticides. Along with labour, which can be hired at Rs 250 per day, the costs of this would come to Rs 1500.Watch | Why are Indias farmers seething with anger?The final step in the cycle is harvesting. A tractor is hired, at Rs 2000 per acre. Ten labourers are hired for the day, which costs Rs 2500. And 250 sacks have to be bought, at Rs 20 each. Together, the entire harvesting exercise costs about Rs 9500.But the cycle is not yet complete, for the farmers have to now transport and store their produce. Each sack is now packed in with 50 kgs of potato. The total produce from an acre, if all goes well, for Lal is about 125 quintals. The total cost of transporting and storing is close to Rs 30,000.And so what constitutes for Lal his basic investment, in one crop cycle, for an acre of land, from the stage of seeds to storing the produce, is approximately Rs 87,910. With miscellaneous costs, this would go up to around Rs 90,000.Potato farmer Kishan at his field in Bandi ka Purva village in Barabanki. (Deepak Gupta/HT Photo)The lose-lose ventureAnd then how much does Lal - or any other farmer of his kind - earn?Till Yogi government came to power in March in UP, there was no Minimum Support Price for potato. In the last season, prices had fluctuated. Local Tindwani farmers told HT that it varied between Rs 120 per sack of 50 kgs to Rs 750 per sack. On an average, this would mean about Rs 4.85 per kg of potato. At 125 quintals, this would mean a return of Rs 60, 625 for an acre of potato produce.But it was erratic. Sometimes, we just left our produce at the storage because it cost more to pay them storage fees than what we would have recovered. So we got no money, says Lal.To offset this problem of wild fluctuation in prices, the Yogi government has introduced an MSP of Rs 487 per quintal. But even if all his produce was acquired at this rate, it would give a farmer like Lal for an acre of his produce Rs 60,875.But remember his investment. It is close to Rs 90,000. And so every acre of potato he cultivates, Lal is actually losing Rs 30,000.The vicious cycleIt is because of this gross mismatch between investment and income that farmers such as Lal end up taking loans. They do not have money for the seeds, the fertilisers, the irrigation, the pesticides, the sowing, the harvesting, the transport and storage because they have actually lost money.Weddings in the family and emergencies like illnesses force them to sell part of their land holdings. Novembers demonetisation did not help. It left even lesser money for investment and so the crop produce for some of the potato farmers of Tindwani went down.The Yogi governments decision to waive off loans up to Rs 1 lakh, for small and marginal farmers with less than a hectare of land, may benefit Lal. But it wont solve his problem.Where would he get the money to make a fresh investment? I will take a loan again. What else can I do?Why did he then cultivate potatoes in the first place?Lal says he has no other option. What else can we do? This is what my family has always done. This is all we know. At least, it gets us some vegetables for the home. Lal says sending his sons out to work is not a solution: they were unskilled and would get Rs 250 as labour charges for a day, which they could get in the village too. At least we are together.It is this underlying driver of despair - limited cash reservoir to make investments, losses on produce because of low price, and thus a further push into deprivation - which is causing despair. The UP governments decision to waive off loans has triggered a nation-wide demand for the same, but Lal knows it is only a matter of time before he is back, standing in the queue for another loan.This is Part 3 of our series, #BeingAFarmerNow. Part 1 focused on the new age farmers of Madhya Pradesh while Part 2 examined how big-ticket projects cheat farmers out of their land."

Little had he thought that the issue would gather momentum just five months down the line and force the Narendra Modi government to consider loan waiver for small and marginal farmers.In a way, the demands for farm loan waiver could be BJPs own doing. Maharasthra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, who had been steadfast in his opposition to a loan waiver, admitted that he was forced to announce writing off debts of small and marginal farmers due to immense pressure from the farmers whose expectations had risen manifold following similar moves by Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana.The Congress had already raised the pitch for farm loan waiver with vice president Rahul Gandhi undertaking a month-long kisan yatra across Uttar Pradesh in September last year. Though the yatra did not benefit the Congress politically, it did raise expectations of the farmers. The BJP too responded by mentioning farm loan waiver for small and marginal farmers in its manifesto for Uttar Pradesh.Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in his election rallies, went to the extent of saying that the BJP government in Uttar Pradesh will take a decision on farm loan waiver in its first cabinet meeting. The pressure on the Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath for announcing the loan waiver was telling as he kept delaying the meeting of the cabinet that usually takes place within hours of the new government assuming office. The council of ministers met a couple of times informally as bureaucrats put together proposal for the loan write off for the cabinet to consider in its first meeting.The announcement by the Uttar Pradesh government led to demands for a farm loan waiver from other states such as Maharashtra, Karnataka, Uttarakhand, Tamil Nadu among others. Maharashtra bowed to the demands from farmers and declared a farm loan waiver for needy farmers. The state government put stringent conditions to exclude well-off farmers from the loan waiver scheme to limit its expenditure.As soon as Maharashtra announced its farm loan waiver, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley made it clear that the state government will have to fund the initiative from its own resources and not expect any bailout by the Centre. The Punjab government became the third state to announce a farm loan waiver for small and marginal farmers on June 19, a promise made by the Congress during the poll campaign in the state. In a bid for political one-upmanship, Chief Minister Amarinder Singh also announced loan waiver up to Rs 2 lakh  double than what has been offered by UP and Maharashtra.At the heart of the crisis is absence of remunerative prices for farm produce. In simpler terms, a person dependent only on agriculture as a means of livelihood finds it difficult to make both ends meet as he does not earn enough. As prices of pulses, fruits and vegetables shot up during the past two years due to drought, the government had put in place stringent curbs on exports and stockholding by traders. The same were not eased after a spell of good monsoon led to bumper production.The glut of pulses and onions saw farmers making a beeline to market yards to sell their produce leading to a sharp reduction in procurement prices. In Maharashtra, stagnant milk prices had irked farmers who threw milk on the roads instead of selling it to dairies. In Uttar Pradesh, potato growers threw their produce on roads as wholesale prices dipped on account of better production. Similar was the case with onion growers in Madhya Pradesh.The simmering discontent among farmers in Madhya Pradesh led to protests in Mandsaur where six farmers were killed in police firing on June 6. Things took a political turn as leaders made a beeline to Mandsaur to express solidarity with farmers.Delicate issueIn both Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh, the governments hastily reached out to a section of favourable farmer leaders, agreed to some of their demands and called off the strike. Such handling of a delicate issue further angered the farmers who looked towards leaders such as Shiv Kumar Sharma alias Kakkaji in Madhya Pradesh and Raju Shetti in Maharashtra to take their struggle to a logical conclusion.While Sharma heads the breakaway faction of the RSS-backed Bhartiya Kisan Sangh, Shetti leads the Swabhimani Shetkari Sangathan in Maharashtra. Sharma was thrown out of the BKS following his frequent run-ins with Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan. Shetti, a Lok Sabha member from Hatkanangale near Kolhapur, is part of the NDA but is increasingly disillusioned with Prime Minister Narendra Modis farm policies.Shetti believes that Modi has lost the script when it came to tackling the agrarian distress as the government, instead of addressing pressing issues such as remunerative prices, was busy pursuing soil health cards. His consistent demand  Modi should fulfil the poll promise of implementing the M S Swaminathan Committee Report that has recommended a 50% margin over the cost of cultivation incurred by the farmers.Farmers were already operating on thin margins, which have dipped even further over the last three years. The poll promise on MSP has remained just that  a promise, with neither the agriculture minister nor the prime minister making any reference to it. The much-touted agri-market reforms too have floundered and so has the flagship programme to provide irrigation facilities to every farm. As many as 23 of the 99 delayed irrigation projects were to be completed by March 2017. The government has missed the deadline.On the political front, the strain on the NDA is showing. Modi had run a tight ship since coming to power in 2014, but allies such as Shiv Sena and Shettis Swabhiman Paksha have been growing restless and have raised a banner of revolt. The agriculture sector is desperately seeking new vigour and fresh leadership to pull it out of the crisis."

The file has been sent to the CM and we hope the compensation will arrive soon,"" said state agriculture minister Purnendu Basu . The beneficiary will be those farmers who have lost 33% and more of their crop to inclement weather.The announcement was made on the day when knives were out for the BJP government over the farmers' killings in alleged police firing at Mandsaur in Madhya Pradesh.Doling out of compensation isn't new in Bengal given that back in March 2015, to ease a crisis in potato cultivation, the state announced that 50,000 metric tonne of the crop would be directly procured from farmers in eight major potato-producing districts at the rate of Rs 5,500 per metric tonne and Rs 550 a quintal.The government then distributed them to schools for mid-day meals and ICDS beneficiaries at the rate of 1 kg per head per week.Till April 21, 2015, 20,000 metric tonne potatoes were procured and farmers were paid. The same year chief minister Mamata Banerjee requested the Centre to waive the crop loans to potato growers for the 2014-15 season and to arrange for fresh loans for the ensuing Kharif season.Since 2011, the Mamata Banerjee government, said sources, had been distributing agricultural input subsidy worth Rs 1,336.43 crore among 32.83 lakh farmers for damage of crops due to natural calamities under State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF).Faced with disquiet in their states, the governments in Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and now, Uttar Pradesh, have also adopted the route, though they have apparently not been able to reign in the crisis yet."

At least think about your children before you decide to end your life, said 13-year-old Pallavi Pawar with an unmoved expression on her face and resolve in her voice.It was around a decade ago that Pallavis father, a farmer in Maharashtras Jalgaon, decided to commit suicide, leaving behind his wife and four children. Ever since, Pallavis mother has been working on other farms to make ends meet.Memories flash byI dont remember his face clearly, but there are moments that flash before my eyes. There are memories I have of my father when he was happy, when he didnt show the turmoil brewing inside him.

There is always a way out, she said.Pallavi was one of the over 40 children and widows of farmers from drought-hit Maharashtra who had gathered at Jantar Mantar on Wednesday. They had joined the ongoing Kisan Mukti Yatra, as part of which farmers have demanded loan waivers and fixing of standard prices for their produce.Children dressed in white narrated tales of personal grief as placards reading Suicide is not the answer, Save our farmers, Farmers, dont commit suicide stood tall.The stories of these families were a grim reminder of how farmer suicides in India might just be numbers for city dwellers, but are harsh reality for children and women living in the rural belt  something they see almost everyday because of government apathy.Dont bargainWhen you buy vegetables and fruits from a farmer, you are quick to bargain for even Rs. 1. What you dont realise is that this Rs. 1 can be the difference between his children eating dinner or going to bed hungry, said Pallavi as she broke down.She continued, You will never know how much the heart of a father pains when he has to disappoint his children everyday; till one day he cannot bear it any longer and decides to end everything.Many such children who have lost their fathers stay at an ashram in Nashik, away from their homes, because their families cannot afford their upbringing.Little did three-year-old Sanju, who was guarding an earthen pot covered with a red cloth and playing with other children around, realise that the pot contained the ashes of his father who had hung himself two weeks ago after local money lenders started threatening him to repay a loan of Rs. 50, 000.Farming is riskySanjus uncle Raghu Ram, who was accompanying him, said that he was too young to realise the gravity of the loss. He couldnt help but point out how Sanjus entire life would be affected by the death of his father, who was the sole breadwinner for their family of eight.Farming is becoming a risky job. We do not want our children to live the lives that we are living. The government should think about the children and their future and do something to save our lives, he added.Eight-year-old Hari from Solapur said that he wants to be an engineer and help his mother escape the life of poverty.My mother tells me that if I study well I can help our family build a big house and buy a car, he said.Farmers from Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Punjab had also joined the protest with sacks of potatoes, demanding fair prices for their produce.We make a profit of Rs. 5 after selling a sack of potatoes.

The appeal will now be heard after two weeks.The sale of garlic through agents had been disputed since the past ten years after the state government's order in 2007 banning agents from selling the spice."
5a0f51649855b76bf13d7e3f,are vegetable prices soaring?,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/are-vegetable-prices-soaring/article19527329.ece,2017-08-20,"What happened in July?July saw a rise in inflation at the wholesale level to 1.88% from 0.9% in June, with the spiralling tomato prices, along with other food items, contributing significantly to this rise. Tomatoes saw a sharp inflation of over 209.5% in July against contraction of 29.4% in June, according to data from the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy. Brinjal registered a rise in inflation to 21.1% in July, from Junes contraction of 3.1%. The prices of tomato, onion and potato have increased in recent months owing to disparity between demand and supply on account of a drop in production because of unfavourable weather, a rise in transport costs, seasonality and supply chain constraints.Why is supply low?While the rise in the retail prices of tomato is being associated with low supply from key growing States, including Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh and Karnataka following heavy rain in a few regions that damaged the crop and hindered transport as well, onion prices have seen a rise on account of low supply from the southern States.The fluctuation in vegetable prices, which is commonly referred to as seasonal, is associated with the economics of demand and supply. The Centre maintains that seasonal fluctuations in market arrivals have hit supplies. The other reasons for the fall in supply are adverse weather conditions and imperfections in marketing channels. However, the clash of interests between the consumer, the producer and the middlemen is a key factor that policy-makers must urgently address.Where is the problem?For years, the consumer, the producer (farmer) and the middleman have had a clash of interest when it comes to agricultural commodities. While the consumer wants to buy a commodity at the lowest price, the producer (farmer) desires to sell the produce at the maximum price. The middleman, on the other hand, wants to maximise profits. Striking a balance among these stakeholders could possibly address the issue of price fluctuation to some extent. Vegetable producers, especially small landholders, depend on intermediaries to sell their produce. As vegetables find their way to the market, the cost of packaging, grading, transporting and fees, besides the margins of the middlemen, are some of the elements that determine the final price the consumer has to bear.Will better storage help?Agricultural commodities with a short shelf-life are prone to price fluctuation and hence require better infrastructure for marketing.Economists like Prof. M.S. Sidhu at Punjab Agricultural University believe that improved transport and upgraded storage infrastructure will keep a check on price volatility. Indias cold storage capacity at present is nearly 3.5 crore tonnes, which is short by 30-40 lakh tonnes, and it needs to be increased. Besides, cold storages need to be upgraded, equipping them to store fruit and vegetables at right temperatures so that they stay fresh.Also, the high cost of transport needs to be addressed. In the case of perishable vegetables, the government could consider promoting low-cost refrigerated trucks and weigh the option of freight subsidy.According to an estimate, there are 7,000-8,000 refrigerated trucks plying in India, mostly transporting pharmaceuticals and dairy products. Transport of perishable vegetables in refrigerated trucks could be one of the options that would help in better supply and availability of the produce.What about the supply chain?The mismanagement in the supply chain is another reason for the huge gap in prices that growers sell perishable agricultural commodities for and what the consumer pays. Creation of co-operative groups and societies are probably an alternative that could assist in minimising the marketing channel. They can work in tandem across the States and supply vegetables from surplus regions to places where the produce is in demand.Most farmers in India have small landholdings. Nearly 85% farmers are small, who have less than 2 hectares. Cultivation has become unviable for these small farmers, but through cooperative groups and societies even a small quantity of crop produced by the farmer can be marketed. This will stabilise prices and benefit consumers.VIKAS VASUDEVA"

On Thursday, a kg was selling at Rs. 64 in HOPCOMS against the average of Rs. 45 last month. The rates were in the range of Rs. 53 to Rs. 55 in the beginning of November.HOPCOMS managing director M. Vishwanath said the price rise was owing to a fall in supply.The production season for onions is over in the State and we have been procuring the vegetable from Nasik. But, owing to heavy rain in Nasik, farmers have been unable to harvest the crop and supply it to Karnataka, resulting in price rise. The situation should return to normal in a week to 10 days, he said.In retail chains, onion was selling at Rs. 50 on Thursday. But, the price is likely to increase on Friday and will be on a par with the HOPCOM rates, said a senior official from a retail chain.In the Bengaluru APMC market, supply of onion has trickled down to less than 30% of normal during this time of the year, said Ravishankar B. of Bengaluru Onion and Potato Merchants Association.As against an average of 2.5 lakh sacks during November, we got less than 50,000 sacks this month, he said.The fall in supply is also attributed to massive crop loss during the recent spells of heavy rain in September-October.This year sowing was delayed by over month. Instead of sowing in June, most farmers in the Chitradurga-Hubballi-Belagavi belt sowed onion in the second half of August.But the first sowing was ruined, as heavy rain led to water stagnation in the farms.There was massive crop loss in the second sowing as well owing to rain, bringing down the yield to less than half, he said.Onion harvest season in Karnataka starts from September and the crop floods the local markets till December. However, this year, the crop from Karnataka has almost stopped reaching the markets and now Karnataka is dependant on other States.There is hope that supply will stabilise by the new year when Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh harvest it. A good yield in these States is likely to ensure onion rates below Rs. 40 by new year.This year, sowing of onions was delayed by a month due to delayed monsoons.

Onion prices, too, went up, selling in retail for Rs. 50 to Rs. 60, depending on quality and location. With the onion crop severely hit in Karnataka, the neighbouring State is depending almost completely on supply from Nashik. Of the 300 trucks of onions entering Bengaluru APMC, over 250 are from Nashik.Ashok Walunj, former director, onion and potato division, APMC, said supply has improved since Wednesday.

This would be distributed across Mumbai Metropolitan Region. However, no supply at all from Karnataka has affected us the most. Whatever is coming to the market is from nearby districts including Nashik, Pune and Satara, but it isnt enough. As per APMC records, the vegetables division received around 40 vehicles of tomatoes on Friday.Mr. Rai added that as the tomato crop cycle is of 90 days, farmers have sown again and this produce is expected in the next 15 to 20 days. This will bring down rates further."
