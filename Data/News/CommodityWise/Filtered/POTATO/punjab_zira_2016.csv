(Source: Rana Simranjit Singh) Punjab Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal during a tour of Khadoor Sahib constituency shortly after the Congress MLA resigned. (Source: Rana Simranjit Singh)On February 13, Khadoor Sahib will elect an MLA who will serve for hardly a year before Punjab goes to polls. That is the way one section of the Congress would like to view it as it urges the leadership to ignore the bypoll and focus instead on the larger battle. The Aam Aadmi Party has already opted out. The other section in the Congress, however, would rather not give the Shiromani Akali Dal a walkover, especially with the high symbolism involved.The assembly seat is a segment of Khadoor Sahib Lok Sabha constituency in the border district of Tarn Taran. Three reasons make the bypoll a prestige battle for the Akalis. Khadoor Sahib is frequently identified with a panthic character. Out of the nine segments of the Lok Sabha constituency, the Congress won only three in the 2012 assembly polls, and Khadoor Sahib was one of them. Third, the Congress MLA has resigned for panthic reasons.Ramanjit Singh Sikki stepped down last October to protest against the desecration of the Guru Granth Sahib in Bargari and the governments inability to bring the guilty to book. Clear that they could not afford to lose the seat now, the Akalis took up the battle immediately. As early as November, Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal went on a sangat darshan tour through the constituency and allocated Rs 35 crore for various civic projects there. Apart from identity politics, the Akalis are also worried about a defeat being interpreted as a sign of anti-incumbency.A defeat for the Congress, on the other hand, could reflect poorly on new state party chief Capt Amarinder Singh, considering that it is a seat the Congress holds. But it is Amarinders political strategist, Prashant Kishor, who has suggested that the party ignore the inconsequential bypoll and concentrate on 2017 instead, a source in their camp said. The other camp is worried about opting out being interpreted as running away. The central leadership is yet to decide.Sikki is keen to recontest. Known as a potato king for his cultivation and cold stores, he is an Amarinder loyalist who quit as MLA without consulting then AICC chief Partap Bajwa. Sikki has not been talking in public of late. He will contest if the high command wants him to, said his aide Rana Gurjit. Last time, Sikki won by barely 3,000 votes.The Akali candidate is Ravinder Singh Brahmpura, a choice that could reopen old rivalries. Ravinder is the son of Ranjit Brahmpura, the sitting MP from Khadoor Sahib. In the 2012 assembly elections, Sikki had defeated the father, whom the SAD fielded for the Lok Sabha two years later.Ravinder Brahmpura said he had been looking forward to a contest with the AAP and the Congress. But it seems both parties have chickened out, he said. I will win. People are sick of Sikki, who has not kept in touch with them. He tried to win brownie points by playing the Sikh card and resigning. But it has worked against him.AAP is widely seen as a strong challenger to the Congress and the SAD-BJP in 2017. Its decision to stay out should come as a relief to both sides, but it still leaves other potential spoilers in the fray. Two AAP rebels, Bhai Baldeep Singh and Sumail Singh Sidhu, have announced that they will contest as independents. Yogendra Yadavs splinter group Swaraj Lehar is behind Bhai Baldeep.AAP state convener Sucha Singh Chotepur said they could not afford to spend so much on an election for the sake of being in the assembly for only a few months. Our party has neither the money nor the energy to be wasted on this election. We are prepared for 2017 even if they announce the polls today, he said.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

Suma, Deputy Director of Horticulture, here on Monday. Earlier, the department had procured certified seed potatoes and distributed them among 63 select farmers in the district.Speaking to presspersons here, Ms. Suma said that certified seed potatoes were sown in 63 farms, where irrigation facility was available. Owing to excess rainfall, the crop was washed away in three of those farms. In the remaining 60 farms, the yield has been good. For every bag of seed potatoes, the yield was six to seven bags. However, in fields where non-certified seed potatoes were sown, the yield was around three to four bags, he said.A. Manju, Minister for Sericulture, Animal Husbandry, and in-charge of Hassan district, announced recently that the district administration had decided to procure a large quantity of certified seed potatoes this year for distribution among potato growers. All these years, farmers were getting only non-certified seed potatoes from Punjab, he said."

The liver, spleen and penis of the bear and three legs of the nilgai were removed. Sources said that removing private parts of the sloth bear was a part of superstition for childless couples seeking a baby.The carcasses were found on Sunday in Bolunda by a villager who informed the forest officials. While range forest officer (RFO) of Goregaon V Kadam tried to downplay the incident by saying concrete information regarding removal of parts will come only after the post-mortem report, sources from the spot confirmed that some parts of bear were removed and nilgai was completely butchered. Also some two-three kilometres away from the spot, two potato bombs were found at a farm at Borgaon. ""Our volunteers saw huge fresh potatoes in the farm and got suspicious. On checking, they found a chip inside them. This is a new kind of bomb we have come across. It might if an animal ate the potatoes,"" said honorary wildlife warden of Gondia Sawan Bahekar.""The carcasses were tied to big stones before being dumped into the well so the they don't float up. The animals must have been poisoned, trapped or electrocuted,"" said the sources. Kadam said the post-mortem was conducted and investigation was in progress. ""Prima facie it appears the bear's body was thrown into the well four-five days back. Post-mortem will reveal what parts were removed,"" he added.Senior officials from the department said removal of organs is done under superstitious beliefs. ""In nearby villages, a bear's penis is believed to be a cure for childlessness as it is believed to bestow fertility. Liver and other parts are also used for making good luck bracelet,"" they said.Bahekar said that rampant poaching of scheduled animals showed that department had no control."

A good yield was expected this year but heavy rains induced by westerly disturbances flattened the wheat crop less than a month before harvest in Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh.The damage can be up to 50% in several districts of Haryana, Punjab, northern Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh, an agriculture ministry official said, adding that state governments had been asked to submit reports.Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal ordered divisional commissioner A Anbarasu to assess the damage to crops in the Capital. Have asked Div Commissioner to assess damage to crops of farmers in Delhi due to unseasonal rains (sic), Kejriwal tweeted.The governments of Madhya Pradesh, Haryana and Rajasthan also instructed officials to assess the loss.In 2015, the Centre gave states about Rs 8,000 crore for crop losses due to unseasonal rains.In Madhya Pradesh, protesting farmers took a tractor trolley full of hailstones to the office of the SDM, Banda in Sagar district and a chakka jam protest was held on NH-86 near Banda on the Sagar-Chatarpur road to draw the administrations attention towards damage to crops.In Rohtak, Ram Chander, a Dalit farmer who had taken two acres of land on contract for Rs 25,000, said rain and thunderstorm had almost completely destroyed his wheat crop. There is not much left, he said, crying for government help.Farmer Kundan Lal Jatav of Ghatla village in Rajasthans Alwar district said with tears in his eyes that rain and hail ruined his entire mustard crop on seven bighas of land.The government needs about 62 million tonnes of grains, including wheat and rice, to ensure steady supply of food items under the national food security law. Good crops in 2014 had ensured adequate stocks but crop damage in two consecutive years can exert a burden on the buffer maintained by the Food Corporation of India.Experts say the government might not have enough buffer stocks to sell in the market to keep wheat prices under check.Apart from wheat, officials admit, there has been extensive damage to mustard, potato and peas in these states. The showers have withered the flowering of mangoes in Uttar Pradesh and apple, pears and apricots in Himachal Pradesh.Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi raised the issue in the Lok Sabha and asked the government to assess the crop damage and provide adequate compensation to the affected farmers.After the hailstorm and heavy rains, farmers of northern India are in distress. The government must act to give relief to farmers affected by crop damage, Gandhi said in the Lok Sabha.(With inputs from Jaipur, Chandigarh, Bhopal and Meerut)"

Depending upon the number, the department would make arrangements to procure certified seeds, which will be distributed on first-come-first-serve basis.Hassan has been known for potato cultivation for the past several decades. However, in the last few years, potato growers suffered huge losses owing to late blight disease that reduced the yield substantially. Farmers were then dependent on potato growers in Punjab, who send them treated table potatoes for cultivation. In the last few years, farmers have been demanding certified seeds so that they can claim compensation.Last year, on an experimental basis, the department procured certified seeds for 60 farmers. Studies showed that the crop using certified seeds did not attract late blight disease. A subsidy was announced this year as the cost of certified seeds is higher than non-certified ones."

Telegraph pictureBhubaneswar, April 20: Faced with potato scarcity, the government today signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with Utkal Tubers India Private Limited to augment potato seed production.The state has been facing potato scarcity every year as its domestic production does not meet its demand. At present, the state produces two lakh metric tonnes of potato as against the requirement of 11 lakh metric tonnes. Hence, the state is dependent on other states, especially Bengal, to meet its potato requirements.The state had faced a severe potato shortage when Bengal government restricted its supply to Odisha and other states this year and previous year. At that time, potato was selling at Rs 60 per kg in retail market.The state government has now set a target to increase potato production from the existing level of two lakh metric tonnes to 11.25 lakh metric tonnes by 2017-18.On December 27, 2014, the state government launched a Potato Mission for planning ahead to avoid tuber shortage in the state. The mission has initiated several measures to make the state self-reliant in potato production.The task force set up by the state government has estimated that the state will require 1.2 lakh metric tonnes of potato seeds by 2017-18.However, there has been a big gap between the demand and supply as the domestic production is very low. So, the state government has to procure seeds from states, such as Punjab, Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh.According to plans, 1.10 lakh metric tonnes of potato seeds will be produced in the state by 2020-21.

Bengaluru-born Mukundan and his four co-founders were exploring the Internet of Things space, the idea of connecting ordinary objects to send and receive data. They considered telemedicine, but decided against it since many MNCs were in the business.That's when one of the founders pointed to the problems in dairy management, inclcuding that milk stored in regular containers become non-consumable after a few hours. His uncle was an organic dairy farmer in Tiptur, a town 150km north west of Bengaluru, and had trouble managing his cattle and the supply chain. They liked the idea so Mukundan, now 41, and the team spent the next eight months at the dairy farm and also visited farms in Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab and Odisha. Their company, Stellapps, used their learnings to develop automated dairy solutions, and now works with milk cooperative societies such as Aavin, Milma and Tirumala. Its products are in 250 farms and are used by three lakh dairy farmers.Agriculture in India is a $370 billion sector, but there is little application of technology to improve productivity and lift millions out of poverty . Now, a clutch of entrepreneurs is looking out of their city offices to the countryside to change this.Bengaluru-based Flybird Agri Innovations places sensors in the soil to detect moisture content and control irrigation. It's installed sensors in 45 villages in Karnataka to help farmers in the drought-hit state optimize irrigation. The company is supported by Chennai-based Villgro, a social impact fund backed by Dell Foundation.Most companies faced resistance when they first set up their equipment. ""Our work exposed the malpractices of middlemen,"" says Mukundan, who is now recruiting sales people in Delhi and Gujarat.The company is looking to expand to allied sectors such as fisheries where perishabil ity is high. Despite the need for technological intervention, there's not much funding coming to startups in this sector.Funding for Indian agriculture startups declined to $56 million in 2015 from $123 million the year before, according to data from Tracxn, a startup activity tracking platform. In 2015, also a drought year, just 20 agriculture-related startups raised money , but $6 billion was invested overall in tech startups that year. Agriculture startups attracted less than 1% of the total.""The agri funds in the country are mostly early stage investors, and the startups struggle to raise subsequent rounds of funding, thus prolonging their scale up,"" says Hemendra Mathur, an investor in agri businesses and former managing director of SEAF India Investment Advisory .While overall inflation has been under control, food inflation is growing at 7%, indicating a mismatch of supply and demand. India imported corn after 16 years, and it has turned from an exporter to an importer of soya. ""The inflation translates into an additional `70,000 crore opportunity.The propensity for consumption is also going up. Droughts are an opportunity to develop various seeds and processes that help reduce water consumption without affecting productivity ,"" says Mathur.Investors tend to view agriculture as a risky proposition. ""Most investors don't understand agriculture. The strong gov ernment intervention in the sector along with the vagaries of nature accentuate the business risks associated with startups in the space,"" says Srikrishna Ramamoorthy , partner at Unitus Seed Fund, an India-focussed fund supported by Gates Foundation that invests in social impact enterprises. It has invested in agri startup Villfarm and is looking for more opportunities. Ramamoorthy says most small farmers are not willing to try technology , and even the large farmers find the equipment too expensive.""Very often, it is not whether the technology is available. The problem is whether there are India-specific solutions,"" says Mark Kahn, founding partner of Omnivore Partners, an agriculture technology focused fund. It is backed by diversified agri-business firm Godrej Agrovet, SIDBI and SBI among other financial institutions. It has invested in Stellapps and Ecozen, a micro cold storage facility that works on solar power and can be installed even in small farms.In a country where more than half of the population still survives on agriculture, fruit and vegetables worth $2 billion are wasted because of lack of supply chain management and cold storage facilities.""The big cold storage products of the west are not affordable for many Indians,"" says Kahn. He has investments in 11 agriculture startups, including Skymet, which analyses weather patterns and predicts risk in agriculture for every season.Kahn was earlier head of business strategy and mergers and acquisitions at Godrej Agrovet and found that most agritechnology startups struggle to raise funding. He convinced Godrej to anchor a fund to support more firms and thus Omnivores was founded in 2011 with a corpus of Rs 260 crore.The same year also saw the establishment of the SONG Fund by Thomas Hyland, a US citizen who came to India and travelled around the country in trains for a year. He then went on to do a management degree from ISB, Hyderabad, and established Song, backed by US billionaire George Soros, Omidyar Network and Google Capital. ""For a country of India's size, there are not enough startups that focus on technologies that addresses the lower middle class and bottom-of-pyramid solutions,"" says Hyland, who has since started a second fund Aspada.These funds work with the startups for several months before committing to investments. Hyland, for instance, worked with Pune-based SV Agri for eight months before investing. SV works with potato farmers in Maharashtra and Gujarat to improve productivity by providing better seeds, as well as working on supply chain and processing.It supplies potatoes to ITC, Marico and Pepsico for chips. ""Not many big companies or startups want to do backward integration when it comes to agriculture because they don't want to get their hands dirty ,"" says Hemant Gaur, founder of SV Agri.Rohtash Mal, a former CEO of tractor firm Escorts, has established EM3, which provides farm machinery vehicles on demand. ""Only 10% of the country's farmers can afford farm machinery and ours is a pay-per-use model. We wanted to reach 90% of the farmers,"" says Mal, who has 15 centres in MP , Bihar and eastern UP . The price is based on the farmhold area measured using satellites. Each centre sends machinery to a 20km radius and Mal says 95% of his customers come back.""Government policies treat agriculture as a poverty alleviation method rather than a means to enhance productivity and raise incomes, and this keeps entrepreneurs out,"" says Mal.Mathur says that funds like Omnivore, Villgro and Aspada give him hope, and entrepreneurs are trying to start agri businesses. ""The slowdown in e-commerce and the entrepreneurial energy will spur a new wave in rural and agricultural innovation,"" he says."

This has indirectly helped the traders, who are said to be fleecing the farmers by selling the seeds at a higher price.Potato is a major commercial crop of the district and about 50,000 farmers are involved in its cultivation.Not a single farmer was present at a meeting convened by the district administration on Thursday here, which many farmers felt showed the negligence of the authorities concerned in lending an ear to the problems of farmers.Speaking to Deccan Herald, farmers explained that potato growers usually attend the meeting every year. But, this year, upset over the authorities attitude, no farmer attended the meeting. The failure in fixing the price for the seeds is beneficial for traders, who sell seed potatoes on credit and fleece the farmers, they complained.The traders do not give any receipt for the seeds sold. The farmers too are forced to buy the seeds, accepting the price quoted by the traders under fear that the stocks may exhaust. As there are no receipts, the farmers are eligible for a financial assistance of Rs 5,000 issued by the Agriculture department  Rs 450 for manure, Rs 3,090 for pesticides and Rs 1,540 for other expenses.Earlier, Deputy Commissioner V Anbukumar had intervened and held meetings with the farmers, inspected godowns and fixed a suitable price. This was helpful to the farmers. But after his transfer, the district administration has not shown much interest in the issue. Elected representatives too have turned a blind eye to the problem, the farmers complained.Certified seed potatoes dispatched from Jalandhar, Punjab, are just 2,065 tonnes. This is sufficient for about 500 farmers. According to reports, 56,000 farmers had sown potatoes last year. Hence, 55,500 farmers will get only ordinary seed potatoes, they added.The farmers said they fear blight disease attack and loss of crop if they do not get certified seeds."

Farmers, who started sowing operations by the end of May, had to wait until the end of June first week to begin cultivation. They waited for weeks keeping the land prepared.Around 80,000 quintals of non-certified seeds, supplied by merchants in Punjab, and 2,065 tonnes of certified seeds provided by the National Seed Corporation have been purchased by farmers in the district. While the certified potato seeds were priced at Rs. 27 a kg, the non-certified seeds were sold at up to Rs. 17 a kg. The State government gave Rs. 10 subsidy per kg of certified seeds.Normally, we keep the seeds procured in open air for 15 days before sowing. This time, we waited long because of delayed monsoon. We sowed the seeds soon after the first monsoon showers last week. From then on, there have been no rains. If it does not rain for a few more days, our seeds will start decaying, causing huge loss, said Ninge Gowda, a potato grower of Belavadi in Arkalgud taluk. Hassan district received an average rainfall of 45.36 mm since June 1. In the first week of this month, up to June 7, the district received an average of 25 mm rainfall, which is 6 per cent less than the normal expected for the duration.B. Suma, Deputy Director of Horticulture Department, on Wednesday, Seed potatoes are sown between May 15 and June 15, depending on rainfall. Farmers keep the land ready and start cultivation soon after the rains. As there were no pre-monsoon rains this year, farmers had to wait, she said.The officer said that late sowing might end up the crop attracting late blight disease. If it rains heavily in July, plants become vulnerable to late blight, she added. Potato is one among the cash crops cultivated by many farmers in Hassan. In the last five to six years, the yield in potato fields has come down drastically due to late blight, a fungal infection."

There has been a rise in food consumption occasions during the day. What used to earlier be four meals daily, including a snack, has doubled to 8-10 meals among urban consumers. While breakfast, lunch and dinner have been the established occasions for consumption with an evening snack thrown in, industry experts say new occasions like a pre-breakfast, pre-lunch, evening, pre-dinner and an after-dinner are gaining in popularity.A pre-lunch snack is said to be the preferred meal among young, on-the-go professionals and the blue-collared workforce. On the other hand, increased health consciousness, especially in the metros and tier I cities, has led to consumers having smaller portions through the day, albeit, more frequently. The culture of putting in longer hours at work and in commute has resulted in late dinners, which makes space for a pre-dinner snack.The shift in consumption patterns has triggered innovation in the packaged foods market. Sanjay Sharma, CEO, MTR Foods , said a professional today spends around 10 hours at work and an average of two hours commuting. This has given a boost to in-between snacking habits. ""This change in behaviour gave us an opportunity to tap this occasion by innovating and launching our traditional snacks portfolio, the on-the-go dessert portion packs and our breakfast-in-a-cup range which gives a quick meal in 3 minutes by just adding hot water.""There is also a significant increase in the women workforce, resulting in a change in food habits. Arabind Das, COO, Godrej Tyson Foods, said the consumer is looking for convenience and she wants to manage her time well, but expects the taste of food to remain intact. ""We are innovating to cater to such needs of the consumer. So while we already offer her a packaged pre-cut chicken, we have also provided her the option of a marinated chicken as well as ready-to-cook chicken nuggets. We see this trend not only in SEC A and B markets, but beyond that as well,"" said Das.Das said the growing number of occasions is driven by the consumer's desire to 'munch on something', with the evening snack emerging as the fastest growing space with a greater variety.Devendra Chawla, group president (food FMCG brands), Future Group , views food as the new entertainment. ""We live in times where instant gratification rules. No other category can provide better instant gratification than food.Whether it's IPL or Bollywood movies, we need food and without food everything seems incomplete. We reward ourselves with food even when alone. When tired, we eat or drink to feel charged up and to meet people, we create food as an occasion. So every occasion now has food intertwined in it,"" said Chawla.Categories like frozen snacks, instant pasta, soups and granola bars are being built as ""in-between meals"". Ready-to-cook packs, including gourmet dishes, too, are making their presence felt. Chawla said while this is largely a big city phenomenon, data reveals that metros such as NCR, Mumbai, Pune, Bangalore, Kolkata and even Punjab, to an extent, are over leveraged on these categories.""At home, too, thanks to freezers and microwaves, everyone is a mini chef. It's common to see kids making their own potato fries after school hours. On the other hand, changes in lifestyle and health consciousness, trainers, nutritionists and dietitians are coming up with plans of 6-8 meals a day. This has increased occasions to consume food."""

Ahmedabad, where eating out is almost like a norm, can be easily described as a foodie's paradise. With newer cuisines and tastes now ruling the palate of global Gujaratis, even the traditional Gujarati thali has gone through a delectable tranformation. From Chinese samosas, manchurian, dal-bati, nachos , Punjabi to Bengali sweets to churma laddoo and more, the thali has embraced essential elements of a melting pot  combining both modern and traditional in a delicious spread. AT checks out the thali.""For the longest of time the Gujarati thali was all about, two sabzis (green vegetables and pulses) one potato sabzi, 1-2 farsan (savories), dal/kadhi , rice, assorted Indian bread basket (chapattis, biscuit bhakris, puris ) one sweet dish along with chutneys, salad, buttermilk and pickles,"" say food industry observers. ""The thali was a mix of various textures ranging from flat, coarse, crunchy blended with an array of varied tastes. While there are dining halls in the city that still serve the original thali , other places have started including non-Gujarati elements to please the changing food habits and palate of the people.""With many restaurants and even food wagons dishing out some delicious different cuisines, the market for food has expanded making it a tough place to survive. While there are many thali joints that have stayed true to their original menu, there are other places who have included different cuisines to maximize their profit.""One of the major reasons why the thali has undergone such an evolution is because the city is witnessing a cosmopolitan population. Along with people from other states, you also see foreigners travelling to Ahmedabad quite frequently. So the restaurants have started including items that these people can easily relate to along with enjoying some new tastes,"" says restaurateur Abhay Mangaldas.Praveen Purohit, city based restaurateur feels that items like mini idli, Mexican tacos , nachos, spring rolls et al are there to fulfill the demand. He says, ""Not only our guests come from different parts of the globe, they also have good knowledge about food and are open to try something different. So we make it a point to include a few items that suit their taste buds as well. Another major reason is that majority of people find the thali too sweet for their taste, be it dal/kadhi or even the sabzi. So, we started infusing elements that balance out their taste.""While the city's population is going multicultural, there are many new thali places that are coming up at newer and posher locations, says Dilip Thakkar, founder of one of the Gujarati thali dining halls in the city. ""Initially, dining halls and restaurants serving authentic Gujarati thali were restricted to areas like Ashram Road, Usmanpura, Navrangpura and certain areas in the walled city. But now these restaurants have expanded to newer areas. And infrastructural cost goes up when you expand your business to a more expensive locality. To break even, or to make profit, you need more attractive dishes, which then amounts to the addition of popular and exotic dishes.""I love to indulge in fusion food. I have also been to restaurants and dining halls, where there are lot of items that are not there in the traditional Gujarati thali. Although, I wouldn't mind indulging in such a fusion thali occasionally, I still prefer the authentic Gujarati thali that has all the elements of Gujarat.Eating out means trying out something different or maybe a different version of your favourite cuisine. I have had Gujarati thali that had starters like samosa and manchurain and I think this inclusion is great as foodies from various parts of the world can relate to such items. They can relish the authentic Gujarati tastes whilst still having something that they love to indulge in.I love gorging on the authentic Gujarati thali, as it has many different textures and tastes. Although I'm not fond of fusion food, I would prefer if varied varieties of the same dish that are made in different parts of Gujarat are included instead of including different dishes that are not even a part of the traditional thali."

Pictures by Ruchira Gupta Jugeshwar is a Mahadalit sharecropper living off the edge of a pond in a remote village in Araria. Satyajit Kumar Singh is the CEO of Shakti Sudha Industries in Patna. Both are 46-year- old Biharis. Their lives are interconnected by the euryale ferox. This water lily with bright purple flowers is a common sight in wetlands and ponds in north Bihar. It produces a seed, called makhana in Hindi and fox or gorgon nut in English. It has become one of Bihar's biggest exports. A wild food source during the Neolithic period, the makhana was traditionally offered to Goddesses during festivals with pan (betel leaf) and machh (fish) in the Mithila region. It is now eaten roasted and popped or in a raita or kheer in Punjab, Uttar Pradesh and West Asia. It is a unique high-protein, fat-free crop that helps strengthen the kidney and spleen to relieve diarrhoea, regulate blood pressure, and relieve numbness and aches caused by arthritis. The American Herbal Products Association has given euryale seed a Class 1 rating. Thanks to its medicinal properties and use as a new form of snack, the demand for makhana has shot up globally. At the time of India's Independence, it grew only in Darbhanga and Madhubani. Now it grows in eight districts and Bihar accounts for 90 per cent of the annual world production with a market value of Rs 500 crore. Four actors who did not know each other played a role in Bihar being able to match the global demand for this little-known seed. The first actor was the Indian Council of Agricultural Research. It found a technique for the field cultivation of euryale so that more areas could be covered by this crop and the seed could be harvested for over nine months between July and March. Earlier, the harvesting season was just August and September. Now Araria, Purnea, Katihar, Samastipur, Supaul and Saharsa have begun to grow this lovely water lily. The second actor was Jugeshwar, a landless Tatma by caste, who would eke an existence by cultivating vegetables on other people's fields. He used to watch makhana pickers from the Malla caste come from Darbangha, pitch tents near his village, wrap up their lungis and walk knee-deep into the jalkar (pond) and come out with a long stem that had a fruit at the end. He followed the Mallas into the pond. At first he was put off by the thorns around the fruit and on the underside of the leaf. But they told him they earned Rs 500 a day for removing the thorns and pulling out the seeds. They taught him how to avoid the thorns and to apply mustard oil on his hands if he was pierced. Now he is an ace makhana picker. This unique inter-caste mobility has led to a larger work force involved in the cultivation, harvesting, shelling, drying, pounding and roasting of the makhana seed. Earlier one caste picked the gudiya (seed), another broke the seed and a third roasted it. The third actor was the Bihar government that made jalkars or water bodies common property, free of the ownership of contractors or water lords, making it possible for people like Jugeshwar to cultivate and harvest makhana on an impulse. The fourth actor was Satyajit Kumar Singh who envisioned that this product would replace popular snacks like potato chips and cornflakes and that he could set up a multi-crore business based on a supply chain that would pay five lakh farmers/labourers like Jugeshwar a fair procurement price. He set the ball rolling with a Rs 7-crore agro-based project whose annual turnover is now over Rs 50 crore. It supports 12,000 farmers and producers organised as interest groups and farmer producer groups. In 2006 farmers would get Rs 60 per kilo and they had to sell on credit. A decade later his company pays farmers Rs 240 per kilo directly and right at the time of procurement. Most - 80 per cent - of his supply chain are women. His vision is to take the company to Rs 5,000-crore turnover in the next ten years selling in the Middle East, UK, US and Europe. With the supply chain that he has worked so hard to create and the roasting machine he has introduced to take care of the most arduous part of processing the makhana seed, he is likely to succeed.

The award would be conferred to KVK Harnaut by PM Narendra Modi in the presence of Union agriculture minister Radha Mohan Singh at the foundation day function of ICAR to be held at Vigyan Bhawan, New Delhi, on July 16, said its head and senior scientist Dr Sanjeev Kumar. Interestingly, Nalanda is the home district of CM Nitish Kumar.KVK Harnaut has been chosen for the prestigious award for the promotion and spread of the practice of organic farming of vegetables in Nalanda district on a big scale, besides the two other equally spectacular achievements of setting the world records in paddy and potato production by two different farmers, among other achievements.The significance of promotion of organic farming of vegetables among the three notable achievements could also be gauged from the fact that today - even in the age of the use of high dose of pesticides and chemical fertilisers for increased agricultural yield - the ""organic farming"" is the buzzword the world over. 265 farmers of Nalanda have formed a federation of producers of organic vegetables, called 'Shere Bihar Farmers Groups,' which has received C-3 certificate from the organisation Ecocert for the export of their vegetable yield.KVK Harnaut senior scientist Dr Kumar said the vegetables produced by them through organic farming methods are exported to the Middle East countries and Bangladesh, as well as to metropolitan cities of Maharashtra, West Bengal, and even to neighbouring Jharkhand for the high-end customers.Dr Kumar said KVK Harnaut is the ""child"" of CM Nitish, as he opened it in 1992 when he was Union agriculture minister. Initially, the method of organic farming of vegetables was started by 30 farmers in Sohdih village over 15 hectares of land in 2010-11, but the acreage has spread to 5,900 hectares of land by 2015, he added.In several ways, KVK Harnaut also became a part of the saga of Bihar turnaround story from 2006, especially in the first term of CM Nitish.Sumant Kumar, a farmer from Darveshpura village, set a world record in paddy production by getting a yield of 224 quintals of paddy per hectare of land for which he was given the award of best farmer by ICAR in 2012-13, apart from awards by the Punjab and Bihar governments.Similarly, Rakesh Kumar from Sohdih village also set world record in potato production by producing 1,088 quintals of potato per hectare of land that also brought to him best farmer award at International Potato Expo, New Delhi, in 2014, apart from recognition from Punjab government and Bihar Agriculture University, Sabour (Bhagalpur)."

As soon as we sit down for a meal together, she says, I dont look like it, but I eat a lot. The flexibility she shows in her choice of roles reflects in her choice of cuisines as well. From Kashmiri to Chettinad and from Japanese to French, Koechlin has a taste for all of them. She talks of her fondness for yakhni pulao and butter chicken in one sentence. As I come from south India, I have a special affinity with spices. Whether it is rasam or wasabi sauce, the actor likes it hot.For this meal, however, Koechlin opts for Mediterranean cuisine with a mezze sampler. It is an assortment of hummus, baba ganoush, tabbouleh and beet root labneh with grilled pita, marinated olives, feta and falafel.At once, she picks up a falafel (deep-fried ball made with ground chickpeas and fava beans) and calls it a Spanish vada. In fact, even when shes on sets, Koechlin says sge thinks about food! You think about food but very rarely do you get good food on the sets, she says. We are lucky that we get to travel a lot with our films and hence get to taste different cuisines. Like Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara i ntroduced me to Spanish food. But if you are a vegetarian, Spain is not for you for they offer fish to vegetarians! she chuckles. The actor says she knows she needs to be healthy. So I drink carrot, beetroot and apple juice mixed together and of course lots of coconut water.Rather starve than cookHer appreciation of food and need to eat healthy hasnt resulted in motivation to enter the kitchen. I would rather go hungry than cook, she chuckles before adding that shed prefer baking though. I cant cook on a daily basis. But I can bake bread, apple pie and all sorts of cakes.Having spent her childhood in Puducherry, Koechlin has fondness for its cuisine. It is a mixture of French, Tamil and Vietnamese food. Spring rolls, fish curries and French baked potato with cheese dominate the scene. At home, I love to have fish prepared in coconut milk. And, then there is rasam which I could have throughout the year.For her last release, Waiting , the actor shot in Kochi and had her fill of fish curries.The film was was appreciated by critics. Reflecting on the experince while munching on tabbouleh, Koechlin says that director Anu Menon and she had to rework the character. We changed the lingo. We needed to arrive at the weird Hindi that a Mumbai girl speaks. Words like pakaoed entered the vocabulary. We also worked on the look. She wanted Tara to look desi , with kohl eyes, sharp eyebrows and black and curly hair. It was a different experience for me.Drawing from lifeAs for getting into the emotional core of the character, Koechlin maintains that she draws from life and from other peoples stories. But I think, ultimately, it has a lot to do with putting yourself in that situation while rehearsing with your co-actors which is possible when you have a co-actor like Naseer.Her process, she says, is about being genuine to the experience. I dont think you can prepare yourself for a scene like the first time you see your husband in a coma, she says. You cannot plan how you would react. I have had situations where my family members had to be in hospital for a long time but when I am actually shooting I dont recall those moments. Those memories are useful when you are preparing and rehearsing. By the time I am on the set, I am the character and not Kalki. So I could not refer to Kalkis personal experiences.Tara, Koechlin continues, was a reflection on how fast-paced life has become. We dont internalise ourselves very much. But then it could be seen as a stereotype of this generation. Anything can become a stereotype. We are all stereotypes. When we look at somebody in a salwar kameez we often say she is a Punjabi aunty type, a short skirt evokes a different reaction. It depends on how you play the character. If you find the humanness of that character, it will work.Similarly, the actor, who comes from a strong theatre background says, melodrama is often misunderstood. The same issue can be expressed in a subtle or melodramatic way. It depends on its treatment. It changes from independent to commercial cinema. In both cases, you have to be true to the character, you have to believe the emotion: only the ways of expression are different. The truth of the emotion remains the same, she says, citing the example of the recent Rajat Kapoor adaptation of Macbeth where she plays a dark clown. Dark humour is hard. The flow of the play is such that the three witches go on to become lady Macbeths.Theatre, particularly plays like these, keeps Koechlin on her toes. I dont take many holidays and when you enjoy your work, you dont feel like taking a break. I am lucky that I get to do what I want to. There are times when I have no work. So when you have lots of work, you better do it.But this attitude doesnt always work with the family. My mother usually stays with me for two months and after that we fight and she goes to stay with my brother, says the actor. And her concerns start from why I work so much. She would complain that I dont spend time with her, why I put so much stuff in the refrigerator.After the initial reluctance, the actor of French origin is now being accepted by all kinds of filmmakers. She feels she broke into the commercial mould with Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara . It is another matter that most could not still pronounce her surname right. I have put it in Devanagari on my Twitter account but it doesnt help.Meanwhile, we talk about how women-centric films are on the rise. I hope it is not just a trend and is going to stay. It is a natural evolution. And it is not just actors; we now find a lot of female crew members and DOPs.But, the actor is careful to underline that she is for gender balance and not star balance. Shes alluding to directors penchant for a particular set of female actors who have delivered hits. It should not be about star worship.The increasing presence of women crew members ensures that there is a female perspective, she says.If Waiting had a male director, he would have had a different perspective and it could be equally relevant as well. My point is at present we have many male perspectives and [we] need a balance. Indeed!There are times when I have nowork. So when you have lots of work, you better do it"

The anticipated ""recompense"" in the form of a Raj Bhavan posting did not come. The former Gujarat chief minister, who demitted office early this month, did not figure among the quartet appointed as governors today, with BJP sources hinting at several reasons for her absence from the list. The four who made it are Najma Heptullah, a former Union minister who has been assigned Manipur; V.P. Singh Badnore, a former Rajya Sabha MP from Rajasthan who goes to Punjab; Banwarilal Purohit, a former BJP MP from Nagpur and owner of the multi-edition newspaper The Hitavada, who moves to Assam; and Jagdish Mukhi, a Delhi BJP leader who will take charge in Andaman and Nicobar as lieutenant governor. Mukhi, a former professor, had aspired to be projected as the BJP's chief minister candidate in the last Delhi elections but was beaten to it by Kiran Bedi, who has since moved to Puducherry as the Union territory's lieutenant governor. After Anandiben left office as Gujarat's chief minister, BJP circles had expected her to be ""recompensed"" with a gubernatorial post. Sources said there were three reasons why she was not on the list. One, Anandiben had ""refused"" to leave Gujarat that votes in December 2017. She had publicly said so just before resigning as chief minister. A Gujarat BJP source, who made it clear that he was not aligned either with Anandiben or her adversary, party president Amit Shah, claimed the former chief minister was ""lobbying"" for her daughter Anar's induction into the party ""in lieu"" of her forfeiting her post. Anar, who describes herself as a ""social worker"" and an ""entrepreneur"", is alleged to have used the clout she derived from her mother's position to help her business associates set up a company on land near the Gir lion sanctuary, purportedly in contravention of established rules. The case, highlighted in sections of the media, became a hot potato for the BJP after the Congress gunned for Anandiben. It was believed to have precipitated her exit. ""In these circumstances, there is no way that Shah or the Prime Minister will facilitate Anar's entry into the BJP,"" the source said. Although Anandiben is considered a close political associate of Narendra Modi, sources said the Prime Minister had apparently taken a ""grim"" view of the Anar controversy. Since her departure, Anandiben, not exactly known to court publicity, has reportedly kept herself in the news. On August 15, she hoisted the flag at the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation's headquarters. Tomorrow, on ""Rakshabandhan"", she is scheduled to host a get-together at a school in her Assembly constituency, Ghatlodiya, in Ahmedabad. Two, Anandiben would have to resign as an MLA if she becomes a governor. A by-election will have to be held in her constituency within six months. Sources said the BJP fears that if it loses Ghatlodiya or even retains it by a margin lower than what Anandiben had secured in 2012, it could scale down the morale of party cadres in the run-up to the state polls. Three, the governors of two large states, Tamil Nadu and Madhya Pradesh, are due to retire by end-August. Both K. Rosaiah (Tamil Nadu) and Ram Naresh Yadav (Madhya Pradesh) were appointed in 2011 by the then UPA government. Sources said it was ""possible"" Anandiben might be sent to one of these states, after BJP leaders take into account the political factors, especially the by-election and the fear that her seat might go to the Opposition."

Legal action will be taken against those traders selling substandard quality of seeds in the district, warned Deputy Commissioner Deepti Kanade.She was speaking at a preliminary meeting to discuss about potato cultivation organised by the Horticulture department here on Tuesday. The meeting was attended by the traders, farmer leaders and the representatives of the Horticulture department.Farmers should not go for low-quality seeds which are available at a cheaper rate and thereby compromise with the quality. This would only lead to low quality production and thereby bring in only loss for the cultivators. Only quality seeds can ensure quality yield and the traders should also sell only quality seeds. Usually there will be variation in the weight of a 50 kg bag of seeds. Slight variation up to one or one-and-a-half kg is not a matter of concern. However, a larger variation in weight should be brought to the notice of the trader, she said.District unit president of the Raitha Sangha Bhaktarahalli Bhairegowda said, For the last three years, the farmers from the district had been facing potato crop loss. It is better to take all the precautionary measures. The traders who sell seeds should also provide bills for the goods sold. Measures should be taken to halt the private traders who are engaged in the sale of low quality seeds.Not sufficientThe traders informed the meeting that only a couple of companies sold certified seeds. However, this was not sufficient to meet the demand for certified seeds that is required in the district.Senior Assistant Director of the Horticulture department, Munegowda said the traders from the district often purchased potato seeds belonging to a general variety from the farmers of Jalandhar. However, there are a number of seed selling centres which have been certified by the National Seeds Coporation in Punjab, which sell certified seeds. Our farmers can purchase from these centres also, he informed.The deputy commissioner said that a list of certified sellers will be handed over the Horticulture department. The traders can purchase seeds from these sellers.For the first time in Hassan district, certified seeds were distributed by the Horticulture department directly to the farmers houses, on an experimental basis. The certified potato seeds were sold at a subsidised rate and the department has supplied 2,800 tonnes of seeds. And there have been reports of good yield too from the district. In order to distribute seeds on the similar lines in Chikkaballapur, an aeroponics project has been created, informed Munegowda.The deputy commissioner said, The farmers should transplant the potato plants during the period which is most suitable and recommended by the scientists and the traders should not sell the seeds before the stipulated time, she said.The potatoes, if cultivated between 18 and 22 degree celcius, will give a good yield. Such warmth in the atmophere is reported in the September-October months in Chikkaballpur. Hence, the potato produce should be transplanted between October 15 and Novermber 30, according to the experts, Kanade informed.A few traders informed the meeting that the sale of seeds had already begun at Bangarpet in Kolar district. Most of the farmers from Chikkaballapur were visiting Bangarpet to purchase the seeds. This should be avoided.Kanade assured them that she would be speaking with Kolar deputy commissioner in this regard.Biggest centreThe district has the biggest potato seeds producing centre. But so far, it has not produced any seeds at all. The centre should start the production of seeds and provide them to the farmers, the meeting was informed.Taluk unit president of the Raitha Sangha Maralukunte Ramanjinappa, joint secretary C B Shrinivas, leaders S Eshwarachari, S Ramesh, Taduru Manjunath, Potato Traders Association president R Vijaykumar, vice-president Ramaswamy, traders Prabhakar, R H Narayanswamy, Venkatesh, Mohan Murali, Horticulture department deputy director B Raghu, APMC secretary Ramdas, Agriculture Marketing department assistant director Bathula, tahsildar and several others were present on the occasion."

Further, directly attacking Singh, Sherawat said the he has seen disturbing reports about women being exploited in Punjab in return for ticket to fight elections and that the party high command is unaware about his deeds as party representatives in Punjab.The controversy becomes a political hot potato for the AAP as Punjab is heading to elections next year, with high stakes for the party.Sehrawat had also hit out at AAP's Delhi unit convener Dilip Pandey, questioning his conduct in the national capital and said that the situation is becoming indefensible and disgraceful. Action needs to be taken to remove rotten elements.All the allegations are baseless, I have worked for decades in politics and that has been recognized by the party and hence I am here.

That's changing now as village youths head for the cities to find better paying work in services and factories.Experts say the shortage of farm labour and its rising cost are among the main reasons for the increasing mechanisation of Indian farming. ""This is not restricted to pockets but spread all across,"" said T R Kesavan, chairman of the technical committee and immediate past president of Tractor Manufacturers' Association. While tractors still outsell other farm equipment like power tillers and combine harvesters, the gap has closed in recent years.The market for specialised machinery, such as threshers, rotavators, transplanters, reapers, zero till drills, laser levellers and power weeders, is worth Rs 32,000 crore now, said Surendra Singh, technical adviser to industry body Agricultural Machinery Manufacturers' Association (AMMA). He added that the industry could touch the Rs 37,000-40,000 crore level in three-five years, growing at its present yearly rate of 5-8%. That will make it as large as the tractor market is now.""Currently, the tractor market is around Rs 40,000 crore while the implements market is around Rs 32,000 crore,"" said Singh.While local players like Tirth Agro Technology that makes Shaktiman brand of implements have cornered 85-90% of the market in the initial shift to mechanisation, the organised players have started paying closer attention to this segment. ""Till recently, the segment was reserved for the small-scale sector,"" said Kesavan. ""Now that it has been thrown open, technologically superior implements and equipment will be introduced.""Tractor market leader Mahindra & Mahindra, for instance, has acquired 33% stake in Mitsubishi Mahindra Agri-Machinery and 35% stake in Finland-based Sampo Rosenlew, which, analysts say, will increase its presence in the agri-implements business in India.Similarly, tractor major Escorts is considering a more significant presence in this market. Ravi Menon, CEO of Escorts' agri-machinery business, said, ""Currently we have tie-ups to pick up implements as part of the total solution package we offer our customers, but we are evaluating options.""German company Lemken and Italian Maschio Gaspardo have set up manufacturing facilities in India. Grimme India, another MNC subsidiary, is offering implements for potato crops. Experts say it's a matter of time before other big global players enter the field as India is a vast opportunity.The size of the global implements business is estimated to be $131 billion in 2018.The migration of unemployed village youths to cities is unlikely to stop now. ""The younger generation is shunning farming because it feels it is a menial job and the remuneration is not commensurate with the effort put in,"" said Kesavan, adding that, ""Studies have shown that 50% of India's population will live in urban areas by 2030. This migration from villages to cities will lead to a lot of proxy farmers taking care of multiple plots of land. When you have large landmasses, you have to mechanise.""Farmers' push for higher crop density is also driving the increasing use of farm implements. It is expected to increase yields by 25-30% in states with a low level of mechanisation at present, and by up to 10% in states like Punjab that are already highly mechanised."

With limited production of quality seeds, there is a huge gap between supply and demand.The Government Task Force on Potato Mission has estimated that the State's requirement of tuber seed at 1.2 lakh tonnes by 2017-18.The Government has been procuring large quantities of potato seeds from West Bengal, Punjab, Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh every year to meet the demand. This not only drains the State exchequer but also results in reduction of quality due to long distance transport.The Task Force had recommended for seed production to be done inside the State with private involvement. The potato seeds to be produced by UTIPL will be marketed inside the State and in Eastern India.The company will get 10 acres of land at Deras farm for establishment of tissue culture laboratory and 40 acres of land at Similiguda in Koraput for seed multiplication with usual Government rent for a period of 15 years.The company will establish the required infrastructure and seed multiplication at their own cost which will be around `20 crore, official sources said.However, the State Government will provide infrastructure support like road connectivity, electricity and water supply to the project sites."

(Source: Twitter/@BJP4India) BJP President Amit Shah. (Source: Twitter/@BJP4India)The BJP will certainly go to the people on the issue of surgical strikes in PoK, BJP president Amit Shah said today lashing out at Rahul Gandhi over his dalali barb at Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Yesterday, wrapping up his UP kisan yatra in the capital, Gandhi had accused Modi of hiding behind the blood of soldiers and added: Unki aap dalali kar rahe ho. (You are cashing in on their sacrifice). This morning, Gandhi tweeted: I fully support the surgical strikes and I have said so unequivocallybut I will not support using the Indian Army in political posters and propaganda all across the country.By his khoon ki dalali comment, Rahul has insulted the Army, the martyrs and 125 crore Indians, Shah said.Dalali is what Congress did from Bofors to Embraer, from 2G to coal. Dalali involves some goods, what does he think this is about? Can one put a price to the blood of jawans?The morale of the very Army that risked their lives to destroy terror camps has been broken by him. I do not know what he was trying to achieve but the government, BJP and the people are standing firmly behind the Indian Army, Shah said accusing both Gandhi and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal of politicising the Army.The question is why you (Congress) are not happy, enthusiastic and proud of this, Shah said. It shows there is some fundamental flaw in youInstead of joining people in their happiness, the Congress party is with Pakistan in its despair.The BJP will certainly go to the people on the issue of surgical strikes, Shah said in reply to a question whether the strikes would feature in the BJP campaign in next years Assembly elections in Punjab and Uttar Pradesh.Zaroor jayenge, he said. I said at the very beginning that if some tehsil president had put up some posters (a reference to posters celebrating the strikes) that should not be taken into account. But we will go to the public because Army morale needs to be boosted and this achievement of the Army needs to be lauded. It was the achievement of the Army and the political will of Narendra Modi. Government was careful from the first day not to politicisethat is why the briefing was done by the DGMO and not by a political functionary, Shah said.Rahul Gandhis clarification in the morning did not cut much ice, Shah said claiming that BJP had kept all its poll promises  from securing the countrys borders and not allowing anybody to get away with beheading our jawans to one rank, one pension.Suggesting that those casting doubts on the authenticity of the strikes are anti-India leaders, Shah said, The whole country, BJP and its government are standing firmly behind the Army. We do not trust the anti-India rhetoric of leaders, we trust the bullets of our Army men.Gandhi, he said, should concentrate on potato factory, a swipe at this comments to farmers that they want potato factories. Shah also appeared to dismiss demands for releasing video evidence, saying who is seeking them.Shah brushed aside Pakistans denial. Then what was the special Pak Parliament session all about, he asked, and why is the Pak Prime Minister who comes to Islamabad only 3-4 times a month camping in Islamabad.As for Kejriwals remarks that India should counter Paks denial propaganda, he said that there is no doubt who is benefiting from his comments because Pakistanis are making him trend on twitter. The reference was to the hashtag PakStandsWithKejriwal that began trending on Thursday.Shah said Congress and Rahul Gandhi dislike Modi and recalled expressions like maut ke saudagar, (merchant of death) and zeher ki kheti (sowing poison) used by his mother and Congress chief Sonia Gandhi against Modi. The BJP won a two-thirds majority in Gujarat after maut ke saudagar and a majority after zeher ki kheti comments, Shah said, wondering how the latest statement will play out.He lauded the media for what he called its support of the government on its stand on Pakistan.Investigative journalists have dug out the truth from across the border, he said.

Shah asked and put the Congress leaders remarks in the same league as maut ka saudagar, an old comment from the party referring to Modi.The army raids were being touted as revenge for Uri and could become a talking point for next years assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Uttarakhand, Goa and Manipur.Posters hailing Modi for the raids have surfaced in UP, prompting the Congress and BSP chief Mayawati to allege that the BJP was trying to gain political mileage out of the military action.I fully support the surgical strikes and I have said so unequivocally, but I will not support using the Indian army in political posters and propaganda all across the country, Gandhi tweeted,standing by his dalali remarks.The political slugfest came on a day home minister Rajnath Singh announced sealing the entire the India-Pakistan border, while the finance minister said in Washington that every major terrorist incident in the world has a Pakistani footprint.The blame game over the surgical strikes broke out on Tuesday when Congress leader Sanjay Nirupam called the military action fake and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal asked the government to release proof to counter Pakistani propaganda against the operation.Mayawati, a political rival to both Congress and BJP, condemned the attempt to profit from the armys cross-border action ahead of the UP polls.Only the army should be felicitated and hailed for it not any leader, the defence minister or the Prime Minister, she said.Congress leaderKapil Sibal called for a stop to this poster-baazi and politics on the armys successes.BJP chief Shah attributed these posters to decisions taken by local leaders, but credited the Prime Minister for his leadership. He insisted that his party wont desist from using the issue during the elections to boost the morale of the armed forces.He lashed out at the Congress and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) for seeking proof.Who is being questioned  the soldiers who risked their lives? What did Kejriwal want when he asked for proof? And after his statements, Kejriwal began trending (on social media) in Pakistan. From this, it is clear his words have helped whom, he said.Shah tried to corner the Congress, with scams such as Bofors guns deal and 2G spectrum auction when the party was in power.The use of the word dalali for soldiers shows the Congresss mindset. The word is synonymous with the opposition party whose leaders were embroiled in several scams worth thousands of crores, he said.Shah said Gandhi should concentrate on the potato factory for farmers as his understanding of the problems of agriculture sector is limited to that only. He was referring to Gandhis remarks made at a public meeting during his Delhi to Deoria march in UP.Congress leader Sibal hit back, accusing the BJP of giving birth to Jaish-e-Mohammed as it was during the previous NDA government that the militant outfits chief, Maulana Masood Azhar, was released from jail in a hostage exchange.But the BJP was not alone in criticising Gandhis remarks. The AAP too latched on to the issue.Such words (dalali) should not have been used by Rahul Gandhi. These are the times for us unite & stand along army,Kejriwal tweeted."

This has had a cascading effect on retail prices which, in case of patotatoes and onions, have shot up by anwhere between 50% and 100%.""I bought potatoes for under Rs 30 a kg on Friday. Today, the prices have gone up to Rs 50. Tomatoes and onions too have increased from Rs 10 to Rs 20. In Delhi, however, the vegetable prices continue to be stable,"" said Kavya Kohli, a resident of Sector 46.Increase in the prices of tomatoes and onions particularly has affected households.""We can opt for brinjal instead of cauliflower or beans instead of peas in case of price rise but we cannot replace essentials like tomatoes and onions. Vegetable prices generally drop with the arrival of winter,"" said Sanjeev R. Shukla, a resident of Sector 4.Vegetable prices, both wholesale and retail, soared within days of demolition of all the 175 makeshift shops in the Khandsa market on Saturday by the agricultural produce marketing committee. The space was cleared to set up an open-shed agricultural mall here.President of the Khandsa market association Inderjeet Thakran told TOI, ""While the authorities have razed the makeshift shops, they have no alternative arrangement in place to shift the wholesale vegetable market until the open-shed mall comes up. Vegetables in Gurgaon come from different parts of Haryana, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh and even Bangalore. Wholesalers, who used to get 80 to 85 tonnes of vegetables everyday, have reduced the quantities to 20 to 22 tonnes for lack of space to store the produce. This has led to decrease in supply leading to increase in the prices.""""We have met all the senior officials and even the agricultural minister and chief minister to discuss the issue at hand. The agricultural minister has called us on October 13. We are only demanding a temporary place from where the wholesale market for time being. The income of over 10,000 families is at stake. Moreover, the common man is bearing the brunt of the government action,"" Thakran added.Agricultural experts feel the absence of the wholesale vegetable market may further increase the vegetable prices, leading to black marketing.""Retailers have already increased the veggie prices owing to decrease in supply. the government's decision to demolish the mandi could be affect the common man adversely,"" said Tarun Kumar Dhull, a city-based agricultural expert.Spread in an area of 2.5 acres, the Khandsa Market was set up in Gurgaon in 1984. Until it was demolished, the market received over 200 trucks carrying 300 tonnes of vegetables and fruits every day."

The new US Congress will have a record representation by men and women of Indian origin. Women in America are openly exulting that next Tuesday's voting could take female representation in both chambers of Congress to more than 20 per cent for the first time. Also, depending on whether you are a rich American, not-so-rich or a poor citizen, the millionaire class which will proliferate the next Senate has become a hot potato or a matter of pride in the ongoing election campaign. But the record about to be set in legislative representation is a landmark in the history of Indian immigration to the US. Although Indian American presence on Capitol Hill will go up by record numbers, it will still not be as high as in Canada where Punjabi is the fourth most spoken language in its House of Commons. Not yet. If all goes well for Kamala Harris in Tuesday's voting in California, she will become the first American with Indian roots to become a member of the US Senate. Harris is California's incumbent attorney general. In nearby Washington state, Pramila Jayapal is equally on the way to making history for the Indian American community if she is elected - a virtual certainty going by opinion polls - to the US House of Representatives on Tuesday. The US Congress has never had an Indian American woman in its ranks. Jayapal is an incumbent state Senator in Washington. She will replace a retiring Congressman who has a stellar record of helping India and promoting Indo-US friendship although he is racially white. Jim McDermott, one of the founding members of the Congressional Caucus on India and Indian Americans, represented Seattle and neighbouring areas in the House for just under 28 years. In a part of Silicon Valley which is home to technology firms Apple, Intel, Yahoo! and eBay, Ro Khanna, a former Stanford University lecturer who is only 40, is likely to replace incumbent fellow Democrat Mike Honda. California's curious election law allows the two top contenders from the same party to contest against each other in the poll. Another near certain win next week contributing to the new record is Raja Krishnamoorthi who is contesting in Illinois for a seat being vacated by incumbent Congresswoman Tammy Duckworth, a fellow Democrat. When Louisiana's Bobby Jindal was elected to the House of Representatives in 2004, Indian Americans were over the moon. Since Dalip Singh Saund in 1956, no Indian American had gone to Capitol Hill as an elected representative in the lower chamber of Congress. When Jindal was elected Louisiana's governor five years later Indian Americans once again became unrepresented in the US national legislature although their disappointment was tempered in due course by having him - and later in 2011 - Nikki Haley, South Carolina's incumbent governor in two significant gubernatorial positions in America. Ami Bera filled that gap in 2012 when he was elected to the House from California. He and Tulsi Gabbard - who is not Indian, but Hindu - have since become emblematic of Indian causes on Capitol Hill. Bera faces a tough contest this year and Indian Americans fear he may not be re-elected. Although she has only been in a state-level contest the cynosure of this election season for people with Indian roots in this country has been Kesha Ram, who unsuccessfully ran in the Democratic primaries for Vermont's Lieutenant Governor. She continues to be a member of Vermont's General Assembly. Her popularity among Indian Americans is owed to her success eight years ago in being elected to the state legislature at the age of 22, the youngest member of the community to win any public office in the US. Meanwhile, widespread expectations of a Hillary Clinton victory in the presidential election have prompted Indian Americans to lobby with her campaign for positions in the next US administration, especially in a Clinton cabinet. Among the Indian American front-runners is Neera Tanden, president of a Democratic-leaning think tank, the Centre for American Progress. Speculation is rife that Tanden could be in the next cabinet as the secretary for health and human services. Clinton has promised that if elected, 50 per cent of her cabinet will be made up of women. Since her victory, if it comes through, is significantly owed to African Americans, Hispanics and Asians, Clinton will go out of her way to ensure ethnic diversity in her administration. Tanden's strength is that she worked for the drafting and adoption of Obamacare formally known as the Affordable Care Act, Barack Obama's signature health care reform which Clinton has pledged to uphold. Circles close to John Kerry, the secretary of state who succeeded Clinton when she quit to enter the presidential campaign, indicated that Richard Verma, the incumbent US ambassador to India, could be the next Permanent Representative to the UN, a position with cabinet rank in the American system. Ajay Banga, who headed the US-India Business Council for several years, the president and CEO of Mastercard, is being talked about for a senior economic position in the Clinton administration as is Neal Katyal, the former acting solicitor general. Other Indian American names doing the rounds are Vivek Murthy, the current US surgeon general, and Raj Shah, whom Obama appointed as head of the US Agency for International Development."

So, he set the entire field on fire. He was also joined by the field owner, Mahinder Singh (name changed) as both wanted to clear the straw as soon as possible to prepare the field to sow wheat. Wheat sowing, which has already begun in the state, will continue till November 15.Singh owns 10 acres of land on which he sows wheat, paddy and potato every year. We have harvested paddy a couple of days back and now we are left with less than two weeks to complete wheat sowing for which fields are to be prepared and there is no alternative available with us to remove the stubble. To clear the field for sowing the next crop, we have to burn the straw, he insisted.Government is imposing fine on us but not giving any solution on how to manage the straw. We do not want to spoil the environment as we too live in the same polluted environment, which we create by burning straw, but have no option, said another farmer.Ploughing the stubble costs us around Rs 1,500 per acre which is not viable and the government should support us in clearing the field as the machinery required for stubble management is beyond the reach of more than 70-75 per cent farmers of Punjab, said another farmer, adding that machinery required to manage straw is costly and without government support, it is not possible for majority farmers to use it.Despite the ban on straw burning in the state, one could see a large number of burnt fields and fires every 100-200 metres in Kapur village. It was the same at over two dozen villages in Jalandhar, Kapurthala and Hoshiarpur districts that The Indian Express visited on Thursday.According to the Punjab Remote Sensing Centre, which measures stubble burning through satellite images, Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) officials maintained that it has increased this year.According to agriculture department sources, out of over 20 million tonnes of paddy straw, which Punjab produces annually, nearly half has already been burnt. Around 70-75 per cent (nearly 15 million) of the 20 million straw is burnt to clear land for the next crop.This year, 30.10 lakh hectares are under rice cultivation against 29.75 lakh hectares last year. Now, the burning fields of Punjab have resulted in a dense smog cover over Delhi, for the past couple of days. Incidentally, the National Green Tribunal has summoned Punjab for creating environment pollution not only in the state but up to Delhi thereby resulting in serious health issues in the national capital.PPCB has formed several teams along with officials in every district of the state this year to take action against those burning straw and even booked over 500 farmers. They are being fined Rs 2,500, Rs 5,000 and Rs 15,000 for setting on fire two acres, five acres and over five acres, respectively. In Jalandhar alone, around 90 farmers fields have been raided by these teams.Our officials have already raided over 500 farmer units, said PPCB Chairman Manpreet Singh Chatwal.Dr Jasbir Singh Bains, Director of Punjab Agriculture department, said paddy is sown over a huge area in Punjab for which we have to make a large number of machines available to every farmer in the state. Though big farmers can afford to purchase machines on their own, that cannot be expected of the small and marginal farmers. So, the Centre has to help farmers purchase the machines at nominal rates. In Punjab, not more than 10 per cent paddy stubble can be manged with the available machinery. We are also changing the mindset of farmers through Kisan Mela so that they can adopt the new technology, said Bains. Though awareness is increasing, we still have a long way to go, he added.Second generation ethanol production plant in SangrurIndian Oil Corporation, in association with the Punjab Bureau of Investment Promotion (PBIP) and the Punjab government, is also going to set up an ethanole plant by using surplus crop residue and other biomass as feedstock. Sangrur district has already been identified as one of the potential locations where surplus biomass is available. And this plant will reduce carbon emission produced by traditional burning of crop residue by farmers, informed Chatwal, adding that a 50-acre plot has already been identified to set up this plant, which will help to manage the straw as well as provide additional income to farmers, he added.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"
,,,,,,,58f0fa31a3d24b3489ce64dd,Linking food and nutrition security,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/Linking-food-and-nutrition-security/article16217399.ece,2016-11-08,"The euphoria around the National Food Security Act (NFSA), 2013, seems to have dwindled. As per the statements by Minister of State for Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution, Ram Vilas Paswan, the Act was to be fully implemented across India by July 2016. As of now, only five States have fully executed it as per the provisions of the Central Act and the progress in other States has been tardy. The front runners are Punjab, Haryana, Chhattisgarh, Maharashtra and Rajasthan. The Act has been partially implemented in Bihar, Delhi, Himachal Pradesh and Karnataka. Preliminary surveys undertaken in some of these States have revealed positive outcomes in terms of administrative reforms, significant increase in the number of households having ration cards, and improvement in the distribution and consumption of food through fair price shops. A few of them had already initiated reforming the distribution system much before the Act was presented in Parliament. The Act, if fully implemented, is likely to benefit 720 million people through availability of 5 kg per capita per month of subsidised foodgrains (rice, wheat and coarse cereals) at a much lower rate than that in the open market. This would ensure food security and enhance nutritional status.The Odisha studyThe two concepts are interlinked, but nutrition security has a much wider connotation than food security. It encompasses a biological approach, that is, adequate and safe intake of protein, energy, vitamin and minerals along with proper health and social environment. The nutritional aspect of the quantity of grain to be distributed to each person under the Public Distribution System (PDS) is somewhat less researched, though the Act has aimed at attaining this goal. Poor quality of food lacking essential micronutrients and no diet diversity, and unhygienic conditions of storage may come in the way. There are other promising features under the Act, such as free daily meals for children and maternity benefits, including cash for pregnant women, which can combat rampant undernutrition (calorie deficiency) and malnutrition (protein deficiency) across the country. These steps may perhaps complement the existing nutritional programmes such as mid-day meals and Integrated Child Development Services.We present results from a study in rural Odisha on the contribution of PDS towards households intake of foodgrains and the quantum of calorie and protein levels. A primary survey of 385 households was carried out during 2014-15 in three extremely poor districts viz. Koraput and Bolangir in the so-called KBK (most backward) region and Nayagarh in the non-KBK region. While KBK districts follow a universal PDS, non-KBK districts have a targeted one.There is high prevalence of undernutrition and malnutrition in the selected districts. The estimates, adjusted on the basis of age, sex and work as recommended by the nutrient requirements and dietary allowances of Indians drawn up by the Indian Council of Medical Research-National Institute of Nutrition in 2010 reveal the undernourished population to be 50 per cent and the malnourished to be 43 per cent on an average for all the districts together. Calorie and protein deficiency is relatively higher (see graphic), nearly 68 per cent among the Antyodaya Anna Yojana (AAY) households, known to be the poorest of poor. It is much higher in Koraput district at 72 per cent, way above the State average of 60 per cent.Rice is the key staple food in the surveyed areas and acts as a major source of energy intake. The monthly per capita consumption of rice is estimated to be 11.6 kg, of which 33.7 per cent is sourced from the PDS by all beneficiaries. Since AAY households have higher quota and accessibility under the PDS, the contribution is much more at 73.9 per cent. Cereals (wheat and rice) make up 70 per cent of the calorie intake and 66 per cent of the protein intake, though the magnitude varies across districts. More importantly, the contribution of PDS to energy intake among AAY households is double (60 per cent) that of other beneficiaries.Better accessibility to food and hence energy intake of poor people, especially those under AAY, has been made possible due to concerted efforts initiated by the government. Major reforms initiated from 2004-05 that are worth mentioning include abolition of private procurement and storage system, and a greater role for public agencies in controlling diversion of foodgrain from the godown to the millers; proper recording of procurement, storage and distribution of grains across the departments; and distribution of food through self-help groups and gram panchayats and its regular monitoring at the block and ward levels. While revealing their satisfaction with the PDS, the beneficiaries refuted the idea of having a cash transfer system in place of the existing in-kind transfers, primarily due to fear of price hike and inadequate infrastructure i.e. roads, banks, and long distance of market from the village. In fact, the beneficiaries proposed an increase in the coverage of commodities to pulses, onion and potato under the PDS in their respective areas.Replicating Odisha elsewhereThe efforts of the State government in ensuring food security should be replicated in States that are yet to fully implement the Act and reform their respective distribution systems. Many studies have emphasised on dietary diversification to ensure appropriate nutritional intake for large segments of the poor population. This may be an important step to be taken up in States where a revamped PDS is making ground, such as in Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Bihar. Provision has been made under the NFSA to provide one additional coarse cereal viz. millet along with wheat and rice, which can further enhance the nutritional security of the poor households. Though wheat and rice contribute significantly to energy intake, the time has come to increase our focus on coarse cereals and pulses to improvise adequate intake of protein. Serious deliberations are required to make this possible through the PDS, which is going to cater to a sizeable population in the near future. As elicited above, the AAY households have a greater access to PDS but the problem of undernourishment is more serious among them.As a prerequisite, it is imperative to hasten implementation of the NFSA across the country. States should be in a mission mode as availability of foodgrains may not be a problem this year. The Ministry of Agriculture has projected a record production of 270 million tonnes owing to good monsoon and an increase in acreage of foodgrains from 101 million hectares to 105 million hectares. The States must gear up to work on adequate logistics for digitisation of ration cards, computerisation of offtake and delivery of foodgrains, and effective monitoring of fair price shops, possibly through involvement of communities or other feasible ways. This will bring in greater transparency in the system and would go a long way towards raising the nutritional status of Indians.SeemaBathla is Professor and Bal Krishan Negi a Research Scholar at Centre for the Study of Regional Development, JNU, New Delhi.The Antyodaya Anna Yojana households have a greater access to PDS but the problem of undernourishment is more serious among them"

Prices for the early variety of potato that is already available in the market too have come down, from Rs 20 per kg in wholesale market to Rs 10-12 per kg.Shortage of new currency notes has hit potato farmers in Punjab, who are now struggling to sell their stock of potato seeds. At the peak of the potato sowing season, the lack of new notes in the market is preventing potential buyers from purchasing supplies.There are buyers but they do not have the new currency. We have been sending our trucks to other states, but there are no labourers to unload the stock. There is no money to pay them, said Jaswinder Singh Sangha, general secretary of the Jalandhar Potato Growers Association. Most of the traders are small businessmen and they prefer purchasing the stock with cash, he added. The potato farmers of Punjab are also the primary suppliers of potato seeds across the country.The rates of potato seeds too have crashed over the past one week, from Rs 1,800 per 50 kg to Rs 1,000- 1,200 for the same amount.Watch What Else is Making NewsPrices for the early variety of potato that is already available in the market too have come down, from Rs 20 per kg in wholesale market to Rs 10-12 per kg.After 1984 riots, which also happened in November, this is the first time we are facing such a crisis. Trucks are ready with the supplies, but transporters do not have cash to send them to other states, said Sangha.Punjab has around 560 cold storage units which dispatch about 1.1 million tonnes (mt) of potato seeds to other states, while 0.4 mt is used by potato growers within Punjab. So far not even 40 per cent of the seed stock has been sold, said farmers.The potato planting season begins in early October and lasts till November 25 across the country. In Punjab, the seeds are sown in October itself, and the first batch of the vegetable arrives in the market by mid-November. In the other states, the potato seeds are only sown in November.Punjab, which produces about 2.2 mt of potatoes a year, supplies the seeds of the vegetable to farmers in Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat etc. Punjab meets around 63 per cent of the annual potato seed demand of the country.Apart from the small amount of seeds used in Punjab in October, most of the stock has been lying in cold storage units.Said Raghbir Singh, president of the JPGA, Several traders who had come to Punjab last week to buy the potato seeds returned empty-handed. The farmers here were not willing to accept the scrapped currency notes.We do not know how to tide over this situation. The government should have had adequate stock of new currency notes. The seed supply season lasts only for three weeks. We are bound to incur heavy losses, said Satnam Singh, a potato grower.Doaba region, where potato seeds are grown on around 90,000 hectares, is considered the potato seed bowl of the country.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

The retailers also do not have enough cash to pay for what they buy from the wholesalers. The cycle is moving on the strength of credit only.

The farmers have not been paid for their paddy and cash has been sucked out of circulation. Sowing of wheat is 50 per cent of what it normally is every year, and 40 per cent of the potato crop is lying unsold.The demonetisation of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 came bang in the middle of the potato season, mid-October to end-November. Some five lakh quintals of potatoes and potato seeds are supplied from Punjab to other states. But due to the sudden demonetisation of high-value currency, almost 40 per cent of the crop has been frozen in cold storage, explains Jang Bahadur Singh, secretary-general of the Confederation of Potato Seed Farmers of Punjab.And of the 60 per cent thats been dispatched, to states like UP, Bihar, West Bengal, Karnataka, Assam and Gujarat, a third of it is lying unsold in those states. As for the two-thirds that has reached the local markets, agents are saying they cant pay until they see some cash.Money rotation has stopped and we are unable to pay for labour here, says Jang Bahadur Singh. It has also become difficult for farmers to buy seeds and fertilisers.Omkar Singh, a farmer who has 18 acres in Gurdaspur, is as broke as his farmhands. I have a credit limit of Rs 10 lakh crop with my agriculture society, but I cannot clear my debts as I have no money. I have not been paid by the government agencies that procured my paddy. All money flow has stopped, he says.Omkar Singh went to pay off his debt with the little cash he had. But they refused to take his old notes. Now I am stuck. I cannot buy seed for the wheat crop, fertilisers, pesticides. My sowing has been delayed, adds Omkar Singh.Farmer Avtar Singh of Gurdaspur describes the full circle of his frustration: I have exhausted my crop credit limit and have to pay it back. My bank wont give me my money. The procurement agencies have not paid me for my paddy. And the credit society charges me 11.5 per cent interest on my loan while I stand in queue. I cant buy fertilisers, seeds or pesticides for the wheat crop. What should I do? ''Another Gurdaspur farmer, Manjit Singh, says he has sown just two acres of his ten. It took him four days to purchase wheat seed from the market. Dealers werent accepting old currency. And half of November is gone, he says.Balbir Singh Rajewal, president of Bhartiya Kisan Union, Punjab, says farmers have been the worst hit. In the districts of Fazilka, Ferozepur, Amritsar, Gurdaspur and Sangrur, sowing of wheat is less than 50 per cent and a little better in Patiala, Ludhiana, Jalandhar.However, Punjabs director of agriculture, J S Bains, says the sowing figures are not as bad as they are being bandied about. Yes sowing has been affected. Normally, 95 per cent sowing is done by November 15. This year, 70 per cent sowing has been done till date. Out of 17 lakh quintals of seeds required for the crop, some 12 lakh quintals have already been purchased by famers, he says.Not just farmers, Punjabs traders have taken a hit too.

We want to act as a pressure group for getting the concerns answered, Digmohan Negi, one of the founders of Uttarakhand Ekta Manch Delhi, told HT over phone from Delhi.He said the states languages Garhwali and Kumaoni are still considered dialects and demanded their inclusion in the Eighth Schedule of the Constitution.Gairsain (which is almost equidistant from Garhwal and Kumaon regions of the state) is yet to be made the states capital, Negi rued.Read: Why Gairsain capital issue a political hot potato in election-bound UttarakhandUttarakhand chief minister Harish Rawat addressed the gathering over phone and assured action on the demands.Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia assured assistance for celebration of hill festival Uttaraini-Makraini at 40 places and setting up of an Uttarakhand Akademi in the national capital, where thousands of Uttarakhandis are residing.Noted Uttarakhandi singer Narendra Singh Negi recited a song specially written for the gathering through which he exhorted locals to join hands for the cause of the hills.

We will try to develop model facilities like health and education so as to curb migration, Negi said."

The community, which has remained loyal to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) over the years, has suffered close to 100 per cent fall in business. The office-bearers of at least three merchant associations in and around Burra Bazar said the BJP will pay dearly for demonetisation.There was hardly any customer in the first week. Business dropped by 100 per cent, said general secretary of the Posta Bazar Merchants Association, Biswanath Agarwal.The Posta Bazaar takes up the largest space in Burra Bazar  spread over almost two square kilometres  and hosts traders in pulses, sugar, oil, flour and lime. Mr. Agarwal said semi-wholesalers and retailers have started coming returning but the rise is only by about 20 per cent in the last two days.But Burra Bazars total turnover is much above 100 crore daily. The majority of the transaction is not in black but in cash. Thousands of crores has been lost in the last few days, said Mr. Agarwal.Not so hot potatoesThe president of the Posta Bazar Potato Merchants Association, Gurupada Sinha, who controls a substantial part of the business, said he would not be surprised if farmers commit suicide at the time of payment.Mr. Sinha, whose family has been in the trade for four generations, said the potato sowing season has started only about two weeks ago in Bengal.The seed and the raw material for cultivation arrive from Punjab and are sold in cash. But the farmer has no new cash and thus he would borrow from lenders and fail to repay it, he pointed out. The biggest panic is if the entire old currency, which is not necessarily black, will be rejected now as the exchange amount is getting reduced."

The same resonated at this years CII Agro Tech 2016 where latest technologies were displayed and launched in a bid to boost the agriculture sector in the country.The young farmers invested in technological innovations, seeking solace from the mundane agricultural processes at the fest. Succha Dyal, a farmer from Gurdaspur said, CII Agro Tech 2016 provides a platform for farmers to pick and choose from a wide array of farm equipment related to the health of the soil, choice of crops to be grown and dairy farm management in the advent of latest technology.He added, I am happy to have invested in the National Pneumatic Planter Machine, which will help in yielding my crop productivity.Gurpreet Singh, representing National Agro Industries, which launched various new machines at the exposition said, Considering the extent of seed wastage in India, we have come up with the National Pneumatic Planter Machine that guarantees optimum seed to soil contact which ensures proper germination thereby, saving scarce and costly labour. This will definitely help in enhancing the profit levels of the rural farmers.Syncing with the thoughts, Tripta Devi, daughter of a small potato farmer from Fazlika district of Punjab said, Till a few years ago, the loss of crop production peaked up to 50 per cent, landing us into the viscous circle of debt trap. But now, the interface of government has helped us rise above the conventional crop cycle and diversify into other profitable crops. We dont have to suffer from crop ripening and wastage, owing to the farm to fork cold chain. This has really helped us save more and enjoy some luxuries of life which we couldnt afford earlier.The fest also hosted several self-help groups (SHGs) that specializes in homemade products. Trained by Punjab Agricultural University (PAU), Ludhiana, the farmers behind these groups are pioneers in producing the items apart from packaging and labeling them and finally connecting them directly with consumer in the market.More than 60 products made by farmers were on display at the CII Agro Tech 2016 such as the honey and pickle from the Gurdev Kaur Deols stall from the Ayali Khurd village in Ludhiana and turmeric and the Aleo Vera Gel from KKNS products of India of Burj village in Fatehgarh Sahib.I learnt of the help that the PAU offers in direct marking in 2011 and have since learnt the importance of marketing. It is really a great concept and I want to learn even more as there is no limit to what one can apply and earn, says Nirmal Singh (35) of the KKNS Group, who has a stall at the States Pavilion. The group has a turnover of around Rs 1 crore and sells 11 kinds of pickles, herbal tea and turmeric.56-year old Gurdev Kaur Deol from Ludhiana said, People are now aware of our products and we now have orders from Delhi and even the Southern India."

The sluggish acreage is going to affect production of the early variety (jaldi aloo) that usually reaches the market by mid-November.But this was not expected when Bengal farmers, the second tuber producing state after Uttar Pradesh , had made huge profits in the last season. ""The November chill is ideal for potato farming. But where is the money?"" said potato grower Kinkar Das from Tarakeswar. Kinkar hasn't been able to sow potato seeds entirely in his 2.5 bigha land. ""I sowed in only 1.5 bigha, leaving the remaining for less expensive farming such as brinjals and radish,"" Das said.Gopinath Khanrui from Singur has major stakes this year. Unable to get credit from the Krishi Samabay Samiti, Gopinath has arranged for Rs 60,000 by mortgaging his wife's gold jewellery and the rest as loan from seed and fertiliser agents. A small section without having bankable assets has taken loans from big farmers and money lenders at 10-12% monthly interest, a trend that is a cause of worry for the administration. State officials fear that such high stakes may increase the possibility of farmer suicides.Seed and fertiliser agents have no other option to give the items on credit. ""If we don't, our business is going to suffer. What's the use of having unused stocks when seeds have a limited shelf life. We are thus giving the items to farmers based on a written undertaking that they will pay back during the harvesting season,"" said trader Pradyut Das. Even seed and fertiliser prices have recorded a dip due to the liquidity crunch. The Punjab Potato Seed Federation has already approached Bengal agents with a request to collect the money from farmers in old currency notes. West Bengal Potato Seed Trader Association secretary Swapan Samanta who is also the Tarakeswar Municipality chairman, however, isn't taking chances. ""I have intimated the state government about the proposal and am waiting for the response. I came to know that the Punjab government has endorsed the move.

Normally, potatoes here sell like hot cakes.There is hardly any wholesaler or agro commodity trading house to buy potatoes in this area. Most of the farmers have been forced to sell the produce at rates almost less than the actual cost of production, Najaib Gill, a prominent potato grower on the outskirts of Una town, told IANS.He said this is the season when potatoes grown in low hills of the State, mainly in Una district, command monopoly in the markets of north Indian states of Punjab, Chandigarh, Haryana and Delhi.He said there is a huge demand for the potatoes in the plains.Since the production (in the hills) is optimal and the demand is high in the plains, we are not getting adequate prices as the traders say they have no cash in new currency notes, he added.Potato is one of the major cash crops grown in the lower and mid-hills of the State. Una district alone harvests potatoes on 700 hectares.The States potato yield was around 200,000 tonnes in 2015-16, while estimates this fiscal put the produce at 195,000 tonnes, according to the Himachal Pradesh Economic Survey for 2015-16.Besides Una district, the table potato is also cultivated in Bilaspur, Kangra, Mandi, Shimla, Solan and Kullu districts.The Lahaul Valley in Lahaul-Spiti district is known for producing virus-free potatoes that mainly find a market for plantation.Sarvjit Singh Dogra, state Agricultural Produce Market Committee Secretary in Una town, told IANS that a 50-kg bag of potatoes is fetching between Rs 400 and Rs 425 in Una, while it sold for around Rs 800 last year.Currently, potatoes are being retailed at Rs 30-35 per kg across the country.Growers are facing many hardships. Many are being forced to accept old currency notes.For more than a week there was no bulk buyer for potato. Finally, we have decided to sell the entire produce at almost half the rates by accepting old currency notes of Rs 1,000 denomination, said a farmer, requesting anonymity.He said if the government could allow use of old high denomination notes for purchasing seeds, it should also be liberal with the growers for accepting the banned notes for their produce till the new currency is in full circulation.Field reports say most of the farmers have delayed the harvesting of the potatoes till the prices spike again.Last week, Chief Minister Virbhadra Singh expressed concern over lack of enthusiasm among the traders during centuries-old Lavi Fair, synonymous with trade in traditional items like hand-knitted woollens, farm implements and dry fruits as well as horses, yaks, sheep, at Rampur town, some 130 km from the state capital.The fair too was hit hard by the demonetisation decision.Its unfortunate that this year the trade fair was hit by the demonetisation of currency notes. People showed less enthusiasm during the fair as compared to previous years due the Centres decision, the Chief Minister said at the fairs closing ceremony.Himachal Pradesh annually earns Rs 2,500 crore from the cultivation of vegetables, while horticulture generates more than Rs 3,200 crore annually.-IANS"

They said that the supply of fruits and vegetables to the wholesale market is gradually decreasing.Rajesh Yadav, the secretary of agriculture produce marketing committee, said, The prices of vegetables have dipped a bit while those of fruits have remained stable. However, the sale of fruits has dipped as consumers are mostly buying only vegetables, for daily consumption. The arrival of apples from Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) and Himachal Pradesh dipped considerably after November 8.As per official data, 1,774 truckloads of fruits and vegetables arrived in the first eight days of November, at an average of around 222 loads per day. However, the number of truckloads that arrived from November 9 to November 21 was 2,659, down to an average of 205 loads per day.Officials said that most transactions in the market took place in cash, but now, the traders are depending on the supply of stock on credit as well.As of now, I have nearly Rs1 crore in rotation on account of supplying on credit. Not even a single person came to remit cash on Tuesday. Whenever I approach them, they say they dont have enough cash. The sale of fruits is down by 70%-80% and we have also stopped asking for the supply of apple from J&K. The sale of apple, grapes and oranges has been considerably affected, Raees Ahmad, owner of Sangam Fruits at the market, said.Munim Zafar of Madina Fruit Company said, We used to procure nearly 500kg-700kg of kinu (kinnow fruit) from Punjab. Now, the procurement is around 200kg per day. Consumers dont have much cash-in-hand to buy from here. Generally, we used to order two-three truckloads (of fruits) per day, but we ordered just one truckload in the last three days.Wholesalers said that farmers are also losing money due to dip in sales as they have to pay for parking the truck in the market for additional days.To move our stock, we are selling potato at Rs12-15 per kg against the rate of Rs30 per kg prior to the demonetisation move. Similarly, we are selling cauliflower at Rs2 per kg against Rs20 per kg earlier. Tomato prices have also reduced from Rs20 per kg to Rs8 per kg. This has also led consumers to purchase basic vegetables to meet daily food demand, Haji Sajjad, a wholesaler, said.According to official figures, the market received around 168 quintals (1 quintal = 100kg) of apples per day in the first week of November. The supply dipped to an average of 93 quintals per day from November 9 to November 22. The supply of oranges also dipped from an average of 453 quintals per day to an average of 306 quintals per day, after November 8.However, the supply of guava has remained constant, at 220 quintals per day, from November 1 to November 22."

Wheat is now retailing in Delhi at Rs 24 per kg, up from Rs 19 at this time last year. This, even as stocks in government warehouses have depleted to a 9-year-low. Retail prices of milled chana dal and potato are, likewise, averaging Rs 140 and Rs 20 per kg, respectively, as against their corresponding levels of Rs 70 and Rs 12 a year ago. Consumers are paying about Rs 15/kg for onions  half of what they were last year at this point  but low plantings this rabi season can be a source of worry over the next 4-5 months.WATCH VIDEO: Petrol Pumps, Air Ticket Counters Will Not Accept Old Rs 500 Notes After December 2Thankfully, data from the agriculture ministry shows area sown under both wheat and chana so far in the ongoing rabi season to be higher than the progressive coverage during the same period last year. Available indications are that there will be no shortfall in planted acreages for three reasons. The first is the improved soil and sub-soil moisture levels. Second, high prices are themselves an incentive for farmers to plant. In the case of wheat, the Rs 100 increase in MSP to Rs 1,625 per quintal is an added motivation. Third, both wheat and chana are non-hybrid crops, whose grain saved from the previous years crop can be used as seed for the current season. Most farmers would, therefore, not be buying seed. Lack of cash shouldnt in any case be a deterrent for sowing.Cash can, however, be an issue when it comes to purchase of other inputs like fertiliser, pesticide and labour. Farmers need to give three 50-kg bags of urea and one bag of di-ammonium phosphate for every acre of wheat. In potato, the requirement is even more: 3 bags urea and 1.5 bags each of DAP and muriate of potash. The cost of these works out to Rs 2,000-3,300 per acre. While there is no dearth of availability of fertilisers, whether farmers have the cash to purchase these isnt clear. Also, the application has to be timely  farmers, for instance, need to give one bag of urea per acre 20-25 days after sowing. With cooperative banks not being allowed to accept the old notes, there is also a question mark on availability of sufficient credit for farmers in the current rabi season.Farmers also need cash to pay labour, whose requirement is particularly high in onions and potatoes. In potato, the sowing operations were completed in Punjab by end-September, and by end-October in Uttar Pradesh. Right now, planting operations are taking place mainly in West Bengal and Bihar, and there are reports of farmers struggling to raise cash to pay labour.The next few months will decide the fate of these four crops and also sugar, where, too, supply situation is tight though that precedes monetisation. Preventing a flare-up in prices before Assembly elections in UP and Punjab would pose a huge challenge to the government at the Centre.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

Potato growers say there are no buyers and that they are yet to receive full payments even for the stocks they have already supplied to other states before and after the demonetisation.Also, they say, the government announcement allowing farmers to purchase seed with old currency notes came quite late when the potato sowing season in other states was almost about to end.In Punjab, potato planting season is from September-end till early October while in other states, it is between October 25 and November 25.In every cold store, around 10,000 to 12,000 bags of 50 kg each have been lying. Now, we do not know where to go and what to do, said Jaswinder Singh Sangha, general secretary of the Jalandhar Potato Growers Association. I have got 22,000 packets of government certified seed in my own cold store but there is no taker.Sangha said Punjab farmers were selling potato seeds at Rs 30-35/kg to the traders from other states before the announcement of the demonetisation on November 8, but after that, buyers simply vanished.The government has put us in a big trouble and it should compensate us now, said Sangha.Now we are planning to throw this potato seed either on roads or to distribute it to the poor as there is no taker. We cannot afford to keep these in cold stores where we have to pay rent and also for next crop which will start coming in February we have to empty our stores, said Raghbir Singh, the president of JPGA.Meanwhile, the rate of table potato has been hovering between Rs 800 and 1000 per quintal in wholesale market.Punjabs potato farmers are the main seed supplier of the crop across the country. The state produces about 2.2 metric tonnes, out of which 1.5 MT comprises seed potatoes only. Currently, Punjab supplies about 1.1 MT of potato seed to other states like Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and other potato producing state and meets around 63 per cent of the seed demand of the country every year.Doaba region, where potato seed is grown on 90,000 hectares of area, is the home of potato seed for the entire country. Jalandhar too has big potato producers.The sowing takes place in early-October and harvesting towards February-March, after which the produce is put in cold stores. Yields of seed potatoes, at 8-10 tonnes per acre, are below the 12-14 tonnes for normal table potatoes. But while the latter sell at Rs 1,000-1,200 per quintal, seed potatoes fetch rates that range from Rs 2,500-3,500 for branded and Rs 1,800-2,000 for unbranded material.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

Most transactions are being done on credit, so my ability to buy inputs has become limited. I have to buy whatever traders offer me on credit.Patience is running out. If this [the cash crunch] is not sorted out soon, the government will face the wrath of farmers, he said.The data from the Agriculture Ministry show that till December 2 this year, the total area under the rabi crops stands at 415.53 lakh hectares, against 382.84 lakh hectare this time in 2015. While wheat has been sown on 173.93 lakh hectares, against 152.56 lakh hectares last year, the area under pulses has risen to 112.95 lakh hectares from 99.83 lakh hectares last year. The area under oilseeds has risen to 70.7 lakh hectares from 64.21 lakh hectares.Satnam Singh of Beru village in Patiala expressed the same concern. Wheat sowing should ideally be done between mid- November and the last week of the month. But sowing on my land has been delayed by a week. This means the quality of my crop could take a hit, resulting in a lower yield.Many other farmers of my village have been spending long hours in queues in front of banks and ATMs  the crucial time we should spend on our fields, he added.Union Agriculture Minister Radha Mohan Singh has recently said demonetisation has not impacted the Rabi crop sowing, citing the increase in the area under wheat and pulses, the main crops.Noted agricultural policy analyst Devinder Sharma said: If farmers and the people continue to face difficulties caused by demonetisation, the government will face the consequences.

Suffering from back-to-back drought for two years, demonetisation has struck a severe blow.I am sure it will be sometimes before a clearer picture emerges. But all efforts to paint a bright picture for agriculture are now beginning to fall apart. While the serpentine queues in the urban areas show no signs of ending even after a month of demonetisation, the picture in the rural areas remains too bleak. With the bank branches not getting adequate cash, I know of villages where the farmers had to return empty handed even after seven days of queuing up.What makes it worse is the fact, as Prof Ram Kumar of Tata Institute of Social Studies points out, that nearly 81 per cent of the villages do not have access to bank branches.Despite the Ministry of Agricultures claim of a higher sowing of rabi crops as compared with the area sown in previous year, reality checks portray a different picture. The area under wheat sowing was being deliberately compared with the sowings accomplished in 2015, the year of drought. When you compare 17.4 million hectares of wheat sowing achieved by December 4, with the corresponding figures of 21.3 and 20.9 mn hectares in 2013 and 2014 respectively, it reveals the shortfall.While much had been written about the difficulties encountered by the farmers in undertaking sowing operations, they faced severe blow when the market crashed post demonetisation. Even a month after, the mandis in several cities are partially operating.With the demand subdued, prices have fallen across the board Only a day ago, farmers in Paththal town in Chhattisgarh dumped tomatoes on the national highway to express their discontent at the decrease in prices. With trucks failing to arrive this year, the rich tomato pocket of Chhattisgarh saw prices lowering to 50 paise per kg. Again, a few days back, farmers distributed potatoes free-of-cost outside the Vidhan Sabha in Lucknow.Vegetable and fruit growers have been hit the hardest with prices slumping to as low as 45-50 per cent. Cauliflower in Bihar and tomato in Andhra Pradesh were selling at `1 per kg; nearly three lakh tonnes of potato seed in cold storages in Punjab found no buyer; dairy farmers found themselves at the receiving end on failing to buy fodder for cattle. Many such reports have been pouring in from across India. With no government succor, arhtiyas (money lenders) came to farmers rescue at many places, especially after the cooperative banks or societies became non-functional.Considering that 2016-17 witnessed a normal monsoon except in Karnataka and parts of Telengana, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, I was expecting some kind of revival in the farm economy.Knowing that the farmers are not being paid a remunerative price for years, they have to depend on the rain gods to bail them out of dire situation. And this year, the rain gods didnt disappoint. However, the demonetisation move proved to be a big blow for the farmers, the impact of which would be felt by them for quite long.hunger55@gmail.com"

If we don't have money, how can we pay our labourers, farmer, and transporter? said Metharam Kriplani, president of Chamber of Azadpur Fruit and Vegetable Traders.Some market players said tax authorities have raided big traders in Azadpur, a major regional hub. Others said sellers were reluctantly accepting Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes from large buyers.For how long can you run a business in debt? Even paying half amount to farmers for their sale of produce is not solving the problem as it is leading to poor supplies and lowering the purchasing power of traders. The market will crash, said Mukesh Tiwari, past chairman of Ghazipur mandi. The solution is to install card machines, said Balkrishan Sharma, who buys vegetables worth Rs 1-2 lakh a day for 50-100 vegetable vendors.Kriplani, an apple trader, said prices have fallen in the past four days from Rs 30 to Rs 20 a kg. Its a big loss for farmers. Further, the business is down by 30%-40%.Agricultural markets look deserted and offer ample parking space and very few trucks. Onion trader Abid Ali of Abdul Alin and Company said the number of trucks from Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Karnataka, where the harvest was going on, has fallen. With lack of buyers  small street vendors, shopkeepers and aggregators for hotels and restaurants  the sale has crashed. Onion price in mandis is in the range of Rs 5-Rs 10 a kg, while in retail, it is selling at Rs 30/kg.Tuntun Bhagat, who retails vegetables in east Delhi, said. The first two days, I gave credit to regular customers, but since I didnt have the money, I couldnt get supplies. On Saturday, I stood in line for five hours and today I have been able to comake a purchase.With potato harvest season beginning in Punjab and Himachal, farmers and aggregators like Bilal from Una are not happy. We are not getting good rates. Then there is fight over notes.Surjit Mandal had brought banana and colocasia plant (arbi) from Meerut to the Ghazipur mandi. I took a Rs 4,000 loan to come here expecting to earn Rs 8,000-Rs 9,000. But therere no buyers, he said.Farmers are delaying payments to labourers who cut the produce, gunny bag sellers, transporters and mandi workers. Those who trust me are giving me their service. I am also trusting the babu who said he will pay me half for my produce and rest after a month, said Iqbal from Shamli.The babu Iqbal was referring to is Mukesh Dhingra, a trader in Ghazipur, who has a huge pile of cauliflower and hardly any buyer.

Rai, a former zilla parishad member, wields considerable influence in the area due to his close ties with the RJD chief, said sources.The IMFL cartons were kept hidden under soil and grass loaded in the truck. An employee of the brick kiln has been arrested and two cars and a bike have been seized, said Subodh Kumar Mishra, SHO of Sadar police station in Hajipur, the headquarters town of Vaishali district.While both the ruling JD(U) and RJD declined to comment on this seizure a day after Chief Minister Nitish Kumar addressed a workshop of JD(U) on prohibition, the Opposition BJP targeted the alliance government. The CM said at this workshop that prohibition enforced by his government in the state has been a historic success. Such seizures show the secret of this success. In the name of prohibition, leaders of the ruling parties and police officials are making a fast buck, said senior BJP leader Sanjay Tiger.In the past three days, police and excise department officials seized huge quantities of liquor smuggled into Bihar in potato-laden trucks. In one of these seizures in Chapra, 250 cartons of IMFL were seized from a truck that reached a potato godown in the town. The liquor cartons were kept under sacks of potato. Police sources said the liquor was brought from Punjab.CM Nitish Kumar recently asked police and excise department officials to crack down on liquor smugglers and ensure that liquor does not enter into Bihar from other states."

Liquidity crunch and fresh supply of potato from Uttar Pradesh and Punjab have changed the game altogether. The wholesale price of Jyoti variety of potato crashed to Rs 2-3 per kg at markets closed to cold storages across Bengal. However, the crash has a little impact on the retail markets in the city.This year saw the least potato production  9 million tonne  in Bengal compared to earlier years. So, many farmers and middlemen calculated a good price if they managed to hoard a substantial amount of potato. A section of farmers, middlemen and cold-storage owners fudged this year's actual storage to jack up the price. So, when the actual storage was 6.5 million tonnes across 462 potato cold storages in Bengal, it was shown only 3 million tonne. This led to abnormal rise of potato price in both wholesale and retail markets.Potato economy of Bengal is always erratic. It is one of the most risky farming bets. With a contribution of 25% in India's potato output, Bengal is the second-largest producer of the vegetable after UP. ""A section of middlemen and traders speculate the probable price of potato every year, keeping in mind the production of potato and its price in previous years. But things often go haywire when ground reality changes,"" said Shankar Adhikari , an agriculture economist.November 30 was the last date for clearing entire stock. But government found a huge stockpile of potato in the cold storages. Agriculture marketing minister Tapan Dasgupta extended the last date of clearing the stock till December 8. But even after that the government found a huge stock uncleared. Now that section of farmers and middlemen find it difficult to withdraw the stock from cold storages as the cost overshoots the wholesale price.Paschimbanga Potato Traders Association president Swapan Samanta said: ""Liquidity crunch along with fresh supply of low-cost potato from Punjab has changed the game. Bengal potato now has hardly any buyer. The potato retail price now should be below Rs 8 in Kolkata's retail markets."" Traders are jostling to sell before the new crop arrives in December end, failing which the old one must be destroyed."

On an average, the cost of production for potato is Rs. 7 to Rs. 8 per kg, but the farmer is getting way below it, Jaswinder Singh Sangha, general secretary, Jalandhar Potato Growers Association, told The Hindu .Same time last year, farmers were getting around Rs. 600 per 50 kg, he said.The new season potato crop from the Kandi belt, including Hoshiarpur and neighbouring districts of Punjab and also Una district in Himachal Pradesh, has started arriving in the markets but farmers are finding it difficult to sell their crop in the absence of buyers.Since demonetisation, traders are facing cash crunch, resulting in a drop in bulk orders from big markets like Delhi. In local markets there are a fewer buyers and hence farmers are getting a far lower price, Mr. Sangha said, adding that the potato grower had earlier suffered losses due to drop in sale of seeds and now again when the fresh crop has reached the market.Potato growers from Punjab on Wednesday wrote a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, asking him to waive off their crop loans.Clash with peak seasonWhile we appreciate the governments [demonetisation] move, we have suffered huge losses. Potato seed farming business accounts for nearly Rs. 1,500 crore annually, but this year we are estimating a loss to the tune of Rs. 800-900 crore, he said, adding that demonetisation had clashed with the peak season of potato seed when it is supplied nationwide.Notably, Punjab produces quality potato seed, which is distributed across the country, including in West Bengal, Gujarat, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Odisha. Potato seed is supplied from the first week of November to mid-December every year. In neighbouring Haryana, the situation is no different as farmers are forced to sell potato at a dismal price on account of poor demand."

Prices are down but I dont have any other option than selling. If I delay, the quality of the potato will deteriorate. I have to sow wheat after potato harvest, hence, Im forced to sell my crop at a poor price, though it means a heavy loss, said Jaswinder Singh, a Jalandhar potato farmer.In Haryana too, farmers are selling seasonal vegetables at throw away prices. In the Shahbad market, potato fetched Rs. 2.75 a kg, while cauliflower went for Rs. 2 a kg. I sold my potato for Rs. 2.75 a kilogram.As the prices have dropped, farmers in my village have started feeding their potatoes to their cattle to avoid buying feed, said Rakesh Bains, a farmer from Kurukshetra, who planted potato on 24 acres.Farmers have been unable to recover cost of productionas the priceshave plummeted"
