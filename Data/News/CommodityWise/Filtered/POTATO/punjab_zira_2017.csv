Some have even approached us to supply maize in bulk.""Bangarmau has half a dozen big flour and maize mills, a dozen rice mills, large cold storage for potatoes and numerous mandis for green vegetables and fruit. The launch of the expressway in November facilitated farmers, mill and mandi owners significantly as they are able to transport their produce to man dis of Gorakhpur, Delhi and Lucknow in almost half the time it used to take earlier.Mandi owner Jameel Ahmad said, ""Once the eway is opened for trucks, we would be able to supply potatoes and muskmelon in bulk to Lucknow in less than two hours. Even supply to Mahewa mandi of Gorakhpur, which took six hours, will now take only four hours.""Shopkeepers said the expressway can help them reach more markets in Delhi, Haryana and Punjab as now they are directly connected to Agra. Maize mill owner Sanjeev Kumar said, ""Earlier, the trucks took two days to reach Delhi as they had to halt at Agra after travelling from Bangarmau for one full night.They reached Delhi after another night's journey but now they will reach in only a day as they will join the Yamuna Expressway from Agra. Freight charges have reduced to almost half to benefit entrepreneurs as well as farmers.""The e-way has also solved the problem of transporting perishable commodities on time as trucks carrying fruit and vegetables to mandis of other cities will reach in almost half the time. Singh added that UP government has proposed many cold storage for potatoes along the e-way like in Kannauj and Safipur. This will help farmers sell potatoes at profitable rates and prevent rotting.There is a big demand in Delhi and Haryana."""

""The recent example before us is the heavy losses suffered by farmers of potato and pea crops due to demonetisation,"" said Virsa Singh , who owns seven acres, while addressing a gathering at Bachiwind village on Saturday.The farmers are of the view that if there was an MSP for potatoes and peas, they would have not suffered any losses since the government was bound to purchase their produce at a fixed rate, but the situation was other way round. ""Peas were sold for Rs 15-20 per kg last year, but now they are sold for Rs 4-6 a kilo. Many farmers ploughed the crop in fields only,"" said BASC general secretary Rattan Singh Randhawa.Anup Singh, a farmer who had lost wheat and basmati crop due to bad weather, said elections were the only time when people gave a patient hearing to them. ""I am telling everyone that I will vote only if a party will fix the MSP of fruits and vegetables, and implement recommendations of Swaminathan Commission ,"" he said.A farmer who had just returned from a rally by the Congress, Gurveer Singh, said that on the night of January 20, he led a delegation of farmers to meet the assembly candidates of the Congress, SAD and AAP and talked to them about their issues. ""I am really confused; everyone of them promised to accept our demands if voted to power, but I don't know who to believe,"" he said."
58ff1c877be9e041361628f2,"Thanks to note ban, farm sector may not see 'acche din'",http://www.deccanherald.com/content/594489/thanks-note-ban-farm-sector.html,2017-02-02,"Sagar Kulkarni, Feb 3, 2017, DHNS 8:48 ISTDateline: New DelhiDays after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced scrapping of high value currency notes, Agriculture Ministry officials were eagerly awaiting the details about sowing for rabi crops across the country. The government was facing all round criticism for having announced the note ban at a time when the agriculture sector was witnessing an upswing on the back of a better monsoon after two consecutive drought years.The sudden withdrawal of legal tender of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 currency notes had left the farmers devoid of any cash to buy seeds or fertilisers. But as the figures trickled in, there was a sense of cheer as the sowing operations appeared unaffected.Up to November 11, rabi sowing was completed on 14.6 million hectare area  5.7% lower than normal crop coverage and the gap declined steadily. During the week ending January 20, 2017 sown area under rabi crops was 628.34 lakh hectares, which was 6.07% more than last year's acreage of 592.36 lakh hectares.Agriculture Minister Radhamohan Singh has been issuing statements on how demonetisation had not affected rabi sowing to counter the campaign by opposition leaders on note-ban leading to agrarian distress.Experts have been sceptical about the government's gung-ho approach vis-a-vis the rabi sowing numbers, particularly the comparison with the previous year's acreage which was low because of severe drought. Though the government speaks glowingly about demonetisation not affecting farm activity, the numbers tell a different story. According to the data released by the Agriculture Ministry, rabi sowing in 2013-14 had touched 670 lakh hectares and leading to a bumper harvest of 263 million tonnes.Economist Pronab Sen was categorical. Rabi sowing looks big on the small base of last year, he said. Sen, India's first chief statistician, also said the government could have pushed for implementation of demonetisation in January this year as the seven-week gap would have helped farmers make purchases of seeds and fertilisers for sowing of the winter crop.According to Sen, delaying note ban by a few weeks would have helped farmers sell their kharif crop, prices of which had already fallen drastically on account of good harvest. The wholesale markets, which usually deal in cash, had a tough time lifting the farm produce and the maximum impact was felt by those dealing in fruits and vegetables.Farmers in Punjab and Uttar Pradesh dumped their potato crop on the roads in Ambala and Lucknow, respectively, as they had no cash to pay for transportation of the farm produce to wholesale markets. In Gujarat's Surat, farmers threw vegetables and milk on the streets as they had no access to cash after the government kept out the district central cooperative banks out of the demonetisation process.Prices of fruits and vegetables dropped in wholesale markets post-demonetisation as did the market arrivals. Prices of banana, apple, tomato, cabbage were lower in the range of 4% to 9% in November when compared with the rates in October, making it clear that farmers were affected to some extent.Government analysts say that the prices of tomatoes crashed in December because of glut in the market due to bumper crop. But they admit that it would be difficult to ascertain how much fall was because of the glut and how much due to disruption due to demonetisation.Cash crunch in rural areas had turned acute as the cooperative banks as well as primary cooperative credit societies too were kept out of cash exchange affecting purchase of quality seeds and fertilisers by farmers.There were reports about slowdown in farm activity such as timely spraying of pesticides or application of fertiliser for want of labour. Many farmers were unable to make cash payments to farm labourers who were forced to return to their home towns. Cotton trade nosedived as mills were unable to make cash payments to farmers who supply bales.Quiet acceptanceThere is quiet acceptance of this fact within the government circles as productivity may take a hit this year. Also, farmers have bought far less amount of fertilisers this rabi season when compared with the previous two drought years. One set of estimates peg the sale of fertilisers to be nearly 7.5% lower than the previous year.This means that despite high acreage achieved during the sowing phase may not reflect in the farm output this rabi season. According to a study by Ramesh Chand, Member, Niti Aayog, a 1% increase/decrease in fertiliser use result in 0.1% increase/decrease in agriculture GDP and about 0.14% increase/decrease in crop output.If the current trend in the shortfall in fertiliser consumption continued till the end of the rabi season, it could lead to a more than 1% decline in production. As a result, the rate of growth in farmers income is also expected to dip due to the drop, though Chand still pegs it at 5.8% in real terms for 2016-17.Indias farm sector was looking set for some good times after two consecutive drought years that had slowed down growth and even witnessed a contraction of 0.2% in 2014-15. The normal monsoon had cheered the farmers who had reaped a better kharif harvest and were keen to follow up with even better returns in the winter crop cycle.Ratings agencies had forecast 4% growth for 2016-17 over the previous year which was certainly brighter given the meagre growth in the past couple of years. The sector had barely witnessed growth since 2011. In 2012-13, the farm sector grew by 1.5%, followed by 4.2% in 2013-14, -0.2% in 2014-15 and 1.2% in 2015-16. At a time when things were looking up, the demonetisation decision has pushed the long desired achhe din for agriculture in the realm of uncertainty."

Growers are saying that post-demonetisation, there has been no rise in price and buyers dwindled, too. Even a couple of years back, potatoes used to be sold at Rs 3,000-4,000 per quintal.Watch What Else is Making NewsSo, growers are demanding government help to export potatoes and get a good price. Punjab is expecting a production of over 2.2 million tonnes whereas it has the capacity to store around 16 lakh tonnes in the nearly 500 cold stores. But the old crop, lying in the cold stores, needs to be cleared first.Middle-East and Russia always prefer our potatoes. But farmers alone cannot do anything as government support is required post-demonetisation, said Jalandhar Potato Growers Association (JPGA) general secretary JS Sangha.Small farmers said they cannot even afford to keep potatoes in cold storage which costs more than the price of the crop.At mandis, we are forced to sell potatoes for Rs 3 per kilo while in the retail market, it is Rs 9-10 per kg, said Jagtar Singh, another farmer, from Jandhusinga village.Sangha said keeping potatoes in cold stores is a burden on big farmers, too, as the rate of the crop is less than the cost of keeping it in cold stores.Demonetisation was announced during the sowing season and several traders left without buying the seed which is the best in the country, said Sangha, adding, A large amount of our potato seeds went to waste as buyers from other states had no money.There is a huge demand for potatoes in Russia and Middle-East but farmers alone cannot do anything, said JPGA president Raghbir Singh.We have exported potatoes at Rs 900-1,000 per ql to Russia a couple of years ago on our own. Now, if the government helps us to sell potatoes in Russia and Middle-East, then government and potato growers can earn four times more than at present, said Sangha. By sea, it takes three-four weeks to send potatoes to Russia and the government should arrange for export via Pakistan as it will reach there much early, but no heed is being paid to that, he added.For all the latest Cities News, download Indian Express App"

We grow 50 million tonnes of potato; 30 years ago, we grew five million tonnes. How did this sudden potato revolution take place? It was because of a method developed for sweet potato production during what we call aphid-free-season.

Punjab produces good quality potato seeds which are sold across the country.""No traders is coming to purchase the fresh crop and prices have nosedived in local mandis. In November, when potato seeds were to be supplied, demonetisation came. Farmers from West Bengal, which was the main market to be catered at the time, had no cash and the growers and suppliers here refused to sell on credit. Even according to conservative estimates, over four lakh bags (50kg per bag) were left in the stores in Punjab,"" said Inderdeep Singh Grewal, a major potato grower from Saraba village near Ludhiana. ""I too suffered big loss in November despite owning a cold storage,"" he added.""In November, several small growers had already sold most part of their produce and the middle and big producers were badly hit. However, this time, it's theses small growers who are worst hit as they sell their produce directly in the local mandis and don't have financial capacity to store,"" said Jaswinder Singh Sangha, secretary of Jalandhar Potato Growers Association.""Most of the trading of potato crops is done in cash. Now traders are wary of making all transactions through banks,"" Sangha said.

""We are considering to launch some protest or agitation to expose that how demonetisation has hit the farmers,"" he added.Grewal pointed out that the last two - three seasons were good for potato and the area under the crop also increased. ""This time production is good and if things don't improve a major part of the produce would simply left to be rotten,"" he said.Kala Sanghia-based potato grower Gurminder Singh, a middle-level grower, said that farmers were now striving to recover their costs only and even that seems to be an uphill task.""We don't have any money to sow maize crop and have no money to pay the land owners whose lands we have taken on annual contract,"" said Nawan Pind-based small farmer Mandeep Singh.

(Source: Express photo by Rana Simranjit Singh) Leaving their farms behind at Rajoke village, Amritsar. (Source: Express photo by Rana Simranjit Singh)THE FARMERS of Punjab, who have been facing one crisis after the other for the past few years, are now facing indiscriminate increase in the rate of seeds of spring maize (February to May) and sunflower crops. In the absence of checks by any government agency, they are ending up paying double the amount to buy seeds for these crops. And, farmers have to depend only on dealers for the spring maize seed because the agriculture department provides the seed for Kharif season maize (June to October) only.Watch What Else Is Making NewsFarmers said that to increase rates, false shortage is being created by the seed dealers. Even some farmers groups have complained to the district administration and the agriculture department, which has issued instructions to check the availability of seed. Sunflower and spring maize crops are sown in February and March and harvested in June. We got an agreement with the dealers for getting the spring maize seed at the rate of Rs 1,200-1,400 per 4-kg bag (Rs 300-350 per kg) but farmers are being forced to pay Rs 2,100-2,200 (Rs 550 per kg) for the same quantity now as this will double our production amount, said farmer Jagat Parkash Singh Gill, secretary of Potato Seed Growers Association (PSGA), adding that they have lodged a complaint with the district administration, too.He also mentioned that dealers cartlised themselves to create a false shortage of the seed to charge hefty amount from the farmers. Prithpal Singh, another farmer and general secretary of PSGA, said that even the bills and invoice number are not provided by these dealers against the purchase of seed from them. He added that mostly hybrid seed is used for spring maize and that even the rates of the Cucurbit (Musakmelon, Watermelon etc.) has been hiked by the dealers. The rate of sunflower seed has also been increased from Rs 1,600 to Rs 2,600-3,000 per bag of four kilos, said farmers while making a representation.According to the agriculture department, around 30,000 hectares are ued for the cultivation of spring maize every year mostly in Jalandhar, Hoshiarpur and part of Ludhiana districts. Dr Jasbir Singh Bains, joint director in the agriculture department, informed that they have asked the officials of these districts to check the stock available with the dealers. They have also been asked to send a report on seed availability with the dealers, he added.Chief Agriculture Officer, Jalandhar, Jugraj Singh, said that according to their report, there is no shortage of seeds of these crops in the market and they have informed their higher-ups about it. In Jalandhar alone, spring maize is cultivated over 10,000 hectares and sunflower on nearly 1,000 hectares.The farmers said that most of the potato growers of Doaba region, after harvesting the crop in February-March, switch to cultivating spring maize and sunflower crops, which are three-four months crops only.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

The rate for storing one bag of produce (50kg) has gone up from Rs 80 to Rs 100 per bag in the past six months in Bathinda district. Now, the cold stores are asking farmers to pay Rs 20 per bag as advance too.The arrivals of fresh potato crop are expected to start in the first week of March. At present, potato is fetching a price of Rs 2 to 2.4 per kg with a 50 kg bag going for Rs 100-120.Bathinda has 35 cold storages with a capacity to stock up nearly 32 lakh bags of 50 kg each or around 1.6 lakh tonnes. Potato has been grown over 6,500 hectares in Bathinda and nearly 1.65 lakh tonnes of output of is expected in the district in the current season, which is the highest after the Doaba region.Though the state horticulture departments manages the potato cultivation, due to no minimum support price (MSP) it can't ensure higher rates from the market for the farmers. Even the rent of cold stores was fixed either under the Central Cold Storage Order, 1980, or the acts enacted by the state governments. Punjab had abolished the control on tariff fixation in 1994.""Earlier, demonetisation badly hit potato growers. With the cash flow diminishing from the market during November-December, the crop was not being sent to other states and farmers had to sell their produce in local markets at lower prices. The losses now mount further with the new crop also not fetching good rates and the cold store owners exploiting the growers,"" said Harcharan Singh Dhillon, a potato grower from Kararwala village near Rampura Phool sub-division of Bathinda. He has sown in potatoes over 200 acres. Rampura sub-division is the biggest producer of potatoes in the Malwa region.Another farmer from Kararwala Jaspal Singh said, ""The potato growers are failing to get bookings in the cold stores even after getting ready to pay more than the previous year. Most of the cold store owners are saying the space has already been booked by the traders."" He said the cold store owners had joined hands to make money by exploiting farmers.Bathinda-based Dhillon cold store owner Iqbal Singh Dhillon, however, denied any exploitation of the farmers. Iqbal said, ""Due to the hike in electricity rates, we are bound to make nominal increase in the storage rates. We are not saying no to any potato grower if we have space. Our cold store has the capacity of 80,000 bags. In the whole district, the cold stores have the capacity to store 30-32 lakh bags and nearly this much potato is produce already in the area.""Bathinda deputy director of horticulture Gurkewal Singh Dhillon also said that demonetisation had its impact on the crop and potato was not fetching the desired rates even now. ""We are taking up the issue with the cold store owners to get space for every farmer at reasonable rates.""The deputy director admitted that cold store owners had increased rates for storing potato. ""It seems tough for farmers to pay and we are trying to settle the issue,"" he said."

As potato farmers are staring at heavy losses due to drop in demand and prices, the state government held a high-powered meeting to help them deal with the slump.The CM, who chaired the meeting, suggested that inmates in all the state jails should be fed potatoes. Another idea was to serve potatoes to schoolchildren, under the government-run midday meal programme, to add to their calorie intake. The state authorities discussed the issue after leaders of farmers unions had sought their help.Low-key affairAfter the state assembly polls, Punjab deputy chief minister Sukhbir Singh Badal and his wife, Union food processing minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal, made their first visit to Amritsar on Saturday and attended the monthly bhog ceremony of akhand path at the Golden Temple.Unlike their previous trips, their outing remained low profile this time. Whenever the deputy CM was in the holy city earlier, the administrative top brass of the district used to be in attendance besides the entire local Akali leadership. However, neither any senior official nor any prominent local leader of the Shiromani Akali Dal accompanied the couple this time. The duo also showed less interest in talking to reporters.Beyond promisesIn the high-stakes poll battle for the Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee, the Shiromani Akali Dal (Badal), in its manifesto released last week, went overboard in making promises. The promises ranged from more schools and dispensaries to free education to more Sikh children.The party also listed promises it made and fulfilled. But one section titled Jo nahee kaha si, oho vee kita (What was not promised, but still accomplished) caught everyones attention. It included rescue operations carried out after Nepal earthquake and floods in Kashmir, and help given to farmers of Pehowa in Haryana to get their lands back from the state government.Foolproof formulaHaryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattars supporters in his assembly constituency of Karnal were upset over the indifference of district authorities to their genuine demands. But they have now found a way to get themselves heard.The formula, according to a local leader of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), is to invite the CM to their residence. Once officials of the district administration find out about the CMs visit, they take their demands seriously and take no time in completing all pending works, he said. The roads get repaired and painted, potholes are filled up and other issues taken care of.Chinks in Chautala clan?The much-hyped Jal Yudh (war for water) of the opposition Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) in Haryana, which ended with the arrest of its leaders, including Abhay Chautala, on Thursday was seen as the launching pad of Abhays son Arjun Chautala into politics.It was the first state-level programme in which Arjun had actively participated and went to jail along with other senior leaders of the party. However, the absence of family members of Abhays elder brother Ajay Chautala, who is in jail in teachers recruitment case, was the talking point throughout the day-long protest.Neither Ajays MLA wife Naina Chautala, nor their two sons, Hisar MP Dushyant and Digvijay, were seen at the rally. Dushyant told reporters on Sunday that he and his brother were abroad as per a pre-decided programme.Preparing for poetic politicsHimachal Pradesh chief minister Virbhadra Singh will present the general budget for financial year 2017-18 on March 10. The CM holds the finance portfolio and his budget speech lasted two hours last year. But it may be even longer this time.Officers of the finance department are making extra efforts to create a record of sorts in the state assembly, trying to incorporate just about everything.A special officer has been deputed to incorporate couplets and quotations. The officer has sent a message on WhatsApp to his friends, asking them to send best of Urdu couplets that can be used to hit out at the opposition.AAPs hilly dreamsThe Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) lacks an organisational setup in Himachal Pradesh, but its supporters showed a lot of enthusiasm during the assembly elections in neighbouring Punjab.A number of its supporters had travelled to Punjab and spent there a month, canvassing for the party candidates. On their return, they are not only eagerly awaiting the poll results, but also visiting different villages and looking for prospective candidates, hoping that the party may enter the fray in the hill state, where the elections are due later this year.(Contributed by Gurpreet Singh Nibber, Surjit Singh, Rajesh Moudgil, Neeraj Mohan and Gaurav Bisht)"

Anju Chaba Agnihotri Farmers at a spring maize field in Thammanwal village in Phillaur, Punjab. Anju Chaba AgnihotriCrop diversification and moving away from the entrenched paddy-wheat cycle has been the buzzword among Punjabs policymakers for at least two decades now. It will remain so even when the next government takes over in a couple of weeks time. But on the ground, farmers are still planting paddy during kharif and wheat in the rabi season as before. Some have gone in for diversification, but not the way policymakers, both in the state government and the Centre, would want them to. Theres no better example of this diversification dilemma than spring season maize; and it should be an eye-opener for future policymaking.Spring maize is currently being grown in about 30,000 hectares of Punjab, especially in the Doaba region covering Jalandhar, Kapurthala, Hoshiarpur and Nawanshahr districts that also constitutes the states potato belt. It is planted from mid-February to mid-March, just after harvesting of potato. Spring maizes popularity is precisely because it fits well into the potato cycle. A 95-110 day crop, it is harvested by June, well in time for planting of basmati/non-basmati paddy or even kharif maize. The latter crops are harvested in October, which is also potato planting time.The above cropping cycle, however, is not viewed favourably by the authorities, who feel it doesnt address the more fundamental problem of depleting water tables in the state. The Punjab government wants farmers to grow maize only in the kharif reason to replace water-guzzling paddy. We arent keen to promote spring season maize, as it also consumes too much water, says Jasbir Singh Bains, joint director of the state agriculture department.A senior scientist at the Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) in Ludhiana, too, seconds this view: Temperatures start rising after March and hit 35-45 degrees Celsius level by May-June alongside sunshine duration of 9-9.5 hours. This necessitates frequent watering of the standing maize crop. As an alternative, the government is encouraging farmers to grow spring/summer moong (green gram), mah/urad (black gram), sunflower, vegetables (cucumber, brinjal, capsicum, gourds, beans, etc) and green fodder  which can all be planted in February.But there are no takers for this logic amongst farmers. Why should we grow maize during the kharif season when its yields are not even 25 quintals per acre? We get 36-39 quintals or more from spring maize hybrids. And with rates of Rs 1,000-1,500 per quintal, the returns are more than even from wheat, taking 24-25 quintal/acre yield, minimum support price of Rs 1,625/quintal and 145-day crop duration, points out Jagat Prakash Gill, secretary of the Potato Seed Growers Association who cultivates spring maize of 70 out of his 100 acres land at Thammanwal village in Jalandhars Phillaur tehsil.We prefer spring maize since it is high-yielding, has shorter duration and there is good demand in the market from poultry and animal feed makers. If the government wants us to grow kharif maize, why are PAU and others not developing hybrids that yield close to what we get from the spring-planted crop? Alternatively, why dont they breed spring maize hybrids requiring less water? asks Gurraj Singh. This farmer, who cultivates spring maize on 20 out of his 25-acre holding in Jugral village of Jalandhar tehsil, also points to the Indian Institute of Maize Research, which is being shifted from Delhi to Ladhowal, not far from Phillaur: What are the people there doing to help us?This disconnect between policymakers objectives and farmers preferences has meant that the market for spring maize hybrid seeds is today controlled by private firms. The most popular hybrids in Punjab include DKC 9108 and 9120 of Monsanto and Dupont-Pioneers P1844, P1855 and 31Y45. The biggest grouse of farmers has to do with their prices, which are totally unregulated. Till a couple of years ago, these branded seeds were being sold to farmers at Rs 150-200 per kg. This season, their rates were in the Rs 525-550 per kg range. At 8 kg seeds per acre, it translates into a cost of Rs 4,200-4,400.The distributors/dealers of the seed companies promised us a rate of Rs 1,300-1,400 per bag of 4 kg in early-January. But when sowing began, we ended up paying Rs 2,100-2,200, which was above even the maximum retail price mentioned in the bags. After much hue and cry, they reduced the rates to Rs 1,600-1,700. But by then, much of the seeds had already been sold, complains Arvinder Singh, a 50-acre farmer from Sofi Pind village of Jalandhar who grows spring maize on 40 acres. He further alleges that the dealers did not even provide bills or invoices against their sales.When asked about these seemingly anti-competitive pricing practices, the spokesperson of one of the multinational firms told The Indian Express that we made the seeds available to the dealers at Rs 1,525-1,550 per bag and there was no shortage of material supplied from our end. He, however, admitted that we have no control on our distributors. Equally interesting is the response of the government, which has chosen to be a mute spectator, conveniently citing that it is committed to regulate prices and supply of only kharif season maize seeds. Its another matter that farmers arent interested in growing kharif maize. As a result, they are left with no choice but to deal with private sector monopolies and unscrupulous dealers who have exploited the demand for seeds to jack up prices. The government wants us to grow pulses and sunflower. But we have seen the way moong prices have collapsed within the last one year. For maize, there is at least a market and no lack of buyers, notes Jagat Prakash Gill.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

The farmers were led by Union patron Pooran Singh Shahkot and president Harmeet Singh Qadian.They said that while potato crop was going waste, the seeds for next maize crop had been made expensive. They also opposed giving out river waters from Punjab saying state was already grappling with water crisis as underground water table had severely depleted."

The farmers said they spend nearly Rs 22,000 to cultivate potatoes in a bigha of land but are unable to get good returns. Social worker Chand Mamud said prices have gone down to Rs 2 to Rs 3 per kg and farmers have no option but to sell their produce at low prices owing to lack of cold storage facilities. The farmers cannot sell them in the district headquarters markets either as cost of transportation is high. Mandia is the potato hub in the district, where 98 per cent farmers grow the tuber. The village, having a population over 3,500, is 10km southwest of the Barpeta district headquarters. Farmers in the village buy potato seeds, fertilizers and pesticides at high prices to grow the crop commercially. Most of them even take loans from private lenders at high interest. The village also lacks irrigation facility and due to which the farmers have to spend money to irrigate their potato fields. Prices of potato at Barpeta Road market varies between Rs 5 to Rs 10 a kilo as traders brings them from Nainital and Bengal. The production in the state has gone up since the agriculture department started distribution of the Kufri Jyoti potato variety for free from 2001 to 2014. ""This year, less rainfall in the winter helped potato production, said senior department officer Dipok Tamuli. Nagaon, Morigaon, Sonitpur, Biswanath Chariali, Barpeta and Darrang are the main potato growing districts in Assam. Agriculture department officials said abundance of quality seeds, coupled with favourable weather are the two main reasons for increase in production of potato in the state. ""Productivity of Pukhraj variety of seeds is almost double and that results maximum potato production,"" said Tamuli. The agriculture department distributed 20,924 quintals of Pukhraj and 1,860 quintals of Khyati variety of seeds among farmers this year. Both the varieties are from Punjab and known as short-duration, disease-resistant and cold-tolerant varieties. ""These varieties could be harvested in 100 days so farmers could opt for another crop assoon as the potato is harvested. Productivity is 15 to 20 times of the seed,"" said Seed Corporation of India managing director, M.P. Rownier."

Unable to sell their produce, angry farmers in the Doaba region have dumped 500 quintals of potato on the road, causing a traffic jam on the Jalandhar-Amritsar National Highway.The Punjab government had asked Markfed and National Agriculture Cooperative Marketing Federation of India (NAFED) to procure the potato crop, but they had failed to do so. So, we dumped about 500 quintals of potatoes on the main chowk in Kartarpur on the Jalandhar-Amritsar National Highway, said Harmeet Singh Kadian, State president of the Bhartiya Kisan Union.The trouble began in November when farmers from Bihar, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Gujarat cancelled their orders for potato seeds from Punjab because demonetisation ensured they could not pay for it.Usually, Punjab farmers sell around 200 quintals of potato seed at the rate of `3,000 per quintal. This time, the losses are estimated at Rs 1,500 crore. Many farmers, who waited for the prices to stabilise, left their crops standing in the field. But then the new crop came in February, adding to the standing stock and a lot of unsold potatoes already kept in cold storage.Post-demonetisation and the coming of the new crop, there has been a crash in potato prices. Now, potatoes are selling at Rs 1.50 to Rs 2 per kg compared to Rs 8 to Rs 10 per kg earlier, said J S Sangha, Jalandhar Potato Growers Association general secretary.Farmers should dump the potato outside banks if the government doesnt support them in anyway. The crop dumped yesterday was just a trailer. We will dump the whole crop across the State, as storing it in cold storage costs us much more.In an attempt to resolve the crisis, the Punjab government is now trying to export the crop to Russia and Iran."

Giving an example, he said in the sale of potato chips, the farmer is ignored whereas being the grower of the crop, he should be an important factor in this chain.The state government is following the concept of peri-urban agriculture, as he had seen in Beijing, where farmers' output meets the needs of adjoining cities.""Agricultural products, being perishable, have a short life. Therefore, the farmers must cultivate need based crops in areas adjoining cities. Emphasis is being laid on bringing 25 per cent of the cultivable area under horticulture. Apart from a modern vegetable mandi, a flower mandi is also being developed,"" he added.The minister said in milk production, Haryana is next to Gujarat and Punjab. ""But as Haryana has potential to do better, it can excel in this field by promoting dairy farming as a profession and adopting some new means,"" he said.Referring to organic farming, he cited the example of Sikkim which is now an 'Organic State' and has been honoured by the Prime Minister.Dhankar said the 400 gaushalas in Haryana can contribute towards promotion of organic farming.The concept of climate-smart agriculture or risk agriculture has already been adopted in some countries to meet the challenge posed by climate change. For instance, Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana is an initiative to meet such challenges, he added.To a question, he said the state government is keen to set up a processing unit for horticulture crops and a mandi of frozen products to facilitate the sale of agri products in off season."

Before the onset of the paddy season, farmers in some pockets of Punjab prefer growing watermelon and muskmelon from March to May. With the state-owned Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) not producing any hybrid seeds of watermelons, the farmers are solely dependent on private companies, which are selling seeds ranging from Rs 20,000 per kg to Rs 70,000 per kg depending on the variety. Even the seeds of PAUs non-hybrid watermelon variety, Sugar Baby, are not available for sale at its seed shop on the university campus. When The Indian Express visited the PAU seed shop to buy the watermelon seed, the staff deployed at the shop said, Seeds are currently unavailable, although the sowing season has already begun.What else is making news:The state agriculture department has no control over the seed prices of private companies, which enjoy monopoly in hybrid seed sale. Speaking to The Indian Express, Maheshinder Singh, a potato farmer who has started cultivation of watermelon this season after suffering losses in potato crop, said, I have purchased the hybrid watermelon seed for Rs 50,000/kg manufactured by a Bengaluru-based company. The government is not taking any step to check how private companies are looting farmers in selling hybrid seeds. After potato glut, I decided to sow watermelon before paddy to tide over the potato loss to some extent but even melon seeds are so expensive.Watermelon is mostly grown in the Doaba belt of the state with Kapurthala, Nakodar, Shahkot, Jalandhar pockets being dotted with most of the farms. Some pockets are also there in Ludhiana, Fatehgarh Sahib and villages near Sutlej banks. With warm weather required for watermelon cultivation coming early in southern parts of the country, the fruit from Karnataka and other southern states also enter the markets of Punjab before farmers here can harvest.Watermelons from Bengaluru and Chennai are already available at shops in Punjab. In fact, they are available round the year now. So, farmers in Punjab are losing interest in watermelons. Seeds are too expensive and then, at mandis, non-hybrid varieties fetch Rs 5 per kg or even less only in peak summers, said Gurpreet Singh, another farmer from Amloh. The hybrid varieties still fetch Rs 50-15/kg for farmers at mandis, Rs 15 being the closing rate at the end of the season. Dilbag Singh, senior scientist, PAU vegetable department, said, PAU is working to develop hybrid variety seeds but it will still take a few years for seeds to reach farmers. Our non-hybrid variety Sugar Baby seeds cost Rs 300-400 per kg only. Since private companies have monopoly on hybrid as of now, their prices are skyrocketing.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

(PTI Photo) Representational Image. (PTI Photo)This has been a terrible year for potato farmers, with prices everywhere  from Agra and Farrukhabad in Uttar Pradesh to Burdwan in West Bengal  crashing to well below Rs 4 per kg levels. But about 10,000 growers in West Bengal have managed to realise an extra Rs 5 or so per kg, by supplying to the global snack and beverage giant PepsiCo under a contract farming initiative.Watch What Else Is Making NewsAt current rates of Rs 3.40-3.80 per kg for normal potatoes, farmers are grossing Rs 170-190 from every 50-kg sack that doesnt even cover production costs. However, some of us who have entered into collaborative farming with PepsiCo are being paid Rs 8.40 per kg. That works out to an extra Rs 230-250, compared to what we would have got by selling a sack of regular potatoes, points out Shantinath Nandi.This four-bigha (one acre) farmer from Anandapur village in Hooghly districts Goghat block under Arambag subdivision has been growing process-grade potatoes for PepsiCo for the last six years. He produces between 90 and 110 sacks of the tuber from each bigha, which gives Rs 42,000 at Rs 8.40 per kg. After deducting costs of Rs 22,000-25,000, it leaves a profit of Rs 17,000-20,000 per bigha or Rs 170-200 a sack. Had Nandi been growing ordinary table-grade potatoes, his total revenue itself would have been just Rs 170-190, not enough to take care of even cultivation costs of over Rs 200 per sack or Rs 4 per kg.The process-grade potato varieties such as Atlantic, FC3 and FC5, which PepsiCo is promoting, contain 20 per cent dry matter and 80 per cent water. Table varieties have about 85 per cent water. The lower dry matter content makes them less suitable for processing, as the extra water adds to dehydration and energy costs. Normal potatoes also have higher accumulation of reducing sugars. These, when fried, are subjected to certain enzymatic reactions, leading to their blackening. The resultant chips or fries tend to acquire a dark brownish colour, whereas ideally they should possess a light yellow hue.Shantinath Nandi, Asim Chowdhury and other farmers at Anandapur are among the many who have taken to cultivating process-grade potatoes for PepsiCo, under an arrangement where the Indian subsidiary of the American multinational undertakes to purchase their entire produce at a fixed price announced a month before planting.All they have to do is to grow the potatoes for us, says Jaideep Bhatia, director-agro at PepsiCo India.The maker of Lays and Uncle Chipps potato chips brands does contract cultivation  collaborative farming is the term it prefers to use  in Punjab, West Bengal, Maharashtra, Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh. In West Bengal, its direct farm sourcing operations are spread across nine districts: Hooghly, Howrah, Burdwan, West Midnapore, Birbhum, Bankura, Jalpaiguri, Cooch Behar and Alipurduar.In 2010, our procurement was 39,998 tonnes from West Bengal. This year, we will do 72,250 tonnes. This programme is a big success for us, claims Bhatia. He adds that PepsiCo not only provides farmers with disease-free true potato seeds produced from its laboratory in Punjab, but also tractor-drawn planters and other equipment, crop protection and extension services, cold storage and insurance facilitation.Ive been working with this company for the last 5-6 years and there is certainly increased interest among growers for this kind of cultivation, notes Chandicharan Mondal, a potato aggregator, who has brought 200-odd farmers under PepsiCos programme.But the quantities being procured by PepsiCo and other food processing majors are only a fraction of the 10 million tonnes annual potato production of West Bengal alone. While contract cultivation of processing-grade potatoes is useful, there are limits to how much these can replace the normal aloo used in day-to-day meals and table preparations. And to that extent, the woes of growers cannot be wished away.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Strangely, the slide in the wholesale price failed to have any impact on retail market. The retail price rose gradually from Rs 6 to Rs 10 in some markets till Monday.Demonetisation, bumper production in states like UP and Punjab and bumper crop in Bengal collectively have left Bengal's farmers in a tight spot. The shortage of cash and excess supply have hit demand, resulting in a dip in prices. Farmers stare at a huge loss as most of them have taken loans from mahajans at a high interest rate keeping in mind the profits made in 2015-16. ""There was low yield in 2015-16. The retail prices rose up to Rs 24 per kg in city markets,"" said Gour Das of Purshura, a potato farmer, who took loan at a high interest rate and now finds it difficult to recover production cost.It's a mystery how the wholesale potato price and the retail price become inversely proportional. While the potato wholesale prices plunge, retail prices rise. Potato traders blamed the 6-tier middlemen system working between the wholesalers and retailers and higher margin of profit by a retailer as reasons for the price mismatch. On Monday, the wholesale price in Hooghly, Burdwan and Bankura  three major potato-producing districts  ranged between Rs 2.5 and Rs 3. Farmers fear that if the trend continues, the prices may plunge to as low as Rs 1 per kg.There is severe shortage of cash flow in the potato market. Besides, several big businessmen, a sizeable number of teachers, government employees and professionals invest in potato. ""They buy from the farmers and put the same in the cold storage, expecting a good price at the end of the season. However, demonetisation and this year's bumper production desisted them from investing in this sector,"" said Arup Dutta, an agro-economist.""While the total potato yield in 2015-16 in Bengal was 90 lakh tonnes, this year it has shot up to 1.15 crore tonnes,"" said potato merchant Biswarup De. He said that last year both the potato merchants and cold storage owners sustained heavy loss due to demonetisation as most of the transaction in the business is done in cash.Agriculture minister Purnendu Bose said, ""We observe March 14 as Krishi Diwas.

The 58-year-old farmer is an MA English (honours) and carries out his farm operations on 40 acres of land in addition to 35 acres on lease. In 1977, he started cultivating potato and emerged as an inspiration to other farmers. Having derived inspiration from him, Goniana block of Bathinda is today known for successful potato growers.Rajinder Singh Dhaliwal, from Aabuwal village of Ludhiana, and Vinder Singh of Chathe Nanhera village near Sunam in Sangrur, were awarded with ""chief minister award"" for excellence in horticulture. A progressive farmer, Dhaliwal gave up the traditional paddy-wheat cultivation and started the grass cultivation on one acre in 2006 after seeking technical guidance from the PAU department of floriculture and landscaping, PAU.He prepared weed-free grass roll from good quality variety, which was well-accepted by the nurseries of Punjab. At present, he is earning substantially by growing grass of seven different varieties on his five acres of land in addition to 12 acres on lease.Giving up the traditional paddy-wheat cycle, Vinder opted for crop diversification. In 1996, he started the cultivation of capsicum on one acre area on lease. Thereafter, he received training in hybrid seed production from the PAU's farm advisory service centre in Sangrur. A well-read farmer with immense scientific knowledge, he started raising and selling nursery of capsicum after procuring male and female lines from PAU.The other four awardee farmers include Narinder Singh of Ajowal village of Hoshiarpur, Hardeep Singh of Kagga village in Patran tehsil of Patiala, Paramjit Singh of Pawat village in Ludhiana, Aparpal Singh Mahal of Tungwali village in Bathinda."

Also, raw green potatoes should not be served at all.Recently, seeing the potato glut in the market, Punjab government has proposed its export to other countries. Also, government schools were ordered to enhance potato purchase for mid-day meals and gurudwaras for langars.Speaking to The Indian Express, Dr Manju Wadhwa, head of animal nutrition department, GADVASU said, We have studied potential of potatoes as livestock feed. It can be a good source of cattle feed that improves the milk yield without any adverse effect on milk composition or body weight (BW) of the animals.As per GADVASU study, potatoes should be thoroughly washed and introduced gradually into animals diet with increasing amounts over period of 2-3 weeks. At start, feeding should be 1.52.5 kg/day with gradual increase to 4.56.5 kg/day for calves, 1011 kg/day for yearlings (above one year) and 1618 kg/day for 500 kg cows.We should not feed potatoes higher than 30% of the DM (dry matter) intake or 2.5-4.0% of body weight (BW). In any case it should not exceed 10% of their BW in any case. Frozen potatoes should not be fed because animals cannot chew them and are likely to choke while attempting to swallow them whole. They should be mashed or chaffed with roughage, added Wadhwa.The study has also found that  nutritional value of 4.55 kg potatoes are equivalent to 1 kg barley or corn grains. But this does not mean a farmer should feed cattle with 4-5 kg potato at once. It has to be fed very carefully beginning with limited quantity, she said.Feeding higher levels may cause milk fat depression, indigestion and bloating among animals, cautions Wadhwa. In no case, fungal infested, sprouted, sun burnt (green) potatoes should be fed. Frozen potatoes should be brought to room temperature and then fed, she added.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd"

But this time it is not the big brand ambassadors who are doing image building, but professional influencers who are trying to tap bloggers who could be opinion makers.The New Indian Express has learnt that the cola major has hired a Chennai-based influencer to reach out to bloggers with good following for an image revamp.Chennai-based Digital Influencer or Dinfluencer is currently conducting a telephonic survey and sending out questionnaires on behalf of PepsiCo to hardsell its Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiatives.Since the cola major has been in the news for all wrong reasons, with protesters holding them responsible for depletion of ground water table, Dinfluencer told that objective of the survey was to change that perception.There is a perception that Pepsi is depleting groundwater and not doing anything to the farmers, but actually it is not true. They (Pepsi) are giving more to farmers. We need to create awareness about their new CSR initiatives, the marketing representative says.Heres how the conversation goes: Do you know that PepsiCo helps around 25,000 potato farmers in Punjab by buying their produce for its popular snack, Lays? Do you know that PepsiCo sources about 65 per cent of all fruits used in their products like Tropicana from Indian farmers? You can write about these CSR initiatives in the social media, the caller helpfully suggests.As part of the public relations exercise, the callers request the bloggers to make on-site visits to check out the CSR initiatives and write about them.Next month, an interactive event with PepsiCo will be organised in Chennai to put all bloggers who are on board on one platform.After this reporter sent his responses to the survey, another representative of Dinfluencer called in, saying: We will be contacting you through e-mail for influencer campaigns to promote the CSR initiatives of PepsiCo, and the association can be long term. At the end of survey, we will send you a gift hamper worth Rs 300 to your address."

He directed the officials concerned to ensure that only 33 approved varieties of seeds are sold at monitored prices to prevent loss of crop on this account and also coordinate with neighbouring Haryana to ensure that the same quality seeds are sown in the region.Chairing a meeting of the agriculture department here, Amarinder said he would write to Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeking price support to compensate the farmers for the loss incurred due to the difference between maizes market price of Rs 1,100 and the governments Minimum Support Price (MSP) of Rs 1,300.Though the central government declares MSP for maize, it does not directly buy the produce, he said.The Chief Minister directed the agriculture department to explore the possibility of tying up with a commodities exchange or set up an exchange for trading of commodities like potato and cotton to ensure guaranteed sale and save farmers from distress selling, an official spokesperson said here.Amarinder expressed concern over declining cotton yields in the state due to whitefly infestation and told the Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) to explore possibilities of introducing better quality Egyptian and Australian cotton varieties to increase profits.Referring to cotton as white gold of southern Malwa region, he underlined the need to educate farmers on the use of less insecticides and pesticides.Directing the officials concerned to ensure sale and use of only PAU-approved pesticides and recognised seeds, the Chief Minister said the agriculture department would need to reach out to 1,500 villages to educate the farmers and create awareness about the threat of whitefly.At the meeting, the agriculture department informed that it has sufficient quantities of seeds, pesticides and fertilizers for the coming crop season.Amarinder also directed the irrigation and power department to ensure regular supply of canal water and electricity supply from April 15.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

A shipment of potato seeds (which were to be distributed to farmers for sowing in the coming season) had arrived at Whitefield Railway Station from Punjab. The delicate seeds had to be taken to a cold storage facility close to Hoskote within a few hours, else they would become duds. We did not have the time to remove our seats to increase capacity of our buses. We rushed 20 buses within half hour, he said.Nearly 100 trips were done to and from Whitefield station, and the whole load  crammed into luggage spaces, on and under the seats  were transported.As the transporters strike intensifies, more associations have joined the strike against the hike in insurance premiums for goods vehicles.With the strike expected to continue longer, KSRTC has geared itself for all exigencies.We have instructed all our district offices to ensure buses to help farmers transport their agricultural produce.

593ba9007be9e0066b6f608a,Rahul farmer salvo,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170406/jsp/nation/story_144836.jsp,2017-04-06,"New Delhi, April 5: Rahul Gandhi today asked the BJP ""not to play politics with farmers"" by waiving loans in Uttar Pradesh alone as agrarian distress was a national crisis and the Centre should come up with a ""national"" response. Although Rahul described the Uttar Pradesh government's decision as a ""step in the right direction"", he alleged inaction by the Narendra Modi government by tweeting: ""I am happy the BJP has finally been forced to see reason. But let's not play politics with our farmers who are suffering across the country."" Contending that the Congress has always supported loan waivers for farmers in distress, Rahul said in another tweet: ""The Central Government must have a national response to the widespread distress and not discriminate amongst states."" In the context of Uttar Pradesh too, he said the relief was only ""partial"". The waivers apply to harvest loans up to Rs 1 lakh. Rahul had petitioned Prime Minister Modi seeking loan waivers for farmers of Uttar Pradesh and Punjab before the recent elections in these states. Although he has often demanded a national policy to provide such financial relief, the demand letters he submitted to the government were from the farmers of Uttar Pradesh and Punjab. The Uttar Pradesh decision is bound to have repercussions and the Congress appears to have fuelled the discontent with Rahul's response. Sharad Pawar has criticised the selective relief and exhorted the farmers of Maharashtra to intensify their agitation and ""make the life of the government miserable"". Devendra Fadnavis, the chief minister of Maharashtra which has witnessed the maximum number of suicides in recent times, was compelled to issue a statement that his BJP-led government was examining the issue of loan waivers. The Congress has also pointed to the drought in the southern states and asked the Centre not to address the agrarian crisis according to pressures of political exigencies. Rahul had recently joined the farmers of Tamil Nadu who have been protesting at Delhi's Jantar Mantar for more than 20 days. The Congress is also planning to raise the issues of farmers in Gujarat, which goes to the polls later this year. The Prime Minister had made a public commitment to waive loans of farmers in Uttar Pradesh and, at the state's first cabinet meeting yesterday, the promise has been partially fulfilled. The Yogi Adityanath government decided to waive loans worth Rs 30,700 crore while the total outstanding debt of farmers is Rs 92,241 crore. In Congress-ruled Punjab, an expert committee has been set up to prepare a proposal. The Congress, aware that Punjab's finances are in a mess, expects the Centre to step in. Chief minister Amarinder Singh has already met the Prime Minister seeking assistance for fulfilling the loan-waiver promise. Congress spokesperson Rajeev Gowda said the agrarian distress was the outcome of the policies of the Centre and a national scheme was needed to ameliorate the farmers' plight. Congress communications chief Randeep Surjewala described the Uttar Pradesh government's decision as a ""mirage"" that skipped the need for addressing the real crisis. ""There are 2.33 crore farmers in UP, of which 2.15 crore are marginal farmers. The proposal will cover barely 86 lakh farmers. The government should have waived the total debt, including term loans. Nothing was done for sugarcane and potato farmers,"" Surjewala said."

""Dilip Sahab hails from Peshawar and was pleased to receive this honour as a son of the Punjabi community,"" said spokesman Jasbir Singh Dham.Bengal Club will celebrate Poila Boishakh at Shivaji Park on April 15-16.

On Sunday night, about 100 Bengalis will assemble for a potluck meal, and this time, non-vegetarian delicacies will be included.This year, Good Friday coincides with Vishu so a few Malayalis will spend April 14 in prayer. Apart from an elaborate 'sadya' or vegetarian feast, the highlight of Vishu is the 'vishukani' arrangement. Elders assemble an image of Lord Krishna, betel leaves and nuts, uruli vessel, mirror, haldi, kumkum and the yellow kanikonna flower that blossoms in April. Early morning, each member of the family is blindfolded and led to the vishukani which is the first thing he is made to glimpse after unravelling it.Around 1,500 Malayali families in Airoli, Navi Mumbai, will celebrate with the Kairali Airoli Malayalee Samajam. Its president R C Pillai said, ""At 5.30am, we will arrange the 'vishukani' and carry it around the homes of a few community members. These days it is not possible for everybody to assemble all the items at home so we devised this idea.""Where families are buying five 'konnu poovu' flowers for Rs 50 in Matunga market, lucky residents of Airoli pick the bl-ossoms from the trees that line Airoli-Mulund bridge or Reliance and Siemens compounds."

However, most of the agreements signed during the previous two editions of the Progressive Punjab investors' summit are yet to see the light of the day.The previous SAD-BJP alliance had organized the first investor summit in 2013 and claimed to have signed agreements worth Rs 67,000 crore. The second edition of the event in 2015, focused on attracting investments in manufacturing, IT agro-processing , healthcare and bio-sciences, and garnered promises of Rs 1.13 lakh crore investment.According to Punjab Bureau of Investment Promotion, a total of 519 memoranda of understanding (MoUs) were inked at the two summits of the previous regime.

Similarly, at the summit held two years back, of 391 MoUs were inked. Of these, barely 53 or 13%, translated into investment.There was lot of euphoria over the initial interest shown by the big companies to invest in the state. An official of the bureau said that some agreements were in the process of being converted into investment and the final figures would go up. These include 17 projects from the 2013 summit and 64 from the 2015 summit, he said, citing ADLABS amusement park worth Rs 1,200 crore, and Rs 1,400 crore integrated food manufacturing unit as examples.Some of the key projects that have construction work completed include ITC's Rs 680 crore food-cum-logistics center at Kapurthala and Mahindra & Mahindra's Rs 18 crore seed potato project in Mohali. However, there are certain projects that have been put on hold due to various policy issues, including a Rs 50 crore frozen meat project in Mohali, and Rs 80 crore food processing project in Ludhiana.A private university with investment of Rs 350 crore, super speciality hospital for Rs 900 crore, medical university and hospital with estimated cost Rs 1,200 crore, are also in the pipeline listed under the ""Active Conversion Projects"" even though the MoUs were signed after the 2013 summit.The previous government had offered a slew of incentives including cheap power to new investors at Rs 4.90 per unit for five years, VAT retention, exemption from stamp duty, and electricity duty as per the 2013 industrial policy."

According to the plan, 55 acres would be brought under plantation of citrus plantation varieties of Kinnow, Daisy and W Murcott.

It has been the second year of a bumper onion crop with no buyers, forcing the government to announce a belated decision to procure the onions for Rs 8 per kilogram.Farmers are angry because the government neither made arrangements to procure the crop on time nor intervened to ensure a reasonable price. They threw onions on roads given the prices of the vegetables plummeted to as low as Re 1 to Rs 2 per kg in certain markets, especially in the Malwa region, last year. This year too, farmers had to sell their winter crop  tomato and potato  at throwaway prices, bearing heavy loss.The distress is visible in the suicide numbers. From February 2016 to mid-February 2017, 1,982 farmers and farm labourers reportedly committed suicide, which was one-fifth of the total suicides in the state, where 21,000 farmers have taken their lives in 16 years.The National Crime Records Bureau attributed the reasons to crop failure, failure to sell produce, inability to repay loans, and other non-agriculture factors such as poverty and property disputes.The farmers should have been affluent if 20% growth figure given by the government is to be believed, said former state agriculture director GS Kaushal.

Experts say crop failure rate in the rain-fed regions is high.The state governments zero percent interest loan benefitted some farmers. But farmers in general were not able to claim benefits again as they were not able to repay the short-term loan.

They said as potato cultivation required high investment, banks were already after them as they were defaulting on payments while failing to recover their costs."

The Centre itself had announced that it would strive to double farmers' incomes by 2022. All these were raising expectations of farmers, especially after enjoying a good monsoon and record harvest in 2016-17, after two consecutive years of drought.Yet why are farmers - the lifeline of India - angry and resentful?One of the key factors fuelling agrarian anger is that good year or bad year, they are unable to earn enough. There is always a mismatch between their cost of production and what they get in the mandis. A quick comparison of cost of production and farm harvest prices as data collected by the agriculture ministry reveals the mismatch for 2014-15, the last year for which such information is available.In several states, for several widely cultivated produce like paddy and wheat, prices at which farmers are selling their harvest are actually lower than what they spent in cultivating the crop. In Madhya Pradesh, the epicenter of current agitation, paddy was fetching 15% less than cost of production while wheat was giving them just 2% profit.MP has emerged as a major player on the national scene exhibiting an agricultural growth rate of 9.7% between 2005-06 and 2014-15 compared to 3.6% for India as a whole. Share of agriculture in MP's gross state domestic product has increased from 25% to over 30% in this period. Area under vegetables and fruits has increased by 78% since 2010-11. According to a study done by Ashok Gulati and his colleagues at ICRIER, expanded irrigation, strong procurement system for wheat and bonus over its minimum support price and expansion of all-weather roads to connect farmers to markets have led to this boom in agriculture.Yet, after enjoying the boom for several years, the state's farmers have ended up in the same trap that has been haunting their brethren in other states. The reason why farmers don't get suitable margins is because of their input costs  water, diesel, fertiliser, etc. For cultivating wheat in MP, Rs 1,241.34 were spent on fertilisers per hectare in 2004-05 which has more than doubled to Rs 2,695.27 per hectare in 2014-15. Similarly, cost of seeds used in one hectare increased from Rs 998 in 2004-05 to Rs 2,653 in 2014-15. Even cost of irrigation has jumped from Rs 1,961.50 to Rs 2,599.55 in this period. These and other costs like labour, agricultural machinery hiring charges, pesticides, rents, have all gone up while prices that farmers get have lagged behind.As recently reported, support prices may be higher than what farmers get but getting payments is so difficult that farmers often have to sell to traders at lower prices. This dire situation is also causing mounting indebtedness of farmers with over half of agricultural households in debt as per an NSSO survey for 2012-13. MP was reported to have 46% debt ridden farmers.Should farmers diversify to get more value for their crops? This would appear to be a way out except that even in those cases, farmers' margins plummet after some time. UP's potato farmers were getting a measly 5% profit, while in Punjab, cotton farmers have suffered enormous losses of as much as 20%."

Onion was being sold for just Rs 1 in Madhya Pradesh till the state government stepped in to buy, potato is still being sold for 80 paise in Haryana and pigeon pea (tur dal) is fetching no more than Rs 40 in Maharashtra.The glut and plunging prices is the sum total of the crisis staring at farmers across the length and breath of the country. Last week, matters came to a head after farmers protest in Mandsaur of Madhya Pradesh turned violent, resulting in six deaths.Like everywhere else, Mandsaur farmers were agitating after they were forced to sell onions at just Rs1 a kg. The prices are well below what they fetched in 2016: Onion for Rs 1 as against Rs 7, turmeric for Rs 50, half the price in 2016, soya bean at 33% lesser than the rate in 2016 and so on.Farmers blame their plight on demonetisation and the failure of the government to impose adequate import duty on time.Farm economy runs on cash and traders say they have no money to give us. We are forced to sell the produce at whatever price they (traders) are offering, said Jasbir Mamumajra, a sunflower grower from Yamunanagar in Haryana, who blamed demonetisation for his woes.Most of the agriculture trade used to run on cash, mostly unaccounted money, and on credit. With cash being sucked out, the traders have less liquid asset to take risks. In some places they are seeking a commission of up to 2% to make payment in cash.A farm trader in Indias food bowl of Punjab, Devinder Singh, agrees, saying note-bandhi has disturbed the trade cycle. Entire trade shifted to no-credit system. It has hit us hard, he said.An agriculture expert with Bihar government, Anil Kumar Jha, said input costs such as labour, fertilisers and pesticides have gone up significantly this year. This added to the miseries of farmers, already facing cash crisis due to demonetisation.Maharashtra farmers, who were first to protest after prices of pigeon pea (tur dal) fell, blamed the Centre for not imposing high import duty on pulses.The production cost of the tur per quintal is more than Rs5,000 for farmers. With the Union government allowing the import of lentil at Rs 3,700 a quintal, the farmers are not likely to recover their cost, said Vijay Jawandhia, farm activist and Shetkari Sangathana leader.Same was the complaint by farmers in Haryana, who have been forced to sell sunflower at Rs 2,500 per quintal as against the minimum support price of Rs 3,950 even though the cost of seeds have increased by almost 50% in 2016.We could have been saved had the government increased import duty on edible (palm) oil, said Balwinder Singh, a Karnal-based farmer. However, state government officials blamed poor quality for the low price.In Asias largest grain market in Khanna, Punjab, the prices of maize have plummeted with traders like Sanjeev Kumar saying the farmers are bearing the brunt. In Uttar Pradesh, farmers sold wheat at less than the minimum support price, saying government agencies were not willing to buy the produce because of the record production this year.Wholesale traders in Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh said the prices of onion, tomato and potato have crashed.The per quintal wholesale prices of the onion in Maharashtra was down to Rs 600-800 from Rs 1,000-1,250 in 2016. Potato in Haryana was sold at Rs 80 a quintal on Tuesday. Farmers sold onion for Rs 1 in Madhya Pradesh after which the government announced a procurement price of Rs 8 per kilogram.P Chengal Reddy, founder-chairman of the Consortium of Indian Farmers Associations (CIFA), said: The Centre takes into consideration the average production of past three years and not the current years production cost, in deciding the MSP. If it continues, time is not far when farmers across the country will revolt, he said.(With inputs from state bureaus)"

Though potato dealers are not sure about the exact GST, which will imposed, they apprehend that it could be between 20%-28%. Nijjar said presently there was no VAT or duty on farm machinery, but they apprehend that the government could impose 28% GST on farm implements used for potato cultivation.Stating that presently there was nil duty on agriculture implements, Nijjar said that if the tax structure of GST was not corrected it could destroy the future of lakhs of people directly and indirectly involved in the potato industry.""First it was demonetization that took a toll on the farmers and dealers, and now the GST,"" said J P Singh Gill , another office-bearer of JPGA. He said that in Punjab more than 25 lakh tonnes of potato seed was used annually, especially in Jalandhar, Nawanshahr, Hoshiarpur, Kapurthala and a few districts of Malwa ""It's strange that the government gives 25% subsidy on setting up cold chain, cold storage and tissue culture labs but it has proposed to levy 28% GST,"" said Gill. Nijjar added that they had urged the Centre to exempt the industry from the GST. ""If at all the government is keen to impose the GST, it shouldn't be more than 5%,"" he maintained."

Apart from the natural calamity of drought, there were man-made calamities, and this column is about how the two have brought about the explosive situation in the country.Farmers agitations are spreading across many states. It is the culmination of the acute distress in the farm sector that many observers have written and spoken about in the last two years. Two years of drought in many states was the main cause. The governments cannot be blamed for the occurrence of drought, but governments are solely responsible for the mismanagement of the consequences of drought. Apart from the natural calamity of drought, there were man-made calamities, and this column is about how the two have brought about the explosive situation in the country.The bulk of farmers in India have no choice but to do farming. Land is the only asset they have, farming is the only skill they possess, and unless they grow food many of them will face starvation. Agriculture, despite its declining share in total output (GDP), is also the largest employer. In Indias economy, the agriculture sector has primacy.The Price of NeglectUnfortunately, the NDA government lost sight of this basic truth. The agriculture portfolio is the Cinderella of this government. The Minister of Agriculture, unchanged since May 2014, is a political lightweight with little clout within the government. (How many of you can name Mr Sharad Pawars successor?). The minister has been neither seen nor heard by most people. The only memorable statement on agriculture that I can recall was when he repeated the Prime Ministers promise to double farmers income in 6 years and when asked if they had meant real income or nominal income, there was deafening silence.On the other hand, the government erred grievously on the issue of minimum support prices (MSP). In its manifesto and in the election campaign, the BJP had unequivocally promised that it would implement the M S Swaminathan Committees recommendation that MSP should be cost plus 50 per cent. In government, the BJP not only reneged on its promise, it dealt a body blow to farmers by denying them even a reasonable increase in MSP in its first three years. The numbers speak for themselves:The ostensible reason for denying a fair MSP was that higher MSP fueled inflation, which is partly true, but to lean in favour of inflation control against the interest of Indias farmer-producers was the height of folly. Some inflation is inevitable, and the government and the RBI must use other instruments to moderate inflation rather than reduce the farming community to penury.Errors galoreThe second grave error was demonetisation. Mr Harish Damodaran has convincingly demonstrated how demonetisation has crippled the post-harvest agricultural economy (see The Crops of Wrath, Indian Express, June 12, 2017). Agricultural products are bought and sold largely in cash. Demonetisation dried up liquidity and prices have crashed. According to Mr Damodaran, never before have prices of tomato, potato and onion crashed at the same time. Same is the situation with soyabean, arhar, garlic, methi (fenugreek) and grapes. Saying that farmers have resorted to fire sales, Mr Damodarans conclusion is, We have entered deflation territory in farm produce, whose proximate trigger clearly has been demonetisation.The third error was when the Prime Minister announced, on behalf of the yet-to-be-elected Uttar Pradesh government, that all farm loans in UP will be waived if the BJP formed the government. More likely, it was just an election promise in a state that the BJP perhaps did not expect to win, but it was an unequivocal promise that has returned to haunt the BJP in several states. Farm loan waivers are neither intrinsically good nor bad. As Dr M S Swaminathan said a few days ago, Loan waivers, though temporarily necessary, do not provide for a secure long term credit system (emphasis supplied). When farmers do not get a fair and reasonable price and are unable to repay their loans, they demand a loan waiver. The holder of the highest political office promised a total loan waiver, why blame the farmers for demanding that the promise be implemented?In February 2008, the fiscal situation was excellent, growth had found a new momentum, and a one-time loan forgiveness to small and medium farmers was justified. The central government was confident it could fund the waiver and so it went ahead and announced it. In 2017, however, every prudent norm was turned on its head. The Prime Minister promised a loan waiver on behalf of an yet-to-be-elected state government, no one seems to have examined the capacity of UP to bear the burden, and no one seems to have factored the fallout in other states. Having mounted a tiger, the BJP does not know how to dismount it. Meanwhile, the tiger is galloping through Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Punjab, Haryana, Maharashtra and Gujarat.Jobless youth angryThe last straw was jobless growth. Young men can find no work on farms or off farms. Micro, small and medium businesses are not offering new jobs. Tier 2, 3 and 4 towns are full of jobless youth and their anger has turned against the central government. The BJP will not admit its mistakes. Nor will any BJP leader tell the Prime Minister that mistakes were made. Will the Prime Minister pull a rabbit out of the hat?

5a05169b9855b76bf13bf9e6,Farm protest rages across India,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/617965/farm-protest-rages-across-india.html,2017-06-18,"Devinder Sharma, Jun 18 2017, 1:06 ISTAgrarian crisis: Only a holistic, pragmatic policy can end the tragedy unfolding in rural areas since decadesFarmers anger is spilling over. The violent agitation that erupted in the Malwa belt of Madhya Pradesh, resulting in the death of five farmers in police firing, has now spread to Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Gujarat and Chhattisgarh. The demand for farm loan waiver, accompanied by higher crop prices, is now gaining momentum.More than 3.18 lakh farmers have committed suicide in the past 21 years. Every 41 minutes a farmer commits suicide in the country. While I agree that farmer suicides are a symptom of a bigger malaise that afflicts agriculture, policymakers have failed to take the massive death toll as a sign of terrible economic depravity that plagued the rural landscape. How long could we expect farmers to take the hit silently? It had to happen one day, and no one knew what will trigger it.For nearly three decades, more so after the economic reforms were ushered in, agriculture has been a victim of neglect and apathy. Following the World Banks prescription of moving 400 million people from the rural to the urban areas by the year 2015, successive governments deliberately created conditions to turn farming unviable, thereby forcing an increasing number of farmers to abandon agriculture and migrate to cities. To keep food inflation under control, farmers have been routinely paid less, not even to cover the cost of production, thereby driving them against the wall.With each passing year, the crisis worsened. The 2016 Economic Survey tells us that the average annual income of a farming family in 17 states, roughly half the country, is a mere Rs 20,000 or less than Rs 1,700 a month. Such a dismal income, merely enough for subsistence, was the outcome of economic policies over the years. I shudder to think how these farming families must be surviving all these years. After all, it is not even possible to rear a cow in less than Rs 1,700 a month.But I doubt if such details mean anything to mainline economists and policymakers. With the markets crashing after every harvest, and with the government reluctant to save farmers by ensuring that they get at least the Minimum Support Price (MSP), farmers are pushed deeper and deeper into a never-ending cycle of debt. Even the MSP is often less than the cost of production. In Maharashtra, the production cost of tur dal has been worked out at Rs 6,240 per quintal. The MSP was Rs 5,050 per quintal, but the price at which farmers were able to sell tur, and that too after waiting for nearly a week in the mandis, was between Rs 3,500 and Rs 4,200 per quintal.Take another case. A farmer in Haryana toils hard for three months, putting all his labour to reap a bountiful harvest of potato only to find the prices crashing, thereby forcing him to sell 40 quintals of potato for just 9 paise a kg. The shock often turns fatal. But the fact remains that the government has rarely come to his rescue. Compare this with the fall in stock markets, and the finance minister promises to monitor the crisis on an hourly basis, holding a press conference to assuage the investors. Have we ever seen the finance minister or the agriculture minister monitoring the deplorable condition when farm prices crash?The poor farmer has been left to live in indebtedness, which keeps multiplying with every passing year. The crisis is compounded by the denial of a rightful income to farmers for their produce. To keep food inflation under control, it is the farmers who have paid the price. In reality, it is the farmers who have been subsidising the nation all these years. Successive governments have therefore deliberately kept agriculture impoverished. An estimated 58% of the farmers go to bed hungry every night.After Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath announced a farm loan waiver worth Rs 36,359 crore, which will benefit 92 lakh small and marginal farmers, Maharashtra announced a loan waiver worth Rs 30,500 crore. Punjab is expected to take over at least Rs 30,000 crore of the bad loans. Though I am not in favour of loan waivers but in a deplorable situation that agriculture has been pushed into, a waiver is a short-term relief.It is an emergency measure to bail out millions of small and marginal farmers in distress. IndiaSpend estimates a total of Rs 3.1 lakh crore of farm loan that needs to be waived. This is still far less than the Rs 4 lakh crore bailout package that the telecom industry alone is seeking. Another Rs 1.7 lakh crore of bad debt is what the steel industry hopes will be written off.Holistic approachLoan waiver must be followed by policies that ensure loans dont pile up again. A tinkering here and there is not going to address the crisis. It needs a holistic approach and a paradigm shift in economic thinking.To begin with:The effort should be to make farming economically viable.The Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices, which works out the MSP for crops, should be directed to factor in four allowances being paid to farmers  house allowance, medical allowance, educational allowance and travel allowance. So far, MSP only covers the cost of production. Government employees get a total of 108 allowances.Since MSP benefits only 6% of the farmers, it needs to be understood that the demand for providing 50% profit over MSP will benefit only these 6% farmers. For the remaining, who are dependent on the exploitative markets, the need is to set up a National Farmers Income Commission, with the mandate to provide a minimum assured monthly income package of Rs 18,000 per farmer family.Public sector investments must come in urgently for constructing Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee mandis and also for storage godowns. At present, there are only 7,700 APMC mandis. What India needs is 42,000 mandis for every 5 km radius. And like in Brazil, where it is mandatory for a market yard to procure anything a farmer brings, APMC mandis should be equipped to do the same.(The writer is a commentator on issues relating to farmers and agriculture)"
5a0510f79855b76bf13bf739,"Agri sector seeking new vigour, fresh leadership",http://www.deccanherald.com/content/618481/agri-sector-seeking-vigour-fresh.html,2017-06-21,"Agri sector seeking new vigour, fresh leadershipDH News Service Jun 21 2017, 2:14 ISTIn January-February, as the election campaigns in Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand were picking up steam, Home Minister Rajnath Singh first broached the topic of farm loan waiver if the BJP came to power. Little had he thought that the issue would gather momentum just five months down the line and force the Narendra Modi government to consider loan waiver for small and marginal farmers.In a way, the demands for farm loan waiver could be BJPs own doing. Maharasthra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, who had been steadfast in his opposition to a loan waiver, admitted that he was forced to announce writing off debts of small and marginal farmers due to immense pressure from the farmers whose expectations had risen manifold following similar moves by Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana.The Congress had already raised the pitch for farm loan waiver with vice president Rahul Gandhi undertaking a month-long kisan yatra across Uttar Pradesh in September last year. Though the yatra did not benefit the Congress politically, it did raise expectations of the farmers. The BJP too responded by mentioning farm loan waiver for small and marginal farmers in its manifesto for Uttar Pradesh.Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in his election rallies, went to the extent of saying that the BJP government in Uttar Pradesh will take a decision on farm loan waiver in its first cabinet meeting. The pressure on the Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath for announcing the loan waiver was telling as he kept delaying the meeting of the cabinet that usually takes place within hours of the new government assuming office. The council of ministers met a couple of times informally as bureaucrats put together proposal for the loan write off for the cabinet to consider in its first meeting.The announcement by the Uttar Pradesh government led to demands for a farm loan waiver from other states such as Maharashtra, Karnataka, Uttarakhand, Tamil Nadu among others. Maharashtra bowed to the demands from farmers and declared a farm loan waiver for needy farmers. The state government put stringent conditions to exclude well-off farmers from the loan waiver scheme to limit its expenditure.As soon as Maharashtra announced its farm loan waiver, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley made it clear that the state government will have to fund the initiative from its own resources and not expect any bailout by the Centre. The Punjab government became the third state to announce a farm loan waiver for small and marginal farmers on June 19, a promise made by the Congress during the poll campaign in the state. In a bid for political one-upmanship, Chief Minister Amarinder Singh also announced loan waiver up to Rs 2 lakh  double than what has been offered by UP and Maharashtra.At the heart of the crisis is absence of remunerative prices for farm produce. In simpler terms, a person dependent only on agriculture as a means of livelihood finds it difficult to make both ends meet as he does not earn enough. As prices of pulses, fruits and vegetables shot up during the past two years due to drought, the government had put in place stringent curbs on exports and stockholding by traders. The same were not eased after a spell of good monsoon led to bumper production.The glut of pulses and onions saw farmers making a beeline to market yards to sell their produce leading to a sharp reduction in procurement prices. In Maharashtra, stagnant milk prices had irked farmers who threw milk on the roads instead of selling it to dairies. In Uttar Pradesh, potato growers threw their produce on roads as wholesale prices dipped on account of better production. Similar was the case with onion growers in Madhya Pradesh.The simmering discontent among farmers in Madhya Pradesh led to protests in Mandsaur where six farmers were killed in police firing on June 6. Things took a political turn as leaders made a beeline to Mandsaur to express solidarity with farmers.Delicate issueIn both Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh, the governments hastily reached out to a section of favourable farmer leaders, agreed to some of their demands and called off the strike. Such handling of a delicate issue further angered the farmers who looked towards leaders such as Shiv Kumar Sharma alias Kakkaji in Madhya Pradesh and Raju Shetti in Maharashtra to take their struggle to a logical conclusion.While Sharma heads the breakaway faction of the RSS-backed Bhartiya Kisan Sangh, Shetti leads the Swabhimani Shetkari Sangathan in Maharashtra. Sharma was thrown out of the BKS following his frequent run-ins with Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan. Shetti, a Lok Sabha member from Hatkanangale near Kolhapur, is part of the NDA but is increasingly disillusioned with Prime Minister Narendra Modis farm policies.Shetti believes that Modi has lost the script when it came to tackling the agrarian distress as the government, instead of addressing pressing issues such as remunerative prices, was busy pursuing soil health cards. His consistent demand  Modi should fulfil the poll promise of implementing the M S Swaminathan Committee Report that has recommended a 50% margin over the cost of cultivation incurred by the farmers.Farmers were already operating on thin margins, which have dipped even further over the last three years. The poll promise on MSP has remained just that  a promise, with neither the agriculture minister nor the prime minister making any reference to it. The much-touted agri-market reforms too have floundered and so has the flagship programme to provide irrigation facilities to every farm. As many as 23 of the 99 delayed irrigation projects were to be completed by March 2017. The government has missed the deadline.On the political front, the strain on the NDA is showing. Modi had run a tight ship since coming to power in 2014, but allies such as Shiv Sena and Shettis Swabhiman Paksha have been growing restless and have raised a banner of revolt. The agriculture sector is desperately seeking new vigour and fresh leadership to pull it out of the crisis."

Gurmukh Singh, 44, is one of better-to-do farmers of Pandrali, a quiet, well-groomed village in Fatehgarh Sahib district with several newly-built houses, smooth streets and girls on scooters. Its a picture that could well be captioned prosperous Punjab. But the genteel faade hides the struggles of the states farming community.I am a farmer, have never done anything else, but its not sustainable any longer, Gurmukh clears his throat. A former village head, he is clearly uneasy about sharing his troubles with strangers. The price of potato, the crop he grew on part of the land hes leased, has crashed. It means more debt for he has to pay a rent of Rs 40,000 for an acre though his potato crop has fetched him only Rs 25,000. This is what happens when you diversify, he fumes.This week, the Punjab government announced a waiver of crop loans up to Rs 2 lakh for small and marginal farmers (up to five acres). Gurmukh is relieved that he falls in this bracket but wishes the government had announced a complete loan waiver. I know the state has limited funds, but the Centre should rescue farmers, he opines.Like most farmers in the state, this matriculate grows wheat and paddy, the two crops with a guaranteed minimum support price (MSP). Paddy has leached the land of water leading to fears of desertificationthe water table at Pandrali has breached 70 feet, and is falling at the rate of three feet a yearyet farmers refuse to grow other crops. I have tried turmeric, sugarcane, maize and vegetables, but marketing is a problem. The sugarcane mills dont pay us for months and prices of other crops are erratic, explains Gurmukh.RISING COST OF PRODUCTIONBut now even the MSP of the two main crops, he rues, is becoming unviable due to the spiralling cost of inputs. Its simple maths. In 1992, says Gurmukh, diesel cost Rs 4-5 a litre, a sack of diammonium phosphate (DAP) Rs 200, while wheat cost Rs 5 a kilo. Now while diesel is pegged at Rs 58 a litre and DAP is 1100 for a sack, but wheat has failed to keep pace at Rs 16 a kilo. Add to it the cost of boring tubewells every year due to the dipping water level, the steeply priced pesticides scarcely used in the past, and the cost of labour from UP and Bihar in the absence of local helping hands, says Gurmukh, explaining the high cost of production. A bore costs anywhere between Rs 10,000 and 1 lakh.Watch | Farmers have to borrow money to farmGroundwater irrigates over 73% of land in the state. This has led to a sharp decline in the water table. According to the Central Ground Water Board, of the 138 administrative blocks in Punjab, 110 blocks are overexploited, four are critical and two are semi-critical. Only 22 blocks are safe, but they have other problems such as arsenic, fluoride and uranium contamination.One reason for the indiscriminate use of groundwater is free electricity for farmers introduced in 1999. Also, the Punjab government hasnt placed any restriction on the depth of tubewells. Nor does one need any permission to dig up a well.Inadequate rainfall in the last few years is only increasing the general dependence on groundwater. The year 2014 was very rough on us, so was 2015, recounts Gurmukh. In 2015, Punjab received only 50% of the monsoon rainfall, and the next year it was 36%.Little wonder then that any mention of digging up Satluj Yamuna Link (SYL) canal to provide water to Haryana raises hackles. The Bhakra canal flows 1.5 km from here; the Sirhind feeder and Narwana branch are also close but all the water flows to Haryana and Rajasthan, gripes a friend of Gurmukh.Haryana, he claims, also has the job advantage as it borders both Chandigarh and Delhi. They have benefited from industrialisation and the Gurgaon boom, says Gurmukh, adding how a working man drawing a salary of 35,000 a month is better off than a farmer who owns 10 acres.Haryana also offers a better market price for alternative crops such as sunflower. It fetches Rs 25,000 per quintal in Punjab while in Haryana it gets Rs 35,000, says Gurmukh.Watch | Why are Indias farmers seething with anger?The crop prices show no signs of increasing but land rental rates are going through the roof and range between 40,000 and 45,000 an acre in the district. With farming becoming unviable, more and more small farmers are leasing out their land instead of toiling on it. These landlords seek a rise of 10% every year regardless of any natural calamity or price crash, grouses Gurmukh. He recalls 2015 when he was forced to sell his export-grade Basmati (PB 1509) to the Food Corporation of India after the prices crashed from Rs 4,500 a quintal in 2014 to 1700 in 2015.Ask Gurmukh why he takes so much land on lease, and he points to his machinery. I have a tractor, a seed sower, a land leveler, a roller et al. I need land to make the most of them. Also, there is the lure of a good crop and the pressure of repaying the debt.Demonetisation dealt a heavy blow to Gurmukh who wanted to repay a crop loan. I had just sold my crop and deposited two lakh in my bank but I could only withdraw 5,000 a week. Somehow the little sums of money I took out were spent elsewhere while the interest on my loan piled up.Gurmukh Singh with daughter Gurpreet Kaur and wife Ranjeet Kaur in his House in Pandriali village in Sirhind district, Punjab. (Ravi Kumar/HT Photo)THE DEBT TRAPIn 2007, Gurmukh took a loan of Rs 5 lakh to build his house. While the house loan was from a bank, most of his other loans are from commission agents (arhtiya or the middlemen) who charge a higher rate of interest than banks. But Gurmukh appears resigned to working with them. Here is the reason: In Punjab, a farmer cannot sell his produce in the open market at the prevailing price. He can only sell it to commission agents under the Agriculture Produce Marketing Act, 1961. A few days back, the Congress government passed an amendment to the act, allowing private players to set up mandis to purchase farm produce. But Gurmukh is yet to learn about it.As of now, the middleman also doubles up as a dealer of seeds, pesticides, and fertilisers. So farmers not only sell their produce to him, but also purchase their inputs from him, often on credit.Milked dry Farmers in the grain bowl of the country, Punjab, are a distressed lot Rs 69,335 crore Rural debt Rs 5.5 lakh Per capita rural household debt 98% Area under irrigation 110 out of 138 blocks are water dark zones (water table dangerously low) 1.6% Rate of agri growth in Punjab from 2004-05 to 2014-15 1.5% Punjabs share of Indias total area FARMER SUICIDES6,926 No. of suicides between 2000 and 2011*1,309 Farm suicides in seven districts between April 2013 and Dec 2016No. of suicides between 2000 and 2011*Farm suicides in seven districts between April 2013 and Dec 2016Despite being a farmers daughter and wife, Ranjeet doesnt think highly of farming. No one values the farmer, she says.The couples only offspring, Gurpreet, who is doing post-graduation in English from a college in Fatehgarh Sahib, is now looking forward to a bank tellers course. The young woman, who stitches her clothes herself, may not be sure about her career path, but she is clear that her husband will not be a farmer. No way, she declares. Its too risky. No matter how hard you work, there is no guarantee of profit.Youngsters in the village, she claims, want to either get a job or go abroad. Farming is an option only for the uneducated.Jagtar Singh, Gurmukhs man Friday who works on his land for Rs 1 lakh a year, agrees. In farming, you throw money for six months and then dont know whether you will get it back or not. A salaried job is better.The only person who appears contented in the fields is Harendra Kumar from Motihari district in Bihar, who is here with his team of 10 labourers. We will sow paddy, he explains as he arranges ladoos for a pooja before they begin work. He explains, We pray for a bumper crop, our wellbeing and that of sardar ji.Amen to that."

Farmers also questioned work done in both states on rain water harvesting and ground water recharge. Sukhdev Singh Kokri Kalan, general secretary of Bharti Kisan Union (Ugrahan), said, Nearly 28 per cent of Punjab is irrigated by canal water, while rest of the area is irrigated by ground water. It is strange that political parties in Punjab as well as Haryana shout a lot about this issue, but none talks about efforts to recharge ground water and rain water which are the main source of irrigation.Accusing parties of double speak, he added: paddy cultivation is a major contributor (to water shortage). However, farmers were given free demonstrations, seeds etc during green revolution to grow paddy, and now it has affected ground water. But all talk is about SYL causing water shortage. So in a way, it is double speak by political parties to cause tension among farmers of Haryana and Punjab. He went on to say that the his union believed that Haryana can be given little more water than the existing share from the already flowing canals and hence there is no need for SYL.However, Buta Singh Burjgill, president of Bharti Kisan Union (Dakaunda), disagreed. Punjab is short of water and we cannot share even a drop of water with the neighbouring state. We agree with this statement of Punjab political parties. However, they need to work on ways to reduce this water shortage.We are ready to shift to basmati crop which needs 25 per cent of the water needed by paddy crop and at the same time, we can also grow potato in between. However, we need MSP for both crops so as to switch. This will solve Punjabs water shortage and even the water war can be solved.He too said that SYL issue was being used to make farmers in both states fight among each other. Shingaara Singh Maan, president of BKU(Ugrahan) added, At the moment talk is about 28 per cent canal water and not about 72 per cent of ground water as source of irrigation.

He said small and marginal traders were never subjected to tax before.According to him, the imposition of GST on the sector will make it uncompetitive.CPI(M) leader C P Narayanan demanded that items relating to the disabled people should removed from the GST net.Another CPI(M) member Ritabrata Banerjee spoke about the complexities in the new indirect tax regime which came into force from July 1.Rajeev Shukla of Congress said there was lack of coordination between the Centre and the states on the implementation of GST.Besides the problems facing the textile sector, members also raised issues relating to the floods in Assam and Odisha and farmers' problems.Digvijaya Singh of Congress said the condition of farmers was worsening and farmers' suicides have increased by 42 per cent during the NDA rule.He particularly highlighted the fall in prices of pulses, potato and onion. He has also sought a detailed discussion on the farmers issue.Raising the issue of floods in Assam, Congress member Sanjay Sinh demanded that the government should start relief measures on a war-footing and announce a package after assessing the damage.His party colleague Ripun Bora criticised the BJP-led state government saying it has not prepared any contingency plan for tackling the floods.BJD member Dilip Tirkey demanded special relief package for people affected by floods in certain districts of Odisha, including Kalahandi.Naresh Agrawal (SP) expressed concern over ""vulgar"" and misleading advertisments being aired on television channels.He said there should be regulations to check such advertisements to protect consumer interest.Veteran Congress leader Motilal Vora asked the government to construct good roads along the Indo-Pak border in Punjab saying these were in very bad condition.Another Congress member Viplove Thakur highlighted the plight of women, allegedly being brought to Haryana from different parts of the country for marriage as the state's sex ratio was bad.She demanded that the government should take steps on the issue seriously.Deputy Chairman P J Kurien asked Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs M A Naqvi to take note of it."

They were joined by farmers from U.P., Tamil Nadu and Punjab.Shiv Kumar Pushpakar, ReutersI wish no parent does what my father did to me. At least think about your children before you decide to end your life, said 13-year-old Pallavi Pawar with an unmoved expression on her face and resolve in her voice.It was around a decade ago that Pallavis father, a farmer in Maharashtras Jalgaon, decided to commit suicide, leaving behind his wife and four children. Ever since, Pallavis mother has been working on other farms to make ends meet.Memories flash byI dont remember his face clearly, but there are moments that flash before my eyes. There are memories I have of my father when he was happy, when he didnt show the turmoil brewing inside him. Looking at my mother and sisters today, I think he should have discussed things with his family. There is always a way out, she said.Pallavi was one of the over 40 children and widows of farmers from drought-hit Maharashtra who had gathered at Jantar Mantar on Wednesday. They had joined the ongoing Kisan Mukti Yatra, as part of which farmers have demanded loan waivers and fixing of standard prices for their produce.Children dressed in white narrated tales of personal grief as placards reading Suicide is not the answer, Save our farmers, Farmers, dont commit suicide stood tall.The stories of these families were a grim reminder of how farmer suicides in India might just be numbers for city dwellers, but are harsh reality for children and women living in the rural belt  something they see almost everyday because of government apathy.Dont bargainWhen you buy vegetables and fruits from a farmer, you are quick to bargain for even Rs. 1. What you dont realise is that this Rs. 1 can be the difference between his children eating dinner or going to bed hungry, said Pallavi as she broke down.She continued, You will never know how much the heart of a father pains when he has to disappoint his children everyday; till one day he cannot bear it any longer and decides to end everything.Many such children who have lost their fathers stay at an ashram in Nashik, away from their homes, because their families cannot afford their upbringing.Little did three-year-old Sanju, who was guarding an earthen pot covered with a red cloth and playing with other children around, realise that the pot contained the ashes of his father who had hung himself two weeks ago after local money lenders started threatening him to repay a loan of Rs. 50, 000.Farming is riskySanjus uncle Raghu Ram, who was accompanying him, said that he was too young to realise the gravity of the loss. He couldnt help but point out how Sanjus entire life would be affected by the death of his father, who was the sole breadwinner for their family of eight.Farming is becoming a risky job. We do not want our children to live the lives that we are living. The government should think about the children and their future and do something to save our lives, he added.Eight-year-old Hari from Solapur said that he wants to be an engineer and help his mother escape the life of poverty.My mother tells me that if I study well I can help our family build a big house and buy a car, he said.Farmers from Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Punjab had also joined the protest with sacks of potatoes, demanding fair prices for their produce.We make a profit of Rs. 5 after selling a sack of potatoes. How can we feed our families and afford a basic living with this? The government wants us to store our produce, but the cost of storing is much higher than the return, said Amir, who was leading the potato farmers from Uttar Pradesh.Former CM presentFormer Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh Digvijay Singh, who was also present at the protest, expressed his support for the farmers and their demands of remunerative crop prices and debt-free farming.

Under the scheme, the premium to be paid by farmers is kept low and the claims are fully settled.Responding to a question in the Rajya Sabha, Singh said the settlement of claims during the two years preceding 2016-17 remained higher because of bad weather (drought). But claims in 2016-17 were less on account of good rains.""If States feel they are burdened to pay their share of premium to private insurers (during good monsoon period when claims are normally less), then we have asked them to set up their own insurance firms to implement the scheme,"" he said, adding that Punjab and Gujarat have evinced interest in this.Replying to another query on the coverage of the PMFBY, the Minister said efforts were being made to bring more farmers under the scheme. Earlier, only loanee farmers were eligible for the crop insurance, now non-loanee farmers are also allowed. Last year, the crop insurance coverage was 30 per cent and it will be increased to 40 per cent this year, he added.Replying to another question on action taken to improve farmers' plight and reduce the number of farmers' suicide, the Minister said the government has revamped the old farm schemes and launched some new initiatives to reduce the cost of production and increase income.Admitting that farmers are in distress because of good production year, the Minister said the government is lending support to farmers through various market interventions to ensure support price to their produce. Farm produce like tur and potato are being procured under the central schemes -- Price Support Scheme (PPS) and the Price Stablisation Fund (PSF) to protect the interest of farmers, he added."

Farmers are unable to reap the benefits and consumers are feeling the pinch.As farmers cant sit for an entire day in the market to sell their produce, they sell the harvest in wholesale market at a price demanded by the middlemen.Middlemen get a maximum of 70% and minimum of 50% profit for the tomatoes brought by farmers. Seeing the demand for tomatoes, middlemen and retailers have hiked the prices. Few farmers said middlemen decide the price to a large extent.We toil in fields but the profits are taken away by others. As tomatoes cant be kept for more than three days, we have to sell it at the best available price, said a farmer in Dharwad.We sell a basket of 8kg tomatoes for about `350-`450. We also have to pay for transportation and labour charges. But in the retail market, the same tomato is being sold at `100 per kg. We sell tomatoes to middlemen as they take the entire quantity at one go, he added.Horticulture Department deputy director S B Diddimani said, Vegetable prices go up every year. But this year, the prices have gone too high. They may come down and get stabilised in another 15 days.Scarcity of rain and decrease in sowing areas are the reasons for price hike. Once tomatoes from districts like Belagavi and Kolar start arriving in the city market, the burden of price hike will be eased, he added.The middlemen at the APMC yard say they are blamed whenever the prices go up. Many retailers buy produce on credit. We pay labour charges to distribute the vegetables.

Moreover, the growing area of potato by small and medium farmers has been drastically decreased from 61,000 hectares to 10,087 in 10 years. Statistics available with Express show that small farmers who cultivate on less than five acres have switched over to alternative crops like maize and ginger due to crop loss. On the other hand, the farmers who are cultivating on more than five acres have leased out their land to Ginger growers. Horticulture officials are anxious as the certified seeds supplied by the department in 1,266 hectares were damaged due to dry spell.

The changing climate is also expected to experience negative impact on milk production in the region, predicts the parliamentary standing committee on agriculture in its report tabled in the Lok Sabha on Thursday.The report says that the climate change would surge production of potato in Punjab, Haryana and western and central Uttar Pradesh by 3.46% to 7.11% by 2030, but in rest of India potato production may decline by 4% to 16%.The 31-member committee, headed by Bihar MP and former Union minister of state Hukumdev Narayan Yadav of BJP, also submitted that irrigated rice in north-west India comprising Haryana and Punjab is projected to reduce by 6% to 8% by 2020. Whereas in other parts of the country the loss would be below 5%.Northern India, including Punjab and Haryana, is expected to experience more negative impact of climate change on milk production, the committee has found. It would be higher in crossbreds (0.63%) followed by buffaloes (0.5%) and indigenous cattle (0.4%).The committee noted that studies indicate that changing climate will decrease yields in major crops like wheat, rice and maize. On the other hand, the impact could be neutral to positive in crops like groundnut, soybean and chickpea. More number of generations of insect pests are expected to occur during future climate change periods because of increased temperatures. The committee found that more intense droughts are mainly observed over north and northwest India.The report says that in 2050, it is estimated that maximum and minimum temperature will go up by 2.40 degrees Celsius and 40 degrees C, respectively. Southern peninsula, northwest India and the southern parts of Punjab, Haryana and Bihar will be the severely affected due to the rise of minimum temperature. Apart from this, large shift in monsoon months, reduction in number of rainy days, increase in rain intensity and high frequency of cyclone would further aggravate the problems of agrarians.The committee was also of the considered view that policy of minimum support price (MSP) is promoting farming practices which are not suitable to local biographical and climatic conditions, thereby, causing problems such as depletion of groundwater resources, degradation of soil, and loss of local biodiversity. The report says that absence of an alternative and economically remunerative cropping strategy is forcing farmers to opt for prevailing water-intensive cropping pattern.It has also come to fore that paddy fields and Rumen fermentation are major sources of greenhouse gases (GHGs) in farm sector. ""Studies showed average methane emission of 40-70 kg/ha from rain-fed rice field and 100-180 kg/ha from irrigated rice fields. The nitrous oxide (N2O) emission having high global warming potential ranged 0.6-0.9 kg/ha under lowland irrigated conditions,"" reads the report.The report reads, ""However, the committee is distressed to note that despite efforts being made by the government, private sector dominates in seed production contributing to 50-57% of total seed production of the country. The main focus of private seed companies has been on the high-value and low-volume seeds.""The committee also noted that groundwater level has been decreasing in Punjab. With declining water table, farmers are deepening existing bore wells and shifting from cheaper surface mounted centrifugal pumps to expensive submersible pumps. This is increasing the cost of pumping in the agriculture sector. The report says that the quality of groundwater deteriorates with excess groundwater exploitation due to accelerated diffusion of contaminants from industrial and urban effluents to the groundwater."

Since agriculture makes up roughly 15% of India's GDP, a 4.5 to 9.0% negative impact on production implies cost of climate change to be roughly at 1.5% of GDP per year,"" reads the report.The committee said that various studies indicated overall reduction in productivity by 4-6% in rice, 6% in wheat, 18% in maize, 2.5% in sorghum, 2% in mustard and 2.5% in potato besides significant regional variability. Also, the committee has projected production deficit of 33% for cereals by 2015 and of 43% by 2050. Meanwhile, for pulses, the deficit has been projected at 3% by 2025 and 7% by 2050.Consequently, the committee has suggested that enhancing agricultural productivity is critical for ensuring food and nutritional security for all, particularly poor, small and marginal farmers who would be affected the most.Further, the committee found that the total post-harvest losses to agricultural commodities are estimated to be from 6 to 18% and nearly 30% of the agricultural produce harvested is lost due to inadequate storage facilities in the country, including in Punjab and Haryana.On over exploitation of ground water, the committee found that the Central Ground Water Board ( CGWB ) has submitted plan for artificial recharge in 442 over exploited ground water blocks in Punjab, Harayana, Andhra Pradesh , Karnataka, Maharashtra, Rajasthan,Tamilnadu, Telangana and Uttar Pradesh.The report says that as per the ministry of earth sciences, during the period 1901-2010, heavy rainfall events (rainfall exceeding 15 cm in 24 hours) over northern parts of the country show an increasing trend of about 6% per decade. Also, as per 5th IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) report, climate projections developed for India for the 2050s indicate an increase in the average temperature by 2-4C during that period, an overall decrease in rainy days by more than 15 days in western and central India and an increase by 5-10 days near foothills of Himalayas and north-east India.The IPCC has also analyzed that there has been a decrease in rainfall in the month of July but there has been an increase in rains in June as well as August across the country indicating a change in the rainfall pattern.The committee observed that animal husbandry and cattle rearing are important source of income for majority of farmers in Punjab, Haryana and other parts of the country.However, it expressed that national plan on dairying has ignored indigenous varieties of cattle leading to over dependence on crossbred varieties for milk production despite the fact that indigenous varieties of cattle possess many traits such as heat tolerance that can be very effective in future scenario projected for climate change.Mainly focusing on climate change effect on agriculture, the committee was of the view that there will be changes in consumption patterns in coming decades due to increasing rate of urbanization and increased income of households. It has been found that demand for fruits, vegetables, dairy products, meat, poultry and fisheries will increase at faster rate than that of food grains. The need for a climate-resilient approach to agriculture is critical for India where more than 80 percent agriculturists are small farmers and the warming trend in India over the past 100 years has indicated an increase of 0.60C, says the report."
5a0f51649855b76bf13d7e3f,are vegetable prices soaring?,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/are-vegetable-prices-soaring/article19527329.ece,2017-08-20,"What happened in July?July saw a rise in inflation at the wholesale level to 1.88% from 0.9% in June, with the spiralling tomato prices, along with other food items, contributing significantly to this rise. Tomatoes saw a sharp inflation of over 209.5% in July against contraction of 29.4% in June, according to data from the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy. Brinjal registered a rise in inflation to 21.1% in July, from Junes contraction of 3.1%. The prices of tomato, onion and potato have increased in recent months owing to disparity between demand and supply on account of a drop in production because of unfavourable weather, a rise in transport costs, seasonality and supply chain constraints.Why is supply low?While the rise in the retail prices of tomato is being associated with low supply from key growing States, including Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh and Karnataka following heavy rain in a few regions that damaged the crop and hindered transport as well, onion prices have seen a rise on account of low supply from the southern States.The fluctuation in vegetable prices, which is commonly referred to as seasonal, is associated with the economics of demand and supply. The Centre maintains that seasonal fluctuations in market arrivals have hit supplies. The other reasons for the fall in supply are adverse weather conditions and imperfections in marketing channels. However, the clash of interests between the consumer, the producer and the middlemen is a key factor that policy-makers must urgently address.Where is the problem?For years, the consumer, the producer (farmer) and the middleman have had a clash of interest when it comes to agricultural commodities. While the consumer wants to buy a commodity at the lowest price, the producer (farmer) desires to sell the produce at the maximum price. The middleman, on the other hand, wants to maximise profits. Striking a balance among these stakeholders could possibly address the issue of price fluctuation to some extent. Vegetable producers, especially small landholders, depend on intermediaries to sell their produce. As vegetables find their way to the market, the cost of packaging, grading, transporting and fees, besides the margins of the middlemen, are some of the elements that determine the final price the consumer has to bear.Will better storage help?Agricultural commodities with a short shelf-life are prone to price fluctuation and hence require better infrastructure for marketing.Economists like Prof. M.S. Sidhu at Punjab Agricultural University believe that improved transport and upgraded storage infrastructure will keep a check on price volatility. Indias cold storage capacity at present is nearly 3.5 crore tonnes, which is short by 30-40 lakh tonnes, and it needs to be increased. Besides, cold storages need to be upgraded, equipping them to store fruit and vegetables at right temperatures so that they stay fresh.Also, the high cost of transport needs to be addressed. In the case of perishable vegetables, the government could consider promoting low-cost refrigerated trucks and weigh the option of freight subsidy.According to an estimate, there are 7,000-8,000 refrigerated trucks plying in India, mostly transporting pharmaceuticals and dairy products. Transport of perishable vegetables in refrigerated trucks could be one of the options that would help in better supply and availability of the produce.What about the supply chain?The mismanagement in the supply chain is another reason for the huge gap in prices that growers sell perishable agricultural commodities for and what the consumer pays. Creation of co-operative groups and societies are probably an alternative that could assist in minimising the marketing channel. They can work in tandem across the States and supply vegetables from surplus regions to places where the produce is in demand.Most farmers in India have small landholdings. Nearly 85% farmers are small, who have less than 2 hectares. Cultivation has become unviable for these small farmers, but through cooperative groups and societies even a small quantity of crop produced by the farmer can be marketed. This will stabilise prices and benefit consumers.VIKAS VASUDEVA"

""Our total production, harting and storing costs are vesting and storing costs are Rs 10 per kg but in the wholesale market our produce is getting just Rs 1.50 per kg or even less,"" said JPGA members Raghbir Singh, Jaswinder Singh Sangha and Iqbal Singh Chattha.""Potato is selling at Rs 30-40 per kg in Pakistan and if the Union government allows trading with the neighbouring country , it can bring a big relief to the farmers here,"" they said.Potatoes were being exported to Pakistan till two years back but then Indian government stopped that.""Now Pakistan has also waived off duties on potato imports and this opportunity can be used in favour of Indian potato growers,"" they said.""Our season to sell our produce to traders from other states started in November last year during demonetisation when there were no buyers in the marke,"" they said."

There are hardly any buyers for our crop. Since demonetisation, traders are facing cash crunch, resulting in drop of bulk orders from big markets like Delhi and other major cities, Jaswinder Singh Sangha, general secretary, Jalandhar Potato Growers Association, told The Hindu.He said that potato growers have kept the eatables and seed potatoes in cold storage since the last crop season in anticipation of selling the produce at a better price later.But now there are fewer buyers and poor prices. The crop is still lying and now when the new season crop will hit the market (in next few months) the loss of growers would only aggravate, he added.Facing hardships due to demonetisation, the potato seed growers from Punjab have demanded an immediate freight subsidy so that the growers can transport their crop to other States and fetch some returns.Also, the growers have urged the State government to waive crop loans of potato growers besides asking the State agencies to intervene and generate markets at the national and international level.Punjab produces quality potato seed, which is distributed across the country including West Bengal, Gujarat, Karnataka, UP , MP and Odisha. Potato seed is usually supplied from last week of October to mid-December every year."

The late rains will benefit planting of rabi crops such as wheat and chana, Pattanayak said on Thursday.""We are expecting a very good rabi season, so that should make up for all the minuses which has been ascribed for kharif,"" he said. The season's total rainfall for the country is 5% below normal, but it will not make any impact on planting that will begin in a fortnight, he said.Most parts of northwest and central India received deficit rainfall, but farmers in Punjab and Haryana have access to canal irrigation that helps them plant even if rainfall is scanty.Pattanayak attributed his confidence on rabi harvest to an extended monsoon. ""It (Monsoon) is now in withdrawal phase but still not complete, as we are expecting four days of very good rain in some parts of south India,"" he said. ""That is the region where rainfall has been deficit."" A drought assessment report prepared by Mahalanobis Crop Forecast Centre under the agriculture ministry had said that as of August end more than 225 districts in 17 states had less than normal rainfall.Pattanayak, however, said, ""We have to read Mahalanobis data with actual field situation to get a clear picture.""He said the 5% deficit in monsoon rains for the season would not make any impact on food security and food production. ""The occasional dip in vegetables will be there depending on local and seasonal condition, but we are quite comfortable in onion and potato production,"" Pattanayak said.Mahalanobis data is largely dependent on satellite-based remote sensing indices, rainfall data, soil moisture estimates, crop sown area and irrigation statistics, which are used for drought warning and assessment.""We are in a very good position as far as agriculture sector is concerned, contrary to the popular impression that is being carried out that we had a deficit rainfall,"" Pattanayak said. ""This monsoon, deficit has been only 5% for the country and in parts  south peninsular, north-west and central MP  it has been more than 5%.

Be it child birth, marriage, festival or death, a set of special dishes are served in a thali. Over the years, it has become an essential part of every occasion. The salivary glands know the usual suspects and start working beforehand. But with changing demographies and increasing demand to consume cuisines of different cultures, thali is losing its purity and original charm. An element of shock and awe has crept into the ritual.Now Chef Kunal Kapur is rediscovering these traditional thalis through Utsav: Thalis of India on Living Foodz channel. Thali is unique to Indian cuisines and is found nowhere in the world. The bigger purpose of serving a thali is to have a complete nutritious and wholesome meal including vegetables, lentils, dry and gravy dishes. It is aesthetic and pleasing because of the play of colours and textures, says Kapur during a conversation in Delhi. Excerpts:What prompted you to take this journey?It is about discovering people, culture, food and beliefs through thalis. Usually they are associated with taglines like Punjabi or Gujarati, vegetarian or non-vegetarian with the word unlimited added to them. That is not what is being explored. What we are discovering are thalis, typically done in various communities, on special occasions and festivals like Holi, Deepavali It endeavours to explain what goes into making a thali and why only certain dishes make the cut .What would be special for Deepavali?On Deepavali, a typical baniya thali will serve lots of sweets  five to six varieties like ghiye ki burfi, pista ki lauj and a number of snacks like chaat, samosas, kachoris. In the main menu, dals and mooli ke kofte are served. The number of sweets in the thali reflect the social status of the family.A Punjabi thali on Deepavali will be sumptuous and vegetarian with many dishes prepared with potato and badis and will include parantha and kulchas, and kheer for dessert.What do thalis tell us about a particular culture or community?Somewhere the thali stands for nutrition, at other places signifying a belief and for some it has medicinal value. The Chettiar community were predominantly vegetarian. Being traders they travelled a lot, specially to South East Asia and over a period they started eating meat. So the Chettinad thali has non-vegetarian dishes and has a lot of spices from that region like kalpasi which is found in Malaysia and Thailand.Thalis tell us about the belief of the people. Varanasi thali is satvik without onions and garlic and is prepared fresh and has no canned ingredients. It is not too spicy and neither tamsik nor rajsik, nor heavy to ensure that it does not make one lazy or aggressive. The spirituality of the city comes through this thali.The Bodo thali is simple comprising local produce like pork and rice. It includes jute leaves which is more bitter than karela. The reason for its inclusion is the geography of the place. Thick with vegetation, people face lot of insect bites and are prone to become sick. So their thali includes ingredients with medicinal properties like jute leaves. Likewise, the Malwani thali has a strong presence of seafood because of the regions proximity to sea.How are thalis associated with places of worship?The belief system of a community flows into its food. In Udupi, there is a Krishna math and all Udupi residents are Krishna bhakts. They are strict vegetarians. No one is allowed inside the math kitchen. While everyone is served in a plate there, devotees seeking a favour from the deity are served food on ground. They eat like this, till their wish is granted.Are thalis under threat?As we are moving ahead, lots of our dishes are dying away, like pickles. Thalis too are vanishing as it is difficult to procure and prepare with most opting for what is offered by eateries. The show is trying to bring about an awareness regarding thalis and documenting them for future research and study. It definitely adds to ones knowledge. I did not know that in a Kashmiri Pandit thali no garlic or onion is used yet it has meat dishes.As a reputed chef, what are your takeaways from this journey?I have added vastly to my knowledge about local and regional cuisines. In Udupi, I tasted mattu gulla huli. It is sambar made out of green brinjals which comes from a particular village in the region, Mattu. It was tasty and the brinjal which had soaked the entire flavour of sambar did not disintegrate.I learnt how to make rice beer in Bodo which is consumed by men and women after a certain age. Since their thali has beer, it has no desserts. I had never heard of bichhu booty ka saag. A local saag grown in Kumaon, its leaves have a lot of thorns and sting like a scorpions bite. Made with care, it tastes out of the world.I discovered new styles of cooking. A small community called Pathare Prabhu in Maharashtra uses thande tel ka tadka for pomfret fish dish. This entails using oil along with other condiments but it is not heated. What is unique about them, is that there is no restaurant serving their food. Interestingly, they prepare and serve thalis with eight to 20 items, and is high on seafood on festivals and when the son-in-law is visiting their home. All this learning has become part of my kitchen vocabulary. I will take elements from these and tweak my dishes accordingly. I found rosella leaves or gongura grow in plenty in the north east and it can be used as salad leaves.(The show airs every Monday and Tuesday at 8 p.m.)Somewhere the thali stands for nutrition, at other places signifying a belief and for some it has medicinal value"

Officials say the calendar has changed. Earlier, the yearly report card used to be presented in November because Nitish Kumar's government took oath in November (even the Grand Alliance government). ""Now it will be in July because the NDA II government took oath in July after the collapse of the Grand Alliance government,"" said an official wondering if Nitish wants to disown his tenure in the Grand Alliance government. Nitish started the tradition of releasing an annual report card first in 2006 when he completed a year in power with the BJP. But last year the function to release a report card was cancelled in view of a train accident in Uttar Pradesh.Missing in action RJD chief Lalu Prasad talked about huge dharnas across the state against demonetisation on November 8. But on November 8, both Lalu and his son Tejashwi remained at home, as RJD and Congress leaders protested at Gandhi Maidan. ""The two biggest faces in the RJD abstained from their own party's function. Laluji might have received information that the size of crowds was not what he had expected. That's why he went off to Hajipur,"" said a BJP leader gleefully. RJD leaders in Patna are fuming. ""State party president Ram Chandra Purbey does not have the appeal to draw crowds like Lalu and Tejashwi can,"" said a senior RJD leader, insisting that the two should have participated in the event.The astrologer case After astrologer Shankar Charan Tripathi's appointment as national spokesperson of the RJD, some newspapers highlighted his ""murky"" past, giving JDU leaders a chance to attack the RJD. The development frustrated RJD leaders one of who even cribbed before a friend in the BJP how Lalu was making appointments in the party without knowing the person's background. The BJP leader told him that the same astrologer had been lobbying to enter the BJP for the past eight months but was dropped like a hot potato when the party got to know of his background. An old-timer recalled how Lalu had once called a press meet to say central agency officials were harassing RJD workers from Punjab. ""But those workers later turned out to be narcotic smugglers,"" the RJD leader said.Isolated After releasing Tejashwi Yadav's photograph with a girl, JDU spokesperson Sanjay Singh finds himself isolated, even within his own party. While BJP leader C.P. Thakur and Madhepura MP Pappu Yadav disapproved of the act, senior JDU minister Shrawan Kumar expressed his ignorance about it. ""Shrawan is very close to chief minister Nitish Kumar and there is an attempt by the JDU to show as if Nitish was ignorant of what his spokesperson did,"" said an RJD leader."

The notun aloo selling in the retail market now at Rs 25-30 a kilo are those from Punjab and Uttar Pradesh.Potato grower Chandranath Jana from Bankuras Jaipur said: I took a loan of Rs 10,000 from the rural cooperative to cultivate the tuber on a bigha (one-third acre) of land. The saplings have now all gone under water. The cooperative wont sanction loans unless I repay the earlier one and I now have to borrow from elsewhere to sow the seeds.A rough calculation of the input costs (seeds and fertilizer) and labour shows that a farmer needs Rs 10,000-12,000 per bigha to grow the tuber  costlier than sowing paddy. Yet, farmers took the potato route after incurring loss in the aman paddy because a substantial part of the crop was wasted while harvesting during the downpour. The damage of the early variety of potato will affect the sowing of the regular variety, particularly in the areas of Chandrakona and Garbeta in West Midnapore, Jaipur, Sonamukhi and Bishnupur in Bankura, and Jabalpur and Kalna in Burdwan.However, these are only a portion of the areas that cultivate the early variety. Many farmers in Hooghly and Howrahs Udaynarayanpur didnt go for the early variety sowing after the November rain. The untimely rain has damaged the crop in parts of the entire 4.25 lakh hectares. It didnt have any major effect in Hooghly, which alone produces one-third of the crop. However, the sudden rise in minimum temperature will delay the sowing of the regular variety (jyoti). If it persists, the total acreage of the tuber may fall by 25,000-40,000 hectares this season. Potato needs the chill by December-January for better productivity, said Pradip Majumdar, agro-expert and adviser to the chief minister.The saving grace for consumers is the 17.5 lakh tonnes of potato available in cold storages that can feed Bengal of 5 lakh tonnes a month for the next three months, till the new crop arrives in March. Patitpaban De of the West Bengal Cold Storage Owners Association said the monthly output from Bengal was 7 lakh tonnes. Des claim puts a question mark on the steady supply from cold storages till March, leaving a gap of 15 to 20 days in February when people wont buy the last lot of the stored tuber while the new crop will take some more time to reach the market. Potato, thus, may get expensive for a fortnight at the end of February. But Bengal farmers wont be able to make the fast money. Instead, potato traders from Jalandhar and Amritsar in Punjab, and Farukabad and Agra in Uttar Pradesh are likely to take advantage of the supply crunch."

The MoU was signed by PEC director Prof Manoj K Arora and Agendra Kumar , president, ESRI India at PEC.The MoU aims at supporting government programs like smart cities, digital India and Clean Ganga, among others. Apart from the project and consultancy, the collaboration will work towards capacity building for geospatial technology. It also supports the vision and mission of PEC to become a centre of excellence in technical education and research.The future lies in the study of geospatial data. Due to unavailability of the expertise in the relevant field, the need for such a centre assumes greater significance, said Dr Arora. Agendra Kumar, president, ESRI India said it is working with colleges, universities and research institutes to build GIS capacity and address changing skill requirements and resource shortage.The ceremony was attended by deans, heads of departments and ESRI representatives.

Weather will remain dry the rest of the time.Moderate to dense fog is likely to occur at isolated places on December 13 and 14. Weather is likely to remain dry for the next two days. Maximum and minimum temperature is expected to hover between 16 and 21 degrees celsius and 5 to 12 degree celsius respectively. Maximum relative humidity is expected to remain between 78% and 90 % and minimum between 42% and 68 % during these days. Farmers sowing the gram crop are advised to use 36 kg seed per acre. They should treat the seed in termite-infested soil with Dursban 20 EC (chlorpyriphos) @ 10 ml per kg seed. Under December sowing, transplanting of gobhi sarson is more profitable than direct sowing, say experts. Farmers have also been advised to use 60-day old seedlings of gobhi sarson (GSL-1), 35-40 day old seedlings for gobhi sarson hybrid Hyola PAC 401 and 30-35 day old seedlings for GSC 6.As clear weather is expected during the next 3-4 days, wheat crop cv. PBW 658 and PBW 590 should be sown. Farmers are advised to spray weedicides. To control gulli danda weed, farmers are advised to spray leader, safal, Marksulfo 75 WG (sulfosulfuron) @ 13 g/acre in 150 litres of water.They are also advised to treat wheat seed with 13 ml Raxil Easy/Orius 6 FS by dissolving it in 400 ml water or 120 g Vitavax Power 75 WS or 80 g Vitavax 75 WP or 40 g Seedex 2 DS/Exzole 2 DS per 40 kg seed, using seed treatment drum to control loose smut and flag smut of wheat. Farmers have been warned against treating seed a month before sowing as it hampers germination.They should manage rodent pests in wheat crop sown with Happy Seeder by burrow baiting with 2% zinc phosphide twice at an interval of 10 to 15 days after sowing of crop (a week before or after irrigation) during this period. Farmers are also advised to spray magnesium sulphate in deficit soils where the wheat crop is 24 to 25 days old.They are advised to conduct regular surveillance of their fields for late blight of potato and if symptoms appear, spray the crop with Indofil M-45/Markzeb/Kavach @ 500-700 g in 250-350 litres of water per acre. For judicious use of pesticides, follow DSS for management of late blight of potato. If there is curling of leaves, farmers should uproot plants or damage infected plants. To control rust in pea, spray 500 g of Indofil M-45 in 200 litres of water. It is the optimum time for transplanting of nursery of tomato and brinjal and sowing of European varieties of radish, turnip and carrot should also be completed.Its time to protect fruit plants, particularly young ones, from low temperature and prepare thatches on young fruit plants. Ensure irrigation to ber trees as fruit is in developmental stage. Spray Karathane (0.5ml) or Bayleton (0.5 g) or Wettable Sulphur (2.5 g) per litre water to check powdery mildew in ber. To check physiological fruit drop in ber, spray Naphthlene Acetic Acid (NAA) @ 15g per 500 litres of water per acre. Dissolve NAA in alcohol before mixing in water.New-born calves need special care in the cold as they are susceptible to pneumonia. They should be fed well-chaffed berseem mixed with wheat straw to avoid tympany (Aphara). Do not feed parali (rice straw) alone to animals because it is rich in silica and causes diarrhoea. Teat dipping should be done with a solution of glycerine and betadine mixed in a ratio of 1:4 to take care of mastitis and teat cracking. All animals should be vaccinated against foot and mouth disease (FMD)."

But a section of farmers in the state are beginning to respond to farmer producer organizations' (FPOs) attempt at marketing as an alternative to the traditional direct selling. The move is also expected to help farmers break the wheat-paddy cycle and take to growing vegetables.A study sponsored by National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) has found that the 69 FPOs in the state with 2,991 farmers as members have facilitated a shift towards crops without minimum support price (MSP). Twenty-nine more FPOs will be added in the ongoing financial year.The report makes out a case for integration of FPOs into the agriculture policy of the state by providing them agricultural produce marketing committee (APMC) licenses.In the case of wheat, out of 74 sampled farmers, 73 continued to sell their produce directly even after FPOs were formed. However, out of 21 pea farmers, 11 switched to FPOs. For other vegetables (except tomato, potato and peas) too, half of the 20 sampled farmers shifted to FPOs.Not just that, eight other farmers who were growing other crops too shifted to growing vegetables on a part of their land and sold it through FPOs. These included cauliflower, pea, cabbage, tomato, radish, carrot, onion, brinjal, okra, round gourd, ridge gourd, bitter gourd, cucumber, water melon and chilli.Prof Satish Verma of Reserve Bank of Indian (RBI) chair at Centre for Research in Rural and Industrial Development (CRRID), who has conducted the study said, ""The trend shows that agri marketing through FPOs in more profitable, especially for marginal and small farmers who have adopted the new system.

""It depends on the functioning of each organisation. The FPO concept is yet to evolve to be really beneficial for marginal farmers. For instances, some FPOs are still relying on commission agents as licenses are still hard to come by,"" said Kiran Singh, a small farmer from Pathankot However, the shift doesn't seem that easy as it turns out that even in case of matured FPOs, the area under cultivation of vegetables as well as sugarcane in kharif season was high but the farmers continued to sell all their produce directly.""But this area has shifted from cultivation of paddy, which is indicative of some crop diversification taking place in the state. A subtle trend seems to be underway towards growing of produce basket crops, particularly vegetables,"" added Verma.The agricultural produce marketing committee (APMC) Act in Punjab makes it mandatory for farmers to sell their produce only in government organised markets through commission agents. These markets are manifested with several imperfections leading to asymmetric information that harms the interests of farmers, says the report."

Integrating consumers to spell out his requirement is one thing but the concept of cooperatives hasnt worked in the state. I take my produce up to retail level.
