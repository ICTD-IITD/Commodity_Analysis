Hundreds of corporations vend food, indiscriminate consumption of which creates digestive disorders, hypertension, heart disease, diabetes and even cancer.Processed and packaged food can be especially challenging to our health as these also contain, in addition to chemicals like fertilizers, pesticides and herbicides, excessive amounts of sugar, salt and oil. Our government would outsource food to these corporations fully if left to themselves, instead of establishing ecosystems for family farmers to grow food without chemicals and undertaking the hard work of pushing and incentivising peasants to diversify their production from wheat and rice to a range of rapidly disappearing traditional foods (like millets) and more lentils, fruits and vegetables.Food processing to be major growth area: consumer choices to fuel change, says FM , read another media headline. Arun Jaitley has said the farm to kitchen chain is going to change in India, with increased agricultural production  and changing consumer preference. The consumer he refers to isnt the marginal and small peasant, the landless dalit, the adivasi in the forest or the urban poor.These corporations, with little interest in the health of consumers, are going to change preferences to more sugared beverages, more potato chips, more chocolates, more fried snacks. If outsourcing the change of consumer preferences to corporations isnt a recipe for a public health disaster, what is?Private Sector Must Invest More in Contract Farming: PM , announced yet another header. Companies are evaluating India as a market to sell their products and as an outsourcing hub.This is farcical in a nation where a vast proportion of the population is malnourished and nutritionally challenged. Prime Minister Modis speech was targeted at corporations and their ease of doing business with the consuming classes, and holds little hope for the poor. Each of these marks his unique approach to development where agency lies with mass-producing, machine-driven companies and entrepreneurs, not peasants and consumers.The purpose of development is forgotten. All political parties are complicit in equating development with GDP growth and FDI.Not much of this will reach the farmer in the form of higher procurement prices; much will instead flow to corporations as profits. Few new jobs will be created in heavily automated food-processing factories. By their very nature, global corporations will import sophisticated machines and labour-eliminating attitudes from their home economies to run these factories.Inequitable distributionNo small farmer will benefit; instead, already wealthy, large farmers in well-irrigated parts of prosperous regions of India will make money from these factories: the kinnow farmers in Punjab and potato farmers in Haryana. What is smothered by the development discourse is the critical issue of health sovereignty; we are ceding our rights to eat healthy, fresh, chemical-free, unprocessed foods to corporations.The urban, educated consumer demands organic retailers undergo stringent checks and penalties for misrepresentation, and rightly so. These same people, however, are eerily silent about the absence of labeling on 99.9% of all food today that is grown with overdoses of chemical fertilizers and pesticides, preserved with chemicals, sugars, salts and fats. These hold no warning that consuming them over a lifetime will destroy our health.The larger picture is quite bleak with little hope of redemption; therefore, all the more reason that individuals must act for themselves.We and our children must beware of food or drink that comes in a package, and we must be mindful of who benefits from our purchases.We must ask difficult questions of a system that produces the chemically poisoned food we consume, and of a government that outsources public health to corporations who package and process unhealthy food.Finally, we must commence our very personal journey of discovery by engaging with a neighbourhood organic farm.(The writer, once a corporate warrior, is now an organic farmer)"

Photo: Indranil Bhoumik/MintNew Delhi: Production of horticulture crops like vegetables and fruits is likely to touch a record 305.4 million tonnes (mt) in 2017-18, about 1.6% higher than the previous year and 8% higher than the previous five years average, the agriculture ministry said in its first advance estimates released on Tuesday.The final estimates for 2016-17 released alongside showed that production of these perishable crops was 300.6 mt, a year-on-year rise of over 5%.Within horticulture, production of vegetables is estimated at 181 mt in 2017-18, about 1% higher than the year before, while that of fruits is estimated at 95 mt, 2% higher than the previous year.Data showed that during the year, area under different perishable crops stood at 24.9 million hectares, about 0.3% higher than the year before. Between 2015-16 and 2017-18, productivity of horticulture crops rose from 11.7 tonnes per hectare to an estimated 12.3 tonnes per hectare.Disaggregated data on estimates of production of specific crops showed onions at 21.4 mt, about 4.5% lower than the year before, and potatoes at 49.3 mt, marginally higher than the 48.6 mt in 2016-17. Production of tomatoes is estimated to rise 7.7% year-on-year in 2017-18 to 22.3 mt, showed the data.The record production during 2017-18 will mark the sixth straight year of horticulture production outstripping that of foodgrains (estimated at 276mt in 2016-17), suggesting a structural change in Indian agriculture where farmers are increasingly growing perishable commercial crops due to a growing market and a quicker cash flow as these crops require less time from sowing to marketing.However, price volatility continues to be a major risk in horticulture, with prices of onions, tomatoes and potatoes plunging below growing costs several times last year. While farmers in Madhya Pradesh were forced to sell onions as low as Rs2 per kg in June last year, in northern India, farmers from Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh were forced to dump their potato crop for want of buyers around the same time.Retail and wholesale prices of perishables are also at a large variance from each other, implying fragmented markets and poor cold chain facilities. For instance, while tomatoes are currently selling for as low as Rs2-4 per kg in wholesale markets in Andhra Pradesh, they are retailing at Rs35 per kg in Delhi."

He said farmers were no longer willing to grow the crop.Replying to him, the Minister said the Rabi crop saw a 1% decline in area sown this year but the actual figures would be known later as sowing was still going on. He expressed confidence that the overall area was likely to remain the same.Mr. Jhakhar was joined by other colleagues who wanted to know the steps the government had taken to help the growers. Mr. Singh said no minimum support price had been fixed but the Centre and the States resorted to the market intervention scheme (MIS) to ensure that farmers could recover their input costs in case of glut.BJP member from Amreli (Gujarat) Narayanbhai Kacchadiya highlighted the plight of the cotton growers because of inadequate prices. Pointing out that the farmer actually got about Rs. 900 against Rs. 1,200 for production for 20 kg, he wanted to know the steps taken to help the farmer.The Minister replied that the government was trying to ensure better prices and was committed to ensuring minimum support prices."

The plan never took shape.In 2015, then chief minister Akhilesh Yadav had announced at a programme that least one vodka brewing factory would be set up in Kannauj and Farukkhabad districts each, which will ensure remunerative prices to farmers.While Akhilesh has represented Kannauj in Lok Sabha for two terms, his wife Dimple Yadav is serving her second term from the same constituency. Kannauj is part of UPs potato belt, along with Farrukahabad, Etawah, Mainpuri and Aligarh, stretching up to Meerut.With 31% production, UP is the largest producer of potato in the country and more than 8 lakh farmers plant potato every year, with production increasing every year.UP produces nearly 46 lakh million tonnes of potato a year in nearly 5 lakh hectares of area. Farmers, however, have no other platform except local mandis to sell their produce and trade some portion outside the state.Demonetisation and souring relationship with Pakistan have further dealt a blow to potato growers who were earlier able to get cash in hand by trading it off to other states and Pakistan.Unlike the adjoining states of Punjab and Haryana and far off Gujarat and Maharashstra, Uttar Pradesh does not have major food processing units to process.This leads to distress selling by growers in local markets at low prices and frequently dump produce on streets in anguish.Official records of the horticulture department reveal that the food processing industry in Uttar Pradesh is at the bottom as compared to any other state.While potato prices have touched an all-time low in the past two years, there was none to educate farmers to shift to other cash crops.Glut in the market in the past two years has resulted in farmers getting into distress, said RK Singh, senior scientist at Central Institute of Potato Research, Shimla.Farm crisis would not be solved unless the state government makes efforts for a food processing industry. Unfortunately, it has not developed in the state, said SK Shukla, principal scientist at the Central Institute of Subtropical Horticulture in Lucknow.Potato growers keep their produce dumped in cold storages for months as they cannot even afford the rent.If we collect the potato from cold storage and take it to the market, it would cost us Rs 30 a kg while potato is already available at Rs 5 to Rs 10 a kg in the market. This does not make economic sense, said Naresh Dixit, a regular potato grower in Unnao."

Because Calcutta was the capital of British India, various people settled here, from the Marwaris of Rajasthan to the Iranians from Baghdad. That is why our cuisine has so many influences, he said, adding how in his childhood days youths were asked to go eat tadka roti in Punjabi dhabas to build bodies like Punjabis.One factor that decided the menu was the seasonality of vegetables. In those days, things would not be available round the year. Also, every part of a vegetable would be put to use. Nothing went waste. Film editor Rabiranjan Maitra recalled potato peels being served fried when he was a child. That was because the economic conditions of families were not good after Partition, Ghose explained.The filmmaker had voyaged down many a river in Bangladesh while shooting for Padmanadir Majhi. In those days, because of poor communication, fishermen could not find buyers immediately if a large shoal of hilsa was caught. One day, at the confluence of Meghna, I found a fishermans wife placing dozens of hilsa pieces on a giant kadai. She said she was extracting the oil from the hilsa to light lamps!The illustration by Debashis Deb in course of the adda. (Sudeshna Banerjee)Singer Manoj Murali Nair said the fish cooked in his ancestral home in Kerala were different from the ones in Bengal. My Malayali grandmother used to cook those fish in wooden utensils on coal ovens. The taste was so different. Siddhartha Chatterjee of Machhlibaba mentioned Meen Curry served on banana leaves in neighbouring Tamil Nadu.Cartoonist Debashis Deb joked about a vegetarian Tamil acquaintance who settled in Calcutta and fell in love with the hilsa but was crestfallen at having to forego fish once he was transferred back to his home state.Ghoses restaurant Bhojohari Manna once received an order of fish curry from a vegetarian family. The man had been prescribed regular protein intake by doctors. So we decided to send him a light katla curry. After a few months, I heard he was merrily having all kinds of fish!The relish of choosing and buying fish from the market is also a part of the pleasures that fish affords Bengalis. My father would check under the gills to check if it was red. That indicated freshness of the catch, Ghose said, adding: These days, the sellers use paint to dupe customers.Ghose is a good cook too. Sudipa Mukherjee of Sudipar Rannaghar asked why he carried rice, daal and pressure cooker wherever he went shooting. I like to be prepared for eventualities, smiled Ghose. Once during the shooting of Mr and Mrs Aiyar, the south Indian cook of the unit prepared such spicy food that Ghose had to cook khichudi 10 times over to feed half the unit, including Aparna Sen, the director. Maitra recalled the unit demanding alubhaja from Ghose at the end of the films shooting in Chalsa. He sought rum from a unit hand and adding a few drops from the bottle, made us memorably tasty fries.Ghose pointed out that cooking was much like making films. Phoron is the most important aspect in any cuisine. Just like you need to know how much or how long to fry, boil or steam, in films you have to decide what and how much to show.Sudipa was embarrassed when asked which her favourite fish were. Katla and tilapia. People laugh at me, she said, defensively. I have seen tilapia on sale in New York. They were originally from Africa. It came to India from the US. Thats why in our childhood, tilapia used to be called American koi, smiled Chatterjee.The programme ended with Nair singing not Rabindrasangeet but a couple of Hindi film songs at Sudipas request while Deb worked on a fish-related sketch."

Besides, owners of cowsheds, dairy farmers from Rajasthan and Gujjars have been asked to take the potatoes free of cost, as the farmers have refused to lift it.The new potato crop is being sold at `2.80 a kilo even though the farmers have spent `7 to `8 a kilo on the crop.

Experts say that at least for the next two months the markets are expected to be filled with vegetables costing fraction of their prices prevailing a few days ago. In Karnataka, vegetable growers are more in Kolar, Bengaluru Rural, Chikballapur, Chitradurga, Ramanagara, Mysuru, Mandya, Chamarajanagar, Hassan and other places. With good rain this monsoon, growers could get good yield too. The price of many vegetables has come around Rs 20 per kilo which was more than Rs 70 a few months back. While the tomato has declined to Rs 11 per kilo, pumpukin is Rs 13 per kg, raddish is Rs 18, snake gourd is Rs 18, while beetroot and potato are Rs 22 per kg, according to the Horticultural Producers Cooperative Marketing and Processing Society (HOPCOMS) price list.Former additional director (Fruits), Dr S V Hittalamani, explained that this was because the state witnessed good monsoon rainfall in 2017. The lakes and rivers had filled, and groundwater had charged up.With this, farmers used borewell for water and it was an advantage for vegetable growers to grow larger quantities of vegetables. If there is more supply than demand, naturally the price declines. This is what has happened now, he said.Citing an example, Hittalamani said tomatoes grown on 6,000 hectares of land yielded around one lakh tones of tomatoes. But this year, with more farmers using their land for growing tomatoes, they have used 18,000 hectares of land and grown three lakh tones of tomatoes as compared to last year. If the quantity is thrice, one can imagine the price slash. In winter season, tomatoes normally grow. This year, growers in Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, Maharashtra have also grown good quantities of tomatoes. This means there is no demand for our tomatoes in these states, he said.People, vendors happyAruna, a resident of Rajarajeshwarinagar bought carrot, onion, potato, peas, beans, chilies and curry leaves, all half kg to one kg. Even after buying so much, my bill was hardly D100. I was happy to buy veggies this cheap, she said. She said just a couple of months back, she used to spend D250 for the same quantity of vegetables. The vendors too are happy. Carrot was D90 per kg just a couple of months ago, now it has dropped to D45. Similarly, potato was D80 per kg and it has fallen to D22. People do come to buy vegetables even if the price is increased, Rudresh, a vegetable vendor at Vijayanagar said. Another vendor, Mahesh at Shivajinagar, said customers are happy. We too are happy that they are buying more in quantity, he said.From less supply to tomato glutAccording to deputy director of horticulture department Chandrashekar, just a few months ago there was demand for tomatoes as there was less supply. The price of tomatoes had reached D90 per kg. It was then that farmers started growing tomoatoes thinking there would be good price in the market. Tomatoes need three months to grow. There was good rain, that added as an advantage to them. There is good supply and price has naturally come down, he said. In summer, with some virus or the other, the yield of tomatoes will come down, and the price of tomatoes will increase during that time."

Reason: Owing to surplus potatoes in the national market, the price remained around Rs 2 per kg, which is the lowest of the season, leaving the farmers with no choice but to take their potato stocks from cold stores and dumping them away.Reports in this regard have come from various parts of the state, including the Dera Bassi, Banur and Rajpura belts. Sacks full of potatoes can be seen dumped near Chhatt village right along the Zirakpur-Patiala highway.With potato production costing Rs 5 per kg, farmers say no one is ready to sell the crop at Rs 2 per kg in the market because selling the potatoes at such low price cannot even cover transportation, labour and gunny bag cost.The ban on the export of potato to Pakistan, where the crop was fetching price as good as Rs 10 per kg, has added to the woes of farmers.  Jang Bhadhur Sangha, potato farmer, JalandharTheir plightDidar Singh, a potato farmer from Shatabgarh village of Dera Bassi, said, Keeping a 50-kg bag of potato in a cold store costs Rs 120 for a full season. A gunny bag costs about Rs 20 and labour cost for filling, loading and transporting the potato-filled bag costs Rs 25.This way, a 50-kg bag costs us Rs 165 in total. However, in the wholesale market, the bag fetches only Rs 120-130. With such a negative return, majority of farmers prefer not to lift their crop from the cold stores, he said.Another farmer from Shatabgarh village, Dasmesh Singh, said, As farmers neither pay the rent of keeping the potato in cold stores nor come to lift their stock, the owners of stores are forced to just dump the potato away on open spaces. And sometimes, farmers themselves throw the potato away in open spaces instead of taking the crop to the market.Mohali, India January 28: Potato dumped road side in village Chatt in Mohali on Sunday, January 28, 2018.Photo by Ravi Kumar/Hindustan Times (Ravi Kumar/HT)Farmers refuse to pick stockThe slump in potato prices has also caused huge losses to the owners of various cold stores, including those of the big cold stores in the 7-km stretch from Jhungian to Jhansla village.Claiming to have suffered losses worth Rs 50 lakh, Manjit Singh, owner of Baba Ajit Singh cold store in Jhungian village,said, Around 500 farmers had kept their potato stock at my store. Out of these, only 200 farmers have lifted their stock. The remaining just refused to pick up their stock, due to which I had no choice but to dump the rest of the stock as the store needs to be cleaned for the next season.One-month electricity bill of my cold store is around Rs 5 lakh. Besides, I have to pay the salaries of my workers too, Singh said.Govt of no help eitherA leading potato farmer in the country,Jang Bhadhur Sangha of Jalandhar, said, The central government had prepared a market intervention scheme to support the market at the time of slump in price of farmers' produce. However, knowing that there is huge price slump due to surplus potato production, the government did not care to intervene. This has left the farmers to fend for themselves. They have no alternative but to dump their stock.Sangha also pointed out how ban on the export of potato to Pakistan, where the crop was fetching price as good as Rs 10 per kg, has added to the woes of farmers. Export to Pakistan would have helped with the profit from potato in the domestic market as the surplus stock in Pakistani market had exhausted, he said.He said they had asked the Union government through multiple channels to allow export of potato, but to no avail."

The meteorological department has predicted more rainfall in the regionBoon for cropsThe regional research centre of Punjab Agricultural University in Bathinda recorded 2.2 mm rain till Monday morning. Chief agriculture officer (CAO), Bathinda, Gurditta Singh said rain was beneficial to all the crops including wheat, mustard and gram.Though the region experienced high-velocity winds as well, these are not yet harmful for the crop, he added. The weather forecast has predicted rain till February 13, which will also be beneficial for the crop, the chief agricultural officer said.Moderate rain in DoabaModerate rainfall coupled with strong winds and thunderstorm across the Doaba region on Monday early morning will help to bring down temperature, giving a boost to the wheat crop and other vegetable crops for healthy growth, agriculture experts said.Jalandhar and adjoining districts including Kapurthala and Nawanshahr recorded rainfall ranging from 8mm to 10mm during the early hours on Monday.Farmers need not to worry. In fact these moderate showers are healthy for all crops, especially wheat, which is a temperature-sensitive crop and needs cold conditions to flourish, Dr Jaswinder Singh, Jalandhar agriculture development officer said.The wheat crop, which has to be harvested in April mid to mid-May, does not need water before three months of harvesting for good growth. He said rainfall will help to bring down the chilling effect on the crops and stabilize the temperature.Dip in temperature will help to save the crop from the moisture, which usually results in damaging the crop. If atmospheric conditions remain favourable in the coming days, we can expect bumper production this year, Singh said.A man runs for shelter amid pouring rain in Patiala on Monday. (Bharat Bhushan/HT)Potato harvesting could be delayed if rainfall continuesAgriculture experts in Kapurthala said that though rainfall was good for all the crops, it could delay harvest of potatoes.If rainfall continues for more time, it will lead to a delay in harvesting the potato crop. The crop will not be damaged, though, said Resham Singh, a Kapurthala-based agriculture expert.Rain lashes AmritsarRainfall witnessed across the northern region provided respite to wheat growers in and around Amritsar.Wheat growers in the region had been worried over increasing temperature, which impacts rabi crops negatively.In Amritsar, rainfall started at 12.30 am on Monday. It continued intermittently throughout the night till morning. Similar condition prevailed in the Majha region.Rainfall pushed the temperature down, thereby creating favourable climate for rabi crops. It was light rain, which is good for the health of wheat. It has a positive impact on the quality of grain and yield. Wheat crop needs low temperature, but for the past few days the temperature had not gone down much. The rain has made the weather favourable for vegetables too, said Dalbir Singh Chhina, chief agriculture officer of Amritsar.Tajinderpal Singh, a farmer, said the increasing temperature had been a cause of worry for them but light rainfall has brightened their spirits.Senior medical officer (SMO) Dr Rajinder Arora said rain has settled pollutants and dust particles causing allergic diseases and infections. Rain has settled them down. Increased moisture in the air also helps fight diseases, he added."

There are times when you are tempted to watch the news for entertainment.He is one of the biggest, if not the biggest, advertisers of TV news, Hindi and English. He owns a TV channel. He has been a mentor-judge on a reality show. And now, he is the subject of a TV show devoted to his life. No one else is spread across the length and breadth of the television universe the way he is.Who is he? Who else but Baba Ramdev.This week, Swami Ramdev: Ek Sangharsh led Discovery Jeet into the entertainment firmament. Its the newest Hindi general entertainment channel on air and has chosen Ramdev as a mascot to escort it across the popularity line, ahead of other channels. Can it achieve its goal? Well, anything is possible when you have a rousing tag line like, Hai Mumkin. And that appears to be the credo: To tell stories of people who face and clear the hurdles in their way to succeed against the odds.Alongside Baba Ramdev on the obstacle race of life is an aspiring hip hop singer (Gabru), a scooter rickshaw driver father who does everything for his adopted daughter (Mere Papa Hero Hiralal) and the 36th Sikh Regiment of the British forces in India, circa 1897 (21 Sarfarosh Saragarhi).Undoubtedly, Ramdev leads the charge. The biopic begins, well, from the beginning, in the Haryana village of his birth. At this stage of his career, his fate is decided by the all-powerful high-caste head (priest?) of the village who ensures that his parents are ostracised and compelled to flee their home. The former tramples (almost literally) on the latter with the full weight of the caste divide in his favour. Although set in Haryana, this caste-outcaste narrative is relevant to the entire country  the first few episodes make for compelling TV as a tale of the powerful and the powerless.Too early to say much more, except why is it that we must impose loud music on word and action?21 Sarfarosh Saragarhi 1897 is too musical for words. So much so that often we couldnt hear the dialogue in the opening episode. Add this to the strange accents of the English (?) soldiers, our hero Ishar Singh shouting to be heard and you have a very difficult time hearing anything and comprehending even less. Foreign characters in Hindi serials (think Porus, Sony) often sound like they have a potato obstructing their vocal passages: Theres a sort of soft strangulated sound that emanates from their mouths like Indians trying to speak Hindi like foreigners.Which is a pity because you want to watch 21 Sarfarosh, based on the actual battle between 21 valiant Sikh soldiers led by Havildar Ishar Singh (Mohit Raina) and thousands of marauding Pashtuns marshaled by Gul Badshah (Mukul Dev). The action alternates between the two camps to establish the ensuing conflict. Historical dramas shot on location are a welcome relief from the stifling interiors of soap opera mansions. Hope this one doesnt become history re-imagined as mythPart of the myth-making is that in the historicals or the epics, the evil invaders are mostly unkempt, bestial with long uncombed hair, crude habits, sweating profusely for example  Gul Badshah and his band of men fit the stereotype at the moment, but he is compelling nevertheless.Gabru is all about hip hop country Punjab where three youngsters collaborate and contest to be the best hip hopster in town.Jeet has other shows on offer including the horror-crime show Anjaan and Comedy High School starring funny man Ram Kapoor.Can it succeed? Well, at a time when most Hindi entertainment is stuck in a soap formula, a new approach to entertainment is worth watching out for. Alas, what happens all too often is that new shows are forced into old bottles in order to appeal to viewers who dont seem to have much of a taste for novelty. Sam Dam Dhand Bhed (Star Bharat) began as a promising story about local politics, between a David and Goliath, but it has quickly descended into a twisted love triangle tale  a pity.Meanwhile, the English entertainment channels are not offering serious competition to the likes of Netflix, Amazon Prime and Hotstar, although there is a new season of Homeland (Star Premiere). Its into its seventh year and Claire is looking more tired than usual this time she has a female American President to contend with too.Amongst the rest, you have Masterchef US which has just ended  not nearly as good as Masterchef Australia (Star World)  Survivor (AXN), Chance (Star World Premiere), American Ninja Warrior (AXN) Americas Got Talent (Colors Infinity) and a dose of Hannah Montana (Disney International) whenever you fancy Miley Cyrus.There are times when you are tempted to watch the news for entertainment.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

As per chief minister Amarinder Singhs directions, the committee will include additional chief secretary (cooperation), additional chief secretary (development) and chairman of the Punjab State Farmers Commission (PSFC). The committee has been directed to submit its report by March 1.The committee would suggest ways and means to provide marketing support for maize and potato crops to ensure that farmers get remunerative prices without wastage of these commodities.The chief minister directed the committee to identify domestic and international markets for sale and supply of farmers produce at attractive prices as they have to suffer losses due to lack of proper marketing facilities for these crops. It has also been directed that the committee should also explore the possibility of future trading in these farm produce to facilitate farmers in ensuring remunerative pricing with risk hedging.The chief minister also reiterated that farmers should be encouraged to opt for crop diversification in a big way in line with the state governments thrust on diversified cultivation as a means of rescuing them from their debt cycles. He has also sought committees suggestions to spread awareness among potato growers about various varieties to help them cultivate the varieties that are in demand by large multi-national companies (MNCs) such as McDonalds and McCain Foods.The chief minister also asked the committee to assess the possibility production of ethanol from maize as suggested by the Union transport minister Nitin Gadkari."

The model contract law, a copy of which has been reviewed by Hindustan Times, follows the Model Agricultural Produce and Livestock Marketing (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2018.Conceived in the 1960s, APMC regulations require farmers to sell to licenced middlemen only in notified markets, usually in the same area as the farmer, rather than directly to buyers elsewhere.These rules were meant to protect farmers from being forced into distress selling. Over time, they have spawned layers of intermediaries, stretching the farm-to-fork supply chain. This results in a large price spread, meaning fragmentation of profit share because of the presence of too many middlemen.Usually, farmers get the lowest share of profit. APMCs have also become hubs for cartels that rig the system to offer lower prices to farmers while driving up prices for consumers. India has about 6,800 such public-sector markets.The revised Model Agricultural Produce and Livestock Contract Farming (Promotion & Facilitation) Act, 2018, now set to be released to states, allows firms to sign advance contracts with farmers to grow a chosen crop or its specific variety with a buy-back assurance at an agreed price, giving cultivators a ready market without the oversight of the APMC system.A model law isnt presented in Parliament, but is instead sent to states for passage since the Centre cannot bring laws to regulate agriculture marketing, which falls in the states domain.To work around APMC markets, the budget for fiscal 2019 has also proposed to develop 22,000 new or existing private rural markets.The revised provisions of the model contract law state that businesses and farmers can enter into contracts for any crop, livestock breed or poultry of their choice. The earlier version, released for public scrutiny on January 23, restricted contract farming to only those crops that are allowed by states.The model law provides for dispute settlement at the level of the tehsil, or local administrative unit. It does away with an earlier provision that disputes could be taken for appeal to a decree court. Instead, the parties can escalate it to a three-member local authority, comprising an independent farmer, a corporate representative and a domain expert, all unrelated to the contracting parties. The law seeks to protect the farmers lands and their title. No business can build permanent structures on a farmers land or seize land. Registrations of contracts will be completely online, the model law says. The earlier version provided for physical contracts.Technological advancement with better agricultural practices makes contract farmers more technically and economically efficient, according to a 2016 post-doctoral study on contract farming in Punjab by Nivedita Sharma of the New Delhi-based Jawaharlal Nehru University.In most cases of contract farming, the sponsor, or the contracting firm, also directly provides most inputs, such as seeds and fertilizer, as well as credit and technical skills to the farmers with whom it enters into a deal. This lowers the market risk for farmers.Several states did reform markets and gave direct marketing licences to various kinds of corporate buyers like Tata, Mahindra and Godrej, said R Ravikanth, an analyst with commodity trading firm Comtrade.We dont support contract farming because it is another form of exploitation. Why isnt there a provision that all produce will be contracted above minimum support prices? said Pema Ram, a leader of the All India Kisan Sabha.Most of these licences are not in use, Ravikanth added, because it is difficult to coordinate with a large number of small farmers. Current examples of contract farming include PepsiCo Inc. for tomato in Punjab, SABMiller Plc. for barley and McCain Foods Ltd for potato in Gujarat."

The average total monthly income of farmers in UP in 2012 was Rs 4923 against their monthly expenditures of Rs 6230 leaving them with savings in minus Rs 1307. The farmers of Punjab earned Rs 18059 and spent Rs 13311 saving Rs 4748 per month.Average gross cropped area per agricultural household in UP was 0.57 against 2.17 hectare in Punjab and 1.68 hectare in Haryana.UPs total share in countrys food production is 17.45% which is highest.Asking such questions is only natural as the BJP had devoted the first full four pages of its election manifesto Lok Kalyan Sankalp Patra  to agriculture and farmers.Farm loan waiver was among the major promises that the BJP made to farmers. The crop loan of all small and medium farmers will be waived, the manifesto said.But when it came to implementing the pledge after the party romped to a grand victory in 2017, the fund-starved new government diluted the important loan waiver promise by putting in many eligibility conditions for debt-ridden farmers to avail the scheme, those familiar with the matter said.For example, it fixed a maximum limit of Rs 1 lakh that could be waived, that too against one loan account only.Initially, 70 lakh farmers were expected to benefit after the government made a budgetary allocation of Rs 36,000 crore but gradually the number came down to just half. Agriculture minister Surya Pratap Shahi said the government had waived farm loan to the extent of Rs 20,596 crore, benefitting around 33 lakh farmers.The eligible farmers, who have been left out, had been asked to give an application by March 10. We have received applications from lakhs of farmers. We will sit in March end and take a call, he said.Even the implementation of the promise drew flak when it was found that many farmers received loan waiver cheques for as low as Re 1 or even less.Although the government countered the criticism by arguing that since the loans existing on March 31, 2016 were being waived, many farmers paid their loan before that period and a few rupees still continued to be showed as arrears with banks. These are the same arrears for which many farmers got the loan waiver cheques of very low amount, additional director, agriculture, Rajesh Gupta pointed out.Arguments notwithstanding, the opposition found an opportunity to mock at the loan waiver scheme. Shailendra Kumar Awasthi, a progressive farmer of Asmanpur village in Bahraich said, the scheme ended up earning more critics than admirers due to dilution and faulty implementation of the important pre-poll promise.The BJPs loan waiver promise was a big joke to farmers, UP Kisan Sabha leader Mukut Singh said. They promised to waive all the loans of small and medium farmers, but later limited the amount to Rs 1 lakh apart from putting many other ifs and buts, he added.The waiver, Singh claimed, was too inadequate and benefitted too small a number of farmers to make any difference.Contrary to the promise of providing affordable electricity to each field, power tariff for unmetered private tube wells owned by farmers was increased by 50% and by 77% for unmetered residential connections at one go a few months after the new government came to power.Unprecedented tariff hike with regard to tube wells and domestic connections in villages contrary to the promise of cheaper power is one of the major reasons for the simmering discontent among farmers, UP Rajya Vidyut Upbhokta Parishad president Awadhesh Kumar Verma said.The work on some other farmer-related announcements is till to begin. They include interest-free crop loan to farmers, setting up of Mukhyamantri Krashi Sinchai Kosh and making cows and other milch animals available to landless farmers.Agriculture minister Surya Pratap Shahi claimed that the government had done a lot of work for farmers, which he claimed had no parallel. Apart from waiving crop loans, we are distributing 10,000 subsidised solar irrigation pumps to farmers every year, providing soil health cards to farmers as a campaign, we did record purchase of wheat and paddy and fixed the minimum support price of potato for the first time and ensured smooth and adequate distribution of fertilizers and seeds, he said, enumerating some achievements.Critics must not forget we got the mandate for five years and we will implement each and every promise made to farmers in the days to come. Our government is committed to doubling farmers income by 2022, he stressed.The criticism, however, becomes important when it comes from an organisation like the Bhartiya Kisan Sangh, an outfit of the Rashtriya Swayam Sevak Sangh (RSS). The government is trying its best but benefits of the policies are not reaching the ground because of the bureaucracy that makes the schemes and rules too complex for a common farmer to avail benefits, said Ram Chela Ji, state organization secretary.Farmers, he said, were disappointed. The government must act fast, he advised.The results of Gorakhpur and Phulpur bye polls must come as a wake-up call to those in power, he cautioned."
5b1c4f549855b74aba67c3eb,"Potato prices up by Rs 5/kg, likely to remain high",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/potato-prices-up-by-rs-5/kg-likely-to-remain-high/articleshow/63407488.cms,2018-03-22,"KOLKATA/TARAKESWAR: The tuber in your daily diet costs Rs 5 more a kilogram than it was last year. Experts tracking the price movement of potatoes say the possibility of a slide in the rates seems thin. Instead, it is likely to stay high for at least the next five months because Bengal has optimal yield this year and it didnt turn out to be a bumper crop that often pulls down the price.Asurvey of the city markets  Gariahat market, Lake market and Maniktala market  on Wednesday shows the tuber prices vary between Rs 14 and Rs 16 a kg, depending on the variety, S1, Jyoti and Chandramukhi.But farmers have made a killing this time, the best in the last eight years, with farm prices at Tarakeswar going Rs 8-9 a kg on Monday, at least 2.5 times more than the Rs 3.30-Rs 3.60 a kg rate last year. Accordingly, the wholesale prices stood at Rs 500 for a packet for 50 kg, which comes down to Rs 10 a kg.The surge in potato prices has an economics and perhaps a dose of politics behind it. The untimely rain after the onset of winter took its toll on production, bringing the yield down to 100 lakh ton, 15 lakh ton less than 115 lakh ton last year. Moreover, 90% of the states aggregate storage capacity was full by Monday. Traders collected potato packets from farms early.According to the agriculture department, the state consumes 5 lakh ton potato a month, the annual consumption being 60 lakh ton. Of the 100 lakh ton yield, about 63 lakh ton have already reached the 453 cold storages in the state, leaving about 20 lakh ton in farms. A chunk of these potatoes may go outside Bengal to UP and Punjab The other part is political. With the panchayat polls being round the corner, chief minister Mamata Banerjee is keen to see farmers get a good price. She is keeping a tab on the potato prices and farm prices. But a cold storage owner doesnt see the surge in potato prices as a reflection of demand and supply. Farm price for potato  Rs 500 for a 50kg packet  is arbitrary. It was fixed without going into the economics. The Trinamoolrun panchayats spread the rates ahead of the polls. The farm price and consequent wholesale and retail prices need correction. The government committee doesnt seem interested, a cold storage owner said.Refuting the charge, Pradip Majumdar , agriculture adviser to CM, cited at least three factors behind the surge: The production is optimal this year. There is a slump in supply from Punjab and UP that added to the overproduction problem last year. Traders took the initiative to buy potatoes they couldnt in 2017 after demonetisation."

The loan was waived after the Bharatiya Janata Party-led state government announced a debt redemption scheme for farmers last year.Actually, only Rs 74,000 was waived against the declared sum of Rs 1 lakh, said a dejected Kumar, who owns eight bighas (1.3 hectares) of crop land.In 2014, third-generation marginal farmers Vijay Mishra and brother Ashok took a loan of Rs 1.25 lakh through the Kisan Credit Card to grow potato and paddy in Samri Majra Baihrana village under Kaudihar block, 35km from Allahabad.But their crops got destroyed, first by drought and then by hailstorms. I was saddled with a loan and an interest of Rs 1.85 lakh. I was relying desperately on a waiver to survive. But after waiting for months, just Rs 65,000 got waived, the 38-year-old Vijay said.Today, I have over Rs 1 lakh to repay and the bank is putting pressure.These two cases reflect the shortcomings in the Yogi Adityanath governments loan-waiver scheme for farmers, a promise the BJP made before the 2017 assembly polls.The party won the elections with absolute majority. The crop loan of all small and medium farmers will be waived , the partys poll manifesto had said.The government of this cash-strapped state has spent around Rs 21,000 crore on this scheme, benefitting 3.3 million debtridden farmers.UP farmers in a precarious situation 1.80 crore estimated agriculture households are there in Uttar Pradesh and 43.8% of them are in debt 23.2% of farm households in Uttar Pradesh live below the poverty line, against the national average of 22.5%. UP is among the states where the proportion of farm households suffering from poverty is the highest in India.  The expenditures of UPs farmers are more than their earnings. The average total monthly income of farmers in UP in 2012 was Rs 4,923 against their monthly expenditure of Rs 6,230. In 2012, the farmers of Punjab earned Rs 18,059 and spent Rs 13,311, saving Rs 4,748 a month  Average gross cropped area per agricultural household in UP was 0.57 against 2.17 hectares in Punjab and 1.68 hectares in Haryana. 17.45% is UPs total share in the countrys food production, which is the highest estimated agriculture households are there in Uttar Pradesh andof them are in debtof farm households in Uttar Pradesh live below the poverty line, against the national average ofUP is among the states where the proportion of farm households suffering from poverty is the highest in India.The expenditures of UPs farmers are more than their earnings.

We had asked the farmers to give applications if they have been left out. We will verify the claims of lakhs of farmers and waive loans of those eligible in accordance with the rules, he promised.But the snags are drawing more critics than admirers to this well-intentioned scheme. The government is accused of keeping its promise by putting a number of riders for farmers seeking their loans to be written off.The government fixed a maximum limit of Rs 1 lakh that could be waived and that, too, only against one loan account.Initially, the number of farmers to be benefitted after the government made a budgetary allocation of Rs 36,000 crore was put at around 7 million.The number was almost halved eventually.In Allahabad district, around 82,000 farmers were identified as eligible for the loan waiver. However, after three rounds of verification, only 49,600 farmers benefited with a total loan waiver of Rs 275 crore. The remaining 32,300 farmers had to repay their loans, lawyer and RTI activist Anand Mohan said.The loan-waiver scheme, Anand Mohan said, should have been implemented in a better way.Not only was the promise watered down, the execution was marred by criticism and controversies when it was found that many farmers received loan-waiver cheques of as low as Re 1 or even less.According to agriculture minister Shahi, loan waiver is not a solution to rural distress.We are working on different fronts simultaneously to double farmers income by 2022 as a lasting solution to the problem, he said, reminding critics that they should not forget that this government has the mandate for five years to work for the farmers.The criticism is not coming only from the BJPs rivals.The Bharatiya Kisan Sangh, a farmers outfit affiliated to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), the BJPs ideological mentor, is unhappy as well.The bureaucracy messed it up by attaching too many riders, said Ram Chelaji, the Kisan Sanghs state organisation secretary.He pointed to the BJPs loss in the Phulpur and Gorakhpur Lok Sabha bypolls in March and said the government should act fast to address the problems of disenchanted farmers.The disenchantment is difficult to ignore in a state in which 43.8% of its farmers are in debt. The government now stands hostage to a promise it made in the run-up to the polls."

Rain upto 22.6 mm was recorded in various parts of Chandigarh. The temperature dropped till 18Celsius from a maximum of 33.7C on Sunday.Humidity between 50-70% is expected in the region on Monday. The Indian Meteorological Department said more rain on Monday was unlikely although isolated spells of light rain will be experienced throughout the week. The in-charge of IMD Chandigarh, Suresh Paul, said, The temperature is also set to fall and the maximum temperature of the day will come down to 30C.This rainfall and drop in temperature was also seen in Chandigarh last year. In fact, last year on this date, the temperature ranged between 32.5C and 16.6C, which is lesser than the 33.7C to 18C recorded by IMD on Monday.The weather turned pleasant following the rain, which lasted for around one hour. The sky however, remained overcast.It was quite dark when we were leaving for school on Monday morning. The rain came soon after. It was very pleasant, Jaskaran, a Class 10 student of a private school, told IANS.Not so merry for farmersDoaba Continuing strong winds and rain from late Sunday night to Monday morning lashed parts of north India, adding to farmers woes and delaying harvesting of rabi crops.Agriculture experts in the region said such sudden change in weather was indeed worrisome for the farmers as it brought down the standing wheat crop in several places.Heavy rain continued in most part of Doaba region on Monday morning. If the rain continues for the next few hours, about 10% of the wheat crop could face yield loss, the experts added.I have asked the field officers to report from their areas to know about the exact damage to the crop. In most of the areas, crop have been flattened and it will delay harvesting, agriculture officer from Doaba Naresh Gulati said.A farmer from Jalandhar, Amanveer Singh, said most of the crop on his two acre land was down following rain and hail. Such weather will reduce the yield by two to three quintal per acre. The crop was ready for harvesting and the losses will be huge, said another farmer Hardev Singh from Kapurthala.Majha Although the weather remained cloudy in Majha on Sunday night with wind and showers reported from some areas, the sun shone in the morning on Monday.However, there were some reports of damage o crops from the areaFor Monday, the maximum temperature will remain at 36Celsius and the minimum at 22Celsius. However, it is expected to fall by four or five degrees on Tuesday with moderate or heavy rain, as per the forecast of meteorological department.An agriculture expert, Dr Partap Singh, said rains are harmful not only for wheat, but also for vegetables and potato crop as dry weather and high temperature is the present requirement.He said the farmers should not water wheat crop as rain is forecast from Tuesday to Thursday this week.Patiala The agriculture department has rushed its teams to different areas to access damage to crops.Not only the standing crop, but even wheat yield unloaded at purchasing centres will also suffer an increase in moisture level due to the rains. Chief agriculture officer Arvinder Singh said farmers cannot harvest the crop till the fields get dry.Hail batters apple orchards in HimachalShimla In the last 24 hours, rainfall, thunderstorm accompanied by hail battered the cash crops in parts of Himachal Pradesh.Capital town Shimla, apple growing districts  Shimla, Mandi, Kullu  have been receiving rain, accompanied by sleet, hails, thunderstorm, high velocity winds, for the last 24 hours, causing damage to apple blooms in many areas. Kotkhai is one of the worst affected regions in the state.In the last one week, it is the third time that hail has pounded apple orchards in the region, said NR Thakur, an apple grower of Kullu district.In lower and mid hills, apple is at the blooming stage and low temperature, rain and hailstorm are going to harm the crop and impact the fruit adversely, said horticulture expert SP Bhardwaj.Parts of the state received light to moderate rain while heavy rain lashed some villages in the state.Heavy rainfall also partially damaged three houses in Jajaid village of Shimla district. There are also reports of minor damages to apple orchards and houses due to the current weather.Meanwhile, Shimla meteorological centre has predicted more rain in the next 24 hours. Till now, 5mm rainfall was recorded across the state. Light to moderate rains accompanied by hailstorm is likely in the next six to eight hours in parts of the state, said Shimla meteorological centre director Manmohan Singh. He said the day temperature has decreased by four to five degrees at various places.About the effect of rainfall on wheat, Manmohan said, The rainfall is likely to delay the wheat crop harvesting in low regions. Over mid-hill rainfall is beneficial because wheat is in the stage of milky to dough. However, in lower hills, it will have a negative effect as the crop is already mature.(with agency inputs)(to be updated)"

The unsold produce soon turned into heaps of rotten slush.Singh says he sold 40 quintals for Rs 2,306 to a local trader, meaning he got Rs 57.65 a quintal. It was the worst year as long as I can remember, he says.The potato crisis of 2017 had to do with a knee-jerk farm trade policy that tends to clamp down on exports at the slightest hint of rising consumer prices. In June 2014, to rein in potato prices, the government imposed a minimum export price on potatoes, put the commodity under the Essential Commodities Act and also allowed duty-free imports. This choked off exports and caused domestic prices to crash amid a potato glut of 48 million tonnes.To avoid such disasters, India is now looking to setup a national agriculture trade policy, similar to the countrys three-year foreign trade policies. The farm exports policy will be geared towards promoting exports rather than them being used as a tool to control domestic prices, a person familiar with the development said.Last month, the commerce ministry unveiled a draft national agriculture export policy in step with the governments target of doubling farmers incomes. It has sought to boost agricultural exports from $30 billion currently to nearly $60 billion by 2022.Consultations among stakeholders, including the agriculture ministry and the Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA), began this month. Key proposals include ensuring processed agricultural products and all organic produce will be free of export restrictions in future. The agriculture and food ministries will also identify food items which will be permanently free from export controls.The government may form a trade perspective over a 5-10 year period and undertake a mid-term review of agriculture trade policy... the official said.The agriculture ministry, along with APEDA, has identified 50 farm export clusters, the official said. The Centre will soon hold consultations with states to standardise taxes in local markets for export-oriented produce, he said. For instance, local market taxes vary widely for basmati rice, a key export commodity. It is 4% in Punjab and Haryana and 1.6% in Rajasthan. For pulses, the fees are 1% in Maharashtra and 2.5% in UP.Indias agricultural exports grew five times from about $8.7 billion in 2004-05 to $42.6 billion during 2013-14. This however fell to $33 billion in 2016-17. Farm economist Ashok Gulati says knee-jerk export restrictions on food items to prevent domestic inflation have deprived farmers of higher prices in the global market. A paper by Gulati, Infosys chair professor and Shweta Saini, who works with policy think tank ICRIER, analysed 10-year data to show that Indias agri trade policy had a pro-consumer bias. The governments Doubling Farmers Income also says Indias exports policy does not promote agricultural trade but is mainly used to control prices in the domestic market. According to the new draft policy, a three-year ban on non-basmati rice exports during 2008-11 amid a rice glut led to a notional loss of $5.6 billion."

Mishra said: ""Following the direction of the state government, we inspected four to five godowns and found that there was no shortage of potato. Yet, the price of potato in the market is high because the price at the sourcing point has gone up.""Mishra said: ""We have not found cases of hoarding so far during our raids which even took place in the Chhatra Bazar godown, one of the biggest markets of the state. But in order to check possible hoarding, food supplies and consumer welfare secretary Vir Vikram Yadav has asked all the district collectors and civil supplies officials to keep a close vigil on supply of potato in the market and ensure availability of the same to consumers at a reasonable price.""The price of potato has jumped to Rs 20 per kg. Last week, it was being sold Rs 16 per kg. Officials said shortage of potato had led to price rise. Consumers have also started complaining about the shortage and sought the government's intervention.Food and civil supplies minister Surya Narayan Patro said: ""We had earlier planned to purchase potatoes thorough Nafed. But as Nafed has quoted a high price, we are yet to take a decision on how to procure potatoes. We have not also decided from where will we procure potatoes.""Officials said the state was facing acute shortage of potato as there was a short supply from Uttar Pradesh and Punjab. ""Though there is a good production of potato in Bengal, most of its production goes to Bihar and Jharkhand,"" said an official.In another development, the state government has fixed stock limit for potato at 500 quintal for wholesalers in Cuttack and 350 quintal in cities such as Bhubaneswar, Berhampur, Sambalpur, Puri and Rourkela. For other places, the stock limit is 150 quintal.However, the Opposition said that the state was facing such a crisis only due to lack of foresight. ""The state government should have set up more cold storages and kept the stocks to meet the future needs,"" said BJP leader Manmohan Samal.Traders' associations alleged that their advice to the government to stock potato had gone unheeded. ""The traders should not be blamed. The government should encourage potato production,"" said Odisha Traders' Association president Sudhakar Panda."

Inadequate availability of raw material, inadequate post-harvest infrastructure, inadequate research and development by processing industry, fragmented value chains and policy distortions are some of the challenges that food processing industry is facing in Punjab, said Dhillon.He also said that PAU has been continuously developing some food processing techniques to promote cultivation of fruits and vegetables but the real challenge lies in their adoption by farmers and other stakeholders. We are developing several techniques to promote crop diversification so that farmers come out of wheat-paddy cycle. But the real challenge is their adoption. Not many farmers are adopting them because it is difficult for them to come out of wheat-paddy cycle as still there are many challenges. On one hand we are asked to push crop diversification and at the same time, we are given the wheat and paddy production cultivation targets to be met each year. So how can we expect that farmers will abandon wheat-paddy, said V-C.He also called for developing strong linkages between PAU and industry for strengthening of food processing sector. The conclave was inaugurated by Punjab industry and commerce minister Sham Sunder Arora who said that Punjab which till now is known as Food Bowl of India will soon be known as Food Processing Hub of India too.Soon Punjab will be the food processing hub of the country. From the largest producer, it will be the largest processor too. A high tech manufacturing cluster at Ludhiana and an integrated manufacturing cluster is being built at Rajpura apart from three mega food parks at Ladhowal, Phagwara and Fazilka. Punjab has total cultivable area of 4.2 million hectares. It produces 19 per cent of wheat in India, 10 per cent rice, 10 per cent milk, 20 per cent honey, 48 per cent mushroom and 5 per cent cotton with just 3 per cent of net sown area in the country, he said.PepsiCo and ITC Limited to expand operations in PunjabThe conclave which was was jointly organized by the Department of Industries and Commerce, Punjab; Confederation of Indian Industry and PAU also saw the participation of several food processing companies representatives including ITC, PepsiCo, Cremica among others. PepsiCo and ITC announced that they would be expanding their operations in Punjab in agro-food processing.Rinkesh Satija from PepsiCo India that they would be investing in snacks manufacturing units in Punjab. He said the need of the hour is to provide cold storage infrastructure and develop more potato varieties for processing. Sanjay Singhal from ITC Limited said that the company has launched new juices products and biscuits and soon they are also going to invest in dairy sector in Punjab. He also suggested enhancing the production and processing of fruits and vegetables in Punjab.Bhavdeep Sardana from Sukhjit Starch & Chemicals Limited called for increase in maize production and processing in Punjab.

Member of parliament Ravneet Bittu was present on the occasion.Conducting a meeting with representatives of various associations of plastic manufacturers and traders in Circuit House, PPCBs chief environmental engineer (CEE) Pradeep Gupta gave a detailed presentation on compostable bags and its benefits, appealing for a shift to the environment-friendly bags. He said in the trials, the bags were also found to be durable.He added that five companies were manufacturing such bags in India at present, the raw material for which was being imported, as these bags were being made of corn starch, potato starch, and cane starch. The official also informed that an estimated 130 tonnes of plastic carry bags were being used in Ludhiana daily, and 225 tonnes in the entire state. On the revelation by PPCB officials that there was a 10-12% consumption of compostable bags in Punjab, MP Bittu called it an appreciable change, and lauded the role of the Punjab government and PPCB.Addressing the media, Bittu said: With the intensive awareness drive being carried out by PPCB throughout the state, the day will come soon when plastic bags will completely disappear. The supply and use of compostable bags cannot be controlled, as there is a huge demand. He advised plastic carrybag manufacturers to shift to making compostable carry bags by using starch derived from maize and potatoes.

Im talking about the intricate web of lanes running from the square opposite the Venetian Gothic-styled David Sassoon library behind Rampart Row all the way to Flora Fountain on one end and Horniman Circle at the other.For what its worth, Kala Ghoda was always a hub for culture and art. Flanked by a museum, many art galleries, a foreign cultural mission, a historical synagogue and erstwhile home to two of Mumbais iconic restaurants. Samovar, tucked inside the Jehangir art gallery, and Wayside Inn, wrapped around the corner next to Rhythm House.Wayside Inn was epochal because it was at Table No 4 that Babasaheb Ambedkar, over hours of passionate persuasions and pots of tea, drafted the Indian Constitution. Its here that struggling progressive artists Husain, Ara and Gaitonde scrounged for toast and eggs, and poets like Arun Kolatkar wrote verses about life, jam and bread. Here that Mohammed Ali Jinnah romanced his Parsi girlfriend over dhansak, and Behram Contractor created his memorable humour column alongside sunny-side-up eggs and bacon. And where a whole generation of post-Independence socialists and intellectuals was bred, over custard and bread pudding.Rampart Row used to be a street full of happening restaurants. All the fun is now inside the lanes. (HT File Photo)I used to love sitting there, watching the rain fall and the brown trees go green, over a mug of beer and plate of mixed grill and onions.Rampart Row used to be a street full of happening restaurants. Wayside Inn has given way to Punjab Grill. Khyber looks a bit lost. Copper Chimney has shifted three buildings to the left, and right above it is Boston Butt. But all the fun is now inside the lanes.It all started with Kala Ghoda Caf. From a small sky-lit space that could seat, at the most, six people and offered free wi-fi, its turned into one of the most influential eateries in that precinct. Its cavernous hall and Bombay black wood furniture are reminiscent of a large dining room in an old Mumbai mansion.At The Pantry, ingredients come from artisanal makers all over India. The Quiche Lorraine they do with oodles of cream Gruyere alone is worth the visit. (HT File Photo)The menu is eclectic. Fourteen types of coffee, from macchiato to affogato. Ten kinds of egg, from the Parsi tamota par eedu (eggs on tomato) to omelettes with bacon and feta. There are also three kinds of waffles, two kinds of porridge and muesli. Its an ideal breakfast place. But lunch isnt bad either. You can pick between sandwiches, soups and sali boti, or try the Karnataka black rice risotto with mushrooms.Just off Ropewalk Lane is The Pantry. White, bright and cheerful, they source their ingredients from artisanal makers all over India. Their cheese for example comes from Pondicherry and the Quiche Lorraine they do with oodles of cream Gruyere and ham alone is worth the visit.La Folie is a stylish patisserie. The tiny place looks like a chocolate box itself, with small desserts lined up like little works of art, but its the hot chocolate that takes me there.At Ayub's, the meat is better, the onions fresher, the chutney less watery. To me, its the Michelin star version of Bade Miyan. (HT File Photo)Then theres Nutcracker, a vegetarian place thats cracked the code. Penne, pesto, panini, potato wedges, with peach and ginger iced tea. But the Emmenthal scrambled eggs with truffle oil, and the Mumbai Local sandwich hit the spot for me.A little further away is Plenty. Its not exactly Kala Ghoda, but a short walk towards Horniman Circle. Brick-walled and poignantly coloured, the menu is a mixed bag of all our favourite dishes that remarkably bear an overall demeanour of goodness and health. Even the usually oily, spicy and vinegary Goa sausage, when served alongside a portion of fresh avocado, pickled beetroot and goats cheese on a crisp slice of healthy toast, tastes wonderfully refined here.They have cold bowls and they have hot bowls and the hot bowl I like is the Kerala pepper chicken stew with steamed rice. But my favourite is the pulled pork sandwich  sweet and spicy pork between freshly baked bread. The finale has to be the berry pavlova, meringues in sour berry compote with vanilla cream, lime and pistachio.Watch out for Maska Maarke by Kunal Vijayakar in Hindustan Times, Mumbai, and on hindustantimes.com/mumbai, every Saturday morning.As the office rush recedes and the lanes empty out, as young couples walk hand in hand in the lanes of Kala Ghoda looking for love, and as revelers hunt for a wine, a beer and a song, I am often spotted looking for a hot spicy egg roll, stuffed with boti kebab. Walk past the aqua-coloured Knesset Eliyahoo Synagogue and at the end of VB Gandhi Marg (VB Gandhi is the man who decided that Mumbai cabs should be black and yellow) burns a late night fire. And that fire is from Ayubs.Ayubs the Michelin star version of Bade Miyan. The meat is better, the onions fresher, the chutney less watery and the rolls less soggy. Hot seekh kebab or boti kebab rolls in soft roomali roti, with crunchy onions and chutney. Thats Kala Ghoda for me as well.But the weather right now is too muggy and oppressive to eat hot spicy rolls. Ill wait for the rain to come and wash the streets and trees of Kala Ghoda, because at the moment SoBos Soho stands for So Bloody Hot."

Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) members also shared the stage with Eco-Sikh members and heads of different religious groups. Eco-Sikh India president Supreet Kaur, while addressing a packed gathering, said: Eco-friendly plastic bags are the future, as pollution levels are increasing every day with the use of non-biodegradable plastic bags. These bags play a crucial role in controlling pollution levels across the globe. They have the capability to decompose naturally in 180 days when exposed to water or sunlight, or disposed of in garbage. Even if they are consumed by animals, they are not harmful to them. Moreover, the use of non-biodegradable plastic bags in religious places have increased in the recent past. Because of this, we have started this service from the gurdwara, so that people take this issue seriously, and make an effort to bring these bags into their daily use.Speaking on the occasion, PPCB chief engineer Pradeep Gupta said: Next month, India is hosting the World Environment Day on 5 June, under the theme Beat Plastic Pollution. PPCB will make all efforts to popularize the manufacturing and sale of bio-degradable bags on a large-scale, to overcome rising pollution levels due to the use of plastic bags. We are supporting every effort being taken to save the environment and future of the earth by different organizations.Extending his gratitude to PPCB and the religious bodies  including Gurdwara Dukhniwaran Sahib, Gurdwara Sarabha Nagar, Jama Masjid (Field Ganj), Durga Temple, Gyan Sthal , and Sri Krishna Mandir  Eco-Sikh Board member Jaspreet Singh said: The use of plastic bags has brought Punjab on the top in terms of pollution. According to past PPCB reports, Punjab produces about 4,300 tonnes of garbage every day, most of which is not recycled and ends up polluting the rivers and our soil. Looking at all statistics, these bags are the need of the an hour. Eco-Sikh has taken up the matter bio-degradable plastic bags, which will conserve nature and preserve our future."
5b14bce69855b75cf6a85199,Breeding challenges: Hybrid rice clicks better in poor than agriculturally prosperous states,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/breeding-challenges-hybrid-rice-clicks-better-in-poor-than-agriculturally-prosperous-states-5197795/,2018-05-31,"In India, hybrid variants are cultivated in 3 million hectares, out of the total 44 mh In India, hybrid variants are cultivated in 3 million hectares, out of the total 44 mhThe poorer a state, the less are the chances of its farmers adopting high-yielding seed technology, right? Well, not when it comes to hybrid rice at least.Out of the countrys total estimated area of 65.8 lakh acres (26.6 lakh hectares) under hybrid paddy  the un-milled grain containing roughly two-thirds rice and one-third husk and bran  nearly 83% is accounted for by Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Odisha. These are states, whose farmers arent as well-off as their counterparts in Northwestern and Southern India, and crop yields well below even that of West Bengal (Indias No. 1 rice producer).What accounts for this seeming paradox  of relatively poorer farmers taking to planting of hybrids, as opposed to conventional open-pollinated varieties (OPV)?Hybrids are produced by crossing genetically diverse plants even within the same species. The first-generation or F1 offspring from such crosses tend to have yields higher than what either of the parents (both OPVs) individually can give. Unlike OPVs, though, the grains from hybrids arent suited for saving and re-use as seed by farmers. The resultant plants will not have the same hybrid vigour as the F1 offspring. Farmers will, hence, plant hybrid seeds  which, have to be purchased each time  only if the grain yields from them are substantially higher over OPVs.In the not-so-prosperous belts of eastern and central India, paddy yields from OPVs average 15 quintals per acre, whereas, with hybrids, farmers can harvest 25 quintals, notes Ajeet Chahal, Head of Seeds Marketing (South Asia) at Bayer AG.The German multinational has a 35% share in the Indian market for hybrid paddy seeds, which, at 38,000 tonnes and an average maximum retail price of Rs 250-300/kg, is annually worth around Rs 1,000 crore. Besides Bayer, the other significant players in this market include DuPont Pioneer, Syngenta, Tata-Metahelix, Kaveri Seeds and VNR Seeds.ALSO READ | A new problem of plenty: Government godowns are, for the first time, bursting at the seams with pulses on record procurementThe seed requirement in hybrid paddy is low  about 6 kg per acre, as against 20-30 kg for OPVs  but yields are higher because the plants produce more tillers (stems). The better tillering ability means farmers need to transplant only one hybrid seedling per rice hill, while it is 2-3 in OPVs. At Rs 355/kg  the MRP for Arize 6444 Gold, Bayers best-selling hybrid that covers some 20 lakh acres in India  the cost of 6 kg seed comes to Rs 2,130 per acre. But given the extra 10 quintals yield  whose value, at the governments minimum support price of Rs 1,550 per quintal, works out to Rs 15,500  it may be worthwhile for farmers in Jharkhand or Odisha to spend that money before every planting season.An Indian Express from Nabarangpur in Odisha showed how this district (which happens to be Indias poorest, with a predominantly adivasi ) alone has a hybrid paddy seeds market of 600-650 tonnes, covering over one lakh of its total 2.5 lakh acres area (goo.gl/sEhQcs).Chahal, however, admits that there is not all that much of a yield advantage from hybrids in the traditional Green Revolution regions, where farmers follow high-management agronomic practices with assured irrigation facilities. In Punjab and Haryana, you get 30 quintals-plus yield per acre from even OPVs. Hybrid paddy may give 10% more, but farmers will switch only if yields are 40 quintals, not 33 quintals, he points out.ALSO READ | Does growth in pulses output mean India has reached self-sufficiency?India has hardly three million hectares (mh) out of its total rice area of 44 mh under hybrids, while the corresponding numbers for China are 18 mh and 30 mh respectively. Chinas average paddy yields, at 6.75 tonnes per hectare (27.3 quintals/acre), are way above Indias 3.6 tonnes (14.6 quintals) and its farmers also typically harvest 10 tonnes per hectare (40 quintals/acre) from hybrids.The Chinese mostly produce medium-bold coarse grain (with length-to-breadth or LB ratio below 3), which is liked by consumers there and also more amenable to higher yields. In India, the preferences vary from short-slender rice (fine grain below 5 mm length and LB ratio above 3) in the South and medium-slender (slightly coarse grain below 6 mm length and LB ratio above 3) in the East, to long-slender (6-7 mm length and LB ratio above 3) and extra-long slender (fine basmati-type grain more than 7 mm long and LB ratio above 3) in the North. There are also varieties such as Parmal, which are in between medium-slender and long-slender. Such diverse requirements across geographies makes hybrid breeding a real challenge, explains Chahal.A.K. Singh, the head of the Indian Agricultural Research Institutes (IARI) Division of Genetics, identifies grain quality as a major cause for the low rate of hybrid paddy adoption. The hybrids bred initially had poor milling quality, with low head rice recovery and high percentage of broken grains. The newer generation of hybrids are far superior, yet the perception among millers, of the grain quality not meeting the standards for government procurement, remains, he says.IARI, in 2001, had released Pusa RH-10, the worlds first-ever basmati-quality aromatic hybrid rice. With a paddy yield of 7 tonnes per hectare and maturing in 110-115 days from seed to grain, it outperformed then blockbuster Pusa Basmati-1 variety that produced 6 tonnes over 135-140 days. However, this hybrid lost out to two basmati OPVs that IARI subsequently released: Pusa-1121 and Pusa-1509. Although they yielded between 5 and 6 tonnes per hectare, the milled rice from these varieties had an average grain length of 20 mm on cooking, as compared to 15 mm for Pusa RH-10, adds Singh.The future of hybrid rice in India lies in breeding not just for yields, but also for quality, regional preferences, and pest and disease resistance. Last year, we launched Arize AZ 8433 DT, a hybrid with strong tolerance to both brown planthopper insect pest and bacterial leaf blight disease attacks. In this kharif season, we are introducing AZ 6633, a hybrid in the short-slender fine grain segment for South India. Besides, we have bred a short-duration Parmal-quality hybrid AZ 6508, yielding 30-32 quintals per acre over 115 days. Farmers in Haryana can harvest this by mid-September and then sow potato in October, claims Chahal.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

The former Indian Youth Congress president added, I humbly request Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh and Punjab Congress president Sunil Jakhar to fulfill Rahul Gandhis promise during the elections.Later, Warring told TOI, My only contention is that instead of Congress leaders who fought the assembly election on a party ticket, successfully or unsuccessfully, workers at the ground level, who worked for strengthening the party, should be considered instead. I am not against anyone. The way Rahulji had done in making me the Youth Congress president, picking a district president or a local Dalit leader for headship of a PSU would send the right message and enthuse the cadres. It is my humble submission to the two leaders.In May, Warring had said that even if he was offered the post of legislative secretary or headship of a PSU, he would rather work with people in his constituency. This had followed Warring losing out in getting a cabinet berth in the cabinet expansion.With reports of resentment among the aspirants who were hoping to get the coveted posts soon after the Congress government was sworn in last year, the focus has shifted to accommodating the senior leaders, instead of those who were in the race for a party ticket in the run up to the assembly elections.To ensure that there were no dissidents in the party who may have gone on to contest as independents and eaten into the Congress vote share, the party leadership had repeatedly said that those who work for the party nominee and contribute to his victory will be accommodated as head of the boards and corporations. But now the party seems to be facing a problem of plenty with 78 MLAs in a house of 117, said a Congress leader.During the previous government, while 45 boards and corporations were headed by political appointees, the rest 12 had bureaucrats as chairpersons. Former chief minister Parkash Singh Badal headed the Punjab Urban Planning and Development Authority (Puda), Punjab Infrastructure Development Board (PIDB), the Punjab Rural Development Board, and the Punjab State Planning Board. The SAD-BJP government had constituted some new boards like the Punjab Gau Sewa Board, the Punjab Parvasi Bhalae Board, the Employees Welfare Board and the Potato Development Board."

Express CACP had recommended MSP for maize at Rs 1,425 per quintal for the year 2018. ExpressJaspal Singh (40), a farmer sitting at the local grain market along with his maize crop, sees no hope for getting a good price for his spring maize crop. The price being offered is Rs 800 to Rs 850 per quintal, the same as the last two seasons; and 40 per cent below the rate fixed for crop by the Commissioner of Agriculture Cost and Price (CACP).Jaspal grows maize on 45 acres, including around 24 acres on lease in Salempur village of Jalandhar. Harvesting of the spring maize crop has already started in Doaba region, the main belt for crop that is grown after potato harvesting in February-March.CACP had recommended MSP for maize at Rs 1,425 per quintal for the year 2018. Also, Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley during his Budget 2018 speech had said that under the Swaminathan Commission recommendations, the MSP for the crops would be fixed and farmers will be given 50 per cent more return over their production cost.We are waiting for the price under Swaminathan Commission report, said Jaspal, adding that at least Rs 1,200 to 1300 per quintal minimum price was needed to make the crop viable.Now the new crop is already in the market and the rate is still very low. Government must act as per its promise, he urged.Ajit Singh, a farmer from Kishangarh village, said: We need fair price to survive. Spring maize is gives 36-39 quintal yield per acre due to its hybrid seed and a farmer can earn around Rs 55,000 if sold at the rate of Rs 1,425 per quintal which is recommended by the central government. This year around 38,000 hectares was dedicated to spring maize in Punjab which is sown between February 15 to March 15 after potato harvesting. This maize is mostly grown in Jalandhar, Kapurthala, Nawanshahr, and some parts of Hoshiarpur, Ropar, Ludhiana districts.Director, Agriculture Punjab, Dr Jasbir Singh Bains, said that department mostly recommends the rainy season maize, but several farmers in Punjab go for spring season maize because it is is quite remunerative due to high yield.

At present, the children are given daliya (porridge), Kher and Panjeeri (Nutritional Indian snack).Now the Department of Social Security and Development of Women and Children is planning to change the menu of the ananwadis as the minister Aruna Chaudhary feels that one cannot have the same item to eat day in and day out as the elders also get fed up eating the same thing.Thus it has mulled that Karha-Puri (sweet-pudding-fried Indian bread), Rajmah-chawal (Rice and Kidney Bean) and Allo sabzi (Potato vegetable) should be served to the children who come to these anganwadi centres. So that the children will also get to eat something different every day.It is learnt that every year the state government spends around Rs 140 crore on the diet on the children going to the anganwadi centres. A little more than eight lakh children between 3 to 6 years come to the 26,836 such centres daily.An officer said, ""daily this menu has been served to the children for last ten years and on each child around Rs 8 is spent daily on just the food and for expecting mothers it is Rs 12 daily.''""Also we are mulling to give khichdi in the new diet besides Karha-Puri and Rajmah-chawal and potato vegetable (allo sabzi) and presently we will stop giving daliya for the time being but the other items like kher and panjeeri will continue,'' he said.Sources said that on Wednesday the Social Security and Development of Women and Children minister Aruna Chaudhary held a meeting with the department and Markfed (Punjab State Cooperative Supply and Marketing Federation) official in which she directed the cooperative to supply the item items as per the new proposed diet plan prepared by the department, a few of these will be packed food items.This will save the department from going through the tendering process for supply of raw material for meals from private contractors and ensure transparency. Thus, with supply of maximum fortified items, including flour and oil the calorie and nutrition content of each meal will be enriched as additional nutrients will be added in fortified items to improve nutritive value.Punjab Women and Child Development minister Aruna Chaudhary said, ""daily three items ( daliya, kheer and panjeeri) are being served at anganwadi centers for many years. Now we have prepared a new menu as we want to change the existing menu.''"

Amarinder Singh meets CEOs of leading Israeli companies inviting them to spike investments in Punjab,http://www.newindianexpress.com/world/2018/oct/22/capt-amarinder-singh-meets-ceos-of-leading-israeli-companies-inviting-them-to-spike-investments-in-1888601.html,2018-10-22,"By UNITEL AVIV: Punjab Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Monday held a series of high-level interactions with officials of some of Israel's leading companies to explore investment opportunities and to assess the potential for collaboration in the state's infrastructural, agricultural and water management sectors.The meetings laid the ground for strong collaborations between the two sides in some of Punjab's most vital areas of development, and gave a boost to the close economic and historical ties between Punjab and Israel.At a meeting with officials of Tyros International Group Ltd, the Chief Minister discussed possibilities of investment by the Group in the areas of energy, water, affordable housing, construction schools and hospitals.The officials briefed the Punjab delegation led by the Chief Minister on the work being done by the Group, which specialises in impact investments and projects, in India, where it has decided to open an FDI Fund dedicated for impact assessments as part of its future plans.Capt Amarinder Singh discussed with the officials the investment that the Group could make in Punjab, which now offers immense potential for global investment and capital fund companies, given his government's strong focus on industrial and infrastructure development.During his tour of NaanDanJain Irrigation farms, the Chief Minister lauded the work being done by the 80-year-old company which was recently acquired by a leading micro-irrigation based Indian company, in the field of precision agriculture and horticulture, in order to boost productivity.He studied the latest technologies being used by the company on its farms to improve the quality and yield of various vegetables and fruits, including brinjal/eggplant avocado and citrus varieties.He examined the potential for adopting the latest technologies used by the company to boost agricultural development in Punjab.NaanDanJain is present in Punjab since 1993 through various completed and ongoing projects, including a Crop Diversification Farmfresh (Farm to Home) project for food and spice processing industries, as well as a Water Conservation Resource to Roots) project through a pilot in Kandi, where the company has established the world's largest standalone power micro irrigation systems for community and individuals.The company is also working on the creation of alternate source of irrigation by utilisation of treated water from sewerage treatment plants and village ponds of Punjab, besides introduction of hydroponics and aeroponics technologies, especially for potato and seed production, as well as replacement of open canal system with HDPE pipes.Capt Amarinder Singh underlined the need for further strengthening such technical collaborations to boost Punjab's infrastructural and economic development.The two sides agreed to explore more avenues to create the necessary environment for greater cooperation and investment in key areas of Punjab's progress.During the first day of his Israel trip, the Chief Minister also visited The Dan Region Wastewater Treatment Plant (Shafdan) and met officials of Mekorot, Israel's National Water Company.The Shafdan is a complex inter-regional system that collects, treats and reclaims municipal wastewater in high density urban areas and industrial zones, and is the largest wastewater treatment plant in Israel.It was constructed by Igudan Environmental Infrastructure in order to treat wastewater in the Dan Region, an urban area in Israel located along the country's Mediterranean coastline, and to recycle it into water that can be used for agricultural irrigation for all types of crops in Israel.The treatment facility is operated by the Shafdan Unit of the Central District of the Mekorot Water Company, Ltd., which acts as a contract operator for the Association.Capt Amarinder Singh was informed that the facility has been handling all of the wastewater from the Metropolitan Dan Region, amounting to about 120,000,000 m per year, so that wastewater is not discharged into the Mediterranean Sea.The treated wastewater is sent to the Negev Desert and contributes to its development.More than 60 per cent of agriculture in the Negev is irrigated by Shafdan water.The Chief Minister concluded his first day in Israel with presentations made by several reputed Israeli companies in the fields of Intelligence Generation and Analysis, Social Media Sentiment Analysis and Use of Technology in Police functioning.These companies are world leaders in the Law Enforcement field and have been working with many International Intelligence agencies and police forces.Capt Amarinder underlined the importance of adopting the latest technologies in the functioning of police & intelligence as a tool to prevent terrorist crime and for maintenance of peace and communal peace in the border state of Punjab.Later, the Chief Minister was hosted at dinner by India's Ambassador to Israel, Pavan Kapoor."
5ce782d8e8e3fc56af419f55,Punjab’s burning problem,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/punjabs-burning-problem/article25341201.ece,2018-10-27,"The highway to Bibipur, a hamlet about 50 km from Patiala town, cuts through acres of paddy. Some of the rice stalk are still a couple of feet high and green but many fields have taken on the distinctive yellow of straw that is ready to be harvested. About 200 km northwest of Patiala, in Amritsar  from where the monsoon winds recede earlier  the fields have already been harvested and readied for the winter crop. In Patiala, this step is still some time away, as the fires attest. Flaming carpets belch white smoke into the clear blue sky along this stretch of highway.Until October 14, 321 cases of fires were recorded in Amritsar. In contrast, there were only 81 in Patiala, according to the Punjab Remote Sensing Centre, Ludhiana, which tracks such fires via satellites and reports them to the government. Punjab alone generates about 20 million tonnes of straw, three-quarters of which are burnt. Behind the generation of such a huge volume of chaff is the increasing popularity of combine harvesters. Farmers prefer these machines as it helps them save on the high labour costs of manual harvesting. But one advantage of manual harvesting is that the stalk which remains is extremely small and does not impede the sowing of fresh seed. But the machines leave stubble shavings that are 6-8 inches high, which if not cleared make fresh sowing impossible.There are just two things needed for the quickest and the cheapest way to get rid of this stubble: diesel and a match box. Not surprisingly, setting the stubble on fire to prepare the fields for wheat has become a common practice in Punjab. Until a few decades ago, the straw generated by the machines was manageable. They could be sold to the packaging industry and also turned into mulch within the field through the natural, slow process of organic decomposition. Now, however, with about 20 million tonnes of straw generated in the State, and barely two to three weeks to dispose them of and prepare the fields for the next crop, cost-conscious farmers are left with few options other than burning the whole lot.For about a decade now, the Delhi administration has been complaining about this practice, holding it responsible for the abysmal air quality in the capital in winter. In 2013, the National Green Tribunal issued a directive to Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh asking them to ban such stubble burning. The environment ministers of these States as well as top officials at the Centre declared a zero tolerance policy on the burning of stubble, which has been estimated to contribute anywhere from 7% to 78% of the particulate matter-emission load in Delhi during winter.Since then, farmers in these States, particularly in Punjab, have been at the receiving end of an arsenal of measures which have ranged from persuasion to threats, incentives and entreaties, aimed at dissuading them from the practice.Are machines the answer?In Bibipur, on an early October evening, a group of farmers have gathered at the village council office, a single-storey structure with a corrugated metal roof. In the buildings porch are what the State (and Central) government consider to be the instruments of emancipation: a Happy Seeder machine, a paddy straw chopper and a super straw management system.Broadly, they are a family of hulking, mechanical attachments hitched to tractors. Between them, they can cut the rice straw, chop it finely, and strew it in the field so that over time it decomposes into mulch and becomes organic manure. The Happy Seeder, in particular, allows the rice straw to be cut, new seed (wheat, in the case of Punjab) to be sown, and the residual chaff to be strewn.Seeders and choppers have a long history in India. Inspired by the design and make of similar implements in fields in the U.S. and Australia, they cost Rs. 1-2 lakh a piece.Until 2016, Gurubans Singh, who is Bibipurs biggest farmer with 70 acres of land, was not convinced about the benefits of mechanised harvesting. Singh, who worked as a senior official in the State excise department, returned to farming post-retirement, leasing out portions of his land to tenants. We have been hearing about the harmful effects of stubble burning for some years now. But there were few practical alternatives, he says.This year, Singh says, he was convinced by an environmental engineer at the Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) to try out the machines. Further, there was a new scheme, funded by both the State and Central governments, to defray the expense of buying these machines.Earlier this year, the Union Agriculture Ministry earmarked Rs. 591 crore for disbursal to Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, the idea being to help farmers access these machines. Individual farmers could buy them at half their retail price; if bought through self-help groups, they got an 80% discount. In Bibipur, Singh and nine other farmers got together and formed such a group. The cost price of the equipment in the Bibipur council office yard is Rs. 10 lakh, but thanks to the government scheme, Singh and his associates bought it for Rs. 2 lakh.According to Hardeep Singh, a local farmer, there are about 800 households in Bibipur, and nearly 1,200 acres of paddy fields that are ripe for harvesting. These machines, at best, can harvest 10 acres a day. There are just three to four machines available [for a variety of tasks such as cutting the straw, planting wheat, baling the straw] for all of us, says Hardeep. That works out to 120 days for managing the fields. But farmers have barely two months  from mid-September to mid-November  to clear out the field. This year, delayed rains have shrunk that window further, and different regions in Punjab have different harvesting times in keeping with subtle weather differences. In many cases there is no option but to burn because its quick and cheap, says Hardeep.Given the narrow harvesting window, farmers who require the machines have to line up at the village office to rent them, at Rs. 150 per hour. These machines, now gleaming as they are fresh from the factories, will last about seven to eight years, during which they would lie idle for 11 months in a year. There are servicing costs as well. Sub-optimal machines could backfire and even reduce the yield of the wheat. Servicing and maintenance costs, however, are not included in the government subsidy.Even Singh, who is optimistic that farmers in his village would, like him, whole-heartedly eschew stubble-burning doesnt expect it to happen this year. There also remains to be addressed the matter of inadequacies in the harvesters. For instance, the implements that Bibipur has procured are suitable for large tractors, whereas many farmers here only have smaller ones. This problem is prevalent in other villages too.In Rolu Majra, a village in Rupnagar, Ajaib Singh, 58, who has three acres of paddy, points out that to derive optimum results from the Happy Seeder machine, a tractor with a capacity of 45-55 hp is required. I have a tractor of only 35 hp. Tell me how can I use this machine in my field? The government is pushing these machines without realising that they are not viable for small and marginal farmers, and that they will only increase their straw management costs, he says, adding that given the speed at which the Happy Seeder machine operates, it would take several days to sow wheat as farmers in the village would have to use the machine turn by turn. This would mean that the farmers either have to lease bigger tractors to use these implements or procure customised implements that may cost them more. Just one self-help group in a village is not adequate. What we hope is that by next year (the subsidised-implements scheme is expected to continue) there will be greater supply, Ajaib says.According to government figures, there are around 1.85 million farming families in Punjab, of whom 65% are small and marginal farmers. Of the 5.03 million hectares of land in Punjab, around 4.23 million hectares are under cultivation. Patiala has about 270,000 hectares under cultivation, and in line with the rest of the State, follows a rice-wheat cropping pattern, with rice sown in July and harvested in October-November, while wheat is the winter crop harvested in March-April.A routine practiceAbout 100 km from Bibipur, in Ludhianas Rola village, a paddy field that is barely an acre, is on fire. Upendra, a daily wage labourer from Bihar, is navigating the periphery of the field with a thresher, pushing in stray clumps of straw into the flames to ensure they burn better. He says he is merely following instructions from his paymaster (a farmer whose name he does not know) for Rs. 300 a day.Sarabjit Singh, another farmer from Rola, says that for him, burning the paddy field after harvest is a routine, annual practice. He adds that in his village and for 50 others in the region, no machines have been made available nor have there been any awareness programmes on the harmful effects of burning.State government officials, however, claim that Punjab had disbursed about 8,000 farm implements to individual farmers and set up 4,795 custom hiring centres, from where such machinery could be leased. The cost of hiring these machines, according to Sarabjit, was Rs. 5,000 an acre, and setting the field alight only cost him a few litres of diesel. The per-acre costs also vary depending on the size of the landholding and the cost of fuel on a given day.This narrative, of many farmers being too poor to afford the machinery, is one that State pollution control board officials routinely encounter through the year.Until mid-October, the PPCB had levied Rs. 8,92,500 as fines  or environmental compensation cess as it is officially called  on farmers burning paddy stubble. However, they have managed to collect only Rs. 3,05,000, according to PPCB figures.The fines are collected over time. Often the farmers do not have the money to immediately pay these fines, says Gulshan Rai, chief environmental engineer, PPCB. Another PPCB official, on condition of anonymity, says that they often do not enforce the fines as these work out to about Rs. 2,500 per acre. Officials say that satellite images alert them to fields set afire by farmers but actually confronting a guilty farmer is a complicated affair. We get in touch with the patwari (who keeps land-ownership records) to identify the farmer concerned. Sometimes the farmers protest, sometimes they plead innocence, and sometimes poverty, says the officer, who is tasked with following up on stubble burning incidents in Punjab.There is also the danger of violence. The cropping and harvesting seasons are highly stressful times for the farmers who have their hands full coping with uncertainties on the procurement and weather fronts. There have been instances when our officials were gheraoed, or asked why am I being punished, when youve let my neighbour get away, and then there are the farmer unions backed by different political groups. These are complications that we face every year. This year is no different, says another PPCB official.Jaspal Singh, another farmer from Ludhiana, says that rising diesel prices are another factor that farmers bear in mind when choosing between mechanised stubble harvesting and merely burning the field. The machines consume about five litres of diesel per acre. If we grow potato, then about 20 litres. The cost for potato is higher because it is not possible to deploy a Happy Seeder, which is only equipped to thresh rice-straw and sow wheat. In other words, other instruments, such as the mulcher plough, are needed to prepare the field for potato, which would add to the costs.In Punjab and Haryana, there are restrictions in place on how much groundwater could be drawn, as farmers in these States like to flood their fields to sow the rice crop. This, according to Jaspal, has further narrowed the window to a mere two-three weeks for clearing out the rice stubble, forcing farmers like him to burn away the stubble.The government lineBut officials from the PPCB insist that enforcement of the stubble-burning ban has been stepped up, and so far, there have been fewer fires this year when compared to the same time frame last year. From September 21 to October 21 this year, there were 2,589 cases of stubble fire in the State compared to 7,613 such cases during the corresponding period last year.There has also been independent confirmation (though relying on the same satellites) of this decline from Hiren Jethva, a U.S.-based researcher at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)-affiliated Universities Space Research Association. Jethvas analysis of crop fires in Punjab and Haryana between October 1 and October 22 suggests that there were 12,194 instances of fires in 2017 and only 5,893 this year. There had been 16,275 of these in 2016.For Krunesh Garg, Member Secretary, PPCB, this is a sign that government intervention is working. We have scaled up several measures this year. Now the crop residue is also being used for seven biomass-based power projects with a combined capacity of 62.5 MW, he said at a recent media briefing. We are educating farmers that burning the soil also destroys the soil nutrients and increases their fertilizer requirement. We have run advertisements. Using farm equipment is only slightly costlier, just Rs. 300 more per acre, than burning the field, and it helps preserve the environment as well as their health.Apart from efforts to motivate farmers to sell their field residue to power generation companies, the administration is also trying to build a narrative on how stubble-burning damages the soil.According to Punjabs Additional Chief Secretary (development), Viswajeet Khanna, burning a tonne of paddy straw leads to the soil losing about 5.5 kg of nitrogen, 2.3 kg of phosphorus, 25 kg of potassium, 1.2 kg sulphur, and 400 kg of organic matter, besides causing the death of useful microbial population. Currently, about 4.30 million tonnes of paddy (21.82% of the total paddy straw generated) is being consumed by various stakeholders, as opposed to being burnt in the fields.Pointing out that mechanisation is not the sole answer to the problem of stubble burning, Umendra Dutt of Kheti Virasat Mission, an organisation promoting organic farming, says that mechanisation is only a partial solution, since most of these machines would be used for just a month and lie idle for the rest of the year. Instead, farmers should be motivated to diversify their crops, focussing on domestic diversification and not just commercial diversification.Yet, even the most optimistic of pollution board authorities, be it in Punjab or Delhi, is not expecting instances of stubble-burning to drop down to zero. In his briefing a fortnight ago, Garg said that 80,879 fire incidents were detected during the season in 2016, and 43,660 in 2017. This year, we expect a 50% reduction, he said. This is roughly in line with the reduction last year. Garg also contends  and this is a widely prevalent view among farmers in Punjab as well as among other PPCB officials  that the pollution from stubble-burning in Punjab contributes minimally to Delhis pollution. We frequently see that air pollution remains low in Punjab but becomes very high in Delhi. Surely, if stubble-burning is a major factor, would not that be reflected here too? he asks.While studies over the years have established that pollutants can travel great distances and survive in the atmosphere for a long time, the contribution of Punjabs stubble-burning to Delhis winter smog has not been precisely determined. A Harvard University study published in March 2018 said that 7-78% of PM2.5 pollution in Delhi is due to agricultural fires.Sachchida Nand Tripathi, a professor at the Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur and an expert on air pollution, says that the relative contribution of crop burning to Delhis pollution episodes is over-emphasised and gives a simplistic explanation for severe pollution episodes. Stubble burning does play a role, but our recent studies show that 60% of Delhis pollution is due to a wide range of sources within Delhi NCR, such as industries, coal burning, and vehicular emissions. Efforts should be made to address them too.Using farm equipment is only slightly costlier than burning the field, and it helps preserve the environment as well as the health of farmers.Krunesh Garg,Member Secretary, Punjab Pollution Control BoardIn many cases there is no option but to burn because it is quick and cheap.Hardeep Singh,Farmer"

Three days ago, premium quality onions were being bought from farmers in the range of Rs. 12 to 15 per kg, but their prices also crashed to below Rs. 10, by Monday. In other parts of the State, farmers are being forced to sell their crop for Rs. 1/kg.Distressed, the farmers in Bagalkot district recently protested by throwing onions on the road and staging rasta roko. Similar agitations were held by farmers in Hubballi. The Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha, which also held a protest in Bengaluru on Monday, has demanded that the government announce a minimum support price (MSP) and open centres across the State for the purchase of onions. We spend more on transporting onions from the farm to the market than what we get, said Hanumanthappa, an onion farmer from Amingad, Raichur district, who had come to Bengaluru on Monday to protest.Basavaraj, another onion grower from Chitradurga, felt the government must announce an MSP and buy their stock. Last year, onions got good price as a kg went up to Rs. 30 in the wholesale market. We were expecting a similar situation this year, especially after Deepavali. But, we have now incurred huge losses, he said.According to Ravi Kumar from the Onion and Potato Traders Association, Bengaluru, there has been a glut of onions in markets across the country leading to crashing prices. Supply has far outmatched demand for onions in the market. In the last two weeks, markets in Alwar, Rajasthan; Ahmednagar, Maharashtra; and Belagavi, Karnataka have been shut down for days, and they havent bought onions as the existing stock is still unsold, he said.Why the glutWith a bumper onion crop this year, crops from Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh have flooded the market, while the harvest season in the State has yet to end.To add to this, onions from Pakistan and Afghanistan have flooded Punjab and Delhi markets.We dont see the situation improving till the harvest season for the crop is over and stocks are cleared. In fact, we foresee a further drop in prices, said a procurement official from a prominent retail chain in Bengaluru.One kg of onion is still being sold at Rs. 20/kg in the retail market and the prices are expected to crash this week."

Let Karam (trade) follow Dharam (religion). Our only wish is that Wagah is opened for trade. It holds immense potential for Punjab and for other neighbouring states as well as for Pakistani Punjab, said Rupinder Singh Sachdeva, chairman of Punjab chapter of PHD Chamber of Commerce.Industry sources said that due to restrictions only a few items can be sent through land route. Importers and exporters on both sides have to send or receive items through sea route. First industrialists from Punjab send products through Kandla (Gujarat) or Nhava Sheva (Maharashtra) ports to Dubai from where these are sent to Karachi port and then to Punjab in Pakistan. What can reach there just by covering 40-50 km covers thousands of kilometres. It would not only help the business thrive but the environmental impact would also be good with things reaching there through very short route, he added.An exhibition and trade fair is being organized by the chamber from December 6 to 10 at Amritsar. It was started in 2005, when Captain Amarinder Singh was the chief minister. This is the 13th edition of the fair,Sachdeva said.However, earlier exchange of business delegations was better. For the last three years, both the countries are not giving visas easily. This time also we are getting only 4-5 exhibitors directly who have SAARC visas and others would be holding their stalls through their local contacts or dealers. The businessmen from there now have stopped applying for visas as the wait for visa was being made torturous, Sachdeva revealed.Echoing similar sentiments Chamber of Industry and Commercial Undertakings (CICU) president Upkar Singh Ahuja, whose unit at Ludhiana manufactures auto components, farm machinery and bicycle components, said that there was immense potential of trade with Pakistan. We have been demanding for the last 20 years that trade with Pakistan should be opened, he said.Trade with Pakistan holds key to huge markets further and Punjab cen benefit from it immensely, said Hand Tools Manufacturing Association secretary Ashwani Vitcor.Farmers also raise voiceIf export of potatoes is allowed to Pakistan then all the growers can be saved, said Jalandhar Potato Growers Association general secretary Jaswinder Singh Sangha. Here we are going in losses for third consecutive year while prices of potato are very good in Pakistan. We are not getting orders from Indian market and opening Pakistan can save the situation, he added."

Palaniswami wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday against the closure of the Central Potato Research Station (CPRS) at Muthorai in the Nilgiris.After media reports suggested that the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) decided to shut it down, he said: The closure of the CPRS at Udhagamandalam will have a detrimental impact on the interest of the potato farmers of this State and entire South India.Potatoes are primarily grown in the hilly districts of Dindigul, the Nilgiris, Krishnagiri and Erode, covering nearly 5,500 hectare.The CPRS, founded in 1957, has been serving potato farmers for the past 70 years in coordination with the State as well as with the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University (TNAU).This is the only station in South India researching potato cyst nematode and potato early blight which were major diseases affecting potato cultivation and help the farmers to keep these maladies in check and grow the crop profitably, the Chief Minister said.Cost of cultivationThe Central Potato Research Station was one of the two Institutes where potato farmers were getting disease-free seeds.If the research station was closed, farmers in south India would have to depend on the Potato Research Station at Jalandhar, Punjab to access disease-free planting materials, which in turn will increase the cost of cultivation.Moreover, the varieties of north India are not suitable for the south, he added.

It wasnt blood. But Bandu Markad said it wasnt any different for him. The farmer was in distress and he had just squished the pomegranates that he had grown under tremendous hardships, which included getting water in the drought-prone district.Markad had reason to curse his luck. When he took the yield from his 1,200 trees to the market, he got a price of Rs 10 per kilo. Days ago, it was Rs 80. A video of Markad in tears and beating pomegranates to pulp soon went viral. Moved, people sent him money. At the end of five days, he had about Rs 2 lakh in his account.One could call Markad fortunate. But across the country, a range of issues from debt to low prices for their produce have forced farmers to take desperate measures. Many killed themselves, destroying the lives they left behind. A month after BJPs Devendra Fadnavis took over as CM of Maharashtra in 2014, he said tackling the agrarian crisis would be his top priority. He drafted a special action plan to check suicides in 14 of the worst-hit districts. In 2017, 2,917 suicides were reported, while in the current year, up to October 31, 2,223 farmers have ended their lives.On March 12 this year, thousands of farmers from Maharashtra reached Mumbai after covering 180 km on foot to highlight their plight. On November 30, those in north and central India trooped into Delhi  among them prominent leaders from Opposition parties, indicating the significance the issue has acquired on the national political stage  to articulate their anguish.In the sullen crowd were men like Mohanlal Nagda of Rewli-Devli village in Neemuch district of MP.Nagda had for long avoided looking at the big pile of onions rotting away in a corner of his farm. It invariably brought tears to his eyes. Harvested on his 2-acre land, all 100 quintals of his onion yield now lies dumped. He knows he wont recover the cost if he tries to sell it.The mandi is only 10km away. But Id rather not take my produce there, he said. He quickly did the math. The onions are harvested, but to cut them I must spend Rs 15,000 at Rs 150 per quintal. Transporting it to the mandi will cost Rs 2,500 more at Rs 500 per trolley. I need to spend another Rs 1,500 on loading, unloading and mandi expenses, Nagda told TOI. At Rs 2 per kg, all Id get is Rs 20,000. So, I preferred dumping them, however much it hurts. I spent around Rs 40,000 on cultivation alone. The produce is already decaying. It terrifies me.Maharashtra has declared drought in 151 talukas across 26 districts in the wake of a deficient monsoon. The dry spell has affected an estimated 60% of the 1.6 crore farmers in the state. Due to below average rainfall during sowing season, the output has been hit too. Several areas reported over 70% crop loss and the state sought relief of Rs 7,962 crore from the Centre.But respite looks remote for large chunks. A Nashik farmer recently sent a money order of Rs 1,064 to the PMs office. It was what hed got after selling 750 kg of onion after a crash in prices. It doesnt help that Maharashtra  like many other states  hasnt been able to break cartelisation by wholesale traders and middlemen in market yards to ensure fair pricing. Even implementation of minimum support price (MSP) has not been achieved by the state. Moreover, farmers across India are forced to sell their produce at low rates because the infrastructure to store and process it is lacking.Acting on a report that finances, lack of assistance for healthcare and poor crop output were among the reasons for farm distress, Fadnavis proposed last year that agricultural loans should be waived and farmers can avail fresh aid from financial institutions. In June 2017, the CM announced a loan waiver scheme for 89 lakh farmers; loans amounting to Rs 32,000 crore were to be waived. So far, loans worth Rs 17,000 crore owed by 40 lakh farmers have been waived, while Rs 25,000 crore has been sanctioned for 50 lakh farmers as fresh aid. A raft of schemes has also been drafted to tackle agrarian distress, but implementation is slow owing to lack of coordination and supervision at different levels.Far away in Punjab, farmers are on the warpath over implementation of the Swaminathan Commission recommendations on fixing of MSP of rabi and kharif crops. They also want a complete farm loan waiver, not the partial one okayed by the Amarinder Singh government.Seven farm organisations in Punjab have decided to raise both issues and hold protests on December 18. The organisations have decided on round-the-clock protests outside banks from January 1 to January 5. These groups had earlier stopped the supply of milk and vegetables to urban areas in the state, leading to clashes with milkmen and a lot of produce literally going down the drain.Its a similar story but a different crop in UP. Owing to a bumper harvest this year, potato farmers say they are ruined as the price per 50kg sack has fallen to as low as Rs 20. Cold storages are full of unsold potato. Rakesh Kumar, owner of Mangla Mata cold storage in Badaun, said, Storages in the region have a total capacity of 30 lakh sacks. Of these, 20% are potatoes, but no farmer is coming to fetch them right now because of falling prices. I have already thrown 7,000 sacks while 10,000 more are still here. Selling the produce at villages for Rs 20 per 50 kg sack does not even recover the cost of transportation.Mahendra Swaroop, state president, Cold Storage Association, UP, said, Huge quantities of potato are stuck. District magistrates do not let us dump our produce anywhere as it stinks badly. Haalat kharab ho gayi sab ki."

The former deputy CM said earlier paddy farmers had to suffer a loss of Rs 1,100 crore because the government postponed paddy transplantation and the same resulted in lower yields.The SAD chief said, At present, potato farmers are suffering with their crop selling for less than Re 1 per kilogram but the government is not making any effort to rescue them. The state farmers were being subjected to kurki, he said, adding that Captain Amarinder Singh had fooled people with the slogan karja, kurki khatam, fasal ki poori rakam in the run-up to the last assembly elections.Addressing the mediapersons in the legislative assemblys press lounge, Sukhbir flagged various other issues where the state government had alleged failed like social welfare schemes for which Rs 55 crore was pending towards shagun beneficiaries. He also highlighted the delay in clearance of post-matric scholarship and old age pensions, pendency of four instalments of dearness allowance amounting to Rs 4,000 crore to state government employees, and delay in implementation of the pay commission since two years.Audit system for DSGMC fundsSAD president Sukhbir Badal on Friday claimed that once a new committee of the Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (DSGMC) was elected, a complete audit system would be put in place to check gurdwara funds embezzlement. Sukhbir had on Thursday dissolved his partys Delhi unit, which ruled the DSGMC. On the same day, a Delhi court had ordered FIR against SAD leader and DSGMC ex-president Manjit Singh GK and other officials in Rs 51 lakh gurdwara fund embezzlement case."

Earlier, it was confined to Rohtas and Kaimur, but the farmers of Patna and Nalanda districts have also started stubble burning, which must be stopped at all costs, the CM said after inspecting the contract potato farming model by women self-help groups at Sonbarsa in East Champaran.The CM asked Bihar Rural Livelihoods Project CEO Balamurugan D to take Jeevika didis help in creating awareness against stubble burning.Speaking at Mahavir-Rameshwar Inter College in Harsiddhi, the CM said the state government had already decided to open an engineering college in each district and paramedical colleges and polytechnic colleges in each sub-divisional headquarters for imparting technical education to the deprived sections of society.He said the government under him opened 22,000 new schools in remote villages but 12.5% children were still out of the education system and most of them belonged to the unprivileged sections.He recounted how his government schemes like poshak and cycle yojana, student credit card and scholarship initiatives minimized the dropout rate of girls students in schools.Earlier, the CM unveiled two busts of late Rameshwar Mahto and Mahavir Prasad on the Mahavir-Rameshwar Inter College in Harsiddhi. While Rameshwar was the father of former minister Awadhesh Prasad Kushwaha, Mahavir was the father of district BJP chief Rajendra Prasad Gupta.

It includes Rs 6- Rs 8 production cost and Rs 3-Rs 4 for harvesting, packaging, cold storage and transportation. The fresh crop, which has hit the market, is being sold for Rs4 per kg. So we are not being able to recover the production cost. The implementation of GST has also bumped up the costs.More than 90 per cent of the potato crop in the state is grown in the Doaba region, which comprises Jalandhar, Kapurthala, Hoshiarpur and Nawanshahr districts. Potato is grown on around 85,000 hectares, and it produces 2.2 million tonnes of the crop.Singh said that retailers are earning from the crop, but farmers are failing to recover the production cost. It is estimated that around 10 lakh bags of potatoes from the previous year are lying in 500 cold storages in the state (each bag has 50 kg). Now, they have been given for free as cattle feed, said Singh, who has 12,000 bags lying in his store. He added that as the crop this year has been infected with blight disease the production is expected to fall. Also, farmers are spending Rs 5,000 extra to save the crop.Jang Bahandur Sangha, Secretary General of Confederation of Potato Seed Farmers, said, Punjab supplies 75 per cent of shed potato (potato seed) to other states. But most states have already sown their crops. Hence, we suspect that our potato seeds will not be sold and there will be no liquidity with the farmers.Potatoes from India are exported to the Middle East, Sri Lanka and Russia. Exporting potatoes are costly as it involves freight charges. The US and the European Union does not allow potato imports and for last two years Pakistan, too, has banned it, said Sangha. The state government has asked the Centre for permission to export potato to Russia, the USA, Iran and Sri Lanka."

Whats worse, some of the leftover stock of last year is still lying with them.The farmers claim that they are unable recover even their cost of production and harvesting as the price is down to Rs 3 per kg. When the harvesting of potatoes started, which are supplied directly in the market for domestic consumption, the price was at Rs 20-25 per kg. That was three weeks back, now it has crashed to Rs 3 a kg. While, Jalandhar is largely a seed producingbelt for the country, farmers here also harvest part of their crop for supplies in the local market, said Jalandhar Potato Growers Association (JPGA) general secretary Jaswinder Singh Sangha.Cost of production, harvesting and packing ranges from Rs 6 to 8. With selling price tumbling to Rs 3, and would not be surprising if farmers start ploughing their produce in their fields, said Kulwant Singh of village Qadianwal on the outskirts of Jalandhar.He said that some part of the last year crop meant for supply as seeds was still lying with them. Market for us has just not revived since demonetization. For third year in a row, we are set to fave huge loses, he said.Demonetisation was announced in the days when season for receiving orders was about to start. After the announcement, we received no orders from traders. The entire business was based on cash transactions and our biggest buyer is West Bengal. Even 2015 was also not very good for us, but last two years have been the worst as our buyers from other states were left with little cash, he said.Village Uggi resident Gurdeep Singh said that while he would be harvesting his entire crop in February for supply as seeds to others states but some part of his last year crop was still lying with him.Meanwhile, Sangha said that they had last year demanded that export to Pakistan be opened in the summer. Pakistan does not have cold storage facility and in the summers there potato prices remain high and we could have finished our stocks of previous season by supplying the produce to Pakistan. Now, there would be no benefit as their own fresh crop would flood the market, he said.Since demonetization, there has been no reprieve for potato growers and they are continuing to suffer. We cant give up potato cultivation easily as we have invested on implements and appliances, said Sangha and Kulwant.When contacted, deputy director (horticulture) Satbir Singh confirmed that prices were low.Doaba belt of Punjab mainly produces potato seed for major parts of the country and they did not receive good returns on their produce in the last two years. In these days only a part of the crop is harvested for supplies to local markets and their prices have also come down after the glut in the market, he said."
