Political parties too have framed special strategies to woo this large chunk of voters. Villages are expected to witness crowded 'chaupals'.The multi-phase elections will begin with notification for the first phase on January 17 and end with voting in phase 7 on March 8, coinciding with a period when farmers have some time on their hands. ""This season wheat has been sown in around 1.24 hectares alone in Agra district and potato in 79 hectares. Harvesting of mustard crop will take place on 30 hectares. Farmers will start harvesting potatoes from around February 25, followed by wheat and mustard in March,"" said deputy director of agriculture, K N Rai.Shyam Singh Chahar, district head of Bharatiya Kisan Union said, ""Farms in Agra and nearby districts are covered with crops of wheat, potato and mustard. Framers will not be having much to do on the fields till first phase of voting on February 11. Farmers will be discussing their issues with the candidates and mark their presence in election rallies and political meetings.""Farmer Manvendra Singh of Kheragarh block said, ""It is after a long time that the election schedule is suitable for farmers. During election campaign days, we will have time to listen and interact with candidates and ask them what they are going to do for agricultural development and welfare of farmers.""This time party workers and candidates will not have to make the round of farms to meet cultivators and seek their vote. During the day, farmers will be either at home or in public places in villages.BJP district president Shyam Bhadoriya said, ""The party in Agra has been in continuous interaction with farmers. Our wing, the BJP Kisan Morcha, has been helping farmers in their time of need. Ahead of elections we are going to organize special chaupals and interact with farmers around bonfires. We will remind farmers of the pro-agriculture initiatives of the central government and note down their grievances."" BSP district head Pramod Raina said, ""We will make farmers aware of the Centre's neglect and farlse promises by the state government. In recent seasons farmers in the region have faced major losses due to harsh weather but the government has not provided any help. Through open meetings the party's plans for welfare of farmers will be conveyed throughout the district."" Congress district president Dushyant Sharma said, ""Party workers are in regular touch with farmers. The Centre's unplanned demonetisation has hit farmers the most. Once votes to power, the Congress will completely waive all pending debt, reduce electricity bills by half and enact other initiatives to relieve the burden on them. Special teams have been constituted at the district level to visit different villages and convey the party's vision for the welfare of farmers."""

On November 13 last year, Modi had urged the people to give him 50 days to implement the note ban and said if after that they found shortcomings in his work they could punish him at a public square. At the Prakash Utsav event in Gandhi Maidan on January 5, Lalu's absence from the dais had set tongues wagging. ""I was happy to sit cross-legged for two-and-a-half hours along with devotees,"" Lalu said today at a news meet where he tore into the Centre over demonetisation. "" Ekdam tanatan hain, (I'm fit as a fiddle),"" Lalu said he had told Modi when the Prime Minister had enquired about his health. He said Modi's praise for prohibition was a red herring. ""Nitish has been demanding prohibition in the entire country, but Modi cleverly avoided committing on it. His praise for prohibition was to hide the failure of demonetisation and deflect public attention from it,"" Lalu said. He said the country was reeling from the note ban shock, with GDP growth rate plunging and the unorganised sector virtually destroyed, impacting around 40 crore workers and common people. ""Farmers across the nation are facing devastation. They have to sell potato and cauliflower at just Rs 2-3 per kilo,"" he said. Aboout BJP president Amit Shah's visit to Patna Sahib today, Lalu said: ""He has come late. Yet he should pray to Guru Gobind for forgiveness for implementing demonetisation in the country."" He also challenged Modi to declare how much black money the government has recovered after demonetisation. Peppered with questions about the bonhomie between the JDU and the BJP (read Nitish and Modi), Lalu flicked them away by saying ""it is a good thing"" and that the BJP should support the government in developmental works instead of mudslinging. Lalu also revealed that he had called up Akhilesh Yadav last evening and told the Uttar Pradesh chief minister: ""Enough is enough; you should meet your father (Mulayam Singh Yadav) to stop all this (the infighting). Akhilesh asserted that he was still with his father and had asked for just three months to officiate as Samajwadi Party (SP) president."" Lalu said he would call Mulayam tonight, and that SP leader Amar Singh ""should make efforts to bring Mulayam and Akhilesh together""."
58fd104e7be9e06c937141de,Has Akhilesh turned Agra into Paris? Young Yadav seems to be beating BJP on development in Uttar Pradesh,http://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2017/jan/31/has-akhilesh-turned-agra-into-paris-young-yadav-seems-to-be-beating-bjp-on-development-in-uttar-pra-1565545.html,2017-01-31,"AGRA: With the 2014 Narendra Modi wave a thing of the past, Uttar Pradesh chief minister Akhilesh Yadav appears to be taking ove the development plank from the BJP for the upcoming Assembly elections. While farmers appear anguished that much of the promises made by the BJP during the 2014 polls remained unfulfilled, the chief minister seem to be beating the anti-incumbency factor, as locals claimed that Yadav has turned Agra into Paris.Even while the long drawn out family feud within the Yadav clan continues to command the attention of the people on the lines of a never ending television serial, the state chief minister seems to be gaining the support. Akhilesh Yadav has taken the right step to take control of the party. Mulayam Singh Yadav should have passed the baton to avoid the family drama. Akhilesh Yadav has done a lot of good works for the state. There is no anti-incumbency factor against him, said Rajesh Pachauri of Bakalpur village in Mathura.Even while the BSP supremo Mayawati had faced the CBI probe in the Taj corridor project, the chief minister seems getting the credit for its completion. With carved and lighted red-sandstone pillars dotting the Taj corridor in Agra, the stretch has become a major tourist attraction. Akhilesh Yadav has turned Agra into Paris. You may just go and take a look, said Rohit Singh, who added that the inner ring road in the city along with the promises of airport and Metro have endeared the chief minister closer to the people in Agra.Even while Agra had traditionally been a BSP bastion, the SP is making spirited attempt to make inroads into the area. The prospects of the SP had apparently taken a hit after the sudden demise of its nominee Chandrasen Taplu. However, his wife Mamata Taplu, who is now the SP candidate from Agra Cantonment, after winding off campaigning late evening, told EXPRESS that people in the city are rallying behind the chief minister due to his development credentials. He is a youth with a clean image. The chief minister has fulfilled all promises that he had made for Agra. My husband had also done a lot of developmental works, said Mamata Taplu.While Akhilesh Yadav is drumming up support for completion of road projects and welfare schemes, the BJP is facing anger of the farmers. Farmers sowed pulses in the hope of better prices. But once the crop matured, the prices crashed. Similarly, the potato farmers could not recover even half the input cost, said Ajay Singh, a farmer in Sikandara.Having won the political battle against his uncle Shivpal Singh Yadav, people on the ground claimed that the chief minister could not be blamed for poor law and order situations in the state. People are well aware that there were bad elements who did not allow the chief minister to function independently for most parts of his tenure. Now that those elements are out of the party, Akhilesh Yadav has come out clean and stronger. The Muslims will back him in this elections, said Gani Mohammed, a retired teacher, in Agra."
58ff1c877be9e041361628f2,"Thanks to note ban, farm sector may not see 'acche din'",http://www.deccanherald.com/content/594489/thanks-note-ban-farm-sector.html,2017-02-02,"Sagar Kulkarni, Feb 3, 2017, DHNS 8:48 ISTDateline: New DelhiDays after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced scrapping of high value currency notes, Agriculture Ministry officials were eagerly awaiting the details about sowing for rabi crops across the country. The government was facing all round criticism for having announced the note ban at a time when the agriculture sector was witnessing an upswing on the back of a better monsoon after two consecutive drought years.The sudden withdrawal of legal tender of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 currency notes had left the farmers devoid of any cash to buy seeds or fertilisers. But as the figures trickled in, there was a sense of cheer as the sowing operations appeared unaffected.Up to November 11, rabi sowing was completed on 14.6 million hectare area  5.7% lower than normal crop coverage and the gap declined steadily. During the week ending January 20, 2017 sown area under rabi crops was 628.34 lakh hectares, which was 6.07% more than last year's acreage of 592.36 lakh hectares.Agriculture Minister Radhamohan Singh has been issuing statements on how demonetisation had not affected rabi sowing to counter the campaign by opposition leaders on note-ban leading to agrarian distress.Experts have been sceptical about the government's gung-ho approach vis-a-vis the rabi sowing numbers, particularly the comparison with the previous year's acreage which was low because of severe drought. Though the government speaks glowingly about demonetisation not affecting farm activity, the numbers tell a different story. According to the data released by the Agriculture Ministry, rabi sowing in 2013-14 had touched 670 lakh hectares and leading to a bumper harvest of 263 million tonnes.Economist Pronab Sen was categorical. Rabi sowing looks big on the small base of last year, he said. Sen, India's first chief statistician, also said the government could have pushed for implementation of demonetisation in January this year as the seven-week gap would have helped farmers make purchases of seeds and fertilisers for sowing of the winter crop.According to Sen, delaying note ban by a few weeks would have helped farmers sell their kharif crop, prices of which had already fallen drastically on account of good harvest. The wholesale markets, which usually deal in cash, had a tough time lifting the farm produce and the maximum impact was felt by those dealing in fruits and vegetables.Farmers in Punjab and Uttar Pradesh dumped their potato crop on the roads in Ambala and Lucknow, respectively, as they had no cash to pay for transportation of the farm produce to wholesale markets. In Gujarat's Surat, farmers threw vegetables and milk on the streets as they had no access to cash after the government kept out the district central cooperative banks out of the demonetisation process.Prices of fruits and vegetables dropped in wholesale markets post-demonetisation as did the market arrivals. Prices of banana, apple, tomato, cabbage were lower in the range of 4% to 9% in November when compared with the rates in October, making it clear that farmers were affected to some extent.Government analysts say that the prices of tomatoes crashed in December because of glut in the market due to bumper crop. But they admit that it would be difficult to ascertain how much fall was because of the glut and how much due to disruption due to demonetisation.Cash crunch in rural areas had turned acute as the cooperative banks as well as primary cooperative credit societies too were kept out of cash exchange affecting purchase of quality seeds and fertilisers by farmers.There were reports about slowdown in farm activity such as timely spraying of pesticides or application of fertiliser for want of labour. Many farmers were unable to make cash payments to farm labourers who were forced to return to their home towns. Cotton trade nosedived as mills were unable to make cash payments to farmers who supply bales.Quiet acceptanceThere is quiet acceptance of this fact within the government circles as productivity may take a hit this year. Also, farmers have bought far less amount of fertilisers this rabi season when compared with the previous two drought years. One set of estimates peg the sale of fertilisers to be nearly 7.5% lower than the previous year.This means that despite high acreage achieved during the sowing phase may not reflect in the farm output this rabi season. According to a study by Ramesh Chand, Member, Niti Aayog, a 1% increase/decrease in fertiliser use result in 0.1% increase/decrease in agriculture GDP and about 0.14% increase/decrease in crop output.If the current trend in the shortfall in fertiliser consumption continued till the end of the rabi season, it could lead to a more than 1% decline in production. As a result, the rate of growth in farmers income is also expected to dip due to the drop, though Chand still pegs it at 5.8% in real terms for 2016-17.Indias farm sector was looking set for some good times after two consecutive drought years that had slowed down growth and even witnessed a contraction of 0.2% in 2014-15. The normal monsoon had cheered the farmers who had reaped a better kharif harvest and were keen to follow up with even better returns in the winter crop cycle.Ratings agencies had forecast 4% growth for 2016-17 over the previous year which was certainly brighter given the meagre growth in the past couple of years. The sector had barely witnessed growth since 2011. In 2012-13, the farm sector grew by 1.5%, followed by 4.2% in 2013-14, -0.2% in 2014-15 and 1.2% in 2015-16. At a time when things were looking up, the demonetisation decision has pushed the long desired achhe din for agriculture in the realm of uncertainty."

Instead, they promised KCR a one-on-one with the Prime Minister and an all-party meeting after March 8, once the final phase of election in Uttar Pradesh is over.To placate KCR, the BJP leadership also assured favourable announcements for Telangana from finance minister Arun Jaitley during the budget session.The day-long negotiations ended in positive note with KCR agreeing to visit Delhi and meet several Union ministers. The CMO confirmed that KCR is leaving by 8pm for New Delhi on Sunday . Speaking to TOI, TRS MP B Vinod said, ""There will be a meeting with Prime Minister Modi, for which time and date is not yet confirmed. Our chief minister will be meeting President Pranab Mukherjee and home minister Rajnath Singh. The President will be invited for the centenary celebrations of Osmania University by the CM.""As per revised schedule, the chief minister will stay put for three days from February 6-8 in Delhi, meeting half a dozen Union ministers and Niti Aayog chief.Chief minister KCR also made it clear that some of his demands must be accepted and incorporated in the budget. Finance minister Arun Jaitley will make an announcement on the reorganization promises made to Telangana soon. KCR will now meet environment minister Prakash Javdekar to seek clearances for power projects in the state, including Yadadri and Bhadradri thermal power projects."
58f6cb917be9e031f13bbf23,UP polls: Note ban dents BJP in urban pockets,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/agra/up-polls-note-ban-dents-bjp-in-urban-pockets/articleshow/57106597.cms,2017-02-12,"AGRA: Demonetisation, farmer distress and poor living conditions notwithstanding, people of Agra are hopeful. And if the 'silent voter' does, indeed, exist, her voice may only be heard when the election voting machines beep in agreement with their choices.In Agra's nine assembly constituencies, it's hard to predict the electoral verdict. It is, however, almost certain that the BJP that is the chief challenger in almost every constituency in the district. And while some are vocal in their support, many are open in voicing their dissent. A Dalit farmer in Agra Rural reserved constituency, Govind Singh said, ""In 2014, we voted for Modi ji in the hope of seeing our fortunes rise. This time, though, I will not vote for him. That's because he did nothing for the farmer. In fact, with demonetisation, he hurt us badly.""Singh might have gone on about how the farmers are now looking for alternatives in the Rashtriya Lok Dal, the Samajwadi Party and the Bahujan Samaj Party but for the arrival of Chaudhary Phool Singh, an upper caste Jat. Singh arrives with a pack of young strongmen from the village. And from this point onwards, the Jats outshout the Dalits, and the conversation turns in favour of the BJP The Dalit now fall silent.In faraway Etmadpur, the opposite end of the Agra district, the Yadav voter is similarly silenced by the dominant Thakur voices in Barhan village. Here, the upper caste voters are divided in their support for BJP and the local BSP candidate Dharam Pal, who enjoys considerable goodwill in the constituency. Etmadpur is a traditional BSP seat where the BJP is usually never a contender. When former village head Shyambabu Tyagi alleges the incumbent UP government led by chief minister Akhilesh Yadav has done nothing to ease the farmer distress in the potato belt, Pappu Yadav, a corner tea stall owner, says he received a cheque of Rs 750 when he lost his crops to a severe drought two years ago. Soon after, Yadav is surrounded by a group of naysayers in the village. Outshouted and outnumbered, he falls into an embarrassed silence. A local stringer, a bystander to the debate, says: ""Oonchi jaat waley bolne nahi dete. Waise yahan BSP jeetegi kyonki candidate accha hai. Lekin hum pe pressure hai (BJP se)...thoda help karneki.""If the BJP's traditional support in urban pockets is eroding, the saffron party is making up by making inroads into the rural terrains where it has not usually held sway. Though there is a dent in popularity in the BJP graph in comparison to the Lok Sabha polls in 2014, people are still hoping that the promise of ""acche din"" will bear fruit, especially if the BJP wins Uttar Pradesh. ""Agar aloo ke daam girte hain, to Modi ji ki kya galti hai? Yahan to aloo ke kisan hames ha hi pareshaan rehire hain,"" says Ajay Pal Singh, insisting that demonetisation has had no impact of farmers' fortunes."

We were ruined by the note ban, he said.Demonetisation also impacted the small local industries that depend heavily on cash transactions to pay wages of the labour procured locally. Traders were also adversely hit.Big industries did not experience the pain... the smaller ones were badly hit, said Rajesh Gupta, a trader in Lakhimpur-Kheri district."

What can be more shameful than befriending those who tried to murder one's father?... They cannot be pardoned.""Kya raajneeti itni gir gayi hai ke kursi ke moh mein iss prakaar ke kaand kiye jaaye (has politics degraded to such an extent that for the love of power such a thing would be done)?""Recalling the incident, Modi said, ""Fed up of attacks by Mulayam Singh as Leader of the Opposition in Vidhan Parishad, Congress got shots fired at him on March 4, 1984 but he scraped through...I want to tell Akhilesh that he should have remembered this incident before sitting in the lap of Congress.""He went on to add, ""Akhileshji ko abhi anubhav kum hain, Congress wale kitne chatur hain inko samajh nahi aata...Mulayam ji ko toh pata tha (Akhilesh has less experience. He does not understand how cunning Congress people are. Mulayam knew about it).""On March 4, 1984, Mulayam Singh's car was fired at by some persons while he was on his way from Etawah to Lucknow and the name of a strong Congress leader had figured in the case.Hitting out at Congress, Modi said the party was running a three-legged race with one leg tied to Bahujan Samaj Party and another to Samajwadi Party.""During the first press conference after the alliance, Akhilesh had attacked Mayawati but when Congress vice president was asked about her, he said he had nothing to say against her,"" the Prime Minister said.Rahul had said, ""I personally respect Mayawati. Though BSP ruled in Uttar Pradesh and made some mistakes, my respect for her is intact"".This had prompted BJP to dub BSP as a hidden partner of Congress-Samajwadi Party.""They cannot win this race as BJP, which is running on two legs, will pip them to the post,"" Modi told the rally today.On the state of affairs in Uttar Pradesh, Modi said the abbreviation of UP may be read as ""up"", but everything is ""down"" in the state.""The only thing up in UP is corruption, law and order, riots, atrocities on women, unemployment, poverty, mortality rate of mother and child, migration...and Akhilesh says 'kaam bolta hai' (work speaks)...it is not kaam but karname (misdeeds) which are speaking for him,"" Modi said.Claiming that the Centre has taken important steps for the welfare of farmers, the Prime Minister said his party has promised in its manifesto that onion and potato will be bought at Minimum Support Price and will not allow the potato growers to die.""BJP manifesto promises loan waiver of small farmers...As an MP from the state, I promise that it will be my responsibility that this promise is fulfilled in the first meeting of the BJP government,"" said Modi, who represents Varanasi constituency in the Lok Sabha.Addressing the gathering in this region having a large number of potato growers, Modi said in the last (Lok Sabha) elections the ""bahu"" (Dimple Yadav) of Samajwadi Party had promised to set up chips-making unit here which did not come through, but she won the poll.""Will you not seek a reply from her or not,"" the Prime Minister asked in his typical question-answer style of establishing direct rapport with the public.""The SP government (in UP) is anti-poor,"" he said, adding that while he himself as no home or vehicle of his own, SP leaders have large fleets of vehicles.""What kind of samajwad (socialism) is this?

""It is shameful that there is a son who is ignoring the struggle of (Samajwadi Party patriarch) Mulayam Singh Yadav. He has jumped into the lap of those who had tried to kill his father,"" the Prime Minister told an election rally in Kannauj. ""Akhileshji,"" he added, ""I want to ask you, did you forget the incident of March 4, 1984, when some people had fired at your father to kill him?"" Observers believe local political rivalry had led to the 1984 attack but Modi appeared to be referring to the Congress, as he played on the differences within the state's ruling party that has formalised a pre-poll deal with the Congress. Mulayam had opposed the tie-up but Akhilesh went ahead, eventually sealing a seat-share pact that left 105 of the state's 403 seats to the Congress. ""Nothing would be more shameful than such an act of a son to join hands with the attackers of his father for (the sake of his) chair,"" Modi said. The Prime Minister was speaking on a day 67 constituencies voted in the second phase of the Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections. Kannauj will vote in the third phase on February 19. Modi asked Akhilesh to listen to Mulayam, saying the chief minister does not understand the ""designs of the Congress"" which, he claimed, had also kept its future options open with the Bahujan Samaj Party, the Samajwadi's arch-rival. ""Akhilesh is new and he is not able to understand all this. But Mulayam Singh Yadavji understands very well the designs of the Congress party,"" Modi said. The reference was to Rahul Gandhi's comments at a joint media conference he had addressed with Akhilesh last month where the Congress leader had said BSP boss Mayawati's ""politics does not pose any threat to the country"". Congress sources had said Rahul avoided criticising Mayawati's politics to send out the message that the agenda for Dalit empowerment was a common goal. Although Modi appeared to be soft towards Mulayam at one point, he didn't mind targeting the entire Yadav family later in his speech. ""I don't have any car. I use one given to me by the government because I am the Prime Minister of the country. But the Samajwadi family has 200 cars. Is it socialism?"" he asked the crowd. Modi also attacked Akhilesh's wife, Kannauj MP Dimple Yadav.

58f4d52f60de470aa339c834,Us-versus-them undercurrent in heartland,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170217/jsp/nation/story_136262.jsp,2017-02-17,"Gadiya Kachpura village in Uttar Pradesh Gadiya Kachpura (Kannauj), Feb. 16: Harinath Singh's face glowed with excitement. He had seen Narendra Modi in real life for the first time and from the closest possible distance. "" Chehra ekdum gora hai, aur chamakta hai (His face is totally fair and it glows),"" Singh, a backward class marginal farmer, tells those gathered at the teashop near his village. Last Wednesday, Modi addressed a rally in Kannauj, and Harinath had managed to wind his way to the front rows on the military ground. The five Assembly seats of Kannauj, represented by Uttar Pradesh chief minister Akhilesh Yadav's wife Dimple in the Lok Sabha, will go to polls this Sunday. At the teashop, Congress leader Tariq Bashir confronts Harinath. He asks whether Modi's ""glowing"" face will fetch "" roti"" for Harinath. ""Chehra dekhne se roti milega kya?"" Tariq asks. Harinath retorts "" roti"" is given by ""Bhagwan (God)"" but it is his dharma to respect a big person like Modi who has come to his place. Harinath points out how the Prime Minister has promised to waive loans of small farmers and ensure potato farmers get a fair price if the BJP comes to power in Uttar Pradesh. ""Modiji is such a big man and if he is promising, then we have to believe him,"" Harinath says. Tariq, the Congress leader, keeps arguing but Harinath doesn't give in. Eventually, Bhaiyalal Rathore, a retired teacher, steps in. ""You (Tariq) are opposed to Modi and so whatever he (Harinath) says you will not accept,"" Bhaiyalal says. The argument ends on a pleasant note with no sign of ill-will. Some point out it is "" matdaan (election)"" and so each one has his ""mat (view)"". After tea, Bhaiyalal and Harinath invite this reporter to their village. The village called Gadiya Kachpura, around 2km from the teashop, is dominated by non-Yadav backward classes in an area regarded as Yadav territory and a stronghold of the ruling Samajwadi Party. The over 500 dwellings are inhabited by residents belonging to castes such as Kushwaha, Kahar, Kaanchi, Dohre, besides a couple of Muslim and Yadav families. Gadiya Kachpura has electricity, road connectivity and other basic facilities. Most residents acknowledge "" vikas hua hai"" (development has taken place). They say Kannauj, Mainpuri and Etawah are pocket boroughs of the Yadav family and the association has rewarded the region in terms of development projects. But some spoke of ""one problem"". ""Akhilesh has done a lot of work. Farmers are getting electricity and he has built roads. But there is one problem,"" says Pritam Singh, a Kushwaha. After a pause, he resumes: ""The problem is that one community is being more favoured. The government gives money for the wedding of Muslim girls but not for Hindus. In wazifa (scholarship) too, Muslims get a preference over Hindus."" Amrital a.k.a. Baba, saffron-robed and aged over 60 years, chips in. He claims his old age pension was stopped in 2013 and when he ran from one official to another, he was asked to pay a bribe. He claimed that elderly Muslim men and women get pension without paying any bribe. Vijay Pratap, a 38-year-old teacher at a government school, says there is no communal tension in the region that has never seen any communal flare-up. ""The villagers are upset over one community being given preference by the government,"" he says. Surendra Singh, 50, enters the discussion and says development is not everything. ""Safety and security of the country is most important,"" he says. He says "" badlao"" (change) is needed in Uttar Pradesh to ensure the country is safe and secure. ""Everyday we hear reports of aatankwadi (terrorists) infiltrating. The hands of the leader who works in national interest should be strengthened,"" he says holding up a clenched fist. ""Modi is working in national interest,"" Surendra adds. Many residents acknowledge that local BJP leaders and Vishwa Hindu Parishad representatives had been raising these issues much before the polls were announced. The villagers claimed that in the 2012 Assembly polls, the village had split 50:50 in favour of the Samajwadi Party and the BJP. ""This time it is going to be 80:20 in favour of the BJP,"" said Bhaiyalal Rathore, who claims he was a ""socialist"" but stands disillusioned because of caste and communal politics. The BJP is banking on the support of non-Yadav OBCs to end what they say ""the 14-year exile of the BJP in the land of Rama and Krishna"". Combined with the support of upper castes, the party hopes to regain power in Lucknow. The party has fielded over 100 backward class candidates. The undercurrent of communalism, particularly among the non-Yadav backward classes, appeared to be permeating beyond Gadiya Kachpura village. In Farrukhabad town, 40km away, J.N. Katiar, a retired state government official, insists the BJP is the best option for the state to become "" uttam pradesh (best state)"". ""Modiji will face re-election after two and a half years (the general election in 2019). He will come again seeking votes and so he has no option but to develop Uttar Pradesh. The SP and BSP will loot the state for three years and then do some work,"" he says. But soon Katiar reveals the main reason for his preference for the BJP: "" Hinduyon ki hitayshi sarkar UP ko chahiye (UP needs a government that serves the interest of the Hindus."""
593bab077be9e0066b6f6384,Old loyalties test note 'demon' anger,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170218/jsp/nation/story_136448.jsp,2017-02-18,"Workers at a potato farm in Kanpur Farrukhabad, Feb. 17: Sushil Kumar Dikshit says the demonetisation has wounded potato farmers like him but he and his fellow Brahmins would still vote for the BJP on Sunday. Yadav farmers see the November note recall as a ""demon"" but say they would have supported the Samajwadi Party even if the demonetisation never happened. Across central Uttar Pradesh constituencies that vote in the third phase on February 19, people seem agreed that the ""note bandi"" has hurt livelihoods. But how it might affect the Assembly polls is harder to assess, with caste and community leanings appearing to trump economic logic for many. Among the few dissenters is Mehboob Alam, a small-time building contractor from Kanpur district. He insists the note recall has changed the minds of many who would ordinarily have backed Prime Minister Narendra Modi. ""Had the note ban not happened, Modi would have formed the government in Uttar Pradesh. The demonetisation has upended his game,"" Alam, 52, said at Belaur market. Dikshit said he had lost a couple of lakhs of rupees this season because the note recall had left people without cash, worsening the effects of a bumper crop. ""Last season, I sold a sack of potato (weighing 52-55kg) for Rs 600-700; this season the price fell to Rs 150-200. I couldn't recover my input cost,"" the resident of Salempur, a village of ""Pandits"" in Farrukhabad, said. But he insisted that this would have no impact on votes. ""This time, all the Brahmins will vote for the BJP,"" Dikshit said, drawing vigorous nods all around. ""We had voted for Mayawati in 2007 and for the Samajwadis in 2012. But not this time, after the way Akhilesh has neglected Brahmins."" Most upper caste voters said they would support the BJP, as did most non-Yadav backward caste farmers, while acknowledging the distress caused by the demonetisation. ""We have suffered; we couldn't recover even the labour cost. But the note bandi will prove good for the country and for everybody in future,"" claimed Sujit Kumar Katiyar, a potato farmer. A rare exception was Anil Kumar Rajput, a landowning upper caste resident of Pasningpur village in Farrukhabad. His choice of Akhilesh, however, was driven more by the chief minister's performance than any anger at the demonetisation. ""Most members of our caste say they will vote for the BJP but I'll vote for Akhilesh. He has performed,"" Anil said. Akhilesh is banking on voters like Anil with his poll slogan of "" Kaam bolta hai (work talks)"". Most Rajputs and Thakurs, though, argued that while Akhilesh may be a good man, his party's district and block-level functionaries were knee deep in crime and corruption. The Rajputs and Brahmins see the BJP as their ""natural party"" that would serve their interests if it comes to power. Reminded that the BJP under Modi was trying to transform itself into a party of the poor and backward castes, Dharmnath Dubey of Naglabag village was dismissive: ""These things have to be done to win elections."" Farrukhabad, Kannauj, Mainpuri and Etawah are regarded as Samajwadi pocket boroughs but the Brahmins there are hopeful of ""our party"" coming to power after a long ""exile"". They are banking on the Muslim vote splitting between Mayawati and the Akhilesh-Rahul combine. ""In Farrukhabad, for instance, Mayawati has fielded a Muslim and the Samajwadis a Hindu. This should split Muslim votes. This is happening across the state,"" said Bhupendra Dwivedi in Farrukhabad town. The BJP vote too risks a division in Farrukhabad, though. Manoj Agrawal, a trader whom the BJP had denied a ticket, is contesting as an Independent. Many in the BJP feel that faulty candidate selection might cost the party."

Now, even the safest of SP seats might see a tough contest.The BSP, with only six MLAs, and the BJP, with five, are trying their best to take advantage of the Yadav family feud.Sundays polling will decide the fates of Shivpal Yadav, Mulayam Singh Yadavs younger daughter-in-law Aparna Yadav, his nephew Anurag Yadav and Akhileshs aide Anurag Singh.Also in the fray are BJP leader Rita Bahuguna Joshi, who is fighting against Aparna Yadav, SP ministers Nitin Agarwal and Abhishek Mishra and BSP heavyweight Nakul Dubey.SP minister and MP Naresh Agrawals son Nitin is contesting from Hardoi while minister Farid Mahmood Kidwail is contesting from his current seat Kursi (in Barabanki). Another minister, Arvind Singh Gope is fighting to retain his Ramnagar seat in Barabanki.Union home minister Rajnath Singhs influence on the five Lucknow seats under his Lucknow Lok Sabha constituency, will come under test.The polls will also tell whether the big-ticket projects of Akhilesh Yadav government in Lucknowthe Metro, Janeshwar Mishra Park, Gomti River Frontwill convert into votes.Unlike the previous two phases, the third phase has the highest number of big fights, and figures many first-timers among the 826 candidates.The phase will be critical for both Akhilesh and Shivpal, who were locked in a bruising months-long feud for party control. The chief ministers move to replace 20 winners with new candidates will be put to test. For Shivpal, it will determine whether the leader, who is contesting the elections as a loner without any support from the party, is able to win on his own.Read | UP elections: Why a hung assembly cant be ruled out in this battleground stateThe region where voting takes place is one through which the SP governments flagship Agra-Lucknow expressway passes through. The area comprises the potato belt, and Kannaujs famed perfume industry.The usually predictable Yadav pocket boroughs of Etawah and Mainpuri and the rest of the Yadav landcomprising Kannauj, Farukkhabad and Auriyamight see close contests this time.Election machinery too would be under observation for voters turnout. Last time, the third phase polled 59.75% whereas the first and second phases this time have polled 64.22% and 65.16% votes.After Sunday, there will be four more polling daysphase 4 on February 23, phase 5 on February 27, phase 6 on March 4, and the last one on March 8.The results will be declared on March 11."

""Never have elections gone one way like this... there had been no dearth in enthusiasm of voters in all five phases,"" he said.The PM also caught UP Chief Minister on the wrong foot and cited government website to nail him.""Life in Uttar Pradesh is short and uncertain... Uttar Pradesh resembles Saharan Africa,"" Modi said quoting a para from the state government's official website up.gov.in.Modi also ridiculed Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi for his latest ""coconut juice"" remark. ""There is a Congress leader, and I want to pray for his long life... he recently went to Manipur to address an election rally. There he told farmers that he would extract juice from coconuts and send it to London. In fact, a coconut possesses water (and not juice) and it is grown in Kerala,"" he said.""It is like setting up a potato factory,"" Modi said referring to Rahul's earlier remarks that he wants to set up potato factories in Uttar Pradesh."

Susheela Devi (far right) stands with her neighbours in the village. (Below) An old Thakur house.R.V. MoorthyThe sprawling village of Kalan is set in 1,200 bighas of fertile land in the southeastern corner of Uttar Pradeshs Sultanpur district. An early spring sun filters through the trees onto the ruins of Somit Pratap Singhs hereditary home. He is supervising the building of his new home, as the mountain of bricks before which he sits suggests. Somit has just completed his MSc from the Shri Vishwanath Degree College nearby and hopes to become a primary school teacher, once the Assembly elections conclude and recruitment is resumed.Three days before polling in the Kadipur Assembly constituency (February 27), in which this village falls, we talk about the electoral prospects of the parties in the fray. Its BJP versus BSP here, he says confidently. His vote, like that of his fellow Thakurs, will go to the kamal ka phool (lotus, the BJP symbol). He suddenly rushes off and returns with a large notebook, flips it open and shows me a family tree he has drawn up painstakingly. It goes back two centuries. Its important that future generations know who their ancestors were, he stresses.The Thakurs, BJP loyalistsIndeed, pride in their heritage is a recurring theme with the Thakurs who dominate the village politically, own the largest tracts of land, and are patrons of education. Kalan has many shortcomings, but it has an array of educational options in its immediate vicinity from the government school and degree college to the swish Shivbrat Childrens Academy and an engineering college: it ensures that virtually every child here is getting an education. The last named is administered by Uma Shankar Singh, the former pradhan of Kalan, who studied at Mumbais K.C. College and the Mafatlal Institute before embarking on a 25-year-long career in textile quality control that included a stint at Subbu Textiles in Tamil Nadus Erode district.Rajendra Bahadur Singh, a primary school teacher in a neighbouring village, claims his familys arrival in these parts predates Rana Pratap  a Thakur icon  who ruled in the sixteenth century. His ancestors, he says, came as horse traders from Amer in Rajasthan, overthrew the Rajbhars who were the local rulers at the time and settled down in the village of Khanpur Pilai, less than five km from Kalan. Today, he proclaims proudly, Our clan of Kachwaha Thakurs is spread over 52 villages and the Rajbhars work on our land. But we dont have any social relations with them.Its a given that Rajendra and his family, including his elder brother who holds a PhD in sociology from Lucknow University and has done research work at Delhis Jawaharlal Nehru University, will vote BJP. It is the only nationalist party  all educated people will vote for Narendra Modi, he says.And then he adds, This time, the Rajbhars, who are traditional BSP supporters and even voted for the party in 2014, have shifted to the BJP. The reason? A brand-new Rajbhar party, the Bharatiya Samaj Party, that takes its inspiration from Raja Suhel Dev, ironically enough the Rajbhar king who was defeated by the Thakurs, has allied itself with the BJP this time.Rajbhars shifting right?In Kalan, the Rajbhars, an OBC community, are numerically larger than the Thakurs but, barring the Musahars (earlier rat catchers but now landless labourers), are the poorest in the village. Its members largely live below the poverty line. A handful are marginal cultivators not even growing enough to feed their families, while the vast majority are landless labourers here.The Rajbhar quarter in the village is a tongue of land surrounded on three sides by lush green fields of paddy and mustard. But most of it belongs to another OBC community, the Badhais, traditionally makers of agricultural tools, but whose secondary occupation is cultivation.The crowded mud hovels in which the Rajbhars live are a far cry from the well-lit havelis and whitewashed bungalows of the Thakurs, equipped with modern conveniences. Some have laid out their string beds outside their homes. To protect themselves from the elements and the mosquitoes, they have opened out used fertiliser bags and stitched them into mosquito net-like canopies for their beds.Our ancestors left us no land, says Sanichara sadly, so we work on the lands of the Thakurs and the Badhais. Rajpati and Mala join in the conversation to complain they have the  lal rang ka card  (BPL card) but dont get any of the welfare benefits that others seem to enjoy. No one cares whether we are alive or dead, says Mala. We have no proper drains or toilets, and a kucha (unpaved) road leads to our dwellings. Her nephew, Munna, is a mason who has seen a bit of life outside the village. Look at Bihar: have you seen the pitch (tarred) roads there? he says enviously. Here we were told that everyone with a red BPL card would get a free bulb, and pay Rs. 25 on electricity. But we are being made to pay Rs. 270. In the hand-to-mouth existence that they live, that makes a big hole in their meagre earnings.So has anyone come to seek your votes, I ask. Yes, says Rajpati, someone from the BSP. But when I ask who they are voting for, the women say,  Kono palan nahin (We havent decided yet). Mala adds,  Jahan public jutegi wahan jayenge (Wherever the majority is going, we will follow).Sanicharas father-in-law, Motinath, with matted long hair and a straggly unkempt beard, is more forthcoming: The cycle [the SP symbol] is looking at its community, the elephant [the BSP symbol] at its community. We are trying something new: well vote for the kamal .As I turn to leave, there is a surprise. Sanichara, Rajpati and Mala follow me. As soon as they are out of earshot distance from their menfolk, they grab my arm and whisper in my ear: We like Mayawati: we have attended her rallies in the past. We are going to vote for her. Dont you think thats a good idea?Camp BSP: the DalitsIf the Thakurs of Kalan have memories of military triumphs stretching over several centuries that gives them the self-confidence to take on the challenges of life, the BSP phenomenon has empowered the Dalits over the last 25 years. Indeed, though Akbarpur, the birthplace of the socialist leader, Ram Manohar Lohia, is less than 40 km away, only old-timers in the village have fleeting memories of him, with a statue and a few educational institutions named after him there. Instead, with BSP founder Kanshi Ram making this region  of which Kalan is a part  one of his social laboratories, it is the BSP that continues to have influence here.In Kalan, numerically too there are roughly the same number of Dalit families as there are Thakur households, adding to their sense of power. As I walk to the Dalit quarter, right at the heart of the village, this is immediately visible, especially among the women and the younger generation.Uneducated Dalits like Ramachal and his wife Usha are marginal farmers, who supplement their income by carrying bricks at building sites. But they have nothing left at the end of the month. Ramachals ailing father gets a pension, but thats about it. They complain about notebandi (the demonetisation exercise) and are a bit subdued, but their eldest child, Sonu, who is in Class XI at the local government school, is not. He says he wants to be an engine driver and see the world. His mother butts in to say sourly, Where will we get the money for the bribe? But Sonu remains cool and instead explains the Pythagorean theorem with aplomb  a tribute both to him and the school where he studies.At 17, he doesnt have a vote but clearly takes an interest in politics, for it is he who says that his parents will vote for the elephant.  Behenji [BSP chief Mayawati] ran a very good government and the BSP is our party. We are all elephants, Sonu stresses.Like Sonu, one of their neighbours, Sunita Devi, who works at an Anganwadi, has her own world view. An attractive young married woman, she is the mother of three little girls, and has studied till Class X. Modi had said ghar ghar sauchalaya [a toilet in every house], but we have no toilets yet, she says. We will vote for Behenji because she gives the most benefits. When my eldest child was born, she was in power and the government gave Rs. 1 lakh insurance for the baby. When my daughter turns 18, I can use the accrued money for her marriage.I tell Sunita I had heard that a BJP representative visited the Dalit quarter, and ask her what she thinks of the Prime Minister. Yes, Rajesh Kumar [a BJP activist] came here and said, vote for kamal ka phool. I told him we are haathi [elephant] people, so forget about it. And then she takes off on the Central government: I was expecting my third child last November and had gone to my parents home in Azamgarh district. Thanks to notebandi , my parents had such a tough time raising the Rs. 5,000 for me to have the child at a private hospital.So what does she expect of the Prime Minister? When we choose a Prime Minister, we do it in the hope that he creates a harmonious atmosphere, and works for the welfare of all the people. Then everyone will be happy. We dont expect notebandi  everyone sitting at home and crying, she says.If the Dalit women are committed Mayawati supporters, some of the men are considering other options. Ramprakash, a bus conductor who earns Rs. 4,000 a month, says, We are haathiwalen but its not necessary that we will all vote BSP. Modi has done some good work: lets try him once. His fiery young wife, Shashikala, and their neighbour, Meera, turn on him: Rubbish! He has done nothing. We women at any rate will vote BSP.And then comes another surprise. Meera says, Our grown-up sons are considering another option  Akhilesh Yadav [of the SP], because he has given cycles and laptops.The split backward voteBut Mayawati has other admirers among the backward castes. In Kalan, there are half-a-dozen homes of the Lohars, traditional blacksmiths, but who have now turned to carpentry, with many moving to Mumbai. The Lohars have some land, but it is not enough to feed them. Saroja Surajlal Vishwakarma, the young daughter-in-law of one Lohar household, is an ardent Modi admirer. But her aunt-in-law, Parvati, who lives in Mumbai and is here on vacation, hates the Prime Minister. She had to pawn her jewellery to get her husband treated after demonetisation devastated their carpentry business. Someone who begs for your votes should not oppress you. Life was best for women under Mayawati. I have been to her rallies, she says firmly.But not all communities who vote BSP have been empowered. Take Kalans only Musahar family. Ram Chander, his two brothers, and his wife Lakshmina, who suffers from a nervous disorder, live on the edge of the village. Three decades back, they lived in a small room in the nearby kasba , and would travel to Kalan for work. One day, a Thakur said that he would give them a piece of land in exchange for which they would have to make sal leaf pattals (plates) and clear away the soiled plates. Now no one eats from those plates and they do odd jobs to eke out an existence. They also have a little stall on the main road where they sell chewable tobacco, potato crisps and toffees.If the Lohars are divided, another backward caste, the Chaurasias, traditional betel growers and a community that has social relations with the Thakurs, are firmly with the BJP. Kalans current pradhan Bimla Devi was away in Mumbai to attend to her husband Chottey Lal, who is admitted in a hospital there after he sustained a heart attack. They have a thriving betel leaf and motor parts business in that city. That is evident from the imposing three-storey house they are building in the village, with tiered, carved balconies that curve around the structure.Their younger son, Krishna, who has a BSc degree, is standing in for his mother. He reels off all the improvements he has made to the village  drains, roads, electricity  and says he hopes to contest the seat when it is de-reserved. His elder brother Mukesh, who is going to sit for the entrance exams for a government job, and he are both BJP supporters. Mukesh says he likes the BJP but wishes the party would not try and divide society  also he makes it clear that reservation for OBCs must continue. But Krishna likes the party for its anti-Muslim stance: They tease our girls in Muslim-dominated areas and the SP gives them protection, he says, adding, I want Yogi Adityanath to be Chief Minister.In Kalan, however, the Muslims are a miniscule minority, no more than six families, two of whom live on one edge of the village. But the two  related to each other  have quarrelled over land, and a wall separates their homes. Tabassum is a young widow. She and her daughter live with her mother and sister-in-law. They have no land, so her brother who works in Mumbai sends home money to support them. My daughter, Saina Bano, has friends at the private school she attends, but none in the village. For much of the year, they live in splendid isolation: Most people dont know we are Muslims, so we go and play Holi, she says and then adds, We invite people for Bakrid. Yes, she will vote, she says. I hear people are voting for Mayawati. Ill do the same.Akhileshs Yadavs?The Yadavs in Kalan are predictably supporters of the SP: they are largely educated and financially on a stable footing. Sangeeta, a young housewife who also works at an Anganwadi, lives in a joint family. Her brother-in-law Rajesh has an MA degree and is looking for a job. But the family has enough land to not only to feed itself but also sell in the open market. Everyone here says they are voting SP, but it is the younger members who answer the difficult questions. The cherubic-looking Saurabh is only 16, but clearly sharper than his elders: when I ask the family what they have to say about the Yadavs cornering all the benefits, it is he who responds, measuring his words carefully: Do only OBCs walk on the roads or benefit from the ambulances and police vans? Are they the only ones who get pensions? Yes, there may be many Yadavs in the police and forces because we are a martial people. But the bureaucracy is dominated by Kayasthas and Brahmins. Why not talk about that?And then Saurabh springs a surprise. He will be of voting age by 2019 and he says: I am very impressed by Modis personality. I think many in my family will vote BJP in 2019. His uncles demur but he has let the cat out of the bag. After SP patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav came to power, through the 1990s and the 2000s, political power helped the Yadavs prosper materially and enter the middle class. Their aspirations have changed and many no longer wish to be associated with a party associated with lathi-wielding musclemen. If the advent of the polished Akhilesh Yadav has held them back, the results of the current elections could well determine the future voting patterns of the community.The cycle is looking at its community, the elephant at its community. We are trying something new: well vote for the kamal (lotus).Motinath Behenji [BSP chief Mayawati] ran a very good government and the BSP is our party. We are all elephants.sonuOur grown-up sons are considering Akhilesh Yadav because he has given cycles and laptops.Meera"

BSP chief Mayawati during an election rally.Time: 12.45 pmPlace: Inter College ground, Jagatpur, VaranasiMayawatis rally was scheduled for 1 pm, but her audience had started to come in from 10 am. Thousands of them, mostly from the eight assembly segments that make up the Prime Ministers Lok Sabha constituency, all voting in the final phase of the elections on March 8.They came on three wheelers, buses and tempos, and filled the venue in a slow, orderly fashion. Many said they were given food and transport by local village leaders.The election rallies of the BSP leader are like no other in Uttar Pradesh. They are attended by those at the very bottom of the caste and economic pyramid, and are filled with vivid images of the inequalities that lie at the heart of her Dalit politics. Of the 25,000-plus people  including over 8,000 women  at Saturdays rally, perhaps not even a hundred could be called middle class or upper class.The women were in brightly coloured synthetic saris  mostly made in Surat  paired with plastic or synthetic rubber shoes, sandals or chappals. All, old and young, wore metal jewellery with a fake silver or gold shine. Some, both men and women, munched on chana or moongfali in 50-paise packets, or a fried mixture that cost Re 1. There was drinking water  not clean  in loose plastic bags, and a vendor sold colourful icecream of a brand called Madhu. There were no public toilets anywhere near the venue.Over an hour past the scheduled time, there is no sign of Behen Kumari Mayawati. But there are no complaints, no restlessness, not even a murmur in the huge crowd. From the stage, slogans reverberate: Chalo chalein sarkar banayein, haathi wala button dabayein, BSP ki kya pehchaan, neela jhanda, haathi nishaan.Ravita (on right) at Mayawatis rally. (Express photo) Ravita (on right) at Mayawatis rally. (Express photo)It is 30 degrees, and directly in the sun sits Ravita Kumari, a 23-year-old mother of two children. She has come to listen to Mayawati with Jeevati Devi, Nirmala and Phoolmati from Jagdishpur. He husband Chhotelal, she says, has studied computtery, and has a mobile shop.Asked if she didnt feel warm in her synthetic sari, Ravita said, Hum chhoti jaat hain, suti (cotton) bahut mehenga hai.How much money does your husband give you every month?Kuchho nahin (Nothing). Rs 5 for Lifebuoy soap, a small tikiya. I use Clinic shampoo once a year. I spend Rs 2 on sindoor every month. The gold bangles Ravita wears are for Rs 70, her ring costs Rs 10, her sari Rs 150. The family has a cow, she says, which gives three litres of milk every day. But the cow eats a lot  khaati bahut hai. The family buys 500 kilos or more of bhusa every year for her.Ravitas monthly household budget is Rs 500  thats all that they have left after paying her elder sons Rs-600 school fees. I dont have Ujjawala gas (the Prime Ministers ambitious scheme to provide LPG connections to BPL households) or a toilet at home. Dont ask me why. Our village elders never keep our name in the list (for cooking gas connections). If Mayawatis government comes, we will have more money, she says.As of now, Ravitas ration card gets her 8 kg of rice and 12 kg of wheat for free, and her husband manages another 25 kg of chaawal every month. In our colony, there is no voltage, the fan hardly moves, and bulbs are like dots of light. My biceps pain because I have to draw groundwater daily. The water pump does not work properly, and the thakur in our village doesnt allow us to enter his farm to get water.(Express photo) (Express photo)There are hundreds of women like her at the rally venue, Ravita says. Except old women, all of them work on the thakurs farm, but get no money. The thakur only gives them 6 kilos of wheat every day. Those who work on potato farms are allowed to take a few kilos home. But these are green potatoes, and not of good quality. Landowners never pay us cash.Suddenly, Ravita is distracted. A chopper has appeared in the sky. The crowd rises as one. Ravita is with them, clapping.Mayawati climbs on to the stage. Ravitas eyes are moist, her face is glowing with joy. Kaisi hai? Achchi hai na? she asks.Mayawati ignores the BSP leaders on the stage and starts reading her long speech. Two parties are holding roadshows in Varanasi to occupy the second and third places in this election, she says. Narendra Modi can pray at as many temples as he likes, but he is not going to get results. This is because, she says, the BJP will never be united while I have united the Dalits, and Muslims have added to their heft.Have you got even one rupee in your accounts? Did you get a job after Modi became PM? Has even a rupee of farmers debt been removed so far? Its time to send Narendra Modi back to Gujarat, she says to huge applause.Modi ne chamchon (cronies) ko khadaa kar phoolon ki varsha karaai. He is not going to get the blessings of even his cronies. They dont show it, but they are very unhappy with him. Modis party is daagi-baagion ki party. Many men in the crowd laugh heartily.Mayawati then goes back many years, and starts to read out the history of V P Singhs government, and how the BJP, pursuing its anti-Mandal politics, had forced him to resign. Ravita and Jeevati have begun to doze, and some women start to leave. Other women in blue saris, lathis in hand, tell them to remain seated. They follow the order.On the stage, Mayawati says she has come to know from reliable sources that if the BJP comes to power, it will abolish reservation. Akhilesh Yadav is no better, she says  he is Modis nephew, because Modi considers Mulayam Singh Yadav his elder brother. The chief minister is Sa-pa (Samajwadi Party) ka babua, who doesnt know what he is talking. Now, SP ke babua ko bhabhi (Dimple Yadav) bhi nahin bachaa sakti.As Mayawatis chopper leaves, the crowd starts to move out as it had come in  in a slow, orderly fashion. Ravita comes running to this correspondent. Are you going to get me Ujjawala gas? she asks.And then, coming closer, says, Mere pati ko naukri dilwaye, mujhe gas nahin chahiye.For all the latest Elections News, download Indian Express App"
58f501e97be9e018510a1711,'Potato factory' keeps farmers in business,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170305/jsp/bengal/story_139079.jsp,2017-03-05,"Farmers cultivate process grade potato for PepsiCo in Anandapur village in Hooghly Anandapur (Arambagh), Mar. 4: Had Narendra Modi and Rahul Gandhi fought the farm-versus-factory debate over aloo (potato) in Anandapur village of Bengal, chances are that the Congress vice-president would have won by more than a wafer-thin margin. For the hundred-odd farmers working for US multinational PepsiCo, growing the right variety of potato is probably the most crucial step in a long process that culminates in factories churning out munchies. During an election rally in poll-bound Uttar Pradesh earlier this week, Prime Minister Modi had taken a dig at Rahul, who had in the past echoed farmers' demand to set up a potato factory for them. ""You are demanding a factory of aloo... but I am an Opposition leader. I can't take decisions. I can't put up an aloo factory,"" Rahul had said during his kisan yatra last year. Without naming Rahul, Modi said at a rally this week that potato grows in fields, not in a factory. ""You tell me whether aloo grows in the factory or field. You know but he does not know,"" the Prime Minister had said. But Rahul probably meant potato processing, which Pepsi is doing in Bengal. Bengal produces 112 lakh tonne of table grade potato compared with under 1 lakh tonne of process grade Growing the special process grade potato has saved at least 10,000 farmers this year from a price crash that the regular jyoti variety suffered because of a bumper crop. Compared to Rs 400 a sack (50kg each) for process potato that Pepsi is offering farmers at Anandapur in Hooghly, jyoti is selling at Rs 150 a sack from the field. That is because Pepsi had agreed on the price before the sowing season started in October. Last year, the jyoti variety had fetched a better price than the process variety. But Asim Choudhury, a farmer in Anandapur, stuck to the corporate because of his experience the year before. In 2015, he had decided to give Pepsi a break and gone back to growing the traditional variety. He lost Rs 18,000 a bigha. ""That taught me a lesson. I did not switch this year to jyoti even though there was a higher return in 2016. I have been proven right,"" Choudhury, who owns an acre, said. PepsiCo's chip factories need a potato with low sugar and high percentage of dry matter. The farmer is hoping to make a profit around Rs 18,000 a bigha on the crop he is harvesting now using a power tiller fitted with an attachment specially designed for potatoes. He has rented the machine, as he did in October last year to prepare the field and sow the seeds. The mechanical intervention, which almost turned the farm to factory, saved him at least Rs 2,500 a bigha. Chandicharan Mandal, a local handler or aggregator who has an agreement with Pepsi for cultivation of the process grade potato, had arranged the power tiller on rent with the company's help. According to Jaideep Bhatia, agri-director of Pepsi India, there are 117 such aggregators in Bengal who in turn work with farmers. Machines such as these can do in one hour what 10 people take a day to accomplish. ""The state laws do not allow direct agreement with farmers like we do in Maharashtra. Even though a direct tie-up would have been more transparent, we are not complaining. We are working with the aggregators,"" Bhatia said. Mandal said he was looking after 150 acres in the area, about 90km from Calcutta. He gets the seeds from Pepsi, arranges pesticides and fertilisers, and then gets power tillers on rent as most small farmers cannot afford to buy them. ""Working for Pepsi has proved remunerative if somebody sticks to the company for 3-4 years. Now with the big power tillers, we are trying to move towards more mechanisation. It is almost like a factory,"" Mandal said, holding a pack of potato chips sold under the Lays brand by PepsiCo in India. His only grouse? ""We want more machines. Only a fraction of land can be harvested with this one. Please tell the company to get it next year. Everyone is asking for it,"" Mandal said, pointing to the tractor which can do in one hour what 10 people take a day to accomplish. The correspondent's trip to Anandapur was sponsored by PepsiCo"

Last year, the potato market was really good. Farmers sold their yield for Rs 8-10 in the wholesale markets. This is what led to more farming of the crop this season. But that has brought us losses, lamented Ram Gopal, a farmer from Firozabad.Farmers said there isnt any provision for food processing in the state. We need some chips factories where our harvest can be utilised. Else it will all go waste, said Surendra Kumar, a farmer from Sultanpur.Farmers are queuing up at cold storages to get their potatoes stored. They are apprehensive that rising temperatures would lead to a lot of potato wastage.According to farmers, there are over 700 cold storages in UP. But as production has been good this time, these storages are likely to be full to capacity and farmers would have to sell off their produce at low prices.Farmers who manage to get their potatoes stored will be safe. But others are sure to incur huge losses. About 30% of the produce is likely to get either spoiled or farmers will be forced to sell it off for Rs 1-2 per kg, said Verma.Read more: Prepare roadmap to prevent farmer suicides, SC tells government"

Last year, the potato market was really good. Farmers sold their yield for Rs 8-10 in the wholesale markets. This is what led to more farming of the crop this season. But that has brought us losses, lamented Ram Gopal, a farmer from Firozabad.Farmers said there isnt any provision for food processing in the state. We need some chips factories where our harvest can be utilised. Else it will all go waste, said Surendra Kumar, a farmer from Sultanpur.Farmers are queuing up at cold storages to get their potatoes stored. They are apprehensive that rising temperatures would lead to a lot of potato wastage.According to farmers, there are over 700 cold storages in UP. But as production has been good this time, these storages are likely to be full to capacity and farmers would have to sell off their produce at low prices.Farmers who manage to get their potatoes stored will be safe. But others are sure to incur huge losses. About 30% of the produce is likely to get either spoiled or farmers will be forced to sell it off for Rs 1-2 per kg, said Verma.Read more: Prepare roadmap to prevent farmer suicides, SC tells government"

(PTI Photo) Representational Image. (PTI Photo)This has been a terrible year for potato farmers, with prices everywhere  from Agra and Farrukhabad in Uttar Pradesh to Burdwan in West Bengal  crashing to well below Rs 4 per kg levels. But about 10,000 growers in West Bengal have managed to realise an extra Rs 5 or so per kg, by supplying to the global snack and beverage giant PepsiCo under a contract farming initiative.Watch What Else Is Making NewsAt current rates of Rs 3.40-3.80 per kg for normal potatoes, farmers are grossing Rs 170-190 from every 50-kg sack that doesnt even cover production costs. However, some of us who have entered into collaborative farming with PepsiCo are being paid Rs 8.40 per kg. That works out to an extra Rs 230-250, compared to what we would have got by selling a sack of regular potatoes, points out Shantinath Nandi.This four-bigha (one acre) farmer from Anandapur village in Hooghly districts Goghat block under Arambag subdivision has been growing process-grade potatoes for PepsiCo for the last six years. He produces between 90 and 110 sacks of the tuber from each bigha, which gives Rs 42,000 at Rs 8.40 per kg. After deducting costs of Rs 22,000-25,000, it leaves a profit of Rs 17,000-20,000 per bigha or Rs 170-200 a sack. Had Nandi been growing ordinary table-grade potatoes, his total revenue itself would have been just Rs 170-190, not enough to take care of even cultivation costs of over Rs 200 per sack or Rs 4 per kg.The process-grade potato varieties such as Atlantic, FC3 and FC5, which PepsiCo is promoting, contain 20 per cent dry matter and 80 per cent water. Table varieties have about 85 per cent water. The lower dry matter content makes them less suitable for processing, as the extra water adds to dehydration and energy costs. Normal potatoes also have higher accumulation of reducing sugars. These, when fried, are subjected to certain enzymatic reactions, leading to their blackening. The resultant chips or fries tend to acquire a dark brownish colour, whereas ideally they should possess a light yellow hue.Shantinath Nandi, Asim Chowdhury and other farmers at Anandapur are among the many who have taken to cultivating process-grade potatoes for PepsiCo, under an arrangement where the Indian subsidiary of the American multinational undertakes to purchase their entire produce at a fixed price announced a month before planting.All they have to do is to grow the potatoes for us, says Jaideep Bhatia, director-agro at PepsiCo India.The maker of Lays and Uncle Chipps potato chips brands does contract cultivation  collaborative farming is the term it prefers to use  in Punjab, West Bengal, Maharashtra, Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh. In West Bengal, its direct farm sourcing operations are spread across nine districts: Hooghly, Howrah, Burdwan, West Midnapore, Birbhum, Bankura, Jalpaiguri, Cooch Behar and Alipurduar.In 2010, our procurement was 39,998 tonnes from West Bengal. This year, we will do 72,250 tonnes. This programme is a big success for us, claims Bhatia. He adds that PepsiCo not only provides farmers with disease-free true potato seeds produced from its laboratory in Punjab, but also tractor-drawn planters and other equipment, crop protection and extension services, cold storage and insurance facilitation.Ive been working with this company for the last 5-6 years and there is certainly increased interest among growers for this kind of cultivation, notes Chandicharan Mondal, a potato aggregator, who has brought 200-odd farmers under PepsiCos programme.But the quantities being procured by PepsiCo and other food processing majors are only a fraction of the 10 million tonnes annual potato production of West Bengal alone. While contract cultivation of processing-grade potatoes is useful, there are limits to how much these can replace the normal aloo used in day-to-day meals and table preparations. And to that extent, the woes of growers cannot be wished away.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Sure enough, this budget has done it.The subsidy bill is projected to be Rs24,000 crore, up 30% from last year. The subsidy increase has been across the full spectrum of government activities.Subsidies extended to ailing ESCOMs, which account for almost half the subsidy bill, went up by 22%. The political hot potato of making even rich Bengalureans pay more for the electricity they consume was left untouched.Food subsidy saw a massive jump of 75%. This was chiefly due to the expansion of the scope of the Anna Bhagya Scheme. A related populist move was the announcement of one Namma Canteen for each of the 198 wards in Bengaluru. This intervention will adversely impact Bengaluru's vibrant darshinis and gaadis that already cater to a variety of price points.The streak of populism entered the domain of higher education as well. Free laptops have been announced for 1.5 lakh colle ge students.Here, Karnataka has finally joined Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, and other states in extending freebies at the expense of taxpayers.In spite of all these populist impulses, the budget did not abandon all sense.For one, the allocation on long-term investment grew by an admirable 29%, including healthy increases on irrigation, flood control and water supply infrastructure.The budget speech included quite a few promising announcements. A growing state like Karna taka with an increas ingly complex econ omy needs smaller administrative units to take care of local needs. A total of 49 new taluks will be carved out of the existing 177 taluks. The state has a strong history of b re a k i n g u n w i e l dy d i s tricts like the old Bangalore rural into coherent par ts, but these usually did not involve changing taluks. The new move can be transformative.Akshara Foundation, Shikshana, Pratham and other foundations having a history of working with t h e g ove r n m e n t t o i m p r ove e d u c a t i o n a l o u t comes. In an unusual m ove, t h e C M f o u n d i t worthwhile to name them as par tners. One can be cautiously hopeful of more good ideas permeating into the broken government schooling system.T he budg et seems to mention a better focus on actual learning outcomes, which is big if implemented. That apart, English will now be a subject from class 1 in government schools in the state- a step that could potentially bring far greater equity for Kannadiga students working in a 21st century Karnataka.The writers are fellows at the Takshashila InstitutionReporting by Naheed Ataullah, Sujith John, Manu Aiyappa, Rakesh Prakash, Sandeep Moudgal, Rohith B R, Sunitha Rao, Aparajita Ray, Deepika Burli, Sreemoyee Chatterjee, Arun Dev, Avik Das.

The proposed systems biggest advantage is that it can track actual purchases by the final buyer.Buoyed by its landslide win in the recent Uttar Pradesh assembly elections, the Narendra Modi government has decided to fast-track the implementation of the direct benefit transfer (DBT) system for payment of fertiliser subsidy to farmers.From the coming kharif season, beginning June, the Rs 70,000-crore fertiliser subsidy budgeted for 2017-18 will be disbursed to companies based on actual sales to farmers captured on point-of-sale (POS) machines installed at nearly two lakh retail points across India.This would be a significant change from the current system, where firms are paid the subsidy on receipt of their fertiliser at the railhead point or any approved godown of a district. Prior to this, till October 2012, they were getting the subsidy on despatch of material from their respective factories.From kharif 2017 onwards, we are moving to disbursal of subsidy only after sale to the farmer takes place. The farmers identity will be verified through Aadhaar-based biometric authentication, voter ID or Kisan Credit Card. The sale transaction as well as buyer details would be captured in the POS machine installed at the retailers end and connected with a central server, a Department of Fertilisers official told The Indian Express.The proposed subsidy-post-sale system  as opposed to after receipt-at-district or despatch-from-plant  is already being implemented as a pilot scheme in 17 districts. They include UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanaths home district of Gorakhpur; Kishanganj and Begusarai (Bihar); Dhanbad (Jharkhand); Hoshangabad (Madhya Pradesh); Pali (Rajasthan); Nashik and Raigad (Maharashtra); Narmada (Gujarat); Krishna and West Godavari (Andhra Pradesh); Ranga Reddy (Telangana); Tumkur (Karnataka); Thrissur (Kerala); Karnal and Kurukshetra (Haryana); and, Una (Himachal Pradesh).We will have a nationwide roll-out of this system from June 1. Fertiliser companies have been given a deadline of May 31 for procurement and installation of POS machines at all the 1.98 lakh-odd registered outlets selling to farmers. All transactions thereafter will have to be done through POS machines in order to be able to claim subsidy, the official said.The proposed systems biggest advantage is that it can track actual purchases by the final buyer. A farmer growing wheat or paddy may apply up to three 50-kg bags of urea, one bag of di-ammonium phosphate (DAP) and half-a-bag of muriate of potash (MOP) per acre. That requirement could be more  say, three bags urea and 1.5 bags each of DAP and MOP per acre  for potato and sugarcane.But under the new system, it is possible to record transactions at individual farmer-level. If someone is buying 200 bags of urea, that person is more likely to be a plywood or particle board manufacturer than a farmer. Either way, he isnt deserving of subsidy.Neem-coating has already helped check illegal diversion of a highly-subsidised fertiliser towards non-agricultural use. The linking of subsidy payment to data generated at retail sale point leaves virtually no scope for diversion that is always possible from the godown or rail rake point, the official said. Nor can fertilisers be smuggled from border areas to Bangladesh or Nepal, since there will be no POS machines there for recording sales and claiming subsidy.The fertiliser industry has cautiously welcomed the proposed reform. I want this to succeed, as it is an important first step that should culminate in the subsidy being transferred directly to farmers bank accounts, which is what DBT is ultimately about, said Suresh Krishnan, managing director, Zuari Global Ltd, a leading urea and phosphatic fertiliser marketer.The industrys main apprehension is on the preparedness of retailers to accurately record not just farmers details and quantities purchased, but also the company/unit supplying the material in each case. The fact that fertiliser sales are also concentrated over just few months (June-August and October-December) of the year only complicates matters further. Add to this the possibility of the POS device not working due to network connectivity or signal strength problems, it could be a recipe for chaos during the peak agricultural season.We are also concerned over timely subsidy payment. As it is, the industry is owed Rs 40,000 crore of unpaid subsidy bills carried forward each year, entailing an annual interest outgo of Rs 4,000 crore for which there is no reimbursement. If payment of subsidy will now happen only after actual sale of material to the farmer, it will add to our working capital costs, said Satish Chander, director-general, Fertiliser Association of India.Under the proposed system, payment of subsidy is to be based on weekly settlement of claims from actual sales data captured on POS machines. The industry will be happy if it really happens that way. We have supported this scheme, so much so that the entire cost of procuring and installing the two lakh POS devices (about Rs 400 crore) is being borne by us. We only want that it should lead to the implementation of DBT in the true sense of the subsidy going directly to the farmers, said Chander.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

We are paying out of our own pocket,"" said Kuldeep Tyagi of the BKA.Earlier, in March, the West Bengal government announced a support price of Rs 4.60/kg for potatoes and promised to buy 28,000 tonnes of potatoes, after the state faced a similar situation.The BJP Kisan Morcha actively campaigned for the provision of a support price in West Bengal. It has, however, so far, refrained from a similar campaign in UP.""The situation is same in UP. Farmers are only getting about Rs 200 per sack for potatoes. While his expenditure on cultivation, transportation and cold storage is much more. So, the farmer is in fact suffering losses. The state must announce a support price on potatoes, just like West Bengal. Farmers have been suffering and the government has not bothered to do anything,"" said Rakesh Tikait, BKU president.""When we include all costs involved in production, the total cost comes to Rs 7 per kg. The farmer is getting only Rs 3-4 kg in the market. So, there is a huge discrepancy. The government should announce a support price of atleast Rs 10 per kg"", said Pushpendra Singh, President of the KSS.Farmers are also disappointed that while the BJP's Kisan Morcha raised the same issue in West Bengal, it has failed to do so in UP, where it is in power. ""Politics supersedes everything it seems. It is an issue for the BJP in West Bengal, but not so in UP because they are in power themselves"", said Kuldeep Tyagi of the BKA.The BJP's Kisan Morcha on its part assured the farmers that the issue will be raised soon, and they too will demand a support price for potatoes. ""We agree that there should be a support price. We will raise the demand soon with the newly formed government"", said Naresh Sirohi, General Secretary of the BJP Kisan Morcha."

The waiver amount includes Rs 5,630 crore loans of 7 lakh farmers whose accounts were declared non-performing assets (NPAs) by banks. In its Lok Kalyan Sankalp document 2017 for the assembly elections, the BJP had promised to waive crop loans of small and marginal farmers. During the poll campaign, Prime Minister Narendra Modi too had promised loan waiver of farmers if his party were to come to power in the state.According to government records, out of 2.30 crore farmers in the state, 1.85 crore are marginal and 0.30 crore are small farmers. The cabinet on Tuesday decided to waive outstanding crop loans adding up to Rs 30,729 crore taken by about 86.68 lakh small and marginal farmers till March 31, 2016, up to a maximum limit of Rs 1 lakh per farmer. In addition, the state government will also settle the dues of 7 lakh farmers with NPAs under a one time settlement scheme.All farmers with land holdings of less than one hectare, or 2.5 acres, will be considered marginal farmers, while those with land holdings of 1-2 hectares will be considered small farmers. The farmers were unable to repay the loans due to crop failure caused by hailstorm, drought and floods. Cabinet Minister Siddharth Nath Singh said the state government would bear the cost of the loan waiver and no financial support would be sought from the Centre. He said the state would raise the funds through the Kisan Raahat Bond.Finance Minister Rajesh Agrawal said farmers who have paid their loans will not benefit from the scheme. An eight-member committee, under the chairmanship of the chief secretary, has been set up to finalise the modalities of the scheme. Meanwhile, the cabinet also decided that illegal slaughterhouses would not be allowed to operate. Singh said the cabinet was informed that 26 such slaughterhouses had been shut down so far. The cabinet also approved the proposal regarding formation of anti-Romeo squads at police stations.The government also decided to draft a new industrial policy to increase investment in the state. A group of ministers led by Deputy Chief Minister Dinesh Sharma will visit several states like Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Maharahstra to study their industrial policies. Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya will head another committee of ministers to look into illegal mining. The committee is expected to hand in its report within a week.With the state recording a bumper wheat crop, the cabinet decided to open 5,000 wheat procurement centres across the state. While about 40 lakh metric tonnes of wheat will be procured in the first stage, the total target will be about 80 lakh metric tonnes. Along with the minimum support price (MSP) of Rs 1,625, farmers will be paid Rs 10 per quintal for transportation and loading.

""The kharif crop has suffered, potato farmers are making distress sales. We are ready to bear the pain despite our financial constraints. Let the Centre show some gesture by waiving farm loans,"" Banerjee said after the administrative meeting held at Kharagpur on Monday.According to sources, the CM's farmland tax waiver doesn't apply to the agricultural cess that applies to all landholders irrespective of their holdings. As of now, small farmers having a holding of 4 acres in irrigated areas or 6 acres in rain-fed areas have been kept outside the agricultural tax ambit. But they have to pay agricultural cess like others. The cess is likely to continue.The salaried class may fret, but the decision sounds more political than economic.

The government would finalise the financing arrangements based on the recommendations of the committee.The government's decision to purchase wheat in first phase up to 40 lakh metric tonne with a target of purchasing up to 80 lakh metric tonne is significant, it plans to do so through 5,000 wheat purchase centres.""If needed, these numbers could be increased,"" Sharma said, adding that over and above the MSP of Rs 1,625 per quintal, the government has also decided to give an additional Rs 10 per quintal as transportation and loading charges to farmers.The government decided to form a committee headed by deputy CM Keshav Prasad Maurya to study how potato farmers produce could be utilised so that they continue to grow it regularly. Other members of the panel include agriculture Surya Pratap Shahi and forest and horticulture minister Dara Singh Chauhan.Similarly, a committee headed by Deputy CM Dr Dinesh Sharma would visit other states to study their industrial policy before a new industrial policy is formulated in the state. Other members of the committee are Satish Mahana, Shrikant Sharma, Rajesh Agrawal and Nand Gopal 'Nandi'.A committee has been formed to study ways to check illegal mining. It would be headed by deputy CM Keshav Prasad Maurya and would have Suresh Khanna and Dara Singh Chauhan as members. The committee would submit its report in a week time, Sharma said. The Cabinet thanked the Central government for giving statutory power to National Backward Commission."

They have lodged a complaint at the Deccan Gymkhana police station and even moved the consumer forum.Kaustubh Dighe and Mohit Gaurav (both 22) study law at a city-based college. Kaustubh belongs to Vadodara, Gujarat, while Mohit is from Uttar Pradesh. A peeved Kaustubh told Pune Mirror, ""As I am a Gujarati Brahmin, I do not eat non-veg food. I never expected this kind of an experience at such a prominent restaurant, that too, during Navaratra, I was served a non-veg dish with pork. In fact, the restaurant served us the bill as well for the dish, which we hadn't even ordered. Both of us are law students, so we wanted to take legal recourse. We contacted student activist Pranay Ajmera and he suggested that we approach the consumer forum and file a complaint."" Both filed a complaint with the consumer forum on Monday.According to the police complaint, ""They went to the German Bakery Wunderbar on March 30 (Thursday). They ordered veg lasagna and hot chocolate for dinner, but were served a German Potato and Bacon Salad instead, by the restaurant's waiter. After having a bite, Dighe realised that the dish was not vegetarian. Soon after, a waiter came to their table again and served their original order. When they asked the waiter about the previous dish, he replied that it was non-veg and that they were served the wrong dish.""Shocked, they dialled 100 and called the police. ""The police took us to the Deccan police station and we lodged a complaint. The cops also called the restaurant manager and asked him to clarify the matter,"" Kaustubh said. Friend Mohit added, ""When we asked the manager, Gaurav Baraskar, about the issue, he misbehaved with us and replied arrogantly. That's when we called the police. When we asked Baraskar to give us a written apology, all he wrote was that the order was wrongly served.""When Mirror contacted Gaurav Baraskar, he said, ""I was not present in the restaurant at that time. A new waiter had served them a non-veg dish by mistake. The police called me and I gave them my statement."" According to the Deccan police, ""The manager apologised in front of us, but both the complainants said they will file a complaint to the consumer forum as well.""But, the owner of the restaurant, Vijay Shewale , who also happens to be a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) corporator, dismissed the charges, saying, ""This cannot happen in the restaurant. Youths often make such allegations if they don't want to pay the bill. This might also be the Opposition's ploy to malign my image.""The German Bakery Wunderbar had opened in December 2014. The cafe that also has a bar, serves health food and continental snacks."
593ba8e67be9e0066b6f604d,"Rs 30,700cr loan waiver by Yogi",https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170405/jsp/nation/story_144640.jsp,2017-04-05,"Lucknow, April 4: The Yogi Adityanath government today decided to waive harvest loans worth up to Rs 1 lakh of small and marginal farmers, three weeks after the SBI chief warned against disruption of credit discipline. An allocation of Rs 30,729 crore will be made by the state government for this purpose, said health minister Sidharth Nath Singh, announcing the decision. He told a news conference that Rs 5,630 crore worth of loans of seven lakh farmers in the state that had been categorised as NPA (non-performing assets) had also been waived. ""These loans had been taken from all banks,"" Singh said. Bankers are already grappling with bad loans worth over Rs 9.5 lakh crore on their books mainly because of loan defaults by several large corporate houses. The Uttar Pradesh government's decision, which fulfils an election promise of the BJP, has triggered fears of copycat demands from elsewhere in the country. In Maharashtra, the government is already under pressure to announce a complete farm loan waiver. Health minister Singh said there were 2.15 crore small and marginal farmers, out of a total of about 2.3 crore farmers in Uttar Pradesh. But sources said there were 86 lakh farmers with harvest loan dues of up to Rs 1 lakh. About 1.29 crore farmers would be disappointed by the first cabinet decision of the BJP government, the sources added. Former chief minister and Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav tweeted that the state government had ditched poor farmers. ""The promise was to waive total loan, not up to a limit. Crores of farmers feel cheated because of the limit of Rs 1 lakh. The poor farmers have been betrayed,"" he wrote. But BJP chief Amit Shah tweeted: ""Congratulation to Yogi Adityanath and cabinet for historic decision of loan waiver of 2.15 crore small and marginal farmers...."" Singh said it was a coincidence that the first cabinet took nine decisions on the occasion of Ram Navami, celebrated today. The cabinet reaffirmed its March 19 decision of closing ""all illegal slaughterhouses"". ""So far we have closed only 26 illegal slaughterhouses. But it has been resolved that no illegal units would be allowed to continue. Those interested may renew their licence,"" the minister said. Buffalo and goat slaughterhouse owners had alleged that the government was forcing all of them to shut their units. Srikant Sharma, the power minister who jointly addressed the news conference with Singh, said the cabinet had also decided to continue with the anti-Romeo squad. ""It is doing a very good job. But some political parties are trying to malign it. Police officers have been warned that action will be taken against them if the squad demanded identity cards from couples sitting in parks and roaming anywhere else. The innocent would not be harassed and the guilty must not be spared,"" Sharma said. The cabinet also decided to buy 80 lakh MT of wheat at the minimum support price this year and formed a three-member committee under deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya to study how potato growers could get better price for their produce. Maurya will head one more committee of three members to report within a week how to check illegal mining. A five-member panel under deputy chief minister Dinesh Sharma will study how to attract industrial investment in the heartland state through a single-window system. The other cabinet decisions include a sports complex in Ghazipur and a proposal to thank Prime Minister Narendra Modi for forming and giving constitutional status to the National Commission for OBCs."
593ba9007be9e0066b6f608a,Rahul farmer salvo,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170406/jsp/nation/story_144836.jsp,2017-04-06,"New Delhi, April 5: Rahul Gandhi today asked the BJP ""not to play politics with farmers"" by waiving loans in Uttar Pradesh alone as agrarian distress was a national crisis and the Centre should come up with a ""national"" response. Although Rahul described the Uttar Pradesh government's decision as a ""step in the right direction"", he alleged inaction by the Narendra Modi government by tweeting: ""I am happy the BJP has finally been forced to see reason. But let's not play politics with our farmers who are suffering across the country."" Contending that the Congress has always supported loan waivers for farmers in distress, Rahul said in another tweet: ""The Central Government must have a national response to the widespread distress and not discriminate amongst states."" In the context of Uttar Pradesh too, he said the relief was only ""partial"". The waivers apply to harvest loans up to Rs 1 lakh. Rahul had petitioned Prime Minister Modi seeking loan waivers for farmers of Uttar Pradesh and Punjab before the recent elections in these states. Although he has often demanded a national policy to provide such financial relief, the demand letters he submitted to the government were from the farmers of Uttar Pradesh and Punjab. The Uttar Pradesh decision is bound to have repercussions and the Congress appears to have fuelled the discontent with Rahul's response. Sharad Pawar has criticised the selective relief and exhorted the farmers of Maharashtra to intensify their agitation and ""make the life of the government miserable"". Devendra Fadnavis, the chief minister of Maharashtra which has witnessed the maximum number of suicides in recent times, was compelled to issue a statement that his BJP-led government was examining the issue of loan waivers. The Congress has also pointed to the drought in the southern states and asked the Centre not to address the agrarian crisis according to pressures of political exigencies. Rahul had recently joined the farmers of Tamil Nadu who have been protesting at Delhi's Jantar Mantar for more than 20 days. The Congress is also planning to raise the issues of farmers in Gujarat, which goes to the polls later this year. The Prime Minister had made a public commitment to waive loans of farmers in Uttar Pradesh and, at the state's first cabinet meeting yesterday, the promise has been partially fulfilled. The Yogi Adityanath government decided to waive loans worth Rs 30,700 crore while the total outstanding debt of farmers is Rs 92,241 crore. In Congress-ruled Punjab, an expert committee has been set up to prepare a proposal. The Congress, aware that Punjab's finances are in a mess, expects the Centre to step in. Chief minister Amarinder Singh has already met the Prime Minister seeking assistance for fulfilling the loan-waiver promise. Congress spokesperson Rajeev Gowda said the agrarian distress was the outcome of the policies of the Centre and a national scheme was needed to ameliorate the farmers' plight. Congress communications chief Randeep Surjewala described the Uttar Pradesh government's decision as a ""mirage"" that skipped the need for addressing the real crisis. ""There are 2.33 crore farmers in UP, of which 2.15 crore are marginal farmers. The proposal will cover barely 86 lakh farmers. The government should have waived the total debt, including term loans. Nothing was done for sugarcane and potato farmers,"" Surjewala said."

The approval is in tune with the state cabinet's decision to procure potatoes so that the farmers are not forced to sell it at throwaway prices in summer.The purchase will be made at Rs 4,870 per MT. The agriculture ministry will provide an additional Rs 1,217.50 per MT for overhead expenses such as transportation charges, mandi tax and godown charges. Purchase centres/areas will be decided by the state government in consultation with the state procurement agency.The move comes days after the UP government's decision to waive farm loan of small and marginal farmers and speed up wheat procurement drive at minimum support price (MSP) in the state.""The decision to procure potatoes is expected to provide a big relief to farmers who have, otherwise, to sell their produce at low price due to intervention of middlemen. Absence of cold chain in many parts of the state forces farmers to sell their produce within months of its harvest once temperature rises and this led them to get lower prices"", said an official.Announcing the decision, the agriculture ministry said, ""The MIS will be implemented by the state agency. The potatoes will be purchased from the cooperative societies, farmers' organisations or directly from the farmers to eliminate the possibility of middlemen taking advantage of the scheme. The state government will ensure that the produce is purchased from genuine farmers only"".It is decided that the procured stocks will be disposed of in the open market to ensure maximum realizable price. ""If necessary, this can also be sold to processing units within the state.

On Tuesday the government decided to purvchase potatoes directly from farmers in a bid to cut wastage and provide maximum monetary benefit. UP is the largest producer of potato in the country and Agra was the largest potato producing district in the country for many years till Gujarats Banaskantha displaced it this year.One of the biggest problems faced by the agriculture sector is large-scale losses of crops after the harvesting period. Farmers toil in the rain and sun only to see their hard work being wasted due to shortage of storage facilities across the country. As per a 2015 study commissioned by the ministry of food processing, quantitative harvest and post-harvest losses of fruits and vegetables ranges between 6.70% to 15.88% for fruits and from 4.58% to 12.44% in vegetables.

He retained former chief minister Akhilesh Yadavs set-up, but warned officers against laxity.He effected his first major administrative reshuffle on April 12, three weeks after taking charge, and shunted 20 senior IAS officers, putting eight of them on the waitlist. He transferred 44 IAS officers on Tuesday, the eve of his one-month completion in office.A list of his key decisions and directives:1) ASSET DECLARATION: An hour after he took oath on March 19, Adityanath ordered all ministers to declare their income, movable and immovable properties within 15 days. He asked them to submit declarations to the CM secretariat.He also made them take an oath of cleanliness and honesty.

Potato output would be around 47 million tonnes this year,"" National Horticulture Board (NHB) Managing Director A K Singh told .Initially, NHB had projected 43.88 million tonnes output for this year. But this will be revised after assessing the arrival, he said.Singh further said that total area under potato was more or less at last year's level. But, good weather conditions coupled with recent unseasonal rains just before the harvest gave boost to the crop prospect and improved yields, he said.The crop condition in Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal and Bihar -- the top three potato producing states -- is in very good condition.As per the state data, the output in Uttar Pradesh -- the country's top potato producing state -- is projected to be higher at 15 million tonnes this year as against 13.8 million tonnes last year, he added.So much potato is grown in UP that the centre has started procurement operation to ensure farmers avoid distressed sale.The output in West Bengal and Bihar is also expected to be better than last year. In 2015-16, the output stood at 8 million tonnes and 6 million tonnes, respectively, in these two states. LUX BAL"

Prices are generally lower in western UP than in eastern parts of the state.In 2016-17, the state produced a record 155-160 lakh metric tonnes of potato. Adityanath has also reached out to the Narendra Modi government for help, asking Union agriculture minister Radha Mohan Singh to impress upon other states to procure potato from UP and immediately call a meeting of state agriculture ministers in this regard. The UP chief minister also wants potato crop from the state to get prominence for procurement in the Centre's e-National Agricultural Mart.This comes after a top-level committee set up by Adityanath last week submitted a report. As per the report, potato prices in 19 key markets of UP as on April 10 vary widely between Rs 290 per quintal in Farukkhabad and Rs 690 in Lucknow.In nine mandis including seven in western UP in Agra, Saharanpur, Moradabad and Meerut, the wholesale price is less than Rs 400 while it is above Rs 500 in six other mandis including ones in eastern UP in Varanasi, Gorakhpur and Gonda.""If an arrangement is made to transport potato produce from low-price mandis to the highprice ones, then farmers can get a proper price. District collectors of these districts should coordinate, publicise the mandi prices in newspapers daily and inspire farmers to shift their produce from the low-price offering mandis to the high-price ones,"" the UP government said in an order issued on April 18."

He has done a wide-ranging research on potato and the diseases affecting it.He said Uttar Pradesh was the biggest producer of potatoes in the country amounting, to 29-35% of the total national production.Ground reports said 2016-17 saw potato cultivation in an area of 6.14 lakh hectare across the state with an expected production of 155 to 160 lakh metric ton.With the BJP having made huge promises to farmers during assembly polls, handling of the potato harvest will be the first true test of the Yogi government, especially in light of UP being the largest producer of potatoes in the country where lakhs of farmers cultivate this cash crop. Last year, thousands of potato farmers were forced to dump their crop, leaving it to rot owing to very poor price being offered for their produce in the market.To ensure that all promises are kept, the state government, based on recommendations of an expert committee, has come up with a market intervention strategy to handle the potato harvest in the state.Based on it, the principal secretary (horticulture) Sudhir Garg has shared that a scrutiny of the 19 bulk markets or mandis of the state has shown that on April 10, 2017, the bulk price of potatoes varied between Rs 290 and Rs 690 per quintal.Garg has communicated this information through a government order sent to director (horticulture and food processing department).Potato sold at Rs 290 per quintal, the lowest in the state, in Farrukhabad and at Rs 680 per quintal, the highest, in Lucknow.Further scrutiny of the markets has shown that in districts like Agra, Aligarh, Bareilly, Moradabad, Allahabad, Kanpur, Farrukhabad, Meerut and Saharanpur the bulk price of potato was Rs 400 or less per quintal on April 3, 2017. Its price was Rs 500 or above in districts like Gonda, Faizabad, Gorakhpur, Jhansi, Mirzapur and Varanasi.The order says that the government believes that timely and adequate supply of potato from low-priced markets to high priced ones can help achieve a balance in pricing that benefits both farmers and consumers.The government wants the district magistrates and the district horticulture officers to not just get the potato prices printed in local dailies but also through coordination with their counterparts of other districts facilitate flow of potato from low priced districts to markets in high- priced ones.The state government also plans to send potato to other states with support of their agriculture ministers via respective distribution agencies and marketing federations and tapping the e-NAM or e-national agriculture market.Welcome step but support price too low: ExpertExperts believe that extending support price for potato, which is the most important cash crop of UP, is a welcome step. However, they say the support price of Rs 487 per quintal is too low, especially as a bulk of the potato farmers are small scale cultivators.Out of the states total production, around 75 lakh metric ton is consumed by the people and around 7 lakh metric ton is used for processed food. Another 20 lakh metric ton is used as seed. The surplus is exported to other states and even abroad, including Nepal, said prof Pradeep Bhargava, a noted development economist.Uttar Pradesh has 1708 private and government cold storages at present with storage capacity of 130.26 lakh metric ton, amounting to 81% of the expected produce.The state government has said that till March 31, 2017, 96.49 lakh metric ton of potatoes, 74% of the storage capacity, had already been achieved.When there is a bumper harvest, the governments move will enable farmers to get at least the minimum support price. This is a welcome step. However, the support price should have been much higher so as to ensure a decent minimum earning for small-scale farmers who farm on 1 to 5 bigha land so that it justifies their investments and helps make enough money to promote farming and also support their livelihood, he added.Prof Bhargava says that on the face of it, the fact that cost of production on average is Rs 28,000 per hectare and the return is Rs 84,000 per hectare seems impressive. However, when the farmer is small scale and sells potato at a price of Rs 4.87 per kilogram earning hardly Rs 8,400 per bigha, he ends up with hardly enough to justify his investments and labour of three-four months. A better support price therefore is needed, he added."

It seems the State is not keen on taking the financial burden to protect farmers from selling their produce at distress price, Union Agriculture Minister Radha Mohan Singh told a BJP delegation from Odisha.The basic objective of MIS is to provide remunerative prices to farmers in case of glut in production and fall in prices. However, the MIS is implemented on specific request of the State Government willing to share the loss with Central Government on 50:50 basis, Singh said.It has been brought to my notice that Odisha farmers are incurring huge losses due to fall in prices of onion which is being sold at `3-4 a kg. But there is no proposal yet from the State Government for market intervention under MIS, the Union Minister told the delegation.The Uttar Pradesh Government has taken the benefit of the scheme this year to protect potato growing farmers, Singh said and added that Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu had successfully gone for market intervention under MIS last year.Stating that MIS is for procurement of agricultural and horticultural commodities which are generally perishable in nature, the Union Minister said though funds are not allocated to the States, the Centre shares the loss of farmers based on specific proposals received from them.With a bumper harvest of onion this year, the State is staring at a possible crisis of the vegetable due to lack of storage facility. As the Centre expects about six per cent decrease in onion production against last year, it has advised the State Government to take timely ameliorative measures to tackle any potential crisis in onion during the lean season.On the day, the State Government advised the Horticulture Department to give stress on informing farmers to store their produce to meet the demand during crisis time.Though the State Government is giving 50 per cent subject to a maximum of `87,500 for construction of onion storage facility under Horticulture Mission, there are hardly any takers.While a 20-tonne onion storage facility costs about `1.75 lakh, the farmers have to bear the cost to reimburse the subsidy amount later. Most of the onion growers do not have the financial capability to spend such a huge amount, official sources said."

There is no end to the problems we face. We will also join the fight,"" said Rakesh Tikait, president of the Bhartiya Kisan Union.His views have been echoed by leaders of other farmers' groups.Another faction of the BKU submitted a memorandum addressed to the prime minister to the Lucknow district magistrate on Wednesday, demanding an FIR against officers responsible for the ""unfortunate police firing"" in Mandasur and a CBI probe.They have threatened to stop supply of milk and vegetables from their villages to cities from Sunday if their demands were not met, BKU spokesman Alok Verma told PTI.The national president of the Rashtriya Kisaan Manch, Shekhar Dixit, said the Yogi Adityanath government must address the basic problems of farmers at the earliest or prepare to face a ""Mandsaur-like situation"" in the state.Taking a dig at the crop loan waiver scheme announced by Adityanath at his first cabinet meeting, he said the basic issue is of minimum support price that most farmers are unable to get.""If the Uttar Pradesh government is really serious about addressing the problems and plight of the farmers, then it must start resolving their problems lest a Mandsaur-like situation grips the state and unrest fans out,"" he told PTI.During the 2017 election campaign, the BJP had promised that if it came to power in UP, sugarcane dues to farmers owed by mills would be paid quickly. But, farmers say they are yet to get back their dues.Sugarcane Development Minister Suresh Rana, however, said that till date Rs 22,190 crore payment has been made and Rs 3,196 crore were yet to be cleared.""In future, payment will be made to farmers within 14 days of the commencement of the crushing season,"" UP BJP spokesperson Rakesh Tripathi said.Cane farmers have often complained about how mills harass them.""The mills have subsidiary businesses like distilleries. They divert profits from mills to other subsidiaries and claim losses. Sometimes we are paid in sugar, not cash,"" said Sheeshpal Rathi, a Muzaffarnagar cane farmer.Potato farmers have had to dump their produce on the streets because of the losses they faced due to bumper crops and low prices.The UP government announced on April 11 that it would buy one lakh tonnes of potatoes at Rs 487 per 100 kg.""The price did not cover cost of production. Then they bought only 1,000 tonnes. There were not enough procurement centres and too many criteria like size and shape,"" said Raj Kumar Sangwan, organising secretary of the Rashtriya Lok Dal.Low farm income is the common issue troubling farmers across the country.The MSP of wheat in 2014-15 was Rs 1,400 per quintal, and increased to Rs 1,525 for 2016-17.""There has been negligible increase in income of farmers.While all products have a maximum retail price, for farmers the government is always discussing only a minimum price,"" said Pushpendra Singh, president of the Kisan Shakti Sangh.The already dismal scenario has been worsened by the impact of cow protection vigilantes. A farmer would use cattle so long as they provided milk, and then sell them at markets to traders who would further give them for slaughter. Now, with cow protection vigilantes, the crackdown on abattoirs and the new law banning sale of cattle for slaughter, farmers are facing a severe crisis.""Earlier, a buffalo could be sold after its milching life to slaughter houses for anywhere between Rs 20,000 and Rs 45,000, depending on the weight. Now, people are scared and many farmers are not taking the risk. Due to the new law, the price of cattle has fallen, while the cost of feeding them keeps rising,"" rued Singh.Farmers in Madhya Pradesh have been protesting since June 1 demanding higher minimum support prices (MSP) for their produce including onions, arhar and moong.Their protest in Mandsaur district of western Madhya Pradesh turned violent, where five farmers were killed in police firing.The protests which began in Mandsaur spread to adjoining districts in no time and soon the issue acquired a political hue with opposition Congress calling a state-wide bandh in the BJP-ruled state.Samajwadi Party chief and former Uttar Pradesh chief minister Akhilesh Yadav announced financial assistance of Rs 2 lakh for the kin of the deceased farmers in Mandsaur incident.Yadav took to Twitter saying, ""SP will offer financial assistance of Rs 2 lakh to kin of deceased farmers.""Expressing grief over the death of ""innocent and unarmed""farmers in Mandsaur, BSP chief Mayawati accused governments in various BJP-ruled states of adopting an oppressive attitude against the poor, labourers, farmers and other sections of the society.""The BSP, especially its Madhya Pradesh unit, supports the demands of the farmers. We have full sympathy for them and also want meet the affected families. But we are feeling helpless due to the attitude of the BJP government,"" she said.""Farmers in Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Haryana have been protesting as they want a fair price. But the administration in these BJP governed states fired bullets and attacked them with sticks,"" Mayawati alleged.However, the ruling BJP said the Adityanath government was sensitive to the farmers' cause and blamed opposition parties for fuelling unrest among the cultivators.""Our government is with the farmers. This government is sensitive and stands with farmers...The first cabinet meeting of our government decided to waive farmers' loans and many more sops are on the anvil,"" BJP spokesperson Shalabh Mani Tripathi said."

There is no end to the problems we face. We will also join the fight,"" said Rakesh Tikait, president of the Bhartiya Kisan Union.His views have been echoed by leaders of other farmers' groups.Another faction of the BKU submitted a memorandum addressed to the prime minister to the Lucknow district magistrate on Wednesday, demanding an FIR against officers responsible for the ""unfortunate police firing"" in Mandasur and a CBI probe.They have threatened to stop supply of milk and vegetables from their villages to cities from Sunday if their demands were not met, BKU spokesman Alok Verma told PTI.The national president of the Rashtriya Kisaan Manch, Shekhar Dixit, said the Yogi Adityanath government must address the basic problems of farmers at the earliest or prepare to face a ""Mandsaur-like situation"" in the state.Taking a dig at the crop loan waiver scheme announced by Adityanath at his first cabinet meeting, he said the basic issue is of minimum support price that most farmers are unable to get.""If the Uttar Pradesh government is really serious about addressing the problems and plight of the farmers, then it must start resolving their problems lest a Mandsaur-like situation grips the state and unrest fans out,"" he told PTI.During the 2017 election campaign, the BJP had promised that if it came to power in UP, sugarcane dues to farmers owed by mills would be paid quickly. But, farmers say they are yet to get back their dues.Sugarcane Development Minister Suresh Rana, however, said that till date Rs 22,190 crore payment has been made and Rs 3,196 crore were yet to be cleared.""In future, payment will be made to farmers within 14 days of the commencement of the crushing season,"" UP BJP spokesperson Rakesh Tripathi said.Cane farmers have often complained about how mills harass them.""The mills have subsidiary businesses like distilleries. They divert profits from mills to other subsidiaries and claim losses. Sometimes we are paid in sugar, not cash,"" said Sheeshpal Rathi, a Muzaffarnagar cane farmer.Potato farmers have had to dump their produce on the streets because of the losses they faced due to bumper crops and low prices.The UP government announced on April 11 that it would buy one lakh tonnes of potatoes at Rs 487 per 100 kg.""The price did not cover cost of production. Then they bought only 1,000 tonnes. There were not enough procurement centres and too many criteria like size and shape,"" said Raj Kumar Sangwan, organising secretary of the Rashtriya Lok Dal.Low farm income is the common issue troubling farmers across the country.The MSP of wheat in 2014-15 was Rs 1,400 per quintal, and increased to Rs 1,525 for 2016-17.""There has been negligible increase in income of farmers. While all products have a maximum retail price, for farmers the government is always discussing only a minimum price,"" said Pushpendra Singh, president of the Kisan Shakti Sangh.The already dismal scenario has been worsened by the impact of cow protection vigilantes. A farmer would use cattle so long as they provided milk, and then sell them at markets to traders who would further give them for slaughter. Now, with cow protection vigilantes, the crackdown on abattoirs and the new law banning sale of cattle for slaughter, farmers are facing a severe crisis.""Earlier, a buffalo could be sold after its milching life to slaughter houses for anywhere between Rs 20,000 and Rs 45,000, depending on the weight. Now, people are scared and many farmers are not taking the risk. Due to the new law, the price of cattle has fallen, while the cost of feeding them keeps rising,"" rued Singh.Farmers in Madhya Pradesh have been protesting since June 1 demanding higher minimum support prices (MSP) for their produce including onions, arhar and moong.Their protest in Mandsaur district of western Madhya Pradesh turned violent, where five farmers were killed in police firing.The protests which began in Mandsaur spread to adjoining districts in no time and soon the issue acquired a political hue with opposition Congress calling a state-wide bandh in the BJP-ruled state.Samajwadi Party chief and former Uttar Pradesh chief minister Akhilesh Yadav announced financial assistance of Rs 2 lakh for the kin of the deceased farmers in Mandsaur incident.Yadav took to Twitter saying, ""SP will offer financial assistance of Rs 2 lakh to kin of deceased farmers.""Expressing grief over the death of ""innocent and unarmed"" farmers in Mandsaur, BSP chief Mayawati accused governments in various BJP-ruled states of adopting an oppressive attitude against the poor, labourers, farmers and other sections of the society.""The BSP, especially its Madhya Pradesh unit, supports the demands of the farmers. We have full sympathy for them and also want meet the affected families. But we are feeling helpless due to the attitude of the BJP government,"" she said.""Farmers in Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Haryana have been protesting as they want a fair price. But the administration in these BJP governed states fired bullets and attacked them with sticks,"" Mayawati alleged.However, the ruling BJP said the Adityanath government was sensitive to the farmers' cause and blamed opposition parties for fuelling unrest among the cultivators.""Our government is with the farmers. This government is sensitive and stands with farmers...The first cabinet meeting of our government decided to waive farmers' loans and many more sops are on the anvil,"" BJP spokesperson Shalabh Mani Tripathi said."

Onion was being sold for just Rs 1 in Madhya Pradesh till the state government stepped in to buy, potato is still being sold for 80 paise in Haryana and pigeon pea (tur dal) is fetching no more than Rs 40 in Maharashtra.The glut and plunging prices is the sum total of the crisis staring at farmers across the length and breath of the country. Last week, matters came to a head after farmers protest in Mandsaur of Madhya Pradesh turned violent, resulting in six deaths.Like everywhere else, Mandsaur farmers were agitating after they were forced to sell onions at just Rs1 a kg. The prices are well below what they fetched in 2016: Onion for Rs 1 as against Rs 7, turmeric for Rs 50, half the price in 2016, soya bean at 33% lesser than the rate in 2016 and so on.Farmers blame their plight on demonetisation and the failure of the government to impose adequate import duty on time.Farm economy runs on cash and traders say they have no money to give us. We are forced to sell the produce at whatever price they (traders) are offering, said Jasbir Mamumajra, a sunflower grower from Yamunanagar in Haryana, who blamed demonetisation for his woes.Most of the agriculture trade used to run on cash, mostly unaccounted money, and on credit. With cash being sucked out, the traders have less liquid asset to take risks. In some places they are seeking a commission of up to 2% to make payment in cash.A farm trader in Indias food bowl of Punjab, Devinder Singh, agrees, saying note-bandhi has disturbed the trade cycle. Entire trade shifted to no-credit system. It has hit us hard, he said.An agriculture expert with Bihar government, Anil Kumar Jha, said input costs such as labour, fertilisers and pesticides have gone up significantly this year. This added to the miseries of farmers, already facing cash crisis due to demonetisation.Maharashtra farmers, who were first to protest after prices of pigeon pea (tur dal) fell, blamed the Centre for not imposing high import duty on pulses.The production cost of the tur per quintal is more than Rs5,000 for farmers. With the Union government allowing the import of lentil at Rs 3,700 a quintal, the farmers are not likely to recover their cost, said Vijay Jawandhia, farm activist and Shetkari Sangathana leader.Same was the complaint by farmers in Haryana, who have been forced to sell sunflower at Rs 2,500 per quintal as against the minimum support price of Rs 3,950 even though the cost of seeds have increased by almost 50% in 2016.We could have been saved had the government increased import duty on edible (palm) oil, said Balwinder Singh, a Karnal-based farmer. However, state government officials blamed poor quality for the low price.In Asias largest grain market in Khanna, Punjab, the prices of maize have plummeted with traders like Sanjeev Kumar saying the farmers are bearing the brunt. In Uttar Pradesh, farmers sold wheat at less than the minimum support price, saying government agencies were not willing to buy the produce because of the record production this year.Wholesale traders in Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh said the prices of onion, tomato and potato have crashed.The per quintal wholesale prices of the onion in Maharashtra was down to Rs 600-800 from Rs 1,000-1,250 in 2016. Potato in Haryana was sold at Rs 80 a quintal on Tuesday. Farmers sold onion for Rs 1 in Madhya Pradesh after which the government announced a procurement price of Rs 8 per kilogram.P Chengal Reddy, founder-chairman of the Consortium of Indian Farmers Associations (CIFA), said: The Centre takes into consideration the average production of past three years and not the current years production cost, in deciding the MSP. If it continues, time is not far when farmers across the country will revolt, he said.(With inputs from state bureaus)"
5a038f4b9855b76bf13b7f6b,5 Farmer Suicides In 2 Weeks Despite Uttar Pradesh's Loan Waiver Scheme,http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/5-farmer-suicides-in-2-weeks-despite-uttar-pradeshs-loan-waiver-scheme-1712789,2017-06-15,"Farmer Shiv Kumar's family said he had lost money on a substandard crop.There have been five instances of farmers suicides across Uttar Pradesh last two weeks. In all five instances, the families of those who killed themselves said the farmers were under heavy debt - from government institutions and private money lenders. Two of the suicides have happened in Kanpur district, and one each in Mahoba, Banda and Kaushambhi. The government has ordered inquiries into the suicides.The spate of suicides come after the state's BJP government, led by Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, waived off loans to the tune of Rs 35,000 crores in April. The waiver was part of the BJP's promises in the run-up to the state assembly elections. However, there is confusion among farmers over which loans are covered by the scheme, and which are not.""This government does not have a framework. They did not say whether there would be a limit or a condition to the waiver"", said Samajwadi Party's Basudev Yadav, who was sent by former Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav to visit the Dwivedi family in Kaushambhi.The state's deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya hit back at the Samajwadi Party.""SP is doing vendetta politics. We are committed towards working for the farmers and the loan was waived in the first cabinet meeting,"" the minister said.At Kaushambhi's Bakhtiyara village, 60-year-old Ram Babu Dwivedi committed suicide on Wednesday morning. The potato farmer recently received a loan recovery notice from a local cooperative. He had accumulated over seven lakh rupees as loan from government banks and crop worth 300 quintal rotted away in his fields.""I used to ask him about the loans but he would always say that he would take care of it,"" said Devendra, Ram Babu's son.Yesterday, a farmer in Kanpur, Shiv Kumar, died at a Kanpur hospital. He had consumed pesticide three days ago.His family has said Mr Kumar had lost money on a substandard crop after taking a loan of a loan of 70,000 rupees. His meagre earnings supported his wife, and four young daughters.""In his condition, 60 - 70 thousand rupees was no less than 6-7 lakh rupees,"" said his younger brother Ravi Shankar, also a farmer.Neighbouring Madhya Pradesh has been witnessing violent protests by farmers who are demanding loan waivers and better prices for their crops. The protests abated this week after the government announced some relief this week and paid a compensation of Rs 1 crore to the families of each of the six farmers killed in Mandsaur on June 6. Prohibitory orders have been lifted from Ratlam today - a day after they were lifted from the epicentre of the protests in Mandsaur."

Apart from the natural calamity of drought, there were man-made calamities, and this column is about how the two have brought about the explosive situation in the country.Farmers agitations are spreading across many states. It is the culmination of the acute distress in the farm sector that many observers have written and spoken about in the last two years. Two years of drought in many states was the main cause. The governments cannot be blamed for the occurrence of drought, but governments are solely responsible for the mismanagement of the consequences of drought. Apart from the natural calamity of drought, there were man-made calamities, and this column is about how the two have brought about the explosive situation in the country.The bulk of farmers in India have no choice but to do farming. Land is the only asset they have, farming is the only skill they possess, and unless they grow food many of them will face starvation. Agriculture, despite its declining share in total output (GDP), is also the largest employer. In Indias economy, the agriculture sector has primacy.The Price of NeglectUnfortunately, the NDA government lost sight of this basic truth. The agriculture portfolio is the Cinderella of this government. The Minister of Agriculture, unchanged since May 2014, is a political lightweight with little clout within the government. (How many of you can name Mr Sharad Pawars successor?). The minister has been neither seen nor heard by most people. The only memorable statement on agriculture that I can recall was when he repeated the Prime Ministers promise to double farmers income in 6 years and when asked if they had meant real income or nominal income, there was deafening silence.On the other hand, the government erred grievously on the issue of minimum support prices (MSP). In its manifesto and in the election campaign, the BJP had unequivocally promised that it would implement the M S Swaminathan Committees recommendation that MSP should be cost plus 50 per cent. In government, the BJP not only reneged on its promise, it dealt a body blow to farmers by denying them even a reasonable increase in MSP in its first three years. The numbers speak for themselves:The ostensible reason for denying a fair MSP was that higher MSP fueled inflation, which is partly true, but to lean in favour of inflation control against the interest of Indias farmer-producers was the height of folly. Some inflation is inevitable, and the government and the RBI must use other instruments to moderate inflation rather than reduce the farming community to penury.Errors galoreThe second grave error was demonetisation. Mr Harish Damodaran has convincingly demonstrated how demonetisation has crippled the post-harvest agricultural economy (see The Crops of Wrath, Indian Express, June 12, 2017). Agricultural products are bought and sold largely in cash. Demonetisation dried up liquidity and prices have crashed. According to Mr Damodaran, never before have prices of tomato, potato and onion crashed at the same time. Same is the situation with soyabean, arhar, garlic, methi (fenugreek) and grapes. Saying that farmers have resorted to fire sales, Mr Damodarans conclusion is, We have entered deflation territory in farm produce, whose proximate trigger clearly has been demonetisation.The third error was when the Prime Minister announced, on behalf of the yet-to-be-elected Uttar Pradesh government, that all farm loans in UP will be waived if the BJP formed the government. More likely, it was just an election promise in a state that the BJP perhaps did not expect to win, but it was an unequivocal promise that has returned to haunt the BJP in several states. Farm loan waivers are neither intrinsically good nor bad. As Dr M S Swaminathan said a few days ago, Loan waivers, though temporarily necessary, do not provide for a secure long term credit system (emphasis supplied). When farmers do not get a fair and reasonable price and are unable to repay their loans, they demand a loan waiver. The holder of the highest political office promised a total loan waiver, why blame the farmers for demanding that the promise be implemented?In February 2008, the fiscal situation was excellent, growth had found a new momentum, and a one-time loan forgiveness to small and medium farmers was justified. The central government was confident it could fund the waiver and so it went ahead and announced it. In 2017, however, every prudent norm was turned on its head. The Prime Minister promised a loan waiver on behalf of an yet-to-be-elected state government, no one seems to have examined the capacity of UP to bear the burden, and no one seems to have factored the fallout in other states. Having mounted a tiger, the BJP does not know how to dismount it. Meanwhile, the tiger is galloping through Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Punjab, Haryana, Maharashtra and Gujarat.Jobless youth angryThe last straw was jobless growth. Young men can find no work on farms or off farms. Micro, small and medium businesses are not offering new jobs. Tier 2, 3 and 4 towns are full of jobless youth and their anger has turned against the central government. The BJP will not admit its mistakes. Nor will any BJP leader tell the Prime Minister that mistakes were made. Will the Prime Minister pull a rabbit out of the hat?

5a05169b9855b76bf13bf9e6,Farm protest rages across India,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/617965/farm-protest-rages-across-india.html,2017-06-18,"Devinder Sharma, Jun 18 2017, 1:06 ISTAgrarian crisis: Only a holistic, pragmatic policy can end the tragedy unfolding in rural areas since decadesFarmers anger is spilling over. The violent agitation that erupted in the Malwa belt of Madhya Pradesh, resulting in the death of five farmers in police firing, has now spread to Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Gujarat and Chhattisgarh. The demand for farm loan waiver, accompanied by higher crop prices, is now gaining momentum.More than 3.18 lakh farmers have committed suicide in the past 21 years. Every 41 minutes a farmer commits suicide in the country. While I agree that farmer suicides are a symptom of a bigger malaise that afflicts agriculture, policymakers have failed to take the massive death toll as a sign of terrible economic depravity that plagued the rural landscape. How long could we expect farmers to take the hit silently? It had to happen one day, and no one knew what will trigger it.For nearly three decades, more so after the economic reforms were ushered in, agriculture has been a victim of neglect and apathy. Following the World Banks prescription of moving 400 million people from the rural to the urban areas by the year 2015, successive governments deliberately created conditions to turn farming unviable, thereby forcing an increasing number of farmers to abandon agriculture and migrate to cities. To keep food inflation under control, farmers have been routinely paid less, not even to cover the cost of production, thereby driving them against the wall.With each passing year, the crisis worsened. The 2016 Economic Survey tells us that the average annual income of a farming family in 17 states, roughly half the country, is a mere Rs 20,000 or less than Rs 1,700 a month. Such a dismal income, merely enough for subsistence, was the outcome of economic policies over the years. I shudder to think how these farming families must be surviving all these years. After all, it is not even possible to rear a cow in less than Rs 1,700 a month.But I doubt if such details mean anything to mainline economists and policymakers. With the markets crashing after every harvest, and with the government reluctant to save farmers by ensuring that they get at least the Minimum Support Price (MSP), farmers are pushed deeper and deeper into a never-ending cycle of debt. Even the MSP is often less than the cost of production. In Maharashtra, the production cost of tur dal has been worked out at Rs 6,240 per quintal. The MSP was Rs 5,050 per quintal, but the price at which farmers were able to sell tur, and that too after waiting for nearly a week in the mandis, was between Rs 3,500 and Rs 4,200 per quintal.Take another case. A farmer in Haryana toils hard for three months, putting all his labour to reap a bountiful harvest of potato only to find the prices crashing, thereby forcing him to sell 40 quintals of potato for just 9 paise a kg. The shock often turns fatal. But the fact remains that the government has rarely come to his rescue. Compare this with the fall in stock markets, and the finance minister promises to monitor the crisis on an hourly basis, holding a press conference to assuage the investors. Have we ever seen the finance minister or the agriculture minister monitoring the deplorable condition when farm prices crash?The poor farmer has been left to live in indebtedness, which keeps multiplying with every passing year. The crisis is compounded by the denial of a rightful income to farmers for their produce. To keep food inflation under control, it is the farmers who have paid the price. In reality, it is the farmers who have been subsidising the nation all these years. Successive governments have therefore deliberately kept agriculture impoverished. An estimated 58% of the farmers go to bed hungry every night.After Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath announced a farm loan waiver worth Rs 36,359 crore, which will benefit 92 lakh small and marginal farmers, Maharashtra announced a loan waiver worth Rs 30,500 crore. Punjab is expected to take over at least Rs 30,000 crore of the bad loans. Though I am not in favour of loan waivers but in a deplorable situation that agriculture has been pushed into, a waiver is a short-term relief.It is an emergency measure to bail out millions of small and marginal farmers in distress. IndiaSpend estimates a total of Rs 3.1 lakh crore of farm loan that needs to be waived. This is still far less than the Rs 4 lakh crore bailout package that the telecom industry alone is seeking. Another Rs 1.7 lakh crore of bad debt is what the steel industry hopes will be written off.Holistic approachLoan waiver must be followed by policies that ensure loans dont pile up again. A tinkering here and there is not going to address the crisis. It needs a holistic approach and a paradigm shift in economic thinking.To begin with:The effort should be to make farming economically viable.The Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices, which works out the MSP for crops, should be directed to factor in four allowances being paid to farmers  house allowance, medical allowance, educational allowance and travel allowance. So far, MSP only covers the cost of production. Government employees get a total of 108 allowances.Since MSP benefits only 6% of the farmers, it needs to be understood that the demand for providing 50% profit over MSP will benefit only these 6% farmers. For the remaining, who are dependent on the exploitative markets, the need is to set up a National Farmers Income Commission, with the mandate to provide a minimum assured monthly income package of Rs 18,000 per farmer family.Public sector investments must come in urgently for constructing Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee mandis and also for storage godowns. At present, there are only 7,700 APMC mandis. What India needs is 42,000 mandis for every 5 km radius. And like in Brazil, where it is mandatory for a market yard to procure anything a farmer brings, APMC mandis should be equipped to do the same.(The writer is a commentator on issues relating to farmers and agriculture)"

Little had he thought that the issue would gather momentum just five months down the line and force the Narendra Modi government to consider loan waiver for small and marginal farmers.In a way, the demands for farm loan waiver could be BJPs own doing. Maharasthra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, who had been steadfast in his opposition to a loan waiver, admitted that he was forced to announce writing off debts of small and marginal farmers due to immense pressure from the farmers whose expectations had risen manifold following similar moves by Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana.The Congress had already raised the pitch for farm loan waiver with vice president Rahul Gandhi undertaking a month-long kisan yatra across Uttar Pradesh in September last year. Though the yatra did not benefit the Congress politically, it did raise expectations of the farmers. The BJP too responded by mentioning farm loan waiver for small and marginal farmers in its manifesto for Uttar Pradesh.Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in his election rallies, went to the extent of saying that the BJP government in Uttar Pradesh will take a decision on farm loan waiver in its first cabinet meeting. The pressure on the Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath for announcing the loan waiver was telling as he kept delaying the meeting of the cabinet that usually takes place within hours of the new government assuming office. The council of ministers met a couple of times informally as bureaucrats put together proposal for the loan write off for the cabinet to consider in its first meeting.The announcement by the Uttar Pradesh government led to demands for a farm loan waiver from other states such as Maharashtra, Karnataka, Uttarakhand, Tamil Nadu among others. Maharashtra bowed to the demands from farmers and declared a farm loan waiver for needy farmers. The state government put stringent conditions to exclude well-off farmers from the loan waiver scheme to limit its expenditure.As soon as Maharashtra announced its farm loan waiver, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley made it clear that the state government will have to fund the initiative from its own resources and not expect any bailout by the Centre. The Punjab government became the third state to announce a farm loan waiver for small and marginal farmers on June 19, a promise made by the Congress during the poll campaign in the state. In a bid for political one-upmanship, Chief Minister Amarinder Singh also announced loan waiver up to Rs 2 lakh  double than what has been offered by UP and Maharashtra.At the heart of the crisis is absence of remunerative prices for farm produce. In simpler terms, a person dependent only on agriculture as a means of livelihood finds it difficult to make both ends meet as he does not earn enough. As prices of pulses, fruits and vegetables shot up during the past two years due to drought, the government had put in place stringent curbs on exports and stockholding by traders. The same were not eased after a spell of good monsoon led to bumper production.The glut of pulses and onions saw farmers making a beeline to market yards to sell their produce leading to a sharp reduction in procurement prices. In Maharashtra, stagnant milk prices had irked farmers who threw milk on the roads instead of selling it to dairies. In Uttar Pradesh, potato growers threw their produce on roads as wholesale prices dipped on account of better production. Similar was the case with onion growers in Madhya Pradesh.The simmering discontent among farmers in Madhya Pradesh led to protests in Mandsaur where six farmers were killed in police firing on June 6. Things took a political turn as leaders made a beeline to Mandsaur to express solidarity with farmers.Delicate issueIn both Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh, the governments hastily reached out to a section of favourable farmer leaders, agreed to some of their demands and called off the strike. Such handling of a delicate issue further angered the farmers who looked towards leaders such as Shiv Kumar Sharma alias Kakkaji in Madhya Pradesh and Raju Shetti in Maharashtra to take their struggle to a logical conclusion.While Sharma heads the breakaway faction of the RSS-backed Bhartiya Kisan Sangh, Shetti leads the Swabhimani Shetkari Sangathan in Maharashtra. Sharma was thrown out of the BKS following his frequent run-ins with Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan. Shetti, a Lok Sabha member from Hatkanangale near Kolhapur, is part of the NDA but is increasingly disillusioned with Prime Minister Narendra Modis farm policies.Shetti believes that Modi has lost the script when it came to tackling the agrarian distress as the government, instead of addressing pressing issues such as remunerative prices, was busy pursuing soil health cards. His consistent demand  Modi should fulfil the poll promise of implementing the M S Swaminathan Committee Report that has recommended a 50% margin over the cost of cultivation incurred by the farmers.Farmers were already operating on thin margins, which have dipped even further over the last three years. The poll promise on MSP has remained just that  a promise, with neither the agriculture minister nor the prime minister making any reference to it. The much-touted agri-market reforms too have floundered and so has the flagship programme to provide irrigation facilities to every farm. As many as 23 of the 99 delayed irrigation projects were to be completed by March 2017. The government has missed the deadline.On the political front, the strain on the NDA is showing. Modi had run a tight ship since coming to power in 2014, but allies such as Shiv Sena and Shettis Swabhiman Paksha have been growing restless and have raised a banner of revolt. The agriculture sector is desperately seeking new vigour and fresh leadership to pull it out of the crisis."

Addressing a press conference in Lucknow, UP state Congress vice president Sataydev Tripathi and spokesperson Akhilesh Pratap Singh released a parallel booklet titled 100 din, 100 fareb (100 days, 100 lies).While speaking to the media, Tripathi said, There has been a four-fold increase in crime and the promises of putting all criminals behind bars now appear laughable. Roads have not been made pot-hole free by June 15. Apart from this, the proposal to buy potato at the rate of Rs 487 per quintal too has proved to be a big flop. The Congress spokesperson also added that despite innumerable reminders by the chief minister to his cabinet and senior officials regarding the disclosure of their personal asset, still more than half of them are yet to submit the details.Congress termed UP governments initiatives as farce such as reducing fees of private schools, distribution of free laptops, 24 hours power supply, power-for-all, anti-Romeo squads, womens safety, Gaupalak Yojana, rural employment, anti-land mafia task force, cleaning of river Gomti and an anti-corruption task force.Earlier in the day, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath addressed a press conference on completion of its 100 days in office, and released a booklet called 100 din vishwas ke on his governments performance since he assumed office on March 19. The chief minister expressed satisfaction over the tasks his government undertook in its first 100 days in office.

5a0dbaa99855b76bf13d115c,Demonetisation and visible hand of market,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/621860/demonetisation-visible-hand-market.html,2017-07-09,"Demonetisation and visible hand of marketKaushik Basu, International New York Times, Jul 9 2017, 23:59 ISTlong term side-effects: Demonetisation failed to do what it was supposed to do, and although the immediate disruption it caused was less severe than feared at first, the policy's impact is turning out to be more protracted than initially expected. nytIn 1776, Adam Smith described the power of the markets invisible hand. Although some economists have since overstated this power, dismissing the role of government regulation, its true that the market, when left to itself, often manages to meet a societys economic needs in ways that no one fully understands. Its a mistake for the state to disrupt it wantonly and for bureaucrats to try to do its job. And thats just the mistake India made last fall.On November 8, 2016, the NDA government suddenly declared that as of midnight that night all bills in denominations of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 would cease to be legal tender. Demonetisation, as the policy is called, applied to 86% of the value of all currency in circulation. It was a state intervention of historic proportion.The goal, the government said, was to eliminate fake Indian currency notes, force people to bring out wealth they had hidden to avoid paying taxes on it  so-called black money  and help India switch from cash to digital money. To counter the criticism that erupted, the government later pointed to other countries that had adopted similar measures in recent times, including Iraq, North Korea and Venezuela.Nearly eight months later, a lot of data is now available to help us assess what demonetisation has actually wrought. Here it is, in a word: demonetisation failed to do what it was supposed to do, and although the immediate disruption it caused was less severe than feared at first, the policys impact is turning out to be more protracted than initially expected.Very little black money has been caught. The truly corrupt hold their black money not as money at all, but as real estate and bank balances abroad. The government had authorised people to trade in up to Rs 4,000 in the cancelled notes, so some parcelled their Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 bills into small bundles and got multiple agents (money mules) to change them, no questions asked. The governments freshly minted Rs 2,000 notes promptly became the new stash currency of choice.In the first weeks, even months, following demonetisation, there was visible chaos. Soviet-era-style queues snaked in front of banks and ATMs. The informal sector  mostly small traders, farmers and small unregistered businesses, which often dont have bank accounts  reeled from cash shortages.But the immediate damage caused, though large, was not as large as some of us had feared. GDP growth in the last quarter of 2016 was 7% and manufacturing activity continued to grow. On the other hand, there may be greater long-term side effects than expected.The problems appeared unexpectedly, when agricultural products arrived on the market. In January, with cash shortages in full swing, demand plunged and food prices collapsed. By February, potato prices in Uttar Pradesh were just over half of what they had been during most of 2016 (at around Rs 350 per quintal, instead of over Rs 600 per quintal).Tomato prices were less than one-third. Onion prices in May were half of what they had been a year before. The cost of onions in India is notoriously volatile  and often influenced by politics and elections  but the likeliest culprit for this years drop was demonetisation.The outcome was curious: Widespread suffering in the midst of plenty. Incomes crashed and distress mounted among farmers, a group in India already affected by high suicide rates because of mass indebtedness. And the downturn has hit more than the farming sector.The Indian economy was on a good trajectory until last year, and the government deserves credit for that. It had taken major steps to cut the costs of doing business and unify taxes on goods and services. With, in addition, the drop in world oil prices (which meant huge savings for India, an oil importer) and the rise of labour costs in China (which made Indian manufacturing and exports more competitive), there was every reason to believe that the Indian economy would soon get back to where it was before the 2008 world financial crisis: growing at over 9% per year. Instead, Indias growth in the first quarter of 2017 was 6.1%, down from 7.9% in the fiscal year 2015-16.Telltale signsAn economy is a complex machine, and there is no way to be absolutely certain that the cause of all this is demonetisation. But there is a telltale sign: Much of the slowdown originated in the financial sector. Rural loans increased by only 2.5% between October 2016 and April 2017, compared with 12.9% a year before. The rate of growth in overall bank credit declined.The growth in industrial output in April was a paltry 3.1%, down from 6.5% the previous April. In the first quarter of 2017, the construction sector actually shrank, by 3.7%, over the previous quarter.All this augurs poorly for the months to come: as the agriculture sector slows down in response to low crop prices and the credit shortage begins to bite, overall growth will likely fall further. The state-engineered shock of demonetisation will continue to course through the economy.Demonetisation did boost the use of digital money, which is more efficient than paper money. But the government didnt need to put 86% of the currency out of circulation to achieve that. Demonetisation was too coarse an approach, and it accomplished too little while causing too much collateral damage.Indias economy has enormous strengths  such as high rates of savings and investment  and this crisis will pass. But just as sailors heading to sea disregard the winds and waves at their peril, economic policy makers cannot ignore the laws of economics, and intervene in the market with a blunt and heavy hand, without risking shipwreck.(The writer, the C Marks Professor of International Studies and professor of economics at Cornell University, was chief economic adviser to the government in 2009-12 and chief economist of the World Bank in 2012-16.)"

But more importantly, where do you think you are going to raise the Rs 36,000 crore required for loan waiver because you claim to have inherited empty coffers from the previous government?As you would have noticed, this government has cut down on wasteful expenditure. We are going to save every penny that was wasted before. You would get a sense from our first budget.But as far as bad economics goes, the per capita income of farmers in UP was amongst the lowest. Hit by vagaries of nature and penury, they required this help. I understand loan waiver may not be a permanent solution. A lasting benefit can come to farmers when they become financially secure. Thats why PM Modi has already talked of doubling farm incomes by 2022.Would you be able to raise the mammoth amount required for the loan waiver just by cutting down on wasteful expenses?Thats one of the ways. You would have noticed how the previous government wasted public money as the cost of various projects kept on escalating beyond reasonable limits. The Gomti River Front Development project is a case in point. We have stopped all such frivolous expenses.There is a view that instead of loan waiver, you could have given assistance to farmers more by helping them tap technology for better gains?UP is an agrarian state where 78% of the people live in rural areas that have about 2.33 crore farmers. Thats a huge number. Along with the waiver, we are also trying to provide them better seeds and fertilisers. You would have noticed that this year a record 37 lakh metric tonne potato procurement was done and Rs 5900 crore directly transferred to the bank account of farmers. This is unprecedented.But hasnt loan waiver created problems for other BJP-ruled states from where demands to waive off loans are now being raised? More importantly, the Centre has now said it wont foot the loan waiver bills and the states would have to raise the amount itself.The Centre had made its stand clear from day one. It would be unfair to compare UPs situation with other states where farmers are much better off. This loan waiver was required under special circumstances for UP farmers whose per capita income was much below the national average.By when do you think would your government be able to roll out its loan waiver promise?A. Within this year itself. A three-layered committee to execute the loan waiver project has been set up. After verification from banks and revenue department, we would be in a position to roll out the waiver.What do you make of the criticism that Rs 1 lakh cap on waiver cheated many farmers with bigger farm loans?We did the best under limitations.Tell us about things that we are going to see over the next three months?A lot is happening. But if you want quick list here it is. We intend to open 20 more Krishi Vigyan Kendras or Agriculture Science Centres for which in principal clearance has been obtained from the Centre. Forty-three soil testing laboratories too would come up in different districts. Our aim is that by March 2018 all farmers should have a soil health card, which we have reworked to ensure that average farmer is able to understand it better."

Based on central government norms, we have decided to distribute Rs 205 crore among farmers in 11 districts, including Burdwan, the worst affected. Nearly 2 lakh marginal farmers will be benefited. The file has been sent to the CM and we hope the compensation will arrive soon,"" said state agriculture minister Purnendu Basu . The beneficiary will be those farmers who have lost 33% and more of their crop to inclement weather.The announcement was made on the day when knives were out for the BJP government over the farmers' killings in alleged police firing at Mandsaur in Madhya Pradesh.Doling out of compensation isn't new in Bengal given that back in March 2015, to ease a crisis in potato cultivation, the state announced that 50,000 metric tonne of the crop would be directly procured from farmers in eight major potato-producing districts at the rate of Rs 5,500 per metric tonne and Rs 550 a quintal.The government then distributed them to schools for mid-day meals and ICDS beneficiaries at the rate of 1 kg per head per week.Till April 21, 2015, 20,000 metric tonne potatoes were procured and farmers were paid. The same year chief minister Mamata Banerjee requested the Centre to waive the crop loans to potato growers for the 2014-15 season and to arrange for fresh loans for the ensuing Kharif season.Since 2011, the Mamata Banerjee government, said sources, had been distributing agricultural input subsidy worth Rs 1,336.43 crore among 32.83 lakh farmers for damage of crops due to natural calamities under State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF).Faced with disquiet in their states, the governments in Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and now, Uttar Pradesh, have also adopted the route, though they have apparently not been able to reign in the crisis yet."

They were joined by farmers from U.P., Tamil Nadu and Punjab.Shiv Kumar Pushpakar, ReutersI wish no parent does what my father did to me. At least think about your children before you decide to end your life, said 13-year-old Pallavi Pawar with an unmoved expression on her face and resolve in her voice.It was around a decade ago that Pallavis father, a farmer in Maharashtras Jalgaon, decided to commit suicide, leaving behind his wife and four children. Ever since, Pallavis mother has been working on other farms to make ends meet.Memories flash byI dont remember his face clearly, but there are moments that flash before my eyes. There are memories I have of my father when he was happy, when he didnt show the turmoil brewing inside him. Looking at my mother and sisters today, I think he should have discussed things with his family. There is always a way out, she said.Pallavi was one of the over 40 children and widows of farmers from drought-hit Maharashtra who had gathered at Jantar Mantar on Wednesday. They had joined the ongoing Kisan Mukti Yatra, as part of which farmers have demanded loan waivers and fixing of standard prices for their produce.Children dressed in white narrated tales of personal grief as placards reading Suicide is not the answer, Save our farmers, Farmers, dont commit suicide stood tall.The stories of these families were a grim reminder of how farmer suicides in India might just be numbers for city dwellers, but are harsh reality for children and women living in the rural belt  something they see almost everyday because of government apathy.Dont bargainWhen you buy vegetables and fruits from a farmer, you are quick to bargain for even Rs. 1. What you dont realise is that this Rs. 1 can be the difference between his children eating dinner or going to bed hungry, said Pallavi as she broke down.She continued, You will never know how much the heart of a father pains when he has to disappoint his children everyday; till one day he cannot bear it any longer and decides to end everything.Many such children who have lost their fathers stay at an ashram in Nashik, away from their homes, because their families cannot afford their upbringing.Little did three-year-old Sanju, who was guarding an earthen pot covered with a red cloth and playing with other children around, realise that the pot contained the ashes of his father who had hung himself two weeks ago after local money lenders started threatening him to repay a loan of Rs. 50, 000.Farming is riskySanjus uncle Raghu Ram, who was accompanying him, said that he was too young to realise the gravity of the loss. He couldnt help but point out how Sanjus entire life would be affected by the death of his father, who was the sole breadwinner for their family of eight.Farming is becoming a risky job. We do not want our children to live the lives that we are living. The government should think about the children and their future and do something to save our lives, he added.Eight-year-old Hari from Solapur said that he wants to be an engineer and help his mother escape the life of poverty.My mother tells me that if I study well I can help our family build a big house and buy a car, he said.Farmers from Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Punjab had also joined the protest with sacks of potatoes, demanding fair prices for their produce.We make a profit of Rs. 5 after selling a sack of potatoes. How can we feed our families and afford a basic living with this?

There was a glut since the produce could not be sent to other states because of heavy rains, so their prices went down. Also, these vegetables don't have a long shelf life, so vendors are selling them for less.Housewife Pooja Rastogi said, ""The hike in prices of tomato and potato is pinching most as there is hardly any dish one can make without these two. I have started using readymade tomato puree, 1kg of which costs between Rs 70-90, whereas raw tomato is at over Rs 100 per kg.""

Mahindra & Mahindra Managing Director Pawan Goenka during his meeting with the chief minister said that his group was keenly interested in promoting electric vehicles in Punjab.He suggested a scheme to bring in electric taxis to propagate green energy and generate employment in the state. Amrinder said that his government was keen to explore electric vehicles as a replacement for the traditional, more polluting petrol and diesel run vehicles in the state.He pointed out that Chinese energy major Yinlong also recently discussed with him the possibility of launching electric cars and buses in the state. The government was also in talks with Ola for electric taxis, he added.An official spokesperson said that a proposal to launch an Uber-like app for tractors, called Tringo, was also discussed at the meeting. The app would enable owners to rent out their tractors, said the spokesperson. The chief minister responded favourably to Goenkas request for expansion of their tractor units in Punjab and asked the company to submit a proposal.Urging the company to support the states efforts to provide employment to youth, the chief minister offered help to Tech Mahindra in setting up a BPO in Mohali after Goenka said there was huge potential for IT sector jobs. Mahindra & Mahindra was also interested in potato seed development for exports, according to Goenka.The chief minister also reminded Goenka of his suggestion, made to Anand Mahindra in Mumbai, for setting up a defence project in Abohar.

The chief minister said the government was also considering the companys proposal to develop the Ranjit Sagar dam resort.Taking forward from their Mumbai talks, the two sides also discussed an Uttar Pradesh-like Dial 100 emergency response system for Punjab to provide prompt integrated emergency services to ensure public safety for all, including those with special needs. The chief minister said the Home and Police departments were studying the proposal.Mahindra groups plans to set up Mahindra world university in Ludhiana also came up for discussion. Mahindra & Mahindra, which employs about 6,000 people directly and another 30,000 indirectly in Punjab, currently earns Rs 6,000 crore revenue from the state.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

We sample flinty Basque txacolis at ostentatiously trendy pintxo bars. Drink tall, chilled glasses of Mahou, the capitals popular pilsner, with crackly bags of potato crisps. Then, we discover vermouth, heady, herbaceous and deliciously pungent, served with a bright tangle of orange peels. Were hooked.Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankees Spanish song Despacito is the countrys current soundtrack, blasting with equal fervour in clubs and supermarkets, and vermouth is its contemporary drink of choice. Despacito, an essentially Spanish track, has been sexed-up, glossed and accessorised so skilfully that it has become the worlds most streamed music track in just six months, with about 4.6 billion plays across streaming platforms, according to Universal Music. Similarly, vermouth, once proudly provincial, is being downed in bars from London to San Francisco, in its current slick, urbane, updated avatar.At a traditional bodega, sweltering with packed crowds, in Madrids arty Lavapies district, we drink it at the bar standing up, along with Patitas de Calamar, freshly fried squid feet. In the citys cavernous indoor markets, filled with raucous families, we hurriedly down a glass (or three) between buying bushels of juicy cherries, sticky pista nougat and paper-thin slices of Jamn ibrico.From grannys closetAt the immensely Instagrammable Mercado de San Miguel  a glamorous bartender serves it on tap, sliding our glasses across the bar along with a bowl of addictively tart green olives.This used to be the drink of our grandmothers, she says, before attending to a group of excitable Japanese tourists, who attempt to order everything off the menu. The options are sweet and dry. If youre a first-timer, she suggests you go with the sweet version. Served with a splash of soda and twist of orange peel, the drink is bright with an alluring chorus of synchronised flavours. Im familiar with it as a cocktail ingredient  it is essential in Martinis, Negronis and Manhattans  but really comes into its own when treated as the headliner instead of just another spot boy.This is an aromatised, fortified wine, flavoured with botanicals. Manufacturers start with a neutral grape wine, then add alcohol and a signature blend of about 40 or more, often bitter, botanicals, which include herbs, roots, barks, flowers, seeds and spices. The most notorious of these is wormwood, also present in absinthe. (Incidentally, vermouth is derived from the German word for wormwood, which is wermut).Italian originsThe drink was first produced in Turin, Italy, in the mid-18th Century, according to liquor historians (and what a fun job that must be!). Italian and French blends have defined the drink internationally, some of the best known brands are Italian Martini and Rossi, Cinzano and French Noilly Prat. Spain, however, has some very high quality versions. There are those made by established companies, usually in Reus, like Yzaguirre and Miro. There are also seasonal, hyper-local producers making Spanish vermouth, which is lighter and sweeter than the Italian and French versions.You can order yours extra-dry white, sweet white, red, amber and even as a ros. Admittedly, the extra-dry versions take some getting used to; theyre sharp and austere. Dry has a touch more flavour; think of an arid land in spring time. Then comes the sweet variety, reminiscent of a lush, moist, tropical forest.In America, the Quady winery makes Vya, an artisanal version that uses botanicals from India, Albania, Russia, Spain and Morocco. Australian Regal Rogue range marries a Hunter Valley Semillon with native lemon myrtle, desert limes, thyme and elderflower. The Ethicurean restaurant in Somerset has a house vermouth called The Collector, which incorporates 20 botanicals grown in their garden, including bay, rosemary, and yarrow. In London, Mele e Pere, which has been making its own version for five years, even has a vermouthier-in-chief called Ed, who teaches customers how to blend their own for 25 a night.Guide to vermouthAt a bookstore in San Sebastian, I stumble upon Ester Bachs Romagueras Gua del vermut (Vermouth Guide). The lady who runs the bookstore spots me flipping through the Spanish book, and insists I visit Bar Roberto for a drink. This is where I finally learn how to make the perfect cocktail: and it stars vermouth, of course.In the tiny wooden bar, which is standing room only, the friendly proprietor hands me a complimentary gilda, comprising deftly skewered mellow guindilla chillies, anchovies and olive, then pours out a sweet vermouth with a flourish. His bar blackboard lists about 20 varieties, and the shelves behind him groan with bottles from all over the world. He adds ice cubes, bitters, netted orange zest and an olive-laced toothpick. I take a sip: Its like rain in a jungle on a warm summer day.A loyal Roberto customer smiles and says, I have eaten a smoked sardine and drunk a vermouth that has lifted my beret.

The changing climate is also expected to experience negative impact on milk production in the region, predicts the parliamentary standing committee on agriculture in its report tabled in the Lok Sabha on Thursday.The report says that the climate change would surge production of potato in Punjab, Haryana and western and central Uttar Pradesh by 3.46% to 7.11% by 2030, but in rest of India potato production may decline by 4% to 16%.The 31-member committee, headed by Bihar MP and former Union minister of state Hukumdev Narayan Yadav of BJP, also submitted that irrigated rice in north-west India comprising Haryana and Punjab is projected to reduce by 6% to 8% by 2020. Whereas in other parts of the country the loss would be below 5%.Northern India, including Punjab and Haryana, is expected to experience more negative impact of climate change on milk production, the committee has found. It would be higher in crossbreds (0.63%) followed by buffaloes (0.5%) and indigenous cattle (0.4%).The committee noted that studies indicate that changing climate will decrease yields in major crops like wheat, rice and maize. On the other hand, the impact could be neutral to positive in crops like groundnut, soybean and chickpea. More number of generations of insect pests are expected to occur during future climate change periods because of increased temperatures. The committee found that more intense droughts are mainly observed over north and northwest India.The report says that in 2050, it is estimated that maximum and minimum temperature will go up by 2.40 degrees Celsius and 40 degrees C, respectively. Southern peninsula, northwest India and the southern parts of Punjab, Haryana and Bihar will be the severely affected due to the rise of minimum temperature. Apart from this, large shift in monsoon months, reduction in number of rainy days, increase in rain intensity and high frequency of cyclone would further aggravate the problems of agrarians.The committee was also of the considered view that policy of minimum support price (MSP) is promoting farming practices which are not suitable to local biographical and climatic conditions, thereby, causing problems such as depletion of groundwater resources, degradation of soil, and loss of local biodiversity. The report says that absence of an alternative and economically remunerative cropping strategy is forcing farmers to opt for prevailing water-intensive cropping pattern.It has also come to fore that paddy fields and Rumen fermentation are major sources of greenhouse gases (GHGs) in farm sector. ""Studies showed average methane emission of 40-70 kg/ha from rain-fed rice field and 100-180 kg/ha from irrigated rice fields. The nitrous oxide (N2O) emission having high global warming potential ranged 0.6-0.9 kg/ha under lowland irrigated conditions,"" reads the report.The report reads, ""However, the committee is distressed to note that despite efforts being made by the government, private sector dominates in seed production contributing to 50-57% of total seed production of the country. The main focus of private seed companies has been on the high-value and low-volume seeds.""The committee also noted that groundwater level has been decreasing in Punjab. With declining water table, farmers are deepening existing bore wells and shifting from cheaper surface mounted centrifugal pumps to expensive submersible pumps. This is increasing the cost of pumping in the agriculture sector. The report says that the quality of groundwater deteriorates with excess groundwater exploitation due to accelerated diffusion of contaminants from industrial and urban effluents to the groundwater."

Since agriculture makes up roughly 15% of India's GDP, a 4.5 to 9.0% negative impact on production implies cost of climate change to be roughly at 1.5% of GDP per year,"" reads the report.The committee said that various studies indicated overall reduction in productivity by 4-6% in rice, 6% in wheat, 18% in maize, 2.5% in sorghum, 2% in mustard and 2.5% in potato besides significant regional variability. Also, the committee has projected production deficit of 33% for cereals by 2015 and of 43% by 2050. Meanwhile, for pulses, the deficit has been projected at 3% by 2025 and 7% by 2050.Consequently, the committee has suggested that enhancing agricultural productivity is critical for ensuring food and nutritional security for all, particularly poor, small and marginal farmers who would be affected the most.Further, the committee found that the total post-harvest losses to agricultural commodities are estimated to be from 6 to 18% and nearly 30% of the agricultural produce harvested is lost due to inadequate storage facilities in the country, including in Punjab and Haryana.On over exploitation of ground water, the committee found that the Central Ground Water Board ( CGWB ) has submitted plan for artificial recharge in 442 over exploited ground water blocks in Punjab, Harayana, Andhra Pradesh , Karnataka, Maharashtra, Rajasthan,Tamilnadu, Telangana and Uttar Pradesh.The report says that as per the ministry of earth sciences, during the period 1901-2010, heavy rainfall events (rainfall exceeding 15 cm in 24 hours) over northern parts of the country show an increasing trend of about 6% per decade. Also, as per 5th IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) report, climate projections developed for India for the 2050s indicate an increase in the average temperature by 2-4C during that period, an overall decrease in rainy days by more than 15 days in western and central India and an increase by 5-10 days near foothills of Himalayas and north-east India.The IPCC has also analyzed that there has been a decrease in rainfall in the month of July but there has been an increase in rains in June as well as August across the country indicating a change in the rainfall pattern.The committee observed that animal husbandry and cattle rearing are important source of income for majority of farmers in Punjab, Haryana and other parts of the country.However, it expressed that national plan on dairying has ignored indigenous varieties of cattle leading to over dependence on crossbred varieties for milk production despite the fact that indigenous varieties of cattle possess many traits such as heat tolerance that can be very effective in future scenario projected for climate change.Mainly focusing on climate change effect on agriculture, the committee was of the view that there will be changes in consumption patterns in coming decades due to increasing rate of urbanization and increased income of households. It has been found that demand for fruits, vegetables, dairy products, meat, poultry and fisheries will increase at faster rate than that of food grains. The need for a climate-resilient approach to agriculture is critical for India where more than 80 percent agriculturists are small farmers and the warming trend in India over the past 100 years has indicated an increase of 0.60C, says the report."
5a0f51649855b76bf13d7e3f,are vegetable prices soaring?,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/are-vegetable-prices-soaring/article19527329.ece,2017-08-20,"What happened in July?July saw a rise in inflation at the wholesale level to 1.88% from 0.9% in June, with the spiralling tomato prices, along with other food items, contributing significantly to this rise. Tomatoes saw a sharp inflation of over 209.5% in July against contraction of 29.4% in June, according to data from the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy. Brinjal registered a rise in inflation to 21.1% in July, from Junes contraction of 3.1%. The prices of tomato, onion and potato have increased in recent months owing to disparity between demand and supply on account of a drop in production because of unfavourable weather, a rise in transport costs, seasonality and supply chain constraints.Why is supply low?While the rise in the retail prices of tomato is being associated with low supply from key growing States, including Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh and Karnataka following heavy rain in a few regions that damaged the crop and hindered transport as well, onion prices have seen a rise on account of low supply from the southern States.The fluctuation in vegetable prices, which is commonly referred to as seasonal, is associated with the economics of demand and supply. The Centre maintains that seasonal fluctuations in market arrivals have hit supplies. The other reasons for the fall in supply are adverse weather conditions and imperfections in marketing channels. However, the clash of interests between the consumer, the producer and the middlemen is a key factor that policy-makers must urgently address.Where is the problem?For years, the consumer, the producer (farmer) and the middleman have had a clash of interest when it comes to agricultural commodities. While the consumer wants to buy a commodity at the lowest price, the producer (farmer) desires to sell the produce at the maximum price. The middleman, on the other hand, wants to maximise profits. Striking a balance among these stakeholders could possibly address the issue of price fluctuation to some extent. Vegetable producers, especially small landholders, depend on intermediaries to sell their produce. As vegetables find their way to the market, the cost of packaging, grading, transporting and fees, besides the margins of the middlemen, are some of the elements that determine the final price the consumer has to bear.Will better storage help?Agricultural commodities with a short shelf-life are prone to price fluctuation and hence require better infrastructure for marketing.Economists like Prof. M.S. Sidhu at Punjab Agricultural University believe that improved transport and upgraded storage infrastructure will keep a check on price volatility. Indias cold storage capacity at present is nearly 3.5 crore tonnes, which is short by 30-40 lakh tonnes, and it needs to be increased. Besides, cold storages need to be upgraded, equipping them to store fruit and vegetables at right temperatures so that they stay fresh.Also, the high cost of transport needs to be addressed. In the case of perishable vegetables, the government could consider promoting low-cost refrigerated trucks and weigh the option of freight subsidy.According to an estimate, there are 7,000-8,000 refrigerated trucks plying in India, mostly transporting pharmaceuticals and dairy products. Transport of perishable vegetables in refrigerated trucks could be one of the options that would help in better supply and availability of the produce.What about the supply chain?The mismanagement in the supply chain is another reason for the huge gap in prices that growers sell perishable agricultural commodities for and what the consumer pays. Creation of co-operative groups and societies are probably an alternative that could assist in minimising the marketing channel. They can work in tandem across the States and supply vegetables from surplus regions to places where the produce is in demand.Most farmers in India have small landholdings. Nearly 85% farmers are small, who have less than 2 hectares. Cultivation has become unviable for these small farmers, but through cooperative groups and societies even a small quantity of crop produced by the farmer can be marketed. This will stabilise prices and benefit consumers.VIKAS VASUDEVA"

The late rains will benefit planting of rabi crops such as wheat and chana, Pattanayak said on Thursday.""We are expecting a very good rabi season, so that should make up for all the minuses which has been ascribed for kharif,"" he said. The season's total rainfall for the country is 5% below normal, but it will not make any impact on planting that will begin in a fortnight, he said.Most parts of northwest and central India received deficit rainfall, but farmers in Punjab and Haryana have access to canal irrigation that helps them plant even if rainfall is scanty.Pattanayak attributed his confidence on rabi harvest to an extended monsoon. ""It (Monsoon) is now in withdrawal phase but still not complete, as we are expecting four days of very good rain in some parts of south India,"" he said. ""That is the region where rainfall has been deficit."" A drought assessment report prepared by Mahalanobis Crop Forecast Centre under the agriculture ministry had said that as of August end more than 225 districts in 17 states had less than normal rainfall.Pattanayak, however, said, ""We have to read Mahalanobis data with actual field situation to get a clear picture.""He said the 5% deficit in monsoon rains for the season would not make any impact on food security and food production. ""The occasional dip in vegetables will be there depending on local and seasonal condition, but we are quite comfortable in onion and potato production,"" Pattanayak said.Mahalanobis data is largely dependent on satellite-based remote sensing indices, rainfall data, soil moisture estimates, crop sown area and irrigation statistics, which are used for drought warning and assessment.""We are in a very good position as far as agriculture sector is concerned, contrary to the popular impression that is being carried out that we had a deficit rainfall,"" Pattanayak said. ""This monsoon, deficit has been only 5% for the country and in parts  south peninsular, north-west and central MP  it has been more than 5%. Some parts like Gujarat, Rajasthan, Assam and east Uttar Pradesh have also been impacted due to floods, where once the water receded farmers went for replanting,"" he said."

(Express Photo: Harish Damodaran) Farm labourers planting potatoes at a field near Hathras in Uttar Pradesh. (Express Photo: Harish Damodaran)Pradeep Chaudhary alias Guddu has seen the potato trade going through periods of mandi (slack). But never has this 47-year-old witnessed bekadri (value destruction)  the term he uses to describe the situation in the last one year, since the Narendra Modi governments decision to demonetise all Rs 500 and 1,000 denomination currency notes.For about a month before notebandi happened on November 8, potato was selling at Rs 500-700 per bag of 50 kg (or Rs 10-14/kg). By the month-end, prices had crashed to Rs 300-350 and further to Rs 175-225 during February-March, when the new crop was being harvested. And strangely, they havent recovered from those levels, even as the season is over and planting of the next crop is almost complete, says Guddu, owner of Om Sheet Grah Pvt Ltd, a cold storage unit at Sadabad town in Uttar Pradeshs Hathras districtFarmers in these parts  the stretch from Aligarh, Hathras, Mathura, Agra, Firozabad, Etawah, Mainpuri, Kannauj and Farrukhabad in southwest UP accounts for roughly a fifth of Indias total potato production  plant the tuber during mid-October and early November. Only 15-20 per cent of this crop is sold at the time of its harvesting towards February-March. Farmers keep the remaining 80-85 per cent in cold stores  where the potatoes are maintained at 4-5 degrees Celsius  and make staggered sales through the summer and monsoon months.This time round, probably 99 per cent of the potatoes were put into cold storage, given the low prices and lack of buyers during harvest time. Farmers thought they would realise better rates later in the season, notes Guddu. But it hasnt worked that way. Currently, the normal large (mota) potatoes are being sold from cold stores at Rs 200-225 per bag (Rs 4-4.5/kg). The medium gulla tubers are fetching just Rs 90-100 a bag (Rs 1.80-2/kg), while being even lower, at Rs 50-60 a bag (Rs 1/kg), for small kirri potatoes.But the farmer isnt the only loser. Guddus cold store can stock up to three lakh bags of potatoes. 90 per cent of this would normally have been disposed of by end-October, with the air-conditioning, too, shut with the winter arriving in the second half of November. This would allow for maintenance over the next two months and enable storing of the new crop from February.The current year, though, has been different. On October 31  when the season technically ends and cold stores cannot run without obtaining renewal licences from the state horticulture department  Guddus unit was saddled with unsold stocks of 80,000-odd bags. Most cold stores have anywhere between 25 to 35 per cent of last seasons potatoes that farmers have kept and are not re-claiming, adds Guddu.Old potatoes being dumped outside a cold store unit at Sadabad in Uttar Pradesh. (Express photo: Harish Damodaran) Old potatoes being dumped outside a cold store unit at Sadabad in Uttar Pradesh. (Express photo: Harish Damodaran)The reason for farmers not taking back their stored potatoes is simple. Cold stores charge around Rs 110 for every bag, whether it is kept for one month or eight months. Besides, they finance farmers to cover their cost of harvesting, grading and bagging (Rs 45-50), loading (Rs 3) and transport from the field to the store (Rs 20). In many cases, the credit  usually at 1.5 per cent interest per month  extends even to the bardana or jute bags costing Rs 22-23 each.If the borrowed money with interest is also included, we have to pay Rs 200 or more on every bag to the store owner. If the price we are getting does not cover even that, why take back the bag at all? asks Puran Singh. This 60-bigha (12-acre) farmer from Tambka village in Mathura districts Mahavan tehsil still has 700 out of his 2,000 bags harvested during March lying at Susheela Cold Storage in Agra. Even on the remaining 1,300 bags, the money realised from sales, at Rs 125 to Rs 225/bag, has gone entirely to pay the store owner, leaving him with nothing.The cold stores will eventually recover their Rs 110 charge and also much of what they have lent to farmers with interest. For the farmer, a price of Rs 200 per bag (Rs 4/kg) may pay his liabilities to the cold store, but will not even cover cultivation costs, contends Chaudhary Pushpendra Singh, president of Kisan Shakti Sangh, a farmer advocacy organisation.He reckons the total cost of cultivating potatoes at over Rs 10,000 a bigha, which, at an average 40 bags/bigha yield, translates into Rs 5 per kg. If to this, another Rs 4 is added towards harvesting, bagging, transport and cold storage costs, the farmer will just about start making money at a price of Rs 9/kg. The breakeven goes up further by Rs 2/kg if land is leased at the existing rates of Rs 4,000 per bigha. For potato cultivation to be profitable, the farmer has to get about Rs 15/kg. Right now, he cannot afford to even buy new seed potatoes. Most farmers this season have used their last years stored crop as seed, points out Singh.But why are prices continuing to rule low even now, when cash has supposedly returned with the Reserve Bank of India printing new notes? This is a business that always operated on cash. While the notes may be back, you are still not allowed to make daily withdrawals or deposits of more than Rs two lakh. These restrictions, plus the fear of being tracked by the income tax department, have made traders wary of buying and stocking up produce, explains Guddu.The effects of it are being felt in places such as Hathras. This district alone has about 150 operational cold stores, handling an average of two lakh bags each. At last years average realisation of Rs 400 per bag (Rs 8/kg) for all varieties  including gulla and kirri  the value of this entire produce would have been Rs 1,200 crore. But at Rs 150 per bag (Rs 3/kg), the same 3 crore bags from a single district would be worth Rs 450 crore.If this calculation is extended to other potato-belt districts, you can imagine how much value destruction has taken place in the last one year. And the loser is not just the farmer, but also those who sell and provide services to him, observes Pushpendra Singh.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Photo: Pradeep Gaur/MintNew Delhi: When Prime Minister Narendra Modi voided almost all of Indias cash last year, Kuldeep Mishras savings were turned into worthless paper. The vegetable wholesaler was forced to spend hours in bank queues and his business suffered for a month.Still, he voted for Modi in state elections soon after and plans to do so again in a national poll due 2019.Wealthy people had black money and it all came out, Mishra said in a market in Sahibabad in Uttar Pradesh, one of Indias poorest states, using the local term for cash stashed away to avoid taxes. We have never had a better prime minister than Modi.Mishra, 49, says sales rebounded in a month, though official data show Indias expansion slowed to a three-year low in April-June, more than six months since the shock cash ban. Growth has also been affected by the disruptive roll out of a new sales tax, yet voters like Mishra are expected to vault Modi to power in his home state of Gujarat next month.Theres no single reason for Modis enduring popularity. While critics point to the Hindu nationalist agenda of his Bharatiya Janata Party as key to its electoral success, others say demonetisation fortified Modis reputation as an authoritative leader and undermined the oppositions attempt to paint him as a suit-boot government that favours the business elite over the poor by moving to make it easier to buy farmers land and hire and fire factory workers.While many accept that the move has dampened consumption, they believe it has dampened conspicuous consumption that was fuelled by black money and tax evasion, said Reshmi Khurana, Singapore-based South Asia head for Kroll Inc., a risk management firm that advises foreign investors. It did boost his image in the sense that hes being seen as decisive and willing to take bold action, even if it ruffles the feathers of entrenched stakeholders.The view is echoed by Vinod Kumar Gupta, a businessman in Uttar Pradeshs Ghaziabad district, who said Modi has the courage to take bold decisions. He has become a stronger leader, hes making India stronger, said Gupta, 73. His commitment to the nation is not doubted.Key testGujarat will be a key test, where voters will be called on to weigh Modis personal popularity against his policies, which have disrupted Indias vast informal economy that mainly deals in cash and creates the largest number of jobs. While India lacks adequate employment data, surveys suggest that Modis far from creating the 10 million jobs a year needed to keep up with his young and rapidly expanding workforce.The election in Gujarat, held on 9 and 18 December will follow the 9 December vote in the Himalayan state of Himachal Pradesh, which Modi is expected to wrest from the main opposition Congress party. The positive opinion polls are partly flattered by the fact that the Congress party and its leader Rahul Gandhi have failed to offer a compelling alternative.Rahul Gandhi is not very strong, he doesnt speak well and he lacks knowledge, said Shamshad Mohammed, a potato seller who said demonetisation pummeled the economy without stopping corruption.Though viewed as a landmark anti-graft move by the masses, many businesses viewed demonetization as an ineffective way to tackle endemic corruption, said Krolls Khurana. Modis also facing stinging criticism from within his own party, with a former BJP finance minister saying the government has made a mess of the economy.Aware of this change in mood, Modi has been countering with emotional and combative speeches, defending demonetization and himself as a champion of the poor. In a series of speeches last month, he said the Congress party tried to stall Gujarats growth during the years that he headed the state, from 2001 to 2014.He packaged demonetisation as a pro-poor and anti-rich move by projecting that he was going to take away black money from the rich and distribute it to the poor, said Arati Jerath, a New Delhi-based author and political analyst. As economic distress set in, his stature has diminished.She reckons Modi is benefiting from a lack of credible data to assess the full impact of demonetisation on the informal economy and the Gujarat elections will reveal sentiment on the ground.Milan Vaishnav, director of the South Asia program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said that any upside to demonetization will come only in the long-term, through greater digitization of the economy, shrinking of the informal sector, and a wider tax base.Back in Uttar Pradesh, several old men sitting in the shade near tethered water buffaloes said demonetisations harmful impact was over. Discussing the previous evenings news that India had moved up the World Banks ease of doing business ranking, they said they would continue voting for the BJP.Its not that all of Modis policies are good, said Mahendra Singh, 76, a retired factory worker. But well give him another chance in 2019. Bloomberg"

Nitish started the tradition of releasing an annual report card first in 2006 when he completed a year in power with the BJP. But last year the function to release a report card was cancelled in view of a train accident in Uttar Pradesh.Missing in action RJD chief Lalu Prasad talked about huge dharnas across the state against demonetisation on November 8. But on November 8, both Lalu and his son Tejashwi remained at home, as RJD and Congress leaders protested at Gandhi Maidan. ""The two biggest faces in the RJD abstained from their own party's function. Laluji might have received information that the size of crowds was not what he had expected. That's why he went off to Hajipur,"" said a BJP leader gleefully. RJD leaders in Patna are fuming. ""State party president Ram Chandra Purbey does not have the appeal to draw crowds like Lalu and Tejashwi can,"" said a senior RJD leader, insisting that the two should have participated in the event.The astrologer case After astrologer Shankar Charan Tripathi's appointment as national spokesperson of the RJD, some newspapers highlighted his ""murky"" past, giving JDU leaders a chance to attack the RJD. The development frustrated RJD leaders one of who even cribbed before a friend in the BJP how Lalu was making appointments in the party without knowing the person's background. The BJP leader told him that the same astrologer had been lobbying to enter the BJP for the past eight months but was dropped like a hot potato when the party got to know of his background. An old-timer recalled how Lalu had once called a press meet to say central agency officials were harassing RJD workers from Punjab. ""But those workers later turned out to be narcotic smugglers,"" the RJD leader said.Isolated After releasing Tejashwi Yadav's photograph with a girl, JDU spokesperson Sanjay Singh finds himself isolated, even within his own party. While BJP leader C.P. Thakur and Madhepura MP Pappu Yadav disapproved of the act, senior JDU minister Shrawan Kumar expressed his ignorance about it. ""Shrawan is very close to chief minister Nitish Kumar and there is an attempt by the JDU to show as if Nitish was ignorant of what his spokesperson did,"" said an RJD leader."

5b509b259855b708a7cccd3d,Winter rain to delay state potato harvest,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/winter-rain-to-delay-state-potato-harvest/articleshow/62028568.cms,2017-12-12,"Hooghly: The surprise showers over the last two days have taken a toll on the early variety of potato in vast stretches of West Midnapore, Bankura and Burdwan, forcing farmers to sow seeds afresh. The delay in sowing, along with a projected drop in the total acreage of potato this season, may lead to a supply crunch because the new variety is likely to reach the market earliest by March, instead of February. The notun aloo selling in the retail market now at Rs 25-30 a kilo are those from Punjab and Uttar Pradesh.Potato grower Chandranath Jana from Bankuras Jaipur said: I took a loan of Rs 10,000 from the rural cooperative to cultivate the tuber on a bigha (one-third acre) of land. The saplings have now all gone under water. The cooperative wont sanction loans unless I repay the earlier one and I now have to borrow from elsewhere to sow the seeds.A rough calculation of the input costs (seeds and fertilizer) and labour shows that a farmer needs Rs 10,000-12,000 per bigha to grow the tuber  costlier than sowing paddy. Yet, farmers took the potato route after incurring loss in the aman paddy because a substantial part of the crop was wasted while harvesting during the downpour. The damage of the early variety of potato will affect the sowing of the regular variety, particularly in the areas of Chandrakona and Garbeta in West Midnapore, Jaipur, Sonamukhi and Bishnupur in Bankura, and Jabalpur and Kalna in Burdwan.However, these are only a portion of the areas that cultivate the early variety. Many farmers in Hooghly and Howrahs Udaynarayanpur didnt go for the early variety sowing after the November rain. The untimely rain has damaged the crop in parts of the entire 4.25 lakh hectares. It didnt have any major effect in Hooghly, which alone produces one-third of the crop. However, the sudden rise in minimum temperature will delay the sowing of the regular variety (jyoti). If it persists, the total acreage of the tuber may fall by 25,000-40,000 hectares this season. Potato needs the chill by December-January for better productivity, said Pradip Majumdar, agro-expert and adviser to the chief minister.The saving grace for consumers is the 17.5 lakh tonnes of potato available in cold storages that can feed Bengal of 5 lakh tonnes a month for the next three months, till the new crop arrives in March. Patitpaban De of the West Bengal Cold Storage Owners Association said the monthly output from Bengal was 7 lakh tonnes. Des claim puts a question mark on the steady supply from cold storages till March, leaving a gap of 15 to 20 days in February when people wont buy the last lot of the stored tuber while the new crop will take some more time to reach the market. Potato, thus, may get expensive for a fortnight at the end of February. But Bengal farmers wont be able to make the fast money. Instead, potato traders from Jalandhar and Amritsar in Punjab, and Farukabad and Agra in Uttar Pradesh are likely to take advantage of the supply crunch."

Vishal Srivastav Leader of Opposition Ram Govind Chaudhary at a press conference in Lucknow on Wednesday. Vishal SrivastavLeader of Opposition in the state Assembly Ram Govind Chaudhary on Wednesday accused Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath of provoking and instigating opposition parties and asked him to be mridubhashi (soft-spoken). Chaudhary targeted Adityanath over his statement in the Assembly on Tuesday, when he had indirectly mentioned Congress president Rahul Gandhi speaking about aloo ki factory. Adityanath had said that there is a leader, who does not even know that potatoes are grown on fields, not in factories.While Adityanath had also said that many in the Opposition do not even know the difference between aloo and lauki or mango and sugarcane, Chauduary said, Aap to vipaksha ko khud uksate hain bharkate hain mridubhashi ho jaiye (You provoke and instigate the Oppositionbe a sweet-talker).Chaudhary said that he had raised the issue (of potato farmers) even during the previous Samajwadi Party regime. Lag sakhta hai aloo ka karkhana, said Chaudhary, while pointing out that potato farmers are facing acute crises due to extremely low rates of their crop in the market. He said that the anger of farmers is increasing. Replying to Chaudhary, Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya said that the state government had taken steps to help potato farmers soon after it had come to power. He added that apart from allowing and promoting export of the crop, farmers were also given exemption from mandi fee and the government had even purchased the crop. He said that the state government has decided to include potato in the midday meal menu of state schools.Congress Legislative Party leader Ajai Kumar Lallu, meanwhile, raised objection to the comment made on the statement of Rahul Gandhi but Treasury benches as well as the Speaker pointed out that no specific name was taken at the Assembly. As the Opposition went on to raise the issue of potato farmers, Adityanath said that his government has worked to give protection to all farmers without any bias. He said that while his government has announced support price for potato farmers for the first time, a three-member committee was also formed to solve their issues, apart from giving them other benefits. The chief minister said that for the first time, potato farmers were given permission to export their produce and orders have been issued to include potato in midday meals as well.Adityanath said that his government kisano ke hiton ko puri tarha se sanrakshan karegi (The government will protect the interest of the farmers in every possible way).At this point, Samajwadi Party MLAs staged a walkout, calling the government kisan virodhi (anti-farmers).Later in the day, Congress Legislature Party leader Ajay Kumar Lallu demanded discussion on the deaths of children across the state especially in Gorakhpur and staged a walk out over the issue. He said outside the Assembly that he demanded a discussion on the issue of childrens death in Gorakhpur and other districts, but was denied it. The Congress leader said that he would again raise the issue on Thursday.Chaudhary as well senior BSP leader Sukhdev Rajbhar also raised the issue of incorrect information being given by officers in reply to questions asked in the Assembly and requested action in the matter. Parliamentary Affairs Minister Suresh Khanna promised to order an inquiry into the matter and take appropriate action against the guilty officers.Meanwhile, the Uttar Pradesh Repealing Bill, 2017 was placed in the Assembly on Wednesday. In the written statement of objects and reasons for presenting the bill, Law Minister Brajesh Pathak maintained that, On the recommendation of the central law commission and Ramunujam Committee constituted by the central government, it has been decided to repeal those Acts, which were notified by the central government during Presidents rule in the state and during the British Rule before Independence and have become obsolete and useless. The Acts, which have been repealed include The Police (Agra) Act 1857, The Mirzapur Stone Mahal Act, 1886 and The Uttar Pradesh Appropriation (Vote on account) Acts of 1980, 1993, 1996, 1996, 1997 and 2002 along with The Uttar Pradesh Appropriation Acts of the respective years.For all the latest Lucknow News, download Indian Express App"
